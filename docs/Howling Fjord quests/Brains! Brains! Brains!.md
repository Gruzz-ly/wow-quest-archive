==Objectives==
[[Apothecary Grick]] at the [[Apothecary Camp]] wants you to bring him 12 Deranged Explorer Brains.
* [[Deranged Explorer Brain]] (12)
* [[Grick's Bonesaw]] (provided)

==Description==
Has [[Apothecary Malthus|Malthus]] drawn you in with his blather about beer kegs and crazy dwarves?

I'm not questioning that the dwarves are crazy, but I don't think stealing their beer is going to do any good.

What we need is brains. Lots of brains. We'll get down to the bottom of this mystery in no time, and perhaps even find a new component for the plague.

Take this saw, go southeast into the [[Whisper Gulch]], and kill yourself some dwarves. Use the saw to help you harvest the brains and bring them back here. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fizznik's Patented Earwarmer
|Earth-Infused Leggings
|Master Artilleryman Boots
|Arcanum Shield}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Did you get those brains? If not, I want my saw back. You'd better not walk off with that saw.

==Completion==
These brains are beautiful! Gorgeous, even! They're exactly what I need.

Thank you for your help, <name>. Now I'll show [[Apothecary Malthus|Malthus]] the truth his beer goggles couldn't reveal.
