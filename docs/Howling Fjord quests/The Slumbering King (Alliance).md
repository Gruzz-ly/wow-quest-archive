== Objectives ==
Defeat Queen Angerboda and stop the ritual to awaken [[King Ymiron]]. Should you manage to do so, return to [[Westguard Keep]] and report your success to [[Captain Adams]].
*[[Queen Angerboda]] slain

== Description ==
A sheaf of parchment drops from the still hand of the [[Necro Overlord Mezhen|overlord]]. Upon it you can discern the outline of the rituals that are taking place in the catacombs below.

However, it appears that the queen of the [[vrykul]], Angerboda, is having difficulty awakening King Ymiron. The ritual is taking place within the large chamber, known as the [[Winter's Terrace]], on the north end of [[Gjalerbron]].

If you hurry, you may be able to stop her before it is too late. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|10}}

== Progress ==
<Name>, what news do you bring?

== Completion ==
I'm not sure I like the sound of that one bit! The [[Lich King]] absconding with [[King Ymiron|Ymiron]] can only mean trouble. Unfortunate that you weren't able to kill him along with his [[Queen Angerboda|queen]].

Still, you've put a huge dent in their plans and bought us the valuable time that we need.

And who knows, with the way you get around, you'll likely run in to King Ymiron again. I'm sure that he won't fare so well the next time you meet.

== Notes ==
Lich king encounter #2!
