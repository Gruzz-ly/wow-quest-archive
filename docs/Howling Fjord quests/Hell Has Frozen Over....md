== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Vice Admiral Keller]] at [[Valgarde|Valgarde Port]].

== Description ==
[[Bolvar Fordragon|Fordragon]]'s got another thing coming if he thinks the group of green-gilled scrubs he sent to defend this port can hold out much longer.

<[[Macalroy]] raises an eyebrow as he examines your equipment.>

You, however, might fare a bit better.

The importance of holding this port cannot be stated enough; and with those monsters flying overhead, the situation around here has gone from bad to worse.

Report to Vice Admiral Keller just northwest of here and let him know that you're all out of bubble gum.

== Completion ==
The [[dwarf]] speaks the truth. We can't afford to lose this port. It's one of two safe harbors that the [[Alliance]] has on this chunk of [[Northrend|frozen hell]] - [[Valiance Keep|the other]] being a few hundred miles west of here on the coast of the [[Borean Tundra]].

== Trivia ==
The line ''"Report to Vice Admiral Keller just northwest of here and let him know that you're all out of bubble gum."'' is a reference to the 1988 movie ''[[wikipedia:They Live|They Live]]'' where Nada says "I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass... and I'm all out of bubblegum."

The line could also be a reference to the 1996 Video game ''[[wikipedia:Duke Nukem 3D|Duke Nukem 3D]]'' where the main protagonist sometimes says the line ''"It's time to kick ass and Chew bubble gum...And I'm all out of Gum"''

The quest's name in itself may be a reference to the 1994 Eagles album ''Hell Freezes Over'', or the common saying "When Hell freezes over."
