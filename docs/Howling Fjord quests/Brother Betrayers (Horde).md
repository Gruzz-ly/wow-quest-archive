== Objectives ==
[[Ulfang]] has asked you to kill the traitorous [[worg]]s, Bjomolf and Varg. Return to him in disguise in the [[Rivenwood]] after you have done so.

If you somehow lose the [[Worg Disguise]], return to [[Sage Mistwalker]] for a replacement.
* [[Bjomolf]] slain
* [[Varg]] slain

== Description ==
[[Longrunner Skycloud|Skycloud]] is from my dreams! If you are his friend, you are mine.

I was alpha male until the last full moon. Then the strange white worg, [[Garwal]], came from the north, and with the help of my once-brothers, he quickly became alpha worg. There is something unnatural about him.

To help, you must first kill those who betrayed me.

Bjomolf hunts to the northwest of a place the two-legs call [[Steel Gate]]. And look for Varg to the southeast, near the [[West Spear Tower]].

They will not be fooled by your form.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|40}}

== Completion ==
The smell of their blood upon your muzzle pleases me. Brothers should not turn on each other.
