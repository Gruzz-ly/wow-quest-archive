== Objectives ==
Search [[Wyrmskull Village]] for [[Zedd]].

== Description ==
To whomever finds this journal.

These bloodthirsty bastards have taken up residence in the ruins of Wyrmskull. What they want or why they're here is a mystery. In any case, the artifacts are not safe with those beast-men around.

Zedd and I made a new discovery while hiding out: a cipher to decode the tablets! Unfortunately Zedd and I were separated late last night. He had the cipher. Tablets were with [[Glorenfeld]] and [[Daegarn]]. Location unknown...

Find Zedd.

-Pulroy

== Completion ==
You've found Zedd. You're no doctor but the prognosis for Zedd is most assuredly negative.

It looks as if they were preparing to feed him to the [[worg]]s. Gruesome...

== Trivia ==
The title is a reference to a quote from the movie [[wikipedia:Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]], where Butch tells Fabienne, "Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead."
