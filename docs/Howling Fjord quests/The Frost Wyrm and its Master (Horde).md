==Objectives==
Slay [[Wyrmcaller Vile]] and use the Wyrmcaller's Horn to call down and slay [[Glacion]]. Then, return with the horn to [[Celea Frozenmane]] at [[Camp Winterhoof]].
* [[Wyrmcaller Vile]] slain
* [[Glacion]] slain
* [[Wyrmcaller's Horn]]
*Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
Your instincts were right to bring this to me, but my [[Wyvern rider|wind riders]] cannot fight a [[dragon]]. You must take help back west with you to [[Gjalerbron]] and slay the [[frost wyrm]] and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile!

Even now it may be on its way!

If I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it!

And <name>, bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Earthwell Footwraps|Magispike Helm|Silversteel Gauntlets|Lost Vrykul Signet}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10}}
*25400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|9}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
Is the attack averted? Is the great death wyrm and its master destroyed?

Did you retrieve the horn?

==Completion==
This horn is as cold as the land... perhaps even colder!

You have saved Camp Winterhoof from certain doom, not that we'll be staying here much longer. What a curious man you are, <name>. Perhaps you <race>-types from over the ocean are not so bad after all.

This calls for a reward. Which do you prefer?

==Notes==
Aggro [[Wyrmcaller Vile]] and kill him to loot the horn. Heal up. Use the horn to call down [[Glacion]].
