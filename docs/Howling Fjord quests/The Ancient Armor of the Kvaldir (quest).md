This quest is part of the [[Fury of the Kvaldir quest chain]].

== Objectives ==
Recover the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir and deliver it to [[Orfus of Kamagua]] in the [[Howling Fjord]].
* [[The Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir]]

== Description ==
I was on the vessel that was bringing in the armor. We'd just boarded the ship and were headin' back here when we were attacked by a [[Battleship#Forsaken battleship|Forsaken destroyer]].

They boarded our ship, took all the booty for themselves, and then sunk her.

That was the last I'd seen of that armor. If you want, you can take my bomber from [[Scalawag Point|Scalawag]] to the dreaded isle that the destroyer be docked. Talk to my woman, [[Alanya]], outside. She'll get you on the bomber.

If you manage to find the stuff, don't you dare bring it back!

== Progress ==
Have you found the armor?

== Completion ==
We must return all of the artifacts, <name>. When all four are gathered, you will put them back in their graves.

== Notes ==
[[Image:HarrysBomber.jpg|thumb|A convenient ride there and back.]]
Although [[Alanya]] cautions the player that "it's a one-way ride," Harry's Bomber is waiting to take players back to Scalawag Point after looting the armor.

The armor is in the bottom deck of the ship crashed on the island.
