== Objectives ==
[[Handsome Terry]] at [[Scalawag Point]] in [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to obtain 4 Bear Musk from the [[Rabid Brown Bear]]s in the surrounding area.
* [[Bear Musk]] (4)

== Description ==
Us pirates are known for many things, but hygiene isn't one of them. Most pirate ships be carrying five or six times as many rats as people.

It's no wonder all the bears on this island caught the rabies soon after we moved in. Long story short, the boss wants 'em all dead.

It just so happens I know a recipe for a bear musk fragrance popular among [[Stormwind]] nobles. We kill the bears and sell the musk. I see a fine business opportunity for us here. What say ye?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Ye got the bear musk for me, matey?

== Completion ==
Excellent work! It might not be quite as daring as plundering the high seas, but I'd be a darned son of a deckswabber if I passed on this opportunity.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Hotfix|date=2013-06-04|bluenote=Bear Musk should have a chance to drop again.}}
* {{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
