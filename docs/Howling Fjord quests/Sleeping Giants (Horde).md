==Objectives==
[[Ahota Whitefrost]] has tasked you with slaying 5 [[Dormant Vrykul]]. Return to him at [[Camp Winterhoof]] when you have done so.
*[[Dormant Vrykul]] slain (5)

==Description==
I've overheard what you've had to say with [[Greatmother Ankha]]. With all due respect, she's not having you go far enough.

You must also deal with the [[vrykul]] that lie dormant in the [[Waking Halls]] beneath [[Gjalerbron]]!

I have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the [[Necrolord (occupation)|necrolords]] have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely.

Surely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
I find it unlikely that you have dealt with enough of the dormant vrykul. Come back when you have done so.

==Completion==
You did what had to be done. The unwise might consider it dishonorable to slay the helpless while they awaken, but in this case you would have been a fool to have done otherwise.

And we certainly couldn't have just left them standing there to be ritually wakened, now could we?

It was a brave thing you did for all of us down in those catacombs, <race>.
