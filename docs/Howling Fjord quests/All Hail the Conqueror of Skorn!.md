== Objectives ==
Return the Westguard Command Insignia to [[Captain Adams]] at [[Westguard Keep]].
* [[Westguard Command Insignia]] (provided)

== Description ==
We—well, you—have done everything that we were sent here to accomplish <sir/ma'am>. I must say that it's been a pleasure taking orders from such a fine, young <race>.

The captain is sure to want to hear of your success, but if you decide to stay out here for whatever reason, I am at your disposal.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sun-fired Striders|Shaleground Bracers|Puissance-Infused Pendant|Vinewoven Tunic}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10}}

== Progress ==
I gather that since you're here, [[Skorn]] is no more?

== Completion ==
That's unbelievably good news! I knew that you could pull it off, <name>!

At least someone around here can produce results!

Well, this calls for a reward. Go ahead, take your pick. The treasury is open to you.
