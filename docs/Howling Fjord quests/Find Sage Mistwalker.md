== Objectives ==
[[Greatmother Ankha]] has asked you to check on the condition of [[Sage Mistwalker]]. She believes him to be at or near [[Steel Gate]]. 

== Description ==
<class>, I grow worried that my son, Sage Mistwalker, has been gone for such a long time. The land is cruel and deadly.

He spoke of a recurring vision that he had of a wolf, and went west with a small group of longrunners to seek its source. I believe the name of the place he mentioned was Steel Gate.

Will you find him? I want to make sure that no ill has befallen him. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||24}}

== Completion ==
My mother should not concern herself with my safety. But, I thank you for coming, stranger.

Since you are here, perhaps you will help me with a few things?
