== Objectives ==
Bring Lysander's Strain to [[Chief Plaguebringer Harris]] in [[New Agamand]] in western [[Howling Fjord]].
* [[Lysander's Strain]] (Provided)

== Description ==
I'm afraid our equipment isn't exactly the best here at [[Vengeance Landing]]. After all it's a military controlled outpost.

I will need you to take a sample of this strain to [[Chief Plaguebringer Harris]] in [[New Agamand]], follow the road beyond [[Baleheim]] south and then west. They have better equipment there - he will know what to do.

You must hurry, <name>. Our enemies are stronger and more numerous than us. We need to develop a viable weapon against them! 

== Progression ==
Yes, <name>?

== Completion ==
This strain is far from worthless, my friend! Those fools at [[Vengeance Landing]] have had all the answers right under their own noses!
