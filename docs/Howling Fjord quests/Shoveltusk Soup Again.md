== Objectives ==
[[Chef Kettleblack]] has asked you to obtain 6 Shoveltusk Meat and deliver them to her at [[Westguard Keep]].
* [[Shoveltusk Meat]]: (6)

== Description ==
With all of the strange disappearances of our livestock, we better resupply in a hurry, or the beasties around these parts will be the least of our worries!

Seeing as I'm in charge of feeding this lot, I'm going to need you to head east and get me some meat. More to the point, I'm looking to cook us up some tender [[shovel tusk|shoveltusk]] meat.

Just beware the stags... they're mean!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}|q=20|Shoveltusk Soup}} 

== Progress ==
There's nothing as sumptuous as the tender meat carved from the flanks of a shoveltusk!

== Completion ==
This will make a fine meal for the men.

<The chef leans in closer to whisper in your ear.>

Here, <boy/deary>, take some for yourself. You look like you could use some more meat on your bones!
