== Objectives ==
[[Taruk]] at [[Scalawag Point]] wants you to search for Black Conrad's Treasure in the northeastern end of [[the Isle of Spears]], north of [[Iskaal]].
* [[Black Conrad's Treasure (quest item)]]

== Description ==
You might've heard of Black Conrad, he's a famous pirate around these parts.

Well, he had a thing for gambling on my fights. He had a thing for not paying, too.

I'd love to collect, but trouble is... he's dead.

I was about ready to write the whole thing off, when I came across this...

<Taruk unfolds a map of the Isle of Spears with an X on a northeastern plateau.>

He hid his treasure on [[tuskarr]] land. I want you to get it. I'll be damned if I let that bilge sucker get away without paying.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Black Conrad's Treasure}}

== Progress ==
Did you find the treasure, <name>?

== Completion ==
I'll take the gold, as it is what Conrad owed me. The rest is for something for you to keep.

If you're ever in need of something more permanent, I'm sure I could arrange for something. In the meantime, may the wind blow strong in your sail, friend.

== Notes ==
It's on the plateau just north of Iskaal. Look for a dirt mound surrounded by [[Forlorn Soul]]s. 3 mobs will spawn, 2 Spectral Sailors and Black Conrad's Ghost. Kill the Sailors quickly, then Conrad.

:[[Spectral Sailor]] says: Yer dead, landlubber!
:Black Conrad's Ghost says: Looks like me boys need a hand!
:Black Conrad's Ghost says: Yarrrrr... dead again!

The treasure contains 1 blue and two green gems!
