== Objectives ==
[[Lieutenant Icehammer]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to slay Harpoon Master Yavus at [[Nifflevar]].
* [[Harpoon Master Yavus]] slain

== Description ==
That was a fairly strong showing at [[Baleheim]], <name>. Before you go off patting yourself on the back there's work to be done at Nifflevar.

We've located the [[vrykul]] responsible for most of the harpoon attacks on our [[frigate]]s - goes by the name of Yavus. You'll find him on the main harpoon structure on the bluffs of Nifflevar, southeast of here.

Track him down and execute him for crimes against the [[Alliance]]!

Do me proud, <name>!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Have you taken care of Yavus?

== Completion ==
It'll take them a while to find a replacement for Yavus. Now is the perfect time to unleash [[Guard Captain Zorek|Zorek's]] plan! While they're scurrying to regain control of Nifflevar, you're going to use their own harpoon guns against him.

== Notes ==
He's upstairs in the southern of the two harpoon buildings at 65,56.
