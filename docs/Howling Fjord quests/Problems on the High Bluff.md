== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Walt]].

== Description ==
As usual, the real work is left up to me and my crew. Thankfully, [[Beltrand McSorf|McSorf's]] team didn't die for nothin'. The cipher they recovered will help us crack the stuff we've found up here - that is if we can ever get back to it! Damned [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] have sprung up like leaks all over the place and are now attemptin' to bury the sites! Can you believe it? Bastards want to bury our finds!

Anyhow, talk to Walt over yonder. He'll get you started.

== Completion ==
Over half our team is dead or missing, junior. This is our last stand up here on the high bluffs. Those damned iron dwarves pushed out of both [[Ivald's Ruin]] and [[Baelgun's Excavation Site|Baelgun's]]. Now I've got a plan to get us back inside before they bury up all our goodies and we lose that data forever.
