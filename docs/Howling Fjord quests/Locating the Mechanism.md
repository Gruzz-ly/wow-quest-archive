== Objectives ==
[[Guard Captain Zorek]] at [[Valgarde]] in [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to bring him a Harpoon Control Mechanism.
* [[Harpoon Control Mechanism]]

== Description ==
Don't worry, <name>; this is all going to lead to something big! HUGE! You're just going to have to trust me for now and do as I ask of you.

We need to get the mechanism mentioned in the manual for the next step of the plan. I have a strong suspicion that you'll find one on one of those [[vrykul]] that operate the harpoon guns in [[Wyrmskull Village]]. You'll find them on the east side of the village, on the docks by the longhouses.

== Progress ==
Did you locate the mechanism?

== Completion ==
Outstanding! Those overgrown apes will soon know what it means to mess with the [[Alliance]]!
