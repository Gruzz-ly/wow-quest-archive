== Objectives ==
[[Walt]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to bring him a Large Barrel, Industrial Strength Rope and Dark Iron Ingots.
* [[Large Barrel]]
* [[Industrial Strength Rope]]
* [[Dark Iron Ingots]]

== Description ==
Tools? Check. Materials? Negative.

If we're going to build this thing, you're going to have to get me the materials.

First things first, <name>. For the skeletal structure I'm going to need a large barrel from [[Nifflevar]], some dark iron ingots from [[Valgarde]], and industrial strength rope from [[Baleheim]].

Nifflevar and Baleheim are vrykul towns northwest of here. Valgarde is located in [[Daggercap Bay]], also to the northwest. Speak with [[McGoyver]] to get the ingots. He'll fly you back here once you're all done.

== Progress ==
Have you got the infrastructure materials?

== Completion ==
Excellent. These combined with the skin will make for a flawless clone of the constructs the iron dwarves use.

== Notes ==
This quest's title references the catchphrase of [[wikipedia:The Six Million Dollar Man|The Six Million Dollar Man]] television series.

: Evenin', Gov'na.
