== Objectives ==
[[Walt]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to recover his Building Tools.
* [[Building Tools]] located at {{co|79|47|Howling Fjord}}

== Description ==
I've been studying this deactivated construct for days, <name>. I think I can create a reasonable facsimile of the golem that would have room inside to fit one passenger. The idea being that it would fool those iron dwarves and allow us to get inside [[Baelgun's Excavation Site|Baelgun's]].

Now, I'm not gonna be able to make anything with a hammer and poker. I need my tools! Unfortunately I left those behind at [[Ivald's Ruin]] when the [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] first attacked. Get me my tools!

Ivald's Ruin is located far to the northeast.

== Progress ==
Step 1: Get Walt his tools.

== Completion ==
Now that I've got my tools, the building can begin. Well, as soon as I have some materials. You'll be getting those for me next.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Out of My Element?]] while you're up there.

==Progression==
