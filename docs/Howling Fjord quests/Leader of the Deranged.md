== Objectives ==
Slay Squeeg Idolhunter and then report back to [[Sapper Steelring]] at [[Westguard Keep]].
* [[Squeeg Idolhunter]] slain

== Description ==
So, I hate to say it, pal, but while you were out, [[Captain Adams|the captain]] took a keener interest in that place.

Looks like he wants my old [[Explorers' League]] boss in there dead. My guess would be that we're gearing up for an offensive to clear out the rest of them, and the captain wants their head lopped off, as it were.

Do me a favor? Head back into [[Whisper Gulch]] and put an end to Squeeg Idolhunter. From what I remember, my guess would be that he's in the cave in the northwest corner.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Wrathwrought Shoulderpads|Whispersteel Handguards|Feather-Lined Shoulderpads|Spiked Skullguard}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Yep, we're definitely getting ready to send in a fresh batch of miners.  I tried to talk some sense into the captain, maybe try a different course of action, but he wouldn't listen.

At least we're only targeting Squeeg, and not everyone else in there.

== Completion ==
<The sapper grumbles as if he wishes that you hadn't succeeded.>

The captain will be pleased to hear of your success.

You know, since you've been such a good sport in dealing with this Whisper Gulch business, why don't you take your pick of one of these?

== Notes ==
Watch out for the dynamite toss!
