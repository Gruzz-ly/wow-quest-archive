== Objectives ==
Present the Vrykul Scroll of Ascension near [[the Thane's Pyre]] to call him out and slay him. Afterward, due to the nature of the ritual, you're sure that [[Father Levariol]] at [[Westguard Keep]] will be interested in seeing the scroll.
* [[Halfdan the Ice-Hearted]] slain
* [[Vrykul Scroll of Ascension]] (provided)

== Description ==
This huge scroll is made from dragon skin. Unfurling its more-than-ten-foot length, you can see that the images painted upon its scaly surface depict a mysterious [[vrykul]] ritual.

A vrykul thane, surrounded by angelic-looking beings, ascends into the heavens. A mysterious, darkened figure looms large in the picture's background.

A tingling in your gut tells you that the thane of [[Skorn]] is about to do this. You must stop it! A large pyre sits at the top of Skorn in front of the thane's lodge.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Supple Doeskin Moccasins|Shock-Bound Spaulders|Onyx Grips|Rejuvenating Cord}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10}}

== Progress ==
Yes? How may I help you, my child?

== Completion ==
Yes, my <son/daughter>, that is ominous-looking, and you obviously had the right of it.

Thank you for bringing this scroll to me. I am very keen to study its implications. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that these vrykul have a way to transcend death; at least those that are worthy.

By defeating the [[Winterskorn clan|Winterskorn]] thane, you proved him unworthy. The [[Light]] only knows what he would have become, and what terror he might have rained down upon us, had you not slain him.

== Notes ==
This item will drop from one of the pathing casters. The bonfire is up top. Be certain to bomb the towers on the way up and then fight towards the center. Don't stay in range of the towers in case they respawn! Clear some room, but the whole top area does not need to be devoid of mobs when the scroll is presented.

Script event:
:{{text|yell|Halfdan the Ice-Hearted|You think I do not know what you are trying to do? You think I haven't been watching you?}}
:{{text|yell|Halfdan the Ice-Hearted|You will not stop my ascension, tiny <race>. Time to die!}}

;After his death
:{{text|yell|[[Val'kyr Observer]]|How unfortunate, Halfdan.}}
:{{text|yell|Val'kyr Observer|We find you unworthy of ascension, Halfdan. Let your soul know oblivion!}}
