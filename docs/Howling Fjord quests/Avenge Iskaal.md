==Description==
The totem of Issliruk is ready, <name>, and for that I thank you.  We must cast our peaceful ways for the time being and strike at those who've attacked our land and our kin.

The pirate slavers that raided Iskaal have lost their minds and slaughtered all their captives.  Go to Iskaal, to the east of here and do what must must be done.  Take this horn and call on my brethren should you need assistance.

==Progress==
Have you done what I asked of you, <name>?

==Completion==
You are a formidable ally, <name>. My people will be forever in your debt.

==Notes==
Feel free to use the horn. Free guardians are great.
