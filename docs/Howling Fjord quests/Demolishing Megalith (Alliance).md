== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Megalith.jpg|Megalith|Leader of the runed giants.}}
Defeat Megalith and return to [[Researcher Aderan]] at [[Fort Wildervar]].
* [[Megalith]] slain
Suggested Players [3]

== Description ==
[[Binder Murdis]] created Megalith to be the most powerful of the runed giants and to lead them in their mission. Defeating Megalith will leave them lost and without direction. After the expeditionary force arrives, our soldiers will be able to isolate and defeat the remaining giants and oust their [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarf]] masters from their camps.

Search the foothills of [[Frostblade Peak]], north of [[Giants' Run]] for Megalith and defeat him!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|10}}

== Progress ==
Do you bring news of Megalith's downfall?

== Completion ==
You've done well in felling Megalith, but I wonder about his final words.

You're sure he said the [[Stoneforge]]?

I know of no such place with that name, but it sounds like a word with origins in the [[titan]]s. What plans do the Iron Dwarves have for such a thing? This bears watching, <name>, for we must find it before the Iron Dwarves' plan comes to fruition.

== Notes ==
When slain:
:Megalith yells: I have fallen! Fear not, bretheren! Let nothing keep you from the Stoneforge!
