== Objectives ==
[[Lieutenant Icehammer]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to place the Alliance Banner in [[Baleheim]] and then defend the banner against attackers.

Return to Lieutenant Icehammer with the Alliance Banner should you survive.
* [[Alliance Banner (quest item)]] Defended
* Alliance Banner Placed

== Description ==
I'm not about to put the fate of this mission into the hands of some untested scrub.

Now, if you want to prove to me that you've got what it takes to carry out this mission, you'll need to do what I tell you.

Take this battle standard and head over to [[Baleheim]], directly north of here. Once you're at Baleheim, find the center of town and drop our flag. Fight off any [[vrykul]] dirt bags that attempt to take down our beloved flag and return to me once you've established [[Alliance]] dominance!

== Progress ==
Still alive, I see. Clearly you're not trying hard enough.

== Completion ==
For the Alliance! You're a strong one, <name>. Strong enough to crack some vrykul skull at [[Nifflevar]].

== Notes ==

Plant the flag by the bonfire. Fight off three [[Winterskorn Defender]]s away from the flag.

*{{Text|yell|Winterskorn Defender|You dare challenge Winterskorn!? I will impale you on your puny flag!}}
*{{Text|yell|Winterskorn Defender|Your remains will be fed to the sharks of [[Daggercap Bay|Daggercap]]}}
*{{Text|yell|Winterskorn Defender|The sacrifices now bring themselves to us? Have you no sense!?}}

Though its central word differs, the name of this quest may be suggestive of the song ''Drop It and Rock It'' [http://www.sweetslyrics.com/587420.Mr.%20Criminal%20-%20Drop%20It%20And%20Rock%20It.html], by Mr. Criminal.
