== Objectives ==
[[Hidalgo the Master Falconer|Hidalgo]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to use your Trained Rock Falcon to capture 10 Fjord Hawks.

Return to Hidalgo with the cage when you have completed this task.
* [[Fjord Hawk]] (10)
* [[Trained Rock Falcon]] (provided)

== Description ==
Do you feel the closeness, <name>? Surely you feel a true bond forming between you and your falcon. Would you believe me if I told you that when the time is right you'll be able to see through the eyes of your bird? Aye, it is the ultimate level of falconry.

But first you must hunt more! The bird must hone and quicken its reflexes. Send it against a more formidable opponent! The fjord hawks of the region make the tops of the trees around us their homes. They shall be your next target!

== Progress ==
Your falcon must be constantly fed or else it will eat the prey that you are sending it to kill.

== Completion ==
Aye, the hawks are very territorial and often travel in packs. I suppose I could have told you that before I sent you out into the field.

== Notes ==
Just in case people are having difficulty finding the hawks, they are all over the area directly around {{co|73|59|Howling Fjord}}.  Also, each time you send your falcon after a hawk, a second hawk will almost always come and attack you ''if'' you are within aggro range of the second hawk.  Keeping max distance away from the pair can defeat this relatively minor issue.

== Hints ==

It may be helpful to write the following macro and bind it to a key. Then, you can just hover over the hawks and hit the key, instead of having to target them manually.
