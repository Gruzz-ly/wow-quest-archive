== Objectives ==
[[Apothecary Lysander]] at [[Vengeance Landing]] wants you to recover 10 Intact Plague Containers from the wrecked ship to the southeast.
* [[Intact Plague Container]] (10)

== Description ==
Not long after [[Arthas]] condemned us to this wretched existence, we in the [[Royal Apothecary Society]] have endeavored to create a plague of our own. A plague that would devour all flesh: living, dead or undead.

We've succeeded in creating this plague and we're here to hand deliver it to the [[Scourge]]'s doorstep.

The [[Alliance]] intercepted the ship carrying the latest strain engineered in our [[Undercity]] laboratories. Head to the wreckage southeast of here and salvage whatever containers you can. 

== Progress ==
Have you obtained the containers, <name>?

== Completion ==
It's good that you're back in one piece. The danger of becoming infected from handling these containers is not non-existent. I suppose I should've warned you about that earlier.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Blauvelt's Special Occasion Gloves
|Nimblefinger Scaled Gloves
|Antique Reinforced Legguards
|Imperious Worghide Cap}}
You will also receive: {{cost|3|90}}
