== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Annie Bonn]] at [[Scalawag Point]].

== Description ==
All the good work you've done for us hasn't gone unnoticed, <name>. Our second in command, the delightful Annie Bonn, is incredibly impressed with what you've done so far and wants to meet you.

== Completion ==
Well, well, well. If it isn't <name>. You show up at Scalawag Point, no one's heard of you except some [[Grezzix Spindlesnap|goblin friend]] of that half-wit [[Handsome Terry|Terry]].

Let's just say I'm a bit... skeptical... of your intentions here.

== Notes ==
She's in the building behind Terry, all the way up top.
