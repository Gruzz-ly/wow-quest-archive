== Objectives ==
[[Vice Admiral Keller]] at [[Valgarde|Valgarde Port]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] has asked that you bring him the Dragonflayer Battle Plans.
* [[Dragonflayer Battle Plans]]

== Description ==
While we were able to gather very little information as to the whereabouts of [[Ingvar the Plunderer|Ingvar]], we do know that [[Yanis the Mystic|Yanis]] resides in a cave next to the [[worg]] pit inside [[Wyrmskull Village]].

Intelligence gathered from the rescued soldiers indicates that Yanis guards [[Dragonflayer]] battle plans.

I need you to go back to Wyrmskull and recover those plans. Kill any [[vrykul]] that get in your way, including Yanis!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Benevolent Hood|Blood-Stained Chain Leggings|Bone-Threaded Harness|Nerubian Inner Husk}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|40}}

== Progress ==
Have you recovered the Dragonflayer battle plans?

== Completion ==
<Vice Admiral Keller glances over the plans.>

Outstanding! By the looks of things, there are many more vrykul villages in the fjord. A different tribe of vrykul is preparing for an assault on [[Westguard Keep]]. Hell, for all I know it may already be too late. We haven't heard from Westguard in days. Either way, we must alert Westguard!

== Notes ==
[[Image:Dragonflayer Battle Plans.jpg|thumb|The plans]]

*The plans are ''not'' in [[Utgarde Catacombs]], even though this can be mistaken from the quest description. They are in a smaller cave in the pit in front it.
*The plans are on the wall behind Yanis.
