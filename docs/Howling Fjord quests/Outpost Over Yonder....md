==Objectives==
Deliver [[:Donny's Letter]] to [[Stanwad]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]].
*[[Donny's Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
I see that you haven't visited my brothers at the Explorers' League Outpost south of here. Why don't you do [[Donny]] a favor and deliver this message to Stanwad. He'll be interested to hear about the activities of the [[Iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] up here.

Like I said, mount up and start heading south. You'll see the outpost right before you get to [[Baelgun's Excavation Site|Baelgun's]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 360 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]
* +25 reputation with [[Explorers' League]]

==Progress==
News from Donny?

==Completion==
Yea, this isn't anything we don't already know. At least Donny's still alive.

==Patch changes==
