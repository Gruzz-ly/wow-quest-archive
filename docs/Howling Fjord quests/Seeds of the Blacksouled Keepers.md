==Objectives==
[[Lurielle]] at the [[Frozen Glade]] wants you to freeze 8 Spores.
* [[Spore (Howling Fjord)|Spore]]s Shattered (8)

==Description==
The glade to the west, now the [[Twisted Glade]], used to be home to a number of [[Keeper of the Grove|keepers of the glade]]. Together with the sisters they saw to the glade's upkeep.

When the glade changed, the sisters died, but somehow the keepers managed to survive. Now, they seed the land with poisonous plants that wither healthy greenery.

I'll give you one of the cores from the ice elementals.  Once you've destroyed a spore, use the ice crystal to freeze it and keep it from regenerating.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards
|Drape of Distilled Hatred
|Blacksoul Protector's Hauberk
|Root of the Everlasting}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
The Twisted Glade is a terrible place. I never imagined our homes could become something so loathsome.

==Completion==
The ice core worked well for you? I'll have to remember that. I'm certain the keepers will not stop just because we've destroyed their work once.

==Notes==
Spores have a PBAoE poison/debuff aura. Watch out if you're melee. Kill the spores first, then click on the dead spore, and use the Enchanted Ice Core on them. You have an 8 second cooldown.
