== Objectives ==
Slay 10 [[Deathless Watcher]]s, 4 [[Fearsome Horror]]s, and 2 [[Putrid Wight]]s. Afterward, inform [[Greatmother Ankha]] at [[Camp Winterhoof]] of your success.
* [[Deathless Watcher]] slain (10)
* [[Fearsome Horror]] slain (4)
* [[Putrid Wight]] slain (2)

== Description ==
Your assistance to us has been tremendous, <name>, but there is something that is troubling me: these so-called Scourge.

The spirits of the land and air, the waters and the fire below the world, would not abide their presence, but seem to do nothing about them. We will see to it that they are dealt with!

Perhaps it is asking too much, but I would have you return west to [[Gjalerbron]] and destroy the unnatural [[Scourge]] in that vile lair. Be sure to check in the [[Waking Halls]] below Gjalerbron as well! 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Regal Pantaloons
|Loam-Stained Greaves
|Tribal Chestguard
|Worgtooth Pendant}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|10}}

== Completion ==
<The greatmother nods her approval of your actions.>

Thank you, <name>, you have done what is right and you have bought us a little more time to finish our preparations for leaving. We will soon make the journey north.

I am too old; when we go, I will not be able to carry everything with me. Would you like to take one of these?
