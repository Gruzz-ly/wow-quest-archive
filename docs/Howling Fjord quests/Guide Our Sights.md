==Objectives==
Use the Smoke Flares at the location of the Alliance Cannons on the northern wall of the Derelict Strand. Report to Dark Ranger Lyana at the Bleeding Vale after you've completed this task.
* Eastern Cannon Marked
* Western Cannon Marked
* [[Cannoneer's Smoke Flare]] (provided)

==Description==
We should be able to kill our way back to our guns. Unfortunately, visibility is less than desirable so you will have to mark our targets from the ground.

Take these smoke flares with you and use them to mark the locations of the cannons along the northern wall in the Derelict Strand, west of here, where the Alliance are holding out.

Let Lyana know as soon as the way is clear for the ground troops. We can take care of ourselves over here.

==Progress==
The cannons, <name>.  Is someone going to take care of them?

==Completion==
Excellent. I will signal our ground troops to make their move.
