== Objectives ==
[[Ares the Oathbound]] in the [[Utgarde Catacombs]] wants you to recover the Sacred Artifact.

This is a timed quest.
* [[Sacred Artifact]]

== Description ==
<Ares is dying. He gasps for air as he tries to speak.>

I am an envoy of the [[Order of the Silver Hand|Silver Hand]], charged with a sacred duty.

<!-- beta text? Wrested the artifact from the hands of a [[Alexandros Mograine|fallen warrior]] of [[Light]]. Our forces descended from the dread heart of [[Naxxramas]].--><!-- new text dated 11/28/2008 -->Our forces [[Battle for Light's Hope Chapel|were decimated]] in the [[Plaguelands]].  By the [[The Light of Dawn|light of dawn]], the [[Corrupted Ashbringer|artifact]] was [[Ashbringer|cleansed]] and made pure once more. So many perished in the wake of its redemption.

There is still a chance... still time.

The artifact was hurled into the den of the fallen, far below us. Guarded by the unmerciful dead.

<Ares' body glows with blinding light.>

Light. Will. Protect. You.

== Progress ==
[[Image:Sacred Artifact.jpg|thumb|The sacred artifact]]
<Ares is unconscious.>

== Completion ==
You feel compelled to place the sacred blade next to the body of Ares.

Upon doing this you are once again blinded by light.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Coldspike Longbow]]
* [[Ice-Rimed Dagger]]
* [[Regal Sceptre]]
* [[Stoneblade Slicer]]
* [[Whelpling-Skull Zapper]]
* [[Worn Vrykul Smasher]]

You will also gain:
* 20,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Notes==
You have 10 minutes to run to the bottom of the catacombs, run all the way through the undead, (take a left at the bottom of the stairs, then go straight), bouncing them off your super shield, get the Sacred Artifact, run back up to Ares and turn in.

The quest is currently bugged, and this bug has been confirmed as still extant in 4.0.3a.  Ares casts the Shining Light buff on ''himself'', rather than on the player.  It is still possible to complete this quest, but it is much more difficult and may likely result in the player dying at least once.
