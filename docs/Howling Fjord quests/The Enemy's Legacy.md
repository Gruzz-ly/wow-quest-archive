This is one of two quests given out of [[Ghostblade Post]], the other being [[Against Nifflevar]]. Both can be completed in a single assault on [[Nifflevar]].

==Objectives==
Go into [[Nifflevar]], north of [[Ghostblade Post]] and look for the Saga of the Winter Curse, the Saga of the Val'kyr and the Saga of the Twins.
*[[Saga of the Twins]]
*[[Saga of the Val'kyr]]
*[[Saga of the Winter Curse]]

==Description==
As our armies march through [[Northrend]], our enemies will not suffer mere defeat. Their houses will burn, their corpses will be devoured by our plagues, all trace of their existence will be lost.

This worries me as a seeker of knowledge. The eastern town of Nifflevar will soon be razed by our forces in [[Vengeance Landing]]. The [[vrykul]] bard, [[Helgus]], lived there and wrote three sagas: the Saga of the Twins, the Saga of the Winter Curse and the Saga of the Val'kyr. Obtain them before Nifflevar is destroyed. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|2|40}}

==Progress==
The scrolls, <name>?  Did you obtain them?

==Completion==
This is of tremendous value, <name>.  I must renew my efforts in salvaging and translating vrykul texts.

Don't get me wrong.  Our enemies need to be destroyed... their ancient knowledge doesn't.
