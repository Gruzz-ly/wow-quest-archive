== Objectives ==
[[Christopher Sloan]] at [[Fort Wildervar]] wants you to defeat Frostfin.
* [[Frostfin]] slain

== Description ==
The [[Northern Barbfish|barbfish]] you brought should work well as bait for most fish, but I fear it'll attract a monster!

When I first arrived, I put some of [[Nat Pagle]]'s favorite bait on my hook and cast it into the water. A huge monster latched on, with giant teeth and icicles hanging from its fins!

Would've pulled me into those icy waters if I hadn't cut the line! I can't use the new bait until ol' Frostfin's been dealt with. Use this bait near the sunken boat in the middle of the lake. He won't be able to resist!

* [[Fresh Barbfish Bait]] (provided)

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
I'm itching to try out the new bait.

Have you had any luck with Frostfin?

== Completion ==
At last, we can finally fish in peace! 'Course, by the time we catch anything the expedition'll arrive and claim it all for themselves.

You have our thanks, <name>. Don't be a stranger 'round here.
