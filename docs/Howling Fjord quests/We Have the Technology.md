== Objectives ==
[[Walt]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to bring him a Pristine Shoveltusk Hide and Steel Ribbing.
* [[Pristine Shoveltusk Hide]]
* [[Steel Ribbing]]

== Description ==
While the infrastructure for a piece of machinery like this is important, we can't underestimate the appearance of the construct. If we're to fool the [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] the clone must be exact!

I can make this happen.

Bring me a pristine shoveltusk hide from the [[Shovel tusk|shoveltusk]] of this region and steel ribbing from [[vrykul]] in [[Nifflevar]] or [[Baleheim]] to the northwest.

== Progress ==
We'll be back collecting our relics in no time!

== Completion ==
I'll have the construct all ready to go as soon as the infrastructure is complete.

== Notes ==
This quest's title references the catchphrase of [[wikipedia:The Six Million Dollar Man|The Six Million Dollar Man]] television series.
