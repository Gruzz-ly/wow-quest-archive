==Objectives==
Kill Necro Overlord Mezhen. Then, return to [[Captain Adams]] at [[Westguard Keep]].
*[[Necro Overlord Mezhen]] slain

==Description==
The [[Scourge]] are at [[Gjalerbron]] and they have necromancers with them! They must be working to bring the [[vrykul]] into [[Arthas]]' fold.

I want the leader of these necrolords eliminated!

Do whatever it takes, <name>, but see to it that Necro Overlord Mezhen, and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized.

I will not see the vrykul successfully allied with the Scourge!

Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of Gjalerbron.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Drape of Munificence|Dusk-Linked Leggings|Gold-Plated Coldsteel Girdle|Worgskin Shoulders}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Are you sure that you killed Mezhen and his necrolords, <class>?

==Completion==
<The captain breathes a sigh of relief.>

Well, that should take some pressure off of us.

<name>, time and again you have proven yourself invaluable to [[Westguard Keep]] and the [[Alliance]] at large. Pick something from the treasury, <boy/girl>! It's the least we can do!

==Notes==
Outside, second level, upstairs on the right.
