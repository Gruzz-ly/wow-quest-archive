==Objectives==
Bring 3 Giant Toxin Glands from [[Giant Tidecrawler]]s to [[Apothecary Lysander]] at [[Vengeance Landing]] in [[Howling Fjord]].

* [[Giant Toxin Gland]] (3)

==Description==
I've a feeling the long trip across the sea is affecting the effectiveness of our plague. What is need is a potent toxin to boost the potency of the strain.

The crabs near this beach area distant relative of the much smaller brown-shelled tidecrawler. The smaller tropical variety produce a paralytic toxin strong enough to knock out an ogre. 

As we all know bigger is better! The much larger glands on the local variety should prove more potent. Bring me a few!

==Progress==
Have you obtained the toxin glands I seek, <name>?

==Completion==
You continue to prove your competence, <name>. Hopefully this toxin will be enough to boost our plague to the levels that we need to.

At the very least it should help weaken the recipient and make them more susceptible to infection.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|2}}
