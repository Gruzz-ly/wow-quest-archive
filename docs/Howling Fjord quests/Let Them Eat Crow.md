==Objectives==
Pontius, the [[kennel]] keeper at Vengeance Landing, wants you to use the Plaguehound Cage to summon a Hungry Plaguehound and feed it Crow Meat from Fjord Crows west of Vengeance Landing.
* Plaguehound Fed (8)
* [[Plaguehound Cage]] (provided)

==Description==
The high executor wants me to use my dogs to sniff out enemy scouts, but I can tell you right now these plaguehounds aren't going anywhere until they're properly fed.

If our military doesn't understand that these beast are picky enough to not eat the rubbish they've given me, then they can't expect them to be of any use in the field.

You seem to have some time on your hands, why don't you take one of these dogs out hunting for crows out west? Their meat isn't very tasty to us, but my boys love it!

==Completion==
Did you hunt down some crows, boy? Good dog, good boy!

Ah, these hounds remind me of my days raising purebreds in Tirisfal... those were good times.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

==Notes==
It's possible that the title of this quest was inspired by the faux pas, "[[wikipedia:Let them eat cake|Let them eat cake]]", with a bit of the expression "[[wiktionary:eat crow|eat crow]]" thrown in for taste.
