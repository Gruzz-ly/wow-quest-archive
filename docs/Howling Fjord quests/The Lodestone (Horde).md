==Objectives==
[[Sage Edan]] at [[Camp Winterhoof]] wants you to compare the Rune Sample with the [[Broken Tablet (Howling Fjord object)|Broken Tablet]].
* Compare Runes with the Broken Tablet
* Suggested Players [3]
* [[Rune Sample]] (provided)

==Description==
We must find what's luring the giants northwest, so we can stop them before they reach their destination.

While the rune samples gave us some clues, the unknown runes worry me.

When I visited [[Giants' Run]], I noticed a large broken tablet jutting from the ground where the northeastern part of the area met the snow at the foot of [[Frostblade Peak]]. Take this sample, compare the runes with the tablet, and see what you can learn about the identity of this lodestone. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Completion==
<Edan listens as you describe your findings.>

[[Megalith]]? A literal transcription from the tablet! This Megalith must be the centerpiece of the iron ones' mysterious plans.

==Notes==
The Broken Tablet is behind a pile of rocks at {{coords|71.6|17.5|Howling Fjord}}. Go to the northeastern-most shoreline of the [[Caldemere Lake]] where it meets a ledge. Follow the ledge east and you will see the rocks.

You will see a short projection, there is no mobs to fight.
