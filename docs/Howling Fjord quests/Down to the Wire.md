== Objectives ==
[[Gil Grisert]] wants you to bring him 10 clumps of Spotted Hippogryph Down.
* [[Spotted Hippogryph Down]]: (10)

== Description ==
The vanguard of the [[Alliance]] force will be arriving within days. The soldiers will be expecting their winter gear to be prepared, but I've still got more [[cloak]]s to make.

I've been using spotted [[hippogryph]] down for the cloaks' linings, but my stock won't last!

You've got to help me, <name>. [[Captain Adams]] will have my hide if those cloaks aren't ready in time! Bring me all the down you can find out there. It's dropped to the ground by molting hippogryphs flying over the wilderness around the fort.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Artfully Tooled Leggings|Songscale Breastplate|Cold-Forged Bronze Legplates|Shimmering Cold-Iron Band}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Have you brought any of that down? I could really use it...

== Completion ==
Thank goodness! This should be enough to finish the order in time. Of course, I won't sleep until the troops arrive, but that's far better than risking Captain Adams' wrath.

I've heard the stories they tell about him!

== Notes ==
Just like any of the feather collection quests back in your 40s.
