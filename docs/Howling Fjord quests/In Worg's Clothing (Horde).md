==Objectives==
[[Sage Mistwalker]] has asked you to seek out and help [[Ulfang]] in the [[Rivenwood]].

If you somehow lose the Worg Disguise, return to Sage Mistwalker for a replacement.
* [[Worg Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
From my dreams, I know that Ulfang is in a cave on the snowy northwestern edge of the Rivenwood.

He is in great danger.

I have devised a magical disguise that will make you appear as a worg while you are within the Rivenwood. The disguise is weak, relying upon the strange magics of that haunted wood. While it will only convince the worgs, it will allow you to get close to Ulfang.

Please, <class>, find and help him. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|2|40}}

==Completion==
You look and smell different... you are not one of my pack. Tell me your story; I have nothing but time while I am trapped in here.

==Notes==
The item [[Worg Disguise]] doesn't work correctly, players have to log in and out for it to work.

==Progression==
