== Progress ==
<name>, you have returned. What news of Ulfang?

== Completion ==
Garwal was not a worg at all! I know of these creatures... they are called worgen.

But, Ulfang indicated that it came south from the Grizzly Hills? Odd. There aren't any worgen there.

I thank you for helping to restore Ulfang to his proper place amongst his pack. Now we both will be able to sleep peacefully.

Please, you must accept this as a sign of gratitude.
