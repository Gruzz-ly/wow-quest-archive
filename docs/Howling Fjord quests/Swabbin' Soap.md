Problem is, we're all outta soap. That's more your problem than mine though, mate. Being the newbie 'round here, I got a special trip for ya to make.

Up on the northwest coast of this island, there's a whole mess o' sea lions. Amongst the nearby ice floes you'll find the alpha bull, Big Roy. Bring me back his blubber and I'll magic-up the best soap ya ever seen!

== Progress ==
Where's that blubber? An' don't try to tell me he ain't got none either.

That Big Roy's so damned big it's a wonder he can still [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/galumph galumph] around!

== Completion ==
Ew, that's a stink if I ever smelled one!

Go on now, put it down here. I'll cast my spell and she'll be swabbin' soap for sure!
