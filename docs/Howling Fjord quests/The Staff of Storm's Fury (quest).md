This quest is part of the [[Fury of the Kvaldir quest chain]].

== Objectives ==
Recover the Staff of Storm's Fury and deliver it to [[Orfus of Kamagua]] in the [[Howling Fjord]].
* [[The Staff of Storm's Fury]]

== Description ==
Those artifacts are cursed and you'd be crazy to go looking for them, <race>. I know for certain that anyone that's come into direct contact with any of those items has either gone mad or been killed.

Take that staff, for example. Last I heard the ship that held it was abandoned and left to rot on the coast of the [[Isle of Spears]], north of here.

If you want that thing, check the ship's hold.

Whatever you do, don't bring that staff back here! And steer clear of [[Abdul the Insane|Abdul]]! He'll tear your heart out.

== Progress ==
You have the staff?

== Completion ==
We must return all of the artifacts, <name>. When all four are gathered, you will put them back in their graves.

== Notes ==
It's in the bottom of the hold of the ship docked to [[Iskaal]]. Avoid the named elite!

==Progression==
