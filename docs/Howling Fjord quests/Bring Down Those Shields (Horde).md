==Objectives==
[[Apothecary Anastasia]] at the [[Apothecary Camp]] has asked you to destroy 3 Scourging Crystals.
* [[Scourging Crystal]]s Destroyed: (3)
*[[Scourging Crystal Controller]] (provided)

==Description==
Look at the button on the side of the controller here. I bet if you got close enough to one of those scourging crystals, you could use the controller to bring its shield down. Then it would simply be a matter of destroying the thing before its shield goes back up.

Brave enough to hazard another trip down there, <name>? I can guarantee a nice reward for you if you can bring down those shields and destroy the crystals.

How can you refuse if it means less Scourge, especially ones made from murlocs?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Earthbinder's Regenerating Band|Ramshorn Greathelm|Ghoul-Crushing Stompers|Infused Coldstone Rune}}

You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

==Progress==
You still haven't destroyed enough scourging crystals. No reward until you do so.

==Completion==
<Anastasia turns and smiles at her succubus.>

Very well, <name>, I concede that you have certainly earned a choice of one of these.

==Notes==
To receive quest credit, the crystals must be destroyed by the player themselves, not a [[combat pet]].

==Progression==
{{And You Thought Murlocs Smelled Bad! (Horde)}}
