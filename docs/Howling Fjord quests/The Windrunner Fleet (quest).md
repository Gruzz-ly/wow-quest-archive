== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Bat Handler Camille]] at [[Vengeance Landing]] and obtain passage to [[the Windrunner]]. Report to [[Captain Harker]] aboard the ship. 

== Description ==
We have [[the Windrunner]], [[the Queen's Reprisal]] and [[the Oblivion]] stationed just east of the [[Derelict Strand]]. Send orders to the fleet's commander, Captain Harker, that they're to destroy the Alliance's cannons.

Speak to our bat handler, Camille, and ask for passage to the fleet's location. Be quick, <name>, every minute we spend fighting the Alliance is a minute we could've spent fighting Arthas.

== Completion ==
I hope you're ready to fight, <name>. The Queen's fleet needs you!

==Notes==
Speak to Bat Handler Camille:
:{{Gossip|I need to fly to the Windrunner.  Official business!}}

==Progression==
{{A Score to Settle}}
