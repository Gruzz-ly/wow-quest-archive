== Objectives ==
[[Greatmother Ankha]] has asked you to collect enough [[Gjalerbron Cage Key]]s to free 10 Gjalerbron Prisoners. Return to her at [[Camp Winterhoof]] when you manage to do so.
* [[Gjalerbron Prisoner]] Freed (10)

== Description ==
From the little we know, the [[vrykul]] are conducting unnatural rites in an 'awakening' ritual to the west in [[Gjalerbron]].

They're using living sacrifices to fuel their rituals.

<name>, you must stop this. It matters not who or what is in those cages, they must be freed. I would guess that the vrykul hold the keys.

The last thing we need is more of those strange vrykul threatening us, or worse, them wakening something even more evil.... 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Completion ==
A great stone is lifted from my shoulders to hear of your success. And I smile to know that some you freed were taunka.

Please, take this as a gift for what you have done. I shall see to the health of those you freed.
