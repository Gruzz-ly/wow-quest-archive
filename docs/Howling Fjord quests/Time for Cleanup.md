== Objectives ==
Speak to [["Hacksaw" Jenny]] in [[New Agamand]]. 

== Description ==
Being the practical man that I am, I'm going to declare our research here a success. After all, what army can't be stopped by turning its rank and file against each other?

I will send word of our achievements to [[Vengeance Landing]] soon enough. But first I need you to take care of cleaning up our experimentation site.

See [["Hacksaw" Jenny]] about making you a custom abomination. One packing some explosive power if you catch my drift. 

== Completion ==
What do you want? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something?
