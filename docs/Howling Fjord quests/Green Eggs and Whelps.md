==Objectives==
[[Plaguebringer Tillinghast]] has asked you to collect 10 Plagued Proto-Whelp Specimens and deliver them to him at [[New Agamand]].
* [[Plagued Proto-Whelp Specimen]] (10)
* [[Tillinghast's Plague Canister]] (provided)

==Description==
This new plague that we're working on is wonderful and I think we should expand its testing.

How about testing it on proto-whelps?!

Just think of the possibilities. The ability to infect not only humanoids, but extend our reach to any creature!

Here, I've hoarded an extra plague canister for the right time and place, and you look like the right person.

Spray the eggs at Ember Clutch to the northwest, then get specimens from the plagued proto-whelps that hatch. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Without those samples, how am I to tell if this latest strain of the plague can be expanded for use on all sorts of creatures?

==Completion==
What?! No, this can't be right.

CURSES!

This batch of the plague doesn't seem to have had any real effect on the proto-whelps at all other than to make them glow green!

My dream of using the plague upon anything we come into contact with seems to have gone up in smoke!
