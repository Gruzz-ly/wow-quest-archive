== Objectives ==
[[Ulfang]] has asked you to collect the Eyes of the Eagle. Return to him in disguise in the [[Rivenwood]] after you have done so.

If you somehow lose the [[Worg Disguise]], return to [[Watcher Moonleaf]] for a replacement.
* [[Eyes of the Eagle]]

== Description ==
[[Garwal]] hides himself behind an unnatural magic. None can see him unless he wants you to. There may be one chance we can take, though.

My enemy, the great eagle, [[Talonshrike]], is said to have eyes that can see anything. If you were to take her eyes, then you would surely be able to see Garwal.

Talonshrike keeps her nest at the base of a waterfall just to the southwest of the [[vrykul]] place called [[Skorn]]. If you touch the eggs in her nest, she will come down from the sky to kill you.

Get her eyes.

== Progress ==
You have the eyes of the eagle?

== Completion ==
<Ulfang howls loudly at your defeat of his great eagle enemy.>

The honor of the kill is yours. I wish that it had been my maw to finally close upon her neck.

Let us not waste the sacrifice that she has made for us. Here, eat them!

== Notes ==
Follow the road all the way down to [[Whisper Gulch]]. Immediately before crossing the north-south bridge just east of the gulch, take a left and run down the hill towards the waterfall.  Talonstrike's nest is located at {{coords|41.4|37.7|Howling Fjord}}.
