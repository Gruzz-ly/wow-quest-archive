==Objectives==
Kill Necro Overlord Mezhen. Then, return to [[Chieftain Ashtotem]] at [[Camp Winterhoof]]. 
*[[Necro Overlord Mezhen]] slain

==Description==
The dead ones are at [[Gjalerbron]] and they have necromancers with them?

We must eliminate the leader of these necrolords.

Do whatever it takes, <name>, but see to it that [[Necro Overlord Mezhen]], and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized.

We cannot afford to see the vrykul successful in whatever they are doing with these undead creatures!

Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of [[Gjalerbron]]. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Drape of Munificence
|Dusk-Linked Leggings
|Gold-Plated Coldsteel Girdle
|Worgskin Shoulders
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10}}
*25400 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|6|9}} at level 80)
*350 reputation with [[The Taunka]]

==Completion==
<Chieftain Ashtotem breathes a sigh of relief.>

That should take some of the pressure off.

<name>, time and again you have proven your value to the taunka of Camp Winterhoof. Please, choose something from our bounty. I insist.

==Progression==
