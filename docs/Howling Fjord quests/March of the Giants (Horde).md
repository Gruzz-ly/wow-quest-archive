==Objectives==
Sage Edan and Camp Winterhoof wants you to use the Runeseeking Pick on the corpses of 4 Runed Stone Giants.
* Runed Stone Giant Corpses Analyzed (4)
* Suggested Players [3]
* [[Runeseeking Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
To the east, at Giants' Run, rune-inscribed [[stone giant]]s have started to migrate north toward Frostblade Peak. I know nothing of their goals, nor of their destination.

The glowing runes inscribed in the stone flesh of the giants guide them on their journey. Fell some of these giants.

Take this pick with you and use it on the corpses of the runed stone giants. It will deactivate the runes. Once you've tested enough giants, return to me with your findings. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
<The sage listens to your findings.>

The runes for "north" and "west" appeared over and over? I'm not an expert in these runes, but the repetition suggests a strong command.

These carvings are more than passive directions, though. They seem to pull the giants towards something, but what? 

==Progression==
#[[March of the Giants (Horde)]]
#[[The Lodestone (Horde)]]
#[[Demolishing Megalith (Horde)]]

==Strategies==
With a kiting class, there is an easy way to solo this quest. Complete the quest in the same area up to [[The Rune of Command]]. YOu will need to command a Stone Giant of yours to complete it. The Stone Giant will aggro and attack other mobs, including the Runed Stone Giants. 

Kite and let your Stone Giant attack the elites. They hit for about 200 damage, and will bash occasionally, allowing you to hit the Runed Stone Giant or heal.
