== Objectives ==
"Hacksaw" Jenny in New Agamand wants you to obtain 6 Shoveltusk Ligaments and 1 Fresh Pound of Flesh.
* [[Shoveltusk Ligament]] (6)
* [[Fresh Pound of Flesh]]

== Description ==
So Harris wants a demolition job, eh? Yeah, I can help out.

You're gonna have to get me some parts, though. I can't afford to use up my choice components on something that's gonna get blown up.

First of all, I'm going to need shoveltusk ligaments... way better than the human kind.

I will also need a pound of flesh. A fellow known as Anton sells cheap meat. He travels up and down the road to the west. 

== Rewards ==

== Completion ==
Excellent! Yes, yes, these will do just fine!
