== Objectives ==
Apothecary Anastasia has asked you to destroy 15 Scourge of any type along the Chillmere Coast. Return to her at the Apothecary Camp once you have done so.
* Chillmere Coast Scourge Killed (15)

== Description ==
I came here to investigate a rumor about a Scourge presence nearby. I expected murlocs along the coast down below, but I never thought I'd see this!

The Scourge are down there, and they're changing murlocs, and anything else they can get their hands on, into the walking dead!

<class>, we will not suffer them to create more of their kind, especially not from murlocs! There is a ramp down to the beach just northwest of the camp. See to it that you deal with the Scourge in a timely fashion! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Completion ==
<Anastasia ponders your success for a moment.>

A satisfactory job to be certain, yet somehow I sense that there's something else we should be doing to stop the efforts of the Scourge on that beach.
