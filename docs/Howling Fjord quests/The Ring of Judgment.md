== Objectives ==
Find [[Daegarn]] in the [[Ring of Judgement]] located inside the [[Utgarde Catacombs]].

== Description ==
You might have already seen the room where Daegarn is being held while you were gatherin' the tablets. It's through this corridor and then down a set of steps. Daegarn will be in the room at the bottom of the steps - locked up tight!

Get down there and find him. At the very least you might be able to get the cipher from him.

== Completion ==
Yep. You found me. Woopedy-doo!

And no, I don't have the cipher. My beard was the first thing those beasts checked! [[Oluf the Violent|Oluf's]] the one that's got it now. He's the chieftain of the gladiators.
