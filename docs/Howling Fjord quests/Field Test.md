==Objectives==
Venture into [[Halgrind]] and use the [[Plague Spray]] on 10 Plagued Dragonflayer Vrykul. Return to [[Chief Plaguebringer Harris]] to report the results.
* Plagued Vrykul Sprayed (10)
* [[Plague Spray]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that we have a strain of the plague that has adapted to vrykul carriers, we really ought to test it on our specimens in [[Halgrind]]. If all goes according to plan, they will disintegrate immediately as the plague devours their innards!

You will find [[Halgrind]] north of here. Our plaguebringers are deploying the previous strain there - shouldn't be hard to spot. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Munificent Bulwark
|Tome of Alacrity}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Have you completed your field tests, <name>?

==Completion==
The plague didn't disintegrate our subjects?  Are you certain, <name>??!

There must be an external factor we're not accounting for... perhaps the low temperatures of this climate?  Perhaps... a mutation in the strain!

==Notes==
Originally the mobs had to be attacked before spraying them would count, but this was apparently a bug.  You now only need to spray them.
