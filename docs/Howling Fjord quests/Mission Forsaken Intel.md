== Objectives ==
[[Scout Knowles]] has asked you to deliver the Apothecary's Package to [[Peppy Wrongnozzle]] at [[Westguard Keep]].
* [[Apothecary's Package]] (provided)

== Description ==
Right, so I think you should get this stuff over to Peppy Wrongnozzle back at the keep. She's something of an amateur [[alchemist]], but she's the only one we've got.

One thing about Peppy; she does love her drink. So, you'll likely find her at the tavern 'soaking up the atmosphere'.

I'm sure she'll know what to do.

== Progress ==
Yeah, whadya want ...hic?

== Completion ==
Oh... hey, that'sh different!

Okay, let me shee that shtuff. I jusht love tinkering with alchemy!

Interesting, interesting... here, I think I know jusht what to do. A little mixing of that with jusht the right amount of thish.

You know, I think a little dash of this rotgut will help, too ...hic!
