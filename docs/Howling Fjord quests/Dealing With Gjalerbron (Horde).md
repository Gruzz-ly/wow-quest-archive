== Objectives ==
[[Chieftain Ashtotem]] has asked you to kill 15 Gjalerbron Warriors, 8 Gjalerbron Rune-casters, and 8 Gjalerbron Sleep-watchers. Afterward, return to him at [[Camp Winterhoof]]. 
* [[Gjalerbron Warrior]] slain: (15)
* [[Gjalerbron Rune-Caster]] slain (8)
* [[Gjalerbron Sleep-Watcher]]: slain: (8)

== Description ==
My longrunners that have lived to return have informed me that the vrykul have awakened at their main fortress to the west.

It is a forbidden place known as Gjalerbron. The longrunners tell me that the vrykul are performing strange rituals.

We cannot allow this to continue.

Are you willing to continue to assist us? Will you kill the vrykul at Gjalerbron before they finish whatever they are doing and attack us here?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Completion ==
You have my thanks, <name>. I know that you do not have any duty to me or my people.

What you say about that place troubles me still, and I sense that our culling is not quite at an end.
