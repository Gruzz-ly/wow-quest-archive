== Objectives ==
[[Old Man Stonemantle]] has asked you to find his daughter, [[Overseer Irena Stonemantle]], at [[Steel Gate]].

== Description ==
Tell me, is it true? Did the [[Deranged Explorer|explorers]] that went into [[Whisper Gulch]] go mad?

My daughter is the overseer of the [[Explorers' League]] that went north to some place called Steel Gate. With the horrible events that have befallen us, I fear for her safety.

Please, <class>, I am too old to make the journey. Her name is Irena. Will you go make certain that she is alright?

== Completion ==
Grrr. I knew it! He's sooooo over-protective! This is just embarrassing.

Not that I'm not happy to see you... I am! We all are. We can use your help!
