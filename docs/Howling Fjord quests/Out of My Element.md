== Objectives ==
[[Donny]] at [[Ivald's Ruin]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to kill 10 Iron Rune Destroyers, 5 Iron Rune Laborers and 2 Iron Rune Sages.
* [[Iron Rune Destroyer]] slain: (10)
* [[Iron Rune Laborer]] slain: (5)
* [[Iron Rune Sage]] slain: (2)

== Description ==
Keep it down, <race>. These [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] are quick on the trigger. Now don't let the activities down in the dig fool you. Those steel-skinned abominations aren't digging anything up! No sir - on the contrary - they're burying the site! For whatever whacked out reason, they don't want anyone finding this place.

What kind of dwarf buries ancient relics and dig sites? I'll tell you what kind: the kind you kill with reckless abandon! Get in there and take 'em out!

== Progress ==
You'll need to kill until you've had your fill.

== Completion ==
Good job, <name>. That'll slow down the burial process a little.

==Notes==
Pick up this quest before heading down into the dig site while on [[Tools to Get the Job Done]].
