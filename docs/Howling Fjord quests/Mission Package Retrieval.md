== Objectives ==
[[Scout Knowles]] has asked you to retrieve the Apothecary's Package from inside [[Halgrind]]. Once you have it, return to the scout at the [[Ember Spear Tower]].
* [[Apothecary's Package]]

== Description ==
Well darn, we need some of that plague-stuff.

I know!

While you were destroying the vats, I happened to spy one of the apothecaries from [[New Agamand]] being pulled into Halgrind by the [[vrykul]] down in there. Poor fella'.

<Name>, I'd bet anything that apothecary has the goods on him. Think you could go into Halgrind and retrieve his package?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
That place looks like a nightmare. Vrykul or not, no one deserves to be the victim of the [[Royal Apothecary Society]].

Glad I'm standing safely over here. You find that package yet?

== Completion ==
Holy... what the hell?! Look at this stuff!

We need to get this back to the keep a.s.a.p.!
