==Objectives==
Use the Plaguehound Leash near the plaguehound cages at Vengeance Landing and look for clues at the location you're led to by the Plaguehound Tracker.
* [[Plaguehound Leash]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that this rascal's belly's full, maybe he will be more willing to cooperate. Here's his leash, just come get him from his cage whenever you're ready to take him. 

I don't know what Anseim expects you to find, but look for clues wherever it is that dog takes you!

==Completion==
This scaly scroll is covered in stark painted images. You've a feeling this is the sort of thing the [[kennel]] keeper had in mind when he asked you to look for clues.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Horde Expedition]]

==Progression==
