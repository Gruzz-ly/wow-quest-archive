This quest is part of the [[Fury of the Kvaldir quest chain]].

== Objectives ==
[[Orfus of Kamagua]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to find Fengir's Clue, Rodin's Clue, Isuldof's Clue and Windan's Clue.
* [[Fengir's Clue]]
* [[Rodin's Clue]]
* [[Isuldof's Clue]]
* [[Windan's Clue]]

== Description ==
The path east of us is a primary hunting trail of the [[tuskarr]]. At least that's what it used to be...

More recently our hunters have been returning to [[Kamagua]] claiming that [[Risen Vrykul Ancestor|the dead]] have risen and are [[Blood Shade|out for blood]]! That is what has brought [[Padwai, Son of Orfus|my son]] and me here. [[Elder Atuik]] asks that we find resolution in the bluffs.

Will you assist us in our time of need? I seek heroes willing to brave the perils of [[Shield Hill]], southeast of here. Search the desecrated graves for clues and return your findings to me.

== Progress ==
The tuskarr need your help!

== Completion ==
<Orfus's whiskers bristle.>

Pirates... is there no end to the depths of their depravity?

We must recover the stolen artifacts and return them to this place so that my people may once more know peace.

== Notes ==
The four clues are objects on the floor of the exhumed graves. The named mobs will not attack.

Finding the Mound of Debris:
*{{text|say|'''[[Fengir the Disgraced]] says:''' From sundered ground the sacrament was stolen. [[The Shield of the Aesirites|The Shield of Aesirites]] is lost. Unrest will be eternal.}}

Finding the Unlocked Chest:
*{{text|say|'''[[Rodin the Reckless]] says:''' [[The Staff of Storm's Fury]] pilfered. A curse upon this land! The storms will never cease!}}

Finding the Long Tail Feather:
*{{text|say|'''[[Isuldof Iceheart]] says:''' [[The Frozen Heart of Isuldof]] will consume this land until it is returned. Woe unto those that hold the heart as the curse of frozen blood besets them...}}

Finding the Cannonball:
*{{text|say|'''[[Windan of the Kvaldir]] says:''' The anguish of ten-thousand years awaits any foolish enough to don [[The Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir|the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir]]. Beware the mist and fog, mortals; for with them comes your end.}}

If someone collects the debt from Harry (another quest), he is not a quest giver for a minute or two. Just wait a bit and he'll be back in quest mode.
