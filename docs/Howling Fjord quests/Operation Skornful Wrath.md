== Objectives ==
[[Captain Adams]] has asked you to use the [[Westguard Command Insignia]] at [[Skorn]], and then to speak with the [[Westguard Sergeant]].

== Description ==
<Name>, I must now ask you to undertake an operation so hazardous, so deadly, that only you can see it through.

The [[vrykul]] fortress, Skorn, sits on our eastern border. My scouts inform me that those 'giants' are poised to strike us, and with my forces scattered all over the [[Howling Fjord|fjord]], I don't have the men to take the place by force.

Instead, you're going to use your cunning. I've sent a sergeant ahead with the details. Show this command insignia at Skorn and he'll reveal himself and follow your orders.

== Completion ==
A pleasure to meet you, <sir/ma'am>! I look forward to working with you.

Speaking of which, we have a great deal to do.

== Notes ==
Whee! A useless guardian! Don't forget to ask for his spyglass.
