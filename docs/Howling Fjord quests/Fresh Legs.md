This is only a pointer quest, directing the player inside the dungeon [[Utgarde Keep]].  It is not, in fact, a prerequisite.

==Objectives==
[[Scout Valory]] wants you to investigate the sounds of battle coming from the northeast of [[Wyrmskull Village]].

==Description==
It's come at great cost, but we've completed our inspection of the site.

The news isn't good. Nearly everyone has been slain or captured. Only a few veteran guards remain unaccounted for.

The scouts have done all we can here. You must pick up where we've left off.

Sounds of a skirmish are coming from up the hill to the northeast. Have a look, <class>. We can only hope there are some who have survived, and that they may have some intel we can use against this enemy.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||48}}

==Completion==
Late though ye may be, it's good to see a friendly face.

Now stop standing around with yer thumb up yer nose, there's work to be done!

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
