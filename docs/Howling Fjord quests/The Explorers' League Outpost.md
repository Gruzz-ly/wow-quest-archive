== Objectives ==
Deliver McSorf's Bundle to [[Stanwad]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]].
* [[McSorf's Bundle]] (provided)

== Description ==
It's all a bunch of cryptic nonsense! Even with this cipher I can't make heads or tails of these tablets. Admittedly, cryptography is not my strong point.

You'll need to take the cipher and tablets to our cryptographer, Stanwad. Unfortunately, I haven't heard from Stanwad in two weeks. He took a team of twenty scientists to the dig sites on the southeastern bluffs of the fjord and hasn't been heard from since. The best I can have you do is have [[McGoyver]] over there give you a lift with his flying machine.

== Progress ==
<Stanwad grumbles.>

== Completion ==
<Stanwad takes the bundle from you and begins sorting the data.>

Wow. How many people did you say died to get this information?

<Stanwad shakes his head.>

You'll be happy to know that what [[Beltrand McSorf|McSorf]] and his crew of bumbling imbeciles discovered is an ancient recipe for tundra stew. Did he not notice the icons of common vegetables and the pictograph of a humanoid mouth chompin' down on said veggies? You don't need a damned cipher to break this code!

== Notes ==
McGoyver is tinkering with a [[dwarven flying machine]] at the water's edge.

: Yarp?  Yar wannar fly?  Narp...  No-no-no-norp gonnarp ha-hap-hap-happen!
