==Objectives==
The [[Winterhoof Brave]] suggests that you use the [[Brave's Torch]] to set fire to the Northeast and Northwest Longhouses and the Barracks at [[Skorn]].

*Northwest Longhouse Set Ablaze
*Northeast Longhouse Set Ablaze
*Barracks Set Ablaze
*[[Brave's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Chieftain Ashtotem]] ordered me to destroy many buildings here.

However, you are in charge, so it falls to your hands, <name>.

I suggest that we burn down the two longhouses and the barracks that are in the lower area of [[Skorn]]. All we have to do is get inside each and set them ablaze with this torch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40}} at level 80}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
I suggest that when we set the buildings ablaze, we not stay inside of them. The fire spirit will not spare us in its thirst to destroy.

==Completion==
<The brave nods at you in clear approval of your handling of the torch>

Let these vrykul feel the heat of the land. Let them know the fear they would instill in others!

==Progression==
{{Skorn must Fall!}}
