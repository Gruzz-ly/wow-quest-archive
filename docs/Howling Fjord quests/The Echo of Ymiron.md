==Objectives==
[[Thoralius the Wise]] wants you to search [[Wyrmskull Village]] while you are in the spirit world and find information about the Secrets of Wyrmskull.
* Secrets of Wyrmskull Uncovered{{coords|60.3|51.5|Howling Fjord}}

==Description==
The spirit world has fallen under the sway of the [[Lich King]]. Fearsome creatures made of pure nightmare now stand watch over the realm of the elements. I sense that these [[val'kyr]] are guarding a terrible secret.

I am too old and weak to survive another journey. You must go in my place, <name>.

Take this incense burner to Wyrmskull Village and use it to enter the spirit world. Find the large dwelling in the northeast! Avoid the val'kyr at all costs lest they make you a permanent fixture in their world.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
What have you discovered?

==Completion==
I do not understand. The creatures you saw looked like the [[vrykul]] that are attacking [[Valgarde]]?

==Notes==
Get into Wyrmskull Village and use the [[Incense Burner]] to enter a spirit world version of the area:
:{{Abilities|Echo of Ymiron|You are in the spirit world.|icon=spell_holiday_tow_spicecloud}}

Avoid the roaming [[Val'kyr Watcher]]s! The quest objective is in the longhouse {{coords|60.3|51.5|Howling Fjord}} by the harpoon launchers on the dock.

Players who wander too far in Wyrmskull will draw the attention of the [[Lich King]], standing in front of the entrance to Utgarde with two [[Val'kyr Soulclaimer]]s, in the following script event:
[[File:The Lich King at Wyrmskull.jpg|thumb|The Lich King? In Wyrmskull?]]
:{{text|emote|The Lich King turns to face you.}}
:''The Lich King casts "Magnetic Pull" and "Grasp of the Lich King" on the player.''
:{{text|emote|The Lich King grins.}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|Shamanism has brought you here... Its scent permeates the air. *The Lich King laughs* I was once [[Ner'zhul|a shaman]].}}
:{{text|say|Val'kyr Soulclaimer|Shall we prepare it for you, my lord?}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|No, minion. This one is not ready.}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|Do you feel it, mortal? Death seeps through me, enveloping all that I touch. With just a snap of my finger your soul will languish in damnation for all eternity.}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|But... It is not yet your time to serve the Lich King. Yes, a greater destiny awaits you. Power... You must become more powerful before you are to serve me.}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|Now watch, val'kyr. Observe as I apply pressure. Can you see that it is not yet ripe? Watch as it pops and falls lifeless to the floor.}}
:''The Lich King casts "Wrath of the Lich King" on the player, instantly killing them.''

Aggro him again, and the Lich King says something different when he casts "Wrath of the Lich King":
:{{text|say|The Lich King|Persistence or stupidity? It matters not. Let this be a lesson learned, mortal!}}

To complete the quest, find the ancient male and female vrykul in one of the longhouses on the dock:
[[File:An Ancient Portent.jpg|thumb|What's that in the crib?]]
:{{text|say|[[Ancient Male Vrykul]]|So then we too are [[Curse of Flesh|cursed]]?}}
:{{text|emote|Ancient Male Vrykul points to the infant.}}
:{{text|emote|[[Ancient Female Vrykul]] sobs.}}
:{{text|say|Ancient Male Vrykul|The [[Titan|gods]] have forsaken us! We must dispose of it before [[King Ymiron|Ymiron]] is notified!}}
:{{text|say|Ancient Female Vrykul|NO! You cannot! I beg of you! It is our child!}}
:{{text|say|Ancient Male Vrykul|Then what are we to do, wife? The others cannot find out. Should they learn of this aberration, we will all be executed.}}
:{{text|say|Ancient Female Vrykul|I... I will hide it. I will hide it until I find it [[Tirisfal Glades|a home]], far away from here...}}
