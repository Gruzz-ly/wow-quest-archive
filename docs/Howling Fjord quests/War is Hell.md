==Objectives==
High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing wants you to take the Burning Torch and use it to burn 10 of the corpses littered to the west of town.
* Fallen Combatant burned (10)
* [[Burning Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
We're slowly finishing off the remnants of Stormwind's North Fleet stationed on this coast. The bodies to the west are a testament to how brutal this confrontation has been.

This does not happen to bother my refined aesthetics, but it does present a danger to our lives.

In the lands of the Lich King, the dead are a weapon that can rise against us at any point in time. Take this torch you're going to make sure that doesn't happen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
I don't care how many giants, dragons or kobolds you've killed before.  Get this job done and come back when you're finished.

==Completion==
I'm glad you've proven you can follow orders. If I had a copper piece for every arrogant fool in shiny armor to come here and think they're above the chain of command... well, I'd have a few gold.

Now that you've demonstrated a measure of discipline, I have other tasks more suitable for someone of your caliber.
