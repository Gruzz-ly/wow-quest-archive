== Objectives ==
[[Longrunner Pembe]] at [[Camp Winterhoof]] wants you to test the Rune of Command and defeat Binder Murdis.
* Test [[Rune of Command]]
* [[Binder Murdis]] slain

== Description ==
Can you feel the power emanating from the runes I've carved on this tablet? They're smaller versions of the runes that the [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves]] are using. We'll use it to shut down their operation.

Take it to [[Giants' Run]] and use it on a [[Stone Giant|stone giant]] that the dwarves have not altered.

The giant should obey you, but I've tailored the runes to restore it to its natural state after a time. The giant may prove a valuable ally in the battle against Binder Murdis, the leader of the Iron Dwarf forces at Giants' Run.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Have you tried the rune?

== Completion ==
You've done well in defeating Binder Murdis, but the Iron Dwarves won't give up easily.

As my people move north, I'm certain we will encounter the Iron Dwarves again. Next time, we will be prepared to thwart them before they can dig in.

== Notes ==
Use the Rune of Command on a neutral Stone Giant, then find and kill Binder Murdis. Make sure your new combat pet attacks him. The stone giant companion is very useful in soloing the group quest "[[March of the Giants (Horde)|March of the Giants]]".
