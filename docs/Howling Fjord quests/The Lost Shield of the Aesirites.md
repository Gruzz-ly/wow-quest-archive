== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Captain Ellis]] aboard the ''Sister Mercy''.

If you listen real close you can hear cannon fire coming from the northeast. That's Captain Ellis's ship, ''Sister Mercy''. Thing is, Ellis and his entire crew were killed 'bout a month ago.

[[Ghost]] ship...

If it's info you be wantin' 'bout the shield, Ellis is the man to ask.

Sister Mercy docks on the small island between here and [[Sorlof's Strand]] to pick up more souls for the ship's crew 'bout once every five minutes. There be no shortage of souls 'round these parts...

== Completion ==
Arrr, me'n'me crew pilfered that thar shield! We be tryin' to get her back from that no good, landlubbin' scallywag [[Sorlof]]! Ye come to help, arrr?

Well, as ye can see we be runnin a [[skeleton]] crew!

<Captain Ellis laughs.>

''Sister Mercy'' be needin' another powder monkey to man the bug'uns o'er on the poop deck. Think ye be up to the job, me hearty?

Help me crew take Sorlof down and we'll split the booty! Ye can have the shield, me'n'me crew gets the rest!

== Notes ==
There's a tiny island between the isle and the mainland to the southwest where [[Juniper]] is standing. Wait there for the ship to dock.
