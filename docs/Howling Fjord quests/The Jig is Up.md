==Objectives==
[[Annie Bonn]] at [[Scalawag Point]] wants you to bring her [["Mad" Jonah Sterling|Jonah Sterling's]] spyglass.
* [[Jonah Sterling's Spyglass]]

==Description==
I know why you're here, <name>. You've been sent to kill our leader, Jonah Sterling.

I'd like to offer my help. Jonah's leadership threatens to ruin this entire operation.

Attacking the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]] fleets simultaneously? Suicidal. Trying to sell the [[tuskarr]] as slaves when they die days after leaving this climate? Disastrous.

Jonah's hideout is located inside a cave west of here. Bring me his spyglass as proof of the deed and my first action as lead will be to end all attacks against your allies.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sailor's Knotted Charm|First Mate's Pocketwatch|Strike of the Seas}}

==Progress==
Well, <name>. Did you get Jonah's head?

I can't just take your word for the assassination, you know? I am a pirate after all.

==Completion==
Jonah Sterling's days are finally over! He never thought this "wench" would make it.

As word of Jonah's death spreads among the pirates I will consolidate my leadership. Your allies won't get any more trouble from my crew, <name>.

==Notes==
He's in the bear cave at the northwest edge of the isle. Aggro him, get him to 50% or under and he'll go commit suicide by feeding himself to the big elite bear [[Hozzer]]. You'll wind up out of combat, so heal up then kill Hozzer.
