==Objectives==
Captain Harker aboard the Windrunner wants you to kill 15 North Fleet Marines.
*[[North Fleet Marine]]s slain (15)

==Description==
This should have been a walk in the park. Their forces are hungry, injured and ill equipped. Yet somehow, we walked right into their trap.

We approached these reefs from the south to gain cover and were immediately boarded by the Alliance dogs.

I'm sorry to say, if you want our cannons to fire at anything, you're going to have to help us take our ships back. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bone-Threaded Harness
|Benevolent Hood
|Nerubian Inner Husk}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
What are you waiting for?  Kill the Alliance scum already!

==Completion==
Nice work paring those mongrels down to size. My men will be able to clean up the rest.

==Progression==
{{A Score to Settle}}
