==Objectives==
[[Watcher Moonleaf]] at [[Steel Gate]] has advised you to cleanse yourself of Your Inner Turmoil through meditation at the [[Frostblade Shrine]].
* Cleansed of [[Your Inner Turmoil]]

==Description==
[[File:Cleansing Altar in HF.jpg|thumb|Your Inner Turmoil awaits you]]
Of late I've had nightmares concerning a [[worg]] named [[Ulfang]]. He has called out for help, and you must go to him.

However, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way.

But first, you must cleanse your inner turmoil through meditation.

There is a shrine that sits at the top of [[Frostblade Peak]], far to the northeast. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain.

Meditate there to cleanse yourself and then return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Did you find inner peace at the shrine? Is your turmoil gone?

==Completion==
Already I can sense the change within you.

Are you ready for what comes next?

==Notes==
Head west of [[Fort Wildervar]] and look for a small path which begins at {{coords|53.5|8.0|Howling Fjord}}. Follow it east.  At the top of the mountain ({{coords|61.1|2.1|Howling Fjord}}), right-click on the altar to meditate, then fight Your Inner Turmoil.

:'''Upon clicking on the altar
:''Your Inner Turmoil, a shadow version of yourself, appears.
:<font color="#F8B0DE">Your Inner Turmoil whispers: You think that you can get rid of me through meditation?
:Your Inner Turmoil whispers: Fool!  I will destroy you and finally become that which has been building inside of you all of these years!</font>
:''It attacks you physically!  Upon defeating it...
:<font color="#F8B0DE">Your Inner Turmoil whispers: You cannot defeat me.  I'm an inseparable part of you!
:Your Inner Turmoil whispers: NOOOOOOOoooooooooo!</font>

Upon being cleansed, you have a 3 minute feather fall buff, that can be used to simply jump off and glide back to town with your soul lightened.
