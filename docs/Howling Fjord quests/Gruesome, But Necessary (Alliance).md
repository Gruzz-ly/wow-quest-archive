==Objectives==
The [[Westguard Sergeant]] has asked you to use The Sergeant's Machete to dismember 20 [[Vrykul]] of the [[Winterskorn clan|Winterskorn tribe]] at Skorn.
* Winterskorn Vrykul Dismembered
* [[The Sergeant's Machete]] (provided)

==Description==
We've had reports that these vrykul can rise from the dead; not unlike the [[Scourge]], but a different kind of undeath.

Let's not take any chances.

Here, take my machete. As we move through this place, you'll need to carve up the remains of the vrykul that we take down. I'd do it, but I have a sensitive stomach.

<The sergeant smirks.>

I spent all morning sharpening it, so it should do the job.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
One thing that I know for certain is that I don't want to see any of these bigguns standing back up after we've knocked 'em down!

==Completion==
Well, <sir/ma'am>, I have to say that you went about that particular business with a bit of zeal.

<The sergeant looks at you warily.>

Anyway, if you don't mind, I'll be taking my machete back now. It looks dull and we wouldn't want you to accidentally slip and carve me up too.

==Notes==
Don't go out of your way to kill mobs. There are plenty. Just remember to ''use'' the machete after you loot them.
