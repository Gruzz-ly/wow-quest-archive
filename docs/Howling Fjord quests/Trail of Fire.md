* Rescue Apothecary Hanes

== Description ==
Thanks for bailing me out of this mess, <name>. I was not looking forward to what these Alliance scumbags had in store for me.

Let's get out of here and see if we can get back at them somehow. Is that a campfire over there? 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Coldspike Longbow
|Regal Sceptre
|Worn Vrykul Smasher
|Whelpling-Skull Zapper
|Ice-Rimed Dagger
|Stoneblade Slicer}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

== Completion ==
Apothecary Hanes is alive?  You burned the Alliance supplies to the ground?  He must've gotten a real kick out of that.

At any rate, the [[Royal Apothecary Society]] is in your debt, <name>.  We thank you from the bottom of our black, black hearts.
