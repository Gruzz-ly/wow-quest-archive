== Objectives ==
Bring a set of Iron Rune Carving Tools to [[Prospector Belvar]] at [[Fort Wildervar]].
* [[Iron Rune Carving Tools]]

== Description ==
I've got a set of picks, hammers, and chisels with me, but they won't work for carving these runes. The tools used by the [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves]] are imbued with magic during their forging.

When they're used to carve runes, the symbols form much more than mere words. These runes have the power to bind, compel, and twist.

I believe I know how it works, but without a set of those tools, I can't be certain. Look for kits resembling mine near the Iron Dwarf pavilions at [[Giants' Run]] and bring them to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Have you returned with those tools?

== Completion ==
<Belvar handles the tools carefully.>

I'm going to try these out. If we're to understand the Iron Dwarves' motives and defeat them, I need to know exactly what the runes are doing.

== Notes ==
When you accept the quest, Belvar says: They keep their tools in boxes that look like this. Look for them near the pavilions.

After the quest:
:<font color="#FFFF9F">Prospector Belvar says: I'm only going to carve the runes I think will give you the command over a giant.
:Prospector Belvar says: I'm omitting the runes for "north" and "west" because I'm not sure how they impact the giant. I'm also including a rune to limit how long you can control it.
:Prospector Belvar says: There we go, the [[Rune of Command]]... hopefully. Not nearly as vicious as its Iron Dwarf cousin, but functional.</font>
