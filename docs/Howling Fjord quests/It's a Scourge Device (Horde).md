== Objectives ==
Deliver the Scourge Device to [[Apothecary Anastasia]] at the [[Apothecary Camp]].
* [[Scourge Device (Horde)]] (Provided)

== Description ==
The [[Scourge]] creature you just destroyed had this device held in its clutches. It has a jewel set into it which looks similar to the one that tops the scourging crystals.

Surely, Apothecary Anastasia would like to have a look at this. 

== Progress ==
What's that you have there, <class>? Let me have a closer look at it!

== Completion ==
I can tell you what this is, <name>. It's a controlling device for those scourging crystals down there!

I bet anything that it can be used to shut down their force fields. Hmmm.

<The apothecary looks thoughtful as she ponders the implications of you having the device.>
