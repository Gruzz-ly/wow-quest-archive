==Objectives==
[[Lurielle]] at [[the Frozen Glade]] wants you to use her pendant on 7 Chill Nymphs.
* [[Chill Nymph]]s Freed (7)
* [[Lurielle's Pendant]] (provided)

==Description==
To the southwest was a glade that used to look much like this one. Mysterious forces and alien magics are reshaping the land. The glade has thawed, the sisters living there driven mad by the sudden change.

We thought to reach out to them, but they attacked us. I fear many may be beyond saving, but I cannot give up hope.

Take my pendant, travel southwest to the [[Vibrant Glade]], and use it to try to free my sisters. Wait until they have been weakened in battle, then use the pendant's magic.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Were you able to heal any of my sisters using the pendant?

==Completion==
So there is hope for my sisters?

<Lurielle looks away from you, then down at the ground.>

I feel guilty for not thinking of the pendant sooner. We might have saved even more of the sisters.
