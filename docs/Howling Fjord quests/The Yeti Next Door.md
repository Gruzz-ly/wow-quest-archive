Completing this quest makes several others available, though they are not a thematic chain.

==Objectives==
[[Foreman Colbey]] at [[Fort Wildervar]] wants you to defeat Shatterhorn.
* [[Shatterhorn]] slain

==Description==
Maybe if the sentries won't help me, you will? I'm the foreman of the [[Wildervar Mine|mine]] just across the bridge. My men are mining ore for the weapons our expeditionary force will need to carve a path into the [[Grizzly Hills]].

A giant [[yeti]] has invaded the mine, blocking the tunnel we need to expand! We've tried yelling at him and smoking him out, but nothing's worked.

Maybe you could rouse it from its sleep with a meal of meat from the [[Frosthorn Ram|frosthorn rams]] in the snowy areas around town? Please? We're desperate!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Braxley's Backyard Moonshine|Gholamcloth Wrap|Appointed Scalemail Leggings|Inscribed Worghide Treads}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress==
Have you had any luck removing that stupid yeti from my mine?

==Completion==
You've done it? By the [[Light]], you're a walking miracle! I was beginning to think I'd personally have to explain to [[Captain Adams]] why his men's weapons weren't ready in time!

==Notes==
Go kill rams to loot 4 [[Tough Ram Meat]]. Combine them, head to the mine. Use the [[Giant Yeti Meal]] in front of Shatterhorn.

Be warned: He hits like a truck and has a lot of HP! Be defensive.

==Patch changes==
