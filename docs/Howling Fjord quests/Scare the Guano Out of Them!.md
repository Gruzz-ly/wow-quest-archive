==Objectives==
Collect 10 Darkclaw Guano and deliver them to [[Engineer Feknut]] at [[Steel Gate]].
* [[Darkclaw Guano]] (10)
* [[Feknut's Firecrackers]] (provided)

==Description==
You, yes you... I need your help!

[[Bombardier Petrov|Petrov]] sent me up here to get bat guano for the cluster bombs he's making back at [[Westguard Keep|the keep]]. He sent me to my doom!

The [[Darkclaw Bat|darkclaw bats]] hang out in the [[Rivenwood]] to the north, but I'm not taking a step off of this platform unless it's to go home!

But you... you could get it for me! Yes? Pretty please?!!!

Here, take these firecrackers. My thinking is that if you drop 'em underneath the bats, the guano will be scared right out of them!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Icestriker Bands|Reinforced Tuskhide Hauberk|Bloodbinder's Girdle|Ice-Crusted Cape}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Please tell me that you have the darkclaw guano?!

==Completion==
Ugh, what's that smell? Ack, it's you! Well, I guess I did send you on a smelly job!

Thank you, <class>. Don't worry, I'll get this stuff back to Petrov as soon as we get out of here.

<Feknut yells out loud to the explorers.>

You hear that guys? Let's get out of here!!!

==Notes==
In concept, the guano collected during this quest is packed into the bombs provided for Petrov's daily [[Break the Blockade|attack]] on the Northsea Freebooters.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.8|note=now only requires 10 [[Darkclaw Guano]], down from 15. Also, only the character that scared the bat, or their party, may now loot the guano. }}
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
