== Objectives ==
[[Christopher Sloan]] at [[Fort Wildervar]] wants you to bring him 7 Northern Barbfish.
* [[Northern Barbfish]]: (7)

== Description ==
I never want to see another barrel of salted fish as long as I live! Filling barrels day in and day out, and there are still more to be filled!

I wish I hadn't used up all that bait I bought from [[Nat Pagle]]. Worked like magic, it did. Now I'm lucky if I can catch a fish an hour!

I hear the northern barbfish make pretty good bait, but who's crazy enough to dive into a freezing cold lake and hack up the water plants in search of them? Not me... but maybe, just maybe, I can persuade you to...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|40}}

== Progress ==
You look like you're still in one piece. Get any of that bait?

== Completion ==
Well, these certainly are ugly enough, but I suppose I don't care if it actually works. I'll be relieved once the expedition has passed through and I can simply go back to fishing for my dinner.

== Notes ==
Get in the water, look for the [[Water Plant]]s, loot them to hopefully spawn a [[Northern Barbfish]] and kill it. Otherwise, kill whatever else spawns.

The other things that can spawn from a water plant are:
* [[Caldemere Snapper]]
* [[Forsaken Spy]]
