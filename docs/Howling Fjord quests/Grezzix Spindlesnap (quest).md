This quest is part of the [[Fury of the Kvaldir quest chain]].

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Grezzix Spindlesnap]].

== Description ==
The pirate thieves have set up port at [[Scalawag Point]], far to the south. Unfortunately, they have fortified their camp with many deadly defenses.

There is someone that might be able to assist us in infiltrating Scalawag.

A pirate [[mercenary]] by the name of [[Grezzix Spindlesnap]] recently came to our village in search of food and shelter. In exchange he gives us information about our enemies and feeds them misinformation about our attack plans. Seek him out at his ship just off the coast here - southwest.

== Completion ==
Yarr, matey. Grezzix never did like to get his hands dirty! A pirate's life for Grezzix is a good one, so long as Grezzix doesn't have to do any of the work.

I've seen those artifacts. It's the reason I'm here and not at Scalawag myself! Bad, bad things those are...

Hey, it's your life though, right? You wanna get inside Scalawag and Grezzix can help.

== Notes ==
Pay very close attention to the dialogue for this little quest chain... It says to look for a "ship". Hah! Look for the extra-large rowboat alongside a "Battle Canoe" with a [[tauren]] stuffed inside it.
