== Objectives ==
Take Glorenfeld's Package to [[Beltrand McSorf]] at [[Valgarde|Valgarde Port]].
* [[Glorenfeld's Package]] (provided)

== Description ==
'Tis a shame we lost two of our best dwarves while uncovering these relics. They sacrificed their lives to keep this information safe.

<Glorenfeld wraps the cipher and tablets in a tattered cloth.>

Take these back to Valgarde. McSorf will know what to do with the find.

As for me? I'll be alright on my own. I've gotten this far in one piece!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Deacon's Wraps|Stretch-Hide Spaulders|Streamlined Stompers|Scavenged Tirasian Plate}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|20}}

== Progress ==
You're back!

== Completion ==
Sorting these tablets out is going to take some time. All I can gather from a precursory study is that whatever used to be here was an ancestor of the humans. These [[vrykul]] things probably killed 'em all off. Anyhow, we'll know more once I get these relics set up.
