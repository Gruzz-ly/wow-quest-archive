== Objectives ==
Return the Sacred Artifact to [[Lord Irulon Trueblade]] at [[Valgarde]].
* [[Sacred Artifact]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Ares smiles.>

Glory to the [[Light]]. You've done it!

<Ares coughs.>

Take the artifact and return it to Valgarde. Lord Irulon Trueblade awaits its return.

Fight with honor, friend. Always. Honor.

<Ares dies.>

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
By the Light!

== Completion ==
Many men and women died to recover this blade. Alas, I fear valiant [[Ares the Oathbound|Ares]] will not be the last.

But you do the Light's work, hero. This sacred blade was wielded by [[Tirion Fordring|Lord Tirion Fordring]] himself. Even now the [[Order of the Silver Hand|Order]] works toward [[Icecrown]]. Lord Fordring has vowed that he will tear down the walls of the cursed place himself! And with the blade, he just might stand a chance against the [[Lich King]].

Lord Fordring remains our greatest hope.

:{{text|say|Highlord Tirion Fordring|But you are right, Irulon.  The price of our freedom will undoubtedly cost thousands more of their lives.}}
