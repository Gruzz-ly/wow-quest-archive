== Objectives ==
[[Vice Admiral Keller]] at [[Valgarde|Valgarde Port]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to rescue 8 [[Impaled Valgarde Scout|Valgarde Scouts]] that have been impaled and left for dead.
* Valgarde Scout Rescued: (8)

== Description ==
We'd been here a month when those malformed giants appeared out of thin air. We were ill-prepared for any sort of attack and paid dearly for our complacency. An entire archaeology team was lost and several townsfolk were abducted and taken to the ruins. We've been on the defensive ever since.

To make matters worse, the scouts we sent to rescue our people have been harpooned by the [[vrykul]] and left for dead in the forest directly north of Valgarde. Dislodge those [[Ceremonial Dragonflayer Harpoon|harpoons]] and free our scouts!

You will also receive: {{cost|4|40}}

== Progress ==
Find those scouts!

== Completion ==
What the vrykul did to our scouts was a gruesome display of savagery. It was a scare tactic, meant to weaken our resolve... to send us running in fear for our lives.

It failed.

We are going to show those bastards what it means to wage war against the [[Alliance]]!

*They left us here impaled as a warning to the others... Several still alive... prisoners of...
