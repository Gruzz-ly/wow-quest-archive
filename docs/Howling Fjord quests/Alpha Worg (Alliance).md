== Objectives ==
[[Ulfang]] has asked you to slay Garwal. Then, return the Worg Disguise to [[Watcher Moonleaf]] at Steel Gate.
* [[Garwal]] slain
* [[Worg Disguise]]

== Description ==
When you've eaten [[Talonshrike]]'s eyes, you should be able see Garwal and rip out his throat!

<Race>-thing, seek out and slay Garwal in the western [[Rivenwood]]. After you have killed him, go and tell Moonleaf that I am once more the alpha [[worg]]!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gholamweave Leggings|Darksteel Ringmail Greaves|Worgblood Berserker's Hauberk|Proto-Drake Tooth Spaulders}}

== Progress ==
<Name>, you have returned. What news of Ulfang?

== Completion ==
Garwal was not a worg at all! That thing you describe him turning in to sounds a lot like a [[worgen]]!

But, Ulfang said that it came south from the [[Grizzly Hills]]? Odd, there aren't any worgen there.

I thank you for helping to restore Ulfang to his proper place amongst his pack. Now we will both be able to sleep peacefully.

Please, you must accept this as a sign of gratitude.

==Notes==
Garwal can be found around {{coords|26|11|Howling Fjord}}.

There may not be worgen in the Grizzly Hills, but there are werewolves...
