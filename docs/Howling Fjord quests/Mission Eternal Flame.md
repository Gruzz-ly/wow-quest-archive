==Objectives==
[[Scout Knowles]] at the [[Ember Spear Tower]] has recommended that you use the [[Ever-Burning Torches]] to destroy the four Plague Tanks surrounding [[Halgrind]].
* Southwest Plague Tank Destroyed
* Northwest Plague Tank Destroyed
* Northeast Plague Tank Destroyed
* Southeast Plague Tank Destroyed

==Description==
The [[Forsaken]] are up to no good and from what I can tell, those plague tanks of sludge are a big part of it.

If I may suggest, <sir/ma'am>, we should probably destroy them before they can get any more use out of the things. I took the liberty of preparing a bundle of torches from the [[Ember Clutch]]. These things have been burning for days!

Here, I'm sure you can put them to better use than I in destroying those tanks.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Bone-Inlaid Bracers|Embossed Ermine Girdle|Magdun Spaulders|Runeplate Helm}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
It's hard to tell from all the way over here exactly what's happening down there.  Did you manage to put those plague tanks to the torch?

==Completion==
Nice!

But what's this about the stuff you found inside those tanks? Are you saying that the Forsaken are spraying a plague upon the [[vrykul]] down there?

==Notes==
The [[Forsaken Plaguebringer (Howling Fjord)|Forsaken Plaguebringer]]s have a huge aggro radius and a nasty ranged attack. Get in melee range.
