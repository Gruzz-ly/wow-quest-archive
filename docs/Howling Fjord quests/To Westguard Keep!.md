== Objectives ==
Take the Dragonflayer Battle Plans to [[Captain Adams]] at [[Westguard Keep]] in the [[Howling Fjord]].
* [[Dragonflayer Battle Plans]] (provided)

== Description ==
<[[Vice Admiral Keller]] rolls up the battle plans.>

We've got all the information we need to keep [[Valgarde]] protected. You must take these battle plans to Westguard Keep, located on the western fjord cliff wall. Speak with the [[flight master]] assistant, [[Emilune Winterwind]]. She will put you on a the back of a gryphon headed towards Westguard.

Once there, find Captain Adams. He's the one in charge. Adams will know what to do with these plans.

== Progress ==
Valgarde has not fallen? That's a surprise.

Must be due to your help. It sure wasn't because of Keller.

== Completion ==
<Captain Adams takes the plans from you.>

I'm glad you decided to come over. My advisors and I will need some time to study these plans. In the meantime, we can use all the help we can get!
