This quest is part of the [[Fury of the Kvaldir quest chain]].

== Objectives ==
[["Silvermoon" Harry]] at [[Scalawag Point]] wants you to recover his Sin'dorei Scrying Crystal from the [[orca]], [["Scoodles"]].
* [[Sin'dorei Scrying Crystal]]

== Description ==
One of the first things [["Mad" Jonah Sterling|Jonah Sterling]] did after he went crazy was to take my prized sin'dorei scrying crystal and feed it to the bane of my existence, "Scoodles" the orca.

No I didn't name the damned thing. I just know that she swims out past the ships directly southeast of Scalawag. Kill that overinflated goldfish and rip out my beautiful [[Sin'Dorei|sin'dorei]] crystal from its stomach.

Do this and we can get down to business.

== Progress ==
Are you lost?

== Completion ==
<Harry takes the crystal from you and gently pats it.>

Oh my precious! Did the big, mean whale hurt you? It'll be okay. I'll never let you out of my sight again!

<Harry looks at you.>

So, where were we?
