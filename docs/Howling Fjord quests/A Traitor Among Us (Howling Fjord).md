== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Zeh'gehn]] at [[Scalawag Point]].

== Description ==
Our second in command, [[Annie Bonn]], has been acting rather paranoid as of late. She seems sure we have an infiltrator in our ranks, can ye believe it?

Anyhow, we have a foolproof way of uncovering rats around these parts. See, good ole' Zeh'gehn over here happens to be an authentic [[witch doctor]]. His family hails all the way from Zul... something or other.

Go let him know that we're in need of his divination skills. I must warn ye, <name>, only one or two of us can understand anything Zeh'gehn says.

== Completion ==
Ku here, mate. Ye come fe see I an' I, aye?
