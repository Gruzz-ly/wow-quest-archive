== Progress ==
I can't believe it was Dan. Did you take care of it yet?

== Completion ==
That's some sad news. Dan was me old friend... AND he owed me money. Either way, if he was working with the [[Southsea Freebooters|Southsea mongrels]] he got what he deserved.

As for you, my friend. You're on your way up. Literally.
