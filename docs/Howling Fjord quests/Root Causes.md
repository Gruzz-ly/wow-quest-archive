== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Dragonflayer Handlers and Skeld Drakeson. If you manage to do so, return to an [[Ember Clutch Ancient]] in the [[Ember Clutch]].
* [[Dragonflayer Handler]] slain (5)
* [[Skeld Drakeson]] slain

== Description ==
All things in nature seek a balance. It is only through the interference of those not in tune with that harmony that the balance is shifted.

You waste your efforts when you kill the [[whelp]]s and [[Proto-drake|drakes]]. The real culprits behind the expansion of these magically burning woods are the newly awakened [[vrykul]] and their master, Skeld Drakeson.

If it's blood on your hands that you seek, start with them. You will find their lair on the south side of the Ember Clutch.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose from one of these rewards
|Dark Iron Signet
|Flint-Reinforced Spaulders
|Cold-Iron Armbands
|Arcanum-Bound Bracers
}}

==Progress==
How fare your efforts against the meddlesome handlers, little one?

== Completion ==
Unfortunate that one predator must be used to put down another, but that is the natural order of things.

Perhaps now the proto-drakes and their whelps can go back to living peacefully. Somehow I doubt it with the reawakening of the vrykul.

== Notes ==
Skeld hits like a truck!
