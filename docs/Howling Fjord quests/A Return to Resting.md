This quest is part of the [[Fury of the Kvaldir quest chain]].

== Objectives ==
Use the [[Bundle of Vrykul Artifacts]] at the ransacked burial mounds of [[Shield Hill]] to return the Frozen Heart of Isuldof, the Shield of the Aesirites, the Staff of Storm's Fury and the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir.

Return to [[Orfus of Kamagua]] at the [[Ancient Lift]] should you succeed.
* [[The Shield of the Aesirites|Shield of the Aesirites]] Returned
* [[The Staff of Storm's Fury|Staff of Storm's Fury]] Returned
* [[The Frozen Heart of Isuldof|Frozen Heart of Isuldof]] Returned
* [[The Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir|Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir]] Returned
* [[Bundle of Vrykul Artifacts]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Orfus hands you a satchel.>

Within this satchel are the artifacts that you recovered. Locate the burial mounds of Shield Hill where the items were originally stolen from and return the artifacts. It is my hope that this gesture will quell the spirits that now haunt our hunting grounds.

Be strong, <name>...

== Progress ==
Is it done? Are the spirits at rest?

== Completion ==
Grim tidings, <name>. My people are in danger and must be warned. These sea faring aberrations will take no mercy upon [[the Kalu'ak]].

== Notes ==
As each item is returned, the corresponding revenant appears and attacks.  Defeating them is not necessary for the quest.
