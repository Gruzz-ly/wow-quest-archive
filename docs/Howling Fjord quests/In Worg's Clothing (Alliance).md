==Objectives==
[[Watcher Moonleaf]] has asked you to seek out and help [[Ulfang]] in the [[Rivenwood]].

If you somehow lose the Worg Disguise, return to Watcher Moonleaf for a replacement.
*[[Worg Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
From my dreams, I know that Ulfang is in a cave on the snowy northwestern edge of the Rivenwood.

He is in great danger!

I have devised a magical disguise that will make you appear as a worg while you are within the Rivenwood. The disguise is weak, relying upon the strange magics of that haunted wood. While it will only convince the worgs, it will allow you to get close to Ulfang.

Please, <class>, find and help him.

==Completion==
You look and smell different... you are not one of my pack. Tell me your story; I have nothing but time while I am trapped in here.

==Notes==
Follow the road north of [[Steel Gate]] until you reach the [[Grizzly Hills]]. Turn north-northeast immediately and put on your costume as soon as you get back into the Howling Fjord. Ulfang's in a cave at the foothills of the mountain.
