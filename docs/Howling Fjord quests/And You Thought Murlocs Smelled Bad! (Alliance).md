== Objectives ==
[[Explorer Jaren]] has asked you to kill 15 [[Scourge]] of any type along the [[Chillmere Coast]]. Return to him once you have done so.
* Chillmere Coast Scourge Killed: (15)

== Description ==
Originally I came down here to investigate some rumors about artifacts to be dug up. I knew that there were [[murloc]]s along the coast here, but I never in a million years thought I'd see this.

<The explorer pokes his head out to look around the tree.>

The Scourge are out there, and they're changing murlocs, and anything else they can get their hands on, into the walking dead!

<class>, I think it's our duty to do something about this. Think you could take out a good chunk of those Scourge?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
I don't know, <class>, it doesn't look like you've destroyed enough of them yet.

== Completion ==
<Jaren seems very excited about your success, but motions you to keep your conversation to a whisper.>

Great job, <name>! That's a lot of Scourge goo all over your stuff though. You might want to think about taking a quick dip in the strait. It's cold, but it'll get you cleaned up right quick.

== Notes ==
[[Necrotech]]s count, along with the more obvious choices of [[Mur'ghoul Corrupter]]s, [[Mur'ghoul Flesheater]]s and [[Servitor Shade]]s.
