This quest is part of the [[Fury of the Kvaldir quest chain]].

== Objectives ==
[[Orfus of Kamagua]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to deliver Orfus's Bundle to [[Elder Atuik]] at [[Kamagua]].
* [[Orfus' Bundle]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Orfus bundles up the clues you brought him.>

My people are bitterly entrenched in a war with the [[Northsea Freebooters]]. If any [[tuskarr]] could help us in our quest to right the wrongs of the pirates, it will be Elder Atuik of Kamagua. You must take these clues to him at once.

To get to Kamagua you must take the [[Ancient Lift]], behind me. Take the lift directly to Kamagua and find Elder Atuik.

== Progress ==
News from Orfus?

== Completion ==
Orfus is a good tuskarr - one of our strongest warriors. I knew he would not let us down.

Allow me to see what it is that you have brought.

== Notes ==
A [[wikipedia:gondola lift|gondola lift]] ride!
