This quest is an optional lead-in to the {{questchain|Fury of the Kvaldir}} quest chain.
== Objectives ==
Find [[Orfus of Kamagua]] at the [[Ancient Lift]] in [[Howling Fjord]].

== Description ==
Hail, traveler. I am [[Lunk-tusk]] of [[the Kalu'ak]]. We are known as [[tuskarr]] to your people. My partner and I were recently sent up to investigate strange happenings along one of our hunting trails. It was when we approached the graveyard known as [[Shield Hill]] that we were attacked by the undead. I was lucky to make it to this camp, but I am uncertain as to what became of Orfus.

We parted ways at the Ancient Lift, southeast of here along the cliff edge. Will you go see if he is ok?

== Completion ==
Lunk-tusk lives? At least there is some good news to be had on this day...

==Progression==
{{Fury of the Kvaldir}}
