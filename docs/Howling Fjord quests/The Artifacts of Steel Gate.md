== Objectives ==
[[Sage Mistwalker]] has asked you to collect 10 [[Steel Gate Artifact]]s. When you have all of them, return to him at [[Steel Gate]].
* [[Steel Gate Artifact]] (10)

== Description ==
I came out here for a different reason; an old friend of mine has been calling to me in my dreams. But now that I see these small things with their machines making a big hole in the ground, it makes my blood boil.

From what I can see, these [[dwarf|dwarves]], as they are known, are digging up artifacts; artifacts that could be important to our past.

I want you to go down there and get these things for me. Don't let any of those dwarves stand in your way. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Crackling Cloak
|Unsparing Band
|Worg-Fang Talisman}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
How many artifacts have you managed to gather from this Steel Gate?

== Completion ==
<The sage grunts his approval at your actions on his behalf.>

Perhaps I will be able to find the time soon to study these artifacts and come to an understanding of their significance.

But now there are more pressing matters to attend to.
