== Objectives ==
[[Thoralius the Wise]] wants you to search [[Nifflevar]] while you are in the spirit world and find information about the Secrets of Nifflevar.
* Secrets of Nifflevar Uncovered{{coords|69|55|Howling Fjord}}

== Description ==
All that we know of the [[vrykul]] indicates that they only recently appeared in [[Northrend]]. Why, then, are we seeing vrykul in visions that date back 15,000 years? Surely if the vrykul had previously existed in Northrend we would have known.

You must press on to Nifflevar. To get there you must go northeast, through [[Wyrmskull Village]], then take the path leading up through the dam. Nifflevar is on the bluffs of the fjord.

Use the incense burner once you arrive at Nifflevar and search the area for clues.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Blauvelt's Special Occasion Gloves|Nimblefinger Scaled Gloves|Antique Reinforced Legguards|Imperious Worghide Cap}}

You will also receive:
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

== Progress ==
What have you discovered?

== Completion ==
[[Human]] children born of vrykul? And [[King Ymiron|Ymiron]] ordered the deaths of all human born offspring?

<Thoralius goes silent for a moment.>

As much as I wish to deny what is so plainly presented to me, I cannot. There is no extinct "missing link" to humans as the [[Explorers' League]] proposed. The vrykul are the missing link. They are the progenitors of humanity.

== Notes ==

Around {{coords|69|55|Howling Fjord}}, a large crowd of [[Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|Ancient Citizens of Nifflevar]] are gathered in front of [[King Ymiron]], who is standing alone on an upper bluff. The citizens periodically say one of the following:
*{{text|say|Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|Vrykul must remain pure!}}
*{{text|say|Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|Show the aberrations no mercy, Ymiron!}}
*{{text|say|Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|Show them mercy, my king! They are of our flesh and blood!}}
*{{text|say|Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|They weaken us! Our strength is dilluted by their very existence! Destroy them all!}}
*{{text|say|Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|All hail our glorious king, Ymiron!}}
*{{text|say|Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|Let him speak! Be silent!}}

Get closer to Ymiron to start his speech.
:{{text|bossemote|King Ymiron motions for silence.}}
*{{text|say|Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|The king is going to speak!}}
*{{text|say|Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|Shhh!}}
*{{text|say|Ancient Citizen of Nifflevar|Silence!}}
:{{text|yell|King Ymiron|Vrykul, your king implores you to listen!}}
:{{text|yell|King Ymiron|The gods have abandoned us!}}
:{{text|emote|The crowd gasps in horror.}}
:{{text|yell|King Ymiron|Even now, in our darkest hour, they mock us!}}
:{{text|yell|King Ymiron|Where are the [[titan]]s in our time of greatest need? Our women birth abberations{{Sic}} - disfigured runts unable to even stand on their own! Weak and ugly... Useless...}}
:{{text|yell|King Ymiron|Ymiron has toiled. Long have I sat upon my throne and thought hard of our plight. There is only one answer... one reason...}}
:{{text|yell|King Ymiron|For who but the titans themselves could bestow such a curse? What could have such power?}}
:{{text|yell|King Ymiron|And the answer is nothing... For it is the titans that have cursed us!}}
:{{text|emote|The crowd clamours.}}
:{{text|yell|King Ymiron|On this day all Vrykul will shed their old beliefs! We denounce our old gods! All Vrykul will pledge their allegiance to Ymiron! Ymiron will protect our noble race!}}
:{{text|emote|The crowd cheers.}}
:{{text|yell|King Ymiron|And now my first decree upon the Vrykul! All malformed infants born of Vrykul mother and father are to be destroyed upon birth! Our blood must remain pure always! Those found in violation of Ymiron's decree will be taken to [[Gjalerbron]] for execution!}}
