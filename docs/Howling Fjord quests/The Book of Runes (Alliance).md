== Objectives ==
[[Prospector Belvar]] at [[Fort Wildervar]] wants you to bring him The Book of Runes.
* [[The Book of Runes]]

== Description ==
The vast rocky area to the southeast, [[Giants' Run]], has been overrun by [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves]]. Scouts have reported seeing the dwarves coaxing stone giants from the ground, then carving runes on them.

I can't fathom their motives, but I suspect they're somehow trying to turn the giants into weapons. The [[Iron Rune Stonecaller|iron rune stonecallers]] and [[Iron Rune Binder|binders]] carry large tomes with them, which must contain the runes they're carving on the giants.

Capture the pieces of this book, assemble them, and bring it back to me, <name>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Have you recovered the book?

== Completion ==
<Prospector Belvar browses the book of runes.>

Hmm... there's so much here. I'm going to need some time to study it, and if we hope to understand these runes, we'll need to try to make our own.

== Notes ==
Kill Stonecallers and Binders. Collect the three chapters and combine them. Keep an eye out for the pathing 70 elites!
