== Objectives ==
[[Guard Captain Zorek]] wants you to take the Harpoon Control Mechanism to [[Lieutenant Icehammer]] stationed outside of Nifflevar.
* [[Harpoon Control Mechanism]] (provided)

== Description ==
Do you see those [[vrykul]] buildings on the bluffs to the northeast? The vrykul call that place [[Nifflevar]]. It's where most of their harpoon attacks on our [[frigate]]s originate.

Well guess what? The time for payback has come, <name>. I need you to take this harpoon control mechanism and meet up with Lieutenant Icehammer, who is hiding out in a vrykul building northwest of Nifflevar.

When you're ready, I'll place you on the back of one of our [[gryphon]]s and zip you right to him!

== Progress ==
What is this? Do I look like a babysitter?

== Completion ==
<Lieutenant Icehammer takes the harpoon control mechanism from you.>

Ah, you come bearing gifts!

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest puts players on the back of a two-seater gryphon, on a path that is designed to show players the route back to Valgarde from Nifflevar, via the dam interior.
