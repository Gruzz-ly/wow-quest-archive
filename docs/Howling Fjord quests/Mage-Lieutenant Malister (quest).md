== Objectives ==
[[Captain Adams]] has asked you to speak with his advisor, [[Mage-Lieutenant Malister]], at [[Westguard Keep]].

== Description ==
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! Those [[Proto-Drake|proto-drakes]] are attacking the keep!

Beasts such as that should have been scared off when you took care of their clutches and whelps.

You did take care of them, right?

<Name>, this calls for more direct action. Speak with my advisor, Mage-Lieutenant Malister. He'll provide you with the means to get at those infernal creatures.

== Completion ==
<Malister beckons you closer and speaks in whispered tones.>

I was worried that something like this might happen. I tried to dissuade the captain from this course of action, but he is a [[dwarf]] of action with a definite outlook on how things should proceed.

Let us speak of the options left to us.
