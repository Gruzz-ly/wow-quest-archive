== Objectives ==
[[Glorenfeld]] at the [[Utgarde Catacombs]] wants you to collect 10 Wyrmskull Tablets.
* [[Wyrmskull Tablet]]: (10)

== Description ==
They're keepin' [[Daegarn]] locked up in a cage at the large fightin' ring nearby. From what I've gathered, the [[Dragonflayer clan|Dragonflayers]] bring out their prisoners to battle against the most powerful gladiators. They dump the losers in the basement where [[Scourge]] [[necromancer]]s turn 'em into [[ghoul]]ies! It's horrifying!

But first things first! The tablets are strewn all across this dungeon. Let's get those recovered before you go off tryin' to be a hero.

== Progress ==
Check every nook and cranny!

== Completion ==
You've done well, mate. Now that we've secured the tablets we can try and save Daegarn's life and recover the cipher that will help us decode the meaning behind these ancient relics!

I'll hold on to these tablets, you rescue Daegarn.
