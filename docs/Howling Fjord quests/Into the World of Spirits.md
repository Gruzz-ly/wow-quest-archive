== Objectives ==
[[Thoralius the Wise]] at [[Valgarde]] wants you to find his Reagent Pouch.
* [[Reagent Pouch]]

== Description ==
While the [[Explorers' League]] may discern bits and pieces of the past through their archaeological findings and the [[Vice Admiral Keller|Vice Admiral]] might extract some knowledge of the present through brute force, the truth lies with the spirits.

With the proper reagents I am able to see into the spirit world. It is there that the past, present and future of [[Northrend]] resides.

If you wish to learn more, I will require my reagent pouch. It was lost in a ship that is now at the bottom of [[Daggercap Bay]], just east of here.

== Progress ==
Have you found my reagent pouch?

== Completion ==
A bit worse for the wear but still functional.

<Thoralius reaches into the pouch and removes some odd looking roots.>

Now to place them in the fire and inhale!

<Thoralius throws the roots into the smoldering incense burner.>

<Thoralius inhales deeply. His body begins to quiver.>

Wha... What... It cannot be... I cannot...
