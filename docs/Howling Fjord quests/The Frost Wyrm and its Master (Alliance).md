Suggested Players [2]

== Description ==
You were right to bring this to me, <name>. You must take help back north with you to [[Gjalerbron]] and slay that [[frost wyrm|wyrm]] and its master, [[Wyrmcaller Vile]]!

Even now, as we speak here, the frost wyrm may be on its way.

However, if I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of [[Gjalerbron]], will call [[Glacion]] back. When the creature lands, destroy it!

And <name>, please bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Earthwell Footwraps|Magispike Helm|Silversteel Gauntlets|Lost Vrykul Signet}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10}}

== Progress ==
Is the attack averted? Are the frost wyrm and its master destroyed?

Did you retrieve the horn?

== Completion ==
Wow, that horn is cold!

Once again you've saved [[Westguard Keep]] from certain doom. What a curious <man/woman> you are, <name>. If only there were more of you.

Well, this certainly calls for a reward. Which do you prefer?

== Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*25400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|9}} at level 80)
*350 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

== Notes ==
Aggro [[Wyrmcaller Vile]] and kill him to loot the horn. Heal up. Use the horn to call down [[Glacion]].
