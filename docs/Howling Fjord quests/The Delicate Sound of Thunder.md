== Objectives ==
[[Walt]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to use the [[Iron Rune Construct]] to explore the thundering cave at [[Baelgun's Excavation Site]].

Dismiss your construct by dismissing it from the pet window once you have completed the quest.
* Thundering Cave Investigated

== Description ==
The cavern that we opened at Baelgun's was the one place that most steered clear of... Can't say I blame 'em. The sound of thunder shot out of that cave, <name>! Loud, booming thunder!

I think near the end, it was abandoned by all. Bad, bad things happened to any that went in to explore - most never coming back.

I want you to check that cave out while you're at Baelgun's. Explore around the titan statue inside and report back with your findings.

== Rewards ==

== Progress ==
Any luck?

== Completion ==
Incredible! What could those iron menaces be up to? What are they doing in the [[Storm Peaks]]? And what is this [[Loken]]!? I'll forward this information to our central base of operations in the [[Dragonblight]], <name>. I'll also let 'em know that you were invaluable in the acquisition of said info.

== Notes ==
