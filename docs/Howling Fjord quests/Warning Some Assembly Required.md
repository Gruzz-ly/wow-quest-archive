==Objectives==
Use the Abomination Assembly Kit in [[Halgrind]] and round up plagued [[Vrykul]] with your [[Mindless Abomination]]. Slay at least 20 and return to [["Hacksaw" Jenny]] in [[New Agamand]] when you're done.
* Plagued Vrykul Exterminated (20)
* [[Abomination Assembly Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, here you are! Our friend's going to be somewhat... unstable. So I suggest not putting him together until reaching [[Halgrind]].

Once you're there, use the abomination to round up as many vrykul as you can before self-destructing.

Come back with whatever's left once you're done. I can always use more body parts! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flexible Leather Footwraps
|Fire-Purifying Tunic
|Inescapable Girdle
|Light-Bound Chestguard
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|8|80}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Horde Expedition]]

==Progress==
Are you done with the cleanup in Halgrind?

==Completion==
Great job, <name>. Say, you wouldn't be looking for something more... permanent, would ya? I could sure use some help around these parts!

==Progression==
