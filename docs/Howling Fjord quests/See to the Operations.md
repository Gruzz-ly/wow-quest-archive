== Objectives ==
Explorer [[Overseer Irena Stonemantle|Irena Stonemantle]] has asked you to speak with a [[Steel Gate Chief Archaeologist]] at [[Steel Gate]]. 

== Description ==
Our work out here is really just beginning. But now that we've brought these [[flying machine]]s in from [[Westguard Keep]], it should really pick up.

The problem is that we're lacking enough qualified pilots. And with things getting worse in the [[Rivenwood]] to the north, I'd like to get things wrapped up here quickly and then head back home.

If you can lend a hand, go have a chat with one of my chief archaeologists. You'll find them next to the flying machines on the north and south sides of the site. 

== Completion ==
Irena sent you over, did she? Good, we've got work for you then!
