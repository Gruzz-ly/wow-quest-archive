==Objectives==
Speak to [[Bat Handler Camille]] and take a riding [[bat]] to intercept the [[Alliance]] reinforcements. Once above their [[fleet]], use the Plague Vials to infect 16 North Fleet reservists.
* [[North Fleet Reservist]] Infected (16)
*[[Plague Vials]] (provided)

==Description==
We've just received word of reinforcements coming to the aid of the Alliance forces. Their timing couldn't be better!

We're in sore need of test subjects and these [[North Fleet]] reservists will do nicely!

Take these plague vials with you and speak to Camille, the Bat Handler. Tell her you need to commandeer a riding bat for a special assignment for us.

Once you're at sea, drop the vials on the reinforcement fleet. I can't wait to see the results! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Frost-Trimmed Gauntlets

|Runed Clamshell Choker}}
You will also receive:

*12000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
You're back!

==Completion==
Hmmphh.... the reports from the field are.... not encouraging!

==Notes==
Turn around and speak to Bat Handler Camille:
:{{Gossip|I need a riding bat to intercept the Alliance reinforcements.}}
:''The player character is mounted on a bat and flown through the [[Frozen Sea]] above the three ships.''

Once the objective is met, the bat transports the character back.
