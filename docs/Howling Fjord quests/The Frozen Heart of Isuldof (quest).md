== Objectives ==
Recover the Frozen Heart of Isuldof and deliver it to [[Orfus of Kamagua]] in the [[Howling Fjord]].
* [[The Frozen Heart of Isuldof]]

== Description ==
Some say [["Mad" Jonah Sterling|Jonah]] was never quite right in the head, but I know the truth. It was the heart. That damned frozen heart! I saw the change in him the second he pulled it from the grave. I could see the blood freeze in his veins... It was then that the madness truly took over.

He left us to hole up in his cave on the north side of this island. Last I heard he had thrown the heart in the back of his bear den. Too little, too late...

I'll kill you myself if you even think about bringing that heart back here!

== Progress ==
The... The Frozen Heart of Isuldof?

== Completion ==
We must return all of the artifacts, <name>. When all four are gathered, you will put them back in their graves.

== Notes ==
Northeast corner of the island, head inside the cave. Up top of the bear den behind [[Hozzer]], the big white bear.

==Progression==
