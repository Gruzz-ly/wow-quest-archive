==Objectives==
Locate Steelfeather circling [[Fort Wildervar]] and use the Feathered Charm to discover his secret. Report your findings to [[Gil Grisert]].
* Learn [[Steelfeather]]'s [[Spotted Hippogryph Hatchling|Secret]]
* [[Feathered Charm]] (provided)

==Description==
We see one brave [[hippogryph]] circling over the fort, then swooping down and taking prey. [[Trapper Jethan|Jethan]] over there has taken a couple of shots at the creature, but his arrows bounced right off!

We've taken to calling this remarkable creature Steelfeather, but we can't see why he prefers the area around Fort Wildervar. Most hippogryphs are wary of people.

[[Researcher Aderan]] has helped us fashion a charm from one of the creature's feathers. He claims it will allow the user to see through Steelfeather's eyes.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|40}}

==Progress==
Did Aderan's charm work?

==Completion==
[[File:Steelfeather Nest.jpg|thumb|Tending to hatchlings.]]
You saw a nest, with hatchlings? Hmm... so our "he" is actually a "she," eh?

I guess that settles it. I suppose I wouldn't want to move a nest full of hatchlings just because of a new neighbor, either.

<Gil favors Trapper Jethan with a mock glare.>

I'm sure we'd get along just fine if ol' Jethan would stop trying to make a trophy of her.

==Notes==
Look up, find the hippogryph, use the item, watch the show.

:{{text|say|Gil Grisert|Y'hear that, Jethan? You're not getting that Steelfeather trophy now that we know she's a mother.}}
:{{text|say|Trapper Jethan|Why not? Just think how much better it'll look with the hatchlings to either side --}}
:{{text|say|Gil Grisert|Jethan!}}
:{{text|say|Trapper Jethan|What? I'm just sayin' that's how we do things in [[Grizzly Hills]].}}
