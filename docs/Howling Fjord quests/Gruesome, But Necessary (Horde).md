==Objectives==
The [[Winterhoof Brave]] has asked you to use The Brave's Machete to dismember 20 [[Vrykul]] of the [[Winterskorn]] tribe at [[Skorn]].

*Winterskorn Vrykul Dismembered (20)
*[[The Brave's Machete]] (provided)

==Description==
Our elders say that these vrykul may be able to rise from the dead; not unlike the walking dead you call the Scourge, but a different kind of undeath.

We should not take any chances.

Here, take my machete. As we move through this place, carve up the remains of the vrykul that we slay.

I spent the morning sharpening it, so it should cleave even through their thick bones. 

==Completion==
Have you done that before? Your skill with my machete seemed practiced.

<The brave looks at you warily.>

I'll take it back from you now, <class>.

==Rewards==
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40}} at level 80)
*250 reputation with [[The Taunka]]

==Progression==
{{Skorn must Fall!}}
