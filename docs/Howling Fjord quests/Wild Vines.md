== Objectives ==
[[Lurielle]] at [[the Frozen Glade]] wants you to kill 8 Scarlet Ivy.
* [[Scarlet Ivy]] slain (8)

== Description ==
The sisters who lived in the [[Vibrant Glade]], to the southwest, used to tend to gorgeous beds of scarlet ivy, but the same force that has driven them mad has transformed their beloved ivy.

The vines now grasp at the feet of the unwary, or lash at any who approach the glade. Before we can reclaim the glade, the vines must be tamed and uprooted.

Clear as much of the ivy as you are able. It has already begun to grow out of control.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Have you returned from the Vibrant Glade?

== Completion ==
Thank you for your help, <name>. The Vibrant Glade was once a beautiful place, and when we return to it, we shall make it so again.
