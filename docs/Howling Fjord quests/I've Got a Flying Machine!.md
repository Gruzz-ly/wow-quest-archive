==Objectives==
The [[Steel Gate Chief Archaeologist]] wants you to transport 3 Sacks of Relics from the bottom of the site and take them to the platform on the north or south side of [[Steel Gate]].

Use the grappling hook on the [[Steel Gate Flying Machine|flying machine]] to do this.

Report back to him after you've done so.
* [[Sack of Relics]] Delivered (3)

==Description==
Well, what are you waiting for, there's work to be done!

Here's the keys to our flying machine. Grab three sacks of relics and haul them up to the crane platforms on the north and south sides of Steel Gate. I'll mark them for you.

Hurry up! We haven't got all day!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Crackling Cloak
|Unsparing Band
|Worg-Fang Talisman}}
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|q=5|Super Healing Potion}}
* and  {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Eh, You finished with all of that hauling?

==Completion==
Good job, though I think ye might be wanting a refresher course in basic piloting.

Well, no matter, one warm body's as good as another. Here's yer haul for the day.

==Notes==
* The flying machine is fully capable of strafing and moving vertically (fly up with the button assigned to jump, and down with the button assigned to sit.) It does however, have a turning radius if you turn on the move. (Not a very large one, however.)
* As of 4/25/09, the quest is bugged in that replacement bags will over time become unable to be picked up by the grapple hook. Bugged bags seem to sit above the ground they should have spawned on. The only real soloution which is reliable as of this time is to wait until a server reset to perform the quest. Thankfully, the Daily quest has no such bugs.
* This quest may be a reference to ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness|Warcraft II]]''. Upon creating a new [[Gnomish Flying Machine (Warcraft II)|Gnomish Flying Machine]], the pilot would say, 'I've got a Flying Machine!'.
