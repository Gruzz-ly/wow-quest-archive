==Objectives==
[[Handsome Terry]] at [[Scalawag Point]] wants you to bring him 1 Amani Vase and 1 Eagle Figurine from the shipwreck to the south.
* [[Amani Vase]]
* [[Eagle Figurine]]
* [[Fish Bladder]] (provided)

==Description==
I've made my fortune by specializing in treasure that regular pirates don't appreciate: art, antiquities, collector's pieces.

[[Black Conrad's Ghost|Black Conrad]]'s fleet sank south of here years ago. All the gold and jewelry was picked clean by divers, but two ancient relics remain there. One is a museum-quality [[Amani Empire|Amani]] vase, the other is an eagle figurine.

Go and retrieve them for me and I'll vouch for you with the other pirates. I'll even throw in something to make your underwater adventure a bit more manageable. 

==Progress==
Did you obtain my relics, <name>?  Nobody gets by in this life on good looks alone... not even me!

==Completion==
We're going to go places together, <name>.  With my good looks and your... can-do attitude, we're sure to make a killing.

==Notes==
''Use'' the [[Fish Bladder]] he provides you.
