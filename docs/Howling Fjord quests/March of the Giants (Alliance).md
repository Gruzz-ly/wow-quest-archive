==Objectives==
[[Researcher Aderan]] at [[Fort Wildervar]] wants you to use the [[Runeseeking Pick]] on the corpses of 4 Runed Stone Giants.
* [[Runed Stone Giant]] Corpse Analyzed: (4)
* Suggested Players [2]
* [[Runeseeking Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
To the east, at [[Giants' Run]], rune-inscribed [[stone giant]]s have started to migrate north toward [[Frostblade Peak]]. What their ultimate destination is, I do not know.

The glowing runes inscribed in the stone flesh of the giants guide them on their journey.

Use this pick to deactivate the runes on the giants' corpses and return with your findings.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
<Researcher Aderan listens to your findings.>

The runes for "north" and "west" appeared multiple times? There's a highly reinforced command to move in that direction, but the runes are more than propulsion. Something is attracting them, but what?

==Notes==
Giants are soloable only with high DPS or good kiting. However, by using the companion stone giant elemental from 'The Rune of Command', kiting is a whole lot easier. The elemental has a 4 second stun with a short CD, hits hard and with proper threat management, can tank the giant while you heal up. Beware of the giants that have a shadow buff. Their DPS is significantly higher.

Megalith spawns to north-east of the base and killing him can be way easier than facing the other giants as he does not have the stacking [[Damage over time|Dot]] that the others have. He also have a pretty fast respawn time which makes the quest easy for soloing. Note that you'll have to kill him 5 times to complete the chain, so if he takes too much out of you, bring a friend along and kill the regular giants.
