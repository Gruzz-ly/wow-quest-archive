This [[breadcrumb quest]] leads the player to discover a Scourge plot to bolster the ranks of its army with murlocs.  Both the Horde and the Alliance have this questline, but the Horde version has no introduction.

== Objectives ==
[[Overseer Irena Stonemantle]] has asked you to locate her fiance, [[Explorer Jaren]].

== Description ==
<name>, my betrothed, Jaren, went west with a small group of explorers to check into rumors of artifacts on the [[Chillmere Coast]]. But there are [[murloc]] down there, and I fear the worst has befallen them.

Surely you have time to see if they're alright? There's a way down to the beach just to the southwest, though watch out for the [[worg]]s and other things lurking in the woods.

== Completion ==
<The explorer beams a smile as you tell him who sent you. He continues in hushed tones.>

Irena was concerned about me? She gets that from [[Old Man Stonemantle|her father]] you know.

==Progression==
{{And You Thought Murlocs Smelled Bad! (Alliance)}}
