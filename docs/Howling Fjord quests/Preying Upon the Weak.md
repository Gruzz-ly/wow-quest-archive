== Objectives ==
[[Trapper Jethan]] at [[Fort Wildervar]] wants you to bring him 8 pieces of Trapped Prey.
* [[Trapped Prey]]: (8)

== Description ==
Glad to meet you. I've come here from the [[Grizzly Hills]] to do business with your cohorts. My people maintain a large outpost there, and you'd do well to visit it when you head north.

I've set up traps in the woodlands and snowy areas around here. With the meat and the furs from the creatures they capture, I'll have plenty to barter with the townspeople.

I can offer you a share of my profits if you're willing to help gather prey from the traps. Beware though, you won't be the only predator out there.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Fizznik's Patented Earwarmer|Earth-Infused Leggings|Master Artilleryman Boots|Arcanum Shield}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|40}}

== Progress ==
I hope you haven't returned empty-handed. I thought we had a deal.

== Completion ==
<Trapper Jethan inspects the creatures you've brought him.>

Nicely done. Some of these will fetch a better price than others, but I should have plenty to trade with the locals.

== Notes ==
Traps will often spawn [[Prowling Worg]]s which occasionally drop Trapped Prey.

Event after turn-in:
:<font color="#FFFF9F">Trapper Jethan says: Hey, [[Gil Grisert|Gil]], you give my offer any more thought? I'll have plenty of skins and preserved meat to trade for those heavy yeti furs or down your men are working with.
:Gil Grisert says: Much as I'd like to do business with you, Jethan, all this stuff is property of the [[Alliance]] expeditionary forces.
:Gil Grisert says: Maybe after everything dies down, you and I can make a deal with some of the surplus. I'm sure the troops will give your people plenty of business as they head into the Grizzly Hills.
:Trader Jethan says: I'll be lookin' forward to it. Guess I'll get to preserving this meat, then. A good quartermaster won't turn down a reliable supply of rations.</font>
