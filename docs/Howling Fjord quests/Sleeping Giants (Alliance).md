==Objectives==
Mage-Lieutenant Malister has tasked you with slaying 5 Dormant Vrykul. Return to him at Westguard Keep when you have done so.
*[[Dormant Vrykul]] slain (5)

==Description==
I've overheard what you've had to say with Father Levariol. Allow me to suggest that he's not having you go far enough.

You must also deal with the vrykul that lie dormant in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron!

I have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the necrolords have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely.

Surely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
<Name>, I find it implausible that you have dealt with enough of the dormant vrykul. Come back when you have done so.

==Completion==
You did what had to be done. Though some might consider it dishonorable to slay the helpless, in this case you would have been a fool to have done otherwise.

And we certainly couldn't have just left them stand there to be ritually wakened, now could we?

It was a brave thing you did for all of us in those catacombs, <name>.

==Notes==
Kill [[Necrolord (occupation)|Necrolords]] to get the items to use.

==Progression==
{{Stop the Ascension! (Alliance)}}
