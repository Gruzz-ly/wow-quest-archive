== Objectives ==
[[Taruk]] at [[Scalawag Point]] wants you to collect [["Silvermoon" Harry]]'s Debt.
* [["Silvermoon" Harry's Debt]]

== Description ==
I heard you did a little work for [[Handsome Terry|Terry]].  I was hoping someone reliable would show up around these parts.

See, pirates love to gamble.  They, however, do not love to pay their gambling debt.

If you're interested in collecting some coin on my behalf, I'd be willing to give you a cut.

Let's start you out with an easy one. "Silvermoon" Harry's a bit of an eccentric, keeps all sorts of expensive [[blood elf]] knickknacks inside his tent - yet when I see him he always pretends to be broke. Get my gold.

== Progress ==
You're back. Did you get what's owed to me?

== Completion ==
A job well done. Here's your cut, <name>. There's more where this came from.

There's no shortage of deadbeat pirates on this island.

== Notes ==
You will aggro Harry by choosing the gossip option "Taruk sent me to collect what you owe." He's a fire mage.
:"Silvermoon" Harry says: Do not test me, scurvy dog! I'm trained in the way of [[Blood Knight]]s!
Get him below 50% and he'll say: "I'll pay! I'll pay! Eeeek! Please don't hurt me!". Choose the gossip option
