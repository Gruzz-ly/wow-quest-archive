== Objectives ==
Search the [[Utgarde Catacombs]] for [[Glorenfeld]].

== Description ==
There's no sign of the cipher on [[Zedd]]. After carefully searching the area you discover some writing in the dirt:

"Glor and Dae inside catacombs. Have cipher and tablets."

Perhaps you should head to the catacombs located north of here and search for [[Glorenfeld]] and [[Daegarn]]. The bridge crossing the worg pit will lead you right to the tunnel leading down into the catacombs.

== Completion ==
About bloody time! [[Pulroy the Archaeologist|Pulroy]] and Zedd are dead.

And Daegarn...

<Glorenfeld shakes his head.>

Taken by the [[Dragonflayer]] chieftain into the depths of these catacombs. I overhead that oversized mongrel mention something 'bout a sacrifice to the "Dread King."

The cipher is hidden away in Daegarn's grimy beard.

What? Dwarves hide things in their beards all the time!

==Notes==
This quest may be a reference to "And Then There Was Silence", a song of the power-metal group Blind Guardian [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Guardian] or, more probably, a reference to "...And Then There Were Three...", the ninth album of the Genesis [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And_Then_There_Were_Three...].
It could also be a reference to Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Soldier-Boys", where the nursery rhyme with the same name plays a significant part in the killer's methods of killing his victims.
