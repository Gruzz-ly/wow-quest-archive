==Objectives==
Deliver the Gjalerbron Attack Plans to [[Mage-Lieutenant Malister]] at [[Westguard Keep]]. 
* [[Gjalerbron Attack Plans]] (provided)

==Description==
These plans detail an imminent attack upon Westguard Keep. It would appear that the [[frost wyrm]], [[Glacion]], who circles overhead is to be used for the offensive.

Surely Mage-Lieutenant Malister would be of some assistance in this matter. Deliver the plans to him at the keep to the south. 

==Progress==
What?! Plans for an attack upon the keep?

A FROST WYRM?!!!

==Completion==
<name>, we can't let this come to pass!

==Notes==
The plans drop from any Gjalerbron vrykul.
