== Objectives ==
Destroy 15 Proto-Drake Eggs and 15 Proto-Whelps, and then return to [[Captain Adams]] at [[Westguard Keep]].
* [[Proto-Drake Egg]] destroyed: (15)
* [[Proto-Whelp]] slain: (15)

== Description ==
<Name>, I don't trust anyone but you to take care of this.  I need the proto-drake eggs and proto-whelps in the burning forest to the southeast destroyed!

Since we arrived here, the [[Ember Clutch]] has been ablaze; there must be some sort of perverse magic at work. And lately it seems to be growing. My men tell me that if we don't do something quickly, we'll be surrounded on all sides by the fire within a few weeks' time!

Get down there and eliminate the threat by destroying those eggs and the proto-whelps.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
How go your efforts?

== Completion ==
Good work! With any luck at all, the destruction of their egg clutches and whelps should drive off those fiery beasts and prevent that magical blaze from spreading.

Wait... what's that sound? It sounds like the beating of wings.
