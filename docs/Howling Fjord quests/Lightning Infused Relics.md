== Objectives ==
[[Walt]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to use the [[Iron Rune Construct]]'s Collect Data ability to collect 15 sets of Iron Rune Data.

Dismiss your construct by dismissing it from the pet window once you have completed the quest.
* Iron Rune Data Collected (15)

== Description ==
Your construct is ready to go. All abilities have been given a once over and I've programmed the machine to both comprehend and speak the [[Titan (language)|language of the titans]].

Take the construct to [[Baelgun's Excavation Site]], due south of here, and collect data from the lightning infused relics that litter the site. Remember to bluff any iron dwarves that suspect your construct to be a fake. And don't forget about rocket jumping from rune to rune to get around in there!

Get on the table when you're ready!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Shock-Resistant Hood|Banded Chain Gloves|Munificent Legguards}}
You will also receive: {{cost|14|10}}

== Progress ==
Progress?

== Completion ==
And once again Walt proves that he is indeed the top dwarf! What do you think of my construct now, [[Lebronski]]!

Thank you, <name>. This data will undoubtedly prove to be invaluable - as soon as I figure out how to get it out of the construct.

== Notes ==
Avoid combat at all costs. Some of the Bluffs used by the construct to achieve this are:
<div class="text-say">
* Alert! Alert! Construct senses that enemies have breeched our defenses. Increase pace.
* Construct must not be questioned by iron dwarf servant. Commence deconstruction.
* Construct class carrier reporting for duty. Primary function: Overseeing.
* To interfere with construct's function results in termination. Move along.
* Construct is not authorized to communicate with lesser beings. Being must double their efforts.
* Did you lose your wallet? Construct has found wallet with overabundance of currency.
