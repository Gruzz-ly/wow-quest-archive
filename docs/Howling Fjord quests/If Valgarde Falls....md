== Objectives ==
[[Vice Admiral Keller]] at [[Valgarde|Valgarde Port]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to slay 12 [[Dragonflayer Invader]]s or [[Dragonflayer Worg]]s.
* Dragonflayer Invader slain: (12)

== Description ==
If Valgarde falls, our primary supply line into [[Northrend]] will cease to exist. From there it'll only be a matter of time before we're all servants of the [[Lich King]]. Now I don't know about you, but I've got a wife and three kids back in [[Elwynn Forest|Elwynn]] and I'll be damned if I'll go down without a fight.

The situation here is critical and we can use all the manpower you're able to muster. Get to the front gate and help the guards defend the city against the invading monsters!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
The fate of the world may very well rest with us.

== Completion ==
You gave our defenders the extra support they needed, <name>. Morale is higher than ever now, thanks to you. I'll think they'll be able to hander the remaining onslaught on their own. I've got bigger plans for you...
