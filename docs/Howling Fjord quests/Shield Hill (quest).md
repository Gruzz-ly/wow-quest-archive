== Objectives ==
"Hacksaw" Jenny wants you to bring her 5 Ancient Vrykul Bones from the reanimated Vrykul in Shield Hill, south of New Agamand.
* [[Ancient Vrykul Bone]] (5)

== Description ==
My work should be extremely easy in a time of war. There ought to be usable body parts everywhere.

It's not that simple, though. With these eggheads making all sorts of killer plagues and sending them to enemy towns, most of the material gets contaminated.

There is a place, though, where usable samples exist. Shield Hill, south of here, is an ancient vrykul burial ground where the dead walk but are not afflicted with any plague - ours or the Lich King's. Get me some bones, I'll pay ya well. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Coldstone-Inlaid Waistguard
|Flamebinder Handwraps
|Purestrike Bracers
|Emeraldscale Pauldrons}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|40}}

== Progress ==
Got my bones then?

== Completion ==
Hmmmmph... these will do for now. There seems to be some oddness to them.

I tell ya - I've handled body parts for years now and never have I had such a weird feeling in my stomach. Anyway, a deal is a deal. Here's your payment.
