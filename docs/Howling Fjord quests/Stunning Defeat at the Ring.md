== Objectives ==
Defeat the gladiators at the [[Ring of Judgement]] and face [[Oluf the Violent]]. Defeat Oluf and recover the Ancient Cipher.

Return the Ancient Cipher to [[Glorenfeld]] at the entrance to the [[Utgarde Catacombs]].

* [[Ancient Cipher]]

== Description ==
Oluf will come out if you defeat the other gladiators. That's 'bout the only way we're getting' that cipher back. Put on your whompin' boots and get busy in the Ring of Judgment. If you do manage to get the cipher back, return it to Glorenfeld o'er near the entrance to these catacombs.

Me? Don't worry about me! We're on the bring of discovering the missing link to human-kind!

== Progress ==
Daegarn? The cipher?

== Completion ==
Fascinating tale! Something is actually judgin' these things? To what end?! For what purpose?

Well, never mind that nonsense. Someone else can figure out that stuff. We got the cipher and the tablets back - and only two fatalities in the whole ordeal.
