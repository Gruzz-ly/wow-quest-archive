This is one of two quests given out of [[Ghostblade Post]], the other being [[The Enemy's Legacy]]. Both can be completed in a single assault on [[Nifflevar]].

==Objectives==
[[Ranger Captain Areiel]] wants you to go to [[Nifflevar]] and slay 5 Dragonflayer Warriors, 4 Dragonflayer Rune-Seers and 4 Dragonflayer Hunting Hounds.
*[[Dragonflayer Warrior]] slain (5)
*[[Dragonflayer Rune-Seer]] slain (4)
*[[Dragonflayer Hunting Hound]] slain (4)

==Description==
We await reinforcements from [[Vengeance Landing]] to move against Nifflevar. If we were to capture it earlier, though, it would provide us with a great advantage over the [[Alliance]].

Head into town and see if you can put a dent in their numbers. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
Hail, <name>.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>.  When our forces from Vengeance Landing arrive, we'll be able to take care of any vrykul that are left.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
