== Objectives ==
[[Lieutenant Icehammer]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to destroy the Dragonflayer Longhouse, Dragonflayer Dockhouse, Dragonslayer Storage Facility and 8 Dragonflayer Defenders.

Return the Harpoon Control Mechanism to him once the task is complete.
* [[Dragonflayer Defender]] slain: (8)
* Dragonflayer Longhouse Destroyed
* Dragonflayer Dockhouse Destroyed
* Dragonflayer Storage Facility Destroyed
* [[Harpoon Control Mechanism]] (provided)

== Description ==
We must strike while the [[vrykul]] forces are in disarray! Take the harpoon control mechanism to [[Nifflevar]] and locate the northernmost harpoon building on the bluff side of the village.

Once there, commandeer one of the vrykul harpoon guns that are stationed on the building's deck. Use the harpoon gun to rain hell on [[Wyrmskull Village]]! Destroy the longhouse, dockhouse, storage facility and any defenders that the vrykul may send at you!

Do this and [[Daggercap Bay]] will become a much safer port!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Frost-Trimmed Gauntlets|Azure Chain Hauberk|Ramshorn-Inlaid Shoulders|Runed Clamshell Choker}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

== Progress ==
Is Wyrmskull up in flames?

== Completion ==
Excellent work, <name>! You took out a good chunk of their dragon riders and really pissed off their leadership.

Are you ready to head back to [[Valgarde]] and report the good news to [[Guard Captain Zorek|Zorek]]? If so, I've got a crazy idea!

== Notes ==
Go to the first harpoon you see and use the Harpoon Controller in your inventory. If both harpoons are being used, you will have to wait for someone to be leave or die. Don't worry about the big lever at the far south harpoon launcher. That is for the next step. #1 attacks buildings, #2 attacks defenders.

Target the three buildings down at Wyrmskull closest to the water. From left to right, they are the storage facility, dockhouse and longhouse. Target the roof of the building, not the sides.

Be sure to turn up your [View Distance] other wise you might not be able to see the buildings. This is done by pressing [Esc] then click on the [Video] button at the top of the options menu on the ledt you will see [Resolution] and [Effects]. Select [Effects] it is the top slider on the left under the big Video Quality slider. move it to the right for farther [View Distance]. it might slow you down so be sure to put it back after the quest. If it doesnt slow you down keep it there if you want.
Regarding the Longhouse, hit the roof to get it!

Although there is no timer, if you spend too long in the harpoon control, you'll eventually be catapulted out to land in Daggerbay. You'll have to swim back to Valgarde.
