== Objectives ==
Defeat [[Megalith]] and return to [[Sage Edan]] at [[Camp Winterhoof]].
* [[Megalith]] slain
* Suggested Players [3]

== Description ==
[[Binder Murdis]] created Megalith to be a kind of keystone for the runed giants and to lead them in their mission. Defeating Megalith will leave them lost and without direction. I will ask [[Chieftain Ashtotem]] to divert some of our men as we move north and dedicate them to eliminating the last of the runed giants. Without their giants, the [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves]] cannot stand against us.

Search the foothills of [[Frostblade Peak]], north of [[Giants' Run]] for Megalith and defeat him! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|10}}

== Progress ==
Do you bring news of Megalith's downfall?

== Completion ==
You've done well in felling Megalith, but I wonder about his final words.

You're sure he said the [[Stoneforge]]?

It is not a name our people know, but it sounds like it might be a creation of the "[[titan]]s" the ousiders speak of. The Iron Dwarves have ever been a cunning and dangerous foe, <name>. We must watch these giants and find this Stoneforge before they can carry out their plans.
