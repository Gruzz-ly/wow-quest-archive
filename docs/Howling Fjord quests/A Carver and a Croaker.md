== Objectives ==
Get a Shiny Knife from [["Silvermoon" Harry]] and capture a Scalawag Frog. Bring these to [[Zeh'gehn]] at [[Scalawag Point]].
* [[Scalawag Frog]]
* [[Shiny Knife]]

== Description ==
Some of the pirates around here... we have our own special way of talking. Zeh'gehn has... many different special ways of talking... all mixed together.

From what I can tell he wants a frog and a knife.

"Silvermoon" Harry might have a knife on the cheap. There's frogs all over town, just grab one and bring it to him along with the knife.

I'd hate to be in the poor critter's shoes, if you know what I mean.

== Progress ==
Ye get the croaker and the carver, mon?

== Completion ==
Much obliged, bucko. Croaker's lookin' real cris!

== Notes ==
"Silvermoon" Harry sells the Shiny Knife for {{cost||80}}. Right click on any Scalawag Frog. There should be a few within yards of Zeh'gehn.

Script event after the turn-in:
