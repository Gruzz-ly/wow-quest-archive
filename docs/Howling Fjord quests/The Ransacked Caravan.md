== Objectives ==
[[Hidalgo the Master Falconer|Hidalgo]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to use the Trained Rock Falcon to recover 5 Fjord Turkeys.

Return to Hidalgo with the cage once you have completed this task.
*[[Fjord Turkey]] (5)
* [[Trained Rock Falcon]] (provided)

== Description ==
I was leading a caravan here from [[Valgarde]] that was attacked by [[Dragonflayer]]s. I was the only survivor of that ambush. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it back here with the cargo of fjord turkeys. This is the perfect opportunity for you to get your feet wet with your rock falcon.

<Hidalgo hands you a cage.>

Take this falcon cage and head west down the road leading out of this camp. Use the falcon to capture the loose turkeys and return here when you've gathered enough.

Remember to feed the falcon!

== Progress ==
Your falcon must be constantly fed or else it will eat the prey that you are sending it to kill.

== Completion ==
Clever <!--bastards-->fiends. And patient too! We need to stop underestimating our enemy. Those [[vrykul]] are deadly hunters!

Regardless, mission accomplished. Perhaps it is time for you to hunt something more elusive than a fat turkey, eh?

== Notes ==
Watch out for the [[Dragonflayer Ambusher]]s.

You will need to gather a grub (see the previous quest) for each fjord turkey to be gathered.

Suggestions that the Vrykul's parents may not have been married (found in a previous version of this quest) may have been censored for wording deemed less offensive...

If you have a pet, put it on passive or it will attack the turkeys before the falcon gets them.

This is a good place to earn the achievement [[Friend or Fowl?]].
