== Objectives ==
[[Walt]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to use the [[Iron Rune Construct]]'s Collect Data ability while standing near the Iron Dwarf Relic.

Dismiss your construct by dismissing it from the pet window once you have completed the quest.
* Test Data Collected

== Description ==
The most important part of your job while controlling the construct is the collection of data. I've placed an iron dwarf relic in the cart over yonder. It's the floating, lightning infused crystal.

Get on the work bench and I'll put you back in the construct. Once you're back in the driver's seat, use the construct's data collection ability to pick up the test data.

== Progress ==
Fits like a glove, don't it?

== Completion ==
Perfect! Works like a charm!

== Notes ==
Same as last time, except this time #1 is "Collect Data".
