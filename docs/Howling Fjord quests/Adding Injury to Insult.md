==Objectives==
Read the [[Vrykul Insult]] to [[Bjorn Halgurdsson]] in [[Baleheim]], then lead him back to [[Lydell's Ambush]] and help slay him.
* Bjorn Halgurdsson insulted
* [[Bjorn Halgurdsson]] defeated
* [[Vrykul Insult]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[vrykul]] are being clever about this. Fortunately I've a trick up my sleeve.

This leader of theirs, Bjorn, is a real hothead. We've pieced together enough of their language to fashion what we think is a good insult. Something involving his mother and large barnyard animals... we're not quite sure.

Take this piece of paper and read it to him. Once he starts chasing you, lure him back here. We'll make sure he doesn't make it out alive. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bone-Inlaid Bracers
|Embossed Ermine Girdle
|Magdun Spaulders
|Runeplate Helm}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

==Progress==
Assassination work isn't as glamorous as it's made out to be.

==Completion==
Nice work. That poor sap never saw it coming.

==Notes==
* The NPCs at the ambush camp must engage Bjorn to reliably receive quest credit for defeating him. It is best to make pets passive and avoid overly damaging him while pulling him back to the ambush site. 
* The insult that is read to Bjorn is: "Bjorns mottar haelgond sygar!", which closely resembles the sentence, "Bjorns mother, Haelgond, sucks!" in nordic languages. This is supported by the fact that Bjorn responds by saying, "No one speaks of my mother in that manner!"
