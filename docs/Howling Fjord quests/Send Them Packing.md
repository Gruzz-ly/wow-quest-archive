== Objectives ==
[[Explorer Abagail]] has asked you to <code>/raise</code> your hand at 10 Abandoned Pack Mules and then return to her at [[Westguard Keep]].
* [[Abandoned Pack Mule]] Sent Packing

== Description ==
I've heard rumors of bad happenings in the [[Whisper Gulch]] to the north. Most of the [[Explorers' League]] went down into that place, and some say they went mad with what they discovered.

That doesn't change the fact that they took most of our mules and equipment with them, though. I won't lose those mules!

If you find yourself in there, and happen across any of my mules, just get up close on them and threaten them with a raised hand. They'll spook and come home for sure.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
this is quite a blow to our efforts.  I don't even want to know what they discovered down there.

It's enough to keep me awake at night just trying to imagine what it could be.

== Completion ==
I'm indebted to you, <class>. At least with most of the mules and equipment recovered, we can hope to rebuild our numbers soon.

Please, take this.

== Notes ==
Don't worry about doing this in one run. Two quests lead in to the gulch: [[Danger! Explosives!]] and then [[Leader of the Deranged]]

==Progression==
{{:Danger! Explosives!}}
