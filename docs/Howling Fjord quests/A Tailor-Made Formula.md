== Objectives ==
Obtain the Dragonflayer Patriarch's Blood from [[Thorvald]] at [[Thorvald's Camp]] and bring it to [[Chief Plaguebringer Harris]] in [[New Agamand]].
* [[Dragonflayer Patriarch's Blood]]

== Description ==
We've been spraying down the vrykul village of [[Halgrind]] for weeks now and the bastards just won't drop dead.

Let's face it, <name>, by now our Plague has been exposed to [[Caged Human Male|humans]], [[Captured Mountaineer|dwarves]], [[Stanley (dog)|dogs]], [[Thersa Windsong|livestock]]... you name it. As our strains adapt to their hosts, more impurities get thrown in the mix. What we need is a strain made custom for the vrykul's biology.

Halgrind's chieftain fled the town after we took it over; you'll find him west of here. As a patriarch of the Dragonflayer clan, his blood is ideal. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Acid-Etched Knuckles
|Featherweight Claymore
|Fullered Coldsteel Dagger
|Hair-Trigger Blunderbuss}}

== Progress ==
Have you obtained the sample I require, <name>?

== Completion ==
This will do. It's time for some real apothecary work now, <name>!
