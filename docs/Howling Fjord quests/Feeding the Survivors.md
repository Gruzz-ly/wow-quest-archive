==Objectives==
[[Elder Atuik]] at [[Kamagua]] in [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to obtain 6 pieces of Island Shoveltusk Meat from [[Island Shoveltusk]]s in [[the Isle of Spears]].
* [[Island Shoveltusk Meat]] (6)

==Description==
We [[tuskarr]] rely mostly on our fish catch for sustenance. In times of great need, however, we will on occasion hunt land animals.

The nearby village of [[Iskaal]] was recently attacked by pirates and the survivors just keep pouring in.

Our catch has been modest this week, but there are many [[shovel tusk|shoveltusk]] on the island and their meat is plentiful.

Aid my people by hunting these great beasts and obtaining their meat.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Have you obtained the meat we need?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. My people are in a time of great need.
