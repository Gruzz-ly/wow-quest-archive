==Objectives==
[[Captain Adams]] has ordered you to get 5 bomb hits on the Plague Tanks at [[New Agamand]]. Do not return to him at [[Westguard Keep]] until you have accomplished that.
* Plague Tank Hits (5)

==Description==
The [[Royal Apothecary Society]] thinks they're going to perfect a new [[Plague of Undeath|plague]] to melt us down where we stand?!

Not on my watch!

Get out to the courtyard and speak with [[Greer Orehammer]]. He's got a [[gryphon]] and some bombs ready for you. I want you to bomb the plague tanks at New Agamand to smithereens!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Coldstone-Inlaid Waistguard|Flamebinder Handwraps|Purestrike Bracers|Emeraldscale Pauldrons}}
* You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

==Progress==
Those plague tanks destroyed, yet?  That new plague looms over our heads like certain death, <class>!

==Completion==
Nicely done, <name>, nicely done!

<The captain seems beside himself with glee.>

That'll show those good-for-nothing [[Forsaken]] to think about messing with us!

I'd say you've earned yourself something from the treasury!

==Notes==
Talk to Greer Orehammer.
:{{Gossip|Greer, I need a gryphon to ride and some bombs to drop on New Agamand!}}
:''The player is mounted on a gryphon and receives [[Orehammer's Precision Bombs]].''

The gryphon flies two passes over the town; the bombs have a relatively low cooldown—aim fast.
