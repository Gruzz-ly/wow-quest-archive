== Objectives ==
[[Vice Admiral Keller]] at [[Valgarde|Valgarde Port]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to rescue 3 Captured Valgarde Prisoners.
* Captured Valgarde Prisoner Rescued (3)

== Description ==
This battle is far from over, <name>. If our people are still alive inside that village, someone has to go and get 'em.

<Vice Admiral Keller nods at you.>

Head north and enter [[Wyrmskull Village]]. Once there, look for our people. If they are imprisoned you'll need to find a way to break them out.

Maybe they'll have some more information about what it is that we're actually fighting.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|40}}

== Progress ==
Put some backbone into it, <name>! People's lives are at stake here!

== Completion ==
Those soldiers you rescued had a good bit of information for us. These monsters call themselves '[[vrykul]].' The tribe that's taken up Wyrmskull Village is led by a mystic named [[Yanis the Mystic|Yanis]] who himself is an underling of another vrykul named [[Ingvar the Plunderer]].

== Notes ==
[[Image:Dragonflayer Cage.jpg|thumb|Cages with prisoners]]
Rescuing a prisoner will temporarily add him or her to your party. If you are in an actual party, occasionally the NPC will say in party chat "I hear they're sacrificing prisoners up at their ritual grounds. I think the place is called [[Gjalerbron]]...".

The [[Dragonflayer Cage Key]] can drop from any Dragonflayer vrykul in [[Wyrmskull Village]]

Any of the following NPCs qualify:
*{{NPC|Alliance|Captured Valgarde Mage}}
*{{NPC|Alliance|Captured Valgarde Paladin}}
*{{NPC|Alliance|Captured Valgarde Priest}}
*{{NPC|Alliance|Captured Valgarde Warrior}}
