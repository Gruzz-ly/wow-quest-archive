*[[Captured Protectorate Vanguard]] Escorted

==Description==
Thank [[K'aresh]]! He would have torn me apart!

I'm a [[Protectorate]] soldier, fleshling. My platoon was sent on a recon mission about 10 days ago. As we were moving across the upper ledges of this island, a group of [[Ethereum]] jumped us. At least I think it was Ethereum. They had the same energy color but their wrappings looked [[void]].

Only [[Captain Tyralius|Tyralius]] was spared. I think they put him in a prison cell.

I've got to get back to the Protectorate Watch Post! Can you escort me back? 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
<[[Commander Ameer]] appears pleased.>

Well done, fleshling! This soldier might be the key to taking down the Ethereum's entire operation.
