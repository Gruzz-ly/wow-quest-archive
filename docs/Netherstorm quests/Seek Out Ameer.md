'''Seek Out Ameer''' starts in [[Stormspire]] and kicks off a series of [[Consortium]] quests added with patch 2.1. The quest series ends in being able to summon an optional boss after the final boss of Heroic Mana-Tombs. You will need to be [[Honored]] or better with [[Consortium]] before starting this quest chain. 

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Commander Ameer]] at the [[Protectorate Watch Post]].

==Description==
It would seem that an outside force has taken an interest in the business practices of the Consortium. Five Consortium dealers have gone missing in the past two days. We have reason to believe the Ethereum are involved. If you are interested in assisting, seek out Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post.

You will find the Protectorate Watch Post directly east of here on the next island.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost||44}}
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Consortium]]

==Completion==
Aye, it is true, but the Consortium are not the only group claiming losses.

==Notes==
[[Commander Ameer]]{{Coords|60|32|Netherstorm}} can be found at [[Protectorate Watch Post]] directly east of [[Stormspire]] in [[Netherstorm]].
