==Objectives==
Spymaster Thalodien at [[Area 52]] wants you to obtain the First Half of Socrethar's Stone from [[Forgemaster Morug]] at [[Forge Base: Oblivion]] and the Second Half of Socrethar's Stone from [[Silroth]] at [[Forge Base: Gehenna]].

Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.
*[[First Half of Socrethar's Stone]]
*[[Second Half of Socrethar's Stone]]

==Description==
I don't want to send you to Voren'thal empty-handed. It's not in my style to be underwhelming.

To gain access to Socrethar's Seat in the north, we'll need to use his own teleporters - locked by Socrethar's teleportation stone. The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base Oblivion. The second half is held by the demon Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.

Obtain these and Voren'thal will be impressed beyond words.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*15800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|48|}} at max level)
*-385 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained Socrethar's teleportation stone, <name>?

==Completion==
You do not cease to amaze me, <name>! Good thing you're on our side.
