==Objectives==
Use the Triangulation Device to point your way toward the first triangulation point. Once you have found it, report the location to [[Dealer Hazzin]] at the [[Protectorate Watch Post|Protectorate Watchpost]] on the [[Manaforge Ultris]] island in the [[Netherstorm]].
*First triangulation point discovered
*[[Triangulation Device]] (provided)

==Description==
There is another reason for the retrieval of the surveying equipment. There is a crystal from [[draenei]] legend of great importance to me.

It is said that the crystal bestows god-like powers to its bearer! But it is in danger of being unearthed by others - namely the [[Burning Legion]].

<Name>, take the equipment and use it to find the first triangulation point. We know it to be somewhere to the east near Manaforge Ultris.

Afterward, check-in with my agent, [[Dealer Hazzin]], on the Manaforge Ultris island.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Hello, traveler. You come to Hazzin because you are in need of my goods? 

==Completion==
<Dealer Hazzin lowers his voice to a whisper.>

Ah, I know of your mission. It is one of great importance to Nexus-Prince Haramad!

Now that we know the location of this first triangulation point, you must move swiftly to find the second!

==Notes==
You must activate the equipment a short distance (20-100 yards) from the triangulation point{{coords|66|33.8|Netherstorm}}, then approach the resulting floating red arrow to get credit.
