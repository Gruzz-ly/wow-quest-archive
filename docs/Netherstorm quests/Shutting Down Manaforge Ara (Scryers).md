Performing quests for the [[Scryers]] will cause your [[Aldor]] reputation level to decrease.
*Manaforge Ara Shut Down
*[[Ara Access Crystal]] 
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
You've done much better than any of us anticipated. Manaforge Ara is the last of Kael's working manaforges. You'll find it northwest of here, though you're likely to have to do some circumnavigating to get to it. We want you to shut it down.

The last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad. This is Kael's very last source of energy as far as we know, so expect heavy opposition. I'd bring a couple of friends along if I were you.

Hmm... Azarad. What an odd name for a sin'dorei.

==Rewards==
* {{cost|4|40|}}
*12650 [[XP]] 
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]
*-275 reputation with [[The Aldor]]

==Progress==
Have you completed the task I asked of you, <name>?

==Completion==
The [[Burning Legion]] is in cahoots with Kael? &nbsp;Hah! &nbsp;[[Voren'thal the Seer|Voren'thal]] is going to have a field day with this information.

Do you think the thousands of pilgrims that have come from Azeroth want to be allied with the Burning Legion? &nbsp;I think not!
