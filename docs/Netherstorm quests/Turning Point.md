==Objectives==
Use Socrethar's Teleportation's Stone at Invasion Point: Overlord, north of Forge Base: Oblivion to transport your party to Socrethar's Landing. Once there, use Voren'thal's Presence to defeat [[Socrethar]].
Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease. 
*[[Socrethar]] slain
*[[Socrethar's Teleportation Stone]]
*[[Voren'thal's Presence]]
*[[Voren'thal's Package]] (provided)
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
This is the chance we've been waiting for, &lt;name&gt;. Not only have we uncovered the evidence we need to show our people who Kael'thas is really working for, but we can prove our strength by defeating his new masters.

My frail health prevents me from aiding you in person with this endeavor, but I will offer you an object that will allow me to project my powers across the continent.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Socrethar's Girdle|Netherfused Pauldrons|Greaves of Spellpower|Gauntlets of the Vanquisher|Wand of the Seer}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
*19000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|11|40|}} at max level)
*-1100 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+1000 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
You are an individual of formidable power, &lt;name&gt;. The Scryers are fortunate to count you as an ally.

As word of Kael's new allegiance spreads, more people will see things our way. The fact that we can claim such a decisive victory against Kael'thas' new overlords puts us in a most favorable situation.

I will not forget your deeds.

==Aldor version==
[[Deathblow to the Legion]]. Aldor players get NPC helpers rather than the quest item. You can group with Aldors when looking for a group and they will be happy to have a scryer. [[Voren'thal's Presence]] is much more helpful than the npcs.

==Bug and workaround==
The encounter was once known to bug for a very long time, making Socrethar merely stand there and not aggro or be able to be attacked. This was possibly due to a wipe while using the adds, freezing the event in place. Since a recent patch, this bug has been known to happen less frequently. It is likely that this bug is caused when the NPCs get their aggro table confused due to an add.

'''If the encounter bugs, here is how to fix it:'''
*1. Aggro a random mob not associated with the quest.
*2. Kite mob over to friendly NPCs.
*3. While mob is still alive, kite enemy and friendly NPCs attacking it over to Socrethar.
*4. Friendly NPCs should aggro the quest mob and unbug the quest.
*5. Either fight it out now, or let the npcs die and reset the encounter.

If another group is killing him (even if opposite faction) there is a 50% chance your quest will complete if you are close enough.

==Notes==
It's not necessary to use [[Socrethar's Teleportation Stone]], as a flying mount can take you directly to [[Socrethar's Seat]]{{coords|29|14|Netherstorm}}.
