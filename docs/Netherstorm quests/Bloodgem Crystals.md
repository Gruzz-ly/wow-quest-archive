==Objectives==
[[Magistrix Larynna]] wants you to go to [[Manaforge B'naar]] and obtain a [[:Bloodgem Shard]] from a [[Sunfury Magister]]. Use this shard near the larger Bloodgem crystals and return to her at [[Area 52]].

Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.
*Siphon Bloodgem Crystal

==Description==
[[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael]]'s magisters have refined their usage of [[mana crystal]]s to the point where they can siphon large amounts of energy in a matter of seconds.

They do this by attuning smaller bloodgem crystal shards to larger, fully charged ones.

Go to Manaforge B'naar and obtain one of these shards from a [[Sunfury]] magister and use it to siphon energy from one of the larger crystals.

Return to me so that I may study the effects of the aura. Do not worry; any side effects should be temporary.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] ({{cost|11|10}} at max level)
*{{cost|3|90}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Scryers]]
*-275 reputation with [[Aldor]]

==Progress==
Did you investigate the bloodgems used by the Sunfury magisters, <name>?

==Completion==
Hmmm... just as I suspected.

Exposure to this level of raw energy greatly magnifies our innate [[Magic addiction|addiction to magic]].

I'm not surprised Kael gets away with what he does; all his subordinates are basically drunk on this.

==Trivia==
Here is a conversation between [[Gezhe]] and a [[Consortium Nether Runner]] at [[Aeris Landing]].
