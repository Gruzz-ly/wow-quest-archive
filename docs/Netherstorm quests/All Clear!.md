==Objectives==
[[Tashar]], stationed at [[Eco-Dome Farfield]], wants you to kill 12 [[Scythetooth Raptor]]s.
*[[Scythetooth Raptor]] slain (12)

==Description==
Before we can begin the test, we have to make certain the area is clear of anything that might interfere. In our case, that means these overgrown lizards.

<Tashar gestures toward the scythetooth raptors.>

There's no telling what might happen if one those decides to take a nice bite out of the generator while it's charging. I've seen a lot of strange things in all my years as a technician, including more than a few abominations that had their beginnings as humble animals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost||75}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Have you cleared the test area?

==Completion==
Well done. It looks like everything is in order. We're ready to begin.

==Progression==
{{Run a Diagnostic!}}

==Patch changes==
