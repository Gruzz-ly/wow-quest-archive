==Objectives==
Recover the [[Ata'mal Crystal]] and deliver it to the {{NPC|Neutral|Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad}} at the [[Stormspire]] in the [[Netherstorm]]. 
*[[Ata'mal Crystal]]
*Suggested players: [2]

==Description==
With the data from both the first and second points, I'm now certain that the crystal is at the top of the Ruins of Farahlon to the northeast.

Unfortunately, the data indicates that the crystal is moving, which means that it has already been discovered, probably by the Burning Legion!
Just in case, I recommend that you take some friends along.

Slay the demon that has the crystal and return it to Nexus-Prince Haramad.

==Rewards==
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*12650 [[XP]]
*500 [[reputation]] with the [[Consortium]]

==Progress==
Hello again, my friend. How fare your efforts to find the crystal?

==Completion==
Beyond my wildest dreams, I never thought that you would be able to retrieve the crystal!

And then to actually give it to me! Do you have any idea how powerful it is?
Your selflessness is inspirational and beyond reproach, &lt;name&gt;! You have given me much to think about.

==Notes==
*[[Culuthas]] has the crystal and is at {{coords|53.4|21.4|Netherstorm}}.
*After turning in this quest, when the three blood elves turn hostile, do not kill them before Haramad kills them himself! If you do kill them, the quest glitches out, and you will have to wait until the image of Haramad respawns (which takes 8 minutes) to pick up the next quest.

;Dialogue
After this quest is completed, [[Ambassador Solannas]] and [[Ambassador's Honor Guard|two honor guards]] arrive to confront Haramad.
:{{text|say|Ambassador Solannas|Indeed, Nexus-Prince Haramad, you do have much to think on. Such as turning that ata'mal crystal over to my master, Prince Kael'thas.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad|No, I think not. The selflessness that I have just been witness to has cleared my mind. My dealings with your master are at an end. You may return and let him know that I have decided to turn the ata'mal crystal over to the naaru.}}
:{{text|say|Ambassador Solannas|WHAT! This is outrageous! You will pay for this, Haramad! You and your assistant here!}}
:''Solannas and his honor guards attack the player.''
:{{text|say|Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad|Guards! Hold on, I will be right there!}}
:''Haramad emerges from a nearby teleporter and proceeds to kill Solannas and his honor guards.''
:{{text|say|Nexus-Prince Haramad|That definitely ended our business relationship with Kael'thas. Please stay here. I will return shortly and there is something I want you to do.}}
