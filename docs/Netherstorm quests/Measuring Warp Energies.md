==Objectives==
[[Exarch Orelis]] in [[Area 52]] wants you to take the Warp-Attuned Orb to [[Manaforge B'naar]] and use it at the end of its four pipelines.

Performing quests for the [[Aldor]] will cause your [[Scryers]] [[reputation]] to decrease.
*Northern Pipeline Measured
*Eastern Pipeline Measured
*Southern Pipeline Measured
*Western Pipeline Measured
*[[Warp-Attuned Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
If our instincts are right and these [[manaforge]]s have been made using [[technology]] from [[Tempest Keep]], then all of [[Outland]] could be in grave danger.

Tempest Keep's energy-recharging mechanisms were never supposed to be used this close to the land. The warp energies are capable of destroying this very land, even when contained within [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael]]'s pipelines.

Take this orb to Manaforge B'naar; it is attuned to measure warp energies. Use it at the pipelines' ends, where they go into the earth.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Energized Helm
|Warp-Shielded Hauberk
|Resonating Axe
|Warpweaver's Gloves
}}

You will also receive:
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]

==Progress==
Have you performed the measurements I asked for, <name>?

==Completion==
This is grave news, <name>.  The warp energies emanating from the pipelines are dangerously high.

We must find a way to shut down the manaforges or what little remains of Outland will be shattered into pieces.

==Notes==
Locations of the "foot" of the pipes are as follows:
*East - 28.9,71.8
*North - 25.4,60.4
*West - 21.2,67.5
*South - 20.9,71.0
