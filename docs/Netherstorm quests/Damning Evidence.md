'''Damning Evidence''' is part of the Kick Them While They're Down quest chain, which starts with [[Kick Them While They're Down]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 8 Orders from Kael'thas from demons at Manaforge Ara and bring them to [[Spymaster Thalodien]] in [[Area 52]].

Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.
*[[Orders From Kael'thas]] (8)

==Description==
As you may have noticed, there are servants of the Burning Legion all over Manaforge Ara. Kael'thas has entered an alliance with the Burning Legion. He must've caught wind of Illidan's descent into insanity and switched paymasters accordingly.

If the Scryers get definite proof of this, it will give them a considerable political advantage. I know for a fact that the Legion forces at this manaforge have orders that bear Kael's seal.

Get these orders and bring them to Thalodien.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1265 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]
*-275 reputation with [[The Aldor]]

==Progress==
Well?  What did Theledorn have to say?

== Completion ==
This is big, <name>.  Very big!

Voren'thal is going to want to hear about this as soon as possible.
