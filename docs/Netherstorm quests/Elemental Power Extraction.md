==Objectives==
Extract 5 Elemental Power for [[Chief Engineer Trep]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]]. 
*[[Elemental Power Extractor]] (provided)
*[[Elemental Power]] (5)

==Description==
Darn it, that didn't do it!

Ok, I've got another idea! I had Xyrol whip up an elemental power extractor. I'm not certain exactly what this power will do, but I know that I can use it.

The sundered rumblers and warp aberrations on the ledge of the Crumbling Wastes to the south have just what I need for the engines!

The extractor will change the form of their power into something solid that you'll be able to gather up after you've defeated them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Trep's Shoulderguards|Heavy-Duty Engineering Boots|Area 52 Engineering Gloves|Chief Engineer's Belt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|90|}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
You have the power from those elementals yet? &nbsp;Oh, don't hurry or anything. &nbsp;It's just my life and career on the line.

==Completion==
That's more like it! &nbsp;Alright, now I think we're in business.

Just let me dump this stuff into the thing-a-ma-jig here and I'm sure it'll spit out a fully functioning phase engine core.

Oh, hey, I guess I ought to reward you for saving my neck! &nbsp;Hehe.
