'''Ethereum Data''' is the second part of a [[Netherstorm]]-based [[quest chain]] that begins with [[The Ethereum]] and ends with [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]].

==Objectives==
Recover the Ethereum Data Cell and return it to [[Commander Ameer]].
*[[Ethereum Data Cell]] {{co|55.8|39.9|Netherstorm}}

==Description==
Look around you, fleshling. Very close to this transponder should be an [[Ethereum]] data cell. Locate that data cell, open it, and retrieve the contents.

Bring it back to this transponder at once!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,700 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the data cell?

==Completion==
<You hold the data cell out so Ameer can read the plans.>

Nothing... Damn them! They're clever, but not as clever as Ameer!

What I'm about to ask you to do is quite dangerous. I'll understand if you don't want to continue, fleshling.

==Progression==
