==Description==
The infamous [[eredar]], [[Socrethar]], leads the [[Burning Legion]] in [[Netherstorm]]. Mentioning his name is enough to make most [[draenei]] shudder. He gives orders from an island in the northwest that only his most trusted lieutenants can access.

To get there you will need to obtain a teleportation stone, which won't be an easy task. The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion. The second half is held by Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
*15800 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-385 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Completion==
Your dedication to our cause is exemplary, <name>. With Socrethar's teleportation stone in our possession only one thing remains to be done.
