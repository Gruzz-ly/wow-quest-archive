==Objectives==
Deliver the Surveying Equipment to the [[Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad]] at the [[Stormspire]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Surveying Equipment]] (provided)

==Description==
Nexus-Prince Haramad has conveyed to me that he is interested in the immediate return of this property to him personally. I would greatly appreciate if you would deliver it in my stead.

It is a great honor to gain an audience with the nexus-prince, and I am sure that he would be keenly interested in hearing the tales of your adventures here in the [[Netherstorm]].

Seek out his chamber atop the [[Stormspire]] to the north. He is often present as a holographic image, which you may address.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|10|}}
*6150 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|69|}} at level 70)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Approach.

==Completion==
I welcome you to the [[Stormspire]], <class>. Please enjoy the hospitality of the Consortium.

You may place that equipment anywhere. I suspect that you'll be picking it back up rather soon.
