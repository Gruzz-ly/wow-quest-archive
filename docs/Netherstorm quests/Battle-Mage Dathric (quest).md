==Objectives==
Locate Battle-Mage Dathric's quarters in [[Wizard Row|Wizard's Row]] and return the blade to his weapon rack. Then, speak with [[Custodian Dieworth]] at [[Kirin'Var Village]].
*Put Dathric's Spirit to Rest
*[[Dathric's Blade]] (provided)

==Description==
The sword is of exceptional quality, finely crafted and perfectly balanced for a battle-mage. The seal of the Kirin Tor and the name "Dathric" are engraved into the weapon's pommel.

Turning the weapon over in your hands, you notice a sense of wrongness radiating from the metal, as if the item is torn between two worlds. Could this be the item anchoring [[Battle-Mage Dathric]]'s spirit to this world?

Perhaps returning it to its proper place can break the bond, freeing Dathric's spirit to rest at last.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|20}}

==Progress==
What have you found, <name>?

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>. I can no longer sense any restlessness in Dathric's spirit. I would give much for the opportunity to speak to him one more time, but it is enough that he is finally at rest. 

==Notes==
Dathric is located in the [[Town Hall]]. His house is the only fully intact building in Wizard's Row, just northeast of the Violet Tower.{{coords|57|87|Netherstorm}} Its roof blocks the weapon rack from being visible from the air.

When the blade is returned to its rightful place, [[Battle-Mage Dathric]]'s spirit appears and retrieves it, before fading.
