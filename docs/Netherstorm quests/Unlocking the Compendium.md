==Objectives==
Obtain the Heliotrope Oculus from [[Spellreaver Marathelle]] at [[Sunfury Hold]]. Use Archmage Vargoth's Staff to contact [[Archmage Vargoth|the archmage]] once you have achieved your goal.

If you lose Archmage Vargoth's Staff, speak to [[Ravandwyr]] at [[Area 52]] to receive a replacement.
*[[Heliotrope Oculus]]
*[[Archmage Vargoth's Staff]] (provided)

==Description==
While I'm glad to have most of [[Krasus's Compendium]] back, it's useless without the heliotrope oculus. You see, [[Krasus]] was well aware of the sheer power of the spells recorded in the book and took steps to safeguard them from prying eyes.

Only a knowledgeable mage can use the oculus to unlock the compendium's secrets.

During [[Kael'thas]]'s attack, one of his lieutenants, Spellreaver Marathelle, looted it and took it to Sunfury Hold northeast of the tower. No doubt she thought it a pretty little bauble.

==Progress==
Have you recovered the oculus?

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>. Now, we have most of what we'll need to attempt to break Kael'thas's magic.

And if the [[blood elf|blood elves]] suffer from the loss of their local commander, so much the better.

==Notes==
This quest is the 6th step in a quest chain in [[Netherstorm]] that begins with [[The Archmage's Staff]].
