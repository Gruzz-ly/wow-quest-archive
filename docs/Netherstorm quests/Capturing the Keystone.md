==Objectives==
Venture into [[Tempest Keep]]'s [[Botanica]] and retrieve The Keystone from [[Commander Sarannis]]. Bring it to [[Archmage Vargoth]] at [[The Violet Tower]].
*[[The Keystone]]

==Description==
It doesn't surprise me that [[Kael'thas]] has put the key to this ward in the hands of someone like [[Commander Sarannis]]. Prince [[Kael'thas]] is a great many things, but he is no simpleton.

In order to break this curse once and for all, you must enter [[Tempest Keep]] and claim the keystone.

Only once the keystone has been destroyed will I regain my freedom.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|13|20}}

==Progress==
Did you obtain the keystone?

==Completion==
<The archmage's eyes light up when you hand him the stone.>

Amazing! From what little I've seen of the fate of [[Farahlon]], I'm not certain I want to go outside, but it's much better than being trapped here for the rest of my days.

==Notes==
This quest is the last step in a quest chain in [[Netherstorm]] that begins with [[Finding the Keymaster]].  Commander Sarannis drops the quest item in normal and heroic modes.

==Progression==
A follow up of [[Ar'kelos the Guardian]].
