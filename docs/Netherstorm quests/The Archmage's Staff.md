==Objectives==
Retrieve Archmage Vargoth's Staff from [[Ekkorash the Inquisitor]] and bring it to Ravandwyr in [[Area 52]]. To bring Ekkorash out of hiding, sprinkle the Conjuring Powder on the [[Arklon Brazier|brazier]] in the center of the ruins. 
*[[Archmage Vargoth's Staff]]
*[[Conjuring Powder]] (provided)

== Description ==
Allow me to introduce myself, <class>.

I am Ravandwyr, apprentice to the [[Archmage Vargoth]].

My master is... indisposed, shall we say. I am here on a matter of great importance.

The [[Arklon Ruins]] southeast of the city are a hotbed of Burning Legion activity. Their purpose in the ruins concerns neither me nor my master, but their leader, Ekkorash, possesses the archmage's staff.

This conjuring powder will allow you to draw the demon out of hiding. Sprinkle it on the brazier at the center of the ruins.

==Progress==
I will not rest until Archmage Vargoth's staff is restored to him. Were you able to wrest it from the demon's grasp?

==Completion==
Ah, so you managed to recover the staff. Impressive, <name>. Perhaps you are the one I've been looking for.

Oh yes, your reward...

No doubt you had higher expectations, but that too will come with time. For now, consider opportunity the true reward.
