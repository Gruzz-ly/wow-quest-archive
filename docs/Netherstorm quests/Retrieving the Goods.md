==Objectives==
[[Audi the Needle]] at the [[Stormspire]] wants you to bring her 10 [[Dome Generator Segment]]s.
* [[Dome Generator Segment]] (10)

==Description==
<Audi looks around and then lowers her voice.>

I'm sure [[Shauly Pore|Shauly]] told you a bit about our work here. When [[Action Jaxon|Jaxon]] and I are out in the field 'hunting,' we've been collecting pieces of the [[ethereal]] [[eco-dome]] generators and hiding them in the nests of our prey, the [[raptor]]s in [[Eco-Dome Farfield]].

It's a remote area to the northeast of the Stormspire, close to the [[Netherstone]]. I don't anticipate you'll run into many ethereals there, but would you be willing to help us collect the dome generator pieces? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Audi's Embroidered Boots
|Field Agent's Bracers
|B.O.O.M. Operative's Belt
|Otherworldly Pauldrons}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you collect everything?

==Completion==
Excellent work! The most difficult part of the project is done. Now, all we need is a way to get these back to [[Area 52]] and attract the interest of the [[Cenarion Expedition]] as well. There should be enough here for our own needs and to earn a little profit on the side.
