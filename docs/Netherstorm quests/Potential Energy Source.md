==Objectives==
Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran at Kirin'Var Village wants you to capture 10 Energy Isolation Cubes from the blood elf operations at Manaforge Coruu. 
*[[Energy Isolation Cube]] (10)

==Description==
We are not the only ones battling the influx of the mana beings. The blood elves, too, are troubled by them, but I'm not sure why.

Whatever they're involved in over there, they don't seem to be stopping. Instead, I've seen them employ a variety of methods to kill the creatures. The most effective involves magical defenses fueled by some sort of concentrated energy.

Capture some of these energy sources and bring them to me. Don't hesitate to stymie the elves if an opportunity presents itself. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Were you able to gather any of their energy sources? 

==Completion==
<Morran gingerly handles one of the containers.>

I don't believe I've seen anything like this before. There's certainly a lot of energy suspended in here, but it's in a raw form. We'll have to be careful with it, but I think we can find a way to adapt this to help ward off the mana creatures.
