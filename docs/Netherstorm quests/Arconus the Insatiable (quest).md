==Objectives==
[[Agent Ya-six]] at [[Access Shaft Zeon]] in [[Netherstorm]] has asked you to slay Arconus the Insatiable and return to [[Commander Ameer]] at the [[Protectorate Watch Post]] in Netherstorm.
*[[Arconus the Insatiable]] slain

==Description==
[[Agent Araxes|Araxes]] and I were deployed to [[Manaforge Ultris|Ultris]] 2 days ago. Our mission: Find and terminate the [[Voidlord|void lord]] Arconus. We tracked him to this mine and discovered that he'd been feeding off the energies of the creatures in the area.

A fire-fight broke out which resulted in Araxes and I separating. Now I'm stuck here, badly injured. The mission is in shambles!

If you can take out Arconus, [[High Command#Protectorate High Command|high command]] would be grateful. Should you accept this mission, I will assist by providing a reflection of myself as a guardian.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flesh Handler's Headpiece
|Protectorate Assassin's Tunic
|Starcaller's Plated Belt
|Netherfarer's Leggings
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|92|50}}
*450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Status, fleshling? What is your status?

==Completion==
And Ya-six? Did he make it?

Let's damn well hope so. I was unable to get reinforcements back to them... [[Ethereum]] have the entire area covered now.

My apologies, I nearly forgot about your reward.

==Notes==
It is advisable get [[The Flesh Lies...]] before heading into the cave, so you can skip half the kills by simply charring the withered corpses instead of fighting them. This lets you get to Arconus and back out again much more quickly.
