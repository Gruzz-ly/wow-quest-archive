==Objectives==
[[Custodian Dieworth]] at [[Kirin'Var Village]] wants you to kill [[Master Daellis Dawnstrike]].
*[[Master Daellis Dawnstrike]] slain

==Description==
I'll never forget the [[blood elf]] who led the attack. He wore a [[tabard]] with a device I've never seen before, over top of crimson armor.

He was ferocious and merciless, leading from the front where most other blood elf [[officer]]s would never be seen. He was responsible for the deaths of many [[Kirin Tor]] [[mage]]s that day, but he didn't linger long at [[Sunfury Hold]]. [[Kael'thas]] has ordered him to [[Manaforge Duro]] to aid in their attempt to control the area. Find him, <name>, and silence his bow for good.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Dawnstrike's Cloak|Signet of the Violet Tower|Strength of the Violet Tower|Nightstalker's Wristguards}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you finished the task, <name>?

==Completion==
<You're not certain, but it seems as though Custodian Dieworth is on the verge of tears.>

At last, it is through. If I could will myself out of existence, I would, but the truth is I don't know how to let go. For the ones in the village, it is difficult but straightforward. I suppose this is the price we pay for retaining such strong ties to this place.
