==Objectives==
Travel to [[Manaforge Ara]] and obtain the Ara Access Crystal from [[Overseer Azarad]]. Use it at the Manaforge [[Ara Control Console|Ara console]] to shut it down.

Performing quests for the [[Aldor]] will cause your [[Scryers]] reputation level to decrease.
*Manaforge Ara Shut Down
*[[Ara Access Crystal]]

==Description==
One manaforge is all that keeps Tempest Keep functional. After we bring Manaforge Ara down, Kael will have to resort to depleting whatever energy he's got stored up.

Travel to Manaforge Ara, in the northwest, and deliver the final blow that we need by shutting it down.

The last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad. Be warned that we expect heavy opposition in the last of Kael's functional manaforges. You're likely to need the assistance of reliable friends.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*12650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-275 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

{{itembox|You can select one of these rewards:|Karja's Medallion|Overseer's Signet}}

==Progress==
Have you completed the task I asked of you, <name>?

==Completion==
The Burning Legion? Allied with Kael'thas Sunstrider?

This is dire news. It explains much about what we've seen here and in Shadowmoon.

We must send word back to Shattrath City immediately.

==Notes==
[[Anchorite Karja]] is located in the inn at [[Area 52]], in [[Netherstorm]].
