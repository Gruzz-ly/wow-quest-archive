==Objectives==
Obtain an Arklon Crystal Artifact and return it to [[Nether-Stalker Khay'ji]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Arklon Crystal Artifact]]

==Description==
Our leader, Nexus-Prince Haramad, has tasked me with the acquisition of a crystal artifact from the Arklon Ruins to the southeast.

They're old draenei ruins. Unfortunately for both myself and the goblins here, the Burning Legion has decided to move in to perform their own excavation.

If you're willing to help me, go to the ruins and take the crystal artifact from the dreadlord named [[Pentatharon]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
I get the impression that the prince is looking for a particular crystal, but I'm not certain what it is.

Have you already recovered the one from the dreadlord?

==Completion==
Let me have a look at that.

Hmm, there doesn't appear to be anything special about it. I doubt this is it, though the manner in which you describe the Burning Legion's activities at the ruins, it sounds as if they're searching for something in particular as well.

Let us hope that it's not the crystal that the nexus-prince wants so badly.
