This quest is the 2nd step in a quest chain in [[Netherstorm]] that begins with [[Recipe for Destruction]].

==Objectives==
[[Professor Dabiri]] at the [[Protectorate Watch Post]] in [[Netherstorm]] wants you to use your Phase Disruptor when you get in range of the [[Void Conduit (Netherstorm)|Void Conduit]] that rests atop [[Manaforge Ultris|Ultris]]. Drop as many charges of the Phase Disruptor as you can to ensure total annihilation. The Phase Disruptor charges will automatically home in on the Void Conduit so long as you are close enough to use it.

Return to Professor Dabiri should you succeed!  
*Void Conduit Destroyed: 0/1
*[[Phase Disruptor]] (provided)

==Description==
Here it is, <name>. Take this phase disruptor and mount up! The [[Protectorate]] [[nether drake]] will fly you close enough to Ultris so that you can drop the disruptor on top of the void conduit.

Drop as many disruptor charges as possible to ensure complete annihilation!

When you are ready, speak with the nether drake and he'll take you up.

If you miss the mark you will have to get more bombs from me before you can go up again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||75}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Consortium|The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Did you hit the mark?

==Completion==
The time to strike has come! With the tear gone, [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|Dimensius]] is vulnerable to physical and magical attacks!

==Notes==
Upon destroying the [[Void Conduit (Netherstorm)|Void Conduit]]:
:{{text|yell|Dimensius the All-Devouring|You only hasten the inevitable. In time, all will be devoured!}}
