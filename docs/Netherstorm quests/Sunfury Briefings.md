Go to [[Manaforge Duro]] and retrieve the Sunfury Military Briefing and the Sunfury Arcane Briefing from the [[Sunfury]] units stationed there. Return to [[Exarch Orelis|Exarch Orellis]]{{sic}} when you've completed this task.

Completing quests for the [[Aldor]] will cause your [[Scryers]] [[reputation]] level to decrease.
*[[Sunfury Military Briefing]]
*[[Sunfury Arcane Briefing]]

==Description==
Something about these [[manaforge]]s has been bothering me, <name>. [[Naaru]] [[technology]] is incredibly advanced; it should've taken [[Kael'thas]] years to even begin to understand it.

Information-gathering on the subject has been difficult as Kael's army is well disciplined and destroys all evidence of written communication.

We've been informed Manaforge Duro is under attack by [[mana]] creatures. It is possible that those defending it have not yet destroyed their briefings. Obtain them and bring them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
Did you have any luck with the briefings from Manaforge Duro?

==Completion==
Excellent job, <name>! Let us see what can be learned from these briefings.

==Progression==
