This quest begins a quest chain in the [[Netherstorm]]. You must first complete [[Consortium Crystal Collection]] and [[Pick Your Part]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Mama Wheeler]] at the [[Midrealm Post]] inside [[Eco-Dome Midrealm]] in the Netherstorm.

==Description==
Say, <name>, I was wondering if you could do me another favor.

My partner out in the field could probably use a hand. I was wondering if you could go check in on her.

I'm sure that Mama Wheeler will appreciate the help. Just don't mind her sharp tongue.

She's trying to look out for our interests to the east. You'll find her just inside Eco-Dome Midrealm at the Midrealm Post.

==Completion==
What?!  He called me his 'partner'?  I'm his wife!

And he said I had a sharp tongue!  Ooh, when I get back to [[Area 52]], I'm going to box his big, green ears!

But I'm glad that you're here.  He was right about one thing; I can definitely use your help!
