==Objectives==
Go inside Manaforge B'naar and find the B'naar Control Console.

Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.
*[[Blank Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
The Scryers obtained a personnel roster for Manaforge B'naar and are now having a field day picking out assassination targets.<BR>They've missed one small bit of information, scribbled on the side of the roster. It appeared to be a password or code like those used to access naaru-made technology like the Exodar or Tempest Keep.

Go inside the manaforge and look for a control panel. Copy its readouts on this scroll as well as you can. We must confirm our suspicions about the origin of the technology.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-82 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
The symbols scrolling in front of you look alien and unintelligible.

==Completion==
You unwrap the scroll and ready yourself to copy down the strange symbols.

==Progression==
{{Shutting Down the Manaforges-Aldor}}
