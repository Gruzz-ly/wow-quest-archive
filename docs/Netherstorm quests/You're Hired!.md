==Objectives==
Collect 10 Etherlithium Matrix Crystals and return them to [[Rocket-Chief Fuselage]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Etherlithium Matrix Crystal]] (10)

==Description==
Let me be the first to welcome you aboard, Junior Technician 3rd Grade <name>!

We're building my masterpiece out here - the [[X-52 Nether-Rocket]]!

But first we need to get all of the parts and fuel for it. That's where you come in.

To start, I need crystals - LOTS of crystals - for the rocket's Etherlithium Engine Matrix. The [[draenei]] had crystals coming out of their ears!

So head north to the [[Ruins of Enkaat]] and get them for me! Nevermind all of the draenei [[ghost]]s.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Junior Technician 3rd Grade Shoulders|Junior Technician 3rd Grade Gloves|Junior Technician 3rd Grade Bracers|Junior Technician 3rd Grade Goggles}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|90|}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Does it look like the X-52 Nether-Rocket is ready for liftoff? Am I cruising the [[Twisting Nether]] in the comfort of my command chair? &nbsp;Exploiting strange new worlds? Seeking out new technology and business opportunities? &nbsp;Boldly going where no goblin has gone before?

No!

So, I hope you have those crystals that I sent you after.

==Completion==
Gah! Those look rough. Maybe we can use them in the tertiary engine manifold chamber?

Still, a good job Junior Technician 3rd Grade! You'll make 2nd Grade in no time.
