==Objectives==
Speak with Captain Saeed, follow his army to [[Manaforge Ultris]], and kill Dimensius the All-Devouring!
* Speak to [[Captain Saeed]] (Optional)
* [[Dimensius the All-Devouring]] slain
* Suggested players: 5

==Description==
Your brave actions have forced Ameer to react! He has deployed Captain Saeed and the Avengers!

Now all that is left to do is destroy Dimensius.

When you are ready, I will call for Saeed. If he is not currently fighting another battle, he will be awaiting orders from you directly east of here.

Let him know when you are ready to fight and he will put his troops in motion!

I wish you luck, fleshling! We have hunted Dimensius for a thousand years!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Circlet of the Starcaller]]
* [[Dabiri's Enigma]]
* [[Starcaller's Plated Legguards]]
* [[Void Slayer's Tunic]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|13|20}}
* 19000 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Consortium|The Consortium]]

==Progress==
What of the void lord?

==Completion==
For a thousand years, all we have known is conflict. We have defended our people from the attacks of both void creature and ethereal alike.

Now, one of our most hated enemies lies dead--finally.

I give you the thanks of a hundred million ethereals, fleshling.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Captain Saeed]] nearby:
{{dialogue|Fleshling, I am Captain Saeed of the Protectorate, and these soldiers that stand by me are my avengers. We await orders from the fleshling who destroyed the void conduit. On that fleshling's word, we will make our way up to Dimensius's lair and wait for the word to make a final strike!

Too long it has been... The void lord will soon face our combined might!

{{gossip|quest=|I am that fleshling, Saeed. Let's go!}}}}
:{{text|say|Captain Saeed|You heard the fleshling! MOVE OUT!}}
:''They start running up to Ultris, killing anything in the way.''

At the entrance to the manaforge:
:{{text|say|Captain Saeed|Tell me when you are ready, <name>. We will attack on your command.}}

Speak with the captain again:
{{dialogue|This is it, <name>. We charge on your orders! Just say the word and my men and I will engage!

{{gossip|I am ready. Let's make history!}}}}
:{{text|say|Captain Saeed|It's now or never, soldiers! Let's do this! For K'aresh! For the Protectorate!}}
:''They run in.''

Aggro Dimensius:
:{{text|say|Captain Saeed|The time for your destruction has finally come, Dimensius!}}
:{{text|emote|Dimensius the All-Devouring laughs.}}
:{{text|yell|Dimensius the All-Devouring|Time only has meaning to mortals, insect. Dimensius is infinite!}}
:{{text|yell|Dimensius the All-Devouring|I hunger! Feed me the power of this forge, my children!}}
:{{text|emote|Spawn of Dimensius begins channelling power into Dimensius.}}

Defeat the spawns, then finish off the void lord.
:{{Text|say|Protectorate Avenger|We are victorious! Dimensius is no more! Report back to the Professor, hero.}}
