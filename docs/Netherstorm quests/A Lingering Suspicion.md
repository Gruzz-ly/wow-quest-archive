==Objectives==
Collect 10 Loathsome Remnants from the twisted spirits in [[Kirin'Var Village]]'s [[Chapel Yard]] and bring them to [[Custodian Dieworth]].
* [[Loathsome Remnant]] (10)

==Description==
The strange magical device resembles nothing you've ever seen before. It's certainly not of [[blood elf]] manufacture.

As you sense spirits moving closer to the building, the orb glows with a greater intensity, which fades as the spirits leave. There's no question that it plays a role in the corruption of the ghosts.

How it works remains a mystery. Perhaps Custodian Dieworth will have some insight if you can provide the remains of some of the spirits along with your observations.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*10,680 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you discovered, <name>?

==Completion==
<Custodian Dieworth examines the remnants.>

The device you described sounds like a necromantic focus... I should've known that no-good apprentice would stoop to this. I thought his training would keep him from going this far, but I guess he's proven me wrong.
