* Escort the Maxx A. Million Mk. V safely through the Ruins of Enkaat
* Suggested players: 2

== Description ==
Greetings, <race>. I am charged up and fully functional.

There are fragile draenei machines in these ruins, which I must retrieve. I am equipped with delicate servos in my wrist actuators, and the latest in combustion-pneumatic bump soakers. Handling them with care will not be an issue.

However, the ghosts that haunt these ruins will likely attack, so I will need you and your friends along for protection.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Alley's Recurve
|Unearthed Enkaat Wand}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Back so soon?

Is everything okay with the Maxx A. Million Mk. V?!

== Completion ==
You did it!  You did it!  I could just kiss you!

Oh, darn... the Maxx A. Million Mk. V is out of juice again. Ah well, he had enough to get the job done, and that's what counts!

[[Rocket-Chief Fuselage]] will be pleased to get these draenei machines hooked up inside the [[X-52 Nether-Rocket]]! That means a promotion for me! I'm so happy, I just have to give you a reward!

Here, take your pick from one of these.
