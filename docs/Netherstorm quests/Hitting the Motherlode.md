==Objectives==
Zuben Elgenubi at the [[Stormspire]] wants you to obtain a Farahlite Core.
*[[Farahlite Core]]

==Description==
Now that we've got a good baseline product, we're going to need something of higher quality. Certainly the farahlite we've gathered so far is nice, but I know there's better out there.

We'll have to get a sample directly from [[Cragskaar]], the patriarch of the Farahlon giants! You should be able to find it among the other giants in the [[Netherstone]] area. It's got huge pieces of farahlite jutting from its back and that's exactly what we need. Fell the giant and collect a farahlite core from it.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Cloak of Woven Energy|Celestial Jewel Ring|Chain of Glowing Tendrils}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
You're still alive, which means you've either got the core, or you've changed your mind. Which is it?

==Completion==
Well done! I can't wait to put this to the test.
