==Objectives==
Report back to [[Exarch Orelis]] at [[Area 52]].

==Description==
My mission here is finished. I did what Orelis ordered me to - I've never failed to.

No more. I foresee a great carnage - a crusade, they'll call it - following the news of the alliance between [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas]] and the [[Burning Legion]].

First they give our [[Shattrath City|holiest city]] away to our enemies and then they ask us to die fighting their enemies.  Go back to Orelis; tell him the [[naaru]] can fight their own fights from now on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5900 [[XP]] (or {{cost||57}} at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-165 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

{{itembox|Choose one|Aldor Ceremonial Wraps|Vindicator's Light Vest|Kaylaan's Spaulders|Girdle of the Lost Vindicator}}

==Completion==
The bad news you bring fills my heart with sorrow. Two of our deadliest foes join forces and one of the dearest sons of Shattrath has lost his way.

==Progression==
{{Deathblow to the Legion}}
