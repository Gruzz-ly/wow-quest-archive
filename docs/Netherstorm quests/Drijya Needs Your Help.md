==Objectives==
Speak with [[Drijya]] near Invasion Point: Destroyer in the [[Netherstorm]].

==Description==
<Class>, it is good to see a helpful face around here.

The Burning Legion at the nearby fel reaver heap has become more bold, and I am beginning to fear for our safety here. The demons are constantly receiving reinforcements from Invasion Point: Destroyer to the south.

My compatriot, [[Drijya]], has gone down there to scout and see if he can do something about the Burning Legion's warp-gate.

Please find and assist him in any way that you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||75|}} at level 70)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Completion==
I hope that [[Gahruj]] has sent you to help me with my mission.

==Progression==
