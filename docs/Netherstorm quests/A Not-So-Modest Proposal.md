You are offered '''A Not-So-Modest Proposal''' by an ethereal.

==Objectives==
Retrieve the Teleporter Power Pack and bring it to the [[Ethereal Teleport Pad]] on the [[Celestial Ridge]] to the east of [[Manaforge Ultris]]. Activate the pad and give the Teleporter Power Pack to the [[Image of Wind Trader Marid]] so he can install it.
*[[Teleporter Power Pack]]

==Description==
From the look on your face, I can tell you're a <race> who appreciates a good profit.

I've built a reputation as a dealer in exotic goods, and I'm about to launch a new venture.

I need a reliable subcontractor to procure the goods from the Celestial Ridge.

First, you'll need to re-energize a teleport pad. There is a spare power pack in [[Access Shaft Zeon]], which is on the south side of Manaforge UItris. The Protectorate is operating in there, so you may be able to follow their tracers to your goal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
*12650 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|g=7|s=59}} compensation at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Are you prepared to discuss business now, <name>?

==Completion==
This power cell should hold for our purposes. Once the money starts rolling in, we'll improve it even more.

Enough with such things. Every moment spent in discussion translates to lost profit.

==Notes==
*The entrance to [[Access Shaft Zeon]] is on the south side of the Manaforge, in the cave under [[Manaforge Ultris]] in [[Netherstorm]] {{coords|61|42|Netherstorm}}.
*Follow the Protectorate Tracers (green markers), staying on the left, until you get to the [[Teleporter Power Pack]] inside the cave {{coords|60|41|Netherstorm}}
*You can pick up the quest [[The Flesh Lies...]] from [[Agent Araxes]] right next to the power pack. You will get teleported in behind him. This quest to burn corpses is useful, as it gives you a [[Protectorate Igniter]] that prevents one or more small, parasitic [[Fleshbeast]] generating when you get too near a [[Withered Corpse]]. These cast the "parasite" disease, which will spawn a [[Parasitic Fleshling]] after 30 seconds.
*Pick up the quest [[Arconus the Insatiable (quest)]] from [[Agent Ya-six]] just in front of the Power Pack
*Note he is actually above you, on a walkway
*[[Arconus the Insatiable]] is a level 70 Void Lord, is in the same cave {{coords|60|39|Netherstorm}}
*The Ethereal Teleport pad can be found to the east of the Manaforge, in [[Celestial Ridge]]. As you go down the ramp, it is at the bottom on the left {{coords|71.1|39.0|Netherstorm}}
*You will have you fight your way through Level 68-70 non-elite nether drakes and dragons
*This quest's name is a reference to ''[[wikipedia:A Modest Proposal|A Modest Proposal]]'', a satirical pamphlet written by [[wikipedia:Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift]].
