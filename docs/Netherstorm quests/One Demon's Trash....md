==Objectives==
Gather 10 Fel Reaver Parts and return them to [[Mama Wheeler]] at the [[Midrealm Post]] inside [[Eco-Dome Midrealm]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Fel Reaver Part]] (10)

==Description==
You look like a capable young man! I was wondering if you could lend me a hand?

To the east is the Scrap Field, which the Burning Legion has moved into. It's full of huge fel reaver parts. There're also a whole bunch of smaller parts in there that they don't seem to care about.

I want you to get in there and get me a lot of those smaller fel reaver parts!

==Progress==
You have those parts yet?  With the Burning Legion moving in on each of our claims around here one at a time, we unfortunately have little time.

==Completion==
These will have to do for now, I suppose.  If only we could scare them off.

==Progression==
