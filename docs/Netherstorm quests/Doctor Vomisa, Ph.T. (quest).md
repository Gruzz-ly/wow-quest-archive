==Objectives==
Speak with [[Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T.]] at the [[Proving Grounds]] in [[Netherstorm]].

==Description==
On the outskirts of town to the east are the Proving Grounds. Our top experimentalist, Doctor Vomisa, has been toying with a combination of [[fel reaver]], [[ethereal]], and of course, [[goblin]] technologies there.

This is in no small part thanks to your gathering efforts Junior Technician 3rd Grade, <name>!

Go to him; I know that he'll have a solution for saving [[Area 52]].

And since he's likely to use you as a test subject, if I were you, I'd bring some friends along just in case.

==Completion==
Well, well, it would appear that we are in luck, young man.

I was just recently able to finish the construction of my latest invention, the [[Scrap Reaver X6000]]!

And you're going to have the honor of helping me test it so that it can be used in defense of Area 52!
