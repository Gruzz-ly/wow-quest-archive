==Description==
The naaru of [[Shattrath City]] have been trying to find a means to bring the Consortium over to their way of seeing things.

Luck would have it that the business relationship between the ethereals and the blood elves of the [[Netherstorm]] has recently soured.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||72|}} at level 70)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

Hello, <race>.

You don't happen to be available for a recovery mission of some importance?
