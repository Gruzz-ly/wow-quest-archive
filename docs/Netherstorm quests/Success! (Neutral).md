==Objectives==
Return to the [[Stormspire]] and speak with [[Ghabar]]. 

==Description==
The test was a resounding success! We can certainly use this device to start repairing the domes.

Carry word of the test results to the Stormspire and let Ghabar know that I've also found a pattern in the damage to the shield generators. Key pieces of generator units have gone missing from a number of sites. This is no accident, <name>, no technological failure. We're being stolen from.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Heavenly Inspiration
|Leggings of Concentrated Power
|Nexus-Guard's Pauldrons
|Gold-Trimmed Cuffs
}}

You will also receive:
*3100 [[XP]] (or {{cost||18|60}} at max level)

==Completion==
I'll have my techs get to work on those repairs right away.

Tashar's suspicion of sabotage worries me, though. I can't think of anyone who would be bold enough to steal our technology. Not anyone who knows what we're capable of, anyway. It may be time to lock down the Stormspire.
