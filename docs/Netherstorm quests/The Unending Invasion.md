==Objectives==
Search the mana creature infested area of [[Kirin'Var Village]] for a Mana Bomb Fragment and bring it to [[Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran]].
*[[Mana Bomb Fragment]]

==Description==
[[Kael'thas]]'s assault on Kirin'Var began with thundering noise and a bright flash of light in the [[officer]] quarters to the northwest. The destruction there was the most severe and after the withdrawal of the [[Blood elf|blood elves]], a strange thing began to happen.

Beings of pure [[mana]] began streaming into the village from all over the area. For now, we're containing them as we can, but with more information about the weapon Kael'thas used, I hope to cut off the flow of mana creatures entirely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|86|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Did you find the remains of the weapon Kael'thas used against the village? 

==Completion==
A [[mana bomb]]?

<Morran turns the fragment over in his hands.>

It's nigh unthinkable! Even the best minds in Dalaran couldn't have conceived of a weapon like this. The sheer magnitude of the disturbance must've torn a rift in the nether, giving these creatures access to our lands.
