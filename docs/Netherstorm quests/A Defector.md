==Objectives==
Go to [[Manaforge Ara]] and speak to [[Magister Theledorn]].

Completing quests for the [[Scryers]] will cause your [[Aldor]] reputation to decrease.

==Description==
We've recently been contacted by a [[Sunfury]] [[magister]] who wishes to join our ranks and swears he has information we're in need of. We've checked our informants to make sure he's not a double agent and he checks out.

He's stationed in Manaforge Ara which makes communication difficult. Talk to him and see what he knows. If he's half as useful as he claims to be, we'll be able to put him to good use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6250 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at max level)
*-83 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]

==Completion==
It's about time you showed up. I was beginning to wonder if the Scryers were interested at all.

==Progression==
