== Objectives ==
Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of [[Area 52]], and speak to [[Kaylaan]].

Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.

== Description ==
The Sunfury briefings support the theory that Kael'thas has been receiving outside help in constructing and running these manaforges. Who this is remains a bit of a mystery, though we're likely to find out in Manaforge Ara.

I've sent a group of my men to scout the surrounding area. Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of here, and speak to [[Kaylaan]]. See what he's discovered at Manaforge Ara. Find out who is assisting the Sunfury army and take care of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3150 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|89|}} at level 70, {{cost|0|19|20}} at level 80
*25 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*37 [[reputation]] '''decrease''' with [[The Scryers]]

== Completion ==
You're all the help Orelis is sending? He must think very highly of you.

Let's get this over with.
