==Objectives==
Tag 12 [[Talbuk]]s for [[Aurine Moonblaze]] at the [[Stormspire]]. You may tag either [[Talbuk Sire]]s or [[Talbuk Doe]]s using the Talbuk Tagger.
*Talbuk Tagged (12)
*[[Talbuk Tagger]] (provided)

==Description==
Your work with the lashers turned up some astounding information, but I wonder if it holds true for animals as well.

Gathering information on the talbuks that live underneath this dome is going to be trickier than studying the lashers, I'm afraid.

Using this tagging device, you can put a weakened talbuk to sleep and apply a tag that I'll use to track the animal as it matures. The tagging mechanism won't work unless the talbuk has expended most of its energy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Were you able to tag enough of the talbuk?

==Completion==
Excellent work. I'll keep a close eye on the ones you tagged and see if they mature as quickly as the other lifeforms in the dome.

With the proper control, we could use this technology to regrow the ruined areas of [[Outland]] and [[Azeroth]].
