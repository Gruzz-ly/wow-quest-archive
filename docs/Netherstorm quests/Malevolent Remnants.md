This quest starts the '''Malevolent Remnants''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Custodian Dieworth]] at [[Kirin'Var Village]] wants you to defeat 20 Severed Spirits in Kirin'Var's [[Town Square]].
*[[Severed Spirit]] slain (20)

==Description==
Most of the spirits in the village are little more than pale remnants of Kirin Tor mages. They retain no knowledge of their former selves and wander the ruins in blind anger.

It wasn't always like this, though. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the spirits were restless, but not spiteful. With the passage of time they have only grown more aggressive. I dare not venture into the southern part of the village, for they will not spare even me. Quiet them and let us hope it will purge their anger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at max level)

==Progress==
It pains me to know there is so little to be done for our comrades.

==Completion==
<Custodian Dieworth shakes his head gently.>

It is not what they deserved, but it is the best we can do.

==Notes==
*[[Severed Defender]]s also count.
