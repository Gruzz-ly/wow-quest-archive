==Objectives==
Gather 4 pieces of Raw Farahlite and return to Zuben Elgenubi at the [[Stormspire]].
*[[Raw Farahlite]] (4)

==Description==
To the northeast is an area called the [[Netherstone]], a landmark not seen when this was a lush, green land. Newly-exposed crystal formations have shown us a mineral we've called farahlite in honor of this land's former identity.

The tiny amount of farahlite we've mined has already proven popular with our clients. The highest grade of the mineral comes not from static deposits, but from the giants around the Netherstone. I can offer you a cut of the profits if you'll help supply the higher grade farahlite.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*12650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
I understand the dangers of gathering farahlite are great, but so are the opportunities. A merchant who isn't willing to take the risk may as well close his doors and save himself the trouble.

==Completion==
Ah, yes. This is precisely the grade I was hoping for. We may give up mining the crystal formations altogether if we can secure a supply from the giants.
