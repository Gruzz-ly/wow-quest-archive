==Objectives==
Return to [[Manaforge B'naar]] and obtain the B'naar Access Crystal from [[Overseer Theredis]]. Use it at the Manaforge [[B'naar Control Console|B'naar console]] to shut it down and report back to Anchorite Karja.<

Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.
*Manaforge B'naar Shut Down
*[[B'naar Access Crystal]]

==Description==
We cannot shut down the manaforges by force as we'd risk causing an explosion that would shake Outland to the core.<BR />According to your transcription, there is an emergency shutdown that permanently disables the technology - a safety mechanism common in naaru constructs.

To perform this procedure you will have to obtain a crystal that will allow you to communicate with the console. This access crystal is in the possession of an overseer called Theredis according to our information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
Have you succeeded in your task, <name>?

==Completion==
The [[Light]] smiles upon you, <name>.  We were all praying for your success.
