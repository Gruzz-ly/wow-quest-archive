==Objectives==
Deliver the Netherologist's Notes to [[Rocket-Chief Fuselage]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Netherologist's Notes]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm out here studying the nether - the ethereal currents and all that. This is an ideal spot away from the lights and hubbub of town. Isn't this bridge great? If I could just keep this junk working.

Hey, you know, if you're looking for work there's plenty at Area 52! It's just up the path and take a right at the fork in the road.

Why don't you deliver my latest research notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage? I'm sure that he'd have plenty for you to do, what with the X-52 rocket ship, and all!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1}}
*3050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|83|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Busy, busy. No time to waste!  There's a rocket ship to be built!

What do you want?

==Completion==
Oh, Coppernickels finally decided to report his findings, did he?  Lazy scientists!

What's this?

<The chief riffles through the notations a few times, clearly with a look of disbelief.>

He says here that the violent nether-energies flowing through the [[Netherstorm]] are going to rip everything to shreds in only a few months.

That's inconvenient - now we'll have to move up the time-table on building the rocket ship!
