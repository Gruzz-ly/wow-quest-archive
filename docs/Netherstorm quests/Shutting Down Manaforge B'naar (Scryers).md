==Objectives==
Return to [[Manaforge B'naar]] and obtain the B'naar Access Crystal from Overseer Theredis. Use it at the [[B'naar Control Console]] to shut it down, then report back to [[Spymaster Thalodien]].

Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.
*Manaforge B'naar Shut Down
*[[B'naar Access Crystal]]

==Description==
I was having a friendly discussion with the Aldor while you were gone. Manaforges sure look like modified naaru technology from [[Tempest Keep]]. Apparently, most naaru constructs have certain safeguards that allow them to be permanently disabled in case of emergency.

The procedure is usually initiated at a control console via an access crystal. Lo and behold, according to the roster you secured, such a crystal is in the possession of a fellow called Overseer Theredis. Obtain it and see what you can do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90|}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]
*-275 reputation with [[The Aldor]]

==Progress==
Did the plan work? I was half-expecting you to get blown up, to tell you the truth.

==Completion==
Of course it worked! I'm a spymaster; my information is always accurate.

Anyhow, I have a whole new exciting job lined up for you. You want to hear about it? Of course you do.
