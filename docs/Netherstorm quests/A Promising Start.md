You hope to have '''A Promising Start''' with your new business partner.

==Objectives==
Gather 15 Nether Dragonkin Eggs, then return to [[Tyri]] and [[Jorad]] on the [[Celestial Ridge]].
*[[Nether Dragonkin Egg]] (15)

==Description==
We've come here to investigate rumors of a strange breed of dragons, perhaps even descendents of Deathwing himself. These are clearly not ordinary black dragons, though.

We'll know more once we've had a chance to examine their eggs. Their hatred for my flight runs deep, so I can't get close enough to gather the eggs. Will you agree to help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
Were you able to gather the eggs?

==Completion==
These will work quite nicely, <name>. Thank you for agreeing to help us.

Before we can continue, however, there is something else we'll need to address.

==Notes==
*The eggs are scattered all over the Ridge. They appear to be blackish eggs with blue crystals sticking out of them.
*[[Dwarf|Dwarves]] can use their Treasure Finding ability to pinpoint the eggs.
*This quest is much easier if you are {{reputation|neutral}} with [[Netherwing]]. You can become neutral be completing a quest chain in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] which starts with [[Kindness]] from [[Mordenai]].

==Progression==
