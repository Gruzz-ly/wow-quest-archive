==Objectives==
Report to [[Rocket-Chief Fuselage]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]] immediately!

==Description==
I'm certain that the rocket-chief is going to want to have a word or two with you!

If I were you, I wouldn't hesitate to get back to Area 52 and speak with him!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Area 52 Defender's Pants|X-52 Technician's Helm|X-52 Pilot's Leggings}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|12|30}}
*18450 [[XP]]
*[[X-52 Rocket Helmet]]

==Completion==
<Name>!  Or, should I say Junior Technician 1st Grade <name>?!  Oh hell, who am I kidding?  Skipping a grade isn't a good enough reward for what you've done.  I'm going to make you my first officer!

You've saved all of us, and more importantly the [[X-52 Nether-Rocket]]!  I could just kiss you... but I won't.

Instead, please let me present you with the gratitude of Area 52.  Take your pick!
