==Objectives==
Use the Sunfury Disguise, go into [[Manaforge Coruu]] and listen to the conversation between [[Commander Dawnforge]] and [[Arcanist Ardonis]]. Report back to [[Caledis Brightdawn]] after completing this task.

Completing tasks for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease. 
*Information Gathering
*[[Sunfury Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
I've prepared a uniform with the pieces you obtained. It is magically enhanced to complete the illusion.

We spotted Commander Dawnforge going in to meet Arcanist Ardonis a few minutes ago. He had a full retinue of guards with him, so whatever they're discussing is bound to be incredibly important; see if you can catch any of it.

Oh, I almost forgot. You'll want to stay away from the arcane golems patrolling the manaforge. They will see right through the illusion. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Belt of the Sage|Brightdawn Bracers|Bloodguard's Greaves|Spymaster's Crossbow}}

*9000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|40|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
How goes the eavesdropping, <name>?  You'd best hurry.  I'm getting antsy here.

==Completion==
Manaforge Duro is in trouble? I'm sure Thalodien will love to hear the news. Let's wrap up the job here first. 

==Notes==
The following dialogue occurs when you approach Arcanist Ardonis while in disguise.
<poem>
{{text|say|[[Commander Dawnforge]]|We need you to send reinforcements to [[Manaforge Duro]], Ardonis. This is not a request, it's an order.}}
{{text|say|[[Arcanist Ardonis]]|You cannot be serious! We are severely understaffed and can barely keep this manaforge functional!}}
{{text|say|Commander Dawnforge|You will do as ordered. Manaforge Duro has come under heavy attack by mana creatures and the situation is out of control. Failure to comply will not be tolerated!}}
{{text|say|[[Pathaleon the Calculator|Pathaleon the Calculator's]] image|Indeed, it is not a request.}}
{{text|say|Commander Dawnforge|My lord!}}
{{text|say|Pathaleon the Calculator's image|Duro will be reinforced! [[Manaforge Ultris|Ultris]] was a complete disaster. I will NOT have that mistake repeated!}}
{{text|say|Pathaleon the Calculator's image|We've had too many setbacks along the way: [[Hellfire Citadel]], [[Fallen Sky Ridge]], [[Firewing Point]]... [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Prince Kael'thas]] will tolerate no further delays. I will tolerate nothing other than complete success!}}
{{text|say|Pathaleon the Calculator's image|I am returning to [[Tempest Keep]]. See to it that I do not have reason to return!}}
{{text|say|Commander Dawnforge|Yes, my lord.}}
{{text|say|Arcanist Ardonis|Yes, my lord.}}
{{text|say|Commander Dawnforge|See to it, Ardonis!}}
