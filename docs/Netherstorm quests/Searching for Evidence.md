==Objectives==
Search [[Kirin'Var Village]]'s [[Chapel Yard]] for clues about who is behind the manipulation of the spirits.

==Description==
Whoever is behind the transformation of the spirits has been very deliberate in their actions, taking care to target the most powerful mages first, but why? The kind of magic required to influence the spirits of slain [[Kirin Tor]] mages must be very powerful.

Why would a powerful mage go to all this trouble? I'm inclined to say this is another plot of [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas]]'s, designed to cause more misery here. If there are [[blood elf|blood elves]] here, they're likely to be hiding in the houses across the covered bridge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Completion==
A glowing orb sits atop a square-shaped pedestal. At first glance, it seems to be a repository for magical energy, but what kind of energy, and for whose use?

==Progression==
{{Malevolent Remnants}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
