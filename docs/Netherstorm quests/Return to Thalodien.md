This quest is part of the '''Report to Spymaster Thalodien''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[Report to Spymaster Thalodien]].

==Objectives==
Return to Spymaster Thalodien at [[Area 52]] in [[Netherstorm]].

==Description==
It would be best if this information got back to Thalodien as soon as possible. I'll stay here and cover our tracks.

It wouldn't do us much good to have [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas]] find out what we were snooping around here. Secret information is always better if your enemy doesn't know you have it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||72|}} at max level)

==Completion==
You do not cease to amaze me, <name>. That was quite the feat of stealth you pulled off at [[Manaforge Coruu]].

==Progression==
{{Shutting Down the Manaforges-Scryers}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
