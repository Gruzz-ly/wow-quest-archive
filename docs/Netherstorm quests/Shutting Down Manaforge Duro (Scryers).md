==Objectives==
Return to [[Manaforge Duro]] and obtain the Duro Access Crystal from [[Overseer Athanel]]. Use it at the [[Duro Control Console]] to shut it down and report back to [[Spymaster Thalodien]].

Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.
*Manaforge Duro Shut Down
*[[Duro Access Crystal]]

==Description==
So Manaforge Duro is under attack and Sunfury forces have lost control? What a dilemma! If Duro goes down, then [[Tempest Keep]] goes down. Only drawback is... if [[Tempest Keep]] is destroyed, the explosion will probably take what little remains of this forsaken land with it.

Dead Kael'thas is good. Dead everyone else is... not that great, I suppose. It pains me to ask this of you, but go to Manaforge Duro and shut it down before it goes up in flames. The access crystal is held by Overseer Athanel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]
*-275 reputation with [[The Aldor]]

==Progress==
Did you complete the shut down? You should hurry before I change my mind about the whole deal.

==Completion==
That makes three manaforges you've shut down, <name>. Kael'thas must be having a real fit right about now.
