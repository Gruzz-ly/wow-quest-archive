==Objectives==
Use the Battery Recharging Blaster on enough Phase Hunters to get the Battery Recharge Level to 10. Then return it to [[Bot-Specialist Alley]] at the Ruins of Enkaat in the [[Netherstorm]].
*Battery Charge Level (10)
*[[Battery Recharging Blaster]] (provided)

==Description==
I have the very important task of collecting the machinery inside these ruins, but I'm having a problem keeping all of my bots charged up.

The phase hunters - those wyrm-looking things - have lots of energy! You can find them all over the edges of this island, floating in from the nether.

Fill the battery on this recharging blaster by using it on a phase hunter when they're very weak, and then finish it off to soak up the last of its energy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90|}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you recharged the battery in that blaster yet?

==Completion==
Hey, watch where you're pointing that thing!  You've got it set to 'Kill'!!!

It looks like you've recharged the battery, and then some.  This'll help immensely to keep these guys going.
