==Objectives==
Seek out and offer your services to [[Gahruj]]. He is located at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the [[Netherstorm]].

==Description==
While you were at the Arklon Ruins, I received a request for assistance from one of our representatives out in the field. It would appear that the Consortium is having some 'difficulties' in trying to recover property from the blood elves, which they refuse to pay for.

Please head east out of [[Area 52]] and cross the bridge to the next island over. You'll find my associate, [[Gahruj]], at the Midrealm Post, just inside of Eco-Dome Midrealm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|86|}} at level 70)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Completion==
Yes, it's true. The blood elves have reneged on yet another purchase of goods that has already been delivered.

As [[Nether-Stalker Khay'ji]] has vouched for you, I am hopeful that you will be able to assist me in this matter.

==Progression==
