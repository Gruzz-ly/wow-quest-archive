'''Delivering the Message''' is an escort quest.

==Objectives==
Escort the [[Protectorate Demolitionist]] to the [[Manaforge Ultris]] Conduit and protect him while he sabotages the pipeline.
* Ethereum Conduit Sabotaged
*Speak to the [[Image of Commander Ameer]] by using the [[Ethereum Transponder Zeta]] at the [[Ethereum Staging Grounds]] in [[Netherstorm]].

==Description==
The [[Ethereum]] are using [[void]] energy to turn themselves into an abomination known as a [[nexus-stalker]]!

We must destroy the manaforge energy tube powering the proto-accelerator.

I'm sending one of my demolitionists out to place a disruption device. Just make sure no harm comes to him as he's placing the disruptor.

Keep him protected! He will not fight back if enemies attack him, as he is only a holographic image, but the image can be destroyed!

==Reward==
You will receive one of:
* [[Druidic Force Boots]]
* [[Protectorate Headplate]]
* [[Surger's Hand Wraps]]
* [[Warpthread Vest]]

You will also receive:
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
He must succeed!

==Completion==
Thanks to you, their plans are in ruin!

Now only one thing remains... [[Salhadaar]].
