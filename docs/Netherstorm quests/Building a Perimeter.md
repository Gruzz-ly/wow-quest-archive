==Objectives==
Use the Rune Activation Device near the East Rune, Northeast Rune, and West Rune. The runes can be found around the perimeter of Kirin'Var Village's Wizard Row and Town Square districts. Return to [[Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran]] once you've completed the task. 
*Activate Eastern Rune
*Activate Northeastern Rune
*Activate Western Rune
*[[Rune Activation Device]] (provided)

==Description==
We are prepared to try to construct a perimeter around the village using the energy source taken from the blood elves. I can't guarantee that it will work, but we have to attempt it.

Otherwise, the mana creatures will surely continue devouring the spirits of the fallen Kirin Tor.

Use this device at the small runes around the perimeter of town to release the energy there. If I've woven the field correctly, we should start noticing a difference once you've used the device at each point.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Crimson Mail Bracers
|Harmony's Touch
|Kirin'Var Defender's Greaves
|Boots of the Beneficent
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|7|92|50}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you activated all the runes? I'm eager to see if we can't improve upon the blood elf method here. Anything one of Kael'thas's men can do, real Kirin Tor can do better.

==Completion==
Excellent work. Keep your fingers crossed, &lt;name&gt;. I'm going to activate the shield.
