==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ghabar]] at the [[Stormspire]].

==Description==
Master Engineer Ghabar will want to know about the results of the diagnostics. If anything, they caution us to keep a close eye on the workings of our dome generators. As the fields become more and more unstable, their effects will become harder to control. It could spell disaster for our expedition and anything else housed within the domes.

You'll find Ghabar at the [[Stormspire]]. Just follow the road north from this eco-dome and across the bridge. It'll lead you to the elevator at the base of the spire. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)

==Completion==
<You introduce yourself and report the results of [[Mehrdad]]'s diagnostics at [[Eco-Dome Midrealm]].>

Mehrdad is little more than a technician, but he possesses a keen eye for detail. If his observations are correct, then we'll need to take diagnostics at the rest of our dome generators as soon as possible.

==Progression==
{{Run a Diagnostic!}}
