==Objectives==
Kill 5 Mo'arg Doomsmiths and 15 Gan'arg Engineers. Then return to [[Papa Wheeler]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Mo'arg Doomsmith]] slain (5)
*[[Gan'arg Engineer]] slain (15)

==Description==
The [[Burning Legion]] has moved in on our claim at the [[Scrap Field]] down the path and across the bridge to the east.

This could be a huge problem for us! With the Legion at the [[Arklon Ruins]], and now there, it's starting to look bad for us - and the rocket project - here at Area 52.

<Name>, I need you to go out there and deal with those [[demon]]s! I'd do it, but I'm a lover, not a fighter.

Yep, this is going to be trouble, I can feel it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
I sure hope that you're up to that tussle with the Burning Legion.

There aren't many things that I hate worse than those that renege on a deal, or <cough> [[gnome]]s, but demons are certainly one of them!

==Completion==
Well, that's good and bad news, now isn't it? &nbsp;We've dealt them a blow, but with the Burning Legion running free all over the [[Netherstorm]] - and getting closer to us here - well, I don't know how it's going to go.

I have a feeling that we're going to have to change gears here for a while. &nbsp;Hope you'll be able to help us out, <name>.
