==Objectives==
[[Lord Torvos]] in [[Shattrath City|Shattrath]] wants you to capture the Sunfury Attack Plans.
* [[Sunfury Attack Plans]]

==Description==
As we press the offensive on [[Isle of Quel'Danas|Quel'Danas]], we've discovered that [[Prince Kael'thas|Kael'thas]]' minions are planning a counterattack. By ordering the [[Sunfury]] blood elves, based in [[Netherstorm]], to attack our operations in [[Outland]], he hopes to draw troops and attention away from the [[Sunwell]].

We must not allow this to happen, <name>. Each and every blade is needed on the front lines.

Go to Netherstorm and capture their attack plans. Any of the Sunfury blood elves up there could be in possession of the plans. Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Shattered Sun Supplies]].

You will also receive: {{cost|4|40}} ({{cost|10|10}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you returned with the plans?

==Completion==
<Lord Torvos accepts the plans and looks over them.>

You've done the offensive a great service, <name>, but we should not rest. I wouldn't put it beyond our foes to plan more mischief in the future.
