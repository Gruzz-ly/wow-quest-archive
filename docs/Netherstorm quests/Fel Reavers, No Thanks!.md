==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Condensed Nether Gas from Gan'arg Mekgineers at Forge Base: Oblivion, northwest of the [[Stormspire]], and load them into a nearby Inactive Fel Reaver. Return to [[Nether-Stalker Nauthis]] after you've completed this task. 
*[[Inactive Fel Reaver]] Destroyed
==Description==
Ah, yes - the fel reaver! Certainly the Legion's most terrible mechanical creation. There are no less than three of these abominations aimed at the [[Stormspire]].

Fortunately for us, they are not active yet. This affords us the possibility of dealing with them through sabotage instead of brute force.

Obtain condensed nether gas from the gan'arg at Forge Base: Oblivion and fill a nearby fel reaver's fuel tank with it. I've a feeling its engine won't handle it too well. 

==Reward==
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Completion==
That is excellent news, &lt;name&gt;. &nbsp;Now that we know how to deal with these, I can have hirelings sabotage any remaining reavers. 

== Notes ==
If you have completed [[Nether Gas In a Fel Fire Engine]] prior to this quest, the Gan'arg may stop dropping the Condensed Nether Gas, thus making this quest uncompletable.
