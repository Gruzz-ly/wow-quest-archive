==Objectives==
Kill 10 Mageslayers and 10 Mana Seekers and return to [[Custodian Dieworth]] at [[Kirin'Var Village]].
*[[Mageslayer]] slain (10)
*[[Mana Seeker]] slain (10)

==Description==
After the blood elves leveled Kirin'Var Village, they started the construction of a large building to the northwest. Without the expertise of the archmage, we can't say for certain what's going on there.

One thing is clear, though. The blood elf activities have unleashed a tide of ravenous mana elementals on the village. They seem drawn to the ruins of Wizard Row, wreaking further destruction. We cannot permit this to continue.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Spiritbinder's Mantle|Mana-Infused Wristguards|Spiritualist's Gauntlets|Farahlite Studded Boots}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|90|}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you managed to clear out some of the mana creatures from the village ruins?

==Completion==
<The custodian looks dismayed.>

I can already see the next wave coming over the horizon. Culling them will work for the time being, but more permanent measures are needed.
