*[[Netherock]] slain
*[[Netherock Crumbler]] slain (3)

==Description==
To whomever cares about the timely construction of the X-52 Nether-Rocket—The king of the local mountain giants, [[Netherock]], has been terrorizing the Crumbling Wastes. He's been interfering with operations all along the south ledge of the island!

Take your friends and deal with him! Then, return to me here in [[Area 52]].

Rocket-Chief Fuselage

P.S. - don't forget to deal with his crumblers as you beat him down. I don't want them coming up here for revenge because you didn't finish the job!

==Rewards==

*{{cost|7|80|}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
What?  What?!  Be quick about it... there's so much to do around here.

I want to get this thing off the ground some day, you know?

==Completion==
Oh! &nbsp;Oh... you took care of [[Netherock]]. &nbsp;Good news that!

With that troublesome mountain giant out of the picture, we should have an easier time of exploi... er, husbanding the resources of the Crumbling Wastes.

Glad to hear that those poor, innocent elementals down there won't be getting squished by him.

How ever can I repay you?
