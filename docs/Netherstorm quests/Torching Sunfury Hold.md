==Objectives==
Using a Flaming Torch, destroy 4 Sunfury Ballistas and 4 Sunfury Tents and return to [[Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran]] at [[Kirin'Var Village]].
*[[Sunfury Ballista]] Destroyed (4)
*[[Sunfury Tent]] Destroyed (4)
*[[Flaming Torch]]

==Description==
Ridding [[Sunfury Hold]] of its garrison is not sufficient to keep the [[blood elf|blood elves]] from reoccupying it. [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas]]'s followers are zealous and tenacious. Leaving them anything to use at Sunfury is effectively an invitation to return.

No, it must all be destroyed. See to it that their tents and [[Ballista|artillery]] burn to ashes!

<The ghost's fists clench.>

Steal torches from the [[Sunfury Flamekeeper|Sunfury flamekeepers]] to accomplish your task,<name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Smoke rises from the Sunfury Hold fortifications. Is that your handiwork?

==Completion==
<Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran nods grimly.>

The Kirin Tor hardly relish destruction for its own sake, but we have no qualms about acting against our enemies, even in death.
