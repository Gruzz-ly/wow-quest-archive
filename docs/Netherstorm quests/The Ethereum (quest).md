'''The Ethereum''' is the first part of a [[Netherstorm]]-based [[quest chain]] that ends with [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]]. 

==Objectives==
Kill 5 Ethereum Assassins, 5 Ethereum Shocktroopers, 2 Ethereum Researchers, and Captain Zovax, then activate Ethereum Transponder Zeta.
* [[Ethereum Assassin]] slain (5)
* [[Ethereum Shocktrooper]] slain (5)
* [[Ethereum Researcher]] slain (5)
* [[Captain Zovax]] slain {{co|56.4|37.8|Netherstorm}}
* Ethereum Transponder Zeta activated (Optional) {{co|56.8|38.7|Netherstorm}}

==Description==
Directly south of here you will find the [[Ethereum Staging Grounds]]. The Ethereum are there, preparing for something... Perhaps an assault on [[Manaforge Ultris|Ultris]].

We can't take any chances, though, <class>. Break through their perimeter defenses and take out their training facility.

Once you've destroyed their soldiers and Captain Zovax, locate Ethereum transponder Zeta and use it to establish contact with me to get your next set of orders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Well done, fleshling...

==Completion==
We must gather whatever data they've stored in this area.

==Progression==
