==Objectives==
Use the Triangulation Device to point your way toward the second triangulation point. Once you have found it, report the location to [[Wind Trader Tuluman]] at Tuluman's Landing, just on the other side of the bridge from the Manaforge Ara island in the [[Netherstorm]].
*Second triangulation point discovered
*[[Triangulation Device]] (provided)

==Description==
I've recalibrated the triangulation device with the information that you provided from the first point. You'll use it in exactly the same manner to discover the second.

All that I can tell you is that the second point is somewhere far to the west.

Once you've located it, speak with Wind Trader Tuluman; another of the nexus-prince's agents. He's posing as a weapon merchant at a small trading post next to the bridge, which leads to the island that Manaforge Ara is on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
You wish to buy or sell?

==Completion==
Very good indeed. The nexus-prince shall be pleased!

We now have the second point, which will now tell us where the third is, and the general vicinity of the crystal!

==Notes==
You must activate the equipment a short distance (20-100 yards) from the triangulation point{{coords|28.9|41.2|Netherstorm}}, then approach the resulting floating red arrow to get credit.
