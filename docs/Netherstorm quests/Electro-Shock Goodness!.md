==Objectives==
[[Researcher Navuud]] at the [[Protectorate Watch Post]] in [[Netherstorm]] has asked that you destroy 30 Void Waste Globules and 30 Seeping Sludge Globules.
*[[Void Waste Globule]] slain (30)
*[[Seeping Sludge Globule]] slain (30)
*[[Navuud's Concoction]] (provided)

==Description==
Around the ruined [[manaforge]] you will find the run-off of [[Dimensius]]'s handy work. Seeping sludge occupies the pools that surround [[Manaforge Ultris|Ultris]]. Directly below those pools, where the [[Ethereum Staging Grounds]] now stand, you will find even more run-off in the form of [[void]] waste.

The best method of disposal is to use electro-shock to break slimes down to globules. Use this elixir to augment your attacks with electricity. The resultant discharge will break the slimes up into their raw form. Destroy the globules!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Both the sludge and waste are extremely toxic. They will form into a congealed void horror if left unchecked!

==Completion==
I hope it's not too late. Did you notice any abnormally large slimes at or near the area where the void wastes drain into?

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
