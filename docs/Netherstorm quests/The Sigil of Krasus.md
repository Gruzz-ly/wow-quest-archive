== Objectives ==
Retrieve the Sigil of Krasus from [[Spellbinder Maryana]] at Manaforge Coruu, northwest of the Violet Tower. When you have gained the sigil, use Archmage Vargoth's Staff to project an Image of Archmage Vargoth and inform him of your progress.

If you lose Archmage Vargoth's Staff, speak to Ravandwyr at Area 52 to receive a replacement.

== Description ==
Before we departed Azeroth all those years ago, the Kirin Tor entrusted our expedition with a powerful artifact, the Sigil of Krasus. It was a great boon to us in our battle against the orcs and it could play a key role in helping me break the enchantment that imprisons me.

However, when Kael'thas divested me of my possessions, he gave the sigil to Spellbinder Maryana, who remained behind with the garrison. If he truly realized what he had in his possession, he wouldn't have given it away so easily.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Kirin'Var Journeyman's Belt
|Kirin'Var Scout's Belt
|Battle-Mage's Helmet
|Kirin'Var Defender's Chausses}}

==Progress==
If I am to be free of the tower's curse, I must have the sigil.

==Completion==
Ah, it is as magnificent as I remembered. Can you not feel the power radiating from it?

Of course, there is much more to be done, but you have my deepest thanks for restoring the sigil to me.

==Notes==
This quest is the 4th step in a quest chain in [[Netherstorm]] that begins with [[The Archmage's Staff]].
