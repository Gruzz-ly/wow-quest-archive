==Objectives==
Locate [[Conjurer Luminrath]]'s quarters in [[Wizard Row]] and return the mantle to his Dresser. Then, speak with [[Custodian Dieworth]] at [[Kirin'Var Village]].
*Put Luminrath's Spirit to Rest
*[[Luminrath's Mantle]] (provided)

==Description==
The cloak, undoubtedly of [[high elf|high elven]] craftsmanship, is richly tailored, even by the standards of the Kirin Tor. The symbols and characters sewn into the cloak's fabric hold no meaning for you, but clearly imbue the garment with magical properties.

Perhaps this object binds the spirit of its former owner to this plane of existence. If so, returning it to the dresser in Conjurer Luminrath's quarters might break the spirit's link to this world, allowing it to rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
What have you found, <name>?

==Completion==
We used to always comment that Luminrath would wear that cloak with just about anything. To him, red went equally well with white, black, purple, blue, yellow, orange, and green. He would never wear the same robe two days in a row, but the cloak was always there...

==Notes==
When the cloak is returned to its rightful place, [[Conjurer Luminrath]]'s spirit appears and checks the dresser for a moment before fading.
:{{text|say|Conjurer Luminrath|I can't possibly go out without my cloak. I hope it's in here...}}
:{{text|say|Conjurer Luminrath|There it is! I could've sworn it wasn't here last time I checked...}}
