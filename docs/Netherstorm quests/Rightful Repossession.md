==Objectives==
Collect 10 Boxes of [[Surveying Equipment]] and return them to [[Gahruj]] at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Box of Surveying Equipment]] (10)

==Description==
Our business relations with the blood elves appear to be at an end. A few weeks ago a large shipment of surveying equipment was delivered to them at Manaforge Duro. They have refused to pay for it.

<Name>, I would ask that you pay the blood elves of Manaforge Duro to the east a visit. They appear to be having some trouble with an infestation of mana creatures there, so take advantage of their preoccupation.

I care not what happens to them, but I would very much like to see the return of our property.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Midrealm Hat|Eco-Dome Leggings|Duro Footgear}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Do you have possession of the surveying equipment which the blood elves defaulted on?

==Completion==
Well, I for one am glad that this petty little business is behind us. I cannot remember a time when the Consortium has had dealings with such boorish and untrustworthy beings.

You, however, seem to be very trustworthy, &lt;name&gt;. Perhaps you wouldn't mind doing me one more favor?
