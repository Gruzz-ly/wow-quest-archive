==Objectives==
Recover the Heart of the Fel Reaver and deliver it to [[N. D. Meancamp]] at The Heap in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Heart of the Fel Reaver]]
*[[Fel Zapper]] (provided)
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
You see that scrapped fel reaver over there to the south? Isn't it a thing of beauty?

I want its heart!

What? Yes, of course it has a heart... what doesn't?

<N. D. looks indignant for a moment.>

Go on over there, pry it open, bring back what I want and I'll give you a nice finder's fee in return.

Oh, and I'd take a friend or two along if I were you. These Zaxxis ethereals are a pretty mean bunch!

Take this fel zapper to jumpstart its heart when you're ready to begin.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Heap Leggings|Warp-Raider's Eyepatch|Scavenged Breastplate}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|90}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at max level)

==Progress==
My eyesight must be going from all of the nether radiation.  You have that fel reaver's heart yet?

==Completion==
Wow, look at that... a beating fel reaver heart!  Well, it's not really 'beating', but you know what I mean.

I can't wait to put this thing to good use.  Or, maybe sell it.  I know a few suck... er, clients that might be interested.

Here, you've earned your pay and then some!

==Notes==
Using the provided Zapper on a fallen Fel Reaver makes it attackable; it must be "destroyed" and then looted to retrieve its heart. It will not fight back, but using the Zapper triggers numerous waves of [[Zaxxis]] ethereals to attack, 1-3 at a time.
