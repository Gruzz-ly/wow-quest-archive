This quest starts the '''Kick Them While They're Down''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Slay 8 Sunfury Conjurers, 6 Sunfury Bowmen and 4 Sunfury Centurions. Return to [[Magistrix Larynna]] at [[Area 52]] after completing this task.

Completing tasks for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.
*[[Sunfury Conjurer]] slain (8)
*[[Sunfury Bowman]] slain (6)
*[[Sunfury Centurion]] slain (4)

==Description==
The news you've discovered is fortunate, &lt;name&gt;. Not only do you get to waltz into Manaforge Duro unfettered, this also presents a great opportunity to deal a blow to Kael's army.

Use the mana creature assault to your advantage and pick off any Sunfury stragglers you run into.

I do not take particular glee in the senseless slaughter of my own kin the way that Thalodien does, but the tactical advantage here is too high to pass up.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Warp-Master's Maul|Sunfury Blade|Jeweled Halberd|Conjurer's Staff}}

You will also receive:
*1265 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at max level)
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
