*[[Annihilator Servo]]

==Description==
WANTED: 1 Annihilator Servo to replace the failing one in my Long Neck Spectrum Analyzer.

You and your friends might want to check with the blood elves at Manaforge B'naar to the west to see if they have any spares. They seem to have a few arcane annihilators roaming about.

Please deliver the servo in pristine condition to Papa Wheeler at Area 52.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Red Pointy Hat|Exotic Spiked Shoulders|Lost Chestplate of the Reverent}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*12000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope that you're here concerning the wanted ad that I placed!

==Completion==
Woo hoo!  Do you know how hard these things are to come by?  It's not like I'm getting a regular shipment of parts out here.

Tell you what, as payment I want you to take something out of my box of junk.  I'm sure there'll be something in there you can use.  And if not, sell it.

Alright, let me just take that off of your hands and get it into my Long Neck Spectrum Analyzer before the failing servo in it explodes!
