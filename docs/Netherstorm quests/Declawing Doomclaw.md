==Objectives==
Obtain Doomclaw's Hand and deliver it to [[Mama Wheeler]] at the [[Midrealm Post]] inside [[Eco-Dome Midrealm]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Doomclaw's Hand]]

==Description==
You know what might just discourage them? Take out their leader!

It seems to work everywhere else from what I've heard. And when they see a grizzled <class>, such as yourself take out their leader... why, I bet they'll tuck tail and run for the hills!

Get back in there and take out the big one they call [[Doomclaw]]. I hear he keeps himself in the eastern part of the [[Scrap Field]] underneath the pipe.

Bring me his claw, too! Maybe we can make use of it.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Dealt with Doomclaw yet?

==Completion==
He, uh... he said what?  THEY'RE GONNA GO AFTER [[Area 52|AREA 52]]?!

Oh, this is not good... not good!

==Progression==
{{Help Mama Wheeler}}
