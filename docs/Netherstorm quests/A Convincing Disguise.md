== Objectives ==

*[[Sunfury Researcher Gloves]]
*[[Sunfury Guardsman Medallion]]
*[[Sunfury Arcanist Robes]]

== Description ==
Infiltrating the ranks of Kael's army will not be an easy task. With my knowledge of illusionary magic I could pass you off as one of Kael's followers, but there are certain details in their uniforms I could not replicate.

Bring me a set of their robes, a pair of their gloves and a Sunfury guardsman medallion. This will make the results of my magic much more convincing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at level 70)
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+250 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

== Progress ==
Have you obtained the outfit pieces I asked of you?

== Completion ==
Excellent! When I'm through with you, you will be able to slip among the Sunfury ranks unnoticed.
