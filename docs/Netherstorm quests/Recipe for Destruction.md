'''Recipe for Destruction''' begins the Destroying the All-Devouring chapter of the [[Netherstorm quests|Netherstorm storyline]].

==Objectives==
Recover 4 Fragments of Dimensius.
*[[Fragment of Dimensius]] (4)

==Description==
Atop [[Manaforge Ultris]] lies the tear in the [[Twisting Nether|nether]] that [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|Void Lord Dimensius]] came through. That tear provides Dimensius with a link to the [[Void]], rendering him immune to physical harm. If we can get a lock on the conduit that Dimensius is using to keep himself phased out of this [[plane]] of existence, we can destroy it and then destroy Dimensius.

To do this, we're going to first need you to collect fragments of Dimensius from the void creatures that he sends out to do his dirty work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 12650 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Consortium|The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Have you collected enough fragments?

==Completion==
Excellent. With these fragments, we can calibrate a bomb that will destroy the void conduit atop Ultris. With the void conduit destroyed, Dimensius's connection with the Void will be severed and he will be left defenseless!
