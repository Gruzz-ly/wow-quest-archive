==Objectives==
Nether-Stalker Nauthis wants you to slay 12 Wrathbringers at [[Forge Base: Gehenna]], north of the [[Stormspire]]. 
*[[Wrathbringer]] slain (12)

==Description==
Brave acts of industrial sabotage will only get us so far, <name>. Just as [[Forge Base: Oblivion]] serves as an assembly site for Fel Reavers, Forge Base: Gehenna serves as a staging ground for their army as it is where the majority of the Legion's teleportation devices are located.

I want you to go in there and put a dent in their numbers. They must have a full regiment of wrathbringers by now and we just can't allow that.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost||75}} at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
How goes it?  Did you get a chance to show the Legion a lesson or two?

==Completion==
Nice work, <name>.  Keep it up and I'll put in a good word with the [[Nexus-Prince Haramad|Nexus-Prince]].

==Progression==
#[[Fel Reavers, No Thanks!]]
#[[The Best Defense]]
#[[Teleport This!]]
