==Objectives==
Recover 15 pieces of Ethereum Relay Data.
* [[Ethereum Essence]] consumed
* [[Ethereum Relay Data]] (12)

==Description==
They're using relays to transfer information around the [[Ethereum Staging Grounds|staging grounds]].

There is only one way for you to see these relays and extract the information they hold. Unfortunately, doing so may cause you irreparable brain damage.

If you're still interested, you'll need to slay [[Ethereum]] here at the staging grounds and take their essences. Once you have an essence, drink it down. It will temporarily allow you to see an Ethereum relay, giving you enough time to destroy a relay and extract its information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the relay data?

==Completion==
The [[Protectorate]]'s reason for existence is now fully realized.

The Ethereum are not here to hunt [[Dimensius]]! They are here to become [[Void]]!

They are manipulating the void energy at this manaforge to bond their own energy into a creature known as a [[nexus-stalker]].

They are undoubtedly using a proto-accelerator to complete the transformation.

==Notes==
Kill Ethereum in the area until [[Ethereum Essence]] drops, then use it. While buffed, [[Ethereum Relay]]s in the form of [[Netherwyrm]]s appear. Defeat them for their [[Ethereum Relay Data]].
