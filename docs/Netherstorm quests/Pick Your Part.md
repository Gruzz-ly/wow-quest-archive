==Objectives==
Collect 10 pieces of Ethereal Technology and return them to [[Papa Wheeler]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Ethereal Technology]] (10)

==Description==
Those ethereal clowns are as opportunistic as us, I'll give them that. But no one, and I mean NO ONE, moves in on a B.O.O.M. claim!

The Heap to the south is ours!

If we're to finish the [[X-52 Nether-Rocket]], we're going to need all of the new tech that we can get our hands on. And since the ethereals are stealing from us, I think it's only fair that we repay them in kind.

Why don't you head down there and see if you can acquire some of their technology out from under their noses!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mech Tech Shoulders
|Papa's Armbands
|Wheeler Family Heirloom}}

==Progress==
Back with their tech so soon?  You better not just be pulling my leg here, <class>.

The success of the X-52 project out here depends upon you getting us that stuff a.s.a.p.!

==Completion==
Hehe, ethereal suckers!

Thanks for getting us these parts, <class>.  I bet we can just hook these babies right up inside the rocket.  I wonder what they do?  Should be fun finding out!

Hmm, let me see if I can dig up some pocket change to throw your way.

==Notes==
This quest must be completed to be able to get [[Help Mama Wheeler]].
