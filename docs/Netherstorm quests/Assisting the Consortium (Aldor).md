Speak with [[Nether-Stalker Khay'ji]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].

==Description==
The naaru of [[Shattrath City]] have been trying to find a means to bring the Consortium over to their way of seeing things.

Luck would have it that the business relationship between the ethereals and the blood elves of the [[Netherstorm]] has recently soured.

There's a Consortium representative in town named [[Nether-Stalker Khay'ji]] who recently ran into trouble with a pack of renegade ethereals. As a representative of the Aldor, I would like for you to help him in any way that you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||72|}} at level 70)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Completion==
Hello, <race>.

You don't happen to be available for a recovery mission of some importance?
