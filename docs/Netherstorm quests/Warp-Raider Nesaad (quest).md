'''Warp-Raider Nesaad''' becomes available after [[A Heap of Ethereals]] is completed.

==Objectives==
Kill Warp-Raider Nesaad and then return to [[Nether-Stalker Khay'ji]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Warp-Raider Nesaad]] slain

==Description==
Warp-Raider Nesaad must be dealt with! I have no idea how he survived my attack, but he cannot be allowed to continue his operation out there.

Go back and take out Nesaad. He keeps a small ethereal camp near the southwestern corner of the Heap.

Don't fail like I did, <class>.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Zaxxis Bracers|Zaxxis Boots|Zaxxis Gloves}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
It's over then?  Warp-Raider Nesaad is dead?

==Completion==
It's a relief to hear that scum is finally dealt with. You do good work, &lt;name&gt;... may I be so forward as to call you by your name?

If you're willing, I have another task that needs doing. One that is very important and someone of your obvious skill should be able to handle with ease.
