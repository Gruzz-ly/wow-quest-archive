==Objectives==
Collect 10 Zaxxis Insignias and return them to [[Nether-Stalker Khay'ji]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Zaxxis Insignia]] (10)

==Description==
There is something else that I want your help with.

A group of ethereals, known as the [[Zaxxis]], have cut their relationship with the Consortium and gone into business for themselves. They've even cut deals with the Sunfury blood elves. This will not be tolerated!

I infiltrated their group at the Heap to the south. But after I took out their leader, I had to escape here to [[Area 52]].

<Class>, go down there and bring back their insignias. Of course, not all wear them because they're cowards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Is it done? Have you wiped the Zaxxis scum from the face of Outland and brought me their insignia?

==Completion==
These insignia are a good start.

Unfortunately while you were at the Heap, one of my other agents amongst the Zaxxis sent word to me that Warp-Raider Nesaad still lives!

==Progression==
{{Warp-Raider Nesaad}}
