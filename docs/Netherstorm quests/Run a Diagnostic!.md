==Objectives==
Retrieve the Diagnostic Results and return them to [[Mehrdad]] at [[Midrealm Post]].
*[[Diagnostic Results (Eco-Dome Midrealm)]]

==Description==
Wherever the [[Consortium]] establishes a presence, we bring our eco-dome technology. The fields allow us to work in a controlled and life-sustaining atmosphere since we often find ourselves in hostile environments.

[[Netherstorm]]'s volatile conditions and creatures have begun to destroy the equipment that sustains our domes, especially the generator east of here. I've started a diagnostic there in hopes of understanding what can be done to combat the damage. Would you collect the results and bring them to me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90}}
*6000 [[XP]] (or {{cost||36}} at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Did you get the diagnostic results?

==Completion==
<Mehrdad nods, then examines the diagnostic results.>

This is worrisome. The damage is much more severe than I believed. I can send to the [[Stormspire]] for some tools to begin repairs, but that's useless unless we've isolated what's damaging the equipment in the first place.
