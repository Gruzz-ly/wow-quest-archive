==Objectives==
[[Custodian Dieworth]] at [[Kirin'Var Village]] wants you to kill 10 Sunfury Archers.
*[[Sunfury Archer]] slain (10)

==Description==
After [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Prince Kael'thas]]'s forces destroyed the village and imprisoned the archmage in the [[Violet Tower]], they withdrew to [[Sunfury Hold]] to the northeast. The very men who destroyed our village and slew our fellows toast their 'amazing victory' while we are helpless to avenge the fallen.

We must not allow these crimes to go unanswered! Be the instrument of our vengeance, <name>. Go to Sunfury Hold and claim the lives of those responsible for this crime.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>? Have you avenged the fallen of Kirin'Var Village?

==Completion==
What you've done this day can never bring back the fallen, but perhaps it can help soothe their spirits. Although, truth be told, no amount of blood can quench my anger over the actions of Kael'thas.
