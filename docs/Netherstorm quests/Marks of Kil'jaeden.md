*[[Mark of Kil'jaeden]] (10)

==  Description ==
As you probably know, <name>, the Aldor are keepers of the Light and servants of the naaru.

Diametrically opposed to us are the agents of the Burning Legion - demons bent on the destruction of worlds and the corruption of the innocent.

If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of low-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers. We know of a Shadow Council hideout in the Bone Wastes and there are many Legion outposts in [[Nagrand]] and the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-275 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==  Progress ==
Do you bear any of our enemies' insignias, &lt;name&gt;?

==  Completion ==
Facing the demons of the Burning Legion and the mad cultists that worship them is no small feat, &lt;name&gt;. &nbsp;You've shown great dedication and courage. &nbsp;Keep it up and your renown among the Aldor will continue to grow.
