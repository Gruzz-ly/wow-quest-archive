==Objectives==
Collect 7 Mana Wraith Essences and return them to [[Chief Engineer Trep]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Mana Wraith Essence]] (7)

==Description==
As the X-52's chief of engineering, I have to see to it that the nether-rocket's main engines are in tip-top shape.

Unfortunately, I haven't built them yet.

<Class>, I'm in dire straits here! I have almost all of the parts. All that I'm missing is the engine core.

Luckily for us, I think we can make use of the essence from the local mana wraiths to jump-start the engines.

They can be found near most of the glowing trenches in the northern part of the island. Except for here in [[Area 52]], of course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90|}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
You have all of those essences yet?

==Completion==
Wow, that's a lot of essence!

Ok, let's see what happens when I mix it with the etherlithium matrix crystals.
