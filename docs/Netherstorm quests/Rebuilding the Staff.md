==Objective==
Obtain 4 Flawless Crystal Shards from the ghosts at the [[Ruins of Enkaat|Enkaat Ruins]] and return them to [[Ravandwyr]] at [[Area 52]].
*[[Flawless Crystal Shard]] (4)

==Description==
<Ravandwyr inspects the staff, noting that part of the headpiece seems to be missing.>

Simply barbaric! Ekkorash must've taken the staff's crystalline headpiece for use in some other trinket, not realizing that it works in concert with the rest of the staff.

As long as it remains broken, the staff's power is greatly diminished. With a suitable draenei crystal, I should be able to repair it. I've heard the goblins remarking about the crystals carried by the ghosts at the Enkaat Ruins to the north.

==Progress==
Have you managed to find some suitable crystals for a new headpiece for the archmage's staff?

==Completion==
<Ravandwyr carefully examines the crystals, then selects one.>

This crystal should work. I'll reshape the stave's socket to secure the new headpiece.

When Archmage Vargoth sees it, he will be disappointed, but I can bear my master's disappointment if it means we've freed him.

==Notes==
This quest is the 2nd step in a quest chain in [[Netherstorm]] that begins with [[The Archmage's Staff]].
