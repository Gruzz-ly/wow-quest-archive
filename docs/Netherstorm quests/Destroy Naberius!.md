==Objectives==
Custodian Dieworth in Kirin'Var Village wants you to confront and defeat [[Naberius]] in the village's Chapel Yard. 
*[[Naberius]] slain

==Description==
Archmage Vargoth saw the danger in Naberius's pursuit of necromancy, but I don't think he ever anticipated that his own apprentice would wreak this much destruction upon the Kirin Tor.

You must defeat him, <name>, or else he will continue enslaving the spirits of our fallen brothers, robbing them of their rightful rest and destroying what little remains of Kirin'Var.

With his phylactery in hand, he can be confronted by two or three combatants, but who knows what his magic might do to more foes?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Kirin Tor Apprentice's Robes|Lifewarden's Breastplate|Coif of the Wicked|Legguards of the Resolute Defender}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*15400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you destroyed the lich of that wretched Naberius?

==Completion==
The defeat of Naberius is a great achievement, <name>. I can't help thinking that we might have had a chance against Kael'thas's forces if the apprentice's loyalties had been in the right place that day.

==Progression==
