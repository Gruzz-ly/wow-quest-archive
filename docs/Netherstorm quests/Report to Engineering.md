==Description==
<Name>! I need you to take all of these etherlithium crystals over to [[Chief Engineer Trep]], my, uh, chief of engineering.

He should know what to do with them. And if he doesn't, you see to it that he finds out!

You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||72|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Um, hi. &nbsp; I'm a little busy here. &nbsp;What's that you have there?

==Completion==
Ooh, etherlithium matrix crystals. &nbsp;Yeah, those sound important!

Let's just put them over here and I'll get to figuring them out in a moment.
