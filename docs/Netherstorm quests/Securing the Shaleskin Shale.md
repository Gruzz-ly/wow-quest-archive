==Objectives==
Collect 5 Shaleskin Shale and give them to [[Boots]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Shaleskin Shale]] (5)

==Description==
I make a good living selling drinks to the boozehounds around here. But I want something more!

The rocket-chief is always telling me how he can't perfect the rocket fuel needed to get the X-52 off of the ground.

We can solve that little problem for him.

For starters I need to extract the oil from the shale of the local [[shaleskin flayers]]! It'll form a concentrated, if explosive, base for the mix that I have in mind.

Find the [[rock flayer|flayers]], and their shale, all over the place near the purple rocks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90|}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at max level)

==Progress==
You have enough of that shale yet? &nbsp;I'm going to need a lot of it to extract the amount of oil that'll be needed for the [[X-52 Nether-Rocket|X-52 Nether Rocket]]'s fuel.

==Completion==
OK! &nbsp;Ingredient number one is down.

Now, if you're up to it, we'll move on to something that'll give the shale oil that little extra kick that it'll need to blast the nether rocket into the [[Twisting Nether]]... or oblivion, whichever comes first.
