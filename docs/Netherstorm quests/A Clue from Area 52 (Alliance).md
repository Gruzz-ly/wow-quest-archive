==Objectives==
Investigate [[Area 52]] in [[Netherstorm]] for a sign of the letter's writer.
* Search for the letter's author

==Description==
We've received a letter from Area 52, the [[goblin]] outpost in Netherstorm. The author claims to know details about what they call "the situation in the [[Bizmo's Brawlpub|Brawlpub]]".

They don't say more than that.

I'm tied to my paperwork here. Go check out this lead and see if anything turns up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You found me! Let's get back home!

==Completion==
These mysterious impostors may have gotten the better of me, and they may have gotten away with murder, but little do they know... I hold the trump card!

==Notes==
Get to the [[Netherstorm]] on [[Outland]], then fly to [[Area 52]]. There, a surprising NPC is sitting on a barrel... Bizmo!
:Are... are you from my Brawlpub? It's me! Bizmo!
:The REAL Bizmo!
{{gossip|What? Bizmo? I thought you were running Bizmo's Brawlpub. What's going on?}}
:Any Bizmo you've been working with is a traitor! I don't know who he... or, it... is, but I know that they're not me. I'm me!
:I'll tell you everything I know.
:I don't know what happened. They caught me from behind. There was a scuffle and then... darkness. And then I was here, on the other side of the world, without a hearthstone or a copper to my name.
*{{gossip|<Offer Bizmo your Hearthstone.>}} (will remove it from your bags!)
*{{gossip|<Offer Bizmo 2 gold so he can get home.>}} (will remove it from your bags!)
:Hey, thanks! You didn't have to do that, sweet cheeks!
:So, what have I missed while I was gone?
{{gossip|<Tell Bizmo about Quackenbush's murder.>}}
:Quackenbush? No!
:What a shame. He was a good kid. Good hugger. Real soft feathers. Probably offed by the same folks that left me marooned here.
