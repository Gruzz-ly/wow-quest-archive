==Objectives==
Bring 10 [[Ripfang Lynx Pelt]]s to [[Shauly Pore]] at [[Midrealm Post]].
*[[Ripfang Lynx Pelt]] (10)

==Description==
The [[ethereal]]s are clever and very observant, so it's no accident that I'm here posing as a simple furrier. In fact, I've been sent from [[Area 52]] to appraise the technology the ethereals use to generate their [[eco-dome]]s.

I'd like to enlist your help, <class>. We've been asked to use non-goblin agents whenever possible.

What I want you to do is bring me a number of ripfang lynx pelts in the guise of a hunter. You can find the lynxes all over Eco-Dome Midrealm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Shauly raises his voice so as to catch the attention of the ethereals in the area.>

Have any pelts to sell me?

==Completion==
<Shauly makes a show of admiring the skins.>

These are magnificent, utterly magnificent! I'll pay you top coin for these! How much to retain your services?
