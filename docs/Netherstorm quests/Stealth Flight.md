This quest is part of the '''Report to Spymaster Thalodien''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[Report to Spymaster Thalodien]].

==Objectives==
Speak to Veronia outside Area 52 and fly to Manaforge Coruu.

Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.

==Description==
While you were gone, my men uncovered another one of these manaforges. It is east of here and is known as Manaforge Coruu.

Two of my best spies have arranged a secret landing spot outside of the manaforge. You are to help them infiltrate Kael's forces and obtain whatever information you can.

Speak to Veronia just outside the city walls; she's arranged for a windrider that will take you to Manaforge Coruu. Once there, speak to Caledis Brightdawn; he will brief you on your mission.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||72|}} at level 70)
*-11 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+10 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Completion==
Arranging for your flight wasn't cheap. Let's hope you have what it takes to get the job done.
