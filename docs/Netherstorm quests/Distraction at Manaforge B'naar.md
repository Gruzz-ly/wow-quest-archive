This quest is part of the '''Assist Exarch Orelis''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[Assist Exarch Orelis]].

==Objectives==
Slay 8 Sunfury Magisters and 8 Sunfury Bloodwarders and return to [[Exarch Orelis]] at [[Area 52]].

Completing quests for the [[Aldor]] will cause your [[Scryers]] reputation to decrease.
*[[Sunfury Magister]] slain (8)
*[[Sunfury Bloodwarder]] slain (8)

==Description==
We were sent here by the [[Sha'tar]] to investigate the [[manaforge]]s that [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas]]' army is operating here. Unfortunately, the Scryers threaten to renege on their information-gathering duties unless we support them with military action.

We can't afford to compromise this mission over politics, so we've agreed to weaken the manaforge's defenses so that the Scryers can do their work.

Prove your loyalty to the Aldor and slay the [[Sunfury]] magisters and bloodwarders that guard [[Manaforge B'naar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-275 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your task, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. The Scryers have uncovered valuable information thanks to your distraction. Maybe they'll actually share it with us this time.
