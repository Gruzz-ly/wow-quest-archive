==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rocket-Chief Fuselage]] at [[Area 52]].

==Description==
I've had a most unusual vision, <name>, and I don't know quite what to make of it. I've seen an arrow, an immense arrow, riding into the sky on a trail of fire. Such a feat is trivial for a skilled [[mage]], but somehow I know the arrow I saw is not the product of [[magic]].

It will be unlike anything the people of [[Azeroth]] have ever achieved. You must seek out the people working on this, <name>. Lend them your help, for without it, their efforts may yet fail.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,040 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The chief listens as you describe the seer's vision.>

Well, I don't know about any of that, but we could certainly use your help around here. Behold the rocket behind me! That's the [[X-52 Nether-Rocket|X-52]]...

Isn't it the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?
