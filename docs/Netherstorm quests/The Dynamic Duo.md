==Objectives==
Speak with [[Audi the Needle]] at the [[Stormspire]].

==Description==
Excellent job.

<Shauly winks at you.>

I think they're buying it. Now, when I send you up to speak with my associates at the Stormspire, there won't be any suspicion at all.

You'll want to look for [[Action Jaxon]] and Audi the Needle up there. They'll tell you everything you need to know. Tell 'em Shauly sent you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You introduce yourself and tell Audi that Shauly sent you.>

Ah, yes, we've been expecting someone to help us, err—move some, uh, merchandise.
