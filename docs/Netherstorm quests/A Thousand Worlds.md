'''A Thousand Worlds''' is obtainable after achieving [[Revered]] with the [[Consortium]] and completing [[Ethereum Secrets]].

==Objectives==
[[Commander Ameer]] at the [[Protectorate Watch Post]] in [[Netherstorm]] wants you to bring him 5 [[Ethereum Prison Key]]s.
* [[Ethereum Prison Key]] (5)

==Description==
I have cracked the code! Each tag is broken up into several segments. The front side of the tag is always the same and states: "A Thousand Worlds..." I am unsure as to the meaning of this phrase but it sounds insidious.

On the back side of the tag are the vital statistics. The first set of runes indicates location and the second indicates prisoner type. Furthermore, it would seem that the keys can be combined to form a special key that accesses another prison type. Now I just need more keys...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 12650 ({{cost|7|59}} at 70)
* {{Cost|13|20}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Consortium]]

==Progress==
I know it's asking a lot but think of the lives that could be saved!

==Completion==
<Ameer deftly combines the keys and begins to read the markings on the newly formed key tablet.>

"A thousand worlds shattered, a thousand worlds more to overcome... Such is the will of the Nexus-King."

<Ameer turns the tablet over and begins to read from the back-side.>

Stasis chambers of Bash'ir?

==Notes==
[[Commander Ameer]] can be found at [[Protectorate Watch Post]] directly east of [[Stormspire]] in [[Netherstorm]]. [[Ethereum Prison Key]] is a rare drop of any Ethereal and a guaranteed drop from [[Ethereum Jailor]]s and is a reward from the daily instance quests given by [[Nether-Stalker Mah'duun]]
