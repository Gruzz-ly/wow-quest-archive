==Objectives==
Kill 15 Sunfury Nethermancers and return to [[Nether-Stalker Oazul]] at [[Tuluman's Landing]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Sunfury Nethermancer]] slain (15)

==Description==
The [[Blood elf|blood elves]] are fools! I'm glad that our trade relations with them have fallen apart. In all of my travels throughout the [[Great Dark Beyond|cosmos]], I have never encountered beings so selfish.

They continue to destroy the land around us with their [[manaforge]]s, so let's see if we can put a dent in their operations across the bridge at [[Manaforge Ara]].

Their nethermancers channel energy to and from the blood gems to stabilize the flow of power. Go over there and wipe them out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
How many nethermancers have you managed to fell?

==Completion==
Anything that we can do to encourage them to stop what they're doing at these manaforges is a good thing.

They certainly do not seem to be able to be reasoned with.  And it seems clear to me that whatever their leaders have in mind, they are insane.

As remuneration for your faithful service to the goals of the [[Consortium]], I would like to offer you the coin of your realm if it does not offend you.
