==Objectives==
[[Aurine Moonblaze]] at the [[Stormspire]] wants you to bring her a Hulking Hydra Heart.
*[[Hulking Hydra Heart]]

==Description==
The dome technology possesses such power! Certainly, there are bounds beyond which we dare not go, <name>.

Creatures allowed to grow too large or too fast could be just as bad as a barren landscape.

I have heard rumors of just such a creature in the pool to the east. I've heard the [[ethereal]] merchants conspiring to catch the overgrown [[hydra]] for sport, but I have another purpose in mind for the giant. Bring me the creature's heart so I may study it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you get the sample from the monstrous hydra?

==Completion==
Even for a creature of that size, this heart is far too large. It struggled to keep up with the creature's gigantic body. I have little doubt it would've died before reaching half its normal lifespan.

Even with such risks, I'm determined to convince the [[Consortium]] to share their technology. There's too much promise here to give up now.
