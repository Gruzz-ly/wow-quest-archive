'''Stasis Chambers of the Mana-Tombs''' is obtainable after achieving handing in a [[Mark of the Nexus-King]] to [[Commander Ameer]].

==Objectives==
The Image of [[Commander Ameer]] at [[Bash'ir's Landing]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] wants you to use the [[Mana-Tombs Stasis Chamber Key]] on the Stasis Chamber inside the [[Mana-Tombs]] of [[Auchindoun]].

This quest may only be completed on [[Heroic]] difficulty.
* [[Mana-Tombs Stasis Chamber]] Investigated
* [[Mana-Tombs Stasis Chamber Key]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Mark of the Nexus-King]] that you recovered has allowed me to forge a new key for the stasis chambers found inside the [[Mana-Tombs]].

According to the glyphs on the mark, two exist: one near the front and one near [[Nexus-Prince Shaffar]].  This key that I am about to give you will open the stasis chamber near the front.

I want you to go to the Mana-Tombs of [[Auchindoun]] and open the Mana-Tombs Stasis Chamber.

==Rewards==
* {{Cost|g=13|s=20}}
* 26 x [[Justice Points]]
* 500 [[Consortium]] Reputation

==Progress==
I would understand if you chose not to continue, <name>.

==Completion==
Word has gotten back of your heroics, <name>.  [[Nexus-Prince Haramad|Haramad]] and I both agree that what you've done deserves a great reward.

Though...  Nevermind, you've done enough.  I cannot in good conscience ask anything more from you.

==Notes==
The Mana-Tombs Stasis Chamber is in the room after [[Pandemonius]], to the right.  When you open it, it releases a Consortium [[ethereal]], [[Ambassador Pax'ivi]].

:{{text|say|Ambassador Pax'ivi|I... I am free!  [[Ethereum]] were planning on torturing me until I gave in to their requests.  I fear that, had you not come along, I would have surely given in to their torment.}}
:{{text|say|Ambassador Pax'ivi|Know this, <race>.  Within Shaffar's chambers at the end of these tombs rests [[Yor|a creature of unimaginable power]].  It is held in check be the power of the stasis chamber.  You must return to Ameer before you venture further if you wish to destroy it!}}
