==Objectives==
Escort [[Drijya]] to the warp-gate at Invasion Point: Destroyer, and see to it that he is kept safe while he attempts to sabotage it. Then speak to [[Gahruj]] at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the [[Netherstorm]].
*Burning Legion warp-gate sabotaged

==Description==
With the Burning Legion nearby at the fel reaver scrap field, we must do what we can to stop the flow of demons into the area.

They have a warp-gate to the south in an area that they've cleverly named Invasion Point: Destroyer.

I need you to go with me to the site and keep me safe while I sabotage it.

Afterward, go to the Midrealm Post to the north inside Eco-Dome Midrealm and apprise [[Gahruj]] of our success.
We're going to need a friend or two of yours along to help with this.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Consortium Combatant's Robes|Netherstorm Eyepatch|Midrealm Leggings}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|8|80|}}
*15800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|48|}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Completion==
That is most excellent news, my friend!

You and [[Drijya]] have done us a great service. With that warp-gate out of commission, the nearby demons will not be getting any further reinforcements.

Please allow me to reward you in the proper manner of the Consortium.

==Notes==
Although the quest is tagged as 'group quest', it is pretty well soloable by skilled players.
