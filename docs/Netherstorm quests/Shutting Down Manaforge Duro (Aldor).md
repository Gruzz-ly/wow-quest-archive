==Objectives==
[[Anchorite Karja]] wants you to go [[Manaforge Duro]] and obtain the Duro Access Crystal from [[Overseer Athanel]]. Use it at the Manaforge [[Duro Control Console|Duro Console]] to shut it down.

Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.
*Manaforge Duro Shut Down
*[[Duro Access Crystal]]

==Description==
We've received news from one of the two manaforges that remain operational. The Sunfury army is losing control of Manaforge Duro.<BR />Droves of errant mana creatures have been attracted to it by its increased energy production - the manaforge is in chaos.

An explosion at Duro has the potential to cause a chain reaction that would endanger all of Outland. Overseer Athanel is in possession of the access crystal you need to safely disable the manaforge.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*12650[[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-275 reputation with [[The Scryers]]
