== Objectives ==
Obtain the Coruu Access Crystal from [[Overseer Seylanna]]. Use it at the [[Coruu Control Console]] to shut down the manaforge and return to [[Caledis Brightdawn]].

Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease. 
*[[Manaforge Coruu]] Shut Down
*[[Coruu Access Crystal]]

== Description ==
Thalodien told us of your success in disabling Manaforge B'naar. He expects a repeat performance here and asked us to keep an eye out for anyone using a crystal to access the console inside. Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal, we're sure of it.

Go back in there and finish the operation. No need to be stealthy anymore; get the crystal, begin the shutdown, kill the technicians trying to stop you and get out.

Hurry, it won't be long before Kael's lapdogs sniff us out. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)

== Progress ==
Have you completed your task yet, <name>? 

== Completion ==
We heard all the commotion and were just about to leave. Glad to see you didn't take too bad of a beating.
