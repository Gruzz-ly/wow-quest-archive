This quest starts the '''Report to Spymaster Thalodien''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Report to [[Spymaster Thalodien]] at [[Area 52]].

==Description==
Some time ago, Voren'thal dispatched a small team to Netherstorm to investigate the activities of Kael'thas. Our leader has the utmost confidence in Spymaster Thalodien and his compatriots, and has decided to honor his request for reinforcements.

Thalodien's report was brief, but clear that he's encountered something of great importance. Report to him at Area 52 and assist him in any way possible, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69|}} at level 70)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]
*-11 reputation with [[The Aldor]]

==Completion==
<A brief look of disappointment crosses the spymaster's face.>

I was hoping for at least a squad, but if Voren'thal saw fit to send only you, then I will adjust my plans accordingly.
