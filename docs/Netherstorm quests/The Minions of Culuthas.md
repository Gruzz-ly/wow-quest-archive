==Objectives==
Slay 10 Hounds of Culuthas and 5 Eyes of Culuthas. Then return to [[Nether-Stalker Nauthis]] at the [[Stormspire]] in the [[Netherstorm]]. 
*[[Hound of Culuthas]] slain (10)
*[[Eye of Culuthas]] slain (5)
==  Description ==
A few weeks ago, the Burning Legion moved into the [[Ruins of Farahlon]], thwarting our plans to excavate the site for its artifacts.

Then earlier today, I learned that one of their [[dreadlord]]s, [[Culuthas]], somehow killed off all of the other Burning Legion. He has since summoned in demons that serve him.

&lt;class&gt;, I want you to go up to those ruins to the northeast and rid them of their demon infestation.

==  Reward ==
You will receive:{{cost|4|40|}}
==  Completion ==
Truly an exceptional job.

With the demons of Culuthas slain, [[Zephyrion]] will be able to safely take his excavation team into the Ruins of Farahlon.

Accept this coin as a token of my gratitude. 
==  Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*12650 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]
