==Objectives==
Deal with [[Foreman Sundown]] inside the [[Trelleum Mine]], which is underneath [[Manaforge Ara]] in the [[Netherstorm]].

==Description==
The blood elves call the mine underneath Manaforge Ara the Trelleum Mine. Ever since they lost the one underneath [[Manaforge Ultris]], this is where their sole supply of material for running the forges is coming from.

Needless to say, it would be a boon for us to cripple their mining operation. Perhaps we'd even be able to move in and take it over for ourselves?

Whatever the case, I want you to go in there and deal with [[Foreman Sundown]]. The mine is around the back of the island to the left.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at max level)

==Completion==
<The foreman speaks in hushed tones.>

You came in here to kill me? &nbsp;Hmph. &nbsp;Well I guess the ethereal don't know everything, do they?

I'm not the one that you want, trust me.
