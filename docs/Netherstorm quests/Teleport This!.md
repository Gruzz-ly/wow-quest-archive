==Objectives==
[[Nether-Stalker Nauthis]] wants you to use the Mental Interference Rod on the [[Mo'arg]] at [[Forge Base: Gehenna]] and use their Detonate Teleporter ability on the three teleporters in the [[Forge site|forge camp]]. 
*Western Teleporter Destroyed
*Central Teleporter Destroyed
*Eastern Teleporter Destroyed
*[[Mental Interference Rod]] (provided)

==Description==
As fun as killing demons might be, it does us little good when the Legion can keep using its teleporters to replace anything we kill.

Unfortunately, I don't have any high-powered explosives handy... but the mo'arg that maintain the teleporters do.

Take this rod... I've tuned its powers to interfere with mo'arg brain frequencies. Return to Forge Base: Gehenna and use it on any mo'arg you see. You won't have long, but you'll be able to use their demolition charges on the nearby teleporters.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Imbued Draenethyst Crystal|Runed Silver Staff|Saboteur's Axe|Nether-Stalker's Blade}}

You will also get:
*15400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||93|}} at level 80)
*350 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]
* One more towards {{achievement|Into the Nether}}
* One more towards {{achievement|3000 Quests Completed}} (or the earlier ones, if not completed)

==Progress==
Is it done then?  Are the teleporters shut down?

==Completion==
Thanks to you, <name>, I'll breathe a little easier.  Figure of speech, of course!

I suppose you'll want some form of reward now. 

==Notes==
The range for [[Mental Interference Rod]] is not very far. Stand rather close to the teleporter when you start mind-controlling a mo'arg so that you don't walk the demon out of the rod's control range.
