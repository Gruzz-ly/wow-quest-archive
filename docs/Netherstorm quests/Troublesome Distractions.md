Tyri wants you to take care of some '''Troublesome Distractions''' before continuing.

==Objectives==
Speak with Wind Trader Marid and lure him away from his trading post. Deal with him and then return to [[Tyri]] and [[Jorad]] on the [[Celestial Ridge]].
*[[Wind Trader Marid]] slain

==Description==
Your former employer, Wind Trader Marid, must've gotten wind that you're helping us now. Through my projection, I've seen his nether-stalkers entering the area, hoping to track us down.

We've been able evade them so far, but Marid must be dealt with before the problem grows more severe.

If your impressions of Marid are correct, he'll do just about anything to secure the supply of his product. Return to him and tell him you're prepared to offer a deal. Lure him away and slay him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
*12650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This Marid is a fool, or shall I say, was a fool.

==Completion==
Now that that troublesome ethereal has been dealt with, we can focus our efforts on understanding these nether dragons. I've had a chance to examine the eggs and I've made a few discoveries.

==Notes==
*Once you talk to Marid, he will ask you to follow him behind a hill for some "privacy". Once you get to a small clearing, a couple level 68 ethereals will spawn to help Marid. You only need to kill Marid so you can just kill him then run away from his minions.
*He seems to bug out if you try to turn in the quest while mounted. He stalks away from the camp without saying anything and never turns hostile.

==Progression==
