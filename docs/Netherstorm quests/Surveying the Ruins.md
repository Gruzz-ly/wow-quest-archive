==Objectives==
Place the three Surveying Markers and then return to [[Zephyrion]] at the [[Stormspire]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*Surveying Marker One placed
*Surveying Marker Two placed
*Surveying Marker Three placed
*[[Surveying Markers]] (provided)

==Description==
I have to get over to the [[Ruins of Farahlon]] to start my excavations! The problem is that the place has been infested by demons!

Maybe you could do some preliminary work for me?

There are three locations within the ruins to the northeast where I want you to place surveying markers. Each is near a draenei banner.

Return to me when you've managed to place all three markers.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ethereal Gloves|Zephyrion's Belt|Chestguard of the Stormspire}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
*12650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
That was fast. &nbsp;You must be a very efficient person to have placed all three of those markers already.

==Completion==
You're not just pulling my bandage, right? &nbsp;That's most excellent news!

Now that you've done the surveying grunt-work, I'll be able to take my team up to the ruins and see what's there to be procured.

You have my thanks, <class>. 

==Notes==
The three Draenei banners are at {{coords|51.7|20.6|Netherstorm}}, {{coords|54.5|22.8|Netherstorm}}, and {{coords|55.8|19.9|Netherstorm}}.
