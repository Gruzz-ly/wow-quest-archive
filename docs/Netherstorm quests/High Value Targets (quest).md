This quest is part of the '''Report to Spymaster Thalodien''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[Report to Spymaster Thalodien]]

==Objectives==
Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 wants you to go to Manaforge B'naar and slay 2 Sunfury Warp-Masters, 6 Sunfury Warp-Engineers and 8 Sunfury Geologists.

Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.
*[[Sunfury Warp-Master]] slain (2)
*[[Sunfury Warp-Engineer]] slain (6)
*[[Sunfury Geologist]] slain (8)

==Description==
Based on the roster information, we know that the brains of the manaforge operations are the warp-masters and warp-engineers. It is they who oversee the retrieval of a so called "warp-energy" by the manaforge and its delivery to a remote destination via a system of underground pipes.

The only other specialists in the area are geologists. Everyone else is either part of the military or a magister crony; both easily replaced.

Get in there and kill Kael's specialists; that's what'll hurt him the most.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at level 70)

*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+250 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Completion==
You're one reliable fellow, <name>. If there's one thing I like more than killing Kael's lapdogs, it is having someone else do it for me.

Less blood on my clothes that way.
