'''Nexus-King Salhadaar''' concludes the Ethereum chapter of the [[Netherstorm quests|Netherstorm storyline]].

==Objectives==
Use the Protectorate Disruptor to bring down Salhadaar's force fields, then destroy Nexus-King Salhadaar.
* Salhadaar's Power Conduits disrupted (3) (Optional)
* [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]] slain {{co|53.6|42.4|Netherstorm}}
* [[Protectorate Disruptor]] (provided)

==Description==
I have in my possession another disruptor--one capable of destroying the three conduits that surround Salhadaar. Once the conduits are destroyed, Salhadaar's protective force fields will be down. For this act, he will strike at you with a ferocity you have never before witnessed, <name>.

If you are willing to rid the world of Salhadaar, I will give you the disruptor.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[The Burning Crusader]]
* [[Fleshling Simulation Staff]]
* [[Ameer's Impulse Taser]]
* [[Ameer's Judgment]]
* [[Twin-Bladed Ripper]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|77|50}}
* 5,150 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Is... Is he really dead? Destroyed?

==Completion==
It has been a thousand years, maybe more, since Salhadaar began his crusade to exterminate all that would stand in his way. I can hardly believe that this is the last we'll see of him... 

You have done all of us a great service, <name>, and for that you will be rewarded.

==Notes==
Use the provided [[Protectorate Disruptor]] on the three power conduits surrounding [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]] to the southeast. Once the third falls, Salhadaar will attack:
:{{text|yell|Nexus-King Salhadaar|Prepare to enter oblivion, meddlers. You have unleashed a god!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Nexus-King Salhadaar|The Ethereum... will... prevail...}}

==Progression==
{{Ethereum}}
