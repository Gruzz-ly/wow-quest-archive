==Objectives==
Slay Overmaster Grindgarr. Then return to [[Wind Trader Tuluman]] at [[Tuluman's Landing]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Overmaster Grindgarr]] slain

==Description==
I used to be the foreman here.  But now that I've been demoted, I've come to realize our pilgrimage from [[Quel'Thalas]] to [[Outland]] was all a lie.

A lie perpetrated by [[Kael'thas]] to strengthen his forces here in the Netherstorm.

I've tried to convince my brethren that we should leave, especially with the [[Burning Legion]] here, but they are all too stubborn.

Do me a favor?  Kill Overmaster Grindgarr.  Then return to your [[ethereal]] and tell him that I am no longer his enemy.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Gloves of the Nether-Stalker|Landing Boots|Overmaster's Shoulders|Wind Trader's Band}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring from Manaforge Ara?  Did you deal with Foreman Sundown?

==Completion==
A [[doomguard]] overmaster? &nbsp;That's odd! &nbsp;What's the Burning Legion doing in there?

So, some of the [[Blood elf|blood elves]] are defecting. &nbsp;We'll keep that in mind if we ever attempt to take the place by force. &nbsp;At least there's some good news that has come from all of this, no?

Please, <name>, take this with my deepest gratitude.
