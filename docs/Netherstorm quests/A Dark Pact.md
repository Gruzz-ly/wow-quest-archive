==Objectives==
Kaylaan at Tuluman's Landing in [[Netherstorm]] wants you to slay 6 Gan'arg Warp-Tinkers, 3 Daughters of Destiny and 3 Mo'arg Warp-Masters.

Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.
*[[Daughter of Destiny]] slain (3)
*[[Gan'arg Warp-Tinker]] slain (6)
*[[Mo'arg Warp-Master]] slain (3)

==Description==
We've been so blind, <name>, that the alliance of two of our most dangerous enemies went completely unnoticed.

I wouldn't be surprised if the Scryers had something to do with hiding this information from us, but we must now face the reality. The Burning Legion and Kael'thas' Sunfury army serve under the same banner.

These demons are the only reason Kael'thas was ever able to utilize the technology in [[Tempest Keep]]. Under Orelis's orders I must command you to destroy them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-275 [[reputation]] '''decrease''' with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
Have you succeeded in your task, <name>?

==Completion==
It is done then. We come here, hunt them down and slay them at the bidding of our masters. No quarter is given or expected.

Makes you wonder sometimes.

==Progression==
