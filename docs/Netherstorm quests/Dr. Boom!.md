==Objectives==
[[File:Dr. Boom! TCG.jpg|thumb|In the [[World of Warcraft: Trading Card Game]].]]
Kill Dr. Boom and return with the good news to [[Lead Sapper Blastfizzle]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Dr. Boom]] slain
*[[Boom's Doom]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, my former protege, Sparky Uberthruster, wouldn't wear his helmet while down here and one day transformed into the infamous Dr. Boom!

And he stole off to the northeast with most of our sapping equipment! He and his Boom Bots have been a menace to [[Area 52]] ever since.

I need you to go to his Camp of Boom just outside of town and put an end to him! Use these Boom's Doom bombs to take him out.

And make sure not to get too close to him or his Boom Bots! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Nether Vest|Nether Leggings|Sparky's Discarded Helmet|Nether Guards}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|90}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you saved us from the depredations of Dr. Boom?  I promise this time there won't be any exploding wagons, though that was a lot of fun!

We really should do that more often.

==Completion==
I'll always miss Sparky.  <sniff>  But we'll all sleep better now knowing that as [[Dr. Boom]] he is no longer around to terrorize us!

Just let this be a lesson to you.  Don't come down here without a nether helmet!

Now, how can I repay you?
