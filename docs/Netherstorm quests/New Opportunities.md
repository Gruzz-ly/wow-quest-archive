==Objectives==
Gather 15 Ivory Bells and return to [[Mehrdad]] at Midrealm Post. 
*[[Ivory Bell]] (15)
==  Description ==
I hear that a group of 'druids' from Azeroth has taken quite an interest in the effects of our eco-dome technology.

The Cenarion Expedition's representatives are eager to get access to the plants growing within the domes, particularly one called the ivory bell, known for its healing properties. They're found in clumps of brush around larger plants in Eco-Dome Midrealm.

I'll share the profits with you if you're willing to gather the herbs for my first delivery. 
==  Reward ==
You will receive:{{cost|4|10|}}
==  Progress ==
Have you managed to gather the herbs? 
==  Completion ==
Interesting choice, isn't it? The healing properties had better be miraculous. I'm charging a lot of money for a rather plain looking flower. 
==  Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]
