==Description==
The [[Kirin Tor]] sent one other of [[Krasus]]'s possessions with our expedition. It was his spellbook, called Krasus's Compendium. Containing all the spells he mastered, it lent us a much-needed advantage in the war.

Before [[Kael'thas]] and his forces laid siege to Kirin'Var, the compendium had been stolen from me by a rebellious apprentice intent on studying [[necromancy]]. The apprentice and his followers divided and studied the text in secret, locking themselves inside their houses in the southern part of town.

==Progress==
Have you brought the book?

==Completion==
<Archmage Vargoth's image seems to inspect the compendium.>

It's a little worse for the wear, but considering the treatment it's been through, it's a miracle all of it survived. Safeguard it, <name>. Without it, we stand little chance of being able to break the tower's ward.

==Notes==
This quest is the 5th step in a quest chain in the [[Netherstorm]] that begins with [[The Archmage's Staff]].
