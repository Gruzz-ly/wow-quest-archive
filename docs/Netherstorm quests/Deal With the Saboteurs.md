==Objectives==
[[Mehrdad]] at [[Midrealm Post]] wants you to kill 8 [[Barbscale Crocolisk]]s.
*[[Barbscale Crocolisk]] slain (8)

==Description==
In searching the area for clues about the damage to our equipment, I've seen pieces of the shield generators at the bottom of the small lake to the north. I'm not sure why the [[crocolisk]]s have taken an interest in the equipment, but we have to put a stop to this problem.

The [[Consortium]] is quite clear on this matter. If it comes down to a choice between the equipment and crocolisks, the animals will have to go. I'll make it worth your while to deal with them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost||72}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Have you put the creatures out of their misery? Don't get me wrong, I'm really an animal lover, but not when the animals are biting the hand that feeds and shelters them.

==Completion==
The area's looking clearer already. The domes are quite useful, but the major drawback is the rampant growth they encourage in some places, accelerating the growth and proliferation of native species.

==Progression==
{{Run a Diagnostic!}}
