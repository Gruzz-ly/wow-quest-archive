At the furthest corner of the Netherstorm, one of last commanders of the Burning Legion in Outland awaits. The player and the Aldor led by [[Ishanah]] seek to end the life of Socrethar and deal a '''Deathblow to the Legion'''.

==Objectives==
High Priestess Ishanah wants you to go to the Legion Teleporter at the northwestern corner of [[Netherstorm]] and use it to teleport to [[Socrethar's Seat]].  Once there, defeat [[Socrethar]].

Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.
*[[Socrethar's Teleportation Stone]] (provided)

==Description==
When facing [[eredar]] of great power, large armies are useless for the most part.  Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them.

Take this stone to the [[Invasion Point: Overlord]], between [[Forge Base: Oblivion]] and [[Forge Base: Gehenna|Gehenna]] and bring your closest, strongest friends with you.  Orelis and Karja will meet you at Socrethar's Seat; I will send Adyen along with them.

May the Light prevail today, <name>. May Socrethar meet his end.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:{{cost|13|20}}

==Progress==
Light be with you, <class>.

==Completion==
It is done, <name>.  Socrethar has been destroyed.

I and the others will recover from our wounds, <name>.  The wrath of Socrethar's magic was far too much for young Kaylaan, however.  Not even my strongest prayer could raise him.

It is an unbearable pity that one so young would fall in battle.  However, in the end his will was strong enough to recover from the Legion's corruption and we may find solace in that.

==Notes==
;Adyen the Lightwarden
:It is time to face Socrethar, <name>.  Are you ready?

:{{gossip|I'm ready, Adyen.}}

:''[[Adyen the Lightwarden]], [[Anchorite Karja]], and [[Exarch Orelis]] approach [[Socrethar]].''
:{{Text|say|Adyen the Lightwarden|We're here for you, lost brother. It is custom to offer you a chance to repent before you are destroyed. We offer you this chance, as the [[Naaru]]'s law commands.}}
:{{Text|yell|Socrethar|Do not make me laugh. Is this the mighty [[Aldor]] army that's come to defeat me?}}
:{{Text|say|Adyen the Lightwarden|We may be few, Socrethar, but our [[Light|faith]] is strong. Something you will never understand. Now that custom has been served, prepare to meet your end.}}
:{{Text|yell|Socrethar|Yes, let us settle this. Before we begin, however, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.}}
:''Kaylaan, previously seen in the Netherstorm storyline, approaches from behind the throne, bowing before Socrethar.'' 
:{{Text|say|Exarch Orelis|How... how could you?!}}
:{{Text|say|Kaylaan the Lost|My heart has been filled with hate since our [[Blood elf|sworn]] [[Scryers|enemies]] were allowed into our city. I knew the one known as [[Voren'thal the Seer|Voren'thal]] before he was called a Seer. It was by his hand that my brother was slain.}}
:{{Text|say|Kaylaan the Lost|I turned that hate on the [[Illidari]] and the [[Burning Legion]]... but they weren't the ones who betrayed us. We were the naaru's chosen! We lived and died for them!}}
:{{Text|say|Kaylaan the Lost|Once the hatred in my heart became focused, everything became clear to me. [[Shattrath City|Shattrath]] must be destroyed and the naaru with it.}}
:{{Text|say|Adyen the Lightwarden|Socrethar is clouding your mind, Kaylaan! You do not mean these words! I remember training you when you were but a youngling. Your will was strong even then!}}
:{{Text|say|Kaylaan the Lost|You are wrong, Adyen. My mind has never been clearer.}}
:''Kaylaan is granted increased size and power by Socrethar.''
:{{Text|yell|Socrethar|Slay these dogs, Kaylaan! Earn your place in the Burning Legion!}}

Bring Kaylaan down to 50%.

:{{Text|say|Ishanah|The Light wants its lost son back, Socrethar.}}
:{{Text|say|Ishanah|I offer myself in exchange. You will have Ishanah, the High Priestess of the Aldor, as your prisoner if you release Kaylaan from your dark grasp.}}
:{{Text|yell|Socrethar|You foolish old hag... Why would I do that when I can have you both?}}
:''Socrethar strikes down Ishanah.''
:{{Text|yell|Kaylaan the Lost|No! What have I done?}}
:''Kaylaan rushes to Ishanah's corpse and begins to channel [[Redemption]].''
:{{Text|yell|Kaylaan the Lost|Light grant me strength!}}
:''Ishanah is revived.''
:{{Text|yell|Socrethar|Oh, please! This is sickening; I'm going to have to kill you all myself.}}
:''Socrethar strikes down Kaylaan and attacks the party.''

==Getting there==
Deathblow to the Legion is a quest for those who chose to ally with the Aldor in Shattrath City, the long questchain starts with [[Assist Exarch Orelis]]. The quest, simply put, involves killing a demon named Socrethar (mentioned in a prerequisite quest). Socrethar himself is located on a floating island off the northwest corner '''(36,18)''' of Netherstorm. To reach him, you can use two methods:
*First, you can simply use a flying mount and fly up to Socrethar's lair. While this is easier in one sense, using this method will find you fighting Socrethar without the help of the adds sent to help you, mentioned in the quest text. The fight can be difficult without them, unless you have a Scryer helping you that already has the item that gives Socrethar an incredible debuff (mentioned below.)
*Second, you can use Socrethar's Teleportation Stone, obtained from the [[Ishanah's Help]] quest earlier in the chain. The only downside to this method is that you'll have to clear the area around the portal to get to the lair safely. Using this method will successfully spawn the adds that are mentioned in the quest text. Talk to one of them, and you will start the event that leads up to the final battle with Socrethar.

==Find a Scryer buddy==
Those allied with the Scryers have an equivalent to Deathblow to the Legion called [[Turning Point]]. When a Scryer receives the quest, their quest giver gives them an item called Voren'thal's Presence. When used against Socrethar, this item gives him a debuff that increases all damage done against him by 300% and decreases all damage that he deals by 75%. Combined with the use of an Aldor's adds, the fight is incredibly easy.

==Encounter==
Socrethar has fear, knockback, shadow volley, and spell reflect shield. He is easily kiteable and affected by CC (like banish & cyclone). Therefore '''clear possible adds'''.

The whole fight itself is a complete tank and spank. With the adds and the debuff, the tanking part is optional. With a half-decent healer and Socrethar's damage nerfed, any cloth wearer should be able to take the hits with ease. Chances are you won't be facing the encounter without at least the adds or the debuff, so there shouldn't be much to worry about.

Note that Socrethar is extremely weak to all forms of frost, so if your party is without Scryer assistance, a frost mage may make up for this.  An average level 70 frost-spec mage should be able to crit for over 10,000.

==Bug and workaround==
The encounter was once known to bug for a very long time, making Socrethar merely stand there and not aggro or be able to be attacked. This was possibly due to a wipe while using the adds, freezing the event in place. Since a recent patch, this bug has been known to happen less frequently.

If the encounter bugs, here is how to fix it:
# Aggro a random mob not associated with the quest.
# Kite mob over to friendly NPCs.
# While mob is still alive, kite enemy and friendly NPCs attacking it over to Socrethar.
# Friendly NPCs should aggro the quest mob and unbug the quest.
# Either fight it out now, or let the npcs die and reset the encounter.

June 24, 2007:  Quest did bug multiple times, ultimately leaving three NPCs standing before Socrethar and not doing anything.  When discussed with a GM, they believed the cause was a mixed group of Aldors and Scryers, and strongly advised us to try again with an Aldor-only group.  We were told that the group could be any size, and that non-group help could be received from Scryers without bugging the quest yet again. Likely the GM was mistaken as to the cause. It is more likely that the NPCs get their aggro table confused due to an add.

If another group is killing him (even if opposite faction) there is a 50% chance your quest will complete if you are close enough.
