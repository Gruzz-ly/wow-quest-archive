'''S-A-B-O-T-A-G-E''' is the fourth part of a [[quest chain]] that begins with [[The Ethereum]] and ends with [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]]. 

==Objectives==
The [[Image of Commander Ameer]] at the [[Ethereum Staging Grounds]] - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to recover one Prepared Ethereum Wrapping.
*[[Prepared Ethereum Wrapping]]

==Description==
We must destroy the machinery that is making these nexus-stalker aberrations possible. To strike at their proto-accelerator would be futile as it is an ethereal creation. We must instead destroy the manaforge energy tube that they are using as a conduit.

I have all that I need to create a device to overload the conduit save for one item. I need a wrapping from an archon or overlord that might be transforming soon in order to calibrate the device.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|59|}}
* 12,650 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the wrapping?

==Completion==
Excellent! Now to calibrate the device.

==Progression==
{{Ethereum}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
