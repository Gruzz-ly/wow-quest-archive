==Objectives==
Apprentice Andrethan in [[Kirin'Var Village]] wants you to kill the ghost of Rhonsus, the town's master blacksmith.
*[[Rhonsus]] slain

==Description==
At last, my journeyman project is complete! I can't wait to formally present it to Master Rhonsus.

<The apprentice looks at you as you describe your experiences retrieving the hammer.>

They attacked you? All of them? By the Light, they've gone mad!

What are we to do, <name>? It grieves me to say so, but it may be necessary to kill Master Rhonsus. It would leave me as the only smith in Kirin'Var, but I believe my training is sufficient to serve the town's needs.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Master Smith's Hammer|Finely Wrought Scale Leggings|Andrethan's Masterwork|Reinforced Heaume}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
<There appear to be tears in the apprentice's eyes as he speaks.>

Have you... dealt with Master Rhonsus?

==Completion==
Master Rhonsus taught me everything I know about my trade. I will honor his memory by using my skills to serve the people of Kirin'Var.
