==Objectives==
Retrieve the Smithing Hammer from the Kirin'Var Apprentices and bring it back to [[Apprentice Andrethan]] in [[Kirin'Var Village]].
*[[Smithing Hammer]]

==Description==
You haven't seen a heavy smithing hammer lying around by chance, have you? I brought it out here with me to finish the shoes for some of old man Amorlin's horses, but I can't find it.

I've searched the barn no less than a half dozen times and I just can't seem to find it. Maybe one of the other apprentices retrieved it and took it back to the [[Blacksmith|smithy]]? Would you be willing to go down there and take a look? The workshop is to the southeast of the tower in the Town Square.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost||75}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did you have any luck finding my hammer?

==Completion==
Thank goodness! Now I can get back to work. I know you think I'm crazy, working on the piece that will earn me journeyman status away from the forge proper, but I can't run the risk of one of the other apprentices copying my design.
