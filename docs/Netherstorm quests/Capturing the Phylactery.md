==Objectives==
Recover Naberius's Phylactery from [[Kirin'Var Village]]'s [[Chapel Yard]] district and bring it to [[Custodian Dieworth]].
*[[Naberius's Phylactery]]

==Description==
I suppose an explanation is in order. You've met one of the archmage's apprentices, Ravandwyr, but there was also another named [[Naberius]].

He was an ardent student, but was drawn to necromancy. When Kael'thas appeared with his forces, [[Naberius]] seized the opportunity to betray the archmage, handing over the secrets to the tower's defense.

Now, it seems, he has become a lich. If we are to stop him, we must capture his phylactery. Knowing him, he would've buried it somewhere out of sight in his domain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
You must recover Naberius's phylactery before we can attack him. Otherwise, he will be invulnerable.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. Possession of the phylactery will be the key to our victory. When you enter battle with [[Naberius]], I will smash it, exposing him to your attacks.

==Progression==
