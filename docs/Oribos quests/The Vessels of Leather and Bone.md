==Objectives==
Bring the memory back to Tanner Au'qil in [[Oribos]].
*Bring the Memory back to [[Tanner Au'qil]]

==Description==
You have the bearing of one familiar with the art of [[leatherworking]]. But perhaps you have more to learn.

Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you.

Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way.

What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*{{Abilities|Boneshatter Armor Recipes|Unlock the Boneshatter Armor recipes at your trainer in Oribos.|id=346021|icon=spell_holy_mindsooth}}
*{{Abilities|Umbrahide Armor Recipes|Unlock the Umbrahide Armor recipes at your trainer in Oribos.|id=346022|icon=spell_holy_mindsooth}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}
*1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Au'qil inspects what you brought to him.>

A memory? Fascinating... With this knowledge, I can teach you to craft armors capable of holding immense power.

For a price, of course.
