==Description==
You should become familiar with the Eternal City and how best to navigate it.

We, the [[attendant]]s, serve Oribos as its caretakers.

Everything you see here is done in service to the [[Purpose]]. In this time of chaos and drought, we must adapt our perspective. It seems we are to serve the Purpose in a new way.

You mortals are not the only visitors here. Others have come as well.

Like you, the [[broker]]s are not of Oribos. They are congenial and willing to aid you. Usually for a price.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you concluded your tour yet?

==Completion==
We hope you are comfortable here, <name>.

Consider these ancient facilities to be at your disposal.

It's time to explore the capital city!
[[File:Foreman Au'brak.png|thumb|upright=.5|Foreman Au'brak]]
[[Foreman Au'brak]] is clockwise to the northwest in the [[Hall of Shapes]], the tradeskill training and vendor area:
:Welcome, stranger. We are at your service.
:{{gossip|What is available here?}}
:This is where we established an artisan's hall. For your benefit, of course.
:We brokers travel extensively and learn from the denizens from every realm we visit. This allows us to cater our offerings to the needs of our clientele. 
:Our members have endeavored to master the various professions in which your kind seems to place value. You will find them eager to aid you in your development as an artisan.
[[File:Caretaker Kah-Rahm.png|thumb|upright=.5|Caretaker Kah-Rahm]]
Clockwise to the northeast is the [[Hall of Holding]], the [[bank]] and weekly chest of Oribos. Speak with [[Caretaker Kah-Rahm]]:
:This area provides you access to services relating to your material possessions. We are relatively new to such concepts, so the Brokers have kindly offered to facilitate these services for you.
:{{gossip|What is this Hall of Holding?}}
:Here you will find that the brokers have established a means for you to access your personal belongings. What was the word they used... a bank, I believe.
:I will admit that the concept of possession is alien to us, but the Brokers have always maintained that they are experts on such things.

Head to the center, then cut east to reach the [[Idyllia]], home of the innkeeper [[Host Ta'rela]]:
:Welcome Maw Walker. 
:Please avail yourself of our amenities.
:Or, as our gracious hosts might say, may the Purpose be your way.
:{{gossip|Thank you for the kind welcome to your Inn.}}
[[File:Oribos touchstone.jpg|thumb|upright|The touchstone]]
Head outside to speak with [[Fatescribe Roh-Tahl]] and Shadowlands' version of a [[graveyard]]:
:Welcome, mortal. May you find your way in the Purpose.
:{{gossip|What is this place?}}
:This is a touchstone for spirits that have become untethered.
:<The Fatescribe seems to ponder you for a moment.>
:I sense the touch of a great power upon you, <name>. Despite facing the end of your existence time and again, this force has kept you anchored to the mortal plane.
:Perhaps devices like this one will keep you anchored to the Shadowlands, should an ill fate befall you.
:The Purpose will decide. The Purpose is our way.

Loop clockwise through the inner ring southeast to find [[Overseer Ta'readon]] in the [[Hall of Curiosities]], home to [[transmog]], [[void storage]], a [[barbershop]], and some specialty vendors:
:Welcome to our bazaar, my friend. We are here to serve.
:{{gossip|What is this bazaar?}}
:Here we have some of the more exotic offerings you may seek. 
:My colleagues and I specialize in sourcing exotic beasts and stabling them. You'll also find that we have access to what you know as [[Void Storage]], as well as the ability to use your [[transmogrification]] magics. 
:Lastly, my friend [[Groomer Ta'visage|Ta'visage]] over there can aid you in altering your appearance. May as well look good while you are saving the multiverse, no?

Finally, return to [[Overseer Kah-Delen]] at the [[Enclave]]. There, [[Bolvar Fordragon]] and [[Tal-Inara]] are wrapping up a conversation:
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|...And when [[Sylvanas Windrunner|she]] sundered [[Helm of Domination|the helm]], the sky above [[Icecrown Citadel|the citadel]] shattered. The spire of [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|an immense tower]] appeared beyond the veil.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|If [[Maw|the Maw's]] influence bleeds into [[Azeroth|your realm]], the balance between Life and Death will be broken. All you hold dear will be consumed in darkness.}}
