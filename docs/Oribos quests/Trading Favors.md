==Objectives==
Report to [[Finder Ta'sul]] in [[Oribos]].

==Description==
Welcome, friend.

I can see by your garb that you must have quite a storied history. Many unique relics befitting of one that has traveled the [[Planet|worlds]] and vanquished many foes.

There are those of us that find great value in such things, and would willingly part with our own valuables for a taste of what you may find.

Let your curiosity guide you to the dark hallway across from the cookpots in the next room. Down there, you will find answers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, you must have been sent by Ta'rela. We have need of your services.

Trust me, we will make it more than worth your while.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
