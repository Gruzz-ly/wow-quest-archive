==Objectives==
Obtain the Ring of Otherworldly Metal from [[Mordretha, the Endless Empress|Mordretha]] in the [[Theater of Pain (instance)|Theater of Pain]].
* [[Ring of Otherworldly Metal]]

==Description==
The Theatre of Pain in [[Maldraxxus]] is a brutal place, where only the strongest survive.

With the houses so fiercely in competition with one another, it is considered a great point of pride to house a champion with a winning record.

As such, the house lords often outfit their contenders with powerful arms, armor, and trinkets. Often these are storied items that have been passed down through many battles.

I would very much like to see such an item.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Were you victorious, or have you come to tend to your wounds?

==Completion==
The fools, giving away an object such as this as a mere trinket to be used in battle. Do they not know of its significance? Clearly not.

Let me explain.

There is much we do not understand about the workings of this world. This city, Oribos, is made of a strange ore that we have not found anywhere else. Who made this place, and why?

Relics of similar make like this are all that we have to tie together the threads of mystery.

We thank you for this gift. Please, take a treasure.
