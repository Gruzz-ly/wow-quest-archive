'''Call to Lordaeron''' begins the [[:Return to Lordaeron]] part of the [[Shadowlands epilogue]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Calia Menethil]] in [[Brill]], [[Tirisfal Glades]].
*Speak to [[Forsaken Dreadmage]] for a teleport

==Description==
With the [[Shadowlands]] healing, it is time to turn our attention to matters close to home again, on [[Azeroth]].

The [[Forsaken]] are mustering in the ruins of the [[kingdom of Lordaeron]]. They seek to reclaim as much as they can of the Tirisfal Glades, to finally put the destruction left by the [[Fourth War]] behind them.

And I intend to assist them in any way I can.

I also know that for the [[Horde]], I have much to prove. Come, join me in Brill and we can help the Forsaken together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I was always fond of Brill.

Much remains to be done, but it is heartening to see the progress made in rebuilding here.
