[[File:Things Best Kept Dark.jpg|thumb|Let the carpet of corpses be a warning]]

==Objectives==
[[File:Shipping Documents.jpg|thumb|Shipping Documents]]
Find a shipping manifest belonging to [[Cartel So]].
*[[Cartel So Shipping Manifest]] {{co|38.5|25.3|Oribos}}

==Description==
The leader of Cartel So represents a grave danger to the [[Shadowlands]], [[Maw Walker]].

Her name is [[So'leah]]. She seeks to assemble an artifact of the [[First Ones]] and use its power for selfish ends.

Pieces of the relic are said to be hidden on your homeworld. [[Broker]]s have never before found our way there. But if So'leah does, then [[Azeroth]] too is imperiled.

We must intercept her.

There is cargo nearby marked for Cartel So. Perhaps the manifest will give us clues as to their leader's whereabouts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Have you found anything?

==Completion==

[[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market]]...

An interesting choice of locations.

==Notes==
Find some scrolls of [[Shipping Documents]] near [[So'danah]] on the outer ring of the northwestern quadrant of [[Oribos]] and interact wit them:
:{{text|say|So'danah|You there! That is the property of Cartel So!}}

Defeat him and loot the [[Cartel So Shipping Manifest]].
