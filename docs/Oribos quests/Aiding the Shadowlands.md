Speak with Tal-Inara:
:Your Purpose and ours are entwined it seems.

This opens the Shadowlands scouting report interface, which allows you to choose the zone you want to level in:
*[[Bastion (quest)]] - ''Those who have lived a life of service are drawn to Bastion to carry souls to the Shadowlands.''
*[[Maldraxxus (quest)]] - ''Maldraxxus is the birthplace of necromantic magic, where ambitious souls thrive.''
*[[Ardenweald (quest)]] - ''Ardenweald is a domain of endless restoration tended by the night fae.''
*[[Revendreth (quest)]] - ''Revendreth is home to the venthyr, the harvesters of sin. Wretched souls arrive here to find redemption... and avoid eternal torment within the Maw.''
*[[Torghast (quest)]] - ''Torghast is the seat of power for the Jailer. Once a prison for the most dangerous souls of the cosmos, it now houses many innocents doomed to be tortured for all eternity.''
*[[Battlegrounds (quest)]] - ''The brokers of Oribos are recruiting eager competitors to fight each other in the battlegrounds of conflict, so that they may observe and learn.''

After you pick a zone, this quest is silently removed from the quest log, and the chosen quest is ready to turn in to Tal-Inara.
