'''Into the Maw''' sends [[Night Fae]] characters back to the [[Maw]] to find [[Tyrande Whisperwind]]. Players do not get a free pass on their [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]] threat level, so if they have already maxed out for the day they will need to return after the daily reset.

==Objectives==
Take [[Shandris Feathermoon]] into the [[Maw]].

==Description==
I have not seen [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] since she departed for [[Icecrown]]... but I see her in my dreams. She stalks a nightmarish landscape, brimming with the might of the [[Night Warrior]].

Such power is too much for any [[mortal]] to bear for long. I shudder to think of the toll it has taken on my [[Darnassian|minn'do]].

[[Bolvar Fordragon|Highlord Fordragon]] has told me of the Maw. If you truly have braved its horrors before, then I ask that you guide me through them as well.

We must find Tyrande and convince her to let go of the Night Warrior's rage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have seen bits and pieces of this dark realm in my dreams. Tyrande roams this place.

We must find her.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|No matter what terrors the Maw may hold, we will overcome them. Lead on.}}

Upstairs to the Ring of Transference, then jump down.
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The Maw... It is even more horrific than the Highlord described.}}

Speak with her again:
:This place is wrong, <name>. All those who were lost in [[Teldrassil]] do not deserve to be tortured here.

==Progression==
{{Daughter of the Night Warrior}}

==Beta version==

;Description
I've seen Tyrande in my dreams. She stalks some nightmarish plain, fueled by the power of the Night Warrior.

Legends say the Night Warrior is not meant for any mortal. I shudder to think the toll it has taken on my minn'do.

We must find her and convince her that the power of the Night Warrior will consume her if she doesn't stop.

I have heard this plain is called the Maw. Take me there... and hopefully I can track where she is to bring her home.
