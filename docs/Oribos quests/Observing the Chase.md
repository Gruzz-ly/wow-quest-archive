*{{alliance}} Horde Players slain/{{horde}} Alliance Players slain

==Description==
In our observations of your kind's conflict, we have noticed a high rate of escape among the prey.

This is unadvantageous to our observation efforts.

The Observer has acquired a tool we believe will improve your ability to force conflict.

Before I give it to you, we ask that you prove your willingness to participate in such conflicts, so that we know we will receive a worthy return on this investment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Net-o-Matic 5000]]
*200 [[Honor]]
*50 [[Conquest]]

==Progress==
Your hesitation to set out and hunt your prey is not promising, <name>...

==Completion==
Excellent. We will be watching your future endeavors with great interest.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
