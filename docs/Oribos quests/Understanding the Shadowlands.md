==Description==
As I sat upon the [[Frozen Throne]] all those years, <name>, I could peer into the [[Shadowlands]]. Brief glimpses, clouded and uncertain. Sights both wondrous and terrible.

We must work together to make sense of what has happened. To prevent the [[Maw]] from consuming all of reality.

Whatever [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] and [[the Jailer]] want, we must stop them. But we cannot do so alone.

Perhaps Tal-Inara can put us on the path to find answers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let us align your path to the Purpose.

==Completion==
Your path and that of the Purpose are becoming one.

==Notes==
Speak with Tal-Inara:
:The Purpose has sent you to us. I know it.
:{{gossip|Can you help us find answers?}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Tell me, how did these allies from your world become trapped in the Maw?}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Sylvanas Windrunner sent her agents to abduct them. Dark, winged beings who caught them in chains and dragged them through the shattered sky.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|The winged kyrian of Bastion ferry souls from the mortal realm into the Shadowlands, but not with chains. And they are noble, untainted by the Maw.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|True, but it would seem this is the only clue our mortal friend has to follow. It falls to us to open the way for them.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Overseer Kah-Sher, take this mortal to the Ring of Transference. Use our anima reserves to open a pathway to Bastion.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|But Honored Voice, we have so little anima in our reserves! Surely we should be more--}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|See it done, Kah-Sher. With her voice have I spoken.}}

Speak with Overseer Kah-Sher:
:Let us begin to align your path to the Purpose. Do you think you can manage that?
:{{gossip|I will go with you.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|Come, mortal. I will show you the way.}}

Kah-Sher walks slowly to the center of the Ring of Fates, stopping before a Transport Portal.
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|Here, mortal. This teleporter will convey you to the Ring of Transference.}}

Interact with the portal to teleport to the upper level, then turn in to Kah-Sher.
