==Progress==
As the bearer of this news, you must bear this burden as well.

You have done well. See that you continue to do so.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[General Draven]]|[[Denathrius]] caused the [[anima]] drought and has fed his vast stores into the Maw. He is in league with the Jailer.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Purpose save us all! It is worse than we could have imagined.}}
: ''As Bolvar speaks, [[Caretaker Kah-Lod]] approaches [[Overseer Kah-Sher]], who notices and turns to them. Kah-Lod briefly speaks to him.''
:{{text|say|[[Highlord Bolvar Fordragon]]|It seems the Jailer has been pulling the strings of fate on [[Azeroth|our world]] as well.}}
: ''Kah-Sher turns to Tal-Inara.''
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|Honored Voice! The [[Eternal Ones]] have summoned you to the [[Arbiter]]'s chamber!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Then I must answer their call. Come with me, Maw Walker. Perhaps they can guide our path.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Kah-Delen, bring the [[covenant]] representatives to the [[Enclave]]. After the mortal and I have finished, we will convene with you there. With her voice have I spoken.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|Blessed be her voice.}}
:''A cutscene plays. Tal-Inara and the Maw Walker walk to the center of the [[Crucible (Oribos)|Crucible]], as the Arbiter stands, ever still.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|As the Arbiter's voice, I heed the call of the Eternal Ones. How may I serve?}}
: ''Tal-Inara bows.''
:''Images of [[Kyrestia the Firstborne]] and the [[Winter Queen]] appear, along with the banner of the [[Primus]].''
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|The Maw grows, surging with power! How did this come to pass?!}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|The evil we believed forever bound has conspired to distract and divide us.}}
: ''The Winter Queen points to the Primus' banner.''
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|The Primus realized the truth, but his warning came too late. I fear he paid a grave price for this knowledge.}}
:''The image of [[Prince Renathal]] appears, somewhat recovered but still clutching his ribs.''
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|You speak for Revendreth? Where is your sire? Where is our brother Denathrius?}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|My sire... has betrayed us all.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|The drought was his doing. He stole the very lifeblood of our realms, starving his own people... and yours as well.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|When his lies were exposed, Denathrius unleashed his vast coffers of anima into the Maw... to fuel the might of his true master.}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Long ago, we stood as one to imprison that... monster.}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|With the Primus gone and Denathrius a traitor, our pantheon has been broken... and doom comes for the [[Shadowlands]].}}
: ''Renathal gestures to the player.''
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|There is yet hope. This mortal saved me from the Maw and revealed the sire's treachery.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|They aided [[Ardenweald|my forest]] as well. Their kind has shown great potential. If focused, it could turn the tide in our favor.}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Agreed. For the good of the Shadowlands, each mortal must choose a covenant.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|And when our realms have regained their strength, we will stand together against the darkness.}}
: ''Tal-Inara bows.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|I will see it done, Eternal Ones. With her voice have I spoken.}}
: ''As the images disappear, Tal-Inara turns to the player.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Come, mortal. The hour of decision is at hand.}}
