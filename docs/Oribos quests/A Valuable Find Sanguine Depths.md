==Objectives==
Obtain an Ancient Broker Headpiece from [[General Kaal]] in the [[Sanguine Depths]].
* [[Ancient Broker Headpiece]]

==Description==
General Kaal has slain many foes, and in a bag at his side, he holds the skulls of those he considers his most precious kills. Not all of them, of course, have skulls -- it is a bag of eclectic contents.

Contained within, we have heard, is the head of one of our kind. We do not know to whom it might belong, for we do not often find ourselves running afoul of the [[venthyr]].

Such a strange mystery must be solved. I will, of course, provide great compensation.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}
You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
What information do you bring?

==Completion==
This... is not what I expected.

It is very similar in appearance to our people, yet so very different. Are there others of our kind out there? Who are they, and where do they reside? Why have they not made contact with us? Or are they hiding themselves purposefully?

Is this a history we knew but have forgotten? I have so many questions.

I thank you for this. It is quite meaningful for us. Please, take a relic of power from the treasury.

==Notes==
*The quest text incorrectly uses male pronouns for Kaal; everywhere else uses either female or neutral pronouns.
