==Objectives==
Open the gateway to Bastion.
* Follow [[Overseer Kah-Sher|Kah-Sher]] to the gate. {{co|63.9|52.4|Oribos|1}}
* Activate the gateway to [[Bastion]]. {{co|63.8|51.6|Oribos|1}}

==Description==
Within the [[Arbiter]]'s Chamber are gateways to the infinite [[Plane|realms]] of the [[Shadowlands]]. As each [[soul]] was judged, a gateway would be opened to the appropriate afterlife.

But since the... incident, all gateways have remained closed. Dormant.

We dare not use the Arbiter's sacred chamber for so mundane a purpose as travel. But here in the upper ring of the city, gateways can be configured for your needs.

Before us stands the means to activate a gateway. Together we can channel the anima to power it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Your destiny and the Purpose are being drawn together.

==Completion==
Purpose be praised! Your path becomes clearer.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|We have precious little anima to spare. But the Honored Voice has blessed your mission, so we will use what we have.}}

Kah-Sher starts ''slowly'' moving to the eastern part of the circle, stopping before a [[Gate Activation Console]].
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|We will call down one of the soul conduits for use as a gateway to Bastion. These paths have been dormant for some time. Your arrival will be... unexpected.}}
:{{text|say|[[Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi]]|Welcome Kah-Sher. Is it true? Are we to open the gate again?}}

At this point, Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi has unique gossip text:
:The ways are re-opening. Has the Purpose sent you to us for this I wonder?

Interact with the [[Ancient Focus]] and a scene starts where the [[Gate to Bastion]] will appear.
