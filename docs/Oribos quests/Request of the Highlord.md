==Objectives==
Speak to [[Bolvar Fordragon]].

==Description==
The information you uncovered in [[Maldraxxus]] should quell the drums of war between the [[Necrolord]]s and the [[Kyrian]].

And this message from the [[Primus]]... extraordinary!

I would advise you to enlist Highlord Fordragon's counsel, but he appears preoccupied. Visitors from [[Azeroth|your world]] have come to seek him out. Quite insistently, I might add.

The nuances of mortal interaction elude me. But it seems the nature of their dialogue was rather... intense.

Perhaps you can assist the Highlord with this matter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|52|70}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Even through his scarred, molten visage, the emotion on Bolvar's face is plain.>

My daughter... here. I never thought...

==Notes and trivia==
Head southwest to the [[Enclave]], where [[Taelia Fordragon]] and [[Calia Menethil]] are talking to Bolvar.
:{{Text|say|Taelia Fordragon|Please, father. We need to know if our friends can still be saved!}}
:{{Text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|You do not understand the risk, Taelia. For me to peer into the Maw would mean--}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia Fordragon|I journeyed all the way to the realms of Death to meet the father I thought was lost to me. Bolvar Fordragon, one of Azeroth's bravest heroes.}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia Fordragon|I haven't asked a single thing of you since I was a little girl. The little girl you sent away.}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia Fordragon|But I'm asking you this. Tell us if they are still alive.}}
:{{Text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|My shining star, I... will do as you request.}}
