==Objectives==
Speak to [[Tal-Inara]] to enter [[Arbiter|the Arbiter's]] [[Crucible (Oribos)|chambers]].
*Speak to Tal-Inara

==Description==
Though [[the Jailer]] remains confined to the [[Maw]], his cruelty extends beyond the bounds of his prison.

Thankfully, [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|the Archon]] is recovering from the attack. Though I am told her wound has an... unsettling quality.

The [[Eternal Ones]] and their allies await you and [[Bolvar Fordragon|Highlord Fordragon]] in the Arbiter's chamber. I shall open the way.

With her voice have I spoken.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
<Bolvar stares in wonder at the sight before him.>

==Notes==
Before heading up, Jaina and Thrall have new gossip:

;Jaina
:It will take me... some time to recover from what happened in Torghast. I do not wish to speak of it further.
:{{gossip|How did you escape the Maw?}}
:The Jailer's minions wreaked havoc upon my perceptions. I could scarcely tell friend from foe.
:I was fortunate that another Maw Walker arrived to help me escape from that dark tower. 
:Now we must save Anduin from an even worse fate.
;Thrall
:After so many hard fought battles and wars for life, it is... interesting... to have so many questions answered about what happens after.
:{{gossip|How did you escape the Maw?}}
:I was bound by chains. Assailed by relentless agony.
:But with the aid of one of Azeroth's champions, I finally broke free.
:That cursed place... it is torment itself. Never have I felt so alone. So hopeless.

Bolvar still offers the skip option for alts, if necessary: {{gossip|I have heard this tale before. {{text|red|<Skip ahead to Korthia.>}}}}

Speak with Tal-Inara:
:I will bring you and the Highlord to the Arbiter's chamber.
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}

In the Crucible, the Arbiter, still silent, is flanked by images of the four covenant representatives: [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|the Archon]] (who is grasping a wound at her side), the [[Winter Queen]], [[Draka]], and [[Prince Renathal]]. If the player needs to return to the city, Tal-Inara offers a teleport back down:
:I shall address the honored ones gathered here.
:{{gossip|<Leave the Arbiter's Chamber.>}}

==Progression==
