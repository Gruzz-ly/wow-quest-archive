==Objectives==
Witness Bolvar's vision of the [[Maw]].
* Focus on the [[Helm of Domination]]
* Behold [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]]'s Vision
* Discuss the Vision

==Description==
When I put the [[Lich King]]'s crown upon my head, I wanted the [[Azeroth|world]] to believe I was dead. Even my daughter, [[Taelia Fordragon|Taelia]]. I... thought a lie would be kinder than the truth.

But she is no longer the little girl I left in [[Kul Tiras]]. I see my choice was a selfish one.

<Bolvar pauses.>

She and [[Calia Menethil|Lady Menethil]] have asked me to peer into the Maw to see if our allies yet live. It is a dangerous request, but one I cannot refuse.

Help me focus on the broken helm. Together, we may find a glimpse of truth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Seal of Fordragon]]
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is much to do.

==Completion==
A troubling vision indeed. But we must not give up hope.

==Notes==
On accept:
: ''Bolvar walks back over to the table and casts his focus on the helm.''
:{{Text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|The broken Helm still resonates with [[Domination|the power]] of the Lich King. The power... of the Maw.}}
:{{Text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Together, we can focus our sight deep into the Jailer's realm. But beware. Do not lose yourself within the darkness.}}

Interact with the Helm of Domination and a [[Shadowlands in-game cinematics|cinematic]] plays, "Enter the Maw":

:{{text|bossemote|[[Jaina Proudmoore]]|I won't. Not again. No. No! I will not yield! My mind is my own! Do you hear me?!}}
:{{text|bossemote|[[Thrall]]|Whoever you are, whatever you want, I will fight you! You will not break me!}}
:{{text|bossemote|[[Sylvanas Windrunner]]|They have breached the [[Seat of the Primus]] and discovered his warning.}}
:{{text|bossemote|[[The Jailer]]|Unfortunate, but of little consequence. Our eyes are everywhere. This nuisance will be dealt with.}}

On the other side:
:{{Text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|That is... all I can see. It is... too dangerous to push further.}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia Fordragon|I could make out the Lord Admiral's voice, and what must have been Thrall's as well. Their cries... they chilled me to the bone!}}
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|I did not hear [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]], nor [[Baine Bloodhoof]]. Highlord, are you certain you cannot try again?}}
:{{Text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Not yet, Calia. There is a price to be paid for such visions. I dare not attempt another so soon.}}
:{{Text|say|Tal-lnara|Highlord, this mortal bears an urgent warning from the [[Primus]] of [[Maldraxxus]]. They must see it delivered to the other realms.}}
:{{Text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Please aid them, Honored Voice, while I talk with the others. We must consider the implications of what we've seen.}}
