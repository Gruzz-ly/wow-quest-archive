==Objectives==
[[File:A Mourneblade Born.jpg|thumb|Bolvar chained by the Jailer]]

Discuss the vision with [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]] and the others.
* Speak to Bolvar

==Description==
While [[Varian Wrynn|his father]] was missing, I cared for [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] like a son. To see him like that, at the mercy of [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]...

<Bolvar's eyes flare with fire.>

Something must be done.

Take a moment. Let me know when you are ready to discuss what comes next.

==Completion==
We have to save Bolvar!

==Notes==
Speak with Bolvar again:
:The Shadowlands was never meant for mortal eyes.
:Do not trust your perceptions. And be wary.
:Always wary.
