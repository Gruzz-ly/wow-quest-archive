==Objectives==
Obtain one of Stradama's Lost Ledgers from [[Margrave Stradama]] in [[Plaguefall]].
* [[Stradama's Lost Ledger]]

==Description==
Is{{sic}} is such a shame what happened to poor Margrave Stradama. Just between us, she was once one of our most favored trading partners. When things get lost in [[Maldraxxus]] they tend to end up at the bottom of her blighted pools.

You would not, perhaps, be interested in continuing this relationship on her behalf? We would, of course, compensate you quite well.

I am sure she has little use for these possessions in her current state.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
Oh, it is you again.

==Completion==
Oh my, this is quite a find. It is a catalogue of some of Stradama's procured objects, hidden away within her pools of plague. We will make good use of this, to be sure.

Choose something to take with you, you have earned it.
