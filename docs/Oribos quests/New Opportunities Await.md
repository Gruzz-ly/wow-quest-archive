==Description==
Going somewhere in a hurry? Ah, yes. You, [[Maw Walker]]--you would not happen to be venturing to explore the new, mysterious mass within the [[Maw]], would you?

I do wonder what secrets it holds.

Perhaps there is something we can do to help one another.

If this is of interest to you then let us continue our discussion. If not, move along. I will find someone else to do the job.
