'''Eyes of the Wolf''' begins the [[:Return to Lordaeron]] part of the [[Shadowlands epilogue]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Calia Menethil]] in [[Brill]], [[Tirisfal Glades]].
*Speak to [[Gilnean Greymage]] for a teleport

==Description==
An alarming rumor has reached me, thanks to our [[Spy|spies]].

The [[Forsaken]] are mustering in Tirisfal Glades. For what purpose, I do not know. Notably, Calia Menethil has gone there as well.

We must know more of what they are up to, now that the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|accursed Banshee Queen]] no longer unites them.

Go, don a disguise and see what you can discover. Observe everything. And if there is opportunity to gain their trust and learn more, do as they ask.

I eagerly await your report.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Calia studies you closely for a moment, a smile on her lips.>

You will fit right in. And do not fear, I will not reveal you to the others here.

But please understand, many of the Forsaken were once citizens of Lordaeron. They are trying to do something extraordinary here, and I promise, if you play along and help them, it will be worth the effort.

It will make for a better Azeroth.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|You must don a disguise and travel deep into enemy territory. Do not let down your guard.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|In life, Calia Menethil endured more than her share of sorrow. She may not be a typical undead, but the Forsaken are not to be trusted.}}

;Speaking with Genn after accepting the quest
:We cannot be lax in our viligance. Much remains to be done, and much to be paid for.
:{{Gossip|How can I spy on the Forsaken without getting caught?}}
:You will be disguised as one of the Horde. It may not be an exact match for your features, but it should fool them.
:Remember, do not attack hem, and do what they ask you to do.
:We must know what they are plotting, and what they intend to do about Gilnease.
:{{Gossip|Why is Calia important?}}
:Calia Menethil was once a member of the royal family of Lordaeron, and a priestess. But her brother, Arthas, is the one more infamous.
:She was another victim to both the Scourge and to Sylvanas. The former killed her family, and the latter killed Calia herself in a brazen, heartless betrayal.
:She was raised from death by a naary and seems intent to continue her aim to help the former citizens of Lordaeron.

;Speaking with the Gilnean Greymage
:Yes?
:{{Gossip|Send me to Tirisfal Glades.}}

The player is teleported to the [[North Coast]] and has the Veiled buff.

;Approaching Calia
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|Who are--ah, my apologies. I did not recognize you at first.}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|I hope that the old wolf has sent you to help. I believe doing so could benefit the [[Alliance]] just as much as the [[Horde]].}}

==Progression==
