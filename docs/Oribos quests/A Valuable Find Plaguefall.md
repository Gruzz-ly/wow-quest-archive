==Objectives==
Obtain A Slimy Correspondence from [[Margrave Stradama]] in [[Plaguefall]].
* [[A Slimy Correspondence]]

==Description==
Life in [[Maldraxxus]] is one of constant warfare, the great houses in perpetual competition with one another. Every once in a great while, a house lord obtains an item or piece of knowledge of such rarity that it tips the scales in their favor.

It is possible, even probable, that this was the cause of the fate that befell the [[House of Plagues]].

I do not need to tell you how valuable such a rarity would be to us, do I?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}
You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
Yes? I am quite busy here.

==Completion==
I can only decipher a few words of this missive, give me a moment.

It appears to be a warning from the Margrave to another lord of Maldraxxus, or perhaps another place.

I see mention of the [[Primus]], and discussion of his fate. Or someone else's? It is hard to tell. It appears to point to a location, but I cannot understand the description of the location.

This may be more valuable than you know for the fate of the Shadowlands. Choose a reward, I will continue my work on this.
