==Objectives==
The Voice of the Arbiter wishes you to join them in the Arbiter's chamber.
*Accompany [[Tal-Inara]] to visit the [[Arbiter]] {{co|40.8|65.8|Oribos}}
*Ask about the Arbiter {{co|50.2|50.4|Oribos|3}}
*Listen to Tal-Inara
*Talk to Tal-Inara to return {{co|50.2|50.4|Oribos|3}}

==Description==
I am Tal-Inara, Honored Voice of the Arbiter. I speak for she who is ever silent.

The Arbiter watches over [[Oribos]]. She blesses us with her wisdom. Every [[mortal]] [[soul]] that enters the [[Shadowlands]] passes before her for judgment.

In the merest fraction of a moment, she sees every glory, every folly, every joy, every regret. With this knowledge, she chooses an ideal afterlife for that soul.

At least, she did. Not long ago, catastrophe struck, and ...

Come. Some things are better seen than explained.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Purpose guides us always.

==Completion==
We may find a shared cause in the Purpose. It has sent you to us.

==Notes==
Speak with Tal-Inara:
:The Purpose has sent you to us. I know it.

:{{gossip|I will join you.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|I pray the Arbiter will awaken in your presence, mortal.}}

Tal-Inara teleports themself and the player to the Crucible. There, The Arbiter is present, but apparently asleep. Speak with Tal-Inara to continue:
:The Purpose has sent you to us. I know it.

:{{gossip|What is this place?}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|She is unchanged. Ever silent. Ever still.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|When you arrived in Oribos, I saw the Arbiter stir for the first time in many cycles. It gave me hope that she would awaken and resume her blessed Purpose.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Mere words cannot describe the glory that was. Step forward, that I may show you.}}
:''A [[Shadowlands in-game cinematics|cinematic]] plays, "Breaking the Arbiter"''
{{#ev:youtube|eB5FB4jimXg}}
:{{text|bossemote|For uncounted eons, the Shadowlands was in perfect order.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Infinite afterlives, with Oribos, the Eternal City, as the shining heart.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Every mortal soul came before the Arbiter. And she, ever wise, experienced all that had shaped a soul in life.}}
:{{text|bossemote|With this knowledge, she consigned every soul to the afterlife it justly deserved.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Until...}}
:''A red soul appears far above the soul stream, streaking straight through it to crash into the Arbiter. She contorts and shrieks as red lightning streaks over her, until she falls dormant and all souls start flowing straight down to the Maw.''
:{{text|bossemote|In that dread moment, our perfect order was shattered.}}
:{{text|bossemote|And so it is that every soul, kind and cruel alike, is denied its rightful afterlife, and instead is damned to the inescapable torment of the Maw.}}

On the other side of the pre-rendered cinematic:
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Now souls rich with anima travel only to the Maw. We have tried everything to stop it, to awaken our blessed Arbiter... to no avail.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Without anima, drought has gripped the Shadowlands. The afterlives have grown isolated. Fear and uncertainty haunt us all.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|With countless souls feeding the Jailer, I fear he may grow strong enough to break free from the Maw.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|It is said he is filled with hatred for the Arbiter. If he strikes her down, it would bring the end of everything the First Ones made.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Return to the lower levels. The overseers will prepare you for what is to come.}}

Speak with Tal-Inara again:
:The Purpose has sent you to us. I know it.

:{{gossip|I am ready to return.}}
