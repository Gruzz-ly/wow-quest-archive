==Objectives==
Complete 5 rounds of Solo Shuffle.
*Solo Shuffle rounds (5)

==Description==
Seems it is time you prove yourself alone.

There's a chance for continual conflict, but this has to be undertaken by yourself. Sometimes you have to fight along side enemies to understand their tactics, this seems like a chance.

Good luck.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Excellent. You fight so fiercely to claim a piece of ground. The Observer will find that intriguing.
