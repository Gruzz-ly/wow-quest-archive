==Objectives==
Obtain a Strange Doll from [[Devos]], Paragon of Doubt in the [[Spires of Ascension]].
* [[Strange Doll]]

==Description==
The [[Kyrian]]s of [[Bastion]] serve a unique role in the [[Shadowlands]], ferrying [[mortal]] [[soul]]s from their [[Plane|realms]] to ours. They are able to do so in great numbers, it would seem, in times of crisis or devastation.

We would like to know more about their travels to the realms beyond.

Surely one of them has brought something back from another land? They are, after all, so very interested in memories.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
How may I assist you?

==Completion==
A strange bauble, likely from another world. Yet, why would the paragon have brought this with her?

Perhaps when carrying the soul of a child, as a reminder of something she had thought lost within herself? I will ponder this.

You may choose a reward from our stores.
