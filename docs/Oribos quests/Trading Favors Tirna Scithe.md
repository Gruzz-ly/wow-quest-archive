==Objectives==
Obtain an Engorged Gorm Larva from [[Tred'ova]] in the [[Mists of Tirna Scithe]].
* [[Engorged Gorm Larva]]

==Description==
The [[gorm]] devour anything in their path when left unchecked. We have sold more than a few of them as both pets and weapons. You do not want to see what a [[Planet|world]] looks like when they are introduced to it and allowed to infest.

Or perhaps, mhm, you do? For some, that is entertainment.

It is difficult for us to explore [[Ardenweald]] with things as they are at this time. A fat, healthy gorm [[larva]] would fetch a fine price on the markets. I trust my meaning is understood?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}
You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
Have you completed the task?

==Completion==
Oh, what is this? It is so bulbous and squirming, it must be close to the next molting. I am something of an amateur gorm-breeder myself, and will find a proper place to raise this one.

You may trust that I intend to destroy no worlds, I give you my word.

Now, I must tend to him, gather something from our stocks on your way out.
