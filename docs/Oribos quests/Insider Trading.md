==Objectives==
Speak with various [[broker]] [[cartel]]s around [[Oribos]].
*[[Emissary Ba'silk|Cartel Ba]] spoken to {{co|47.7|72.7|Oribos}}
*[[Zo'sorg|Cartel Zo]] spoken to {{co|34.5|57.4|Oribos}}
*[[Foreman Au'brak|Cartel Au]] spoken to {{co|40.3|32.8|Oribos}}
*[[Overseer Ta'readon|Cartel Ta]] spoken to {{co|64.4|68.3|Oribos}}

==Description==
I am the foremost expert on broker culture. However, relationships between cartels are complicated and unstable.

[[Cartel So]] holds a small presence here in Oribos, which means the other cartels may have knowledge that I do not. Ask around; with your renown, surely they'll have whatever information that we are missing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Have you had a chance to speak with the other cartels?

==Completion==
How rude! They should be aware of who they are talking to.

I apologize for my kin, [[Maw Walker]].

==Notes==
[[Cartel Ta]], [[Overseer Ta'readon]] in the [[Hall of Curiosities]]:
:Welcome to our bazaar, my friend. We are here to serve.
{{gossip|What can you tell me about Cartel So?}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Ta'readon|Cartel Ta avoids meddling in the affairs of others. It is to protect business. I am sure you understand.}}

[[Cartel Ba]], [[Emissary Ba'silk]], in the [[Enclave]]:
:Maw Walker.
:How may I be of service to one of your kind? I trust my kin have found ways to make your stay here more comfortable.
:Like you, this is a temporary home for us. It seems our own purposes intersect here.
{{gossip|What can you tell me about Cartel So?}}
:{{text|say|Emissary Ba'silk|We have little to gain from lesser cartels. Whatever Cartel Al and Cartel So are bickering over, it is not our concern.}}

[[Cartel Zo]], [[Zo'sorg]], in the [[Enclave]]:
:Well met, Maw Walker.
{{gossip|What can you tell me about Cartel So?}}
:{{text|emote|Zo'sorg waves off your question, shooing you away.}}

[[Cartel Au]], [[Foreman Au'brak]], in the [[Hall of Shapes]]:
:Welcome, stranger. We are at your service.
{{gossip|What can you tell me about Cartel So?}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Au'brak|You have been seen with Al'dalil. A word of caution: choose your friends carefully, and your enemies more so.}}
