==Objectives==
Affix the Helm of Domination fragment to the console.
* Affix the [[Helm of Domination]]
* [[Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|See if it works]]
*Speak with Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in The Enclave.

==Description==
It is disappointing that you were unable to stir the [[Arbiter]], but we must not give up hope.

Your continued presence in the [[Shadowlands]] may help our cause. Perhaps your efforts would benefit from creating a tether to the [[Plane|mortal plane]].

The [[Shadowlands Map|map table]] in this chamber was put in place long ago by the [[First Ones]], the wise architects of all you see.

If you have a memento from [[Azeroth|your homeworld]], place it there. The table's magic can establish a connection.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>! I am relieved you survived that realm of darkness.

I am eager to hear the tale.

==Notes==
[[File:Shadowlands Map with Helm.jpg|thumb|The map with the Helm of Domination affixed]]
Step forward to the [[Shadowlands Map]] behind the overseers and interact with it. A cutscene plays, showing a fragment of the Helm of Domination hovering over the table. Suddenly, a Death Gate opens, as [[Bolvar Fordragon]] and a few [[Ebon Blade]] walk through.
