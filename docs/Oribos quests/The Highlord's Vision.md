==Objectives==
Find out what Bolvar senses inside Torghast.
* Speak to [[Thrall]]
* Focus on the [[Helm of Domination]] {{co|39.5|69.2|Oribos}}

==Description==
<Thrall's brow is furrowed.>

We were speaking with [[Bolvar Fordragon|the Highlord]] when he was struck by a jolt of agony.

He said he could see something stirring in [[Maw|the Maw]]. Inside [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|the Jailer's tower]].

The pain seems to be getting worse. We need to find out what he's sensing.

==Progress==
We must know the truth.

==Completion==
This is dire indeed. 

==Notes==
Speak with Thrall:
:Bolvar suffers. Dark forces are moving against us.
{{gossip|What happened to Bolvar?}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|What is it, Highlord? What do you sense?}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|A weapon... forged in the fires of Torghast. A mourneblade is born.}}
:{{text|say|[[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]|A... mourneblade? Oh, no...}}
:{{text|say|[[Taelia Fordragon]]|Anduin's still captive there! Has something happened to him, father?}}
:{{text|say|[[Calia Menethil]]|I fear for Anduin as well. But is it safe for the Highlord to peer inside? The toll it takes on him...}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|There is a price to be paid for communing with that darkness again. But I must see. We all must know!}}

Focus on the Helm of Domination in the center of the table, and a [[Shadowlands in-game cinematics|cinematic]] plays:

{{#ev:youtube|MPOvUQIbP9s}}

''[[Sylvanas]] walks up to [[the Jailer]] overseeing a [[Maw guard]] forgemaster striking a sword on an anvil.''

{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|[[Sire Denathrius]] has [[Redemption for the Redeemer|been taken prisoner]]. What is our plan to recover him?}}

{{text|bossemote|The Jailer|Every soul has its purpose. Denathrius has fulfilled his.}}

''The Jailer opens a small portal and pulls a blue soul fragment crystal out of it.''

{{text|bossemote|The Jailer|We must forge our next weapon.}}

''Sylvanas casts a dubious look as the Jailer hands the crystal to the blacksmith.''

{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|He's not ready.}}

''The blacksmith places the crystal on the sword and strikes again.''

{{text|bossemote|The Jailer|Then a more direct approach is necessary. We have not come this far only to falter now. You know what must be done.}}

''Later, [[Anduin Wrynn]] is standing in his runescribed circle as he hears Sylvanas approach, with a sword in her hand.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|There she is again. You know, these endless lectures of yours--}}

{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|...have failed to convince you. Regardless, the conversation is over. One way or another, we will have you.}}

''Anduin glances down at what Sylvanas is wielding and reacts for a moment before regaining his poker face.''

{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|So I will offer this, one last time. Join our cause, or be made to serve.}}

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|What kind of choice is that? Why even give me...}}

''Anduin catches himself, realizing.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|It's the choice you never had.}}

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Despite all your grand designs, there's still some shred of your mortality haunting you, as if the Banshee Queen hasn't entirely eclipsed the Ranger General.}}

''Sylvanas's facade cracks a bit, as she clenches her wrist and looks away, unable to keep eye contact with Anduin.''

{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Don't.}}

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Now I understand why you brought me here. Why you've tried so hard to persuade me. Because if you can get me to let go of hope, you finally can, too.}}

{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Enough!}}

''Sylvanas points the sword at Anduin, revealing it as [[Kingsmourne]], a sword that looks suspiciously like a runeforged version of [[Shalamayne]], which Anduin was last seen wielding during the events of [[Stand as One]].''

{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Submit. You are only making this harder on yourself.}}

''Anduin reacts to the sword being thrust at him for a moment before gathering himself.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Not harder on me. Right now, you hold all the power. How will you use it?}}

''Sylvanas enunciates every word, almost trying to convince herself of what she says.''

{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|I've not come this far to falter now.}}

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Then why do you hesitate?}}

''She tightens her grip on the sword.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Make your choice... Sylvanas Windrunner.}}
