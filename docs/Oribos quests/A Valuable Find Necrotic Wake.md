==Objectives==
Obtain "The Origin of Death" from [[Nalthor the Rimebinder]] in the [[Necrotic Wake]].
* [[The Origin of Death]]

==Description==
Once in a rare while, we find ourselves in possession of an object of exceptionally cryptic origin. These objects allow us a brief glimpse into the realms beyond our comprehension.

It may seem to you that I speak in riddles, yet so much of this realm is shrouded in mystery, even to us.

There are others that have sought to unravel the history of this realm. Should you happen upon one of their works, I will offer you a trade of exceptional value.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}
You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
What sort of tome is this? May I leaf through it for a moment?

Well then, this is quite a find. It represents many years cataloguing everything Nalthor knew about the origins of our world. The many curiosities of this place, from Zovaal's domain in the Maw, to the function of this strange city of Oribos.

It is surmised that they all tie together.

I shall devour it with glee. Come, you may take one of our most prized possessions for it.
