==Objectives==
Obtain the Golden Orb of Energy from [[Lord Chamberlain (tactics)|Lord Chamberlain]] in the [[Halls of Atonement]].
* [[Golden Orb of Energy]]

==Description==
The aristocracy of [[Revendreth]] trade in decadent and priceless shows of status with one another, but rarely with our kind. Often they will travel with a piece or two affixed to their garb as a show of status.

Now, many of their kind have sided with [[Sire Denathrius]] and against the denizens of the [[Shadowlands]]. They must, of course, be stopped.

Of course.

Yet should you, in the process of doing so, relieve them of some of these possessions, know that I will trade generously.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Intricate Fae Groveweave
|Venerable Kyrian Defender
|Storied Maldraxxian Boneblade
|Ancient Venthyr Relic
}}
You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
How does the battle fare?

==Completion==
Now this is quite a find. A functional piece of the mysterious machinery that can be found around the [[Shadowlands]].

Look at how intricate the weaving of the golden orb is, how the energy seems to be contained from somewhere within, yet in a construct that is almost beyond imagining. What could have made such an object? Where are they now?

We shall begin to investigate with fervor. Do drop in if you find anything similar, and take a reward before you go.
