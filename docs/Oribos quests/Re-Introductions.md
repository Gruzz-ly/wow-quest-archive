==Objectives==
Speak with [[Tal-Inara]] within the [[Enclave]] in [[Oribos]].

==Description==
Though you have chosen your path, the fate of the [[Shadowlands]] has yet to be determined.

The power of the [[The Jailer|Banished One]] grows. It falls to you, and others of your kind, to thwart him.

The [[Arbiter]]'s Honored Voice, Tal-Inara, will aid you in choosing a covenant. Bolstering their strength offers our best chance at victory.

Let the [[Purpose]] guide you, <name>. Always.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, <name>. I was wondering when you were going to appear. Your aid is needed.
