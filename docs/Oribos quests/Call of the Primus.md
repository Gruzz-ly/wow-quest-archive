'''Call of the Primus''' begins the [[Zereth Mortis campaign]]—the [[patch 9.2]] portion of the [[Shadowlands campaign]]—and is automatically pushed upon login to all player characters who have completed at least the first three chapters of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Tal-Inara]] in [[Oribos]] to travel to the [[Crucible (Oribos)|Arbiter's Chamber]].
*Speak with Tal-Inara to travel to the Arbiter's Chamber{{co|38.9|70.0|Oribos}}

==Description==
Though we fought to stop [[the Jailer]] in the [[Sanctum of Domination]], we failed. He enveloped Oribos in the [[Maw]], struck down the [[Arbiter]], and opened the way to [[Zereth Mortis]].

The time has come to follow him.

Within the Arbiter's Chamber, we will forge our own path.

Hurry, [[Maw Walker]]. The fate of the [[Shadowlands]], and all the [[Plane|realms]] beyond, is at stake.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There is but one final [[sigil]] needed to pursue Zovaal.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|The Primus|Maw Walker, the time has come to resume our pursuit of the Jailer. I await you in Oribos.}}

Speak with Tal-Inara at her usual spot{{co|38.9|70.0|Oribos}} in the [[Enclave]]:
:The Primus awaits us in the Arbiter's Chamber.
:Shall we depart?
:{{Gossip|I am ready to go.}}

In the Crucible, the Primus is waiting in front of a small crowd consisting of Tal-Inara, [[Overseer Kah-Delen]], [[Overseer Kah-Sher]], and various covenant representatives: [[Lady Moonberry]] and [[Lord Herne]] for the [[night fae]], [[Pelagos]] and [[Kleia]] for the [[kyrian]], [[Prince Renathal]] and [[Nadjia the Mistblade]] for the [[venthyr]], and [[Baroness Vashj]] for the [[necrolord]]s. Tal-Inara, Kleia, and Pelagos have special gossip text.

;Tal-Inara
:Never before have we been tested as such. However, I trust in the [[Purpose]].

;Kleia
:We cannot lose hope, even in the darkest moments. That is when we need it the most.

;Pelagos
:All we can do is keep moving forward.

An [[Attendant Functionary]] offers transport back down if needed:
:When you are ready, I can return you to return{{Sic}} to the enclave{{Sic}}.
:{{Gossip|Return me to the [[Ring of Fates]].}}

If the player decides to jump off the platform for some reason, they'll resurrect at the normal Oribos graveyard and have to speak with Tal-Inara to get back to the Crucible.

Upon turning in to the Primus, a cutscene plays:
:{{Text|say|The Primus|With the Maw Walker's aid, the covenants have been renewed. Yet one sigil is still required to pursue Zovaal: the Arbiter's.}}
:''Tal-Inara floats forward.''
:{{Text|say|Tal-Inara|Though her presence is lost to darkness, her voice still sings... within us.}}
:''Kah-Sher and Kah-Delen float up next to her.''
:{{Text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|Blessed be her voice.}}
:{{Text|say|The Primus|Together, we shall manifest the final sigil.}}
:''The Primus summons the four covenant sigils on the surrounding pillars: night fae, kyrian, necrolord, and venthyr. He then steps to the side and allows the attendants to take the center stage.''
:{{Text|say|Tal-Inara|This is our purpose.}}
:''A large, dormant gateway descends closer to the central platform. The attendants and the Primus begin casting a spell. A shadowy image of the Arbiter briefly appears behind the attendants as they manifest the Arbiter's sigil in the air.''
:{{Text|say|The Primus|The way is open!}}
:''A glowing portal opens at the center of the gateway.''
