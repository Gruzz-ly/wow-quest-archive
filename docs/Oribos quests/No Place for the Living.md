==Objectives==
The Overseers want to know more about how you escaped the [[Maw]].
* [[Overseer Kah-Delen|Speak]] to the Overseers
* [[Tal-Inara|Listen]] to the Overseers

==Description==
A living [[mortal]] ... incredible!

Forgive my astonishment. I am Kah-Delen, an overseer of the [[Arbiter]]'s [[attendant]]s here in the Eternal City of [[Oribos]].

You stand within the heart of the [[Shadowlands]]. While we are accustomed to receiving souls from all manner of [[Planet|worlds]] within the mortal [[Plane|realm]], never before has one arrived that is quite so ... corporeal.

Answer honestly, mortal. Did you truly escape the Maw?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So where did you come from, stranger?

==Completion==
Finally, the Purpose may be guiding us again.

==Notes==
Speak with Kah-Delen:
:A mortal in Oribos? The Purpose has brought a mortal to us?

:{{gossip|Yes, I escaped the Maw.}}
:''A scene starts.''
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|Every attendant in Oribos is taught that the Maw is unbreachable. That the malevolent souls within were sealed away for all eternity.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|This mortal's escape might mean the prison is weakening. If true, the Banished One could ...}}
:''Tal-Inara teleports in.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Kah-Delen! Kah-Sher! Purpose be praised! At long last, the Arbiter has stirred!}}
:''The scene ends.''
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|Wondrous news, Honored Voice! Mere moments ago, there was a disturbance at the boundary of the Maw. Then this mortal appeared, claiming to have broken free of it.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|A living mortal! Surely their presence here serves the Purpose. If the Arbiter reacted to their arrival, perhaps they are the key to waking her.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|Is this mortal worthy of such an audience? They may prove to be an agent of the Jailer!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|It is the Arbiter's place to judge souls, Kah-Sher, not ours. I will bring this mortal before her. With her voice have I spoken.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|Blessed be her Voice.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|Blessed be her Voice.}}
