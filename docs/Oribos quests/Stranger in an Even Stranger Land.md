'''Stranger in an Even Stranger Land''' begins the [[Oribos]] portion of the [[Shadowlands intro experience]]. Players must have escaped the [[Maw]] in [[Stand as One]] to reach this point.

==Objectives==
Find your way inside Oribos to learn what is happening.
* [[Protector Captain|Try to communicate]] {{co|23.7|49.6|Oribos}}
* Follow the Guards into Oribos
* Speak to [[Overseer Kah-Delen|Kah-Delen]]

==Description==
<You arrive alone at the precipice of a strange city, knowing the leaders of [[Azeroth]] remain trapped in the Maw.

Wherever you are, it is clearly very, very far from home.

It appears your arrival has been noticed.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Try to communicate with the guards and enter the city.

==Completion==
Could it be? An actual mortal being in the Eternal City? The Purpose be served!

==Notes==
This quest starts upon entering [[Oribos]], after leaving the [[Maw]] in [[Stand as One]]:
:{{text|say|Attendant Protector|An agent of the Maw is attacking Oribos! Defend the [[Arbiter]]!}}
:{{text|say|Protector Captain|Hold. The Maw's power does linger upon them, but I sense ... No, that cannot be possible!}}

Step forward and speak with the highlighted [[Protector Captain]]:
:Who are you, stranger?
:{{gossip|Where am I? Have I escaped the Maw?}}

Nearby protectors will say any of the following:
*{{text|say|Attendant Protector|An intruder? How is that possible?}}
*{{text|say|Attendant Protector|Did they just escape the Maw? Impossible!}}
*{{text|say|Attendant Protector|From the Maw? I refuse to believe it!}}
*{{text|say|Attendant Protector|Is our faith in the Purpose being tested?}}
*{{text|say|Attendant Protector|It must be the Purpose. It guides us always.}}
*{{text|say|Attendant Protector|That being reeks of the Maw!}}
*{{text|say|Attendant Protector|We must bring them to the overseers at once!}}

Follow the spoken-to protector:
:{{text|say|Protector Captain|Come with us, stranger.}}

Inside the Enclave, more denizens respond:
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|The reports from our scryers were unmistakable. The Maw shuddered for a moment, as if reacting to some change.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|An ill omen, to be certain. What can it mean?}}<!-- Didn't show up. -->
:{{text|say|Attendant Protector|Overseers! This stranger appeared at the city's edge. I believe them to be... a living mortal.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|Another unexpected development. We will see to their reception.}}

Speak with Kah-Delen:
:A mortal in Oribos? The Purpose has brought a mortal to us?
:{{gossip|Are you in charge here? Where am I?}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|Impossible!}}
