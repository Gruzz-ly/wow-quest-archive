==Objectives==
Establish portals back to Azeroth.
* Speak to the [[Ebon Blade Acolyte|Acolyte]] {{co|40.0|64.0|Oribos}}
* Head to the landing {{co|21.8|50.5|Oribos}}
* Establish portals back to [[Azeroth]] {{co|21.8|50.5|Oribos}}
* Return to the [[Overseer Kah-Sher|Overseers]]

==Description==
The [[Helm of Domination|Helm]] fragment connected us while you were in the [[Maw]]. As if through a darkened pane of glass, I saw glimpses of what you endured. The terrors you faced.

At least the heroes of [[Azeroth]] yet live. They must be saved.

By affixing the Helm here, you gave us a tether to Azeroth that served to bring a few of us across the veil. But you, and other heroes who join us, require a stronger connection.

Our acolytes can open portals back. No doubt these attendants will be particular about their placement.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you helped the acolytes open the portals yet?

==Completion==
Your path and the Purpose are now entwining.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|You seek to open a doorway back to the realm of the living? Oh dear. Oribos is crowded enough with so many Brokers arriving every day.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|Now, now, Kah-Sher, be hospitable. Mortal, I suggest establishing your portals where you first arrived... just outside the city.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|As you wish. <Name>, please confirm where our acolytes should open the portals.}}

Speak with the Acolyte behind Bolvar:
:Greetings, <name>, Lord Bolvar asked us to aid you.
:{{gossip|Come with me. Let's head outside.}}

Follow the two acolytes back outside and speak with the active one:
:Greetings, <name>, Lord Bolvar asked us to aid you.
:{{gossip|Summon the portals here.}}
:{{text|say|Ebon Blade Acolyte|I have opened countless portals in my lifetime. But never one that connected two planes of reality.}} ''(human acolyte)''
:{{text|say|Ebon Blade Acolyte|I thought death was the end of existence. Here, it seems, Death is a power that offers new beginnings.}} ''(orc acolyte)''

The human and orc death knights open standing portals back to Stormwind and Orgrimmar, respectively. Head back inside and return to Kah-Sher.
