==Objectives==
Obtain a Medallion of Orientation from [[General Kaal]] in the [[Sanguine Depths]].
* [[Medallion of Orientation]]

==Description==
The generals of [[Revendreth]] are outfitted with only the finest arms and armor, procured by [[Sire Denathrius]] in his unquenchable appetite for power. In terms of profitable trades and exchanges, he has been a shrewd partner in trade to us.

It would please me greatly to see the return of some relics that were traded in a way that benefited him far more than us. There are few things more insulting to my kind.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}
You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
What have you brought before me?

==Completion==
Yes, yes this is exactly what I was speaking about. The foolish generals of Revendreth would use this medallion to orient themselves during travel in unknown areas, but their ambitions were small.

For my people, who have traveled beyond the known lands, such a thing is invaluable when attempting to chart a way to return.

We will make great use of this, it is good to see it returned. Here, a prize for you.
