After this is max-level content, starting with the [[Covenant Campaign]] and access to the [[Maw]] and [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]].

For alts, this can be the beginning of their leveling experience had they chosen to twist [[The Threads of Fate]].

==Description==
[[File:Shadowlands Covenant Map.jpg|thumb|The covenant map between Tal-Inara and Bolvar]]

;First character
:Each covenant is vital to the [[Shadowlands]]. Though they often seem at odds with one another, this too is part of the Purpose.
:All the covenants need to grow strong to face the threat of [[the Jailer]]. But your efforts cannot be divided. They must be focused upon a single path. Other mortals may make a different choice.
:The time has come for you to take a side. 
:Speak to your allies. Then make your choice at the map of the Shadowlands before me.

;Alts
:Each covenant is vital to the Shadowlands. Though they have been isolated and divided as of late, the Purpose depends on the success of their efforts.
:All of the covenants must bolster their strength to face the threat of the Banished One. But your contributions cannot be divided. They must be focused upon a single path. Other mortals may make a different choice.
:Speak to your potential allies. Then make your choice at the map of the Shadowlands before me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Choosing Your Purpose (achievement)]]
*Covenant abilities (for alts only)

==Progress==
Have you made your decision yet?

==Completion==
All is as expected. Trust always in the [[Arbiter]]'s plan.

==Notes==
There are two versions of this quest. The first is available to level 60 players who have completed the first four [[Shadowlands campaign|zone storylines]]. The second is offered to alts at level 50 if they chose to twist [[The Threads of Fate]].

In the area are four characters representing the four covenants, and a number of training dummies. All of the representatives can provide players the covenant signature and class ability to test with.

After speaking with the four representatives, interact with the [[Shadowlands Covenant Map]] between Tal-Inara and Bolvar to make a decision.

Tal-Inara will offer the next quest, continuing the [[Shadowlands campaign]]: 
*Kyrian: [[Report to Adrestes]]
*Necrolords: [[Report to Mevix]]
*Night Fae: [[Report to Moonberry]]
*Venthyr: [[Report to Draven]]

Make sure to actually pick up the quest before heading to the covenant sanctum!

For alts on the Threads of Fate, Tal-Inara will instead offer [[Aiding the Shadowlands]], which grants a choice to one of the four zones to level through first.
