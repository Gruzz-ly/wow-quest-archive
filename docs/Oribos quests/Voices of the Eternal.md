==Objectives==
Listen to the plan.
*Ask [[Tal-Inara]] to begin
*Return to the Enclave in Oribos.

==Description==
<[[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]] peers at the grand figures before him, at the numberless gateways stretching out into the ether.>

[[Crucible (Oribos)|This chamber]] is... truly wondrous.

Yet there is no time to be awestruck. The [[Tal-Inara|Honored Voice]] must begin this meeting at once.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
The [[Winter Queen]] must be [[The Jailer|the Jailer's]] next target.

We must do all we can to protect her.

And I have a few ideas how we can do that...

==Notes==
Speak with Tal-Inara:
:I shall address the honored ones gathered here.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to begin.}}

A real-time cinematic plays:
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|In the Arbiter's name, we answer the call of the Eternal Ones.}}
:''Tal-Inara bows.''
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|This brazen attack on Bastion must be answered.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Has your wound healed, Kyrestia?}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|No. But that is of little consequence compared to what was stolen.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|What was the Jailer after?}}
[[File:Voices of the Eternal - sigil.jpg|thumb|The Winter Queen's sigil.]]
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Long ago, each of the [[Eternal Ones]] was given a symbol of our [[covenant]]'s purpose.}}
:''The Winter Queen manifests an image of the Night Fae sigil in her hand.''
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Yet [[The Jailer|Zovaal]] saw these [[sigil]]s as keys to forbidden knowledge.}}
:''The queen dismisses the image.''
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|When we rebuked his [[Heretic|heresy]], he tried to claim them by force.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|But in the end, the [[Primus]] led us to victory.}}
:''The covenant representatives look at the broken platform for the Jailer.''
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|And for his treachery, Zovaal was exiled forevermore.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Yet even bound to the [[Maw]], he found allies to aid his cause.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|No doubt [[Sire Denathrius]] willingly offered his sigil to the Banished One.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|We have found no such sigil within the [[Seat of the Primus|sanctum of the Primus]].}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|The essence of the Arbiter remains here. It must be protected.}}
:''Bolvar steps forward.''
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|The [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Ebon Blade]] will help defend the Eternal City.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|But this will not be the Jailer's only target.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|No. Even now, his malevolence encroaches upon my groves.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|The [[necrolords]] will drive these invaders from Ardenweald!}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|The [[venthyr]] will fight beside your armies, Draka.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|We will rally the covenants' forces and make our stand.}}
:''Bolvar turns to focus on the Maw Walker.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Let it be so. With her voice have I spoken.}}
:''Bolvar, the Maw Walker, and Tal-Inara bow before the Arbiter as the covenant representatives disappear.''

On the other side, speak with Tal-Inara to return to the [[Enclave]]:
:I shall address the honored ones gathered here.
:{{Gossip|<Leave the Arbiter's Chamber.>}}

The turn-in is not with Tal-Inara or Bolvar, but rather [[Lady Moonberry]].
