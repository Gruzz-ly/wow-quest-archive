==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ta'nla the Identifier]] at the [[Night Market]].

==Description==
We [[broker]]s have found that it is in our best interests to remain mobile. And discreet.

A number of our cities and outposts are tucked away in the [[In-Between]], capable of moving from place to place.

Much to my chagrin, it seems I have lost track of [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]].

I believe our best course of action is to ask [[Cartel Ta]] for access. They pride themselves on keeping track of such things.

Let's try our luck with those at the Night Market in [[Revendreth]]. They may be more forthcoming than their [[Oribos]] kin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
You seek information?

That requires a transaction.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|Tazavesh can be an elusive city to reach. But surely someone at the Night Market will aid our journey.}}

The nearest flight point is at [[Wanecrypt Hill]] in [[Revendreth]]. Approach Tal'na:
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|Maw Walker! My friends here have been unusually taciturn. Perhaps you will have better luck.}}
