==Objectives==
Obtain the Unusual Automaton Parts from [[Tred'ova]] in the [[Mists of Tirna Scithe]].
* [[Unusual Automaton Parts]]

==Description==
The [[gorm]] are indiscriminate in what they consume, so long as it does not contain [[anima]]. A gorm queen that has lived for many generations may have any number of indestructible artifacts lodged within her belly. For this reason, sifting through a queen's carcass is not unlike treasure hunting for us.

One of the largest queens is currently consuming Tirna Scithe. She surely is bloated with valuables. Should you come upon anything particularly unusual, know that we will compensate you in kind.

==Rewards==
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
You look as if you have been sifting through [[gorm]] carcass {{sic}}, or perhaps that is simply what you always look like?

==Completion==
We have found only a few objects similar to this in all of our time here, that I am aware of. Whether it belonged to a race of creature or automatons that came before us, or they still exist somewhere, we do not know.

The metallic fragments of this piece appear similar in design to the walls that surround us here in [[Oribos]], yet we have never seen something like this moving around in the city.

I will add it to the cache of relics related to these mysteries. Take a suitable reward.
