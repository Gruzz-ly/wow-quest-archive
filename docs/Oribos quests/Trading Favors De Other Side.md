==Objectives==
Obtain a Golden Death Mask from [[Mueh'zala (tactics)|Mueh'zala]] in [[De Other Side]].
* [[Golden Death Mask]]

==Description==
[[Mueh'zala]] is an ancient and primitive creature that commands a place known as De Other Side. Little is known about this land, as we are not permitted to visit. We have sent many offers of trade, yet there has never been a reply.

A pity, as the few that have escaped Mueh'zala's clutches claim his domain to be a place of many oddities.

We would never ask you to venture into such danger. There is, however, a standing offer of trade for things procured from Mueh'zala's grasp.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
You have the stench of death about you.

==Completion==
Oh, this is quite a find, is it not? Something from The Other Side. We so rarely get to glimpse such things, I shall study this with interest. It would appear to be from a forgotten, primitive race that worshipped Mueh'zala.

A reward, of course, is in order. Make your choice.
