==Objectives==
Obtain the Tome of Dredger Alchemy from [[Lord Chamberlain]] in the [[Halls of Atonement]].
* [[Tome of Dredger Alchemy]]

==Description==
The mechanisms by which each land of the [[Shadowlands]] operates are quite intriguing. Yet, I have always held a particular fascination with the [[venthyr]] of [[Revendreth]].

How they siphon [[soul]]s of their sins, storing them in strange stones, and [[Dredger|dredge up minions from the muck]] that surrounds them -- it is all quite novel.

They keep their secrets close at hand, however, and will not willingly part with information. I offer trades for any of their tomes you might come into possession of.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}
You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
Have you fond something of interest?

==Completion==
A tome from [[Revendreth]]? Yes, let me see.

It chronicles the alchemical formulae necessary to form dredger pools, and various recipes for forming and utilizing the little creatures. They are quite a curiosity, as much a minion as a reagent.

I will gladly take this off your hands in exchange for a trade. Here, choose.
