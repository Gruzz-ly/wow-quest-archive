==Objectives==
Obtain Nalthor's Phlactory Instructions from [[Nalthor the Rimebinder]] in the [[Necrotic Wake]].
* [[Nalthor's Phylactery Instructions]]

==Description==
We of the [[broker]]s place value on things that may seem strange to an outsider like yourself. Objects that are unusual or one-of-a-kind are things we may find more valuable than others.

So let us make a deal, hm? Should you find yourself in possession of one such object, I will offer a trade for something you may find more valuable.

I hear that the forces of [[Maldraxxus]] have made an attack on [[Bastion]]. Such things rarely happen without objects of power in tow, no?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ascended Commendation#500 reputation
|Undying Army Commendation#500 reputation
|Wild Hunt Commendation#500 reputation
|Court of Harvesters Commendation#500 reputation
}}
You will also receive:
*[[Cartel Exchange Vessel]] x5

==Progress==
Have you found any objects of interest?

==Completion==
Ah, quite a find, we rarely get a glimpse into the mechanisms by which the [[House of Rituals]] enact their dark designs. I am eager to delve into this tome, purely in the interests of knowledge, of course.

You may choose from some of our procured items as a reward.
