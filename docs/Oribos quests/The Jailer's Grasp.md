'''The Jailer's Grasp''' concludes the [[Patch 9.0]] portion of the [[Shadowlands campaign]], and is required to begin the [[Chains of Domination campaign]] in [[patch 9.1]].

==Objectives==
[[File:The Jailer's Grasp.jpg|thumb|Bolvar held by the Jailer]]

Help [[Jaina Proudmoore]] sever [[the Jailer]]'s connection to [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]].
* Break the Helm's Grip

==Description==
By peering into the [[Maw]], Bolvar drew the Jailer's attention.

His worst fears have come to pass.

You must help me break the link, <name>! The fragment of [[Helm of Domination|the Helm]] is the key!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5x [[Multi-Modal Anima Container]]

==Completion==
The Jailer... is gone... from my mind.

Thank you, <name>. You saved me from a darker fate than you could ever know.

For that, you will ever have my thanks. 

==Notes==
Interact with the Helm of Domination:
:{{text|say|Helm of Domination|You were to herald my coming. Instead, you defied me!}}
:''Jaina also channels a frost spell into the helm, with the balance of power shifting back and forth.''
:{{text|say|Helm of Domination|A failure. [[Ner'zhul|Like those]] [[Arthas Menethil|who came before you]]!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia Fordragon|Father, resist him! Do not let him win!}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Fight, Highlord! We're with you!}}
:{{text|say|Helm of Domination|I will claim what is mine! Death comes for you all!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Hold on, Bolvar! Just a little more!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|[[Taelia Fordragon]]|Father!}}
:{{text|say|[[Thrall]]|Well done, Jaina. We nearly lost him.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Though we managed to stop the attack, I fear the danger is far from over.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|My thanks to all of you. But Jaina is right. The Jailer knows what we saw. He will use that knowledge against us.}}
:{{text|say|[[Baine Bloodhoof]]|We should gather our forces and attack Torghast! Anduin must be freed!}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|You've seen the Jailer's armies. We're not ready to launch a full-scale assault. If we follow our hearts and rush in, we could lose everything.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We will work with our allies in Oribos to rally the covenants. Only with their help do we stand a chance of stopping the Jailer... and saving Anduin.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Maw Walker, continue your efforts. Explore the dark reaches of Torghast. Fight for the Shadowlands. And when the time comes, we will claim victory!}}

Completing this quest unlocks a "[[Taelia Fordragon#Shadowlands 2|Stay awhile and listen]]" dialogue option from Taelia.
