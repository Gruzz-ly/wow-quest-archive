==Objectives==
Speak to [[Tal-Inara]] in [[Oribos]].

==Description==
I truly wish you could remain here and aid our cause--it is truly the most pressing manner in all the [[Shadowlands]]--but [[Revendreth]] alone cannot stand against the growing darkness.

You must return to Oribos and ensure the other realms do not falter in their commitments. Tal-Inara will be able to guide you appropriately.

Thank you once again for your aid, mortal. May our paths cross again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Completion==
Revendreth stands stronger for your efforts. The [[Purpose]] is clear. 

==Progression==
{{The Threads of Fate}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
