==Objectives==
Bring the Flickering Anima to [[Collector Ta'steld|Ta'steld]] in [[Oribos]].
* [[The Flickering Anima]] (provided)

==Description==
The strange anima shimmers with a gentle hum, barely larger than a candle. As your hand draws near it erupts, flooding your mind with a torrent of visions. Triumphs earned through blood, regrets etched in grief, serene stillness all too fleeting, the bitter taste of betrayal. The unbearable cascade threatens to shatter your mind like glass. 

Then, silence. The visions end leaving an image Oribos seared into your mind.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* 500x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Completion==
<Ta'steld takes the curious anima, studying the wisp as it dances in his hand.>

You were right to bring this to me. As a purveyor of lost curiosities, I know just what to do with this. My thanks, Champion.
