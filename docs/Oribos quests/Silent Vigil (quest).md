:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|[[Stormwind (kingdom)|Your kingdom]], and your friends, are awaiting your return.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Anduin Wrynn]]|My friends... the ones I almost killed... they believe my hands are clean.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But they don't feel clean.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|It is perilous to confuse what you are made to do with what you choose to do.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|How can I not when it all blurs together?}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It was so horrific... and exhilarating.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|And it sickens me to think that satisfaction... may have been mine.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Ah. So that's why you've come.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|You fear you might not be who you thought you were.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'm starting to wonder if I ever knew.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|For the first time in my life...}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'm afraid if I call on the [[Light]]...}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|...it won't answer.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|If I've no trust in myself, how can I expect my kingdom to trust me?}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|To put their faith in me... when mine has faltered.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Must you bear that weight?}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|A king does not have a choice.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|No choice?}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|I thought you believed in free will.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|<Laughs... and sighs>}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I need time to think.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|About many things.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Anduin...}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|I have faced who I was, and accepted what I've done.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Now, the work begins.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Yes. It does.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Farewell, Sylvanas Windrunner.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Until our paths cross again.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Farewell... Little Lion.}}
