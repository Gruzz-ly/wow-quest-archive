==Objectives==
[[File:Tracking the Thieves finale.jpg|thumb|A portal to Dalaran.]]
Follow [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] to help her discover who took the [[:Divine Bell]], and where they took it.  You may speak with [[Seamus Goldenkicks]] in [[Lion's Landing]] to be ported to [[Darnassus]].
*Track the Thieves of the Bell {{co|84.5|57.8|Darnassus}} / {{co|40.0|50.5|Teldrassil}}

==Description==
We WILL get to the bottom of this.

<Name>, you're coming with me.  We'll search every inch of this city if we have to, but we'll find out how they took the bell... and where.

I'm picking up traces of arcane magic here... we need to follow the trail!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
I've decided.

Certain members of the [[Kirin Tor]] have put their allegiance to the [[Horde]] above the order, and I will NOT tolerate it.  This is nothing short of a betrayal.

<Jaina's eyes flare with rage.>

Come with me, <name>.  We're going to clean up [[Dalaran]].

==Notes==
On accept, Jaina joins the party:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Come with me.}}
Blue, pulsing orbs of arcane magic lead from the entrance of the tree south away from the [[Cenarion Enclave]]. If you get separated from Jaina during the quest, she can be found back at the Cenarion Enclave.
{{Dialogue|
Hello, <name>.

On reaching the central island with the bank tree:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I had Darnassus LOCKED DOWN!  Every fumbling [[rogue]] that tried to sneak into the city, I CAUGHT them!  I snatched every two-bit charlatan that attempted to teleport through my traps!}} {{co|43.7|46.1|Darnassus}}
The path turns east, passing south of the [[Warrior's Terrace]].
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They couldn't possibly have gotten through... this was an inside job.  Somebody inside the city has the Bell, unless... no...}} {{co|65.0|47.0|Darnassus}}
The trail keeps leading east out of Darnassus proper past the main gate, then turns south around the side of a tree to reveal a portal to Dalaran!
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|These portals connect to Dalaran.  That means the Kirin Tor... MY OWN Kirin Tor... helped the Horde commit this atrocity.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will NOT be betrayed again!  Those responsible for this will be punished!}} {{co|84.5|57.8|Darnassus}} / {{co|40.0|50.5|Teldrassil}}
