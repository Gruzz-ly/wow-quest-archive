== Objectives ==
Bring the glowing fruit to [[Denalan]] at [[Lake Al'Ameth]].
*[[Glowing Fruit]] (provided)

==Description==
Hanging from beneath its fronds of this glowing plant is a large, round fruit.

Denalan would want to study this fruit, you are certain.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

== Progress ==
<Name>, you look like you have something to tell me.  Do you have news concerning the timberlings?

== Completion ==
You found this on [[Teldrassil]]?  Intriguing... this fruit is exotic.  Perhaps its seeds were brought here from far off.  Perhaps even as far as [[Azeroth (continent)|Azeroth]]!  And there's something about this fruit... it seems to have reacted very strangely with the soil of Teldrassil.

Thank you, <name>.  Now if you'll excuse me, I must study this further...

==Notes==
You will need one inventory spot free to accept this quest and receive the [[Glowing Fruit]], which is required to complete this quest.

;On completion

:{{text|say|Bogling|KILL!!!}}

Three [[Bogling]]s appear. They are hostile and will aggro onto any nearby player.
