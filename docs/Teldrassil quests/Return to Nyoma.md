== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Leora]] to hire a hippogryph to take you back to [[Dolanaar]]. Once you've arrived in Dolanaar, take Sister Aquinne's Note to [[Nyoma]].
* [[Sister Aquinne's Note]] (Provided)

== Description ==
It will be easy to get you a flight back to Dolanaar. Since you already know [[Fidelio]] in Dolanaar, you'll be able to fly back there without any problems.

Whenever you arrive in a new town, you should remember to speak to the flight master so that you can fly to and from the new location.

Speak with me when you're ready to hire a hippogryph to return to Dolanaar.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}}

== Progress ==
<Name>, you're back from [[Darnassus]]?

== Completion ==
It sounds like she loved it. Thank you for bringing the book to [[Sister Aquinne]], <name>. One of these days, I intend to take her up on her invitation to visit her in Darnassus.
