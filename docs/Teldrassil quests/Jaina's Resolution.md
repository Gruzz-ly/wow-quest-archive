==Objectives==
Use the portal from [[Darnassus]] to [[Dalaran]], then speak with [[Vereesa Windrunner]] on the other side.
*Take the portal from Darnassus to Dalaran

==Description==
For too long, I have toiled to mend fences between [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]]. Time and time again, I've given the Horde the benefit of the doubt - and time and time again, they stab me in the back.

I refuse to be betrayed again! If the Horde intends to use the [[Kirin Tor]] as a weapon against the Alliance, then they have no place in Dalaran.

Come with me, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
I will instruct you from here on out.

Jaina will be going down into the city to enforce our new rules.

==Notes==
The portal can be interacted with after accepting the quest, so click on it for a port. Again using the [[Violet Hold (instance)|Violet Hold]] loading graphic, Jaina and her Summoned Water Elemental make quick work of a handful of [[High Sunreaver Mage]]s guarding [[Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]]:
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Aethas Sunreaver!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You've betrayed the Kirin Tor, Sunreaver.  You've allowed Garrosh to move his forces through MY city.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|You have it all wrong, Jaina.  I did nothing.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You looked the other way.  You and your insubordinate kind are no longer welcome here.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|This is OUR city too, Proudmoore.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Hah!  I see.  I will remove the Sunreavers by force, then.}}
:''Jaina's water elemental kills the last two guards as Jaina encases Aethas in a block of ice.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You, Aethas, will be coming with me.}}
:''Jaina teleports herself and Aethas away.''
Exit the Violet Citadel and speak with [[Vereesa Windrunner]].
