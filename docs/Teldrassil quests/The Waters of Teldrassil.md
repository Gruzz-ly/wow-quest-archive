==Objectives==
Bring the Filled Vessel to [[Corithras Moonrage]] at the crossroads in front of [[Darnassus]].
* [[Filled Vessel]] (provided)

==Description==
Our tasks are done here for now. This water proved to be of great importance, but it wasn't originally meant for me. Go ahead and bring it back to Corithras at the crossroads, I'm sure he'd like you to deliver it to its original destination.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Verdigris Leggings
|Grassy Bindings
|Grassy Bracers
|Thicket Hammer
|Ashwood Bow

You will also receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
It is good to see you again. I sense that [[Tarindrella]]'s task went smoothly with you by her side.

==Completion==
Thank you for returning to me so swiftly. I have but one last task to ask of you. Shall we?
