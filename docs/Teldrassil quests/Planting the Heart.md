==Objectives==
Plant the Tainted Heart in [[Denalan's Planter]]. 
*[[Tainted Heart]] (provided)

==Description==
I have removed that foul moss from the heart, but it remains tainted...

Try placing the heart in my planter. It is filled with a nutritive soil that may cleanse and heal the heart.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive|Cleansed Timberling Heart}}

You will also receive:
*900 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
This planter is filled with soil, specially prepared by [[Denalan]].

==Completion==
You place the heart within the planter, and it quickly digs itself in!

A few seconds later it wriggles back out, cleansed. It pulses slightly... beckoning for you to take it. 

==Notes==
The reward is a one-use temporary [[Guardian pet]], likely the first one your character will have encountered.
