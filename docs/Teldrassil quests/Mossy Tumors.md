==Objectives ==
Retreive{{Sic}} 5 [[Mossy Tumor]]s.
* [[Mossy Tumor]] (5)

==Description==
There is a malevolence growing in the timberlings. We are trying to find the source, but until we do...in order to keep [[Teldrassil]] safe we must cut down the [[timberling]]s who are beyond help. Those that wander [[Wellspring Lake]] to the north are the most tainted. They must be removed!

Destroy the Timberlings you find there, and gather the mossy tumors growing upon them. Bring the tumors to me so that they may be burned.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pruning Knife
|Gnarled Gavel
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Have you been to Wellspring Lake, <name>?  Have you been hunting the timberlings there?

==Completion==
Well done!  These tumors are the symptom of the timberling's disease.  They are filled with a poison that we must cleanse from our new land.

I will dispose of these tumors.  Thank you, <name>.
