== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Fidelio]] to purchase a flight to [[Darnassus]], then bring the Dolanaar Recipe Book to [[Sister Aquinne]] in [[Darnassus]].
* [[Dolanaar Recipe Book]] (Provided)

== Description ==
Everyone in [[Dolanaar]] is so proud of Sister Aquinne. I'm certain she'll be pleased to receive this thoughtful gift from [[Nyoma]].

When you're ready to travel to Darnassus, just speak to me again and for a few coins, you can hire a [[hippogryph]] to take you there. I'm told Sister Aquinne enjoys the solitude of a small plaza just south of the hippogryph master in Darnassus. Look for her there after you arrive.

== Progress ==
How may I help you?

== Completion ==
Something for me? I wonder who sent it...
