== Objectives ==
Bring the Dolanaar Delivery to [[Innkeeper Keldamyr]].
*[[Dolanaar Delivery]] (Provided)

== Description ==
Greetings, young <class>. Can you offer me aid? I have a package of herbs that I must deliver to the town of [[Dolanaar]]. But I still have business with the druids of [[Shadowglen]] and cannot yet leave.

Can you deliver this package for me? It must be sent to Innkeeper Keldamyr, at the Dolanaar inn. It lies along the road, to the south.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Darnassian Bleu|q1=5
|Refreshing Spring Water|q2=5
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+25 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

== Progress ==
How might I be of service to you, young one?&nbsp; Are you here to [[rest]] in the inn?&nbsp; Do you require a [[:hearthstone]]?

== Completion ==
Ah yes, the delivery of herbs from Shadowglen.&nbsp; It is a shame [[Porthannius]] could not bring it himself, for we have much to discuss, he and I.&nbsp; But I am glad to get the herbs nonetheless, and I am glad you came.

While you are here, please, rest yourself.&nbsp; Heroes must keep their strength and spirits high, and must find rest and solace whenever they may.&nbsp; For to neglect one's peace of body and mind is a sure path to failure.

So... rest.
