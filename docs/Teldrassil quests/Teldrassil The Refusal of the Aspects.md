==Objectives==
Fill the Jade Phial.
*[[Filled Jade Phial]]
*[[Jade Phial]] (provided)

==Description==
Let me tell you more of the task you must complete. The [[druid]]s in [[Darnassus]] use the water of the [[moonwell]]s of [[Teldrassil]], and their moonwell must be replenished from time to time. Using these specially crafted phials, you can collect the water of the moonwells.

Take this vessel to the moonwell outside of [[Starbreeze Village]] to the east, and fill it with some of its waters, then return to me. Pay heed to the lessons of the moonwells, lest we find ourselves furthering our shortcomings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*540 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Hello again, <name>. Have you completed your task?

== Completion==
It is only natural that our race, once immortal and revered, would struggle with regarding ourselves in the humbled manner that we likely should. We must remember to embrace our connection with nature, and with [[Elune]], and push aside our mortal shortcomings.

==Notes==
;Approaching the moonwell

:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|The [[Fandral Staghelm|Arch Druid]] approached the dragons for their blessings, as the dragons had placed on [[Nordrassil]] in ancient times.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|But [[Nozdormu]], Lord of Time, refused to give his blessing, chiding the druid for his arrogance.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|In agreement, [[Alexstrasza]] also refused Staghelm, and without her blessing, Teldrassil's growth has been flawed and unpredictable.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|Staghelm retreated to his enclave in Darnassus, ever seeking a new direction by which to bless Teldrassil, and restore the immortality of our people.}}
