==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lord Melenas.jpg|Lord Melenas|None speak of the traitorous tale of Melenas, but his presence serves as a bitter, embarrassing reminder that trust must be earned, not given freely.}}
Retrieve the head of [[Lord Melenas]].
*[[Melenas' Head]]

==Description==
I must warn you, <name>, this matter must stay between us. The satyr are enough of an embarrassment to us already, and this one is much too close to home.

He is called Lord Melenas. He resides in the nearby cave of Fel Rock, to the north, where he has gathered a large group of grell warriors. His heart is black as night, and he plots something most foul.

You must find him within his nearby cave just to the north of here, and bring me his head.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:|Feral Bracers|Viny Wrappings|Swiftroot Boots|Feral Wristguards}}

==Progress==
Did you kill Lord Melenas yet? It is vital that he be taken care of quickly and quietly, <name>. His continued existence is an embarrassment to us all.

==Completion==
With Lord Melenas laid to rest I can finally move on to other matters. Thank you, <name>.
