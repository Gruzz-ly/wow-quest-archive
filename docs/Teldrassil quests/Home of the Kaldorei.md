==Objectives==
Bring the Filled Vessel to [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] in [[Darnassus]].
* [[Filled Vessel]] (provided)

==Description==
It has been an undeniable honor to have met you. You are a testament to the nobility of your race.

Go now and finish this final task. Take the waters to [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] in [[Darnassus]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|400}}
*880 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|540}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
How fare you, young one?

==Completion==
Ah, the blessed waters from our [[moonwell]]s. You have borne witness to the [[Shade of the Kaldorei|Spirit of the Kaldorei]], then?

In recent times, I've come to find that the spirit offers more questions than it does answers, but such is the continuing nature of discovery that drives us in our darkest hours.

I will offer you the simplest answers that I can. [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]] has returned to me... to us... but harsh times are yet upon us. [[Fandral Staghelm|Staghelm]] is gone and the world is wracked with pain - Malfurion has much to mend, and he will need help.

==Notes==
Run past the moonwell and statue in the [[Temple of the Moon]], then up the ramp. Tyrande is on an overlook on the upper level.

[[Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow]] stands not far from Tyrande, offering [[Breaking Waves of Change]]. Accepting it starts the [[Darkshore storyline]].
