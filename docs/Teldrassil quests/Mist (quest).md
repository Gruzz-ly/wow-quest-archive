==Objectives==
Escort [[Mist]] to [[Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak]] at the [[moon well]] near the [[Oracle Tree]].
*Lead Mist safely to Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak.

==Description==
The sabercat's fur is a distinctive gray color, blending into the surrounding forest. As she lays there, you observe that she is badly wounded, with deep lacerations across her back and stomach.

She raises her head and gazes at you, bright intelligence shining in blue eyes. She seems to wish to follow you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cord Bracers
|Cloudsbreak Gloves
|Crag Buckler
|Cloudsbreak Grips}}
You will also receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Progress==
Mist... It was my fault! The witches caught me off guard... I should not have let them take you...

==Completion==
Oh, thank you, <name>! I feared I would never see Mist again, knowing only her death in my heart, never to be united with my faithful companion. I owe you more than you can know, and you have my eternal gratitude.
