The Sleeping Druid is the 1st quest in the '''The Sleeping Druid''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Bring a Shaman Voodoo Charm to [[Oben Rageclaw]] in the [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]].
*[[Shaman Voodoo Charm]]

==Description==
The [[Gnarlpine]] [[shaman]] that inhabit this place have discovered a way of separating a sleeping druid's spirit from the physical body. The [[furbolg]] have animated my physical form and are using it to attack anyone that attempts to explore the [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]]. I am now trapped in the [[Emerald Dream]], powerless to stop this.

You must help me. The Gnarlpine shaman carry a strange charm which is used to perform this ritual, and I'd like to examine it. Please, <name>, bring one to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 700 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
If I can examine the charm, I may be able to figure out how to break the enchantment. Have you found one?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

What an odd trinket this is... I can sense the vile aura emanating from it; this is a very powerful enchantment.

==Progression==
{{A Troubling Breeze}}
