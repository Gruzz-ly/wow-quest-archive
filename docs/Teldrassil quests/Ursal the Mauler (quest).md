==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ursal the Mauler.jpg|Ursal the Mauler|Dreaded leader of the [[Gnarlpine tribe|Gnarlpine Furbolg]], Ursal seems to defy death itself in his pursuit of further corrupting Teldrassil.  If the wilds are to be healed, Ursal must die.}}
Kill Ursal the Mauler.
* [[Ursal the Mauler]] slain

==Description==
Now the time has come to save the [[Druids of the Talon]]. If we fail now, <name>, they will be forever lost in sleep.

I shall prepare the [[The Relics of Wakening|Relics of Wakening]] and perform the ritual. For my work to take effect, the cursed beast responsible for this horrible situation must be slain.

It was [[Ursal the Mauler]] who meddled with our brethren's calling and it is Ursal the Mauler who must now pay so they can be freed. Travel northwest on the road and find the path north into [[The Cleft]]. Ursal's den will be there.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Thornroot Vest
|Thornroot Cord
|Thornroot Hauberk
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Our brethren cannot be awakened until Ursal the Mauler has been slain, <name>.

==Completion==
<Name> you have proven yourself a most worthy and able <class>.  A <race> who follows the path of honor as sure as you do is certain to find great glory in this world.

Ursal's death brings safety to our once slumbering druids, but the source of his corruption yet remains within our forests. With time, I trust that you will find this evil and cleanse it for the sake of all of our people. You are destined for great things, young <class>.

==Notes==
While on the way to the Cleft, pick up [[The Road to Darnassus]] from [[Moon Priestess Amara]].

==Progression==
{{A Troubling Breeze}}
