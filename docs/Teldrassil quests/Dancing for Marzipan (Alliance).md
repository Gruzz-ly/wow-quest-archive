Completing this quest gains you an item required to complete [[Hallow's End Treats for Jesper!]]

==Objectives==
Do a dance emote at Innkeeper Saelienne, and in exchange you'll receive [[Darnassus]] Marzipan!
*Dance for [[Innkeeper Saelienne]]

==Description==
Even though you're trick-or-treating on behalf of a sick child, you still need to perform a trick for the treat!  We can't very well change the tradition, now can we...

I believe the cost of a piece of marzipan nowadays is to bust out and DANCE!  That's right, let me see your moves!  Dance for me, and I'll give you some tasty marzipan! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Darnassus Marzipan]]

==Progress==
You know how to dance, don't you?  Try by putting your right foot in... then your right foot out.. your right foot in... shake it all about...

==Completion==
You're quite the dancing machine, <name>!

Here's your treat for being such a good sport. &nbsp;Happy Hallow's End, and give my best to your sick little friend! &nbsp;I hope they get better soon. 

==Notes and trivia==
;When dancing
:{{text|say|Innkeeper Saelienne|I may have ninety-nine problems, but dancin' ain't one of them!  Happy Hallow's End, <name>!}}

The quote "ninety-nine problems" may be a reference to the song "99 Problems", released in 2004 by American rapper Jay-Z in 2004 on The Black Album.
