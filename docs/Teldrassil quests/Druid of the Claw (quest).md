'''Druid of the Claw''' is the 2nd quest in '''The Sleeping Druid''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Kill the soulless body of [[Oben Rageclaw]], and then use the [[Voodoo Charm]].
*Release Oben Rageclaw's spirit

==Description==
After examining this charm, <name>, I see now what must be done. Please take it, and do as I ask.

You are to approach [[Barrow Den Door|the door]] to the nearby chamber. Inside, you will find my soulless body... Although I regret what I am about to tell you, I see no other way to free myself from the control of the [[Gnarlpine]].

In order for me to escape them, you must kill my physical form. Once that is done, use the voodoo charm on my fallen body. After you have completed this task, please return to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sleeping Robes|Brushwood Blade}}

You will also receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Progress==
<Name>, be wary when approaching my physical form; the enchantment it is under is quite powerful.

==Completion==
I am finally free of the control of the Gnarlpine. Thank you, <name>.

My spirit may now rest peacefully forever in the [[Emerald Dream]].

Perhaps one day we may meet again, young <class>. But, for now, please accept this reward as a symbol of my gratitude.

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
