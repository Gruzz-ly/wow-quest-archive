==Objectives==
Report your success to [[Nazgrim]] at [[Domination Point]] in [[Krasarang Wilds]].

==Description==
The portal by my side will return you safely to Domination Point. I will return behind you; I must clean up our tracks a bit before we leave, so that [[Jaina Proudmoore|Proudmoore]] doesn't discover our involvement.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Completion==
You found the bell! And Fanlyr teleported it to Silvermoon for study, as instructed? The Horde will put this to good use.

You have done the Horde a great service today. Lok'tar, friend!
