'''Zenn's Bidding''' is an [[Alliance]] only quest in [[Teldrassil]], the [[night elf]] starting zone. In this quest, players are asked by the [[satyr]] [[Zenn Foulhoof]] to gather items from the animals of the forest.

==Objectives==
Retrieve 2 Nightsaber Fangs, 2 Strigid Owl Feathers and 2 swatches of Webwood Spider Silk.
*[[Nightsaber Fang]] (2)
*[[Strigid Owl Feather]] (2)
*[[Webwood Spider Silk]] (2)

==Description==
Eager for work, I see. Lucky for you a day never goes by that I don't wish I had a fledgling <class> to perform my bidding.

You see, <name>, I can make you very happy and provide you with things you never dreamed of having. But in order for that to happen you must bring me certain items.

My business in the forest often requires certain... reagents. Fetch for me nightsaber fangs, strigid owl feathers and swatches of webwood spider silk.

Let's keep this our little secret, <race>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||12|}}
*450 [[XP]]
*5x [[Severed Voodoo Claw]]
*[[Foul Bag]]

==Progress==
Have you been a busy little bee, <name>?  I've been waiting for you to bring me what I need.

==Completion==
Ha ha!  Well, done indeed.

Who would have ever guessed that I, [[Zenn Foulhoof]], would have a <race> to do my bidding?  Certainly not me!  But so it goes... this beloved world of ours is full of surprises.

Three cheers for the naive and gullible!

==Walkthrough==
===Obtaining this quest===
[[Zenn Foulhoof]] {{co|60.4|56.3|Teldrassil}} the [[satyr]] can be found along the road between [[Shadowglen]] and [[Dolanaar]], just north of the road. Speak with him to receive this quest.

===Completing this quest===
The [[Nightsaber]]s, [[Strigid Owl]]s, and [[Webwood Lurker]]s which drop the items can be found all around [[Dolanaar]], so this quest is a good one to do while traveling for other quests. The items also drop off of the higher level versions of these creatures, found further from [[Dolanaar]].

Once all the items have been collected, return to [[Zenn Foulhoof]] to turn in the quest.
