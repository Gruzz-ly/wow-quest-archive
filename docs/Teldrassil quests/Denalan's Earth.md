'''Denalan's Earth''' is an [[Alliance]] only quest in [[Teldrassil]], the [[night elf]] starting area. In this quest, players are sent by [[Syral Bladeleaf]] to bring a sample of rare earth to [[Denalan]], a herbalist researcher who lives on the shores of [[Lake Al'Ameth]].

== Objectives ==
Bring the package of Rare Earth to [[Denalan]] at [[Lake Al'Ameth]].
* [[Rare Earth]] (provided)

== Description ==
Are you heading to the south? To [[Lake Al'Ameth]]? If so, then I have a task I might ask of you...

My colleague [[Denalan]] has a camp along the eastern end of the lake, where he is studying and experimenting on the plant life of [[Teldrassil]]. He requested a package of rare earths from [[Darnassus]] and it was late, only recently arriving here in [[Dolanaar]].

Can you take the package to him?

== Reward ==
You will receive {{cost||1|50}}

==Progress==
You have something for me?

==Completion==
Ah, it's here! I have waited for this rare earth for quite some time. I hope it's still fresh...

Thank you for bringing it to me, <name>. You are a <race> who is generous with <his/her> time.
