== Objectives ==
Bring Sister Aquinne's Note to [[Leora]], the hippogryph master in [[Darnassus]].
* [[Sister Aquinne's Note]] (Provided)

== Description ==
This is wonderful! It's just the kind of thing I need to remind me of home while I continue my studies in the [[Temple of the Moon]]. I'll try out one of the recipes tonight. I can't wait!

Would you take this short note of thanks back to [[Nyoma]]? You can hire a hippogryph to take you back to [[Dolanaar]]. Just visit our hippogryph master, Leora, when you're ready to leave. She'll help you get a ride back to Dolanaar.

== Progress ==
Are you ready to return to Dolanaar?

== Completion ==
Do you need a ride back to Dolanaar?
