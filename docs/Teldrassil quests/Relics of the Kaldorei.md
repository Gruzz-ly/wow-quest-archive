==Description==
The [[kaldorei]] are an ancient people, and our lost relics can be found across [[Azeroth]]. Through these relics, the spirits can teach you ways to strengthen your connection to [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]].

The grellkin have stolen one such relic. Slay them and retrieve the relic, then follow its guidance to learn a new combat technique. Return to me when you have done this.

What has the relic taught you?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune you have learned to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

Seek out more of our lost relics along your travels.

==Notes==
Kill [[Grellkin]] until the [[Lunar Idol]] drops. Equip it and get six killing blows on mobs affected by [[Moonfire]], after which the idol can be used to learn the rune.
