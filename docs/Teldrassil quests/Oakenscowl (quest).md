==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Oakenscowl.jpg|Oakenscowl|Oakenscowl lingers as a dire reminder of how deep [[Teldrassil]]'s corruption can spread, turning a being of pure nature into something of nightmare.}}
Collect the Gargantuan Tumor from [[Oakenscowl]].
*[[Gargantuan Tumor]]

==Description==
I figured it out! I had to rush [[Wellspring Hovel|here]] to find you! It's so simple really... the corruption has spread from [[timberling]] to timberling, but there's but one that is the source.

Oakenscowl, he's being poisoned by the largest tumor I have ever seen... I would call it gargantuan, even.

Oakenscowl used to reside in a cave near [[Lake Al'Ameth|my lake]], but has since found his way to a nook to the northeast of here.  <Name>, Hunt{{Sic}} down Oakenscowl and collect the tumor; remove this source of corruption from my home.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dirtwood Belt|Moss-Covered Gauntlets}}

You will also receive {{cost||3|50}}.

==Progress==
Have you located Oakenscowl yet, <race>?

==Completion==
I knew you were more than capable of ridding the lake of that horrible beast.

It is a distressing situation; Oakenscowl was once a grand leader amongst his kind... but corruption does not discriminate between the lowly and the noble.

The size of this tumor is quite disturbing, but I must study it to learn more about the disease that upsets the [[timberling]] population.

Thank you, <name>.
