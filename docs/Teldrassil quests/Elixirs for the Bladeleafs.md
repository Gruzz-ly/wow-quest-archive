'''Elixirs for the Bladeleafs''' is an [[Alliance]] only [[alchemy]] quest in [[Teldrassil]], the [[night elf]] starting zone. In this quest, players are asked by [[Syral Bladeleaf]] the cook to create some potions for their shop. Note that you must have at least 20 alchemy skill level to receive this quest.

==Objectives==
Bring 6 Elixirs of Lion's Strength and 2 Elixirs of Minor Defense to [[Syral Bladeleaf]] in [[Dolanaar]].
*[[Elixir of Lion's Strength]] (6)
*[[Elixir of Minor Defense]] (2)

==Description==
Our herb and alchemy shop is booming, but my husband spends so much time mixing potions that we never have time for each other.

Can you help us?

If you can bring me a supply of pre-made elixirs, then I would be happy to trade with you. I have some rare herbs that you might find useful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*[[Earthroot]] (6)
*[[Mageroyal]] (6)

==Progress==
Hello, <name>. Do you have the elixirs to trade?

==Completion==
These are nicely mixed. You take great care in your trade, <name>, and that is important for an alchemist.

Here are your herbs, freshly gathered. May you use them well.

==Walkthrough==
===Obtaining this quest===
You must have the Primary profession [[alchemy]] at a skill level of at least 20 to obtain this quest. You can train it from another NPC in [[Dolanaar]], [[Cyndra Kindwhisper]]. Once you have the required skill level, talk to [[Syral Bladeleaf]] in front of the northern building in Dolanaar to receive this quest.

===Completing this quest===
The raw materials needed to make all the potions are:
*10 x [[Silverleaf]]
*6 x [[Earthroot]]
*8 x [[Crystal Vial]]

The herbs can be gathered from around Teldrassil, and the vials can be bought from the trade goods vendor on the second floor of the tower behind Syral. Once you have the potions, return to Syral and speak with her to complete the quest.
