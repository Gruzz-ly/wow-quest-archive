==Objectives==
Bring the Moss-Twined Heart to [[Denalan]] at [[Lake Al'Ameth]].
*[[Moss-Twined Heart]] (provided)

==Description==
The heart of [[Blackmoss the Fetid]] is covered with a dark, oily moss. In fact, the only way to tell this is a heart is from its slow, rhythmic beat... A beat that continues even now.

Perhaps Denalan will want to see this heart.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*460 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|70}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
<Name>! You have something for me?

==Completion==
...What is this? A [[timberling]] heart?? It's covered with a foul moss!

Thank you for bringing this to me, <name>. I will examine the heart and, if fortune shines, determine the nature of the moss about it.
