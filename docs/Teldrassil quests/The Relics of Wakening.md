== Objectives==
Retrieve the Relics of Wakening and bring them to [[Athridas Bearmantle]] in [[Dolanaar]].
*[[Raven Claw Talisman]]
*[[Black Feather Quill]]
*[[Sapphire of Sky]]
*[[Rune of Nesting]]

==Description==
[[File:The Relics of Wakening.jpg|thumb|In the [[TCG]].]]
[[Gnarlpine]] invaders were seen ravaging the [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]], tucked in the hill to the west.

The slumbering [[druid]]s will be trapped in the [[Emerald Dream]] for eternity, unaware of their fate, unless we help. The delicate hibernation ritual cannot be broken without the Relics of Wakening.

Journey to the Den and retrieve the Raven Claw Talisman, Black Feather Quill, Sapphire of Sky, and Rune of Nesting. The druids store them in sacred chests. Return them to me and I will prepare the awakening ritual.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gritroot Belt
|Barkplate Leggings
|Gritroot Cinch
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Dream Carrier]]
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
<Name>, the kidnapped [[Druids of the Talon]] will be forever trapped in the Emerald Dream if we cannot retrieve the Relics of Wakening from the Ban'ethil Barrow Den to the west.

For every minute we delay their fate comes one step closer to eternal doom.

==Completion==
You have succeeded, young <class>!  Well done.  And just in time I might add. 

==Notes==
You don't actually have to memorize the coordinates. Once you enter the Barrow Den, a [[Sentinel Huntress]] will join you as a companion. If you ask her for directions to any of the relics, she will summon a green mist highlighting your way through the tunnels. Make sure to also pick up [[Resident Danger]] in Dolanaar, and [[The Sleeping Druid]] inside the Barrow Den itself.

;Gossip lines and answers when asking for information

*Need some help finding your way? I know this place like the back of my hand.
*It saddens me to see the furbolg all corrupted so readily. These used to be our friends.
*This place is infested... we'll need to make our way out of here with the relics as quickly as possible.
*I haven't seen any of the sleeping druids. They must have been taken from here already.
*We should have seen this coming. The corruption has been spreading for quite some time.
*If the furbolg could be this far gone, what does that say for the rest of [[Teldrassil]]?
*There has to be a way to stop this corruption before it consumes us all.
*Damn you, [[Fandral]]! What have you gotten us into with this cursed "[[World Tree]]?"
