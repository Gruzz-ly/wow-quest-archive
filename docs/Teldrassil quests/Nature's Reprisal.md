==Objectives==
Use ireroot seeds to kill 12 grellkin in [[Fel Rock]].
*Fel Rock grellkin killed with Ireroot Seeds (12)
*[[Ireroot Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm glad you were willing to atone for your mistake - it speaks a great deal about your character.

I have another task for you. I have gathered some ireroot seeds. They are somewhat like fel cones, but quite a bit more potent. Nature often responds very negatively to demons, and these ireroot seeds prompt a very concentrated form of that reprisal.

To our north, in Fel Rock, there are grellkin that are far beyond redemption. Use the ireroot seeds to route them before they become a more serious threat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}} (or {{cost||3|90}} at level 90)
*630 [[XP]]
*+250 rep with [[Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Did you have any success in routing those grellkin for us?

==Completion==
Good. I know this probably wasn't very pleasant work, but we greatly appreciate it.

I fear for our dear Teldrassil... it seems it is becoming more corrupt by the day, and our ignorance to the cause is plaguing me greatly.

==Notes==
*The seeds will work on [[Shadow Sprite]]s, [[Rascal Sprite]]s, [[Vicious Grell]]s and [[Dark Sprite]]s in [[Fel Rock]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
