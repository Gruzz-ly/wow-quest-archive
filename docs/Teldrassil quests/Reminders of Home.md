== Objectives ==
Bring the Dolanaar Recipe Book to [[Fidelio]] in [[Dolanaar]].
* [[Dolanaar Recipe Book]] (Provided)

== Description ==
A friend of mine, [[Sister Aquinne]], is training to be a [[priestess of the moon]] in [[Darnassus]]. She left Dolanaar to study in the temple last year. Her letters say she is doing well and learning much, but she misses home and her old friends. I've put together a book of her favorite recipes from Dolanaar.

If you have time, would you take them to her in [[Darnassus]]? You can rent a [[hippogryph]] from Fidelio. He's in the center of town, just across from the inn.

== Progress ==
How can I help you?

== Completion ==
That's very thoughtful of Nyoma. For a few coins, I can arrange quick transportation to the capital by hippogryph.
