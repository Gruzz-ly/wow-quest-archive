==Objectives==
Defeat [[Githyiss the Vile]] in [[Shadowthread Cave]] and recover the lost rune. Learn the rune, then report back to [[Ayanna Everstride]] in [[Shadowglen]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Chimera Shot (hunter rune)]]

==Description==
A [[hunter]] draws strength from their connection and respect for all creatures, not just their pets. You will hunt and slay many beasts in service to the [[Alliance]], but even in battle you must respect your foe.

My previous apprentice used a mystical rune to augment her skills, but foolishly attempted to practice on the largest of the [[spider]]s in the cave to the north, a creature we have named Githyiss the Vile. Her disrespect led to her demise.

Slay Githyiss - but do not underestimate its strength.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*[[Cracked Leather Gloves]]

==Progress==
When you have slain Githyiss, recover the rune and learn its [[magic]].

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout [[Azeroth]]. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.
