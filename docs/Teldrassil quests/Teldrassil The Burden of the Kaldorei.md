==Objectives==
Fill the Amethyst Phial.
* [[Filled Amethyst Phial]]
* [[Amethyst Phial]] (provided)

==Description==
You must now visit the [[moonwell]] that rests under the boughs of the [[Oracle Tree]], far to the northwest. The first and most powerful of our wells, its waters are said to possess the very essence of [[Elune]]'s Powers{{sic}}.

Retrieve a phial of its water and return to me. I will meet you at the crossroads in front of Darnassus when your task is complete.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*780 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|480}} at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
To be in the presence of the Oracle Tree... it is almost to feel wisdom take form. 

==Completion==
Along with the [[druid]]s, the Oracle Tree has been carefully monitoring the growth of Teldrassil. Our observations have been disheartening, but all is not without hope.

The tree is indeed recovering since it's blessing, but the growth is still somehow stunted... hindered.

We suspect some portion of the corruption remains within the tree, waiting to be cleansed. We simply need to find it.

==Notes==
When in the Oracle Glade, pick up the two optional quests: [[The Enchanted Glade]] and [[Tears of the Moon]].

The moonwell is at {{coords|40|29|Teldrassil}}. As you approach it, the {{NPC||Shade of the Kaldorei}} will spawn to continue his story:
:{{text|emote|Shade of the Kaldorei approaches the moonwell slowly, a familiar, thoughtful look upon its face.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|Over time, Staghelm only grew more disconnected from our people.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|Some pose that he blames us, his people, for the loss of his son, long ago during the War of the Shifting Sands.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|Others cite rumors of his escalating conflicts with Tyrande Whisperwind, the shining light of our people, our leader in Darnassus.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|But many druids of the Cenarion Circle stand firm that he wants only what is best for all of the Kaldorei, and serve him unerringly towards that end.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of the Kaldorei|Fandral Staghelm carries the burden of our sins and our follies, and in so doing deserves the respect of us all.}}
:{{text|emote|The Shade of the Kaldorei closes its eyes and fades away.}}
