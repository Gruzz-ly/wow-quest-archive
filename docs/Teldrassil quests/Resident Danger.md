==Objectives==
Kill 20 [[Gnarlpine]] Furbolg in and around [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]].
* Ban'ethil Gnarlpine slain (20)

==Description==
The Gnarlpine aggression is limiting our options. None of our kind are eager to bring blade and arrow against creatures that were once our friends, but I grow fearful that they are going to set their sights on [[Dolanaar]] soon.

The biggest concern to me are the furbolg in [[Ban'ethil Hollow]] and [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]]s. I need you to travel to the west, make your way into the Barrow Den, and kill as many of the Gnarlpine as you can. We probably won't have many more chances to limit their strength - be swift.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*790 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Are their numbers weakened?

==Completion==
Impressive. I hope my huntress carried her weight.

If we continue with this fervor, we may yet still free Teldrassil from the corruption that Alexstrasza herself could not burn out.

==Notes==
:{{text|say|Sentinel Kyra Starsong|Some of our [[Sentinel Huntress|huntresses]] have already made their way to Ban'ethil Barrow Den.  They will find you when you get inside.  Go ahead and speak to [[Citarre Mapleheart|Citarre]] to secure a ride there.}}
