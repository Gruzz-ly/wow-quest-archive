# Teldrassil storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Teldrassil.jpg|thumb|Zone map.]]

'''[[Teldrassil]]''' is a level 1-10 [[Alliance]] zone, the starting zone for [[night elf|night elves]]. It begins with the [[night elf starting experience]] in [[Shadowglen]], then proceeds to [[Dolanaar]]. The main plot involves investigating the corruption affecting the creatures of Teldrassil &mdash; a remnant of the curse that fell upon the colossal tree after when the [[Aspects]] refused to bless it &mdash; and traveling between the different [[moonwell]]s to gather samples of water needed to reveal and destroy the corruption's source. Throughout the plot, the hero sees multiple visions explaining the major developments in night elf society since the [[Battle of Mount Hyjal]].

==Dolanaar==
On the way to Dolanaar, [[Zenn Foulhoof]] asks players to find him some regeants from the forest, which results in players being disciplined by the Night Elves of Dolanaar. To atone for their actions, players trick Zenn into consuming Fel Cones.

{{Zenn's Bidding}}

In Dolanaar itself, there are several parallel quest chains available.

After turning in [[Teldrassil: Passing Awareness]], [[Corithras Moonrage]] offers [[Teldrassil: The Refusal of the Aspects]]. This chain will not be continued for a while.

[[Nyoma]] starts a quest chain to familiarize the player with [[flight path]]s:

{{Reminders of Home}}

[[Tallonkai Swiftroot]] starts a quest chain sending players to Starbreeze Village to recover his lost dreamcatcher:

#[[The Emerald Dreamcatcher (quest)]]
#[[Ferocitas the Dream Eater (quest)]]

[[Syral Bladeleaf]] asks aspiring alchemists to provide potions to stock the shop.
* [[Elixirs for the Bladeleafs]]

[[Athridas Bearmantle]] starts the main quest chain of Dolanaar, which has players combating to the corruption that is afflicting Darnassus. To begin with, players defend the hibernating Druids of the Talon as they are attacked by [[Furbolg]] of the Gnarlpine tribe that were corrupted along with Teldrassil. Players are then sent to Denalan to investigate the corrupted vegetation of the tree starting with [[Denalan's Earth]].

{{A Troubling Breeze}}

===Finale: The Vengeance of Elune===
To unlock the final quest chain, complete all of:
* [[Timberling Seeds]] and [[Timberling Sprouts]] (chain starts at [[A Troubling Breeze]])
* [[Teldrassil: The Refusal of the Aspects]]

After that, a new quest chain opens from [[Corithras Moonrage]] as players fight the source of all the corruption on Teldrassil - the [[Bough of Corruption]]. Defeating it cleanses the corruption from Teldrassil once and for all.

{{Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei}}

In the Temple of the Moon, [[Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow]] offers [[Breaking Waves of Change]], which leads players to [[Darkshore]].

==Storyline==
===Chapter 1: Shadowglen===
{{Previous story|the night elves and Teldrassil|[[Stormrage]]}}
The night elf hero began their quest in [[Shadowglen]]. The instructor [[Ilthalaine]] introduced himself and impressed upon the hero the importance of balance in nature. The spring rains led to an overpopulation of nightsabers in the surrounding area and Ilthalaine politely asked the hero to cull them a bit. Upon returning, the hero overheard Ilthalaine telling [[Huntress Sandrya Moonfall]] and [[Dentaria Silverglade]] that there were no new recruits ready yet. Without giving more details, Sandrya warned him that they were running out of time—a battle was fast approaching the roots of Teldrassil. Dentaria left Ilthalaine to his work and turned to the hero, telling them that their help in battle would be needed soon.<ref>[[The Balance of Nature]]</ref> Ilthalaine then sent the hero to collect fel moss from [[grell]]kin nearby, concerned that there is still lingering corruption within Teldrassil. The hero's return with the fel moss confirmed Ilthalaine's fears—there was still corruption within Teldrassil.<ref>[[Fel Moss Corruption]]</ref> Ilthalaine concluded that the hero was now ready to join the fight and sent them to their class trainer for further instruction.

After learning a few new abilities, the hero's trainer directed them to assist Dentaria Silverglade to the north of [[Aldrassil]]. Dentaria was pleased to see the new hero had progressed so quickly through their training and was ready to get to work.<ref>[[Priestess of the Moon (quest)]]</ref>
Dentaria asked the hero to gather rare flowers to help her cure their friend [[Iverron]] from the venom of the webwood spiders.<ref>[[Iverron's Antidote]]</ref> While Iverron recuperated, Dentaria asked the hero to make contact with the dryad [[Tarindrella]] north of Aldrassil to investigate the spider threat.<ref>[[The Woodland Protector]]</ref> Tarindrella confirmed that the spiders still suffered from corruption—and further, were more susceptible to it than other wildlife on Teldrassil. She and the hero slew a great many of them<ref>[[Webwood Corruption]]</ref> and in doing this they discovered that the corruption was not the result of mind control or some other effect—it was due to the corruption of their broodmother [[Githyiss the Vile]]. Upon killing Githyiss, they discovered a furbolg totem—the [[Gnarlpine]] had installed a totem to corrupt the broodmother and her offspring that they would attack the nearby night elf settlements.<ref>[[Vile Touch]]</ref> Tarindrella brought the hero back to Dentaria to complete their training and departed to further investigate the source of the Gnarlpine corruption.<ref>[[Signs of Things to Come]]</ref>

Dentaria sent the hero on a final mission to complete their training—learning some of the recent events in night elves' history. A ritual at the nearby moonwell helped the hero recall the recent events confronting their people—the [[Battle of Mount Hyjal]] in which the Burning Legion was defeated but night elves lost their immortality, the release of [[Illidan Stormrage]] from his prison and the disappearance of [[Malfurion Stormrage]] to the [[Emerald Dream]].<ref>[[Teldrassil: Crown of Azeroth]]</ref> The ritual complete, Dentaria sent the hero to [[Tenaron Stormgrip]] with a vial of the waters of the moonwell—evidence that their training was completed. Tenaron agreed it was time for the hero to move on from basic training and begin addressing the issues of their people.<ref>[[Precious Waters]]</ref> Tenaron sent the hero on to [[Corithras Moonrage]] in [[Dolanaar]].<ref>[[Teldrassil: Passing Awareness]]</ref>

===Chapter 2: Council of the Forest===
On the way to Dolanaar, the hero met the [[satyr]] [[Zenn Foulhoof]] who promised them "things you never dreamed of having" in return to a variety of "reagents" culled from the corpses of forest dwellers. When the hero returned with the items, Zenn revealed that they had been tricked and thanked the hero for being so gullible.<ref>[[Zenn's Bidding]]</ref>

Upon arriving in Dolanaar, the hero was admonished by [[Sentinel Kyra Starsong]], [[Syral Bladeleaf]] and [[Sentinel Shayla Nightbreeze]] who told them that their actions aiding Foulhoof had offended the [[Council of the Forest]] and demanded that the hero acquire some corrupted seeds to play a trick on Foulhoof to be redeemed. The hero collected the seeds and Zenn gobbled them up without hesitation. The ruse worked, and within moments Zenn was turned into a frog.<ref>[[Seek Redemption!]]</ref>

The success of the trick redeemed the hero in the eyes of the Council, which then asked the hero to attack [[Fel Rock]] which had been taken over by a small army of corrupted grellkin. Syral Bladeleaf asked the hero to purge the army while [[Tallonkai Swiftroot]] had a more specific target in mind—the satyr [[Lord Melenas]] who had marshalled them together. When the hero returned with Melenas' head the Council's agents thanked them and returned to their normal duties.<ref>[[Nature's Reprisal]]</ref><ref>[[Twisted Hatred]]</ref>

===Sidestory: Reminders of Home===
While in Dolanaar, a cooking supplies vendor [[Nyoma]] asked the hero to bring a recipe book to her friend [[Sister Aquinne]], who is studying to become a [[Priestess of the Moon]] in [[Darnassus]]. Nyoma told the hero the easiest route to the capital would be to fly by [[hippogryph]] which they could arrange via the local [[flight master]] [[Fidelio]].<ref>[[Reminders of Home]]</ref> Fidelio told the hero that everyone in Dolanaar is so proud of Aquinne's devotion to [[Elune]] and gives the hero a suggestion of where they might find her in the city before sending the hero on their way.<ref>[[To Darnassus]]</ref> When the hero delivered the book Aquinne was ecstatic and promised to use it that very evening. Aquinne wrote a thank-you note and asked the hero to deliver it back to Nyoma.<ref>[[An Unexpected Gift]]</ref> [[Leora]], the flight master in Darnassus, explained to the hero the importance of meeting the flight master whenever they reach a new place so that they might arrange easy travel back there in the future. The hero then delivered the letter to Nyoma, who thanked the hero and lamented she hasn't had the opportunity yet to visit Aquinne in person yet.<ref>[[Return to Nyoma]]</ref>

===Chapter 3: Starbreeze Village===
[[File:Gnarlpine Hold.jpg|thumb|[[Gnarlpine Hold]].]]
[[Athridas Bearmantle]] in Dolanaar informed the hero of a troubling development. The warden of the nearby [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]]--[[Gaerolas Talvethren]]—has not reported to him recently. Athridas asked the hero to investigate.<ref>[[A Troubling Breeze]]</ref> Before the hero departed, Tallonkai asked the hero for another favor. He explained that he used to live in Starbreeze and when he left because of the increasing Gnarlpine activity, he left behind a good-luck charm, an emerald dreamcatcher which he had received from Gaerolas. The hero agreed to retrieve the amulet.<ref>[[The Emerald Dreamcatcher (quest)]]</ref>

The hero arrived in Starbreeze to find the village ransacked by the Gnarlpine. Gaerolas was found mortally wounded by the furbolgs and pleaded with the hero to notify Athridas before the furbolgs could reach the barrow den as he would be unable to make it back. He identified their leader: [[Ursal the Mauler]]. The hero returned to Dolanaar after retrieving the Tallonkai's amulet and delivered the disturbing news to Athridas.<ref>[[Gnarlpine Corruption]]</ref>

When the hero presented the amulet to him, Tallonkai noticed immediately it was missing its emerald. He surmises that the Gnarlpine mystic [[Ferocitas the Dream Eater]] must have it, and asks the hero to slay the furbolg to retrieve the gem on their next trip to Starbreeze. The hero agreed and returned with the gem.<ref>[[Ferocitas the Dream Eater (quest)]]</ref>

Athridas warned the hero that the druids sleeping in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den would be forever trapped in the Emerald Dream if their physical bodies were to be killed while they are asleep. The hero set out to retrieve the tools necessary to peacefully break wake them so that they could flee safely.<ref>[[The Relics of Wakening]]</ref> While collecting the items from the Barrow Den, the hero was attacked by the body of [[Oben Rageclaw]], which the Gnarlpine had found a way to animate and use to attack intruders.<ref>[[The Sleeping Druid]]</ref> The hero assisted Oben's spirit in determining how the Gnarlpine had done this and ultimately at Oben's request the hero slew his physical body.<ref>[[Druid of the Claw (quest)]]</ref>

When the hero returned to Athridas with the items, Athridas sent them to kill Ursal, the last remaining obstacle to saving the druids. With Ursal dead, Athridas was able to complete the ritual and the druids escaped safely.<ref>[[Ursal the Mauler (quest)]]</ref>

===Chapter 4: Lake Al'Ameth===
Syral Bladeleaf notified the hero that package had arrived for [[Denalan]], an herbalist with a camp near [[Lake Al'Ameth]] to the south and asked them to deliver it.<ref>[[Denalan's Earth]]</ref> Denalan thanked the hero for the package and asked for the hero's help investigating why the [[timberling]]s were becoming so violent when the healing of the world tree should have pacified them. The champion set out to collect timberling seeds and sprouts for Denalan's experiment to find the cause.<ref>[[Timberling Seeds]]</ref><ref>[[Timberling Sprouts]]</ref>

Denalan asked the hero to bring one of the specimens to his colleague [[Rellian Greenspyre]] to help the druid with his own efforts to purge the timberlings' corruption. Rellian thanked the hero for the seed but lamented that it was likely beyond his skill.<ref>[[Rellian Greenspyre (quest)]]</ref> The timberlings near [[Wellspring Lake]] to the north were the most corrupted in particular, and Rellian sent the hero to slay them and collect their mossy tumors so that they may be burned.<ref>[[Mossy Tumors]]</ref> Denalan suddenly arrived with important news: he had discovered that the corruption stemmed from [[Oakenscowl]], a large timberling who had the largest tumor of all. The hero slew Oakenscowl and returned the gargantuan tumor to Denalan and Rellian for study.<ref>[[Oakenscowl (quest)]]</ref>

===Chapter 5: The Vengeance of Elune===
Corithas Moonrage, after observing the hero's growing power and understanding, instructed the hero to visit the moonwell under the [[Oracle Tree]] for another vision. At the moonwell, the hero learned of Archdruid [[Fandral Staghelm]], the leader of the [[Cenarion Circle]] and the most powerful druid in Azeroth after Malfurion and the reverence he is due in spite of his conflicts with [[Tyrande Whisperwind]].<ref>[[Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei]]</ref> After viewing this, Corithas sent the hero to a final moonwell to rendevous with Tarindrella for another attack against the corruption of Teldrassil. On approaching the moonwell, the hero saw a final vision about the most recent events—Archdruid Staghelm and his closest followers have left the Night Elf society without a word, but Malfurion has awoken from the Emerald Dream and reunited with Tyrande. [[Alexstrasza]] and [[Ysera]] have finally provided their blessings to Teldrassil, allowing the tree to begin to grow properly. Hope for a better future dawns anew for the Kaldorei.<ref>[[Teldrassil: The Coming Dawn]]</ref>

After the vision, Tarindrella informed the hero that she has located the source of the corruption near the tree's edge. She provided the hero with a blessing using the collected power of the moonwells that allowed the hero to destroy the [[Bough of Corruption]].<ref>[[The Vengeance of Elune]]</ref> With the source of the corruption destroyed, Tarindrella sent the hero to return it to Corithas, who in turn directed the hero to bring it to Tyrande. Tyrande explained that the disappearance of Staghelm is worrisome but Malfurion's return has given her hope in spite of the dark days ahead.<ref>[[Home of the Kaldorei]]</ref>
