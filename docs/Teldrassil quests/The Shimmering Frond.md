== Objectives ==
Bring a Shimmering Frond to [[Denalan]] at [[Lake Al'Ameth]]
*[[Shimmering Frond]] (provided)

== Description ==
The fronds on this plant shimmer in the forest light, giving it a twisting, pulsing aura.

You believe that [[Denalan]] would want a specimen of this.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

== Progress ==
You have something for me?

== Completion ==
Where did you get this? I haven't seen a plant like this since a sojourn I made to the [[Swamp of Sorrows]]... decades ago! It's amazing that a specimen made its way to [[Teldrassil]]. And it's grown to such a size!

Thank you, <name>. Forgive my shortness of words, but there is a test I would like to perform on this frond... 

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|emote|Denalan hurries to his planter.}}
:{{text|say|Denalan|I hope this frond takes root...}}

Three [[Sprouted Frond]]s appear in the planter. Interacting with any of them will offer the quest [[The Sprouted Fronds]].

This quest can technically be turned in to Denalan at [[Wellspring Hovel]] in the west, but doing so is unintended. The fronds will not appear and, as a result, the followup quest will not be available. It will only work correctly if turned in to Denalan at [[Lake Al'Ameth]].
