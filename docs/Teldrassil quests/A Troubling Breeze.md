'''A Troubling Breeze''' is an [[Alliance]] only quest in [[Teldrassil]], the [[night elf]] starting zone. In this quest, players are sent by [[Athridas Bearmantle]] to [[Starbreeze Village]] for a report from [[Gaerolas Talvethren]]

== Objectives ==
Seek out [[Gaerolas Talvethren]] in [[Starbreeze Village]].

== Description ==
A troubling breeze blows through the forest.

Gaerolas Talvethren serves as Great Warden to the hibernating [[Druids of the Talon]] in the [[Ban'ethil Barrow Den]]. His duty as the chosen protector of the Sleeping is to ensure their safety so that their pact with [[Ysera]] remains fulfilled.

But word from Gaerolas is now delayed and I grow nervous. Travel east to Starbreeze Village and bring back a report from Gaerolas so that I can put my worries to rest, knowing my dreaming brethren slumber safely.

==Completion==
Thank the forest spirits you are here! I knew Athridas would sense trouble and send help.
