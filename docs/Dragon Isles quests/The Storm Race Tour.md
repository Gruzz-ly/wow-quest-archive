==Description==
This storm gryphon is intriguing! Whatever land gave rise to such a creature merits further exploration.

But since you are here, let us test its training--and your riding skills.

My colleagues in the [[Bronze dragonflight|bronze flight]] have laid out new courses to put the mount through its paces. When a timekeeper sees you upon your gryphon, they will offer you the chance to fly these "storm races".

Fortune favors the bold, <name>. Good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18}}
*[[Ensemble: Thundering Stormrider's Attire]]
