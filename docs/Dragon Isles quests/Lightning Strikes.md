==Objectives==
Meet the [[Lord Andestrasz]] at the [[Skytop Observatory]].

==Description==
<[[Herald Flaps|Flaps]] does a spin and deposits a drool-soaked note into your hand.>

Ah, <name>. I am told you have acquired a fine new mount. A [[gryphon]] that soars upon the very storm itself!

I would very much like to see how this wondrous creature flies. I will await you at Skytop Observatory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|2|25}}

==Completion==
Hello again, <name>. Now, let us see about this gryphon!

==Notes==
The quest can be turned in to [[Lord Andestrasz]] at each of his locations of the four main [[Dragon Isles]] zones, not just the Skytop Observatory in the [[Waking Shores]].
