:{{Text|say|Toddy Whiskers|The expedition boat shouldn't be long now.}}
:{{Text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Make a friend or two while ye wait fer it.}}

Keep an eye on [[Chrovo]], the Dragon Isles Dock Master, who has a progress bar over his head showing the time left until the ship arrives.

:{{Text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Ah, the Rugged Dragonscale. All aboard for adventure, my friends!}}
:{{Text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Corkscrews! The boat ruined my perfect shot! I almost had it...}}
:{{Text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|You'll get lots of pictures in the Dragon Isles, Wulferd. Imagine all the ancient wonders we'll be discovering!}}
:{{Text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|I still say we could've crammed into my mole machine and gotten there faster.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|We dracthyr would rather fly home than ride a wooden vessel as it drifts upon the waves. But I pledged to accompany your expedition, so... waves it is.}}
:{{Text|say|Alanatheth|Surely one of your airships would be faster than plodding along in this boat?}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Ironbridge|You really want to fly an airship into a sky full of dragons, ensign? Besides, our tidesages are puttin' in work.}}
:{{Text|say|Alanatheth|I suppose that is an understandable fear for a flightless creature.}}

Aboard the ship, use the "Volunteer for Lookout" [[Extra Action Button]] to get teleported up to the crow's nest for a better lookout of the arrival.
