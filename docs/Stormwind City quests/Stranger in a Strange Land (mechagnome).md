Welcome to Stormwind, <class>. King [[Anduin Wrynn]] invites you to explore our fair city. Say, you look like someone who enjoys the night life. We have many popular taverns and a vibrant music scene!

Ah, but that can wait, a [[Chronormu|bronze dragon]] has asked to talk to you. She is sitting under the nearby tree, on an hourglass of all things!

After that, an emissary of the [[Mechagon mechagnome|Mechagnomes]] is waiting to welcome you to the city. Sounds like a busy day for you!

Have a pleasant stay, <name>!

You will receive:
* {{cost||1|25}}

Stay shiny out there, friend.
