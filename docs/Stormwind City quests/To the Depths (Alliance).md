==Objectives==
Report to [[Recruiter Burns]] at [[Stormwind Harbor]] in [[Stormwind City]].

==Description==
The [[Earthen Ring]] has identified the watery realm of [[Vashj'ir]] as a source of the adversary's destructive energies.

It is still uncertain what dangers might be faced there, so any information you could gather would be of great value.

The Alliance is sending warships to the region as we speak. To gain passage, travel northwest of Stormwind and speak to Recruiter Burns at Stormwind Harbor.

May the spirits guide you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,200 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
All of our war ships are fighting off the Horde. You'll have to take the mercenary ship.

==Notes==
Burns can be found standing by the northernmost dock of Stormwind Harbor.

You cannot accept that quest if you already have [[Hero's Call: Vashj'ir!]] in your quest log! <BR> 
There is also another (unknown) pre-requisite other than completing [[The Eye of the Storm (Alliance)]].

==Progression==
