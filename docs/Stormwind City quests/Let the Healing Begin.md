==Description==
Do you think you'd be able to step into this city without me noticing? No! I was right about your kind before and I'll be damned before I let [[dragon]]s destroy my home again. This once was a park filled with joy and peace. Then your progenitor, [[Deathwing]], came. Oh yes, I know all about him. See for yourself the legacy of destruction that was left behind. The pain that walks these streets still.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I see. There is much healing to be done still. Thank you for opening my eyes to this truth.

==Completion==
You have given me the most wonderful gift today. You have shown me that my city is ready to heal. That our legacies are still in our control.

Go forth with honor, friend.

==Notes==
Refugees include [[Theridran]], [[Sylista]], [[Telonis]], and [[Shailiea]].

;On approach
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|This way, dracthyr. Do not think I did not notice you.}}

;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|This park was once a place a of peace and reflection.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|Everything changed when Deathwing attacked. Now it is a place of mourning.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|You will not find a shortage of wounded and angry people here.}}

;Speaking to Knight-Captain Sanine
I had come to [[Lion's Rest]] to honor those I fought alongside in the [[Fourth War]].

However, my scars are not as healed as I had thought. They seem to have awoken as I've entered and I fear I haven't the strength to carry on.

;Healing her with Living Flame
:{{Text|Say|Knight-Captain Sanine|Thank you, <name>.}}
:{{Text|Say|Knight-Captain Sanine|That warmth...}}
:{{Text|Say|Knight-Captain Sanine|It has rekindled my heart. I must carry on.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|Humans were not the only ones to feel the pain.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|The night elves of Darnassus know loss like no other.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|And not all wounds can be cleansed in flame.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|This, too, was once their home.}}

;Speaking to Theridran
:Healing from our scars is a journey each of us must make individually at our own pace.

:However, we will be needing a lot of help from our friends in this process.

;Speaking to Sylista
:The [[burning of Teldrassil]] has left us with many scars.

:<The night elf coughs profusely.>

:Only some of which may be healed.

;Speaking to Telonis
:I still have dreams of the fires...

:I hope to never see such devastation again.

;Speaking to Shailiea
:After the fires, [[Stormwind]]'s citizens took us in.

:They are a good people.

:May you find the same solace we have found.

:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|I see. Your healing is quite unique.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|Perhaps I was mistaken. Perhaps the people of my city will accept you after all.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|Given time, all wounds are able to be healed.}}
''Ottan walks ups the stairs to the south.''

Follow him to confront a mob of Angry Citizens.

:{{Text|Say|Angry Citizen|I won't forget what Deathwing did to this city.}}
:{{Text|Say|Angry Citizen|Not in my Alliance!}}
:{{Text|Say|Angry Citizen|We will never accept you!}}
:{{Text|Say|Angry Citizen|Dragons in my Stormwind? I think not.}}
:{{Text|say|Knight-Captain Sanine|Enough! <Name> healed me when no one else could. They are here to help.}}

''The Angry Citizen and the Stormwind Citizen will repeat the following:'' 

*{{Text|Say|I need healing!}}
*{{Text|Say|Ahh, my back hurts! Heal me!}}
*{{Text|Say|Please heal me next!}}

;Speak to Sanine again
:The Alliance I serve is proud to call you an ally. A friend.

''As they are healed the crowd disperses.''

;Speak to Otan again
:Neltharion's legacy is not your own, it seems. I am glad to have been mistaken.

:{{Gossip|How do you know so much about Deathwing?}}

::It brings me great remorse to have been one of the [[Doomsayer (Alliance)|doomsayers]] of Stormwind during the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]]. I was so consumed by my ability to see the oncoming storm that I did not stop to realize that I was a part of it.

::I cannot undo the damage that was done;however, my sins may be atoneable still.

::Today you have shown me hope.

::{{Gossip|I understand.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|Thank you, <name>.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|My city is finally ready to heal.}}
:{{Text|Say|Otan Tennoh|Mayhaps I am also ready to be free of these scars.}}
