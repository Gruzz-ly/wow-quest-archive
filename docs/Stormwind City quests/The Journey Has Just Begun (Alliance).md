==Completion==
A dragon slayer and a seasoned leatherworker? You do not cease to astonish, hero. I am humbled.

Please accept what I am about to teach you. This knowledge will prove to be invaluable if you are to destroy what remains of the Black Dragonflight.

Create the cloak from the scales of the brood mother. It will protect you and your allies against the incendiary breath of the Lord of Blackrock... Nefarian. 

==Notes==
This quest is only available to leatherworkers who have completed [[Victory for the Alliance]] or [[A Most Puzzling Circumstance (Alliance)]]. It teaches the recipe for the [[Onyxia Scale Cloak]].
