==Objectives==
Meet with the [[Illidari]] representative in the [[Mage Quarter]] of [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].

==Description==
At first I was unsure whether it was wise to allow the [[Illidari]] inside the city. But they may have just saved all our lives.

I gave the [[demon hunter]]s leave to establish a temporary camp in the [[Mage Quarter]]. I'd like you to be my personal envoy to them. Thank the Illidari for their assistance and see how they can aid our cause.

Just... keep your eyes open. They have harnessed a terrible power, and we must be ready should they be consumed by the darkness within.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|30}}
*7,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see by the blood spatters that [[Jace Darkweaver|Jace]] revealed the demons to you. I trust the [[Anduin Wrynn|young king]] is safe.

We have more work ahead of us, <class>. Much more.

==Notes==
The Illidari area is just to the north of the [[Slaughtered Lamb]] in the Mage District.
