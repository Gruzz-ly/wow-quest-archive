Take the Bloodied Sentinel's Glaive to [[Kayla Mills]] in [[Stormwind City]].
*[[Bloodied Sentinel's Glaive]] (provided)

==Description==
The glaive rests inches from [[Captain Delaryn Summermoon|the sentinel's]] outstretched fingertips. Her eyes stare, sightless, at the ashen husk of [[Teldrassil]] on the horizon.

Perhaps someone in Stormwind can tell you what happened here.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|21|94|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Can I help you?

==Completion==
Aye, I recognize that look. You have seen Teldrassil, or what is left of it. Have a seat, <name>.

==Notes==
This quest became available after the War of Thorns quest chain was removed from the game at ''[[World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth|Battle for Azeroth]]'' release.

The [[Warbringers: Sylvanas]] cinematic plays after turning in the quest.
