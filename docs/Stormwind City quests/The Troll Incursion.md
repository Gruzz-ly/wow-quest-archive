Speak with Commander Sharp in Stormwind Harbor.

==Description==
A group of trolls, claiming to represent the Darkspear tribe, have arrived at Stormwind Harbor.  Our guards are keeping them at bay, for now.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Why don't these trolls just deal with their problems on their own?
