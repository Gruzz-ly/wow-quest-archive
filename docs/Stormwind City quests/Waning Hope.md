==Objectives==
View [[Tyrande]]'s audience with [[Anduin Wrynn]].
* Speak to [[Prophet Velen]]

==Description==
The [[kaldorei]] have been steadfast members of the [[Alliance]] since the end of the [[Third War]]. We have fought on distant shores and even on different worlds without protest.

It is curious that in our moment of need, their resources are stretched too thin to lend so much as a single blade.

Wrynn has already denied Tyrande aid. Witness it for yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This will not stand.

==Completion==
Nothing a human king says will deter Tyrande now, but he still has the chance to act.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|[[Velen]], please share what happened with <name>.}}

Talk to Velen.
*It is good to see you again, <name>. Your aid on [[Argus]] has not been forgotten. (To players who have done the Argus storyline.)
*Good tidings, <name>. (To players who didn't quest through Argus.)
:{{Gossip|Please show me what happened.}}

A cutscene plays.

:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I wish things were different, High Priestess. But with the war raging in both [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]] and [[Zandalar]], an assault on [[Darkshore]] would stretch us too thin.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|[[Night elf|My people]] need action, not excuses! We will not languish in [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] while the [[Horde]] defiles our lands!}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I vow we will recover [[Teldrassil]] before the war is over. But we face dwindling resources and rising casualties. If I can ask for your patience for a while longer--}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|No. We will reclaim our home now.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Tyrande...}}
:''Tyrande turns away from the table.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|We shall have vengeance for the slain, and show [[Sylvanas]] that she has not won! And if the [[Alliance]] will not aid us...we shall do so alone.}}
:''Tyrande leaves.''

The cutscene ends.

:{{Text|say|[[Sira Moonwarden]]|Tyrande left for Darkshore ahead of our army. She intends to wrest it from the Horde herself.}}
: ''Anduin sighs.''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I see.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|<Name>, our forces in [[Zuldazar]] have not yet begun their assault. With your aid, we may be able to succeed on both fronts.}}
