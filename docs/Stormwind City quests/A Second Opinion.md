==Objectives==
Find the [[warlock]] [[Slaughtered Lamb|sanctum]] within [[Stormwind]] and seek advice on the orb.
*[[Althalaxx Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm not sure what to make of this orb, <name>. I think we will need the help of... a specialist.

We are aware of a warlock sect operating out of Stormwind. Officially we reject the presence of warlocks in the city. Unofficially, their knowledge can be of use when dealing with [[demon]]ic forces.

Find a representative of these warlocks, and seek their opinion on the orb.

==Progress==
You're a long way from [[Cathedral of Light|the cathedral]], paladin. I hope you realize you have no authority here.

==Completion==
So the [[Knights of the Silver Hand|Silver Hand]] requires my aid? It will not come cheaply.

==Progression==
{{A Strange Artifact}}
