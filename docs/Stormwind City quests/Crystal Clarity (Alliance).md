==Objectives==
Collect 1 Pristine Crystal Shard from the [[Crystal Spine Matriarch]] on [[Yojamba Isle]] in [[Stranglethorn Vale]].
* [[Pristine Crystal Shard]]

==Description==
Hi again! Oh, I forgot to tell you! I've devised a foolproof way to improve your S.E.L.F.I.E. cam! 

In fact, with just the right gemstones, I can make a lens that would allow us to do all sorts of things!

Some fellow explorers have told me about a large basilisk out on Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale. Her hide is dotted with tons of high-quality crystals! What a perfect coincidence!

She sounds pretty tough, though! You should bring some friends!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|77|60}}
*10,640 [[XP]]
*[[S.E.L.F.I.E. Lens Upgrade Kit]]

==Progress==
Hey, stay out of my shot! Oh, it's you! Did you take down that basilisk yet?

==Completion==
I knew from the moment we met that you were an adventurer, just like me! Here's your lens upgrade kit, now get out there and take some S.E.L.F.I.E.S!
