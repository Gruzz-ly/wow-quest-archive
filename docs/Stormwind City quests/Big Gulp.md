==Objectives==
Fish up a [[Royal Monkfish]] from the moat in the [[Valley of Heroes]] district of Stormwind. Once you catch a monkfish, fillet it and check if it swallowed the locket. 
* [[Precious Locket]]

==Description==
Arnold and I used to relax down at the moat in the Valley of Heroes. One day, I lost my locket in the lake and I have never been able to find it. Rumor has it that huge royal monkfish live in that moat and that they eat anything! I know its a long shot, but do you think you could catch a few monkfish and look for my locket?

Please let me know right away if you find it, it's very precious to me. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{coppercost|74000}} (or {{coppercost|132300}} on lvl 85)
* +1 [[Fishing]]
* [[Bag of Shiny Things]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find my locket? 

==Completion==
You found it!  I can't believe it was down there all those years!  You have no idea how much this means to me <name>. 

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Stormwind]].
