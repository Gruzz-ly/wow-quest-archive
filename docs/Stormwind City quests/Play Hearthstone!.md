==Objectives==
Play 5 Hearthstone cards at a [[:Hearthstone Game Table]], or Wild Cards NEAR a Hearthstone Game Table.
*Cards Played (5)
*[[Hearthstone Starter Pack]] (provided)

==Description==
It's time to play [[Hearthstone (game)|Hearthstone]]! 

Here's a starter pack -- open it up and add those cards to you collection. Then, if you can find a seat at the game table, then sit down with someone else and play!

Or if you can't find a seat, then you'll want some Wild cards.... I didn't tell you this but there's a shady card dealer lurking around here somewhere.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||5}}
*30 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Like the game so far? Give it a chance and play those cards!

==Completion==
How did you do? Had some good, clean fun I'm sure!

==Notes==
Interact with a free [[Game Stool]], which puts the player to a vehicle with the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Play Common Card|id=430923|Play a Common Card from your collection. Mana charges may vary!|icon=inv_misc_hearthstonecard_common}}
#{{Abilities|Play Rare Card|id=430968|Play a Rare Card from your collection. Mana charges may vary!|icon=inv_misc_hearthstonecard_rare}}
#{{Abilities|Play Epic Card|id=430969|Play an Epic Card from your collection. Mana charges may vary!|icon=inv_misc_hearthstonecard_epic}}
#{{Abilities|Play Legendary Card|id=430970|Play a Legendary Card from your collection. Mana charges may vary!|icon=inv_misc_hearthstonecard_legendary}}

Wait for the other player. The goal of the match is to defeat the enemy, bringing them from 30 to 0 health, like the real game. The quest requires playing a card five times.

;Win

;Lose

The second option to complete the quest is to buy [[Hearthstone Wild Card]] from a [[Shady Dealer (gnome)|Shady Dealer]] near the event area and use the cards near the table.
