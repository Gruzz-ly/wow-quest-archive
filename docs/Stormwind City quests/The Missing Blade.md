==Objectives==
Inform [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]] about the absence of [[Xal'atath]].
* [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire (quest item)]]

==Description==
<The echo of the blade Xal'atath lingers before you. Though the consciousness that resided within the dagger is gone, the place it once occupied still resonates with power.

You sense the weapon now speaks another voice. Another purpose....

You feel compelled to warn the king that the blade may now reside in the hands of the enemy.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
<You tell Anduin about Xal'atath and [[N'Zoth]]. His expression darkens.>

This is grim news, champion.

The [[Alliance]] stands on the threshold of victory. If the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]] has learned of a new weapon, she will use it to keep the war going indefinitely. 

==Notes==
Before leaving after having killed [[Uu'nat]], pick up this quest and travel to [[Stormwind City]] to turn it in. 

On complete:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|When Sylvanas Windrunner became [[warchief]], I knew we would not be friends... but I didn't want us to be enemies. Then came the [[Gathering|massacre]] in [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]]... and the [[War of the Thorns|burning of Teldrassil]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It's clear she does not fight for [[Azeroth]]. She doesn't even fight for the [[Horde]]. She wages war upon life itself.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We are so close to ending this conflict and forging a lasting peace. But if Sylvanas uncovers some new weapon that allows her to keep fighting...}}
: ''His tone darkens and his commitment to action solidifies.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|No. We must discover what she's after... and stop whatever madness she seeks to unleash upon us.}}
