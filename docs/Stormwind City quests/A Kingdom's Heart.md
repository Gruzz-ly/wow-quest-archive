==Objectives==
Accompany [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]] on his walk through [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].
*Speak with Anduin
*Escort Anduin to [[Lion's Rest]]
*Return to [[Stormwind Keep]]
*Anduin's advisors heard

==Description==
[[Varian Wrynn|My father]] was a legend. He oversaw the rebuilding of Stormwind, stood toe-to-toe with [[dragon]]s, led the [[Alliance]] to numerous victories.

Then, one day, he was just... gone.

I wear his crown, I hold his title. But I've done nothing to earn them... or the faith of my people.

I've spent the war sequestered in the keep, surrounded by guards and advisors. I need to walk the streets of Stormwind, to know whether it is hope or fear that beats in the hearts of my people.

I welcome your company.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Gilded Prayer Beads]]

==Completion==
They're right. They're absolutely right.

==Notes==
;Anduin
The time for prayer is over. I must know the hearts and mind of my people.

''{{gossip|I will accompany you to Lion's Rest.}}''

:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'll need a disguise to move through the city without attracting attention.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I think I know just the spell. Follow me.}}
: ''Anduin's spell causes his clothes to change.  Although the cut is basically the same, the materials are now drab brown cloth and leathers, with a hood that hangs low over his eyes.''

;Passing the guards
:{{text|say|[[Royal Guard (human)|Royal Guard]]|No luck, eh? [[Genn Greymane|King Greymane]] won't be happy, but I'm sure you did your best.}}

;Exiting cathedral
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Stormwind has always been my home. I know its shops and streets as I would do the back of my hand.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Yet even as I walk these familiar steps, I have never felt more lost.}}

;Listening to Jenny and Roy
:{{text|say|[[Jenny Winslow]]|They brought back my cousin's body from the [[Broken Shore]] last week. I expect a lot more to follow.}}
:{{text|say|[[Roy Pitts]]|At least we're safe here in Stormwind.  King Wrynn will keep the city safe.}}
:{{text|say|Jenny Winslow|Will he? How exactly will he keep an endless army of demons from invading and killing everyone?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|They're right to be afraid.  If we fail to stop the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] on the Broken Shore, the demons will strike us here, at our home and hearth.}}

;Listening to Dougie and Karyn
:{{text|say|[[Dougie]]|I'm King Anduin! I'm gonna kill every demon I see!}}
:{{text|say|[[Karyn]]|Don't be Anduin, be Varian! He was way tougher.}}
:{{text|say|Dougie|Yeah, my dad says that too. Okay, I'm King Varian. look out, demons!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I can't blame the lad for his choice. My father sacrificed everything to save his people. He was a great king.}}

;Walking to Lion's Rest
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I have not returned to [[Lion's Rest]] since my father's memorial was moved here from the keep.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The war has consumed all of my energy and attention. I have not had a moment to grieve.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Since you brought [[Varian's compass|my father's compass]] back to me, I've prayed to the [[Light]] for guidance, and to know his spirit is at rest. The Light doesn't answer.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|My people like me, respect me... but they don't believe in me. Not like they believed in him.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I've heard the voice of the people, but how do my father's advisors feel? I fear they do not trust me as they did my father.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I must know. Follow me to the keep.}}
:''Anduin mounts and flies off to the keep.''

;Outside the war room
: ''Anduin is hidden by the left side of the entrance, peaking into the room.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It seems Genn and [[Velen]] are speaking about me, but I can't quite make out the words...}}

;Anduin's advisors heard
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The young king will become a great leader. [[Prophet's Lesson|I have foreseen it]].}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Visions don't win wars, Prophet. The boy has a good heart, but he's untested.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The Light is strong with Anduin. He will grow into his crown. We must have faith.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|We need more than that, and so does he. Anduin wasn't there on the Broken Shore. He hasn't seen the sacrifice his soldiers made... that they continue to make.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|A king must know the weight of the orders he gives--the price of them. If a compass breaks his spirit, how will he respond when the war ''arrives on our doorstep''?}}
