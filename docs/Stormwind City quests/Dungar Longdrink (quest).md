==Objectives==
Bring Osric's Crate to [[Dungar Longdrink]] the gryphon master.
*[[Osric's Crate]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, I gathered into this crate everything Argus asked for. Can you take it to him?

If you've already spoken to Bartlett at Goldshire, then you can take a gryphon back to him. Dungar Longdrink is our gryphon master, over in the trade district.

Speak with Dungar, then get this crate to Argus as fast as you can. We don't want our fighting men and women in Goldshire to go without fresh equipment!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*160 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Stormwind}}

==Progress==
Is that sweat on your brow, lad?  You've been running too much.  Next time, take a gryphon!

==Completion==
A crate for Goldshire, eh?  People sure are getting lazy. Have you been to Goldshire before?  If so, then it's no problem, my friend.  I have plenty of gryphons trained to fly that route!
