During the [[Tempest Unleashed]] event, this quest was available at level 10. Low-level characters on this quest were given {{Abilities|Summon Dragon Flight|id=397925|icon=ability_mount_drake_bronze}}, an [[Extra Action Button]] spell that summoned a Bronze Drake to ride.

;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Toddy Whiskers|Spotted some promisin' crew members as I was flyin' over the city. Round 'em up and let's get to it!}}
:''Toddy mounts up on her gryphon, [[Wildfeather]], and flies off toward [[Stormwind Harbor]].''

;Artisans
[[Thaelin Darkanvil]] can be found in the blacksmithing area of the [[Dwarven District]]. He and two [[Dracthyr Smith]]s are gathered around a forge. One dracthyr holds a jewelry box that contains a large red gem in a gold setting. He appears to be talking about it, while Thaelin and the other dracthyr work at the forge.

Speak to Thaelin:
{{dialogue|This craftsmanship is somethin' else. Ye can learn a lot by studyin' the work of others.

Just the thought of what lies ahead gets me excited!

{{gossip|We need artisans for an expedition to the Dragon Isles. Will you join us?}}}}

:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|New adventures? I'm game. When there's work tae be done, my hammer's always ready tae be put tae good use! See ye at the docks!}}
:''The three leave toward the harbor.''

;Explorers
[[Pathfinder Jeb]] can be found with two [[Mechagon mechagnome|mechagnome]] [[Expedition Trainee]]s near the lion statue overlooking the harbor. One of the trainees is dangling by his hands from a ledge. Pathfinder Jeb is kneeling next to him, a coil of rope in hand.

As you approach:
:{{text|say|[[Expedition Trainee]] A|Cogs and sprockets!}}
:{{text|say|Expedition Trainee B|I have miscalculated.}}
:{{text|say|[[Pathfinder Jeb]]|Don't panic. We've prepared for this.}}

Speak to Jeb:
{{dialogue|Help ya with something?

I'm sorta busy showing these trainees the finer points of scaling walls.

{{gossip|We need explorers for an expedition to the Dragon Isles. Will you join us?}}}}

:''Jeb stands, and the dangling trainee hops up onto solid ground.''
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|Expedition to the Dragon Isles? Sounds fun! Bet they've got plenty of soaring peaks to climb. Wrap it up, trainees! We're moving out!}}
:''The trainees turn to each other.''
:{{text|say|Expedition Trainee A|Exemplary work!}}
:{{text|say|Expedition Trainee B|Announcing appreciation.}}
:{{text|say|Expedition Trainee A|Your gratitude has been accepted.}}
:''The three run off toward the harbor.''

;Scholars
[[Cataloger Wulferd]] stands in front of [[Weller's Arsenal]] in the [[Trade District]]. A group of [[Cataloguing Enthusiast]]s and an [[Intrigued Dracthyr]] are gathered around him.

As you approach:
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Breathing room, please! My admirers need space to appreciate the awe of being in my presence.}}

Speak to Wulferd:
{{dialogue|No quill? No ink?

<The gnome shakes his head.>

How do you expect me to sign an autograph if you don't come prepared?

{{gossip|We needs scholars for an expedition to the Dragon Isles. Will you join us?}}}}

:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|A-hem. Duty calls! Now if you'll excuse me, I must be off to make a name for myself in the splendiferous Dragon Isles!}}
:''Wulferd runs off, leaving the crowd behind.''

;At the docks the expedition has gathered
:''Wildfeather rears up and screeches.''
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Easy now, Wildfeather. Yer gonna need that energy soon enough!}}

Pathfinder Jeb can again be seen instructing the trainee from earlier, now hanging from the docks, and has new gossip:
{{dialogue|
Everyone needs a little nudge now and again. They'll get it eventually.

Wouldn't want to help 'em too much. The struggle is good for 'em!

:{{Text|Yell|[[Expedition Trainee]]|Please! Someone! My arms are getting tired and I swear I saw a fin, or what looked like a fin, swimming in the water beneath me.}}
}}

Cataloger Wulfeed has new gossip as well:
{{dialogue|So many wondrous creatures! Fish! Birds! Oh, look up there! In the sky! It's a... 

YUCK! Not again! Why do they always do that right when I look up?

Dampen a cloth in that beautiful ocean water, would you?}}

;On completion
:''A mage portal suddenly appears, and [[Archmage Khadgar]] jumps out of it.''
:{{Text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Sorcery! We're under attack!}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Be at ease, Toddy. This is a friend, not a foe.}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Apologies for my abrupt arrival. But the news I bring cannot wait for pleasantries.}}
