==Objectives==
Bring twenty-four Robo-Mechanical Guts to Shoni in [[Stormwind]]. 
*[[Robo-Mechanical Guts]] (24)

==Description==
It's terrible, <name>.  We are not going to have enough parts to get our fleet of gyrodrillmatic excavationators to [[Dun Morogh]].

What we need are spare parts, <name>.  What better place to get the spare parts for our vehicles than Gnomeregan? I hear that bots and mechs roam around that place like cattle on an open range.

What I need you to do is go to [[Gnomeregan]] and tear apart those robots.  Bring me back their robot guts.  Two dozen should be sufficient. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Shoni's Dismantling Tool|Shilly Mittens}}

You will also receive:
*3150 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles]]
*+100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
If this were a race, you would have lost by now. 

==Completion==
This will do nicely, <name>.  One gyrodrillmatic excavationator fixed; 398 left to go. 

==Notes==
*[[Robo-Mechanical Guts]] drop from most instance mobs (including non-mechanical ones); they also drop from the mobs in Gnomeregan ''outside'' the instance.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.1|note=Added.}}
