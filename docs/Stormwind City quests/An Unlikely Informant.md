==Objectives==
Meet [[Mathias Shaw]] in the basement of the [[Lion's Pride Inn]].
*Shaw met in the Lion's Pride Inn basement

==Description==
This is a top secret mission, <name>.

We've had a break in.

A powerful historical artifact was stolen from [[Stormwind Keep|the Keep]]... and it looks like the [[Defias Brotherhood]] is to blame. We caught [[Defias Thief (Stormwind City)|one thief]], but the other got away.

But I don't like it, <name>... my gut tells me there's more.

I've called in a... specialist on the Brotherhood. Meet us in the basement of the Lion's Pride Inn in [[Goldshire]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|85}}
* 1,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must recover what was stolen from the Keep, at all costs.

==Completion==
My few interactions with [[Vanessa VanCleef|Vanessa]] told me she isn't interested in the [[bandit]]ry of the old Defias Brotherhood. To her, the Brotherhood meant supporting the downtrodden... those that [[Stormwind]] had left behind.

That, I can respect.

But most of her Brotherhood continue to engage in [[Thief|thievery]] from innocent travelers. That's not revolution, that's highway robbery.

She insists she tries to stop them.

==Notes==
;On accept
:''Mathias moves to inspect the dead thief.''
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|This was a very bold move by the Defias Brotherhood, especially since they have been relatively quiet since the [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|last attack]] of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|The artifact they stole... I shudder to think what they intend with it. We must move quickly, <name>!}}
:''Mathias turns away, mounts a [[gryphon]] and flies away.''

Meet Shaw in the basement of Lion's Pride Inn:
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Over here, <name>. Let me know when you're ready to speak to our informant.}}
:Keep your wits about you.

:{{Gossip|<Tell Shaw to signal his informant.>}}
::{{Text|Emote|Shaw flashes a silver insignia in the dark.}}
::{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|I apologize if this is a bit of a surprise to you. To most, she was last known to have fallen in the [[Deadmines]]...}}
::{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|But I'm not quite so easy to kill! Wonderful to meet you, so-called-hero!}}
Or if you have defeated Vanessa in the Deadmines she says the following line:
::{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|But I'm not quite so easy to kill! Wonderful to see you again, so-called-hero!}}
::''Vanessa appears from the shadow and uses [[Cheap Shot]] on the [[adventurer]].''
::{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Vanessa...}}
::{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|I'm just having some fun, of course.}}
::{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|During the Legion's last invasion, Vanessa was a member of a... [[Uncrowned|secretive order]] that aided in the defense of [[Azeroth|our world]]. Since then, the Defias have been quiet.}}
::{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|So then, Vanessa, why did your Defias steal the [[:Drakefire Amulet]] from [[Stormwind Keep]]?}}
::{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|The what? If you're going to pin something on me, you have to do better than stringing some random words together.}}

;Talk to Vanessa
:Stay out of my way, "hero".

[[Rogue]]s who have obtained the [[Uncrowned Insignia]] instead get another option when speaking with Shaw:
:{{Gossip|<Flash your Uncrowned Insignia.>}}
::{{Text|Emote|Shaw nods.}}
::{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|I think you will understand why we needed this meeting in secret, [[Shadowblade (title)|Shadowblade]].}}
::{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|Because it's so wonderful to see you again, boss!}}
::''Vanessa appears from the shadow and uses [[Cheap Shot]] on the [[adventurer]].''
::{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Vanessa...}}
::{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|I'm just having some fun, of course.}}
::{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Since the Legion, it seemed to me that Vanessa has been more focused on the Uncrowned than the Defias, and the Defias have been quiet.}}
::{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|So then, Vanessa, why did your Defias steal the Drakefire Amulet from Stormwind Keep?}}
::{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|The what? If you're going to pin something on me, you have to do better than stringing some random words together.}}
