;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Vanessa VanCleef]]|[[Count Clessington|Your father]] died... right in front of you. Because of us.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Cecilia Clessington]]|Yes. But he chose to walk a path of evil. His death was his own doing. And I have no desire to carry on his legacy.}}
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|A father's legacy...}}
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|Maybe I too should find my own path. Not... [[Edwin VanCleef|my father]]'s.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|[[SI:7]] could always use a capable agent such as yourself.}}
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|Ha! In your dreams, Shaw.}}
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|In the past, I got caught up in the desire for vengeance, but I always wanted to help the people of [[Westfall]]. Perhaps it's time [[Hope Saldean]] passed out bowls of soup again.}}
:{{Text|say|Cecilia Clessington|If you don't mind, I think I would like to join you for that.}}

Head to the Valley of Heroes where [[Stormwind City Guard (NPC)|Stormwind City Guards]] and [[Stormwind City Commoner]]s are gathered and cheering.
:{{Text|say|Stormwind City Commoner|There walks a hero.}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind City Commoner|Make way!}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind City Commoner|A living legend...}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind City Commoner|A moment I shall remember for always.}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind City Commoner|...nerves of thorium.}}

Speak with Shaw.
:With your help, we've stopped Clessington from bringing chaos and violence into Stormwind.

:Go, hero. Approach General Hammond Clay and accept the greatest honor Stormwind can bestow.

:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{Gossip|<Tell Shaw that [[Ragged John]] wanted a memorial for [[Reginald Windsor|Windsor]].>}}
::Did he, now? 

::Well, he's right. Against all odds, Marshal Reginald Windsor helped us stop [[Onyxia]] once again, this time from beyond the grave.

::I will see to it that we place something on his grave to honor him.

::Too often, we fail to recognize the deeds of our heroes until they are gone. We want to change that with you, <name>.

::{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}

:{{Text|yell|General Hammond Clay|People of Stormwind! Bear witness today to the deeds of <name>, who has stood valiantly against the many foes that would threaten our fair city.}}

Approach Hammond and use the Honor of the Lionguard extra action button.
:{{Text|yell|General Hammond Clay|For their courage, we honor <name> as Lionguard, defender of Stormwind and all her people. Rise and Light bless you, Lion of Stormwind!}}

Upon completion, you may go to the [[Stormwind City Cemetery]] and find Windsor's new grave at {{Co|42.11|33.93|Stormwind City}}.
:In honor of Reginald Windsor, who gave his life in defense of Stormwind

You can also follow up with Vanessa and Cecilia in [[Saldean's Farm]] in Westfall, which is now updated with the [[Breadbasket Guild]].
