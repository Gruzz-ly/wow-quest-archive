==Objectives==
Take the Head of Rend Blackhand to [[General Marcus Jonathan]] in [[Stormwind]].
* [[Head of Rend Blackhand]] (provided)

==Description==
The deed is done. [[Dal'rend Blackhand]], [[Warchief]] of the [[Dark Horde]], lies dead at your feet. Take his head and present it to the General.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Might of Stormwind]] is applied to the player and all other players present in [[Stormwind City]].

==Progress==
By the [[Light]]!

==Completion==
Well done, champion.  The Warchief of the Dark Horde is dead, ending an era of terror in our lands. Let all of Stormwind know of your victory!

==Notes==
*This quest may be repeated once a week to re-trigger the world buff, though will not offer repeated rewards.
*It was originally added to {{expac|Classic}} realms in addition to {{g|sod}} in order to address the imbalance with the Horde-only [[Warchief's Blessing]] world buff. It was removed a week later due to a negative community response, and player concern over whether Classic Era would or should receive further such changes in the future.
