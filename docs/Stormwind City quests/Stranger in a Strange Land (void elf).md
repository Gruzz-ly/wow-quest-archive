==Objectives==
Talk to [[Chronormu|Chromie]] in [[Stormwind City]].
*Chromie found

==Description==
Welcome to Stormwind, void elf. I invite you to explore our fair city. Say, you look like someone who enjoys the night life. We have many popular taverns and a vibrant music scene! 

Ah, but that can wait, a [[Chronormu|bronze dragon]] has asked to talk to you. She is sitting under the nearby tree, on an hourglass of all things!

After that, an [[Ambassador|emissary]] of the [[ren'dorei]] is waiting to welcome you to the city. Sounds like a busy day for you!

Have a pleasant stay, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2}}
*180 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So, how does Stormwind suit you?

==Completion==
Welcome to Stormwind. Though it is no [[Silvermoon]], the city does have its charms.

If you came here expecting a warm welcome, I cannot say I have received one myself. But most folk are polite enough.

No matter. I am off to seek adventure! And perhaps a stiff drink.

==Notes==
;Completion
:{{text|say|Keira Onyxraven|I have only heard stories of Stormwind before now. I will explore its streets and the wonders it holds. May the shadows guide you, <name>.}}
