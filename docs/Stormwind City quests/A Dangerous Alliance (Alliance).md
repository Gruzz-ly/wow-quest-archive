==Objectives==
Kill 6 Fireguard Destroyers and recover the General's Attack Plans from [[General Angerforge]] at the [[West Garrison]] in [[Blackrock Depths]].
*[[Fireguard Destroyer]] slain (6)
*[[General's Attack Plans]]

==Description==
[[SI:7]]'s latest report about [[Twilight's Hammer]] and [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] activity worries me, <name>. There's evidence that they are preparing a joint attack from within [[Blackrock Mountain]]. We'll be hard-pressed to turn back such a combined force, but if we act before they're ready to strike, we might be able to blunt the attack.

You must go into Blackrock Depths and capture the Twilight's Hammer attack plans from General Angerforge in the West Garrison. Do not hesitate to take out the [[elemental]]s supporting his forces.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Faceguard of the Crown
|Headguard of the Crown
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
We cannot afford to allow the Dark Iron dwarves to ally with Twilight's Hammer.

==Completion==
I'll send these plans to [[Varian Wrynn|the king]] and his strategists immediately. If the Dark Irons and their Twilight allies manage to recover and attack, our men will be ready for them. Well done, <name>.

==Progression==
