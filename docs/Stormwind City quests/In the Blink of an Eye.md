==Objectives==
Witness the teleportation of Dalaran to the [[Broken Isles]].
*Talk to the [[Kirin Tor Emissary]] to teleport you to Dalaran (Optional)
* Dalaran's Teleportation Witnessed

==Description==
<The [[Khadgar's Upgraded Servant|entity]] speaks with the familiar voice of [[Archmage Khadgar]].>

Azeroth needs you, <name>!

After scouring [[Ulduar]] and [[Karazhan]] for answers, we know the key to defeating Legion: five ancient artifacts called the [[Pillars of Creation]].

To find them, [[Dalaran]] must be moved to the [[Broken Isles]]. As [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] is... absent, [[Kalecgos]] of the [[blue dragonflight]] has offered the [[Kirin Tor]] his aid.

The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] is assaulting our current position over [[Deadwind Pass]]. Hurry!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|65|}}
*3,700 [[XP]]
*[[Dalaran Hearthstone]]
*5x [[Tome of the Tranquil Mind#BoP]]

==Completion==
Ah, <name>, it's good to see you on your feet! The members of the [[Council of Six]] are recuperating from their ordeal.

The intensity of the teleportation spell can be disorienting. It seems you lost consciousness for a time, but at least you didn't awaken to find yourself stuck in a wall!

Dalaran has been relocated to the Broken Isles. From here, we will spearhead the effort to acquire the Pillars of Creation and drive the Legion from [[Azeroth]] once and for all!

==Notes==
At level 98 in ''Legion'', you will receive the quest [[Legion: The Legion Returns]] automatically, from which you can go through to reach this quest, or take the option to skip ahead directly to this quest.

;Quest accept
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Dalaran is under siege, <name>! The Legion intends to knock us out of the sky!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Meet in Dalaran over Deadwind Pass. I have a plan. A horribly dangerous plan... but a plan nonetheless!}}

;Speaking with the Kirin Tor Emissary
:{{Gossip|The Kirin Tor requires my aid. Send me to Dalaran!}}
:The player is teleported to Dalaran.

;Khadgar
:The Legion bears down on us, we have but moments to spare.

:The shockwave of [[arcane]] energies we are about to unleash should prove powerful enough to send them back to their [[Twisting Nether|cursed dimension]] for a time, giving us time to catch our breath and begin the search for the Pillars of Creation.

:Are you ready?

::{{gossip|I am ready, begin the teleportation of Dalaran to the Broken Isles.}}

;Cutscene
:''An overview of the city of Dalaran is shown, surrounded by Legion warp ships which are firing balls of fel energy from their cannons.''
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|Citizens of Azeroth.}}
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|Today is the day we turn the tide.}}
:''The view changes to the Chamber, where the Council of Six are channeling their powers. Khadgar continues to speak as the camera pans around to show each council member.''
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|Today is the day that we re-take our world.}}
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|And send the Legion back to the hell that spawned them.}}
:''With the spell complete, the view shifts back outside. A massive orb of arcane energy expands from Dalaran, engulfing the Legion ships and destroying them, then Dalaran teleports away and manifests itself in the city's new location...''
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|Our path is clear.}}
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|The Pillars of Creation await.}}
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|On the Broken Isles!}}

;Quest completion
:{{text|say|[[Emissary Auldbridge]]|The resources of Dalaran are at your disposal. From here, heroes of [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] alike will search for the Pillars of Creation!}}
:{{text|say|Emissary Auldbridge|I've heard rumors of powerful artifacts that may be of use in your campaign. Keep an eye out and a useful lead just might present itself!}}
:{{text|say|Emissary Auldbridge|Now I must attend to other visitors. Good luck, <name>!}}
:''Emissary Auldbridge leaves, walking past the [[Magus Commerce Exchange]] and up the stairs into the [[Violet Citadel]], despawning inside.''

There will be no follow-up quest offered immediately. Walk around Dalaran for a bit, and eventually a representative from your [[Class Order]] will show up and offer a quest to start establishing your [[Class Hall]] and acquiring your first [[artifact]].

* Death Knight: [[The Call to War (quest)]]
* Demon Hunter: [[Call of the Illidari]]
* Druid: [[A Summons From Moonglade]]
* Hunter: [[Needs of the Hunters]]
* Mage: [[Felstorm's Plea]]
* Monk: [[Before the Storm (quest)]]
* Paladin: [[An Urgent Gathering]]
* Priest: [[Priestly Matters]]
* Rogue: [[Call of The Uncrowned]]
* Shaman: [[A Ring Unbroken]]
* Warlock: [[The Sixth]]
* Warrior: [[An Important Mission]] / [[A Desperate Plea (Legion)]]

Evokers receive [[Aiding Khadgar]] immediately upon entering Dalaran.

===Gossips===
;[[Valerie Langrom]]
:Push them back! We cannot let Dalaran fall.
;[[Rafael Langrom]]
:Hold them back We cannot lose the city.
;[[Bragund Brightlink]]
:Don't just stand there. <name>! These demons won't be killin' themselves.
;[[Kerta the Bold]]
:Do the best you can, <name>. We'll see how long we can hold  these demon back.
;[[Didi the Wrench]]
:These things just keep on comin'!.
;[[Josie Birch]]
:Greetings, <name>. Are you feeling well? Quite a few others have reported bouts of nausea and dizziness.
:{{text|say|Josie Birch|It's never ending! They just keep coming!}}
:{{Text|say|Anqelique Butler|We've got to hold out bit longer.}}
;[[Windle Sparkshine]]
:I knew it! I could feel it!
:Clear out the city, <name> We have to hold them off!

==Trivia==
Originally, [[Khadgar's Upgraded Servant]] would appear near you with this quest on login, wherever you were in the world. (Should the elemental despawn before you accepted the quest, moving to a different subzone would make the questgiver quickly reappear.)  About two weeks after launch it was changed, likely because the large servant would follow you around closely and get in the way if you didn't want to take the quest immediately.
