==Objectives==
Speak with [[Evelyn Thorn]] at the [[Training Hall]] in [[Stormwind]].

==Description==
It seems that the elders in our ranks have taken notice of your progress and dedication, <name>. Evelyn Thorn, one of the oldest and most respected members of our circle, has sent word that she wishes to speak with you. You should not take such an invitation lightly. Most only speak with her in the course of their lessons, but if she has asked to see you personally, it must be an important matter.

Hurry back to Stormwind and look for her at the Training Hall to the south of the [[Old Town]] district.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 150 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
I see that my message managed to reach you. Good. We have much to discuss.
