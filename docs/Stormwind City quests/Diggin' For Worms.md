==Objectives==
Find an [[Overgrown Earthworm]] near [[Olivia's Pond]] and use it as bait to catch a Crystal Bass.  Crystal Bass can be found in Olivia's Pond, north of [[Stormwind]].
* [[Crystal Bass]]

==Description==
Hey there, Angler!  Arnold here tells me that you have been looking for a new fishing spot and I think I know just the place.  North of Stormwind there is a great little spot called Olivia's Pond.

The pond is stocked with crystal bass every year but they are hard to catch.  They only bite on a very specific type of bait... overgrown earthworms.  If you search the shore around the pond, you should find plenty of worms to use as bait.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (+{{coppercost|0}} at max level)
+2 [[Fishing]]
{{Itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
Did the bait work? 

==Completion==
Those look like some nice bass, <name>.  Let's fry em' up and see how they taste! 

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Stormwind]].

To find a worm, look for sparkling patches of ground.  Click on the worm to buff yourself then start fishing.
