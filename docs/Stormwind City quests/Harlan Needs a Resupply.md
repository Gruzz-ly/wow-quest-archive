==Objectives==
Go to the Canal Tailor Shop and bring [[Rema Schneider]] the Cloth Request from [[Harlan Bagley]]. 

*[[Cloth Request]] (Provided)

==Description==
We've been doing a lot of business lately. It seems like everyone is buying armor and sturdy clothes. Almost like they expect a cold, harsh season ahead...

But those are future worries. My worry today is that I'm running out of knitted clothing to sell. I need another load from our supplier.

If you can take this request to Rema Schneider at the Canal Tailor and Fit Shop, I'd be most grateful. 

==Reward==
You will receive: {{cost|||17}}

==Progress==
You bring word from Mr. Bagley? 

==Completion==
It says here that Harlan's business is booming. That's good news, but I wonder why people have need of all that armor. I've heard nothing of open war...is there something the nobles aren't telling us?

Well, thank you for bringing the request. Here's your payment, and I'll see to it that Harlan gets his supplies. 

==Notes==
On completion:
:''Rema's husband, [[Corbett Schneider]], spawns.''

:{{text|say|Corbett Schneider|Hullo, Trias clan!  A ball of your smoked mozzarella, if you please!}}
:{{text|say|[[Elaine Trias]]|Hi Corbett!  Here, you go!  I trust business is faring well at your clothier shop...?}}
:{{text|say|Corbett Schneider|Yes ma'am, business is brisk!}}
:{{text|say|Corbett Schneider|Thank you kindly!}}
:''Corbett turns and leaves.''
:{{text|say|Corbett Schneider|Time to get back to the shop...}}
