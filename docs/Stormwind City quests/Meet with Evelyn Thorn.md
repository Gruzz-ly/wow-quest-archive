==Objectives==
Speak with [[Evelyn Thorn]] at the [[Training Hall]] in [[Stormwind]].

==Description==
I just received a scroll from Evelyn Thorn in Stormwind. She wants you to pay a visit to the Training Hall in Stormwind. She doesn't mention specifics, but I got the impression that it was a matter of some importance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
I see you received my message. An opportunity has presented itself, <name>, one which will allow us to demonstrate just how important we are to the success of Stormwind and the [[Alliance]].
