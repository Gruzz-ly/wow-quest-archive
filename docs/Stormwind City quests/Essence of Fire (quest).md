==Objectives==
Figure out what the unusual scroll is for and report your findings to a librarian in [[Stormwind]] or [[Undercity]].
*Translate the scroll
*Find source of Fire Essence
*Solve fire puzzle

==Description==
The scroll emanates a fiery energy unlike other scrolls you've found. There is a Magical Stone near Draco'dar in the Burning Steppes that may help uncover its purpose. Translate the scroll and learn its purpose before bringing your findings back to the librarians of Stormwind or Undercity.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6600 [[XP]]
*{{cost||70}}

==Progress==
Have you found anything interesting?

==Completion==
You've found something truly interesting, <name>.

==Notes==
Use a [[Comprehension Charm]] to turn [[Scroll: SEENECS FO RIEF]] into [[Scroll: Essence of Fire]].

Destroy the [[Magical Stone (Burning Steppes)|Magical Stone]] at [[Draco'dar]] in the {{C|Burning Steppes}} with frost spells to spawn a [[Primordial Flame]], which drops the [[Depleted Essence of Fire]]. Combine it with the scroll to get the [[Imbued Essence of Fire]] to complete the quest.

==Progression==
{{Staff of Order}}
