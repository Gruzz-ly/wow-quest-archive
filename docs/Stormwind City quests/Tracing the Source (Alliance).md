This quest appears as part of the [[Love is in the Air]] [[event]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Innkeeper Allison]] at [[The Gilded Rose]] in [[Stormwind]]'s [[Trade District]].

==Description==
We've got to find the source. I've seen a lot more people than usual - guards included - going in and out of [[The Gilded Rose]]. Talk to [[Innkeeper Allison|Allison]]. If she's selling them, she can tell you where they came from.

==Completion==
Oh yes. I just got the perfume and cologne in stock recently. It's been selling so well, I don't know how long I can keep it on the shelves.

If you ask me it's kinda boring. Everything smelling the same? It smells great, but still.
