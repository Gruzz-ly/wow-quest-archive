==Objectives==
Obtain 4 sacks of Confectioners' Sugar. Deliver the sugar to [[Robby Flay]] in [[Stormwind City]].
* [[Confectioners' Sugar]] (4)

==Description==
The orphans of Stormwind are often forgotten, but not today my friend. The king has requested a special batch of cookies be baked and sent immediately over to the orphanage. I was almost finished with the final batch when I ran out of confectioners' sugar. Can you run out and get some more for me? You should be able to find it at any of the general stores or inn's inside of Stormwind.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|s=40}}
* +1 [[Cooking]]
* +1 [[Epicurean's Award]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find the Confectioner's Sugar?

==Completion==
These sacks look like just enough, <name>.  Can't wait to see the smiles on the orphans faces.

==Notes==
''Sometimes on completion, three Stormwind Orphans spawn and run up to Robby Flay, thank him, and run off.''
