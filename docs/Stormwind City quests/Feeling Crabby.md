==Objectives==
Collect 10 Canal Crabs.  Deliver them to Robby Flay in Stormwind City.
* [[Canal Crab (item)]] (10)

==Description==
Fresh crab legs have always been one of the King's favorite foods.  We have had good luck catching fresh crabs in the canals over the past few weeks.  Do you think you can lend me a hand and catch a few of them for me?  Be sure to catch them alive, they are no good to me dead, the King requires the freshest catch we can muster.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (+{{coppercost|0}} at max level)
*+1 [[Cooking]]
*+2 [[Chef's Award]]

==Progress==
You must have fast hands!  I can't believe you caught all those crabs so quickly! 

==Completion==
These crabs look great!  I will clean these up and make sure that the King hears about your contribution.  Thanks!

==Notes==
To collect the crabs just swim along the bottom of Stormwind's canals and right-click on any crabs you meet.  Taller races can use a drake mount or elekk mount to ride above water level while in the canals, while shorter races without flying will have to use mammoth mounts.
