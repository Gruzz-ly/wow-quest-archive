==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 bundles of Moontouched Wood, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
*[[Commander's Holy Symbol]]
*[[Moontouched Wood]] (5)
*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
You have shown yourself to be a capable priest and a credit to the people of [[Gnomeregan]]. The [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|high tinker]] and the [[Varian Wrynn|king of Stormwind]] wish to honor your contribution to the [[Alliance]].

They have commissioned the royal enchanter to create a special staff.

The materials for such a weapon can only be found in the cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]]. Travel there and find the lost holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moontouched wood, and ghostly essence from the spirits haunting the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Staff of the Technocrat]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
I can't believe you managed to get all those materials. I wouldn't think of venturing into Shadowfang Keep! The stories about that place are horrific.

Enough of that, though. This is a time to recognize your achievements, not prattle on about my silly fears.

==Notes==
*[[Mechagnome (playable)|Mechagnomes]] also have access to this quest, while also being offered [[Favored of the Light|the non-gnome version]]. Only one can be accepted.

==Progression==
