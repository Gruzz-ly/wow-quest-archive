==Description==
<An unfamiliar feeling wells up from deep within you, flooding your mind with thoughts and images.>

Hear my words, <name>.

Our world finds itself in the grip of a terrible crisis.

I call upon you to lend your aid in this desperate hour.

I am Naraat.

Seek me out at once, and your destiny shall be revealed.

I await you at the [[Eastern Earthshrine]] in Stormwind City.

==Completion==
May your sense of honor and duty serve [[Azeroth]] well, <class>.
