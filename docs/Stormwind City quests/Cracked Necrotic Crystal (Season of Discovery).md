==Objectives==
Bring the Cracked Necrotic Crystal to [[Lieutenant Orrin]] outside the gates of [[Stormwind]].
*[[Cracked Necrotic Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
On the corpse of the fallen [[abomination]], you discover a cracked crystal, slowly pulsing with necrotic energy.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Blessed Wizard Oil]]
*[[Consecrated Sharpening Stone]]
*[[Weighted Consecrated Sharpening Stone]]

==Progress==
Is there something you need?

==Completion==
Hm, you took this from the corpse of one of the invading abominations?

We have received word about the [[necropolis]] base camps that are being summoned by the [[Scourge]]. I suspect they wanted to create one inside Stormwind. It is good that they were unsuccessful.
