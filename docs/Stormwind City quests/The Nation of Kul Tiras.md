==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] in [[Stormwind Harbor]].
*Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore

==Description==
[[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] is the greatest naval power in all of [[Azeroth]], and a former ally. But we've had little contact with them since Jaina's father, [[Daelin Proudmoore|Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore]], was [[Invasion of Durotar#Admiral's fall|defeated at Theramore]]. 

Many have criticized Jaina's decision that day, saying she believed so deeply in the promise of peace between the Alliance and Horde that she betrayed her own father.

Perhaps she feels the time has come to atone for this.

Loath as I am to put Jaina in harm's way... Kul Tiras must join the Alliance. 

Good luck. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|70|}}
*8,250 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
Home again, after all this time.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|I must prepare my ship. Champion, meet me in the harbor when you are ready to depart.}}
:''Jaina teleports away. Anduin addresses Genn with a hint of amusement.''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|So, Genn... how are your sea legs?}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Hmph. Steady as ever.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Take a 7th Legion vessel along as an escort.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Secure a base of operations in Kul Tiras. Our plan must not fail.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|And please... look after Jaina.}}
: ''Genn bows.''
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|As you wish.}}

Get to the harbor. Unlike the [[The Nation of Kul Tiras (tutorial)|new player version of this quest]], there is no flight master shortcut, so you will have to get there manually. Speak with Jaina:
:Are you prepared for the journey to Kul Tiras?
*{{Gossip|I'm ready to set sail!}}
*(Alts) {{gossip|I've heard this tale before... <Skip the Kul Tiras introductory quests and begin your journey in Boralus.>}}
*([[Kul Tiran (playable)|Kul Tiran]] characters) {{gossip|Take me home. <Skip the Kul Tiras introductory quests and begin your journey in Boralus. Only option available>}}

Alts can choose to skip the intro quest chain from here to [[A Nation Divided]].

For those that choose the "I'm ready to set sail!" option players will travel directly to [[Boralus]]. As soon as the loading screen finishes, a [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|cinematic]] plays, Jaina's Nightmare:

{{#ev:youtube|XMPt6mxS3RY}}

: ''Out on the ocean, Jaina's [[Proudmoore flagship|Kul Tiran flagship]] and the 7th Legion [[battleship]] the ''[[Wind's Redemption]]'', are headed west toward [[Kul Tiras]] as the late evening light fades into night. Jaina is in her quarters writing in a book with quill and inkwell. A small map of Kul Tiras, suitable to be rolled into a scroll for one person, is laid out on the desk. Out of nowhere, she hears herself as a child, singing a shanty.''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina|Ahoy, ahoy sweet Daughter of the Seas.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Daelin Proudmoore|Ahoy, this child be mine.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina & Daelin|The admiral's girl, his whole entire world for as long as stars do shine.}}
:''Adult Jaina opens the door and sees Daelin holding herself as a child.''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina|Promise you'll come back?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Daelin Proudmoore|I'll weather every storm, if I know you are waiting for me.}}
:''Daelin lifts Jaina up by her armpits before setting her down.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|(offscreen) Time to go, Jaina!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina|I love you, Papa.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|(offscreen) Come topside, sweetheart.}}
:''Child Jaina runs upstairs and away as Daelin watches, before turning back to adult Jaina.''
:{{text|bossemote|Daelin Proudmoore|Your loving mother... will never forgive you. Murderer!}}
:''Daelin turns his face towards Jaina as he shouts the epithet, revealing the hidden left side to be gaunt and decomposing. Jaina wakes up with a shocked gasp, drawing a few deep breaths as she comes to her senses. The inkwell has fallen over, spilling ink on the map of Kul Tiras.''
:{{text|bossemote|Captain|Lady Jaina? We've arrived.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Thank you, Captain.}}
:''Jaina steps out on deck as the two ships approach [[Boralus]] in the morning daylight.''

Speak with Jaina to continue.

;Jumping off of the ship
:''Jaina teleports the player back onto the ship.''
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|This is no time to wander off.}}

;Description
The island nation of [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] is the greatest naval power in all of [[Azeroth]], but we've had no contact with them since Jaina's father, [[Lord Admiral]] [[Daelin Proudmoore]], was defeated at [[Theramore]].

Lady Jaina is the key to mending relations with Kul Tiras - I have asked her to sail to [[Boralus]] and speak with her mother, [[Katherine Proudmoore|Katherine]], who has taken command in Daelin's absence.

The [[Horde]] have a powerful ally in the [[Zandalari]]. If we hope to defeat them, Kul Tiras must rejoin the [[Alliance]]. Good luck.

;Completion
(It initially ended with [[Flynn Fairwind]].)
Hey, you're awake! Just in time, too.

;On accept
:{{Text|say|Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth|My king, the Lady Jaina's ship is ready to set sail.}}

:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Kul Tiras must pledge their fleet to the Alliance. Can I count on you, Jaina?}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will see it done. I will do anything to defeat the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|<Sigh.> That is what I am afraid of...}}

''The player awakes in [[Tol Dagor]].''

:{{Text|say|[[Flynn Fairwind]]|Beware... beware... the daughter of the sea... hmm hmm...}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Heyyy, look who's finally awake.}}

==Trivia==
*In the cutscene, the ink flow on the map of Kul Tiras foreshadows the [[Void]] corruption spreading throughout [[Stormsong Valley]], beginning with the [[Shrine of the Storms]].
