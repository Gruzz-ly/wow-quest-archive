==Objectives==
Speak with [[Curly]] at the stables in [[Old Town]].
* Ask a guard for directions to the Stable Master in Old Town
* Speak with [[Lindie Springstock]]
* Follow Lindie Springstock to the Stable Master in Old Town
* Speak with Curly at the stables in Old Town.

==Description==
[[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] has a lot to offer [[adventurer]]s like us, but it's far too big to explore on foot. The [[Captain Garrick|captain]] has arranged for you to receive a mount to help you get around.

She said to speak with Curly at the stables in Old Town... but I can't seem to remember the way there.

Have no worries, <name>! All we need to do is ask a guard for directions. If you ever need help finding something, the city guards will show you where to go.

Let's ask a nearby guard for directions to the stable master in Old Town!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*510 [[XP]]
*[[Golden Gryphon]]

==Progress==
Welcome to the stables, <class>. I've been expecting you.

==Completion==
So you're the newcomer that I've been hearing so much about? It's a pleasure to meet you, <name>!

[[Captain Garrick]] sent word ahead to prepare a mount. I think I have the perfect one for you!

==Notes==

A nearby [[Stormwind City Guard]] has been marked as the objective. Speak to them and select "{{gossip|quest=|Stable Master}}."
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|Did you get directions?}}

:''A sidecar appears on Lindie's [[:Chauffeured Mekgineer's Chopper]].''
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|Old Town, here we come!}}
:''You hop in and Lindie begins driving.''

As you ride, Lindie speaks. When approaching the [[Trade District]]:
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|Welcome to Stormwind, <name>! I have to say, I missed the hustle and bustle of the city.}}

Crossing the bridge in the [[Canals]] northeast of the Trade District:
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|We're headed to Old Town, which is... well, an older part of town! Stormwind has a lot of history to it.}}

Approaching the stables:
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|We're here!}}
:''Lindie dismounts his chopper and you regain control.''

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Stormwind}}
