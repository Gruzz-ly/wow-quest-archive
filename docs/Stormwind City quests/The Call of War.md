==Objectives==
Speak to [[Jace Darkweaver]] in [[Stormwind Keep]].
* Enter the Throne Room

==Description==
Welcome to [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]], the heart of the [[human]] kingdom. But today, sorrow grips this bastion of the [[Light]].

King [[Varian Wrynn]] has fallen in battle, leaving the crown to his son [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]].

The leaders of the [[Alliance]] have gathered to pay their respects. No doubt they will have need of your unique skills.

You will find the king upon the throne of [[Stormwind Keep]], attended by one of your fellow [[Illidari]]. I am needed in [[Dalaran]].

Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15070 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Dark times have fallen upon Stormwind, <name>.

With King Varian Wrynn slain on the [[Broken Shore]], uncertainty and tension grip the Alliance leaders.

The timing of this tragedy is no accident. The [[Burning Legion]] seeks to sow disorder amongst its enemies, weakening its prey from within.

We must act.

==Notes==
Stormwind Keep is filled with [[Weary-Eyed Mourner]]s, and all the Alliance faction leaders are gathered in the throne room by Varian's coffin. You're seeing the same scene as in [[The Fallen Lion]], but from a different perspective.
