==Objectives==
Buy a gryphon ride from the gryphon master [[Bartlett the Brave]], then bring Argus' Note to [[Osric Strang]], in the shop Limited Immunity, in the Old Town of [[Stormwind]].
*[[Argus' Note]] (provided)

==Description==
For a small fee, you can take a gryphon to [[Stormwind]], so you can deliver Argus' note to Osric. You won't get there faster any other way.

If that sounds acceptable, then just speak to me again when you're ready for the ride. I'll charge you a little, but trust me; it'll be worth it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||85}}
*315 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Stormwind}}

==Progress==
You've been traveling, eh? &nbsp;Have you been anywhere interesting?

==Completion==
Ah, a note from Smith Argus? &nbsp;I'm not surprised he needs more gear. &nbsp; There are so many new recruits these days.

Well thank you, <name>. &nbsp;Here's some money to cover your travel costs.
