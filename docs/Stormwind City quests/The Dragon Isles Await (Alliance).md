==Objectives==
Meet [[Wrathion]] in [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].

==Description==
Wondrous news, my friend! The [[Dragon Isles]] are awakening!

My people left our lands dormant in the wake of the [[Sundering]]. But now, at long last, we feel the call to home.

While the Isles hold many wonders, there are perils as well. We will require the aid of our mortal allies in order to reclaim our legacy.

Meet me in Stormwind. I must present the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]]' invitation to the [[Alliance]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|57|40}}
*1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Aspects' invitation extends to you as well, friend.

==Notes==
During the [[Tempest Unleashed]] event, this quest was available at level 10.

:{{Text|Say|Wrathion|Heroes of the Alliance! The Dragon Isles have awakened and beckon the [[dragonflight]]s home.}}
:{{Text|Say|Wrathion|Meet me in Stormwind, where I shall present the Aspects' invitation to the Alliance.}}

Wrathion is found with [[Turalyon]], [[Scalecommander Azurathel]], and [[Toddy Whiskers]]. Approach them.
:{{Text|Say|Wrathion|Ah, here is the hero I spoke of.}}

Turalyon has gossip:
:The Aspects have been steadfast allies to Stormwind in the past.

:But enemies have arisen from among the [[dragon]]s as well. Enemies that nearly destroyed this world.

:We must be cautious.

Azurathel does as well:
:I am Azurathel, commander of the [[Obsidian Warders]]. Wrathion guided us to this city to meet with your Alliance leaders.

:We are [[dracthyr]], soldiers trained to fight for dragonkind. But we have been sealed away on distant shores for many an age, and your world is new to us.

:I do not yet know if your kind will prove worthy of our trust. But it seems we share a common foe, and perhaps through battle we will forge a bond between us.
