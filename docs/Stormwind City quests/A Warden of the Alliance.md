==Objectives==
Purchase a Foam Sword Rack from [[Craggle Wobbletop]] and then return your ward to the [[Stormwind]] orphanage by speaking to [[Orphan Matron Nightingale]] in the [[Cathedral Square|Cathedral District]].
* [[Foam Sword Rack (common)]]

==Description==
You have been so very kind to me, <name>.  I never dreamed that I'd have so much fun during Children's Week.  Thank you.

I wish all the orphans were lucky enough to get to do the stuff we did.  Do you think we could find Craggle Wobblestop again and get a foam sword rack from him?  I think he's still pushing that cart in the [[Canals (Stormwind City)|Canals]] outside the [[Trade District]].  That way everyone at the orphanage could do something fun too!

After that, it'll be time for me to go home.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Piglet's Collar]]
*[[Rat Cage]]
*[[Turtle Box]]
*[[Snail Shell]]
*[[Pet Care Package]]
*[[Curmudgeon's Payoff]]
*[[Well-loved Figurine]]

==Progress==
It is a pleasure to see you again, <name>.  Have you attended to the duties you've volunteered for during Children's Week?

==Completion==
What's this?  A gift for all the orphans!

May the heavens bless you, <name>.  You've done more for [[Randis]] than most would ever think of doing for him.  Thank you - you're a shining star in the skies of the [[Alliance]].

Randis had so much fun with you, <name>.  He wanted to give you one of his favorite pets to remember him by.

==Notes==
On completion, the sword rack spawns beside Nightingale as she calls for the children.
