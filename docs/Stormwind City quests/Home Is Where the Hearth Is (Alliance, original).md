==Objectives==
Speak with [[Maegan Tillman|Meagan Tillman]]{{sic}} to make the [[Pig and Whistle Tavern]] your home.
* Make the Pig and Whistle Tavern your home

==Description==
I don't know about you, but all this running around has got me thirsty!

Why don't we head over to the Pig and Whistle Tavern and rest our legs over some cool pints of [[Moonberry Juice|moonberry juice]]?

While we're there, speak with Meagan{{sic}} the [[innkeeper]] to make the Pig and Whistle Tavern your new home. That way, if you ever find yourself stranded without a [[flight master]] nearby, you can use your [[:hearthstone]] to return to the inn.

Not only is it faster than a [[gryphon]], but you'll save a few [[copper]] in the process!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 510 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How can I help you today, <class>? Are you looking for a place to stay?

==Completion==
As long as the Pig and Whistle Tavern is your home, we'll keep the fire going for you while you're away!
