==Objectives==
Speak with the innkeepers of [[Stormwind]], [[Ironforge]], and [[Darnassus]], as well as [[Talvash del Kissel]] in [[Ironforge]].  Perform the tricks they ask of you in exchange for the treats they offer.

Return to [[Jesper]] in front of Stormwind with a Darnassus Marzipan, Gnomeregan Gumdrop, Stormwind Nougat, and Ironforge Mint.

*[[Gnomeregan Gumdrop]]
*[[Ironforge Mint]]
*[[Darnassus Marzipan]]

==Description==
I'm not allowed to go trick-or-treating.  After [[Deathwing]]'s attack, I'm lucky [[Orphan Matron Nightingale|Matron Nightingale]] lets me be this far away.

If you trick-or-treat for me, I'd trade you the candy you get for some I already have!

Each of the innkeepers in the big cities have candy they give for Hallow's End - talk to them and do the tricks they ask for!  Also, a little [[gnome]] named Talvash in Ironforge is handing out candy as well.  When you have all the candy, bring them back to me here!
