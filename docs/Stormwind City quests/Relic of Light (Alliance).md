==Objectives==
Travel to [[Hearthglen]] in {{C|Western Plaguelands}} and search for information on the artifact described in the journal.

==Description==
I'm intrigued by the artifact mentioned in the journal you recovered. This may be what we need to turn the tide of battle against the [[Scourge]]. Most of the surviving records from [[Andorhal]] are under the [[Scarlet Crusade]]'s protection in Hearthglen. Search through them and see if you can find more information.

==Completion==
This ledger appears to hold records of Scarlet activity in the [[Plaguelands]].

==Progression==
