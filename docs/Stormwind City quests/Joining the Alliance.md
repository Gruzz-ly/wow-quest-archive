The '''Joining the Alliance''' quest is the first quest [[Pandaren (playable)|pandaren]] players receive upon arriving [[Stormwind City]], after choosing to join the [[Alliance]] at the end of the [[Wandering Isle storyline]], in which the player, accompanied by [[Aysa Cloudsinger]], has to speak to King [[Anduin Wrynn]] in [[Stormwind Keep]]. The equivalent for players that have chosen to join the [[Horde]] is [[Joining the Horde]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin Wrynn]] at [[Stormwind Keep]].

==Description==
We have a duty, <name>.

It is our responsibility to spread the [[Tushui Pandaren|Tushui]] philosophy beyond the edges of the [[Wandering Isle]]... and there is no better place to start doing that than here: Stormwind City, heart of the Alliance.

Let's find out who their leader is. We need allies.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}}

==Completion==
Pandaren... you're here.

Good.

==Notes==
After choosing the Alliance and watching the cutscene, players appear just outside the [[Stormwind City]] [[Stormwind Gate|gates]] in [[Elwynn Forest]], beside [[Aysa Cloudsinger]] and [[Jojo Ironbrow]]. Speak with Aysa to begin.

After accepting:

Approaching [[General Hammond Clay]] in the [[Valley of Heroes]].

:{{text|say|General Hammond Clay|Pandaren? What business do you have in Stormwind?}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|We're here to join the Alliance. We seek audience with your Emperor.}}
:{{text|say|General Hammond Clay|Emperor? You'll find KING Anduin inside Stormwind Keep.}}
:{{text|emote|<General Hammond Clay eyes Jojo's [[Jade Tiger Pillar|pillar]].>}}
:{{text|say|General Hammond Clay|Behave yourselves inside Stormwind, pandaren. You're in Alliance territory now.}}

Approaching the [[Hero's Call Board]] in the [[Trade District]].
:{{text|yell|Aysa Cloudsinger|Look at this!}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Well, that's good news. Once we join the Alliance, we certainly won't run out of things to do.}}

As you escort Aysa and Jojo through Stormwind, various NPCs greet you as you make your way towards [[Stormwind Keep]]:

:{{text|say|[[Stormwind City Guard (NPC)|Stormwind City Guard]]|Never thought I'd see one of your kind walk through here.}}

:{{text|say|[[Marty]]|Hey, look! [[Gnoll]]s!}}
:{{text|say|[[Josie]]|Those aren't gnolls, silly. Use your eyes.}}
:{{text|say|Josie|Those are [[Furbolg|FURBOLGS]].}}

:{{text|say|[[Alyn Black]]|Yes. Those are pandaren, Moni.}}
:{{text|say|Moni Widdlesprock|Pandaren? Here, in Stormwind?}}

:{{text|say|Gavin Marlsbury|Good move. It worked out well for me.}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Ironbrow|Let's... just keep on moving.}}

:{{text|say|[[Naanae]]|Outsiders, yes - but their intentions are good.}}
:{{text|say|Naanae|Look carefully, Lucas. The [[Light]] is strong with them. Particularly that one.}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Let's keep moving.}}
:{{text|say|[[Jojo Ironbrow]]|What's the Light?}}
