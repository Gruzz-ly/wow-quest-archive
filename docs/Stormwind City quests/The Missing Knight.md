==Completion==
A mutual friend of ours recently reached out to ask for aid in locating a missing [[knight]] by the name of [[Dalton]]. He and his young [[squire]] were last seen in the [[plaguelands]] and have not been heard from in quite some time. If your travels take you that way, please keep an eye out for them.

Not much to go on, but you have a knack for finding yourself in all sorts of interesting situations. If anyone could stumble upon a missing knight and his pup squire in the middle of those hellish plaguelands, it's you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Testament of Divine Steed]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*+100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Notes==
This quest is meant to point paladins towards [[In a Bind (Season of Discovery)]].
