==Objectives==
Gather the supplies and deliver them to [[High Priestess Laurena]] in [[Stormwind Cathedral]].
*[[Heavy Runecloth Bandage]] (6)
*[[Major Healing Potion]] (4)
*[[Giant Egg]] (8)
*[[Stratholme Holy Water]] (4)

==Description==
<Name>, as I have studied the shard of light you brought, it has granted me visions. I see a priest of the Horde finding a similar shard, and I see the [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] coming together in a surge of light.

Unfortunately, our relations with the Horde have continued to decline.

I suggest putting together a diplomatic gift as a gesture of cross-faith goodwill. Bring these supplies to me, and we will see if we can open a dialogue between our people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Altruist Ward]]

==Progress==
Do you have the supplies?

==Completion==
I will try and find a way to deliver this to [[Orgrimmar]].

I have something for you as well - this totem will provide healing to nearby members of the Horde. Acts of service may bridge the gap where words fail us.

==Progression==
{{The Miracle}}
