==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Harrison Jones}} at [[Stormwind Keep]] in [[Stormwind City]].

==Description==
That pyramid at the [[Maker's Rise|Maker's Terrace]]{{Sic}} in [[Uldum]] is nothing of the sort. It's a [[Forge of Origination|giant machine]] that can be reconfigured for any number of uses.

[[Deathwing]] was going to have the [[Twilight's Hammer]] turn it into a massive weapon!

<Name>, you have to take the portal to get this information to Harrison Jones in Stormwind. He'll know what to do.

==Completion==
Uldum? What about it?

== Notes ==
Take the portal back to Stormwind in the [[Temple of Earth]], which will drop players off at the [[Eastern Earthshrine]] northwest of the keep. Head to the [[Royal Library]], which is just to the northwest of the throne room to find Harrison, teaching students as an [[Archaeology trainer]].

==Trivia==
The quest's title and quest text is a reference to the film ''{{Wp|Star Wars (film)|Star Wars}}'' (1977) and {{Wp|Obi-Wan Kenobi}}'s line "That's no moon", said in reference to the {{Wp|Death Star}}.

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}
