==Objectives==
Use the Totem of Freedom to free the essences of 6 [[Fireguard]]s, [[Fireguard Destroyer]]s, or [[Blazing Fireguard (mob)|Blazing Fireguards]] in [[Blackrock Depths]].
*Fireguards freed (6)
*[[Totem of Freedom]] (provided)

==Description==
Within the halls of Blackrock Depths, the [[Twilight's Hammer]] cult and the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] are gathering their forces. Backing up their legions are hordes of [[fire elemental]]s bound to the service of the [[firelord]], [[Ragnaros]].

If we can free those elementals from their bonds, we can both weaken our enemies and honor the elements. Take this totem with you and use it on subdued fireguards. It will free their spirits from their bondage and restore them to their natural state.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mask of the Farseer
|Headcover of the Farseer

You will also receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}

* +350 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Have you freed the fire elementals forced to serve our enemies?

==Completion==
You have truly served both the Alliance and your calling as a <class>.
