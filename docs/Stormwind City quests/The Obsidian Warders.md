==Objectives==
Deliver the [[Scalecommander Azurathel|scalecommander]]'s orders to Dervishian and the [[Obsidian Warders]].
*Orders delivered to [[Dervishian]]
*Deliver the news of your success to Toddy Whiskers at Stormwind Harbor.

==Description==
;Dracthyr
This [[Toddy Whiskers|Toddy]]'s enthusiasm is admirable. But I hope it does not blind her to the dangers awaiting us in the [[Dragon Isles]].

No matter. We are the Obsidian Warders. It is our duty to protect the expedition.

I must speak with [[Wrathion]] and the [[Turalyon|Lord Commander]] about the mission ahead.

Devishian is exploring the city with the others. Inform her that we will rendezvous at the docks. We must prepare for our journey home.

;Non-dracthyr
This Toddy's enthusiasm is admirable. But I hope it does not blind her to the dangers awaiting us in the Dragon Isles.

Regardless, the Obsidian Warders are duty-bound to protect the expedition.

I must speak with Wrathion and the Lord Commander about the mission ahead.

My fellow [[dracthyr]] are exploring the city. Seek out Dervishian, my trusted lieutenant, and inform her that we are to rally at the docks. She will relay my orders to the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Ye think a dracthyr can fly faster than a [[gryphon]]?

==Completion==
I'm pleased the dracthyr are comin' with us.

Can't wait to challenge that scalecommander to a race on ol' [[Wildfeather]].

My gryphon will best his leathery ol' wings any day!

==Notes==
During the [[Tempest Unleashed]] event, this quest was available at level 10. Low-level characters on this quest were given {{Abilities|Summon Dragon Flight|id=397925|icon=ability_mount_drake_bronze}}, an [[Extra Action Button]] spell that summoned a Bronze Drake to ride.

[[Dervishian]] is found on the tower atop the [[Stormwind Stockade]], alongside two pairs of sparring [[Dracthyr Evoker]]s. Talk to her:

:Welcome to our makeshift training ring, friend.

:I trust we are not disturbing anyone up here? I've instructed the warders to be very careful to keep blasts of magic from falling down below.

:{{gossip|[[Scalecommander Azurathel]] would like you to meet him at the docks.}}

:{{text|say|Dervishian|The dracthyr stand ready.}}
:''Dervishian and the evokers fly off toward the [[Stormwind Harbor]].''

;On completion
:''A mage portal suddenly appears, and [[Archmage Khadgar]] jumps out of it. ''
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Sorcery! We're under attack!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Be at ease, Toddy. This is a friend, not a foe.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Apologies for my abrupt arrival. But the news I bring cannot wait for pleasantries.}}
