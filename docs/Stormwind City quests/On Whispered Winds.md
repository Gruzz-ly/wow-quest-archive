==Objectives==
Meet [[Maiev Shadowsong]] and [[Shandris Feathermoon]] in [[Stormwind Keep]].

==Description==
<Name>,

I have need of you.

Maiev and Shandris are en route to Stormwind to petition [[Anduin Wrynn|King Wrynn]] for aid in retaking [[Darkshore]].

You have proven a loyal ally to my people in times past. I ask that you join their audience with the king and lend your voice to our cause.

I suspect we shall meet again soon.

-[[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]]

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Blessing of the Night Warrior]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I suspected Tyrande might reach out to you once she heard of our intentions.

==Notes==
;When entering [[Boralus Harbor]]
:{{Text|bossemote|Dori'thur swoops in from high above bearing a message for you!}}

Go to the [[War Room]] in Stormwind Keep. Two guards are barring entry, but as you approach, they make way for you and stand at attention at the sides of the doorway.

Inside:
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|...And what of the countless dead? Of the families that will never be whole again?}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The [[kaldorei]] have been loyal to the [[Alliance]]. Are we now left to fend for ourselves?}}

Present in the room are [[Maiev Shadowsong]], [[Shandris Feathermoon]], [[Sira Moonwarden]], [[Velen]], [[Jost]], [[Divinius]], [[Genn Greymane]], [[Lorna Crowley]], [[Greyguard]]s, [[Anduin Wrynn]], and [[Lion's Guard]]s.
