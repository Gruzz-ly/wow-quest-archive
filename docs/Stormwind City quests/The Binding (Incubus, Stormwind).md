==Objectives==
Using the Wooden Figurine, summon and subdue an [[incubus]], then return the Wooden Figurine to [[Gakin the Darkbinder]] in the [[Slaughtered Lamb]].
*[[Summoned Incubus]] slain
*[[Wooden Figurine]] (provided)

==Description==
The time has come. Take the figurine and descend into the crypts below. A summoning circle has been prepared, and you must place the figurine at its center.

Then the gateway will open, and the incubus will cross into [[Azeroth|our world]].

A [[sayaad]] is not to be underestimated. The [[demon]] will not hesitate to attack when it realizes your ruse. You must draw upon all you have been taught to defeat it.

If you succeed, return to me and I shall bind the creature to your will. Fail, and your [[soul]] is forfeit.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*[[Summon Incubus]]

You will also receive:
* 1150 [[XP]]
*[[Small Soul Pouch]]

==Progress==
The incubus will try to lower your guard through beguilement and deception. The demon is adept at swaying the hearts of [[mortal]]s.

Remember that anything it may offer you is false. To the demon, you are merely prey.

==Completion==
Not bad, <name>. Your have bested the fiend, and your will remains unbroken.

Many a warlock has believed themselves strong enough to bind a sayaad, only to become the demon's next meal instead. I am pleased to see you are not so foolish.

Watch closely, and I will teach you the invocation to call upon your newly bound incubus.
