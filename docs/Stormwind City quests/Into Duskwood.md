==Objectives==
Speak with [[Vassandra Stormclaw]] in [[Duskwood]].

==Description==
There is a [[night elf]] I met in [[Teldrassil]], Vassandra Stormclaw, who may be able to teach [[Tess Greymane|Tess]] without resorting to such an extreme measure. She is the one who originally helped our people with their affliction.

Vassandra is currently in Duskwood, assisting the residents of [[Raven Hill]] with their attempts to cure the feral [[worgen]] in the area. If anyone knows about the [[Worgen curse|curse]], it is her.

As a more personal request, do not let my daughter do anything too rash. She takes after her father in that way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Is there something you need, <class>?

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|[[Tess Greymane]]|<Name>, I will meet you in Duskwood... before my father forbids it.}}

;Speaking with Genn
:{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{Text|say|[[Genn Greymane]]|It is impossible to reason with that girl!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Mia Greymane]]|Remind you of anyone, dear? She did not inherit her temper from me.}}
:{{Text|say|Mia Greymane|But... she's not wrong. [[Liam Greymane|Liam]] was the heir apparent. He was meant to lead [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneas]].}}
:{{Text|say|Mia Greymane|Now that he is gone, Tess is searching for answers to questions she never thought she would ask.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Not a day goes by without me thanking the [[Light]] that the two of you were spared the curse. It is not the answer she seeks.}}
:{{Text|say|Mia Greymane|Perhaps not, but that is a lesson she must learn herself. Let her talk to the druid. We'll see how that goes.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|And if it goes badly?}}
:{{Text|say|Mia Greymane|Then we'll have another one of these pleasant family conversations.}}

;Approaching Vassandra
:{{Text|say|Vassandra Stormclaw|[[Goldrinn]]'s curse is dangerous, Princess Greymane. I have spent much time and effort in search of a way to cure it.}}
:{{Text|say|Vassandra Stormclaw|But if words alone will not suffice, then I believe I know another path to wisdom.}}
