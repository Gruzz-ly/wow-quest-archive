==Objectives==
Speak with [[Veruca Darkstream]] at the [[Training Hall]] in [[Stormwind]].

==Description==
It seems that the leaders of [[SI:7]] have taken an interest in your progress and your service to the [[Alliance]]. Veruca Darkstream, a high ranking member of SI:7, has asked to speak with you. Veruca is awaiting your arrival at the Training Hall in Stormwind.

I'm not sure what she wants with you, but it seemed important.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 150 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
I hope my message didn't unnerve you, <name>. I have called you here to recognize your accomplishments.

==Notes==
Due to an implementation error, the player completing this quest will get an error sound and the message "You don't meet the requirements for that quest." Proceed into the SI:7 building, and speak to either [[Lord Tony Romano]] or [[Arthur Huwe]] to pick up the next quest, [[A Royal Reward]].

In ''Legion'', the quest ender was changed from [[Osborne the Night Man]] to [[Lord Tony Romano]].
