==Objectives==
Meet [[Ambassador Moorgard]] at the [[Stormwind Embassy]].

==Description==
For the first time in our history, the [[Azeroth|outside world]] is ours to explore and experience.

An off-island faction known as the [[Alliance]] came to the aid of our kin. Valiant and wise, the stalwart Alliance has extended an open hand to our people.

Will you be among the first to accept and visit their lands, learn their histories and walk amongst their people?

If that path calls to you, then I hope you'll return to share those experiences and show the earthen what the world has to offer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||2}}
* 180 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well, here we are! Another earthen from... the [[Isle of Dorn]] is it?

A couple of [[Wildhammer dwarf|Wildhammers]] sent word that some of your people might be coming to visit.

Well, make yourself at home here in town. The Alliance welcomes all of its new friends with open arms.

Welcome to [[Stormwind]]!

==Notes==
On accept:

:{{text|say|Foreman Uzjax|A spark to experience. An impetus to live. I admit... I misjudged your efforts, Dawn.}}
:{{text|say|Dawn|All earthen deserve something more than what we were bound by, Uzjax. Including yourself.}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Uzjax|For once... I am inclined to believe that.}}
