==Objectives==
Speak with [[Julien Faranister|Vault Keeper Faranister]] in the [[Canal District]] of [[Stormwind]] and return to [[Katherine the Pure|Katherine]] when you've learned what you can.
*Find out more about the break-in

==Description==
Please make your way over to the southeastern area of the canals and speak with the Vaultkeeper there, Julien Faranister. He can tell you what he knows. Learn what you can about the crime. There were a lot of people who would have wanted to steal [[Mannoroc Orb|that orb]], so gathering as much information as we can now while the crime scene is fresh is vital.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
That isn't much to go on, but its{{sic}} better than nothing I suppose.

I'm interested to hear what you learned in your meeting with [[Aeonas]], but I am afraid this matter takes priority at the moment. Let's talk about our current lead.

==Notes==
Speak to [[Julien Faranister]]:
{{Dialogue|
Yes, paladin?

{{gossip|Katherine the Pure sent me. She tells me there was a break-in. Please give me all of the details you have regarding what happened.}}

We can't be entirely sure but it appears that two or more separate groups may have had designs on the stolen property. When our guards came upon the vault, it was quite the scene. There were multiple dead assailants wearing red hooded robes as well as a disgusting [[demon]]! It was horrible.

{{gossip|Did your guards or personnel see anything that could help us determine who did this? Do you have any information on who may have killed these robed figures or the demon?}}

Again, regrettably, no. No one saw anything. I did recover this talisman from one of the bodies, however.

<The vault keeper hands you a metal-wrought talisman with a crude symbol depicting a burning sword>

I hope this helps. You have our most sincere apologies for the loss of [[Knights of the Silver Hand|your order]]'s property, paladin.
