==Objectives==
Speak with [[Aysa Cloudsinger]] at the [[Stormwind Embassy]] to hear the end of this tale.

==Description==
I can't thank ye enough, <name>. Without yer help, [[:Ironfoe]] would be lost tae us and [[the Black Anvil]] could've ne'er been made whole.

But even more than that, ye've proven to every [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron]] in the [[Blackrock Mountain|mountain]] what it means tae be part o' somethin' bigger. Tae be part o' the [[Alliance]].

The time has come tae let King Anduin know that my people stand with him.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive: {{cost|23|40||}}
|Dark Iron Core Hound
}}

You will also receive: [[Allied Races: Dark Iron Dwarf]]

==Completion==
And so ends the tale of how the Dark Iron dwarves joined the Alliance.

Those who we once believed to be enemies of the Alliance are now close allies. Their mastery over the earth continues to help the Alliance.

There's an important lesson here, <name>. Even amongst our fiercest enemies are those who may one day become allies.

==Notes==
This quest is obtained on the heels of [[Forged in Fire an' Flame]], inside the quest-specific instance of [[Blackrock Depths]]. On turning in that quest and accepting this one, take the [[mole machine]] near the Black Anvil back to the Stormwind Embassy.

Congratulations! You have now unlocked [[Dark Iron dwarf (playable)|playable Dark Iron dwarves]].
