==Objectives==
Speak with Bordol Dewgarden about relaxation, then relax by [[Olivia's Pond]] in [[Stormwind]].
* Speak to [[Bordol Dewgarden]]
* Relax (0/100%) {{co|61.2|11.2|Stormwind City}}
*Return to Bordol Dewgarden at the Gala of Gifts.

==Description==
Self-love can take many different forms. And on occasion{{sic}} it can take the form of relaxing.

The [[night elf]] by the fireworks seems particularly relaxed.

Perhaps you could ask him for his insights on relaxation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Love Token]]
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
True love is letting your guard down. Let yourself relax, you will see what I mean.

==Completion==
You feel renewed, don't you? Personally, I love petting the turtles.

Did you discover your favorite relaxation technique?

==Notes==
Speak with [[Bordol Dewgarden]]:
{{book|content=
{{gossip|quest=|Teach me how to relax.}}

I am honored you would ask me that, <brother/sister>. But I cannot teach that to you.

You must learn what relaxing could mean for you...

Perhaps try Olivia's Pond! The party scene is a bit calmer there. 

May luck find you there, <brother/sister>.

Head to Olivia's Pond, east of the [[Stormwind Embassy]], where several characters which have dialogue:
:{{text|say|[[Marina Hollyden]]|Ah, now this is the life. Nothing's more gratifyin' than taking a pole out to open waters.}}
:{{text|say|[[Mitiis]]|Hello there! Help yourself to a chair and enjoy one of my books. It's a wonderful day for reading by the pond!}}
:{{text|say|[[Mairinn Boulderbreaker]]|Aye, you can pet 'em if ye like! I brought these ones from the shelter. Donna worry, they won't bite ye!}}

Many things can be interacted with, such as petting pets such as [[Cat (Love is in the Air)|Cats]], [[Dog (Love is in the Air)|Dogs]], [[Playful Fawn]], and [[Pettable Critter]]s. [[Reading Chair]]s, [[Fishing Boat]]s, [[Steamy Romance Novels]], and [[Historic Lore Books]] to fill up the Relax bar, or simply stand in the area, which gives you the Reading buff. There are also drinks nearby - [[Cup of Kafa (object)|Cup of Kafa]], [[Glass of Wine]], and [[Lemon Silverleaf Tea]]. [[Curious Swirling Pool]]s can be fished in. Staying in the fishing area gives the [[Gone Fishing]] buff that fills up the objective bar.
