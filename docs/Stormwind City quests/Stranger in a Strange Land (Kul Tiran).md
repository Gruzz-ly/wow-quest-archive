Find [[Chronormu|Chromie]] in [[Stormwind City]].

==Description==
Welcome to Stormwind, <race>. King [[Anduin Wrynn]] invites you to explore our fair city. Since you hail from [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]], might I suggest visiting our lovely [[Stormwind Harbor|docks]]? They are home to our majestic fleet. I would be shocked if you were not impressed!

Ah, but that can wait, a [[Chronormu|bronze dragon]] has asked to talk to you. She is sitting under the nearby tree, on an hourglass of all things!

After that, an emissary of Kul Tiras is waiting to welcome you to the city. Sounds like a busy day for you!

Have a pleasant stay, <name>.

You will receive:
* {{cost||1|25}}
* 400 [[XP]]

Enjoying your stay in Stormwind?
