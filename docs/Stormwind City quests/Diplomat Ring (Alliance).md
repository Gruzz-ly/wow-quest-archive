==Objectives==
Bring the requested materials to [[High Priestess Laurena]] in [[Stormwind Cathedral]].
*[[Arcanite Bar]] (2)
*[[Blood of the Mountain]] (3)
*[[Blue Sapphire]] (3)

==Description==
The diplomatic gift you assembled has reached the [[Forsaken]] [[priest]] Dietrich Praice, and I have made discreet contact with them. We both agree this search should be kept among the faithful. If the shards can be used as a weapon, it is best that they not fall into the hands of either faction's leaders.

We have devised a secret means of identification for those seeking the shards. Bring me materials to forge a ring that will contain a sliver of one of the shards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Diplomat Ring (item)]]

==Progress==
The cutting from the shard is ready, <name>. Do you have the other materials?

==Completion==
<With a conveniently quick spell, Laurena transmutes the materials and the gem cutting into a ring>

Unfortunately, this was the easy part.

==Progression==
