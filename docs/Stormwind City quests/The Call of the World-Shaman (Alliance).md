'''The Call of the World-Shaman''' is a breadcrumb quest leading into the [[Elemental Bonds questline]], a short but elaborate story focused on [[Thrall]] and [[Aggralan]], serving as a prelude to the [[Firelands Invasion]]. Two bosses from the [[Firelands (instance)|Firelands]] raid make an appearance, but the questline is not required for the raid or any other content.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Thrall]] just south of the [[Nordrassil|World Tree]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

==Description==
The [[Earthen Ring]] calls to you once more, <name>.

As a member of the [[Alliance]], I know that you may have reservations working with the one you call Thrall, the former Warchief of the [[Horde]]. But he has specifically requested an Alliance hero to accompany him in his next endeavor, a ritual of healing that will profoundly impact our world.

Cast aside your doubts, <class>, and heed the World Shaman's call.

You will find him under the boughs of [[Nordrassil]] in [[Mount Hyjal]], on the southern side of the tree.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*34,700 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|27}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
It would appear my message has been heard in [[Stormwind]].

Thank you, <name>. Let us get to work...

==Notes==
Naraat offers this quest at the [[Eastern Earthshrine]] in Stormwind. Take the portal to Hyjal just to the northeast and head south of the [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|Well of Eternity]] once there.

Thrall's gossip text:
:Has the Earthen Ring sent you?
:Our efforts to heal the land must begin here, at the World Tree. I'm glad you are here to witness this.
