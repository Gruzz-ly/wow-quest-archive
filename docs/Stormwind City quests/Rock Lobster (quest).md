==Objectives==
Collect 6 Rock Lobsters from the cages below the docks in [[Stormwind Harbor]].  Watch out for sharks! 
* [[Rock Lobster (quest item)]] (6)

==Description==
If I could choose my last meal, it would definitely be fresh lobster tail.  Something about that tasty crustacean is just irresistible!  We recently started trapping lobsters here in Stormwind.  Would you mind heading out and checking the traps for me?

One more thing, watch out for the sharks.  They can be vicious down there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|74000}} (or {{coppercost|132300}} on lvl 85)
+1 [[Fishing]]
{{Itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
Looks like you were able to avoid the sharks.  Were there any lobsters in the traps? 

==Completion==
Looks like the traps are working!  Thanks <name>! 

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Stormwind]].

The quest-giver (Catherine Leland) will cast [[Water Gliding]] (water breathing and +50% underwater movement bonus) on the player upon quest acceptance.

*Two Bluetip Thresher sharks patrol the underwater portion of the harbor. They were originally level 85, with a wide aggro range, and hit like trucks. The sharks were soon nerfed down to level 15, with ~330 health, so that low-level players could successfully complete the quest.
*You may have a problem seeing the cages if you have the [[Call of Duty (Alliance)]] quest in your [[Quest Log]].

==Patch changes==
