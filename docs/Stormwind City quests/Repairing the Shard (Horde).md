==Objectives==
Retrieve the book "Applied Divinity" from [[Dire Maul]], then return to [[High Priestess Laurena]] in [[Stormwind Cathedral]].

To enter [[Stormwind]], you will need the assistance of an [[Alliance]] [[Priest]] with a Diplomat Ring to gain Diplomatic Immunity. You will lose Diplomatic Immunity if you stray too far from your escorting Priest or engage in combat.
*[[Applied Divinity]]

==Description==
I am willing to believe you are here in good faith, <class>.

We are receptive to a meeting between our people. But the shard of light we possess is in poor condition. We must replenish it before any attempt at joining with the others.

The ancient [[Highborne]] of what is now Dire Maul were skilled in manipulating arcane and holy energies. Go there and find any information you can on artifacts of light, then return to me.

==Progress==
You have returned, <class>?

==Completion==
This should help to repair the shard. The time has come to bring an end to this.
