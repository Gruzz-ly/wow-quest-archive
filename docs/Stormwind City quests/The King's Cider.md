==Objectives==
Obtain 12 Juicy Apples.  Deliver the fruit to Robby Flay in Stormwind City.
* [[Juicy Apple]] (12)

==Description==
I am forever in debt to our King for all that he has done for us.  One thing I can do for him is make his favorite drink!  Lucky for us, the ingredients we need to make this wonderful drink are located right here in Stormwind City.  Apple trees can be found in every district of Stormwind.  These trees are too tall to pick the fruit from, but lucky for us the apples have fallen to the ground and are easy to retrieve.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (+{{coppercost|0}} at max level)
*+2 [[Cooking]]
*+1 [[Epicurean's Award]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find enough juicy apples?

==Completion==
These will do nicely <name>.  I will get to work right away on the cider.
