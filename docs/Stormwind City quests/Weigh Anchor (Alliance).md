==Objectives==
Bring the Crate of Felslate to [[Walcott Sutton]] at [[Stormwind Harbor]].
* [[Crate of Felslate]]
* Deliver the crate to Walcott

==Description==
<Name>, I was hoping to ask you for a small favor. The naval fleet at Stormwind Harbor have been requesting large amounts of [[:felslate]] to help construct supplies for their ships.

I'm pretty busy here coordinating the gathering efforts and all my couriers are still out. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking that shipment over there to them?

I heard there's a portal to [[Stormwind]] in the [[Greyfang Enclave]] here in [[Dalaran]] so it shouldn't be a long trip or anything.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Plans: Felslate Anchor]]

==Progress==
Did [[Alard Schmied|Alard]] send you?

==Completion==
Whaddya got for me?

More felslate, fantastic! This stuff weighs a ton, and is perfect for anchors.

I see you have the arms of a blacksmith. Perhaps you'd like ta have a hand at making a few anchors as well, eh?

==Notes==
Loot the item from the crate in the shop. Go to Stormwind Harbor and speak with Walcott Sutton.
:How's it going, <name>? Is there something I can help you with?

:{{Gossip|I have your felstate shipment.}}
:{{Text|say|Walcott Sutton|Excellent timing, <name>. We just used the last of that stuff and thought we'd have to wait longer for more. Thanks!}}
