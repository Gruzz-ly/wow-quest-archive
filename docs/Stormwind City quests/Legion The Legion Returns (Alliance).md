==Objectives==
Check in with [[Recruiter Lee]] at [[Stormwind Harbor]].
* [[Stormwind Portal Stone]] (provided)

==Description==
Heroes of the [[Alliance]], I write to you in [[Azeroth]]'s darkest hour. From the maw of hell, the burning armies of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] have returned.

Our fleets depart for the [[Broken Isles]] at once. As a grand lance, we will pierce the Legion's lines and drive them back to the [[Twisting Nether|nether]] that spawned them.

Your ship awaits in the Stormwind Harbor, make haste.


King<br/>
[[Varian Wrynn]]

==Completion==
Hail, <name>. I've got your ship assignment right here.

But first, a bit of readiness is in order!

==Notes==
If you have already completed the Broken Shore storyline on an Alliance character, Recruiter Lee will offer an option to skip it and teleport straight to [[Dalaran]] in the [[Broken Isles]], with [[In the Blink of an Eye]] ready for turn-in. If you skip it and wish to play through the Broken Shore storyline on this character later, visit [[Archivist Elysiana]] in the [[Violet Citadel]] in Dalaran.
