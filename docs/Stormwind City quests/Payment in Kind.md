==Objectives==
Meet with Anduin Wrynn in [[Stormwind Keep]].
* Speak with [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]

==Description==
<Name>, King Anduin has requested our presence in [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].

We've sent him reports on our situation here in [[Nazjatar]], and he understands the severity of the threat we're facing. For him to pull both of us back from the front lines, it must be a matter of grave importance.

I will meet you in Stormwind Keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Thank you for coming, <name>.

==Completion==
We may be at [[Fourth War|war]] with the [[Horde]], but that did not stop [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] from doing the right thing.

We can do no less for him.

==Notes==
