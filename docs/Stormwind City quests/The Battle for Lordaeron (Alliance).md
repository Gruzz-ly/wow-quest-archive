:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|Brothers and sisters of the Alliance, hear me!}}
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|The Horde's cowardly attack on Teldrassil brought war upon us... and made clear what is truly at stake.}}
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|Their warchief's goal was not to capture a single city, but to destroy our way of life... and snuff out hope for generations to come.}}
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|To secure our future, the Banshee Queen must answer for her crimes. Her dark reign ends today!}}
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|Together we will drive her evil from this land... and raise our banners above Lordaeron once more!}}

===Clearing the Way===
*Description: Siege Towers Defended

*Bonus objective: Shredder Defeated
*Bonus objective: Rescue the gnome mage

Follow Genn into the battlefield and clear the enemies, including a [[Goblin Shredder (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Goblin Shredder]], [[Horde Demolisher (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Horde Demolishers]], [[Goblin Sapper (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Goblin Sappers]], [[Tauren Earthshaker (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Tauren Earthshakers]], [[Darkspear Shaman (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Darkspear Shaman]].

:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|King Anduin is leading the assault! Push past the reserves and secure the battlefield!}}
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|Smoke is... so thick...}}
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|These goblins must be stopped! Focus on the shredder!}}

Just ahead is [[Field Marshal Cogspark]], who has used a [[Ring of Frost]] to entomb a handful of Horde defenders. Help free her.
:{{Text|say|[[Field Marshal Cogspark]]|Thank you everyone. I can handle it from here!}}

Focus on machines and destroy them, then mop up nearby units to fill the bar.
:{{Text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|All units, to the gates! Victory for the Alliance!}}

===Clearing the Way===
*Description: Defeat the [[Azerite War Machine (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Azerite War Machine]]
*Defeat the Azerite War Machine

:{{Text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|It is over, Sylvanas! The walls of Lordaeron will soon come crashing down around you.}}
:{{Text|yell|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|You have no idea what you're up against, boy king. We've only just begun!}}
:''The Azerite War Machine exits the fog of war, obliterating everything in its path.''
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|I've never seen anything like it...}}
:{{Text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|Anything made can be broken! Genn, follow me!}}

Start attacking it. When the war machine is at 30% health, Sylvanas intervenes:
:{{text|yell|Sylvanas Windrunner|Enough meddling! The towers, the towers!}}
:''The Alliance siege towers all have their tops blown off.''

Finish off the war machine.

===Breach the Wall===
:''Anduin jumps on the war machine and sticks his sword in it, landing the finishing blow.''
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Prepare the Blight! Let it rain down upon their armies!}}
:{{Text|say|[[High Overlord Saurfang]]|There must be another way, Warchief!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|This is no time for sentiment, High Overlord!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|War demands that we take a more direct approach.}}
:''Sludge Guards start spraying blight, killing friend and foe alike. Sylvanas appears and raises the fallen.''

===Blighted Grounds===
*Description: Evacuate wounded soldiers before they are infected by blight gas.
*Defend King Anduin and evacuate the wounded (0/100%)

:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It's killing her own troops...}}
:''Sylvanas channels a spell and raises the dead as [[Risen Skeleton]]s.
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|DESTROY THEM!}}
:{{Text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|She's raising their bodies! We must evacuate the wounded!}}
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|The blight is too dangerous, my king! We cannot afford to--}}
:{{Text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|The Alliance leaves no soldier behind!}}
:{{Text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|Not this time...}}

Various [[Risen Skeleton]]s and [[Sludge Guard (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Sludge Guards]] charge at the army. The entire area is increasingly covered in blight, and it moves slowly north toward Brill. The blight deals significant damage, so keep retreating, and try to stay within Anduin's healing aura.

While killing the undead, also interact with [[Wounded Soldier (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Wounded Soldiers]]. They can say any of the following:
*{{Text|say|Wounded Soldier|It was foolish of me to get caught away from the line. Thank you for the second chance.}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Soldier|You have my thanks!}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Soldier|Thank you, Champion. I will find my own way out of here.}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Soldier|I... I think I can make it. Thank you.}}

Fall back with King Anduin Wrynn. As the progress bar nears 100%:
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|My king, our siege towers are lost! Our numbers are waning...}}
:{{Text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|Father, help me. I need your guidance. I need...}}

===The Light is Fading===
A cinematic plays:

:''Anduin and Greymane lead Alliance forces back to Brill, away from the cloud of blight. As they reach a clear area, both kings turn and face the walls of Lordaeron.''
:{{text|bossemote|Genn Greymane|The blight has broken our ranks!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Our assault...has been for nothing.}}
:''A cold wind begins to blow; both kings turn, and Genn growls as a stormcloud approaches them from the rear.''
:{{text|bossemote|Genn Greymane|What now?}}
:''The cloud parts, revealing a massive [[Proudmoore flagship|Kul Tiran flagship]] held aloft by arcane magic. Standing at the bow, hair and cloak whipping in the wind, is...''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina!}}
:''[[Jaina Proudmoore]] raises her hands, channeling a wave of frost magic to clear the blight clouds and freeze the Forsaken catapults and the risen skeletons.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Alliance! Forward!}}
:''Anduin leads his rallied troops through the clearing haze towards Lordaeron. As he approaches the base of the walls, he turns and looks upward.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina! The wall!}}
:''Jaina uses her magic to swing the ship to port and expose its full starboard side, its arcane-charged broadside cannons blasting a hole in the city's outer walls. Approaching the breach, Anduin dismounts and draws Shalamayne.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|We end this... now.}}

===The Winds of Change===
*Description: Find Jaina at the walls of Lordaeron.
*Infiltrate the keep with King Anduin
*Assist Jaina

Meet up with Jaina, busy fighting [[Royal Dreadguard (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Dreadguards]], tauren and jungle trolls.

:{{Text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina! Thank the Light you've come! You are sorely needed in this fight.}}
:{{Text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I stand with you, my king. The Horde will pay for its crimes. I'll block off the entrance so our forces can regroup.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I don't know how long these walls will hold. We should not linger here.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Sound advice. We didn't give Sylvanas much time to prepare for this attack, but we can't afford to underestimate her.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Everyone, fall into position. We strike on my command!}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Genn, I need you to cover our backs. It's too risky to funnel everyone through the side of the keep all at once. There will certainly be traps.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Agreed. I'll guard the rear flank.}}

===The Great Eagle===
*Description: Defeat the Darkspear trolls and their leader, Durja.
*Defeat [[Windseeker Durja|Durja]]

The army charges at trolls, including [[Darkspear Ballista]]s, [[Darkspear Marksman (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Darkspear Marksmen]], [[Darkspear Warrior (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Darkspear Warriors]], and [[Orgrimmar Raider]]s. Kill all units, then Durja will engage.

:{{Text|yell|Nathanos Blightcaller|It is you who is outnumbered now.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|That army is enormous... Give the word, and I will teleport us to safety.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|If we turn tail now, we just become prey. No. We'll fight - and die, if we must - for what we believe in!}}
:{{Text|yell|Nathanos Blightcaller|Your time is up, King Anduin!}}
:{{Text|yell|Nathanos Blightcaller|VICTORY FOR THE FORSAKEN!}}
:{{Text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|ALLIANCE, HOLD YOUR GROUND!}}
:''Just as the Horde forces prepare to attack, [[Alleria Windrunner]] opens up a [[Void Rift]] to teleport in [[Gelbin Mekkatorque]], a squad of [[Flametron 5000]], and [[Ren'dorei Ranger]]s, and [[Alliance Mage]]s.''
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Let us even the odds, King Wrynn!}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria! Thank the Light you've made it!}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I am known for my timing, your majesty. Mekkatorque, are you ready for battle?}}
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|Indubitably! I brought some extra machines for backup. Feel free to give 'em a spin!}}

Players can mount the robot and attack the enemies - [[Undercity Guardian|Abominations]], [[Royal Cavalier]]s, Dreadguards, Sludge Guards, Goblin Sappers, [[Forsaken Blight Thrower (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Forsaken Blight Throwers]], and a [[Shredder (Ruins of Lordaeron)|Shredder]] which is protected by [[Goblin Landmine]]s.
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina, Genn, help me with Blightcaller and Lor'themar.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria, take the rest of our troops and focus on routing the enemy army.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|As you wish. Champions, with me!}}
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|My machines are at your command!}}

Push forward:
:{{Text|yell|Nathanos Blightcaller|Hahaha! Look who joins the fray. Good, I was hoping you'd keep this interesting!}}
:{{Text|yell|Alleria Windrunner|I assure you, Blightcaller, the pleasure is all mine.}}
:{{Text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|The void elves... those traitors must be dealt with!}}

Fill the progress bar to continue.

===Blast!===
*Find Sylvanas Windrunner
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Baine, pull them back!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|RETREAT!}}
:''Sylvanas unleashes a shot on a container of blight, before looking at Jaina and Anduin, then running off.''
:{{text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|No! They must not escape!}}

After the cutscene, Jaina, Anduin, Alleria, and Gelbin are looking at the Blight.
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The Horde is falling back again? What is their strategy, here?}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|That accursed blight blocks our path. Our forces can't follow her.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We can't let the warchief escape. Capturing her is the only way to win this war.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Understood. We will not let you go alone.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Mekkatorque, can your flying machines get us past this blight?}}
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|I don't have many of them, but the ones I do are at your disposal.}}

===She's Getting Away!===
*Description: Pursue Sylvanas in the Gyrocopter.
*Use the Gyrocopter to Pursue Sylvanas

:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|So be it. Champions, with me. Mekkatorque, backtrack through the keep with the rest of our forces, and station them at Brill. Be ready to strike on my command.}}
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|You've got it.}}
Interact with the [[Gnomish Flying Machine]] and take a ride to the entrance of the city.

===The High Overlord===
*Description: Defeat High Overlord Saurfang.
*Confront High Overlord Saurfang

:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Stand aside, Saurfang. This war is not yours to bear alone, and there is no honor in killing you.}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|Your father was a man of honor, boy. You know nothing of the sort.}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|I will NEVER stand down! I eat, sleep, and die by the sword. What price have you paid for your people?}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|My father gave everything for the Alliance! The question is, are you willing to do the same for the Horde?}}
:{{Text|yell|High Overlord Saurfang|MY LIFE FOR THE HORDE!}}

Let the NPCs tank. Saurfang is strong and can kill easily with his abilities. Upon reaching 20% health, a cutscene will play.

===The Dark Lady===
*Description: Pursue Sylvanas
*Confront Sylvanas Windrunner

: ''His axe on the ground beside the kneeling warrior, Varok has been laid low.''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Alliance... hold!}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|No! I demand an honorable death!}}
:''Anduin sheathes his sword on his back while walking up to Saurfang.''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|My father once said that Varok Saurfang embodied what was best about the horde...}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|He admired you for that, and so do I.}}
: ''Anduin kneels to appeal directly to the old warrior.''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Listen to me. There is no honor in this.}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|That is not for an Alliance king to decide!}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|At this moment, it is.}}
:''Anduin stands and speaks to a few nearby guards.''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Take him to the [[Stockades]].}}
: ''They bind Saurfang's wrists and walk him away.''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|When I return, we will [[Lost Honor|speak of honor]]... and how it may yet be reclaimed.}}
:''Varok responds with scepticism.''
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|If... you return.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We've done it. Sylvanas will finally answer for her crimes. Champions, to my side...}}

Follow Anduin into the throne room, where an ending cutscene plays:

:''Anduin, Genn, Jaina and Alleria walk under the ruined belltower inside Lordaeron Keep. Anduin looks up at the dome of the royal palace, similarly to how [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] had when he returned from Northrend at the start of the Third War. Pushing open the doors to the throne room, Anduin steps into the center of the seal on the floor to face Sylvanas, who is lounging on Terenas' throne. Her sarcasm drips heavily.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Look at you. The boy's playing soldier.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Genn Greymane|Our king just routed your army!}}
:''Huffing at the interruption, Sylvanas rolls her eyes.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Muzzle your dog, Your Majesty.}}
:''Genn snarls in anger, but Anduin raises an arm to hold him back.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Sylvanas Windrunner, you have led the Horde to a place without honor. Lordaeron is ours. It's over.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Your father would be so proud. Is that... his?}}
:''Sylvanas points at the blade of Shalamayne, splashed with blood.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|You've gotten it all bloody.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Only one of us wanted this war.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|You call for peace when it suits you, little lion, but you're quick enough to kill.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I should have killed you when last we met.}}
: ''Sylvanas sighs.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|How rude, sister. You're a guest in my home.}}
: ''Stepping forward, Genn responds with barely suppressed rage.''
:{{text|bossemote|Genn Greymane|Your home? You desecrate that throne with your filth!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Enough!}}
: ''Snapping at Genn, Anduin slams the tip of Shalamayne's blade against the floor with a resounding clang. Genn shifts his posture back to a standing position. Anduin turns back to the Warchief.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|You put the torch to Teldrassil. But I failed those who burned. I will not make that mistake again. Surrender... or die.}}
:''Jaina looks away briefly while Anduin talks about his failure. Sylvanas rises from Terenas' throne and approaches the Alliance leaders; Genn snarls in anticipation for an attack while Alleria nocks an arrow and holds it steady at full draw, the two spreading out from Anduin to form a triangle with Jaina, surrounding him and Sylvanas as she stops face-to-face with him. Alleria glances up to the left as she hears a sound in the distance and what appears to be torchlight passing by behind one of the balconies, but quickly turns her attention back to her sister.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|You've won... nothing.}}
:''Sylvanas becomes enveloped in shadows and lets out a banshee scream, knocking down her opponents and detonating barrels of Blight hidden in the balconies around the throne room before smashing through the ceiling of the dome. Anduin and the others move towards the door as the masonry collapses in front of them, blocking their exit.''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Hold on!}}
:''Jaina quickly conjures an arcane shield to protect the four leaders, then channels a teleportation spell, taking her, Anduin, Genn, and Alleria to the deck of her ship. As the teleport fades, Anduin runs to the railing with Genn following and looks down as the blight spreads throughout the entire city, then at a Horde gunship fleeing westwards back to Orgrimmar, staring angrily at Sylvanas and the other Horde leaders as they escape.''

===Finale===
Scenario completed, players will appear at the [[Stormwind Harbor]] in a med tent. Halford Wyrmbane is nearby.

Upon completion of the quest, [[Tirisfal Glades]] changes phase to the one that appears in the scenario. Brill has been shattered and the [[Lion's Wake]] runs to the [[North Coast]].

[[Zidormi]] is nearby and can changes phases if necessary.
