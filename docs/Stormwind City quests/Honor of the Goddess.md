'''Honor of the Goddess''' concludes the night elf heritage questline.

==Objectives==
Learn the meaning of [[Ama'shan]] from [[Maiev Shadowsong]].

==Description==
Today is a day of celebration, <name>. And a day of new beginnings.

[[Arko'narin]] and [[Lysander Starshade|Lysander]] have reminded me that the [[kaldorei]] are no strangers to change. I forget, sometimes, how long I was away, and just how much my kin have progressed in my absence.

<Maiev looks up to the sky.>

Lysander celebrates this day, but your service also deserves to be recognized. Come, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*[[Ensemble: Kaldorei Protector's Adornment]]
*[[Traditionalist's Kaldorei Blades]]
*{{title|Ama'shan %s}} title (hidden reward)

==Completion==
Hold your head high, Ama'shan <name>.

May your deeds continue to inspire the kaldorei.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Champion... despite all we have been through, your devotion to your people has never wavered.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|You carry the honor of the goddess with you, and you should carry the name as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Ama'shan <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|May [[Elune]] guide you--and may your path continue to inspire us all.}}

[[Tyrande Whisperwind]] later sends a mail:
{{Book|Upholding Our Ideals|content=
<Name>,

Maiev told me of her mission's success--and your aid.

Never forget, you are more than a defender. Your presence serves as an inspiration to those around you, bringing our people together. It is this that marks you as the most honored of Elune. And it is for this that you will always be treasured.

Maiev is right. We cannot stand forever in the traditions of old. We must continue to evolve, as the world evolves around us.

To that end, she recommended Lysander as a potential recruit for the [[Sentinels]]. I am reaching out to him to offer the position myself. If our Warden sees such promise in him, he must be someone special.

After all, she saw the same promise in you.

Rest well, Ama'shan.
