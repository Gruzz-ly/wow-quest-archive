==Objectives==
Go to the Larson Clothiers in the Stormwind Mage Quarter, and give [[Thurman Schneider]] his Sewing Kit.
*[[Thurman's Sewing Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
My son Thurman is an apprentice at the [[Larson Clothiers]], in the [[Mage Quarter|Mage's Quarter]]. He was in a hurry today and forgot his shears and needles. I know a great <Class> like you must have important tasks at hand, but without his tools Thurman can't do his apprentice work!

Please, <name>. Can you take my son's sewing kit to him? Larson Clothiers is one of two clothing shops in the Mage's Quarter - it's the one deeper in, near the Mage's Tower.

==Progress==
Are you here to buy clothes?

==Completion==
Oh, blast!  I thought forgetting my kit would free me from work.  Now I guess I'll have to help the Larsons with their sewing...

Oh, well.  Fun will come later I guess.
