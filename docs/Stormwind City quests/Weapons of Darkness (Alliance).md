==Objectives==
Capture 5 Elemental-Imbued Weapons from [[Anvilrage]] [[Dark Iron dwarf|dwarves]] in [[Blackrock Depths]], then break them over the [[Black Anvil]] in [[Shadowforge City]].
*[[Elemental-Imbued Weapon]] broken (5)

==Description==
Blackrock Depths has long been home to our enemies, but now [[SI:7]] sends word that the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] and [[Twilight's Hammer]] are increasing their collaboration. Using the knowledge of the cult, the Dark Iron dwarves are imbuing their weapons with [[elemental]] powers. They've outfitted the Anvilrage legion with these fearsome new weapons.

I want you to go into Blackrock Depths and gather the weapons from the Anvilrage dwarves there and break them over the Black Anvil in the heart of Shadowforge City.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:

* +350 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
