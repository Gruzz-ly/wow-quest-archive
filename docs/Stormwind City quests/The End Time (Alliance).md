== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Nozdormu]] at the [[End Time]].

== Description ==
Nozdormu, the bronze aspect, has asked for help from the champions of the Alliance.  You are on his short list.  I can share few other details.

It is uncharacteristic of my master to request the assistance of mortals, but I suppose that all things change with time... even the Aspect of Time himself.

He awaits you at the End Time, in the distant future.  I can help you to travel there, if you so choose.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|65|50}}
* 6,940 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
<Name>, you have arrived.  This is good.  I apologize for bringing you to this strange place, and under such suspicious circumstances.

I have a good reason for doing so.

We are going to kill Deathwing. And I require your aid. 

==Notes==
;Coridormi's gossip
Ahh! There you are, <name>.

I must speak with you at once.

{{Gossip|I am ready to meet Nozdormu at the End Time.}}

;Nozdormu's gossip
We must not waste time, traveler.
