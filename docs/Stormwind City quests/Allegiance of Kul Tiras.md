==Objectives==
Sail to [[Stormwind Harbor]] and present [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] with his gift.
*[[Captain's Helm|Sail]] to Stormwind Harbor

==Description==
It is time for her maiden voyage, <name>.

This [[Anduin's vessel|aptly named vessel]] will carry us and her crew across the vast seat to Stormwind Harbor. There we will meet Anduin and I will seal the pact we made so many moons ago.

[[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] will stand with the [[Alliance]] so long as I am [[Lord Admiral]].

Thank you for your assistance in this endeavor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* [[Kul Tiran Charger]]
* [[Allied Races: Kul Tiran]]
*[[Admiral's Bed]]

==Completion==
I accept this gesture in the spirit in which it was made, <name>.

The Kul Tirans have been valuable allies, and now we have a physical manifestation of that bond.

I thank you for your continued support of the Alliance. We continue to grow with your aid.

==Notes==
On speaking to [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] before setting sail:
:[[Tandred Proudmoore|Tandred]] will guide her to [[Stormwind Harbor]], but I believe it appropriate for [[adventurer|you]] to send us on our way. Place your hands upon the helm when you are ready.

In Stormwind Harbor, [[Velen|Prophet Velen]], [[Malfurion Stormrage]], [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], [[Aysa Cloudsinger]], [[Magister Umbric]], [[Mathias Shaw|Master Mathias Shaw]], [[Genn Greymane]], [[Falstad Wildhammer]], [[Muradin Bronzebeard]], [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Turalyon|High Exarch Turalyon]], and [[Captain Fareeya]] are gathered on the main deck behind [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] (with the [[Battle of Dazar'alor|notable exception]] of [[Gelbin Mekkatorque]]).

On approaching Jaina and Anduin after arriving in Stormwind:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|When you asked to meet me at the harbor, I had no idea what you had in mind. This is incredible!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|[[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] and the [[Alliance]] once shared a bond of friendship. Now both of our peoples will see that bond reforged.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I can think of no grander gesture, [[Lord Admiral]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|What is her name?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|<Ship's name>.}}
:''(Anduin's response varies depending on the ship's name.)''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It certainly sends a powerful message. May her enemies give her a wide berth.}} ''(Anduin's Wrath)''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|And into the dawn she will sail.}} ''(Dawnsailor)''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Oh... Jaina.}} ''(Tiffin's Melody)''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|May she be as steadfast as [[Varian Wrynn|my father]].}} ''(The Lionheart)''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|She is yours to command, as is her crew. They will serve you on behalf of Kul Tiras.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Thank you. I welcome all of you to the Alliance.}}
