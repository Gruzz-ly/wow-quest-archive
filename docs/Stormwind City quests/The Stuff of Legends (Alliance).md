It is an honor to make your acquaintance, <race>.

Behold! Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest.

''On complete'':
:Tarecgosa whispers "I am with you, always" in a voiceover.

== Notes ==
Speak with Hallegosa again:
{{Dialogue|
Your deeds shall live on forever in the memories of every blue dragon, <name>.

{{gossip|I am ready to take part in the ceremony, Hallegosa.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Hallegosa|This way, <name>. The ceremony is about to begin.}}
:''Hallegosa moves 20 yards to the northwest and summons a [[Dragon Disc]] that can be hopped on.''
:{{text|say|Hallegosa|Stand on this disc, <name>. Kalecgos approaches!}}

''The spellcaster hops on a disk that hovers up in the sky, just 35 meters above the ground. A quartet of Blue Dragons surround the player, anxious for the ceremony. Kalecgos himself arrives.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Welcome, friend. We've been expecting you.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|You're to be congruatulated for your success in the [[Firelands]].}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|But praise alone won't suffice.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|[[Blue Dragonflight|We]] owe you a great deal for the part you've played in the destiny of our flight.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Present me [[Runestaff of Nordrassil|your staff]] that we may endow it with great power.}}
''The player grabs the Runestaff from his/her back and presents it to the dragons. They empower the runestaff with their magic powers.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Finally. [[Tarecgosa]], our beloved sister whose essence you've generously born, has chosen [[Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest|this staff]] as her permanent home.}}
''Tarecgosa moves over to the staff and dives in, thus completing it.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|May her presence be a source of comfort and companionship to you.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|We thank you, Friend of the Blue Dragonflight.}}
''The ceremony is complete. An image of the player sitting on Tarecgosa's shoulders is seen.''

Interacting with the floating [[Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest]]
{{Dialogue|
<The staff pulsates with arcane energies.>
}}

Interacting with the Blue Drakes flying around the city
{{Dialogue|
Yes, mortal?

{{gossip|What occasion brings you to our home town, drake?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Kalecgos has been chosen as the new aspect for the blue dragonflight.

One among you was instrumental in thwarting Arygos's betrayal to Deathwing, thereby averting a terrible crisis.

We are here to partake in the celebration of their heroic deeds.

* NOTE: Likely due to the removal of many original skeletons and skins, the player will NOT be seen on Tarecgosa.
