==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 bundles of Moontouched Wood, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
* [[Commander's Holy Symbol]]
* [[Moontouched Wood]] (5)
* [[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
The [[Light]] truly shines in you and your dedication to the [[Alliance]], <name>. You serve as an example to your fellow [[priest]]s and comrades in arms.

In recognition of your deeds, [[House of Wrynn|King Wrynn]] has commissioned the royal enchanter to create a special staff.

The materials for such a weapon can only be found in the cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]]. Travel there and find the lost holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moontouched wood, and ghostly essence from the spirits haunting the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Staff of the Hallowed]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
I can't believe you managed to get all those materials. I wouldn't think of venturing into Shadowfang Keep! The stories about that place are horrific.

Enough of that, though. This is a time to recognize your achievements, not prattle on about my silly fears.

==Notes==
*[[Night elf (playable)|Night elves]] get a slightly different quest instead, listed below.
*[[Gnome (playable)|gnomes]] are also offered this quest, while being offered their own quest. Only one can be accepted
