==Objectives==
Recover 6 Elemental Binding Stones from [[Blackrock Depths]]. You can find the stones in [[Shadowforge City]], the [[Domicile]], the [[Shrine of Thaurissan]], the [[East Garrison]], and the [[West Garrison]].
*[[Elemental Binding Stone]] (6)

==Description==
I have it on good authority that [[SI:7]] is concerned about collaboration between [[Twilight's Hammer]] and the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] in Blackrock Depths. We can act on this information, prove our value to the [[Alliance]], and gain something for ourselves at the same time.

The report mentions that the Twilight's Hammer followers have placed a number of [[elemental]] binding stones throughout Shadowforge City, the Domicile, the Shrine of Thaurissan, the West Garrison and the East Garrison. Find and capture those stones!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Horns of Justified Sins]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to find those binding stones?

==Completion==
The binding stones you brought back are exceedingly powerful. It will likely take me years to learn all their secrets, but I'm certain they'll prove most useful. Thank you, <name>.

==Progression==
#[[Meet with Evelyn Thorn]] (optional)
#[[Stones of Binding (Blackrock Depths) (Alliance)]]
