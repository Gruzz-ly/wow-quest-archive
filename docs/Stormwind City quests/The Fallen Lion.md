==Objectives==
Deliver King Varian's letter to King Anduin.

* Ride a gryphon to [[Stormwind Keep]] (optional)
* Deliver Varian's letter and listen to [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]]
* [[Letter to Anduin]] (provided)

==Description==
I haven't left the deck of [[The Skyfire|this ship]] since we got back. The fleet must be made ready for war. Don't know where we will be needed, but when the call comes, we'll be ready.

Truth be told... I welcome the distraction. The others are paying their respects to [[Varian Wrynn|Varian]], but I... I cannot bring myself to face that casket. To face his son.

Varian gave me a letter he wrote to Anduin. Please, take it to him on my behalf.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|30}}
* 7,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Welcome, <name>.  I am pleased you survived the battle.  You have something for me?

==Completion==
<Anduin sighs and reads the letter from his father. Tears well in his eyes. He is silent for several moments.>

Thank you for bringing this to me, <name>, it means... more than I can say. I wish Greymane felt he could present it himself, but his mind is fixed on revenge.

I cannot blame him... or Jaina, for that matter, but we must find a better way.

Enough of such talk. It is good you are here. We will need heroes like you in the many battles to come.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
:{{text|say|[[Genn Greymane]]|[[Tess Greymane|Tess]] and [[Lorna Crowley|Commander Crowley]] will escort you to the [[Stormwind Keep|Keep]]. I need to stay and oversee preparations.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|When you deliver the letter, please give Prin... King Anduin my condolences.}}

:War rages in my heart, <name>. We will have vengeance... for [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneas]], and for the [[Alliance]]!

''{{gossip|Why not deliver the letter yourself, Lord Greymane?}}''

:I've seen enough suffering for a lifetime, <name>. I don't need another funeral. I need to bring justice to the enemies of Gilneas!
;Ride the gryphon
:{{text|say|Princess Tess Greymane|I've seen my father angry before, but never like this. He is consumed by his lust for vengeance.}}
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|All Gilneans have a rage inside us, Tess.  Your father more than most.}}
:{{text|say|Princess Tess Greymane|Indeed.  It's sometimes hard to know where the rage ends and the man begins.}}
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|[[Darius Crowley|My father]] stands with the king.  The [[Forsaken]] will never see our forces coming!}}
:{{text|say|Princess Tess Greymane|I fear there will soon be more funerals.}}
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|Such is the cost of vengeance. Gilneas has waited for it long enough.}}
:{{text|say|Princess Tess Greymane|We're almost at the keep. Please tell King Anduin he's in our thoughts, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|Quickly, Tess! The gunship will be ready to leave  soon!}}
:''The two fly through the archway and wheel away over the courtyard back towards the ''[[The Skyfire|Skyfire]]'', while the [[adventurer]] lands in front of the drawbridge of Stormwind Keep. A steady stream of [[Weary-Eyed Mourner]]s come and go from the place to pay their respects, while others remain and quietly congregate in small groups.''
;Approach the throne room
[[File:The Fallen Lion room overview.jpg|thumb|300px|The Alliance leaders mourn the death of Varian.]]
:{{text|say|[[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]|King Anduin, the hero of the [[Broken Shore]] approaches.}}
:{{text|say|[[Anduin Wrynn]]|At last, some good news on this day of sorrow.}}
:{{text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|His valor inspired us all, even in death. His spirit will be with us, always.}}
: ''Muradin cries.''
:{{text|say|[[Muradin Bronzebeard]]|I can't believe he's really gone.}}
:{{text|say|[[Falstad Wildhammer]]|He died with honor, protecting his people. He was a true king.}}

;Interact with the Alliance leaders
:Falstad Wildhammer
::Listen... can you hear it? The skies weep and thunder for King Varian.
:[[Moira Thaurissan]]
::I know what the lad is going through.  I too have lost a [[Magni Bronzebeard|father]]... and a king.
:Muradin Bronzebeard
::<sobbing> Varian... Old friend...
:Prophet Velen
::The [[Light]] has lost a powerful ally. I have lost a good friend. Yet we must carry on.
:[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]
::He led with grace and courage. We were fortunate to have an ally like King Varian.
:[[Malfurion Stormrage]]
::We have lost, and now must find balance, despite our shared grief.
:[[Gelbin Mekkatorque]]
::I'm proud to have fought beside him. Varian was a good man.
:[[Aysa Cloudsinger]]
::King Varian overcame so many trials. We should all learn from his example.

;Speak with Anduin
:Welcome back to Stormwind, <name>. I'm relieved you survived the Broken Shore.

:We could not afford to lose you!

:''The leaders of the Alliance congregate in front of the throne of Stormwind.  Muradin comes up instead of all three for the [[Council of Three Hammers]].''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|My father was a seasoned strategist, yet his army was shattered on the Broken Shore. How can I hope to succeed where he failed?}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|You are not alone in this, My King. We stand behind you.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|And with the return of the [[Illidari]], we have a valuable weapon on our side. You were wise to accept them into Stormwind, King Anduin.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Have you forgotten the [[Horde]]'s treachery? It's time to bring them to heel like the dogs they are!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|To fight two wars at once would be folly. For all our sakes, we need the Horde's strength added to our own.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Velen is right. We must stand beside the [[demon hunter]]s and focus on the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. Now is not the time to--}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The Horde betrayed your father and left us to die! To fight alongside those cowards would dishonor everything he stood for.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|My people know the price of facing demons as a world divided. It is time to unite our forces and defend our lands.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Agreed. I'm sorry, Jaina, but vengeance must wait. I trust you're mobilizing the [[Kirin Tor]] as we discussed?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|[[Dalaran]] will help protect the [[Eastern Kingdoms]], but I will NOT allow the Horde to set foot within my city!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We must not splinter like this... not now. Please, Jaina!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You disappoint me, King of Stormwind. But sooner or later, you will see the truth. You all will!}}
:''Jaina teleports away.  The other leaders return to their places around the casket.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|My father dead... disaster on the Broken Shore... Jaina fixed on revenge... Everything is falling apart.}}

''Complete:''
:''[[Jace Darkweaver]] runs in from the war room and stands at the foot of the dais.  Malfurion and Tyrande turn to look at him.''
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Having the [[Illidari]] among us makes me uneasy. Their kind has been locked away since my [[Illidan Stormrage#Master of the Black Temple|brother's fall]].}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I understand, husband. But for [[Maiev Shadowsong|Maiev]] to release them, the situation must be even more dire than we know.}}
: ''They both turn back to the casket.''
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|I bring urgent news, My King. Danger is all around you!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I will hear what this [[demon hunter]] has to say.}}
