:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Champion! An urgent War Council is underway. Your presence is requested in Stormwind Keep.}}

The war council happens in the [[Petitioner's Chamber]] within [[Stormwind Keep]]. King Anduin, [[Genn Greymane]], [[Master Mathias Shaw]], [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], and a [[7th Legion Sailor]] surround the war table. [[Commander Lorna Crowley]] and a group of [[Greyguard]]s are also present, standing behind Genn; and two [[Lion's Guard]]s are posted at the doorway.

As you enter the room, the council begins:
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Everyone is here. What news do you bring, Spymaster?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Recently, Horde agents [[The Stormwind Extraction|broke into the Stockades and freed two Zandalari prisoners]].}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|[[Princess Talanji|A princess]]. And [[Zul the Prophet|a prophet]].}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'm aware. What of the eight warships we sent in pursuit?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Only one returned.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Survivors say they encountered strange and terrifying magics.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|And a massive Zandalari fleet.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Impossible! It's one of Sylvanas's tricks. It has to be...}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Jaina, perhaps you could help us see what this survivor has witnessed.}}
:''Jaina walks around the table toward the sailor.''
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It's a simple enough spell, provided the subject is cooperative.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Show us... show us what happened...}}

Jaina casts a spell on the sailor, and a Vision of Sailor's Memory appears. Interact with it to play a brief [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|cinematic]]:

{{#ev:youtube|Dtf9CFySnak|Vision of Sailor's Memory}}

The cinematic shows a massive Zandalari fleet launching a volley against the eight Alliance ships. All but one are immediately sunk.

After the cinematic:
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|If the Horde makes allies of the Zandalari, we won't have the power to stop them.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Then we must make allies of our own.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|My people command the most powerful navy in all of Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|If I could bring [[Kul Tiras]] back into the Alliance...}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Jaina, you're [[Invasion of Durotar#Admiral's fall|the reason they left the Alliance]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|And dealing with that is the only hope we have of bringing them back.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I believe it is... and I believe you can.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It will be difficult... and dangerous.}}
: ''Jaina curtsies as she speaks.''
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will return with the fleet... or not at all.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Be careful, Jaina. Light be with you.}}
