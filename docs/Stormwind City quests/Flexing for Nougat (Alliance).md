Completing this quest gains you an item required to complete [[Hallow's End Treats for Jesper!]]

==Objectives==
Do a flex emote at [[Innkeeper Allison]], and in exchange you'll receive [[:Stormwind Nougat]]!
*Flex for Innkeeper Allison

==Description==
That's an... interesting costume you have on.  Even though you're being nice and helping a child trick-or-treat this year, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to perform a trick for me!

Let's see... you look so strong and buff in that... costume... let's see you flex!  Yes, go on now and flex for me, strong <man/woman>!

When and only when you flex, I'll give you some tasty Stormwind Nougat. It's a great Hallow's End treat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Stormwind Nougat]]

==Progress==
No candy until you flex for me, <name>...

==Completion==
You are truly mighty, haha! &nbsp;Well done, and thanks for being such a good sport. &nbsp;Here's your candy.

Happy Hallow's End, <name>!

==Notes==
