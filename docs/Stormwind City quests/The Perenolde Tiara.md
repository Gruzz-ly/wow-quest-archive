==Description==
The Perenolde Tiara is an old heirloom of the [[Perenolde family|Perenolde]] "nobles" - the ruling family of [[Alterac (kingdom)|Alterac]] before that kingdom fell to ruin. It is said to have been crafted by master jewelers in [[Ironforge]], and fitted with the finest of emeralds.

When Alterac was destroyed the Tiara was lost, but there are rumors that an [[Ogre mage|Ogre Mage]], [[Grel'borg the Miser]], found the tiara and now wanders the [[Ruins of Alterac]] searching for more treasures.

We would have you acquire the tiara for us. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|50|}}
*6550 [[XP]] (or {{cost||39}} at 70)
*500 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Salutations, <name>. Do try to avoid stepping on my pant cuffs. This outfit is newly tailored. 

==Completion==
Ah, this is splendid. This will have to be cleaned of course, but you really outdid yourself, <name>. I will have someone prepare the tiara and place it within our collection posthaste.

As I'm sure you will agree, our gratitude is as grand as our collection.
