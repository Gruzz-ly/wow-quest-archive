==Objectives==
Disperse 6 Suspicious Citizens in [[Stormwind]].
* [[Suspicious Citizen]]s dispersed (6)

==Description==
Apocalyptic threats have taken many forms in [[Azeroth]]'s history, but today we face [[Xal'atath]] and her [[Twilight's Blade]].

I fear that people are falling into hopelessness as the [[Radiant Song]] cries a warning. The Twilight's Blade could use that despair to draw them into their ranks.

My mages have identified this district as housing a peculiard amount of void energy. Investigate and stop any cultists you may find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|30|98}}
* 1400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There are Twilight's Blade in the city. If they are here, they are certainly recruiting elsewhere.

We have more work to do.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|Please be discreet. Not everyone who seems suspicious or who practices void magic is necessarily a danger.}}

Speak with the [[Suspicious Citizen]]s in the area:
{{Dialogue|
Do you crave power, <class>? Power that maintains as time moves forward, always surpassing your enemies.

It exists. I can show you.

Have you heard the Radiant Song? Does it fill you with dread?

There may be a way to quiet it for good.

The end is coming. It's always approaching. What will you do when it finally arrives?

{{Dialogue|
This world doesn't deserve you, <class>. How often do you run to its rescue?

We value you. We know what you could be with the right help.
}}

{{Dialogue|
You seek peace. Quiet. Rest.

I know where you can find all that and more.

There's always another struggle on Azeroth. What if you could leave it all behind?

What if you could become something more?

{{Dialogue|
Many terrible threats have come against this world. Don't you want it to all stop? To rest?
