==Objectives==
Take the Head of Onyxia to [[Zardeth of the Black Claw]] in the basement of [[The Slaughtered Lamb]] in [[Stormwind]]. 
* [[Head of Onyxia]] (Provided)

==Description==
You have accomplished the truly impossible. The brood mother of the [[Black Dragonflight]] lies dead at your feet. Seize her head and deliver it to Zardeth of the Black Claw. 

==Reward==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Polished Dragonslayer's Signet|Sparkling Onyxia Tooth Pendant|Purified Onyxia Blood Talisman}}

==Progress==
By [[Nozdormu]]'s Teeth!

==  Completion ==
What? How did you get this? Isn't she... Never mind the details, I suppose. You'll be wanting one of these baubles as recompense, no doubt.

== Notes ==
The reason that this quest doesn't turn in at King Varian Wrynn (or Bolvar Fordragon in earlier versions of WoW) and does not give a city-wide buff as it did in the level 60 version is because in [[Patch 3.2.2]] Onyxia is '''officially dead according to Warcraft lore'''.  Though players still have the ability to kill Onyxia as a boss, in Warcraft lore she was killed by a party led by [[Varian Wrynn]], [[Broll Bearmantle]], [[Valeera Sanguinar]] and [[Thargas Anvilmar]].  This would also explain why the quest name has changed to "A Most Puzzling Circumstance" and why Zardeth shows such surprise upon seeing the head of Onyxia.

Blizzard put in a number of rather subtle "jokes" into the quest such as stating in the quest text that "You have accomplished the truly impossible," referencing of course that although Onyxia is still a level 80 raid boss, she is officially dead according to lore.
