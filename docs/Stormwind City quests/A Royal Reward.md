==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Springvale's Sharpening Stone from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 crates of Moonsteel Ingots, and 5 Deathless Sinew.
*[[Springvale's Sharpening Stone]]
*[[Moonsteel Ingots]] (5)
*[[Deathless Sinew]] (5)

==Description==
[[SI:7]] has been watching your progress with interest. You{{Sic}} service to the [[Alliance]] is well-known and tales of your deeds have reached the [[Varian Wrynn|king's]] ears.

In recognition of your service, King Wrynn has commissioned the royal armorer to forge a special weapon.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is home to the exotic materials for your weapon. Travel there and recover Commander Springvale's sharpening stone, a supply of moonsteel ingots, and sinew from the [[ghoul]]s and [[geist]]s infesting the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[SI:7 Special Issue Dagger]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
It was quite an honor to receive the commission for your weapon, <name>. When [[Lord Tony Romano|Tony]] mentioned using so many exotic materials, I had my doubts, but it seems you managed to find them all. This will be a fine reward for all you've done for the Alliance.
