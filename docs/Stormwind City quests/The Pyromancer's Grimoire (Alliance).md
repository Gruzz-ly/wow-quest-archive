==Objectives==
Kill 6 Twilight Emissaries and recover Loregrain's Grimoire from [[Pyromancer Loregrain]] at the [[Shrine of Thaurissan]] in [[Blackrock Depths]].
*[[Twilight Emissary]] slain (6)
*[[Loregrain's Grimoire]]

==Description==
The power of the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron forces]] and their [[Twilight's Hammer]] allies is growing within [[Blackrock Mountain]]. Pyromancer Loregrain, a [[Mage|magus]] of renown, plays an important role in leading the Twilight's Hammer forces there. If we could get our hands on his grimoire, I might be able to devise counterspells and other ways of dampening their [[elemental]] [[magic]]s.

You must descend into Blackrock Depths, locate the Shrine of Thaurissan, and capture the grimoire. Show Loregrain and his Twilight minions no mercy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Hood of the Royal Wizard]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to capture the pyromancer's grimoire?

==Completion==
<The mage trainer pages through the grimoire quickly.>

I've already seen a dozen spells I never knew existed. This will be most helpful, <name>.

==Progression==
#[[Meet with Frazzle Frostfingers]] (optional)
#[[The Pyromancer's Grimoire (Alliance)]]
