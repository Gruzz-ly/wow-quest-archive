Bring 6 Mithril Tubes, an Accurate Scope, and 2 Advanced Target Dummies to an engineering trainer in any capital city.
* [[Advanced Target Dummy]] (2)
* [[Accurate Scope]]
* [[Mithril Tube]] (6)

==Description==
A skilled engineer can choose ONE specialization, and I can teach you the ways of gnomish engineering.

You look like you know what you're doing, but I'll need some samples of your work. Bring me six mithril tubes, an accurate scope, and two advanced target dummies.

Submit these items to an engineering trainer in any of the capital cities and you'll be an official gnomish engineer with access to all the schematics!

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Gnomish Engineering]]

==Progress==
Once I receive your crafted engineering items for my review, you can become a certified gnomish engineer, granting you unlimited access to gnomish engineer schematics.

==Completion==
Today is the day you become a real engineer, <name>. Don't worry about all those messy bombs and explosives, because it's time to shine!
