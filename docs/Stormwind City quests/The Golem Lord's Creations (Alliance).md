==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Elemental Modules from the [[golem]]s in the [[Manufactory]] of [[Blackrock Depths]] and recover the Elemental Golem Blueprints.
*[[Elemental Module]] (5)
*[[Elemental Golem Blueprints]]

==Description==
The latest [[SI:7]] intelligence on Blackrock Depths is troubling, <name>. It appears [[Twilight's Hammer]] is working with the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron]] [[engineer]], [[Golem Lord Argelmach|Argelmach]], to create [[war golem]]s powered by [[elemental]]s. These golems could prove to be a devastating weapon if used against us.

You must prevent that from happening, <name>. Find the Manufactory in Blackrock Depths, capture the blueprints he's using to make those golems, and recover the elemental modules he's using to power them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Helm of the Crown]]

==Progress==
We cannot afford to allow those golems to be used against us.

==Completion==
I know a couple of engineers who will want to take a look at those plans. They won't be using these golems anytime soon. Good work, <name>.

==Progression==
#[[Meet with Dalgrun Steelpine]] (optional)
#[[The Golem Lord's Creations (Alliance)]]
