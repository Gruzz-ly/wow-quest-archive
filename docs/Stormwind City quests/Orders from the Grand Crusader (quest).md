==Objectives==
Bring the Orders from the Grand Crusader back to Katherine the Pure.
*Report back to [[Katherine the Pure]]
*[[Orders from the Grand Crusader]] (provided)

==Description==
This appears to be orders from the Grand Crusader of the [[Scarlet Crusade]] himself, [[Saidan Dathrohan|Dathrohan]]. It seems that [[Aeonas]] has run afoul of the [[Scarlet Crusade|Crusade]]. Judging by the scene before you, it appears that the Crusade was able to follow Aeonas here and apprehend him. It appears that he did not go down without a fight.

The charges levied against Aeonas are grave, but that would explain some of the scene you came upon in {{C|Desolace}}.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you bring word of Aeonas?

==Completion==
<Katherine frowns deeply as she reads the letter>

Aeonas held some radical views by the time he left the order, but I find it very hard to believe that his business in Desolace involved consorting with [[demon]]s, [[undead]], or anything of the sort. We need to find him and hear his side of this. There's more to this, I'm certain of it.

==Progression==
