==Objectives==
Take your [[Human Orphan]] to the Stormwind Embassy. If your orphan is not present when you arrive, call for him.
*Visit the [[Stormwind Embassy]] with your orphan {{co|53.6|15.6|Stormwind City}}
*[[Human Orphan Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
I heard that the [[Alliance]] is growing! More and more different kinds of people are joining all the time to fight the mean [[Horde]].

I'm not sure where the embassy is, but I heard it's somewhere here in Stormwind. Can you show me how to get there? I want to see all our new friends!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I bet all of our new friends came from really far away!

==Completion==
We have so many new friends in the city now! I hope they'll play with me!
