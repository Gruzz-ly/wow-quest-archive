==Objectives==
Collect 14 Summoner's Salt from [[Blackrock Summoner]]s in {{C|Redridge Mountains}}, then return to [[Ursula Deline]] in [[Stormwind]].
*[[Summoner's Salt]] (14)

==Description==
I will study the orb and tell you what I learn, but you must first do something for me.

The [[warlock]]s of the [[Blackrock clan]] use specially prepared salts to enhance their summoning rituals. Collect some from the [[orc]]s in Redridge.

When you return, I will share with you the results of my studies.

==Progress==
<The warlock is studying the orb intently>

==Completion==
Ah... the salts. I had forgotten all about them.

This orb is unlike anything I have seen, <name>.

==Notes==
Though the quest specifies Blackrock Summoners, the salt can drop from any Blackrock orc in the zone.

==Progression==
