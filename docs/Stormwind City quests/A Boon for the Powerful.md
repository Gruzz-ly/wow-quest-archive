*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
[[Varian Wrynn|The king]] is finally beginning to take note of our power and our value to the [[Alliance]], thanks to your deeds. Perhaps they are beginning to accept our kind.

King Wrynn has commissioned the royal enchanter to create a powerful weapon in recognition of your achievements.

The materials you will need come from [[Silverpine Forest]]'s Shadowfang Keep. Travel there and obtain the tenebrous orb held by [[Lord Godfrey]], the Book of Lost Souls, and the essence of the [[ghost]]s haunting the castle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Staff of Justified Sins]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
I won't ask what you had to do to come by such rare and powerful materials, but I'm glad to have the chance to work with them. Your weapon will be magnificent!

==Notes==
All of the items are found within Shadowfang keep. The orb will drop off the end boss, Lord Godfrey, the book can be found near the exit of Lord Walden's room and the ghosts you need to kill for their souls are found in the second boss's room.
