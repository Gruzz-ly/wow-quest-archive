==Objectives==
Speak with Wrathion to learn of the Council's meeting.
*Speak with [[Wrathion]]

==Description==
Ah, <name>. Impeccable timing!

I just met with [[Turalyon|Lord Commander Turalyon]] and his allies, and they have accepted the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]]' invitation to the [[Dragon Isles]].

You will be coming along, of course? It wouldn't be the same without you!

I imagine you have noticed some unfamiliar faces gathered here. The ones with the wings are called [[dracthyr]]. They have only known me a short time, but they are already great admirers.

Ah, but where are my manners? We should have a chat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,150 [[XP]]
*{{Cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
I cannot wait to see the Dragon Isles with you, <name>!

Now then, I believe that [[Toddy Whiskers|diminutive ally]] of yours said something about putting together an expedition.

==Notes==
During the [[Tempest Unleashed]] event, this quest was available at level 10.

;Speaking with Wrathion
:Ah, there you are, <name>. Impeccable timing!

:I briefed Lord Commander Turalyon on recent events, and have extended the Aspects' invitation to the Dragon Isles.

:We just have a few more details to discuss.
