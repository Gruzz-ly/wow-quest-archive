==Notes==
This breadcrumb quest is not a normal part of the quest chain; it exists primarily for characters who completed the previous quests during the [[Tempest Unleashed]] pre-launch event, to remind them that the quest chain can now be continued. However, it will also trigger if you attempt to leave the area after completing [[Whispers on the Winds (Alliance)]] without accepting [[To the Dragon Isles! (Alliance)]]

;Upon accept
