==Objectives==
[[Vin]] wants you to collect 5 [[Windswept Balloon|Windswept Balloons]] from [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].

* [[Windswept Balloon]]: (5)

==Description==
Please, <mister/miss>, you just gotta help me!

Father bought me a bunch of balloons from the [[Darkmoon Faire]].  They're magical, you know, and never lose their floatiness!

There's just one thing...

A gust of wind blew them out of my hands.  They're scattered all over Stormwind!

I'd chase after them myself, but this city's so big I'd get lost for sure.

Can you find them for me before they float away?

Thanks, <mister/miss>!

*1,550 [[XP]]

== Notes ==
* The Windswept Balloons can be found all throughout Stormwind, but seem to be found mostly around trees.
* After the quest is completed, Vin will be lifted off the ground by the balloons and drift slowly upwards, exclaiming as she goes:

**{{text|say|Vin|This is wonderful!}}
**{{text|say|Vin|I can see everything from up here!}}
**{{text|say|Vin|Good bye, <name>!  Thank you!}}
