{{text|say|Darlene Stokx|I must have been pretty tipsy the night I promised you a pony. Take your money and no hard feelings, okay?}}

{{text|say|Darlene Stokx|I can't be held responsible every time someone falls off their mount. I don't know how you got the official seal on this, but take your payment and don't question my horses again!}}

{{text|say|Field Marshal Stonebridge|These documents implicate several troll spies. Consider their heads forfeit. Take your compensation and spend it wisely; it's drawn from the [[tax]]payers of Stormwind.}}

{{text|say|Field Marshal Stonebridge|These documents implicate several orcish spies. Our best assassins will be dispatched for this treachery. Take your compensation and spend it wisely; it's drawn from the taxpayers of Stormwind.}}

{{text|say|Field Marshal Stonebridge|You honor us by delivering this information. It seems as if we've finally found the spy in the city... a homeless man whom we will execute shortly. Take your reward, you've done well!}}

{{text|say|Jelinek Sharpshear|I don't usually give refunds for haircuts, but I must admit I did a terrible job on yours. My apologies.}}

{{text|say|Jelinek Sharpshear|Oh... I think I'm going to be sick. How could I have cut off someone's ear and not have noticed? Please take this money to a healer and have it reattached.}}

{{text|emote|Master Mathias Shaw eyes you suspiciously.}}<br>
{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|I could swear I just paid a fine like this...}}

{{text|emote|Master Mathias Shaw eyes you suspiciously.}}<br>
{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Her bag of gold should be in the mail! It's insulting she sends someone to collect from me while I'm working.}}

{{text|emote|Master Mathias Shaw eyes you suspiciously.}}<br>
{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|This is a dangerous game you play... take your gold for now, but know that I'm watching you.}}

{{text|say|Thomas Miller|I've heard of mice trapped in ale bottles before, but never in bread. P-p-please take everything and don't speak of this to anyone.}}

{{text|say|Thomas Miller|Oh my... someone became ill from my bread? How can this be? Please, I hope my meager earnings are enough to help out.}}
