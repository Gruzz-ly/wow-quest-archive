==Objectives==
Bring the compass to [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin Wrynn]] in [[Stormwind Keep]].
* [[Battered Trinket]] (provided)

==Description==
<The trinket's fine brass exterior is inlaid with intricate filigree, though much of the detail has been battered by rocks and waves. Clearing away the grime and salt encrusting the clasp, you manage to open it. 

It is [[Varian's compass|a compass]]--or was, at least. The glass face is shattered, the needle bent, unmoving. 

Set into the lid is a portrait. The paint is faded and waterlogged, but the subject is unmistakable: the face of a young Anduin Wrynn.>

==Progress==
Well met, <name>. What brings you to Stormwind this day?

==Completion==
<As the king examines the compass, his expression turn from recognition to sorrow.>

When I went through my father's things and didn't find this compass, I assumed it was with him on the Broken Shore when {{Au|Gul'dan}}...

<The king's voice breaks.>

:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I had this compass crafted for my father's birthday. I gave it to him a few months before my ship ran aground on Pandaria. A lifetime ago...}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Since this war with the Legion began, I've barely had a chance to think or breath... or to mourn. Perhaps it is time to change that.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Thank you for bringing my father's compass back to me. It is a reminder of how much I miss him.}}
