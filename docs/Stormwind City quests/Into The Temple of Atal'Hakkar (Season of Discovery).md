==Objectives==
Gather 10 Atal'ai Tablets for [[Brohann Caskbelly]] in [[Stormwind]].
*[[Atal'ai Tablet]] (10)

==Description==
According to legend, The [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar]] is a holy shrine dedicated to the ancient god, [[Hakkar the Soulflayer]]. Maintained by a vicious tribe of trolls named the [[Atal'ai]], the temple is rumored to be impenetrable.

Now sunk beneath the [[Pool of Tears]], retrieving artifacts from the temple is even more difficult. But that's what I need you to do, <name>.

Aid me by gathering the intact Atal'ai Tablets. Bring them to me and I will return to the [[Explorers' Guild]] a hero. Together we will share the glory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Guardian Talisman]]

==Progress==
As dusk slowly descends upon my career I turn to you, <name>, to help me in my final quest for the Explorers' League. If my old bones could muster the strength to brave the [[Swamp of Sorrows]] and the sunken temple I would be fighting right alongside you.

Pride makes it hard for me to ask for your help in collecting the Atal'ai Tablets. But old age forces the necessity.

Please help me, <name>. I want to retire from the Explorers' League having completed their final bidding.

==Completion==
The Atal'ai Tablets! Thank you, <name>!

Once I deliver these to the Explorers' League our names shall go down in history together. You have helped an old dwarf fulfill his final obligation in life. For that I am eternally grateful.

==Notes==
While there are other tablets in the temple, there are two which don't require you to kill any of the elites in the temple. Enter the temple and you'll have to dive under the water. When you emerge, you'll be in a wide hall, "[[The Broken Hall]]". Out of the water, there will be one tablet on the right. There is also one tablet under water. The respawn time on the tablets is about 7.5 minutes, so you can complete the quest in 30 minutes if you just wait for the respawns.
