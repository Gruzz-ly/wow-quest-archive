==Objectives==
Retrieve the Rare Hides.
* [[Rare Hides]]

==Description==
I have a stash of extremely rare leathers, or... rather, I did.

A group of thieves must have heard how valuable my collection was because they stole it!

And THEN they had the audacity to leave a note offering to sell it back to me! As the "former owner", I'm able to "best appreciate the value of their new acquisition."

The note states they'll be waiting in the foothills behind the castle, to the east, until they find another buyer.

However you get the skins, consider them yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How is he holding up?

==Completion==
<You explain what happened in [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].>

Typical [[human]]s. Extorting allies because only their suffering matters.

<[[Daniss Ghostdancer|Daniss]] takes a deep breath to steady herself.>

I am sorry, <name>. I spoke out of frustration.

I'm no stranger to war, but [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]' tactics have made this one exceptionally taxing. I didn't mean to discourage their... resourcefulness. I simply wish it hadn't come to it.

At this time, we must keep our faith in the [[Alliance]].

==Notes==
Fly northeast past [[Stormwind Keep]] and into the portion of [[Elwynn Forest]] that is behind the keep. Keep a lookout for [[Avarice]] and four [[Opportunistic Bandit]]s. There is a chest beside Avarice, but it is locked. You can choose to either pay off the thieves or kill them.

;Avarice
:Good day, friend.

:Could I interest you in a collection of fine leathers?

:Very affordable. It's practically stealing.

:{{Gossip|We don't need to make this violent. I just want to buy the skins.}}
::Ahhh! Now THIS I like! Someone who understands business practices, and is willing to act like a proper <gentleman/lady>.

::I was going to charge more for the hassle, but since you're being so... diplomatic, I'm gracious enough to come down somewhat.

::1,250 gold. If you've got the coin, you get some priceless skins, and we'll be on our merry way.

::What do you say?

::{{Gossip|Sure, I'll buy them.}}
:::''Do you want to purchase Telonis' Rare Hides for: {{cost|1,250}}''

::{{Gossip|That's a rip-off!}}
:::Hmm. Feisty.

:::Look, you seem like a nice <race>, so I'll give you one do-over. Think about your answer carefully.

:::My boys have been looking for a good scrap, and this is not something worth getting yourself killed over.

:::How do you want to do this?

:::{{Gossip|Fine, how much to buy them?}}
::::1,250 Gold.

::::Last chance, <race>. What will it be?

::::Business or a burial?

::::{{Gossip|Sure, I'll buy them.}}
:::::''Do you want to purchase Telonis' Rare Hides for: {{cost|1,250g}}''

::::{{Gossip|"The Hard Way.}}

:::{{Gossip|"The Hard Way".}}

:{{Gossip|Give me the skins or the world has a few less thieves to worry about.}}
