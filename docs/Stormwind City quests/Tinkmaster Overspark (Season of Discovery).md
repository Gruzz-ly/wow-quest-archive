==Description==
Tinkmaster Overspark is very upset with the fate of his mechanical creation, [[Techbot]]. I remember Techbot as a kind and helpful tool for the [[gnome]]s, but Overspark tells me it's malfunctioned.

Very sad. But with luck perhaps he can be fixed!

Speak with Tinkmaster Overspark, in [[Tinker Town]] in Ironforge. He would welcome your help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*320 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles]]

Yes it's true.  Techbot has gone rogue!  Please, can you help me?
