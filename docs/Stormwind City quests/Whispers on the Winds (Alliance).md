==Description==
;Non-dracthyr
:Hello, <name>. It's been a while, and I wish we had more time to catch up.
:But you see, I've just had a rather enlightening... no, make that foreboding... yes, a foreboding conversation with an old friend.
:Sometimes a revelation can be both, after all.
:I really must tell you of what I've learned.
;Dracthyr
:So you are a dracthyr? Fascinating! Yes, I can definitely sense draconic magic combined with the essence of mortal races within you.
:Say, you should come visit Karazhan. I can introduce you to Medivh. I would love to know if he has any knowledge or books about--
:Pardon me. I sometimes get carried away.

:Your reaction is understandable. I dare say I felt the same.

:''In [[Karazhan]], [[Kalecgos]] arrives at the [[Guardian's Library]] where Khadgar is reading.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Khadgar|I did not expect to see you again so soon, my friend. After you'd answer the call of the isles.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Kalecgos|Something has happened, Khadgar. Something Terrible.}}
:''Khadgar closes the book and turns to Kalecgos.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Khadgar|Kalecgos....tell me.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Kalecgos|It happened so quickly. And Wrathion, young as he is...bravely, or perhaps foolishly tried to stop it...}}
:''The sequence shifts to a recap of [[The Prize Inside|Raszageth's escape]] showing [[Wrathion]] unable to stop [[Raszageth]] from being freed.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Kalecgos|but he was too late. The Tempest  had already been unleashed.}}
:''The sequence shifts to another flashback in [[Valdrakken]] where [[Alexstrasza]], [[Nozdormu]], Kalecgos, [[Watcher Koranos]] and Wrathion are gathered.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Wrathion|She let me live with a message. They are coming to cleanse the world of the Titans' Stain.}}
:''Watcher Koranos and Kalecgos are suprised.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Wrathion|Alexstrasza...Who is she? What is she?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alexstrasza|She is Razsageth. The Youngest of the [[Primal Incarnates]].}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Wrathion|Incarnates?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nozdormu|Four dangerous adherents of the Elemental Forces. At the Dawn of the Aspects,  our flights embraced the titans' gifts. They did not.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alexstrasza|[[War of the Scaleborn|The war that followed]] was unimaginable, and it took all of our strength combined to banish them.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Wrathion|If they were so dangerous, why were they not destroyed?!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alexstrasza|I haven't the heart to do it. We were once as clutchmates.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nozdormu|Time, it seems, has not quelled their fury. And look at us. Should she free her kin now, we haven't the strength to stop them. And if [[Iridikron]]'s hunger is unleashed....}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alexstrasza|Then we have no choice. If we are to be protectors once more, the aspects of our Dragonflights must be made anew.}}
:''The sequence shifts back to Kalecgos and Khadgar.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Kalecgos|The Queen is determined too, Khadgar. But we've only just begun to find who we are again. And I fear that without help, we may never get the chance to see our future secured.}}
:''Khadgar puts aways the books and summons [[Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian]]''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Khadgar|Then it seems the mortal races too, must answer the call and face the storms ahead.}}
