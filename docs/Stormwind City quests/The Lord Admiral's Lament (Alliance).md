==Objectives==
Take the Illegible Correspondence to [[Kayla Mills]] in [[Stormwind City]].
* [[Illegible Correspondence]] (provided)

==Description==
The footlocker contains a number of [[Lord Admiral]] [[Daelin Proudmoore]]'s personal effects. Among them is a rolled letter, sealed with sea-green wax and stamped with the [[House Proudmoore|Proudmoore]] crest. The parchment tears easily and requires careful handling and it appears that the ink has been largely washed away by tide and time.

Perhaps someone can restore the letter and reveal its contents.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|21|94|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's this?

==Completion==
I can feel history in this scroll, <name>. If this letter contains what I think it does, it is a sad tale indeed.

Now, let me see...

==Notes==
The [[Warbringers|Warbringers: Jaina]] cinematic plays after turning in the quest.
