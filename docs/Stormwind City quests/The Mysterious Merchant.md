==Description==
Well met again, <name>. [[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] and his [[Spy|spies]] have provided us with information on a mysterious merchant who just arrived in [[Kalimdor]] and is looking to offload a collection of dangerous artifacts. We've come to believe that he has an [[Echoing Orb]] in his collection. He is staying at the Theramore Inn in [[Dustwallow Marsh]]. Travel quickly, retrieve the orb, and speak to no one of this. We are sending you in alone to avoid drawing the attention of our enemies.

Be safe, and go with the [[light]].
