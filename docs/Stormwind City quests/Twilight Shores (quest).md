The time has come, <class>. With [[Stormwind]] secure, we will take [[Elemental Unrest|this fight]] to the enemy. To [[Twilight Highlands|the Highlands]]!

The bulk of our navy has already shipped out, thanks to your work earlier. But Fargo Flintlocke has prepared a [[Flintlocke's Seaplane|seaplane]] that can make the journey in double-time.

Speak with Flintlocke down at the harbor and tell him that you are to accompany him to the Highlands. He will be by the water's edge. Safe journeys, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|45000}} (or {{coppercost|65750}} at max level)

==Completion==
A ride to the Highlands, then? I've just the thing!

I'll make room for yeh in me seaplane. I'll have to ditch the cat-food I was packing, yeh know, in case we crash in the mountains and ain't rescued fer weeks.

On second thought, jes' keep the cat food on yer lap, aye.
