==Objectives==
Look for King [[Anduin Wrynn]] inside [[Cathedral of Light|Stormwind Cathedral]].

==Description==
Anduin hasn't been the same since you brought him [[Varian's compass|his father's compass]]. He has become listless... distracted. 

We attempted to console him, to no avail. Yesterday morning, he left the keep without so much as a word. 

I ordered the guards to follow him, of course. He went to pray at the cathedral, where he's remained ever since. 

You brought this melancholy upon him! You must convince the boy to resume his duties. There's a war to be won!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*12,340 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Let me guess... [[Genn Greymane|Genn]] sent you.

I wonder which he's more concerned about... my well-being, or keeping up the appearance that everything is normal?

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Anduin refuses to eat or sleep. He ignores every plea to return to the palace. Nothing I say seems to offer comfort.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|I understand the need to mourn, but the king's place is on his throne. The Broken Shore must be our focus. Convince Anduin to end his vigil!}}

;Enter cathedral
:{{text|say|[[Royal Guard (human)|Royal Guard]]|King Greymane said you would be coming. Please, go right in.}}
