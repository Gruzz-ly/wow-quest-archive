==Objectives==
{{NPC||Naraat the Earthspeaker}} wants you to look into the Waters of Farseeing.
*Vision of the Farseer Witnessed

==Description==
Greetings, hero of [[Azeroth]].

On behalf of the [[Earthen Ring]] I thank you for answering my call.

You are known to us by name, <name>.

Your exploits and accomplishments are many. Azeroth already stands in your debt, and yet again she is need of her heroes.

I am but a messenger. A familiar presence seeks audience with you.

Peer into the [[Waters of Farseeing]] and behold the fate of our world.

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

==Completion==
Now that your eyes have seen the truth, where will you choose to serve?

== Notes ==
[[File:Waters_of_Farseeing.jpg|thumb|Waters of Farseeing just behind Naraat]]
The Waters of Farseeing are a few feet away from the questgiver.

Clicking the bowl of water transports the player's view to the [[Maelstrom]], where [[Thrall]] is holding control of the chaotic swirl. Thrall also does a voiceover:
:"Citizen of [[Azeroth]], behold. Our world groans in agony, besieged by [[Deathwing|an adversary of unspeakable power]]. As her lands break and crumble, the fractures that divide her people must be mended, for neither side can overcome this threat alone. Join me, cast aside your prejudices.  Together, we must heal Azeroth's wounds, and those of her people."
