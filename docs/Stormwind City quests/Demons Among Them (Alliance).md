==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Having the Illidari among us makes me uneasy. Their kind has been locked away since my brother's fall.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I understand, husband. But for Maiev to release them, the situation must be even more dire than we know.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I will hear what this demon hunter has to say.}}

Speak with Anduin to continue.

;Anduin
:I don't have the time for pleasantries, demon hunter.
:As I told the other [[Illidari]], I have much to contemplate.
:I must prepare our armies to take on the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], even as some of my allies cry out for vengeance against the [[Horde]].
:{{gossip|This cannot wait. There are demons among your ranks. Let me show you.}}

An [[Legion in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|5obkMcHd7bg|urlArgs=start=17&end=41}}<!-- Should be replaced due to profanity outside the embedded section -->
:''The player runs over to a [[Stormwind Royal Guard (NPC)|Stormwind Royal Guard]], brandishing their glaives.''
:{{text|say|<Player>|You cannot hide what you truly are, [[demon]]!}}
:''The Stormwind Royal Guard laughs and removes their disguise, revealing themselves to be a [[Felblade Assassin]].''
:{{text|say|Stormwind Royal Guard|You discovered us too late, Illidari! FELBLADE, ATTACK!}}
:''The camera pans around the throne room as more Fellblade Assassins are unveiled and begin entering.''
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Portals opening! Here they come!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Malfurion Stormrage]]|Demons in the throne room! Protect the king!}}
:{{text|yell|Jace Darkweaver|Shatter their portals! Drive out the Legion!}}
:''The cutscene ends with the Alliance racial leaders and Jace having formed a protective half-circle on the steps leading up to the throne, with the exception of [[Prophet Velen]], who is by King [[Anduin Wrynn]]'s right side.''

On the other side of the cutscene a phased encounter begins. Kill any 5 demons around the keep, then return to Anduin in the throne room to turn in the quest.
