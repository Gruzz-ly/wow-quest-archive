==Description==
Oh, hi! Isn't this a great shot? I love my S.E.L.F.I.E. camera!

Do you want me to make you one, too? I only need a few parts!

For the strap, I'll need a Russet Belt from one of the armor merchants in Stormwind.

I've already ordered more housings, you're welcome to take one, you just have to find where my shipment ended up!

Oh, and a Standard Scope, most any engineer can make you one of those.

Ok, are you ready for a little photography action?!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}

==Progress==
Look at this shot? I could shoot here all day! Did you get those parts yet?

==Completion==
Great! I've just gotta put this box here, and jam this part in here... and done!

Here's your new S.E.L.F.I.E. cam, enjoy!
