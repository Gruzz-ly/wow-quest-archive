==Objectives==
Meet with the [[Illidari]] in the [[Mage Quarter]] of [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].

==Description==
At first I was unsure whether it was wise to allow the Illidari inside the city. But you may have just saved all our lives.

You may establish a camp in the Mage Quarter. The [[Alliance]] will have need of your skills if we are to face the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

Make no mistake though. Should your kind give in to the [[fel]] energies you toy with, we will treat you like the [[demon]]s you are becoming.

==Completion==
I trust the young king is safe.

We have more work ahead of us, [[demon hunter]]. Much more.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|70}}
