[[File:Trading Post UI.jpg|thumb|Purchasing interface]]
Just outside the [[Stormwind Stockade]] at the northern end of the [[Mage Quarter]] is the [[Trading Post]].

Next to [[Wilder Seabraid]] and [[Tawny Seabraid]] is the [[Collector's Cache]], which contains 500 [[Trader's Tender]] each month, for free.

After accepting the quest, you may run across a [[Trading Post Barker]].
:{{Text|Say|Trading Post Barker|Hey Friend! Come check out our new items in the Trading Post, we just got a new shipment!}}

Talk to them for a brief introduction:
:Come to the Trading Post, we have some new items in stock!
:{{Gossip|Where is the Trading Post?}}
:*The T&W Trading post is conveniently located in the center of Stormwind, right next to the Stockades! ''(T&W Trading Post barker)''
:*You'll be wanting to go to our Sister Trading post in Stormwind! I believe it's next to the Stockade? ''(Zen'shiri Trading Post barker)''

To the west are some stables with [[Valarian]], the Stable Keeper, tending them:
:Every month new and exotic creatures arrive in the Trading Post.
:You can see some of what the Seabraids have to offer right here.

Next to the Stormwind Stockade just north of the Trading Post proper is [[Dilya]], who is displaying some of the cosmetic items available for purchase:
:Every month we get new outfits and weapons from all over.
:It's my job to make sure these outfits and weaposn are properly displayed.

Posted to the right pillar of the Trading Post (next to Tawny) is the [[Trading Post Post]]:
:Welcome to T&W Trading Post! 
:Every month our goods, your activities and activity points are refreshed. 
:Make sure to check the Collector's Cache to collect any tender that you have earned.
:<The scroll continues on with more detail on various topics.>
*{{gossip|<Read the section about "Goods">}}
*:Every month we get a new shipment of goods to trade with brave adventurers.
*:You can see many examples of the goods we have to offer on display around the trading post.
*:If you've got the tender, we've got the latest fashions, faithful companions, and steadfast mounts!
*{{gossip|<Read the section about "Activities">}}
*:Every month a new selection of activities will be available to the bravest adventurers. 
*:We've done our best to make sure whatever types of adventures you like to do, you'll find an activity for it. You may also see that some of the activities are based on a theme!
*:<Open the [[Traveler's Log]] in the [[Adventure Guide]] to find this month's activities.>
*{{gossip|<Read the section about "Purchasing">}}
*:Purchasing from the Trading Post could not be simpler, provided you have accrued enough tender.
*:If you see an item you like but you don't have enough tender you can "freeze" it.
*:A frozen item will not rotate out when we get our new monthly shipment. We will hold it for you as long as you like!

The W of T&W Trading Post, [[Wilder Seabraid]] is in the main building:
:Welcome to T&W Trading Post!

:{{gossip|I'd like to see what you have to offer this month.}}

This opens the Trading Post interface, which shows how the player character looks while astride the mount, with the companion pet, or wearing the armor or weapon.

On complete:
