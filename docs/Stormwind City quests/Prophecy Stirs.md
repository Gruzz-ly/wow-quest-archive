'''Prophecy Stirs''' begins the "Seeing Red" storyline to unlock the [[man'ari eredar]] appearance for [[Draenei (playable)|draenei]] characters. Made available the week of 12 September 2023 during the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]], the storyline is available to any class and race, and only requires being level 30 as of {{g|tww}} (originally {{level|df-max}} in {{g|df}}).

==Objectives==
Use the Teleportation Crystal to meet [[Prophet Velen]] aboard the [[Vindicaar]].
*[[Teleportation Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Prophet Velen has roused from meditation and he requests your immediate presence.

A matter of great import has come to his attention. He would value both your wisdom and strength in addressing it.

The Prophet awaits you aboard the Vindicaar.

Take this crystal. Our [[artificer]]s have attuned it to the ship's teleportation matrix.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Fear not, <name>. For once, the situation is not dire.

In fact, I am... tentatively hopeful. Though that hope is tempered with concern.

==Notes==
Use the stone and speak with Velen to teleport to the ''[[Vindicaar]]'', in orbit above Azeroth. Find [[Velen|Prophet Velen]] and [[Grand Artificer Romuul]] at the control console on the bridge:
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I am glad my message reached you, <name>.}}

==Progression==
{{Seeing Red}}

==Patch changes==
