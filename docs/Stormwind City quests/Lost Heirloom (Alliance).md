Retrieve the heirlooms from [[Sorrow Hill Crypt]] in {{C|Western Plaguelands}}, then return to [[High Priestess Laurena]] in [[Cathedral of Light|Stormwind Cathedral]].

*[[Family Records]]
*[[Survivor Journal]]

==Description==
I came to [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] as a refugee, fleeing the devastation brought to [[Lordaeron]] by the [[Scourge]]. I thank the [[Light]] that my family and I escaped, but some of our treasured heirlooms still remain in the [[Plaguelands]].

If you are able to retrieve these heirlooms from their resting place in Sorrow Hill Crypt so I may safely inter them in the Cathedral's catacombs, I would be in your debt.

==Progress==
Have you returned from the Plaguelands?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You say you found a journal?

==Progression==
