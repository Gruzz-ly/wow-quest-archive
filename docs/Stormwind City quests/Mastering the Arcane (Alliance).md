You have proven yourself a brilliant student and a dedicated servant of the [[Alliance]]. Word of your accomplishments has even reached the ears of [[Varian Wrynn|the king]].

In recognition of your service, King Wrynn has commissioned the royal [[enchanter]] to create a special weapon.

* +500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Staff of the Royal Wizard]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
Ah, I have been expecting you, <name>. Maginor Dumas has spoken highly of you and the royal commission only confirms his words. It is an honor to be able to craft a staff for you.

==Notes==
The quest turn-in, [[Lucan Cordell]], is located in the enchanting shop along the [[Canals (Stormwind City)|Canals]], just outside of the [[Mage Quarter]] in [[Stormwind]].
