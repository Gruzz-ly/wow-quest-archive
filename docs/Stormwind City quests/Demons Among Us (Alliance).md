==Objectives==
Protect [[Stormwind Keep]] from the Legion.
* Learn what [[Jace Darkweaver]] knows about demons
* Kill [[Felblade Assassin|infiltrator]]s (5)
* Destroy the [[Garden (Stormwind Keep)|Courtyard]] [[Demon Portal (Stormwind City)|Legion Portal]] {{co|82.4|25.4|Stormwind City}}

==Description==
The king is wise to focus on the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s threat, <name>. Even now, the demons move against us.

The [[Illidari]] will aid the cause of the [[Alliance]]. We believe they have set their sights on key locations around [[Azeroth]]. In fact, they could already be in your midst!

I sense they are close...

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Seal of House Wrynn|Accolade of House Wrynn|Favor of House Wrynn
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I never suspected they had infiltrated my own throne room! Praise the [[Light]] you were here!

==Completion==
This attack... even the battle on the [[Broken Shore]]... it's only the beginning of the Legion's campaign.

If we don't find a way to stop them, we're going to lose everything my father and the other leaders built.

We need the strength of the Illidari behind us.

An [[Legion in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|OjjDWdNL0Ng|urlArgs=start=20&end=48}}
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|The enemy is among us!}}
:''Jace runs over to a [[Stormwind Royal Guard (NPC)|Stormwind Royal Guard]], brandishing his glaives.''
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Did you think I wouldn't see what you truly are, [[demon]]?}}
:''The Stormwind Royal Guard laughs and removes their disguise, revealing themselves to be a [[Felblade Assassin]].''
:{{text|say|Stormwind Royal Guard|You discovered us too late, Illidari! FELBLADE, ATTACK!}}
:''The camera pans around the throne room as more Fellblade Assassins are unveiled and begin entering.''
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Portals opening! Here they come!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Malfurion Stormrage]]|Demons in the throne room! Protect the king!}}
:{{text|yell|Jace Darkweaver|Shatter their portals! Drive out the Legion!}}
:''The cutscene ends with the Alliance racial leaders and Jace having formed a protective half-circle on the steps leading up to the throne, with the exception of [[Prophet Velen]], who is by King [[Anduin Wrynn]]'s right side.''

On the other side of the cutscene, a phased encounter begins. Starting in the throne room, take the northwest entryway leading to the courtyard and destroy the portal there. Go back to the throne room and follow the main corridor down while keeping an eye out for an entryway on your right. Go into the Petitioner's Chamber and destroy the Legion portal there. Kill any 5 demons around the keep along the way, and return to Anduin in the throne room to turn in the quest.

==Trivia==
* [[Magus Solgaze]] can be found in the [[Royal Library]] during the phased encounter.
