This daily quest requires 475 [[Jewelcrafting]]

== Objectives ==
Collect 10 [[Elemental Goo]] from any Cataclysm elemental and bring them to [[Isabel Jones]] in [[Stormwind]].

== Description ==
Instead of using the tired old method of setting gems into rings and such, I use an innovative new method. I simply glue on the gems with Barnsworth Elemental Glue! The [[Barnsworth|professor]] needs more elemental goo for another batch, though, and I have a whole bunch of setting to do. Can you go get me some? 

== Rewards ==
{{cost|16|53|ijt=1}}

== Progress ==
Did you bring me the elemental goo? 

== Completion ==
Thanks.  Erm.  Just set them over there.  I need to figure out how to get my hand off of this jar.

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
