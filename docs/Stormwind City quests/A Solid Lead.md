==Objectives==
Explore some of the more disreputable parts of [[Stormwind]] for information on who may have been plotting to rob the vault.

==Description==
This is undoubtedly a burning blade medallion, which suggests [[Burning Legion|legion]] [[cult]] involvement. As for where to start, you might try to head over to the taverns in the city and try to shake down some of the more unsavory types for information. It's not much, but its{{sic}} a start.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
You look like someone who just lost something...

I suspected you'd end up here sooner or later looking for it. To your credit, you made it faster than I expected.

==Progression==
