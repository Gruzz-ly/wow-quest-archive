==Objectives==
Find a way to destroy the orb.
*[[Mote of Mannoroth]] (12)
*[[Althalaxx Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
This orb is indeed connected to a powerful entity, somewhere beyond the [[Twisting Nether]]. I cannot divine its nature, but I feel its perception reaching through the orb... studying me in return.

I am reluctant to admit this, <name>, but the orb must be destroyed.

It seems impervious to most damage, but it may be vulnerable to the weapon of a powerful [[demon lord]]. I am unsure where you will find such a weapon, but it remains your best option.

Good luck, <name>.

==Progress==
<Your hair stands on end as infernal energies surround you>

==Completion==
<You raise the orb towards the spear>

==Notes==
Motes of Mannoroth drop from demons in [[Demon Fall Canyon]] in {{C|Ashenvale}}.

==Progression==
{{A Strange Artifact}}

==Patch changes==
