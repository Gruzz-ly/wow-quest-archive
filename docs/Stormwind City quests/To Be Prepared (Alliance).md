==Description==
Allies from across [[Azeroth]] have come to [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] to support our efforts against the [[Burning Legion]]. Before you ship out, you should pay them a visit. Every bit of preparation helps!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Signet of Stormwind
}}

==Progress==
The [[Light]] protects those who protect themselves!

==Completion==
It's good to see you've prepared yourself. You never know what you'll be facing out there.

We've commissioned these rings for high-ranking members of the Alliance. May this one protect you in the battle to come.

==Notes==
From Recruiter Lee, take the stairs down to the bottom level of the harbor for the first three criteria. Additionally, there are three first aid crates that contain three each of [[Blessed Bandage]]. Once done there, go back to the mid-level and look for a circle of spectators west of Recruiter Lee. Talk to any of the named NPCs to initiate a duel.

;Approach [[Keg of Armor Polish]]

;By the ship, [[Knight Dameron]]
:{{text|say|Knight Dameron|This is your ship, <name>. Light be with you.}}

===Buffs===
Several unique beneficial effects are available from this quest. They last an hour, remain active in non-{{expac|Legion}} content, and can be re-acquired repeatedly as long as the quest is not completed or abandoned.
* [[Polished Armor]] - With a solid percentage-based boost to armor, this is the only buff signficant at high levels.
* [[Well Fed (Legion Invasion)]] - This bonus is fairly small and does not scale to the [[level cap]].
* [[Holy Enchantment]] - Testing has suggested the bonus damage effect may not trigger correctly in modern patches.

The [[Blessed Bandage]] buff is restricted to low levels, only lasts 5 minutes, and cannot be used in most zones. Its crates do not respawn either. Therefore, it is only relevant when actually playing through this questline as intended.

==Progression==
{{Broken Shore Alliance}}

==Trivia==
*Several [[garrison followers]] appear in [[Stormwind Harbor]] for this quest.
**A circle of followers can be seen watching a duel between [[Kiruud the Relentless]] and [[Seona Fireweaver]], and can be asked for a duel themselves.

**[[Matthew Deyling]] is giving a lecture on several different classes of [[demons]], with [[Esmund Brightshield]] and [[Bloodrose]] conjuring images of them.
**[[Len-Shu]], [[Su-Lai Snowpetal]], and [[Haomi]] are seen both preparing and eating the food prepared for outgoing adventurers.
**[[Voraatios the Benedictive]], [[Bemora]] and [[Loranea]] (who oddly appears in the dueling ring as well) are preparing light-infused crystals for the [[adventurer]]s' weapons.
**[[Alasdair Whitepeak]], [[Kinndy Brightsocket]], [[Doc Lightspanner]], and [[Brother Zuo]] (a [[Horde]] follower previously) can be seen [[Blessed Bandage|blessing bandages]] for use on the [[Broken Shore]].
**[[Lorcan Flintedge]] is found on [[Captain Angelica|Captain Angelica's]] departing battleship.
*The foods available for the "last meal" are Dumplings, Baked Fish, Fried Rice, Ribs, Baked Fowl, and Grilled Fish. All grant the same special [[Well Fed (Legion Invasion)]] buff.
