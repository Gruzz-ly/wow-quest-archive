This daily quest requires 475 [[Jewelcrafting]]

== Objectives ==
Cut three [[Solid Zephyrite]]s and give them to [[Isabel Jones]] in [[Stormwind]]. 
* 3 [[Solid Zephyrite]]
* 3 Solid Zephyrites cut

== Description ==
Lila's pet Nibbler got into my workshop again!

I was making a bracelet, to be delivered today. The work was almost done, except for the gems. I spent all night cutting them, but when I stepped out for a bit of breakfast, the little beast came into my workshop and swallowed every gem in sight! The thing can digest ANYTHING, and trust me, you'd break your back trying to pick up its leavings.

I need to get replacement gems fast; the courier is coming in tonight. Help! 

== Rewards ==
{{cost|16|53}}
* 1 [[Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token]]

== Progress ==
Have you brought the solid zephyrites I need? 

== Completion ==
You've really saved my skin, <name>.  Thanks! 
 
== Notes ==
You need to actually cut the 3 gems ''while on this quest'' to complete it.

== Patch changes ==
