==Objectives==
Use the Fast-Acting Poison to contaminate 6 Grain Rations in the [[West Garrison]] or [[East Garrison]] of [[Blackrock Depths]].
*Poison [[Grain Rations]] (6)
*[[Fast-Acting Poison]] (provided)

==Description==
Things are getting interesting in [[Blackrock Mountain]], <name>. Our sources report that the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] have formed closer ties with [[Twilight's Hammer]] and both are preparing for a major offensive.

I've made the contents of the report known to key leaders in [[Stormwind]] and I want you to help deal with this emerging Dark Iron threat.

The rations for most of the [[Dark Iron Army|Dark Iron army]] are kept in the East and West Garrison of Blackrock Depths. Take this poison and apply it to their grain reserves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[SI:7 Special Issue Facemask]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
With any luck, the poison will take out a fair number of their frontline troops before they know what's happening. That should stall them for the near future. [[SI:7]] is most pleased with your work.
