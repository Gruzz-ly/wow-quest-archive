==Objectives==
Go to the Gallina Winery, and bring [[Suzetta Gallina]] the [[Wine Ticket]] for a free bottle of wine.
*[[Wine Ticket]] (Provided)

==Description==
If you talk to anyone about wine, then you know we Gallinas sell the best wine in [[Stormwind]]. And we're not far, still in the Trade District along the city's lovely canals.

Here, take this pamphlet. Bring it to my sister Suzetta at our shop for a complimentary bottle of the famous Dalaran Noir. You won't regret it!

==Reward==
{{Itembox|You receive|Bottle of Dalaran Noir}}

==Progress==
Greetings and welcome, <master/madam>. Have you yet tried one of our fine wines? 

==Completion==
Ah, so you've seen Renato? Well here you are, <sir/ma'am>. A bottle of our special pinot noir. You'll not find its equal in all of Azeroth! 

==Gains==
*130 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||90}} at level 80)
*150 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind]]

==Notes==
Oddly enough, the completion text still mentions the wine by it's old name.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.3.0|note=Mention of Pinot Noir from description changed to Dalaran Noir.}}
