Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain Walden's Talisman, the Book of Lost Souls, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
*[[Walden's Talisman]]
*[[Book of Lost Souls]]
*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
Your talent has attracted much attention in [[shaman]]ic circles, <name>. Word of your mastery of the elements and dedication to the [[Alliance]] has even reached the palace.

In recognition of your service, [[Varian Wrynn|King Wrynn]] has commissioned the royal armorer to forge a special weapon.

The materials for your weapon can only be found in [[Silverpine Forest]]'s cursed Shadowfang Keep. Travel there and retrieve [[Lord Walden]]'s talisman, the Book of Lost Souls, and the essence of the [[ghost]]s haunting the castle.

You will also receive:

* +500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
I have rarely had the chance to work with such exotic materials, but even I can sense the power residing within them. I will have the honor of crafting an incredible weapon for you, <name>. The farseer did not underestimate your abilities when she told me about you.
