==Objectives==
Use your [[Spectral Sight]].
* Spectral Sight used

==Description==
Though young King [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] is a noble soul, he may lack the conviction of [[Varian Wrynn|his father]]. The [[Alliance]] needs a leader who will do what needs to be done. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] will strike at the first hint of weakness.

Even now, I sense something amiss, <name>. I fear that not all is as it seems.

Quickly, use your Spectral Sight. We must know if there are foes among us!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|11|60}}

==Progress==
Time is precious.

==Completion==
Of course the Legion would try to infiltrate this funeral. Having all the leaders of the Alliance gathered in one place at one time... it is too tasty a target for the demons to resist!

==Notes==
Use Spectral Sight anywhere in the area: demons are hiding everywhere!
