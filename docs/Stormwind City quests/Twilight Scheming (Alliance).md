==Objectives==
Use the Glowing Torch to destroy 8 copies of The Twilight Creed in the [[Domicile]] of [[Blackrock Depths]].
*Copies of [[The Twilight Creed]] burned (8)
*[[Glowing Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
The influence of [[Twilight's Hammer]] reaches far and wide. They search ceaselessly for allies in their battle against us and they are recruiting the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] of Blackrock Depths to their cause.

[[Moira Thaurissan|Moira]]'s grip on the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] is tenuous at best and more of her people fall away from her rule with each day. We must sabotage their recruitment efforts.

I want you to go into Domicile portion of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn the books that the Twilight's Hammer is distributing there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Crown of the Hallowed]]

==Completion==
You have done your work well, <name>. While this will not stop Twilight's Hammer, it will help sow suspicion between them and the Dark Irons.

==Progression==
#[[Meet with Patrice Lancaster]] (optional)
#[[Twilight Scheming (Alliance)]]
