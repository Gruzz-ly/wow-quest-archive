==Objectives==
Retrieve the Wooden Figurine and bring it to [[Gakin the Darkbinder]] in the [[Mage Quarter]] of [[Stormwind]].
*[[Wooden Figurine]]

==Description==
You will need a powerful reagent to tempt an [[incubus]] -- an object that represents great devotion and love. With my scrying, I have located a small figurine that should be suitable for your ritual. Thousands of years ago, the figurine belonged to a young couple. The original owners are no more, but their keepsake has survived to the present day. Follow the road north into [[Ashenvale]], then west and past [[Maestra's Post]]. You will see a house nestled amongst the trees. There you will find what you seek.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You've returned. Successfully, I assume?

==Completion==
<Gakin turns the wooden figurine over in his hand.>

I sense the emotional energy residing within this artifact, undiminished by the passing of time. The incubus will be drawn to it like a fly to honey.

[[Takar the Seer|Takar]] never disappoints.
