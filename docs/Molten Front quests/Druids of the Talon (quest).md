==Objectives==
Obtain 150 Marks of the World Tree.
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] (150)

==Description==
[[Skylord Omnuron]] and his [[Druids of the Talon]] have been a fearsome force for us back in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]]. I know that they prefer the familiar skies of that battlefield, but the time may come when we need them here nonetheless.

If you get your hands on enough marks, you should appeal to Omnuron that his druids should be on the main front. Omnuron watches out for his own, but he also understands the importance of this effort.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|80}}
*86750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
It is good to see you again.

==Completion==
I see. I can't see I'm eager to bring my flock to the Firelands, but I knew it would become necessary at some point.

We will be there, <class>. Thank you for carrying the message.

==Notes==
There are three or four dailies at the breach (worth 6/8 marks) and a few more back at the Sanctuary of Malorne (worth 6 marks). This will take up to two weeks to complete.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Skylord Omnuron|I need no more convincing, <name>. The Druids of the Talon will lend you their aid.}}
:''Thisalee Crow and another druid runs in.''
:{{text|say|[[Thisalee Crow]]|Did I hear right, Omnuron? We're going to join the fight?}}
:{{text|say|Skylord Omnuron|Yes, Thisalee. Gather our forces. We leave for the Molten Front at once.}}
:{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|I'm going to enjoy this.}}
:''The three druids shift to flight form and fly out.''

The innkeeper in the [[Shrine of Aviana]], [[Isara Riverstride]], has the next quest: [[Flight of the Storm Crows]].
