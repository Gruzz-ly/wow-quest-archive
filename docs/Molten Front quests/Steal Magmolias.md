==Objectives==
Collect 8 Magmolias from the [[Magma Springs]] to the north.
* [[Magmolia]] (8)

==Description==
We've discovered a new species of flower growing in the Magma Springs to the north.  Amazingly, they sustain themselves in pure molten lava!

Please go and retrieve some specimens for me.  I'm sure that further study of these plants will shed some light on your little friend here.

Speaking of which, he seems quite eager to go with you.  Let's hope he behaves himself. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|4|15}}
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Fascinating!  The more time I spend in the [[Firelands]], the more I see there is an ecosystem at work here. 

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.  I will start analyzing these samples at once. 

==Notes== 
*Some Magmolia flowers are actually [[Lava Burster]]s in disguise. The quest-tracking portion of the tooltip is not fooled, however. Spawned Lava Bursters drop a Magmolia as a reward for killing them.
*The lava really doesn't hurt all that much. Swimming through it to get a Magmolia is perfectly reasonable. 
*The quest name is a reference to the film "Steel Magnolias"
