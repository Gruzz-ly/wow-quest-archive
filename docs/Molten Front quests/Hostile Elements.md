==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Charred Soldier]]s or [[Charred Vanquisher]]s.
*Charred Combatant slain x8

==Description==
The elementals continue to press on us, and I do not expect them to subside any time soon.

You'll find them pouring across the Ashen Fields to the north. Thin their ranks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 {{coppercost|94000}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
We cannot allow these elementals to take any ground. They're not likely to lapse in their attacks long enough for us to take it back.

==Completion==
Your continued efforts are appreciated, <class>. We will win this war as long as people like you stand beside us.

==Notes==
Charred Soldiers are level 85 [[fire elemental]]s with 77,490 health. Charred Vanquishers are level 85 [[fire revenant]]s with 116,235 health. At least get the tag on six. The friendly NPCs will be more than glad to help finish them off.

A useful tactic on quieter realms or after the rush to complete these quests is to sit at the top of the ramp down into the main battle area, and just tag anything that makes it up to the top. The NPCs will finish the mobs off extremely quickly, making this a virtually zero-effort tactic. Tanking classes can also run into the Firelands, gather mobs, and drag them to the NPCs to be killed. It's possible to finish the quest in a single pull this way.
