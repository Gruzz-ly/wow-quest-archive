==Objectives==
Kill 5 Lava Bursters.
*[[Lava Burster]] slain (5)

==Description==
[[Lava worm]]s are bursting through the ground behind our lines, breaking our formations and allowing [[fire elemental|elementals]] to slip through. You'll find them scattered throughout our entire front to the north, and upon the [[Ashen Fields]] further out.

Stomp them back into their holes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 XP (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Our enemies have no fear of death. If we cannot break their morale and we cannot exhaust their forces, that leaves us with only one option. We must kill [[Ragnaros]] himself.

==Completion==
We're grateful for your support. Your presence on the battlefield gives us the time we need to refortify. Your efforts make all the difference.

==Notes==
Lava Bursters have advanced from their position in the [[Magma Springs]] to reach the front lines. Level 85 lava worms with 92988 health, the bursters have the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Lava Spit|Spits molten lava at the target, dealing 15173 to 17510 Fire damage.|range=5-45|notes=3 sec cast. Interruptible. Only hits for about 7000-8500 Fire despite the tooltip. Constantly cast unless Lava Shower is off cooldown.}}
*{{abilities|Lava Shower|range=40|Creates a crescent of flame that does 62137 to 65324 Fire damage to enemies in a frontal arc.|notes=2 sec cast. Uninterruptible. Spams 5 yard-diameter circles of fire in a 180 degree arc 40 yards out in front of the burster. A second or so later, each fire triggers...}}
**{{abilities|Lava Shower|Inflicts 61237 to 65324 Fire damage.|notes=Instant. Hits for around 50000 Fire, despite the tooltip.}}

You can easily dodge Lava Shower by standing virtually on top of the Lava Burster. It'll shower behind you.
