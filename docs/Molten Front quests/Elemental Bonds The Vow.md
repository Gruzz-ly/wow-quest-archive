==Objectives==
Speak with [[Thrall]] at [[Nordrassil]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

==Description==
Before he passed through the portal to Mount Hyjal, Thrall asked you to follow him. There is something he would like you to witness.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mantle of Doubt
|Mantle of Desire
|Mantle of Patience
|Mantle of Fury
}}

You will also receive:
*138800 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|376000}} at max level)
*+1000 [[reputation]] with the [[Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
Thanks to you, my friend - I live again!

And due to the combined efforts of the [[Cenarion Circle]] and the [[Earthen Ring]] - the World Tree will bring new life to [[Azeroth]] as well.

While [[Deathwing]] and the rest of the foes remain to be dealt with, I wish to share something with you.

==Notes==
On accept, Aggra updates her gossip text again:
:I can't believe that it's... over...
:Go'el is free, thanks in no small part to you, <name>.
:{{gossip|''Umm, Aggra... shouldn't you be following Thrall?''}}
:You are right. I will see you in Mount Hyjal, friend.
:{{gossip|''Don't forget your totems!''}}

Take the portal to Hyjal next to Aggra on [[Ragnaros' Reach]]. The portal drops players off back near the [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|Well of Eternity]] under Nordrassil. Thrall and Aggra are facing each other, while [[Alexstrasza]], [[Kalecgos]], [[Nozdormu]], [[Muln Earthfury]], [[Farseer Nobundo]], [[Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], [[Malfurion Stormrage]] and [[Ysera]] are all in attendance. Speak to Thrall to continue.
