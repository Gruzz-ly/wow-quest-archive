==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Cinderweb Spinner]]s or [[Cinderweb Creeper]]s.
*Cinderweb spider slain (8)

==Description==
We've fought hard to secure [[Forlorn Spire|this area]], but our foothold is tenuous.

Our scouts report that the area around us is teeming with vicious [[fire spider]]s. They are the spawn of the vicious brood widow, [[Beth'tilac]].

Help us hold our line by clearing the area of Cinderweb Spinners or Cinderweb Creepers. It will drive her mad to see her children slain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
We cannot move the battle forward until we've cleared the area of Beth'tilac's vile spawn.

==Completion==
Wonderful! The more spiders we clear out, the easier it will be to push forward.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies at the Forlorn Spire before heading out. While out and about, kill a [[Druid of the Flame]] and it will drop a [[Dried Acorn]] on the ground. It starts [[The Mysterious Seed]].
