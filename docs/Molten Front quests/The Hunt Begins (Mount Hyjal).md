==Objectives==
Speak to [[Captain Saynna Stormrunner]] at [[Malfurion's Breach]].

==Description==
The [[Shadow Wardens]] have joined the fight at the [[Molten Front]], on your request. You should find Captain Saynna Stormrunner and see to it that they've found a way to best apply their skills.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|35}}
*17350 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|41350}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Completion==
Hello, <name>. It's good to see you again.

You needn't worry. We've settled in quite well. I've dispatched several of my wardens to assist in hunting down the [[Druids of the Flame]], and I've drawn assault plans for the [[Forlorn Spire]]. When the time is right, perhaps you will join us there.

==Notes==
The phase at [[Malfurion's Breach]] has advanced, if slightly. Shadow Wardens have made their appearance. Shalis Darkhunter stands near the portal at Malfurion's Breach and the captain is inside the Sentinel Tree near Malfurion.

Complete the phase two daily quests and then the phase three daily quests will unlock for the day. Should players have both factions unlocked, they may complete ''either'' faction's chain of daily quests each day, not both.
