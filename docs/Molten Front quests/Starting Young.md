==Objectives==
Recover 5 Fire Hawk Hatchlings.
*[[Fire Hawk Hatchling]] (5)

==Description==
Our [[scout]]s are bringing back reports of [[fire hawk]] hatchlings all over [[Fireplume Peak|the peak]]... their eggs must have hatched very recently.  Better yet, it seems that they're extremely docile.

I know it may sound a strange and perhaps unsavory request, but if you were able to bring some of those hatchlings back to me, I might be able to train them to aid us in our war efforts.

Are you willing?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2
*{{coppercost|94000}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
I can't make up my mind on how to regard these creatures. They act much like other avians, but they are very obviously native to this fiery place.

I wonder why [[Ragnaros]] and his minions have not made attempts to rally them against us...

==Completion==
They look to have singed your gloves a bit, but I don't see any damage otherwise.  Well done, <class>.

Come by again within the next few days to see how the training has gone.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies in the area before heading out.

Getting across to the Fireplume Peak involves platforming across floating rocks that will break apart on occasion. Not all is lost if players misjudge a jump, however, as a friendly druid of the talon will save hapless players from falling to their deaths before dropping them off on Fireplume Peak:
:{{text|say|Druid of the Talon|You're far too important to us to be lost that easily.}}
or
:{{text|say|Druid of the Talon|Going up.}}

Here and there around the peak will be hatchlings, but there are also ones positioned above the thermals, always in pairs.  The idea is to use the thermal to jump, and when you get close enough while shooting past, to grab one.  It can be done, but you may perhaps want to skip those if time is of the essence.

Finish up and head back to base. To get back to the mainland, head to the southeast side of the island, where at {{co|29.3|52.8|Molten Front}} is a thermal vent that will launch back that direction.
