==Objectives==
Lead a [[Hyjal Wisp (Molten Front)|Hyjal Wisp]] to one of the fire portals in the [[Ashen Fields]], and protect the wisp until it closes the portal. If you lose your wisp, return to [[Rayne Feathersong]] at [[Malfurion's Breach]].
*Close a Fire Portal

==Description==
The [[fire elemental]]s are pouring out of portals on the far side of the Ashen Fields. We need someone to close them. Cut off some of their reinforcements.

Banishing these kinds of elemental magics is something our wisps are perfectly suited for. One will come with you. Lead it to a portal and keep it alive until it finishes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Completion==
Well done, <class>. I'll have to make more use of your skills in the future.

==Notes==
On accept, a Hyjal Wisp joins the player. Head out past the front line and look for a few fires close together coming out of the ground. Get close and the wisp will start circling it.

A good number of Firekin with 15498 health will come out to defend it one at a time every few seconds. Fend them off until the wisp does the job.
