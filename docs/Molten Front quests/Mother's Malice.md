==Objectives==
Defeat the Fire Hawk Matriarch.
*[[Fire Hawk Matriarch]] slain

==Description==
Unsurprisingly, their matriarch has taken offense to us taking her young to train for our own uses. It's understandable... and a bit tragic actually. We are very much the villains in this exchange.

Now is not the time for such thoughts. These creatures are beings of fire, and on more than one occasion, they've claimed the lives of our kin. With their matriarch angered, the danger has grown immensely.

I need someone to quiet her rage, and I fear you may be the most capable. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*x2 [[Mark of the World Tree]]
*{{coppercost|514000}}
*69400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]
