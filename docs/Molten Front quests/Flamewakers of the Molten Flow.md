==Objectives==
Slay 8 Flamewakers within the [[Molten Flow]].
*Flamewaker slain (8)

==Description==
Of all [[Ragnaros]]' minions, the [[flamewaker]]s appear to be the most devoted. Most of them dwell within this cave, preparing for another attack. Our foothold may be strong, but we will not tolerate any surprise attacks from these worms.

No, we will strike first.

Tear them apart, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2
*{{coppercost|94000}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
This cavern is their home, <name>. Do not be reckless... they know this territory better than you do.

==Completion==
I like the way you work, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fire Flowers]] before heading out. Any flamewaker in the cave counts: hunter, sentinel, shaman.

While out killing things, look for thermal vents rising out of the ground. Jump in them to get to higher ledges to find the Luciferns.

The sentinels have a move where they will snag players, then go jump in lava and hold them there for a few seconds before finally releasing them. Watch out!

All the way at the north end of the cave at {{co|51.9|31.0|Molten Front}} is [[Anren Shadowseeker]]. He offers [[Need... Water... Badly...]], a one-time escort quest taking him from his spot at the northern end of the cave, fighting through half of the cave, then leaping via thermal vents back to the entrance. Completing that escort unlocks [[Hounds of Shannox]] from Anren near Thisalee, and [[How Hot]] from [[Tholo Whitehoof]] on the surface.
