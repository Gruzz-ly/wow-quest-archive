==Objectives==
Collect 20 Cinderweb Eggs from the pillars in [[The Widow's Clutch]].
*[[Cinderweb Egg (quest item)]] (20)

==Description==
We have a real problem on our hands. Not only are the nearby spiders vicious and predatory, their numbers appear to be endless.

We need to stop the growth of their army. Cut their heads off in the egg, not on the battlefield.

The Cinderweb Spinners' eggs are laid among the stone pillars to the north. Collect 20 eggs and bring them back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
It appears the Cinderweb Spinners are the caretakers of [[Beth'tilac]]'s brood.

==Completion==
Wonderful work, <class>. Let's hope those little spider bites aren't infectious.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies at the Forlorn Spire before heading out. While out and about, kill a [[Druid of the Flame (mob)|Druid of the Flame]] and it will drop a [[Dried Acorn]] on the ground. It starts [[The Mysterious Seed]].

==Progression==
{{Shadow Wardens}}
