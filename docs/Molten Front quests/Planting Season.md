==Objectives==
Plant the acorn in the Un'goro Soil at [[Malfurion's Breach]].
*Acorn Planted
*[[Dried Acorn]] (provided)

==Description==
The acorn seems to be unharmed.

<Avrilla shrugs.>

No point in beating around the bush. Let's plant it and see what comes out.

Luckily for you, we brought some leftover soil with us to help establish our base.

You'll find the soil at the graveyard directly east.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|47000}}
*34700 XP (or {{coppercost|82700}} at max level)
*+75 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
[[File:Planting a Lashling.jpg|thumb|The acorn is sprouting!]]
What happened when you planted the acorn?

==Completion==
A red flower pops its head out of the soil.

==Notes==
Head southeast to the graveyard. A large pile of Un'Goro soil is at {{co|53.5|90.7|Molten Front}} near [[Theresa Barkskin]]. Interact with it and a [[Crimson Lasher]] pops out of the soil, following the player around!

The quest completes automatically.

==Progression==
{{Crimson Lasher}}
