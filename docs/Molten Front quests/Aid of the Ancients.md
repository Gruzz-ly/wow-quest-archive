==Objectives==
Speak to [[Elderlimb]] at [[Malfurion's Breach]].

==Description==
The ancients have seen the value of your wisdom, and have set root at Malfurion's Breach.  You should seek out Elderlimb.  I am certain he would like to hear from you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|13|50}}
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Completion==
You chose a wise time to call upon us, <class>.  I was concerned for our ability to stand against the elements in this realm, but the protection of the [[Sentinel Tree]] has proven far more than sufficient shelter.

We will do anything we can to aid your efforts here.  [[Witherbranch]] has met with your other allies and is discussing a way to corner some of [[Ragnaros]]' lieutenants.  You should speak with them when the time comes.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.2.0|note=Added.}}
