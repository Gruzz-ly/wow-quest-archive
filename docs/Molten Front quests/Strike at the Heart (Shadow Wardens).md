==Objectives==
Kill the Lieutenant of Flame.
*Lieutenant of Flame slain

==Description==
One of [[Ragnaros]]' Lieutenants has shown itself at [[Ragnaros' Reach]].  It is time to strike. [[Captain Saynna Stormrunner|Captain Sayanna]] has requested that you be there to help see the fight through.

[[Witherbranch]] and some others will have joined the battle by the time you arrive.  You should make haste to the northwest and find them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x3 and {{coppercost|188000}}
*86750 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|206700}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Today we cripple their war effort.

==Completion==
Very well done, <name>! This should delay them significantly.

If we keep this up, we can easily push the fight back to Ragnaros himself.

==Notes==
[[Calling the Ancients]] is required for this quest to become available.

Head north to [[Ragnaros' Reach]]. [[Witherbranch]] and another Shadow Warden are in wait at {{co|47.7|27.7|Molten Front}} opposite an Ancient Firelord, waiting on the player's command to start the attack. Speak with Witherbranch:
:We've delayed long enough. Let us take the battle to this servant of Ragnaros immediately.
{{gossip|''Wait no longer, I'm ready to fight.}}

The Ancient Firelord, a level 85 elite fire elemental with 1,549,800 health, has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic Melee|notes=22000 Physical on Witherbranch}}
*{{abilities|Flame Spout|range=100|Summons a flame spout under a nearby target, erupting for 57164 to 66435 Fire damage after 3 sec.|notes=2.5 sec cast. Uninterruptible.}}
*{{abilities|Fire Torrent|Preparing to release an immense torrent of fire.|notes=Channeled. Triggers...}}
**{{abilities|Fire Torrent|Inflicts 43935 to 46190 Fire damage every 1 sec for 12 sec.|notes=The Firelord sweeps the area, rotating 180 degrees with a fire wall that extends roughly 100 yards out.}}

[[Sira Moonwarden]] will pop two shadow gates on occasion. They can be used once a minute to teleport to the paired gate to quickly escape the Fire Torrent should players be stuck in a bad spot. The act of teleporting will also give players a 15-second buff to movement speed and damage dealt.

Outside of basic melee, which should only be on Witherbranch, the Ancient Firelord will drop Flame Spouts on the ground that explode for a healthy amount of damage if they do not get moved out of. The Ancient Firelord will also sweep the area in a 180-degree arc with Fire Torrent, which hits for ~40,000 Fire.

Witherbranch has 774,000 health, but no heals, so this fight cannot take too long. Go all out. Return to [[Malfurion's Breach]] upon the Ancient Firelord's death.
