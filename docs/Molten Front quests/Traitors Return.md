==Objectives==
Kill 3 [[Druid of the Flame (mob)|Druids of the Flame]].
*Druid of the Flame slain

==Description==
The Druids of the Flame assault our front line, <name>.

These vile creatures have turned their backs on [[Elune]]'s teachings and worship instead the Fire Lord, [[Ragnaros]]. Twisted by his insane power, they desire nothing more than to bury us in ash.

We must counter their attack immediately!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
How does the front look?

==Completion==
Good. Our enemies now know that our strength is to be feared.

==Notes==
Druids of the Flame are level 85s with 154k health, using fire mage abilities such as [[Scorch]] and [[Pyroblast]] in both caster and Flame Cat form.

==Progression==
{{Firelands invasion part two}}
