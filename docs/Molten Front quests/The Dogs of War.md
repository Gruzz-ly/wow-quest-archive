==Objectives==
Kill 5 Charhounds or Ancient Charhounds.
*[[Ancient Charhound]] slain (5)

==Description==
Our forces are falling beneath an unleashed monstrosity - Charhounds from the molten depths.

These dogs fear nothing and will not stop until their lust for blood is satisfied. Our forces are barely holding them back.

Go join the defenders in the Ashen Fields or in the Molten Flow. Perhaps you can make a dent in their numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2
*{{cost|9|40}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
This war will be long and cruel. Do not weep for lost comrades. Save your energy for the enemy.

==Completion==
Good, <class>. The enemy may be tough, but you have proven today that you are tougher.

==Notes==
Charhounds are elementals with no special abilities to be aware of. They run fast, though.

It is often possible to complete this quest as a tank along with "Hostile Elements" - simply gather anything that moves and drag it to the top of the ramp for the NPCs to finish off.
