==Objectives==
Obtain 8 samples of Flame Venom and 8 samples of Searing Web Fluid.
*[[Flame Venom]] (8)
*[[Searing Web Fluid]] (8)

==Description==
The [[Widow's Clutch]], to the northeast, is named after [[Beth'tilac]], the enormous queen of the flame spiders. Her webs and her poison are a nagging threat to our main offensive force.

We believe that if we study the flame spiders here on the Molten Front, we can use that information to find success against Beth'tilac. Use whatever methods you can to gather their venom and their web fluid, then return to my trusted friend [[Anren Shadowseeker|Anren]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1 and {{cost|16|54}}
*69400 XP (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Be careful with those fluids, <name>. We don't want them spilling anywhere. 

==Completion==
You are an asset to our cause, <name>. Tholo and I thank you. 

==Notes==
*The items drop from the spiders in the area, but you also receive a [[Searing Web Fluid]] when you are pulled up by a [[Cinderweb Spinner]] with [[Entangling Net]], and a [[Flame Venom]] when a [[Cinderweb Creeper]] uses [[Flame Injection]], so you may complete this daily without killing more than the 8 you have to kill for [[Pyrorachnophobia]] anyway.

*This quest can become difficult to complete at higher levels mainly from your character being able to kill the Cinderweb Spinners in one hit, which can prevent you from looting the Cinderweb Spinner since they won't pull you to their location. However since you only have to interact with them in someway to get pulled you can easily use a long range ability (example: [[Wind Shear]]) in order to get their attention. Alternatively you can try killing the Cinderweb Creepers close by and seeing if Creepers and the Spinners enter the same loot zone.
