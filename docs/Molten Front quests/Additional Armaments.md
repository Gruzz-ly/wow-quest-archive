The quest '''Additional Armaments''' is part of the [[Firelands Invasion]]. Completing it will allow the player to purchase items from {{NPC|Neutral|Damek Bloombeard}}, as well as opening up more dailies which will yield [[Mark of the World Tree]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 125 Marks of the World Tree.
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] (125)

==Description==
These druids be lackin' the tools ta properly handle the job out 'ere. I got meself a buddy back at day [[Malorne|ol' stag]] [[Sanctuary of Malorne|shrine]] through the portal though. If we were ta be gettin' reunited, we'd sure have some real toys ta use against [[Ragnaros|ol' Ragboy]] and 'is cronies.

Take some of dem mark things an' go find [[Matoclaw]]. Ask her fer [[Ricket]]. We need'r here so we can be causin' some real trouble.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|188000}}
*86750 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|206700}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]
* You will be able to purchase the 365 Blacksmithing and Engineering recipes from [[Damek Bloombeard]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
I was wondering if those two would come in handy. They've seemed quite out of place ever since they arrived.

I saw Ricket around here just a moment ago. I'll gladly send her back through the portal with you. She's less likely to be blowing up any local plant life on that side of things anyway.

Let's see... where is she...

==Notes==
*Upon completion of ''both'' [[Druids of the Talon (quest)]] and [[The Shadow Wardens]], Damek will phase in inside the Sentinel Tree near [[Malfurion Stormrage]] and [[Saynna Stormrunner]]. During this phase, players can earn a maximum of 27 marks each day, so this quest will take five days to complete.
*Upon completing this quest, the following event will trigger:
:''There's an explosion in the air above you, a rocket mount falls next to Matoclaw and spins in place before exploding, and Ricket falls down in front of Matoclaw.''
:{{text|say|Ricket|Ow! Well I guess that prototype didn't work, either.}}
:{{text|say|Matoclaw|Good timing, Ricket. <Name> says they need your expertise on the Molten Front.}}
:''Ricket begins to walk down the stairs, away from Matoclaw.''
:{{text|say|Ricket|Oh goody! Time to fight fire with...highly flammable weapons grade explosives!}}
:''Ricket disappears.''

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.2.0|note=Added.}}
