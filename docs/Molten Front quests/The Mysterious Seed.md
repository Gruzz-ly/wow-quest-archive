This short quest chain introduces you to the [[Fire Lasher]] referred to in the achievement [[The Molten Front Offensive]], and opens up another daily quest in the [[Molten Front]].

==Objectives==
Take the acorn to [[Avrilla]] at [[Malfurion's Breach]] in the [[Firelands]].
*[[Dried Acorn]] (provided)

==Description==
A small, dried acorn has fallen out of the Flame Druid's robe.

Why would a [[Druid of the Flame]] be carrying it around?

Perhaps someone at [[Malfurion's Breach]] would like to see it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|94000}} (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*69400 XP (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+75 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Completion==
Fascinating! It appears to be an acorn!

==Notes==
You need to have completed [[The Shadow Wardens]] to be able to obtain this quest.

Kill a [[Druid of the Flame]] anywhere on the Molten Front, and it will drop a Dried Acorn on the ground. Interact with that acorn to pick up this quest.

Druids of the Flame (so named) can be found at the [[Widow's Clutch]] and other locations.

==Progression==
