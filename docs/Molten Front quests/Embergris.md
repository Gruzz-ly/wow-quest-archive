==Objectives==
Retrieve 5 Embergris from [[Charred Soldier]]s and [[Charred Vanquisher]]s.
*[[Embergris (item)]] (5)

==Description==
The Crimson Lasher has developed some cracking blisters on its vines. Without treatment, this condition could be life threatening.

Luckily, the Charred Soldiers and Charred Vanquishers in the area produce a waxy substance known as Embergris, which should soothe the Lasher's pain.

Bring me some of this substance, and kill those nasty fire elementals while you're at it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|94}}
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
The Lasher is growing quite quickly.

==Completion==
It isn't very pleasant-smelling, but this should fix the Lasher right up.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.2.0|note=Added.}}
