==Objectives==
Obtain 150 Marks of the World Tree.
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] (150)

==Description==
The [[Shadow Wardens]] are back in the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]]. I know that they take the loss of [[Fandral Staghelm|Fandral]] from their custody very seriously, so it wouldn't take much prodding to bring them to the [[Firelands]] to hunt the [[Druids of the Flame]], and perhaps aid us otherwise in the process.

Should you come upon enough marks, you should seek out Captain Saynna Stormrunner at the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] and secure her aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|188000}}
*86750 XP (or {{coppercost|206700}} at max level)
*+350 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

==Completion==
I see. It is time for us to join the hunt in the Firelands then. My sisters will be with you, <class>.

==Notes==
There are three or four dailies at the breach (worth 6/8 marks) and a few more back at the Sanctuary of Malorne (worth 6 marks). This will take up to two weeks to complete.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Captain Saynna Stormrunner|Our original duty binds us to defend this land, but if Fandral has indeed escaped to the Firelands, then we must bring him to justice.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Saynna Stormrunner|Sisters, show yourselves. The time for subtlety is past. We will face our enemies in the Plane of Fire.}}
:''Several Shadow Wardens destealth.''
:{{text|say|Captain Saynna Stormrunner|See you on the field of battle, <brother/sister>.}}
:''The wardens teleport out.''

Matoclaw offers the followup quest, [[The Hunt Begins (Mount Hyjal)]], directing players back through the portal to the [[Molten Front]].
