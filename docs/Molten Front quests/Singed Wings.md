==Objectives==
Rescue 5 Injured [[Druids of the Talon]] on [[Fireplume Peak]].
*Druids of the Talon rescued x5
*[[Arthorn's Injury Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
Many of our Storm Crows have gone ahead to scout the peak and attempt to retrieve some of the fire hawk eggs, but to very little success I'm afraid. The thermals make it nearly impossible to fly safely, and the [[fire hawk]]s aren't exactly friendly either.

I need you to head over there and rescue any druids that you can. I've got splints, bandages, burn salves, smelling salts... anything you'll need to get them back on their feet, assuming they're still alive. Please hurry and help anyone you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{coppercost|94000}}
*69400 XP (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)

==Progress==
There must be more of them alive over there... it's just a matter of finding them.

==Completion==
Several of our brothers and sisters passed by while returning to the safety of the [[Sentinel Tree]]. You did very well out there, <name>. Thank you.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies in the area before heading out.

Getting across to the Fireplume Peak involves platforming across floating rocks that will break apart on occasion. Not all is lost if players misjudge a jump, however, as a friendly druid of the talon will save hapless players from falling to their deaths before dropping them off on Fireplume Peak.

Wounded druids are all over the island. They merely need to be right clicked upon in order to be healed.

*{{text|say|These are harsher skies than any of us could have known.}}
*{{text|say|Thank you, <class>.  I might have died out here if not for you.}}
*{{text|say|The [[Fire Hawk Matriarch|matriarch]] knocked me right out of the sky.  I'm lucky to be alive.}}
*{{text|say|These thermals have made flying here nearly suicidal.  Thank you for coming for us.}}
*{{text|say|I might have escaped if I hadn't got caught in one of the thermals...}}
*{{text|say|It will be some time before I can recover from these injures{{sic}}.  Still, I'm glad to be alive.}}
*{{text|say|You have my thanks.  Stay safe, <class>.}}

Heal five, finish up other tasks, then return to camp. To get back to the mainland, head to the southeast side of the island, where at {{co|29.3|52.8|Molten Front}} is a thermal vent that will launch back that direction.
