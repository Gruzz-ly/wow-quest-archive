==Objectives==
Kill [[fire elemental]]s next to Aggra's Air Totem, on the western edge of [[Ragnaros' Reach|the plateau]], until it activates. Then continue to Aggra's Water Totem, Aggra's Earth Totem, and Aggra's Fire Totem.
*Activate Aggra's totems to save Thrall

==Description==
The totems, <name>! We need to activate them, or Go'el is lost!

Kill the elementals next to each of my totems, located around the edges of this plateau. Once all four totems are activated, we should be able to free the last piece of Go'el's soul!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*104100 XP (or {{coppercost|248050}} at max level)
*+500 [[reputation]] with the [[Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
Despite all odds, Thrall has been saved. Aggra was right to hold out hope for the world-shaman.
