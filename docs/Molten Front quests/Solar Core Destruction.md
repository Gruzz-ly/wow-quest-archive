==Objectives==
Detonate the [[Solar Core]].
*Solar Core detonated

==Description==
The fight has taken us to [[Fandral Staghelm|Fandral's]] doorstep. [[Druids of the Flame|His druids]] are channeling energies of the [[Firelands]] into a vessel called the Solar Core.

Should this vessel detonate on [[Azeroth]], none of us will have a home to return to.

We need to strike at the Solar Core now, while it is still vulnerable. You can find the infernal device to the northeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
If we do not stop it now, the Solar Core will only grow more powerful with each day.

==Completion==
It is destroyed? Good. I doubt this will deter Fandral for long, but we must gain every advantage we can muster.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies at the Forlorn Spire before heading out. While out and about, kill a [[Druid of the Flame]] and it will drop a [[Dried Acorn]] on the ground. It starts [[The Mysterious Seed]].

The Solar Core is found at {{co|70.8|38.2|Molten Front}} the northeast end of the [[Widow's Clutch]], at a camp called [[Wildflame Point]]. It is surrounded by four Druids of the Flame. Kill at least one, get close to the center taking care not to aggro the others &mdash; they have a large aggro radius &mdash; and blow the core. The explosion will launch the player 100 yards away to {{co|65.9|39.0|Molten Front}} on top of a spire. Jump down, mount up and return to base.

==Progression==
