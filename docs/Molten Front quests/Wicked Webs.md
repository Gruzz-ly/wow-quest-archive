==Objectives==
Free 8 victims out of [[Cinderweb Cocoon]]s.
*Victims freed (8)

==Description==
Some of our scouts have not reported back for duty. We fear they have succumbed to the deadly spiders in the vicinity.

Hope may not be lost, however. The spiders often wrap up their live prey in cocoons for later consumption.

Go search the pillars to the north for cocooned victims. You may yet be able to save some of our brethren.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Have you found any survivors?

==Completion==
Our lost allies have already made it back. They are shaken, but alive. Thank you for rescuing them.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies at the Forlorn Spire before heading out. While out and about, kill a [[Druid of the Flame (mob)|Druid of the Flame]] and it will drop a [[Dried Acorn]] on the ground. It starts [[The Mysterious Seed]].

Cinderweb Cocoons are red spider webs found lining the walls of the [[Widow's Clutch]]. Do enough damage to "kill" it and a [[Captured Hyjal Druid]] will pop out:

* {{text|say|Thank you.  I'll be sure to slay a few spiders on my way back to camp.}}
* {{text|say|Thanks for getting me out of there!  That was awful.}}
* {{text|say|Thank you!  Now to see about this burning sensation...}}
* {{text|say|You don't want to know what it was like in there.}}
* {{text|say|You have my thanks, friend.}}
* {{text|say|S-s-s-st-sticky....}}
* {{text|say|Thank you for freeing me.  I thought I was done for.}}
