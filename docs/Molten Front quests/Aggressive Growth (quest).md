==Objectives==
Plant 5 Smothervine Seeds in the Ash Piles in the [[Ashen Fields]].
*Smothervine planted x5
*[[Smothervine Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
Our warriors are doing everything they can to hold back the elementals, but their numbers are endless. We need to do something to slow down the assault.

Find some suitable patches of dirt or ash out on the Ashen Fields to our north and plant these seeds. They will grow deadly vines that may slow down our enemies a bit. It's not much, but every bit helps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{coppercost|94000}}
*69400 XP (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Did you find some places to plant them? I realize it's a bit barren out there.

==Completion==
We will win this battle. Whatever it takes, we will not let these elementals back into Hyjal.

==Notes==
[[Ash Pile]]s can be found beyond the front line. They are not in short supply. Grow five Smothervine and return to Rayne.

==Progression==
