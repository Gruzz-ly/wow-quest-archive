The quest '''A Bitter Pill''' is part of the [[Firelands Invasion]], and is a daily quest occasionally offered by [[Ricket]] once the character has completed [[Well Armed]].

==Objectives==
Find the Subterranean Magma Worm's breath bubbles, then defeat it by making it swallow the Bitter Pill. 
* [[Subterranean Magma Worm]] slain
* [[The Bitter Pill]] (provided)

==Description==
As far as I'm concerned, there's no problem that can't be solved with bombs. And if a bomb doesn't solve your problem on the first try... use a bigger bomb.

So there's this big worm that's been eating people near the lava pools up north. Search for breath bubbles to find it. Attack it until it prepares to bite, then place this bomb down in front of it. Then sit back and watch the fireworks.

Hmm... there was one other thing I wanted to say... oh yeah! Don't get eaten.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 69,400 [[XP]]
* {{cost|16|54}}
* [[Mark of the World Tree]] x2
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
I see you haven't been eaten yet.  This is good.

==Completion==
Ah knew Ricket's bombs'd come in handy.  Twas just a matter ah findin' somethin' big enough to explode.

==Notes==
The Subterranean Magma Worm is the Super-sized version of the [[Lava Burster]] encountered on days that [[Breach in the Defenses]] is offered.  Much like the smaller [[lava worm]]s, it produces a lava shower in an arc in front of it.  As might be expected, getting hit by it hurts more than getting showered by a Lava Burster.

After some time in combat, the worm will start casting ''Burning Hunger'' (7 second cast time).  At the same time, a blue caret will appear nearby and you will get a system warning
* {{text|say|The worm is about to bite!  Place the bomb down now!}}
Go to the indicated place and use the Bitter Pill.  When the worm finishes casting Burning Hunger, its head will come down to the indicated spot (and if the bomb is there, it will eat it).  When the worm eats the pill, a countdown will start:
* {{text|say|3...}}
* {{text|say|2...}}
* {{text|say|1...}}
After which, the worm's head will be blown off, the worm will gyrate in agony for a moment before slumping in death.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.2.0|note=Added.}}
