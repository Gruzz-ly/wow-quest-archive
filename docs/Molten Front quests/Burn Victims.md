==Objectives==
Heal 8 Wounded Hyjal Defenders.
*[[Wounded Hyjal Defender]] saved x8
*[[Enchanted Salve]] (provided)

==Description==
We have warriors out in the field who are falling wounded, and many of our druids are too busy fighting to give them proper aid. I need you to go to the north, towards the [[Ashen Fields]], and tend their wounds at least enough that they can make it back to safety.

If you haven't any bandages or healing spells, I had [[Rayne Feathersong|Rayne]] put together this salve, which should prove sufficient to get them on their feet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{coppercost|94000}}
*69400 XP (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
To our fortune, [[Ragnaros]]' forces far more often injure our warriors than outright kill them. Their attacks naturally cauterize the wounds they inflict. It's very painful, but it's better than death.

==Completion==
I saw several of our warriors make it back to safety shortly after you departed. It seems your efforts were quite effective. Thank you.

==Notes==
Wounded Hyjal Defenders are literally called that, and can be found beyond the front line. Use the salve to heal them. It can be used while mounted.
If you are a healing class, you can also heal the Defenders using your spells. If you have an instant heal, this will mean you can avoid the cast time, and can heal Defenders whilst on the run.
