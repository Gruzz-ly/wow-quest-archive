==Objectives==
Bring [[Anren Shadowseeker]] to the entrance of the Molten Front.
*Escort Anren to the front of the cave

==Description==
Need... water... badly...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|94000}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x5

==Completion==
You! You're the one who saved Anren. My best friend, Anren.

We got separated in that cave. I didn't know what to do without Anren.

You are a resourceful <class>. We may call upon you later to assist us in our reconnaissance missions. With your help, Anren and I might no longer face the terrifying risk of being separated from one another.

==Notes==
After completing [[Into the Fire]] and landing in the [[Molten Flow]], [[Thisalee Crow]] offers a few daily quests that send players afield in the flow. At the northern end of the cave system is Anren Shadowseeker, who offers this escort quest.

It is highly advisable to clear the northern part of the cave and down the path to the west up to the thermal vent in the middle of the cave before attempting this escort.

Speak with him again after accepting:
:Tholo... is that you?
{{gossip|''Here's some water, Anren. Let's get you out of this cave.''}}
:{{text|say|Anren Shadowseeker|While I already feel better, I am not yet ready for combat. I will need you to escort me.}}
Anren starts hopping along the rocks above the lava back to the main track.
:{{text|say|Anren Shadowseeker|I am worried about Tholo.}}
:{{text|say|Anren Shadowseeker|This first part is the toughest. Once we get to the thermal vents, the path will be much clearer.}}
Anren only has 15,475 health at the beginning, so he cannot take many hits. He does heal out of combat like players, though. Anren will run at his own pace from his original location up north down the western wall to the first flame vent at {{co|46.0|47.8|Molten Front}} halfway up the length of the cave.
:{{text|say|Anren Shadowseeker|Here is the first vent! Face the ledge, then jump! The heated air currents will do the rest.}}
Anren demonstrates. Quickly follow him.
:{{text|say|Anren Shadowseeker|Just face the ledge, and jump!}}
Jump again, then take the third vent.
:{{text|yell|Anren Shadowseeker|I'm on my way, Tholo!}}
After the third vent players and Tholo are back on the main path, so it's possible there may be more fighting as a Flamewaker Sentinel does path through the area. Tholo will quickly run south to the next thermal vent to get back up to safety, though.
:{{text|say|Anren Shadowseeker|We're nearly there now.}}
Three vents after that, players and Tholo land near the southern part of the cave where Thisalee and safety can be found.
:{{text|say|Anren Shadowseeker|Thank you. I must go find Tholo, my fellow druid and treasured friend.}}
:{{text|say|Anren Shadowseeker|If you find yourself in this cave again, do not forget about the thermal vents. They may help you escape some tight situations.}}

Task complete, wrap up the daily quests down in the flow, then head south to the entrance and jump to get to the surface. Circle around to the northwest to find [[Tholo Whitehoof]] and Anren, now mounted, at {{co|36.0|59.0|Molten Front}} standing nearby.
