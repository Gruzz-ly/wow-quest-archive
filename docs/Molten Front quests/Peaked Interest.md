==Objectives==
Retrieve a Fire Hawk Egg from the top of [[Fireplume Peak]].
*[[Fire Hawk Egg]]

==Description==
These [[fire hawk]]s are beings of fire, but they exhibit much of the same behavior that we've seen in birds back home.  It makes me wonder from where they originate.

Back to the point - I think we might be able to train them.  Domesticate them if you will.  Use them against our enemies.

I'd like you to retrieve one of their eggs from the top of Fireplume Peak.  If you can bring it back to me safely, I will see to the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{coppercost|94000}}
*69400 XP (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Were you able to recover an egg?

==Completion==
This will do perfectly!  Come see me again in a day or two and we'll see how things have progressed.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies in the area before heading out.

Getting across to the Fireplume Peak involves platforming across floating rocks that will break apart on occasion. Not all is lost if players misjudge a jump, however, as a friendly druid of the talon will save hapless players from falling to their deaths before dropping them off on Fireplume Peak:
:{{text|say|Druid of the Talon|You're far too important to us to be lost that easily.}}
or
:{{text|say|Druid of the Talon|Going up.}}

Head to the center of Fireplume Peak. On the peak around {{co|23.1|41.1|Molten Front}} is a lava pool and a decent number of eggs. Snag one.
:{{text|bossemote|The Fire Hawk Matriarch screams in rage at your theft.}}

She's a level 85 elite with 232,000 health, and will aggro on the player that instant.

She has the following ability outside of basic melee:
*{{abilities|Orb of Fire|range=10-40|Inflicts Fire damage to an enemy.|notes=2 sec cast. Summons an orb of fire underneath the player's position which will explode for ~25,000 Fire after a few seconds.}}

If you do not wish to fight her, simply jump down to the lower tiers; by the second or first, you should be able to get outside her aggro range.

Finish up and head back to base. To get back to the mainland, head to the southeast side of the island, where at {{co|29.3|52.8|Molten Front}} is a thermal vent that will launch back that direction.

==Progression==
{{Druids of the Talon}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2011-07-14|bluenote=Players should no longer experience performance issues when the Fire Hawk Egg Carry Ping spell is cast}}
*{{Patch 4.2.0|note=Added.}}
