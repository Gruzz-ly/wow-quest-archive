'''Hounds of Shannox''' is a [[daily quest]] on the [[Molten Front]] unlocked after completing the one-time [[escort quest]] [[Need... Water... Badly...]], itself unlocked by acquiring the services of the [[Druids of the Talon]] for [[Mark of the World Tree]] x150 in [[Druids of the Talon (quest)]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 6 small piles of Houndbone Ash.
*[[Houndbone Ash]] (6)

==Description==
On the [[Firelands]]' largest island, our troops have been having trouble against [[Shannox]], the [[flamewaker|flamewaker hunter]].  Not only does he have impeccable aim, but he keeps trained hounds that give our troops no end of trouble.

[[Tholo Whitehoof|Tholo]], in all his wisdom, thinks it would be a good idea to study the biology of these hounds.  I, of course, agree with Tholo.

You will find several hounds in the [[Molten Flow]], beneath the [[Furnace]].  We will need their ashes to study.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1
*{{coppercost|94000}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Any information we can get will be instrumental in helping our men defeat Shannox.

==Completion==
This ash may seem indistinguishable from any other type of ash you find on this [[Molten Front|forsaken island]], but trust me... you have found the right stuff.

We will have it analyzed immediately.

Return again soon.  While I do enjoy spending time with [[Anren Shadowseeker|Anren]], we also appreciate your company, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Flamewakers of the Molten Flow]] and [[Fire Flowers]] before heading out.  The charhounds are easily the weakest mobs in the Molten Flow.

There are charhound pets that always accompany the flamewaker hunters and will pull with them.  There is also a cave area of two rooms off to the left where charhounds sleep in groups of two to four.  A hunter or two also patrol this area.

Once you get the last item, Anren and Tholo will have relocated back to [[Malfurion's Breach]].  Turn in to Tholo there.  You may also turn in [[Fire Flowers]] to [[Rayne Feathersong]] nearby at the same time, instead of [[Choluna]].
