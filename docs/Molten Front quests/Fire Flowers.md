==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Luciferns.
*[[Lucifern]] (5)

==Description==
My fellow druid, [[Choluna]], has asked us to collect any specimens of plant life that we might find here in the [[Firelands]]...

...I don't know whose idea it was to bring scholars to a [[Molten Front|warfront]].

Nevertheless, you will already be in the cave - [[Flamewakers of the Molten Flow|killing things]] - so be on the lookout for anything growing out of the ground.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2
*{{coppercost|94000}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
They could be growing anywhere. Keep your eyes open.

==Completion==
These things never cease to amaze me. Whether they're actual plants, or just delicate stone formations, the fact that they can grow in such hostile conditions astounds me.

I'll have these sent to [[Avrilla]] for analysis right away.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Flamewakers of the Molten Flow]] before heading out.

While out killing things, look for flame vents rising out of the ground. Jump in them to get to higher ledges to find the Luciferns. They can also be found on small rocks in and around the lava.

All the way at the north end of the cave at {{co|51.9|31.0|Molten Front}} is [[Anren Shadowseeker]]. He offers [[Need... Water... Badly...]], a one-time escort quest taking him from his spot at the northern end of the cave, fighting through half of the cave, then leaping via thermal vents back to the entrance. Completing that escort unlocks [[How Hot]] from [[Tholo Whitehoof]] on the surface, and [[Hounds of Shannox]] from Anren down in the Molten Flow, standing opposite from [[Thisalee Crow]]. 

Choluna can be found back on the surface. After completing the kill quest, head back to the entrance of the Molten Flow and jump to get back to the surface, then circle around to the northwest to find the advance druid party.

A secondary turn in is [[Rayne Feathersong]] back at the Sentinel Tree; you may want to do that instead, if you're heading that way first to turn in [[Hounds of Shannox]] to Tholo Whitehoof.
