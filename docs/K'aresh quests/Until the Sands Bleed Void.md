==Objectives==
Kill [[Shadowguard]] in [[Shadow Point]] on [[K'aresh]].
* Shadowguard extinguished (0/100%)

==Description==
I have fought Shadowguard on [[Eredath]], [[Telogrus]], and now on K'aresh. They are a thorn that should be plucked from the cosmos.

That they should follow the very monster that threatened their world proves they are a scourge. Though, perhaps I am no better, fighting alongside [[Xal'atath]]. 

I will grapple with that contradiction later. For now, I intend for us to put an end to them, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Locket of the Final Purge]]
*[[Void-Reckoning Necklace]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Spare no remorse for their kind. They would do far worse.

==Completion==
Is this the fate of the [[Void elf|ren'dorei]]? Given long enough, will we too serve the very forces we fight today? I had always looked to Locus-Walker as an example we can emulate, but it appears the ren'dorei must find their own path.

==Notes==
Accept all three quests:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We need to destroy the Shadowguard or their army will overrun us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|Call upon Narathe in battle if you need aid.}}
:''[[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Locus-Walker]], [[Soul-Scribe]], [[Narathe]], and [[Xal'atath]] depart.''

Fill the bar up by slaying the [[Shadowguard Voidcaller]] (6%), [[Shadowguard Adept (K'aresh)|Shadowguard Adept]] (9%), [[Observer (K'aresh)|Observer]], [[Shadowguard Bulwark]] (9%), [[Shadowguard Phaseblade (K'aresh)|Shadowguard Phaseblade]], & the [[Shadowguard Colossus]] (15%).

All over [[Shadow Point]], defeat enemies, interact with [[Shadowguard Power Pylon]]s, and rescue the 6 [[Captured Wastelander]]s.

During the three quests, [[Narathe]] accompanies the party:
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|We will be oracles again!}}

Head to [[Shadow Point: Torment]] where [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Locus-Walker]], [[Soul-Scribe]], and [[Narathe]] awaited and turn in the three quests.
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|A trained mind can withstand the Void. This manaforge untethers the soul, then binds it to Dimensius.}}
