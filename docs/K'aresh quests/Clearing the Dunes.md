'''Clearing the Dunes''' begins the optional "Of Boughs and Bonds" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] alongside [[Bridge to Nowhere]]. Find [[Om'fennad]] at [[Hosaas' Rest]] on the south shore of the western island of [[K'aresh]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Slay 8 dune creatures.
* Dunes cleared (8)

==Description==
The deserts here were never safe, but there was still beauty--birdsong, herds of animals, and the desert would bloom from horizon to horizon after a storm.

Now it's a wasteland. I barely took two steps off the docks before being chased by some monster. I need to get out there. If you could cull the worst of those creatures, I'd feel much safer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Is it safe yet?

==Completion==
It seems only the most vicious creatures survive outside of the eco-domes. When we find my sister, I'll bring her back to Tazavesh where it's safe.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|Oh dear! This is far worse than I expected.}}

Valid targets include [[Dustback Burrower]]s and [[Slitwing Hunter]]s.

==Progression==
{{Of Boughs and Bonds}}
