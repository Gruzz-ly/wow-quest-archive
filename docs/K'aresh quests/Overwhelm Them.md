'''Overwhelm Them''' begins the optional "On a Technicality" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] alongside [[Mandatory Time Off]]. Find [[Associate Xy'nell]] outside the [[Xy Imports Offices]] in northeastern Tazavesh to begin. This chapter awards 500 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and Explorer 1 legs.

Both of these quests are revisited in the world quest [[Overwhelm Them with Mandatory Time Off]].

==Objectives==
Break 8 Xy Imports Crates on the docks in [[Tazavesh]].
*[[Broker Crate|Crates]] broken (8)

==Description==
There's an audit coming up. My employer, Xy Imports, will be audited. Again.

<[[Associate Xy'nell|Xy'nell]] visibly shakes, ducking his head.>

I need this audit to go badly. It must be worse than the last.

Can you help me? We have a shipment of small [[devourer]]s that would cause a lot of trouble if they were to escape or go missing.

Break open their crates. Business needs to be overwhelmed just like last time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Please don't worry. This will only create a temporary bottleneck for businesses that need these supplies.

They'll likely profit in the short term from high demand for their goods.

==Completion==
Good. Good. Things are in disarray. This is a start.

Perhaps you're just the measure of mayhem I needed to pull this off.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|I can't let anyone else make the oath. I have to do something...}}

Before accepting any quests, Xy'nell has this to say:
{{dialogue|Something must be done...

<Xy'nell seems to notice you.>

Oh, sorry. May I help you?}}

Pick up a quest and he says:
{{dialogue|You can still see my boss around the corner, right? He hasn't moved?

Good.

{{gossip|Why do you want your business to fail?}}

I don't want the business to fail. I need it to suffer a hiccup.

If we inflict a little chaos now, I can restore everything at the end. When you see what the coordinator is doing, maybe you will understand.

<Xy'nell's voice is on edge.>

I would be acting against my oath as an employee if I made the business fail.

{{gossip|I understand.}}}}

Pick up both quests:
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|With the pressure you and I are going to create, not even my coworkers will be able to keep up.}}
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|Let's be sure they are kept out of the plan.}}

Head northeast outside to [[Xy Imports Receiving]] and get to work breaking crates and placing devices.

After completing both tasks, head back to Xy'nell:
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|Xy'vim, you are behind on your duties. I expect better from my employees.}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'vim|I'm sorry, Coordinator Xy'thir, but a shipment of devourer mites has gone awry!}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'mern|Our workers are vanishing from their positions, coordinator. They need time to rest!}}
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|Your excuses belie your incompetence. Fix this mess before I am forced to intervene.}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'mern|Yes, coordinator.}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'vim|Yes, coordinator.}}

==Progression==
{{On a Technicality}}
