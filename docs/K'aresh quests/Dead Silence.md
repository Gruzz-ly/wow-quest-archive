==Objectives==
Find the scouts at [[Overlook Zo'shuul]].
*[[Scout Lo'shah|Lo'shah]] found
*[[Scout Yanhal|Yanhal]] found
*[[Scout Raz'ida|Raz'ida]] found

==Description==
[[Dimensius]]'s power is so great that even shattered, his aura radiates a power debilitating to mortal life. It is why the K'areshi were changed to beings of energy--it was the only way we could survive his presence.

I had hoped my scouts could find a path that was safe for you and your compatriots to enter the manafoge. Raz'ida, Lo'shah, and Yanhal should have met us by now. Find them for me. Their information is vital to our defense against the All-Devouring.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Coif of the Lost Trust]]
*[[Cowl of the Lost Trust]]
*[[Helm of the Lost Trust]]
*[[Hood of the Lost Trust]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Raz'ida was a [[Shadowguard]] agent? I've trusted her for thousands of years. How did they break her loyalty?

If she could be turned, then any of the Trust's agents could as well. It is vital that we get the information about their base, and we can only rely upon the four of us to do so.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and the champion need to enter the [[Manaforge Omega|manaforge]] if we are to destroy the All-Devouring.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|It is dangerous. My scouts search for a means to get you and your allies inside.}}

Head to the edge where Lo'shah's remains are.
{{Dialogue|<This ethereal's wrappings have traces of void energy swirling around them. A quick search reveals a hidden, ripped pocket--its contents gone.>}}

Go behind [[Ka'barin]]'s area where Yanhal's remains are found.
{{Dialogue|<This ethereal's wrappings are enveloped by swirls of void energy. The ripped wrappings point to the possibility that this was caused by a sharp blade. There is no sign of a fight--they might have been surprised by the attacker.>}}

Head to the ledge where Raz'ida is found, but she's hostile!
:{{Text|Say|Raz'ida|The Shadowguard keep their secrets!}}

Defeat her:
:{{Text|Say|Raz'ida|My life... for Dimensius...}}

Return to Locus-Walker to turn in.

New gossip on return:
{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|How did we get to this? All that she has done to us, and she is our best ally?

<Alleria clenches her jaw as her gaze shifts to Locus-Walker.>}}

{{Dialogue|title=Xal'atath|What a shameful loss.

Locus-Walker must keep a tighter leash on his minions, don't you think?}}
