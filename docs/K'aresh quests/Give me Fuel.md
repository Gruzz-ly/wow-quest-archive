'''Give me Fuel''' begins the optional "Anyway, Here's Firewall" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Assistant Engineer Om'vek]] at [[Eco-Dome: Primus]] to begin. This chapter awards 350 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and Explorer 1 rings. 

==Objectives==
Gather Firebud Pollen for [[Assistant Engineer Om'vek|Om'vek]].
*[[Firebud Pollen]] (8)

==Description==
Thank you for coming, <name>.

There are many dangers we face when attempting to terraform K'aresh, not the least of which is attracting creatures that see the domes as convenient energy sources.

Eco-Dome: Springhost is plagued with them. I have a plan to remedy this, but I could use your help preparing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered enough pollen for me?

==Completion==
Perfect, <class>. With our equipment, we'll be able to unlock the power within this humble plant.

==Notes and trivia==
On approach:

Loot [[Firebud]] plants in the area for their pollen. More drop from the [[Flametouched Ray]]s that occasionally appear.
