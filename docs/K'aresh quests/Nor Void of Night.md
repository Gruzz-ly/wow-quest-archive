Sorry for the mess. The mailroom is literally overflowing with undelivered mail. Help!

Do you think while you're out and about you could drop some off at various locations around K'aresh? Let's see here. I've got [[Hosaas' Rest]], [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]], [[Shan'dorah]]... and of course, [[The Oasis]] on the list.

Oh gosh. Thank you so much for doing this, <name>!
