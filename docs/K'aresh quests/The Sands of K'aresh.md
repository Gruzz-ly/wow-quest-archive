==Objectives==
Collect 3 Weapons Caches from the nearby sands of the [[Shatter Gorge]] on [[K'aresh]].
* [[Shadowguard Weapon]]s (3)
* [[Wastes Scanner]] (provided)

==Description==
My people have fought across every inch of the ruins of our world. We gave our oath to [[Nexus-King Salhadaar|King Salhadaar]] and he rewarded us by sending the [[Shadowguard]] to hunt us down.

Salhadaar is long dead, but we knew the Shadowguard would return. In the long years that followed, we secreted caches of weapons so we would always be able to raise a blade in defiance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered all of the weapons caches in the sand?

==Completion==
These will do. They are still as sharp as ever. I will arm my people and your allies. For K'aresh, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|The Shadowguard have begun their attack. This will be the first test of of our untrusting coalition.}}
:''[[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Soul-Scribe]], [[Locus-Walker]], [[Narathe]], and [[Xal'atath]] head out.''
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|The Shadowguard will not prevail this day. We fight so K'aresh may live.}}

Walk in the direction that fills the bar and follow the sparks, then interact with the revealed [[Sand Pile]]s to collect the Shadowguard Weapons using the [[Wastes Scanner]].

Once that is done, head southwest to Alleria and the party to turn in both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|While you fought, we scouted the Shadowguard. They must have a Reshii Ribbon.}}
