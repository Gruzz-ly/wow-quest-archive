==Objectives==
Speak with the volunteers to test the [[New Energy Drink|new energy drink]].
*[[Hips]] tests drink
*[[Riftwalker Ailaya]] tests drink
*Drink tested on [[Bakishroth]]

==Description==
Since I never doubted our success, I took the liberty of making further preparations.

I have arranged for a couple of volunteers. I want to see our new energy drink in action before you imbibe it, <name>. May I call you <name>? Of course I can. We're partners now.

You will find the volunteers lounging on the high terraces of the city. [[Tazavesh]] has many such comfortable areas for visitors like yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We are both certain to profit from this venture, <name>, regardless of the outcome.

==Completion==
Destroy the city?! You must help me quickly and quietly deal with this... *ahem* situation, partner.

Have I become that which I sought to oppose?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|You'll find the riftwalker and the dredger amongst their own on the terraces.}}
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|I've paid them in advance. Let us see how they like our new drink.}}

:{{Text|say|Hips|Ya! Last I seen, it's still full o' corpses.}}

Speak with Hips:

:''Hips burbs Azerite.''
:{{Text|say|Evaile|What in the [[Great Dark Beyond]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Hips|I'm not sure what ta think 'bout that. A bit metal. A bit nutty.}}
:{{Text|say|Hips|Feels like I could pound tha drums all night, but other 'an that, I don' feel no differen'.}}

[[File:Market Research - Riftwalkers.jpg|thumb|Riftwalkers.]]
The [[Riftwalkers]] are at {{Co|31.75|43.81|Tazavesh||1}} on the roof deck in the northwest:
:{{Text|say|[[Riftwalker Tarrowyn]]|I don't know about this, Ailaya. We need to be going.}}
:{{Text|say|Riftwalker Ailaya|They should be here any moment. Besides, I gave my word to that broker that I would help.}}

Speak with Ailaya:
{{Dialogue|
Hello. Ba'kril said you would arrive with the drink.

When I volunteered, I didn't know Tarrowyn and Eiteiri were going to want to continue my training so soon. I thought I had at least another day.

Well, I made an agreement and I keep my word. Let's get to it.

{{Gossip|quest=|<Give Riftwalker Ailaya the new energy drink.>}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Riftwalker Ailaya|No time like the present. Let's get this over with.}}
:''She downs the drink. The other Riftwalkers jump out of their seats.''
:{{Text|say|Riftwalker Tarrowyn|Ailaya, what have you done?}}
:{{Text|say|Riftwalker Ailaya|Wow, so much [[Void]] energy!}}
:{{Text|say|Riftwalker Ailaya|I definitely feel more powerful. But it tastes horrible!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Riftwalker Eiteiri]]|Rash. You need better judgement if you're to be one of us, trainee.}}
:{{Text|say|Riftwalker Tarrowyn|The last thing we need is to make things difficult for [[Alleria]].}}
:{{Text|say|Riftwalker Tarrowyn|We'll leave for [[Shan'dorah]] as soon as you compose yourself, Ailaya.}}
:{{Text|say|Riftwalker Ailaya|Apologies. It won't happen again.}}

After both have tested the drink, Ba'kril chimes in:
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|This is not going as I'd hoped. We need to change things up.}}
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|There's a creature caged just outside my apartment. Let's see how it reacts to the drink.}}

{{Gossip|quest=|<Feed the new energy drink to Bakishroth.>}}
}}
:''Bakishroth is enlarged and empowered, his magical shield dissipating. The nearby [[Limned Purrkin]] prounces off and the Cartel Zo [[Tazavesh Security]] vanishes.'' <!-- looks like he just vanished, definitely worth checking later/in live. -->
:{{Text|yell|Bakishroth|THE POWER!}}
:{{Text|say|Bakishroth the Empowered|Time to free the others and destroy your city.}}
:''Bakishroth floats away.''
