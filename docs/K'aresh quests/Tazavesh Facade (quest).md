==Objectives==
15 Shadowguard Essence scanned.
*Shadowguard Essence scanned (15)
*[[Essence Scanner]] (provided)

==Description==
To create the perfect Tazavesh facade, you must scan live [[Shadowguard]] around [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]] with a device I will provide you. This device will mark the targets, allowing you to copy the unique essence that is the core of their being and store it for our use. This is dangerous business, as you will have to approach them directly and see if they're willing to be scanned!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*[[Tazavesh Facade]]

==Progress==
Did you finish those scans?

==Completion==
The criminal elements in Tazavesh don't like being scanned. It's not often I see someone return with a full scanner.

==Progression==
{{A Key Threat}}
