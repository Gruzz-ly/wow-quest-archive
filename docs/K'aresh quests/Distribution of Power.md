==Objectives==
Collect and distribute harvested energy in and around [[Castigaar|the Wastelander Camp]].
* [[Harvested Energy|Energy Collected]] (4)
* [[Empty Crate (K'aresh)|Crates]] charged (4)

==Description==
My people need energy to live. We can harvest it from the pylons that were set out to collect it or hunt the energy scavengers that have siphoned off what is ours.

Let's gather today's meager bounty of energy and then distribute it to my people. If we are to go to war together, it will help us both to know the character of your allies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
In the Wastes of Merciless K'aresh, survival is all important. We take what we need to ensure our future.

==Completion==
Your help does not go unnoticed. My people will live another day, and hopefully many more, thanks to the energy that's in those crates.

==Notes==
While on [[Stalking Stalkers]], [[Narathe]] also offers this quest.

On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|I will follow you and observe. If you can forage as well as you can fight, you are of worth to us.}}

Kill [[Crackling Wyrm]]s for their [[Harvested Energy]] as well as the [[Power Harvester]]s that are found in the [[Merciless Wastes]]. 

Near pylons, Narathe will call them out:
*{{Text|Say|Narathe|There's a pylon here.}}
*{{Text|Say|Narathe|Let's harvest that pylon.}}
*{{Text|Say|Narathe|My people need the energy from these pylons to survive.}}

Near [[Qaishaa]]:
:{{Text|Say|Qaishaa|Who is Soul-Scribe talking to? That woman's voice haunted me since the [[Dimensius|Devouring]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|[[Xal'atath|The Harbinger]] is back. The All-Devouring rises again. Soul-Scribe reflects upon our oaths for guidance.}}

{{dialogue|title=Qaishaa|Our lives as oracles are like a distant dream. I only really remember flickers of it, and can't seem to grasp hold of that time. It slips away like sand on the breeze.

{{gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I am the head of the Soulbinders, Qaishaa. I spin threads of energy in defense of our people--and when on the offensive, against out enemies

There is no one else in our camp who is better than me at planning and executing raids across the wastes.

Near [[Farena]]:
:{{Text|Say|Farena|More of these domes appear. We should raze each of them to the ground! Make the Ravel pay for returning to the world they destroyed!}}
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|We are no longer oath-bound to [[Nexus-King Salhadaar|King Salhadaar]]. This stranger brings hope for K'aresh. Our vendetta can wait.}}

{{dialogue|title=Farena|Narathe clings to the past. She's like that one grain of sand that's somewhere in your wrappings and you can't find it. She's always nagging about how things used to be. I gave up who I was thousands of years ago.

The now is more important, when every day is a struggle.

{{gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I am Farena, a smith and technician. It's on me to keep our weapons working, charged, and as deadly as possible.

There's nothing I can't fix. Not that I'd fix anything of yours.
}}}}

Near [[Lash'ir]]:
:{{Text|Say|Lash'ir|The metal from that destroyed dome is strong. Uncorrupted by the Void. It will make fine blades.}}
:{{text|say|Narathe|Good. We will need many blades for the Shadowguard, if the stranger and their companion speaks the truth. Or for that Ravel city if they lie.}}

{{dialogue|title=Lash'ir|Narathe is wrapped too tightly. We are doing what we must to survive out here. Soul-Scribe knows this.

She also knows that we don't need any allies. We haven't joined forces with anyone since Salhadaar bound us to our oath.

No one is eager to go down that path again.

{{gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|You are speaking with Lash'ir, Soul-Scribe's personal guard. I am here to keep an eye on you while you stumble around on the sands.
}}}}

Near [[Jayaan]]:
:{{Text|Say|Jayaan|Why does this Ravel collaborator remain tethered to their soul? Fulfill your oath and scavenge their bones.}}
:{{text|say|Narathe|This stranger brings word of K'aresh. Which oath binds you? Dead King Salhadaar's, or the Worldsoul's?}}

{{dialogue|title=Jayaan|Survival is all that matters our here in the wastes. That, and our oath to protect K'aresh.

We will do anything to achieve that end.

{{gossip|Who are you?}}

{{Dialogue-child|I am the arms master, Jayaan. When I was an oracle, I specialized in interpreting the will of K'aresh based on nature. He was in the shape of the clouds, bird flight patterns, the way leaves would turn over before a large storm.

I tended to the gardens, growing herbs and flowers we used in the Tabiqa ritual. Back when the voice of K'aresh would ring through us all.

Now, I train our people in the ways of the blade.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}

{{gossip|What is the Tabiqa ritual?

{{Dialogue-child|
The Tabiqa is... was a ritual which allowed us to commune with K'aresh and to reaffirm our oaths with him. After years of study and trials to attune your body and mind to his voice, an oracle was able to hear the song of our Worldsoul.

I can almost remember his voice. I think it was deep, and powerful. 

He is gone now, though. So the ritual is no longer performed. Our oaths remain, however.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}}}}}

After charging the 4 Crates:
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|Now you know of our harsh existence. Return to Soul-Scribe. She will decide your fate.}}

Return to Soul-Scribe to turn in both quest after you charge the crates.
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|The domes are a Ravel construct. They try to tame the Untamed. Merciless K'aresh is gone.}}
