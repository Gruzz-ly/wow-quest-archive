'''Phase-Lost Adventurer''' concludes the optional "Untethered Potential" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Researcher Essarae]] at [[Shan'dorah]] to begin. While on that quest, players will kill a [[Phase-Lost Creeper]] in [[Voidscar Cavern]] that drops the [[Half-Digested Journal]] which starts this quest.

==Objectives==
Take the journal to [[Researcher Essarae]] in [[Shan'dorah]].
*[[Half-Digested Journal]]

==Description==
Covered in slime and saliva, the journal bears a partial entry of a previous Phase Diver.

<Day 27

[[Untethered Space]] is much more vast than I expected, with monsters stronger than I have seen on [[K'aresh]].

There is a nearby cave I will explore tomorrow. It is brimming with [[:Phase-Altered Essence]]. This could bode useful for better understanding the ecology out here.>

Researcher Essarae would be very interested in this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Essarae flips to a random page in the journal.>

This is brimming with knowledge of Untethered Space. I would like to read it further.

Thank you for aiding my research.
