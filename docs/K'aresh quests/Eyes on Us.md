==Objectives==
Speak with [[Port Authority Zo'rau]] in [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]].
*Xy'nell assured (Optional)
*Speak to Associate Xy'nell
*Speak to Port Authority Zo'rau

==Description==
I can hear [[Coordinator Xy'thir]] raging about the slide in business already.

<Xy'nell shifts uncomfortably and ducks his head.>

We're ready. Go to Port Authority Zo'rau. Tell them you represent an invested party and that the audit should be moved up.

And there's one more thing I need you to do. Speak with me before you go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
This is more important than I can say, <name>. But I cannot break my oath. Deliver the pin to Zo'rau.

==Completion==
Zo'rau is wearing the pin.

<Xy'nell's shoulders loosen.>

Thank you, <name>. Now you and I must be careful.

==Notes==
Speak with Xy'nell again:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|What else do I need to do?}}

I've modified the illusion on the pin. Take it.

You have to convince Port Authority Zo'rau to wear it, if nothing else. None of the evidence matters if he doesn't.

Do you understand?

{{gossip|What is the pin supposed to do?}}
{{dialogue-child|<Xy'nell fidgets anxiously.>

It will help. It's illusion magic like we used before to help my coworkers.

Please--you must understand. I can't do this again. I need this to be the last audit.

<He wraps his arms around himself.>

He must wear the pin.

{{gossip|Why must this be the last audit?}}

{{gossip|quest=|I will make sure Zo'rau wears the pin.}}

<Xy'nell shakes his head quickly. His voice is rough.>

The last. It will be the last. Please don't ask me any more.

{{plainlist|
*{{gossip|quest=|Fine.}}

:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|Thank you, <name>.}}
:{{text|emote|Xy'nell grows quiet again.}}

Head east to find [[Port Authority Zo'rau]]:
{{dialogue|I'm very busy, <class>. The docks are in disarray. The incoming and outgoing vessels are delayed by several cycles.

What is it that you want?

{{gossip|quest=|I'm here on behalf of an invested party. You need to push up Xy Imports's audit.}}

An invested party? Xy Imports is appearing in my reports more and more lately. If I could straighten them out, the majority of issues on the docks would be resolved by proxy.

I appreciate the tip, <class>. I will prioritize an audit as soon as I can.

{{gossip|quest=|Please wear this pin to the audit. It's important.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Port Authority Zo'rau|A pin? No doubt from your invested party. It appears enchanted.}}
:{{text|say|Port Authority Zo'rau|The nature of this magic... yes, I think I will take your gift. And I will be auditing Xy Imports immediately.}}
:''Zo'rau hops on his [[gearglider]] and takes off.''
