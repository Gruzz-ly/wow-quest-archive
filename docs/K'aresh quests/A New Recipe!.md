'''A New Recipe!''' becomes available at Renown 8 with [[Manaforge Vandals]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Technique: Deal: Cartel Zo]]
*[[Technique: Deal: Cartel Ba]]
*[[Technique: Deal: Cartel Om]]
*[[Formula: Gleeful Glamour - Ethereal]]

==Completion==
You're back already! I believe I've found a use for the Manaforged Instruments you may have found within [[Forgeweaver Araz|Araz]]'s possession. Each are pieces of machinery that, if extracted properly, would yield a unique energy signal not dissimilar to the magic used to bind [[Ethereal]]s. If you or anyone you know are particularly well-versed in Enchantmenting or Inscription, take these! They may hold secrets, or at the very least a novel experience for you. Good luck!
