==Objectives==
Assist [[Adarus Duskblaze|Adarus]] and [[Leona Darkstrider|Leona]] with the ritual.
*[[K'areshi Fragment]] Placed
*Speak to Adarus
*Ritual Witnessed
*Adarus Kicked

==Description==
This is it, <name>. Place the K'areshi fragment above Adarus, and I will channel the void lure containing Ramon'ta's void essence into the shard.

Adarus is powerful and determined, but we're attempting something both experimental and and dangerous.

I'll ask you to be vigilant.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
When you're ready, <name>.

==Completion==
I didn't have the time or focus to pick a destination for that portal, <name>. He could be anywhere.

==Notes==
Place the [[K'areshi Fragment]] above [[Adarus Duskblaze]], then speak with the demon hunter:
