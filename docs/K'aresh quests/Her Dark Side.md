==Objectives==
Destroy the ethereal siphon in [[Serrated Peaks]].
*[[Ethereal Siphon]] Barrier removed {{co|54.1|48.8|K'aresh}}
*[[Ethereal Siphon Console]] overloaded

==Description==
An [[ethereal]] army runs on its energy siphons. Interrupt the flow of energy by destroying their siphon tower, and the army will pull back. It's one of their weaknesses as minions. Normally I wouldn't share the secrets of their defeat, but they betrayed me, and will forever live with the consequences.

The siphon has a control console that can be overloaded to collapse the system. It will be shielded by a void barrier. [[Alleria]] can remove it for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Now the Shadowguard will have to retreat.

==Completion==
I feel like there is something [[Locus-Walker]] and [[Ve'nari]] are keeping from me. Some secret during the [[Devouring War]] that they don't want me to know. Xal'atath is pulling on this doubt to manipulate me.

Let's defeat the Shadowguard, then we can uncover the truth.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Divide and Conquer (quest)]] and [[Counter Measures]] before heading out.

Before leaving, Xal'atath has new gossip:
{{dialogue|My defenses will kill the Shadowguard who may threaten our little agreement with dear Ve'nari. I know you must be so very disappointed. Killing is what you're best at, isn't it?}}

Head to the [[Serrated Peaks]] and [[Alleria Windrunner]] appears.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I can sense Xal'atath buzzing about you. Don't listen to her lies.}}

Alleria will accompany you for the three quests and has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Strike its head, and the body will fall.}}

Upon reaching the [[Ethereal Siphone Console]] that is protected by a barrier, and use the ability: {{Abilities|Remove the Barrier|icon=inv_cosmicvoid_buff|id=1218640}}

:''Alleria begins to take out the barrier''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I don't know who to trust anymore, <name>. But we can't lose track of Xal'atath.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Stay with her. Let her think you are her champion.}}

Once she removed the barrier, interact with the console and overload it.
