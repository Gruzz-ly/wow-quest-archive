Help [[Locus-Walker]] disable [[Shadow Point: Torment]] at [[Shadow Point]] on [[K'aresh]].

==Description==
We must continue disabling or destroying these buildings. I am loathe to destroy the [[technology]] of my people, but when used for such dire purpose, there is no choice!

From here on out, hold nothing back. Let us raze the works of the [[Shadowguard]].

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
There is only more darkness ahead of us. Be prepared for anything.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|[[Xal'atath]] is focused on destruction at all costs. However, I will not abandon my people to the Shadowguard's mercies!}}
:''Locus-Walker walks to the garrison.''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|So you can still defy her after all.}}

Follow him inside:
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Careful, <Name>! This garrison's conduits have been overloaded with void energy.}}

Interact with the four [[Unstable Energy Matrix|Unstable Energy Matrices]]:
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|This--is raw power. Enough to overwhelm and remake unthethered souls. It must be stopped.}}

Interact with the four [[hadowguard Energy Reserve]]s:
:{{Text|Say|[[Dimensius]]|Devour!}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|As Dimensius grows in power, all fates bend toward destruction.}}

Return to the pick-up location:
:{{Text|Say|[[Narathe]]|That awful voice. A nightmare I had forgotten.}}
