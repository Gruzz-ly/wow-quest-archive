'''Applied Mixology''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Trader Ba'kril]] at [[Ba'kril's Iniquities]] in central [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]] to begin. This chapter awards +350 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and Explorer 1 (ilvl 642) bracers.

==Objectives==
Concoct an energy drink infused with various power sources.
*[[Azerite Powder (Tazavesh)|Azerie Powder]] infused
*[[Mana Cell Energy]] infused
*[[Void Essence (Tazavesh)|Void Essence]] infused
*Finalize the concoction (0/100%)

==Description==
Allow me to introduce myself, traveler. I am known as [[Trader Ba'kril|Ba'kril]].

As you know, [[Broker|my people]] do not imbibe as yours do. My proposal is simple: help me concoct a new energy drink and I shall allow you to use it free of charge.

It will most certainly make you a hero amongst heroes. Is that not worth the risk?

I have acquired various potent energy sources. Infuse them into the berry juice cocktail and let us see how potent we can make it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
On the soul of [[K'aresh]], I make my oath to you, traveler. We will create the finest, most powerful infused concoction ever seen. With it, you will have the power of ten [[devourer]]s!

<Ba'kril grumbles something under his breath about [[Tazavesh]]'s leadership.>

Of course, there will be just a pinch of profit on the side for me.

==Completion==
Unbelievable! It worked and we were not blown into an incalculable number of miniscule pieces. I do hope this formulation proves useful not only for you, but for the future of K'aresh.

Now on to phase two... testing and market research.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|Traveler, a moment of your time. I have a proposal you should consider with all due haste.}}

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|Let us start with one of each.}}

Enhance the [[New Energy Drink]] with the three objects nearby.
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|Now let the infusions guide you. Go with your gut or whatever it is your people have for innards.}}

Now add the ingredients based on whichever has an arrow pointing at it. Each correct ingredient gives +15%.
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|Truly an inspired result, traveler!}}

==Progression==
{{That Tazavesh Taste}}
