==Objectives==
Collect 20 Blood of K'aresh deposits.
*[[Blood of K'aresh Deposit]] (20)

==Description==
In the old days, we used certain deep-mined salts in cleansing processes and rituals. As you can see around you, mining is no longer valid, as these fragile rocks are hanging on to each other.

On the day of the [[Devouring]] of [[K'aresh]], a never-before-seen mineral surfaced. The [[Blood of K'aresh]] is a blue mineral with some deposits to the west of here. Even though K'aresh is dying, I should follow the old traditions to the end.

Please collect deposits from sand striders or veins and bring them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Although the Blood of K'aresh may not have existed prior to the Devouring like other minerals, it came from within our world and thus should still be usable for the process.

==Completion==
Yes. These will do. I will grind them to fine powder and use them to cleanse my items in my ritual of return.

==Notes==
[[Blood of K'aresh Deposit]]s drop from [[Sand Strider]]s and [[Sandbank Hoppers]], or can be found in larger Blood of K'aresh deposits on the ground in the [[Merciless Wastes]] south of the [[Oasis]].
