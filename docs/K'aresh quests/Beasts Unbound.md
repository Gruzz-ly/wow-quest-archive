==Objectives==
Defeat escaped creatures in [[Tazavesh]] to return them to [[Ta'ka]].
*Take the access to the overlook (Optional)
*[[Escaped Creature|Escaped creatures]] recovered (8)

==Description==
I am Ta'ka, supplier of rare creatures destined to repopulate [[K'aresh|my homeland]].

At least, I was until some of them escaped their translocation cages! This cannot stand!

These creatures are vital. If you could assist me with capturing them, I'd be quite appreciative.

Engage them in combat and subdue them. The capture device I've provided will automatically translocate them back to my care once they are on the verge of defeat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Have you finished capturing the escaped beasts?

==Completion==
You've returned them! Excellent work.

Here is your reward, as promised.

==Notes==

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Ta'ka|Someone sabotaged the enclosures through that portal.}}

Take the portal behind Ta'ka to be teleported to a terrace with [[Escaped Creature]]s and dead [[Tazavesh Citizen]]s. Defeat them.
