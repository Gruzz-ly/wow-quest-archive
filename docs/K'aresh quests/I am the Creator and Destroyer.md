==Objectives==
Demonstrate your mastery over life and death.
* Players Resurrected
* Worthy Creatures Destroyed

==Description==
Such a small thing, really. And devoid of any of the power T'uure once nurtured. But a relic of inestimable value nonetheless.

Did you know, <class>, that to T'uure, the dark and the light were inseparable aspects of a greater truth?

What creates, has the power to destroy in equal measure. Demonstrate this lesson and you will reach a new understanding of yourself, and of the great Naaru whose sacrifice was able to halt the annihilation of an entire planet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[T'uure, Remnant of the Naaru]]
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Ah yes. I can sense the change in you. The growth that comes with meting out death in one hand, while nuturing life in the other.

Perhaps this small token will serve as a reminder of T'uure and his role in Dimensius' ultimate fate.
