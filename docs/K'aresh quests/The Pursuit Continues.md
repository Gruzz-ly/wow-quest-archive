==Objectives==
Find [[Leona Darkstrider|Leona]] and [[Allari]] in [[K'aresh]].

==Description==
;Magister Umbric
My apprentice, Leona, has been preoccupied with a desire to learn the ways of the [[Illidari]].

She has found another [[demon hunter]] willing to train her: Allari the Souleater. But first, Leona must prove herself worthy. After what happened when last she last sought [[such a mentor]], I worry for her safety.

Join Leona for this trial. Make sure she is not getting involved in something she is not prepared to handle.
