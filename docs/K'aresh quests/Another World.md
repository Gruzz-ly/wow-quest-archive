'''Another World''' begins the [[Phase Diving]] storyline in [[K'aresh]]. This quest is offered immediately after completing [[The Tabiqa]], the final quest of chapter three of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Shad'anis]] at the [[Oasis]], not far from [[Xal'atath]] and the [[Soul-Scribe]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Find [[Shad'anis]] at [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]] on [[K'aresh]].

==Description==
I represent a group within [[K'aresh Trust|the Trust]] tasked with a dangerous but vital job--[[Phase Diving]]. I was at Overlook Zo'Shuul when [[Xal'atath|the Harbinger]] transformed you into energy. It is similar to that, but more profitable.

The Trust embarks on Phase Dives to help replenish our energy reserves. On K'aresh, energy is power--and now we must compete with the [[Shadowguard]]. We desperately need the help of someone like you.

Meet me at Overlook Zo'Shuul if you are interested. We will, of course, compensate you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Completion==
Thank you for accepting our offer, <name>. This is dangerous work that will push you beyond the limits of our reality. But with risk we find profit, and with profit we can change the world.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Shad'anis|Hey, fleshling, over here.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Shad'anis|Meet me at Overlook Zo'shuul, fleshling. I have a lot to show you.}}

Fly west to [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]], where Shad'nis is waiting:
:{{text|say|Shad'anis|There you are, fleshling. I was wondering if you would come.}}

She has more gossip:
{{dialogue|When our world was destroyed by Dimensius and we found ourselves changed into energy, we discovered that the universe is larger than we imagined. Larger and more terrifying.

Underneath this plane that you think of as material lies a realm that most ethereals and brokers fear--one that we may all be destined to make our ultimate journey to. We call this realm "Untethered Space."

{{gossip|Untethered Space?}}

Untethered Space is another plane of existence, layered upon the material plane--coterminous with our existence, and nearly out of reach. A being of energy is at constant risk of falling through the cracks of the cosmos into this realm. To do so without prior preparation is to risk never returning.

But the Trust is prepared. We can safely mine for its rich reserves of energy, discover relics lost in the destruction of K'aresh, and even find those unfortunates who fell between worlds. The Shadowguard also has knowledge of this plane. It has become much more dangerous to explore, and we need help.

{{gossip|Why would you go to Untethered Space?}}

The energy falls out of the material realm, and most of it never returns. Scavengers, predators, and the Shadowguard troll for the remains of creatures and relics from the past. If we were to leave them there, the vital energy of K'aresh would be devoured by the Void.

But with our Phase Conduits, we can recover the energies and relics from this plane of existence--and use it to power the eco-domes, and prevent the void creatures growing beyond our control. 

It is also quite profitable... if you happen to be interested in that sort of thing, mortal.

Shad'anis serves as the [[Phase Diving]] vendor, and [[Hashim]], immediately next to her, serves as the [[Reshii Wraps]] upgrader, trading [[Ethereal Strands]].
