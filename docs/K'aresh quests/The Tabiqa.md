'''The Tabiqa''' concludes the third chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Chapter four begins starting the week of 12 August 2025, but in the meantime, the [[Reshii Wraps]] quest chain opens, unlocking access to [[Phase Diving]]. Equip it, then speak with [[Shad'anis]] nearby to start [[Another World]]. That leads to [[Hashim]] at [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]] who offers [[Wrapped Up]]. Completing this quest also unlocks [[world quest]]s in [[K'aresh]].

==Objectives==
Help [[Soul-Scribe]] with the ritual.
* Meet Soul-Scribe by the water
* Pollen and petals placed
* Vial of water placed
* Ritual dagger placed
* Talk to Soul-Scribe

==Description==
My followers long for the days when they were oracles. They yearn to hear the [[Song of K'aresh]]. I am a realist. The evil of the [[Ravel]], of [[Dimensius]]--they have destroyed the beauty that was our [[Worldsoul]].

But you have gathered the items for the Tabiqa. So I will attempt it. When I hear the void of [[K'aresh]]'s absence, there will be consequences.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Precise Fiber]]
* [[Chronomantic Fiber]]
* [[Energizing Fiber]]
* [[Dexterous Fiber]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* +2,500 [[reputation]] with [[K'aresh Trust]]
* [[Reshii Wraps]]
* 3x [[Ethereal Strands]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
It has been too long since we were this close to K'aresh. It is but an echo of what once was, but the memories that it brings back...

==Completion==
And the pieces fall together. Perhaps we have enough strength to take on the Shadowguard, my champion.

Let me tip the scales further. With the power of these Reshii Ribbons,  I will infuse these Reshii Wraps with enough to empower you to explore [[Untethered Space]]... and gather strength for the fight ahead.

You're welcome.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|Let us move down to the water and begin the Tabiqa.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|Lead the way...oracle.}}
:''Soul-Scribe and her ethereals walk off as Xal'atath teleports out.'' 

Head to the spot of the ritual where Soul-Scribe and the others are assembled.
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|Prepare for the ritual. Place the items on the table.}}

Place the [[Petals and Pollen]], the [[Vial of Water]], and the [[Tabiqa Dagger]] in turn:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|We offer petals and pollen. Through the Exchange, we are reborn.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|We offer water from the wellsprings deep within K'aresh.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|We offer a ritual dagger, whose meaning we would reclaim.}}

Speak with Soul-Scribe:
{{dialogue|To stand once more under the trees of K'aresh, to be near her waters... is this something achievable, or just a mockery of what once was?

{{gossip|quest=|{{text|rare|(Play Movie)}} Let's start the ritual.}}

The [[The War Within in-game cinematics|Real-Time Cutscene]] "The Song of K'aresh" starts:
{{#ev:youtube|IIktY24hT3Y}}
:''Soul-Scribe, Xal'atath & Narathe begin the Tabiqa.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|K'aresh is--}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|K'aresh is--}}
:''Nothing happens.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|Gah! I sense nothing!}}
:''Soul-Scribe brings out her dagger and turns towards Xal'atath.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|You lied! There is no Worldsoul here!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Eons of wandering have starved your once great power, oracle.}}
:''Xal'atath uses her powers on Soul-Scribe causing her to groan painfully.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|Traitor! Oath-breaker!}}
:''The Wastelanders try to attack Xal'atath but she stops them and drains them.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|The Worldsoul is as weak as you are. You need more power to commune!}}
:''The harbinger strains herself and lifts Soul-Scribe in the air and projects the power to her.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Feast! Touch the fading heart of your world!}}
:''Soul-Scribe starts hearing K'aresh.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|K'aresh...}}
:''The [[adventurer]] shields their eyes as Soul-Scribe feels K'aresh's song. They lowered their arm as Xal'atath lands Soul-Scribe to the ground as she gasps.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|I heard... K'aresh.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|By my unbroken oaths the oracles of the Wastes will be your army, Harbinger.}}
:''Soul-Scribe walks to her fellow Wastelanders.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|We fight to restore K'aresh.}}
:''The Wastelanders cheer.''

After the cutscene:
{{dialogue|title=Soul-Scribe|It has been so long since I heard his voice. I cannot believe he was still here with us... all this time. You have given me true hope, <name>, and my honor and oath demand that I do whatever is in my power to save K'aresh.

I will give you the Reshii Ribbons, and the Wastelanders will join your fight.}}
