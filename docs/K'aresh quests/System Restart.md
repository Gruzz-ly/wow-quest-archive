==Objectives==
Help [[Engineer Om'loof]] in [[Eco-Dome: Primus]].
*Speak to Engineer Om'loof
*[[Rod of Parameters]] used
*Rod of Analysis used
*[[Rod of Analysis]]
*Rod of Analysis replaced
*[[Rod of Restart]] used

==Description==
My Reshii Ribbon is all that is keeping this dome and its systems from collapsing.

This eco-dome took too much of my fortune to build just for the Shadowguard to destroy it. They have sabotaged many of our control consoles, risking a complete ecological collapse.

Find Engineer Om'loof and help him restart our environmental support system while I monitor the rest of the facility.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
This eco-dome will fail if the environmental support system stops. We must stabilize it!

==Completion==
Environmental support may be back up and running, but don't get complacent. That was merely the first of the many problems plaguing this eco-dome.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|The only thing holding everything together is my Reshii Ribbon. I spent my fortune to acquire these eco-domes. I won't let them collapse.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|<Name>! Stabilize the dome! The rest of you, secure this area. The Shadowguard are everywhere!}}

[[Xal'atath]] has a {{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} option:
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|I thought you were just going to consult the Harbinger.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Not bring her along.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I insisted. Last time, the [[Ravel]] was unable to complete the straightforward task it was given.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I need to look after my interests. I need to know that we will bring an end to [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|Dimensius]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Is that so? Then if you insist on being part of this venture, I am going to put you to work.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Don't just float around making sassy remarks. Make yourself useful and kill some Shadowguard.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Do you really trust her?}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|I trust her to do whatever she needs to survive.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|We share a purpose. To kill the All-Devouring.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|That may change once Dimensius is dead.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Don't just stand there scowling at each other. Get to work! My dome is in crisis!}}

Go to [[Engineer Om'loof]] and speak to him:
{{dialogue|You shouldn't be here, stranger.

{{gossip|quest=|Ve'nari sent me to help you.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Engineer Om'loof|Quickly mortal, before we lose environmental support. Activate the rods!}}

Go to the console that is next to the center and activate the Rod of Parameters.
:{{Text|Say|Engineer Om'loof|Good! Now get the next rod!}}

Activate the Rod of Analysis and then it breaks.
:{{Text|Say|Engineer Om'loof|Ahh! The rod cracked! Get me a new one! Go!}}

Head to the crates from that is lying near the plants and take the [[Rod of Analysis]]. Head to the same console and replace the rod of analysis.
:{{Text|Say|Engineer Om'loof|Ahh! Structural integrity acceptable. We might survive this. Next rod!}}

Head to the other console that is next to the center console and activate the Rod of Restart.
:{{Text|Say|Engineer Om'loof|Did it work? Yes! System stable. Ha! Tell Ve'nari we won't explode.}}

[[Engineer Om'loof]] has new gossip:
{{dialogue|You would think that this advanced technology that can terraform worlds would be more sturdy when it comes to sabotage. No! All it took was a bunch of Shadowguard hooligans and we almost lost the eco-dome.

Recalibrating these machines and making sure that all the readings are right takes time!

I hope I won't have to go through this again.}}

Return to [[Ve'nari]].
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Energy control systems may be stabilized, but the biomes will still crash without my ribbon.}}
