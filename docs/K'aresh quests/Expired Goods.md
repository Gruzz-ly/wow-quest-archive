'''Expired Goods''' concludes the optional "Lost and Found Storage" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Vaultkeeper Xy'vez]] in [[Astral Getaways]] in northeastern Tazavesh to begin.

==Objectives==
Help [[Vaultkeeper Xy'vez]] prepare the [[void storage]] vaults for sale in [[Tazavesh]] on [[K'aresh]].
* Return a mount
* Return a weapon
* Return a trinket
* Return a weapon

==Description==
Now then, on to business. I hear tale that [[Azeroth|your world]] is full of [[adventurer|heroes on adventure]]. And where there's adventurers, there's need for storing their treasures. Always.

Thus, you have turned to our kin to keep them safely deposited between realms. Yet not one of you read the contract. We have since ceased such services and returned goods to their owners. 

You and I, <name>, are selling opportunities to purchase what remains. Blind of course. Help me prepare.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Voidmarket Negotiator's Handwraps]]
* [[Voidmarket Negotiator's Gloves]]
* [[Voidmarket Negotiator's Grips]]
* [[Voidmarket Negotiator's Gauntlets]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[K'aresh Trust]]

==Progress==
Always so much to prepare before a first sale.

==Completion==
Excellent! With that out of the way, we can begin sales.

==Notes==
On accept, piles of weapons, treasures, and trash appear in front of Xy'vez:
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|Very well-- Oh? What's this?}}
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|Quickly return the goods to the vault before the customers see! I'll check the registrar.}}
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|This vault contains a mount. Check the treasure pile!}}

Look through the treasure:
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|Why is it called that [[Invincible's Reins|if we can see it]]?}}
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|Looks like we are missing a weapon still.}}

Dig through the weapons:
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|[[Splinter of Atiesh|39 Splinters]] of [[Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian|a staff]]? Not a weapon I'd consider reliable.}}
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|There should be a trinket as well. Perhaps the trash pile?}}

Search the trash:
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|A [[Carrot on a Stick|withered carrot tied to a stick]]. What even is this?}}
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|Looks like we are missing a weapon still.}}

Scour the weapons one final time:
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|A very colorful sword indeed. Hmph. Ours look better.}}

On complete, a handful of [[Curious Shopper]]s walk up:
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|Let the sales begin! Who would like to buy this portal?}}
:{{text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|Says here it belonged to a hero from the [[Dun Morogh|Dunes of Murogh]] region. Bidding starts at 50,000 Azerothian gold.}}
:{{text|say|Curious Shopper|One hundred thousand!}}
:{{text|say|Curious Shopper|One hundred thousand and one!}}
:{{text|say|Curious Shopper|This is too much for me. I'll save my gold for the next one.}}
