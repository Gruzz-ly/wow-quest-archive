'''Priest of the Old Ways''' concludes the optional "Priest of the Old Ways" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Outcast Hizfran]] on the eastern edge of the eastern island in the [[Merciless Wastes]] southeast of [[Oasis|The Oasis]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Slay 3 void manifestations.
*[[Void of Shame]] slain
*[[Void of Doubt]] slain
*[[Void of Falter]] slain

==Description==
<Name>, I suspect that a living manifestation of the [[Void]] came out of myself and the items. I cannot, with good conscience, take on the mantle of a [[priest]] of the old ways while these manifestations are out there.

I have a final request for you.

Go find these creatures and slay them. Then, I will be able to reassume the mantle of priest.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Shoulderpads of the Exiled Vow]]
* [[Epaulets of the Exiled Vow]]
* [[Shoulderguards of the Exiled Vow]]
* [[Mantle of the Exiled Vow]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[K'aresh Trust]]

==Progress==
One step, <name>. One last step.

==Completion==
You have done it. Nothing I can give you is a good enough reward for what you have given me.

Finally, my vision of you from all those years ago makes sense. You have saved me--my soul.

Thank you.

==Notes==
The three named targets are to the south, in [[North Sufaad]]:
:{{text|whisper|Void of Doubt|I will feed on your insecurities!}}
:{{text|whisper|Void of Falter|Your faith wavers, weakling!}}
:{{text|whisper|Void of Shame|Drown in the sins of your past!}}

On return, Hizfran has reequipped his armor and no longer bears the appellation "Outcast".

On complete:
:{{text|say|Hizfran|I have taken the mantle of a priest of K'aresh--my ancient oath.}}
:{{text|say|Hizfran|I have to thank you from the depths of my being.}}
:{{text|say|Hizfran|You gave me what I could not give myself.}}
:{{text|say|Hizfran|You gave me the ability to rekindle my inner flame--the one that guides my oath.}}
:{{text|say|Hizfran|My oath is between myself and K'aresh now. It matters not what others will think or say.}}
:{{text|say|Hizfran|The only way to master a path is to walk the path. I now must master every path, every passage, and nook.}}
:''Hizfran walks away.''
