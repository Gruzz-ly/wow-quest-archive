==Objectives==
Meet [[Adarus Duskblaze|Adarus]] and [[Leona Darkstrider|Leona]] at the ritual site inside [[Voidscar Cavern|the cave]] at the [[Fracture of Laacuna]].

==Description==
At last, <name>. With the promise of [[K'areshi Fragment|this fragment]]'s power, and my mastery over the [[illidari]]{{sic}} ways, I will be ready to fight the [[shadowguard]]{{sic}} and any other threats the [[void]] throws at us.

Leona spoke of a cave near [[Shan'dorah]] where the void energies suffusing [[K'aresh]] converge.

Meet us there, and play a part in my ascension.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We're nearly prepared. Although I can't help but wonder if Adarus' reach exceeds his grasp.

==Notes==
On accept, they both mount and fly away. 

Find the mouth of the cave at {{Co|56.71|24.19|K'aresh}} back north of [[Shan'dorah]] and enter the [[Voidscar Cavern]]. Both elves are in the central area. Leona is preparing candles and Adarus is kneeling, his weapons set aside:
