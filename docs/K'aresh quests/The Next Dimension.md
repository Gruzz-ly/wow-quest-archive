'''The Next Dimension''' begins chapter four of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]], "Shadows En Garde". This chapter unlocked the week of 12 August 2025.

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Soul-Scribe]] in [[Shan'dorah]] on [[K'aresh]].

==Description==
By the Songs of K'aresh, I will join you to face the [[Shadowguard]] and [[Dimensius]] in battle. Let those that would prey on Untamed K'aresh fear his followers!

My scouts have tracked your comrades setting a foothold in Shadowguard territory. They will need our assistance. 

K'aresh lives! Our cause is just! Our oaths are unbroken!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I did not know there were this many void-touched from your world. How do they shield their souls from its madness?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|I remember this feeling. The touch of K'aresh. I wish to carry out my oaths to him.}}
:''Soul-Scribe and the Wastelanders mount up and leave.''
:{{text|say|Xal'atath|We have another ribbon, and an army. All it took was the promise of better world.}}
:''[[Xal'atath]] teleports out.''

Head west to [[Shan'dorah]], where [[Narathe]] is speaking with [[Soul-Scribe]]:
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|The camp has been claimed by void elves. We've heard tales of their victories against the Shadowguard on softer worlds.}}
