==Objectives==
18 Shadowguard Essence scanned
*[[Shadowguard Essence]] scanned (18)
*Use the [[Phase Conduit]] to enter [[Untethered Space]] (optional)
*[[Essence Scanner]] (provided)

==Description==
The trick to creating a perfect Facade is to scan live [[Shadowguard]] with a nifty little device I will provide you. This device will allow you copy the very unique essence that is the core of their being, and store it for our use.

You can locate shadowguard{{sic}} in both regular and untethered space. Regardless of how you find them, they won't take kindly to your presence, and they certainly won't want to be scanned.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Umbral Facade]]

==Progress==
Did you finish those scans?

==Completion==
Very well done! It's not often I see someone return with a full scanner.

==Notes==
If you're not already in Untethered Space, use the nearby Phase Conduit. Look for any Shadowgaurd around [[Shadow Point]] in normal or Untethered Space. Use the [[Essence Scanner]] on them. The buff, [[Identity Scan]], will be placed on your target, disallowing credit for further scans. Oddly enough, this buff does not prevent further scans, just credit, so the effect can stack. This is likely a bug. The cast does not suffer knockback, so if you can take on multiple targets hitting you at once, you can run around scanning without worrying about body pulling a ton of enemies. You need to be within their aggro ranges, though. Otherwise you will get an alert for not having a current target despite having an otherwise valid Shadowguard [[ethereal]] targeted.
