==Objectives==
Find a way to sway the [[Wastelanders]].
* Speak to [[Narathe]]
* Talk to [[Xal'atath]] (Optional)
* Bring a stalker to [[Zabta]]

==Description==
I've planted the seed, yet [[Soul-Scribe]] still hesitates. Her daughter Narathe is more receptive. She might be able to give us the nudge that's needed to win the Wastelanders over. Daughters are useful.

Go with Narathe. Win over their tribe. I will stay here and continue to work on Soul-Scribe's will.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Silent Huntsman's Sandals]]
*[[Silent Huntsman's Waders]]
*[[Silent Huntsman's Striders]]
*[[Silent Huntsman's Sabatons]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I will do what my oaths dictate, but I am not convinced that your plan is the way to go.

==Completion==
Word has filtered up through my camp about what you have done for us. My daughter has always been too trusting. but your efforts do not go unnoticed.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|Why reveal your secrets, Harbinger? If you are here for the ribbon, you could just take it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Revenge. I want to help you get yours.}}

Xal'atath has a {{gossip|quest=|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} gossip option:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|The Tabiqa ritual is for communing with the Worldsoul. K'aresh is dead!}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|The [[Ravel]]'s heresy halted the [[Dimensius|Devouring]]. Dimensius did not finish his meal.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|The [[broker]]s want you to think it is their [[technomancy]] that makes the eco-domes bloom.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|You and I know the truth. There can be no life without K'aresh.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|I have tried for ages. There has been nothing but silence.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|You could commune with K'aresh again! Show your people you are still strong. Then I will put that accursed ribbon to righteous use.}}
:{{text|say|Narathe|We could be oracles again.}}
:{{text|say|Soul-Scribe|If K'aresh is silent, I will find my own revenge.}}

Head to Narathe:
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|You're good at killing. But we need more than that in an ally.}}

Speak with Narathe:
{{dialogue|Soul-Scribe was once our high priestess, but like most of us, her heart shattered along with K'aresh during its destruction.

Many ages have passed since the sundering of our world, and we as a people have strayed from our calling.

We are oath-bound to protect K'aresh, but wary of outsiders.

{{gossip|quest=|How can we gain Soul-Scribe's trust?}}

Let me show you the life of a Wastelander, stranger. Existence is a daily struggle on the bones of our world. My mother's strength has inspired us to survive at any cost.

We've needed to adapt as conditions change. The Void takes many of our stalkers. We need to replace such faithful hunting companions.

Go into the dunes, then subdue and retrieve one of the escaped stalkers. You will prove your strength, and my mother may see that you are determined to help.

Bring the stalker to Zabta at the southwestern edge of the camp.

{{gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}

Pick up [[Distribution of Power]] before heading out.

Get an [[Escaped Stalker]] down to 50% health, then interact with it to lasso it. Return it to Zabta:
:{{Text|Say|Zabta|A fine specimen. She will do well on the hunt.}}

Return to Soul-Scribe to turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|The domes are a Ravel construct. They try to tame the Untamed. Merciless K'aresh is gone.}}
