'''Attuned to the Aether''' becomes available after reaching Renown 6 with [[Manaforge Vandals]].

==Objectives==
Report to [[Ba'choso]] at [[Shadow Point]].

==Description==
Hello! I've learned valuable information about how exposure to [[Manaforge Omega|Omega]]'s manaflow is impacting you - let us discuss back at Shadow Point when you have a moment.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*{{Abilities|Attuned to the Aether|id=1242345|Manaforge Omega's energy empowers your weapon enchantments, improving their effects by 50% while inside its walls. Runeforging effects are increased by 10%.|icon=inv_enchanting_crystal_color2}}

==Completion==
My research shows that due to the [[Reshii Wraps]]' influence on your physical form, the powerful manasurges and reactors inside Omega can be used to your benefit! While this is only a fraction of your power, it seems that arcane enhancements made to your armaments are made ever more powerful while in their vicinity. This warrants further testing...
