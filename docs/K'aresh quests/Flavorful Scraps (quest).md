==Objectives==
Collect 24 Discarded Scraps
*[[Discarded Items]] (24)

==Description==
Plenty of profit to be made scavenging these sands, but watch out for [[Grubber|the monster]].

It's hungry, I've seen it drag scavengers under the sands!

You can trick it, I fed it once. Tossed it some scraps.

You need the tastiest garbage to lure it out. Collect what you can and I will help sort it to find the most flavorful scraps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*[[Flavorful Scraps]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything tasty?

==Completion==
I've picked out the most flavorful bits that'll catch the monsters attention!

==Notes==
Discarded items can be looted directly from the ground as [[Tazavesh Trash]] and from [[Hungry Trashmite]]s. The trashpile version of Tazavesh Trash will spawn Hungry Trashmites.

==Progression==
{{A Key Threat}}
