==Objectives==
Help Shahata recover her mother's necklace.
*Search chests (6)
*Help Shahata
*[[Damaged Echo Surveyor|Check on Om'fennad]]

==Description==
I had a necklace that our mother beaded. The [[Sufaadi]] took it when they robbed me. Things from old [[K'aresh]] are rare. If the Sufaadi haven't traded it, it'll be with their other valuables.

I was planning to leave it behind. Sentimentality isn't worth risking your life, but you kept your word--which is more than I can say for my brother. Help me recover the necklace and it's yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
What happened? Where's [[Om'fennad|Fennad]]?

==Completion==
It's all gone. Months of supplies up in flames. If Fennad isn't dead already, he will be soon. The Sufaadi won't be forgiving, especially after what we've done.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shahata|Stay here, Fennad. We'll be back with the necklace.}}
:''Shahata walks off.''

Follow her to a different part of [[North Sufaad]], where she's working on a crate guarded by a force shield:
:{{text|say|Shahata|Search the other crates. I'll unseal this one.}}

Open up the Stolen Coffers and Sealed Chests nearby and fend off the summoned [[Trained Thief-Hunter]]s. Open six:
:{{text|say|Shahata|I almost have it. Help me get this open!}}

Interact with the Sealed Reliquary she's been working on:
:{{text|say|Projection of Writ-Weaver|I warned you to stay away. Perhaps your brother will have more respect for our temple.}}
:''The reliquary knocks the player away.''
:{{text|say|Shahata|He knew we were coming!}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|Hurry! We need to get back to Fennad.}}
:''She runs off.''

On return:
:{{text|say|Shahata|Ruya! What happened? Where's my brother?}}
:''Shahata's tent has been set ablaze and Om'fennad is nowhere to be found.''

A [[Damaged Echo Surveyor]] is on the ground. Interact with it:
