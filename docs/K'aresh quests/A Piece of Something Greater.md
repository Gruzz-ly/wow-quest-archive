==Objectives==
Retrieve the three keys.
*[[Key of the Eternal Night]]
*[[Key of the Waning Moon]]
*[[Key of the Dark Sun]]
*Return to the Relic Chamber
*[[Energy Pylon|Pylons]] Deactivated
*[[K'areshi Fragment|Fragment]] Retrieved

==Description==
Seek out the Relictors. They comb through these wastes like [[Carrion bird|carrion feeder]]s, sifting through proof of their people's weakness in a misguided attempt to find strength.

<[[Adarus Duskblaze|Adarus]] spits contemptuously onto the sand.>

The only object of real value is here in front of us, and they keep it contained out of fear. I will not make that mistake.

Go, find these Relictors, unburden them of their keys, and return.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You've proved yourself useful so far, <class>. Continue to do so.

==Completion==
Retain the fragment for now.

I will need it soon.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Leona Darkstrider has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
The power of this shard... the [[wastelanders]] were right to be wary of it.

{{Gossip|What does Adarus plan to do with it?}}

He and I have a pact. I provide a path for him to harness the [[void]], and become like me. And he teaches me the ways of the [[Illidari]].

Both of us require power from outside ourselves to succeed. The harvest of [[Ramon'ta the Insatiable|Ramon'ta]] was the first step in achieving my goals. For Adarus, it will require the void energy contained in [[K'areshi Fragment|this corrupted shard]] of [[K'aresh]].

Will it be enough? From what I know of [[Void elf|my people]], I believe so. Will Adarus be up to the task? That I am less sure of.

But no power is gained without risk.

The relictors are [[Relictor Qunash'i]], [[Relictor Lay'sha]], and [[Relictor Efrat]], walking around the ruins. Their patrol areas are marked on the map and they each have aggro lines:
:{{text|say|Relictor Qunash'i|Fool! It cannot be controlled, only contained!}}
:{{text|say|Relictor Lay'sha|Trespasser! The fragment must never be unleashed!}}
:{{text|say|Relictor Efrat|Your ignorance will be your doom, outlander!}}

Collect the three keys and return to Adarus:
:{{Text|say|Adarus Duskblaze|You're back. Good.}}
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|I'm prepared to contain the released fragment, <name>. Whenever you're ready.}}

Interact with the three nearby [[Energy Pylon]]s to deactivate them.
:{{Text|say|Adarus Duskblaze|Ah yes, there it is.}}
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|The power in this fragment is more volatile than I predicted.}}

Pick up the [[K'areshi Fragment]] and turn in.
