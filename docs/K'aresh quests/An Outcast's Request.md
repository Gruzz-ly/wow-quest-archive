'''An Outcast's Request''' begins the optional "Priest of the Old Ways" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Outcast Hizfran]] on the eastern edge of the eastern island in the [[Merciless Wastes]] southeast of [[Oasis|The Oasis]] to begin. This chapter awards Explorer 1 shoulders and +350 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]].

==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Outcast Hizfran]]'s belongings from [[North Sufaad]].
*[[Ways of the Priesthood]]
*[[Scepter of Priesthood]]
*[[K'areshi Priest's Bowl]]

==Description==
I felt it. Something happened in that dome. Something--no... someone...

My friend, I do not know your name or where you came from, but this is it! It has to be!

The ruined town of Sufaad to the southeast of here was where I resided as a [[Wastelander]]. Please go there and bring back my scepter, prayer book, and ceremonial bowl. There was no time to pack. I just ran, so the items could be anywhere within the town.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Once I have my belongings, I will be able to walk the path of the old ways. It is time to retake my true oath.

==Completion==
I knew it from the moment I saw you. The time is right for [[K'aresh]] to have his [[priest]]s back.

==Notes==
Before accepting, Hizfran has gossip:
{{dialogue|
You... Your face...

I recognize you from a time when we ethereals could still dream.

I was a priest of the old ways back then, before the Devouring.

It was then that we made the pact with Salhadaar and became Wastelanders. My heart was never there--how could I give myself to a king when I have always believed that K'aresh was still alive?

I broke my oath to the king, and was cast out with the penalty of death if I ever returned.

{{gossip|You recognize me from a dream?}}

Yes. I was a priest of K'aresh back then. We were not in this form. It has been so long that I can't even remember my own face. Your face, though, came to me in a vision-dream during the last days of the Devouring.

I saw you standing here, lips moving, hands gesturing, but there was no sound. I felt lost, just like now. You helped me find my true self again. At the time, I thought it was nothing but a nightmare. The real nightmare started shortly after.

{{gossip|How long ago was that?}}

Hmm, a hundred thousand years, perhaps more? Who can count anymore? The perk and flaw of being immortal is that time is meaningless. 

But meaningless as it is, it was all I needed to break two oaths--one to Nexus-King Salhadaar himself when I left his ranks. The other...

<Hizfran lowers his gaze, deep in thought.>

It is a subject that weighs heavy upon my shoulders.

{{gossip|You broke oaths?}}

Oh yes. You see, we were all lost after the Devouring. We lost our home, identity, and unity. Nexus-King Salhadaar called us to his flag. I joined, of course--many of us have. By doing so, I have broken my oath to serve K'aresh, for good or bad.

I couldn't keep my oath to Nexus-King Salhadaar as time passed. It felt wrong. I was still here, walking on this barren husk of K'aresh, but it wasn't gone. Even a husk is better than nothing! 

Once I broke that second oath, the mark of death came upon my head. I can no longer be part of our society in its current state. Oaths are sacred, and breaking two of them... You understand.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Outcast Hizfran|Thank you, stranger--for your kindness and for looking past my oath-breaking.}}

The ways and the bowl are marked on the minimap and the scepter drops from [[Oathspeaker Al'joul]], patrolling near the bowl:
:{{text|say|Oathspeaker Al'joul|This scepter is mine by law!}}
:{{text|say|Oathspeaker Al'joul|Another will hunt Hizfran... forever.}}
