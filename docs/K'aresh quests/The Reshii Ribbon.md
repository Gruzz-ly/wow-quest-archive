==Objectives==
Convince [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] to let [[Xal'atath]] perform the ritual of transformation on you.
* Stay a while and listen to Alleria (Optional)
* Alleria convinced
* [[Locus-Walker]]'s Reshii Ribbon acquired

==Description==
During the [[Devouring War]], I witnessed the horrific results of [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|the All-Devouring's]] presence. A mortal being cannot approach him at the [[Manaforge Omega|manaforge]]. He is the entropy of the end, and you are just flesh.

Xal'atath knows rituals from across the [[Great Dark Beyond]]. With the power of the [[Reshii Ribbons]], she was able to transform the K'areshi so they could withstand Dimensius.

Alleria will not like this plan. You must convince her!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Every moment spent debating or arguing is a moment closer to Dimensius emerging.

==Completion==
She agreed? 

Alleria listens to you, my champion. You are indeed our savior.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|Say|Locus-Walker|We cannot delay, <name>. Grab hold of my Reshii Ribbon. Xal'atath will transmute you into energy. as she did the K'areshi.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|This is madness! Don't let that monster touch you!}}

Speak with Alleria:
{{Dialogue|Now I am learning that somehow, Xal'atath had a hand in transmuting the ethereals into what they are today? How did that work for them? They have lost everything. How can Locus-Walker even look at her?

I don't know what to think about the Reshii Ribbons either. They sound like dangerous artifacts. What else can they do? What else can Xal'atath do with them? If they are really that powerful, shouldn't we protect them from her?

{{gossip|quest=|What if it is the only way?}}

{{dialogue-child|Are you sure, <name>? This is madness!

You and I, we have no idea what she can do with that ribbon. How do I know it will even work? What if it only works on the ethereals' previous form? How do I know if you will come back? What if you are hurt, or worse?

All we have is Xal'atath's word for it, which is worth nothing to me!

The only lead I have is Locus-Walker and his words that are becoming hollow. I don't know if I can trust him either. You are the only one I can still trust.

{{gossip|quest=|I understand the risk.}}}}

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}

Upon choosing the Stay awhile and listen option,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|You were the one that transformed the [[ethereal]]s and [[broker]]s? I was told it was the energies of the Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|The Void doesn't transform, it consumes. My skill and the power of the Reshii Ribbons were required to change the K'areshi.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|The [[Ravel]] worked in secret, ensuring our people could survive Dimensius's energies and the inevitable destruction of K'aresh.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|You didn't tell your people the truth? To this day they think it was Dimensius who changed them.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|The Void feeds on conflict and panic. Had these Ravel villains told the people how they intended to save them, it only would have empowered Dimensius.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|That's--not how I would have put it. But she is right that there was neither time nor trust. We had a difficult choice to make.}}

Other gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Locus-Walker|I knew it would be difficult having Alleria and Xal'atath try to work together. I wish Windrunner could understand the magnitude of the threat that Dimensius poses.

When K'aresh faced this threat before, we were only able to survive the shattering of the All-Devouring and our world because of the transformation the Harbinger offered using our Reshii Ribbons. I do not trust her, but I understand her. She needs us to survive, and we need her.}}

{{dialogue|title=Xal'atath|Even in his weakened state, Dimensius's power is overwhelming.

We must work faster, together.

{{gossip|What do you know about Reshii Ribbons?}}

When I first met them, the members of the Ravel each carried a Reshii Ribbon. The Ribbon was both a representation of the status of its wielder and a conduit, through which great energies could be channeled.

Hundreds of thousands of years have passed, and it seems their powers have only grown. I can sense Locus-Walker's Reshii Ribbon now, just begging to be unleashed... and a few more in these islands around us.

{{Gossip|What is your involvement with the Reshii Ribbons and the K'areshi?}}

My dear.

<Xal'atath chuckles.>

That is someone else's secret to tell. Another time, perhaps.

{{gossip|I'd like to talk about something else.}}
}}

;Upon convincing Alleria
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Do it, <name>. I will make sure she restores you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|With only one ribbon, the transformation is singular and temporary. Your assurance is unnecessary.}}

Interact with Locus-Walker's Reshii Ribbon, then turn in to Xal'atath.
