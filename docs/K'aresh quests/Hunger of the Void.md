'''Hunger of the Void''' concludes the optional "In Search of Darkness" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Magister Umbric]] at [[Shan'dorah]] on the southeastern shore of the northwestern island of [[K'aresh]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Reconvene with [[Magister Umbric]] and [[Leona Darkstrider|Leona]] back in [[Shan'dorah]].
* Report back to Umbric

==Description==
I did all I could to prevent this outcome. If you hadn't pushed [[Adarus Duskblaze|him]] through the portal the unrestrained void energy would've collapsed [[Voidscar Cavern|the cave]] around us.

He was strong. In a way. I think that worked against him.

Meet me back in Shan'dorah. I need to report to Umbric and let him know what happened here.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Sandals of the Endless Hunger]]
* [[Waders of the Endless Hunger]]
* [[Striders of the Endless Hunger]]
* [[Sabatons of the Endless Hunger]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|46|80}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[K'aresh Trust]]

==Progress==
I could feel the void energies roiling from here, <class>. What exactly happened?

==Completion==
I sincerely hope that Adarus is well, and that he doesn't blame us. The ren' dorei have enough enemies as it is.

I am excited that Leona has made a breakthrough. Though she never would have succeeded without your help.

==Notes==
Head back to [[Shan'dorah]] and check back in with Magister Umbric as Leona runs up:
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Leona! You're well I see! Did you learn anything from that Demon Hunter?}}

Pick Umbric's {{gossip|quest=|<Listen to Leona's report.>}} gossip option:
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|We attempted to infuse Adarus with the Void. He is strong, but there were complications.}}
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|He was partially successful. Though the backlash of energy nearly brought the cavern down on top of us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|I see. Does he live?}}
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|I believe so. We were forced to push him through a portal, and his current whereabouts are unknown.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|What of your experiments? Did you learn the secret of harnessing the Void in this way?}}
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|I'm getting closer, Magister. The K'areshi fragment is inert, but intact. Given time, or a better teacher, I can master these techniques.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Good. I hope Adarus can forgive us for saving him from his own folly. You did well. Thank you for assistance in this, <name>.}}

Adarus shows up later in [[Manaforge Omega]] as part of [[The Soul Hunters]] encounter!
