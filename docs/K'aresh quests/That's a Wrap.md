'''That's a Wrap''' concludes chapter four of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]], "Shadows En Garde". The fifth and final chapter starts immediately after with [[Manaforge Omega: Dimensius Looms]], sending players into the raid.

This quest also unlocks the campaign skip in week two and beyond of the patch, as well as the start of the [[Ecological Succession]] system. Find [[Om'talad]] in the [[Tazarest]] of [[Tazavesh]] to begin [[The Oasis (quest 2)]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Xal'atath]] to assemble the Reshii Ribbons.
* Speak to [[Xal'atath]]
* Reshii Wraps
* Speak with [[Locus-Walker|Locus Walker]] (optional)

==Description==
The possibilities have begun to narrow. We are on the cusp of victory. Are you ready, my champion, to fulfill your oath against Dimensius?

<Xal'atath chuckles.>

Very well. I have some promises of my own to keep. Let us formalize our defense against Dimensius by the platform toward the manaforge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 18,300 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +2,500 reputation with [[K'aresh Trust]]

==Progress==
What is Xal'atath's game here? She had ample opportunity to trick us.

==Completion==
Stay vigilant my friend. Xal' atath's games have not yet unfolded.

We must be prepared for her inevitable betrayal.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Come, <Name>! We have a [[Void Lord]] to kill.}}
:''[[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Xal'atath]], and [[Locus-Walker]] depart''

Head to the entrance of [[Manaforge Omega]] where [[Locus-Walker]] and [[Alleria Windrunner]] and [[Xal'atath]] are ready.
:{{Text|Say|Dimensius|Arise!}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|We haven't much time. We must begin the ritual!}}

Speak with Xal'atath:
{{dialogue|Here we are. On the precipice of victory. So many possibilities between here and there.

{{gossip|quest=|You have promises to keep. Xal'atath.}}

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Xal'atath combines the ribbons" starts:
{{#ev:youtube|KD8eojIfvpY|Xal'atath combines the ribbons}}
:''The Waves of energy blasts through Xal'atath, Locus-Walker, Alleria Windrunner, the [[adventurer]], & the void elves. Xal'atath turn towards Alleria, Locus-Walker and the adventurer.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|It is time!}}
:''Xal'atath brings out her Reshii Ribbon.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|Present your Reshii Ribbons.}}
:''Locus-Walker and Alleria brought out their Reshii Ribbon. Locus-Walker lifts his right hand to the adventurer to give him the Reshii Ribbon.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|I will fulfill my word.}}
:''The Adventurer gives the Reshii Ribbon to Locus-Walker and he gives the two Reshii Ribbons to Xal'atath. Alleria hesitates and looks at her Reshii Ribbon.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I can't.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|It's madness to trust her with this power!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|Dimensius is almost upon us!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|How many worlds must be destroyed?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|Time grows short.}}
:''Xal'atath walk towards Alleria.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|Combine your ribbon, or...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|Use it to destroy me--}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|As it once destroyed K'aresh.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|Choose, Alleria!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|Alleria...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|Please.}}
:''Another waves of energy burts causing Locus-Walker to groan painfully.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Dimensius|Devour...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Arrrrrrrgh!}}
:''Alleria looks away as she brought her Reshii Ribbon at Xal'atath. Xal'atath takes the last Reshii Ribbon and smirks at Alleria. She combine the ribbons and gave everyone the ability of Phase-shift.''

On the other side of the cutscene, interact with the Reshii Ribbons and imbue with the Reshii energy.

Locus-Walker has gossip:
{{dialogue|Getting our force here was just the beginning. We must still face the All-Devouring.

{{gossip|<Stay a while and listen.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|I must talk to you before we cross the threshold, Windrunner.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|When you behold the Void Lord you will understand. You will know why my actions were necessary.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|No, Locus-Walker. I won't.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|You became a monster to defeat Dimensius. You sacrificed your world, your loved ones... I would never do that!}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|There was no other way!}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|That's what you keep telling me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We lied and manipulated our way to this victory, because that is how she does things!}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|You think you've escaped the Void, that you are its master.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|But every dark whisper in my head confirms that you are lost. You are the Void's creature, no better than Xal'atath.}}
:''Locus-Walker sighs''
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Windrunner...}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I will follow <Name> into that manaforge. For [[Azeroth]]! For K'aresh. For all the worlds unknown who we will spare this cruel fate.}} (Audio: "I will follow the champion into that manaforge. For [[Azeroth]]! For K'aresh. For all the worlds unknown who we will spare this cruel fate.")
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Then we are done. You are no longer my teacher, no longer my compatriot... No longer my friend.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Alleria...}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Lead on, <name>. Dimensius awaits.}}
