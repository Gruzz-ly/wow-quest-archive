'''The Wrong Bluecephalus''' starts the third day of questing to acquire the [[Blue Barry]] mount. To begin, reach Renown 9 with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and find [[Ba'eth]] in [[Tazavesh]].

==Objectives==
Speak with Ba'eth and others.
*Speak with [[Ba'eth]]
*Speak with [[Chef Xy'Zin|Xy'Zin]]

==Description==
We may have gotten off on the wrong foot, but there's something you should know.

That old [[slateback]] you used to haul all those imports? I thought it was just another worn-out nag, but it turns out it was the real treasure all along.

A rare bluecephalus, worth a fortune!

You might want to figure out where it went, and why Ba'eth isn't exactly rushing to share the profits!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are you ready to help?

==Completion==
Good. This will be a profitable venture... for me.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Ba'eth]]:
{{dialogue|
A pleasure to see you again.

{{gossip|quest=|What happened to that blue slateback?}}

That Blue Slateback? 

Once it was released from it's crate, it was no longer suitable for the Oasis reclamation. Contaminants could have compromised it's purity.

I gave it to Xy'Zin, he said it would make a wonderful gift for his daughter's birthday.}}

Speak with [[Chef Xy'Zin]]:
{{dialogue|
My dishes are crafted using only the finest of high quality ingredients.

{{gossip|quest=|Did Ba'eth give you a Blue Slateback?}}

What? Slateback? 

No, no. Absolutely not. Nothing of the sort here. We use only the finest quality meat. Every dish is prepared with the utmost care and the highest standards.

You have my word!

{{gossip|quest=|What about your daughter's birthday?}}

Daughter? I have no children!

Look, I never turn down fresh meat. I thought I could use the nag, but the blue color worried me--could have been void contamination. That taints the aroma!

I got rid of it, quickly!

Now, you do me a favor, and I'll tell you exactly where it went.}}
