==Objectives==
Disable 6 [[Shadowguard Power Pylon]]s in [[Shadow Point]] on [[K'aresh]].
* Power Pylon disabled (6)

==Description==
Turning into beings of energy was a choice we made when we had no other option. In the time since then, we have become reliant on consuming energy to survive. 

The [[Shadowguard]] are feeding that power to [[Dimensius]]. His hunger is infinite, and he will drain the energy from [[K'aresh]] to fuel his re-emergence. We must destroy this machinery that feeds him, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Are they all dealt with?

==Completion==
My people's technomancy could be put to great and beneficial use. Yet time and time again we use it for great evil. As Dimensius's power grows, we are all diminished.

==Notes==
Accept all three quests:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We need to destroy the Shadowguard or their army will overrun us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|Call upon Narathe in battle if you need aid.}}
:''[[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Locus-Walker]], [[Soul-Scribe]], [[Narathe]], and [[Xal'atath]] depart.''

All over [[Shadow Point]], defeat enemies, interact with [[Shadowguard Power Pylon]]s, and rescue the 6 [[Captured Wastelander]]s.

During the three quests, [[Narathe]] accompanies the party:
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|We will be oracles again!}}

Head to [[Shadow Point: Torment]] where [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Locus-Walker]], [[Soul-Scribe]], and [[Narathe]] awaited and turn in the three quests.
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|A trained mind can withstand the Void. This manaforge untethers the soul, then binds it to Dimensius.}}
