'''An Eye for Trouble''' concludes the optional "That Tazavesh Taste" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Trader Ba'kril]] inside [[Bra'kril's Iniquities]] in northwest [[Tazavesh]] to begin.

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Bakishroth the Empowered.jpg|Bakishroth the Empowered|Defeat this aberration before it sets other monsters loose in the city!}}
Defeat Bakishroth the Empowered and save [[Tazavesh]]!
*[[Bakishroth the Empowered]] slain {{co|59.6|46.7|Tazavesh||1}}

==Description==
If we were to consider the silver lining here, it is that we now know [[New Energy Drink|our concoction]] works. Just not on whom we wished.

I do not suppose you have it in you to defeat this empowered version of the creature? It is only our reputations and the future of Tazavesh at stake.

Another chance to prove you truly are as mighty as they say.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Unstable Sample Armplates]]
*[[Unstable Sample Bindings]]
*[[Unstable Sample Bracers]]
*[[Unstable Sample Straps]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*15,250 [[XP]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]
*[[The K'aresh Trust Commendation]] <!-- (warbound bonus, needs template and the other item.) -->

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
All is not lost. This will blow over in time and I now know the drink can work.

I will get it right next time, and we will have a tool in our arsenal in case another "well-intentioned" group like the [[Ravel]] rises again to reign destruction down upon us.

I might need to lay low for a bit, but you, <name>--you are a hero! And heroes deserve rewards. Let me see here...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|Quickly now, my friend, before Bakishroth unleashes terror upon the city and we wished we were back in the [[Shadowlands]].}}

Head east into the [[Grand Menagerie]] where [[Visiting Broker]]s are cowering in fear. Attack Bakishroth the Empowered:
:{{Text|say|Bakishroth the Empowered|YOU! You did this to me. For that, you have the privilege of being the first to die.}}

And kill it:
:{{Text|say|Bakishroth the Empowered|Ignoble. To die in this void-forsaken city...}}

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Trader Ba'kril|I will continue to work on the formulation. Now, where did I put my luggage?}}

Completing this quest also awards the "That Tazavesh Taste" criterion of [[Sojourner of K'aresh]].
