==Objectives==
Meet with Myi Koo, enter untethered space and collect 10 Untethered Energy Samples.
*Speak with [[Myi Koo]]
*[[Untethered Energy Samples]] collected  (10)
*Phase Conduit used to enter [[Untethered Space]]

==Description==
Untethered batteries are difficult to create, as they require elusive energies that leak from void storage cells into Untethered Space.

However, I know of an individual capable of harvesting this energy. If they can extract and store the energy and return it to me, we will have the necessary components to construct a battery.

Speak to Myi Koo and collect the energy, we can then create a battery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Untethered Battery]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the required energy.

==Completion==
Myi Koo is fully charged with Untethered Energy.  More than enough to build a battery.

==Notes==
Speak with Myi Koo at 54.4 / 48.6:
{{dialogue|Analyzing... Ready to assist.

{{gossip|quest=|Can you assist me?}}}}

Myi Koo will follow you around. Use the nearby Phase Conduit to enter untethered space. Bring him to any [[Energy Leak]] in the [[Serrated Peaks]] and he will say:
:{{text|say|[[Myi Koo]]|Gathering}}

You do not need to protect him; just bring him to the energy leaks. His movement speed is slow so he may take some time to catch up. It also appears that if you are standing near a node, a bug might cause him to pause and say gathering even though he is not close enough to actually cast. 

There is also an energy leak at 55.2 / 48.1 that can be difficult to get him to path to. Once you are done, you can cancel the [[Phase Diving]] buff and fly back to Engineer Om'loof.
