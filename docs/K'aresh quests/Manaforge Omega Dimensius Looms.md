:{{Text|Yell|Dimensius|No! I will not be bound here! I will devour your world! I will be reborn!}}
:''Dimensius is sealed out.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Locus-Walker]]|Can it truly be? At long last, the All-Devouring is vanquished... my world, my people... we are finally avenged.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|Do not savor this victory for too long. With Dimensius's defeat, the Dark Heart is on the verge of collapse.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|I'll hold open the way so you can make your escape... but to do so, I must remain on this side of the portal.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|Which would leave you trapped in here. How selfless of you.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|Some sacrifices are inevitable, I suppose. But fear not, Alleria. I always find a way to survive.}}

Loot the corpse for [[A Dimmed Crystal]] or [[A Curious Crystalline Fragment]] for priests.

Head to the portal and a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cutscene]] starts:
{{#ev:youtube|uLdw6mUADKI}}

:''Alleria and Locus-Walker returned to the [[Seat of the Devourer]] from the portal as it closes from behind.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|We did it. Dimensius is gone.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|Not gone...}}
:''Locus-Walker turn towards the Dark Heart as it stutters.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|But contained within the Dark Heart.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|As is Xal'atath.}}
:''Alleria chuckled.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|A fitting end for her.}}
:''Alleria is wracked by ethereal screeching and a flash of Xal'atath staring at her laughing.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|No! Wait!}}
:''Locus-Walker grabs the Dark Heart and it begins to cause an eruption as Locus-Walker screams in agony trying to resists. He begins to wither away and Alleria watches in horror before trying to reach him. Locus-Walker crumbled into dust and explodes knocking Alleria. She then wakes up as Xal'atath laughs and Alleria looks at her as she left the Dark Heart.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|You...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|What did you do?!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|I kept my promise.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|Together, we vanquished Dimensius. And I now have all I need to claim what is mine.}}
:''Xal'atath takes the Dark Heart and turns away and laughs.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|Oh, this has been a delight, Alleria.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|But our little game is over.}}
:''Alleria grunts in exertion and run towards Xal'atath but she was too late as Xal'atath vanished.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|When next we meet...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|I will take everything you love.}}
:''Alleria grabs the remains of Locus-Walker as she stares at it in horror.''

On the other side of the cutscene Alleria has the portal opened. Speak with her:

{{dialogue|We battled back the darkness, but at what cost?

{{gossip|How should we proceed?}}

:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We stopped Dimensius... but now his power is Xal'atath's.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Locus-Walker should have listened to me. But what would it have mattered?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Dimensius had to be stopped. But in the end, the one who profited most was Xal'atath.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|And now we must stop her--more powerful, and without my mentor, our ally who understood her best.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I... need time. We will discuss this outcome later.}}
