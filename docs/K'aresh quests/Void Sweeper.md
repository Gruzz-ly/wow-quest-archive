{{dialogue|
Ah, look what the gentle breeze of K'aresh brought me. You are here to sweep the void spores. Right? I hurt my arm the other day, so I won't be able to ride. But maybe...

{{gossip|quest=|You want me to do your job?}}

Want? It's more like a need.

Why don't you take M'arla and let her eat the voidspores?{{sic}} That is her favorite snack.

{{gossip|quest=|OK, I will do it.}}
}}

Mount the [[mana ray]] [[M'arla]] and fly through the Void Spores to devour them.
