==Objectives==
Search [[Eco-Dome: Rhovan]] for [[Om'bera]].
*[[Supply Crates Manifest|Clue found]] {{co|70.9|54.4|K'aresh}}
*Om'bera found
*[[Curved Dagger (quest item)|Dagger collected]]

==Description==
Eco-Dome: Rhovan was shattered by a falling chunk of void glass, destroying the structure and scattering its caretakers. They have returned to recover whatever equipment, flora, or fauna can be salvaged before the wastes claim them. 

Search the ruins to find any clues of Overseer Om'bera's fate. We must have her [[Reshii Ribbon]]! [[Om'resh]] and I will search the impact crater.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Could Om'bera still be somewhere within the wreckage?

==Completion==
The [[Wastelanders]] killed Om'bera and took her Reshii Ribbon. These fallen oracles have harried all members of the Ravel since the [[Devouring War]]. This is a grim day.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Rhovan Infestation]] before heading out. On accept of both:

:{{Text|Say|[[Om'resh]]|She was right behind me! I should have... I should...}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|She may yet be within! I will stay with you while the champion searches the dome.}}

;Upon interacting with [[Om'bera's Clipboard]] and obtaining the [[Supply Crates Manifest]]
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|A manifest of supply crates Om'bera was hoping to retrieve. No sign of her. Keep looking.}}

Find Om'bera's corpse further north:
{{Dialogue|<Om'bera lies still on the ground. surrounded by the remains of some of her attackers. She seems to have put up a fight before she was defeated.>}}

:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Dead. Her Reshii Ribbon is nowhere to be found. Has the Shadowguard divined our plan?}}

Interact with the [[Death Scavenger]] in her back and collect the [[Curved Dagger (quest item)]]:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|A Tabiqa ritual dagger, once wielded by the oracles of K'aresh.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|They are "Wastelanders" now, assassins sworn to slay the Ravel. They must have killed Om'bera and taken her ribbon.}}

Nearby are [[Wastelander Remains]]:
{{dialogue|<A pile of shredded wrappings lies here, with a slowly dimming orb of arcane energy hovering about it.

Om'bera seems to have given a good accounting of herself before she was overwhelmed.>}}

On return:
:{{Text|Say|Om'resh|I can't believe she's gone. We have been a team for thousands of years.}}
