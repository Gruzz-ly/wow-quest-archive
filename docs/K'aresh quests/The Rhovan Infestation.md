==Objectives==
Kill 10 invasive creatures in [[Eco-Dome: Rhovan]].
* Invasive creatures slain (10)

==Description==
When the meteor struck, [[Om'bera]] and I tried to salvage what we could. Without the dome's shield, we were soon beset by scavengers of the [[Great Dark Beyond]]. We fled and were separated.

Such creatures are not of [[K'aresh]], and hostile to the stable biomes we sought to achieve. We need to clear these invasive creatures to find our equipment, and Om'bera.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
This was once a thriving eco-dome of the Trust. Our research worked toward the restoration of K'aresh.

==Completion==
Thank you. Those creatures would soon overwhelm us if left unchecked.

It's amazing they can survive without the protective barrier of the dome, without becoming energy as the K'areshi did. I wonder if such resilient traits could be transferred to the few native species in our domes?

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Shattered Dome]] before heading out. On accept of both:
:{{Text|Say|Om'resh|She was right behind me! I should have... I should...}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Locus-Walker]]|She may yet be within! I will stay with you while the champion searches the dome.}}

Slay the [[Void-touched Hopper]], the [[Gore Beak]]s, and the [[Void-touched Hoppling]]s.

On return:
:{{Text|Say|Om'resh|I can't believe she's gone. We have been a team for thousands of years.}}

==Progression==
{{Desert Power}}
