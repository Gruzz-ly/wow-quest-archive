==Objectives==
Collect 12 Discarded Shadow Writs.
*[[Discarded Shadow Writ]] (12)

==Description==
An Ethereal Seal grants unrestricted access and control over [[Ethereal]] assets without raising suspicion. Acquiring an authentic seal can be quite difficult. It is far easier to forge one using discarded cyphers instead. If you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, you can find discarded writs in the trash piles outside of [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|town]]. Bring those to me, and I can create a seal for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*[[Ethereal Seal]]

==Progress==
Did you find the Shadow Seals?

==Completion==
Oh, these are nice. A seal will be easy to create.

==Progression==
{{A Key Threat}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.2.0|added=}}
