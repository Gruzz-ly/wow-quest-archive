==Objectives==
20 Voidbane Gems collected.
*[[Voidbane Gem]] (20)
*Use the [[Phase Conduit]] to enter [[Untethered Space]] (optional)

==Description==
Voidbane Gems are dangerous business!

[[Shadowguard|The Shadowguard]] hide the gems in Untethered Space. You need to go in and find them. Be warned though, others may be looking for those gems as well!

I marked the location of [[Voidbane Stash|the stashes]] for you, but there's other gems laying around too. Grab what you can, and you'll have yourself a nice big pile of gems when you're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Pile of Voidbane Gems]]

==Progress==
Hurry, grab those gems before someone else does.

==Completion==
I knew you could do this. After my finders fee, you still have a nice pile of gems.

==Notes==
If you're not already in Untethered Space, use the nearby Phase Conduit. Look for [[Voidbane Stash]]s around [[Shadow Point]]. They can be looked for Voidbane Gems, often more than 1. [[Void Bane Gem (object)|Voidbane Gem objects]] can also be looted for a single gem. [[Phaseblade Bandit]]s and [[Cartel Xy Plunderer]]s have a chance to drop the gems as well, but the chance is not 100%. It is, however, quite high. Nearby [[Shadowed Fateshaper]] elites do NOT drop the gems.

When nearing a stash and being ambushed by [[Cartel Xy Plunderer]]s, they say these lines:
*{{text|say|Cartel Xy Plunderer|You're too late!}}
*{{text|say|Cartel Xy Plunderer|So easy!}}
*{{text|say|Cartel Xy Plunderer|All your gems are mine!}}

You can also find [[Associate Xy'got]] at {{co|50.66|19.34|K'aresh}}, who will sell you a [[Pouch of Voidbane Gems]] for 300 gold.
{{Dialogue|title=Associate Xy'got|Surprised to see me?  

You're not the only one [[Acquisitioner Xy'gui]] hired. I've seen others around here, not all of them as friendly as I am.

Now, these gems? I got to them first. But, I might be willing to part with them... for the right price.

{{buy|Let me see what you have to offer.}}}}

It's a little weird that members of Cartel Xy would be against you, considering a member of Cartel Xy sent you to get the gems. Perhaps they plunder cartel Xy rather than being plunderes from cartel Xy.
