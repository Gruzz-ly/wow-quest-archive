==Objectives==
Kill Untethered Observers and collect phase energy in [[Untethered Space]] on [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]].
*[[Untethered Observer]]s slain (4)
*[[Phase Energy]] collected

==Description==
Untethered Space is an [[arcane]] phenomenon twisted by creatures of the [[Void]] that feed on its energy. Should we [[ethereal]]s damage our wraps or the [[broker]]s their suits, our energy cannot remain intact for long. Then, we fall into this layer of reality, possibly never to return.

The upside of this nightmare is that all the energy that falls out of phase is valuable. Use the Phase Conduit to enter Untethered Space, and fight the observers that scavenge phase energy there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Fascinating, isn't it?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. These predators from the Void ambush us and consume the very energy we use to power the eco-domes.

==Notes==
Drop back into [[Phase Diving]] and get to killing. The [[Phase Energy]] is marked on the map next to a tower.

==Progression==
{{Diving Into Phase Diving}}
