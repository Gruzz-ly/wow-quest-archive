==Objectives==
Meet [[Locus-Walker]] at [[Eco-Dome: Primus]].

==Description==
[[Xal'atath]] is correct. We need more than my one Reshii Ribbon to get a force to [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|Dimensius]]. 

There is an eco-dome south of here. The founder of the Trust is there, overseeing its operation. She acquired the domes from the Consortium. She claims they will be the key to restoring K'aresh. I am skeptical anything will be safe now that Dimensius stirs. 

She was a member of the Ravel and possesses a Reshii Ribbon. Surely she would lend it to us.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Eco-Stabilizer's Cord]]
* [[Eco-Stabilizer's Sash]]
* [[Eco-Stabilizer's Cinch]]
* [[Eco-Stabilizer's Girdle]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|85|}}
* 3,050 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
The Shadowguard attacked the eco-dome. They must covet the vast stores off energy needed to shield the delicate biomes from the Void of K'aresh.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Why did you even help the [[Ravel]] in the first place, Xal'atath?}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|The same reason I'm helping you. The promise of an end to the All-Devouring.}}
:''Locus-Walker teleports out and [[Xal'atath]] teleports as well. [[Alleria Windrunner]] brings out her [[gryphon]] and takes off.''

Head to the [[Eco-Dome: Primus]] where Locus-Walker, Xal'atath, and Alleria are with none other than [[Ve'nari]].

:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|I asked for your help, Locus-Walker. Instead, you've dragged the Harbinger to my dome.}}

Several characters have gossip: 
{{dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|The Shadowguard skulk in the shadows, but they will not extinguish the hope in this eco-dome.

If we can do anything to preserve this place, we must do it, <name>.}}

{{dialogue|title=Xal'atath|Hundreds of thousands of years, and Ve'nari is still as suspicious as ever.

How nostalgic.

<Xal'atath chuckles.>

We must convince her to contribute to the greater good, my champion.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Ve'nari|Lending is not something I do without something in return, and especially for something as powerful as a Reshii Ribbon.

You'll have to work for it. My eco-dome needs all the help I can coerce from my friends.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Locus-Walker|Do not be fooled by Ve'nari's demeanor. She has the best interests of K'aresh at her heart. She even swore an oath to restore K'aresh, and there is nothing more binding in our society than an oath.

We must play by her rules and earn her assistance.

I promise it will be worth it.}}
