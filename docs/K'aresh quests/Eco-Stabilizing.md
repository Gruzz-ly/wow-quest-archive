==Objectives==
Activate the disabled control consoles in [[Eco-Dome: Primus]].
*[[Control Console V-37|Biome V-37]] stabilized
*[[Control Console D-28|Biome D-28]] stabilized
*[[Control Console Z-22|Biome Z-22]] stabilized
*[[Rod of Activation]]
*[[Biome Eco-Stabilizer]]

==Description==
The [[Shadowguard]] attack caused chaos and disarray in this dome. Several control consoles have powered down, and my consultants are stretched thin reviving their assigned biomes and systems.

This is where you come in, traveler. It's an easy, but critical job. Find the disabled consoles and make sure they restart.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Are all the consoles operational? No?

Go switch them on!

==Completion==
Good work, <name>.

The interior of the dome is stabilized. All the eco-dome systems are functioning. My investment in the eco-domes will continue to pay dividends. Unless the Shadowguard attack again.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|Dangling your ribbon in front of us so we do your dirty work. You haven't changed, Ve'nari.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|I'll give <name> the ribbon when it's not the only thing keeping the biomes in this dome alive!}}

Head to the east where the [[Control Console V-37]] is found. 
{{Dialogue|<This control console shows high pressure build-up. You can hear a rattle coming from the panel.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Sometimes applying force is the best solution.>}}
}}

Once it's stabilized, the [[Shadowguard Assassin]] appears.
:{{text|say|Shadowguard Assassin|This dome's energy will feed Dimensius!}}

Slay the assassin.
:{{text|say|Shadowguard Assassin|For the--All-Devouring...}}

The consoles' description is updated.
{{dialogue|<Control consolve V-37 monitors earth worms and their effect on the flora from a world covered with a wild overgrowth of red vines. According to the information, most of the flora and fauna of that world have strong hues of red.>}}

At the southeast, lies [[Control Console D-28]]. Interact with it.
{{Dialogue|<This control console shows a "Missing Rod" error.>}}

Collect the [[Rod of Activation]] from the crate and put it on the console.

The consoles' description is updated.
{{dialogue|Controle Console D-28 has information about a distant desert world with large oases instead of oceans. The large bulbous palm tree in front of you is said to be the dominant flora on that world, and its trunk holds water and moisture that in the case of an emergency could last for several months.>}}

At [[Control Console Z-22]]:
{{dialogue|<This control console was tampered with. It looks like all the activation rods are in place, but something is bugging the system. There is a small Shadowguard device attached to its side.>}}

Upon removing the bug, the description of the Console changes.
{{dialogue|<The control console monitors the nitrate levels of plants from a distant world said to be covered with lush meadows and lakes.>}} 

Turn in both quests to [[Ve'nari]] once you also finish [[Damage Report 101]].

:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|The systems may be stabilized, but the Shadowguard continue to raid the eco-dome for its energy.}}
