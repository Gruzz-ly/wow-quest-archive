==Objectives==
Disrupt the [[Naakroan]] rituals.
*[[Siphoning Stave]]s destroyed (3)

==Description==
This isn't a temple anymore--it's an abattoir. They tear souls from captives to power their rituals. Right now, they're pouring stolen energy into our machine. I think I know why.

With the modifications we made, overloading the device with [[arcane]] energy will create a massive feedback loop. It'll disrupt our [[technomancy]] across [[K'aresh]]. The [[eco-dome]]s will fail. [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]] will be defenseless. We'll be just another feast for the Naakroans. If you can disrupt their rituals, it will buy us time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Stop the rituals. End the suffering of their captives.

==Completion==
That will slow them down, but I worry it's not enough. We need to end this before they destroy all of our work.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests:
:{{text|say|Om'taha|I'll find my way back in and meet you at the machine.}}
:''She runs off.''

The three staves are marked on the minimap. Get to them while killing adds.

Interact with one:
:{{text|say|Issam the Unraveler|For whom have we waited these long millennia?}}
:{{text|yell|Naakroan Crowd|Xal'atath!}}

The second:
:{{text|say|Issam the Unraveler|For whom do we labor? Who taught our hearts to hunger?}}
:{{text|yell|Naakroan Crowd|Xal'atath!}}

The third:
:{{text|say|Issam the Unraveler|For whom will we devour all the brokers' works?}}
:{{text|yell|Naakroan Crowd|Xal'atath!}}

Om'taha has new gossip at the turn-in location:
{{dialogue|
Look at what they've done... No, what we let them do. They would never have been able to corrupt the echo machine without our aid. 

I will put this right. For my friends, for K'aresh.}}
