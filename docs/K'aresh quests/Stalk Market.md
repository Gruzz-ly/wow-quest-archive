==Objectives==
Bring your discovery to [[Om'mit]] in [[Tazavesh]].
*[[Inscrutable Flora]] (provided)

==Description==
<The mysterious plant thrums in your hand. Someone in Tazavesh will know what to do with it. Look around the Veiled Market for an interested party.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<[[Om'mit]] turns the plant over in his hands.>

A [[void]]-infused stalk from a dead wasteland? This is utterly useless to you. In fact, let me take it off your hands in exchange for plants with more... familiar properties.

Other [[Cartel Om]] members in the Veiled Market may also be interested in trading wares, should you come across them.
