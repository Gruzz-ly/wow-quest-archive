==Objectives==
Investigate the void presence and locate the culprits behind the many troubles in [[Tazavesh]].
*Stay awhile and listen to Alleria at the Lap of Luxury (Optional)
*Investigate the [[Void Presence]]
*Locate the source
*Speak to [[Locus-Walker]]
*[[Shadowguard Infiltrator|Infiltrators]] defeated

==Description==
[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]], <name>, have you sensed it? The [[Void]] lingers in all of this. Whoever is pulling the strings is cloaked in shadow, hiding from us.

Come, let's seek them out and drag them into the light before they strike.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Band of the Unseen Hand]]
*[[Ring of Lingering Shadows]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,250 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We need to find the hidden Shadowguard, <name>.

==Completion==
The [[Shadowguard]]! Of course those void-addled fools are behind this. I should have known.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Locus-Walker]]|Do you sense that, Alleria?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|Yes. A void presence.}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|Get to safety, [[Om'en]]. Champion, with me!}}

Run in direct with Alleria and Locus-Walker where they found the void presence.
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|This void presence is fresh. It hasn't faded at all.}}

Alleria has a new {{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} option:
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Om'en called you a "[[Ravel]] [[Sorcerer]]." What did they mean?}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|During the first war against [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|Dimensius]], we K'areshi warred against each other as much as we fought against the Void.}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|I was part of the Ravel, a group of [[technomancer]]s, [[cartel]] leaders, and great thinkers. We focused on unorthodox solutions to the Dimensius problem.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Who warred against you?}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|[[Nexus-King Salhadaar|King Salhadaar]] rallied the oracles of [[K'aresh]] to his side. They thought to save the world. They almost doomed it.}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|We did not know at the time that the king had given an oath to the All-Devouring.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|So his hunt in [[Outland]] for Dimensius was just--a ruse?}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|A ploy. He radicalized those in the [[Ethereum|Etherium]]{{sic}} seeking out the fragments of Dimensius, for later conscription.}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|The death of Salhadaar did not end the ascendancy of the [[Shadowguard]] as many in the [[Consortium]] had hoped.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|How can we win this fight?}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|We must find a way to bring a fighting force to the Shadowguard's [[Manaforge Omega|manaforge]]. We must prevent the All-Devouring's return.}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|If Dimensius should emerge fully formed, I know of nothing on this world capable of stopping him.}}

Interact with the [[Void Presence]].
:{{text|bossemote|The faint presence of the Void trails off into the city.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|<Name>, can you see it? Follow the trail!}}

Follow the source until it is chased into the [[P.O.S.T.]] building at {{Co|48.23|62.54|K'aresh}}.

:''Locus-Walker and Alleria come in.''
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|They must be in hiding. On your word I'll drag them from the shadows.}}

Speak to Locus-Walker:
{{Dialogue|I can feel it... They're lurking nearby. Whoever's behind the sabotage is clever, but not clever enough.

{{gossip|quest=|Let's see who is behind this.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|I'll drive them into the open. You must deal with them!}}
:''Locus-Walker is casting {{Abilities|Chaotic Revelation|id=||icon=}}.''

Slay as many [[Shadowguard Infiltrator]]s that ambush.
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|My ally warned me the Shadowguard were already in Tazavesh.}}

;Upon defeating the second wave
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I sense more movement in the shadows. Get ready!}}

;Upon defeating the third wave
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Your mysterious ally was correct.}}

[[Nyz'raal the Umbral Blade]] appears.
:{{Text|Say|Nyz'raal the Umbral Blade|You cannot stop us! Our plans are already in motion!}}

;Upon slaying him
:{{Text|Say|Nyz'raal the Umbral Blade|Dimensius devours all...}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|Well fought! Let us return to Om'en and see what more we can uncover.}}

Upon completion, the [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "The Shadowguards Attack" starts:
{{#ev:youtube|cjawgo0_UyE}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Dimensius the All-Devouring|Doom...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|Dimensius the All-Devouring... His return grows ever closer!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Invaders!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|They raid our energy to feed their master. Champion! Windrunner! We have a city to save.}}

{{Rfptr-section}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Everyone hears a deep voice from the darkness, The player can't understand what is being said but the [[Broker]]s/[[Consortium]] people are clearly freaking out.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Suddenly, a tear rips open in the sky and enerygy blasts chaotically start raining down upon the city.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Portals that look similar to the creature teleporter effect we used earlier begin to appear with Shadowguard swarming out.}}
