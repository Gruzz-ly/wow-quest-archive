==Objectives==
Recover [[Shahata]]'s stolen supplies.
*[[Shahata's Supplies]] (6)

==Description==
[[Om'fennad|Fennad]] picked a poor time to ask for my help. I'm leaving as soon as I recover my supplies from the [[Sufaadi]].

I was passing through when they attacked, and they could have killed me if [[Ruya]] hadn't carried me off. I followed them back to [[Sufaad]], but there are too many for me to deal with.

If you help me recover my supplies, I'll see what I can do to help Fennad.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Hopefully they haven't used everything up.

==Completion==
Is this all you found? They didn't waste any time using up my supplies. Still, it's something.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|So you'll help us?}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|If your friend can help me, then I'll do what I can.}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|I'm not one to break my word.}}

The two named targets are marked on the minimap alongside all the Stolen Supplies crates in [[North Sufaad]].
