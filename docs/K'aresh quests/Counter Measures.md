==Objectives==
Kill 12 Shadowguard forces in [[Serrated Peaks]].
*[[Shadowguard]] forces eliminated (12)

==Description==
I cannot relinquish my [[Reshii Ribbon]] just yet, <name>. Not while the Shadowguard assaults my eco-dome from their camp in Serrated Peaks. Take the fight to them! If you decimate their forces, they will stop this assault. 

Bring [[Locus-Walker]]'s apprentice, [[Alleria]]. She looks like she knows how to handle herself in a fight. She also keeps staring daggers at [[Xal'atath|the Harbinger]], and I don't have time to play peacemaker between those two.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The Shadowguard are still attacking. Did you decimate their numbers yet?

==Completion==
Good job, <name>. That should satisfy Ve'nari.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Destroy the Shadowguard's camp, and I'll give my Reshii Ribbon to the cause.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I'll go with <name>. Meet me at the camp.}}
:''Alleria runs off.''

Pick up [[Her Dark Side]] and [[Divide and Conquer (quest)]] from [[Xal'atath]] before heading out.

Alleria has gossip upon reaching the camp:
{{dialogue|Strike its head, and the body will fall.}}

Kill [[Shadowguard Riftcaller]]s, [[Shadowguard Speardancer]]s, and [[Shadowguard Voidblade]]s.

==Progression==
{{Void Alliance}}
