==Objectives==
Collect 8 Stolen Barrier Projectors for [[Ba'ver]].
*[[Stolen Barrier Projector]] (8)

==Description==
This is not a good day, not at all! My whole shipment of barrier projectors was ransacked! Most of them are gone, and it seems whatever the culprits didn't take, they destroyed.

These barrier projectors are essential for securing the wild places on K'aresh, and even the city of Tazavesh. Our efforts are in jeopardy!

Please, if you can find any of my shipments it would help us get our efforts back on track.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]

You will receive one of:
*[[Tazavesh Guardian's Epaulets]]
*[[Tazavesh Guardian's Shoulderguards]]
*[[Tazavesh Guardian's Mantle]]
*[[Tazavesh Guardian's Shoulderpads]]

==Progress==
Have you located my barrier projectors?

==Completion==
Excellent! With these projectors, we can once again secure our homeland.

Anyway, you have my thanks for your assistance.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Ba'ver|No, no, no! The Barrier Projectors! You, come here! I need competent assistance!}}
