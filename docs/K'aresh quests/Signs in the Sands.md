==Objectives==
Follow [[Om'fennad]] to his village.
*Catch up with Om'fennad {{co|60.5|54.5|K'aresh}}
*Footprints investigated {{co|57.6|54.0|K'aresh}}
*Speak to [[Sahata|the stranger]]

==Description==
Things are starting to feel familiar. I think I know the way back to my village.

I should tell you... I'm not just looking for my sister. Our mother died when I was studying in the cities. Shahata buried her under her favorite tree, but I wasn't there. I swore I would come home to conduct the funeral rites, but I didn't make it in time.

I have left my oath unfulfilled for far too long. I owe it to mother to at least try now. Come--let's search the village.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
This can't be it! There must be something left.

==Completion==
I don't know what I expected. She's right. I did break my oath, and now the village is gone.... She's still here, though. 

If she has anything that belonged to our mother, then there's still a chance the surveyor can trace it to the grave.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|I think I know the way to the village!}}
:''Om'fennad runs off.''

Head northeast past [[Naakroa]] to the northeastern edge of the island to catch up with Om'fennad:
:{{text|yell|Om'fennad|No, no, no... The village was here. It was right here!}}
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|Stay calm. You see if that trail leads anywhere, and I'll search here.}}

Follow the footsteps west and stop at the sparkling footprints:
:{{text|say|[[Writ-Weaver]]|You're not the one who's been following us. Unfortunate for us both. Dispose of them.}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|Robbing another traveler, [[Wastelander]]?}}
:{{text|say|Writ-Weaver|Give up your chase. Your luck won't last.}}

Speak with Shahata:
{{dialogue|I've been tracking those [[Sufaadi]] since they raided my camp. That was the first opening I had.

<Shahata keeps a firm grip on her weapon.>

Forgive me if I keep my distance. Strangers and coincidences are often deadly in the wastes. What are you doing here?

{{gossip|quest=|I'm helping a broker named Om'fennad.}}}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|Om'fennad... Fennad? He's alive? I'm sorry--I have to go.}}
:''Shahata hops on her mount and flies off.''

Return to Om'fennad and Shahata is hovering nearby!
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|I can find her grave! You must still have something that belonged to her.}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|There's nothing left to honor. I don't have time to help an oath-breaker.}}
