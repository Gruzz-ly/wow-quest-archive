==Objectives==
Kill 7 [[Shadowguard]] around [[Eco-Dome: Primus]].
*Shadowguard forces slain (7)

==Description==
We may have driven the saboteurs out of the dome and repaired its systems, but that doesn't mean the Shadowguard is done with my domes. They're still hiding at the perimeter, trying to find a way to harvest the vast amounts of expensive energy needed to power the eco-dome.

I need you to fight them off. Then maybe this attack will truly end.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Oathsworn Defender's Leggings]]
*[[Oathsworn Defender's Breeches]]
*[[Oathsworn Defender's Greaves]]
*[[Oathsworn Defender's Legguards]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Did you get them all? Or are there still Shadowguard hiding around the perimeter, damaging my dome?

==Completion==
Good. That will buy us enough time to secure this dome.

==Notes==
Kill [[Shadowguard Scout]]s, [[Shadowguard Assassin]]s, and [[Shadowguard Saboteur]]s.

Once that is done, go to [[Ve'nari]] and [[Xal'atath]] to turn both quests in.

==Progression==
