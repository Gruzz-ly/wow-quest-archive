==Objectives==
Collect 4 [[Dune Wyrm]] essences and 6 [[Krolusk]] shells.
*[[Softly Swirling Mote]] (4)
*[[Krolusk Husk]] (6)

==Description==
Regrettably, the [[void glass]] was too unstable. However, I have another idea. I believe I can stabilize the glass, but only at the moment of its creation. First, I need motes from the wyrms outside the eco-dome to power my device.

While you're out there, hunt down some of those krolusks as well. Their husks can be ground down to make a pleasing beverage for which the folk in [[Shattrath City|Shattrath]] will pay the highest of prices.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Anything can be turned into profit, if you have the right market. It's all about knowing your buyers and finding that which they most desire.

I still think the void glass will be the most lucrative for me, but it needs to be able to hold together more solidly.

==Completion==
Ah, you return with motes and husks for me?

==Notes==
Before leaving, Driruj has new gossip:
{{dialogue|I have been off world numerous times. Why do I even come back here? 

My pact with Om'gith is a noose around my neck.}}

This time the entire eastern island of [[K'aresh]] lights up, so get hunting. Any [[krolusk]] like the [[Sand Strider]]s south of the Oasis or [[Gritshell Krolusk]]s to the east can drop a [[Krolusk Husk]], and [[Dune Wyrm]]s drop a [[Softly Swirling Mote]] east of the Oasis as well.

==Progression==
