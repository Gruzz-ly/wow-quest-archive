==Objectives==
Defeat [[Shadowguard]] in the sands of the [[Shatter Gorge]] surrounding [[Shan'dorah]] on [[K'aresh]].
*[[Shadowguard Phaseblade (K'aresh)|Shadowguard Phaseblade]] slain (6)
*[[Shadowguard Adept (K'aresh)|Shadowguard Adept]] slain (6)
*[[Shadowguard Voidtamer]] slain (3)

==Description==
With or without [[Xal'atath]], the Shadowguard have long been a thorn in my side. It would be wise to take out as many as we can on this rock. I still do not trust her, but we must focus on the enemy we can defeat right now.

Do not relent, <name>. If you see any Shadowguard, cut them down. A battle against them today saves us a battle against them tomorrow.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Soulbreaker's Sigil]]
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We still have many to defeat before we can progress.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. If the Shadowguard bled, I am certain the sands would be soaked.

Many more lay before us on the path to victory. There will be time for celebrations yet.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|The Shadowguard have begun their attack. This will be the first test of of our untrusting coalition.}}
:''[[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Soul-Scribe]], [[Locus-Walker]], [[Narathe]], and [[Xal'atath]] head out.''
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|The Shadowguard will not prevail this day. We fight so K'aresh may live.}}

Slay the Shadowguard Phaseblades, Adepts, and Voidmancers that are in the sands of the [[Shatter Gorge]] surrounding [[Shan'dorah]].

Once that is done, head southwest to Alleria and the party to turn in both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|While you fought, we scouted the Shadowguard. They must have a Reshii Ribbon.}}
