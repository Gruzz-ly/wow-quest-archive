==Objectives==
Collect 20 Void Shards.
*Collect [[Void-Infused Shard]]s (20)
*[[Mana Matrix]] (provided)

==Description==
I still believe void-infused glass is my ticket out of here.

The problem lies in the creation process itself. The motes you brought me can help stabilize the glass with the help of [[void]] energy. Lucky for us, there are numerous void surges on the edges of the glass crevasse.

I have charged a device with the motes. All you need to do is channel void energy through it! Stand where a surge is about to happen and then collect the glass that's formed. Easy! Oh, it might tingle a bit...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
There are many potential uses, and therefore potential markets, for newly created [[void glass]]. If we can get this right, I should be set up comfortably in a new home by week's end!

If you hold the device while standing in the void surges, the energy from the motes should help create more stable fragments.

==Completion==
Well? Let me see what you procured.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Driruj]]|I am 52 percent sure you won't get fried or cast into the Void. Those are some good odds!}}

Back to the void glass sands of the [[Tempest Fields]]. Look for void zones on the ground and use the Extra Action Button to pop a [[Void-Infused Shard]] or three out of it.

Gather twenty and return:
:{{text|say|[[Om'gith]]|You have been warned before, Driruj! [[K'aresh]] is not yours to plunder!}}
:{{text|say|Driruj|You're a fool if you think you can save this husk of a world, Om'gith.}}

==Progression==
{{Avoiding the Void}}
