==Objectives==
Collect a Tazavesh Facade, Ethereal Seal and a Zo'kita Fruit.
*[[Tazavesh Facade]]
*[[Ethereal Seal]]
*[[Zo'kita Fruit]]

==Description==
[[Xy'vox the Twisted]] the former constable of [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]], hailed from a powerful cartel family.

Unknown to most, the family's power was obtained from illegal crimes, all conveniently overlooked by Xy'vox.

When the truth came out, Xy'vox went into hiding. I believe the constable never left town, instead hides here in plain sight, continuing criminal activities.

Create a Refuge Dampener to reveal Xy'vox to all of Tazavesh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Xy'vox Refuge Dampener]]
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Combine the items to form the Refuge Dampener.

==Completion==
You have created a Xy'vox Refuge Dampener.
