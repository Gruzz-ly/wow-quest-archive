==Objectives==
Collect 18 Om'sto's Veilshards
*[[Om'sto's Veilshards]] (18)
*[[Vermin Attuned Optic-Visualizer]] (provided)

==Description==
I myself could sell you Veilshards, but my own supply has been stolen. The vermin of this city will not hesitate to steal them when my back is turned.

Follow any [[Thieving Scurrier]] to its nest, and you are sure to locate some stolen shards.

To assist you, I will provide a device capable of tracking the thieving vermin. Recover enough Veilshards to satisfy both our needs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[A Bag of Veilshards]]

==Progress==
Did you locate the veilshards?

==Completion==
Ah, I knew you'd come through! The upstanding citizen Om'sto is starting to think you might be very good for business.

==Notes==
This quest is similar to [[A Dozen Veilshards (quest)]]. You can find Thieving Scurriers around most of Tazavesh in front of trash piles. You will have an easier time locating them if you use the Vermin Attuned Optic-Visualizer which will grant you the buff [[Vermin Attuned Optic-Visualizer (buff)|Vermin Attuned Optic-Visualizer]]. This buff allows you to see the rodents through other objects as well as highlights them in red. Prodding one will start a minigame in which you must follow them to the shard. Though the scurriers can appear in the [[Bazaar of Tangible Delights]], it is unwise to search for them there. You may end up having to if your luck for drop rate isn't the best.

The buff appears to highlight quest NPCs in general as [[Katy Stampwhistle]] will glow if the [[Nor Void of Night]] world quest is active.
