'''Of Bonds and Boughs''' concludes the optional chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] of the same name. Find [[Om'fennad]] at [[Hosaas' Rest]] on the south shore of the western island of [[K'aresh]] to begin. 

==Objectives==
Help [[Om'fennad]] and [[Shahata]] honor their mother.
*[[Incense]] lit
*Follow the trail

==Description==
All that time in [[Tazavesh]], all I could think about was coming home. Now it's only brought more grief. Even if the [[Damaged Echo Surveyor|surveyor]] wasn't damaged, I still have nothing to trace back to our mother's grave.

<Om'fennad glances around the cave.>

See these markings? This was a shrine to the [[Exchange]]. I guess it's a fitting place to finally say goodbye. Would you be willing to help one last time? Nothing dangerous--just light some incense.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Cord of the First Oath]]
* [[Sash of the First Oath]]
* [[Cinch of the First Oath]]
* [[Girdle of the First Oath]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[K'aresh Trust]]

==Completion==
After all this time, I thought it would feel different when we honored the oath.

Maybe now's the time to stop thinking on the past. Thank you.

==Notes==
On accept, the two walk over to a spot to place some Incense. Interact with it and the two kneel:
:{{text|say|Shahata|K'aresh, hold our mother.}}
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|Wash from her the dust of this world.}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|Let her rest, and drink, and feast.}}
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|Be a better family to her than us.}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|Look!}}
:''The Echo Surveyor rises from the ground and starts glowing.''
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|But... how?}}
:''It flies out of the cave!''
:{{text|say|Shahata|Hurry--before the trail fades!}}
:''Shahata and Om'fennad hop on [[Ruya]] and they fly off.''

Mount up and follow the trail through the skyriding rings. The trail leads to a small island offshore to the east:
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|Is this her grave? How did it lead us here?}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|Mother... she taught us that prayer.}}
:{{text|emote|Shahata and Om'fennad lower their voices and whisper to the tree.}}

On complete:
:''The tree fades away!''
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|I shouldn't have waited to come home.}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|No, you shouldn't have.}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|But I'm glad you're here now.}}
:''They walk off together.''
