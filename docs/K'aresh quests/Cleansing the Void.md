==Objectives==
Help [[Outcast Hizfran]] with the ritual of return.
* Ritual started
* Place Bowl and Salt
* Book Placed
* Scepter Placed
* Ritual Concludes

==Description==
Now that you have brought me all that I need, the ritual of return can begin.

You see, stranger, the items you recovered were stowed in my hovel for over a hundred thousand years. The [[Void]] that surrounds us leaves its mark on everything it touches.

While grinding the mineral removed the impurities of the Void, I still need to cleanse myself and the items. Please help me with the ritual. I do not foresee any distractions or issues. We are very close now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Almost there, stranger... <name>. That is your name, is it not?

==Completion==
The ritual of return is over, but...

Did you feel it?

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Hizfran starts walking to the north.''
:{{text|say|Outcast Hizfran|Come, <name>. Help me with the ritual of return.}}
:{{text|say|Outcast Hizfran|I feel humbled and a sense of great joy that I will soon rebind myself to my ancient oath with [[K'aresh]].}}
:{{text|say|Outcast Hizfran|Please place the items in the locations that I have marked.}}

Place the three items in turn:
:{{text|say|Outcast Hizfran|A bowl of salt to drown my sins.}}
:{{text|say|Outcast Hizfran|These pages guide me to the old ways.}}
:{{text|say|Outcast Hizfran|A scepter to show me the way.}}
:''Hizran starts casting a spell.''
:{{text|say|Outcast Hizfran|The ritual of return is over... yet, something is amiss.}}
