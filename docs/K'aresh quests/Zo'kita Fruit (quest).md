8 Untethered Hide collected
*[[Untethered Hide]] (8)

You can have the fruit, but only if you do me a favor first. Something is watching us. You can't see it, but the smell of the fruit draws it to us. Hidden monsters lurking just beyond our sight. Gain access to the Untethered Space, hunt these creatures down, and bring me their hides. I want proof that these creatures actually exist!

==Progress==
Did you see them? Did you cut them to pieces?

I knew they existed, and these fabulous hides to show for it! Take this fruit as I promised.
