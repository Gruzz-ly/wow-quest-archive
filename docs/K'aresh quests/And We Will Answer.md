==Objectives==
Rescue Captured Wastelanders in [[Shadow Point]] on [[K'aresh]].
*[[Captured Wastelander|Trapped Wastelanders]] rescued (6)
*[[Beacon of the Wastes]] (provided)

==Description==
This is unthinkable. [[Heretical]]!

The [[Shadowguard]] have captured my warriors and are converting them into new troops for [[Dimensius]]--forcing an oath to serve the All-Devouring as the [[Void]] fills their being.

Free them, <name>. We cannot let this last any longer. I will send [[Narathe]] to aid you in this fight. She knows how to untether the souls of oath-breakers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Once an ethereal embraces the shadow, they are lost forever.

==Completion==
How many were lost, do you think?

I have a duty to my people. Let us finish this so none are forced to serve the All-Devouring again.

==Notes==
Accept all three quests:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We need to destroy the Shadowguard or their army will overrun us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|Call upon Narathe in battle if you need aid.}}
:''[[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Locus-Walker]], [[Soul-Scribe]], [[Narathe]], and [[Xal'atath]] depart.''

All over [[Shadow Point]], defeat enemies, interact with [[Shadowguard Power Pylon]]s, and rescue the 6 [[Captured Wastelander]]s.

During the three quests, [[Narathe]] accompanies the party:
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|We will be oracles again!}}

Head to [[Shadow Point: Torment]] where [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Locus-Walker]], [[Soul-Scribe]], and [[Narathe]] awaited and turn in the three quests.
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|A trained mind can withstand the Void. This manaforge untethers the soul, then binds it to Dimensius.}}
