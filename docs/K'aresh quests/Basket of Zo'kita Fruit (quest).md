==Objectives==
Collect 8 Freshly Picked Zo'kita Fruit.
*[[Freshly Picked Zo'kita]] (8)
*[[Zo'kita Safety Gear]] (provided)

==Description==
You need more Zo'kita Fruit than I'd ever dare to keep around here!

Just one Zo'kita fruit is enough to drive my brother out of the market, and you're asking for a whole basket?

Bold move, my friend!

Visit [[Eco-Dome: Primus|Eco-dome: Primus]], I secretly grow them there, hidden out of sight. Use my picking gear to locate them and take as many as you need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Basket of Zo'kita Fruit]]

==Progress==
Did you get enough?

==Completion==
So many Zo'kita Fruit! Quickly, throw them in a basket and leave before the smell sends our customers running for their lives!

==Notes==
Using the provided [[Zo'kita Safety Gear]] makes the quest objectives visible for 15 minutes. It is not consumed on use, so it can be reapplied in case of losing the buff.

When approaching [[Eco-Dome Preserver]]s after picking some of the fruit, they may say:
*{{text|say|Eco-Dome Preserver|<name>, please take those away!}}
*{{text|say|Eco-Dome Preserver|Oh no, not that smell again!}}
*{{text|say|Eco-Dome Preserver|Oh, that smell is rather unpleasant.}}
*{{text|say|Eco-Dome Preserver|Please <name>, Your smell is unbearable!}}
*{{text|say|Eco-Dome Preserver|I think the air purification is malfunctioning again!}}
*{{text|say|Eco-Dome Preserver|What is that smell?}}
*{{text|say|Eco-Dome Preserver|<name>, your scent is quite powerful in a bad way.}}

Upon returning with the fruit:
:{{text|say|Zo'kita|<name>, please take those away!}}
