'''What Is Left of Home''' begins the second chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]].

==Objectives==
Speak to citizens of [[Tazavesh]] and members of the [[K'aresh Trust|Trust]].
*Talk to the [[Ba'orr|Innkeeper]]
*Stay a while and listen to [[Xal'atath]] in the inn (Optional)
*Talk to the [[Om'sirik|Quartermaster]]
*Talk to the [[Om'thenai|Flight Master]]
*Stay a while and listen to [[Alleria]] at the docks

==Description==
[[Dimensius]] threatens us once more. There is no one who knows his methods better than his former Harbinger, Xal'atath. I would not say we can trust her, but we can work with her. She fears the All-Devouring's wrath after her betrayal.

We can't afford to turn away any potential ally. Think how many we will save from the [[void lord|Void Lord]]'s hunger. Get your bearings in this city the four of us saved together. I will convince Alleria.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
There will be a day when [[K'aresh]] is restored.

==Completion==
This is what we are fighting for, <name>. We can only save fragments of K'aresh, but we can prevent other worlds from sharing our dreadful fate.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I could never ally with that monster!}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Windrunner, Dimensius stirs. You must trust me. We have no better options.}}

[[Xal'atath]] has a {{gossip|quest=|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} with her gossip from before accepting the quest.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I cannot believe you would partner with her. She's trying to kill me!}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|We've all tried to kill each other.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Focus on the Void Lord who will devour us all if he emerges.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|You have every reason to hate her. For now we need to work together.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Dimensius was smashed into as many shards as [[K'aresh]], but you've allowed the [[Shadowguard]] to piece him back together.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I should just end her! Why are you protecting her Locus-Walker?}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|It pains me to admit, but if we are to get you and the [[adventurer|champion]] anywhere near Dimensius then we need her expertise.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|That means if you kill me, then you destroy [[Azeroth]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|That would be my next stop if I were a Void Lord.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|I am not asking you to trust her. I'm asking you to trust me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Set aside your hunt, Windrunner. You will see why this is necessary.}}

Outside, the phase has changed and several side quests open up: [[Applied Mixology]], [[Overwhelm Them]], and [[A Lucrative Opportunity]].

Travel north to [[Tazarest]] and speak with Ba'orr, at {{Co|41.13|25.12|Tazavesh||1}} behind the gate:
{{dialogue|class=plainlist|

And... done. Thank you for protecting the city. Because of you, we can continue the most important venture in Tazavesh: commerce.

{{gossip|Okay... I'd like to use your services.}}
}}

Head to [[Om'sirik]] and speak with him.
{{dialogue|Ah, the "hero of Tazavesh."

You saved our city, so I will give you some advice free of charge--just this once.

{{gossip|quest=|What awaits me out there in K'aresh?}}
K'aresh is a dangerous place, fleshling. The wasteland is no place for the faint of heart. It is no place for even my people, and we no longer have hearts!

The broken shards of our planet contain dangers in every corner. If you aren't careful, you will stumble into an ambush from deadly ethereals who have gone feral on our former home. Falling into their hands... that is a fate I would not wish on my worst business rival.

{{gossip|I'd like to talk about something else.}}
}}

Head to the docks, and speak with [[Om'thenai]], the flight master.
{{dialogue|Thank you for saving our city, <name>. We must keep Tazavesh alive, if we are to have the slimmest hope of restoring our world.

{{gossip|quest=|What waits for me out there?}}

Our world is a shattered husk. Brave K'areshi make the trip over to salvage what we can, but we all know that the problem we face is an impossible incline.

{{gossip|I'd like to talk about something else.}}
}}

Other characters have gossip at the docks:
{{Dialogue|title=Xal'atath|This place brings back memories. Some good, some less, but it matters what you do with them.

I thought Alleria would have tried to kill me by now, yet here she is. Perhaps her blind faith in her mentor Locus-Walker is stronger than I thought.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|I had known K'aresh had been destroyed, but it's something else to see it in front of me.

Dimensius must pay for this.

{{gossip|quest=|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|K'aresh was always harsh and unforgiving. Using our Reshii Ribbons, the oracles turned the [[Merciless Wastes]] into a garden.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|[[Reshii Wraps|Reshii Ribbons]]?}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Relics from old K'aresh that were used by the Ravel, as dangerous as they are powerful.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|So powerful that I betrayed the All-Devouring. I thought the ribbons would deliver me from his service.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|You were here before! Is this all your doing?}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I was merely the Harbinger to Dimensius. I did not destroy this world.}}
