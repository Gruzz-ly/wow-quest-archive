'''Swap Meet''' begins after [[mining]] a piece of [[Inscrutable Ore]] from any [[Desolate Deposit]] on [[K'aresh]]. It acts as a [[breadcrumb]] directing miners to [[Om'myuz]], who trades other ''War Within'' ores in exchange for [[Desolate Talus]].

This quest can only be turned in after completing the first chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]], since Om'myuz is not initially present.

==Objectives==
Bring your discovery to [[Om'myuz]] in [[Tazavesh]].
*[[Inscrutable Ore]] (provided)

==Description==
<The mysterious mineral thrums in your hand. Someone in Tazavesh will find a use for this. Look around the Veiled Market for an interested party.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Om'myuz takes a closer look at the ore.>

That is quite the intriguing rock you've found. I would like to inspect it further, and any others you find. What say you to a trade?

Other [[Cartel Om]] members in the Veiled Market may also be interested in trading wares, should you come across them.
