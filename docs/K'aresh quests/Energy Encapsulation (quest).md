==Objectives==
10{{sic}} Energy collected from Power Harvesters and Crackling Wyrms.
*[[Harvested Energy|Energy]] Collected (12)
*[[Crackling Wyrm]] slain (8)

==Description==
You need an Energy Encapsulation? You must be planning to activate a portal or teleporter with it!

I can construct what you require with ease, provided you supply the necessary energy.

Visit the Harvesters nearby. They let us collect what we need, as long as we help keep the wyrms off the harvesters.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Energy Encapsulation]]

==Progress==
Do you have the required energy?

==Completion==
A simple task, yet one I find most satisfying. After all, energy is the fundamental driver of all our work here.

==Notes==
Nearby is a relative term. The [[Power Harvester]]s and worms are in the [[Tempest Fields]]. The harvesters appear will grant 1 energy, but the worms have a chance to drop it as well. Might be worth just collecting a large group of worms and AoEing them down. That said, the drop rate is still relatively low from the worms.

==Progression==
{{A Key Threat}}
