==Objectives==
Search [[Shadow Point]] in [[Untethered Space]] with [[Xal'atath]]'s help.
* Talk to Xal'atath
* Conduit examined
* Conduit Monitor Station slain
* Manaforge entrance examined

==Description==
With [[Locus-Walker]]'s [[Reshii Ribbon]], I can transmute your flesh to energy. It won't hurt much.

You will have the ability to travel within [[Dimensius]]'s aura without being destroyed. There you can search for a path into the manaforge. You will travel in Untethered Space as a creature of energy, ignored by the [[Shadowguard]]. Their void beasts however... stay well away or be devoured. 

Talk to me when you are ready. Time is of the essence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We will need more than one Reshii Ribbon if we want to reach Dimensius with a force capable of stopping his emergence.

==Completion==
Through this, you have learned what I already knew.

[[Dimensius]] is a terrible threat. We must work together, <name>, if we are to survive.

==Notes==
New gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|How did we get to this? All that she has done to us, and she is our best ally?

<Alleria clenches her jaw as her gaze shifts to Locus-Walker.>}}

{{dialogue|title=Xal'atath|Even in his weakened state.

Dimensius's power is overwhelming.

We must work faster, together.

Xal'atath casts her spell and shifts players to the [[Untethered Space]] phase at the [[Shadow Point]].
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|You are now like the [[ethereal]]s and [[broker]]s were--an untethered soul composed of energy.}}

Players are debuffed with: {{abilities|Under Her Power|Xal'atath's spell courses through you...|icon=spell_arcane_prismaticcloak|id=1219699}}

[[Void Revealer]]s with a detection aura wander the area. If one spots the player:
:{{text|say|Void Revealer|I see you!}}
:''The player is sent back to Xal'atath, Locus-Walker, and Alleria at [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]].''
:{{text|say|Xal'atath|Beware the creatures of the Void who seek to devour your energy. They can smell you if you get close.}}

The conduit is located northwest of the starting spot at Shadow Point. Standing near it brings up an extra acton button:
:{{abilities|Examine|id=1214928|icon=inv_staff_2h_outdoorethereal_c_01|Xal'atath reaches through you to see the truth.}}

;Once the conduit is examined
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|This conduit connects to the garrison. We should check for entry closer to the [[Manaforge Omega|manaforge]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|These pipes aren't just carrying energy, but untethered souls too. The Shadowguard is manufacturing an army.}}

Head to the entrance of the Manaforge and examine it with the extra action button, dropping out of untethered space.
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|All pathways to the manaforge pass through the aura of Dimensius. Only a being composed of energy would survive. We will need more than Locus-Walker's ribbon.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|With only one ribbon, the transformation fades and you are beset by the power of Dimensius. Do not fret, my champion. I'll save you.}}
:''Xal'atath teleports the adventurer back to [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]].''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|You would never reach Dimensius without the Reshii Ribbons, and my help.}}
