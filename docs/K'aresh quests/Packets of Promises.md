'''Packets of Promises''' concludes the optional "Avoiding the Void" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Driruj]] at the [[Oasis]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Talk to [[Driruj]].
*Talk to Driruj outside [[Oasis|the eco-dome]]
*[[Satchel of Seeds]]

==Description==
I will not wait a moment longer. I have arranged for transport outside of the dome, and it will be arriving soon. 

Will you meet me outside? I have one last thing I would ask of you.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Iridescent Huskwrap]]
* [[Iridescent Huskjerkin]]
* [[Iridescent Husktunic]]
* [[Iridescent Huskplate]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|17|55|}}
* 9,150 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +350 reputation with [[K'aresh Trust]]

==Progress==
Driruj is a fool! He's likely to burn through his wrappings with his hot-headedness. He'll be back.

==Completion==
Well? Is he ready to apologize and get back to work?

<You hand him the satchel of seeds.>

What's this, now?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Driruj|Best to cut your losses and turn what's left into profit while you still can. I am leaving and you can't stop me!}}
:{{text|say|[[Om'gith]]|See how far you get once you're branded an oath-breaker, Driruj!}}
:''Driruj runs off.''

Follow him outside the east exit:
{{dialogue|Om'gith is welcome to waste his time here, but I will labor on this shredded planet no longer.

{{gossip|quest=|Are you leaving [[K'aresh]] now?}}

I am. I have wasted enough time on this [[void]]-blasted world. I would ask of you one last thing, <name>. Take this satchel to Om'gith. I was going to give it to him myself, but our words got between us and I let my anger take over.

I know that he thinks I am abandoning him and breaking our oath, but with this, I declare that the terms between us have been met.}}

The [[Satchel of Seeds]] on the crate next to him lights up. Pick it up:
:{{text|say|Driruj|Farewell! I will be making for a place where [[mage]]s will pay top prices for these--perhaps [[Shattrath City|Shattrath]] or [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]].}}
:{{text|say|Driruj|Hmmm... I have a longtime buyer in [[Dalaran]], but I haven't heard from him in awhile.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Om'gith|These seeds are all from plants that will thrive here. How did he - ... I see. This resolves the oath between us, as it certainly counts as furthering the betterment of K'aresh.}}
:{{text|say|Om'gith|So he's really gone, then. And won't be coming back. Then our last words to each other will have been those said in anger.}}
:{{text|say|Om'gith|Please... excuse me. I need to see about their germination immediately.}}
:''Om'gith walks off.''
