'''Chipping the Void''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Driruj]] at the [[Oasis]] to begin. This chapter awards 350 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and Explorer 1 chests.

==Objectives==
Collect 6 Void Glass Samples from the [[Clefts of Unreality]].
*[[Void Glass Sample]] (6)

==Description==
Greetings. I am [[Driruj]]. I think you could help with a project of mine. 

The nearby expanse of purple-hued crystal is ripe with potential. The void-infused glass could have many uses, from being a spell reagent to being melted down for crafts. I can't get near it myself, but someone like you will have no trouble at all!

Bring me back some samples of the [[void glass]] so I can assess their worth to future buyers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I am preparing to move off world before what's left of [[K'aresh]] crumbles away. There are many potential uses, and therefore potential markets, for this newly created void glass.

Potential equals profit, and profit means I can make a new life on a less volatile world.

==Completion==
Well? Let me see what you procured.

==Notes==
Before accepting the quest, Driruj has gossip:
{{dialogue|This eco-dome is a false promise of hope. K'aresh will never recover. 

Look to the sky! If that's even what you can call it. Behold our shattered planet.

{{gossip|Why do you want to leave K'aresh?}}

{{dialogue-child|
I have walked on these floating chunks of our once great world for tens of thousands of years. I have done my time here, and K'aresh's time will soon be over. 

I'm getting out of here before the rest of this withered rock is taken over by the Void.

{{gossip|I want to ask something else.}}}}

{{gossip|Why can't you do this yourself?}}

{{dialogue-child|
Have you seen what's out there? I'm good with technology and plants. Not void monsters.

{{gossip|I want to ask something else.}}}}
}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Driruj|Even this battered rock has potential for profit! There's a market for those crystals if I can get out of here.}}

Despite the objectives text, the [[Void Glass Sample]]s are southwest in the [[Tempest Fields]]. Gather six and return:
:{{text|say|Driruj|Ah, <name>! Have you brought my ticket out of here?}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Driruj|Let's see what we have here.}}
:{{text|say|Driruj|Bah! Too unstable. It fell to pieces already.}}

==Progression==
