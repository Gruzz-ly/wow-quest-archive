'''A Common Cause''' begins the optional "In Search of Darkness" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Magister Umbric]](!) at [[Shan'dorah]] on the southeastern shore of the northwestern island of [[K'aresh]] to begin. This chapter awards 500 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and Explorer 1 boots.

==Objectives==
Speak to Adarus.
*Ask [[Adarus Duskblaze|Adarus]] about [[Leona Darkstrider|Leona]]'s whereabouts
*Leona located at [[Fracture of Laacuna]]

==Description==
<Name>! I heard you were here on [[K'aresh]]. Good. I need help.

My apprentice Leona has been researching novel means of harnessing the power of the [[Void]]. She's approached a [[Demon hunter|Demon Hunter]] named Adarus to see if the [[Illidari]]'s methods could offer any insights.

To be honest, I'm not sure I trust Adarus. He's not... studious. Unlike Leona.

Leona was just going to observe him as he sought to master the Void. But she's disappeared. Please find her. Talk with Adarus--he knows something.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you spoken to Adarus yet, <name>? It's clear that the Illidari's apotheosis has stripped them of their manners.

==Completion==
Adarus sent you?

His lack of faith in my abilities and desire to delegate speak volumes.

==Notes==
Magister Umbric has additional gossip:

{{Dialogue|
What befell K'aresh is terrible. But there is much to learn here lest we too suffer the same fate.

Now have you come to learn of K'aresh, or to support the ren'dorei?

{{Gossip|Why don't you speak to Adarus yourself?}}

I have.

He's a remarkably unhelpful person, at least when there's nothing he stands to gain from it.

Perhaps you can convince him that it's in his best interest?
}}

Talk with Adarus, at the [[Training Dummy|training dummies]]:
{{Dialogue|
What, no bow?

Make it quick, <class>. I have no time, and more importantly, no interest, in idle conversation.

{{Gossip|quest=|Can you tell me where Umbric's apprentice went?}}

Fine, I'll tell you if it means an end to these interruptions.

The young void elf and I have entered into a pact. I teach her the ways of the illidari{{sic}}, and she conducts a ritual to infuse me with the powers of the void.

To that end, she's retrieving an item of power I require to realize my ambition.

If she yet lives, you can find her at the Fracture of Laacuna. If she's dead...

<Adarus shrugs>

Unfortunate, but then she's of no further use to me.
}}

If you do bow to him:
:{{Text|say|Adarus|Finally, someone who understands who they stand before. And from a <race>, no less!}}

Head north to find Leona Darkstrider at {{Co|59.34|24.19|K'aresh}} hidden among the rocks south of the [[Fracture of Laacuna]]:
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|You're not Adarus. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.}}
