==Objectives==
Obtain permission for [[Vaultkeeper Xy'vez]] in [[Tazavesh]].
* Pay for the permit (Optional)
* Teach [[Smuggler Ba'vaal|Ba'vaal]] a lesson (0/100)

==Description==
There is a difference between securing a permit and securing permission to sell in Tazavesh.

Xy'vez is a licensed dealer. He can buy and sell as he pleases in accordance with the authorities. However, I am glad he knows his place. If you are on my streets, you need my permission.

Not everyone knows this. [[Cartel Ba]] likes to test the waters. I'll award your permission if you teach them a lesson.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Have you done what I asked?

==Completion==
Very well. Xy'vez is free to buy and sell whatever he pleases on my streets.

==Notes==
Speak with Xy'eolm again:

{{dialogue|Under my leadership, Cartel Xy will always remain the most profitable of all cartels in Tazavesh.

{{gossip|quest=|<Offer 5 gold.>}}}}

Just around the corner to the northwest is [[Smuggler Ba'vaal]], who has been caught red handed and is engaged with some [[Cartel Zo Enforcer]]s:
:{{text|say|Smuggler Ba'vaal|You fools. Cartel Xy will fall by my hands!}}
:{{text|say|Smuggler Ba'vaal|Your demise has already been negotiated!}}

Damage him to fill the bar, or pay {{cost|5}} to Xy'eolm to skip the combat.
