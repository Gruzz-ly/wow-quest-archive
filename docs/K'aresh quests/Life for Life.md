'''Life for Life''' concludes the optional "A Stranger's Gift" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Om'taha]] just outside [[Naakroa]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Stop the machine.
*Unbind [[Om'taha]]
*[[Arcane Infuser]] destroyed (3)

==Description==
We're too late! The ritual is self-sustaining. It'll draw in more power until it overloads the machine. [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]], the [[eco-dome]]s--nothing will be safe if the failure cascades. 

If we remove the infusers, the energy should dissipate before it can cause any harm. It's too powerful though. It will tear you apart if you try to get close, and I'm not strong enough to do it alone...

Unbind me. I'll wrap you in my energy. That should be enough to let you get close to the machine.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Ritualbreaker's Band]]
* [[Seal of the Shattered Dome]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[K'aresh Trust]]

==Completion==
Are you alright? I tried to protect you from the blast.

<Om'taha flickers in and out of sight.>

Sorry. That took a lot. I just need a moment.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Om'taha|I'm ready. Unbind me.}}

Interact with her and players are buffed with:
:{{abilities|Reshii Cloak|Wrapped in Om'ataha's energy, protecting you from Arcane Radiation.|id=470879|icon=spell_animabastion_buff}}

Run into the energy shield and interact with the three Arcane Infusers:
:{{text|say|Om'taha|Argh! Hurry! I can't protect you for long.}}

After interacting with the third, the ritual gets disrupted and it knocks the player away. Om'taha pops out, unbound.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Om'taha|Om'musa, Om'baladh--we did it. We did it...}}
:''Om'taha fades away.''
