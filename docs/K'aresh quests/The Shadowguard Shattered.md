'''The Shadowguard Shattered''' concludes the first chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Chapter two, "Void Alliance", starts immediately after with [[What Is Left of Home]].
==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Shadowlord Al'zar.jpg|Shadowlord Al'zar|Leader of the Shadowguard attacking Tazavesh.}}
Kill Shadowlord Al'zar in [[Tazavesh]].
* [[Shadowlord Al'zar]] slain

==Description==
The commander of the [[Shadowguard]], Shadowlord Al'zar, has assaulted this shelter of [[K'aresh Trust|the Trust]]. I am preoccupied with assisting [[Injured Patron|these injured brokers]]. I dare not leave, or their [[soul]]'s energy will pour out.

I must depend on you, <name>. Venture forth and eliminate Shadowlord Al'zar. His demise will cripple the Shadowguard's assault on Tazavesh.

The fate of the city rests on your shoulders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,250 [[XP]]
*+2,500 [[reputation]] with [[K'aresh Trust]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Go. We will come as soon as we can.

==Completion==
Without their leader, the Shadowguard's assault on Tazavesh is crippled! For that, you have my gratitude.

<He pauses for a weighty moment.>

However, do not let this victory lull you into a false sense of security. There are darker forces at play--far more dangerous than the Shadowguard.

To resist them, we will need every advantage we can get... even those we would normally not consider.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|Locus-Walker and I will safeguard the injured. You handle the invasion commander!}}

Head to the chamber in [[Myza's Oasis]]:
:{{Text|Yell|Shadowlord Al'zar|We will feed this city to [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|the All-Devouring]]!}}

Aggro the Shadowlord:
:{{Text|Say|Shadowlord Al'zar|The Void conquers all!}}

Upon slaying him, Alleria and Locus-Walker show up.
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Good. The Commander's death should save the city... for the moment.}}

Upon completion, a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|Real-Time Cutscene]], "Locus-Walker's Unexpected Alliance" starts playing.
{{#ev:youtube|S7oRmYqdqQE|Locus-Walker's Unexpected Alliance}}
:''The cutscene opens Alleria walking up to [[Locus-Walker]] with the [[adventurer]] standing.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|The Shadowguard would have won if not for your ally's warning.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|It's time we were introduced.}}
:''Suddenly, a shadow portal opens offscreen next to Alleria and Locus-Walker as they turn towards a familiar face Who comes out of this? [[Xal'atath]]! Much to the player's surprise and Alleria's disgust.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|But Alleria, We've already met.}}
:''Alleria brings up her bow and starts aiming at Xal'atath.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|You.}}
:''Locus-Walker intervenes and presses her arm that was holding the bow down.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|No! We need her.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|I see you haven't changed at all.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|You have joined forces with her?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Have you lost your mind?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|We are desperate. If Dimensius is revived, then all worlds will be devoured.}}
:''Alleria hesitated for a bit until Xal'atath speaks out as she walk towards her.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|You [[A Light in the Dark|broke]] my [[Dark Heart]], Alleria. Without it, I cannot prevent Dimensius's return. At least, not on my own.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|This is madness. We cannot trust her!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|I'm not asking you to trust her. I'm asking you to trust me.}}
:''Alleria was stubborn as the cutscene cuts to black.''

On the other side of the cutscene, Alleria aims her arrow back at Xal'atath. The present characters have gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Xal'atath|
Why are you surprised to see me here, my champion? I can recognize raw power when I see it, and I have had my gaze on you for some time. I am pleased that we are in a position where we need each other. You won't get to Dimensius without me, and I cannot satiate my hatred of the [[Void Lord]] without you.

I will let you in on a little secret as well. I am in no shape to do this on my own. After all, you helped Alleria [[A Light in the Dark|foil]] my plans in [[Khaz Algar]]. I need allies to do this, as do you.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|
<Name>, this feels like a waking nightmare. I never thought I would be standing here with her, acting as allies.

Locus-Walker is putting us all at a great risk just talking to her. I am only here because I trust him. We have been through a lot together. It is the only reason that she still stands.

<Alleria sighs.>

If she tries anything, I will stop her.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Locus-Walker|
I know what you think, <name>. Please understand that even the worst enemies sometimes must work together to defeat an even greater evil.

I can't say that I like it, but there is no other way. If anyone knows how to defeat Dimensius and remove his threat from the world, it is her.

Please trust me, I... I know what is at stake.

{{Gossip|How did Dimensius return?}}

When [[K'aresh]] was destroyed, it scattered fragments of Dimensius across the [[Great Dark Beyond]]. Under the guise of vengeance, [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]] sought out untethered fragments of the Void Lord--only to collect them and reforge him in our dimension.

{{Gossip|I'd like to talk about something else.}}
}}

Completing the quest also awards the "A Shadowy Invitation" criterion of [[The Knife's Edge]].

==Trivia==
*In the teaser of Locus-Walker's Unexpected Ally, this cutscene opens much differently than in-game.
:''The cutscene opens with a Wide shot of [[Myza's Oasis]] where Alleria walks up to [[Locus-Walker]] with the [[adventurer]] standing.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Dimensius's power grows stronger every moment, Locus-Walker.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Your mysterious ally's information has proven quite valuable in this fight.}}

*During the PTR, Alleria's last sentence was:
{{Dialogue|
That, and the fact that her body is no longer physical. But if she tries anything, I will find a way.
