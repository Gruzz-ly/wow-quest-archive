==Objectives==
Stop the [[Shadowguard]] [[Ethereal]]s at [[Shadow Point: Darkmend]] in [[K'aresh]].
* Approach Xal'atath at [[Shadow Point: Darkmend]]
* [[Forgecaster Wraps]] (4)
* [[Unwieldy Energy]] disrupted (4)

==Description==
Very good, my champion. You are a swift and sharp blade of destruction.

We will put all that power to use now. We will slaughter the Shadowguard that seek to raise [[Dimensius]], and the machines created to feed his insatiable hunger.

The Shadowguard must have a [[Reshii Ribbon]] among their spoils. As we destroy their garrisons, look for this final ribbon. It is our way forward to kill a [[Void Lord]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A few more of these and we might even have a chance. Do not relent, <name>. You are capable of this and so much more.

==Completion==
Two more to go. Two more places for the ribbon to be hidden.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|With our new army, we will raze their garrisons until we take the Reshii for ourselves.}}
:''[[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Xal'atath]], [[Locus-Walker]], [[Soul-Scribe]], and [[Narathe]] take off.''

Head to [[Shadow Point: Darkmend]] to meet up with [[Xal'atath]]:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Take their wraps! No new Shadowguard will be bound today!}}

Slay the [[Shadowguard Forgecaster]]s and [[Imperator Taz'rin]] and loot their [[Forgecaster Wraps]]. Collect four:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Yes! Glorious! Now destroy the garrison's machinery. You are destruction itself.}}

Disable the four [[Unwieldy Energy|Unwieldy Energies]]:
:{{Text|Say|[[Dimensius]]|Soon...}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Hurry, my champion! We must push forward before the Void Lord awakens!}}

Meet up with the party on the west side of the building:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|Look what they are doing to my people! Their souls filled with the Void, oath-bound to the All-Devouring against their will.}}
