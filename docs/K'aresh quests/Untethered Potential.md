''' Untethered Potential''' begins the optional "Untethered Potential" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Researcher Essarae]] at [[Shan'dorah]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Collect 5 Phase-Altered essence in [[Untethered Space]].
*Use the Phase Conduit to enter Untethered Space
*[[Phase-Altered Essence]] (5)
*Use the [[Phase Conduit]] to return to K'aresh

==Description==
<Class>--I heard you have explored Untethered Space? That place is soaked with pristine [[void]] energy. I would like to explore it myself, but the last who have ventured into were consumed by the Void.

I need help with my research. There are Phase-Lost creatures in the [[Voidscar Cavern]] that I could use to examine their essence. If you could collect that for me, I would be grateful. 

Go carefully.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to collect the Phase-Altered essence?

==Completion==
This will provide a lot to forward my research on Untethered Space. I thank you.

I can't imagine what discoveries we can begin to unravel about [[K'aresh]].

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Researcher Essarae]]|Be careful. We don't know the true horrors that lurk in Untethered Space.}}

Use the [[Phase Conduit]] just to the east to start [[Phase Diving]]. Enter [[Voidscar Cavern]] at {{co|56.9|24.1|K'aresh}} (don't run or teleport to the [[Fracture of Lacuuna]]!) and start killing [[Phase-Lost Creeper]]s. The first one killed drops the [[Half-Digested Journal]], which starts [[Phase-Lost Adventurer]].

After collecting five [[Phase-Altered Essence]], return to Shan'dorah and use the extra action button at the Phase Conduit to exit untethered space. Don't just click off the buff, or the quest won't advance!

On return:
:{{text|say|Researcher Essarae|You're alive! I was beginning to worry that my research would be halted.}}
