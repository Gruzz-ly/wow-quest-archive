==Objectives==
Meet [[Xal'atath]] at the [[Oasis]] eco-dome.
*Report to [[Om'rajula]] at the Oasis.

==Description==
[[Soul-Scribe]] would fight for us, even die for our cause. Yet she still denies us her [[Reshii Ribbon]]. She sees it as a tool of the [[Ravel]], and her oaths are getting in the way of our mission.

If she could feel the presence of the [[Worldsoul]] [[K'aresh]] once again, she would give anything to protect him--even the ribbon. The Oasis is the [[K'aresh Trust|Trust]]'s eco-dome that has a stable biome. The perfect place to commune with a Worldsoul, if one still exists.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Valorstones]]
*{{cost|2|34|}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Our research here is essential to the future of K'aresh. That we have stabilized this area means that we can replicate this feat in other domes--perhaps even heal the shattered remains of K'aresh.

==Completion==
This is most irregular. [[Ve'nari]] may have asked that we extend all courtesy to the Harbinger and her champion. But these Wastelander barbarians?

I hope Ve'nari knows what she's doing.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|[[Soul-Scribe]]|Gather a raiding party, Narathe. We go to the Oasis to find communion... or plunder.}}

New gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Xal'atath|We are close to winning them over, <name>. Walking beneath the trees of K'aresh once more will open their eyes and remind them of their oaths.}}

Head east to the [[Oasis]] where [[Om'rajula]] is getting confronted by Soul-Scribe, [[Xal'atath]], [[Farena]], [[Lash'ir]], [[Jayaan]] and [[Narathe]]:
:{{Text|Say|Om'rajula|Absolutely not! The Wastelanders are thieves and murderers.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|If we had come to raid, your soul would already be untethered.}}

New gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Xal'atath|The Wastelanders have not truly walked on K'aresh for untold millennium. Bringing them here will remind them of who they are, and what they are fighting for.}}
{{dialogue|title=Om'rajula|The Wastelanders are thieves and murderers, but I remember what they were once. Even if they do not. Will you vouch for them?

{{plainlist|
*{{gossip|quest=|I will vouch for Soul-Scribe and her people.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|I won't vouch for them, but I will watch them carefully.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Stand aside before they stop being as civil as they are.}}
*{{gossip|Why aren't the Wastelanders allowed into the eco-domes?}}}}
{{dialogue-child|They are scavengers and thieves. They would strip the domes of their resources! They live for today, without planning for tomorrow.

The domes are our plans for the future of K'aresh, and we cannot allow them to plunder and destroy all our hard work.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}
}}

:{{Text|Say|Om'rajula|Fine. Report to [[Om'talad]]--please?}}
:{{Text|Say|Om'rajula|Just... The dome is delicate. Be careful what you touch, and step, or... float.}}
:''Soul-Scribe and the party walk into the Oasis.''
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|We will do as our oaths dictate, broker.}}

Go to the Oasis where Xal'atath and the Ethereals are talking to Om'talad.
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|These are the Oracles of the Untamed. You will let them commune with K'aresh in your dome, or they will sack it as Wastelanders.}}

New gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Xal'atath|The dome is stable for now, but we must hurry. I sense the void pressing against this reality more and more.}}
{{dialogue|title=Narathe|I have not seen so many green growing things in ages. I admit, I have peered in through the shields of this dome countless times, but nothing could prepare me for what is here.

My home, my world... Could it truly be restored? Perhaps the Tabiqa will be a first step toward healing.}}
{{dialogue|title=Lash'ir|We have been struggling to survive, but they are thriving here within the dome.

Is this sustainable? Could K'aresh really recover?}}
{{dialogue|title=Om'talad|Locus-Walker sent word ahead that you might be showing up here. Between his word and yours, I will trust that the Wastelanders are not here for plunder.}}

[[Jayaan]] is to the south of [[Om'talaad]] near a [[K'areshi Sentry]].

{{dialogue|title=Jayaan|I cannot believe we are doing the Tabiqa again. It's been eons since our last ritual.

We may not be able to hear K'aresh's voice anymore, but we can renew our vows to protect him.}}
