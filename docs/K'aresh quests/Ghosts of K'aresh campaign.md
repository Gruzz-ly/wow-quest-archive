[[File:Ghosts of K'aresh key art.jpg|thumb|Ghosts of K'aresh key art.]]
The '''Ghost of K'aresh campaign''' covers all quests added in [[patch 11.2.0]], mainly taking place in and around [[K'aresh]] as part of the greater [[The War Within campaign]].

==Campaign: The Knife's Edge==
[[File:VZ-K'aresh.jpg|thumb|[[K'aresh]] zone map]]

The five-chapter campaign is pushed to level {{level|tww-max}} players on login after the launch of the patch and starts in [[Foundation Hall]] of [[Dornogal]]. The first three chapters are available immediately, and chapter four is available in week two. The campaign is tracked in the achievement [[The Knife's Edge]], which awards the [[campsites|Warband campsite]] The Fate of the Devoured.

Once the first character in the warband completes the campaign through chapter four ([[That's a Wrap]]), gets their [[Reshii Wraps]], and completes the [[Phase Diving]] quests through [[The Untethered Horror]], alts can skip ahead to the same point by speaking with [[Om'en]] after landing in Tazavesh, then fly directly to [[Hashim]] at {{co|50.3|36.3|K'aresh}} to pick up their Reshii Wraps.
