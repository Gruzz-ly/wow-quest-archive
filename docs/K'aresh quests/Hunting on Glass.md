==Objectives==
Kill 4 Void Terrors and 8 Unreal Observers.
* [[Void Terror (K'aresh)|Void Terror]] slain (4)
* [[Unreal Observer]] slain (8)

==Description==
Violent scavengers of the [[Void]] have been drawn to [[Dimensius]]'s aura to feast upon the scraps he will leave behind. This presents a problem for our [[Wastelander]] friends. Scavenging is their job.

They could handle these beasts--I would not be seeking to ally with them if they couldn't. But why not give them a gift, and show them you are their equal--no, their superior in combat?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Dimensius's power grows and the Wastelanders are feeling the pinch. Let us ease the pressure for them a bit.

==Completion==
These Wastelanders respect strength and violence. I think we're going to get along quite well.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|To gain access to their camp, we must impress them with your combat prowess. We'll start with these void creatures.}}

Slay four [[Void Terror (K'aresh)|Void Terror]]s and eight [[Unreal Observer]]s that are in the Tempest Fields.

Once that is done, return to [[Xal'atath]]:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I sense void essence about you. It will make a perfect lure.}}

==Progression==
{{Desert Power}}
