==Objectives==
Collect 5 Saturated Entropic Cores from [[Shadowguard]] within [[Tazavesh]].
* [[Saturated Entropic Core]] (5)

==Description==
No, no, no! The Shadowguard are ransacking the city and our defenses are crumbling! We even invested in new security [[golem]]s after the city was [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market (instance)|last breached]], but we haven't had time to activate them.

Wait... I have an idea. The Shadowguard--some of them must have looted entropic cores that we can use to activate the golems.

Please, you must take them down and retrieve those cores. We need to get those golems online to protect our investments! Uh, I mean, our city!

==Rewards==
You will receive one from:
*[[Entropic-Shadow Greatsword]]
*[[Entropic-Shadow Handaxe]]
*[[Entropic-Shadow Gavel]]
*[[Entropic-Shadow Saber]]
*[[Entropic-Shadow Staff]]
*[[Entropic-Shadow Dagger]]
*[[Entropic-Shadow Javelin]]
*[[Entropic-Shadow Warglaive]]
*[[Entropic-Shadow Mace]]
*[[Entropic-Shadow Sharpshooter]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Got those cores that Om'en wanted?

==Completion==
These look like they're in good condition! Okay, let's go ahead and move on to the next phase of this plan.

==Notes==
Slay the [[Shadowguard Infiltrator]]s, [[Shadowguard Darkweaver]]s, [[Shadowguard Voidripper]]s, [[Shadowguard Duskwalker]]s, and [[Shadowguard Voidtamer]]s across Tazavesh and loot the Saturated Entropic Core.
