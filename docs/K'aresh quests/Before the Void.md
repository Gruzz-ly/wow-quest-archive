==Objectives==
Convince [[Soul-Scribe]] to join forces.
* Dagger returned
* Talk to [[Xal'atath]]
* [[Tabiqa Dagger]] (provided)

==Description==
You've impressed these [[Wastelanders]] with your violent prowess, my champion. Well done. Now let me do my work.

I know what these former oracles want. They dream of hearing the [[Song of K'aresh]] once more. I must make them believe it is possible, then pull on that string of desire. Soon we will have our army, and another Reshii Ribbon.

First, let's return the Tabiqa ritual dagger.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Wastelander's Worn Handwraps]]
*[[Wastelander's Worn Gloves]]
*[[Wastelander's Worn Grips]]
*[[Wastelander's Worn Gauntlets]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
We would gladly war against the Shadowguard. But I cannot give up this Reshii Ribbon to someone I don't trust.

Promises of revenge are easy. Trust is hard won among the Wastelanders.

==Notes and trivia==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I know what you yearn for, oracle.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|You are no longer oath-bound to a dead king. Join our fight against Dimensius and hear the Radiant Song once more.}}

Return the [[Tabiqa Dagger]] to the Soul-Scribe.
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|A gift for you. You misplaced this dagger in a broker. We return it, freely.}}

Speak with Xal'atath:
{{dialogue|The Wastelanders are so deliciously bloodthirsty. I admire how straightforward their tactics are.

We need a more delicate approach to winning them over, however. We need both the Reshii Ribbons they hold and the support of their warriors for the coming battle with Dimensius.

But first, let's move somewhere with less distractions.

{{gossip|quest=|Let's move to the upper camp.}}
}}
:''The Soul-Scribe and Xal'atath begin walking to the upper camp.''
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|My warriors are eager to untether the Shadowguard. But I think you want the ribbon I took from that Ravel broker.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Your warriors are a boon to our cause, and the Reshii Ribbon is vital to it.}}

Upon arrival, Xal'atath has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Xal'atath|The more Soul-Scribe protests that K'aresh is gone, the more I am convinced that communing with the Worldsoul once more is her heart's desire. I will use the promise of achieving what she thought impossible to ally her to our cause.<!-- Were you surprised to hear that Dimensius destroyed my own world as well? We are not as different as you might think.-->}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|Mother, allow them to prove themselves. If they succeed, we may have our revenge. If not, we kill them.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|Very well. Let's see what you are worth.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Soul-Scribe|Our ways may have changed from when we were oracles, but we have done what we must to stay alive.}}

During the PTR, Xal'atath's sentence was:
{{Dialogue|
Were you surprised to hear that Dimensius destroyed my own world as well? We are not as different as you might think.}}
