==Objectives==
Slay Soulbinder Sabeel and Duelist Xaheen.
*[[Soulbinder Sabeel]] slain
*[[Duelist Xaheen]] slain

==Description==
Before the [[Devouring]], the [[Sufaadi]] were [[priest]]s. There were customs of courtesy and charity. Those were erased with the rest of [[K'aresh]]. If the [[Wastelanders]] think I won't retaliate, they'll never stop targeting me.

I think you understand the value of a show of force. Kill their leaders--let it be a warning for the others.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80|}}
*15,250 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Hard to believe they were once priests.

==Completion==
Hopefully that will be enough to scare them off--at least for a while.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|So you'll help us?}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|If your friend can help me, then I'll do what I can.}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|I'm not one to break my word.}}

The two named targets are marked on the minimap alongside all the Stolen Supplies crates in [[North Sufaad]].

==Progression==
{{Of Boughs and Bonds}}
