'''Extended Reach''' begins the optional "Chasing Echoes" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] alongside [[Those We Have Lost]]. Find [[Om'dalan]] at the [[Ruins of Yaathron]] to begin. This chapter awards Explorer 1 necks and 350 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]].

==Objectives==
Gather readings from the Broker Pylons.
*[[Nether Reader|Nether reading]] documented (3)

==Description==
I'm very curious on why the influence of this restoration stopped where it did, as are my fellow colleagues. We set up some devices at the edge of the dunes to track the fluctuation in various energy types.

They have probably sat out there long enough for an initial reading. Could you go gather that info for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Hopefully the devices were easy to find?

==Completion==
Hmm... Nothing here seems out of the ordinary...

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|[[Om'dalan]]|Stranger! I could use your assistance if you have the time!}}

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Om'dalan|I will meet you near the back of these ruins when you are finished out in the wastes.}}

The three [[Nether Reader]] pylons are marked on the minimap, and kill [[Entropic Soul]]s and [[Hollow Reflection]]s in the area for their [[Flickering Essence]].

==Progression==
