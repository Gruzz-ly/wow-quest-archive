'''Meat my Business''' concludes third day of questing to acquire the [[Blue Barry]] mount. To begin, reach Renown 9 with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and find [[Ba'eth]] in [[Tazavesh]].

==Objectives==
Collect 12 Duskback Flank, 5 Siltwing Tails, and 5 Swooper Eggs.
*[[Dustback Flank]] (12)
*[[Siltwing Tail]] (5)
*[[Swoopwing Eggs]] (5)

==Description==
Since I am helping you, I'm sure you won't mind returning the favor.

I have a constant need for fresh, untainted meat, which is quite hard to come by. The [[Oasis]] is off limits, but the wildlife roaming these sands?

I've got a list of what I need. Bring me those items, and I'll tell you what you need to know.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You've collect{{sic}} all the meat?

==Completion==
Now as I promised.

I sold the blue [[slateback]] to an outsider like yourself. Not some great hero, but more of an awkward sort.

Come back tomorrow. He usually stops by here for a meal. And he doesn't merely smell it, he eats!

==Notes==
Head to the west island ([[Eco-Dome: Primus]]) and get to killing wildlife.
