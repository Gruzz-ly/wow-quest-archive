'''Stealing What is Ours''' begins the optional "Ba'eth's Request" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. This chapter is unlocked after reaching Renown 9 with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and rewards the [[Blue Barry]] mount after four days of questing. Find [[Ba'eth]] in [[Tazavesh]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Speak with Xy'dax and recover the Missing Imports.
*Speak to [[Xy'dax]] {{co|46.9|36.8|Tazavesh||1}}
*[[Xy'guts]] slain
*[[Missing Imports]] (10)
*Pack up [[Blue Barry]] and leave

==Description==
[[Ve'nari]] has called in a lot of favors to get the [[Oasis]] reclamation effort off the ground. Plenty of [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]] merchants have donated to the cause, though some have seen fit to help themselves instead.

A large shipment of stasis-sealed items was stolen from the docks by an untrustworthy importer. I could use someone of your skill to recover the shipment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered my missing items?

==Completion==
I wasn't expecting quite so much! Perhaps this is not all my imports? 

Still, it's good to see these items. I have a little something for your troubles.

==Notes==
Find [[Xy'daz]] to the north, not far from [[Blue Barry]]!

{{dialogue|Ba'eth sent you, didn't he?

I already told him, I have no idea what happened to his missing goods. I find his accusation of thievery deeply insulting!

{{plainlist|
*{{gossip|quest=|Please return the items.}}
:{{text|yell|Xy'dax|Xy'guts has exactly what you want!}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Are we going to have problems?}}
:{{text|say|Xy'dax|No problem with me, but Xy'guts has a problem with you!}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Mind if I look around?}}
:{{text|say|Xy'dax|Those are Xy'guts's crates. You really should ask him.}}
}}}}

No matter the option, Xy'guts attacks! Fend him off:
:{{text|say|Xy'dax|It's so hard to find good help, perhaps you would like a job?}}

Various [[Shadowtrade Imports]] light up in the area. Pick up ten:
:{{text|say|Xy'dax|Very well, tell Ba'eth all our accounts are settled, clean ledgers, no lingering debts}}.
:{{text|say|Xy'dax|Please, take those creatures also, they would not stay in the containers}}.

Interact with Blue Barry to leash it, then run back on foot to Ba'eth.

Before leaving:
{{dialogue|title=Xy'dax|I am quite tired of your presence.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ba'eth|Stop by tomorrow, and I will have these items all sorted out by then.}}

==Progression==
