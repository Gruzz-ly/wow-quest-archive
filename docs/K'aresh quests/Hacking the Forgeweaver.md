'''Hacking the Mainframe''' becomes available after reaching Renown 7 with [[Manaforge Vandals]].

==Objectives==
Report to [[Zo'ropo]] at [[Shadow Point]].

==Description==
We've progressed further in our infiltration of the [[Manaforge Omega|Manaforge]]'s defenses. Return to HQ and I'll clear you for access.

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{Abilities|Trash Hacking II|id=1243366|Extends Arcane Flow Control access to Technomancer's Terrace near Forgeweaver Araz, allowing you to significantly weaken non-boss enemies nearby.|icon=ability_racial_etherealconnection}}

==Completion==
We found a weakness in [[Forgeweaver Araz]]'s engineering bay that should allow you access to another console nearby. Keep up the pressure, and we'll let you know once the whole facility is ours. Happy hunting.
