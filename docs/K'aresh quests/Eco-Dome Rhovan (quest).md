'''Eco-Dome: Rhovan''' begins the third chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Locus-Walker]] at [[Eco-Dome: Rhovan]].

==Description==
I will not make excuses for what we did. I carry the responsibility of it for the rest of my existence. [[Alleria]] will come to understand why it was necessary. When she sees power of [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|the All-Devouring]], she will understand.

We will need at least two more [[Reshii Ribbon]]s to bring enough of a force to bear against Dimensius. My friend [[Om'bera]] is a holder of a ribbon. She works in Eco-Dome: Rhovan on the next island. Let us gather her to our cause.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The dome is shattered and Om'bera may be in danger! I can see the scavengers from the wastelands of K'aresh within it now.

Om'bera may yet live. We must find her. and her Reshil Ribbon.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|We will need another ribbon. The Dome Administrator [[Om'bera]] was in the [[Ravel]]. We should seek her out.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|She sounds trusting. Eager to give up power when asked.}}
:''Locus-Walker walks out and [[Xal'atath]] teleports away.''

Upon arriving at [[Eco-Dome: Rhovan]]:
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|What has happened here? Where is Om'bera?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Om'resh]]|A meteor destroyed the dome. We fled together, but Om'bera is missing!}}

New gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Xal'atath|Can you feel the void energy? The longer it takes us to defeat [[Dimensius]]. the more shredded the barrier between this world and the void will become.

His power grows, and this is but a small example of what will crash down upon K'aresh.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Om'resh|So much destruction. We had hoped to salvage some of our work. Could it all be lost?

{{gossip|What happened to the eco-dome?}}

The instability between K'aresh and the void is growing. We were working in the eco-dome when a huge rift tore the sky open. The meteor came crashing down, barely missing us.

We rushed to rescue what we could, and brought the animals and plants that survived to the Oasis.}}
