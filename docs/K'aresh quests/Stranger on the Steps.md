'''Stranger on the Steps''' begins the optional "A Stranger's Gift" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Om'taha]] outside [[Naakroa]] on the western island to begin. This chapter awards 350 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and Explorer 1 rings.

==Objectives==
Find Om'baladh.
*[[Om'baladh]] found

==Description==
Please! We have to stop the [[Naakroan]]s. Three of us were sent by [[cartel Om]] to install a research machine. It was only meant to help study extinct plants. At first, the [[Wastelanders]] were polite, even curious--until we tried to leave. 

They forced us to modify the machine. [[Om'musa]] refused and they killed him. Om'baladh and I obeyed. We should have refused as well.

Once we finished, the Wastelanders let their guards down. Om'baladh said to run, so I did. He was right behind me. Please--find him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Oh, my friends. What have we done?

==Completion==
I heard him fall. I should have stopped for him. Instead, I kept running.

We have to make this right. We turned the machine into a weapon for the Wastelanders. It won't help rejuvenate the land--it will kill everything.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Om'taha|Did I lose them? Are they still chasing me?}}

She has gossip:
{{dialogue|
I've never seen anything like this. These Wastelanders--they aren't just survivors. They're predators. In captivity, I heard their leader's sermons. [[Xal'atath]] came to them before the [[Devouring]]. She taught them to steal the Reshii from the land, the beasts, even their own kin. 

They think she saved them. They've been waiting to serve her again... and I gave them the tools to do it.

{{gossip|<Ask about the machine she installed in the ruins.>}}

It's an echo machine. It was only meant to detect and project the essence of long-dead flora so we could study extinct species. Now, after the modifications we made, it's a weapon.

If they overload it with energy, the backlash will propagate to all of our installations across K'aresh. The eco-domes will fail. Everything will die.

And it's my fault.

Please, <name>, this is still home. There's so much beauty under the scars. We can't lose it again.

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}}}

Head into town to find Om'baladh's corpse on the steps, and listen in on the conversation:
:{{text|say|Issam the Unraveler|I knew she had not abandoned us. After millennia, the great Harbinger of K'aresh has returned!}}
:{{text|say|Issam the Unraveler|I sense her. She who gifted us the Devouring. She who taught our hearts to hunger.}}
:{{text|say|Issam the Unraveler|With the brokers' machine, we'll show our devotion with a new Devouring.}}
:{{text|yell|Issam the Unraveler|Celebrate the feast! Venerate the famine!}}
