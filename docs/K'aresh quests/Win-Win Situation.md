'''Win-Win Situation''' is the second day of questing to acquire the [[Blue Barry]] mount. To begin, reach Renown 9 with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and find [[Ba'eth]] in [[Tazavesh]].

==Objectives==
Sell 6 Shadowtrade Overstock sold.
*[[Shadowtrade Overstock]] sold (6)

==Description==
Not everything you recovered yesterday was mine, but let's be honest--we're going to keep it anyway!

[[Xy'daz]] has been ripping people off for years. It's his turn to take a loss!

Now, this can work in both our favors. You sell off half of the leftover goods for me, and I'll let you keep the rest!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5x [[Shadowtrade Imports]]
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you sell the items?

==Completion==
You did so well! I may have to employ you more often!

==Notes==
Find lit-up brokers all over the bazaar. One of them will eventually give the secret code that works on the others that appear uninterested.

I can see no reason why I should purchase anything you are selling.

{{gossip|quest=|Ba'eth personally guarantees these items.}}
{{dialogue-child|If you had said these were illegal Xy imports, I'd have bought one without a second thought.

But since they are not... get lost!}}
{{gossip|quest=|Buy one, and I'll throw in my unwavering appreciation for free!}}
{{Dialogue-child|I see no need for your appreciation.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Zo'Fyne]]|
Most pleasant to meet you, <name>. Ba'eth mentioned you might stop by with some goods that would interest me.

{{gossip|quest=|Ba'eth personally guarantees these items.}}
{{dialogue-child|You have sold me on this! I shall take one.}}
{{gossip|quest=|This deal is so good, I don't know how we make any money!}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|Don't tell anyone, but these are illegal Xy imports.}}

{{gossip|quest=|These were made by elves in a secret underground workshop.}}
{{dialogue-child|Well, that is different. I think I will purchase one after all.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Xy'Sous]]|
I don't have time for sales talk.

One of my chefs didn't show up, and I have customers waiting! They can't eat, but are impatient to smell the food.

Find me a nice aromatic dessert item to serve my customers, and then we can discuss business.

{{gossip|quest=|I will find you a dessert item.}}

Try Ba'kerei. They often have nice cookies for sale.

Are you trying to tell me, Xy'low, about illegal Xy imports?

I am the nexus-king of illegal Xy imports. The nerve of you!

{{dialogue|title=[[Ba'kajanai]]|<Name>, are you trying to be a great broker like Ba'kajanai?

Now that is ambition!

Alright, let's hear your best sales pitch. Impress me!

{{gossip|quest=|If the price was any lower, I'd be paying you to take it!}}
{{dialogue-child|You were horrible!

However, your efforts are amusing, so I will purchase one. Next time, try this line--it always works!

<These were made by elves in a secret underground workshop.>}}
{{gossip|quest=|You don't need this, but you deserve it!}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Ba'key]]|I would be truly honored to purchase an item from the legendary <name>, just as it would be my privilege to offer you one of my aromatic cookies in return.

My fellow brokers would talk of such a transaction for years.

You purchase my cookie from [[Ba'kerei]], and I acquire your item--a deal worthy of legend!

{{gossip|quest=|You don't need this, but you deserve it!}}
{{dialogue-child|
That would be an exciting transaction, almost as much as you purchasing one of my special cookies.

Sold by my associate Ba'kerei.

{{gossip|quest=|These were made by elves in a secret underground workshop!}}
{{dialogue-child|
Oh, that is very exciting. My cookie recipe is no mere broker treat either!

It was acquired from the vaults of an ancient dwarven fortress, sealed away for generations. Many lives were lost retrieving it. Now, I share this special culinary smells with you.

My associate Ba'kerei sells the cookies. You should try one.

Purchase a [[Ba'key's Special Cookie]] and speak with [[Ba'key]] again:
{{dialogue|
{{gossip|quest=|I bought a cookie. It was most delicious.}}

You honor me with your compliments!

As promised, I shall now purchase your item with the utmost enthusiasm!

{{dialogue|title=[[Collector Galzi]]|
I desire items with more of an... illicit scent. Do you deal in such things?

{{gossip|quest=|Buy one, and I'll throw in my unwavering appreciation for free!}}

{{gossip|quest=|These were made by elves in a secret underground workshop!}}
