'''Somebody Like Me''' is made available by [[Zo'turu]] at [[Shadow Point]] in [[K'aresh]] just outside [[Manaforge Omega]] after finding the three Dead Drops in the raid. To see the dead drops, players must be at least Renown 8 with the [[Manaforge Vandals]] and buffed by [[Deal: Cartel Ba]], [[Deal: Cartel Om]], and [[Deal: Cartel Zo]]. See [[Xy Trustee's Gearglider]] for more information and a walkthrough.

==Completion==
Hero... far be it from me to question your methods in taking down [[Dimensius|the All-Devouring]], but I've noticed your snooping while inside Omega. Those cyphers you discovered are how we communicate with our contacts inside. I don't even know how you activated them - they were supposed to be heavily encrypted! Still... this is the kind of mischief I love to encourage. I'm not sure what use you'll get out of this disguise, but for all you've done for us, you've earned a treat. Just don't say you got it from me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Cartel Transmorpher]]
* [[Xy Trustee's Gearglider]]

==Patch changes==
