==Objectives==
Help the [[Broker]]s of [[Tazavesh]] by assisting with their issues.
*[[Xy'bin]] assisted
*[[Ba'ver]] assisted
*[[Ta'ka]] assisted
*Stay awhile and listen to Locus-Walker at the portal (Optional)

==Description==
[[Locus-Walker]] was brought into the [[K'aresh Trust|Trust]] to handle such a violent crisis of the [[Void]]. He says you are some kind of hero or champion. Good. We are in need of such a thing.

Tazavesh is under threat from the Void. The [[Shadowguard]]! They threaten the work of the Trust and my reputation as an administrator.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
How goes the various projects of the Trust?

==Completion==
All the problems are solved. At least, all the problems that were on my ledger that I was responsible for.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Om'en]]|This managerial job in Tazavesh has been one crisis after another. I delegate solving these problems to you.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|[[Xal'atath]] is out there, and we do chores?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Locus-Walker]]|We must pay the bureaucratic tax if we want free run of the city.}}

Locus-Walker has a new {{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} option.
The option to view the previous cinematic is still available under: {{gossip|Play Movie=|<Show me your vision of the Dark Heart.>}}
:{{Text|say|Om'en|Will more flesh creatures from off-world be arriving to aid the Trust?}}
:{{Text|say|Om'en|Never mind. I'll find the appropriate forms. Best to plan for chaos, or worse, the [[Maw Walker]] to return.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Who are the Trust?}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|They are a coalition of [[cartel]]s. [[Cartel Ba|Ba]], [[Cartel Xy|Xy]], [[Cartel Zo|Zo]], and [[Cartel Om|Om]], as well as [[ethereal]]s from the [[Consortium]].}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|Tazavesh was acquired by the Trust's founder to act as a supply port and recreation center for the revitalized [[Project Eco-Dome]].}}
:{{Text|say|Om'en|Our [[eco-dome]]s are threatened by both the Shadowguard and the barbarian [[Wastelanders]]. It is more than cartel Zo security can manage.}}
:{{Text|say|Om'en|The founder believes that the sinister [[Ravel]] [[sorcerer]] Locus-Walker can solve this crisis.}}
:{{Text|say|Om'en|I am skeptical. The only progress I have noticed is the increase of paperwork on my desk.}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|My student, Alleria Windrunner, and [[Azeroth]]'s [[Champion (rank)|champion]] <name> have my full support. I have the founder's. I suggest you give them yours.}}
:{{Text|say|Om'en|Very well, I have approved your entry. You have complete access to the city. No need to sneak in or cause trouble.}}

Head north to {{co|59.5|83.2|Tazavesh||1}} inside the hall to find Xy'bin and Ta'ka, who offer [[Compromised Containment]] and [[Beasts Unbound]].
:{{Text|say|Xy'bin|I need help! Arcane manifestations are out of control!}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'ka|This must be the new specialist. Help me first!}}

Proceed further north to {{Co|53.1|64.5|Tazavesh|1}} and accept [[Lost Lines of Defense]] from [[Ba'ver]]. Complete all three quests to satisfy the criteria of this quest.

If the objectives do not show as complete despite turning in the quests, relog.

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|These aren't accidents--this is sabotage. The Shadowguard are already in Tazavesh!}}

==Progression==
{{A Shadowy Invitation}}
