==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Respleth the Hungerer.jpg|Respleth the Hungerer|This devourer gorger is part of a valuable contract for Xy Imports, but with the delay, its valuable anima core sits waiting.}}
Collect Overflowing Anima Core from [[Respleth the Hungerer]] outside [[Tazavesh]].
* [[Overflowing Anima Core]] {{co|23.2|37.2|Tazavesh||1}}

==Description==
We've made good progress, but we need more disorganization.

I've redirected a particularly large shipment of [[anima]] in the form of a [[devourer]]. Kill it and bring its anima core to me.

The anima itself is not important--rather, the fact that it can be stolen. My boss will have more to answer for in the audit when his books are in disarray.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The Xy Imports associates transporting this anima are expecting a--ah--broker of sorts to relieve them of their charge.

They will give you no trouble.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

<Xy'nell slips the anima core into a messenger bag.>

More incriminating evidence for the audit.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests:
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|This is only temporary. Temporary. With some rest, my coworkers will be ready to tackle the backlog of work with new vigor.}}
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|And there will be no more Coordinator Xy'thir bearing down on them.}}
:{{text|emote|Associate Xy'nell shifts uncomfortably.}}

Respleth is "offshore" of Tazavesh to the northwest, where it's being tended to by [[Associate Xy'miv]] and [[Associate Xy'vol]]. Aggro it:
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'hrin|Are you the courier the coordinator spoke of?}}
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'vol|Courier? Coordinator Xy'thir is making oaths with mortals now?}}
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'vol|This is highly unusual...}}
