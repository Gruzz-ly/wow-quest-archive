==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Shadow-Captain Lakheesh.png|Shadow-Captain Lakheesh|Shadow-Captain Lakheesh is a powerful ethereal that shouldn't be underestimated.}}
Kill Shadow-Captain Lakheesh.
* [[Shadow-Captain Lakheesh]] slain {{co|54.5|46.7|K'aresh}}

==Description==
I need to focus on the mission. Regardless of my doubts about our companions, the [[Shadowguard]] are a scourge. We should slay their Shadow-Captain so they cannot easily return to [[Eco-Dome: Primus]]. [[Ve'nari]] would lend her [[Reshii Ribbon]] to our cause, and we would discover if my trust in [[Locus-Walker]] was well placed.

I will not let my doubts stay my bow on the battlefield, <name>. You can trust me to hunt these followers of [[Dimensius]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* [[Void-Touched Fragment]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
With that necessary violence taken care of, the three of us can talk. You are correct. Alleria. Great secrets have been kept from you. Secrets that were not mine to reveal but should have been revealed to you years ago.

==Notes==
Confront Shadow-Captain Lakheesh at the north end of camp:
:{{Text|Say|Shadow-Captain Lakheesh|You won't live to see [[Dimensius]] rise!}}

After slaying him:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Come find me and I will reveal the truth. No more secrets.}}

==Progression==
