==Objectives==
Return to [[Vaultkeeper Xy'vez]] in the market of [[Tazavesh]] on [[K'aresh]].
* [[Aftermarket Ledger]] (Provided)

==Description==
Take this ledger to Xy'vez. Let him know I expect dinars upfront and on time. There are to be no discrepencies{{sic}} between my records and his, do you understand?

You may head to the market to inform him. Knowing traders like him, he'll have already found a spot to set up shop.

This venture has my blessing. Don't let it become unprofitable or we'll be seeing each other again, offworlder.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do we have good news, offworlder?

==Completion==
The boss wants a high price, but it is a fair ask of a new venture. We will succeed quickly or we will fail quickly.

Let's get to work.
