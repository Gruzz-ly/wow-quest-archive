==Objectives==
Gather materials for the ritual.
* [[Zaranit Bud]] (6)
* [[Heartspring Water]]

==Description==
The Tabiqa has not been attempted for thousands of years. It was clear that the [[Devouring War]] destroyed [[K'aresh]].

And yet, looking at this dome... they have recreated so much that I thought lost forever--fresh water, clean air, even the zaranit flowers I thought extinct. Does [[Xal'atath|the Harbinger]] speak the truth?

No. I didn't break my oath and abandon the [[Worldsoul]]. K'aresh is gone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|17|55|}}
*9,150 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Did you find the components for the Tabiqa ritual? Do they even still exist?

==Completion==
To hold these blossoms in my hands again... I never thought I would see the day.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|I've heard the Song of K'aresh before. These plants... All this beauty of nature--a pale shadow of K'aresh that was.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|If you think to trick me, I will use my Reshii Ribbon to destroy you.}}

Pick up [[Restoring Hope]] before heading out. While in the area, [[Driruj]] starts [[Chipping the Void]].

Across the [[Oasis]], collect the [[Zaranit Bud]]s and a [[Heartspring Water]] from the [[Rippling Wellspring]].

==Progression==
{{Desert Power}}
