==Objectives==
Find enough lost items in [[North Sufaad]] to fill Om'sto's pack.
*Fill Vesto's pack with items.

==Description==
An upstanding citizen such as [[Om'sto]], would not have such an illegal item like a Smuggler's Mark.

If I did acquire one...I would be inclined to give it to someone that I owe a debt to.

If you did me a favor, and then I would be in your debt.

Travel to North Sufaad, and fill my pack with items I lost there. You do this, and I may have what you need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Smuggler's Mark]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered all my items?

==Completion==
As I promised I will settle this debt with the mark you require. When placed on an item the mark indicates to others that the transaction is approved by cartel officials.

==Notes==
The items are found in North Sufaad and appear as both items on the ground as well as dropping from ethereals.

Items include:
*[[Missing Voidband]]
*[[Hidden Tokens]]
*[[Stolen Apparel]]
*[[Shadowed Scrolls]]
*[[Misplaced Shipment]]

==Progression==
