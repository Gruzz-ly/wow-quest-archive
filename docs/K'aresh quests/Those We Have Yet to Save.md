'''Those We Have Yet to Save''' concludes the optional "Chasing Echoes" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Om'dalan]] at the [[Ruins of Yaathron]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Recharge 6 Flickering Ephemera.
*[[Flickering Ephemera]] tested (6)
*[[Nether Tuner]] (provided)

==Description==
The fauna here seem to be the same in shape as what would have been found nearby when [[K'aresh]] was still intact, but they are acting rather oddly for their species.

I wonder if we could give them one last push and fully bring them into being. Take the last of the energy. I have a device that should let you channel it into them.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Amulet of Final Charge]]
* [[Echo Pendant of K'aresh]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[K'aresh Trust]]

==Progress==
Have you finished our experiment?

==Completion==
They... dissipated? No, no, no. That can't be!

Surely something in my calculations is wrong! We probably just disrupted them instead of helping them!

==Notes and trivia==
Use the provided [[Nether Tuner]] on the [[Flickering Ephemera]] in the area. They will either turn into fleshbeasts and attack or shift between other wildlife and die!

On complete:
:{{text|say|Om'dalan|But this... No! This response means these were never spirits to begin with!}}
:{{text|say|Om'dalan|There isn't anything to save, just lingering whispers of what once was.}}
:{{text|say|Om'dalan|I need to think this over. It was not what I was hoping for, but thank you for your help.}}

This quest, as well as the first quest in the series, is a reference to the phrase "For those we have lost. For those we can yet save." from ''{{wp|Final Fantasy XIV}}''.
