==Objectives==
Return 5 stolen research crates to [[Om'resh]].
* [[Stolen Research Crate]] (5)
* [[Stolen Research Crates|Stolen Crates]] returned
* Talk to [[Locus-Walker]]
* Talk to [[Xal'atath]]

==Description==
The loss of an [[eco-dome]] is unimaginable. The death of [[Om'bera]]...

<The broker's shoulders rise and fall in what looks like a sigh, though no breath is heard.>

I cannot leave without retrieving the research crates! Her work must live on, even if she cannot. Om'bera's manifest says that there were at least five crates full of research and resources.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Encroaching Void Vestment]]
*[[Encroaching Void Vest]]
*[[Encroaching Void Chainmail]]
*[[Encroaching Void Breastplate]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* 10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I don't understand the Wastelanders. I thought they were once oracles of Untamed K'aresh. Nature worshipers. Why do they steal from our domes and prevent the Trust's mission?

==Completion==
Thank you for retrieving the crates. Om'bera's research will help us find a stable biome in time.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Om'resh|This project meant everything to [[Om'bera]]. What took years to build was destroyed so quickly.}}
:''[[Xal'atath]] teleports away as Om'resh and [[Locus-Walker]] walk off.''
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Come, let us retrieve her research and ensure her efforts were not in vain.}}

Find five [[Stolen Research Crate]]s all over the area, then head to Om'resh, Xal'atath, and Locus-Walker just outside the dome. Place the crates and three Wastelander Assassins port in:
:{{text|say|Xal'atath|Looks like we're about to have company again.}}
:{{text|say|Wastelander Assassin|Ravel traitor! Your Reshii Ribbon will be ours, Locus-Walker!}}

Fend them off, then speak with Locus-Walker:
{{Dialogue|We did not make it far before we were attacked by Wastelanders. They are very determined.

{{gossip|quest=|It's not safe here.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Agreed. The Wastelanders may return. Let's move to a safer location.}}
:{{Text|Say|Om'resh|The founder gave me a Portation Tag to safeguard her investments in an emergency.}}

Follow Om'resh and Locus-Walker to near the once-entrance of the [[Eco-Dome Rhovan]].

New gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Xal'atath|The oracles, now known as the Wastelanders, have turned their viciousness against the Ravel. And now they're using their Tabiqa ritual daggers for murder.

Lapsed pacifists are always the most vicious fighters, don't you think?

{{gossip|Why do the Wastelanders want to kill Locus-Walker?}}
{{dialogue-child|Locus-Walker struggled to keep his secrets and still ended up hated and feared by the K'areshi. These oracles abandoned their ceremonial daggers and picked up assassination knives. Nexus-King Salhadaar betrayed the Ravel. The Ravel used their Reshii Ribbons too early, and Dimensius was dispersed instead of destroyed.

Perhaps this is my fault? I should have placed placed all the factions on K'aresh under my heel from the start. Or perhaps there was nothing that could have been done? Life is chaos. Even if one controls vast cosmic power, there are still events out of your control.

No use crying over shattered worlds is there?

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}
{{gossip|What is the Tabiqa ritual?}}
{{dialogue-child|The Tabiqa was the clumsy ritual the oracles once used to commune with their Worldsoul. K'aresh. It was central to their identity as a people, as the ritual was when they would gather as a community and worship.

The dagger used to be for harvesting their sacred plants. Now it's apparently for burying in the chests of Ravel members.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Locus-Walker|The Wastelanders have started murdering members of the Ravel and stealing their Reshii Ribbons. This is very disturbing.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|These Wastelanders are still holding a grudge against you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Leave us. Keep your Reshii Ribbon safe. My champion and I will turn these murderous fanatics to our cause.}}

More gossip after completion:
{{dialogue|title=Locus-Walker|I will bring Om'bera back to the city. I do not like leaving you alone in this task, but Xal'atath is correct. The Wastelanders will not deal with you if I am present.}}
{{dialogue|title=Om'resh|I can't believe Om'bera is gone. I will carry on her work, but it will be all the more challenging without her. 

She was my mentor and... my friend.}}
