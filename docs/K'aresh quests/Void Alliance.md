==Objectives==
Place 4 [[Xal'atath]] defenses around [[Eco-Dome: Primus]].
*[[Defense Matrix Crystal|Defense Matrices]] placed (4)

==Description==
We can't have you patrolling the perimeter of this dome, like the city watch fighting attackers in perpetuity. We need a permanent solution so we can continue with our noble quest.

Take these crystals. They've been attuned with the eco-dome's defense magics. Just place them near strategic parts of the perimeter to strengthen the magical defenses.

What? This time it's no trick. If this dome explodes, I'll never get to destroy Dimensius.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Have you placed the crystals I gave you? [[Ve'nari]] won't give up her ribbon until her dome is secure.

==Completion==
That should secure this dome. But will Ve'nari make us float through any more hoops?

==Notes==
Accept both Void Alliance & [[This Is Our Dome!]].

Place each ward in turn, starting clockwise from the east:
#{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Some time alone to get things done. I adore watching you work.}}
#{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] has been quiet. I think she's still angry at me about [[Dalaran]].}}
#{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|There aren't many who Alleria trusts, aside from Locus-Walker. A foolish exception to a wise rule.}}
#{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|First, let's destroy [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|the All-Devouring]]. Then we see what becomes of our partnership.}}

Return to [[Xal'atath]] & [[Ve'nari]] to turn in both quests.

[[Xal'atath]]'s "This time it's no trick" line is a reference to [[Strengthen the Wards]] during the {{g|tww}} introduction, where Xal'atath, while disguised as [[Archmage Drenden]], had the hapless adventurer plant devices that sabotaged [[Dalaran]]'s defenses rather than strengthen them.
