'''Bridge to Nowhere''' begins the optional "Of Boughs and Bonds" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] alongside [[Clearing the Dunes]]. Find [[Om'fennad]] at [[Hosaas' Rest]] on the south shore of the western island of [[K'aresh]] to begin. This chapter rewards Explorer 1 belts and +500 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]].

==Objectives==
Use the Echo Surveyor to help [[Om'fennad]] find his way.
* First site surveyed {{co|52.0|62.3|K'aresh}}
* Second site surveyed {{co|54.3|53.6|K'aresh}}
* Third site surveyed {{co|58.7|55.2|K'aresh}}
* [[Echo Surveyor]] (provided)

==Description==
Are you heading to the dunes? I'm looking for my sister, [[Shahata]]. I don't know if she's alive, but I have to find her.

The only place I can think to start the search is our village. [[K'aresh]] is nothing like I remember. I need landmarks--anything I can recognize to navigate by.

Take this echo surveyor. It will reveal traces of the past--hopefully enough for me to orient us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
It's all so different from what I remember.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I think I have my bearings now. You see how much life used to be here? It's hard to imagine Shahata surviving here for so long... No. We'll find her. We have to.

==Notes and trivia==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|Oh dear! This is far worse than I expected.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|The device will reveal echoes. They're not spirits, just traces of the past.}}

Head to the marked location on the minimap, stand in the blue circle, then use the extra action button: {{abilities|Survey|Use Om'fennad's Echo Surveyor to view echoes of K'aresh's past.|id=464597}}

#{{text|say|Om'fennad|The old trade road? You used to see caravans stretching to the horizon. Shahata and I would always wait by the road to catch stories from traders.}}
#{{text|say|Om'fennad|This was a wayshrine to the Untamed. Our mother would bring us here in the morning on festival days. Even the gods didn't survive the Devouring.}}
#{{text|say|Om'fennad|There used to be so much life here. After a rainstorm, the whole desert would bloom. Someday, we'll fix this.}}
