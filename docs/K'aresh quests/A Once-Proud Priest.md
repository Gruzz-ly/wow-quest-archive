==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Isaam the Unraveler.jpg|Isaam the Unraveler|The former high priest of [[Naakroa]], now known as the Unraveler. He believes he can earn [[Xal'atath]]'s favor by bringing about a second Devouring.}}
Slay Issam the Unraveler.
*[[Issam the Unraveler]] slain {{co|60.5|62.5|K'aresh}}

==Description==
Their leader conducts the last ritual site. Issam the Unraveler... I saw him live up to that name. If he uses our echo machine against us, he and his followers will tear through everything. We'll all be offerings to their absent "god."

Slay him and end his ritual. We can't allow a second [[Devouring]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80|}}
*15,250 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Killing him should stop the ritual. It has to.

==Completion==
No. He's dead. Why hasn't it stopped? It's only growing stronger.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Om'taha]]|Don't get too close to the machine. The [[arcane]] energy will tear you apart.}}

Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Issam the Unraveler|A new Devouring for a new age!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Issam the Unraveler|[[Xal'atath|She]] promised... to return.}}
