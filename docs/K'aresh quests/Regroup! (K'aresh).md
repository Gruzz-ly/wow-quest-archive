==Objectives==
Locate [[Locus-Walker]] within [[Tazavesh]].

==Description==
We've stabilized most of the city and saved as many as we could, but our job isn't over.

Locus-Walker must still be out there looking for the enemy commander. We've already searched over most of the city, so he must be in the one place we've not yet looked.

Come, <name>. Meet me at [[Myza's Oasis]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I found our quarry, but unfortunately not before they broke into this shelter.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Let's find Locus-Walker. He was looking for the Shadowguard leader.}}

Travel to [[Myza's Oasis]] where Locus-Walker is tending to [[Injured Patron]]s and Alleria Windrunner is aiming her bow at the Shadowguards' corpses.
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|These brokers' containment suits are breached. This will take a while to mend.}}
