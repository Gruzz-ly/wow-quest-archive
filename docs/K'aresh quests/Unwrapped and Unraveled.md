==Objectives==
Find [[Alleria]] before she confronts [[Locus-Walker]].
*Find Alleria in [[Eco-Dome: Primus|Eco-Dome Primus]]

==Description==
Seeing you two on the battlefield was beautiful. It really is wonderful watching you work. If only your so-called friends had trusted you with the truth of their actions so long ago. Locus-Walker hasn't tried to deceive you with his actions in the present, though his actions in the past that led us to this point... he has been less than forthcoming about.

In all good conscience, I cannot continue hiding the truth from you or Alleria.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
This is just like the Harbinger to fulfill her oaths to the letter, but leave her allies devastated. If there was any other way to stop the All-Devouring from rising once more...

With my Reshii Ribbon, you are a step closer toward reaching Dimensius. But you will need at least twice as many to get a force large enough past his dread. aura. Good luck, <name>. Watch the Harbinger's every move.
