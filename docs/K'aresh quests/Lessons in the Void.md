'''Lessons in the Void''' is an optional breadcrumb to the questline to unlock the [[demon hunter]] class for {{pl|void elf|void elves}} for players who haven't done the "In Search of Darkness" storyline.

==Objectives==
Meet up with [[Umbric]] in [[Shan'dorah|Shand'orah]]{{sic}} in [[K'aresh]].
*[[Portal to K'aresh|Portal]] Taken to K'aresh (Optional)
*Umbric reached in Shan'dorah

==Description==
;Magister Umbric
If you have the time to visit K'aresh, I could use your help locating my wayward apprentice, [[Leona Darkstrider|Leona]].

She's been researching ways for the [[ren'dorei]] to harness the void beyond the methods we currently employ. She's identified a curious, if tenuous parallel between how demon hunters wield the [[fel]] and how we might be able to leverage those lessons to our own ends.

I'm in K'aresh often, but I can't be everywhere at once. Can you assist?

;Messenger Aelor
Ah. you're there!

Our esteemed Magister Umbric has tasked me with wrangling an able-bodied champion to assist him. An apprentice of his, Leona Darkstrider, is investigating the techniques and methods of the [[illidari]]{{sic}}.

It appears her inquiries may have put her in a bit of trouble.

The Magister can fill you in. He's in K'aresh now, and he's allowed me to open the way for you if you require transportation.

==Rewards==
