'''Charged Crystal''' is part of [[Warrant: Arcana-Monger So'zer (quest)]].

==Objectives==
Meet with Myi Koo, enter the Archival Assault delve, and collect 6 [[Arcane Energy]] Samples and an Uncharged Crystal.
*Speak with [[Myi Koo]]
*Enter the [[Archival Assault]] delve (6)
*[[Uncharged Crystal]]

==Description==
An arcane charged crystal is not an item you will find in [[K'aresh]], but there is a way we can make one!

A small helper I know can help you harvest and store [[arcane]] energy. If you return that energy and an uncharged crystal to me, we can make a charged crystal.

Gain Myi Koo's assistance, then travel through the ethereal portal to the Azure Vaults. Collect the energy and crystal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Charged Crystal]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the crystal and the required energy?

==Completion==
Myi Koo is fully charged with arcane energy. More than enough to charge a crystal.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Myi Koo]] at 54.1, 48.6 in K'aresh:
{{dialogue|Analyzing... Ready to assist.

{{gossip|quest=|Can you assist me?}}
}}

Then enter the delve, [[Archival Assault]]. Once inside, approach [[Arcane Energy]] orbs and Myi Koo will automatically absorb them.
:{{Text|Say|Myi Koo|Gathering}}

The [[Uncharged Crystal (Container)]] is in a boat like strudture in the nexus platform like area on the 2nd floor (assuming the very bottom is the first floor).

Completion of the delve is NOT required.
