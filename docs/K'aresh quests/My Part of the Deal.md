'''My Part of the Deal''' concludes the second chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. The third chapter, "Desert Power", starts immediately after with [[Eco-Dome: Rhovan (quest)]].

==Objectives==
Take [[Ve'nari]]'s [[Reshii Ribbon]].
* Ve'nari's Reshii Ribbon acquired

==Description==
The threat of the [[Shadowguard]] to [[Eco-Dome: Primus]] is over. My Reshii Ribbon is no longer needed to protect this asset. Take it. Use it wisely. Protect the greatest investment of all--our existence.

Stay focused! [[Xal'atath|The Harbinger]] has already driven off one member of your team. Once you get enough Reshii Ribbons, you still need to fight [[Dimensius]]. Find allies who will stand with us, in addition to artifacts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* +2,500 [[reputation]] with [[K'aresh Trust]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The Reshii Ribbons are a means to get you and your allies to Dimensius. You will need at least two more if this plan is going to work.

==Completion==
You have my ribbon. Go--track down the rest. Have [[Locus-Walker]] contact the other members of the [[Ravel]]. Ask the Harbinger if she knows any ancient horrors that have acquired one. Remember rule twelve--it's who you know.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Take my Reshii Ribbon. Defeat the All-Devouring.}}

Locus-Walker has a {{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen>}} option.
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Why did you tell [[Alleria Windrunner|her]]? This was a secret we said we would keep!}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Alleria would have pieced it together eventually. She's dramatic, not stupid.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Better to control when she has her little outburst.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|I should have been the one to tell her! It was my burden to share.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Returning home has made you sentimental, sorcerer. When did you ever care about your legacy and friends?}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|You walk a dark, lonely path to save us from the Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Your elf student will see the bigger picture, in time.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Stop wallowing. Go and defeat the Void Lord before he devours us all.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|At least one of you lot has figured out their priorities.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Enough! Make sure he succeeds. I have been to [[the Maw]]. I know what the Void fears.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I'm sure you do.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Then go. I have my investment to protect.}}

Interact with Ve'nari's Reshii Ribbon.

On complete, new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Ve'nari|<Name>, I want to thank you for what you have done here.

In the long run, you have made sure that we have a chance of reforming K'aresh to what it was prior to our... actions.

Your friend, Alleria... she is right about the Harbinger. Never shut an eye when she is near you, and be worried when she is not.}}

==Progression==
