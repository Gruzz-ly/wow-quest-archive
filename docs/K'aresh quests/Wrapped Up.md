'''Wrapped Up''' is part of the [[Phase Diving]] storyline in [[K'aresh]]. This quest is offered immediately after completing [[The Tabiqa]], the final quest of chapter three of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] and receiving the [[Reshii Wraps]]. Find [[Hashim]] at [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]] after picking up [[Another World]] at the [[Oasis]].

==Objectives==
Talk to Hashim about your Reshii Wraps.
* Ask [[Hashim]] about empowering the [[Reshii Wraps]]
* Cloak power assigned

==Description==
[[Shad'anis]] has told me about you--a fleshling with the ability to travel to [[Untethered Space]]. How do you accomplish such a feat? Wait--let me deduce.
 
It must be those wraps you wear as a cloak. They have been modified by a Reshii Ribbon. I have not seen such a thing since the [[Devouring War]]. Very nice. Classic.
 
Do you want classic? Or do you want powerful? I can enhance your Reshii Wraps with modern [[technomancy]] techniques to better face the dangers of Untethered Space.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Enhancing the Reshii Wraps is paramount to your survival.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Your adventures in Untethered Space will help clear the way for our Phase Divers to recover the energy that would have been lost to the Void.

==Notes==
Speak with Hashim once more:
{{dialogue|So you are the one Shad'anis was telling me about? I expected more, but as the saying goes, don't judge a vessel by its wraps.

How can Hashim help you?

{{gossip|How do I empower my Reshii Wraps?}}
{{dialogue-child|You imbue your Reshii Wraps with Ethereal Strands.

Ethereal Strands await where arcane power surges. Earn them through Delves, Mythic Keystone Dungeons, and PVP matches across Khaz Algar. In K'aresh, you can additionally seek them within the Manaforge Omega and by completing Warrants. Each strand brings you closer to unlocking your true potential.

{{gossip|I'd like to talk about something else.}}}}

{{gossip|What is it that you do?}}
{{dialogue-child|I am one of a few individuals with the knowledge to enhance one's Reshii Wraps. For someone like you? I could do some minor add-ons. As a mortal with a physical body, a slightly over-tuned enhancement would tear you to shreds. We don't want that--you losing your life, and me having to clean up.
