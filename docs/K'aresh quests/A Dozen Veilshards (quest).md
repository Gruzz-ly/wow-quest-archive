==Objectives==
Collect 12 Stolen Veilshards
*[[Stolen Veilshard]] (12)

==Description==
Yes I know of Veilshards, a highly prized treasure, often the target of thieves! But rest assured, the upstanding [[citizen Om'sto]], would not be involved in such crimes.

To find Veilshards you need only look to the rats of this city, they are the craftiest of thieves!

Follow a [[Thieving Scurrier]] to its nest, and you're bound to uncover a gem among it's stolen hoard. Bring back what you find, and we'll bundle them into a neat dozen for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[A Dozen Veilshards]]

==Progress==
Did you follow the rats? <!-- Wowhead is missing "you", so is it in the game? -->

==Completion==
I see the city vermin were not a problem for you. This dozen will make an interesting shape. I will package them up for you!

==Notes==
This quest is similar to [[A Bag of Veilshards (quest)]]. Thieving Scurriers can be found around most of Tazavesh in front of trash piles. Prodding one will start a minigame in which you must follow them to the shard. Though the scurriers can appear in the Bazaar of Tangible Delights, it is unwise to search for them there. You may end up having to if your luck for drop rate isn't the best.
