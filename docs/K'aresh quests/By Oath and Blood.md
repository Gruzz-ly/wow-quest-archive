==Objectives==
Rescue [[Om'fennad]].
*Commandeer [[Om'fennad's Barge]]
*Om'fennad rescued
*Escape [[North Sufaad]]

==Description==
After the [[Devouring]], I didn't think I'd see Fennad again. At first, it was easier to stay angry at him for leaving than to grieve. Then it was easier to forget, to only focus on surviving the next day. Seeing him again brought everything back.

Oath-breaker... He had forsaken his oath to come home, but family is the first oath we're born to. What would it make me if I abandoned him now?

He's my brother--by oath and by blood. I won't leave him to the [[Sufaadi]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I almost didn't expect her to come for me, especially not like that. Even so, the [[Damaged Echo Surveyor|surveyor]]'s damaged and [[Shahata]]'s supplies went up in flames. Maybe I shouldn't have come home.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shahata|Ruya's too panicked to carry us. We'll take Fennad's barge.}}
:''They take off.''

Hop on [[Om'fennad's Barge]] just southeast:
:{{text|say|Shahata|Get up top and keep your eyes peeled!}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|They couldn't have gone far. He must be down there.}}
:''Shahata navigates the barge to the center of North Sufaad, where [[Writ-Wreaver]] has [[Om'fennad]] strung up!''
Writ-Weaver yells: This broker's sister has violated our temple.
:{{text|say|Shahata|There he is!}}
Writ-Weaver yells: By right of trespass, his life belongs to the Testing!
:{{text|say|Shahata|Windhunters! Keep them off of us.}}
:''[[Sufaadi Windhunter]]s attack!''

Use the vehicle's #1 ability to fend off the invaders:
: {{abilities|Shahata's Spear|Launch a projectile that deals high damage to the first enemy hit.|id=1216644|notes=Instant}}

After enough die or the barge reaches 0 health, Shahata takes over:
:{{text|say|Shahata|They're going to kill him! There's no time to fight through...}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|I'm going to do something stupid. Hold on!}}
:''She navigates the barge into the center of the area, destroying it, killing Writ-Weaver, and dazing the observers.''
:{{text|say|Shahata|Run before they recover!}}

Escape the area and find Om'fennad and Shahata in a small cave:
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|Shahata, your camp... I tried to stop them--}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|It doesn't matter. We couldn't find the necklace.}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|I guess this makes us both oath-breakers.}}

They have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Shahata|I've been unkind. You've come through for me, which is a rare thing in the wastes. In spite of everything, I'm glad you brought my brother back to me.}}
{{dialogue|title=Om'fennad|Was that you I saw riding the barge down into the crowd of Wastelanders? You know I'll expect you to help pay for that.}}
