==Objectives==
Kill Arcane Creatures and seal the Unstable Artifact.
*[[Arcane]] entities destroyed (0/100%)
*[[Unstable Artifact]] sealed

==Description==
Somehow, an artifact in the [[Grand Menagerie|Menagerie]] has broken open--unleashing a swarm of furious arcane creatures. They're wreaking havoc, and havoc is bad for the project. I need someone capable of getting this situation under control with no questions asked.

If you can get down there, clear your way through the creatures, and seal that artifact--I'll make it worth your while.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Pendant of Arcane Havoc]]
*[[Menagerie's Lost Relic]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your assignment?

==Completion==
You sealed the artifact? Excellent! The remaining creatures should dissipate in time.

You've handled the danger with remarkable skill. As promised, here are your rewards.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{Text|say|Xy'bin|I need help! Arcane manifestations are out of control!}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'ka|This must be the new specialist. Help me first!}}

To fill up the bar, kill [[Unstable Manifestation]]s (+10%), [[Unstable Mote]]s (+3%), and [[Enchanted Ledger]]s (+8%).

Enter the eastern building {{Co|56.1|53.4|Tazavesh}} and interact with the Unstable Artifact in the middle of the main chamber.
