==Objectives==
Align the [[K'areshi Fragment|shard of K'aresh]] with the [[void]] energy in [[Voidscar Cavern|the cave]].
*Northern Fragment location aligned
*Southern Fragment location aligned

==Description==
[[Adarus Duskblaze|Adarus]] is preparing his mind and body for the ritual.

Our task is to place the fragment at two points within this cavern, which will both align the crystal to the void energy in the area and attract any void entities that reside nearby.

Defeat those entities and their essence will be absorbed into the fragment, empowering it further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Move quickly, <name>. Time is of the essence.

==Completion==
Well done, I'll take it from here.

==Notes==
Place the [[K'aresh Fragment]] at the marked spots, then fend off waves of [[Void Tunneler]]s, [[Void Crawler]]s, [[Void Stalker (K'aresh)|Void Stalker]]s, concluding with named enemies: one of [[Ekisath the Prideful]], [[Relnath the Marciless]], or [[Levianon the Starved]].
