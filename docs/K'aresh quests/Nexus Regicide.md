{{questportrait|Nexus-Prince Azir.jpg|Nexus-Prince Azir|Nexus-Prince Azir stole the [[Dark Heart]] from Xal'atath and may still know where it is.}}
Defeat the leader of the [[Shadowguard]] in [[Shadow Point: Apotheosis|Umbral Garrison: Apotheosis]] on [[K'aresh]].
* Follow [[Alleria]] to Umbral Garrison: Apotheosis
* [[Phase-Thief Azir|Nexus-Prince Azir]]'s [[Reshii Ribbon]]

==Description==
Now is the time, <name>.

We must not hesitate. They will send their strongest to defend this last manaforge. We will find Nexus-Prince Azir there and we will end him before we take this battle to [[Dimensius]]. [[Xal'atath]] or no Xal'atath, we have what we need to do this. Just one final kill. 

Let us not dally. Make haste.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Fallen Prince's Crown]]
*[[Fallen Prince's Mask]]
*[[Fallen Prince's Helm]]
*[[Fallen Prince's Headplate]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Hmmph.

I grow tired of this lesson, <name>. Always when we get close to someone they betray us. They falter. They turn. They die. Always we put them in danger and we fail to protect them.

Let no one else stand in our path. You and me, <name>. We will finish this.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath surely means to betray us. Let us destroy the final garrison before she gets the chance.}}

Head to [[Shadow Point: Apotheosis]] where [[Locus-Walker]], [[Lash'ir]], [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Narathe]], [[Jayaan]] and [[Naia]], and [[Soul-Scribe]] are ready to confront Azir:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|At last. Our oaths will be shed in glory today.}}
:{{Text|Say|Nexus-Prince Azir|By my hand [[Dimensius]] returns! The Dark Heart I stole from the Harbinger will revive the All-Devouring!}}

Upon slaying Azir, a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|Real-Time Cutscene]] "[[Salhadaar]] invokes the Oath" starts:
{{#ev:youtube|wdTlBkQPS0o|Salhadaar invokes the Oath}}

:''Azir has been slain. The Adventurer, Alleria, Locus-Walker and Xal'atath begin to walk out but a Royal Voidwing crashes down knocking everyone but Xal'atath.''
:''The Royal voidwing turns revealing to be [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]]''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|Salhadaar survived?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nexus-King Salhadaar|Oracles of K'aresh!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nexus-King Salhadaar|You dare defy your king?}}
:''The Soul-Scribe looks at Salhadaar.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nexus-King Salhadaar|You dare break your oath?!}}
:''The Soul-Scribe walk towards him.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Soul-Scribe|King Salhadaar...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Soul-Scribe|You died! And our oath died with you!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nexus-King Salhadaar|No. With Dimensius as my master, I have been remade in the Void.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nexus-King Salhadaar|Your oath to me still stands!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nexus-King Salhadaar|Honor it now, and slay the [[Ravel]] as you swore to do!}}
:''Soul-Scribe looks at Locus-Walker and then back towards Salhadaar.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Soul-Scribe|How could we fight for you? You serve the All-Devouring!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nexus-King Salhadaar|And by sacred oath, so do all of you.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nexus-King Salhadaar|Obey. Or die as oath-breakers.}}
:''The Soul-Scribe sighs. She begins to rally the Oracles.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Soul-Scribe|Oracles... Wastelanders...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Soul-Scribe|We... have no choice.}}
:''Nexus-King Salhadaar takes off as Alleria and the Adventurer turn to face the Wastelanders.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Soul-Scribe|Kill the Ravel and their followers!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Soul-Scribe|Fulfill your oath!}}
:''The Soul-Scribe leaves''

On the other side of the cutscene, Alleria stands against Narathe, Jayaan, and [[Lash'ir]]. Interact with [[Nexus-Prince Azir's Reshii Ribbon]]:
:''Alleria prepares to shoot.''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I don't care about your oaths! You don't have to betray us!}}
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|We have no choice! We will not die as oath-breakers!}}
:''They start their attack!''
:{{Text|Emote|Alleria sighs in frustration before releasing her attack.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Take Azir's Reshii Ribbon, <Name>. We have paid a steep price for it. There are so few left to fight Dimensius.}}
:''Alleria takes off.''

Head outside where Alleria argues with [[Xal'atath]]:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Where were you, Xal'atath? What betrayal have you planned?}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|The Wastelanders betrayed you. Our interests are still aligned, and victory is within our grasp.}}
