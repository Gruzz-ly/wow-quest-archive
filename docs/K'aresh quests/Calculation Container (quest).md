==Objectives==
5 Weighty Variable Rod delivered to Engineer Om'loof
*[[Weighty Variable Rod]]s delivered back to Om'loof

==Description==
A Calculation Container is no easy feat to construct.

I have not made one recently, as thieves have stolen the data rods I need to complete the task. If you can recover the rods, I could create one.

Be warned!

The rods are quite heavy and will take some effort to return them. I have been known to drop them quite easily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Calculation Container]]

==Progress==
Have you found what we need?

==Completion==
Carrying those weighty rods is quite unpleasant. I am relieved that the task of transporting them fell upon you.

The effort was worth it though! I have constructed the item you desire.

==Notes==
The [[Shadowguard]] to the north and east of [[Echo-Dome: Primus]] has a chance to spawn a rod. [[File:Weighty_Variable_Rod.png|thumb|A Weighty Variable Rod waiting for pickup]]
Holding the rod gives you a buff that slows movement speed by 7% and makes you unable to fly. You can carry all 5 at once. [[File:PlayerHolding5WeightyVariableRods.png|thumb|A player holding 5 rods at once.]] Getting/Entering into combat will likely cause the rod to drop. You will need to pick back up any rods that fell. You will get a warning message "You have dropped a Weighty Variable Rod." You can pick it back up in the middle of combat at no penalty other than another chance for it to drop, but it is better than having it despawn. You can track how many you are carrying with the number of stacks on the buff. The number of stacks DO increase the amount of slow. Bring the rods to the dotted circle line near Om'loof to get the credit.
