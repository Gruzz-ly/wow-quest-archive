'''Mandatory Time Off''' begins the optional "On a Technicality" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] alongside [[Overwhelm Them]]. Find [[Associate Xy'nell]] outside the [[Xy Imports Offices]] in northeastern [[Tazavesh]] to begin. This chapter awards 500 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and Explorer 1 legs.

Both of these quests are revisited in the world quest [[Overwhelm Them with Mandatory Time Off]].

==Objectives==
Place 7 Illusion Devices.
*Spy on [[Coordinator Xy'thir]]
*[[Illusion Device]]s placed (7)

==Description==
If my colleagues knew of my plan, they would be in danger of discharging their oaths as good employees. Besides that, they are far too excellent at their jobs.

Take these. They're devices of my own creation. When placed near my colleagues, it will create an illusion of them working.

They will be able to step away and rest. And the business will be under even more pressure without them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I had to become good at illusions for this job. It was the only way to make it tolerable.

Maybe now I can use those skills to help others for once.

==Completion==
I'm glad none of my coworkers will have to see what we're going to do. They deserve the rest.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|I can't let anyone else make the oath. I have to do something...}}

Before accepting any quests, Xy'nell has this to say:
{{dialogue|Something must be done...

<Xy'nell seems to notice you.>

Oh, sorry. May I help you?}}

Pick up a quest and he says:
{{dialogue|You can still see my boss around the corner, right? He hasn't moved?

Good.

{{gossip|Why do you want your business to fail?}}

I don't want the business to fail. I need it to suffer a hiccup.

If we inflict a little chaos now, I can restore everything at the end. When you see what the coordinator is doing, maybe you will understand.

<Xy'nell's voice is on edge.>

I would be acting against my oath as an employee if I made the business fail.

{{gossip|I understand.}}}}

Pick up both quests:
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|With the pressure you and I are going to create, not even my coworkers will be able to keep up.}}
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|Let's be sure they are kept out of the plan.}}

Walk inside:
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|Xy'mern. Why are the associates scheduled for relief tomorrow?}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'mern|Ah, coordinator. They've been working for many consecutive hours, and I deemed it most efficient to provide them time to rest...}}
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|They're under oath, as are you. No one stops their work until I say they do.}}
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|Are you not up to the task?}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'mern|No, coordinator. I'll... I'll take another shift.}}

Head northeast outside to [[Xy Imports Receiving]] and get to work breaking crates and placing devices. Place one device along the southwest wall near three Xy employees:
:{{text|say|Xy Imports Organizer|Xy'nell's illusions have become very convincing. I think we might actually be able to take a break.}}

At the southwest:
:{{text|say|Xy Imports Associate|An illusion? Tell Xy'nell I thank him for the reprieve. I'll rest soon.}}

After completing both tasks, head back to Xy'nell:
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|Xy'vim, you are behind on your duties. I expect better from my employees.}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'vim|I'm sorry, Coordinator Xy'thir, but a shipment of devourer mites has gone awry!}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'mern|Our workers are vanishing from their positions, coordinator. They need time to rest!}}
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|Your excuses belie your incompetence. Fix this mess before I am forced to intervene.}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'mern|Yes, coordinator.}}
:{{text|say|Organizer Xy'vim|Yes, coordinator.}}
