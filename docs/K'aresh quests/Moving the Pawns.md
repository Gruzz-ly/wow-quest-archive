==Objectives==
Meet [[Locus-Walker]] at [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]].

==Description==
There is a small island to the northwest of here, called Overlook Zo'Shuul. My scouts have been searching for a way into [[Manaforge Omega]], where we must stop the return of [[Dimensius the All-Devouring|the All-Devouring]].

If we are fortunate, the scouts have already found a safe pathway inside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,100 [[XP]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I hope my scouts have found a way to safely enter the Manaforge.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|The Trust sent scouts to observe the Shadowguard's manaforge. Come along, <name>.}}
:''Locus-Walker and [[Xal'atath]] teleport out. [[Alleria Windrunner]] brings out her [[gryphon]] and takes off.''

Before leaving, some gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Locus-Walker|
This is what is at stake.

When you look upon my world, do you understand why I would stop at nothing to stop this from happening again?
}}

Fly over to [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]] where Alleria, Xal'atath & Locus-Walker are waiting.
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I can feel a presence. It's...growing.}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|Dimensius. His power is so great that no mortal can approach without being destroyed.}}

More gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Xal'atath|I can sense him, <name>.

Dimensius.

His presence feels heavy, this close to the machinations of the Shadowguard.

It is unsettling.

Let us resolve this quickly.}}

{{dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|Be careful.

We're very close to the enemy.}}
