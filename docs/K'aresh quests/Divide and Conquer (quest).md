==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Shadowguard Cannons in [[Serrated Peaks]].
* [[Shadowguard Cannon]]s destroyed (3)
* [[Nullbomb]] (provided)

==Description==
Of all the assets on the field of battle, the troops are the most expendable. I've sent enough to their destruction to know this as a fact. If we are to safeguard this dome for Ve'nari and get her Reshii Ribbon, we should destroy their cannons.

Those cannons are easily worth the lives of all of their soldiers. Destroy them and their commanders will sound the retreat. Most field commanders would never admit this as it's bad for morale, but you seem like the type that can handle uncomfortable truths.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Taking out these cannons will force the Shadowguard's retreat. I would not listen to Xal'atath's ideas on ethics of command, though.

==Completion==
Without their cannons, the Shadowguard's attacks on the eco-dome are doomed to failure. Ve'nari won't have need of her Reshii Ribbon.

I'm more and more unsettled by this plan of ours, though. The secrets, this Alliance with Xal'atath. I fear Locus-Walker made a mistake thousands of years ago, and we cannot escape that ancient mistake.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Her Dark Side]] and [[Counter Measures]] before heading out.

Before leaving, Xal'atath has new gossip:
{{dialogue|My defenses will kill the Shadowguard who may threaten our little agreement with dear Ve'nari. I know you must be so very disappointed. Killing is what you're best at, isn't it?}}

Head to the [[Serrated Peaks]] and [[Alleria Windrunner]] appears.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I can sense Xal'atath buzzing about you. Don't listen to her lies.}}

Alleria will accompany you for the three quests and has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Strike its head, and the body will fall.}}

You were equipped with the ability: {{Abilities|Nullbomb|Stuns all enemies within 5 yards of the impact, rendering them unable to move or attack for 2 sec. Inflicts 4 Shadow damage to enemies within 5 yards of the impact.|icon=inv_nullstone_void|id=473548}}

Take out each Shadowguard Cannon in turn:
#{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I'm not the one lying to you about what happened to K'aresh.}}
#{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|The world breaking apart shattered [[Dimensius]]. He wouldn't do that to himself.}}
#{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Who controlled the Reshii Ribbons? Who wanted the Void Lord destroyed?}}<br> {{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|What are you saying? I've had enough of your whispers!}}

==Progression==
