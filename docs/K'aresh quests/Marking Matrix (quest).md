==Objectives==
8 Void Markings extracted from Shadowguard enemies. 
*[[Void Marking]] extracted (8)
*[[Containment Trap (Marking Matrix)]] (provided)

==Description==
A Marking Matrix must be attuned to the frequency of the void energies wielded by the Shadowguard. You must obtain samples of that energy.

My containment Trap is designed to capture Shadowguard and allow you to extract the void markings tied to their corrupted energies.

With those markings I can create a matrix to help attune your creation to work on void powered constructs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Marking Matrix]]

==Progress==
Have you finished the work?

==Completion==
Don't tell me what that matrix is going to help make, but I hope that it's quite an exciting creation!

==Notes==
Use the Containment Trap on any Shadowguard in on K'areash to trap them for 30 seconds. The item places a trap on the ground which you can place at the foot of your target or cause them to walk over. Once a Shadowguard is trapped, they will be trapped for 30 seconds. Right click on them to extract the essence. This places a seven minute buff on them ([[Extraction Collected]]) that keeps the same target from being used for 8 minutes. The trap can be used on multiple targets if thrown at their feet.
