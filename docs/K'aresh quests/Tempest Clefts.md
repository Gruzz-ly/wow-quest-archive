==Objectives==
Bring 6 Void Cleft Essences to [[Xal'atath]] in the [[Tempest Fields]].
*[[Void Cleft Essence]] (6)
*[[Essence Collector]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Wastelanders]] were once the oracles of the [[Worldsoul]] of [[K'aresh]]. They were so proud and strident about their oaths. Now they scavenge the ruins like animals. Even rats have their uses. 

Gather void cleft essences for me. I have an idea of how we might sway the fallen oracles to our cause.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Many denizens of the Void are voracious consumers of energy. They greedily flock to pockets of coalesced energy like moths to a flame.

==Completion==
Well done, my champion. We shall use this to draw out our prey.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|To gain access to their camp, we must impress them with your combat prowess. We'll start with these void creatures.}}

Interact with the Void Cleft Essences from the [[Void Cleft]]s that are all over the Tempest Fields.

Once that is done, return to [[Xal'atath]]:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I sense void essence about you. It will make a perfect lure.}}

==Progression==
{{Desert Power}}
