==Objectives==
Help [[Leona Darkstrider|Leona]] defeat the empowered [[cosmic worm]] and claim its power.
*[[Ramon'ta the Insatiable]] fed (3)
*Ramon'ta the Insatiable lured
*Ramon'ta the Insatiable defeated
*Report back to [[Adarus Duskblaze|Adarus]] in [[Shan'dorah]]
*[[Void Lure]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Void]] espouses all truths, <name>. And in none of them do I defeat Ramon'ta without some help.

And here you are.

My quarry is a cosmic worm known as Ramon'ta the Insatiable. It started out small enough, but with each void entity it feasts upon, it grows, and its power grows along with it.

If we can defeat it, I can claim its power. Will you help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Wrap this up quickly, <class>. I have more important matters to attend to.

==Completion==
You've been helpful so far. And in return, I'll allow you to take part in making history on [[K'aresh|this discarded, broken corpse of a planet]].

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|We must feed Ramon'ta on the remains of the [[Void Tempest]]s that we defeat here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|Only then will he be suffused with enough void energy to be useful for Adarus' ritual.}}

She hands over the [[Void Lure]]. Use it on the corpses of [[Storm Tempest]] elementals in the area:
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|Good. I wasn't sure if would take to the lure.}}
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|So voracious. I can feel the void energy emanating from it.}}
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|That's enough. I've prepared an area where we can confront this creature.}}
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|Let's head there and get what I came for.}}

Head to the marked location at {{Co|57.33|18.66|K'aresh}} to the north. Several dead [[Shadowguard Adept (K'aresh)|Shadowguard Adept]]s are present:
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|When you're ready for a fight, toss a lure in the center there.}}

The extra action button {{Abilities|Void Lure|id=1235967||icon=inv_nullstone_void}} becomes available. Toss it to the corpses which summons the worm. Kill it.
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|Thank you, <name>. I should be able to get all Void energy needed for the ritual.}}
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|Head back to Adarus. I'll complete the harvest and I'll be following close behind.}}

Head back to Shan'dorah and speak with Adarus:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|quest=|<Report on Leona's success in harvesting Ramon'ta's void essence.>}}
}}

:''Leona runs in.''
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|I've harvested the void essence of Ramon'ta. All we need is the appropriate vessel to store it for the ritual.}}
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|Don't forget our pact, Adarus. Once your ritual is complete, you'll share the secrets of the illidari with us.}}
:{{Text|say|Adarus Duskblaze|Of course, my dark cousin.}}

==Progression==
{{In Search of Darkness}}
