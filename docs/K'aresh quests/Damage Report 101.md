==Objectives==
Find botanist Om'nittar and shield technician Om'door and bring their reports to [[Ve'nari]].
*[[Om'nittar]] found
*[[Void Creeper]]s dealt with (6)
*[[Botanical Report|Botanic Report received]]
*[[Om'door]] found
*[[Void Spore]]s collected (8)
*[[Shield Technician Report|Technician Report received]]

==Description==
Just like [[Engineer Om'loof]], I have hired more well-regarded, highly trained, expensive management consultants from [[cartel Om]]. Two of them have not reported in. Are they dead, or just distracted again? 

Find botanist Om'nittar and shield technician Om'door. Get their damage reports. I need to know if the attack caused any lasting damage to my dome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I hire the best. I am sure Om'nittar and Om'door have the information I need.

==Completion==
Are they alive? Good. Next time they forget to check in, they won't be.

<Ve'nari skims through the reports.>

It looks like there was minimal damage--if any at all--to most of the facility. The Shadowguard saboteurs were focused on rerouting our energy reserves to the outer conduits. They have ignored the environmental and secondary systems.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both,
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|Dangling your ribbon in front of us so we do your dirty work. You haven't changed, Ve'nari.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|I'll give the traveler the ribbon when it's not the only thing keeping the biomes in this dome alive!}}

Head northeast of the dome and speak to [[Om'nittar]]:
{{Dialogue|Stranger! What a mess!

The eco-dome's containment system went down for a brief moment and several void creepers took advantage of it. Will you help me get rid of them?}}

All over the area kick 6 void creepers out of the dome. Once that is done, speak to Om'nittar.
{{Dialogue|Thank you, stranger. What brought you to me?

{{gossip|quest=|Ve'nari is asking for your report}}

Yes, yes. Of course.

We have lost a small number of plants. but luckily, these were not rare and will replenish with time.

I wish to see [[K'aresh]] bloom, or at least have the eco-domes reminding us of a time long ago where everything was better-a time before the void lord. before the Harbinger, before our world shattered and our lives collapsed.

Alas, I shouldn't bother you with such things.

Tell Ve'nari that I have it all under control.}}

Head southwest of the dome and speak to [[Om'door]].
{{Dialogue|Who are you? What are you doing in here? I don't have the time to chat with a fleshling unless you came here to tell me it is time for a break.

{{gossip|quest=|Ve'nari wanted to make sure you were still alive.}}

I am alive, yes. I have been trying to collect these vold spores ever since the attack. I am tired.

Maybe you can take over for a bit?}}

Collect the 8 void spores using the ability: {{Abilities|Void Collector|image=inv_cosmicvoid_nova|id=1214312|Remove debris and unwanted parasites}}

Once that is done, speak to Om'door.
{{dialogue|Thank you for the help. I can take it from here.

Is there anything I can do for you in return?

{{gossip|quest=|Ve'nari is asking for your report}}

{{Dialogue-child|Ah, I see.

Tell Ve'nari that the shield integrity is in a good shape. Luck was on our side this time, as the Shadowguard attack was focused on control consoles rather than the eco-dome itself.

I will keep surveying everything. enhancing some key locations with arcane energy before moving back to the usual maintenance routine.}}
}}

Om'door hands over the [[Shield Technician Report]]. Return to [[Ve'nari]] to turn in both quests.

On return:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|The systems may be stabilized, but the Shadowguard continue to raid the eco-dome for its energy.}}

{{Void Alliance}}
