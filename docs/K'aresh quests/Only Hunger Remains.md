==Objectives==
Slay Naakroan Wastelanders.
*Naakroan Wastelander slain (12)

==Description==
They think [[Xal'atath]] has returned for them--that their worship will be rewarded. They'll consume everything to prove their devotion to her.

We came here for peace--to rebuild our shattered home. We have to protect the future, <name>. It's all we have left. These [[Wastelanders]] are massing to raid the [[eco-dome]]s. If they manage to bring down the shields, they'll pick them clean. Don't give them that chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We won't let them take what we've built.

==Completion==
Even if we fail here, this might give our defenders a chance.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests:
:{{text|say|Om'taha|I'll find my way back in and meet you at the machine.}}
:''She runs off.''

The three staves are marked on the minimap. Get to them while killing adds.

Om'taha has new gossip at the turn-in location:
{{dialogue|
Look at what they've done... No, what we let them do. They would never have been able to corrupt the echo machine without our aid. 

I will put this right. For my friends, for K'aresh.}}
