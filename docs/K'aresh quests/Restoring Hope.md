==Objectives==
Cleanse the eco-dome of invasive elements.
* Dome cleansed (0/100%)

==Description==
This dome is a reasonable facsimile of [[K'aresh]]. We will find no better place for [[Soul-Scribe]] to hear the Worldsoul's song. 

And yet, as [[Dimensius]] grows in power, even the Oasis succumbs to the Void. I can feel the Rifts tearing open. Their energies will disrupt this delicate ritual. Unfortunately they'll need to be closed so Soul-Scribe can be convinced.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Cuffs of the Riftsealer]]
*[[Bindings of the Riftsealer]]
*[[Bracers of the Riftsealer]]
*[[Armplates of the Riftsealer]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The Void creeps further and further into K'aresh every day. Dimensius's power grows ever stronger.

==Completion==
We have a lot riding on this Tabiqa ritual going exactly to plan. Having to kill her to get her ribbon would be inconvenient.

==Notes==
Pick up [[K'aresh That Was]] before heading out:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|I've heard the Song of K'aresh before. These plants... All this beauty of nature--a pale shadow of K'aresh that was.}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|If you think to trick me, I will use my Reshii Ribbon to destroy you.}}

While in the area, [[Driruj]] starts [[Chipping the Void]].

Fill the bar by slaying, destroying, or closing the invasive elements that are listed:
* [[Invasive Wurm Egg]] (6-7%)
* [[Invasive Wurm]] slain (2%)
* [[Void Rift]] closed (10%)
* [[Rift Mite]] slain (2%)

Upon interacting with a [[Void Rift]], [[Xal'atath]] appears and destroys it, saying one of the following lines:
*{{text|say|Xal'atath|This should work, if K'aresh responds.}}
*{{text|say|Xal'atath|There you go, my champion.}}
*{{text|say|Xal'atath|We can't let the Void complicate the ritual.}}

Once the bar is filled, turn in both quests.
