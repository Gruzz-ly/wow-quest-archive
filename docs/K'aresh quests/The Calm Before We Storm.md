==Objectives==
Check in with [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and the [[void elf|void elves]] at [[Shan'dorah]] on [[K'aresh]].
* Approach Alleria
* Speak with Alleria
* Listen to Alleria (Optional)
* Heal the [[Wounded Riftwalker]]

==Description==
[[Narathe]] is right. We are fortunate that void elves have experience battling the [[Shadowguard]]. The wastes of [[K'aresh]] are merciless, and the battle to come will be as well. I hope they are prepared for a brutal fight. These will not be the scattered scouts they are used to fighting on [[Telogrus]].

You should ensure they are ready for the battle to come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We have spent a long time preparing for this moment. I will not let it slip.

==Completion==
These elves are more resilient than I thought. Perhaps our people have both been tempered by adversity?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|The [[Ravel]] [[Locus-Walker|sorcerer]] is here. Fortunately for him, my oaths do not demand his death specifically.}}
:''Soul-Scribe and Narathe walk over.''

Head to [[Alleria Windrunner]], and [[Locus-Walker]], and [[Xal'atath]] at the big building:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I needed the ren'dorei, Locus-Walker. I don't trust you any more than --}}
:''Xal'atath teleports in as Soul-Scribe and Narathe walk up.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath!}}
:{{text|say|Xal'atath|Time to aim our weapons towards Dimensius instead of our allies, Alleria.}}

Speak with Alleria:
{{dialogue|I'm glad you've joined the fray. <name>. We have a difficult path ahead of us.

{{gossip|quest=|What do you need?}}
{{dialogue-child|The journey here from [[Telogrus Rift|Telogrus]] was not without risk or complication. Some of our riftwalkers were severely injured as they traversed the space between worlds. But they were able to bring with them enough of a force to defeat the Shadowguard.

Help [[Riftblade Maella]] with the wounded. I need to take the measure of our new allies.}}
{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}

:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|The ren'dorei are gathered. They have fought the [[Shadowguard]] before.}} 
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Perhaps your band of outcasts will finish the job this time?}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|What of your vendetta, Soul-Scribe? Should I prepare for your blade in my back?}}
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|The Ravel will pay for their crimes in time.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Not an ounce of trust between us. What hope do we have of victory?}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Such pessimism. Do you really think I would have thrown in my lot for a hopeless cause?}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Together we will destroy the All-Devouring. The only other choice is our own destruction.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Trust? Trust is overrated. But we all want to survive, and isn't that enough?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|You're right. I have no trust for any of you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|But for [[Azeroth]] to survive, you can trust the ren'dorei will defeat the All-Devouring.}}

Just west are [[Riftblade Maella]] and [[Verana]], next to the Wounded Riftwalker. Speak with the riftwalker:
{{dialogue|<The Riftwalker lays wounded in the sands. You may be able to assist.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Bandage the Riftwalker.>}}}}
:{{Text|emote|The wounded Riftwalker gives you a grateful look for healing them.}}
:{{Text|Say|Riftblade Maella|Alleria called for our aid against Dimensius. We will follow her to the end.}}
