'''Arcane Runed Sigil''' is part of [[Warrant: Arcana-Monger So'zer (quest)]].

==Objectives==
Enter the [[Archival Assault]] delve and collect 0{{sic}} Etched Fragments.
* [[Etched Fragment]] (24)

==Description==
An Arcane Runed Sigil is essential in proving an item's authenticity as a true masterpiece of Azure artisans. Of course, they can be affixed to any object, turning a flea market trinket into something that appears to be a priceless work of art.

I could create something like that, and it might turn a great profit. If you travel to the [[Azure Vault]] and gather the parts I need, we can use them to craft a Sigil.

Bring me enough parts for two, and I shall keep one as my fee for the service.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Arcane Runed Sigil]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the parts?

==Completion==
Excellent, this is more than enough to construct what you require.

==Notes==
The fragments drop from the [[Shadowguard]] [[ethereal]]s and their minions.

==Progression==
{{A Key Threat}}
