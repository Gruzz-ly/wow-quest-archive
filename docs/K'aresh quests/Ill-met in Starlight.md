==Objectives==
Meet [[Shahata]] at her camp.

==Description==
I used to practice what I would say when I saw [[Om'fennad|my brother]] again. Then I stopped believing I would...

He's been away all this time, and now he comes to ask for heirlooms? I dug our mother's grave beside her favorite tree. Alone. He should have come back then, I don't have time to help him ease his conscience now.

If you two are so set on talking, at least have the sense not to do it in the open. Come to my camp--we'll speak there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34|}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hadn't expected to see Fennad again. He's a bit late to help with mother's funeral rites. The tree is gone along with the grave, and now he comes to ask for favors?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shahata|Don't linger here. We can speak at my camp.}}
:''She flies off!''
:{{text|yell|Om'fennad|Shahata! Wait!}}
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|Follow her! I'll hire a barge and catch up.}}
:''Om'fennad runs the other way.''

Follow Shahata east to her outpost not far from [[North Sufaad]], where Om'fenaad has somehow already made it there:
:{{text|say|Om'fennad|Don't you have anything? What about the necklace she made for you?}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|Even if I do, why would I give it to you?}}
:{{text|say|Shahata|You left, and I stayed. We both have to live with that.}}
