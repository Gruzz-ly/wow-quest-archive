==Objectives==
Meet [[Xal'atath]] in the [[Tempest Fields]].
* Talk to Xal'atath (Optional)

==Description==
Those [[Wastelanders]] have [[Om'bera|that broker]]'s ribbon. We must get it back or you will never be able to reach [[Dimensius]].

They are deliciously bloodthirsty. I think we should lure them to our cause. We need an army for the coming battle, and they have the numbers for that.

The void glass lies between their camp and us. That might provide a means to manipulate--speak with the Wastelanders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The aura of Dimensius is tearing what's left of K'aresh apart. Soon he will draw what remains of this little world.

Our time to stop him grows shorter by the hour.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|[[Locus-Walker]]|We cannot risk the Wastelanders claiming my ribbon. I... I will return to the safety of [[Tazavesh]].}}

Xal'atath has a {{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} option.
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I think this latest complication is your fault. Locus-Walker. These Wastelanders are your old enemies, the oracles of K'aresh.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|I remember how much trouble they caused you in the Devouring war. Are they why you failed to kill Dimensius?}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|The holy class are always the most savage fighters during an apocalypse. We could use that.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|If we could get them to parley, I could convince them to fight for us. We are trying to save the world--this time.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Om'resh]]|You can't mean to try to ally with those murderers!}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|Much as I would like to see them pay, Xal'atath is right.}}
:{{Text|Say|Locus-Walker|They are fierce warriors, and would be useful in the battle to come.}}

Cross the bridge north to the Tempest Fields and catch up with Xal'atath:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|Come, <Name>. Let me show you how to manifest an army.}}

Xal'atath has gossip:
{{dialogue|I have a plan to draw the Wastelanders to our side. These savages appreciate strength, so we'll show them yours.

Let's get their attention, shall we?

{{gossip|How did this void glass get here?}}

As [[Dimensius]]'s power grows, the barrier between K'aresh and the void shatters. The meteors, this glass, the creatures here--the void oozes into this reality, taking over until only a twisted unreality remains.

The longer it takes us to defeat Dimensius, the more his power will grow. And the more the void will consume what is left of this pitiful planet.}}
