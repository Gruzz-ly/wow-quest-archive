==Objectives==
Travel to [[North Sufaad]].
*K'areshi Fragment Location Reached

==Description==
[[Illidan]] taught us that if we are to fight threats that acknowledge no limits, we must be willing to do the same. With his rage he tamed the power of the [[fel]], and so will I, with the [[void]].

A fragment from [[K'aresh|this world]], touched by the [[Dimensius|All-Devouring]], is held deep in the heart of North Sufaad. With the void essence [[Leona Darkstrider|Leona]] collected, and this fragment as a vessel, I will yoke the power of the void to my will.

Combining the strength of the [[illidari]] and the secrets of the [[ren'dorei]] will make me unstoppable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Its power begs to be released. Can't you hear it?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Adarus Duskblaze|Join us in North Sufaad immediately, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Adarus Duskblaze|Or miss out on your chance to be part of something greater.}}
:A''darus mounts his felbat and Leona her mount and fly southeast toward North Sufaad.''

Follow suit. At North Sufaad, Adarus and Leona are standing by a fragment held in stasis by three pylons:
:{{Text|say|Adarus Duskblaze|Perfect, I can feel the energy radiating from it. How do we remove it?}}
:{{Text|say|Leona Darkstrider|I've read about similar containments. If we find the keys, we'll be able to deactivate these devices that hold it in place.}}

==Progression==
