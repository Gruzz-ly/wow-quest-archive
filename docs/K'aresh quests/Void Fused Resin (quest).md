==Objectives==
35 Void Granules collected.
*[[Corrupted Granules]] (35)

==Description==
Void-Fused Resin isn't my usual craft, but there is a way I could make it for you.

Void energies continue to seep through the cracks in our shields contaminating the plants in the domes. If we eliminate the contaminated plants, they may provide the ingredients needed to create the resin.

Destroy [[Void-Tainted Growths]] and bring me any Void Granules you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Void Fused Resin]]

==Progress==
Hurry, you need to finish this task!

==Completion==
I am afraid the contamination will return soon enough, but this effort should slow its progression for a few days!

Oh, look at what I created from your efforts!

==Notes==
Find and attack Void-Tainted Growths around [[Eco-Dome: Primus]]. They can be directly attacked with abilities. Destoying them will spawn [[Void Mass]] and [[Void Residue]]. Both will drop Corrupted Granules.

==Progression==
{{A Key Threat}}
