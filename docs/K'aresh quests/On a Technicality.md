==Progress==
<Xy'nell is silent before Coordinator Xy'thir.>

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Thank you for everything.

<Xy'nell appears exhausted. His figure is slouched.>

Now we do the work to set the business on track again. But perhaps after a bit of rest.

I... I can rest! The coordinator... he won't be able to find me.

<A unique brightness comes over Xy'nell.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|Hurry!}}
:''Xy'nell runs in.''
:{{text|say|Coordinator Xy'thir|... Xy'nell.}}
:{{text|emote|Associate Xy'nell shrinks away from Coordinator Xy'thir.}}
:{{text|say|Port Authority Zo'rau|Coordinator Xy'thir, I was speaking to you. I have more questions I want answered.}}

If Xy'thir isn't already engaged, speak with Zo'rau:
{{dialogue|Coordinator Xy'thir has been evasive thus far in my questioning. Are you ready to confront him properly, <class>?

{{gossip|quest=|Let's begin.}}}}
:{{text|say|Port Authority Zo'rau|Xy'thir. Your books are in complete disarray, even dating back to my predecessor.}}
:{{text|say|Coordinator Xy'thir|I apologize, Zo'rau. I am certain that my associates have failed to provide you with an accurate copy of our ledgers.}}
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|You don't need to look any further, do you, Zo'rau?}}
:{{text|emote|Zo'rau's pin flashes brightly.}}
:{{text|say|Port Authority Zo'rau|A suggestion spell? I see now why I needed a pin with illusion magic.}}
:{{text|say|Port Authority Zo'rau|Coordinator Xy'thir, you no longer have permission to do business on my docks.}}
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|Xy'nell... I'll kill you!}}

Xy'thir turns hostile! Fend him off:
:{{text|yell|Coordinator Xy'thir|Graahh! No!}}
:{{text|say|Port Authority Zo'rau|That's enough, Xy'thir.}}

On complete, Xy'nell gets a promotion to Interim Coordinator!
:{{text|say|Interim Coordinator Xy'nell|Worry not, my friend. Our oaths have been discharged. It's time to do business... properly.}}

He relocates out to the dock, where he has new gossip:
{{dialogue|My colleagues and I are working to sort out the chaos you and I set in motion. It is going very smoothly, given that I kept a detailed record of our actions.

<Xy'nell's voice grows strained.>

Coordinator Xy'thir was a tyrant.

It will take time to undo what he has done, but I will tirelessly work toward erasing his mark on this business.

{{gossip|What was the oath you made to Coordinator Xy'thir?}}

<Xy'nell winces and looks away.>

I'm sorry I couldn't tell you, <name>. I was under an oath of silence.

When I saw Coordinator Xy'thir kill Port Authority Zo'eln, I was terrified.

He'd been aggressive and violent at work before, but I thought it was normal. I thought everyone had bosses they dreaded seeing. Bosses that threw things. Bosses that belittled you.

He made me swear an oath. I could keep my job if I didn't say anything of the event. I didn't think anything of it. I needed my job. What harm could there be in a secret?

How wrong I was. How naive.

{{gossip|<Continue to listen.>}}

Then more workers came. They were naive like me. He bound them all to oaths to keep them in his service.

At first, I didn't consider what this meant for them. I was so preoccupied with my own survival.

But it's been so long, and there's been so many he's mistreated...

<Xy'nell sighs.>

{{gossip|<Continue to listen.>}}

Eventually I realized I was responsible for them. I was the first to swear an oath and give him that power over me. I let him continue to treat me that way. I let him treat others that way.

It was hard not to let this guilt consume me. And then when I heard of the impending audit, it was hard to not fall back into my fearful habits.

But we did it. Didn't we? He'll be imprisoned or watched. That will be it, right?

{{gossip|We stopped him. He's finished.}}

Good. Good.

<Xy'nell's shoulders relax.>

It feels like a lifetime of anxiety is still trapped inside me. Maybe it has been that long.

Thank you, <name>. I couldn't have done this alone.}}
