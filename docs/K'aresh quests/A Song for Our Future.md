'''A Song for Our Future''' concludes the final chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]], and that of the [[The War Within campaign]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Soul-Scribe.jpg|Soul-Scribe|Notorious leader of the Wastelanders. Her guilt for not being able to restore K'aresh is only matched by her hatred of Ve'nari's attempt at redemption and the eco-dome project.}}
Defeat [[Soul-Scribe (tactics)|Soul-Scribe]] within [[Eco-Dome Al'dani|Eco-Dome: Al'dani]].
*Soul-Scribe defeated
*Talk to Ve'nari

==Description==
There is a site, Eco-Dome: Al'dani, which I have kept hidden. It is built on the remains of one of our most sacred places with a powerful connection to K'aresh. It is the site of our greatest triumph of the project. This is the place where we can take the [[Worldsoul]]'s essence so it can survive.

This is also the eco-dome where Soul-Scribe and her Wastelanders are attacking.

Clear the way for me one last time, <name>. For K'aresh to survive, we need both the dome and Soul-Scribe intact.

==Rewards==
You will learn how to create:
* {{abilities|The Fate of the Devoured|Unlocks [[Campsites|Warband Campsite]] The Fate of the Devoured.}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
What transpired here will echo for years to come. The change will not happen within a day, a week, or even months. But with hope rekindled, we will get there, and we will be united once again.

You have saved us all, champion.

Speak with Ve'nari:
{{dialogue|I pity Soul-Scribe. It did not have to happen this way.

But.

I will not let anything stand in the way of my goals, not even the former high oracle of K'aresh.

:''Ve'nari shows the Soul-Scribe the world-soul's remains and give the adventurer the satchel.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Ve'nari|Before you fought for the [[Nexus-King Salhadaar|Nexus-King]], you were an oracle of K'aresh.}}

:{{Text|Bossemote|Soul-Scribe|My life for K'aresh.}}
:''She brings the Tabiqa dagger to Ve'nari and Ve'nari uses it to cut the Soul-Scribe's ribbons and now she's an energy walking to K'aresh and the watered sands form a pentagon around Ve'nari, Soul-Scribe, K'aresh and the Adventurer. The Soul-Scribe head to the soul of K'aresh and merges with it. The sands shoot the laser beam at the soul as Ve'nari and the Adventurer looks at it. The Soul crashes to the ground effecting the entire eco-dome. The Adventurer turns to see Thorntails, and Slatebacks appearing. The K'arrocs appear as well.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Ve'nari|Petals and pollen, K'aresh is reborn anew.}}

After completing the quest, Ve'nari has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|Look at us and see yourself. <Name>. Learn from our mistakes, our trials, our errors.

There is a long way ahead for my people. but I hope it will give you strength knowing that whatever happens--there is always hope.

I will come to your aid when time comes, that is my... no... our debt to you.

Now go, save your Azeroth.
