==Objectives==
Collect 5 Corrupted Sap.
*[[Corrupted Sap]] (5)

==Description==
Ah, yes, I've seen what you are describing!

The sap from the corrupted plants is tainted with void energy. Collect several samples of the sap as you can, and I will combine it to make a Large Sticky Mass.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Large Sticky Voidmass]]

==Progress==
Have you found the sap?

==Completion==
Anything that eradicates the corrupted plants helps our efforts here.

==Notes==
You will need to attack the [[Void-Tainted Growth]] to spawn [[Void Residue]] and [[Void Mass]]. The Void Residues / Masses drop the Corrupted Sap. The Void-Tainted Growth can be attacked by normal means, including AoE. Neither the Void Residue / Mass spawn rates from the Void-Tainted Growth nor the Corrupted Sap drop rates from the Residue are particularly high. Void Masses appear to have a 100% drop rate.

==Progression==
{{A Key Threat}}
