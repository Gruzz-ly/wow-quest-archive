==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Zagithav.jpg|Zagithav the Essence Gorger|Drawn to K'aresh by the lure of coalesced void energies, Zagithav the Essence Gorger hunts for his next meal.}}
Place the coalesced [[void]] energy in the [[Castigaar|Castigar]]{{sic}}.
* [[Coalesced Void Energy|Coalesced void energy]] placed (Optional)
* [[Zagithav]] slain
* Talk to [[Soul-Scribe]]
* [[Lash'ir]] slain
* [[Coalesced Void Energy]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Wastelanders]] have made camp in the ruins of old [[K'aresh]]. A sanctuary from the ravenous beasts of the Void that stalk the wastes of K'aresh. A bulwark against outsiders.

If a hostile entity were to enter their camp, you could defeat it--then they would respect you. Take the void energy you gathered into the ruined tower north of here. Be ready!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You are not welcome here, stranger.

==Completion==
Dimensius destroyed K'aresh. Here in the wastes of Merciless K'aresh, we mete out punishment for all who failed him. You say your oaths align with ours? Let us talk.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|We need to talk to their leader. Nothing attracts leaders like a crisis. Let's go cause one, and then solve it.}}

Head to the Castigar and either aggro Zagithav or interact with the [[Coalesced Void Energy]] to summon him.

:{{Text|Say|Zagithav|Consume.}}
:''[[Lash'ir]] appears.''
:{{Text|Say|Lash'ir|A Void abberration{{sic}}! Kill it.}}

;Upon slaying it
:{{Text|Say|Lash'ir|You fought well. I won't kill you for your trespass--yet. Follow me.}}
:''[[Soul-Scribe]] appears with [[Narathe]] & [[Jayaan]]''
:{{Text|Say|Soul-Scribe|This stranger is an ally of the [[Ravel]]! Why does their soul remain tethered?}}
:{{Text|Say|Narathe|They fought the Void. We should hear their words before execution.}}

Speak to the Soul-Scribe:
{{Dialogue|You are the one who has been seen in the company of the betrayer, [[Locus-Walker]]. The only reason you're not untethered is that my scouts have seen you reducing the number of enemies we face.

You disposed of Zagithav, so I will allow you to flee. If you leave now.

{{gossip|quest=|<Play Movie> We're here seeking allies.}}

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|Real-time cutscene]] "Monster and Wastelanders" starts:
{{#ev:youtube|pE7liYvsH38}}
:''Lash'ir, Narathe, and Jayaan with weapons drawn, causing the [[adventurer]] to back-step.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|We know you serve the Ravel, intruder.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|And we swore to [[Nexus-King Salhadaar|King Salhadaar]] that we would slay all of their minions.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Then it's fortunate he's [[Nexus-King Salhadaar (quest)|dead]].}}
:''The Wastelanders stop.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|That voice...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|The Harbinger!}}
:''Xal'atath appears behind the Soul-Scribe as she turns towards the Harbinger. The Soul-Scribe prepares to battle her.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|There's no need for that.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Not when we seek to end [[Dimensius]] for good.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Though we will require the [[Reshii Ribbons]] you took from the [[Om'bera|Ravel corpses]].}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|No! They used those accursed ribbons to destroy our world!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|We were powerless to stop them.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|But we will fulfill our oath to kill them!}}
:''The Harbinger comes towards the Soul-Scribe.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|And your failure will yet remain.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|This broken world is not yet finished...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|But it will be if the All-Devouring returns.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Help me annihilate Dimensius.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|The Ravel can always come next.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|We will hear you out.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Soul-Scribe|For now.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, [[Lash'ir]], [[Xal'atath]], [[Soul-Scribe]], [[Narathe]], and [[Jayaan]] are present. Some of them have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Xal'atath|The Wastelanders are so deliciously bloodthirsty. I admire how straightforward their tactics are.

We need a more delicate approach to winning them over, however. We need both the Reshii Ribbons they hold and the support of their warriors for the coming battle with Dimensius.

But first, let's move somewhere with less distractions.}}

{{dialogue|title=Soul-Scribe|Pretty promises, but I am not convinced.}}
