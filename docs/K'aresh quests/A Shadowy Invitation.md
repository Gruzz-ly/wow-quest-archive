'''A Shadowy Invitation''' begins the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] added in [[patch 11.2.0]]. This quest will be pushed to level {{level|tww-max}} players automatically on login. After the season, start by finding [[Alleria Windrunner]] in the [[Foundation Hall]] of [[Dornogal]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Locus-Walker]] at the [[Foundation Hall]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Description==
<Name>,

I've received word from my mentor, Locus-Walker. He warns of a [[Shadowguard]] plot that requires our aid. I wonder if he has finally tracked down [[Xal'atath]].

Come to the Foundation Hall in Dornogal. We must speak immediately.

==Rewards==
The end of this quest line rewards:
* {{abilities|The Fate of the Devoured|Unlocks the [[Campsites|Warband Campsite]] The Fate of the Devoured.|id=1243062|icon=inv_112_achievement_zone_karesh}}

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 XP

==Completion==
The Shadowguard will stop at nothing to revive the Void Lord, Dimensius. And we should be concerned--my home was sundered by the monster. It is no mystery on how things will end if it is not stopped.

However, I have been working on a plan... a contingency really, and it is now time to put it into motion.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|<Name>! Locus-Walker has called for our aid against the Void. My hunt for Xal'atath draws to an end.}}

On approach in Dornogal:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|You want us to abandon our hunt for Xal'atath?}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Walker|[[Dimensius the All-Devouring]] is being revived by the Shadowguard. I need your help.}}

Speak with Locus-Walker:
{{dialogue|I'm glad you are here. I will need your help, as well as Alleria's.
