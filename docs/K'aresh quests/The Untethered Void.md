==Objectives==
Interact with the [[Phase Conduit]] while wearing the [[Reshii Wraps]].
*[[Untethered Space]] entered
*Return to Normal Space

==Description==
The Reshii Wraps that [[Xal'atath|the Harbinger]] gave you allow you to briefly transform into energy and fall into Untethered Space. This is a nightmare for all [[ethereal]]s--a natural result of losing our wraps and radiating away our energy. 

We can control the process by properly attuning with the Phase Conduit, letting us visit this sub-realm and return intact. That is the theory. We have tested it with [[K'aresh]]i Phase Divers, but not with one of your kind.

Are you willing to risk the journey to Untethered Space?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Untethered Space is beautiful to visit, but dangerous for those that are trapped there.

==Completion==
You learn quickly. Good. Untethered Space devours the foolish and unwise.

==Notes==
The [[Phase Conduit]] is on the ground just in front of [[Shad'anis]] and [[Hashim]] at [[Overlook Zo'Shuul]]. Interact with it to change phases:
:{{text|say|Shad'anis|That didn't hurt, I hope. Now, interact with the conduit to leave Untethered Space.}}

Use the {{abilities|Exit Phase Diving|id=1250255}} extra action button or click off the buff to leave the phase.

==Progression==
{{Diving Into Phase Diving}}
