The people are still out there, <name>!

Good. We made a difference here!

==Notes==
Alleria has gossip upon accepting [[Barriers to Entry]], [[Heroes Among Shadow]] and [[Sealing the Shadows]]:
{{dialogue|Yes? Have something on your mind?}}

;Upon rescuing the first [[Tazavesh Civilian]]
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|This must be [[Xal'atath]]! She provokes panic to hide her steps, just as she did in [[Dalaran]].}}

Alleria comments upon rescuing the Civilians:
*{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Quickly, to safety! We will hold them off!}}
*{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Hurry, find shelter! We won't let them harm you!}}
*{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Go quickly, we'll protect you!}}
*{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Find cover. We'll deal with the threat!}}
*{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Hurry. We'll keep you safe!}}
*{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Go! We'll keep the Shadowguard at bay!}}

The Tazavesh Civilian's response will vary:
*{{text|emote|The civilian gives a flick of their fingers, acknowledging the command and giving thanks.}}
*{{text|emote|The civilian gives a shaky nod.}}
*{{text|emote|They press their palms together in a slow, deliberate gesture of gratitude.}}
*{{Text|emote|The civilian gives a slow nod of acknowledgment.}}
*{{Text|emote|The civilian quickly glances around before nodding their head.}}
*{{Text|emote|They take a shaky step forward, then quickly retreat, still unsure if it's truly safe.}}

;Upon rescuing the fourth Tazavesh Civilian
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I believed the Shadowguard worked for Xal'atath, despite the [[Marin Noggenfogger|goblin]]'s rumors.}}

;Upon rescuing the last Tazavesh civilian
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Maybe [[Locus-Walker]] is right. Xal'atath isn't behind this... she's somewhere, scheming.}}
