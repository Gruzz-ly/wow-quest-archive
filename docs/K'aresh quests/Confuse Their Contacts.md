==Objectives==
Speak with market vendors in [[Tazavesh]].
* Disguise assumed
* Traders informed (5)
* [[Broker Disguise Pin]] (provided)

==Description==
When our imports are delayed or lost, the most direct impact is on Tazavesh businesses.

Take this illusion pin. It will make you appear as a Xy Imports employee. Tell the businesses their shipments are delayed indefinitely.

My boss cannot ignore downstream pressure forever.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
This is not the first time the market vendors have dealt with my boss's failings. I only hope it is the last.

==Completion==
<Xy'nell's voice is rough.>

We will soon resolve their worries. Better a temporary strain than an eternal, constant stress.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests:
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|This is only temporary. Temporary. With some rest, my coworkers will be ready to tackle the backlog of work with new vigor.}}
:{{text|say|Associate Xy'nell|And there will be no more Coordinator Xy'thir bearing down on them.}}
:{{text|emote|Associate Xy'nell shifts uncomfortably.}}

Head northwest to the marked quest area and use the provided [[Broker Disguise Pin]]. From north to south:

You. You're from Xy Imports, aren't you? Where is my shipment? It is several hours late!

:{{text|say|Trader Ba'ford|Delayed indefinitely? Where am I supposed to get anima from now? You've made yourself the only affordable source!}}

{{dialogue|title=Trader Ba'var|
Have you news of my shipment? My customers are expecting goods, but I am unable to finish my work without that anima.

{{gossip|quest=|Xy Imports offers their regrets. Your shipment of anima has been delayed indefinitely.}}}}
:{{text|say|Trader Ba'var|What do you mean, "indefinitely?" I cannot "indefinitely" pause my work!}}

{{dialogue|title=Trader Ba'ro|
I sense you come bearing ill news, associate. Speak.

:{{text|say|Trader Ba'ro|Coordinator Xy'thir continues to disappoint. A dreadful temper and frequently late shipments.}}

{{dialogue|title=Trader Ba'solt|
Tell me you have my shipment, associate. Your boss assured me I would never have a late shipment again, but it seems my trust was misplaced.

{{gossip|quest=|Xy Imports offers their regrets. Your shipment of anima has been delayed indefinitely.}}}}
:{{text|say|Trader Ba'solt|What a grave insult! To think Coordinator Xy'thir would make such grand overtures only to fail me yet again.}}

{{dialogue|title=Trader Ba'mert|
Anima! Do you have it? What has happened to my shipment?

{{gossip|quest=|Xy Imports offers their regrets. Your shipment of anima has been delayed indefinitely.}}}}
:{{text|say|Trader Ba'mert|Indefinitely! Indefinitely! Well, I am definitely your client and you have definitely failed to deliver! Again!}}
