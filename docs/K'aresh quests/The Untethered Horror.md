'''The Untethered Horror''' concludes the [[Phase Diving]] introduction quest series. Completing this quest is required to unlock the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign|campaign skip]] for alts. To begin, complete the campaign through chapter three ([[The Tabiqa]]), equip the [[Reshii Wraps]], and speak with [[Shad'anis]] at the [[Oasis]] to start [[Another World]].

==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Netherdeath.jpg|Netherdeath|According to Shad'anis, this cosmic ray that exists within Untethered Space hunts everyone who falls through the cracks. It is vicious, brutal, and has an unquenchable thirst for Reshii energies.}}
Slay [[Netherdeath]] in [[Untethered Space]].
* Netherdeath slain within Untethered Space

==Description==
[[Void]] predators that have recently invaded Untethered Space are a mere annoyance compared to the ancient creatures that traveled here long ago. These primal predators feed on the energies of the remnants of old [[K'aresh]], as well as the unfortunate K'areshi who have fallen into this state of being.

There is one such creature we call Netherdeath that haunts this rock. We have only been able to drive it away. Perhaps you have the skill to end its reign of terror?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}

==Progress==
Have you rid Untethered Space of this predator?

==Completion==
Netherdeath is no more. Our exploration of Untethered Space can proceed. I knew you were the right person to help us in our endeavors, <name>.

We would be honored if you would continue to work with us in our exploration.

==Notes==
Drop back out of phase and head southwest to find [[Netherdeath]] feasting on the corpses of [[Untethered Observer]]s and [[Phase Diver]]s. Defeat it and return once more.

Completing this quest awards the [[Become a Hero. Become a Phasediver!]] achievement and unlocks flight points in [[Untethered Space]].
