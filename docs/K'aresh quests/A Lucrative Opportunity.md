'''A Lucrative Opportunity''' begins the optional "Lost and Found Storage" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]]. Find [[Vaultkeeper Xy'vez]] in [[Astral Getaways]] in northeastern Tazavesh to begin. This chapter awards 350 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]] and Explorer 1 gloves.

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Cartel Boss Xy'eolm]] in [[Tazavesh]] on [[K'aresh]].

==Description==
Most fortuitous greetings, offworlder!

I have been stuck for an eon at this post checking manifests one after another. This is not real trade. Real trade is done on the streets of Tazavesh!

It just so happens that a contact of mine from [[Azeroth|your world]] was unloading waste cargo. I bought the whole supply. Expired storage contracts of some sort. However, I know better than to be trading without a permit.

It would bring good fortune to my endeavor to have your help with this. Can I count on you, <race>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Xy'vez sent you? That little scoundrel can't even face me himself. Ha!

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{Text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|Outlander! I have need of your services.}}

On accept:
:''Vaultkeeper Xy'vez teleports out of the counter and leaves the room.''
:{{Text|say|Vaultkeeper Xy'vez|You secure the permit. I will secure the merchandise!}}

Head outside to the north to find Xy'eolm outside on the roof.

==Progression==
