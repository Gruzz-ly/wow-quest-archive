:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I... I'm not sure what to say.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|[[Locus-Walker]] was my mentor, my comrade, my friend.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Since I first embraced the power of the Void, he was there helping me to control and understand it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|He alone supported me when my allies and family pushed me away. He saw what mattered in people, for good or ill.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|He--He was my dearest friend. But when he died...}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|His past with the Ravel, the secrets of his ancient fight against Dimensius... I was so angry at him.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I warned him! I did nothing but warn him about the path we walked down with [[Xal'atath]]. He wouldn't listen.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|She killed him because he trusted her. Because he understood who she really was.}}
:''Ve'nari walks up.''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|So this is my oath. I will hunt Xal'atath down. I will find justice for Locus-Walker.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I will prevent her from becoming the new All-Devouring.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ve'nari|Alleria, to make an oath on K'aresh is no small thing. Are you prepared to take on such a vendetta?}}

{{dialogue|Just when I thought that things were getting better. I have been notified of a large scale attack on one of the eco-dome's alpha sites. The Wasterlanders, lead by Soul-Scribe, are attacking my domes. There is not much I can do about it at the moment, as my resources have been stretched thin.
