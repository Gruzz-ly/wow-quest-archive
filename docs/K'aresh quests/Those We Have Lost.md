'''Those We Have Lost''' begins the optional "Chasing Echoes" chapter of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] alongside [[Extended Reach]]. Find [[Om'dalan]] at the [[Ruins of Yaathron]] to begin. This chapter awards Explorer 1 necks and 350 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]].

==Objectives==
Collect Flickering Essence.
*[[Flickering Essence]] (6)

==Description==
Ah, [[adventurer|traveler]]! This was one of the first locations to show a response to our attempts to rejuvenate the land. We're actively studying why it happened at this location in particular.

I have another experiment I wish to run, but I need some extra sources of power. The souls that litter the dunes are unfortunately lost, but we may let them serve one last time by using their energy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
How did the collecting go?

==Completion==
Ah, yes. This should be enough to cover what we need for my next step.

==Notes and trivia==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Om'dalan|Stranger! I could use your assistance if you have the time!}}

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Om'dalan|I will meet you near the back of these ruins when you are finished out in the wastes.}}

The three [[Nether Reader]] pylons are marked on the minimap, and kill [[Entropic Soul]]s and [[Hollow Reflection]]s in the area for their [[Flickering Essence]].

This quest, as well as the final quest in the series, is a reference to the phrase "For those we have lost. For those we can yet save." from ''{{wp|Final Fantasy XIV}}''.
