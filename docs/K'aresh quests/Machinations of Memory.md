==Objectives==
Interact with the console.
*[[Console Battery]] (4)

==Description==
Well, the readings aren't anything to be concerned about...

So we'll move on to the next step of my experiment. This console here is the central piece of our system to rejuvenate the area. I'm hoping that if we hook it up to a significant charge, it may stabilize the area even more. Could you help me set up the energy containers as I adjust the machine?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Fascinating! It worked!

We'll need to run some immediate tests.

==Notes==
On accept, [[Om'dalan]] walks to the console and four ghost Console Batteries appear. Place them all:
:{{text|say|Om'dalan|This should be enough energy to increase the charge on the console, if only for a brief period of time. Hopefully that time is all we need.}}
:{{text|say|Om'dalan|In a past age, this was a research station for local fauna. We both preserved and mended creatures at risk of dying out.}}
:{{text|say|Om'dalan|I doubt anyone could have expected it to come in such a way.}}

Place the fourth and the screen whites out for a moment.
