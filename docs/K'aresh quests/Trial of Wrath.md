==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Vraxik.png|Vraxik|An excessively large observer that wreaked havoc beyond K'aresh.}}
Kill Vraxik, the Dimensional Wanderer.
* [[Vraxik]] slain

==Description==
Cutting through scores of lesser foes is a simple task for any [[demon hunter]]. It's when we face a large, singular threat that our skills are truly tested.

That will be [[Leona Darkstrider|Leona]]'s trial. You will act as her second.

Let us see how she vanquishes a particularly dangerous opponent.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 1,815 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
The same fire I see in Leona is what brought me where I am today.

She fights well. But more importantly, she knows what she fights to protect.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|You fight well, but it is time to demonstrate your skills against a greater threat.}}
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|I will not rest until I feel the blood of my prey on my hands.}}

Upon confronting Vraxik
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|Face the wrath of the ren'dorei!}}
:{{Text|Say|Vraxik|You cannot take vengeance on the Void itself!}}


Upon depleting Vraxik's health,
:{{Text|Yell|Leona Darkstrider|Release them!}}

Upon slaying Vraxik,
:{{Text|Say|Vraxik|The void... is endless...}}
:''Allari appear.''
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|You fight with impressive ferocity, Leona.}}
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|I see now that ren'dorei strength against the void in unmatched.}}
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|Thank you, Allari. Let us discuss back at [[Shan'dorah]].}}

Head back to [[Shan'dorah]] where Allari and Leona are with [[Magister Umbric]].

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|Leona has shown me your people are uniquely capable against the horrors of the void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|I would be honored to train any worthy ren'dorei in becoming demon hunters to take on the threats we face.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|My people would be grateful for the knowledge you offer.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|In turn, we will share our knowledge of the void with the [[Illidari]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|I look forward to working with you, Allari.}}
