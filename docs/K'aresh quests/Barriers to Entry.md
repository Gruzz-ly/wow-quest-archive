==Objectives==
Place 8 Barrier Projectors around [[Tazavesh]].
*[[Barrier Projector (K'aresh)|Barrier Projector]] placed (8)

==Description==
Those barrier projectors we recovered? We need them now. Place them at key points to reinforce the city shield and block more portals from forming.

Move swiftly, <name>. This may be our only chance to stop the [[Shadowguard]] from flooding in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*15 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Did you place the barrier projectors? We need to slow down the invasion. Quickly!

==Completion==
Well done. The shield around the city looks stronger already. 

That should buy us some time against the Shadowguard.
