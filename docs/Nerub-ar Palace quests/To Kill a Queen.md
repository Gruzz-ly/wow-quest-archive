'''To Kill a Queen''' concludes the [[Nerub-ar Palace]] storyline. To begin this quest chain, find [[Webster]] near the portal to [[Azj-Kahet]] in [[Dornogal]] after completing the whole [[The War Within (achievement)]] campaign on the first character, or just the first chapter on alts.

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Queen Ansurek.jpg|Queen Ansurek|Queen Ansurek's rule is a dark stain on the history of Azj-Kahet. Her rule has been marked with a tightening grasp of the populace and an uneasy alliance with Xal'atath. She grows increasingly paranoid and sequestered herself in Nerub-ar Palace.}}
Kill Queen Ansurek.
* [[Queen Ansurek (tactics)|Queen Ansurek]] slain
* Enter Nerub-ar Palace in [[Story Mode]] (Optional) {{co|31.5|64.0|City of Threads}}

==Description==
Tightening her grip on the citizens is something I expected of the Queen but forcefully ascending the population of the [[Burrows]] is too far. 

Queen Ansurek has fallen far greater than I ever expected. I can't sit idly by and watch her lead our people to ruin.

The time is now. We must kill Queen Ansurek and lead the people to a brighter future. Otherwise who knows how far she will fall.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Enchanted Runed Harbinger Crest]]
* [[Void-Touched Valorstone]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* {{cost|1404}}
* 23,250 [[XP]]
* +2,500 reputation with [[Vizier (faction)|The Vizier]] (or 370 [[Kej]])

==Progress==
It fills me with sorrow that it has come to this.

==Completion==
I take no pleasure in regicide but it had to be done.

==Notes==
If the full [[Nerub-ar Palace]] raid isn't in the cards, speak with [[Kriz the "Loyal"]] at {{co|31.5|64.0|City of Threads}} near the raid entrance in the [[City of Threads]] to enter the raid in [[Story Mode]]:

{{dialogue|title=Kriz the "Loyal"|The Vizier sent word that you need to be smuggled into Nerub-ar Palace. Don't worry, he already paid up front.

I'll get you right in. The squeeze is a bit tight and I hope you don't mind a little dirt.

After zoning in, players are at the [[Crown of Shadows]], [[Queen Ansurek (tactics)|Queen Ansurek's]] encounter arena:
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|Everyone get your buffs on.}}
:{{text|say|Meredy Huntswell|A mage table for all your summoned food needs.}}

Run across the bridge:
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|I must thank you for exposing the rot within my court.}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|None of them were worthy of Ascension.}}

Engage her and the two tanks will charge in:

:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|You will not stop the Ascension of my empire.}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|Food for the empire.}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|Vile surge!}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|Nerubian might is unmatched.}}

At 60%, Ansurek will go immune and summon a few waves of adds:
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|Subjects of the empire, prove your loyalty.}}
:{{text|yell|Chamber Guardian|My life for the empire!}}
:{{text|yell|Ascended Voidspeaker|Lead us to Ascension!}}

After the voidspeaker dies, it leaves behind a portal:
:{{text|say|Henry Garrick|Use the portal to ascend.}}

Upstairs, the encounter continues:
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|How have my soldiers failed?}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|This entire generation of nerubians is tainted. Unworthy of Ascension.}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|They are food for my transformation!}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|Off with your head!}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|Feed your queen.}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|Cosmic collapse!}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|Your essence is mine!}}
:{{text|yell|Queen Ansurek|Your corpse on a pike!}}

Finish her off and [[The War Within in-game cinematics|two in-engine cutscenes]] play back-to-back:
{{#ev:youtube|qIL3uV_X8tM|Post Ansurek cutscenes}}

''Interior, the Crown of Shadows. Back-stepping, Ansurek loses her footing and falls into the hole in the center of the arena, landing on the camera. After a fade from black, we see from Ansurek's eyes, looking at her outstretched hands, trying to catch her breath.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Slender is the strand that guides your destiny...}}

''Ansurek keeps trying to push herself up with her forearms but fails.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|So easily overlooked, yet cutting deeper than the sharpest blade.}}

''Xal'atath stands just behind Ansurek's left. Wincing, Ansurek turns to look at her, but Xal'atath disappears.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Shhhh. It's almost over.}}

''A wide-angle shot shows Ansurek by herself, then a closeup show Xal'atath behind Ansurek's right this time. Xal'atath clasps her palms together as she floats around Ansurek. Ansurek is still trying and failing to get to her feet. Xal'atath just smirks as she looks on.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Your ambition was rare, you know. Yet despite even betraying your own mother, here you are.}}

''In front of Ansurek, Xal'atath floats down to the ground.''

{{text|bossemote|Queen Ansurek|You - promised...}}

''Ansurek desperately reaches out her left arm toward Xal'atath's right leg.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Nothing. Yet, I gave you everything. You were just... not...enough.}}

''Xal'atath walks away.''

{{text|bossemote|Queen Ansurek|Don't you...pity me..!}}

''On her forearms, Ansurek looks up at Xal'atath's receding form. Xal'atath does not deign to look back.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|I don't. You were a means to an end. Your survival wasn't necessary. I simply wish you had lasted a little longer.}}

''Ansurek gives up attempting to rise and lays on her left side. Xal'atath walks up from behind.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|And now you learn the true lesson of the Void... Only the strongest survive.}}

''Xal'atath turns to leave. Ansurek groans and breathes her last as Xal'atath fades into the shadows.''

After the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Finally, this madness is over.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|You have spared our people a dark fate, overcrawler.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|The truth of our alliance must remain hidden for now, but you have our gratitude.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|While the queen's plot has ended, I fear something worse looms in the shadows.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Only time will reveal if we hindered this unseen force, or played into its hands.}}

[[Widow Arak'nai]] has gossip:
{{dialogue|We are in your debt, <name>.

{{gossip|Please grant me passage out of the palace. <Leave Nerub-ar Palace>}}}}

Ansurek drops no loot in Story Mode.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Queen Ansurek is dead. With her tyranny ended I can only hope for a better future.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Who will lead us now? Is freedom worth the loss of stability? Perhaps questions suited for another day.}}
