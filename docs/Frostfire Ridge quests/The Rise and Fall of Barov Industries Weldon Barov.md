'''The Rise and Fall of Barov Industries: Weldon Barov''' can only be triggered when your [[garrison]] has a [[Lumber Mill (garrison)|Lumber Mill]].  It starts by finding a Fallen Tree at one of its spawn points in {{Au|Draenor}} and freeing [[Weldon Barov]].

== Completion ==
"The brothers united once more," [[Alexi Barov|he]] said.

"A [[Draenor (alternate universe)|world]] full of untold riches to plunder," he said.

"Wealth beyond imaging," he said!

And then he proceeded to drop a log on top of me.

"There can only be one CEO of [[Barov Industries]]," he said.

At least we can agree on that...

== Rewards ==
You will learn: Follower: [[Weldon Barov]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|77|60}}
* 27,380 [[XP]]

== Notes ==
If you take too long to finish the quest, Weldon will despawn and you'll have to find another Fallen Tree.

;On quest completion
:''Weldon walks away.''
