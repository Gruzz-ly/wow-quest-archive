== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Warmaster Zog]] at [[Frostwall|your Garrison]] in [[Frostfire Ridge]].

== Description ==
Drek'Thar will be fine, once he adjusts. The vision the elemental has bestowed upon him is powerful, and he is on the path of becoming this world's greatest shaman.

You may wish to inform Warmaster Zog in your garrison of what has transpired here.

He should be able to deploy some of your troops to the area to further secure the area.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|22}}
* 1400 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Completion ==
Well done, commander. I shall see what forces we can dispatch to the area for further clean-up.

== Notes ==
Use your [[Garrison Hearthstone]] for faster travel. It is possible to exit the First Anvil to the southwest and jump along the cliffs down to the ground without taking much fall damage. Much less painful than running back through the [[Magnarok]]. On the plains, run west to [[Darkspear's Edge]] and fly back, or run south to [[Frostwall]] and the garrison to turn in to Warmaster Zog.

==Trivia==
This quest's name is most likely a reference to the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, where "''Ours Is The Fury''" is the motto of House Baratheon.
