Ride with {{Au|Durotan}}
*Ride with Durotan {{co|48.7|65.3|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
The return of many of my people is a boon to us, and I thank you for your part in their survival.

Come with me. We have much to discuss.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|8|60}}
* 10250 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
This land should serve our needs well. I leave it to you to decide how best to use it, commander.

==Notes==
On accept, the assembled all mount up and move at slightly slower than epic ground mount speed as they Drek'Thar and Durotan talk:
:{{text|say|[[Farseer Drek'Thar]]|These are champions from a faraway realm, pledged to fight the [[Iron Horde]].}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|I know your eyes don't work, [[shaman]], but [[Thrall|this one]] has green skin.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|I do not need eyes to see it; they are noble of heart. They saved our kin -- including {{Au|Ga'nar|your brother}}.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|Very well, strangers. You have earned the trust of our shaman. I will not turn away your help.}}

Turn in to Thrall.
