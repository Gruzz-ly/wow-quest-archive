== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Warmaster Zog]].

== Description ==
So the new warchief decided to send you [[Warmaster Zog]] to handle local operations. Zog!

I heard that guy was notorious for organizing the [[Alliance]] AND the [[Horde]] to face off against the [[silithid]] at the [[Gates of Ahn'Qiraj]].

He was [[General Zog|a general]] back then.

Anyway, if you go let him know about the barracks being done I'm sure he'll have some thoughts on how to put it to good use.

You can find Zog up at the town hall.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
* 1350 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
Commander, it is an honor to serve you.

;Description
So the new warchief decided to send you [[High Overlord Saurfang]] to handle local operations. Saurfang! I heard that guy was notorious for taking out armies of like... forty Alliance soldiers at a time.

Anyway, if you go let him know about the barracks being done I'm sure he'll have some thoughts on how to put it to good use.

You can find Saurfang up at the town hall.
