==Objectives==
Hear [[Cordana Felsong]]'s Tale.
*Hear Cordana Felsong's tale

==Description==
Being a human and a night elf, [[Khadgar|the archmage]] and I aren't likely to be well-received by the orcs of the [[Frostwolf clan]].

We need you to make an introduction for us with the [[Throm'var]] farseer.

There is much to discuss. Shall I bring you up to speed on the way to the village?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|85}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You honor us with your presence.

==Completion==
Wolf-<brother/sister>, already word has traveled to us of your actions at Wor'gol. You have the eternal respect of the Frostwolf.

Now, who are these strangers that you have brought to us and what is this urgent matter?

==Notes==
While exploring north of the eastern end of [[Daggermaw Ravine]], players may come across [[Cordana Felsong]] stealthed by a volcano. Though a night elf, she is friendly to the Horde and offers this quest.
