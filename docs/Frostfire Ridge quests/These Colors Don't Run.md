==Description==
{{Au|Bladespire clan|Bladespire}} has been a plague on my people for many years.

That ends today!

Now to explain it to the [[ogre]]s in a way they will understand.

If you still wish to help us, place our banner in the corpses of our adversaries.

Their courage will falter as they behold a field of [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolf]] trophies!

This is our way. I will meet with you ahead when you have completed this deed.

You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Yes?

On accept:
:{{text|yell|Durotan|I will ride ahead. Frostwolves, hold the tower. Igrimar, with me!}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I will forestall any counterattacks by the enemy. Lok'tar ogar!}}
This is a target-rich area, full of [[Bladespire Brute|brutes]], [[Bladespire Boarbuster|boarbusters]], and [[Bladespire Mauler|maulers]]. Along the way, Thrall has a little script event:
:{{text|yell|Thrall|Stand back!}}
:''A huge wave of ogres, boars, and ogron bear down on Thrall, but he winds up an attack to wipe them all out, before falling to his knees.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|It seems the elements do not respond to me on Draenor as they do on Azeroth...}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Go on ahead. Durotan awaits. I must catch my breath.}}
Enter the fortress and take a left to find Durotan, holding his a wounded Frostwolf orc in his arms.

==Progression==
{{Siege of Bladespire Fortress}}
