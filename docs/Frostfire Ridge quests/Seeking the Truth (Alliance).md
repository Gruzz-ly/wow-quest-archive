==Objectives==
Locate [[Borgal Doomfist]].

==Description==
Okay, now down to business.

The [[Bloodmaul clan (alternate universe)|Bloodmaul]] have unearthed some monstrous artifact I've heard them call the [[Soulgrinder]]. It's a nasty bit o' sorcery that their chief uses to give himself incredible magical power, but it comes at the cost of needing to feed upon souls to maintain it. Every day, more and more corpses pile up from the slaves killed to maintain it.

We need to go find Borgal and get rid of this Soulgrinder!

==Completion==
Secluded cave across the lava, check.

Creepy piles o' bones, check.

Okay, this looks like the place. We're gonna have to watch ourselves, I'll bet Borgal isn't here alone.

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|15|40|}}
