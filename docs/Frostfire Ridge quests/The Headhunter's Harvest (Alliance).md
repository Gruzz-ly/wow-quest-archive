==Objectives==
Recruit a follower from [[Lysa Serion]] in the [[Lunarfall Inn]].
* Recruit follower from Headhunter

==Description==
The inn provides a perfect place for adventurers to take a rest between their travels. It's also a great place to talk them into joining our cause over a few rounds of drinks.

Go through my selection and let's see if we can obtain a new recruit. I'll give you a little something as a finder's fee for your efforts.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|15|40|}}

== Progress ==
Find a recruit that you like?

==Completion==
Ahh, I'm glad you were able to find a good hire!

I'll get back to looking for more candidates for you. Check back in every week to see my latest selections.

==Notes==
Requires a Level 2 [[Town Hall (garrison)|Town Hall]] and a Level 2 Lunarfall Inn, in that order, to unlock this quest.
