==Objectives==
Mark 6 Trees.
*[[Tree Marking|Trees marked]] for [[peon]]s (6)

==Description==
Alright, boss. We're gonna need some [[lumber]] if we're gonna get [[Frostwall|this garrison]] started off right.

If you mark some trees to be cut down, your peons will do the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There aren't a lot of trees around. Go mark 'em!

==Completion==
That should be plenty of wood for now.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Gronnling Problem]] before heading out.

Look for big trees that are brighter and larger than the others in the area with ghostly flags in front of them. Interacting with the flag will immediately summon a peon who quickly chops the tree down and takes the lumber back to the garrison.

==Progression==
{{Foothold in a Savage Land}}
