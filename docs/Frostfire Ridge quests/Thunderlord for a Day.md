Build a Thunderlord Grapple.
*[[Coil of Chain]] x5
*[[Vicious Grapple]] x5

==Description==
Pieces of a Thunderlord chain lay on the ground. It is of a very simple design, but effective.

With enough parts, even the most unskilled person could assemble a chain and grapple as effective as those used by the Thunderlord Grapplers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Thunderlord Grapple]]
*{{cost|12|20}}
*13970 XP
*+250 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
This shoddy, beaten anvil is used mostly for crafting chains and what little other metal working the Thunderlord require.

==Completion==
With a quick tap of the hammer and a snip of the rings, the Thunderlord Grapple is as good as new.

==Notes==
If players get to the north end of the [[Cracking Plains]] near [[Colossal's Fall]] while killing [[Ice Fury|ice furies]] and [[Snow Lurker|snow lurkers]] for [[Frosted Fury]] and [[Lurkers]] out of [[Darkspear's Edge]], they may notice [[Gronnstalker Rokash]] and the pile of [[Broken Chains]] just outside of [[Colossal's Fall]]. Rokash starts [[Only the Winner]], and the chains start this quest.

Look on the ground nearby for coils of chains. The [[Thunderlord Grappler]]s drop a [[Vicious Grapple]] on occasion. In camp, look for a [[Thunderlord Crag-Leaper]] next to the Chaincrafter's Anvil, which will complete the quest. [[Sky-Singer Strag]] is on the raised platform at the east end of camp.

Also in camp is [[Jehil the Climber]], hiding out asleep on top of the giant's ribcage. He drops [[Jehil's Climbin' Boots]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]]. See Jehil's article for information on how to get to him.
