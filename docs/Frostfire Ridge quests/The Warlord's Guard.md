== Objectives ==
[[File:Thunk.jpg|thumb|[[Thunk]]]]
[[File:Gullok.jpg|thumb|[[Gullok]]]]
[[File:Splorg.jpg|thumb|[[Splorg]]]]

Gather the Head of [[Thunk]], the Head of [[Gullok]], and the Head of [[Splorg]].
*[[Head of Thunk]] {{co|26.9|24.9|Frostfire Ridge}}
*[[Head of Gullok]] {{co|27.9|23.5|Frostfire Ridge}}
*[[Head of Splorg]] {{co|28.5|26.2|Frostfire Ridge}}

== Description ==
I don't know what you are accustomed to, traveler, but these lands devour the weak. Perhaps [[Durotan (alternate universe)|Durotan]] wishes to rid himself of you. We shall see.

You must kill the Warlord of the Circle of Blood. Do this and the ogres here will be defeated. But first, you must find him.

I have located his bodyguards nearby. Slay them and bring me their heads. With them, we shall lure the Warlord into the open.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 512 bracers|Frostwolf Wind-Talker Cuffs|Frostwolf Scout's Armwraps|Frostwolf Ringmail Wristguards|Frostwolf Stalwart Bracers}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Progress ==
You still draw breath, hmm?

Have you dealt with the warlord's underlings?

== Completion ==
You have done well in this, but do not become proud. This land has dangers far greater than what you have seen here.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Cure]] before heading out. The three named ogres are on the east side of camp in their own buildings or the cave between them.

Also, find [[The Beater]] in a small cave south of the road. It drops [[Beater's Beat Stick]] and some [[Garrison Resources]].
