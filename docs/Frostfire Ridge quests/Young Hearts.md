==Objectives==
[[File:Orac.jpg|thumb|[[Orac]].]]
[[File:Icepaw.jpg|thumb|[[Icepaw]].]]
Find Orac and tell him to return home to [[Gog'rak|his uncle]].
*Find [[Orac]] {{co|25.4|67.6|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
My nephew never pays attention to his surroundings. In his eagerness to prove himself, he has strayed from the pack -- again.

He reminds me of myself when I was a youngling.

If you see Orac, tell him to return home. We need to finish preparing for tomorrow's hunt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Young hearts will always wonder.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I'm sure Orac will think twice before he strays from the pack again.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Gog'rak|The last time I saw Orac, he was chasing [[Icepaw]] out the southern gates of [[Wor'gol]].}}

Exit the southern entrance of [[Wor'gol]] and follow the trail to the southeast. Inside a cave, [[Orac]] and [[Icepaw]] have been captured by [[Clawtooth]], leader of the local [[saberon]] pride. Getting close to Orac will wake Clawtooth up, so kill him.

On Clawtooth's death, interact with Orac:
:{{text|say|Orac|Is he dead? I think he was saving me for later. Come on Icepaw, let's get out of here.}}

Before heading back, look down at sea level just to the northeast of the saberon den. Inside the cave at sea level is the rare elite [[Pale Fishmonger]]. It drops 10-20 [[Fire Ammonite]] and 40-50 [[Garrison Resources]].

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Orac|You should have seen it uncle! I had that filthy [[saberon]] right where I wanted him.}}
:{{text|say|Gog'rak|Is that right? Good job, Orac. You will make a fine hunter one day.}}

==Progression==
{{Defense of Wor'gol}}
