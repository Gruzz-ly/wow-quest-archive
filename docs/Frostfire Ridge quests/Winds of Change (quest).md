Rescue Olin Umberhide.
*Rescue [[Olin Umberhide]] {{co|57.3|62.9|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
Commander, I have bad news. Olin Umberhide, the tauren who escaped with you from [[Tanaan Jungle|Tanaan]], was ambushed when near the eastern perimeter of the Garrison.

He was seen being dragged off by the [[pale]]. These are dangerous, disturbing creatures that some believe were once orcs. Now they are husks of barely living flesh bent by dark magics.

Olin is resourceful, but outnumbered. I would advise travelling east to effect a rescue as soon as possible, before they eat him alive... slowly.

==Rewards==
You will gain the follower: [[Olin Umberhide]].

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 18150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found Olin? Was he alive or dead?

==Completion==
Well done Commander. Olin spoke to me of your bravery and has already offered to serve under your command.

If I may advise you in this matter, I would suggest accepting his service. We could make use of a tauren with his skill sets in a land like this.

==Notes==

Exit the garrison to the north, then cut east and head down into [[Shivering Trench]]. At the north end of the trench is a cave full of the [[pale]]. Inside the cave, hanging upside down from a rope is [[Olin Umberhide]]. Free him:
:{{text|say|Olin Umberhide|You have my thanks once again, Commander. These fiends were going to eat me alive. I will meet you back at the garrison.}}
Head back to turn in, but before doing so, look south in the trench to find rare boar [[Coldtusk]], and a quest-starting [[Icevine]] object, which begins [[The Land Provides]].

==Progression==
{{Foothold in a Savage Land}}
