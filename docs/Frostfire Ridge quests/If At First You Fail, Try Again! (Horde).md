==Objectives==
Meet Solog Roark at the dry docks and build another Destroyer. Once the Destroyer is complete, send it on a new mission.
*Build another Destroyer ship
*Complete Naval Mission: The Second Time is the Charm

==Description==
Looks like that Submarine had a bit more firepower than we thought! They used First Strike to hit us before we even saw it coming.

Losing ships is a part of naval battles, Commander. Luckily, we were prepared for this exact sort of situation. Speak with Yanas down at the dry docks, he should be able to help us quickly produce another Destroyer. Head back here when the ship is complete, we will have a new mission ready for you.

==Rewards==
*[[Oil (currency)]] (50)

That was an amazing turn around commander!  Great work.

==Notes==
The only available mission during this quest is [[The Second Time is the Charm (Horde)]].
