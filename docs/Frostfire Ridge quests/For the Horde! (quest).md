==Notes==
[[File:For the Horde complete.jpg|thumb|Backup via portal]]
A dozen or so yards in front of Thrall, a ghostly Horde Banner appears. Interact with it to plant it:
:{{text|say|Thrall|This terrain is ideal for a stronghold.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I can open up a portal to [[Orgrimmar]] only briefly. Reinforcements are standing by, I hope?}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|The very best.}}
:''Gazlowe pops out of the portal, followed by a Darkspear strike team - [[Rokhan]], [[Shadow Hunter Mala]], and [[Shadow Hunter Rala]], then [[Frostwall Peon]]s.''
:{{text|say|[[Gazlowe]]|Somebody call for a fixer?}}
:''Khadgar sighs, his tone skeptical.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|... You're entrusting a goblin to be your foreman?}}
: ''Thrall takes no umbrage, simply stating the facts.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|Gazlowe, here, oversaw the construction of Orgrimmar.}}
:{{text|say|Gazlowe|Orgrimmar! The impenetrable fortress!}}
:''Gazlowe bows as he speaks, quite proud of that bit of work. However Khadgar takes a bit out of his sails with a bemused reminder.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Wasn't it [[Siege of Orgrimmar|recently sacked?]]}}
:''Gazlowe grumbles a bit at this.''
:{{text|say|Gazlowe|Yeah yeah, okay, one little sacking.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Durotan|I am afraid I must depart and rejoin our pack at [[Wor'gol]]. Aka'Magosh.}}
