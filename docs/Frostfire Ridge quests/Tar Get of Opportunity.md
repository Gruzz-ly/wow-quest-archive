== Objectives ==
Gather 5 Globs of Sticky Tar from the [[Black Tar]]s in the [[Bones of Agurak]]
*[[Glob of Sticky Tar]] × 5

== Description ==
[[General Vul'gath]] leads this band of Thunderlord. He is a coward and hides in his hut, yelling orders at his warriors through the walls.

We will need to show him that his flimsy defenses can not stand against the Frostwolves!

I'll need some tar to carry this out. There are a couple of tar pits to the south, go gather a few globs from the oozes that reside there and bring them to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|12|20}}

== Progress ==
We need that tar soon, <name>! Get to it!

== Completion ==
Ugh, those smell awful. No, I don't need to see them. I'll take you at your word that you have them all.

Let's get a move on before another Thunderlord patrol stumbles upon me.

== Gains ==
* 13970 XP

== Notes ==
Pick up [[At the End of Your Rope]] before heading out. Don't worry about the oozes that split off the main ooze -- they will despawn when the main one dies.

==Progression==
{{Bones of Agurak}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
