==Objectives==
[[File:Slavemaster Turgall.jpg|thumb|[[Slavemaster Turgall]].]]
Get the key from [[Slavemaster Turgall]] and find Mulverick's Axes.
*[[Mulverick's Axe]] (2)
*[[Turgall's Key]] {{co|50.7|34.3|Bladespire Fortress|3}} / {{co|27.6|35.9|Frostfire Ridge}}
*Mulverick's Cage unlocked {{co|30.8|41.5|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
You were sent here to free me? It seems that makes us allies.

Slavemaster Turgall within the [[Sootstained Mines|Soostained Mines]]{{sic}} will certainly have the key to this cage.

While you're in there, do you think you could see which of those spineless taskmasters took my axes?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 514 cloaks|Wolfsfur Drape|Wolfsfur Greatcloak|Wolfsfur Cloak}}

You will also receive:
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
These ogres will be seeing the other side of my axes soon.

==Completion==
You have my sincere gratitude, <name>.

==Notes==
Enter the [[Sootstained Mines]] and quickly move clockwise around the cave to [[Turgall's Den]] in the back. Find and kill [[Slavemaster Turgall]]:
:{{text|say|Slavemaster Turgall|You've made your final mistake, foreigner. Feel the power of lava as your bones melt!}}
:{{text|say|Slavemaster Turgall|Aid me, essence of lava!}}
:''Turgall stuns the player and summons a [[Slag Elemental (Frostfire Ridge)|Slag Elemental]].''
:''Finish off Turgal''
:{{text|say|Slavemaster Turgall|My body becomes one with the volcanoes.}}
Once Turgall is dead, get out of the mine and back to Mulverick. Interact with the cage to release him.
:{{text|say|Mulverick|Thank you. I don't know if I would have survived without your help.}}
:{{text|say|Mulverick|Turgall was a cruel master. He tortured his slaves and let us starve to death!}}
:{{text|say|Mulverick|Your deds have shown you to be a fine commander. The sort of commander I would be honored to fight alongside.}}

==Progression==
{{Defense of Wor'gol}}
