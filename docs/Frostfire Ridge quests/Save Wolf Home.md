== Description ==
Cowardly Thunderlords...

During the battle for the citadel, runners informed me that the Iron Wolf is striking at our home. He'll find no easy footing there, Draka will make them pay tenfold for any of ours that they slay, but we must return quickly and chase the mongrels off.

You and your forces have proven valuable allies of the Frostwolves. We'd welcome your aid in securing our Wor'gol.

I'll see you on the battlefield if you choose to come.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|60}}
* 17290 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
There are more Thunderlord to be killed.

== Completion ==
Durotan's trust in you is well-placed, <name>. You have mine as well.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Durotan|When you see Draka... tell her that I will be home soon.}}
:{{text|emote|[[Thrall]] grins at his father's words.}}
To continue with the zone storyline and skip the optional side quests, head out to the flight master and fly back to [[Wor'gol]].

At Bladespire, there are a few side quests that can be done for additional rewards, reputation, and a follower. Speak with [[Snowrunner Rolga]] to pick up [[Mopping Up (Frostfire Ridge)]], and interact with the Bounty Board next to her for [[WANTED: Gutsmash the Destroyer]]. Further southwest is [[Guse]] with [[Slavery and Strife]], and the flight master.

Arrived at Wor'gol:
:{{text|yell|The Iron Wolf|Korhol, Zhakta, Trokar... move in from all sides. Gargrak, hold for now.}}

Wor'gol has been invaded by the Thunderlord clan! After landing, speak with Durotan to pick up [[Free Our Brothers and Sisters]]:
:{{text|yell|Durotan|Champion! It is good that you have joined us! I will hold these Thunderlord off in case any of your allies arrive.}}

Immediately southeast is the first named target, [[Giantslayer Zhakta]]. [[Gronnstalker Korhol]] is on the northwest side of the area, and [[Beastmaster Trokar]] is to the south, as well as killing the 15 Thunderlord mobs:
;Zhakta slain
:{{text|yell|The Iron Wolf|ZHAKTA NO!... you will be avenged!}}

;Korhol slain
:{{text|yell|The Iron Wolf|Dammit all. Gargrak, go now... Kill the blind shaman.}}

;Trokar slain
:{{text|yell|The Iron Wolf|Bring me that <race> <class>'s head!}}

;15 Thunderlord mobs slain
:{{text|yell|The Iron Wolf|Call in all reinforcements. I want the She-Wolf taken alive.}}

Draka shouts to help adventures out or taunt the Iron Wolf:
*{{text|yell|Draka|Reinforcements to the east.}}
*{{text|yell|Draka|Watch for Thunderlord from the ledge to the north.}}
*{{text|yell|Draka|To the south, now my brothers and sisters.}}
*{{text|yell|Draka|They can only attack us when most of our clan is away. Kill these Thunderlord cowards.}}
*{{text|yell|Draka|Watch for their warleader, Gargrak.}}
*{{text|yell|Draka|We will make Durotan proud this day!}}
*{{text|yell|Draka|Come down and face me, "Iron Wolf". I'll show you how a true wolf fights!}}
*{{text|yell|Draka|Protect the Pool of visions. Do not let them get to the Farseer.}}

==Notes==
*Initially, the quest referred to Wor'gol as War'gol until it was fixed.

==Progression==
{{Defense of Wor'gol}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Hotfix|date=2014-11-14|bluenote=Gronnstalker Korhol, Beastmaster Trokar, and Giantslayer Zhakta should now spawn more frequently. Additionally, resolved an issue where characters may be unable to complete profession quests while this quest is active.}}
