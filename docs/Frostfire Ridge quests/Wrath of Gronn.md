==Objectives==
Release 3 Captive Gronn.
*[[Captive Gronn]] released (3)

==Description==
The Thunderlord are capturing [[gronn]] for the [[Iron Horde]]. Show these fools why the gronn are NOT pets.

Follow us into the grotto, sunder the chains of the captive gronn. Let the beasts seek to gain their own vengeance against the Thunderlord.

Meet us at [[Grulloc's Lair]] beneath the grotto when you are done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13830 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
For many years I hunted all sorts of prey alongside my father. This hunt shall honor his memory as well as avenge his death at the hands of these traitorous, honorless Thunderlords.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|yell|Ga'nar|Frostwolves! Fan out and harry the Thunderlord. For vengeance!}}

Pick up [[Articles of the Fallen]] before heading out.

There are three [[Thunderlord Beastwrangler]]s holding chains on a Captive Gronn. Aggro them to get them to drop the chains and release the gronn.

Once done with three:
:{{text|yell|Kal'gor the Honorable|Hurry, <name>, Ga'nar is beneath us in the lair of Grulloc. You should join him before he kills everyone without you.}}
Enter the northwestern entrance to the cave system (the same way Ga'nar went), follow the cave north, and take a right fork that leads toward the center of the area. That area is [[Grulloc's Lair]]. {{Au|Ga'nar}} and his squad are found in the center of the area, looking upon [[Grulloc]], a boss-level gronn, held captive by orcs under [[Hatock the Gronnmaster]]'s command.

==Progression==
{{Ga'nar's Vengeance}}
