==Objectives==
[[File:Great Balls of Fire - Barricade.jpg|thumb|The Barricade.]]
Speak to [[Thrall]] in [[Bladespire Citadel]].
*Ascend the Ramp {{co|53.9|86.5|Bladespire Fortress|1}} / {{co|28.3|41.2|Frostfire Ridge}}
*Destroy the Barricade {{co|53.9|86.5|Bladespire Fortress|1}} / {{co|28.3|41.2|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
{{Au|Ga'nar}} led [[Ligra the Unyielding|Ligra]] and the others to the second level of the fortress. Your friend, [[Thrall]], also went to lend his skills.

Follow the ramp on the south end of the ramparts outside to join them.

Help them bring victory to the Frostwolf Clan!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
Many were killed or wounded on their way here.

==Notes==
Mount up and run up the ramp, dodging the fireballs. They only hit for around 8,000 health. Just past a ''wooden bridge over lava'' is an Ogre Barricade, with two grunts wailing on it. Interact with the barricade to destroy it, then keep running forward to Thrall.

==Trivia==
The quest name is a reference to the 1957 song {{wp|Great Balls of Fire}} by Jerry Lee Lewis.

==Progression==
{{Siege of Bladespire Fortress}}
