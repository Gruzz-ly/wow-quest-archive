==Objectives==
Recover 10 Fallen Frostwolf Artifacts.
*[[Fallen Frostwolf Artifact]] (10)

==Description==
Even when on a mission of vengeance we must remember to uphold the honor that is required of a member of the [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolves]].

In [[Savage Crag|the grotto]] below are the fallen corpses of many good Frostwolf [[orc]]s. They must be remembered.

While you carry out [[Wrath of Gronn|Ga'nar's task]], look for articles of our fallen brethren. Bring these articles to me so that I might pass them to a shaman for final burial as is our tradition.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Have you found the articles?

==Completion==
You have shown honor to our clan. This act shall be remembered.

==Notes==
There are plenty of artifacts on the surface. Collect them while freeing gronn, as there are none in the cave system. Turn in before heading after Ga'nar.

==Progression==
{{Ga'nar's Vengeance}}
