==Objectives==
Place Borgal's totems so that [[Orlana Strongbrow|Orlana]] can begin the ritual, then kill Borgal.
* Borgal's Totems Placed (2)
* [[Borgal Doomfist]] slain
* Ritual Complete slain

==Description==
It is time for Borgal to die.

We must travel to a location of power where I have room for the ritual. There is a ruined tower to the northwest that will be perfect for this. Meet us there and place the totems in the areas of power you will find there. Once they are placed I will do the ritual that will summon Borgal to us.

Your job will be the difficult one, kill him!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]
*[[Soulgrinder]]

==Completion==
That was one hell of a battle! Bloody fine job there la... um commander. 

Orlana really helped us out there. I'll ask around, maybe a [[priest]] can think of something we can do for her. 

At any rate, we still have this artifact to deal with. I think you better hold onto it for safe keeping before any power crazed lunatics comes looking for it.
