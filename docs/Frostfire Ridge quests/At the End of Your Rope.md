==Objectives==
Use the Barbed Harpoon to unseat and kill 5 Thunderlord Sky Riders.
*[[Thunderlord Sky Rider]] slain (5)
*[[Barbed Harpoon]] (provided)

==Description==
With the spears and rope you gathered, the Thunderlord Sky Riders will no longer be out of our reach. Even they will feel our wrath!

I've tied the rope to the spears you brought me to fashion a harpoon. Hunt the Sky Riders that are flying all over the valley. Take the Harpoon and throw it at them as they circle by. If your aim is true the barbs should allow the spear a firm hold allowing you to yank the rider right towards you!

If your aim is bad... well... try not to miss.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 XP

==Progress==
What are you doing? Get out there and kill those Sky Riders!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! The removal of the Sky Riders takes the heat off us for a bit. Keep your weapon in hand though, we're not done with them yet.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Tar Get of Opportunity]] before heading out. Look up, target a [[Thunderlord War Rylak]] and use the quest item while it's in range to snag a [[Thunderlord Sky Rider]] of its mount, then kill the rider.
