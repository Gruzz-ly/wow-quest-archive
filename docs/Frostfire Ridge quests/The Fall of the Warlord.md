== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Warlord Bult.jpg|Warlord Bult}}
Kill Warlord Bult.
*[[Warlord Bult]] slain {{co|23.4|26.1|Frostfire Ridge}}

== Description ==
You've managed to survive this long, stranger. All that remains to be done here is to fell the Warlord of the arena.

This will be your first true test here. Bult would provide a challenge to even a battle-hardened [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolf]].

Place the heads you've collected on spikes in the [[Circle of Blood (Frostfire Ridge)|Frostfire Arena]]. They are sure to enrage the warlord and lure him into battle.

Come out of the arena victorious and it will show that Durotan's trust in you was not misplaced.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 513 rings|Pit Fighter's Seal|Pit Boss Signet|Pit Skulker's Ring}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Yes, traveler?

== Completion ==
Impressive work.

== Notes ==

[[File:Spectator's Chair overview.jpg|thumb|The view from the top of the tower to the Spectator's chair]]
[[File:Arena Master's War Horn.jpg|thumb|Arena Master's War Horn]]

Before leaving the tower, take the ramp up to the top. Mount up and jump down to the structure with a beach chair on it and loot the [[Spectator's Chest]], which contains 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]], 15 [[Blackheart Grog]], and a rapidly melting [[Ice Stone (item)]]. Circle around outside the arena to the northern entrance. On the throne is the [[Arena Master's War Horn]] and another 10-20 Garrison Resources.

Finally, jump down to the arena floor to find three [[Ogre Spike]]s on the northeast side of the arena floor. Interact with it to spawn Warlord Bult:
:{{text|yell|Warlord Bult|Who challenges da hammer of Frostfire?!}}
He very quickly tosses away is original hammers and pulls out a surprise:
:{{text|say|Warlord Bult|Don't need deez no more.}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Bult|Bet you didn't know I had a fif hammer!}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Bult|I t'ink one of dose had a splinter.}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Bult|Der's more where dose came from.}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Bult|Da more hammers da better!}}
Turn back in to Snowrunner Rolga up top when done, but don't go up top if not done with the [[Slavery and Strife]] chain -- stay in the valley and do those quests first.
