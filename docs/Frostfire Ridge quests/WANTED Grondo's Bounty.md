Kill Grondo in the [[Crackling Plains]].

Suggested players [3]

==Description==
Grondo, a mad [[gronn]], has been seen roaming the [[Cracking Plains|Crackling Plains]].

This beast has been killing entire herds of [[clefthoof]] and devouring innocent frost wolves. We must destroy this threat before it reaches [[Frostwall|the Garrison.]]

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 515 trinkets|Grondo's Eyepatch|Grondo's Spare Eye|Grondo's To-Do List}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|36|30}}
*20960 XP

==Progress==
Grondo be a threat, boss-mon. A threat we should be dealin' wit' before it be gettin' here.

==Completion==
Very good. We don't be needin' a gronn bearin' down on us before we get our defenses all established.

==Notes==
*Run northeast out of [[Frostwall]] through the [[Icewind Drifts]] to reach the [[Cracking Plains]]. Find Grondo just outside [[Darkspear's Edge]]. A well-timed Call to Arms will help immensely with fighting the 3-player target.
