== Objectives ==
Free 6 Frost Wolves or [[Wor'gol Villager]]s.
*Frost Wolf or Villager freed × 6

== Description ==
These Thunderlord curs use coward's weapons like nets and chains.

Many of our villagers and wolf-brothers and sisters have been trapped.

If you free them, they will fight at your side with honor.

We must quell this attack with haste so I may return to [[Bladespire Citadel]] and continue my preparations.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
There are more yet to be freed, <class>.

== Completion ==
The Frostwolf clan cannot be held like beasts.

You fight with honor, <name>.

== Notes ==
Trapped units are in nets. Kill the nearby aggressors, then free the villagers, who will help attack enemies for a minute or so.

==Progression==
{{Defense of Wor'gol}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
