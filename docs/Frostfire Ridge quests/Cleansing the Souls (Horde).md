==Objectives==
Cleanse 10 Crazed Souls.
*Crazed Souls Cleansed (10)
*[[Luminescent Soul Shard]] (provided)

==Description==
Not all [[ghost|spirits]] are destroyed by the [[:Soulgrinder]]. Some souls manage to survive more or less intact like myself. Others have become twisted and maddened.

End their misery, take my soul shard and use it to purify them. Their rage will blind them to the effects of its energy so you must defeat them before you use it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, I am glad that the spirits have been released from their torment.

==Progression==
{{Missing Agent}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.3|note=Added.}}
