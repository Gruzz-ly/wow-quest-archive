==Objectives==
Use Na'Shra's Mining Pick to collect 20 Fomic Ore.
* [[Fomic Ore]] (20)
* [[Na'Shra's Mining Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
Stranger! Thank the spirits for them sending you to me now. I am forging a blade and cannot leave it at this delicate state.

But I need more ore to complete this task.

Here, take my mining pick. It is crafted from the teeth and acid of the local [[goren]] and will cut through the ore of this area as if it were air.

Bring me the ore and I will lend this blade to your cause.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20|}}
* 13,970 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The power of a weapon comes both from the test of its metal and the skill of the hands that wield it.

==Completion==
Perfect timing. The steel of the blade is still malleable. A few more strikes and my work shall be complete.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Initiate Na'Shra|Formic ore is tougher than hardened steel. You will need my goren-toothed pick axe to cut through the rock.}}
Look for Formic Ore Deposits all over the area. Turn back in to her after picking up twenty pieces of ore.

On complete:
:''Na'Shra finishes crafting her weapon and moves a few paces away from the lava pool.''
:{{text|say|Weaponsmith Na'Shra|You now stand before Na'Shra! Weaponsmith of the Frostwolf Clan. For your service, I give you mine.}}
