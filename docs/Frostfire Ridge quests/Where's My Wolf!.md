== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Beastmaster Torash.jpg|Beastmaster Torash}}
Slay Beastmaster Torash and free Nerok in [[Grom'gar]].
*[[Beastmaster Torash]] slain {{co|65.8|61.4|Frostfire Ridge}}
*[[Nerok]] freed {{co|61.0|65.0|Frostfire Ridge}}

== Description ==
My [[frost wolf]], Nerok, was captured with me and the others. I do not know where they are keeping him, but I'll bet the so-called "beastmaster" who dragged us here does.

He is at the beast pens nearby, boasting about his catch to the younger [[hunter]]s.

We'll see how he boasts with my axe in his skull.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Progress ==
I will not leave my frost wolf behind. Dead or alive, Nerok leaves this place with me.

== Completion ==
Nerok and I are the only surviving prisoners, but we cannot leave just yet.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Karg Unchained]] before heading out. Start killing a path to Torash, starting east of Grom'gar's body. There, [[Beastmaster Torash]] is telling  his story to three [[Thunderlord Youngling]]s.
:{{text|say|Beastmaster Torash|What's this?! A couple of stray mutts, who need to be put down!}}
:{{text|yell|Karg Bloodfury|Face my axe!}}
Take him and the younglings out.
:{{text|say|Beastmaster Torash|URGH! Damn... unruly dogs...}}
:{{text|say|Karg Bloodfury|You should have killed me when you had the chance. Now where is my wolf?!}}
:{{text|say|Beastmaster Torash|Heh... that mutt... <cough> is being broken... with the other beasts.}}
:{{text|say|Lokra|Being broken? Nerok would die before he obeyed them!}}
:{{text|say|Karg Bloodfury|I know. We'd better find him before that happens.}}
[[Dagg]] is in a cage near Torash, ready to be freed again.

On top of [[Grom'gar]] in the rylak area, is a [[Wiggling Egg]]. Loot it to acquire the [[Mysterious Egg]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].

Kill a path southwest to the other side of Grom'gar. Nerok is chained up with a bunch of trained coldsnouts. Interact with Nerok to break the chains.
:{{text|say|Karg Bloodfury|Come, brother. You are free now.}}
:{{text|emote|Nerok sniffs Lokra and whines.}}
:{{text|say|Lokra|You smell Asha, don't you? I... am so sorry, Nerok. I failed to protect her.}}
:{{text|say|Karg Bloodfury|So many brothers and sisters lost...}}
