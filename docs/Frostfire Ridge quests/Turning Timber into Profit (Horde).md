==Objectives==
Collect 10 pieces of Timber from around {{Au|Draenor}} and then Place a Work Order at your Garrison's Lumber Mill.
*[[Timber (garrison)]] (10) (Optional)
*Place a Work Order

==Description==
Now that you know how to put [[peon]]s to work harvesting timber, we're going to create a work order for your mill.

But first we're going to need some timber to process!

All around Draenor are juicy trees ripe for the chopping. Go out and find suitable timber for the lumber mill. Come back here when you have enough and we'll get started on a work order.

And as usual, let the peons do the hard work. Just keep 'em protected. Draenor's a dangerous place!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|20|}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (100)

==Progress==
We need lots and lots of timber, commander!

==Completion==
That's how it's done, commander!

We're now fully operational. Any time you have enough timber to place a work order, come on back to me and we'll get started.

This garrison ain't gonna build itself!
