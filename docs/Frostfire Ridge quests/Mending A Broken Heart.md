==Objectives==
Meet [[Waruk the Frostforger|Waruk]] at [[Stonefang Outpost]].
*[[Ghost-Touched Materials]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, thank you for avenging my death... but I have just one more favor to ask of you.

If you help me see this through, I will forever be in your debt.

Take these items and meet me at the forge in Stonefang Outpost.

I have imbued them with a portion of my essence, but we still need the aid of another to reforge the hammer.

It is time for me to reconcile with [[Axe-Shaper Kugra|Kugra]], so that we both may finally find peace....

For Kugra....

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*[[The Forge, Level 1]]
*[[Draenor Blacksmithing (item)]]
* 13,690 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
My father... but, how did you....

==Completion==
This entire time... I have been so consumed with my own grief.

I never once stopped to consider how much my father was suffering at the hands of our enemies.

Thank you so much, <class>, for helping him to return to me. Please, allow me to repair his hammer.

In exchange for everything you have done for us, I will teach you whatever you wish to know.
