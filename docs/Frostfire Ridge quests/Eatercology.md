==Objectives==
Collect 10 Motes of Frostfire.
*[[Mote of Frostfire]] (10)

==Description==
{{Au|Drek'Thar}} thinks the portions of [[Exurotus]] consumed by the [[goren]] might be worthless. I am not about to step before the fury without at least trying to recover as many of these "motes" as possible.

Slay any goren you find in the [[Magnarok]] and see if you cannot extract the motes of Frostfire from them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Have you had any luck recovering those motes? I found 10 myself.

==Completion==
Goren are abominations. You have done well.

==Notes==
Pick up [[In the Shadow of Giants]] before heading in to the [[Magnarok]]. Inside, look out for [[Initiate Na'Shra]], who offers [[Smeltcraft]].

Any goren in the area should drop the motes.

There is a rare jormungar, [[The Bone Crawler]], who is found in the eastern [[Refuse Pit]]. It drops [[The Bone Crawler's Carapace]].

==Progression==
