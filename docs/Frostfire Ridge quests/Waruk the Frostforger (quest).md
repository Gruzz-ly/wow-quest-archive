==Description==
Many say my father was a legendary blacksmith, Waruk the Frostforger they called him. They will tell you tales of his mighty weapons, crafted with nothing more than ice and steel. Waruk the Lieforger, I call him.

He promised he wouldn't be gone long, "I must support our troops!" he said.

Why did he have to go? Why did they let him get captured!?

I have no more need for broken tools than I do broken promises. His grave is east of here, you can leave this with the rest of his unwanted belongings.

You will receive:
*{{cost|2|85}}
*3,420[[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Greetings <race>, what brings you to this old orc's grave?

==Completion==
Where did you find this hammer!?
