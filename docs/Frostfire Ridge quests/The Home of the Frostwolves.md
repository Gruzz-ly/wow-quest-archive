:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|We are home.}}

At the [[Burning Glacier]], [[Drek'Thar (alternate universe)|Farseer Drek'Thar]], [[Thrall]], and [[Khadgar|Archmage Khadgar]] were standing on the beach next to a "The Story So Far..." bulletin board, which states:
:You have traveled to [[Draenor]]'s past with Archmage Khadgar, Thrall, and many other heroes of the Horde and Alliance to stop the [[Iron Horde]] from building the [[Dark Portal]] and obliterating the world as we know it!
:When you arrived on the other side of the portal, the united orc clans were there to meet you. Many paid the ultimate price in that first hour, but you succeeded in destroying the dark portal and escaping with your life.
:Along the way, you freed many [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf orcs]], including Drek'Thar and {{Au|Ga'nar}}, two who are revered among their clan. They helped you secure a boat for your escape, and brought you back to their homeland of Frostfire.
:Here, you will establish a base and build allies to further carry out the fight against the Iron Horde, and stomp out any possibility of them returning to [[Azeroth]] to finish what they started.
