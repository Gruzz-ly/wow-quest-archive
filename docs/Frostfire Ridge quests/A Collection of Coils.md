==Objectives==
Gather 5 Coils of Sturdy Rope from [[Thunderlord Wrangler]]s in the [[Bones of Agurak]].
*[[Coil of Sturdy Rope]] (5) (1 provided)

==Description==
;Drop-started:
:This coil of rope has been woven thick, the better for the Thunderlord Wranglers to handle the dangerous beasts they tame.
:[[Scout Ruk'Gan|Scout Ruk'gan]]{{sic}} might have a use for this and a few more like it.
;Backup:
:None of the {{Au|Thunderlord clan|Thunderlord}} can escape my wrath! We need something to pull them out of the skies so that they can greet our blades.
:Their wranglers should carry rope with them for handling their beasts. Slay them, if they have any coils in good condition bring them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 XP

==Progress==
I'm growing tired of waiting, do you have anything to help our assault or not?

==Completion==
Rope? Do you expect me to tie a noose and ask the Thunderlords to go hang themselves?

Wait... that gives me an idea. Yea, I think I can make this work with the right materials.

Good Job.

==Notes==
Gather and kill all the things, then find Scout Ruk'Gan stealthed near the Draenor giant's hand.

==Progression==
{{Bones of Agurak}}
