==Objectives==
Find and release Torag from his icy prison.
*[[Torag Stonefury]] Freed

==Description==
[[Oru'kai]] was the first [[ogre mage]] to master the art of [[enchanting]]. Upon his death, his items were scattered across {{Au|Draenor}}. I have tracked his scepter to the field you see before us.

As you can see, the scepter's enchantment is making it difficult to retrieve. A would-be apprentice, Torag Stonefury, took one of Oru'kai's rings in to break the enchantment, but he failed and became trapped in ice.

Free Torag, take the ring, and complete his task, and I will consider a reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|8|60}}
* 10,270 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you. I thought I was going to be stuck here forever.
