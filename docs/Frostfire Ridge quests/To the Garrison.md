== Objectives ==
Meet with [[Durotan (alternate universe)|Durotan]] in front of [[Frostwall|your garrison]] in [[Frostfire Ridge]].

== Description ==
My father is avenged. The sons of the Iron Wolf are all slain.

Go to the garrison your people are constructing in the south. There, herald my return to my laggard brother.

The time has come for the "chieftain" to be reminded of what it means to be a Frostwolf.

''On accept'':
:{{text|yell|Ga'nar|Honored brothers and sisters! Today whe achieved what Durotan would not even dare to try!}}
:{{text|yell|Ga'nar|Make no mistake. We are at war. And we need a Warchief!}}
:{{text|yell|Ga'nar|Those of you bold enough to stand with me - come! We will show the world the might of the Frostwolves!}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|11|80}}

== Completion ==
Ga'nar is coming. Good. We need his forces if we are to press the advantage.

I can only hope his bloodlust has quelled enough for him to listen to reason.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Durotan|Ga'nar! It's about time you returned. What grisly trophies are these?}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|I have slain the sons of the Iron Wolf. He drowns in the blood of his own.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|Your fool crusade left us exposed to attack. Many died.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|I am your Chieftain; you and your warriors will fall back in line.}}
:''Ga'nar places down the stick of the skulls of the Iron Wolf's sons.''
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|You are no Chieftain of mine, brother. By my rights of second son, by the justice I have dealt today, I declare mak'gora.}}
:''Ga'nar throws his weapon down on the ground.''
:{{text|say|Draka|You must not do this! You are family!}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|Family looks to its own! Only I cared to avenge our father's death!}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|You think THIS is what father wanted?}}
:''Durotan throws his weapon down on the ground and starts walking up to Ga'nar.''
:{{text|say|Durotan|Go ahead, Ga'nar. Take the clan. Slay your own brother in cold blood. See who follows you then.}}
:''Ga'nar throws a punch in the air and then kneels before his brother.''
:{{text|say|Durotan|Vengeance does not make our clan strong.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|Our strength comes from working together.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|Rise up, brother. I need you. This clan needs you.}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|Chieftain.}}

== Gains ==
* 13830 XP
* +10 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Notes ==
Head back to [[Frostwall]]. The hostile NPCs in the tunnels and on the surface are all gone, so it's a hop, skip and a jump (or just a [[Hearthstone]] use) back to the south.

This concludes the "Ga'nar's Vengeance" portion of [[You'll Get Caught Up In The... Frostfire!]] achievement. Don't forget to do the "Beneath Thunder's Fall" portion of the [[Frostfire Ridge storyline]] that started with [[Securing the South]] at Bladespire. The zone storyline continues with [[The Iron Wolf (quest)]].
