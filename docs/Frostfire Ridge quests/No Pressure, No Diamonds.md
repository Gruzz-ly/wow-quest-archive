==Objectives==
Acquire Lava Diamonds from the Lava Slimes that reside in Frostfire Ridge.
*[[Massive Lava Slime]] slain
*[[Rough Lava Diamond]] (3)
*[[Marvelous Lava Diamond]]

==Description==
You wish to understand the secrets of our gems, <race>? In exchange for returning my pendant, I am willing to help.

I must warn you, however, that the materials will not be easy to obtain.

To the north, you will find magma pools that give birth to living lava creatures. Contained within these, you may find magnificent diamonds.

Please return to me with a few of these diamonds...

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40|}}
*13,690 
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the materials I asked for?

==Completion==
This diamond is marvelous! I shiver at the mere thought of the massive creature this must have come from...
