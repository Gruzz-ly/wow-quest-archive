==Objectives==
Gather 5 Thunderlord Spears within the [[Bones of Agurak]].
*[[Barbed Thunderlord Spear]] × 5 (1 provided)

==Description==
;Object-started:
:The Thunderlord Spear is extremely light and strong.
:[[Scout Ruk'Gan]] might be able to use this and a few more like it.
;Backup:
:Those Thunderlords circling above us are a problem <name>.
:They fly their pathetic Rylaks leisurely across the valley, thinking they are safe to rain spears down on our heads. We need to show them they are not safe from Frostwolf Vengeance!
:I have a plan but we will need to gather some material. Go hunt across the valley for any of their spears that survived intact. I think five should be enough.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
*13970 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What is it, <class>? Have you got something for me?

==Completion==
Hrm, yes these spears look pretty good.

Not bad! I know just what to use these for!

==Notes==
Gather and kill all the things, then find Scout Ruk'Gan stealthed near the draenor giant's hand.

==Progression==
{{Bones of Agurak}}
