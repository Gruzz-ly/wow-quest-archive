==Objectives==
Have [[Skaggit]] get the peons working, investigate your Garrison Cache, and find Senior Peon II.
*Instruct Skaggit to release the peons {{co|41.1|50.7|Frostwall||1}}
*Investigate your Garrison Cache {{co|56.9|51.7|Frostwall||1}}
*Speak with [[Senior Peon II]] {{co|49.3|16.5|Frostwall||1}}

==Description==
Every fortress needs three things.

One: peons! Find Skaggit and have him get our peons back to work.

Two: building materials. I had the peons set up a cache for you where they will store resources they create while you are away. You should check it out.

And three: raw experienced muscle! Constructing buildings in a garrison can take some time but I think we can speed up your first building by hiring Skaggit's recently promoted Senior Peon II. Find him and tell him I sent ya.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*18150 [[XP]]
*55x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
If buildin' a stronghold were easy, everybody'd be doin it.

==Completion==
Yeah, that's the stuff. Lumber, peons, more peons. It's like we are building you a stronghold or something.

Pick up [[What We Need]] from [[Gazlowe]] and [[The Ogron Live?]] from [[Rokhan]] before heading out.

In the medium plot to the east, next to the empty large plot, find [[Lady Sena]] and [[Mr. Pleeb]] right by the [[Garrison Cache]]. Lady Sena has this to say:
:BOLD! Is that what this plot says to you, commander? No! It does not! But then this is why I was hired.
:Using the small plots we can build a striking array of structures like... an apothecary! Yes, an apothecary. Or perhaps a smithy or a workshop.
:If we use the large plots, we could outfit you with a barracks for your troops that will strike fear into the hearts of your enemies and sleep into the faces of your soldiers.
:The sky is the limit, as is the width and length.

Interact with the cache to bring the player's total supply of [[Garrison Resources]] up to an even 1000.
:{{text|say|Lady Sena|Be sure to check back for more resources later, commander. The peons will keep putting them in this chest while you are away.}}

Exit the garrison to the southwest. Just outside, [[Skaggit]] is standing near a bunch of sleeping, lazy [[Frostwolf Peon]]s:
:Commander, your pack of peons awaits your orders.
:{{gossip|Get the peons back to work.}}
:{{text|say|Skaggit|You got it. One fully armed and operational army of motivated peons coming right up.}}
:''Skaggit runs around smacking all of the peons, who quickly get to their feet and start working.''

Loop around to the north exit of the Garrison to find [[Senior Peon II]] by a bonfire.
:Something need doing?
:{{gossip|Gazlowe needs you.}}

Before turning in, stay outside the garrison walls and get to the southeast side of camp. Hidden among the trees is [[Lady Sena's Other Materials Stash]], worth 30-40 [[Garrison Resources]] and a decent chunk of XP.
