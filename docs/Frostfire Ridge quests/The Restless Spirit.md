==Description==
This hammer was once used to craft magnificent weapons for my Frostwolf brothers and sisters.

When I was taken prisoner by the Thunderlords, however, I refused to wield it. How could I craft weapons to be used against my own people?

It saddens me to see that it has been damaged and abused.

I wished to one day pass it down to Kugra, but now, her anger prevents her from even visiting my grave.

Please <name>, can you help me repair my hammer and seek revenge on those that caused this?

For Kugra....

*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
So, it is done?

==Completion==
<Name>, thank you for avenging my death.
