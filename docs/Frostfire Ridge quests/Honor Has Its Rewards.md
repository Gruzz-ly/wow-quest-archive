==Objectives==
Go to the Shamanstone in [[Wor'gol]] and receive a blessing.
*Receive Blessing from [[Frostwolf Shamanstone|Shamanstone]]{{co|17.5|56.6|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
You have honored my people. Now, we wish to honor you.

We have a rite of initiation in my clan. When one comes of age, they cover themselves in the blood of their first hunt, and rest their hands upon a shamanstone to honor the ancestors who came before them.

In our brief time together you have already slain many foes more fierce than our hunters have ever had to face. Go, touch the shamanstone here in Wor'gol, and join our pack as an equal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Thank you for saving my clan.

==Completion==
If you choose to continue to help our clan, the other Shamanstones will sense your closeness to the Frostwolves and might bless you with more gifts.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Rally the Frostwolves]] before heading out. Head northwest to the cave at the western end of [[Wor'gol]]. Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Come, friends. If you wish to fight with our clan, we welcome you to receive our blessings.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Reach out to the Shamanstone. Embrace the wisdom of this land and the ancestors that came before us.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I can feel it. This land speaks to me, but in a language I do not yet understand.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|I am still scarred by those infernal warlocks. The spirits are quiet.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|The spirits will never abandon you, Drek'Thar. This I can promise.}}

Interact with the Frostwolf Shamanstone, the first of many in Frostfire Ridge:
:The Shamanstone hums in the presence of powerful heroes.
:{{gossip|Spirit of the Wolf}}
The Shamanstone buffs players with Shamanstone: Spirit of the Wolf - Run speed increased by 30% while out of combat.

Find other Shamanstones out in the zone, and pick one of the found buffs using the Shamanstone at Frostwall.

==Progression==
