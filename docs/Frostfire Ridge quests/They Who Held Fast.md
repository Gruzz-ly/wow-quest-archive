== Description ==
The siege has been broken - they underestimated the resilience of Stonefang, and our reinforcement wave from Bladespire caught them completely off-guard.

Once we finish cleaning up here, we rally anyone who can still fight and prepare to march for Grom'gar.

The outpost captain, Karg Bloodfury, should have come out to meet us by now. Can you get him out here?

Tell him Lokra is waiting. He knows how much I hate to be kept waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
You go ahead - Asha and I will hold here for now.

== Completion ==
You're back! But where is Karg?

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Lokra|You hear that, [[Asha]]? Karg is coming. That means you get to play with Nerok!}}
:{{text|emote|Asha howls in excitement.}}

Enter the outpost and head east. While looking for Karg, note the [[Wounded Frostwolf Shaman]] in one of the further buildings, who offers [[Of Fire and Thunder]]. Immediately outside, there is a Frostwolf Warrior:
:{{Text|say|Frostwolf Warrior|You look lost, outsider! What is your business here?}}

Speak with him:
:{{text|say|Frostwolf Warrior|Karg? Yeah, I saw him. He saved my life - took on five of those filthy {{Au|Thunderlord clan|Thunderlords}} by himself.}}
:{{text|say|Frostwolf Warrior|He had 'em, too. Until the Iron Wolf showed up riding the biggest, meanest [[rylak]] I've ever seen. Snatched him up and carried him away.}}
:{{text|say|Frostwolf Warrior|They took others, too. Dragged 'em down into the canyon. Ask around, find out who's gone missing.}}
Immediately inside is [[Matron Suma]]:
:{{text|say|Matron Suma|I haven't seen [[Makar Stonebinder|Makar]] in some time. His healing skills are desperately needed!}}
Double back to the west to find [[Rota Surehide]] being comforted by [[Elder Surehide]]:
:{{text|say|Rota Surehide|One of those things grabbed my daughter [[Gana Surehide|Gana]]! Dragged her away in chains like an animal!}}
Further west, observing a dead Thunderlord beast-rider and driftstalker, is [[Dungar Frostmane]]:
:{{text|say|Dungar Frostmane|My stable hand, [[Roknor]] tried to fight off one of those rylaks with a pitchfork and got himself dragged down into the Boneslag!}}

Turn back in to [[Lokra]].
