==Objectives==
Catch up with [[Lokra]] in the [[Icewind Drifts]].
*Find Lokra in Icewind Drifts {{co|55.4|56.8|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
[[Karg]]'s captors are moving east - probably retreating to [[Grom'gar]] with their tails between their legs!

They think they outrun me, but [[Asha]] here is the fastest thing on four legs. We'll run them down in the Icewind Drifts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
<Lokra's gaze remains fixed on her dying frost wolf.>

We had them... We had them, Asha. You were so fast. So beautiful.

I failed you, Asha. I am sorry.

==Notes==

Lokra takes off to the southeast. Follow them. Lokra and Asha come to a stop in front of The Iron Wolf, Warlord of the Thunderlord clan. Catch up to them:
:{{text|yell|Lokra|Coward! Release Karg and face me!}}
:{{text|say|The Iron Wolf|You are fierce, pup, but your attachments make you weak!}}
:''The Iron Wolf lobs a spears at Asha, mortally wounding her.''
:{{text|yell|Lokra|Asha?! Asha, NO!!}}
:{{text|say|The Iron Wolf|Free yourself of weakness, or be swept away by the Iron Tide!}}
:''The Iron Wolf turns to fly away as Lokra heaves an axe at him.''
