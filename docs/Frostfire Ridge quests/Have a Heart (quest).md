==Objectives==
Collect the Heart of Fernus.
*[[The Heart of Fernus]]

==Description==
Did you notice the magical barrier protecting the cave's entrance? It's being powered by demon crystals.

The [[Burning Legion]] has a habit of making demon parts serve as the keys to such devices.

Travel west to the [[Ruins of Ata'gar]]. Look for a powerful demon therein and bring me its heart.

I'll project an image of myself into the ruins. You won't have to come back here until we're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the demon key?

==Completion==
A heart? How touching.

Quickly, we must use it to destroy the fel crystals and get to Gul'dan.

==Notes==

Pick up [[Eliminate the Shadow Council]] before heading out. Run west, skirting the south end of the [[Icescar Boneyard]] to cross [[Lashwind Cleft]] and reach the [[Ruins of Ata'gar]].

[[Fernus]] is at the northeast end of the ruins, chained up by a couple of [[Shadow Disciple]]s. Take out the disciples and watch out for the patrol while killing [[Fernus]].

Find the [[Image of Archmage Khadgar]] overlooking the cave entrance in the middle of camp.
