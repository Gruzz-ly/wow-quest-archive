*[[Outrider Vorg]]
*[[Outrider Lukar]]
*[[Outrider Balul]]

==Description==
The [[ogre]]s outnumbered us, *cough* but we made them pay for their deeds in blood.

Even so, I was forced to abandon my fallen brothers and sisters on the battlefield. They deserve better than to have their corpses despoiled by the ogre filth.

Here, take this torch *cough* and do what I could not: burn the corpses of my fallen brothers and sisters to the west.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Did you give the others a proper burial?

==Completion==
You bring honor to the clan by giving my family a proper burial, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Gut Guttra]] before heading out.

The ambush took place to the west near a camp full of live and dead ogres on the [[Icewind Drifts]].
