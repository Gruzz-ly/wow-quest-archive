== Objectives ==
[[File:Blackrock Blasting Powder.jpg|thumb|Blackrock Blasting Powder]]

Use [[:Blackrock Blasting Powder]] to destroy 5 Iron Horde Cannons in [[Grom'gar]].
*[[Iron Horde Cannon]]s destroyed × 5

== Description ==
If we leave now, my clan's final assault on Grom'gar will be a disaster.

Though our warriors are unmatched in melee, the Thunderlords have new ranged weapons - our forces would be decimated as they cross the [[Icewind Drifts]].

But WE are already here. We can overtake those weapons before they ever fire.

Blackrock orcs help our enemies forge these "cannons" in the workshops on the south side. If we use their own tools to sabotage the weapons, we leave Grom'gar wide open to a Frostwolf raid.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Progress ==
If we leave those cannons intact, my brothers and sisters will die. What more is there to say?

== Completion ==
See how their machines fail them! There is no better weapon than pure orc muscle!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Master Siegesmith]] before heading out. Keep killing a path south. At the cannon area, focus on [[Blackrock Siegesmith]]s and [[Thunderlord Apprentice]]s, who drop [[Blackrock Blasting Powder]]. More blasting powder is found in crates. At the south end of the cannon area, find [[Master Siegesmith Uratok]].

Before leaving [[Grom'gar]] to return to the garrison, head south to the [[Southwind Cliffs]]. Find rare air elemental [[Cyclonic Fury]] at roughly {{co|67|78|Frostfire Ridge}} on the east side of the cape. It drops the [[Windburnt Pauldrons]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, find the Buffeting Galefury [[Shamanstone]] at {{co|65.2|79.1|Frostfire Ridge}} next to a rock outcrop further south.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Karg Bloodfury|Lokra... with you at my side, I feel invincible! Let us challenge the Iron Wolf right now and end this!}}
:{{text|say|Lokra|I felt invincible once; I was wrong. We return to the pack. The Iron Wolf will answer to the full might of the Frostwolf clan.}}
