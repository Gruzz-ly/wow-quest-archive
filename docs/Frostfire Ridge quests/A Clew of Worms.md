==Objectives==
Kill 15 Wastes Rockworms.
*[[Wastes Rockworm]] slain (15)

==Description==
While I was scouting, I noticed that most of [[Frostwind Crag]] is crawling with an odd species of worm.

The worst thing about them is that these things burrow under the ground and then spring on you from out of nowhere.

I saw the worms attacking the frost wolves and other wildlife in the wastes. I'm certain the orcs would appreciate you helping out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
* 14240 XP

==Progress==
Watch your back out there. Those worms will attack when you're not looking.

==Completion==
We haven't seen these creatures here in a generation.

Their sudden appearance and the ground shaking are most definitely connected.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Watch yourself out there. Those things come out of nowhere.}}

*Pick up [[What Must Be Done]] before heading out. Rockworms are always found in groups of three, either attacking clefthooves or under the snow leaving snow trails.
*During the beta, Frostwind Crag was referred to as the Frostwind Dunes.
