==Objectives==
Harvest a Timber Sample from Small Timber and return it to [[Lumber Lord Oktron]].
*[[Timber Sample]]

==Description==
<Sir/Ma'am>, we're going to need a lot of [[lumber]] if we're going to build [[Frostwall|this garrison]] into a suitable fortress. That means we're going to have to do a little work.

While I certainly wouldn't ask you to dirty your hands with manual labor, I do need you to go out and find timber for our mill. Once you mark a tree an able-bodied lazy-good-for-nothing [[peon]] will come and chop it down and give you the timber.

[[Frostfire Ridge|Frostfire]] isn't the best place for timber, but I did see a suitable small tree nearby.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*{{Abilities|Apprentice Logging|id=167911|Allows you to find and harvest small timber from various types of trees across Draenor.|icon=garrison_building_lumbermill}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Progress==
This garrison isn't going to build itself, commander! We need timber!

==Completion==
You're going to make a fine overseer, sir! Keep those peons in line!

Now you know the basics of logging and finding timber. Time to put them to good use for the good of your garrison.
