:{{text|say|Thrall|Durotan, your brother has already rushed ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|Ga'nar is a great fighter, but he is impatient. He has taken some of our best warriors with him.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|He never listens. His ruthlessness may cost us.}}
Upon reaching Gormaul Tower:
:{{text|say|Durotan|Here - Gor'maul tower. This will be our foothold. Leave none alive! LOK'TAR OGAR!}}
Get close to Durotan:

Once the last ogre is dead, reinforcements in the form of two [[Bladespire Ogron]] arrive!
:{{text|yell|Durotan|Reinforcements approach. Attack!}}
