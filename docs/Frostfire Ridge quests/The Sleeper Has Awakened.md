==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Shui Halad.jpg|Shui Halad|You must slay the great worm!}}
Kill Shui Halad.
*[[Shui Halad]] slain

==Description==
Something has awakened the great Shui Halad. She is causing the ground to quake.

<The farseer makes a sign of warding in the air, and then continues.>

Perhaps those who have disturbed the great worm are the same ones your friends are tracking down?

Either way, Shui Halad must be put to eternal rest before her thrashing collapses all of the north into the ocean.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|39}}
*21360 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've heard tale of these strange pale orcs you saw. They sound like the Warsingers of Nagrand. But no, that cannot be....

As for the ogre, his name is [[Cho'gall]]. You should kill him if you get the chance. He brings nothing but destruction in his wake.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Farseer Urquan|You will find the Sleeper's Lair to the southwest across the dunes.}}

Pick up [[Eye Need That]], [[Stop the Flow]], and [[Desecration of the Dead]] before heading out.

Just south of the [[Frost Den]] is the entrance to the Sleeper's Lair. Inside, a number of [[Pale Slasher|pale slashers]], [[Pale Stalker|stalkers]], and [[Pale Frostbinder|frostbinder]]s are summoning [[Shui Halad]], a gigantic bone worm.

;Approaching Shui Halad
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|Do [[Shui Halad|you]] feel the power they're drawing on? (It's the [[naaru]] in [[Nagrand]]!)}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|We should subjugate these [[Pale orc]]s and the... (An intruder! Let's leave.)}}

Kill the pale before engaging the bone worm.
