== Objectives ==
Watch the construction of your garrison by using the Master Surveyor.
*Use the Master Surveyor to watch your Garrison be constructed {{co|46.9|66.4|Frostfire Ridge}}

== Description ==
It's time for the main event! We've got the materials, we've got the manpower, we've got another thing that starts with "m."

Let's build this thing!

I got a gaggle of assistants up on that ridge to the west.

They should have your personal surveying stand set up by now.

Head on over there and you should be able to watch our progress from it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 18150 [[XP]]
*[[Garrison Hearthstone]]

== Progress ==
I'm almost as excited about building this as you are. I want to see if it falls apart!

== Completion ==
Right! I think we've got this well in hand now. And hardly an explosion to be found!

==Notes==

Head southwest back to the ridge where players first entered the valley, underneath the stone arch. Up there, find [[Lady Sena]], [[Libby Wrenchwrecker]], [[Skaggit]], and [[Mr. Pleeb]]. The first two have something to say:
;Lady Sena
:Commander! I trust you are prepared to have your mind blown away by my designs.

:I am thinking... wood! Yes, wood! Lots of it. In BOLD arrangement the way that only the orcs of the original horde could conceive.

:And spikes! Yes, spikes. We must not forget the spikes. That is how you know it is Horde.

;Libby Wrenchwrecker
:So you're the new commander, eh? I thought you'd be taller.

Interact with the [[Master Surveyor]] for a cutscene as the garrison is nigh-instantly constructed while the camera tracks along showing the finished construction. Run back down the hill and open the gate to get in! Make sure to pick up the flight path just inside before turning in to Gazlowe at the town hall tent.

A cutscene plays:
:'''[[Thrall]]''': {{text|bossemote|Your heroic deeds have earned you this Frostwolf land. It is from here that you will lead the Horde to victory, Commander.}}

;Thrall on meeting a past version of his father
: I was raised on stories of Frostfire Ridge, the ancestral home of the Frostwolves.

: I never believed I would ever see the clan as they were in their prime, with Durotan as their chief.

: He is... shorter... than I imagined.  The burden of leadership weighs heavy on his shoulders.
