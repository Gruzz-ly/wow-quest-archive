[[File:Flamrog.jpg|thumb|[[Flamrog]]]]
[[File:Kindler.jpg|thumb|[[Kindler]]]]

Rescue Flamrog and Kindler.
*[[Flamrog]] rescued
*[[Kindler]] rescued
*[[Drek'Thar's Fire Totem]] (provided)

== Description ==
The [[goren]] and the [[magnaron]] are ravaging the element spirits and smelting their essence as one would smelt steel.

Commander, take my totem, travel east to Magnarok. Please, find them, and free them.

Draka and I will make our way to the [[Ascent of Frostfire]]. Meet us there if you are successful.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Completion ==
You have done well, <class>.

We will need the aid of these children when the time comes to rescue [[Exurotus]].

==Notes==
{{cleanup-section|Earthrender Magnaron was a beta thing.}}
Pick up [[Eatercology]] before heading in to the [[Magnarok]]. Inside, look out for [[Initiate Na'Shra]], who offers [[Smeltcraft]].

Watch out for the level 100 elite [[Earthrender Magnaron]]! The fire elementals are bound at the base of red-runed columns on the northwest side of the forge area. Interact with each elemental to free it.

There is a rare jormungar, [[The Bone Crawler]], who is found in the eastern [[Refuse Pit]]. It drops [[The Bone Crawler's Carapace]]. Additionally, [[Gorg'ak]] is found at the northeastern extent of the quest area. It drops the [[Smoldering Fist of Gorg'ak]].
