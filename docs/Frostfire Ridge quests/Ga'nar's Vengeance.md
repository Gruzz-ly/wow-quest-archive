[[File:Ga'nar's Vengeance - Ga'nar and Skal.jpg|thumb|{{Au|Ga'nar}} and [[Skal the Trapper]].]]

==Objectives==
Find {{Au|Ga'nar}} near [[Daggermaw Ravine]].

==Description==
My brother's head is as thick as his axe and he is as stubborn as a [[gronn]].

When Ga'nar left he took with him some of the finest warriors in {{Frostwolf Orcs|the clan]] and headed north to the Daggermaw Ravine. If they are still out there, you must find them. Ga'nar will not listen to me.

Help him see his vengeance through if you must but please bring him back to us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
* 1380 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
So my brother would dare not come himself?

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Durotan|Ga'nar's impatience could tear the Frostwolves apart. It is just like my brother to put his own needs above the clan.}}
:{{text|say|[[Thrall]]|Don't worry. This hero will convince Ga'nar to return. Your brother values strength, and my friend possesses that in abundance.}}

Before heading out, Durotan also starts the "Beneath Thunder's Fall" chapter of the [[Frostfire Ridge storyline]] starting with [[Securing the South]].

Head northeast through the {{Au|Ring of Blood}} to [[Daggermaw Ravine]]. There, {{Au|Ga'nar}} has captured [[Skal the Trapper]] alongside some [[Thunderlord Captive]]s.

''On approach'':
:{{text|say|Skal the Trapper|I... already told you... all that I know...}}
