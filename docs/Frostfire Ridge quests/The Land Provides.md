==Objectives==
Collect 30 Frozen Plant Matter.
*[[Frozen Plant Matter]] (30)

==Description==
The icevines of the [[Shivering Trench]] have developed a powerful resistance to cold temperatures. Integrating them into the construction materials of the garrison should prove useful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 [[XP]]
*30x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
Look at you, bein' all resourceful.

==Completion==
Now this is some handy stuff. This weather has been cutting through our supplies of rope so quick we need something we can use to provide an alternative. Looks like you scored the jackpot.

==Notes==
While in the area to rescue [[Winds of Change (quest)]], look out for an [[Icevine]] in the center of the Shivering Trench, where [[Coldtusk]] patrolls. There is plenty of Icevine all along the valley, and each node provides 3-5 [[Frozen Plant Matter]].
