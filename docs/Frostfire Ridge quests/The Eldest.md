== Notes ==
Interact with Ga'nar again:
:<Ga'nar is mustering is strength to challenge the enormous gronn.>
:{{gossip|<Assist Ga'nar in battle.>}}
:{{text|yell|Ga'nar|Hatock, son of the Iron Wolf! I come for your head.}}
:{{text|say|Hatock the Gronnmaster|Hrah hrah hrah hrah! You should haev stayed dead, Ga'nar. You would have lived longer.}}
:{{text|yell|Hatock the Gronnmaster|Thunderlord... RELEASE THE BEAST!}}
:''Hatock pops [[Camouflage]], releasing Grulloc. During the fight, Hatock pops out of camo for a moment to taunt Ga'nar.''
:{{text|yell|Hatock the Gronnmaster|What is wrong, Ga'nar? Afraid of a bit of gronn?}}
:{{text|yell|Ga'nar|Frostwolves! Kill the gronn! Find the coward!}}
:''After Grulloc dies, Ga'nar runs straight for Hatock, killing him in one strike.''
:{{text|yell|Ga'nar|Hatock! You cannot hide from me!}}

Once Grulloc is released, he uses two one-shottable moves:
*{{abilities|Blind Strike|range=15|notes=3.5 sec cast. Has a 45-degree arc that extends 15 yards in fornt of him and does ~450,000 Physical damage to units caught in it.}}
*{{abilities|Wild Thrashing|notes=3 sec cast. Hits for 340-390,000 Physical damage in a 10-yard radius circle centered on him}}
Don't get hit by either.
