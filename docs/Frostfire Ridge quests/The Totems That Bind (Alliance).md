==Objectives==
Collect 5 of [[Borgal's Totem]]s.
*Borgal's Totem (5)

==Description==
Before [[Borgal Doomfist|Borgal]] began to use the [[:Soulgrinder]], he used totems to bind [[ghost|spirits]] to his service.

If we can get a few of those totems I may be able to use the spiritual connection he's forged with them to force a link. He'll be compelled to appear before us!

Go find me a few of those totems and I might be able to pull this off, I think five should do it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have those totems I asked for? He left them around the buildings nearby.

==Completion==
Very good, I can feel that the [[magic]] in these is strong.

==Progression==
{{Missing Agent}}
