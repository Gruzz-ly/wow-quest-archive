==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Skog.jpg|Skog|Mother and/or father of the local gronnlings.}}
Kill Skog.
*[[Skog]] slain {{co|48.5|70.3|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
So this [[gronn]] infestation ain't gonna solve itself. You're gonna have to show them who's boss, [[Horde]] style!

With this many [[gronnling]]s around there is bound to be a full grown, big mama of a gronn. Find him... it... her... or whatever, and take it out, and the rest of those gronnlings might lose interest in our little operation here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You find that big gal... or guy... or gronn? Really, I ain't sure what to call them.

==Completion==
Little known fact, old gronn grottos make for great farming soil.

==Notes==
Enter the den of Skog, south of the garrison. Having flattened [[Olin Umberhide]], Skog stands here taunting him. Upon aggroing the gronn, [[Thrall]] runs in to help fight:

:{{Text|say|Olin Umberhide|By the Earthmother, this land will test us at every turn!}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|It looks like you could help a hand.}}

;Ground Slap
:{{Text|yell|Olin Umberhide yells: Watch out!}}

Finish the gronn off:
:{{text|say|Thrall|With luck, the small ones will now flee, and we can begin construction.}}

==Progression==
{{Foothold in a Savage Land}}
