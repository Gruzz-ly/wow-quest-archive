==Objectives==
Look around [[Wor'gol]] for someone who can help translate the notes.
* [[Illegible Sootstained Notes]] (provided)
* Search Wor'gol for help translating the note

==Description==
The notes are unreadable, but based on previous experience, the text appears to be very similar to standard [[Orcish (language)|Orcish]].

It is possible that the notes could contain strategic information. Perhaps it would be of great value to the [[Frostwolf Orcs]].

Someone in Wor'gol might be able to help interpret the text.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14|}}
*1,370 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Raleigh looks up from the scrolls.>

Commander <name>, what brings you to Wor'gol?!

==Completion==
We have been studying these orcish texts feverishly since our arrival here. Allow me a moment to translate this for you.

Hmmm... The notes appear to contain a list of names.

==Progression==
*[[Unintelligible Intelligence]]
**[[Bypassing Security]]
***[[Stealing the Declaration]]
