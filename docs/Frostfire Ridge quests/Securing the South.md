== Objectives ==
[[File:Lokra.jpg|thumb|[[Lokra]]]]

Speak with [[Lokra]] at [[Stonefang Outpost]].

== Description ==
We have an outpost to the southeast that was boxed in by Thunderlord forces as they marched through the canyons to [[Wor'gol]].

I have sent reinforcements to secure the outpost and press east to [[Grom'gar]]. We will push the Thunderlords out of our lands completely, and pursue them all the way back to that reeking corpse they call home.

{{Au|Draka}}'s sister, Lokra, was among the orcs who volunteered to clean up Stonefang Outpost.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
*1400 XP
* +10 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Completion ==
<Name>! They told me you'd be heading this way. You are late to the party We are just cleaning up now.

== Notes ==
Before heading out, Durotan also starts the "Ga'nar's Vengeance" chapter of the [[Frostfire Ridge storyline]] starting with [[Ga'nar's Vengeance]].

Fly back to [[Wor'gol]] or [[Frostwall]] and run to [[Stonefang Outpost]]. On the west entrance to the village, the Thunderlord are pressing the attack. Speak with [[Lokra]], who is helping fend them off at the gate.
