==Objectives==
Slay 12 Sootstained Ogres.
*Sootstained [[Ogre]]s slain (12)

==Description==
These ogres keep takin' [[Frostwolf Orcs|my clan]] and turnin' them into [[slave]]s!

Slay some ogres and I'll hold 'em off if they try to run.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Wait are you waitin' for?

==Completion==
You got the fire in you alright.

==Notes==
Any Sootstained-tagged ogre counts. Don't focus on this quest first, as Slavery and Strife and its followup both involve the killing of lots of ogres.

Just outside the entrance to the mine, on top of a building is a [[Slave's Stash]], which contains {{cost|2}}, 30 [[Garrison Resources]] and 3 [[Half Empty Bottle of Prison Moonshine]].

==Progression==
{{Defense of Wor'gol}}
