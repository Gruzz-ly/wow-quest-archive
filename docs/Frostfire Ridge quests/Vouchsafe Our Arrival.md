==Objectives==
Meet [[Cordana Felsong]] outside of [[Throm'var]] in the [[Frostwind Crag]].

==Description==
A matter of great importance has arisen. While you were away, [[Archmage Khadgar]] contacted me.

He is investigating [[demon]]ic influences to the north.

Being a [[human]], the [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolves]] will not accept Khadgar without you there to vouch for him, nor will they accept a [[night elf]] such as myself.

I will wait for you outside Throm'var in the Frostwind Crag.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|85}}
* 14240 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for coming, <name>. The archmage and I are in need of your assistance.

==Notes==
While exploring north of the eastern end of [[Daggermaw Ravine]], players may come across [[Cordana Felsong]] stealthed by a volcano. Though a night elf, she is friendly to the Horde and offers this quest.
