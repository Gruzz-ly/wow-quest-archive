'''A Warrior's Shroud''' is part of the mini quest chain that unlocks [[The Tannery, Level 1]] for horde characters. It begins upon looting [[Tattered Frostwolf Shroud]], which can be dropped for [[leatherworking|leatherworkers]] by any creature in {{Au|Draenor}}.

== Objectives ==
Locate a Frostwolf leatherworker in [[Wor'gol]] that can help you.

== Description ==
Although this cloak has seen better days, the workmanship is still quite impressive. Any normal cloak would have most certainly fallen apart by now.

Perhaps one of the Frostwolf orcs within Wor'gol would be willing to help you repair it. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|14}}

== Progress ==
Greetings, <race>. Do you require any repairs?

== Completion ==
This is a fine cloak! Sadly, we no longer have the resources to make them like this.

== Gains ==
*1370 [[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Progression ==
# [[A Warrior's Shroud]]
# [[Cut 'Em Out!]]

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 6.0.3|note=Added.}}
