==Objectives==
Meet {{Au|Durotan}}.
*Introduced to Durotan {{co|41.8|69.6|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
You have rescued many of [[Frostwolf Orcs|my clan]] from the [[slave]] pens of [[Tanaan Jungle|Tanaan]]. Their liberation and the destruction of the {{Au|Dark Portal}} are more than enough for me to consider you one of us.

However, you are still a stranger to our leader, Durotan. I would like to introduce you to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
* 1800 XP
* +10 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
What a strange creature you are.

==Completion==
I thank you for returning with my people, and I welcome you as an honored guest.

==Notes==
On accept, Drek'Thar, [[Thrall]], and [[Khadgar]] start running:
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|My eyes may not work, but the familiar chill of the air is comforting.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|You mentioned the Frostwolf [[Chieftain]]...}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Ah yes. {{Au|Garad}}'s youngest: a noble soul named Durotan.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Durotan!}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Wise beyond his years, but still young. I fear he has been thrust into the [[gronn]]'s jaws - our people are in great danger.}}
As the party reaches Durotan:
:{{text|yell|Durotan|Drek'Thar, old friend, you're alive!}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|I can barely stand. But for the actions of these heroes, I would be dead.}}

==Progression==
{{Foothold in a Savage Land}}

==Trivia==
This quest's title is a reference to the ''{{wplink|A Song of Ice and Fire}}'' series of fantasy novels by George R R Martin, more recently serialised for television as ''{{wplink|Game of Thrones}}''. The latter also has a reference in Draenor in the form of [[Game of Thorns]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2014-12-11|bluenote=Players can no longer accept this quest if [[The Home of the Frostwolves]] is already in their quest log.}}
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
