==Objectives==
Bring the Mysterious Boots to [[Zooti Fizzlefury]] at [[Khadgar's Tower]] in [[Talador]].
*[[Mysterious Boots (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Phasing back and forward in time, these flickering ornate boots are adorned with a lavish "V" on them.

Someone at Khadgar's Tower might have insights to the nature of these strange items.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I was wondering "when" I would see you again. Ah...? Ah...? Get it?

Look, for as long as anyone was speaking the [[bronze dragon]]s got to hog all of the good time jokes.

Well now the guardians of time are taking a break and there is no one left to stop me!

==Completion==
These boots are fantastic! You did the right thing bringing these to me.

They are actually trying to replace the space they occupy with a [[alternate timeline|different timeline]].

This will definitely require more study.
