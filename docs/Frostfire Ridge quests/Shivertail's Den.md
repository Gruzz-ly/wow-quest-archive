*Find [[Shivertail's Mother]] {{co|21.5|50.3|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
The Frostwolf pup looks at you with his big eyes. He howls and stares into the cave.

It's unusual for a wolf this young to be wandering around by itself. Shivertail's parents must be nearby.

* 13830 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Shivertail smells your boots.

==Completion==
Shivertail snuggles up to his mother. He is clearly happy to be reunited with most of his pack.

The cave is full of [[Ice Spider]]s. Head down and find Shivertail's Father dead on the ground:
:This wolf has been gutted and left to rot.
Further in the cave, [[Shivertail's Mother]] is found attacking a [[Pale Tormentor]]. Finish off the Tormentor and Shivertail and the Lost Pups will run out of the cave.

Before leaving the cave, note the [[Pale Loot Sack]] on the ledge above where the Pale Tormenter and Shivertail's Mother fought. It contains 30-40 [[Garrison Resources]].
