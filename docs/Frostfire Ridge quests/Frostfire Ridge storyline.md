{{shortcut|frquest}}
[[File:VZ-Frostfire Ridge.jpg|thumb|Frostfire Ridge zone map]]

The '''Frostfire Ridge storyline''' is the Horde starting experience in [[Frostfire Ridge]] after getting through [[Warlords of Draenor intro experience]]. Here, players quickly set up their [[Garrison]] at [[Frostwall]] in the south-center portion of the zone, then work to help shore up the [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolf clan]]'s defenses.

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[You'll Get Caught Up In The... Frostfire!]]

In addition to the overarching zone storyline, a huge number of [[:Category:Frostfire Ridge vignettes|vignettes]] can also be found all over Frostfire Ridge. These vignettes are one-time events: killing rare or rare-elite mobs, finding out-of-the-way treasure chests, or small events like fending off waves of attackers.

==Main storyline==

After landing in Frostfire, players need to get settled, and quickly set up their [[Garrison]] at [[Frostwall]]. This portion of the quest chain serves as an introduction and tutorial to the garrison system.

After claiming [[Bladespire Citadel]], and some loot from the sack of the citadel, the news comes that [[Wor'gol]] is under attack by the {{Au|Thunderlord clan}}! Along the way are several side quest chains.

After repelling the invasion and delivering Drek'Thar's vision to Durotan back at the Citadel, he forks the storyline, beginning both the "Ga'nar's Vengeance" and "Thunder's Fall" chapters.

Once "Ga'nar's Vengance" and "Thunder's Fall" chapters are both completed, the Thunderlord Clan will launch an [[Garrison#Invasion|invasion]] ([[Thunderlord Invasion!]]) on the Garrison. When this is repelled, the chain continues with The Battle of Thunder Pass.

After this, players are directed to [[Gorgrond]] via a quest [[The Secrets of Gorgrond (Horde)]].

==Side quests==
All of these side quests are optional to the main zone storyline, but reward plenty of gold, faction standing, and maybe a follower or two:

===Darkspear's Edge===
