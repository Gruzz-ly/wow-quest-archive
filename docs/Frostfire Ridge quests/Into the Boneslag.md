== Description ==
The Thunderlords took prisoners into the Boneslag?

Well what are we waiting for?! We have to go after them!

You look for the missing villagers - Asha and I will track [[Karg Bloodfury|Karg]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Completion ==
Thank you for finding the others. Karg and his captor are one step ahead of us, but they're limping.

== Notes ==
''On accept'':
:{{text|yell|Asha! Let's go, girl. Karg and [[Nerok]] are in trouble!}}

Exit the village and head northwest, then back east down into the [[Boneslag]]. [[Roknor]]'s corpse is found just inside, being defiled by a handful of [[Juvenile Bonestripper]]s. Interact with his corpse:
:{{text|bossemote|It's too late for this one.}}

[[File:Cindermaw.jpg|thumb|[[Cindermaw]]]]
Immediately to the northeast is the rare elite [[lava worm]] [[Cindermaw]], which drops [[Cindermaw's Blazing Talon]] and 15-20x [[Garrison Resources]].

North of Cindermaw's lava pool is [[Makar Stonebinder]], who is still alive, if barely.
:{{text|say|Makar Stonebinder|Hngg... huh? I could hear [[Lokra]]... moments ago...}}
:{{text|say|Makar Stonebinder|Ah, but she is the hunter, not the quarry. And ahead of the pack as usual...}}
Keep heading northeast, where on the north side of the giant skull are a [[Blackrock Siegesmith]] and a [[Thunderlord Apprentice]], working on Siege Munitions for [[Of Fire and Thunder]].

After interacting with the munitions, head up the hill. In the camp, [[Gana Surehide]] is staked to the ground in front of three sleeping [[Trained Coldsnout]]. Interacting with her will wake the Coldsnouts, so take them out, then interact with her again:
:<Gana strains to look around, then speaks in a hushed whisper.>
:Are... are they gone?
:{{gossip|Break the chains.}}
:{{text|whisper|Gana Surehide|Shhh... not so loud!}}
:{{text|whisper|Gana Surehide|Thank you. Mother must be worried sick about me!}}
:{{text|whisper|Gana Surehide|I can get back to the outpost from here. Find me if you need leatherworking!}}
On the other side of the campfire from Gana are another apprentice and siegesmith pair, this time working on some heavy plating. After interacting with the heavy plate and turning in, exit the lava pools area to the east to find Lokra waiting on a ridge.
