==Notes==
As the Horde player approaches Grom'gar, Ga'nar and Durotan taunts the Iron Wolf:
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|"Iron Wolf" indeed! A coward, hiding behind his minions.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|Not for long.}}

They both approach him:
:{{text|say|Durotan|Stand down, Warlord. It is over.}}
:{{text|say|The Iron Wolf|Ahh, the brothers Frostwolf. I knew we would reunite on the battlefield someday.}}
:{{text|say|The Iron Wolf|Or don't you recognize your eldest brother?}}
:''He takes his helmet off to reveal his true identity.''
:{{text|say|Durotan|...Fenris?}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|Fenris!}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|Brother, let us talk. We are still family.}}
:{{text|say|The Iron Wolf|Chilltongue - devour them!}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|Champion - focus on Fenris.}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|We'll take care of Chilltongue!}}

Chilltongue dies:
:{{text|say|The Iron Wolf|Stinking animals, all of you! Sleeping with your dogs.}}

Low health:
:{{text|say|The Iron Wolf|Orcs are meant to be masters of beasts! Masters of all!}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|No slave fights with the will of one who is free.}}
:{{text|yell|Ga'nar|Finish this!}}

Victory:
:''Draka and Thrall arrive.''
:{{text|say|The Iron Wolf|Animals... Your clan is finished... The [[Iron Horde]] already comes...}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|Let them come! Traitor!}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|He is right. The Iron Horde will move against us. We must be ready.}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|We'll be ready. They will NEVER take the pass.}}
:{{text|say|Draka|Are you okay, husband?}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|No. I will never be okay with this.}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|He made his choice.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|Come! To Thunder Pass. We are outnumbered 50 to 1. They don't stand a chance!}}
