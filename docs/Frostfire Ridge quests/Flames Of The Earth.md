==Objectives==
[[Molthron]] within the {{Au|Bloodmaul clan|Bloodmaul}} Territory wants you to use the Flamewrought Jewel to free 6 [[Magma Elemental (Frostfire Ridge)|Magma Elementals]].
*Elementals Freed (6)
*[[Flamewrought Jewel]] (provided)

==Description==
I've searched the depths of the earth and found the means to break the spells that hold my people captive, but it only functions to free one who is completely bound. I would be unable to prevent myself from becoming bound by the same [[magic]].

You, flesh creature, are not of the flames below so their binding spells should not affect you.

Please take my jewel, use its power to free my people!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070

==Completion==
The lava already burns bright with the return of my people's freedom!

We will have our revenge upon the [[ogre]]s for everything they have done to us, this I assure you. But for now, we shall rest.
