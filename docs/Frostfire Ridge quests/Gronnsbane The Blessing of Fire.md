== Objectives ==
Follow the clue to find the Molten Shamanstone and receive the Blessing of Fire.
* Receive the Blessing of Fire

== Description ==
The weapon has been assembled, but it lacks the power that made it a legend. In order to restore it, you must receive three blessings: one of fire, one of frost, and one of beasts.

The first blessing mentioned in the journal is that of fire. The journal reads:

"He describes an ancient monolith, perched upon the edge of a precipice extending from the cliff where the searing magma falls into the sea. I believe the location he speaks of is just overlooking [[Tor'goroth's Tooth]]."

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|85}}

== Completion ==
The stone reacts to Gronnsbane, and you can now feel heat emanating from the weapon.

This must be the Blessing of Fire that Argoram mentions.

== Notes ==
The Molten Shamanstone is found at {{coords|42.6|12.6|Frostfire Ridge}}.
