==Objectives==
Learn the blueprints and destroy the evidence.
*Learn Ship Blueprint: Transport
*[[Ship Blueprint: Transport]] (provided)

==Description==
The first thing we need to start building ships is a blueprint. With your help, I grabbed some of the best ones from the [[Iron Docks]] before we broke out of there.

Let's make sure these don't fall back into the hands of the [[Iron Horde]]. Memorize these blueprints, <class>, and then destroy the evidence. Let me know when you are done.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|54}}

==Progress==
You memorize those blueprints yet?

==Completion==
Hah, we'll make you a sea-dog yet. Let's get started on our first ship!

==Patch changes==
