Speak with me when you have made your decision.

Have you decided which orc to take with you?

* Greatmother Geyah:
: I have lost [[Fenris Wolfbrother (alternate universe)|two]] [[Ga'nar (alternate universe)|sons]] this day. I would see this war end before more brothers and sisters of the clans fall prey to the [[Iron Horde]].
: My way is that of a healer.  It is my gift to aid others injured by life or battle.
: If you will have me, I shall lend my healing talents to your forces.

* Kal'gor the Honorable:
: You've surpassed me on the battlefield more than once, and that's no simple feat.
: Still, there is much I can do that you've not yet seen.  The spirits have seen it fit to grant me their coldest, most harsh powers.  The elements are my allies, and the bane of our enemies.
: It would be my honor to serve at your side.

* Lokra:
: You've seen me at my worse, <name>.  [[Karg Bloodfury|My husband]] taken from me... [[Asha|my wolf]] killed by the coward, Fenris.  I know intimately the price of war.
: We must bring the Iron Horde to an end.  Grant me a place by your side on the battlefield and I will bring the elements to bear to reap vengeance on our enemies.
: You have only to accept my axe, and I will come.

{{gossip|''<Follower>, I choose you!''}}
: ''Are you sure this is the follower you want?''

== Completion ==
Excellent choice.  I will be sad to see them leave, but I know they will help strengthen our combined packs in the coming conflicts.

I will see that they make their way to your garrison as soon as they have said farewell to their loved ones.

They should be ready the next time you need to send followers on a mission.
