==Objectives==
Destroy 7 Summoning Circles.
*Summoning Circles destroyed (7)

==Description==
The {{Au|Shadow Council}} down in the boneyard are going to have magic circles. It's not enough to simply kill them; we also have to eliminate their infernal devices.

If you destroy the circles, you'll stop the flow of demons they're summoning to inhabit the bones of the dead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|It sounds like they've conjured demonic eye sentries. Be careful down there.}}

==Completion==
We should have killed them all at the [[Dark Portal]] in the beginning and damn the consequences.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eye Need That]], [[Desecration of the Dead]] and after turning in [[A Clew of Worms]], pick up [[The Sleeper Has Awakened]] before heading out. Head northwest to the [[Icescar Boneyard]]. Start killing [[Necrophyte]]s and [[Fel Wolf|fel wolves]], then interact with the summoning circles to destroy them. Ogzor is at the northwest end of the boneyard, with two [[Ogzor's Bones]] skeletal minions.
