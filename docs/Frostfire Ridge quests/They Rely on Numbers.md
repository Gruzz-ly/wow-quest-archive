==Objectives==
Slay 15 Thunderlord at [[Daggermaw Ravine]] in [[Frostfire Ridge]].
*Thunderlord Orcs slain (15)

==Description==
Thunderlord spend their days training to hunt as a team, but as individuals they are weak. Their only strength is in numbers.

So... to win, we must cull their numbers.

As we move up through the Daggermaw Ravine, slay any Thunderlord who stand in your way, and their clan will be made the weaker for it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13830 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
A fine headcount, commander.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Leave Nothing Behind!]] before heading out. Additionally, the rare elite [[Canyon Icemother]] is just to the northwest. She drops some [[Garrison Resources]] and is an achievement objective.

Don't focus on killing orcs -- there's plenty between this side of the village and the other. Eligible mobs are [[Thunderlord Lasher]]s, [[Thunderlord Spearman|Thunderlord Spearmen]], [[Thunderlord Crag-Leaper]]s, [[Kur'ak the Binder]], [[Thunderlord Beastwrangler]]s, [[Thunderlord Houndmaster]]s, [[Thunderlord Giantslayer]]s, [[Thunderlord Provisioner]]s, [[Thunderlord Gronnstalker]]s, [[Thunderlord Raider]]s, [[Grotan the Herald]], [[Thunderlord Cutter]], [[Gronnling Rider]]s, [[Thunderlord Spearhand]]s, [[Thunderlord Tracker]]s, [[Thunderlord Seer]]s, [[Thunderlord Shaman]], and [[Thunderlord Beastmaster]]s.

==Progression==
