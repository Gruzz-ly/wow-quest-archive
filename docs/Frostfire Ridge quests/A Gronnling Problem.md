==Objectives==
Kill 8 Frostfire Gronnlings.
*[[Frostfire Gronnling]] slain (8)

==Description==
It's gonna be quite a task to build you a fortress if there's [[gronnling]]s rampaging around.

I don't think anyone else here can handle taking those big beasts out, so you might need to take care of it yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If you can't find gronnlings, you ain't lookin' hard enough.

==Completion==
Nasty beasts they got here on {{Au|Draenor}}.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Back to Work]] before heading out.

They are kind of hard to miss and are all shared-tap. Keep an eye out for [[Gruuk]] southeast of the quest givers. The rare gronnling drops [[Gruuk's Evil Eye]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].

==Progression==
{{Foothold in a Savage Land}}
