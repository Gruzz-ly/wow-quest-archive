==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Sky-Singer Strag.jpg|Sky-Singer Strag|She commands on behalf of the Iron Wolf.}}
Collect [[Sky-Singer Strag]]'s Totem.
*[[Sky-Singer Strag's Totem]]

==Description==
I am [[Gronnstalker Rokash]], and I only serve the winning side.

I have heard of some of your deeds, commander, and seen the corpses left in the wake of you and your forces.

I have grown tired of my current clan. They are soft, weak, and losing.

I offer you this challenge: enter [[Colossal's Fall]] to the north and slay Sky-Singer Strag. Claim her totem as a trophy and I will hail you as my new chieftain.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 514 necks|Chain of Biting Winds|Choker of Scalding Fire|Gorget of Flowing Earth}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
*13970 XP

==Progress==
Strag always was a coward. She would hide behind her magic and position as a speaker for the dead.

==Completion==
Strag was the puppet of the Iron Wolf. She would do nothing unless ordered to by him.

This made us weak, changing us from a force to be feared to a target.

If this is what the Thunderlord have become then I will have no part of them.

==Notes==
If players get to the north end of the [[Cracking Plains]] near [[Colossal's Fall]] while killing [[Ice Fury|ice furies]] and [[Snow Lurker|snow lurkers]] for [[Frosted Fury]] and [[Lurkers]] out of [[Darkspear's Edge]], they may notice [[Gronnstalker Rokash]] and the pile of [[Broken Chains]] just outside of [[Colossal's Fall]]. Rokash starts this quest, and the chains start [[Thunderlord for a Day]].

Look on the ground nearby for coils of chains. The [[Thunderlord Grappler]]s drop a [[Vicious Grapple]] on occasion. In camp, look for a [[Thunderlord Crag-Leaper]] next to the Chaincrafter's Anvil, which will complete the quest. [[Sky-Singer Strag]] is on the raised platform at the east end of camp.

Also in camp is [[Jehil the Climber]], hiding out asleep on top of the giant's ribcage. He drops [[Jehil's Climbin' Boots]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]]. See Jehil's article for information on how to get to him.
