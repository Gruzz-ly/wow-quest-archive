==Objectives==
Obtain Owynn's Dagger, Mace, and Gear.
*[[Owynn's Armor]]
*[[Owynn's Dagger]]
*[[Owynn's Mace]]

==Description==
When I was captured they took my gear and left me in rags. My mace is being used to crack stones and they're even using me best dagger as a dinner fork! I'd hate to know what happened to me armor but I hope its still usable.

I'll need a wee bit to recover from me wounds and without my stuff I'm no help in a fight. Could ye go find my gear for me?

Last I saw my armors in a chest next to that big tower south of here, my dagger was to the south west, and my mace over near that lava field to the west.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Just need a bit of a refresher, being beat up by [[ogre]]s makes ye a little sore. Who knew?

==Completion==
Thank ye, looks like everything's still in good shape. Just give me a moment to put this on.

==Progression==
{{Missing Agent}}
