==Objectives==
Search Stonefang Outpost for the hammer's previous owner.
* [[Fractured Forge Hammer]] (Provided)

==Description==
It is obvious that this elaborate smithing hammer has seen better days.

Now fractured and dirty, it is merely a shadow of its former self.

One thing is certain, its previous owner was neither ogre nor Iron Horde.

Perhaps someone at Stonefang Outpost would know who this belongs to.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|14|}}

==Progress==
What do you want, <race>?

==Completion==
My father's hammer, where did you find this!?

==Gains==
* 1,370 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progression==
...

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
