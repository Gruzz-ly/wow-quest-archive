==Objectives==
[[File:Barrel of Frostwolf Oil.jpg|thumb|Frostwolf Oil]]
Collect barrels of Frostwolf Oil and deliver it to [[Gol'kosh the Axe|Gol'kosh]] in the supply room.
*[[Frostwolf Oil]] × 5
*Take Oil to Gol'kosh {{co|56.0|43.7|Bladespire Fortress}} / {{co|28.6|36.3|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
In his haste, [[Ga'nar (alternate universe)|Ga'nar]] advanced before this area was secured. He is a matchless [[warrior]], mind you, but his tactics are sometimes costly.

Gol'kosh and his troops were ordered to destroy enemy supplies, but ogres have stolen the oil he needs.

Retrieve the oil and see that their mission is carried out, traveler. Then, if they still live, direct them to rejoin me at the citadel's entrance.

I must see my wounded brothers to safety.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Lok'tar, traveler.

==Completion==
Gol'kosh has completed his mission, then.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Durotan|I will get these orcs to safety and meet with you outside.}}
:''Durotan runs off.''
Barrels of Frostwolf Oil litter the area. Collect 5 and work around counterclockwise to the southeast side of the fort to find [[Gol'kosh the Axe]]. Interact with him:
:{{text|say|Gol'kosh the Axe|'Bout time this got here! I was runnin' outta ogres to kill...}}
Follow him outside and take a left turn to the southeast to turn in to Durotan.

==Progression==
{{Siege of Bladespire Fortress}}
