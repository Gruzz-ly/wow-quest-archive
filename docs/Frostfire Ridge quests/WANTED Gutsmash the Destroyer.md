== Objectives ==
Kill Gutsmash the Destroyer in Frostfire Ridge.
*[[Gutsmash the Destroyer]] slain {{co|16.2|41.3|Frostfire Ridge}}
*Suggested Players [3]

== Description ==
Gutsmash has proven to be more than a worthy adversary. Gather a small group together and end his reign of terror once and for all.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 516 rings|Howling Snowdrift Loop|Frostfire Augur Signet|Ogre Belly Chain Link}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|35|40}}
* 20750 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
It looks like Gutsmash is the only bounty available at this time.

== Completion ==
Gutsmash is dead? I'll drink to that. You're alright, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Mopping Up (Frostfire Ridge)]] and [[Slavery and Strife]] before heading out.

Gutsmash is across the bridge and to the west, down the ramp into the valley and then up on top of the tower. Be warned -- he hits HARD. Use the Call to Arms ability and pop CDs.

==Progression==
{{Defense of Wor'gol}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
