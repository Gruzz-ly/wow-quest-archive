==Objectives==
Bring {{Au|Drek'Thar}} to [[Exurotus]], the Fury of Frostfire.
*Bring Drek'Thar to the [[Altar of Kron]]

==Description==
I can feel the voice of the Fury at the top of the ascent. Come, let us climb these stairs together.

Be on your guard. The [[goren]] of this area are likely to be drawn by the smell of a shaman.

If we get separated, fall back to the base of the stairs and regroup.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
*13970 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
I have never been this close to a fury before. I had heard stories, but those were old campfire tales...

==Notes==
On accept, Drek'Thar and Draka join the party. Run up the [[Ascent of Frostfire]], dodging goren all the way up to the [[Altar of Kron]].

==Progression==
