==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ozgor the Necrothurge.jpg|Ozgor the Necrothurge|Kill him and take his All-Seeing Ring.}}
Collect the All-Seeing Ring.
*[[All-Seeing Ring]]

==Description==
The [[Mother of Wolves]] was infected with demon magic. The [[Shadow Council (alternate universe)|Shadow Council]] must have hoped to spread the corruption to the other frost wolves and then to [[Throm'var]].

The hunters are reporting they've seen glowing green eyes down in the [[Icescar Boneyard]] to the west. We both know what that means.

I have an idea... we're going to use the Shadow Council's "eyes" against them to reveal their base. All we need is the lead warlock's All-Seeing Ring.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26}}
*17800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The All-Seeing Ring. Do you have it?

==Completion==
Yes, this will do nicely. Let's use the Shadow Council's magic against them.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stop the Flow]], [[Desecration of the Dead]] and after turning in [[A Clew of Worms]], pick up [[The Sleeper Has Awakened]] before heading out. Head northwest to the [[Icescar Boneyard]]. Start killing [[necrophyte]]s and [[Fel Wolf|fel wolves]], then interact with the summoning circles to destroy them. Ogzor is at the northwest end of the boneyard, with two [[Ogzor's Bones]] skeletal minions.
