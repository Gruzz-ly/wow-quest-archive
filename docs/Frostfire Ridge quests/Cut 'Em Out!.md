==Objectives==
Obtain the materials needed to repair the cloak.
* [[Pristine Clefthoof Hide]] (4)
* [[Sootweed Pitch]] (15)
* [[Bloodstained Skinning Knife]] (provided)

==Description==
After all that you've done for us, I would love to help you. Regrettably, I don't have the materials I would need to repair this perfectly.

Use my knife to gather a few hides from the [[clefthoof]] that roam near the spire and find some sootweed pitch to properly cure them.

Unfortunately, those miserable [[ogre]]s have taken up residence in the only place that I know of sootweed to grow. You may be in for a fight <name>.

Return to me if you can obtain these and I will gladly help you repair your cloak.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|11|40}}

==Progress==
Were you able to obtain the materials, <name>?

==Completion==
You are covered in soot from head to toe, <name>!

As promised, I will help you repair your cloak. I have a few other items here which you might find useful as well.

Come back and see me any time!

==Notes==
Use the skinning knife before looting the clefthoof.
