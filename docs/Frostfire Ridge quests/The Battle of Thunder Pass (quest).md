==Objectives==
Defend [[Frostfire Ridge]] from the [[Iron Horde]].
* Speak with {{Au|Durotan}}.
* Defend Frostfire Ridge from the Iron Horde.

==Description==
The Iron Horde has an army tenfold our number marching down the [[Thunder Pass]] as we speak.

Durotan is amassing our forces at the mouth of the pass. He is doing what he can to mount a defense but war on this scale is not what we [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolves]] are masters of.

He will need your expertise.

Please, go to him.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
{{itembox|Item Level 525 Helm
|Frostwolf Wind-Talker Cowl
|Frostwolf Scout's Cap
|Frostwolf Ringmail Cap
|Frostwolf Stalwart Cap
}}

You will also receive: {{cost|36|60}}
{{itembox|
|q1=100|item1=Garrison Resources
}}

==Completion==
This was a costly victory, and a very painful lesson. We chose to refuse the Iron Horde and live as we always have, but I see now they will never respect such neutrality.

I am not about to wait for the Iron Horde to martial their forces. We will fight with you, and bring the Iron Horde to its knees.

Commander, the Frostwolves stand ready!

==Gains==
*20,960 [[XP]]
*+500 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

:{{text|say|Draka|Come back me up, <name>.}}

Approaching Malgrim:
:{{text|say|Malgrim Stormhand|Look at this cute little puppy you've sent me, Durotan! Does she know any tricks?}}
:{{text|say|Draka|Yes. A few.}}

:{{text|say|Malgrim Stormhand|Draka... come join me in the Iron Horde. Lose that armor, and settle down with a REAL MAN.}}
:{{text|say|Draka|A real man would treat his mate with respect!}}
