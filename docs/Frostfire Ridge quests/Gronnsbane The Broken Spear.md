== Objectives ==
Search throughout [[Magnarok]] for [[Gronnsbane]]'s blade, haft, and weight.
* [[Gronnsbane's Blade]]
* [[Gronnsbane's Haft]]
* [[Gronnsbane's Weight]]

== Description ==
Looking through [[Argoram's Journal|Argoram's journal]], it becomes apparent that claiming this relic will be far more complicated than simply finding the pieces of the spear. However, that would be the best place to start...

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|3|85}}
|Gronnsbane}}

== Completion ==
The pieces come together rather simply to create a large spear, weathered from the ages.

This appears to be the Gronnsbane of legend, however it's power seems to have faded long ago.

* Weight: {{coords|72.5|26.9|Frostfire Ridge}}
