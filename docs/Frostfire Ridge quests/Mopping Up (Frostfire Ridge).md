==Objectives==
Speak with [[Igrimar the Resolute]] at the [[Circle of Blood (Frostfire Ridge)|Circle of Blood]].

==Description==
We've won the day, but our work here is far from finished.

[[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolves]] will scour [[Bladespire Citadel|the citadel]] and root out any survivors. To you, I offer the glory of cleansing the [[gladiator]] pits to the north.

As we launched our attack, we dispatched one of our best to recon that area. If you still thirst for blood, join her there. There's surely some sport left.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
<Igrim winces as you show her {{Au|Durotan}}'s orders.>

Don't look at me like that... ungh... I've survived worse.

==Notes==
Pick up [[WANTED: Gutsmash the Destroyer]] and [[Slavery and Strife]] before heading out.

Head down the ramp to the lower valley, then north into the [[Circle of Blood (Frostfire Ridge)|Circle of Blood]]. Inside one of the buildings is a beaten-up [[Igrimar the Resolute]].

==Progression==
