==Objectives==
Find Iceblister Den and then slay Grosh the Mighty.
*Find [[Iceblister Den]]
*[[Grosh the Mighty]] slain
*[[Vial of "Ogron Be-Gone"]] (provided)

==Description==
Eh boss-mon. Time for us to be huntin' the real prey now. To the north, there be a cave. In the cave, there be right mean ogron dey call "Grosh the Mighty." That [[ogron]] got a big stash of pillaged hides and leathers we gonna be needin' for the troops at the garrison.

I made a special poison from the stuff ya gathered. Dis be a magic poison, and it gonna put that ogron down to sometin' a bit more manageable.

Take these vials to the cave and see if ya can't win us a treasure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*25x[[Garrison Resources]] and {{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Why be killin' five hundred [[clefthoof]] when ya can just kill one big ogron dat killed five hundred clefthoof?

==Completion==
Now dat be a mighty fine haul. We gonna be keepin' all the folks at the garrison warm.

It seemed like a simple task but ya tackled it like a boss-mon. If ya need a shadow hunter in your ranks, I be willin' to serve.

==Notes==
Exit camp and run due north. Just past the [[Ashen Crater]] is a hole in the ground, the mouth of [[Iceblister Den]]. Don't go too far north to the cave marked on the map by the northern flight master.

Inside the main room of the cave, the [[Vial of "Ogron Be-Gone"]] lights up the extra action button. Get within about 40 yards of Grosh and use it, which brings up the ground-targeting reticule. Each usage increases Grosh's damage taken by 120% and reduces it's melee haste by 50%, and stacks up to five times. Even then, Grosh only melees for 2-3k on cloth.

Finish the ogron off and run back to [[Darkspear's Edge]] to turn in.
