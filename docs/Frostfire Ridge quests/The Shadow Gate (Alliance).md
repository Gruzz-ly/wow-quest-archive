==Objectives==
Defeat Grubnor Wargut and follow after [[Borgal Doomfist|Borgal]].
*[[Grubnor Wargut]] slain
*Enter the [[Shadow Gate]]

==Description==
Okay, we're gonna have to be quick. 

I've seen Borgal form magical portals before so he might try to use one to escape. If he does that our only option will be to follow after 'em. On top of that he always keeps his lieutenant [[Grubnor Wargut|Grubnor]] nearby so we may have a bit of a tussle in store.

<Owynn peeks into the cave.>

Keep yer head down, something's going on in there.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Blast it, he's given us the slip!

Ta make things worse the portal looks like it's closed from this side. We're gonna have to find a way to track Borgal down or we might be stuck in wherever this is.

==Progression==
{{Missing Agent}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
