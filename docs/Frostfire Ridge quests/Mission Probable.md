==Objectives==
[[File:Mission Probable - step 2.jpg|thumb|Step 2: Select a follower]]
[[File:Mission Probable - step 3.jpg|thumb|Step 3: Drag the follower to the target and start the mission]]
Use the Command Table to send Olin Umberhide on a mission.
*Use the Command Table to send [[Olin Umberhide]] on a mission

==Description==
Despite his recent captures, Olin Umberhide seems to be a [[tauren]] of some skill in combat. He certainly has learned how to get an enemy's attention.

I have a mission available that might prove ideal for his skill sets.

When you are ready, simply issue the order via the command table in front of me and we will dispatch him immediately.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 18150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Commander, I have a mission that might suit your new follower quite well.

==Completion==
As additional missions come to my attention I will make them available here.

==Notes==
Interact with the Command Table in front of Zog. Click on the mission, then drag Olin Umberhide to the drag target, and finally start the mission, which will take Olin half an hour to complete. Merely starting the mission is enough to complete credit for the quest.

This completes the "Foothold in a Savage Land" portion of [[You'll Get Caught Up In The... Frostfire!]]. Outside, the [[Frostfire Ridge storyline]] continues with [[Den of Wolves]], offered by [[Drek'Thar (alternate universe)|Farseer Drek'Thar]].
