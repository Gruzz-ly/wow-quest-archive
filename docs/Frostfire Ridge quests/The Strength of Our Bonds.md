== Objectives ==
[[File:Karg Bloodfury captured.jpg|thumb|[[Karg Bloodfury]]]]

Find [[Karg Bloodfury]] in [[Grom'gar]].
*Karg Bloodfury located {{co|63.2|60.1|Frostfire Ridge}}

== Description ==
[[Asha]] has passed, but we share a bond that cannot be severed by death. Even now, her spirit urges me onward to Grom'gar.

{{Au|Fenris Wolfbrother|The Iron Wolf}} claims our attachments make us weak... that love makes us vulnerable.

He is wrong.

Karg is my strength, and I his. I will free him from his chains, and together we will show the Thunderlord clan the strength of our bonds.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 525 trinkets|Karg's Hunting Horn|Lokra's Fury|Asha's Fang}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Completion ==
Help me out of these chains. We have work to do.

==Notes==
On accept, Lokra joins the party. Keep running east toward [[Grom'gar]]:
:{{text|say|Lokra|Grom'gar. Built in the corpse of a colossus. Look at the size of that thing...}}
:{{text|say|Lokra|Can you imagine a live colossus? They say this was the last one, and the Thunderlord clan took it down generations ago.}}
In front of the colossus' mouth, [[Karg Bloodfury]] is chained to a stake alongside two dead Frostwolf Warriors.
:{{text|say|Lokra|There he is! Karg!}}
:{{text|say|Karg Bloodfury|Lokra! My love! What are you doing here?!}}
:{{text|say|Lokra|What's it look like? Saving your hide!}}

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Lokra|Where's [[Nerok]]?}}
:{{text|say|Karg Bloodfury|We were separated. Where is Asha?}}
:{{text|say|Lokra|We were... also separated.}}
