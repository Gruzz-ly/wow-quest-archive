== Objectives ==
Slay Master Siegesmith Uratok in [[Grom'gar]].
*[[Master Siegesmith Uratok]] slain {{co|62.4|75.2|Frostfire Ridge}}

== Description ==
Not long ago, the most advanced weapon a Thunderlord could make was a really, really big spear. The Blackrock orcs must have shipped in a fearsome master to have them producing cannons so rapidly.

We need to find that master.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 517 boots|Grom'gar Chain Boots|Grom'gar Wolfskin Slippers|Grom'gar Plate Stompers|Grom'gar Wolfpelt Boots}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Progress ==
Karg is right - this is our best opportunity to cripple Grom'gar's defenses. We do this, then we return to the clan, heads high with pride.

== Completion ==
The Iron Horde combines the strengths of every clan. We must continue looking for ways to sever those connections if we hope to defeat them.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Enfilade]] before heading out. Kill a path south, blowing up cannons along the way. At the south end of the cannon area, find [[Master Siegesmith Uratok]].

This completes the "Beneath Thunder's Fall" portion of [[You'll Get Caught Up In The... Frostfire!]]. The [[Frostfire Ridge storyline]] continues with a breadcrumb back to [[Frostwall]] with [[Return to the Pack]].

Before leaving [[Grom'gar]] to return to the garrison, head south to the [[Southwind Cliffs]]. Find rare air elemental [[Cyclonic Fury]] at roughly {{co|67|78|Frostfire Ridge}} on the east side of the cape. It drops the [[Windburnt Pauldrons]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, find the Buffeting Galefury [[Shamanstone]] at {{co|65.2|79.1|Frostfire Ridge}} next to a rock outcrop further south.

==Progression==
{{Beneath Thunder's Fall}}
