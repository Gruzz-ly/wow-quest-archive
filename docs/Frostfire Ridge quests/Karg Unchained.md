== Objectives ==
Slay 25 Thunderlord orcs in [[Grom'gar]].
*{{Au|Thunderlord clan|Thunderlord}} [[Orc]] slain (25)

== Description ==
They took my brothers and sisters.

They took [[Nerok|my wolf]].

<Karg lifts his axe and fixes his gaze upon its edge.>

Now we take their heads.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Progress ==
By killing them - we take their heads by killing them.

We don't actually need to pick up the heads.

== Completion ==
<Karg scoops up a handful of snow and cleans the gore from his axe.>

You fight well.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Where's My Wolf?!]] before heading out. Don't focus on this quest at the expense of the main chain - there are plenty of orcs to kill on the way between quest targets.

==Progression==
{{Beneath Thunder's Fall}}
