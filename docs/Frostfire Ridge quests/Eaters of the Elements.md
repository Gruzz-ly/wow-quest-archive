== Objectives ==
Defend {{Au|Drek'Thar}} as he performs his ritual.
*First half of ritual complete
*Second half of ritual complete
*Child of the Fury rescued

== Description ==
Drek'Thar has already begun his ritual, and it is powerful enough to draw the attention of the local [[goren]]. Those beasts are drawn to elemental magic like flies to a corpse.

I will have my hands full soon enough. Help us if you like but Drek'Thar must be allowed to finish his ritual.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Completion ==
I came seeking aid from the elements. I see now that we are the ones who must aid them.

Come, <name>, witness what I have witnessed.

On accept:
:{{text|yell|Farseer Drek'Thar|Spirits of the water, I seek your guidance. Spirits of the earth, I seek your strength.}}
:{{text|yell|Draka|Watch out! Goren!}}
Jump down after Draka and stick close to Drek'Thar's Healing Stream Totem.

After the first wave:
:{{text|yell|Farseer Drek'Thar|I... I hear the voice of a Fury!}}
:{{text|yell|Draka|Hear it faster! We are getting swarmed down here.}}

After the second wave:
:{{text|yell|Farseer Drek'Thar|Spirits of fire, I seek ferocity- aaaaah!}}
:{{text|yell|Draka|Drek'Thar! <Name>, cover me.}}
A small wave of goren, followed by a large [[Flaming Goren]].

After the Flaming Goren dies, a fire elemental called Gorelish appears from the goren's corpse:
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Hold, <name>! This is not our enemy.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Come, child. Find safe refuge in my totem.}}

:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|I came to ask the elements for aid in the coming battle.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|But among the burning, biting winds of the mountains I heard the cry of a Fury.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Beaten, half consumed, and shattered by ancient magics, the Fury is the prisoner of the magnaron Kron.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|The Fury has been fragmented, its pieces scattered on the wind or consumed by scavengers.}}
