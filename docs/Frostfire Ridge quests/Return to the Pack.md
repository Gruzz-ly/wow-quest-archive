== Objectives ==
Speak with {{Au|Durotan}} at [[Frostwall|your garrison]].

== Description ==
Part of me agrees with [[Karg Bloodfury|Karg]] - we COULD challenge the {{Au|Fenris Wolfbrother|Iron Wolf}} right now. My fists clench at the mention of his name. My muscles scream for vengeance.

But then, in my heart, I feel [[Asha]]. Calming me. Guiding me. I do not deserve her wisdom, but it is a gift I will not waste.

<[[Lokra]] squints at the sky.>

{{Au|Durotan}} and the others will be gathering at your garrison about now. We should meet them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
* 1380 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Completion ==
Lokra has always lacked the patience and control of her older sister. She approaches problems head-first, and relies on her raw talents to succeed.

Seeing the way her and Karg look at each other, I am not surprised she chased him all the way to [[Grom'gar]]. What surprises me is that they made it back.

As usual, I expect we have you to thank for that. You continue to honor us with your deeds.

== Notes ==
Before leaving [[Grom'gar]] to return to the garrison, head south to the [[Southwind Cliffs]]. Find rare air elemental [[Cyclonic Fury]] at roughly {{co|67|78|Frostfire Ridge}} on the east side of the cape. It drops the [[Windburnt Pauldrons]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, find the Buffeting Galefury [[Shamanstone]] at {{co|65.2|79.1|Frostfire Ridge}} next to a rock outcrop further south.

Don't forget to do the "Ga'nar's Vengeance" chapter of the [[Frostfire Ridge storyline]] that started with [[Ga'nar's Vengeance]] at Bladespire. The zone storyline continues with [[The Iron Wolf (quest)]].

:{{Text|say|Draka|You... wanted her to stay? This is war! More than ever, this is when family belongs at your side!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|I... never looked at it that way.}}
