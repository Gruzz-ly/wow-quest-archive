==Objectives==
Find and rouse the missing Trader. 
*Trader Roused
*[[Mug of Rousing Coffee]] (provided)

==Description==
To pass the time, traders have been known to consume beverages of an inspired nature, if you know what I mean. Sometimes, they drink a bit too much. Your trader might have stumbled beyond the gates and passed out under a tree. It's been known to happen from time to time. Luckily, I have a brew that I use to rouse groggy traders. One splash and I find they're more willing to work.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|15|40}}

==Completion==
You have learned one of my tricks of the trade, <name>.
