==Objectives==
Return to {{Au|Durotan}} at [[Bladespire Citadel]].
*Fly back to Bladespire Citadel {{co|21.6|56.1|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
Durotan must be told of your vision. [[Pul Windcarver]] will offer you a flight back.

The fate of the [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolf]]... of {{Au|Draenor}}, depends upon you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|35|40}}
* 20750 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
Grim news indeed, <name>.

For saving Wolf Home, I would name you wolf-brother.

Now we must defend [[Frostfire Ridge]] from the {{Au|Thunderlord clan}} and the [[Iron Horde]].

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|The elements once spoke to me... now I hear only whispers. Is this our fate, or a warning? Hurry, you must tell Durotan.}}

Outside to the south, [[Gog'rak]] starts a side quest, [[Young Hearts]]. Also, near the flight master, [[Kar'lak]] offers a side quest starting with [[Missing Pack]].

To continue the zone storyline, get to the flight master:
:{{gossip|Pul, I need to quickly return to Bladespire Citadel.}}
Durotan is where he was earlier, on a throne just inside.

This completes the "Defense of Wor'gol" portion of [[You'll Get Caught Up In The... Frostfire!]] achievement. The [[Frostfire Ridge storyline]] continues in two forks with [[Ga'nar's Vengeance]] and [[Securing the South]].

==Progression==
{{Defense of Wor'gol}}
