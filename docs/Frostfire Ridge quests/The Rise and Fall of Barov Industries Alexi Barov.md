"The brothers united once more," [[Weldon Barov|he]] said.

"A [[Draenor (alternate universe)|world]] full of untold riches to plunder," he said.

"Wealth beyond imaging," he said!

And then he proceeded to drop a log on top of me.

"There can only be one CEO of [[Barov Industries]]," he said.

At least we can agree on that...
