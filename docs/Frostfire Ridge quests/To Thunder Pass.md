==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lokra]] at [[Wolf's Stand]].

==Description==
There is no time to mourn our fallen or lick our wounds. Your scouts have already reported sighting a massive [[Iron Horde]] army making its way through [[Thunder Pass]].

I advise you let your [[garrison]] forces secure this area while you and I make for the pass east of here with the rest of the [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolves]].

It is time to show this Iron Horde what a united Frostwolf clan can do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|22}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
I am glad to see you. Our clan has faced many challenges, but the sheer size of the army coming toward us is beyond anything we have attempted to face.

We need your experience.

==Notes==
Should this quest be abandoned or not immediately picked up after [[The Iron Wolf (quest)]], find [[Thrall]] at {{co|20.9|57.9|Frostfire Ridge}} in [[Wor'gol]].

==Progression==
