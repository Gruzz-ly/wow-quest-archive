==Objectives==
Confront Gul'dan.
*Confront [[Gul'dan]]
*[[Giselda the Beautiful]] slain

==Description==
Gul'dan is in the cave further into the [[Gloomspire]].

We know that he's about to leave for [[Talador]] and {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}. You must capture him by any means necessary, <name>.

I'll see you back at [[Throm'var]]. Good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|36|60}}
*20960 [[XP]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Image of Archmage Khadgar|Be careful, my friend. Gul'dan is not to be underestimated no matter how prepared you might be.}}

Run in the cave and foolishly wind up an attack on Gul'dan.
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|WHAT?! I remember you.}}
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|I'm not that easy.}}
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|I won't lower myself to fight you, but, I have an idea.}}
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|Giselda, my beauty, your time has come.}}
:''Realizing what's about to happen, Giselda sprints away from the altar to no avail as Gul'dan throws her back to it.''
:{{text|say|Giselda the Beautiful|What? No....}}
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|Have fun dealing with this.}}
:{{text|yell|Giselda the Beautiful|I'm more beautiful than ever.}}
:''Giselda is transformed into a [[shivarra]] and becomes attackable. Finish her off.''
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|No matter. Soon there will be enough felblood to make thousands for the Burning Legion.}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Do give my regards to Khadgar. I've a present coming for him.}}
:''Gul'dan teleports away.''
Back at the mouth of the cave, the Image of Archmage Khadgar is still there:
:{{text|say|Image of Archmage Khadgar|Unfortunate, but now we know more. You can take the portal back to Throm'var.}}
It's much faster than running back...

==Completion==
Unfortunate, but not surprising. At least we were able to defeat one of the inner council members.

All is not lost, <name>. We know what the Shadow Council is up to and where they're heading.

We'll regroup in Talador. Together, we'll put an end to Teron'gor and his plans for Auchindoun.

Did you hear that?

''On complete, a cutscene, the player is sapped.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Commander, what's wrong?}}
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Khadgar - someone's here!}}
:''Garona sneaks behind Khadgar and attempts to backstab him, but Khadgar pops his Ice Block just in time.''
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|Sorcerous coward.}}
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Assassin!}}
:''Garona and Cordana go at it for a few swings, then Garona leaps back up to a small boulder.''
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|Gul'dan sends his best.}}
:''Garona vanishes.''
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|I knew it. You should've stayed back at the garrison, Archmage.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Nonsense. I had that handled. Cool as a cucumber.}}
