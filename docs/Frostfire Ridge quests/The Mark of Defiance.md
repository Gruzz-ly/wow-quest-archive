== Objectives ==
Use the Battle-Worn Frostwolf Banner on the corpses of 6 Thunderlord Orcs in Agurak's Fall.
*Thunderlord Orc corpses impaled (6)
*[[Battle-Worn Frostwolf Banner]] (provided)

== Description ==
As you look upon the Frostwolf banner you remember struggles that have led you and the Frostwolves to this point.

[[Scout Ruk'Gan|Ruk'Gan]] has suffered in his battles with the Thunderlord and would appreciate an extra show of defiance.

As the banner rustles in the wind you're inspired to mark the foes of the Frostwolf with its standard.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 XP

==Progress==
Anything to report, <name>?

== Completion ==
Good work, <name>!

Seeing Frostwolf banners standing proudly over our crushed foes fills me with pride!

Let them forever fear the wrath of the Frostwolves!

== Notes ==
The Battle-Worn Frostwolf Banner next to Scout Ruk'Gan offers this quest after he leaps away after starting [[Burn Them Down]]. Pick it up before moving out.

Don't forget to plant the banner after killing the orcs. Ruk'Gan is at the southern end of camp.
