==Objectives==
Free 5 Frostwolf Slaves from the [[Sootstained Mining Camp]].
*Free [[Frostwolf Slave]]s (5)
*Find {{Au|Mulverick}} {{co|30.8|41.5|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
We have [[Bladespire Citadel|their citadel]], but they still have some of my people enslaved at the [[Sootstained Mines]].

We have no one to spare, but you seem more than capable of handling a few [[ogre]]s on your own.

I ask that you release any enslaved [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolves]] you find there, and keep an eye out for Mulverick.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Free my people and then we can talk!

==Completion==
Who are you, outsider? I saw you freeing some of my kin...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Mopping Up (Frostfire Ridge)]] and [[WANTED: Gutsmash the Destroyer]] before heading out.

Head down the ramp into the lower valley, then south to the [[Sootstained Mining Camp]]. Under the bridge, [[Gol'kosh the Axe]] offers another quest: [[Slaying Slavers]]. Pick it up before starting to free slaves in the camp.

Just outside the entrance to the mine, on top of a building is a [[Slave's Stash]], which contains {{cost|2}}, 30 [[Garrison Resources]] and 3 [[Half Empty Bottle of Prison Moonshine]].

Mulv is found in the northeastern end of the camp, just past the entrance to the mine proper.

==Progression==
