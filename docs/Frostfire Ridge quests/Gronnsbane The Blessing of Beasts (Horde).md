==Description==
Gronnsbane now pulses with energies of fire and frost. All that remains to restore the full power of the weapon is to receive the Blessing of the Beast. [[Windreader Argoram|Argoram]] believed this could be accomplished by bloodying the weapon against one of the ancient black rylaks of [[Stonefury Cliffs]]. His journal reads: "High in the Stonefury Cliffs, I have seen an altar where the ogres have left offerings to these ancient beasts. Perhaps I could use it to lure one of them"
