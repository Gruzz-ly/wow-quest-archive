== Objectives ==
Kill 12 [[Shadow Council (alternate universe)|Shadow Council]] members at the [[Ruins of Ata'gar]].
*Shadow Council slain × 12

== Description ==
'''Cordana'''

Those ruins are going to be full of Shadow Council flunkies. We can't afford to let them scatter all over {{Au|Draenor}} once you've dealt with [[Gul'dan]].

No, we need to eliminate every one of them down to the last orc.

'''Khadgar'''
These ruins are full of Shadow Council adherents. We can't afford to let them scatter all over Draenor once Gul'dan has been dealt with.

No, we need to eliminate every one of them down to the last orc. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14240 XP

== Completion ==
Necessary business. We don't dare risk letting them grow more powerful.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Every Shadow Council creep we kill now is one less headache later.}}

Pick up [[Have a Heart (quest)]] before heading out. Run west, skirting the south end of the [[Icescar Boneyard]] to cross [[Lashwind Cleft]] and reach the [[Ruins of Ata'gar]].

Don't focus on this quest - work on Khadgar's quests primarily and this one will happen on its own.
