==Objectives==
Collect 10 Drudgeboat Salvage.
*[[Drudgeboat Salvage]] (10)

==Description==
I heard you guys hijacked and wrecked a ship on your way out of [[Tanaan Jungle|Tanaan]].

It's like my daddy always said: One man's wreck is another goblin's [[workshop]].

You should head down to the coast west of the garrison and see if you can't find any materials we might salvage. Oh, and uh... should probably watch yourself. I hear there are ogre raiders in the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*18150 [[XP]]
*60x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
How's the salvage operation comin'?

==Completion==
Hey... now that is some nice salvage. Say what you will about the [[Iron Horde]], but they got some serious raw materials to work with.

Pick up [[What We Got]] from [[Gazlowe]] and [[The Ogron Live?]] from [[Rokhan]] outside before heading out.

Outside the garrison to the west on the [[Burning Glacier]], boxes of [[Drudgeboat Salvage]] can be found all over the area, guarded by [[Bladespire Raider]]s and [[Bladespire Lookout]]s. Additionally, [[Pack Boar]]s likely carry some salvaged gear as well.

On the Burning Glacier, there are three rare mobs, each of whom drops a rare-quality item and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]]:
*[[Gurun]] at {{co|47.1|55.2|Frostfire Ridge}} in the bottom of [[Gurun's Banquet]] to the northwest of the garrison - [[Skog's Drape]]
*[[Chillfang]] at {{co|41.4|68.3|Frostfire Ridge}} in the [[Frostcave]] where the ship crash-landed - [[Bat-Leather Breeches]]
*[[Grutush the Pillager]] {{co|38.6|62.9|Frostfire Ridge}} in the unnamed cave west of the ship - [[Grutush's Fur-Padded Pantaloons]]

At {{co|37.4|60.2|Frostfire Ridge}} at the base of the ogre tower uphill to the northwest from the wrecked ship, find [[Guh]]:
:You kill Guh friends, now who Guh trade with?
*{{gossip|You should trade with me, then.}}
:Guh no think that a good idea.
*{{gossip|Perhaps you could be persuaded to visit my garrison and do some trading?}}
:''Are you sure you want to give Guh some coins?'' {{cost|||10}}
:Strange face-coin, very shiny. Maybe me come visit sometime.
*{{gossip|My fist!}}
:You not very nice.

Choose the payoff option to acquire Guh as a trader at the garrison. Finally, head to the top of that tower to find at {{co|37.3|59.2|Frostfire Ridge}} a chest of [[Raided Loot]] guarded by two [[Bladespire Raider]]s.

==Progression==
{{Foothold in a Savage Land}}
