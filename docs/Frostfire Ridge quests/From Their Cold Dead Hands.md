==Objectives==
Collect 10 Damaged Hexweave from Bladespire Ogres.
*[[Damaged Hexweave]] (10)

==Description==
Those ogres took all of my hexweave!

I kept it hidden at the bottom of my bag. How could they possibly know of its importance?

If they discover even a portion of hexweave's properties, it means trouble for us all.

<Name>, this is a Frostwolf problem. It requires a Frostwolf solution.

Will you help me?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|30}}
*13,690 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Well, is it done?

==Completion==
This looks to be all of the cloth, but it appears that they tried to rip and pull the magic out by physical force. I think I see teeth marks...

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
