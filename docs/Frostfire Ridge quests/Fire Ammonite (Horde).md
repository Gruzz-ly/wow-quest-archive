== Objectives ==
Mak'jin wants you to collect 10 Fire Ammonite Eggs from Frostfire Ridge.
*[[Fire Ammonite Egg]] × 10

== Description ==
We need to stock the garrison pond with local fish. I need you to search the waters in Frostfire Ridge for fish that we can stock up with. Once you have the fish, you will need to slice them up and look for eggs inside.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: [[Pack of Fishing Supplies]], +1 [[Fishing]], {{cost|11|40}}

== Progress ==
Anything biting?

== Completion ==
These will do nicely, <name>! Thank you!

== Notes ==
Catch [[Fire Ammonite]] at most lava pools in [[Frostfire Ridge]], then use the "fish" to fillet them. While on this quest, filleted fish will contain the eggs needed for the quest.
