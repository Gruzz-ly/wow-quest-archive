==Objectives==
Kill 10 Iron Thunderguards within the [[Bones of Agurak]] in [[Frostfire Ridge]].
*[[Iron Thunderguard]] slain (10)

==Description==
The Thunderlord are a blight <name>.

<Ruk'gan{{sic}} spits in disgust.>

My daughter, Grishna, was killed by those monsters. Only their blood will bring me peace now.

If you would help me then I need you to cause a distraction so I can sneak to a position closer to their camp.

Killing a few of their so called "Iron Thunderguard" would be perfect.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Agurak Chain Bracers
|Agurak Wristwraps
|Agurak Wristplates
|Agurak Leather Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have a bodycount for me, <name>?

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>.

Now before we can continue our assault we need to look for any supplies in the area that could help our fight.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Scout Ruk'Gan|Just before you kill them, let 'em scream. It'll make a better distraction.}}
:''Ruk'Gan walks over to the dead orc with an axe in his back.''
:{{text|say|Scout Ruk'Gan|Better not forget my good axe!}}
:''Ruk'Gan recovers the axe and runs east, running east and jumping up the cliff.''

Head south along kill a path to the [[Barbed Thunderlord Spear]], which starts the quest [[Getting the Points]]. Also, any [[Thunderlord Wrangler]] will drop a [[Coil of Sturdy Rope]], which starts the quest [[A Collection of Coils]].

Gather and kill all the things, then find Scout Ruk'Gan stealthed near the draenor giant's hand.
