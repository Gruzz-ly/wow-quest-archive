==Description==
Oh, my goodness!

This is a list of captives, it appears they may be awaiting transfer... or possibly even execution.

There is one name on this list that I do recognize: my master!

I have been awaiting his return, but now it appears that he may have fallen into enemy hands.

This is a disaster! Please, <name>, we must rescue him.

According to the notes, he has been taken to Grom'gar, located far east of here.

One moment... I think I may have just the thing to help you break in undetected...
