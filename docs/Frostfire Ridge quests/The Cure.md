== Objectives ==
[[File:Frostwolf Gladiator.jpg|thumb|[[Frostwolf Gladiator]]]]

Cure 5 Frostwolf Gladiators.
*[[Frostwolf Gladiator]]s Cured × 5

== Description ==
Cowards! A curse on these wretched meatbags!

The Bladespire have always taunted the orc clans by taking our wounded as slaves to fight like dogs in their pits.

In retaliation for our assault they have poisoned their orc prisoners, leaving them to suffer and die an excruciating death.

Only their [[Bladespire Geomancer|geomancers]] carry the [[Winterwasp Antidote|antidote]], traveler. Use it to cure the Frostwolf prisoners.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
We are fortunate you are here to help us against these ogres.

== Completion ==
You have done the Frostwolf Clan a service, traveler. I shall be sure to tell Durotan of your deeds.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Warlord's Guard]] before heading out. Exit the building and head east, killing [[Bladespire Geomancer|geomancers]] and avoiding [[Bladespire Mauler|maulers]] and [[Bladespire Ogron|ogron]].

Also, find [[The Beater]] in a small cave south of the road. It drops [[Beater's Beat Stick]] and some [[Garrison Resources]].

==Progression==
{{Defense of Wor'gol}}
