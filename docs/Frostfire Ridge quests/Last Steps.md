== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Gorr'thog.jpg|Gorr'thog|Lord of Bladespire Citadel.}}
Climb the chain and Kill Gorr'thog.
*Climb the Chain {{co|50.1|31.6|Bladespire Citadel|2}} / {{co|28.0|35.5|Frostfire Ridge}}
*[[Gorr'thog]] slain {{co|44.6|64.5|Bladespire Citadel|3}} / {{co|27.2|36.3|Frostfire Ridge}}

== Description ==
In a rage, [[Ga'nar (alternate universe)|Ga'nar]] ascended to fight Gorr'thog, the ogre king.

He is alone, and the ramp to the throne room is now blocked.

You've proven resourceful. Perhaps you could find another way up?

I sustained wounds on my way here, but I will work to cut my way through and up the ramp so we may rejoin.

Hurry traveler, ensure that the Frostwolf clan wins our assault on the citadel.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 512 belts|Frostwolf Wind-Talker Cord|Frostwolf Scout's Belt|Frostwolf Ringmail Belt|Frostwolf Stalwart Girdle}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

== Completion ==
We called you outsider, <race>, but you have shown the strength and heart of a Frostwolf.

== Notes ==
[[File:Last Steps - Climbing Ladder.jpg|thumb|Climbing Ladder]]
On accept:
:{{text|say|Thrall|It is up to you, champion. I will stay here and help with the wounded slaves you rescued.}}
Interact with the [[Climbing Ladder]] behind Durotan and Thrall to start a cutscene with the player tiptoeing up the chains:
:{{text|say|Gorr'thog|Furious little orcling!}}
:{{text|say|Gorr'thog|In your blind rage you rush to face my ogres alone.}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|I'll drown you in the blood of your puny army!}}
:{{text|say|Gorr'thog|They will end you, lone little wolf.}}
:{{text|say|Gorr'thog|Your conquered clan will fill my slave pens...}}
:''The player tip-toes up behind Gorr'thog as the cutscene ends.''

Don't stand in the molten pools and dodge the earthshards.

At 50%:
:{{text|yell|Gorr'thog|You are tiny, useless insects!}}

Once Gorr'thog falls, Durotan makes it up the ramp and clears out the imperions attacking Ga'nar.
:{{text|emote|Ga'nar spits blood.}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|The citadel is ours! Come, brother - we press the attack!}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|No, Ga'nar. We are surrounded and exposed. We must fortify.}}
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|Bah. You are too cautious. I will gather our warriors and do it myself!}}
:''Ga'nar runs down the ramp.''
:{{text|say|Durotan|Reckless brother!}}
