==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Groog.jpg|Groog|The Slave Maker}}
Slay Groog.
*[[Groog]] slain {{co|42.1|59.3|Frostfire Ridge}}

==Description==
Commander, our [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf]] allies reportin' dat the Bladespire ogres have an outpost to our west led by an [[ogron]].

I heard tales of da ogron but never seen one. Dey be brutes, creatures from a time that was best left forgotten. Dey say most were slain during the forming of the original horde. What dey lack in wisdom they make up for in violence, force, and greed.

I counsel dispatchin' dis creature as soon as possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*18150 [[XP]]
*45x[[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
Where the ogron goes, death and pain are sure to follow.

==Completion==
Well done, boss-mon. The Bladespire ogres been pullin' back their raiding parties. But ya can bet dey be comin' back, and in larger numbers. The threat from [[Bladespire Citadel|their citadel]] must be dealt with soon.

==Notes==
Pick up [[What We Got]] and [[What We Need]] from [[Gazlowe]]. 

Out on the [[Burning Glacier]], due north of the shipwreck, is an ogre camp in the shadow of the cliff. That camp guards the mouth of the [[Raider's Hideout]] cave. At the back of the cave is [[Groog]], an ogron.

On the Burning Glacier, there are three rare mobs, each of whom drops a rare-quality item and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]]:
*[[Gurun]] at {{co|47.1|55.2|Frostfire Ridge}} in the bottom of [[Gurun's Banquet]] to the northwest of the garrison - [[Skog's Drape]]
*[[Chillfang]] at {{co|41.4|68.3|Frostfire Ridge}} in the [[Frostcave]] where the ship crash-landed - [[Bat-Leather Breeches]]
*[[Grutush the Pillager]] {{co|38.6|62.9|Frostfire Ridge}} in the unnamed cave west of the ship - [[Grutush's Fur-Padded Pantaloons]]

At {{co|37.4|60.2|Frostfire Ridge}} at the base of the ogre tower uphill to the northwest from the wrecked ship, find [[Guh]]:
:You kill Guh friends, now who Guh trade with?
*{{gossip|You should trade with me, then.}}
:Guh no think that a good idea.
*{{gossip|Perhaps you could be persuaded to visit my garrison and do some trading?}}
:''Are you sure you want to give Guh some coins?'' {{cost|||10}}
:Strange face-coin, very shiny. Maybe me come visit sometime.
*{{gossip|My fist!}}
:You not very nice.

Choose the payoff option to acquire Guh as a trader at the garrison. Finally, head to the top of that tower to find at {{co|37.3|59.2|Frostfire Ridge}} a chest of [[Raided Loot]] guarded by two [[Bladespire Raider]]s.
