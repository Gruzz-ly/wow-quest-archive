==Objectives==
Defeat the ancient black [[rylak]] and douse [[:Gronnsbane]] in its blood.
*Lure and kill an ancient black rylak
*[[Empowered Gronnsbane]]

==Description==
Gronnsbane now pulses with energies of fire and frost. All that remains to restore the full power of the weapon is to receive the Blessing of the Beast. [[Windreader Argoram|Argoram]] believed this could be accomplished by bloodying the weapon against one of the ancient black rylaks of [[Stonefury Cliffs]]. His journal reads: "High in the Stonefury Cliffs, I have seen an altar where the ogres have left offerings to these ancient beasts. Perhaps I could use it to lure one of them"

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|150||22}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you returned with the Thunderlords' relic?

==Completion==
Who would've thought that such a normal looking spear would be able to take down a full-sized [[Gronn]]? 

I'm sure [[Harrison Jones|Dr. Jones]] will appreciate this in his collection.

==Progression==
{{The Thunderlord Sage}}
