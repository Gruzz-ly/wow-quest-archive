==Objectives==
Defeat Kron.
*[[Kron]] slain

==Description==
The moment I begin the ritual to free [[Exurotus]] it is sure to draw Kron to us.

It would normally take an army of seasoned warriors to defeat a [[magnaron]]. Today, there is only the three of us.

Look for my fire totem upon the battlefield. I will try to gain what boons I can from Exurotus. Step near the totems and become one with the Fury.

With these boons, slay Kron! Lok'tar ogar!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Firefury Totem}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
With Kron defeated I can finish breaching the magic that holds Exurotus, but I may already be too late. So much of the fury has already been expended and drained by the magnaron and goren.

I fear we may have only bought this spirit a peaceful death.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Draka|Kron is coming! Champion, with me.}}
*{{text|say|Kron|Our work is vital to the world.}}
*{{text|say|Kron|You cannot defy the Great Work.}}
[[Kron]] is a level 93 elite [[magnaron]] with 1.3 million health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|The First Axe|range=5-30|Deals 300 Physical damage to all enemies within 30 yards of the impact location.|notes=2.5 sec cast. Deals damage in a 45-degree arc 35 yards out. Hits for around 12,000 Physical}}
*{{abilities|Magnetic Stomp|Crushes nearby enemies, inflicting Physical damage to all enemies in front of the caster.|cd=8 sec|notes=2.75 sec cast.}}
*{{abilities|Giant Stomp|Crushes nearby enemies, inflicting Physical damage to all enemies in front of the caster.|cd=8 sec|notes=2.75 sec cast.}}

During the fight, Farseer Drek'Thar will launch a totem within 15 yards of the player:
*{{text|yell|Farseer Drek'Thar|Hero, approach my totem for aid!}}
*{{text|yell|Farseer Drek'Thar|My totem will empower you!}}
*{{text|yell|Farseer Drek'Thar|Stand nearby to use my totems strength!}}
*{{text|yell|Farseer Drek'Thar|Stand beside my totem to gain its power!}}
Standing in the totem's area of effect adds a stacking buff, increasing damage dealt by 600% each stack!

At 50%, Thrall runs in to help alongside two frostwolves, [[Wise-ear]] and [[Whitefang]]:
*{{text|say|Kron|You do not understand the Great Work.}}
*{{text|say|Kron|This is the way of things. You cannot stop it.}}
:{{text|yell|Thrall|Champion! I heard Drek'Thar's call. I am with you!}}

On death:
:{{text|say|Kron|You do not understand... You cannot know...}}
Thrall offers the followup quest, [[Ours is the Fury]], but a script event plays out on complete:
:{{text|say|Thrall|The fury is dying. We don't have much time.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|There might be something. Exurotus, I offer my spirit as host to your own. Join with me, so that your fire may not be quenched.}}
:{{text|emote|Exurotus rumbles in assent.}}
:{{text|yell|Farseer Drek'Thar|MY SPIRIT... BURNS!}}
:{{text|say|Draka|Drek'Thar, what has it done to you?}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|He has become one with the fury. Their spirits are now merged.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|I... I can see. I can see the shift of the elements, the movement of the spirits trhough the land. It is glorious.}}

==Progression==
