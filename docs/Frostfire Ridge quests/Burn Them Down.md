[[File:West Incubator Cage.jpg|thumb|West Incubator Cage]]
[[File:South Incubator Cage.jpg|thumb|South Incubator Cage]]

Burn down the Thunderlord Rylak Incubators within [[Agurak's Fall]].
*[[North Incubator Cage]] Destroyed
*[[West Incubator Cage]] Destroyed
*[[South Incubator Cage]] Destroyed
*[[Sticky Tarbomb]] (provided)

== Description ==
Now, we begin our assault, <name>!

Get down to Agurak's Fall and use these tarbombs to destroy their rylak egg incubators.

While you are busy I will sneak down into their camp and prepare for the next phase of our attack. Meet me there once you have burned everything.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
* 13970 XP

==Progress==
I don't have time for this. Stay focused on the job <name>!

==Completion==
Good job, <name>. I was able to use the commotion from your work to sneak into the camp.

Now we have only one thing left to do.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Scout Ruk'Gan|I'll sneak into the camp. When you finish, I'll meet you at the rendezvous point I marked on your map.}}

The [[Battle-Worn Frostwolf Banner]] starts a quest too. Pick up [[The Mark of Defiance]] before heading out.

Follow the path immediately north of Ruk'Gan's former position west, then south in to the camp. The northern cage is off to the right before heading downhill into camp proper. The western cage is west of the house by the pig pens, and the southern cage is not too far from the southern end of camp, which is also where Ruk'Gan can be found.

==Progression==
