==Notes==
''On accept'':

:{{text|yell|Ga'nar|Lok'tar ogar!}}
Pick up [[They Rely on Numbers]] before heading out. Additionally, the rare elite [[Canyon Icemother]] is just to the northwest. She drops [[Icemother Milk]] and some [[Garrison Resources]]. On the rock immediately above the icemother is the [[Thunderlord Cache]], which contains the [[Thunderlord Longspear]] and some more Garrison Resources.

In the camp, Frostwolf Greyfurs and Frost Wolves are attacking [[Thunderlord Spearhand]]s. Feel free to use them to help out.

[[Kur'ak the Binder]] is patrolling in front of the first big building on the right. Behind that building are some Thunderlord ballistae with barrels of Blackrock Powder near them. Interact with the balliastae for some explosions.

Further up the hill to the left, is rare mob [[Yaga the Scarred]], with her two boars [[Severmaw]] and [[Bloody Tusk]]. Yaga drops [[Yaga's Trophy Belt]] and some [[Garrison Resources]]. On the opposite (south) side of the cliff face, follow the [[Ogre Wayguide]]s to the [[Smoldering True Iron Deposit]] near a lava pool, and [[Primalist Mur'og]] and the Touched By Fire [[Shamanstone]] at the top of the path. Mur'og drops the [[Ritual Leggings of Mur'og]].

Across the way from Yaga's position is a cave called the [[Gronnstalkers' Cache]]. The supplies are inside, guarded by a provisioner and some spearhands. Kill a path east to the [[Savage Crag]] once the supplies have been exploded. Near the Savage Crag, keep an eye out for a set of spears at {{co|42.7|31.6|Frostfire Ridge}} stuck in the southern cliff face. Jump up them to access the [[Crag-Leaper's Cache]], which contains more Garrison Resources and the [[Crag-Leaping Boots]].
