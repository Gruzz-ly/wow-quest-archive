==Objectives==
Slay [[Kadar]]'s killer and retrieve the book.
*[[Or'Nak]] slain
*[[Book of Alchemical Secrets]]

==Description==
I will avenge my master and retrieve her life's work. Honor demands it. My heart yearns for it. If I die trying, so be it. The murderer will pay.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*1370 [[XP]]
*[[A Treatise on the Alchemy of Draenor]]
*[[Alchemy Lab, Level 1]]

==Progress==
The murderer will pay.

==Completion==
My heart is furious with you for stealing my kill, but my mind knows that I did not have the strength to avenge my master myself. I will forgive you, if you allow me to pay my debt of honor.

==Notes and trivia==
*Stay on the northern ledge above the [[Boneslag]] and head northeast. Near some [[unbound fire elemental]]s is [[Or'Nak]]. Kill her and loot the [[Book of Alchemical Secrets]] from her corpse.
*During the beta, the quest was followed by [[Ang'kra, the Alchemist]].
