==Objectives==
Investigate [[Talandra Dawnsprite|Talandra]]'s home in [[Windrunner Village]].
* [[Stained Tool Rack|First clue]] found
* [[Suspicious Urn|Second clue]] found
* [[Well-Loved Tome|Final clue]] found

==Description==
That woman, that '[[apothecary]]', has snared you in one of her schemes.

I'd be careful around her, <class>. Rumors travel like wildfire in [[Eversong Woods|Eversong]]. And while I would never disparage a fellow artisan of Eversong without cause, I have heard enough rumors to know that your apothecary deals in more than simple herbs.

Take your wine and your reagents, I suppose. But before you pass them off to your patroness, I'd recommend doing some digging--lest you find yourself wrapped up in something you come to regret.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
