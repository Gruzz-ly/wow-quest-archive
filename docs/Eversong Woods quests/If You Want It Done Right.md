==Objectives==
Slay 8 Ornery Sweepers.
* [[Ornery Sweeper]] slain (8)

==Description==
With all the problems facing [[Eversong Woods|Eversong]], the [[Farstriders]] have their hands full!

I'm a capable [[arcanist]]. I've always admired the Farstriders--why not lend my talents to their cause? They do so much work by hand, when a bit of [[magic]] would allow them so much more time for adventuring!

Alas, my enchanted broom idea has not quite gone as I'd hoped. They're so ornery, they end up attacking the recruits instead of cleaning!

Perhaps this is a problem for elbow grease after all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
