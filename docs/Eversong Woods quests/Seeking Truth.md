==Objectives==
Defend Orweyna.
*Speak with Orweyna
*Defend Orweyna
*Regroup with Orweyna east of [[Runestone Falithas]].

==Description==
I will channel on this strange seed we have collected, and see if I can discover what has happened here.

This may upset the rutaani. Make sure I am not interrupted. This is why I was called here--I know now. But I must discover what needs to be done.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Sash of Herbicide]]
* [[Belt of Herbicide]]
* [[Waistguard of Herbicide]]
* [[Girdle of Herbicide]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*16,390 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The rutaani are trying to spread the growth of the lightbloom as far and wide as possible. But why?

==Notes==
Speak to Orweyna:
{{dialogue|I have been called here for a reason.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready when you are.}}

{{gossip|What are the rutaani?}}

{{dialogue-child|The rutaani are as they appear--humanoid, but made entirely of plant life. They are native to my home. As far as I know, they have never visited the surface... until now.

And these rutaani seem different than the ones I know. Changed. Altered. It worries me.}}
}}
:''Orweyna and Arator walk towards the runestone.''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The rutaani... they are being driven to grow. This Light you speak of may be the cause}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|I thought the Lightbloom could aid the Vanguard... but were they the ones to cause this?}}
:''Orweyna begins to perform a ritual.''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|This is wrong. All wrong.}}

Protect Orweyna by slaying the [[Lightbloom Ent]], two [[Rutanni Fighter]]s, and a [[Rutanni Leafmancer]].
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|We need to report back to Silvermoon. They need to know about this.}}
