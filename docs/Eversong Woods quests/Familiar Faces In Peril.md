==Objectives==
Find Apothecary Enith, Apprentice Varnis, and Ranger Vedoran in [[Daggerspine Landing]].
* [[Apothecary Enith]] rescued
* [[Apprentice Varnis]] rescued
* [[Ranger Vedoran]] rescued

==Description==
Fair winds guide your steps. My wish has come true--[[Eversong Woods|Eversong]] flourishes. But like before, evil threatens all that is good.

Two townsfolk are unaccounted for since the [[naga]] arrived. Enith, [[Goldenmist Village|Goldenmist]]'s most curious [[apothecary]]. And Varnis--he's a student visiting from [[Silvermoon City|the city]]. It is my charge to find them.

My fellow ranger Vedoran must still be in the field. I wonder if he's found something important. Will you keep an eye out for him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
It is a relief to know they are safe and sound. I hope Varnis will be all right. I saw him scamper back, face as white as a ghost, refusing to speak. He gathered his things and left.

Thank you, <name>. I hope no other villagers will be tempted to enter the naga's base!

==Notes==
Make sure you accept [[Daggers in My Spine]] from [[Hathvelion Sungaze]], & [[One Elf's Trash, Another Elf's Treasure]] from [[Numia Golden]].

Head to [[Daggerspine Landing]] speak to [[Apothecary Enith|Apothecarist Enith]]
{{Dialogue|Ah! If you've spotted me, then the effects of my stealth potion must be wearing off. I must be going then. I'm glad you found me first.

I've stolen samples of their arcana--for investigation, of course. This should be enough...

:{{Text|Say|Apothecarist Enith|I hope you'll visit my lounge in town.}}

Head to [[Ranger Vedoran]] who is spying on the naga and speak to him.
{{Dialogue|Did Captain Sungaze send you? Oh, he must be worried sick.

I don't think he's going to feel any better after I deliver my findings.

The naga are gathering arcana from various sources and amassing it here... clearly some of them are using it to empower themselves, but the vast majority of arcana is getting shipped out to sea.

To where and to whom, only time will tell.

}}
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Vedoran|I must report back to Hathvelion.}}

Head to [[Apprentice Varnis]] who is cowering in a tent and speak to him.
{{Dialogue|I-I-I made a grave miscalculation!

In this time of great darkness. I thought we were all doomed... that perhaps the naga had the keys to survival.

They don't want to share any of their power. I get that now. I don't know why they kept me alive--please, get me out!

{{Gossip|quest=|Get to safety.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Apprentice Varnis|Safe, again... but for how long?}}

Finish the other two quests and return to [[Hathvelion Sungaze]] and the party who are now with everyone rescued.
:{{Text|Say|Apothecarist Enith|The naga have more than enough arcana to launch a devastating attack on the village.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Vedoran|But they're not. They're consuming some of it, but shipping the rest out to the Great Sea.}}

Upon completion, 
:{{Text|Say|Numia Golden|Enith, the captain's patched up. Let's study these samples you've brought back.}}
:''Numia & Enith begins to walk away.''
:{{Text|Say|Numia Golden|Captain, don't be a hero for the next twenty four hours, please. Rest, have a drink. If the pain gets worse, find me immediately.}}
