* Place the [[Depleted Wardbreaker|Wardbreaker]]
* [[Thrumming Amulet]] disenchanted
* [[Arcane Sword]] disenchanted
* [[Basket of Spell Reagents|Spell Reagents]] disenchanted
* [[Recharged Wardbreaker]]

==Description==
I told [[Zanien]] here the whole story. He's been training [[warlock]]s for a long time--and if anyone hates sloppy ones, it's him.

He's confident he can get the Wardbreaker recharged. Follow his instructions and we should be good to head out afterward.

You will receive:
