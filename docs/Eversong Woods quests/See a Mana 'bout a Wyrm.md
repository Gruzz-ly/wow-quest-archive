==Objectives==
Aggressively assist 8 Agitated Wyrms with their molting.
* [[Agitated Wyrm]]s Assisted (8)
* Return to [[Ranger Astarae]]
* [[Mysterious Bloom]]

==Description==
[[Mana wyrm]]s may not be as glamorous as [[lynx]] or [[hawkstrider]]s, but they're crucial to keeping [[magic]] flowing through the forest.

They congregate to the [[ley line]]s to molt, but sometimes they get a little agitated. And we have to help them out! Aggressively!

I've set up some Ley Channels to get things started. Find wyrms that look like they could use a little help, and beat them up until they shed their arcane carapace. Don't worry, all that mana returns to the forest eventually!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
