==Objectives==
Return to [[Silvermoon]].

==Description==
The [[Light]] takes many forms. I know now what it means to me, and how I want to wield it.

I'm not just a weapon like [[Turalyon|my father]], nor can I devote myself purely to service like [[Sunwalker Dezco|Dezco]].

But I can protect people, from the evil that threatens them. Right now that's [[Xal'atath]] and her [[Devouring Host]].

We should return to Lor'themar, and do whatever is needed to defeat the Void.

Beyond that, I shall see where protecting others with the Light takes me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This really is quite a place, isn't it, <name>?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>, for bolstering our defenders at the Sunwell.

It looks like Arator has sorted things out as well, and is ready for whatever may be ahead.

Good to have you both focused on the fight against the Void again.

Good. Arator is a good man. I'm grateful we didn't lose him to this conflict.

==Notes==

:''Eitrigg, [[Kurdran Wildhammer]], [[Danath Trollbane]], and Arator begin to walk out in different directions.''

Return to Silvermoon and walk to Lor'themar.
