==Objectives==
Clear out 5 Messy Nests and sweep up 5 Dusty Webs.
* [[Messy Nest|Nests]] Cleared (5)
* [[Dusty Web|Webs]] Swept (5)

==Description==
[[Captain Dawnrunner]] is fine, thank the Sun. The only danger was... we didn't keep up on our chores.

It's not heroic, it's not romantic, but we can't go on with [[Farstrider Enclave]] in this state. The [[Elven rangers|rangers]] here are overwhelmed-- we can all pitch in to help them get it cleaned up again.

I can't believe it all comes back to sweeping. That's what being a [[Farstriders|Farstrider]] is really about.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
