==Objectives==
Accompany Arator to meet with [[Magister Umbric]] in Tranquillien.
*Meet Arator on the road to Tranquillien.
*Stay awhile and listen to [[Orweyna]] (Optional)
*Mysterious corpse examined.

==Description==
[[Magister Umbric]]--he's second only to [[Alleria Windrunner|mother]] in mastering the [[Void]]. I'm sure he'll be able to help... if he can forgive the others for not listening to him in the first place.

There seems to be much of that going around.

Never mind. The last I heard, the void elves have temporarily settled in what remains of [[Windrunner Village]]. I suppose [[Tranquillien]] was more open to believing Umbric's intentions. Let's find out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,650[[XP]]

==Progess==
Have Lor'themar and the others seen reason, then?

==Completion==
No...

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|We have solved nothing. These rutaani have been changed. I must return to [[Harandar]] and investigate.}}

Orweyna has a {{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I'll go on ahead--catch up when you can.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|There is tension between Arator and his elders. I understand this well.}}
:''Arator summons his Charger''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I may not be welcome, where I hail from. To leave, to work with outsiders... the idea did not sit well with my elders.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|But we cannot hope to save our world by hiding from it. My goddess called. I had to answer.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Arator--I did not expect to find such similarities with those of the surface world.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Perhaps... of all things, truth is the hardest to see.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I know nothing of what threatens from the sky. But I know much of what threatens from below.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I will continue to explore this. When you are ready to examine the root of the issue, return to me.}}

Head to [[Elrendar River]] and meet up with Arator who is kneeling before a [[Mysterious Corpse]].
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Hold, <Name>. There's a body here. What's that clutched in her hand?}}

Examine the corpse and receive the [[Despoiled Notes]].
:{{Text|Say|Arator|A notebook? So many pages missing... strange. Let's get to Umbric. He'll want to know.}}

Head to Tranquillien as Arator is telling Magister Umbric and [[Lord Antenorian]] what has happened.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|One of my own, dead? How could this happen?}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|These notes... Kasiea? No!}}
