==Objectives==
Contact Silvermoon.
*Contact [[Silvermoon]]
*Find [[Lady Liadrin]] at [[Suncrown]]'s Southern gate.

==Description==
This is dire. The Twilight's Blade is much larger, much more powerful than any of us could have guessed.

I'm glad Umbric is on the case, but we need to let Silvermoon know what's happened here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,650[[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm glad you're here. I wish it were under better circumstances.
