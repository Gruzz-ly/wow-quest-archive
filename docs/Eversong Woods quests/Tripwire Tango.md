==Objectives==
Disarm the mechanism and retrieve the documents from inside the chest.
* Trap mechanism disarmed
* [[Stolen Documents]]

==Description==
This cache isn't locked with [[magic]]. It's craftsmanship. I can hear the mechanism ticking inside. Tiny cogwheels, tension springs, and probably a poison vial ready to shatter the moment someone tries to pick the lock.

We'll have to do this together. I'll take the pins, you keep the mechanism from snapping. One wrong move and it'll be enough to drop an [[ogre]] in mid-charge. Steady now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Easy does it.

==Completion==
This is vital information. No wonder they went to such lengths to protect it.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|I'll handle the lock. You deal with the trap.}}

Interact with the [[Locked Strongbox]] and you enter a cog mini-game.

Find the one cog that is moving in the opposite direction.

Select the third cog in round 1, the fourth in round 2, and the first in round 1.
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|No clicks, no clouds of poison--nicely done. Let's see what's inside.}}

Open the [[Unlocked Strongbox]] and take the Stolen Documents.
