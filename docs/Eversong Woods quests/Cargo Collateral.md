==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Smuggled Crates in [[Sunset Strand]].
* [[Smuggled Cargo]] destroyed (5)

==Description==
If the [[naga]] manage to siphon the remaining [[arcane]] energy from those unstable arcana, they will gain the very power they seek.

Destroy, incinerate, shatter them, do whatever is necessary. Ensure not a single shard remains for the naga or [[Tideborne]] to exploit. I do not wish to see even the faintest trace of arcane energy linger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You did what was required. If the cargo is gone, that is a victory--but our work is far from over.

The Tideborne must still answer for their actions.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Cargo Collateral''' & [[Dead to Rights]],
:{{Text|Say|Lyssara Duskmourne|Follow their trail down the hill. I suspect they will not be happy to see us.}}

Destroy 5 Smuggled Cargo across the Sunset Strand and then meet up with Lyssara to turn in both quests.
