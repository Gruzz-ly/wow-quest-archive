==Objectives==
Investigate Shipping Companies in [[Fairbreeze Village]].
*Find a place to eavesdrop on [[Sunrun Salvage]]
*Find a place to eavesdrop on [[Duskflight Exports]]
*Find a place to eavesdrop on [[Tideborne Freight]]
*[[Abandoned Note]]

==Description==
The [[Sunwell]]'s radiance may shine, but its [[Light]] has not purged the filth that festers within this city. Smugglers scuttle through the streets like vermin, preying upon the desperate and enriching the spineless.

Yet, there are whispers of something fouler still--trade in wares so vile that even the [[Venture Company]] would recoil. I require someone to spy on each shipping company and find out which cloaks a smuggling ring.

Will you stand with me, or will you turn away as the rot spreads?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*5,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So, what did our fine dockworkers have to say?

==Completion==
Ah, a note on 'special cargo.' How delightfully subtle--about as discreet as a goblin's pyrotechnics.

It seems the Tideborne are entangled in this mess, and we have little choice but to wade in after them. If that means diving into the depths--so be it.

==Notes==
;Upon nearing Lyssara Duskmourne,
:{{Text|Say|Lyssara Duskmourne|The shadows hang long with the crimes of the meek...}}

;Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lyssara Duskmourne|Go seek out which company has soiled these shores. Meet me back here once you are don.}}

Head to the Sunrun Salvage use the [[Hidding Bush]] to eavesdrop on [[Kylua Solguard]] and [[Leoron Summersong]].
:{{Text|Say|Kylua Solguard|Did you hear that Duskflight Exports is docked in port currently?}}
:{{Text|Say|Leoron Summersong|Best not get involved with them. Their lips are looser than [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]]'s coinpurse.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kylua Solguard|Mmm. I'd hate for them to indulge in idle gossip at our expense.}}

Head to the Duskflight Exports and click on the armor stand to eavesdrop on [[Vyean Lightstar]] and [[Ineilian Crimsonpost]].
:{{Text|Say|Vyean Lightstar|Ever met a Tideborne crew that wasn't drowning in secrets?}}
:{{Text|Say|Ineilian Crimsonpost|Their books are clean, but their dealings stink worse than bilge water.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vyean Lightstar|Funny how their cargo vanishes the moment someone starts asking.}}

Head to the Tideborne Freight and click on a cardboard bush and eavesdrop on [[Elenda Morrowflare]] and [[Drair Somberfall]]
:{{Text|Say|Elenda Morrowflare|Did you read the note? It seems we have another... engagement to attend to.}}
:{{Text|Say|Drair Somberfall|Indeed. We must return to the docks swiftly, before the light fades.}}
:{{Text|Say|Elenda Morrowflare|Quite so. The less we dawdle, the better for all involved.}}

Head to the building the two elves left and loot the [[Dropped Note]] to take the Abandoned Note.
