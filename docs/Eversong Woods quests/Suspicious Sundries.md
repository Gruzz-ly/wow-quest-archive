* [[Flask of Dragon's Blood]]
* [[Bottle of Magister's Reserve]]

==Description==
Forgive me for my failure to provide specifics, traveler. The [[Potent Mournbat Venom|mournbat venom]] and the [[Pristine Graveblossom|graveblossoms]] were only the first of the reagents I require for my associate's medication.

Luckily, the final few things I require can all be easily obtained in Goldenmist Village, to the north. Be a dear and fetch these last few things for me, won't you? With these, my toil will be nearly complete.

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
