==Objectives==
Find the missing Hawkstrider Fledgling at [[Stillwhisper Pond]].
*[[Beeps|Hawkstrider Fledgling]] sent back

==Description==
One of my hatchlings was frightened off when that giant construct marched past the ranch. He bolted right through the fence and into the woods before I could stop him!

He's small, fast, and probably hiding somewhere nearby. Please find him before something else does, and return him to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. I'll have that fence reinforced so he can't run off again.

==Notes==
Upon accepting '''One Adventurous Hatchling''', [[A Hungry Flock]], & [[A Roost-ed Development]],
:{{Text|Say|Vaelith Sunplume|The pond lies to the south. Good luck out there, <class>.}}

Head to the [[Stillwhisper Pond]] where two [[Puzzled Bystander]]s are chatting about the [[Lost Hawkstrider Fledgling]]
:{{Text|Say|Puzzled Bystander|I don't know if it wants a nibble or thinks the cupcake is its sibling.}}
:{{Text|Say|Puzzled Bystander|Careful. Last time this happened to me, I ended up adopting the little rascal.}}

Send the Fledgling out,
:{{Text|Say|Puzzled Bystander|Well that was a speedy goodbye!}}

Return to [[Thuron's Livery]] and turn in three quests.
