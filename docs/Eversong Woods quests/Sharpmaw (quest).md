==Description==
These horrible beasts are ruining the tranquility of my town!

The worst of the lot is a lynx we've started to call Sharpmaw. She's eaten pets and threatened small children! It's only a matter of time before she tastes elven flesh and craves more!

Stop her before she starts attacking my people in earnest!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Lynxslayer's Stitched Mitts]]
*[[Lynxslayer's Leather Gloves]]
*[[Lynxslayer's Scale Grips]]
*[[Lynxslayer's Reinforced Gauntlets]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,295 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you killed that beast yet?

==Completion==
A what? Plant monster? Well... good riddance, to both it and Sharpmaw. You have our gratitude.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting '''Sharpmaw''', [[Fairbreeze Favors]], & [[Displaced Denizens]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|Magistrix, when did you first begin seeing these disturbances with this Lightbloom?}}
:{{Text|Say|Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider|Hmm, perhaps when the Sunwell blew sky high into that swirling vortex? ...sorry. I'm a bit overwhelmed.}}

Head to the south-east of the village and you came across the corpse of Sharpmaw. Interact with it to examine the dead body.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator]]|She's been slain? But how--look out!}}

Slay the [[Murderous Lightbloom Flydra]].
:{{Text|Say|Arator|That creature must have come from the Lightbloom! We should let the Magistrix know.}}
