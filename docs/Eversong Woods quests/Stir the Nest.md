==Objectives==
Question 8 Row Rats about [[Jaeth]]'s whereabouts.
* [[Row Rat]]s questioned (8)
* [[Duplicate Documents]]

==Description==
[[Magister Aradis|Aradis]] told you the blackmail was false? Of course. He is vying for my position. These receipts would ruin him.

He is a [[warlock]] and we have rules about [[fel]] [[magic]]. It is not banned, but it must be used discreetly. Aradis is not discreet. Magic misuse, unsanctioned [[demon]]s, fel smuggling, bribery... His list of crimes is long.

But you need not take my word for it. Aradis has earned many enemies in the [[Silvermoon City|city]]. If you can find him in the [[Murder Row|Row]], a man named Jaeth could tell you all about our dear warlock.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
