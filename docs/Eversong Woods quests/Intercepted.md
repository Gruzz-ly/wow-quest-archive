==Objectives==
Collect 6 Cult Orders from the Twilight's Blade camp at Speaker's Rest.
*[[Cult Orders (Zul'Aman)]] (6)

==Description==
The Twilight's Blade hit Tranquillien hard. Slipped in and took all the supplies and information they could ever need, right beneath everyone's nose.

Time to return the favor.

I've marked a few tents. Command posts, messengers' satchels, a supply ledger tucked under a wine crate. That's where they keep their orders, maps, and routes.

Grab everything you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The right scrap of parchment can win a war. Or start one.

==Completion==
Now this is useful. Let's see how well their little operation runs when they're chasing ghosts and missing crates.

==Notes==
Upon accepting, [[One by One]], '''Intercepted''', & [[Keys Are Optional]],
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|I've seen enough. These captives walk free today. Their tormentors do not.}}

Across [[Speaker's Rest]], collect 6 Cult Orders from 6 Scrolls.
