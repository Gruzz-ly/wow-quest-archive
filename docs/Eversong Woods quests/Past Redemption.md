==Objectives==
Finish the battle against the [[Amani tribe|Amani]] in [[Amani Pass]].
*Speak to [[Turalyon]]

<Turalyon's eyes blaze with Light.> For [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]. This will be finished!

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*13,255 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I did not expect... this.

<[[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]] glances at Turalyon.>

Perhaps we overstepped our bounds.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Champion! We've cornered [[Zul'jan]]--it is time to bring this incursion to an end!}}

Speak to Turalyon:
{{dialogue|I will see Zul'jan fall by my blade!

{{gossip|quest=|{{Text|Blue|(Play Movie)}} I'm ready.}}

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Wrath" starts playing:
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon has defeated Zul'jan, but Zul'jan taunts him}}

:{{Text|Bossemote|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] tells his father to hold back.}}

:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan continues his taunts, saying all this death was to feed Turalyon's vanity, and he spits on Turalyon.}}

:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon charges, swinging his sword at Zul'jan--and Arator leaps in the way, taking the hit.}}

:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator is deeply wounded, and Zul'jan takes this opportunity to flee.}}

:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon is shocked and moves to heal Arator, but Arator refuses his help and leaves.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, High Exarch Turalyon is kneeling as [[Grand Magister Rommath]], [[Lady Liadrin]], and Lor'themar Theron were relocated.
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Were we blind to Arator's truth?}}
