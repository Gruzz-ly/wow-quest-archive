==Objectives==
Test 8 creatures for corruption, and deal with the consequences.
* Animals tested (8)
* Roar investigated
* [[Wandering Cub|Bear Cubs]] rescued (2)
* [[Mysterious Bloom]]
* [[Corruption Resonator]] (provided)

==Description==
Much of the forest has recovered, but to the south... everything that [[Eversong Woods|Eversong]] has faced, the [[Scourge]], the [[Fel]], and now the [[Twilight's Blade]]-- all that [[magic]] leeches into the soil. It builds up in the creatures until they're completely overwhelmed...

My instruments can detect corruption in these animals. We can cull the ones that are too far gone and save the ones that aren't. It isn't fun... but it's for the good of Eversong!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
