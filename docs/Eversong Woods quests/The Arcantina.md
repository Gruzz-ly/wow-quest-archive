==Objectives==
Visit the Arcantina.
*Teleport to the [[Arcantina]]
*[[Key to the Arcantina]] (provided)
*Buy a Round
*Drinks served
*Speak with Arator

==Description==
<Name>, there's a place that we used during the [[Second War]], when we missed our homes an' needed to relax. It has become something of a retreat an' a sanctuary for those who've seen too much fighting--too much pain.

Over time, we've brought friends and allies there. In recent years, members o' the Horde have been invited as well. We call it the Arcantina.

I believe Arator--and you--would benefit from some respite there. Use this key to make a portal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This really is quite a place, isn't it, <name>?

==Completion==
This has been a journey, <name>.

I've learned a lot from Alonsus, and the [[Sons of Lothar]]...

And perhaps most of all, what kind of paladin [[Turalyon|my father]] used to be, and what sort I'll be from now on.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''[[Alonsus Faol]] walks out.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Danath Trollbane]]|Honestly, Arator, we've wanted to show you the place for some time. Glad to finally get the chance.}}
:''[[Eitrigg]] and Kurdran teleported out followed by Danath and finally Arator.''

Use the Key to the Arcantina to go to the Arcantina.

;Upon arrival
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Where is this place? It doesn't appear to be in Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdan Wildhammer|[[Khadgar]] introduced us. It's in some wizardy. hocus-pocus, dimensional whatzzuhthing. Hot food, cold drinks, magical access.}}
:{{Text|Say|Danath Trollbane|<Name>, could you get us the first round? Put it on my tab.}}
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|Take a look around. Horde, Alliance... this place is a refuge for those who've had enough of war.}}

Speak to [[Bartender Bob]] and buy [[A Round of Drinks (Arcantina)]] while all that is happening, the party are having fun,
:{{Text|Say|Kurdan Wildhammer|...and so I said, "If that's my [[Sky'reen|gryphon]], who's sitting on the egg?"}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdan Wildhammer|HA! Ha ha ha ha!}}
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|Pfffft-- Sitting on the egg! HA!}}
:{{Text|Say|Danath Trollbane|Ha ha ha--that doesn't make any sense. Ha ha ha.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!}}

Serve Kurdran, Eitrigg, Danath, and Arator.
:{{Text|Say|Danath Trollbane|Thank you, <name>. To old friends, and new.}}
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|[[Orcish|Aka'magosh]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Danath Trollbane|Arator, what are you going to do with [[Turalyon]]'s shield?}}

Speak with Arator.
{{dialogue|This is quite a place, <name>.

Thank you for helping me on my journey.

We did a lot of good for others, and it did a lot of good for me.

{{gossip|quest=|What are you going to do with the shield?}}

{{Gossip|Let's get back to Silvermoon. {{Text|Red|<Skip the conversation.>}}}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Well... I've been giving it some thought. I'd like to hang it on the wall here. As a reminder.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We all can break, but we can put ourselves back together, and emerge stronger for it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdan Wildhammer|Bah! Terrible idea! Worst I've ever heard.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdan Wildhammer|To have a fine piece of equipment like that, well made, well repaired, languish on the wall until it rusts? Shameful.}}
:{{Text|Say|Danath Trollbane|He has a point, lad. A good shield like that yearns to protect a soldier, so they can protect others.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I... -- But it's not my shield.}}
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|Your father refused the legacy. It's yours if you want it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|It does feel right.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I'll do it. Faol told me that the [[Knights of the Silver Hand|Silver Hand]] was meant to protect the defenseless, during war as well as peace.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Maybe I can help to demonstrate that service to others, as [[Sunwalker Dezco|Dezco]] has. This reforged shield can be a reminder to me, as I protect Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Thank you. All of you. I won't let you down.}}
:''Arator takes up Turalyon's Shield.''
