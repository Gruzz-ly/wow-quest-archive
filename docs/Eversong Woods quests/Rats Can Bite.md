==Objectives==
Kill Magister Aradis.
* [[Magister Aradis]] slain

==Description==
I know all of these people. They're workers, not fighters. Aradis went after the ones who couldn't fend him off. That's why he ran when he tried to take me and realized he picked the wrong target.

After the trouble we've made, there's no way he doesn't know we're here.

Be on guard. Once he shows his face, he's dead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 14,700 [[XP]]
