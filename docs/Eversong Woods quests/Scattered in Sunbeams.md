==Objectives==
Find signs of what happened to the [[Sanctum of the Sun|Sanctum]]'s researchers.
* Evidence of researchers found (3)
* [[Odd Flower]]
* [[Research Log]]
* [[Mirveda Sunpetal]] slain

==Description==
We've given the garden tenders some space to continue their work unimpeded. Hopefully they can keep this place pristine until [[Silvermoon]] has the chance to fix it up.

But now we need to figure out where the missing scholars are. They were studying [[mana]] influence on plants in the gardens towards the back. Perhaps we'll find a sign of them there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
