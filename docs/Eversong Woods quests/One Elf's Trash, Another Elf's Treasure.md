==Objectives==
Test the Discarded Wand on the [[Container of Unstable Arcana]]. Then, power up the wand from various sources of [[arcane]] in [[Daggerspine Landing]].
*Discarded Wand tested
*Arcana siphoned (0/100%)
*[[Borrowed Wand]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[arcane]] arts are not my specialty. I'm more versed in tangible magic--herbs, mixtures, distillation, topical applications. Extraction, suture, painkilling...

Regardless--that wand. To my uneducated eyes, it looks useable. Why don't you test it on the arcana container? Maybe it could help us against the naga. If it's truly broken, no harm done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You can just say I had a hunch about that wand.

...although, be careful. It's powered up now. Don't accidentally drop it.

==Notes==
Make sure you accept [[Daggers in My Spine]] from [[Hathvelion Sungaze]], & [[Familiar Faces In Peril]] from [[Ranger Krenn'an]].

Use the wand on the [[Container of Unstable Arcane]].
:{{Text|Say|Numia Golden|The wand readily takes to arcane...}}
:{{Text|Say|Hathvelion Sungaze|Good call, Numia. Try using it against the naga--it could strip them of their power.}}

Head to [[Daggerspine Landing]] and fill up the bar by siphoning the [[Captured Mana Wrym]]s, and the [[Arcane Cannister]]s (8%) and the [[Daggerspine Infuser]]s (12%).

Finish the other two quests and return to [[Hathvelion Sungaze]] and the party who are now with [[Apothecary Enith|Apothecarist Enith]] & [[Ranger Vedoran]].
:{{Text|Say|Apothecarist Enith|The naga have more than enough arcana to launch a devastating attack on the village.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Vedoran|But they're not. They're consuming some of it, but shipping the rest out to the Great Sea.}}

Upon completion, 
:{{Text|Say|Numia Golden|Enith, the captain's patched up. Let's study these samples you've brought back.}}
:''Numia & Enith begins to walk away.''
:{{Text|Say|Numia Golden|Captain, don't be a hero for the next twenty four hours, please. Rest, have a drink. If the pain gets worse, find me immediately.}}
