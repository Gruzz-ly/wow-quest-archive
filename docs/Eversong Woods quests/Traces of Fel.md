==Objectives==
Discover 5 sources of fel magic near the [[Royal Exchange]].
* Sources of [[fel]] [[magic]] discovered (5)

==Description==
I have been sensing oddly strong fel magic throughout [[Silvermoon]], but this is the first origin point I could locate. The rest were too faint, or perhaps deliberately hidden. Fortunately, this means we now have a specific area to comb through more closely.

We need to gather more evidence. Go around this area and see if you can find more hidden sources of fel. I will grant you a temporary portion of my sight so that even the slightest hint of fel magic will be obvious to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
