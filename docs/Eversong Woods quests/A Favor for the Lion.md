==Objectives==
Read the letter and assist [[Valeera Sanguinar]] in [[Zul'Aman]].
*[[Unsealed Letter|Letter]] read
*Meet with Valeera in Zul'Aman

==Description==
A letter arrived for me. No seal, no name. Just folded parchment and handwriting I'd recognize anywhere.

It didn't say much. He never wastes words.

I've known his family a long time. When they reach out, I answer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've been watching the path. Movement's light, at least for now.

==Notes==
Read the Unsealed letter
:{{Text|Say|[[Anduin Wrynn]]|Valeera, I've received reports of cultists within the [[Twilight's Blade]] who want out. But they're terrified of getting caught while escaping.}}
:{{Text|Say|Anduin Wrynn|We can't ignore their plight, but my hands are tied here at the [[Sunwell]]. I need your help with this. Find those deserters and get them free.}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|The letter wasn't empty--it carried a map, leading straight into Zul'Aman.}}

Head to [[Speaker's Rest]] and meet up with Valeera.
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|They've built themselves a little fortress...}}
