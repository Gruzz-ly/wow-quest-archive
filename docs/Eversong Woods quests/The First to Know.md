==Objectives==
Inform Lord Antenorian, governor of Tranquillien, of your investigation results.
*Meet at Lord Antenorian's office
*[[Secretary Faloria]] questioned
*[[Strange Lockbox (Eversong)|Strange Lockbox]] investigated
*Inform Antenorian of your findings.

==Description==
Notes speaking of fear, of uncertainty--of some mysterious truth? This is not good, <Name>. By all accounts, it sounds as if a cult has managed to infiltrate [[Tranquillien]].

If that journal entry was true, [[Kasiea]] was attempting to leave it.

We must tell [[Antenorian]]. He'll want to secure the town and make sure his people are safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090[[XP]]

==Completion==
It is heartening that you trust me with these serious concerns.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Lord Antenorian values nothing more than the safety of his people. He'll want to know about this.}}
:''Magister Umbric and [[Arator the Redeemer]] left to Antenorian's office. Follow them there.''
:{{Text|Say|Secretary Faloria|What are you--what brings you here?}}

Speak to Faloria,
{{dialogue|Lord Antenorian is a very busy man. Who else will keep Tranquillien safe while the rest of Quel'thalas falls into ruin around us?

Perhaps I can help you in his stead?

{{gossip|quest=|We need to speak to Lord Antenorian.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Secretary Faloria|Lord Antenorian is away. I can help you.}}
:''Faloria walks up the stairs and starts working.''
:{{Text|Whisper|Arator|This isn't right. See what's in that lockbox she was toying with.}}

Interact with the Strange Lockbox and Lord Antenorian appears.
:{{Text|Say|Lord Antenorian|Magister Umbric! How goes your research?}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Go on, <Name>. Tell him.}}

Speak to Lord Antenorian,
{{dialogue|It pains me to think something untoward might be happening in our tranquil little town.

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell Lord Antenorian everything.>}}

{{gossip|quest=|<Lie to Lord Antenorian about how much you know.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lord Antenorian|Really? How very odd indeed.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lord Antenorian|I shall have it looked into. But I'm glad you're here--I need your assistance with something.}}
