==Description==
I've more to review with [[Turalyon]], but in the meantime, the rest of the city should be informed that we will have some temporary guests in the outer perimeter. I'd like you to check in with a few key civilians an and deliver the news.

While you're out there, take the chance to familiarize yourself with Silvermoon. We've made impressive strides rebuilding it since you've last visited.

You will receive one of:
* [[Reluctant Diplomat's Cuffs]]
* [[Reluctant Diplomat's Bracers]]
* [[Reluctant Diplomat's Vambraces]]

==Progress==
Have you met with everyone?

==Completion==
While the Alliance and the Vanguard may become an additional stress for some, their presence is to be tolerated... for now.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|I'll speak to the Vanguard while you get the other matters settled.}}

Head to the [[Wayfarer's Rest]] and speak with [[Innkeeper Jovia]]:
{{Dialogue|I offer what shelter I can in our shattered lands.

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying here temporarily--lodging will be needed.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Innkeeper Jovia|With all that has happened, that... utterly mad vortex of shadow in the sky, guests are leaving in droves. If I weren't overseeing this place, I'm not so certain I'd still be here myself. If you wish a room, it is yours.}}

Go into the Bazaar and speak with [[Magistrix Narinth]]:
{{Dialogue|I do not believe you possess the mental acuity to grasp the nature of portal magic.

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying longer than expected. We'll need your Stormwind portal to remain.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Magistrix Narinth|That burst of energy from the Sunwell... it was more powerful than any magic I've ever encountered, and I am well practiced. They say that army protects us, but I heard the surge was their doing! Do they even understand what they meddle with?}}

Head to the Sanctum of Light and speak with [[Skymaster Skyles]]:
{{Dialogue|Where would you like to fly?

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying here temporarily. They'll need transportation.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Skymaster Skyles|That surge from the Sunwell set off the dragonhawks--they know when there's danger. I've never seen them this unnerved. If the animals are this affected, what about the rest of Eversong?}}

Head to the [[Bazaar]] and speak to [[Ceera]]:
{{Dialogue|Welcome to the Bank of Silvermoon, sir. Would you care to access the depository?

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying here temporarily.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Ceera|The [[Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas|last]] I saw shadows descend on [[Quel'Danas]], [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] marched on our kingdom with his army of [[Scourge]]. Now another army marches in our streets, saying they're here for our protection... are you certain of that?}}

Go to the Reliquary Headquarters where [[Valeera Sanguinar]] is speaking to [[Anduin Wrynn]]. [[Hakra Split-tooth]], [[Brann Bronzebeard]], [[Anuve Litlead]], [[Relly Cogwhacker]], [[Naleidea Rivergleam]] and [[Telemancer Astrandis]] are present in the headquarters.
{{Dialogue|I'll be working with the Reliquary as they venture deeper into hostile territory. Was there something you need?

{{gossip|quest=|Lor'themar will need the services of the Reliquary.}}
{{gossip|Remind me who you are.}}
{{dialogue-child|I am Valeera Sanguinar, a blood elf who walks her own path.

My past is... complicated, but my loyalties have always been my own.

I have fought beside the House of Wrynn, and I stand as an ally to Silvermoon City and its Regent Lord.

I am no servant, no spy in another's pocket--only an ally to those who've earned my trust.

If that is enough for you, then perhaps there's an opportunity for us to work together.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|Of course--the Reliquary will lend aid wherever it's needed. Let me know if you're interested as well.}}

Travel to the [[Royal Exchange]] and speak to [[Magistrix Nizara]]
{{Dialogue|Bal'a dash, malanore.

The Royal Exchange serves as a sense of normalcy during this time. Any service you'd find in the bazaar is open here for a more restricted clientele.

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying here slightly longer than expected.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Magistrix Nizara|Ah. Well, if you ever need a reprieve from the bustle of our visiting... friends, seek the red banners around the city. We'll keep the Alliance out of those areas.}}

Go to the Bazaar where Lor'themar, [[General Amias Bellamy]], and [[Turalyon]] are standing.
{{Dialogue|So you are the champion I have heard so much about.

Many of my people are still alive thanks to your efforts at the Sunwell. You have my gratitude.

Now, if only I can convince these elves that this war is more important than just their city.

{{gossip|quest=|<Offer greeting.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|You have already taken so many of my Blood Knights to empower the Sunwell! Quel'thalas is largely undefended!}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|And I am telling you it is still not enough. Only by the faith of our forces is the Sunwell holding back the Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The Sunwell must not fall.}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|Then make sure we have everything we need and keep enemies off our backs.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|General, perhaps you could see to our forces at the Sunwell. I will discuss matters with the Regent Lord.}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|As you will it, High Exarch.}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|Vanguard, collect every weapon not nailed to a wall and let's move out!}}
