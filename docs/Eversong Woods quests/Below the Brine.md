==Objectives==
Recover 1 Submerged Cargo items in [[Sunsail Anchorage]].
*[[Submerged Cargo]] investigated
*[[Unstable Arcana (Midnight)|Submerged Cargo Items]] retrieved. (12)
*[[Elixir of the Sea's Bounty]] (provided)

==Description==
Discarding crates into the ocean? How utterly desperate.

Whatever they seek to conceal must be damning--sufficient enough to unravel their entire operation, should we recover it.

Take a deep breath and retrieve it before the current sweeps it away. Every thread we pull unravels their scheme further. Soon there will be nothing left but the ruin of their own making.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So what did our friends at Tideborne Freight so desperately want to hide? Their scuttling cannot conceal their true intentions forever.

==Completion==
Unstable arcana and naga? This is hardly just smuggling--it's a disaster waiting to unfold.

The Tideborne are dabbling in matters better left untouched. It seems it is now our responsibility to see it resolved before it becomes an issue.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lyssara Duskmourne|This should help you with the water. Keep your wits sharp and your daggers sharper.}}

Use the Elixir of the Sea's Bounty which allows you to breathe underwater. Then dive into the seas and recover the Submerged Cargo items which has the Unstable Arcana. Be careful of the [[Tideborne Courier]]s.

Head to [[Sunset Strand]] and meet up with Lyssara.
