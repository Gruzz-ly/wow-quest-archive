==Objectives==
Meet [[Arcanist Taemin]] at the [[South Tower]].

==Description==
Despite being new to the [[Farstriders]], Taemin has the hardest assignment. [[Eversong Woods]] has mostly recovered, but the further south you go, the more dangerous things get.

He's a capable [[mage]], though. And we need his nose for [[magic]].

We'll meet you down there once things are wrapped up here. [[Captain Dawnrunner]] was going to provide backup-- she should be there by now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
