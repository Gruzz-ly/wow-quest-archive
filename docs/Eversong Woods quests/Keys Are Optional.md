==Objectives==
Find and release 4 groups of Cult Deserters in [[Speaker's Rest]].
*[[Twilight's Blade Deserter|Deserter]] groups rescued (4)

==Description==
These people joined the Twilight's Blade looking for purpose, power, or place to belong. For a reprieve from the fear and a promise of certainty.

Now they see it for what it is--a prison dressed up as faith. And they want out.

We go in together. Get them out before the cult realizes what's happening.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That should be all of them.
