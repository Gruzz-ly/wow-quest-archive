==Objectives==
Retrieve 12 Scattered Supplies from around [[Farstrider Enclave]].
*[[Scattered Supplies (Midnight)]] (12)

==Description==
We've been deploying [[Farstriders]] across the forest to fight the [[Amani tribe|Amani]], the [[Lightbloom]], the [[Void]]... but for all our heroics, there's no one left to tend to the wildlife! Or maintain the building! Or keep track of supplies!

And now our beloved Enclave looks like a [[hawkstrider]] pen. I've had enough!

I may not be able to help, but I trust you all can gather anything that was taken and get this place looking respectable again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,750 [[XP]]
