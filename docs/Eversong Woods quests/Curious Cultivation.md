==Objectives==
Examine 3 Lightbloom Plant Growths in lightbloom Ath'Ran.
*Lightbloom growths examined
*Find and meet up with [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]
*Pick up strange seed
*Meet Arator in a safer location.

==Description==
This place is unlike anything I have seen before. The plant growth is unique.

<Name>, let us examine the lightbloom more closely. Perhaps we can uncover the secrets of this place together.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Ring of Overgrowth]]
* [[Lightbloom Band]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This makes no sense.

==Completion==
The rutaani are not like this! Not where I am from, at least. There is something affecting them. This behavior is not normal.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting '''Curious Cultivation'''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|<Name>, we must discover what caused these creatures to flourish so suddenly.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Let's split up. We can cover more ground. I'll meet up with the two of you later.}}
:''Arator departs.''

Make sure you accept [[Trimming the Lightbloom]].

Head to the wilds and examine the first [[Lightbloom Flower Growth]].
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The growth of these plants has been forced. By what, I do not know.}}

;Upon examining the [[Infested Lynx]]
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The Lightbloom kills, then grows anew. A vicious cycle that cannot be allowed to continue.}}

;Upon examining the [[Infested Magister (Lightbloom Ath'Ran)]].
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|It seems even your runestones cannot stop the Lightbloom surge, if there are none left to defend them.}}

Head to Arator who is trapped by a [[Rutaani Fighter]].
:{{Text|Say|Rutaani Fighter|Feed the Bloom!}}

Slay the Rutaani Fighter and loot the [[Strange Seed (Eversong)]],
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|A rutaani, here? What is that it holds?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Quickly, there's a runestone nearby. Let's get to safety and take a look.}}

Head to the [[Runestone Falithas]] and Arator starts speaking to [[Orweyna]].
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Orweyna... what was that thing?}}

They have gossip.
{{dialogue|title=Arator|This Lightbloom is not what I expected.}}

{{dialogue|title=Orweyna|I have been called here for a reason.}}

Make sure you turn in both quests.
