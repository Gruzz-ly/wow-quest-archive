==Objectives==
Question the townsfolk of Tranquillien and take note of any clues.
*Civilians questioned (4)
*Clues found in Tranquillien
*Speak with [[Innkeeper Kalarin]]
*[[Discarded Journal (Eversong)|Kaseia's Journal]] found

==Description==
Something just doesn't feel right about all of this. [[Magister Umbric|Umbric]] can look into the notebook, but I suspect there's something more going on here.

It couldn't hurt to ask around [[Tranquillien]] and see if anyone's heard anything odd. I'll take the north side of town, you take the south.

And... use your discretion, my friend. We should avoid alarming anyone for now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090[[XP]]

==Completion==
There's far more to Tranquillien than meets the eye, it seems.

==Notes==

Investigate the [[Guard Schedule]] that is inside the building.

Go to the Supply area and investigate the [[Welcoming Brochure]].
:{{Text|Say|[[Quartermaster Lymel]]|Why are we stockpiling?}}

Speak to Quartermaster Lymel,
{{dialogue|I haven't seen this volume of supplies in and out since this place was half rotted away.

How does the Governor expect me to keep track of all this?

Head downstairs and walk to [[Matron Narsilla]]
:{{Text|Say|Matron Narsilla|Worry not. Lord Antenorian will take care of us all.}}
{{dialogue|The people of Tranquillien cry out in fear. They seek relief.

The path they have travelled is so long. and Light of the sun has all but abandoned them...

:{{Text|Say|Innkeeper Kalarin|A void elf woman rushed out of here last night, as if she was trying to flee.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|That sounds like Kasiea. I wonder if she left anything behind? Let's go see.}}

Head upstairs and investigate the [[Discarded Journal (Eversong)|Discarded Journal]].
:{{Text|Say|Arator|A cult? ...could it be the Twilight's Blade, here?}}


Return to Umbric and Arator to turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Too many people are dodging questions... there may be something darker going on here.}}

Umbric has a gossip
{{dialogue|Governor Antenorian reached out to me and offered me this space for my research into the Voidstorm.

It seems at least some will see reason. This crisis threatens us all.

{{gossip|How do you know the corpse we found?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Kasiea was a student of mine. but she disappeared shortly after we arrived in Eversong. I'd assumed she was upset that we were still being isolated--shunned, in a fashion. That she'd gone back to Telogrus.

She was so bright. So dedicated to her research... from what's left in this notebook, it looks as though she'd finally hit her stride.

<Umbric looks pained.>

I wish I'd been there to see it.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}

{{gossip|How do you know the Governor of Tranquillien?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I've known him for years, but never very closely. He must have heard that we'd returned to Eversong.

Antenorian is very protective of Tranquillien, and deeply concerned with the threat that the Voidstorm poses. That's why he reached out--I suspect he thought I'd be better served with facilities here. That my research is, in fact, useful.

He knows that the sooner we solve this issue, the safer his people will be. I understand that completely, and I'm grateful for his understanding.
