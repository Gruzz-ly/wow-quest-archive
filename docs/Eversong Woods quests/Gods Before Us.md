==Objectives==
Explore [[Watha'nan Crypts]] and pursue [[Zul'jan]].
*Amani Riddle inspected
*Venture deeper into the crypt
*Carved Tiles matched
*Stay awhile and listen to Arator

==Description==
I suppose I shouldn't have expected a greeting with open arms, but I did not expect to be trapped in here.

The Amani are clever--they must have made a way to escape. We have only to find it. Let's look around.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Puzzling Crypt Relic]]
*{{cost|23|40}}
*13,255 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There's a way out of here, I know it.

==Completion==
You made that look easy.

==Notes==
Walk towards the [[Embossed Tablet]] and inspect it.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|This riddle must be the key to getting us out of here.}}

Interact with the [[Ritual Vase]], Slay the [[Spawn of Shadra (Watha'nan Crypts)|Spawn of Shadra]] and obtain the [[Bonecarapace Fangs]] and slay the [[Child of Hir'eek]] and obtain the [[Bloodvein Clot]] and place the items in the [[Ritual Vase]]s.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The mist ward is gone! Let's find Zul'jan.}}

Head downstairs and you were encountered by another puzzle.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|More magic blocking the way. These tiles may offer a solution.}}

Speak to Arator:

:{{Text|Say|Arator|I'd heard this land belonged to the Amani, long ago. I hadn't really thought about it beyond recorded history.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|But these ancient bones--there must be generations of Amani buried here. Resting where no one can reach them.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We elves do not revere our ancestors as the orcs do, but we still honor our dead.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Amani cannot even do that much. We've taken it away from them. Little wonder they hold such hatred for elvenkind.}}

Upon completing the puzzle,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Ha! You did it!}}
