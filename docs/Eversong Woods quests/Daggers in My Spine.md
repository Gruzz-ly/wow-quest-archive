==Objectives==
Slay 12 Daggerspine naga in [[Daggerspine Landing]].
* [[Daggerspine]] [[Naga]] slain (12)

==Description==
The naga have a history of abusing [[arcane]] magic. I bet my boots this is no different--arcane is their lifeblood and source of power. They are clever to operate now, while [[Eversong Woods|Eversong]] is besieged by other threats.

Since I became a [[Farstriders|Farstrider]], I have safeguarded Eversong's western coast. My strike team set up watch on [[Goldenmist Village|Goldenmist]]'s perimeter already. Fortunately, the naga do not seem interested in the town... yet. But they are far too close for comfort.

Our course of action is simple. Clear them out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You've struck fear and death into their water-spawned hearts! Well done.

We'll keep an eye on their base and prevent them from rebuilding.

==Notes==
Make sure you accept [[Familiar Faces In Peril]] from [[Ranger Krenn'an]], & [[One Elf's Trash, Another Elf's Treasure]] from [[Numia Golden]].

Head to [[Daggerspine Landing]] and slay the [[Daggerspine Infuser]]s & [[Daggerspine Myrmidon|Myrmidons]].

Finish the other two quests and return to [[Hathvelion Sungaze]] and the party who are now with [[Apothecary Enith|Apothecarist Enith]] & [[Ranger Vedoran]].
:{{Text|Say|Apothecarist Enith|The naga have more than enough arcana to launch a devastating attack on the village.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Vedoran|But they're not. They're consuming some of it, but shipping the rest out to the Great Sea.}}

Upon completion, 
:{{Text|Say|Numia Golden|Enith, the captain's patched up. Let's study these samples you've brought back.}}
:''Numia & Enith begins to walk away.''
:{{Text|Say|Numia Golden|Captain, don't be a hero for the next twenty four hours, please. Rest, have a drink. If the pain gets worse, find me immediately.}}
