==Objectives==
Collect six vials of Potent Mournbat Venom from [[mournbat]]s outside of [[Windrunner Village]].
*[[Potent Mournbat Venom]] (6)

==Description==
My poultice requires venom samples from the local giant bat populations. Please retrieve some of those, as well. Six common vials' worth should do.

Don't give me that look. They're bats. There are mad [[Light]]-plant-things to the east and a storm of [[voidwalker]]s swirling over our heads. Don't you dare give me guff about the dangers of big, fluffy bats. Now shoo. My colleague is depending on your prompt and efficient aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
