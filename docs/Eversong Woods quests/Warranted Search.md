==Objectives==
'Interrogate' 12 Tideborne Freight sailors in [[Sunsail Anchorage]].
* [[Tideborne Freight]] [[sailor]]s 'Interrogated' (12)

==Description==
Tideborne Freight, is it? A name far too polished, like an ornate blade designed to distract from the blood it has shed. Smuggling through the port... but I suspect this venture involves something far more perilous than we think.

We must act with haste before they set sail and vanish into the mists. Keep your weapons honed and your senses sharper. Make them understand that crossing me was a grave miscalculation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
But of course, they would prefer to keep prying eyes at bay.

They are guarding something. Now, we must uncover precisely what it is.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Warranted Search''' & [[Supplier Surveillance]],
:{{Text|Say|Lyssara Duskmourne|Go show those Tideborne dolts the error of their ways. Find me at Sunsail Anchorage after you are done, <name>.}}
:''Lyssara Duskmourne departs''

Head to Sunsail Anchorage and beat the [[Tideborne Deckwalker]]s & [[Tideborne Freight Runner]]s.

Head to the upper levels and turn in both quests.
