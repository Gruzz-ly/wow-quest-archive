==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[Sharpmaw (quest)]], '''Fairbreeze Favors''', & [[Displaced Denizens]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|Magistrix, when did you first begin seeing these disturbances with this Lightbloom?}}
:{{Text|Say|Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider|Hmm, perhaps when the Sunwell blew sky high into that swirling vortex? ...sorry. I'm a bit overwhelmed.}}

Across the village, slay 8 [[Invasive Light Wrym]]s and trap the [[Displaced Lynx]]. Use the {{abilities|id=1227643|Shoo Hawkstrider|Frighten all hawkstriders around you.|icon=ability_physical_taunt|range=10|cd=5}} to scare away the [[Displaed Hawkstrider]]s.

Head to [[Melida Sunward]] who is feeling woozy from the Hawkstriders.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|What happened here?}}
:{{Text|Say|Melida Sunward|Hawkstriders... running amok...}}

Help her by collecting 4 [[Dropped Tome]]s.
:{{Text|Say|Melida Sunward|Thank you. Those hawkstriders are a terror!}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|They shouldn't be a problem much longer.}}

Go to [[Aleeta Dawnstone]] whose cat [[Mr. Fluff]] is on top of the statue.
:{{Text|Say|Aleeta Dawnstone|Please save my kitty, mister paladin!}}

Rescue Mr. Fluff from the statue.
:{{Text|Say|Aleeta Dawnstone|Come down kitty!}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|There we are--keep him close now!}}

Go to [[Darion Swiftdawn]] and heal his injured pet.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Light soothe those wounds, little friend.}}
:{{Text|Say|Darion Swiftdawn|My poor kitten was savaged! Thank you.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|It was no trouble at all.}}

Return to [[Orweyna]] and [[Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider]] to turn in three quests.
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|This Lightbloom you describe is clearly out of control. WE must find what has disturbed it so.}}
