==Objectives==
Listen in on 3 conversations near the [[Royal Exchange]].
* Information gathered (3)
* Nobles eavesdropped
* Students eavesdropped
* Destitutes eavesdropped

==Description==
It is not unexpected to sense some [[fel]] [[magic]] here. There are still [[warlock]]s among the city and old fel siphoning chambers. But the evidence I've found so far is more than could be explained by just that. It feels... different.

This practice has to be widespread, which means someone must be talking about it.

I've been rooting around too long to go unnoticed, but perhaps you could covertly listen in on some idle banter around the city. If you learn anything useful, report back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
