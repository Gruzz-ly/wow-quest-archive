==Objectives==
Rescue the remaining Twilight's Blade Deserters from the Twilight Crypts delve on any difficulty.
*[[Twilight Crypts]] delve entered 
*[[Tormented Deserter]]s freed (6)
*Twilight Crypts delve completed

==Description==
We've done well to see those deserters to safety, but don't fool yourself into thinking we've freed them all.

I've heard whispers of a place they use to break those whose loyalty is in question. The location isn't common knowledge, but I know where to start looking. 

If we're quick, we might find others before the cult decides they're too great a risk to keep alive.

Meet me near the site. Keep your blades sharp and your steps light.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That's all of them. Good work.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|All in all, an easy rescue. But there are others worse straits still hidden away.}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|I won't let them rot.}}

Head into the [[Twilight Crypts]] and enter the delves.

Free the 4 Tormented Deserters and then complete the delve
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|Let's head back to Silvermoon. This place... brings up memories I'd rather forget.}}

Head back to the Bazaar and turn in.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|The Twilight's Blade will gladly prey on anyone, no matter what faction they hail from.}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|What we did here hurt them. Hopefully it will send more fleeing from their ranks.}}
