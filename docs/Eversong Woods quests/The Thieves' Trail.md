==Objectives==
Recover Quel'dorei Artifacts from the [[Twilight's Blade]] in [[Zeb'tela Ruins]].
* [[Quel'dorei Artifact]] (10)

==Description==
From what I can see, it looks like the Twilight's Blade stole several [[arcane]] artifacts used by our [[magisters]] to enhance long-distance communication. If they learn to wield them, they'll cast their reach far beyond what we can contain. They might even be able to hear our communications... and we can't have that.

Recover the artifacts. If anyone gets in your way... you know what to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Those artifacts should never have fallen into the wrong hands.

==Completion==
Good. With these back where they belong, their reach just got a lot shorter. I only wish we'd uncovered who took them originally.

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[Lines Cut, Tongues Silenced]], '''The Thieves' Trail''', & [[Dead Men Keep No Secrets]],
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|I'll stay in the shadows and keep eyes from above. Don't worry--if things turn, you won't be alone.}}

Valeera has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|This hill gives us the advantage. Let's not waste it.}}

You have been equipped with the ability: {{Abilities|Red Veil, Ready Hand|id=1247421|icon=classicon_rogue|Valeera Sanguinar has a chance to appear and aid you in combat for a short duration.}}

Head deeper into the ruins and slay the [[Twilight Agent]]s, [[Twilight Bonebreaker (Eversong Woods)|Twilight Bonebreakers]], [[Twilight Crystal Seer]]s, & [[Twilight Voidcaster]]s and loot from them the 10 Quel'dorei Artifacts.

Head back to Valeera after finishing 3 quests.
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|Not bad, <name>. Now, let's find out just how deep their claws tried to dig.}}
