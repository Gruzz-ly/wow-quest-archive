==Objectives==
Siphon 8 Full Bobbins of Manasilk from weakened wyrms in the North Sanctum.
* [[Full Bobbin of Manasilk]] (8)
* [[Empty Manasilk Bobbin]] (provided)

==Description==
Our patron--[[Gaari]], I suppose--should count himself lucky. These [[mana wyrm]]s produce the finest silk in [[Eversong Woods|Eversong]]. I know [[magisters]] who would kill to have a robe trimmed in this, and yet here we are, using it for a mending job. Ah well.

Once the wyrms have eaten their fill of arcane energy, you can siphon the silk from them onto these bobbins.

If they are reluctant to release their silk, you may have to, ah... beat it out of them. But I've been assured it's entirely ethical.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]
