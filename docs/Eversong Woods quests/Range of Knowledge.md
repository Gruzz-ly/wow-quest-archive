==Objectives==
Retrieve 3 overdue books from around [[Farstrider Hold]] and return them to the library.
* [[Herbalist's Handbook: Eversong Medicinals]]
* [[Index of Ranger Corps Recipes vol. VII]]
* [[Songs for the Silver Streams]]
* Return books to the Farstrider Library
* Examine [[Taemin]]'s [[Thalassian Legends|favorite book]]

==Description==
I've always dreamed of being a [[Farstriders|Farstrider]]--the adventure! The romance! The beauty of nature! When they put out a call for help, I knew I had to join.

[[Captain Dawnrunner]] assigned me to the library initially, but with everything going on, we all have to be flexible.

I don't mind, but I had hoped to collect all the overdue books before being sent on a real assignment. If you find any, would you bring them to the library for me?

And feel free to give them a read! There are some interesting volumes!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
