==Objectives==
Record evidence in [[Sunsail Anchorage]].
* Side View Recorder placed
* Upper View Recorder placed
* Front View Recorder placed
* Watch and Surveille Ship

==Description==
This note all but drips with guilt, but mere words alone will not bring down [[Tideborne Freight]]. I require undeniable proof--evidence so damning that not even their well-bribed [[magistrates]] can turn a blind eye. That is where you come in.

Take this Arcane Recorder and make your way to the docks. Document their shipments, their crew--anything that reeks of smuggling.

A single image can speak volumes, and I intend to make every word count.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
There it is, caught in the act.

Disposing of cargo into the ocean? Clearly they are erasing evidence, which can only mean one thing--we are closing in on something significant.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both [[Warranted Search]] & '''Supplier Surveillance''',
:{{Text|Say|Lyssara Duskmourne|Go show those Tideborne dolts the error of their ways. Find me at Sunsail Anchorage after you are done, <name>.}}
:''Lyssara Duskmourne departs''

Head to Sunsail Anchorage put the [[Arcane Recorder]] at the Docks, and then another at the upper levels and then near the ship.
:{{Text|Say|[[Tideborne Freight Deckhand]]|Toss them overboard now! We cannot risk discovery.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Tideborne Freight Deckhand]]|Eye! Into the depths it go.}}
:''The Deckhands throw the evidence out.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Tideborne Freight Deckhand]]|Let the sea erare our trace.}}

Head to the upper levels and turn in both quests.
