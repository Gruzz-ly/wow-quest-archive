:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The [[Sunwell]] holds the [[Voidstorm]] at bay for now. But its current state cannot be sustained forever.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Halduron Brightwing]]|And there's no telling how it could be affecting the rest of [[Eversong]], especially the [[Lightbloom]]. We need an alternative course of action.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|We [[ren'dorei]] can aid you in finding one. Grant us entry to Silvermoon--}}
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|Absolutely not! Your mere presence would risk defiling the Sunwell with [[Void]] magic.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Then it seems we have nothing more to discuss. I'll continue my research in [[Tranquillien]], should you choose to see reason.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[High Exarch Turalyon]]|The Grand Magister is right about one thing--protecting the Sunwell is our top priority. The [[Vanguard of the Light]] will see to its defense.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Your aid was timely and welcome, Turalyon. But remember that Silvermoon and the Sunwell belong to the sin'dorei. You are guests in our fair city.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|Guests, allies, and saviors, Lor'themar. Rest assured that we will guard your city and your people with the full strength of the [[Light]].}}
