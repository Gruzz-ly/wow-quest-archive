==Objectives==
Meet [[Ranger Valsarin]] at the [[North Tower]].

==Description==
Ranger Valsarin is a chef at [[Farstrider Hold]]. He's decent in a kitchen, but his passion is field cooking.

There was a time when you could wander any path in [[Eversong Woods|Eversong]] and find the ingredients for a good meal. A [[Farstriders|Farstrider]]'s dream! With enough hard work, we can help the forest recover, and it starts with rehabilitating the soil.

Meet Valsarin at the North Tower and he can tell you more.
