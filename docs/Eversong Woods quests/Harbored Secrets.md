==Objectives==
Talk to the dockmaster at the [[Silvermoon Harbor]] to collect [[Zaen Bladesorrow|Zaen]]'s [[fel]] relic shipment.
* Meet [[Belath Dawnblade|Belath]] at the harbor
* Speak to the dockmaster
* [[Folded Receipt]]
* Dockworker released

==Description==
That manifest is stamped by the Silvermoon harbor. It looks like Zaen has his smugglers working there to push his fel relic shipments through inspections.

If we cut off their supply line at the harbor, we can halt the fel operation until we track down Zaen and end it for good. No sense going after the middlemen until then.

Subterfuge got us this far, so let's keep at it. Head to the harbor and tell them you're picking up Zaen's shipment. We'll work from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
