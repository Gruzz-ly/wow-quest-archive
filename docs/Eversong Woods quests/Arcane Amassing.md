==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Princess Naz'jena.png|Princess Naz'jena|Princess Naz'jena amasses arcane power for a greater entity... but what's a little bit skimmed from the top for herself?}}
Slay Princess Naz'jena in [[Daggerspine Point]].
* [[Princess Naz'jena]] slain
* Use the Empowered Wand against Princess Naz'jena (Optional)
* [[Empowered Wand]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, you heard [[Numia Golden|Numia]]. She'll have my bow split in two if I don't rest.

[[Ranger Vedoran]] reported activity at the lighthouse. A swarm of [[mana wyrm]]s are gathered there, and of course, more [[naga]].

If that's where the head of the snake lives, chop it off! My rangers Vedoran and [[Ranger Krenn'an|Krann'an]]{{Sic}} will accompany you. And take the wand with you. It proved its worth. Powered up, it should pack a punch against whatever you face.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 14,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
The lighthouse itself was coming apart due to the increasing arcane energies, both latent and collected. How ominous indeed. I'll deliver a report to Regent Lord [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]] straight away.

Thanks to you, my rangers and the town are saved. For that, please rest and drink.

...the wand exploded?! I suppose we now know why it was thrown away.

You know, a bow would never spontaneously combust.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Vedoran|We'll return with good news, captain.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Krenn'an|With Vedoran, myself, and <name>, you have nothing to worry about, captain.}}

Head to Daggerspine Point and arrive to Princess Naz'jena as she has Ranger Vedoran and Ranger Krenn'an
:{{Text|Say|Princess Naz'jena|Arcane thirsts for me!}}

If you are able to use the wand to siphon Naz'jena
:{{Text|Say|Princess Naz'jena|So primitive! Your wand AND friends are no match for me!}}

Upon slaying Naz'jena, the rangers are freed.
:{{Text|Say|Princess Naz'jena|[[Prince Nazjak|Nazjak]]... we will rise again from the depths...}}
:''Krenn'an runs to Vedoran as he is on the brink of dying.''
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Vedoran|Ugh... the lightkeepers... we... end... like them...}}
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Krenn'an|Hang in there, I've got you!}}
:''Krenn'an takes Vedoran and runs off.''

Return to [[Goldenmist Village]]'s apothecary.

Upon completion, Hathvelion has a gossip
{{Dialogue|If not for your aid, I would have lost both my rangers... my friends.

Villages like Goldenmist keep Silvermoon standing strong. If our towns were to fall, the city itself would surely succumb. This is the Farstrider way.

Ranger Vedoran may not recover fully. Arcane is a critical part of our life essence, regardless of our relationship with magic. The naga princess would've taken it all from him.

<Hathvelion glances at Numia, and his expression lightens.>

Numia assured me she's working on something. Arcane infused wine... sounds promising.}}
