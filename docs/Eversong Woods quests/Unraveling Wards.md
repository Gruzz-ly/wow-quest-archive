==Objectives==
Use the charged Wardbreaker to destroy the shields guarding 5 Warded Conduits.
* Warded Conduits sabotaged (5)
* Conduits followed (5)

==Description==
[[Magister Dawnblaze|Dawnblaze]] is keeping the blackmail documents in her study. It is highly warded, naturally.

The wards themselves are pitifully made. However, she is supplying additional power to them using [[arcane]] conduits placed throughout the city. I found the first link in the chain and brought it here to study.

It is also warded, but weakly. I theorize that if the conduits are broken in sequence, then the shields on Dawnblaze's study will be vulnerable.

Sabotage them, then recover the documents. Understood?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
