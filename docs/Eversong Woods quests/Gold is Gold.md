==Objectives==
Speak to [[Magister Aradis]] in his study near the [[Silvermoon Harbor]].

==Description==
Hey! You there.

<[[Sarvi]] beckons you closer and lowers her voice.>

You looking for work? A [[magister]] gave me five gold to find an adventuring type to do some sort of job for him. He said if the person gets it done, I get five more. That'll feed me for months.

You fit the bill. If you want to try to get paid too, he has a study over by the harbor. Real fancy place, you can't miss it. The guy's name is Aradis.

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
