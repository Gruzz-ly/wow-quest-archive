==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Gareth the Listener.png|[[Gareth the Listener]]|A sharp-eyed operative with a calm, commanding presence. He speaks little, moves with purpose, and watches over the area with stark efficiency.}}
Retrieve the stolen documents from [[Makdug the Listener]] in [[Zeb'tela Ruins]].
* [[Infiltrator's Cache]]

==Description==
From what I've seen, this group isn't acting without direction. There's someone leading them, a man hiding in one of their structures.

If I had to guess, he's the one holding whatever they considered too important to trust to crystal or courier. Documents, plans, names.

Find him, silence him, and bring back whatever he was protecting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 14,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You made that look easy.

==Completion==
Excellent. All of their most important secrets, out of their hands.

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[Lines Cut, Tongues Silenced]], '''The Thieves' Trail''', & [[Dead Men Keep No Secrets]],
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|I'll stay in the shadows and keep eyes from above. Don't worry--if things turn, you won't be alone.}}

Valeera has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|This hill gives us the advantage. Let's not waste it.}}

You have been equipped with the ability: {{Abilities|Red Veil, Ready Hand|id=1247421|icon=classicon_rogue|Valeera Sanguinar has a chance to appear and aid you in combat for a short duration.}}

Head to the ruins and confront Gareth,
:{{Text|Say|Gareth the Listener|Secrets bleed, and I wield the knife!}}

Upon slaying Gareth.
:{{Text|Say|Gareth the Listener|The Void... still whispers...}}

Obtain the Infiltrator's Cache from Gareth.

Head back to Valeera after finishing 3 quests.
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|Not bad, <name>. Now, let's find out just how deep their claws tried to dig.}}
