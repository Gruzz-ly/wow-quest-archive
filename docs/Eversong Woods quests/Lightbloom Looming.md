==Notes==
;Upon accept, speak to Orweyna and click on {{gossip|quest=|Let's follow the trail you found.}}
Orweyna will accompany you and Arator.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Follow the trail. It should lead to the answers we seek.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|[[Alleria Windrunner|Mother]] said you're familiar with the wilds. What do you make of all this?}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The creatures... they remind me of home, yet they live on the surface. It should not be this way.}}

Head to beyond [[Saltheril's Haven]] where an [[Eversong Defender]] is battling a [[Lightbloom Hydra]].
:{{Text|Say|Eversong Defender|You'll encroach no further!}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Another of those beasts! Quickly!}}

Upon slaying the Lightbloom Hydra,
:{{Text|Say|Eversong Defender|My thanks.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|We must be on the right track.}}

Head to [[Goldenbough Pass]] where a dead [[Infested Magister]] was by the [[Lightbloom Petalwing]].
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|These creatures seem Light-blessed, but they're so... vicious.}}

Slay the Petalwing and examine the Infested Magister,
{{dialogue|<This defender's corpse has been savaged by beak and talon. As you examine the wounds, a tendril of vegetative growth sprouts up from within the body.>}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|They claimed this as their territory. We are now encroaching.}}

Go to the Magisters as they're battling a Lightbloom Monstrosity.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Trouble ahead! On your guard!}}

Head to [[Lightbloom Ath'Ran]] where the trail has come to a close.
:{{Text|Say|[[Larianna Riverwind]]|The runestone... we were able to hold back the growth, but not those... things!}}
