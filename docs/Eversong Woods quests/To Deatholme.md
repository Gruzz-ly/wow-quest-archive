==Objectives==
Meet with Magister Umbric in the Ruins of Deathholme.
*Journey to the [[Ruins of Deatholme]]
*Speak with [[Valeera Sanguinar]]

==Description==
That coward Antenorian has doomed us all. I had hoped it wouldn't come to this, but...

We need the rest of Kasiea's research, the missing pages that were stolen from her corpse. But the cult has retreated south, to the ruins of Deatholme.

Fitting that such traitors would sequester themselves in such a vile place. But we must root them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,650[[XP]]

==Progress==
Watch your back. The ruins of Deatholme are still dangerous.

==Completion==
I am loathe to find myself here again... but it is the only way.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Kasiea's research holds the first steps I need to help Silvermoon. Antenorian took those missing pages. I'd bet my life on it.}}
:''Magister Umbric leaves and [[Arator the Redeemer]] follows''

Travel to the [[Ruins of Deatholme]] to meet up with them and they are accompanied by [[Valeera Sanguinar]].

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Council of the Void" starts playing,
:''Antenorian arrives inside the delve.''

:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|Make ready.}}
:''Mor'duun, Terminas, and Salhadaar's holograms vanish as Antenorian stood up as Xal'atath's Hologram vanish.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|Mistress... do not forsake me!}}
:'' Xal'atath appears behind Antenorian as he turns to see her.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|You did well, my faithful servant.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Xal'atath|But alas, I have no further use for you.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|But... I...}}
