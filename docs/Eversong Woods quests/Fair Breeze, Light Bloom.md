==Objectives==
Journey to [[Fairbreeze Village]].
*Obtain the arcane projector from Rommath.
*Stay awhile and listen to [[Lady Liadrin|Liadrin]] (Optional)
*Reach [[Fairbreeze Village]]

==Description==
In recent years, small pockets of wild growth we call 'lightbloom' ha have blossomed throughout Eversong. A curiosity for our local botanists, for the most part.

However, the magistrix in Fairbreeze is asking for help with the local lightbloom. I've no idea what that might entail, but I also lack any forces to send at the moment.

I therefore ask you to go attend to the Issue. Magister Rommath can provide you with an arcane projector to keep in touch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The wildlife has gone crazy!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Grand Magister Rommath]]|Use this arcane projector to keep us informed.}}

Interact with Rommath to take the Arcane Projector.
:{{Text|Say|[[Turalyon|High Exarch Turalyon]]|Arator, you may be needed at the Sunwell.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator]]|This Lightbloom might actually be of use to the Vanguard. At the very least, I need to find out.}}

Speak to Lady Liadrin:
{{dialogue|My duty is to protect the whole of Eversong.

{{gossip|quest=|What's on your mind?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Is everything all right, Lady Liadrin? You've said little since we arrived.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|My apologies, my thoughts are with the [[Sunwell]]. I did not expect it to react with such... force.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|You ask, and the [[Light]] provides. Need it be more complicated than that?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|She speaks of the [[Sunwell]], not the Light.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|Your fount was blessed by the heart of a [[M'uru|naaru]]. It is one and the same.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|I suggest you hold your tongue, High Exarch. That 'fount' you so blithely pretend to understand predates the existence of human civilization.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|And in all that time, I have never heard of the Sunwell reacting with that kind of... aggression. Liadrin, what was that beam of light?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|I wish I knew. It holds back the void, yet I still wonder... if the Sunwell is capable of such power, what else will it do?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|That question worries me, Liadrin. Is it wrong for it to do so?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|The effects of the Sunwell have never been malicious. It has blessed Eversong's forests with small groves of Lightbloom for years.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Small at first--but Fairbreeze now reports a problem. If the Sunwell is aggressive, what of the Lightbloom?}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|These worries will lead you nowhere, Regent Lord. As long as the Vanguard maintains the connection to the Sunwell, the Light will see us through.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|Have faith. That is all that is needed from you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Perhaps you should save your words for when they are asked for, High Exarch. I suspect they would be better received.}}

Head to Fairbreeze Village and Arator is there with [[Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider]], and a familiar face called [[Orweyna]].

Present characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Orweyna|I hear the song of the world, and I answer.

{{gossip|Who are you?}}
{{dialogue-child|I am Orweyna of the haranir. It is rare my people venture far from our homeland. But the song of the world speaks to me. I will do as my goddess asks, no matter where it takes me.}}
}}

{{dialogue|title=Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider|Welcome to Fairbreeze village.

{{gossip|Can you tell me more about the lightbloom?}}
{{dialogue-child|The lightbloom appeared some time after the Sunwell was re-ignited. Simple patches of unusual growth here and there--nothing to be concerned with. As the Light imbued us through the Sunwell. It also seemed to imbue the flora as well. Fascinating, really!

We've always been able to shape the forests around us, but the lightbloom seems more stubborn. It's wilder, less malleable, almost as if it has a mind of its own... of course that's silly to think about. It's just plants, after all. Plants don't think.}}
