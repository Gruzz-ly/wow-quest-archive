==Objectives==
Kill 8 encroaching wildlife.
* Encroaching wildlife slain (8)

==Description==
[[Sanctum of the Sun|This sanctum]] was studying the [[Lightbloom]] well before the incident at [[Fairbreeze Village|Fairbreeze]]. We had no reason to be concerned over their research up until that point.

However, the last message we attempted to send never received a reply. And this doesn't look good now that we're here.

We need to clear out some of the wildlife first, though. We cannot risk any contamination.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
...

==Notes==
Kill [[Agitated Wyrm]]s and [[Territorial Dragonhawk]]s

==Progression==
{{Blinding Sun}}
