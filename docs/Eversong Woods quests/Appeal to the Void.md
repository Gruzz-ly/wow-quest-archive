==Objectives==
Assist Umbric with testing void theorems outside of [[Tranquillien]].
*Eastern Ritual completed
*Western Ritual completed
*Northern Ritual completed

==Description==
[[Kasiea]]... whatever you've found, you've perished for it.

I won't let her work be in vain.

There's something to be found here, <Name>. There are a few locations listed--let's travel to them and try some of these theorems. The formulae may be incomplete, but perhaps we can discover what she was looking for.

It had to have been important.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Umbric's Channeling Focus]]
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090[[XP]]

==Completion==
I don't understand--what was she doing with all this information?

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Appeal to the Void''' and [[Rational Explanation]],
:{{Text|Say|[[Lord Antenorian]]|My sympathies, Magister. I'll see that someone takes care of the body.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|I need to look into Kasiea's notes. I won't let her die in vain.}}
:''Umbric, Arator, and Antenorian begins to leave.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|I'll ask around and see if I can find any leads.}}

Head to the [[Solaarian Sunbath]] where Umbric stands with his channeling focus.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Kasiea's notes appear to be focused on... summoning? Let's see.}}

Activate the focus.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|A Rift!}}

Slay the [[Coalescing Shadow]]s and the [[Seeping Darkness]].
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|A sample of Void energy. Good. Let's take it and try another location.}}

Travel to the west.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|This place is more exposed to the [[Voidstorm]]. Things may get dangerous.}}

Activate the Focus,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|More creatures!}}

Slay the [[Coalescing Shadow]]s and the [[Looming Darkness (mob)]].
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Was she summoning from the [[Voidstorm]] itself? But why?}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Let's try the last location.}}

Head to [[Tranquil Repose]]
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Kasiea... what were you doing?}}

Activate the focus and slay the [[Coalescing Shadow]]s and the [[Spiraling Darkness]].
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|That's our last sample. What was the purpose of all of this?}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Let's take these back to my study.}}

Return to Umbric and Arator to turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Too many people are dodging questions... there may be something darker going on here.}}

Umbric has a gossip
{{dialogue|Governor Antenorian reached out to me and offered me this space for my research into the Voidstorm.

It seems at least some will see reason. This crisis threatens us all.

{{gossip|How do you know the corpse we found?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Kasiea was a student of mine. but she disappeared shortly after we arrived in Eversong. I'd assumed she was upset that we were still being isolated--shunned, in a fashion. That she'd gone back to Telogrus.

She was so bright. So dedicated to her research... from what's left in this notebook, it looks as though she'd finally hit her stride.

<Umbric looks pained.>

I wish I'd been there to see it.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}

{{gossip|How do you know the Governor of Tranquillien?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I've known him for years, but never very closely. He must have heard that we'd returned to Eversong.

Antenorian is very protective of Tranquillien, and deeply concerned with the threat that the Voidstorm poses. That's why he reached out--I suspect he thought I'd be better served with facilities here. That my research is, in fact, useful.

He knows that the sooner we solve this issue, the safer his people will be. I understand that completely, and I'm grateful for his understanding.
