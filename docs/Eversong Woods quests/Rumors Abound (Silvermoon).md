==Objectives==
Find [[Belath Dawnblade]] in the terraces above the [[Bazaar]].

==Description==
I would advise exploring the city with caution. Not all is what it seems in [[Silvermoon]].

The [[Illidari]] are performing an investigation which need not be spoken of openly. But you appear formidable... perhaps you can aid us.

My commander, Belath Dawnblade, is heading the investigation. The last I heard, he was surveying the upper terraces of the Bazaar.

Seek him out, if you would make use of yourself.

==Rewards==
The quest line will unlock:
*Dungeon: Murder Row <!-- 1272718 -->

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]
*[[Silvermoon Court (commendation)]] (+10) <!-- wb,+template -->

==Completion==
Your arrival is timely.

I will be brief: I believe there is a resurgence of fel magic use happening in Silvermoon, and it must be stopped.

==Notes==
Approach Belath:
