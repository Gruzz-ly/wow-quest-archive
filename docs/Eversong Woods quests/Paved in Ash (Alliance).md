==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|I'll speak to the Vanguard while you get the other matters settled.}}

Head to the [[Wayfarer's Rest]] and speak with [[Innkeeper Jovia]]:
{{Dialogue|I offer what shelter I can in our shattered lands.

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying here temporarily--lodging will be needed.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Innkeeper Jovia|With all that has happened, that... utterly mad vortex of shadow in the sky, guests are leaving in droves. If I weren't overseeing this place, I'm not so certain I'd still be here myself. If you wish a room, it is yours.}}

Go into the Bazaar and speak with [[Magistrix Narinth]]:
{{Dialogue|I do not believe you possess the mental acuity to grasp the nature of portal magic.

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying longer than expected. We'll need your Stormwind portal to remain.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Magistrix Narinth|That burst of energy from the Sunwell... it was more powerful than any magic I've ever encountered, and I am well practiced. They say that army protects us, but I heard the surge was their doing! Do they even understand what they meddle with?}}

Head to the Sanctum of Light and speak with [[Skymaster Skyles]]:
{{Dialogue|Where would you like to fly?

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying here temporarily. They'll need transportation.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Skymaster Skyles|That surge from the Sunwell set off the dragonhawks--they know when there's danger. I've never seen them this unnerved. If the animals are this affected, what about the rest of Eversong?}}

Head to the [[Bazaar]] and speak to [[Ceera]]:
{{Dialogue|Welcome to the Bank of Silvermoon, sir. Would you care to access the depository?

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying here temporarily.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Ceera|The [[Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas|last]] I saw shadows descend on [[Quel'Danas]], [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] marched on our kingdom with his army of [[Scourge]]. Now another army marches in our streets, saying they're here for our protection... are you certain of that?}}

Go to the Reliquary Headquarters where [[Valeera Sanguinar]] is speaking to [[Anduin Wrynn]]. [[Hakra Split-tooth]], [[Brann Bronzebeard]], [[Anuve Litlead]], [[Relly Cogwhacker]], [[Naleidea Rivergleam]] and [[Telemancer Astrandis]] are present in the headquarters.
{{Dialogue|I'll be working with the Reliquary as they venture deeper into hostile territory. Was there something you need?

{{gossip|quest=|Lor'themar will need the services of the Reliquary.}}
{{gossip|Remind me who you are.}}
{{dialogue-child|I am Valeera Sanguinar, a blood elf who walks her own path.

My past is... complicated, but my loyalties have always been my own.

I have fought beside the House of Wrynn, and I stand as an ally to Silvermoon City and its Regent Lord.

I am no servant, no spy in another's pocket--only an ally to those who've earned my trust.

If that is enough for you, then perhaps there's an opportunity for us to work together.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|Of course--the Reliquary will lend aid wherever it's needed. Let me know if you're interested as well.}}

Travel to the [[Royal Exchange]] and speak to [[Guard Captain Goldblade]]
{{Dialogue|Bal'a dash, malanore.

The Royal Exchange serves as a sense of normalcy during this time. Any service you'd find in the bazaar is open here for a more restricted clientele.

{{gossip|quest=|The Alliance will be staying here slightly longer than expected.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Guard Captain Goldblade|The gates behind me are restricted to members of the Horde only. Avoid the red banners and trees, or there will be consequences.}}

Go to the Bazaar where Lor'themar, [[General Amias Bellamy]], and [[Turalyon]] are standing.
{{Dialogue|So you are the champion I have heard so much about.

Many of my people are still alive thanks to your efforts at the Sunwell. You have my gratitude.

Now, if only I can convince these elves that this war is more important than just their city.

{{gossip|quest=|<Offer greeting.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|You have already taken so many of my Blood Knights to empower the Sunwell! Quel'thalas is largely undefended!}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|And I am telling you it is still not enough. Only by the faith of our forces is the Sunwell holding back the Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The Sunwell must not fall.}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|Then make sure we have everything we need and keep enemies off our backs.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|General, perhaps you could see to our forces at the Sunwell. I will discuss matters with the Regent Lord.}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|As you will it, High Exarch.}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|Vanguard, collect every weapon not nailed to a wall and let's move out!}}
