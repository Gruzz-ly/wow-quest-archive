==Objectives==
Meet Solwin inside, then fend off any manifestations as he mends the cloak.
* Speak with [[Solwin]] to begin mending
* [[Arcanoweave Cloak]] repaired
* [[Gaari]] found

==Description==
It is not merely the material that makes an arcanoweave cloak so fine, but the weaving process itself.

To mend one, particularly one that has built up so much history and latent [[arcane]] energy... I am about to embark on a very dangerous bit of tailoring indeed. Finally, a real testament to my skills.

I am excited. I hope nothing explodes. Meet me inside when you're prepared.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]
*[[Pattern: Blood Elf Drapery]]
