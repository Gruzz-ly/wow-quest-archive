==Objectives==
Find an{{sic}} magical construct and retrieve its core.
* [[Humming Core]]

==Description==
The [[Sanctum of the Sun|sanctum]] door seems to be locked. Probably from the inside.

I believe an arcane construct is used for heavy lifting and general upkeep alongside the [[treant]]s. The core of it should override the lock on the door and work as a master key. I doubt it will just let us take it, so be careful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
