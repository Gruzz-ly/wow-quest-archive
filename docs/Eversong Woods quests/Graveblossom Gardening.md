==Objectives==
Gather 8 Pristine Graveblossoms for [[Talandra Dawnsprite]] at [[Windrunner Village]].
* [[Pristine Graveblossom]] (8)

==Description==
My colleague [[Amalthea Dawnsprite|Amalthea]] has taken ill. She requires a specialized poultice of sorts in order to ease the symptoms. I would forage for the plants myself, but the local fauna have grown so testy of late! 

While you are out and about, could you gather some graveblossoms for me? I'd happily make it worth your while.
