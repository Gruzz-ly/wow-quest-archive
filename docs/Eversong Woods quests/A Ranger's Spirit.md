==Description==
Taemin has proved himself as capable as any [[Farstriders|Farstrider]] today. But I'm afraid he might not see it that way.

He came to us with such lofty ideas about the [[Elven ranger|rangers]]--all those swashbuckling adventure stories, all the romantic old lengends. But at the end of the day, being a ranger is mostly... chores. Difficult, boring, important chores.

Why don't you go talk to him, and make sure he's not too disappointed?
