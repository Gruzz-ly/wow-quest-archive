==Objectives==
Find [[Magister Umbric]].
*Find Umbric
*[[Secretary Faloria]] slain
*[[Jeweled Key]] collected
*[[Plans of Infiltration]] collected

==Description==
Umbric went to chase down [[Antenorian]] when the fighting broke out, but nobody has seen him since.

I trust him to hold his own, but between [[Kasiea]]'s death and [[Antenorian]]'s betrayal. I worry he may be so set on revenge that he won't see an attack if one happens. Can you find him for me?

I'll stay here and make sure these civilians remain safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Shroud of Treachery]]
* [[Corrupted Twilight Cowl]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090[[XP]]

==Progress==
I will not allow them to get away with this.

==Completion==
A map of Eversong? With multiple villages marked by the Twilight's Blade!

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|<Name>, find Umbric. I'll keep guard here.}}

Go to Antenorian's Office where Umbric is battling [[Secretary Faloria]].
:{{Text|Say|Secretary Faloria|So easily fooled.}}

Slay Secretary Faloria and colect [[Jeweled Key]] from her. Take the [[Plans of Infiltration]] from the [[Ominous Lockbox]].
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Antenorian was two steps ahead the entire time I was here. Let's return to my study.}}

Return to Umbric's lab where Umbric is speaking to Arator.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|We've rescued who we can, but my research...}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|What was in that lockbox?}}
