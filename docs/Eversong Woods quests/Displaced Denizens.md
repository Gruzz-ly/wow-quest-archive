==Objectives==
Study 3 disturbances caused by displaced wildlife and 3 unusual plants in [[Fairbreeze Village]].
*Disturbances investigated (3)
*Strange plants examined (3)

==Description==
The wildlife here seems to have been upset by something. Perhaps this is why the world's song bade me here, to discover why and correct it.

Study the displaced wildlife. Bring me your findings. If there is anything unusual, I wish to know of it. I will speak with the magistrix. Perhaps together we can uncover this mystery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,295 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you do as I asked?

==Completion==
This lightbloom--it seems to be the cause of every trouble here.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[Sharpmaw (quest)]], [[Fairbreeze Favors]], & '''Displaced Denizens'''
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|Magistrix, when did you first begin seeing these disturbances with this Lightbloom?}}
:{{Text|Say|Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider|Hmm, perhaps when the Sunwell blew sky high into that swirling vortex? ...sorry. I'm a bit overwhelmed.}}

Head to the [[Hasty Nest]] that is nearby the stairs.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|This nest... it's being choked by the Lightbloom growth. Let's fix this.}}

Go to the [[Territorial Dispute]] that is nearby the villagers and inspect it.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Ugh! It looks--and smells--like the local pets were marking their territory. They're obviously distressed.}}

Walk to the [[Trampled Bush]] that is nearby a building.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|This bush was trampled--the poor wildlife here must be terrified.}}

Walk to the [[Strange Lightbloom Plant]] that's nearby the hill and examine it.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|The Lightbloom first appeared when the Sunwell was restored, many years ago.}}

Head to the Strange Lightbloom Plant that is nearby the Wagon and examine it.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Perhaps this sudden growth is tied to the empowerment of the Sunwell. I think I was right--this could be used to help the Vanguard.}}

Head to the Strange Lightbloom Plant that is nearby the lamppost and examine it.
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|The nearest Lightbloom is nowhere near the village. How did the growth get all the way out here?}}

Return to [[Orweyna]] and [[Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider]] to turn in three quests.
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|This Lightbloom you describe is clearly out of control. WE must find what has disturbed it so.}}
