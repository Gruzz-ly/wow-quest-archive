==Objectives==
Contact [[Silvermoon]].
*Contact Silvermoon

==Description==
This growth--[[Lor'themar]] needs to know about this. I worry what will happen should it get out of control.

And the [[Light]]'s influence... my [[Turalyon|father]] should know, too.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090[[XP]]

==Completion==
Nothing further to be done here, then.

Let's go see [[Magister Umbric|Umbric]].

==Notes==
Speak to Arator.
