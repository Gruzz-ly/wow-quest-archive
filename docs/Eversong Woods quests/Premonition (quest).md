==Objectives==
Regroup with [[Lor'themar Theron]] at [[Scintilas Outpost]].

==Description==
I came as quickly as I could. This is... devastating.

I have called in our [[magisters]] to reinforce this runestone. They will keep an eye on the [[lightbloom]] spread.

I suspect [[Halduron Brightwing]] and the [[Farstriders]] have uncovered more than the villagers know. I can rely on him for anything. We shall rendezvous with him at the encampment to the north, and soon have some answers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,650[[XP]]

==Completion==
<Lor'themar falls still, eyes on the shore ahead.>

==Notes==

:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Thank you, Liadrin. I hope Halduron can tell us what's going on.}}
:''Lor'themar, [[Turalyon]], and [[Arator the Redeemer]] head north.''

Go to [[Scintilas Outpost]] and meet up with the party.
