*[[Outrunner Alarion]] rescued

==Description==
You see what we have to contend with here. [[Runestone Shan'dor]] is helping stop the spread further north, but if this lightbloom surges again, I don't know if we can halt it. 

I've heard cries for help from survivors still trapped within. We have to find them, and direct them to safety!

You will receive one of:
* [[Suncrown Savior's Drape]]
* [[Bloomtrimmer's Wrap]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,255[[XP]]

==Completion==
Some live... I am grateful, as are they.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''What's Left''' and [[Choking Tendrils]],
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|It is as if the wilds themselves devoured this place.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|This is horrific--Fairbreeze was nothing compared to it.}}
:''Lady Liadrin and Arator leaves.''

Across Suncrown, aid the Suncrown Survivors.

Upon reaching [[Apprentice Erilia]] who is inside a lightbloom infested-building,
{{dialogue|My home... what now?

{{gossip|quest=|<Instruct the defender go to the [[Runestone Shan'dor]], where it is safe.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Apprentice Erilia|The Lightbloom was across the river--why did it surge here?}}


Upon reaching [[Magistrix Silanna]],
{{dialogue|We were trying to get out of here but we're flanked on all sides.

I don't want to find out what that thing is below, but it's our only path of escape!

{{gossip|quest=|I'll cover your escape. Go quickly!}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Magistrix Silanna|There was a crash to north, and then... the Lightbloom was everywhere!}}

Upon reaching [[Outrunner Alarion]] at the upper floor,
{{dialogue|There's no way out, they've completely surrounded the town.

{{gossip|quest=|<Instruct the defender go to the Runestone Shan'dor, where it is safe.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Outrunner Alarion|I thought I heard trolls shouting to the north. That can't be right.}}

Upon reaching [[Trainee Solanin]],
{{dialogue|I won't let them destroy anything else!

{{gossip|quest=|<Instruct the defender go to the Runestone Shan'dor, where it is safe.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Trainee Solanin|It sounded as if someone felled a tree. The Farstriders left to investigate.}}

Head to [[Runestone Shan'dor]] where Arator and Liadrin are with [[Lor'themar Theron]] and [[Turalyon]] and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|So the crash caused the Lightbloom to surge... thank you. Rest easy and leave this to us.}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|The Farstriders left to investigate that noise. Suncrown had no defenders.}}
