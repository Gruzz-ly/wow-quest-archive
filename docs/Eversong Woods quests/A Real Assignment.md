==Objectives==
Find [[Captain Dawnrunner]] at [[Farstrider Enclave]].

==Description==
Captain Dawnrunner was supposed to check on the Enclave and then meet us here. She's as capable a [[Elven ranger|ranger]] as any! It's a bad sign if she's been detained.

Farstrider Enclave is usually where they do wilderness training. With all the trouble however, everyone's been dispatched elsewhere. She could be up there alone, in serious danger!

There's no time to lose. I'm going to save my Captain and prove myself as a [[Farstriders|Farstrider]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]
