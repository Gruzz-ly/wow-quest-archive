==Objectives==
Rescue 8 innocent Tranquillien Citizens.
*Tranquillien Citizens rescued (8)

==Description==
We can't let the Twilight's Blade get away with this. There are innocent citizens all over town who had nothing to do with this cult. You heard the governor--anyone who doesn't join will be executed.

I won't stand for that.

Go, aid any civilians you can find. Get them out of harm's way. If they're being attacked, take their attacker down. Tranquillien will not fall under my watch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090[[XP]]

==Completion==
We'll need to do more to reverse the damage done here, but this was a good first step. Thank you.

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[The Battle for Tranquillien]], [[The Traitors of Tranquillien]], & '''The Heart of Tranquillien'''
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I will not stand by as that cult takes this town!}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|See to the citizens. I'll find Antenorian... and make him pay.}}
:''Arator runs out of Umbric's lab as Umbric teleports out.''

Across Tranquillien, rescue the [[Tranquillien Citizen]]s and [[Cowed Hawkstrider]]s.

Head to Tranquillien Inn and turn in all three quests.
