==Objectives==
Collect the Depleted Wardbreaker, then charge it using 4 arcane reservoirs.
* [[Depleted Wardbreaker]]
* [[Wardbreaker]] charged (4)

==Description==
You will forgive the lack of pleasantries, as this situation requires prompt remediation.

All you need know is that I am Aradis, wardsmith of [[Silvermoon]]. We are an order of [[magisters]] who maintain the city's defenses.

I am recovering from a... minor battle injury, and require aid charging my Wardbreaker staff. You will be compensated, and perhaps provided additional opportunities to aid me.

I can furnish the details as you work, so long as you are not terribly slow.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
