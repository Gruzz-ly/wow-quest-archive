==Objectives==
Take the Cracked Wyrm Core, then investigate Murder Row to discover the source of the smuggled [[fel wyrm]]s.
* [[Cracked Wyrm Core]]
* [[Murder Row]] [[merchant]]s questioned (3)
* [[Smuggler's Signet]]
* [[Soothsayer's Signet]]
* [[Rogue's Signet]]
* [[Den of Indulgence]] located
* [[Vira Bloodsong|Vira]] found
* Speak to Vira
* [[Shipping Manifest]]

==Description==
Based on what we discovered, I believe the [[fel]] is coming from Murder Row. Someone there is breaking down [[Burning Legion|Legion]] relics and infusing the [[magic]] into [[mana wyrm]]s for covert siphoning--and people are buying it up in droves.

We need to figure out who that someone is.

Take this wyrm core with you into the Row and look for more of them. The promise of coin should get you in front of the right person.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
