==Objectives==
Return to [[Lor'themar Theron]] in [[Silvermoon City]].

==Description==
You handled yourself well.

These documents are too important to pass through couriers or [[raven]]s. I'd like you to deliver them personally to Lor'themar. He'll want to see the truth for himself and know who brought it back.

Keep them close, and don't let anyone else near them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|17|55}}
* 8,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Lor'themar examines the documents carefully. After a moment, he looks up at you and allows a faint smile.>

Excellent work. I knew I could count on you both.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
