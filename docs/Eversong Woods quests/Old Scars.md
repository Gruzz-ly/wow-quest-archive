==Objectives==
Disrupt the Amani lumber operation in [[Tor'Watha]].

==Description==
Of course the [[Amani]] would use this moment to encroach, the cowards. We are beset on all sides!

This land belongs to the [[sin'dorei]], and I will not see it taken by anyone. Not by raging plants, not by a cult, not by the void, and never by the Amani!

Whatever they are doing over there, it must be stopped. Do whatever you can to disrupt them and send them scurrying back to [[Zul'Aman]] where they belong.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Burnt Watha'nan Robes]]
* [[Burnt Watha'nan Jerkin]]
* [[Burnt Watha'nan Chainmail]]
* [[Burnt Watha'nan Breastplate]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,255 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Well done.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Old Scars''' & [[A Foe Unseen]],
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|That tree they felled--that's what caused Suncrown's destruction! The Amani will pay for this!}}
:''Lor'themar Theron, Arator, and [[Turalyon]] depart.''

Fill the bar up by slaying [[Amani Feller]]s (7%), [[Amani Watcher]]s (7%), [[Amani Enforcer]]s (11%), and [[Cre'van]] and destroying Objects (6%) and supplies.

Return to the party and turn in both quests.
