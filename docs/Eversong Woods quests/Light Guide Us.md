==Objectives==
Resolve the battle at Amani Pass by helping the blood elves secure it, or try to dissuade the blood elves from fighting.
*Resolve the battle at Amani Pass
*Sin'dorei forces dissuaded (8) (Optional)
*[[Sin'dorei Banner]]s planted and [[Amani Banner]]s destroyed (8) (Optional)
*Find Lor'themar at the top of Amani Pass

==Description==
Our findings at [[Tor'Watha]] were correct. By the time [[Turalyon]] and I arrived here with troops, the Amani had already begun to take the pass. They seek to establish another path to acquire the Lightwood from our land.

The Amani have chosen war, as they always do. This, at least, is a threat I know how to handle.

[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] is but a boy. He cannot grasp the magnitude of history between the sin'dorei and Amani--and I don't expect him to.

Will you stand by the blood elves, and all that is right?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of: 
* [[Eversong Defender's Crown]]
* [[Eversong Defender's Hood]]
* [[Eversong Defender's Helmet]]
* [[Eversong Defender's Helm]]

You will also receive: 
* {{cost|70|20}}
* 19,855 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There he is--the one who leads this little incursion.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|If you will not fight, get out of my way!}}
:''[[Arator the Redeemer]] backs off as Lor'themar and his troops begins''

Plant the Sin'dorei Banners across the Amani Pass.

Upon placing the two Sin'dorei banners where Arator is,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|This bloodshed... it's madness. Where is [[Turalyon|my father]]? He must see this by now!}}

Burn down the Amani banners. 

Try to convince the Sin'dorei forces

[[Grand Magister Rommath]] is present at the Amani Pass and he has a gossip,

Head to Arator and [[Lady Liadrin]] that are near the banner.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We have to stop this!}}

:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|It is too late, Arator. But we can heal those in need.}}

Head to the top where Lor'themar Theron, Rommath, Turalyon, and Arator are confronting the [[Amani Towerbreaker]]s and [[Zul'jan]].
