==Objectives==
Complete the Deatholme delve.
*Deatholme delve entered
*[[Lord Antenorian]] slain
*Stolen Knowledge reclaimed

==Description==
I did not expect this place to be so heavily guarded. This is far more complicated than one charismatic leader and a group of wayward pilgrims. Still... if we take out Antenorian, it should weaken them considerably. A cult is nothing without its leader.

Valeera tracked the governor to that cavern. He's gone in. We'll make sure he never comes out.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Twilight Tamer's Mantle]]
* [[Twilight Tamer's Shoulderpads]]
* [[Twilight Tamer's Spaulders]]
* [[Twilight Tamer's Pauldrons]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|93|60}}
*26,180[[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's be done with this. The Twilight's Blade must fall.

==Completion==
Kasiea's notes! At long last! I must go!

==Notes and trivia==

:{{Text|Yell|Lord Antenorian|Infiltrators seek to destroy all we have accomplished! Cut them down!}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|The coward created a barrier. Destroy the Void Foci to collapse it.}}

Destroy the two Void Focuses to break the barrier down,

:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|They look eager to die for him. Let's not keep them waiting.}}

Upon disrupting 3 Rituals,
:{{Text|Yell|Lord Antenorian|Do not fear, my devoted. With your strength I open a new path!}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|He's using them to open a portal! Don't let him escape.}}

Upon slaying the first of [[Antenorian's Devoted]],
:{{Text|Say|Antenorian's Devoted|We will be saved...}}

Upon slaying the second [[Antenorian's Devoted]],
:{{Text|Say|Antenorian's Devoted|Antenorian opens the way...}}

Upon slaying the last, the portal closes.
:{{Text|Say|Lord Antenorian|I will not die like them!}}

Upon slaying him
:{{Text|Say|Lord Antenorian|I did... all... I was asked...}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|Alone in the dark, desperate, still pining for power. A fitting end.}}

Loot the [[Stolen Knowledge (quest item)]] from Antenorian.

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|These notes have to hold the answer! Kasiea... I'll make sure you didn't die in vain. Arator, tell Lor'themar he has my aid.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|I'll be in touch the moment I have a solution.}}
:''Umbric took his leave.''

The name of the quest may be a reference to the phrase: ''Fire walk with me.'' from the TV series {{Wp|Twin Peaks}}.
