==Objectives==
Help Arator reforge [[Turalyon|his father]]'s shield.
* Speak with [[Arator]]
* Assist Arator in Reforging
* Check on Arator

==Description==
<Name>, it is time to see what we can do with these fragments of Turalyon's shield.

While it did break, it was exceptionally powerful in its day, and it could be a great help to Turalyon against the [[void]].

Perhaps a moment of healing and letting go, as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
<Name>, that did not go as I hoped, to say the least.

I'd hoped he would be able to see... to accept that he could still change.

But it doesn't look like he's open to that. At least not now.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|I'll pull Turalyon away from his duties. Not an easy feat by any means.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|It will give Arator time to finish re-forging his father's shield. He could use your assistance.}}
:''Alonsus walks off into the Sanctum of Light.''

Head to the Bazaar and speak with Arator,
{{dialogue|It's been eye-opening to see where my father started, <name>.

The way he was--that's the kind of paladin I wish to be. Not what he became.

Will you help me?

:{{Text|Say|Arator|Let's do this! I'll hammer you control the heat!}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Add some wyrmdust to make it more powerful.}}

Take the [[Pile of Wyrmdust]] to put into the forge
:{{Text|Say|Arator|It's too hot! Pour some water on the shield to cool it.}}

Take the [[Water (Silvermoon)|Water]] to put into the forge
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I need another steel ingot.}}

Take the [[Steel Ingot]] to put into the forge
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Add a phoenix feather to increase the heat.}}

Take the [[Phoenix Feather]] to put into the forge and  a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Forgiveness" starts playing:

:''Arator puts his hand on Turalyon's shield.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|My son...}}
:''Turalyon approaches Arator as the latter turns to look at the former.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|Arator, I...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|I was hoping to...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|That we could--}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|Father.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|I know you'd never willingly hurt me.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|But in that [[Past Redemption|moment]],}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|you lost control.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|Could you ever forgive me?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|I think...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|It's time you forgave yourself.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|I know what happened the [[Siege of Blackrock Spire|day]] [[Anduin Lothar|Lothar]] fell.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|The guilt--}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|--the rage--}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|--you've carried all these years...}}
:''Arator picks up the shield showing it to Turalyon.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|It's time to let it go.}}
:''Turalyon turns to see his shield. He puts his hand on it.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|My... my shield.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|How? How did you--}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|Take it up again.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|Be the paladin you were born to be.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|I...}}
:''Turalyon sighs.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|I can't.}}
:''He turns to walk away.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|That part of me died with Lothar.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|But not all of you.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|Don't give up hope, father.}}
:''Turalyon turns to look at Arator.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|My son, some things...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon|...can't ever be redeemed.}}
:''Turalyon departs.''

:''On the other side of the cutscene, [[Danath Trollbane]], [[Kurdran Wildhammer]], [[Alonsus Faol]], and [[Eitrigg]] appeared standing before Arator''

Speak with Arator again,
{{dialogue|I had hoped my father would take up his shield, <name>, and his old role as a protector.

But he apparently isn't ready. Maybe he never will be.

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask Arator how he is.> }}

{{gossip|What will you do next? {{text|red|<Skip the conversation.>}}}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Why do you still have the shield? Didn't you give it to your father?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I did. He said "some things can't ever be redeemed" and refused it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|That's... disappointing. I had hoped for a different reaction.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|So did I... but a wise man once told me "I can't change anything but how I feel."}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|So I'm going to focus on that. My father may not be ready to change, but I am.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Arator... Light be praised, perhaps this all happened for a reason.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I just need to figure out what to do with this shield.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdran Wildhammer|I could use a hot meal and a drink while you ponder. Come with us, lad. You too, <name>.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|I must return to the [[Sunwell]]. The Vanguard needs my counsel.}}
