==Objectives==
Meet Umbric at the ritual site in [[Windrunner Village]]. There, collect 4 Void Shards and return them to the void nexus.

*Stay awhile and listen to [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] (Optional)
*[[Void Shard]]s subsumed (4)

==Description==
Kasiea's notes may be lost forever--but we must try and improvise. I have one final ritual to try.

If this doesn't work, then the answers lay in Deatholme, the Twilight's Blade's heart. But first...

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Depleted Voidshard Ring]]
* [[Voidtainted Ritual Band]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090[[XP]]

==Completion==
No! No... I was so close.

<Umbric collects himself, a paradigm of focus.>

[[Deatholme]] it is, then. The base of the Twilight's Blade.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|I'm going to try to decipher Kasiea's notes one last time. They may be the key to unraveling the Voidstorm.}}
:''Magister Umbric leaves''

Speak to Arator,

:{{Text|Say|Arator|[[Vereesa Windrunner|Vereesa]] used to tell me stories of this place. They held festivals, her brother [[Lirath Windrunner|Lirath]] would play. The air was filled with laughter and song.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|It's hard to imagine any of that now. It's just... broken. Gone. Nothing left but echoes.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Was [[Alleria Windrunner|my mother]] one of those that filled the air with laughter? Did [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] sing? Were my grandparents...}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I suppose it's useless to think about it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|My mother... I haven't heard from her in weeks.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We don't speak often, but it just feels different this time. With everything that's happened, that storm in the sky, the Void...}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Worry solves nothing. What we need is a sword and a capable hand, and I've both of those.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Still... I wish I'd seen this place while it still lived.}}

Head to the ritual Site where Magister Umbric and Arator are waiting.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|<Name>! Bring those void shards to the center portal. If I'm right, it should reverse the path and open the way to the Voidstorm.}}

Upon subsuming the Void shards,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|No! We were so close...}}
