==Objectives==
Destroy the Communications Orbs in [[Zeb'tela Ruins]].
* [[Communications Orb]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
The [[Twilight's Blade]] slipped into [[Tranquillien]] so easily because they'd stolen knowledge and secrets. About our defenses, our [[magic]], our people. Once inside, they uncovered even more information. 

Now they pass that intelligence between themselves using enchanted orbs. Quiet whispers drifting through the dark. Every message tightens the noose around [[Quel'Thalas]].

Find the orbs. Break them. Every shattered crystal is a whisper silenced.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Well done. The less they know, the safer our people are.
