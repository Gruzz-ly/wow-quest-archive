==Description==
It's hard to believe this used to be the [[Dead Scar]].

Up here, close to the city, the land has almost completely recovered. Which is good, because we've got a lot of mouths to feed.

[[Hawkstrider]]s are the perfect helpers for preparing the soil--their tough claws can easily spread seeds and squash bugs!

Meet me down in the Tranquil Repose and I'll saddle one up for you.
