==Objectives==
Meet Arator at [[Watha'nan Crypts]] in [[Eversong]].
*Meet Arator at the entrance of [[Watha'nan Crypts]]
*Stay awhile and listen to [[Halduron Brightwing|Halduron]] (Optional)
*[[Warding Totem]]s destroyed (4)
*Speak to Arator

==Description==
[[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]] has a right to defend this land--but I don't think he's seeing clearly. The presence of [[Amani]] is too inciting.

This doesn't add up. The trolls are going out of their way to craft lightbloom weapons--to fight what? It isn't us. They didn't attack [[Suncrown]]. They could have, and they didn't.

We need to find the truth. Let's head south. That hideout I discovered must have some answers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I had hoped for better results.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Lor'themar, we found evidence of a nearby hideout--}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The Amani Pass takes priority. I will not let them invade [[Quel'Thalas]] again.}}
:''Lor'themar runs off''
:{{Text|Say|[[Turalyon|High Exarch Turalyon]]|Investigate if you must, Arator. But I expect you at the pass in short order.}}

[[Halduron Brightwing]] has a gossip,
{{dialogue|Thank you for your aid. Lor'themar told me of what happened in Suncrown.

Suncrown was under my watch, but we heard the felling of the tree and left to investigate the noise. I thought perhaps it was the lightbloom's doing--I never expected the Amani to encroach so brazenly.

I'll see to the lightbloom. Lor'themar can see to the Amani... let us just hope he does not give them his other eye in the process.

<Halduron winks.>

:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|The Amani were only the source of a bigger problem.}}
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|The Lightbloom has never acted like this before. The forests had only small pockets of growth.}}
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|But the moment the Sunwell surged--it changed everything. Every pocket of Lightbloom has grown into dense thickets, teeming with strange wildlife.}}
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|I cannot leave this unchecked. Lor'themar said you had someone knowledgeable with you in Fairbreeze?}}
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|I need to speak with them. My expertise lies with the forests. This problem, I can surely solve.}}
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|The other issues... well, you've proven yourself competent many times over. Take care.}}

Head to [[Watha'nan Crypts]] and meet up with Arator.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|This is the place--covered in runes and well warded, it seems.}}

Break the two warding totems and the force field vanish.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I suspect the Amani didn't want any uninvited guests. Lucky these wards are old.}}

Upon breaking the [[Grimfire Totem]] & the [[Stranglemist Totem]],
:{{Text|Say|Arator|If they were this well guarded, we'll want to take care ahead. Follow me, and keep quiet.}}

Speak to Arator,
{{dialogue|<Arator falls still, gesturing to you to do the same.>

Wait. Someone's coming.

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Zul'jan's First Appearance" starts playing,
:''Arator and the adventurer eavesdrop on [[Zul'jan]] talking to a [[Captured Twilight Magister|Twilight's Blade cultist]], as [[Vanatha]] observes.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|You invaded our land.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|You killed my people.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|For what?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|To conquer?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|To claim what was never yours?}}
:''Zul'jan brings up the Lightbloom weapon.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|This is what you fear, isn't it?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|Not the blade, but what it contains.}}
:''He turns to approach the Magister.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|The Light...}}
:''Zul'jan raises the blade.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|Some say a comfort,}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|but so easily honed into this.}}
:''Zul'jan kills a [[Decimated Voidling|void creature]] with a Lightbloom weapon, and that scares the cultist. He kneels to look at the magister.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|There is the fear.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|What do you think?}}
:''Zul'jan raises the blade pointing it towards the magister.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|Anything to say?}}
:''Offscreen, Zul'jan cuts down the Magister as Arator and the Adventurer looks away.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|I didn't think so.}}

On the other side of the Cutscene, Arator stood in front of the Decimated Voidling and the Captured Twilight Magister.
