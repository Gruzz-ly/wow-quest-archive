==Objectives==
Dismantle the fel smuggling operation inside Murder Row.
* Stop the [[fel]] smuggling operation in [[Murder Row]]

==Description==
We have all the puzzle pieces. [[Zaen Bladesorrow|Zaen]] smuggles fel relics from the [[Broken Isles]] by stacking the [[Silvermoon Harbor]] with his own smugglers. The relics are processed in Murder Row, then fel magic is infused into [[mana wyrm]]s for sale and siphoning. All for the sake of power by those who fear the [[Void]].

Such a convoluted operation might be impressive, if the goals weren't so foolish.

Let us end it. We'll find the [[Illicit Rain]] in Murder Row and clear it out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60}}
* 23,550 [[XP]]
