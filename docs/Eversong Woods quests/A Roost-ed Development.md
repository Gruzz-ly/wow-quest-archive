==Objectives==
Collect Golden Sunleaf at [[Stillwhisper Pond]].
*[[Golden Sunleaf]] (6)

==Description==
A comfortable [[hawkstrider]] is a happy hawkstrider. We don't expect them to stand all day, they need someplace cozy to roost!

There's a plant called Golden Sunleaf that sprouts just beyond the ridge. It makes the softest bedding--the hawkstriders love it. Could you gather some for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the Golden Sunleaf?

==Completion==
Oh, they'll have many a happy night's sleep on this! You have my thanks.

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[One Adventurous Hatchling]], [[A Hungry Flock]], & '''A Roost-ed Development''',
