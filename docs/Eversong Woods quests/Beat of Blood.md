==Objectives==
Meet [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] in [[Amani Pass]].

==Description==
None of this is necessary. We need to make them see reason!

[[Turalyon|My father]] will know what to do. I know he'll see reason, once I explain what has happened here. There is no need for bloodshed! It's simple--if the [[Amani tribe|Amani]] are set against the [[Twilight's Blade]], we fight on the same side.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I must put a stop to this.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Quickly, we need to get to Amani Pass and tell them the truth of what is happening!}}
:''Arator begins to run.''

Head to the [[Amani Pass]] as Arator is confronting [[Lor'themar Theron]].
:{{Text|Say|Arator|It's the Twilight's Blade! They're the true threat!}}
