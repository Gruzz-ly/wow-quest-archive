==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Captain Dorynth Bloodwake.png|Captain Dorynth Bloodwake|Give Captain Dorynth Bloodwake a permenant vacation.}}
Defeat Captain Dorynth Bloodwake in [[Sunsail Anchorage]].
* Use [[Grappling Hook Rope|Grappling Hook]] to board ship (Optional)
* [[Captain Dorynth Bloodwake|Captain Dorynth Tideborne]] slain

==Description==
The [[naga]] acted out of desperation. [[Tideborne]]'s crew, however, is driven by arrogance. They sit smugly aboard their ship, convinced of their invulnerability, counting their ill-gotten wealth. It is time we put an end to that.

Captain Bloodwake shall be made to answer for every crate, every transaction, and every transgression. Are you prepared to extract the truth?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 14,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Good work. I am sure there will be more figures like him in the future, but at least for today, this port is safe thanks to you.

I hope I can count on you again in the future, partner.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lyssara Duskmourne|Let's make sure the captain takes a permanent vacation...}}

Head to [[Sunsail Anchorage]] and either use the [[Grappling Hook Rope]] or a Flying mount to get on the ship and confront Captain Dorynth.

Upon completion,
