==Objectives==
Defeat 10 Tideborne Naga in [[Sunset Strand]].
* [[Tideborne]] [[Naga]] slain (10)

==Description==
Tideborne's decision to discard crates into the ocean was no mere error. It was a calculated delivery.

Pursue them, and ensure the naga are reminded of the grave consequences they face when they dare to cross us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Well done. The naga may have been handled, but our work is far from complete. Tideborne Freight continues to pull the strings, and it is time we sever their control.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both [[Cargo Collateral]] & '''Dead to Rights''',
:{{Text|Say|Lyssara Duskmourne|Follow their trail down the hill. I suspect they will not be happy to see us.}}

HHead down the strand and slay the [[Tideborne Smuggler]]s and [[Tideborne Freighter]]s and then meet up with Lyssara to turn in both quests.
