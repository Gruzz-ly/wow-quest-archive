==Objectives==
Meet [[Solwin Brightstitch]] at the manasilk mill in the [[North Sanctum]].

==Description==
How on [[Azeroth]] one of these encroaching [[paladin]]s managed to come by such an exquisite example of [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Thalassian]] tailoring is beyond me. But it would be negligent of me to turn down this opportunity.

The materials we need are far more bespoke than I keep in my shop, however. We'll need to source our manasilk directly--fortunately, it isn't far. Just outside [[Silvermoon City|the city]] gates.

And at least there we'll be safe from these dabblers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]
