==Objectives==
Meet [[Ranger Astarae]] at the [[Central Tower]].

==Description==
Ranger Astarae is one of our veterinarians. She usually cares for our [[lynx]]es, but the [[mana wyrm]] molt is too crucial to the health of the forest to go unmonitored.

The wyrms regulate the flow of [[magic]] from the [[ley line]]s to the rest of the woods. When the ley lines were disrupted, so was their molting season. It's not so dire as it once was, but they still need help from time to time.

Meet Astarae at the central tower. She can tell you more.
