==Objectives==
Find information to what the [[Forest troll|trolls]] are doing in [[Tor'Watha]].
* [[Amani tribe|Amani]] operations investigated (5)

==Description==
I know [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]] is angry, but... this is strange, <name>. They didn't attack [[Suncrown]], the [[lightbloom]] did. What are the Amani doing over there?

There has to be some kind of explanation for this. It doesn't look like an invasion. Let's see what we can find out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
What have you found?

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both [[Old Scars]] & '''A Foe Unseen'''
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|That tree they felled--that's what caused Suncrown's destruction! The Amani will pay for this!}}
:''Lor'themar Theron, Arator, and [[Turalyon]] depart.''

Head to [[Tor'Watha]] and find [[Vanatha]].
:{{Text|Say|Vanatha|[[Zul'jan]] must be warned--our assault at the Pass begins! Deal with them!}}

There's the [[Supply Shipment]] that has to be investiaged and investigate the [[Amani Missive]] and the [[Lightbloom Lumber Stack]] and inspect the [[Dead Amani Feller]].

Return to the party and turn in both quests.
