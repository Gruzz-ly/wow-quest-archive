==Objectives==
Use the Wardbreaker to enter Magister Dawnblaze's study, then find the Incriminating Documents.
* [[Magister Dawnblaze|Dawnblaze]]'s ward destroyed
* [[Incriminating Documents (Midnight)]]

==Description==
The entrance to Dawnblaze's study is in the terrace just beneath us.

Since my [[magic]] can project this close to her wards, that means the [[magic]] guarding this place has been weakened... as I predicted.

Break the larger ward sealing the entrance and find the documents she forged to slander me. I will expect your expedient return to my office thereafter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
