==Objectives==
Inspect 5 Intercepted Shipments.
* Intercepted Shipments inspected (5)

==Description==
<A bite wound wrecks [[Hathvelion Sungaze|Hathvelion]]'s forearm.>

[[Snapdragon]]s... cruel creatures made to kill and feed. Their poison moves as you move. The [[naga]] bred the perfect pet.

I'm here on a tip from [[Lyssara Duskmourne]]. [[Sunsail Anchorage]]'s shipping routes have been sabotaged by the naga, and those routes converge... here.

I intercepted a few shipments. Could you help me search them? My team is still out in the field, but they should report back soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Lyssara's suspicions proved correct. The naga must be collecting arcane magic from sources all around Eversong--we must put a stop to it, immediately.

==Notes==
Upon arrival as Hathvelion Sungaze was tended by [[Numia Golden]],
:{{Text|Say|Hathvelion Sungaze|First [[murloc]]s, now [[naga]]! Augh, what's next?}}
:{{Text|Say|Numia Golden|Your slow and painful death, if you don't keep still!}}

Inspect:
*[[Vintage Vintage]]
*[[Magical Mango]]
*[[Unstable Arcana (Eversong Woods)]]
*[[Perfectly Fine Grain]]
*[[Discarded Wand]]

Upon inspecting the Magical Mango,
:{{Text|Say|Hathvelion Sungaze|The Naga are smuggling black market fruit? No, that can't be it...}}

Upon inspecting the Perfectly Fine Grain,
:{{Text|Say|Hathvelion Sungaze|Ever have an ancient grain croissant? The chew is more satisfying than landing a bullseye.}}

Upon inspecting the Vintage Vintage,
:{{Text|Say|Hathvelion Sungaze|That's one of [[Grand Magister Rommath|Rommath]]'s favorites. He'd teleport here personally if it went missing.}}

Upon inspecting the Unstable Arcana,
:{{Text|Say|Hathvelion Sungaze|Unstable arcana... this must be what we're looking for!}}

Upon inspecting the Discarded Wand,
:{{Text|Say|Hathvelion Sungaze|Who throws away a perfectly good wand? Are you magisters that picky?}}
:{{Text|Say|Numia Golden|We are. But there's probably another reason for its discard.}}

Upon completion,
:''[[Ranger Krenn'an]] walks in''
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Krenn'an|Captain Sungaze! News from the coast!}}
:{{Text|Say|Ranger Krenn'an|I still haven't located the whereabouts of Goldenmist's missing villagers. And now [[Ranger Vedoran]] is missing too.}}
