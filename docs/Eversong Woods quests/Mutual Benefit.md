==Objectives==
Show Jaeth the incriminating documents about [[Magister Aradis|Aradis]].
* Show the documents to [[Jaeth]]

==Description==
<Jaeth waves a hand to cut you off as you explain.>

All right, [[Magister Dawnblaze|Dawnblaze]] sent you. That means there's a job. Not surprised she doesn't want to dirty her robes coming to the [[Murder Row|Row]] herself. The types who hire us never do.

Everyone that high up in [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]] backstabs each other. When it's literal, they pay us to do it for them. They get whatever power they're chasing, and we get enough coin to live another week.

Whose back is getting a knife this time?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
