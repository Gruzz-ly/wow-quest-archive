==Objectives==
Cull the lightbloom in [[Suncrown]]
*Lightbloom creatures slain.

==Description==
I haven't the expertise of [[Orweyna]] in these matters. But if the lightbloom moved this quickly. I assume the rutaani are accelerating the spread here just as they were in [[Fairbreeze]].

The town is beyond saving, but we can at least try to contain the lightbloom within its walls.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,255[[XP]]

==Completion==
Good work--we've cut back what we can. I only hope it's enough.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both [[What's Left]] and '''Choking Tendrils''',
:{{Text|Say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|It is as if the wilds themselves devoured this place.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|This is horrific--Fairbreeze was nothing compared to it.}}
:''Lady Liadrin and Arator leaves.''

Fill the bar up by slaying the [[Incubating Lasher]]s (5%), [[Bloom Propagator]]s (10%), [[Infused Seedling]]s (3%), [[Bloom Dominator]]s (15%), [[Lucent Hookbeak]]s & [[Overfester Hydra]]s.

Head to [[Runestone Shan'dor]] where Arator and Liadrin are with [[Lor'themar Theron]] and [[Turalyon]] and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|So the crash caused the Lightbloom to surge... thank you. Rest easy and leave this to us.}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|The Farstriders left to investigate that noise. Suncrown had no defenders.}}
