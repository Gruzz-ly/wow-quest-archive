==Objectives==
Return to [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]]
*Speak to [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]]

==Description==
[[Lady Liadrin]] will remain here. The rest of us shall return to Silvermoon and debrief.

<Lor'themar looks at the devastated [[Turalyon]].>

We still have many battles ahead, it seems.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*[[Silvermoon Wartable]]
*{{cost|70|20}}
*19,855 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Would that I could join you, but there is much still to do here in Silvermoon.

You have your objectives. Keep in touch.

As for [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]... I hope you find him soon. Anu belore dela'na, <Name>.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Lady Liadrin, secure the pass. For good or ill, we've taken a stand here. We should keep it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The rest of us will return to Silvermoon. There is... much to discuss.}}
:''Lor'themar, [[Grand Magister Rommath]], and [[Turalyon]] leaves.''

Lady Liadrin has a gossip:
{{dialogue|I will keep watch here as the Regent Lord commands. Perhaps I can prevent any more bloodshed from happening. I only hope our decisive victory deters the Amani from another attack.

[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]... I worry for him.

Both of you were on the right trail. If it is truly as he says--that the Amani fight the [[Twilight's Blade]]--then we have good cause to rethink our strategy.

Find him, <name>. His instincts are telling.}}

Head to the [[Sanctum of Light]] where Lor'themar, Rommath, and Turalyon are standing.
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Champion, you've uncovered many threats that besiege Quel'thalas. We must plan our next move together.}}

Speak to Lor'themar,
{{dialogue|I thank you for your efforts thus far. You've staved off that blasted lightbloom. uncovered a cult, and defended our people from an Amani incursion.

Yet there is far more to be done in each circumstance. If we hope to see a brighter future, we must learn more. Let us consider our next steps.

:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The Amani crossed a line. We need to make sure their encroachment has ended.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Lady Liadrin is in [[Zul'Aman]] now, looking into the situation. She'll need backup.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|The Lightbloom is still an ever present threat.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|Your... contact has been investigating the overgrowth. Perhaps she has found something of value.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The Sunwell can only be empowered for so long. Those who are maintaining its current state are under immense strain.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Turalyon, how does our army fare?}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|The Vanguard... stands at the ready. But even we cannot hold the line should the Sunwell falter.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|The Light... we must trust in the Light. We must.}}
