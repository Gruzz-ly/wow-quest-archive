==Objectives==
Regroup in [[Windrunner Village]].
*Check in with [[Silvermoon]] (Optional)
*Regroup in [[Windrunner Village]]

==Description==
<Umbric scans the Eversong map with grave intent.>

[[Tranquillien]] was marked, as are a number of other locations. <Umbric stops, voice tightening.>

[[Windrunner Village]]. It's marked.

The [[Twilight's Blade]] retreated to their base in [[Deatholme]], but my home may be in peril. We must make sure my people in Windrunner Village are safe before pursuing them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,650[[XP]]

==Completion==
It seems all is well here... for now.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|This map of Eversong is marked with targets for the Twilight's Blade--including Windrunner Village!}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|I won't let that happen. Go, check on your people--I need to tell Silvermoon what's happened here. I'll catch up with you.}}

Speak with Arator,
{{dialogue|How thorough is the Twilight's Blade Infiltration in Eversong?

{{gossip|quest=|Let's check in with Silvermoon.}}
}}
:''The Arcane Projections of [[Lor'themar Theron]] and [[Turalyon]] appear''
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Arator! Has Umbric agreed to lend his aid?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|In due time. I have dire news--the Twilight's Blade infiltrated Tranquillien.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|What's worse is they had a map of Eversong, marked with targets--Tranquillien was only their first stop.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|Traitors on our doorstep. How can they betray their own people?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|They're afraid, father. You know the Void preys on fear.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The [[Remember the Sunwell|last time]] the Sunwell was threatened like this, the sin'dorei were nearly wiped out.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|Then this time, we'll ensure that cult is wiped out. See it done, Arator.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Not before we help Umbric secure Windrunner Village. We'll strike once everyone is safe.}}
:''Arator leaves as the Projections disappear.''

Head to Windrunner Village and meet up with Umbric and Arator.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|It's calm for now... but if the Twilight's Blade had a map of the area, it may not last.}}

Umbric has a gossip:
{{dialogue|I was so close. Kasiea... those notes of hers were trying to pull things from the Voidstorm. I thought I could reverse the pathway and send us in, but the pages simply aren't complete. There's too much missing.

I need those missing pages... and I am reasonably certain I know exactly who stole them.}}
