==Objectives==
Scour Umbric's ransacked lab for any salvageable research.
*[[Void Samples]] found
*[[Forgotten Pendant]] examined

==Description==
My notes, my research... I never should have left it alone.

I was just beginning to understand the Voidstorm! Everything I'd learned, torn from my hands by cultists... were they watching the entire time? Waiting for me to turn my back?

I cannot let this stop me. They can't have destroyed everything. Perhaps there's enough here to salvage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090[[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's get to the bottom of this.

==Completion==
The Twilight's Blade--Antenorian, what have you done!

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Even if I offered my aid to Silvermoon, I have little to give, now.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|All is not lost, Umbric--they can't have stolen everything.}}

Arator has a gossip,
{{dialogue|How thorough is the Twilight's Blade infiltration in Eversong?}}

Rummage through the [[Rumpled Papers]] and three of them have the Void Samples buried.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Excellent--wait, what's that glinting over there?}}

Examine the Pendant and a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Tranquillien Parlor Scene" starts playing,

:''Umbric recognizes the pendant a the seal of Tranquillien, belonging to the Governor. Lord Antenorian walks in.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|I was wondering where I'd left that.}}
:''Umbric and Arator turn to look at Lord Antenorian.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|This was your doing?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|What of the people here?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|You said you wanted them safe!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|And I do.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|Look at the sky, Magister.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|You know what resides there!}}
:''The sequence cuts to the shot of two civilians gazing at the Voidstorm. Followed by 3 Civilian Spies.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|You know the fear it brings.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|The uncertainty.}}
:''[[Master Chef Mouldier]] gazed at the Voidstorm as he was walking. The Civilian spies shed revealing to be the Twilight's Blade Recruits it causes the Civilians to be in fear and Mouldier dropped his tray of treats.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|And when it unleashes--and it WILL unleash...}}
:''The sequence then shows a couple civilians being chased by the recruits as the Banners appeared. Then it cuts to the Twilight's Blade caster summoning the Unfettered Shadows.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|The Twilight's Blade will stand on the side of survival.}}
:''It cuts to a wide shot showing the Twilight's Blade Casters, Cultist Casters, and the Twilight's Blade Recruits attacking Tranquillien.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|Won't you?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|I will not bend to you--}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|--or the Void!}}
:''Umbric blasts his magic at Antenorian as Arator begins charging but Antenorian deflects the blast and teleports away just before Arator gets a chance to cut him. Arator, Umbric, and the adventurer looks up as Antenorian's voice is heard as Penumbra also hides under the desk.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|Tranquillien will join us, or die.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lord Antenorian|And you with it.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, Arator has a new gossip,
{{dialogue|The Twilight's Blade. I did not expect them to worm their way into Eversong. I will not let them get away with this.

They will pay for what they've done.}}
