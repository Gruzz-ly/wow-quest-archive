==Description==
[[Magister Aradis|Aradis]] gave you his Wardbreaker? What an idiot. Those get sold on the black market as skeleton keys. Expensive, but you have to attune them to the [[magic]] you're breaking, which isn't easy.

Looks like yours is empty. We can fix that. If we pocket a few magic valuables around the city, my buddy upstairs can disenchant them and get that Wardbreaker juiced with [[fel]] magic.

Aradis won't have anywhere to hide then.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 14,700 [[XP]]
