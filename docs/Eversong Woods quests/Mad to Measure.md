==Description==
These... tourists! These uncultured, ungrateful slobs!

This [[Vanguard of Light]] has brought a lot of business to [[Silvermoon]], to be certain. But none of them actually appreciate what [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Thalassian]] craftsmanship means. They have no respect for the [[Blood elf|elven]] arts, they just want shiny, glittery souvenirs!

I am no springrunner dancing for their amusement... but I can hardly turn them away, can I? Perhaps an assistant would make this atrocious task easier.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

* 1,450 [[XP]]
