==Objectives==
Activate 6 Decrepit Ranger Constructs on the borders of Windrunner Village.
*[[Decrepit Ranger Construct]]s activated (6)

==Description==
I don't trust the quiet here. Let's shore up the defenses. Did you see those slumped over arcane golems around the village?

They may not look like much now, but a quick tune up will have them on their feet soon enough. They're good for standing guard, and also for ferreting out any hidden snakes in the weeds.

Let's get to work. The sooner the golems are running, the better I'll feel about this town's safety.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Twilight Spy's Pants]]
* [[Twilight Spy's Tights]]
* [[Twilight Spy's Breeches]]
* [[Twilight Spy's Legguards]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*13,090[[XP]]

==Completion==
The Twilight's Blade were already skulking around the perimeter... We were right to come here quickly.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We'll fix up those old constructs and take out any cultists we find.}}

Activate the [[Decrepit Ranger Construct]]s and they will slay the [[Twilight's Blade Spy]]

==Progression==
