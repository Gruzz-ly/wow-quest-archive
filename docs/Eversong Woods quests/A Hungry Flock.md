==Objectives==
Gather frog legs from the [[Gloombelly Toad]]s at [[Stillwhisper Pond]].
*[[Juicy Frog Leg]] (6)

==Description==
Some think that raising [[hawkstrider]]s is an easy task, but it most certainly is not. Hawkstrider appetites tend to be notoriously fussy!

More often than not they'll turn their beaks up at anything I offer. But this time of year? Frog legs. They love the slimy little things. They can't get enough of them!

There's a pond just down the hill just swarming with the leggy little morsels. Could you gather some for me, please?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found any frogs? The hawkstriders are hungry!

==Completion==
I've been told frog legs taste like a curious blend of fish and poultry. I... think I will leave that fine dining experience to the hawkstriders, however. Thank you for your help!

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[One Adventurous Hatchling]], '''A Hungry Flock''', & [[A Roost-ed Development]],
:{{Text|Say|Vaelith Sunplume|The pond lies to the south. Good luck out there, <class>.}}

Head to the [[Stillwhisper Pond]] and slay the Gloombelly Toad and loot the Juicy Frog Legs from them.

Return to [[Thuron's Livery]] and turn in three quests.
