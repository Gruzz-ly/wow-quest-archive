==Objectives==
Find out what Lor'themar is planning.
* Talk with [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]]

==Description==
Lor'themar has requested our presence. He wasn't exactly forthcoming with the details, but the location he chose speaks volumes.

[[Silvermoon Harbor]]. Quiet and out of sight. Not exactly the kind of place one picks for diplomacy or ceremony. No, this feels like something else entirely. Whatever he's planning, it won't be written down in any official record.

Come. Let's find out what the Regent Lord has to say.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This should be interesting.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|I'm guessing Lor'themar needs something done in secret. Never forget that the sun casts the deepest shadows.}}

Head to [[Silvermoon Harbor]] and meet up with Lor'themar and Valeera.

Valeera Sanguinar gets a gossip,
{{Dialogue|He doesn't say it, but this mission matters. More than most.

I'll move ahead and scout the site. We'll meet there.}}

Speak with the Regent-Lord,
{{Dialogue|The harbor's calm today. A rare gift.

{{Gossip|quest=|I'm here.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|Well isn't this discreet. So what's the mission, Regent Lord?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The [[Twilight's Blade]] had sensitive information. Not just about [[Tranquillien]], but all of Quel'Thalas.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Silvermoon is restless enough with the storm overhead. I won't give my people another reason to panic.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|If the Twilight's Blade has any other intelligence, I want it returned or destroyed. Recover what you can. Burn the rest.}}
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|My kind of mission.}}
:''Lor'themar Theron departs.''
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|I trust you will do what needs to be done.}}
:''After a few seconds Valeera Sanguinar departs.''
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|I'll scout the path. Don't delay--timing is everything.}}

Meet up with Valeera at [[Zeb'tela Ruins]].
:{{Text|Say|Valeera Sanguinar|This must be the heart of their spy network.}}
