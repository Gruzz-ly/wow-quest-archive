== Objectives ==
Tell {{NPC||Anduin Wrynn||Anduin}} that it is time to return home.
*Speak to Anduin {{co|65.9|79.3|Jade Forest}}

== Description ==
You have done all you can for the Prince's friends.

You completed your mission and found the White Pawn - Prince Anduin. {{NPC||Taylor||Admiral Taylor}} and the other [[SI:7]] agents will be eager to have the boy safe in their custody.

It is time to return home.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 111000 XP

== Progress ==
What?  You lost the boy?

== Completion ==
He did WHAT?!?!?

He's lucky that I haven't found him yet, because when I do, I just might kill him myself!

Whatever he thinks he's doing... chasing after [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|this Vale]]... it is not behavior fit for a prince!

If we didn't have more pressing matters at hand, I would send [[Alliance navy|our entire fleet]] chasing after his heels!

Speak with him:
* The [[pandaren]] are full of ancient knowledge.  [[Lina Whitepaw|Lina]] has been teaching me the medicinal uses of the local herbs.
* Where do you think the pandaren came from?  Why have they been hidden for so long?
* Someday, [[Ren Whitepaw|Ren]] is going to show me his family's village.
* I have never seen a place like this. Have you, <name>?
* I don't want to go home quite yet.  There's still so much to see and learn.
* How is [[Varian Wrynn|my father]]?  I hope he is not too worried.  He worries too much about me.
* My father doesn't think so, but I can take care of myself.
