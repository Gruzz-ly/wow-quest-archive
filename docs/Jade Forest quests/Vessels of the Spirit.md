== Objectives ==
Recover 8 Spirit Bottles from {{NPC||Shan'ze Spiritclaw}}s in the [[Terrace of Ten Thunders]].
*[[Spirit Bottle]] x8

== Description ==
The [[Spiritclaw]]s are a sect of [[mogu]] assassin-priests who, at the height of the [[mogu empire]], were the most elite and most feared of the emperor's troops.

All have mastered a deathblow which ensares the spirit of the enemy, trapping it in a jade bottle for delivery to a Spiritbinder.

If you encounter any Spiritclaws further ahead in the ruins, take note: their belts hang with a cursed weight.

Relieve them of their burden and bring the bottles back to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

== Progress ==
To think the mogu have continued training the Spiritclaws for all these years...

Did you get the bottles?

== Completion ==
Thank you, <class>.

I can already sense the spirits within these bottles - they cry out with fear, confusion... rage.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Ritual Artifacts]] and [[The Wayward Dead]] before heading out.

Kill mogu, use the staff on the spirits, and find the three items.

==Progression==
