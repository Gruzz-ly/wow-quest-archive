== Objectives ==
Befriend [[Lorewalker Cho]] by assisting him around his house: Trim his tree, paint his wall, and feed his birds.
*Trim the Tree
*Paint the Wall
*Feed the [[Exotic Pet Crane|Birds]]

==Description==
Stranger, I may be able to help you find [[Anduin Wrynn|your prince]]. But first, I would like to know a little more about you and your people.

Come, help me with my chores, and we will chat.

You have the look of a grizzled war veteran, but certainly you have a few minutes to help a bookish [[Pandaren]] like myself putter around [[Dreamer's Pavilion|the house]], yes?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|10}}
* 83000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is nothing like a little manual labor to bring strangers together, don't you think?

==Completion==
Despite your many years of combat, you've still got an eye for beauty, <name>. I like that about you!

Now, let's find this missing prince of yours.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Cho walks straight forward and down to the left.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Walk with me, and let us learn from one another. Are your people fond of gardening?}}
:{{text|emote|Lorewalker Cho hands you a pair of shears and motions toward a large, unkempt tree.}}

Interact with the [[Shapeless Tree]].
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|That's it, delicate cuts. Let the tree decide.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Some take their knives and lop away anything that displeases them, but this would kill the entire tree. That is not the Pandaren way.}}
:''The tree is trimmed into a spiraling topiary.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Well now! Who knew such a beautiful thing was hiding here? I can see that this "Alliance" of yours cuts with precision in order to change the world around you. Interesting.}}
:''Cho starts walking to the northeast toward the wall.''

Follow him as he talks:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I am a "[[Lorewalker]]" - a historian of sorts for my people. My instrument is the spoken word.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Sadly, my - ah - artistic talents are somewhat lacking. What would YOU do to decorate my wall here?}}
:''The Lorewalker stops in front of a painting of the [[wikipedia:yellow brick road|yellow brick road]] leading to the [[wikipedia:Emerald City|Emerald City]].''

[[File:A Visit with Lorewalker Cho - Cho's -Art-.jpg|thumb|Cho's "Art"]]
Interact with [[Cho's "Art"]]:
:The Lorewalker's art lacks both subtlety and technical expertise. Perhaps you can do better?
:''The player chooses a subject and starts painting.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Don't say a word. Allow your image to speak. We pandaren prize beauty, and we find it all around us:}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|In the curves of a tree, the colors of a sunrise, even in the perfect physical form of a warrior's exquisite swordwork.}}
*{{gossip|<Paint a Portrait of Prince Anduin.>}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Who is this? A prince, you say? A child. Ah, but he has had no childhood - you can see it in his eyes.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I can see your people expect great things, even from your young.}}
*{{gossip|<Paint something abstract.>}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|What have we here? Fields of red and blue, violently clashing in a green land.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|What could it mean? I can see a lot of turmoil in your heart, my new friend.}}
*{{gossip|<Paint something heroic.>}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I see - one of your [[Footman|great Alliance warriors]], is it? You have chosen a lion as your crest.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Your people are both stout and ferocious. But always remember, the lion kills only when hungry.}}

Follow Cho as he walks across to the south:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|My errands are almost complete. Come, visit my collection of [[crane|exotic birds]]. You may have the honor of feeding them.}}
:''He stops in front of a barrel of bird feed.''

Interact with the [[Bird Feed]]:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Here they come, yes, yes. You see how easy it is to make friends here?}}
:''A handful of [[Exotic Pet Crane]]s approach as the adventurer spreads feed.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Please remember that not all of your allies in Pandaria will be won over by sword point.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Well, my birds have taken a liking to you. I will follow their lead.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Welcome, my new Alliance friend! How can I be of service?}}

*{{gossip|<Paint something sexy.>}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Ah! Haha - I can see now what your Alliance fights for.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I prefer a little more meat on my birds, of course, but I can see that your people and mine are not so different after all.}}
