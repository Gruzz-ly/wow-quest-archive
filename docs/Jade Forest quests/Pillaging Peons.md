==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Twinspire Taskmaster]]s or [[Twinspire Peon]]s.
*Twinspire Peon slain (12)

==Description==
How did [[Paw'don Village|my village]] become a battlefield?

To the west, your [[Horde]] enemies cut down our precious orchard. Without our apple trees, we will have no harvest, no food, and no livelihood.

If you are truly different than this Horde, show us! Help us protect our grove by killing those who defile the land.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is easier to harbor hatred than to make peace.

==Completion==
Our orchard is one of our village's greatest treasures. For saving our harvest, we are truly grateful.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Critical Condition]] and [[Priorities! (Alliance)]] before heading out. Then get started killing Horde just to the southwest.

==Progression==
{{Paw'don Village}}
