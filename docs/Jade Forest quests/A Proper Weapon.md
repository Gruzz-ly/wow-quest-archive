== Description ==
First things first, though.

A proper trainee needs a proper weapon. And a scrupulous trainee builds his own... or at least gathers the materials.

The switches which grow nearby should suffice for any respectable weapon. You'll also need to shop for black walnut extract to treat the wood. While you're there, get some ale, for...

<Wu pauses.>

...well, you know what ale is for.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

== Progress ==
<Wu looks at you expectantly.>

== Completion ==
<Groundskeeper Wu gratefully scoops up the gathered materials.>

I will have a weapon prepared for you by the end of your training. Now, onto the real work.

== Notes ==
All of the items are in the immediate area. Six switches are behind {{NPC||Yao the Collector}} and can be stolen from his stock, or there are more freely all over the area.

Steal any from his stock:
:{{text|yell|Yao the Collector|Hey... HEY! What are you doing?}}
:{{text|yell|Yao the Collector|You're stealing my inventory, aren't you?}}
:{{text|yell|Yao the Collector|Don't make me stand up!}}
:{{text|yell|Yao the Collector|I'll do it, I swear! I'm about to stand up!}}
:{{text|yell|Yao the Collector|Here I go!}}
:{{text|say|Yao the Collector|Oh, who am I kidding? You are a wily one, thief.}}

The ale can is sold by {{NPC||Brewmaster Lei Kanglei}}, behind Yao, for {{cost||80}} each, and the walnut extract is sold for {{cost|1|20}} by {{NPC||June Whiteblossom}}, nearby.
