== Objectives ==
[[File:Wounded Pilot.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Wounded Pilot}}]]
Revive 6 Wounded Pilots in [[Paw'don Glade]]. You can also use healing spells or bandages to revive them.
*[[Wounded Pilot]] revived x6

== Description ==
We may have won the first battle, but a critical task still remains.

Dozens of [[Skyfire]] pilots were shot down during the initial aerial battle.

Without medical aid, their condition will deteriorate over time, until they finally perish. We are their only hope for survival.

Go into the orchard and revive as many pilots as you can find.

We will leave no one behind.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|
|Crashed Gyrocopter Rotor
|Greatsword of Kofinna Kottr
|Mishka's Bandage Cutter
|Peon-Chopping Axe
|Recovery Team Shield
|Skyguardian's Shield
}}

You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
We will remember all the brave [[Alliance]] [[soldier]]s who fell today. Though they can no longer continue, we carry the fight onward.

== Completion ==
Good work, <name>. Those soldiers will live and fight another day because of your actions.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Pillaging Peons]] and [[Priorities! (Alliance)]] before heading out.

While Mishka does not provide a healing item this time, simply clicking on the injured units will heal them.

Head southwest to the [[Paw'don Glade]] and get started killing, looting, and collecting.

Pilots start out as "Wounded", downgrade to "Terribly Wounded", then to "Critically Wounded" and finally "Mortally Wounded" as time passes. Move quickly!
