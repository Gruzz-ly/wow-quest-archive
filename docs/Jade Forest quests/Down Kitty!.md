Destroy 8 Jade Guardians

==Description==
I tried to fight one of the jade tigers in the woods but they were too scary. They stare at you and you turn to a jade statue!

Honest truth! Chen's sister's friend Ni heard it from Kai's mom.

I want to be brave like you though. Can you show me how to beat up those jade tigers?
