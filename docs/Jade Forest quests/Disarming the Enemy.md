==Objectives==
[[File:Slitherscale Harpoon rack.jpg|thumb|Slitherscale harpoon rack.]]
Collect 5 Slitherscale Harpoons.
*[[Slitherscale Harpoon]] (5)

==Description==
If we are to stop the poachers, we need to take more aggressive action.

If we can remove the enemies' primary tools for killing and capturing serpents, we may be able to stop their operation altogether.

I need you to go into their territory on the eastern end of [[Windward Isle]] and steal their weapons.

A cat without claws cannot strike.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
We have weakened them, but we cannot celebrate completely. A toothless tiger still has claws.

==Notes==
