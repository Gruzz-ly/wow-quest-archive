== Objectives ==
[[File:Gormali Raider.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Gormali Raider}}]]
[[File:Gormali Incinerator.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Gormali Incinerator}}]]
Kill 8 Gormali Raiders and 8 Gormali Incinerators in [[Nectarbreeze Orchard]].
*[[Gormali Raider]] slain (8)
*[[Gormali Incinerator]] slain (8)

== Description ==
The damn [[mogu]] hit us out of nowhere! Anyone they don't kill on sight is being dragged away into the woods.

This is the only safehouse, and it's all I can do to hold the door.

What do you say, friend? Are you willing to stand up and fight for the weak?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Don't worry - they won't get through me.

== Completion ==
Nice work, but there's more to be done if we are to save this village.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Rally the Survivors]], [[Spitfire]], and [[Orchard-Supplied Hardware]] before heading out. Raiders are in town, incinerators are further away. Tools are out on the ground in the trees.
