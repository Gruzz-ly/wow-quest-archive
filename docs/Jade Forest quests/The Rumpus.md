Set off the Monastery Fireworks in the [[Ring of Inner Focus]], then survive the Rumpus for two minutes.
*Survive the Melee
*[[Monastery Fireworks]] (provided)

== Description ==
{{NPC||Master Stone Fist}} has trained you in the art of one-on-one combat. Now you learn the art of one-on-many.

How does fifty sound?

Lower yourself into the Ring of Inner Focus below, then, when you're ready, set off this firework. My assistants will come at you, several at a time.

All you need to do is survive.

== Progress ==
Good luck, <name>.

Your <class> fighting style is strong, <name>. Our trainees could learn much from watching you.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Instructor Myang|Enter the Rumpus Pit, then set off the firework.  Be prepared to fight several enemies at once!  Anything can happen in the Rumpus.}}

On firing the rocket:
:{{text|yell|Instructor Myang|Now entering the arena: <Name>!}}
:{{text|yell|Instructor Myang|And now... let the Rumpus start!}}

{{NPC||Rumpus Combatant}}s have 20,833 health and hit for ~300 on cloth, while {{NPC||Rumpus Brute}}s have 158,000 health and hit for ~3000 on cloth. Mobs will come out in increasing speed, so start resorting to AoE tactics once the halfway mark has come and gone.

:{{text|yell|Instructor Myang|Halfway there, <name>.  Keep it up!}}
20 seconds to go:
:{{text|yell|Instructor Myang|You're nearly done, <name>!}}

Victory:
:{{text|yell|Instructor Myang|Congratulations to <name>, victor of the Rumpus!}}

It is ''not'' necessary to defeat all of the mobs&mdash;just remaining standing when time expires is enough. Feel free to kite the group as time winds down.
