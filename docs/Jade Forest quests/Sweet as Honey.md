==Objectives==
[[File:Honeykeeper.jpg|thumb|[[Honeykeeper]].]]
Collect 30 Honeycomb from Angry [[Honeykeeper]]s in [[Arboretum|The Arboretum]].
*[[Honeycomb]] (30)

==Description==
<The hatchling scampers about, then whines and whimpers.>

From the cloud serpent's behavior, you have a hunch that it wants a sweet treat.

The fragrant trees in The Arboretum are home to many honey hives.

It will be a simple matter to collect combs from the nearby honeykeepers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
<The hatchling spins around in glee as you return.>

==Completion==
The hatchling leaps for your hand. It winds its long, serpentine tail around you and begins to lick the honey from your fingers.

That tickles!

==Notes==
Head out into the woods and look up in the trees. Groups of 4-6 wasps are hovering about. AoE them down.
