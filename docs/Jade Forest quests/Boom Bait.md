==Objectives==
Use the Gut Bombs at [[Murky Bank]] and collect 5 Exploded Slickies.
* [[Exploded Slicky]] (5)
* [[Gut Bomb]] (provided)

==Description==
There. I've plastered your bird guts over my explosives.

I call 'em Gut Bombs, patent pending.

Since you made friends with these fellas, how about you do the honors?

Just light the fuse and throw 'em down by the shoreline!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 400 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Forest Hozen]]

==Progress==
I have yet to face a crisis that couldn't be fixed with dynamite.

==Completion==
We've just revolutionized how these cretins.. err, [[hozen]], feed themselves.

They'll never be the same!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Silly Wikket, Slickies are for Hozen]] from [[Eekle Eekle]] on your way out.

Go to the dock in [[Murky Bank]], use the bomb, and loot the quest item from [[]].
