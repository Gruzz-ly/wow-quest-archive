== Objectives ==
Free 5 [[hozen]] from the Engorged Crocolisks, and gather 5 Speckled Trout from [[Lake Kittitata]].
* [[Engorged Crocolisk]] slain (5)
* [[Speckled Trout (item)]] (5)

== Description ==
Now, back to your dilemma.

I believe you can help your people build relations with our hozen, as my people have.

The trail behind me will lead you to a body of water the hozen use to gather the fish that feeds them.

Around this time every year, fearsome beasts call those waters home and many hungry hozen are lost to them.

If you were to rescue some of the victims and gather some fish, perhaps you will be regarded more favorably.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Forest Hozen]]

== Progress ==
Wikket got slickies... for me!?

== Completion ==
Wikket save hozen? And bring slickies?

Hmm, maybe wikket not so bad.

Tooki Tooki never liked [[Dook Ookem]] anyway...

==Notes==
Killing the crocolisks free [[Expelled Hozen]].
