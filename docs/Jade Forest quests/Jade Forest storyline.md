# Jade Forest storyline

{{shortcut|jfquest}}
[[File:VZ-Jade Forest.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Jade Forest]] storyline''' covers all of the quests leading to and in the Jade Forest, starting the [[Mists of Pandaria campaign]]. Both factions start out in their capital cities of [[Stormwind]] and [[Orgrimmar]] before shipping out to [[Pandaria]]. An encounter with the opposite faction takes place and both factions crash land at opposite ends of the zone. After getting settled, adventurers push forward to [[Dawn's Blossom]] and start uncovering the mysteries of Pandaria.

The progression of the storyline in this zone is tracked in the achievement [[Upjade Complete]].

After discovering the secrets of the [[Temple of the Jade Serpent]] and the [[Serpent's Heart]], players are sent to the [[Valley of the Four Winds]]. Very early in the [[Valley of the Four Winds storyline|valley storyline]] (the third quest in!), players are given the opportunity to travel to [[Krasarang Wilds]] and complete the parallel [[Krasarang Wilds storyline|wilds storyline]] instead of questing through the valley.
