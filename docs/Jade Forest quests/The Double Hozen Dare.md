==Objectives==
Rescue 6 [[Scared Pandaren Cub|Scared Pandaren cubs]].
*Rescue Cubs (6)

==Description==
There is a witch in the woods but no one believes me. She turned my friend Shin into jade!

We were all so scared we tried to run back but she sicked her big jade monsters on us. A bunch of my friends tried to get away by climbing trees.

Can you help me save my friends?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where is Shin? I didn't see Shin.

==Completion==
Oh thank you so much for helping find my friends. I still don't see Shin though...

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Silkwood Road]] and [[The Threads that Stick]] before heading out. Exit town to the south and take the first right. Silk caches are near trees and spiders are everywhere. Keep heading west in the Silkwood to reach the [[Forest Heart]]. An Windfur will join the party and offer [[Down Kitty!]]. Kill tigers and talk to pandaren. Complete both her quests and pick up [[The Jade Witch]]. Kill the Jade Witch, then return to [[Dawn's Blossom]].

Spawn:
*{{text|say|An Windfur|I hope the Jade Witch didn't get all my friends.  She is super spooky.}}
*{{text|say|An Windfur|You are super brave.  Can you teach me to be as brave?}}
*{{text|say|An Windfur|I'm sticking with you.  You can be my bodyguard!}}

:Eep! Save me from the monsters!
:{{gossip|It's safe now. You can come down.}}

*{{text|say|Scared Pandaren Cub|It was An! She dared Shin to go knock on the Jade Witch's door.}}
*{{text|say|Scared Pandaren Cub|Oh thank you! Thank you! Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Scared Pandaren Cub|Next time I see a jade monster I'm gonna punch it in the naughty bits.}}
*{{text|say|Scared Pandaren Cub|I tried to boot a jade monster in the head but hurt my paw.}}
*{{text|say|Scared Pandaren Cub|Please don't tell my parents I was here.}}
*{{Text|say|Scared Pandaren Cub|I want my mommy.}}
*{{text|say|Scared Pandaren Cub|Thank you for saving me!}}

An may chime in on occasion after "saving" cubs:
*{{text|say|An Windfur|How did you get up that high?}}
*{{text|say|An Windfur|Make a run for Dawn's Blossom. We'll meet you there!}}

Or after killing mobs:
*{{text|say|An Windfur|How did you get to be so brave?}}
*{{text|say|An Windfur|I really hope it didn't eat any of my friends before you beat it up.}}

Or getting too close to the Jade Witch Hut:
:{{text|say|An Windfur|Eep! It's the Jade Witch! I need to hide!}}
