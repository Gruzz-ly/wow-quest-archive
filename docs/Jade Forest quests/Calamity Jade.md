Slay 12 Greenstone Nibblers and 6 Greenstone Gorgers at the [[Greenstone Quarry]].
*[[Greenstone Nibbler]] slain x12
*[[Greenstone Gorger]] slain x6

== Description ==
You ever seen a [[shale spider]], <class>? Usually harmless, just creepin' around eatin' rocks, but they got a taste for jade like cubs on candy. The boys call 'em "nibblers."

A few days back, we tunneled into a huge nest of these critters. They spilled out into the mines and went crazy, chewed up damn near everything in sight - including some of the boys.

You get in there and clear 'em out, and we got plenty of jade to spare. The quarry is directly west of here.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

== Progress ==
Never thought nibblers would be a big enough threat to choke up the whole mine.

== Completion ==
Well I'll be... you actually did it!

You lookin' for a more permanent job, buddy? I could use a bruiser like you around full-time!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Mann's Man]] before heading out. Exit to the south and head through the mason's quarter to reach the Greenstone Quarry. Head in:
:{{text|say|Greenstone Miner|Dang nibblers are tearin' the place down in there!}}
Further in is Hao Mann, trapped in some rocks:
:{{text|say|Hao Mann|Over here!}}
Turn in Mann's Man and pick up [[Trapped!]] while in the mine, then turn in and pick up [[What's Mined Is Yours]] for a scripted trip back to [[Emperor's Omen]].

On complete, the camera pulls back to show the second fresco complete!
