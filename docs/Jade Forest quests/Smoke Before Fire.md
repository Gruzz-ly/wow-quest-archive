==Description==
Sully scouted the Horde establishment to the north, and he reports seeing a large pile of explosives, along with a small force of demolishers. That's not to mention the demons that their warlocks have summoned.

Luckily, we came prepared. We've got air support from the Skyfire. We just need to show our pilots where to strike.

<Rell hands you a smoke flare, and gives you a knowing nod.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's that you've got, <lad/lass>?  Some kind o' flare?

Shoot, I coulda put together a better flare'n that in half a wink, if Rell had only asked.

==Completion==
Me lads up in the sky bring the heat, don't they? Ha ha ha!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fractured Forces]], [[Twinspire Keep (quest)]], and [[Unfair Trade]] before heading out.

Take the northwest exit out of [[Paw'don Village]], along the north side of [[Paw'don Glade]] to reach [[Twinspire Keep]]. Get started killing goblins, orcs and Forsaken. Also, kill the [[Eye of Ga'trul|Eyes of Ga'trul]] guarding the pandaren cubs. The four targets of interest are on the lower level, and the two named commanders are on the upper level, as well as Sully.

As you bomb the targets, the [[Strongarm Gyrocopter]]s says the following:

*{{text|say|Strongarm Gyrocopter|Carrier has arrived!}}
*{{text|say|Strongarm Gyrocopter|Burn it to the ground!}}
*{{text|say|Strongarm Gyrocopter|Target acquired. Light it up!}}
*{{text|say|Strongarm Gyrocopter|Roger that! Give them the business!}}
*{{text|say|Strongarm Gyrocopter|We read you! Coming in hot!}}

==Progression==
{{Paw'don Village}}

==Hunter Tip==
The smoke bombs act as a trap while using [[Camouflage]]
