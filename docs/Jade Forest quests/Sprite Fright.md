Kill 7 Shadowfae Tricksters.
*[[Shadowfae Trickster]] slain (7)

==Description==
Oh bother, how am I supposed to get my tasks done, now?

[[Instructor Skythorn]] asked me to go kill some tigers at [[Windward Isle]], but I heard the area was overrun with [[sprite]]s!

Ugh! I hate sprites! They totally give me the creeps!

They're so small, and... and... they jump on you and... and... they have cold, dead little stick hands!

Auuugh! You have to help me, <name>. Get rid of those things, please!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
So I don't like sprites. What's the big deal?

==Completion==
You have put the sprites in their place, <name>. They should cause no more trouble for a while.
