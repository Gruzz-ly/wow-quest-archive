==Objectives==
Leash and return 6 Windward Hatchlings to their nests.
*Windward Hatchlings returned x6
*[[Silken Rope]] (provided)

==Description==
Oh, thank goodness, another cloud serpent trainer!

I just received word that the wild hatchlings at [[Windward Isle]] to the northeast are in serious trouble!

While the adults fight those terrible [[saurok]], who is watching the cute little babies? No one, that's who!

WE HAVE TO SAVE THEM!

I'm sending every trainer I can find to go and help. If you aren't too busy, can you make sure the hatchlings are safely delivered back to their mothers' nests?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
How can you resist their cute little faces?

==Completion==
I see you have been taking good care of the young hatchlings out there. Well done.

This is a daily quest version of [[Empty Nests]].
