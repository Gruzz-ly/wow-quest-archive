Speak to {{NPC||Elder Lusshan}} and witness the waterspeaking ceremony.
*Speak to Elder Lusshan {{co|58.6|82.9|Jade Forest}}
*Witness the waterspeaking ceremony

== Description ==
Our war against the [[hozen]] rages without end, and the future of our tribe is uncertain.

This is why our waterspeaker has decided to seek wisdom from the waters.

Elder Lusshan is waiting. Please deliver the instruments so that they may begin.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 [[XP]]
* +5000 [[reputation]] with [[Pearlfin Jinyu]]

== Progress ==
<The Elder's eyes are glazed over. His vision is cast inward, toward the wisdom he has gained.>

== Completion ==
I saw the vision, <name>. What do you think it means?

I think it is clear that you play some part in it.

== Notes ==
Head south to the circular pool of water with the giant floating bubble in the center. Elder Lusshan is standing at its northern end.

:''A hozen and a jinyu are fighting.''
:{{text|bossemote|Everywhere I look, the rivers have dried.}}
:''The jinyu falls, defeated.''
:{{text|bossemote|But there is yet one path, one river, that may carry you through these difficult times.}}
:''A vision of the adventurer appears, walking forth to take the jinyu's place.''
:{{text|bossemote|Powerful strangers come from across the sea. Seek their strength. Add it to our own.}}
:''The adventurer defeats the hozen and plants an Alliance flag. Shortly thereafter, the vision fades.''
:{{text|say|Elder Lusshan|A great darkness? Could he mean that we must trust these strangers... these... Alliance... after all?}}

Return to Karasshi to turn in. As adventurers reach Karasshi, Rell and Sully limp back to the area—Rell has been severely wounded. Speak with him to continue.

This quest completes the "Waterspeaking Ceremony" requirement of [[Upjade Complete]].
