== Description ==
I heard, I heard! The High Elder wants you to train with us!

The oranges in the grove south of the temple are extra-sweet right now. Brimg some back, for the banquet.

Are you ready for the banquet? I can't wait.

== Completion ==
These will do perfectly. What a thoughtful gift, <name>!

Me? I'm bringing beer, of course.
