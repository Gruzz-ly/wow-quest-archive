==Objectives==
Listen to [[Kiryn]]'s report.
* Search the [[Serpent's Heart]] for signs of life

==Description==
MOST of what [[Riko]] said is true.

We didn't dare pursue [[Gorrok]] - the [[Horde]]'s numbers here are far too few. Our forces can only sustain so many losses, and frankly, we don't know how powerful [[Widow Greenpaw|that witch]] really is.

Let me pick up where the [[hozen]] left off...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[XP]]
*[[Money]]

==Progress==
If I may continue, please?

==Completion==
And that's how we found our [[Alliance]] [[Young Alliance Soldier|captive]].

But that's not all that happened. Not by a long shot...

==Notes==
:{{text|bossemote|We traveled south until night fell. Shokia spoke:}}
:{{text|say|Shokia|All right, Kiryn.}}
:{{text|say|Shokia|Riko.}}
:{{text|say|Shokia|We'll set up camp soon. First, we'll take advantage of this darkness to do some reconnaissance.}}
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|Good idea. I'll scout that area up ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Riko|And... and I will protect Kiryn from danger.}}
:{{text|say|Shokia|No, Riko. You stay here. Try not to get anyone killed this time.}}
:{{text|say|Riko|Aww, dooker...}}
:''Riko runs away.''
:{{text|say|Shokia|This way, Kiryn.}}
:{{text|say|Shokia|I'll cover you from here. It's dark, so you'll have to mark my targets for me.}}
:{{text|say|Shokia|Rendezvous back here when you're done.}}
:''Shokia goes up the hill.''
:{{text|bossemote|I found a stack of smoke bombs in my pockets. They'd have to do.}}
:{{text|bossemote|If I encountered enemies, I'd hit them with the smoke. Shokia's sniper rifle would take care of the rest.}}
Keep marking any [[Lurking Tiger|tigers]] as you work your way around the hill and toward the settlement.
:{{text|bossemote|I saw signs of a campfire up ahead, on the eastern side of the statue.}}
:''Kiryn finds [[Anduin Wrynn|a human]] at a nearby campfire.''
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|Don't move, human. I've got you cornered.}}
:{{text|say|Young Alliance Soldier|How, exactly, do you have me cornered, undead?}}
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|I've got backup. Watch this.}}
:''Kiryn marks a [[Harmless Raccoon|nearby animal]] with a smoke bomb, which is shortly killed by Shokia.''
:{{text|say|Young Alliance Soldier|I see.}}
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|You're lucky I don't kill you right now... you look delicious.}}
:{{text|bossemote|I returned back to camp with my quarry. Shokia would be pleased.}}
On completion:
:{{text|say|Riko|Riko time! I know what happened next! Pick me! Over here, <name>!}}

;In case you interrupt controlling Kiryn, speak with her again.
:{{Gossip|What happened next, Kiryn?}}
