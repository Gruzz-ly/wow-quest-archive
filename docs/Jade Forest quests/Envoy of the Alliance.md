== Objectives ==
Find and meet with the leader of [[Paw'don Village]].
*Leader of Paw'don Village found

== Description ==
North of this base is a cherry blossom orchard and a village tucked away behind it. We will need to quarter there and tend to our wounded while we plan our next move.

Head to that village and make contact with the native leader. Agent {{NPC||Mishka}} and {{NPC||Rell Nightwind||I}} will rendezvous with you there.

Be courteous, <name>! I am authorizing you to represent the entire [[Alliance]] here.

I'm banking that seeing a powerful Alliance hero like you should make a favorable impression.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*122,100 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
When the [[Mists of Pandaria (lore)|mist]] fell, we knew it would only be a matter of time before visitors arrived.

We could not have predicted it would be like this.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Cost of War]] before heading out. Once done killing sha, head north out of Garrosh'ar to [[Paw'don Village]].

Exiting Garrosh'ar, Sully has managed to get the goblin shredder working and is now riding in it:
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Good work in there, <name>! Get on to the village over the bridge. I'm covering extraction for the marines.}}
: {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Suck it down, freaks!!}}
: {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|I kinda like this thing.  What ye think, lads?  Can we keep it?}}
: {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|I even had time to install an [[Broken I.W.I.N. Button|I.W.I.N. Button]]!}}

On entering the village:
:{{Text|say|Paw'don Villager|Another stranger comes to our village... a <class> by the look of it. Enter, but do not draw your weapons against us as the Horde did.}}

Heard northeast into town to find {{NPC||Teng Applebloom}}, {{NPC||Sunke Khang}}, {{NPC||Taran Zhu}}, {{NPC||Wing Kyo}}, the flight master, and {{NPC||Matthew Owens}} channeling a portal to [[Stormwind]].
:{{text|say|Teng Applebloom|Mayor Khang, we must act quickly! Rally the city guards, at least!}}
:{{text|say|Sunke Khang|Just a moment, Teng. We have... a visitor.}}

On complete:
:{{text|yell|Mishka|Coming through!}}
:''Mishka with Lieutenants [[Lieutenant Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Lieutenant Stanton|Stanton]], each carrying an injured [[Skyfire Marine]], come charging in.''
:{{text|say|Mishka|There, by the fountain! Set them down gently now.}}
:{{text|say|Mishka|Stanton, keep some ice on that man's head. We need to get the swelling down.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Stanton|On it.}}
:{{text|say|Mishka|Daniel, that patient is in shock. Stay with him and monitor his heart rate, let me know if anything changes.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Daniel|Understood.}}
:''Stanton uses a frost spell to form ice around the head of her marine.''

*{{text|say|Mishka|These bandages are filthy.  Let's get you cleaned up.}}
*{{text|say|Lieutenant Daniel|His pulse is stable, Mishka.  But it's weak.}}
*{{text|say|Lieutenant Daniel|Hang in there, bud.  You're going to be okay.}}
*{{text|say|Lieutenant Daniel|Mishka's gonna take good care of you, you hear me?}}
*{{text|say|Lieutenant Daniel|The next ten orcs I kill are gonna be for you, friend.}}

Sunke Khang, Teng Applebloom, and Mishka all offer quests.
