==Objectives==
Kill 6 Tortured Spirits
*[[Tortured Spirit]] slain (6)

==Description==
The spirits... the cavedwellers... they howl in agony...

Trapped... in this world... cannot move... to the next.

I... will go mad... listening... to their cries...

Please...go...put them to rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 XP

==Progress==
The howls are lessening... already.

==Completion==
Thank you... friend. I am... happy... knowing... the spirits... are at peace.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sacred Waters]] and [[An Ancient Legend]] before heading out. Anduin joins the player after accepting Sacred Waters.

Head down the hill and enter the cave. The first water is immediately inside. Take a right and head further in. The second water is directly in the path up the ramp, but the third is off to the right. Up the last ramp is the {{NPC||Shade of Ling Heartfist}}, a level 85 shade with 316,000 health. Kill it. See The Vale of Eternal Blossoms for more information about the fight. The scroll is hanging on the wall to the left of the entrance and the final pool is in the back of the room. Collect both, then exit the cave via the right side (a shortcut to the front).
