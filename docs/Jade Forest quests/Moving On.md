== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Fei}} and travel to [[Valley of the Four Winds]].
*Traveled to Valley of the Four Winds

== Description ==
Your journey in this land has already proven most eventful, traveler. And mine, it appears, is destined to continue for a time.

A chain of events began when your people arrived here, and while some of those happenings are traumatic to behold, I feel there must be a larger purpose behind your presence.

For now it is wisest that you leave [[Serpent's Heart|this place]] and explore [[Pandaria|Pandaria's]] other regions.

Speak to me when you are ready to leave.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
* 83000 XP

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Fei.png}}
Be wise, traveler.

Prove to these inhabitants that there is more to your people than war and destruction.

== Notes ==

Speak with her again:
:It might be wisest if you and your companions were not seen here for a time, traveler.
:{{gossip|I am ready to leave.}}

Fei once again changes to her true form of {{npc||Yu'lon}}, and the player is placed just in front of her shoulder blades.  As she speaks, Yu'lon flies west from the heart through [[The Thunderwood]] and [[Forest Heart]] to exit [[The Jade Forest]] and reach the [[Valley of the Four Winds]]. 

: {{text|say|Yu'lon|We meet again, stranger from beyond the mists.}}
: ''Yu'lon rises up as she speaks to a higher altitude, before taking off.''
: {{text|say|Yu'lon|This battle has extracted a heavy toll.  My own rebirth will have to wait for several years.}}
: {{text|say|Yu'lon|Learn from this, stranger!}}
: {{text|say|Yu'lon|I do not know why the mists have opened.  But I know that it is for a reason.}}
: {{text|say|Yu'lon|It is clear that you are not here to bring your war to these lands.  There is a darkness hidden here in Pandaria - [[Sha of Doubt|this you have seen for yourself]]!}}
: {{text|say|Yu'lon|But I am certain that the mists parted for a reason.  YOU are that reason.  Find your purpose here.}}
: {{text|say|Yu'lon|You can learn a great deal about this land from the Valley of the Four Winds.}}
: {{text|say|Yu'lon|There is another visitor from beyond the mists here.  "Chen Stormstout" he is called.  He is Pandaren, but from [[Wandering Isle|a different homeland]].}}
: {{text|say|Yu'lon|Walk this land with Chen at your side.  Make friends among the people here.  You will find answers in time.}}
: {{text|say|Yu'lon|Farewell stranger.  When next we meet, I hope to call you friend.}}

The quest completes automatically upon being dropped off beside the [[Yan-Zhe River]]. 

This concludes the [[Jade Forest storyline]]. The player lands just downhill from {{NPC||Chen Stormstout}} and {{NPC||Li Li}}, who themselves have also just come from the Jade Forest. Chen starts [[Chen and Li Li]], which begins the [[Valley of the Four Winds storyline]].
