==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Windward Huntress.jpg|Windward Huntress|The huntress's den is in the northwestern part of [[Windward Isle]].}}
Kill the Windward Huntress.
*[[Windward Huntress]] slain {{co|64.5|25.8|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
I have learned that a vicious beast, a Windward Huntress, terrorizes the wood on the northwest side of the island.

She has already slain several serpents, and injured more than one serpent rider sent to subdue her.

She must be removed before she can pose a danger to anyone else. Can you perform this task?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+600 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
Wild creatures can be savage and cruel.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You are proving to be quite a reliable student.

==Notes==
The mouth of the Windward Huntress den is at {{co|64.5|25.8|Jade Forest}} just southeast of the [[Windward Saber]]'s area. Six [[Young Windward Tiger]]s, each with 59,091 health, are sleeping near the [[Windward Huntress]]. She has 787,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Crushing Pounce|range=5-45|Pounces on an enemy, inflicting Physical damage to all enemies within 6 yards.}}
