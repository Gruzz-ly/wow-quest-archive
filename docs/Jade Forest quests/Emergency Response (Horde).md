==Objectives==
Use Cho's Fireworks near General Nazgrim, Shademaster Kiryn, Shokia, and Rivett Clutchpop.
*[[Nazgrim|General Nazgrim]] Rescued
*[[Shademaster Kiryn]] Rescued
*[[Shokia]] Rescued
*[[Rivett Clutchpop]] Rescued
*[[Cho's Fireworks]] (provided)

==Description==
Your companions have made themselves at home in our land, and brought with them a dangerous conflict.

The full extent of their destruction here we cannot yet know. Already it is... unspeakable.

Nevertheless, to forsake your friends out of spite would be against our way. Any that yet live are doubtlessly wounded and in desperate need of care.

These fireworks were to celebrate the statue's completion. Use them near your companions to signal {{NPC||Mishi}}, and she will bear them off to safety.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

==Progress==
My thoughts will be with your companions, <name>.

May they be made whole again soon.

==Completion==
My thoughts will be with your fallen companions, traveler.

May their wounds mend well.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Residual Fallout]] and [[Jaded Heart]] before heading out.

Steer well clear of the elites unless ready to use [[Celestial Jade]] chunks to weaken them. Start killing the lesser [[Sha Echo]]es and looting jade chunks off the ground. Begin the fight with the elites by using the jade chunks on the [[Sha Remnant]]s to weaken them from elite sha with 1.8 million health to regular sha with 368,000 health.

Clear the immediate area near the battle survivors, get within a few yards, then use the Fireworks to summon Mishka.

Cho is still at the southeastern serpent shrine to complete all three quests.

On completion of all three quests, Fei appears next to Cho. Speak with her to continue.
