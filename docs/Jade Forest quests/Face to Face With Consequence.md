== Objectives ==
Kill 20 Sha Haunts and 7 Sha Harbingers.
* [[Sha Haunt]] slain (20)
* [[Sha Harbinger]] slain (7)

== Description ==
I do not know the history of this war that you fight, and I am not interested. This land responds to negative energy in kind. The hatreds, doubt, and violence you have brought here now ooze out of [[Pandaria]] like blood from an open wound.

Your actions have wrought havoc all over these ruins! Clean up after yourself and meet me in the village below - I will do my best to explain what is happening here.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

==Progress==
Have you cleansed the ruins?

== Completion ==
I am glad you took responsibility for your actions. Left unchecked, negative emotions can quickly overwhelm an individual here, just as they started to overwhelm the one you call "Nazgrim."
