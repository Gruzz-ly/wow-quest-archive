== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Lin Tenderpaw}} at the [[Tian Monastery]] in the [[Jade Forest]].

== Description ==
People come from all over Pandaria to train at the Tian Monastery, just to the north of here. Probably because they never turn anybody down. They'll accept [[jinyu]], [[hozen]]... or even a foreign <race> like you!

My childhood friend, Lin, just joined the monastery's order a few weeks ago. If you're interested in learning how our monks train, maybe you should go talk with her!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||94}}
* 6940 XP

== Completion ==
You've arrived at an exciting time. {{NPC||High Elder Cloudfall}} has agreed to take on a new class of trainees within the monastery. This could be my big chance to finally learn how to fight!

== Notes ==
This is an ''optional'' breadcrumb to the [[Tian Monastery]] from [[Dawn's Blossom]].
