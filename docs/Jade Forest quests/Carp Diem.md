Kill Chief Gukgut.
*[[Chief Gukgut]] slain {{co|54.6|80.0|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
Despite the [[hozen]]'s apparent disarray, there is an order to their chaos. Their leader, Chief Gukgut, is the shrewd mastermind behind their attacks.

He is organizing their movements at the great pit at the hozen camp to the northwest.

Strike now and show him no mercy, <name>, for he will do the same.

==Progress==
Is the chief dead?

==Completion==
Without their leader, these hozen should once again settle into disarray.

Today we rejoice in our victory!  <Name>, you came to us a stranger, but you depart as a friend.

From henceforth, you are the highest of the high - a valued friend and defender of the Pearlfin tribe.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Let Them Burn]] before heading out.

Head northwest up the ramp, past the fishrippers and start killing targeted mobs alongside the jinyu. At the pit where the tiger was at way back when is Chief Gugkut, an 85 elite hozen with 1.5 million health and the following abilities:
