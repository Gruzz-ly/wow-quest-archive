Report to [[General Nazgrim]] at [[Grookin Hill]].

==Description==
Oh, before I forget, I have something I was asked to deliver to you. A letter from one of your companions, I assume.

I was made to understand that your presence was urgently required, so I took the liberty of arranging your passage.

Speak to [[Ginsa Arroweye]] just south of here when you're ready. She has a kite waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
* 83000 XP

==Completion==
Throm-ka, <name>!

I hope you were able to gather useful information while on your journey through the forest.

Our preparations are almost complete, but your help is needed.

==Notes==
Head down the stairs, then take a left at the fork heading south. Before leaving the temple grounds, [[Ginsa Arroweye]], the flightmaster, can be found. Speak with her and take a ride over to Grookin.
