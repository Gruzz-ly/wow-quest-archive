==Objectives==
Speak to [[Shokia]], [[Sergeant Gorrok]], [[Shademaster Kiryn]], and [[Chief Kah Kah]].
* Shokia Dispatched
* Sergeant Gorrok Dispatched
* Shademaster Kiryn Dispatched
* Parlayed with Kah Kah

==Description==
I recognize all you've managed to do here, <class>. My report to the Warchief will include an account of your deeds.

But there's no time to rest!

This land must be charted and prepared for Horde settlement. I've already selected an away team to do just that.

Find them before they grow comfortable here. Inform them of their mission, and try to convince your new friends to send along one of their own to serve as a guide.

You'll be staying here with me. We have preparations to make.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|10}}

== Progress ==
Has the away team been dispatched, <name>?

== Completion ==
Good work <name>.

The away team you assembled has departed.

I hope Gorrok had the sense to change out of that ragged red shirt. I admire his patriotism, but he's had it on since we left Orgrimmar.

They won't be surprising anyone if he's wearing it...

==Notes==
Look around the camp and speak with Shokia, Gorrok, Kiryn, and Kah Kah:

{{Dialogue|title=Shokia|
Who would have thought these creatures could be reasoned with?

{{gossip|Nazgrim has assigned you to scout the region, Shokia. You are to depart shortly.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I'll make ready.

It will be good to get away from these savages for a time.
}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=Sergeant Gorrok|
This will take some getting used to.

I struggle to resist the urge to rip the heads from these creatures.

{{gossip|Nazgrim has assigned you to help scout the region, Gorrok. You are to depart shortly.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
A shame. I could use a bit of rest.

No matter. Tell Nazgrim that I will accompany the party.
}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=Shademaster Kiryn|
You know, these little guys aren't so bad once you get to know them...

{{gossip|Nazgrim has assigned you to the scouting party, Kiryn. You are to depart shortly.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Well of course he did. He'd be a fool not to.

Thank you, <race>. I'll prepare to depart at once.
}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=Chief Kah Kah|
Wikket smart to be friend to hozen.

Now, one less wikket hozen have to smash.

{{gossip|Big Chief Kah Kah, we will exploring your lands and could use a good guide. Will you help us?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Hmm.

<You wait patiently for Chief Kah Kah to think, then wait some more for him to speak.>

Kah Kah have many nephews. They all have earned their name here.

Grookin home to one who has not yet earned his name name....

[[Riko]] been a little too frisky - even for a hozen. Maybe long walk do him some good.
