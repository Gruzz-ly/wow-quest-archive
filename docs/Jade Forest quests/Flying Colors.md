==Objectives==
Report to [[High Elder Cloudfall]] at the [[Banquet Grounds]] in the [[Jade Forest]].

==Description==
;[[Groundskeeper Wu]] {{co|41.6|23.7|Jade Forest}}
:Well, I've done all that I can with you. Sounds like the others have, too.

:High Elder Cloudfall will be waiting at the banquet grounds, ready to celebrate your departure. Not that we're happy you're leaving... he just enjoys celebrations.

;[[Instructor Xann]] {{co|41.6|28.3|Jade Forest}}
:You have passed every test we prepared for you, <name>. It is now time for you to move on to bigger and better things.

:...but not before another banquet. The High Elder will be waiting for you at the banquet grounds to celebrate your graduation from our monastery.

;[[Instructor Myang]] {{co|39.0|24.0|Jade Forest}}
:The Rumpus was your final test. You have mastered the disciplines taught at this monastery.

:Just as your training began with a banquet, so shall it end. High Elder Cloudfall should be waiting at the banquet grounds. I'll be right behind you.
