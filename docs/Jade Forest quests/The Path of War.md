== Objectives ==
[[File:Slingtail Treeleaper.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Slingtail Treeleaper}}]]
[[File:Slingtail Mudseer.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Slingtail Mudseer}}]]
Kill 12 {{NPC||Slingtail Treeleaper}}s or {{NPC||Slingtail Mudseer}}s.
*Slingtail hozen slain x12

== Description ==
I see you want to save your friend. I can help you, if you will help me.

First of all, it should be obvious that the fewer the Slingtail roaming around, the easier it will be to escape.

Kill the [[hozen]] guards around us, and we will be one step closer to freedom.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]
*+2000 [[reputation]] with [[Pearlfin Jinyu]]

== Progress ==
You fight well, foreigner.

== Completion ==
Ahahaha! You are brave.

An admirable trait.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Freeing Our Brothers]] and [[Ancient Power (quest)]] before heading out. Go killing, freeing, and looting until all quotas are met.

==Progression==
{{Spirits of the Water}}

== Patch changes ==
