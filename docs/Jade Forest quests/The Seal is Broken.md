[[File:The Seal is Broken - shooting cannon.jpg|thumb|Sealing fissures on Mishi's back]]

Seal 12 Sha Fissures to banish the [[Sha of Doubt]].
*Sha Fissures Sealed (12)

==Description==
<[[Lorewalker Cho|Cho]] looks at you in disbelief.>

I... I thought [[Sha]] of this immensity were a myth - we all did.  Just a story to keep our children from fighting.

No time to talk now.  Those fissures - they're feeding it... it grows stronger by the moment!

I must research the scrolls from my family archives.  You, take this cannon and ride [[Mishi]].

You must find a way to contain this horror that has been unleashed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have much research to do in very little time.

The emperor's message only warned of the unique threat war would bring to our land - this... Sha.

Sadly, the time to heed his message has passed. And as for how to bring an end to the crisis, the [[Emperor's Omen]] is silent.

==Notes==
:If only I had figured out the fresco sooner.  So much could have been avoided, <name>.

Speak with Mishi, just to Cho's right:
:<Mishi looks expectantly at you.>
:{{gossip|Let's do this, Mishi!}}

Mishi flies circles around the ruins of [[Serpent's Heart]], granting players access to one ability:
*{{abilities|Shoot Cannon|range=200|Unleashes fire from ages past.|notes=Instant|cd=1 sec}}
Sha fissures are the large white circles on the ground with something streaming toward the Sha of Doubt. The cannon is a ground-targeted AoE, so trigger the cannon, then click on the white circle to seal a rift.

Once the twelth rift is sealed, a cutscene appears where the Sha of Doubt gets banished.

On the other side of the cutscene, the adventurer is standing next to Lorewalker Cho at the southeastern shrine, which somehow escaped destruction. The [[Sha of Doubt]] has been banished, but lesser sha now flood the area. Untold numbers of [[hozen]] and [[jinyu]] corpses litter the shrine as well.

:So much... lost.

:And I fear, <name>, that this is only the beginning.
