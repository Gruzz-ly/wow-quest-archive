== Objectives ==
Gather 10 Tidemist Caps from [[Tideview Thicket]].
*[[Tidemist Cap]] x10

== Description ==
I'm almost ready for the ritual - there's just one more thing we need: An offering.

Relax, I don't mean a sacrifice. Just a bit of food.

There are sure to be mushrooms growing in Tideview Thicket to the northwest that are suitable for this. Please bring some.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

== Progress ==
Even the dead know hunger.

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>. These mushrooms may not seem like much of an offering, but the sentiment alone will be enough to draw the spirits to us.

Also, they make a pretty fine stir-fry.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Back to Nature]] before heading out. Head to the northwest through the ruins to reach the thicket. Use the bottles and target the ground to release a spirit. Release one at a time in case the spirit beasts turn hostile. Then start looing around for mushrooms.

==Progression==
