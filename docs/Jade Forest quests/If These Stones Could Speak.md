== Objectives ==
Use the [[Stone Monolith]]s at the [[Circle of Bone (Jade Forest)|Circle of Bone]].
* First Stone Monolith Translated
* Second Stone Monolith Translated
* Third Stone Monolith Translated

== Description ==
This is a very ancient place, traveler.

Only recently have I pieced together a method of translating the forgotten language carved into these stones.

Oh, the thrill of discovery! This never gets old, I assure you.

Here, you are the guest. You do the honors. I insist.

Use this key to unlock the secrets the stones contain.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
Your assistance is most appreciated, traveler.

== Completion ==
That is enough translating for one day, I think.

This experience has been an enlightening one, I hope.

== Notes ==
First stone monolith:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|This stone tells of a great [[hozen]] warlord who lived here twenty-five hundred years ago. What are your leaders like? Poets? [[Warrior]]s? I should like to meet them someday.}}

Second stone monolith:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Prepare yourself! [[Saurok]] raiders approach!}}
:{{text|say|[[Bloodthirsty Saurok]]|Die, softskin!}}
:''A saurok appears, which should be easy to kill.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The saurok have plagued this land since the time of the [[mogu]]. They are impossible to negotiate with. But we never stop trying! We fight them only as a last resort.}}

Third stone monolith:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Thank you for your help - these notes are important to my studies. Your people value knowledge too, yes? I assume so, only because you arrived on a great airship.}}
