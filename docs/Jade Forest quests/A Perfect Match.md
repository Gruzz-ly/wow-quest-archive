==Objectives==
Speak to [[Pearlfin Aqualyte]]s and arm them with the proper equipment.
*Pearlfin Aqualytes equiped (9)

==Description==
[[Elder Lusshan]] and I agree that the best path forward will be to work together.

We will share with the Pearlfin our superior military knowledge and weaponry.

In return, they will be a powerful ally should we again encounter the Horde.

Take this crate of equipment and weapons. I need you to go around the village and equip the jinyu with weapons befitting their skills.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]
*+4000 [[reputation]] with [[Pearlfin Jinyu]]

==Progress==
The jinyu are skilled in different ways. It is up to us to find their strengths.

==Completion==
Good. Let those Horde mongerls show their faces now!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Seek Out the Lorewalker]] before heading out. The adepts have the gossip icon over their heads. They say various things describing themselves in terms of classes without using the class name.

;Rogue:
*Being small has its advantages. I can sneak just about anywhere.
*I'm quick and fast. Put me behind an enemy, and they won't even see me coming.
*Everyone here gets the standard warrior training, but I think I'm more suited to stealth missions.
*I never meet an enemy head on. I prefer to use my wits...and any number of stealthy tricks.
:{{gossip|Will these daggers help?}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|This is just what I needed.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|Yes! Now I am ready for battle.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|I should begin training immediately.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|These daggers are perfect for stabbing.}}

;Warrior
*I am a strong jinyu! I can take the brunt of many attacks without fear!
*While the enemies are focused on me, my allies can sneak up from behind!
*My sword is quick and my feet steady. Enemies must deal with me first before attacking my allies.
*My duty is to protect my people. If I must be on the frontlines, then I would gladly do so.
:{{gossip|You might need this shield.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|I should begin training immediately.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|This shield is just what I need! Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|This shield will block many might blows. Thank you, <name>.}}

;Mage
*I am terrible with a spear. I much prefer ranged combat.
*I have some skill in the magical arts, but I wish I had more formal training.
*I prefer to shape the properties of water, and unleash them against my enemies.
*I have had basic warrior training, but no one knows that I have more skill with spellcasting.
:{{gossip|This spellcaster's staff is for you.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|Yes! Now I am ready for battle.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|Yes! This weapon is perfect.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|Finally! An upgrade!}}

;Healer
*From a young age, I have been drawn to the healing arts.
*In your land, is it true that healers accompany warriors onto the battlefield? If only I had better tools, perhaps I could do the same.
*I bring bandages and food to the sick and injured. If only I could do more...
*There are too few who care for the wounded from battle. If I had the skill, I would certainly join them.
:{{gossip|Take this book of healing prayers.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|Yes! Now I am ready for battle.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|Such a sacred text will not be wasted on me. Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Auqalyte|So much knowledge! I must study this immediately.}}
*{{text|say|Pearlfin Aqualyte|I should begin training immediately.}}
