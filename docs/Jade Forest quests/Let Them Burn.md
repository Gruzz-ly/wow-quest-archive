Kill 15 [[Grookin Reinforcement]]s or [[Slingtail Recruit]]s.
*Grookin Reinforcement or Slingtail Recruit (15)

==Description==
Advance scouts report that the [[hozen]] at the [[Slingtail Pits]] are amassing with reinforcements from their tribes to the north.

Our forces are gathered for battle on the ridge to the northwest. They are just waiting for you.

Now is the time to show them what we are made of. Now is the time to destroy them indefinitely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Fishy]]
*{{cost|19|60}}
*138,000 [[XP]]
*+5000 [[reputation]] with [[Pearlfin Jinyu]]

==Progress==
Even if the hozen are organizing, we will defeat them with superior tactics.

==Completion==
The waters were right about you, <name>. Because of your efforts, this village has a future. We will not forget the lessons you've taught us, <class>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Pearlfin Watershaper|Lead us onward, <class>.}}
:{{text|say|Pearlfin Mystic|Ready for duty.}}
:{{text|say|Pearlfin Tidestriker|Let's get them, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Pearlfin Waveguard|It's now or never, <race>.}}
Pick up [[Carp Diem]] before heading out.

Your quest guardians will despawn if anywhere outside the village, Slingtail Pits or [[Pearl Lake]], so you can't keep this quest open and use them for other quests.  However, you could use them to quickly farm the turtles and crabs in the lake for some meat or leather.

Head northwest up the ramp, past the fishrippers and start killing targeted mobs alongside the jinyu. At the pit where the tiger was at way back when is Chief Gugkut, an 85 elite hozen with 1.5 million health.
