Destroy 10 Stonebound Destroyers in the [[Woods of the Lost]] and discover their source.
*[[Stonebound Destroyer]] slain (10)
*Source of the destroyers found {{co|49|20|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
<Living statues rampage through the woods.

For now, they seem content in pummeling the [[forest sprite]]s into splinters, but if they continue any further the pandaren will have more than just missing jade to worry about.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Each statue shatters with a blood-curtling wail as spirits burst free.

The statues are not mearly animate: they are posessed.>

==Notes==
If you have Quest Objectives set on your map, this quest will be noted on completion of [[I Have No Jade And I Must Scream]]. Adventurers can find the corpse of a [[Outcast Sprite]] in the [[Woods of the Lost]]. It offers this quest. Kill the destroyers—the live sprites will try to help. The source of the destroyers is the [[Terrace of Ten Thunders]]. Enter the area and the quest will complete automatically.
