==Objectives==
Destroy 10 Sha Echoes.
*[[Sha Echo]] slain (10)

==Description==
[[Pandaria]] is a mystical land, traveler.

It bears repeating that some of its secrets remain hidden, even to [[Lorewalkers]].

Sealing those fissures did not mend what has been broken.  If the legends are true, it will take much more to release this land from the grasp of the [[Sha]].

The aggression of that battle awakened a host of living negative emotions. What you see here is likely the first of many such manifestations.

For now, we can only try to diminish their presence here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This, it seems, is only the tip of the iceberg, <name>.

==Completion==
This is terrible...

We must find a way to undo what has been done here.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Jaded Heart]] and [[Emergency Response]] before heading out.

Steer well clear of the elites unless ready to use [[Celestial Jade]] chunks to weaken them. Start killing the lesser [[Sha Echo]]es and looting jade chunks off the ground. Begin the fight with the elites by using the jade chunks on the [[Sha Remnant]]s to weaken them from elite sha with 1.8 million health to regular sha with 368,000 health.

Clear the immediate area near the battle survivors, get within a few yards, then use the Fireworks to summon Mishka.

Cho is still at the southeastern serpent shrine to complete all three quests.
