== Objectives ==
[[File:Splintered Path.jpg|thumb|[[Splintered Path]]]]
[[File:Camp Gormal.jpg|thumb|[[Camp Gormal]]]]
Follow the [[Splintered Path|path of fallen trees]] from the northwest corner of [[Nectarbreeze Orchard]] and find the [[mogu]] raiders camp.
*[[Camp Gormal|Mogu Camp]] Discovered

== Description ==
First... before the war-cries... we heard the trees.

Groaning, creaking, and finally crashing down as the mogu cut their way through the woods. They were making the return trip easier...

They're dragging our friends back down that path, to the ruins west of the village! Those ruins have been empty for years - our children play there.

Why would the mogu come back to them now?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
This doesn't look like a quick snatch and run. They're setting up for something big.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shao the Defiant|I heard everything, <name>. Go ahead to the camp and I'll meet you there.}}
Just to the north of the house, the trees have fallen outward. Follow the path to the northwest. {{NPC||Gormali Stalker}}s may jump wandering adventurers:
:{{text|bossemote|Mogu ambushers descend from the trees. Look out!}}
:{{text|say|Gormali Stalker|Look at what we have here! Another straggler from the orchard...}}
Take a left when the path forks to reach [[Camp Gormal]]. Shao is hiding behind a tree to the left of the path.
:{{text|say|Shao the Defiant|Over here, <name>!}}
