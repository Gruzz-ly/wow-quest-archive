== Objectives ==
[[File:High Elder Cloudfall.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||High Elder Cloudfall}}]]
Speak with {{NPC||High Elder Cloudfall}} at the [[Tian Monastery]] in the [[Jade Forest]].

== Description ==
How strange, to have such a foreign-looking <class> visiting our temple. Are you here to study?

You... you look very strong. You wouldn't have any trouble getting accepted into the monastery. You should talk to the High Elder, up on the balcony above.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||98}}
* 11000 XP

== Completion ==
Welcome to Tian Monastery. I see young {{NPC||Lin Tenderpaw||Lin}} has helped you understand the role we fill here in our hilltop village.

We are unaccustomed to outsiders. You would do us a great favor to train alongside our younglings. We do not have anything to offer you, <class>... except knowledge, and perhaps an appreciation of what it means to be pandaren.

== Notes ==
On complete:
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|If you are interested in training with us, speak with me again at the banquet tables, later this evening.}}

Lin offers the next quest.
