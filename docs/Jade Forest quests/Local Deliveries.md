I just harvested my latest batch today. Will you help me deliver them?

==Progress==
Have you met my neighbors yet? Don't be shy about introductions. Everyone is pleased to meet outsiders that respect our traditions and way of life.

==Completion==
Wonderful! By the way--if you like the flowers, I would love to give you a bunch from my next harvest.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|You certainly took your time to pay me a visit.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|My duties as [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]] have gotten more... time-consuming as of late. I'm sorry, Kiry. I should've come sooner.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|So, this is where you've chosen to settle?}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|Yes. I have a daily routine. I know all the villagers. I even have my own house.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|A house?! I--I see.}}

;Speaking with Yol
:{{Gossip|These flowers are from Kirygosa.}}
::These are prettier than I could've imagined! Look at the sheen of their velvety petals--as if they shimmer with [[magic]]. Kirygosa's blue magic beautifies our village.

::For these, I had been looking for a new garnish for my noodle dishes. I think I will keep a few in a vase at home as well...

;Speaking with Kai Wanderbrew
:{{Gossip|These flowers are from Kirygosa.}}
::Ah! I have been expecting these. This batch of flowers matured well.

::Look at that blue... now that's a color of brew that [[pandaren]] from all ends of the land will be talking about.

;Speaking with Ni Gentlepaw
:{{Gossip|These flowers are from Kirygosa.}}
::Speaking of fine notes, Kirygosa's flowers over yonder are a boon to my craft. When crushed with other ingredients, they increase the potency of the final potion.

::Not to mention how pretty they are!

;Speaking with Old Man Misteye
:{{Gossip|These flowers are from Kirygosa.}}
::Kirygosa? Is that you?

::Oh, you are her friend! She said she was going to visit me today... did you bring flowers?

::<Old Man Misteye holds the flowers close and inhales deeply. Pure contentment washes over his face.>

::I can't see much anymore, so I try to indulge my remaining senses as best I can. And Kirygosa has cultivated something very special.

::Welcome to our humble home, friend.
