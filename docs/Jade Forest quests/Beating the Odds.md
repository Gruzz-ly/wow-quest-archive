==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Slitherscale Ripper]]s or [[Slitherscale Eggdrinker]]s.
*Slitherscale saurok (8)

==Description==
At first, the Slitherscale were too frightened to approach the [[cloud serpent|wild serpents]].

Then, I caught them snatching the eggs under the cover of night.

Now, they are slaughtering adults and hatchlings alike!

If we do not do something, these gentle creatures will be completely wiped out. Then there won't even be an [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]] to join!

Go and slay these vile Slitherscales, and then we will talk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
The Order rarely meddles with the natural balance on this island, but it is too important to save the serpents.

==Completion==
Thank you, <race>.

I tried to stop the Slitherscale where I could, but I was no match for their numbers.

Your work today will help preserve an entire generation of cloud serpents.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Empty Nests]] and [[Egg Collection]] before heading out.

Head north away from Tong and circle clockwise to the northwest around the high bluff to reach the saurok camp, killing saurok and leashing cloud serpent hatchlings along the way. Once [[Slitherscale Ripper]]s are found, the eggs will also be nearby.
