==Objectives==
Find 4 Playful Serpents.
*[[Playful Azure Serpent]] found {{co|59.2|56.8|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
Have you seen the young serpents in the training yard?

The little ones tend to be mischievous, and some of them ran off to play before the training session.

[[Liu Flameheart|The Mistress]] will get angry if she discovers they're missing.

Would you go find them and bring them back to me? I don't want them to get into trouble.

They like to play out in the open, so look for them in courtyards and around the spires.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope they didn't give you too much trouble.

==Completion==
You found them and brought them all back!

They've really taken a liking to you.

Thank you so much!

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Scryer's Dilemma]], [[The Librarian's Quandary]], and [[Lighting Up the Sky]] before heading out. The dragons are all over the area, in open parts of the temple.  If you emote <code>/pet</code>, <code>/love</code> or <code>/hug</code> to any of your playful serpents, they will respond with a heart.

The Playful Azure Serpent is at the northeast corner of the temple proper, at the east end of the [[Fountain of the Everseeing]].
