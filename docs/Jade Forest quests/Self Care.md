==Objectives==
Tidy [[Kirygosa]]'s home.
*Kirygosa's home cleaned (5)

==Description==
How strange and wonderful it is to be in Kiry's own home.

That being said, I can't help but notice it is an absolute mess in here. She spends all this time helping with the villagers, I have a feeling that she doesn't reserve time for herself. Typical Kiry... <Kalecgos sighs.>

Would you mind tidying this place up a bit, <name>? I'm sure she'd be glad for the help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

<Kalecgos is paying deep attention to Kirygosa.>

==Completion==
Oh--did you finish? Thank you very much. I can tell Kiry appreciates you.
