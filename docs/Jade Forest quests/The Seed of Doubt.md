==Objectives==
Kill the Seed of Doubt.
*[[Seed of Doubt]] slain

==Description==
The problem with the [[Sha of Doubt|sha of doubt]], <race>, is its deceitful pervasiveness.

Once the seed of doubt is planted, it can grow like an unwelcome weed.

Such a seed has been planted in [[Widow's Wail|The Widow's Wail]] to the north, and like a weed, we must extinguish its presence immediately.

I need you to destroy the lingering fragment of doubt before it can infect any more victims.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+600 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
Doubt is a difficult enemy to vanquish because in a sense, we are fighting ourselves.  Stand tall and be confident in you own actions, <name>.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. I "doubt" that this enemy is truly gone. Until we can be sure, we must stay vigilant.

==Notes==
Make sure to pick up [[Lingering Doubt (quest)]] and [[Weeping Widows]] before you leave.
