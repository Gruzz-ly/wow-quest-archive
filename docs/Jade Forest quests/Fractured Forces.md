== Objectives ==
Slay Dalgan and Bellandra Felstorm.
*[[Dalgan]] slain {{co|41.2|80.2|Jade Forest}}
*[[Bellandra Felstorm]] slain {{co|41.8|80.1|Jade Forest}}

== Description ==
The [[Horde]] have made our jobs easier for us. Their infighting and segregation have split their camp in two: [[orc]]s in the west, and [[undead]] in the east.

The orcs obey their commander Dalgan, while the undead follow Bellandra Felstorm, a powerful [[warlock]]. Hopefully, their internal squabbles will be enough of a distraction that you'll be able to sneak in there and kill both of them. [[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Sully]] has already infiltrated the ruins; find him inside when you are done.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Pretty scary-lookin' characters around here...

== Completion ==
That's some fine and fancy killin', <class>.

Now, with those two all done 'n' taken care of, all that's left is the big fella in the hall behind me.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Smoke Before Fire]], [[Twinspire Keep (quest)]], and [[Unfair Trade]] before heading out.

Take the northwest exit out of [[Paw'don Village]], along the north side of [[Paw'don Glade]] to reach [[Twinspire Keep]]. Get started killing [[goblin]]s, orcs, and [[Forsaken]]. Also, kill the [[Eye of Ga'trul|Eyes of Ga'trul]] guarding the pandaren cubs. The four targets of interest are on the lower level, and the two named commanders are on the upper level.

As is Sully.
