==Objectives==
Collect 5 Tiny Bags of Poop.
*[[Tiny Bag of Poop]] (5)

==Description==
<Your serpent catches your gaze and ducks its head bashfully.>

You can tell that someone has gotten out of its pen and had "an accident."

Well, at the rate that the hatchling's been eating, it had to come out the other end... somewhere.

You had better find the serpent's poop and clean it up before the Serpent Masters find out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*12,190 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
<The hatchling watches you innocently.>

==Completion==
The hatchling plays contentedly, oblivious to your efforts. Sigh... sometimes, the life of a serpent trainer is quite thankless.

==Notes==
The poop piles are guarded by [[Siftworm]]s.

==Progression==
