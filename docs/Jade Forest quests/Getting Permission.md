*[[Pandriarch Windfur]] defeated {{co|52.5|35.6|Jade Forest}}

*[[Pandriarch Goldendraft]] defeated {{co|53.6|36.7|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
My love, Lo, tried to get permission to marry me from the pandriarchs. Though they have passed beyond, their favor would carry a lot of weight.

Thing is, they are spirits, and none of the gifts or tributes we brought impress them. To win their favor they claimed that either Lo or a champion must defeat them in single combat.

Lo is a good man, but not a fighter.

Would you be our champion?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Depending on your class and specialization you will get one of the following items:|Zen Lotus Pendant|Vale Song Pendant|Dawnblossom Necklace|Greenstone Pendant|Jade Eye Pendant}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Each of the pandriarchs earned their reputation in life and retained them afterward.  I can't even imagine how you will defeat them.

==Completion==
They... they agreed?!  Fantastic!  Thank you so much!  With their blessing we can be the happiest pandaren in all the land!

Please, take this.  We meant it to be a tribute for the pandriarchs but they didn't seem interested.

==Notes==
Closest is Pandriarch Goldendraft:
:I watch as my lineage is reduced to a faded memory around me. Once the greatest of all brewmasters we now stand backstage to the Stormstouts. Bah!
{{gossip|Challenge the Pandriarch.}}
:{{text|say|Pandriarch Goldendraft|A Wanderbrew wants to marry an{{sic}} Goldendraft?! Preposterous.}}
:{{text|say|Pandriarch Goldendraft|I yield! The boy chose his champion well. Give him my blessing and make sure he does not squander it.}}

Windfur is up next:
: In life I had many cubs, and many grand cubs.  But none of my great grand cubs visit anymore.  Few remember with honor the great Windfur family lineage.
;[[The Jade Witch]] done
:I hear you are responsible for saving [[An Windfur|one of my youngest descendants]] from the clutches of [[Widow Greenpaw|the Jade Witch]]. I thank you for your heroism.
{{gossip|Challenge the Pandriarch.}}
:{{text|say|Pandriarch Windfur|You would champion the cause of such a lowly street rat? Very well, best me in combat and I shall consider giving you my blessing.}}
:{{text|say|Pandriarch Windfur|Enough! You win... champion. Tell that upstart that he has my blessing.}}

Bramblestaff is down to the south:
:Strength! That is the lifeblood of the Bramblestaff family. My lineage lives today as a testament of physical greatness willing to take on any challenger.
{{gossip|Challenge the Pandriarch.}}
:{{text|yell|Pandriarch Bramblestaff|At last! A challenge! Let us test your mettle, "champion".}}
:{{text|yell|Pandriarch Bramblestaff|That was a fine battle! The likes of which I have not enjoyed in many decades. Go and give the boy my blessing.}}

On complete:
:''Toya, Peiji Goldendraft, and Kai Wanderbrew walk up.''
:{{text|say|Toya|Here they are. See, told you I could find anyone or anything.}}
:{{text|say|Lo Wanderbrew|Mister Goldendraft, I humbly ask permission to marry your daughter Syra.}}
:{{text|say|Peiji Goldendraft|What?! This is preposterous.}}
:{{text|say|Kai Wanderbrew|Son! What are you doing! She's a Goldendraft.}}
:{{text|say|Lo Wanderbrew|It is not her name I am interested in. It is her. She is the kinest, nicest, prettiest person I have ever met.}}
:{{text|say|Peiji Goldendraft|My Syra will NOT be seen with the likes of a Wanderbrew.}}
:{{text|say|Syra Goldendraft|No, father, I will. Lo was willing to fight the Pandriarchs for me. It took <name> to champion us but they consented.}}
:{{text|yell|Peiji Goldendraft|They agreed?!}}
:{{text|yell|Kai Wanderbrew|They agreed?!}}
:{{text|say|Lo Wanderbrew|Yes. And now, with your permission, I would like to ask for your daughter's hand.}}
:{{text|say|Peiji Goldendraft|Well... um... I...}}
:{{text|say|Kai Wanderberw|Come on Peiji. I don't like it any better than you do but there is honor in the Pandriarchs' blessings.}}
:{{text|say|Peiji Goldendraft|Fine. What's done is done. But don't assume I will ever like this. Or you, Kai.}}
:{{text|say|Kai Wanderbrew|Same. Now lets get these kids back to Dawn's Blossom.}}
:{{text|say|Toya|Wow! That was amazing. What next, <name>? Think you can get the [[hozen]] and [[jinyu]] to get along?}}

This completes this little branch. Either head north to the [[Emperor's Omen]] or back south to [[Dawn's Blossom]] and take the ride from Toya to get to Cho's location.

This also concludes the [[Dawn's Blossom]] portion of [[Upjade Complete]].
