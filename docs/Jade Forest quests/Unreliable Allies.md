== Objectives ==
Encourage 12 Pandaren Volunteers to leave the [[Strongarm Airstrip]].
* [[Pandaren Volunteer|Indentured Pandaren]] freed (12)

== Description ==
We originally welcomed the Alliance as friends. Several of our villagers volunteered to help them build an airstrip. Only recently, however, did it become clear to us that they were building a war base, within shouting distance of our village.

What's worse - I fear that some villagers are being held against their will. If you find them, <class>, let them know that it is time to come home.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
No... thankfully, my children did not volunteer. I only have one daughter, [[Lin Tenderpaw|Lin]] who left home to train at the [[Tian Monastery]], several weeks ago.

== Completion ==
Although I can't understand why you chose to bring your war to our land, I can clearly see which side is more virtuous.

Thank you for your raid, <race>.

*These working conditions are horrible! We haven't had a beer break in HOURS!
*Are you here to give me my break? It feels like I've been working forever!
*<She/He wipes the sweat from <her/his> brow.>

:Hello there, <class>. You here to help?
*Wow... These Alliance sure do have us working hard...
*So... thirsty...
*I thought we were just building houses, not a fortress.
*I've never worked this hard before in my life! I don't like it!
*Why do these guys have so many weapons?
