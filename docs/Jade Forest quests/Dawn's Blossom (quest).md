==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lorewalker Cho]] in [[Dawn's Blossom]].

Speak to the flightmaster in [[Grookin Hill]] for passage.
* [[Pandaren Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
Blood and Thunder! My axe hungers!

We won't return to [[Orgrimmar]] until every last [[Alliance]] is purged from this land.

I will train [[Hozen|these natives]] myself, if I have to. One way or another, this land will be made ready for [[Horde]] settlement.

In the meantime, [[Chief Kah Kah|their chief]] gave me this to pass on to you - a map and a message in some fancy script.

Do what you must, but be quick about it.

War is brewing...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Completion ==
Greetings, <name>!

Welcome to Dawn's Blossom, a home of [[Pandaren|my people]].

Sadly I must depart. Alas, a Lorewalker's work is never done.

Make yourself at home. Our people could surely make use of one with your talents.

== Notes ==
Talk to the [[Grookin Flapmaster]] just west of where you are.
:Need a flapper?
:{{gossip|Send me to Dawn's Blossom.}}

Pick up the flight path from {{NPC||Keg Runner Lee}}! Several {{NPC||Curious Cub}}s will attach themselves to the adventurer when reaching Cho:
