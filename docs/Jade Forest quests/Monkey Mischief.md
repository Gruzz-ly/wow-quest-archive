==Objectives==
Kill 13 Oona hozen.
*Oona Hozen slain (13)

==Description==
Strange tales have reached our ears from [[Sri-La Village]].

It seems that a [[hozen]] tribe has made itself comfortable in [[Oona Kagu]], a cave along the coast south of the fishing village.

Too comfortable, in fact.  The tribe members are stealing and pillaging resources all along the coast.

We must teach them a lesson... one that can only be taught by force.  They have already overstayed their welcome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
We serve the people of [[The Jade Forest]].  We will ensure their protection and well-being.

==Completion==
The hozen presence is quite troubling.  You did well to follow Instructor Skythorn's instructions.
