== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Subjugator Gormal.jpg|Subjugator Gormal|He would see every last pandaren in chains if he is not stopped.}}
Kill Subjugator Gormal in [[Camp Gormal]].
*[[Subjugator Gormal]] slain {{co|37.8|76.1|Jade Forest}}

== Description ==
Thanks to you, there's a small militia of farmers nearby. {{NPC||Gentle Mother Hanae||Hanae}} said something about giving them "liquid courage" which, I'm pretty sure, means they're sauced and ANGRY.

The [[mogu]] think the can walk over us - we'll give them a fight that will open their eyes.

Follow the trail through the ruins and down to the beach. Find their leader. WHen you engage him, we'll be there to back you up.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|Depending on your class and specialization you will get one of the following items:
|Silkbead Idol
|Mirror Strider Emblem
|Greenpaw Idol
|Shoots of Life
|Misty Jade Idol}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
We are ready to fight the mogu leader whenever you are.

== Completion ==
This is extremely unsettling. If mogu are banding together like this all over the continent, it could become a major threat to Pandaria.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Unbound (Jade Forest)]] before heading out. Head in to the town and either free netted farmers or kill the slavers dragging farmers around. Down the path at the beach is Subjugator Gormal, a level 85 mogu with 1,106,000 health. He has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic melee|~5500 Physical}}
*{{abilities|Subjgate|range=10|Unleashes dark energy, knocking all enemies away and inflicting Shadow damage.|notes=2.5 sec cast}}
One member of the militia will taunt Gormal off the adventurer, greatly increasing the damage Gormal takes.

:{{text|say|Shao the Defiant|Now, friends.  Attack!}}
:{{text|say|Nectarbreeze Militia|You've underestimated us!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Gormal takes additional damage while taunted by a farmer!}}

Subjgate:
:{{text|yell|Subjugator Gormal|You're nothing but backwater peasants with sticks!  Get back in line!}}

Gormal killed:
:{{text|say|Shao the Defiant|It is done, but we should not linger here.  Meet me back on the eastern edge of the camp.}}

Kill him then head back to the tree where Shao was at earlier.

Finishing this quest will complete the Nectarbreeze Orchard portion of [[Upjade Complete]].
