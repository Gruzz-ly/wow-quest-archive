==Objectives==
Use the Sha Attunement Device at the Sha Disturbances in [[Widow's Wail|The Widow's Wail]]. The entrance to The Widow's Wail can be found to the north along the coast, south of [[Sri-La Village]].
*Northwestern Sha Disturbance measured
*Northeastern Sha Disturbance measured
*Southern Sha Disturbance measured
*[[Sha Attunement Device]] (provided)

==Description==
I heard that there has been some strange behavior down at The Widow's Wail to the north.

[[Hyacinth]] and I went to investigate, and I am certain that some presence of the sha has found its way into the cavern.

I created this device to measure sha energy levels.

If you are going that way, would you mind taking measurements of any sha disturbances?

The disturbances look like streams of white and black sha energy pouring from the ground.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
* 236000 XP
* +450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
If we can measure the sha energies, we can tell if it is getting any better or worse.

==Completion==
Thank you for bringing me this report, <name>.  Big Bao is quite right to be concerned.

The sha is a subtle and deadly enemy.  We must work to expel their dark energy from this land.

==Notes==
Make sure to pick up [[The Seed of Doubt]] and [[Weeping Widows]] before you leave.
