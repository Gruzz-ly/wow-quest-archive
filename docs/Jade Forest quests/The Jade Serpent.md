==Notes==
[[File:Yu'lon.jpg|thumb|[[Yu'lon]].]]
On accept, a cutscene. The massive doors of the temple open and Fei walks in to [[The Heart of Jade]] as the adventurer follows. She stops in the center circle of the rug, turns around and laughs.  Suddenly, she reveals herself as [[Yu'lon]]!  She speaks with a warm, kindly feminine voice.

:{{text|say|Yu'lon|I apologize for the deception, but it was necessary.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|In thousands of years, we have never seen one of your kind.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|It was imperative that I first measure the bearing of your heart.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|Come ride with me, little one. There is something I wish you to see.}}
:''Yu'lon bends her head downward and the adventurer jumps up just behind her head.  Yu'lon exits the rear of the temple and flies around and above the front courtyards, exiting cutscene mode.''
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|The [[Yu'lon Priest|Temple Priests]] are too frightened to face the truth...}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|I grow old, little one. My time on this world is nearly done.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|Do you see the [[Serpent's Heart|great statue]] in the distance?}}
:''Yu'lon heads to the statue and begins to fly a clockwise direction around the land the statue sits on.''
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|The builders have toiled for many years, and it is nearly complete.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|A little more jade - the jade you helped to acquire - and it will be finished.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|With my last breath, I will transfer my life essence into the statue, and a new guardian will be born.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|Do not be saddened. The cycle is clear - it neither begins nor ends with me.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|Someday, you may also be called upon to defend all that is dear to you.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|When that day comes, seek all the light and wonder of this world, and fight.}}
:''Yu'lon peels off and back towards the temple.''
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|We live together, or we die together. All of Pandaria is connected.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|I grow weary. I must rest now.}}
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|Good-bye, little one.  I will see you soon enough.}}
:''Yu'lon drops the adventurer off near the temple's front steps inside the [[Jade Temple Grounds]] and flies off.''

Speak with [[Elder Sage Wind-Yi]] to continue. On complete, [[Get Back Here!]] automatically begins.

This completes "The Temple of the Jade Serpent" portion of [[Upjade Complete]].
