{{questportrait|Captain Doren.jpg|Captain Doren|The entirety of Strongarm Airstrip reports to Doren. Take him down!}}
== Objectives ==
Slay Captain Doren.
* [[Doren|Captain Doren]] slain

== Description ==
You didn't see Captain Doren while you were out there, did you?

That sniveling Alliance leader must be in hiding somewhere. If he wasn't in that airbase, he can't be far. Search the perimeter - try searching the cave southwest of the main airfield. I want the Alliance gone from here!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|19|60}}

==Progress==
On your way then, <name>.

== Completion ==
The Alliance have been routed. You, Nazgrim, Kiryn, Gorrok, Shokia, and Rivett need a base of operations.

These flags will have to be changed.

For the Horde!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|General Nazgrim|Their leader is still in hiding. Find him!}}

Go back and enter the [[Den of Defiance]].

When first engaging Doren:
:{{text|yell|Captain Doren|Filthy animals! Keep your stink away from this land!}}
''When Captain Doren is on low health, he transforms into a hideous form!''
:{{text|say|Captain Doren|NO... I've let [[Varian Wrynn|my king]] down. I... I...}}
:{{text|say|Captain Doren|AAAHHHHH!!}}
:{{text|yell|Captain Doren|Your Horde has no power here.}}
''After killing Doren:''
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|You finished him - well done!}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|What is this... shadow? What is the Alliance playing at?}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Your foe was overwhelmed by a dark energy we call the "Sha." It thrives on negative emotions, such as doubt.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|It has been many years since I have seen it manifest so dramatically.}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|You again. Do you see it now? Alliance arrogance!}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Help us rout them from your land, and your kind can stand tall and proud with the Horde!}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|My people have stood tall without you for thousands of years.}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Are you afraid to fight?}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|We are not afraid to fight. Our warriors, while few in number, are extremely skilled.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|But we will not participate in this... race war... bloodbath of yours.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Your conflict will have immense consequences here. Do NOT bring your war to these shores!}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|This is a hostile land, and we have no reinforcements. We're going to have to improvise, champion.}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|But our orders stand - Hellscream will have his foothold here. We will NOT allow the Alliance to lay claim to this new world!}}
''Feel free to read [[Doren's Logs]] that are on the table in the cave.''
