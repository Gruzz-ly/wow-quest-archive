;Speaking with Kiry
:I cannot express how happy I am today after spending time with you both.

:But about the matter you've come for...

:<Kirygosa smiles sadly.>

:{{Gossip|Will you return to the [[Dragon Isles]] with us?}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|This is difficult for me to say. I cannot return to the Isles.}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|Not now... not for a while.}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|It is just, this place, these people, I've found... for the first time in a long time, I have agency in my own life.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|You know, you'd love these folk called the [[tuskarr]]. I learned a valuable lesson from them recently.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Wherever we may be, wherever we may go...}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|...family will always be family.}}

;Speaking with Kalec
:I wish the outcome was different. But if Kiry is truly happy here, then I couldn't possibly ask for anything more.

:Thank you for coming with me. It is time we returned to the Archives.

:{{Gossip|I'm ready to return to the Azure Archives.}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|Thank you.}}
