Well?  Where's Hao?

Don't tell me you couldn't find him...

==Completion==
You did it! You brought my honey-bear back!

Oh thank you, <name>! Thank you!

==Notes==
Hop in the cart:
:{{text|say|Hao Mann|Hold on tight!}}
[[Brittle Greenstone Gorger]]s will attack the cart on the way. Fend them off. They are brittle, so every attack is a critical strike.
:{{text|say|Hao Mann|Crazy nibblers! Give 'em a whoopin, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Hao Mann|Daggone critters don't know when to give up, do they?!}}
:{{text|say|Hao Mann|We're almost to the fresco. Keep it up back there!}}
Reaching the omen:
:{{text|say|Hao Mann|Hoh-hohhh! What a rush! I like you, <class>. You keep things interesting.}}
:''Hao heads up the rise.''
:{{text|say|Hao Mann|Snow lily! We're back from the quarry! Got a special delivery just for you, my sweetness.}}
:''Mrs. Mann blurts out in relief, then clears her throat in front of their visitors.''
:{{text|say|Foreman Mann|Honey-Bear!  I mean...  It's about time.}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Mann|Don't you "snow lily" me! I was- WE- were worried sick about you.}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Mann|And the delivery is not for ME, Hao! The honorable Lorewalker has been waitin- oh...}}
:''Hao settles his wife down with a kiss on the cheek.''
:{{text|say|Hao Mann|Sorry to keep you waiting, sugarfur. I know how you worry. Truth is, this stranger here saved my old hide. Go figure.}}
:{{text|emote|Hao Mann gives you a sly wink.}}

Foreman Mann:
:This old bear... I can't stay mad at him.

:Thank you, stranger.


On complete, the camera pulls back to show the second fresco complete!

Lorewalker Cho:
:Take a look, <name>.  This panel clearly depicts war.

:What could be next?  What is it trying to say?
