== Objectives ==
Slay 15 Strongarm troops at [[Strongarm Airstrip]].
* Strongarm troop slain (15)

== Description ==
I have found their hidden airfield, <name>: the Strongarm Airstrip. It wasn't hard to spot, it's swarming with Alliance.

<Nazgrim spits.>

They think they've wiped us out, but we're Horde! We fight until we're corpses... and sometimes even afterwards. Let them taste our steel!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
Slay them all.

== Completion ==
The best thing about killing Alliance in [[Pandaria]]? It'll be months before they get any reinforcements.

This land will belong to the Horde, <class>. We're nearly finished.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Strongarm Airman|Strongarm Airmen]], [[Strongarm Medic]]s, [[Strongarm Ace]]s, [[Strongarm Private]]s, and [[Strongarm Lieutenant]]s.
