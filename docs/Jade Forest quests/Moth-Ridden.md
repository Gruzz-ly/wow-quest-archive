==Objectives==
Kill 8 Dappled Moths.
*[[Dappled Moth]] slain (8)

==Description==
Moths have infested the library.  Moths!

Any librarian worth his letters knows that moths are the most dangerous threat to paper, second only to bookworms.

As it turns out, my assistants are a useless bunch of insect-fearing cowards.

Please, you MUST help me get rid of the moths immediately!  The works of a thousand [[pandaren]] storytellers depend on you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can see the moths eating the pages from here!

==Completion==
Yes, yes, thank you!  You've thinned out their numbers wonderfully.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Pages of History]] before getting started. Inspect any infested books. A large number of bookworms will pop out. Rather than kill them normally, click them to do a huge amount of damage. Kill the moths normally.
