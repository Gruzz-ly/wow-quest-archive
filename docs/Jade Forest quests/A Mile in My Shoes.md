== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Lorewalker Cho]] at the [[Circle of Bone (Jade Forest)|Circle of Bone]].

== Description ==
Oh, where have my manners gone? Technically, I suppose I am the host here.

Allow me to tell you a little bit about myself and my people before asking questions of you.

== Completion ==
I suppose the best way to explain what a Lorewalker is all about is to show you...

==Notes==
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Follow me, traveler. Let us get to know one another better.}}
:''Cho mounts a dragon turtle.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I am known as a Lorewalker - a kind of historian for my people.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|As such, knowledge is my armor, and I carry a quill in place of a sword.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Much of Pandaria's past is shrouded in mystery, even to us.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|A Lorewalker's sworn duty is to rediscover our history - to rend that shroud, piece by piece.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|This demands a tireless search for ancient clues, and the wisdom to interpret them.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Ahh, here we are. Be careful - I've had trouble in this area before.}}
