== Objectives ==
Obtain 80 vials of Blushleaf Extract from Blushleaf Clusters in the [[Waxwood Forest]].
* [[Blushleaf Extract]] (80)

== Description ==
The black walnut extract you purchased from {{NPC||June Whiteblossom||Miss Whiteblossom}} is but one of many extracts we keep in stock for various applications.

Blushleaf extract can be gathered from the flowers in the Waxwood Forest to the west. Several units can be extracted from one flower, but only those with calm nerves and steady hands can remove all of the extract from one flower.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

== Progress ==
It is said that the ancient [[herbalism]] masters were able to remove 20 vials of extract from each blossom.

== Completion ==
Do not forget to wash your hands. Blushleaf stains forever.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Strong Back]] and [[And a Heavy Fist]] before heading out. Exit to the northwest, either through or around the [[Ring of Inner Focus]], and pick up [[Burning Bright]] from {{NPC||Guard Shan Long}} before entering the Waxwood.

Blushleaf can be gathered in groups of up to ~15 from [[Blushleaf Cluster]]s. Picking them up gives the player Blushleaf Residue buff.
