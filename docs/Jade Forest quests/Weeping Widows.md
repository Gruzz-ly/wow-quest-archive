==Objectives==
Kill 7 Weeping Widows.
*[[Weeping Widow]] slain (7)

==Description==
The [[spider]]s near [[Sri-La Village]] have grown very aggressive.  They pose a severe problem to the anglers who fish along the coast.

For their safety, I need you to go and eliminate the Weeping Widows in [[The Widow's Wail]].

You can find the cave along the coast to the north.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
I fear that something is affecting the spiders.  Their behavior is quite unusual.

==Completion==
Instructor Skythorn updated me on the situation at The Widow's Wail.  You have done well.

==Notes==
Make sure to pick up  [[Lingering Doubt (quest)]] and [[The Seed of Doubt]] before you leave.

In the beta, Weeping Widows pulled from the ceiling didn't count, although they would also not aggro when you walked right beneath them, making navigating the cave much more pleasant.
