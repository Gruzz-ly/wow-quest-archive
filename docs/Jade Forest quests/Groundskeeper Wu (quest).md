== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Groundskeeper Wu}} at the [[Tian Monastery]] in the [[Jade Forest]].

== Description ==
We don't have many rules here, but we do have one particular rule that is worth remembering. If you want to eat...

<Xiao's stomach grumbles audibly.>

...you have to work. Groundskeeper Wu can give you your chores for the day. He's in the market, to the west.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||98}}
* 11000 XP

== Completion ==
<Wu addresses you sharply.>

<Name>, is it? The High Elder's favored son? Yes, I remember you from the banquet.

Don't expect any special treatment from me, boy. You'll be working just as hard as the greenest pandaren trainee here.

Perhaps harder.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Your Training Starts Now]] and [[Becoming Battle-Ready]] before heading out.

Wu can be found overlooking the trade area in front of the inn, [[Paur's Pub]].
