==Objectives==
Feed the carp and clean their ponds of debris in [[Dawn's Blossom]].
*[[Carp]]s fed and ponds cleaned (0/100%)
*[[Fish Food]] (provided)

==Description==
The village carp bring fortune and peace. Their well-being reflects the health of the village.

The carp thrive on special food made from worm meal and vegetable paste. It's not as unpleasant as it sounds, especially after we finish dehydrating it into neat little blocks.

Here! Just toss it gently in the water near them.

Their ponds also require cleaning, so please skim any debris you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you finished feeding the carp?

==Completion==
All done? Thank you. The carp are so pretty, aren't they? Their scales shimmer almost like a [[dragon]]'s.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|You certainly took your time to pay me a visit.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|My duties as [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]] have gotten more... time-consuming as of late. I'm sorry, Kiry. I should've come sooner.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|So, this is where you've chosen to settle?}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|Yes. I have a daily routine. I know all the villagers. I even have my own house.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|A house?! I--I see.}}

See the water in the village. Inside are [[Shimmering Carp]], [[Veridian Carp]], and [[Pond Scum]]. Throw the Fish Food on the carp (6%) and interact with the scum (8%) to clean it.
