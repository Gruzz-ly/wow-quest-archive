Challenge and defeat Xiao at the [[Tian Monastery]].
*{{NPC||Xiao}} defeated {{co|43.1|23.6|Jade Forest}}

== Description ==
You may have already met my best student, Xiao, at the banquet tables. I personally would have graduated him several times over, but {{NPC||Instructor Xann}} insists that he needs more discipline.

If you ask me, discipline means very little if you win every fight you enter. I'm curious to see if Xiao can keep his streak alive against you.

Young Xiao has a great future in martial arts. I wish you luck in your upcoming match.

== Completion ==
I must admit, I was never surprised, <race>. You are a born fighter, and an excellent <class>.

== Notes ==
Speak with Xiao at the [[Banquet Grounds]]:
* I can't say I mind the food here.  Or the beer for that matter.
* Have you tried the rice?  You really need to try the rice.
* Eating is form of training, too, you know.
