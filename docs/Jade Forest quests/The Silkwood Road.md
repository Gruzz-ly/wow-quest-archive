==Objectives==
Defeat 8 Silkwood Stalkers.
*[[Silkwood Stalker]] slain (8)

==Description==
West of here is the Silkwood Road. It has fallen into shadow as the spiders there have turned to a more evil and gluttonous path.

I would face these villains myself but someone has to defend the noodle shop from... um... dangers and such.

Go, hero, and conquer these beasts! Should you succeed perhaps I shall regale you with some of my epic tales of heroism.

I'll also pay you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Depending on your class and specialization you will get one of the following items:
|Ambermist Robe
|Blackthicket Robes
|Jade Witch Armor
|Glass Lake Chestguard
|Silkwood Robe
|Deepwoods Tunic
|Fox Grove Armor
|Thunderwood Chestpiece
|Jade Tiger Chestpiece}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The silkwood stalkers are not in balance with nature. Predators are one thing but these creatures kill for pleasure. Harmony must be restored.

==Completion==
Such a noble hero. You remind me of a younger, less good looking version of myself.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Double Hozen Dare]] and [[The Threads that Stick]] before heading out. Exit town to the south and take the first right. Silk caches are near trees and spiders are everywhere. Keep heading west in the Silkwood to reach the Central Bamboo Forest. An Windfur will join the party and offer [[Down Kitty!]]. Kill tigers and talk to pandaren. Complete both her quests and pick up [[The Jade Witch]]. Kill the Jade Witch, then return to [[Dawn's Blossom]].
