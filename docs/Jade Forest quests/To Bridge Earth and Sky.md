== Objectives ==
Protect {{NPC||Pei-Zhi}} during his ritual at the [[Terrace of Ten Thunders]].
*Protect Pei-Zhi during his ritual {{co|43.8|12.5|Jade Forest}}

== Description ==
We are ready to open [[The Tan-Chao|the tan-chao]] and guide all of these spirits back to peace.

If I may, I would have your assistance once more. The [[mogu]] will surely sense the ritual taking place and will do everything in their power to halt it. I need only a few moments without interference, and once the path is open it will surge too greatly to be closed.

If you are willing to help one more time, please accompany me to the ritual site.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

== Completion ==
<A simulacrum imbued with the ancient and powerful spirit of {{NPC||Pei-Zhi}} would make a horrifying weapon for the mogu. {{NPC||Shan Jitong}} must be stopped!>

On accept, Pei-Zhi will start running to the northwest:
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|There's an altar near by where I can conduct the ritual. Let's go!}}
At the altar:
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|Here we are... Keep them off me while I open the tan-chao, <name>!}}
A progress bar will appear, gaining 5% every few seconds. A {{NPC||Shan'ze Spiritclaw}} will appear every 15–20 seconds while Pei-Zhi conducts the ritual. Keep them off of him.
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|We are the lost. We know not who we are, or where we belong. We wander in darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|We see a flicker of flame. It seems far, but we know it to be close.}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|In the dancing glow, we see an empty bowl. We fill the bowl - it becomes our body. We rest.}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|We fear not the darkness of this world - we know it is but shadow, cast by the glorious world beyond.}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|We fear not the brilliance of the tan-chao - we know it is a path home. The bridge between earth and sky.}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|It is done!}}
:''The tan-chao, an orb of energy that has been steadily growing in size high above the altar, suddenly ignites like a star.''

If Pei-Zhi is attacked during the ritual:
*{{Text|say|Pei-Zhi|Get them off me! I need total concentration to open the tan-chao!}}
*{{Text|say|Pei-Zhi|Help, <name>! I'm under attack!}}
*{{Text|say|Pei-Zhi|I can't open the tan-chao while I'm under attack!}}

The quest completes automatically at this point, but the event continues...
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|Finally... we'll see an end to this torture.}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|I'll follow them soon, but first let me express my grati-}}

:''Suddenly, a demon portal opens and Shan Jitong appears!''
:{{text|yell|Shan Jitong|Spiritsage!!}}
:''Shan Jitong quickly lashes out a spell that Spirit Shackles Pei-Zhi.
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|I told you I'd have you, Pei-Zhi. You've set us back thousands of spirits today, but I'd glady trade them all to see you bound.}}
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|As for YOU, little <class>.}}
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|It's no use sending more claws to die at your feet. Instead, I'll leave you this warning...}}
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|Run away and don't look back. Even you cannot hope to face the product of my next spirit-binding.}}
:''Jitong turns and enters the portal.  The Spirit Shackle spell drags the helpless Pei-Zhi through the portal, which then closes behind him.''
