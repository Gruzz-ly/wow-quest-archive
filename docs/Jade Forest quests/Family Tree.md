==Objectives==
Light the Incense Bundle at the [[Circle of Stone]].
* Light the Incense

==Description==
So there you have it, traveler, or as much of it as would make for a proper introduction, hmm?

What of you, then? Are your people so much different than mine?

Surely, there must be things we share in common. Let us see...

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

==Progress==
A fine day we're having, wouldn't you say?

==Completion==
Not so different, you and I.

I believe we can become good friends.

==Notes==
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I would very much like to hear about your ancestors, stranger. Light the incense and let's reflect on where you came from, hm?}}
Use the [[Incense Bundle (Jade Forest)|Incense Bundle]] when prompted to. Depending on your race, he will make a comment about it.

* {{Race|Blood elf (playable)}}: {{text|say|Ah, noble is your lineage! Your people possess GREAT power, and all the terrible burdens that come with it. Equally great has been your suffering. Now I see why you call yourself 'Blood' elves.}}
* {{Race|Goblin (playable)}}: {{text|say|Well... that's interesting. It appears most of your ancestors died in a fire. Oh my. Your people put themselves at great personal risk in the name of progress! I wish more Pandaren had your initiative.}}
* {{Race|Orc (playable)}} or {{Race|Mag'har(playable)}}: {{text|say|Astounding! A lineage of great warriors... From a different world, no less! It is rare for a Pandaren to leave his or her homeland. You are rightly proud of who you are.}}
* {{Race|Pandaren (playable)}}: {{text|say|Ah, but you're no stranger to your past! A Pandaren from the Wandering Isle. I admit, I thought your homeland was just a legend. Pandaren from the Isle are far more adventurous than those on the mainland... it's in your blood!}}
* {{Race|Tauren (playable)}}: {{text|say|Look at that. Your people revere their ancestors as well. And you cherish the land. We have much in common! Ah, but I see your ancestors were nomads, whereas we Pandaren prefer the comforts of hearth and home. You'll find few travelers among us.}}
* {{Race|Troll (playable)}} or {{Race|Zandalari(playable)}}: {{text|say|Oh my - as I suspected. Your ancestry dates back to the dawn of the world. Great were the ancient empires of the trolls. I see a spark in your eyes, a powerful will - you wish to be great again, yes?}}
* {{Race|Undead (playable)}}: {{text|say|How fascinating. I thought you looked sickly - but now I see the truth. Your people suffer under the weight of a terrible darkness. What strength you must have, simply to press onward!}}

For other [[allied race]]s, he will say:
* {{text|say|Your ancestry is rich with stories. Fascinating! I look forward to learning more, <race>. Perhaps I should fetch some stronger incense!"}}
