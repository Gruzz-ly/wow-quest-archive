==Objectives==
[[File:Celestial Jade.jpg|thumb|Celestial Jade]]
Use Celestial Jade Chunks to defeat 6 Sha Remnants.
*[[Sha Remnant]] slain (6)

==Description==
The more powerful remnants of [[Sha of Doubt|that horrible manifestation]] may be too much for you to handle on your own, <name>.

I fear I'd be of little help in terms of actual combat, but I can suggest a solution.

The great jade statue was soon to become a living serpent - one of our [[August Celestials|revered celestials]]. Its construction imbued it with special powers that may sufficiently weaken these adversaries.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the jade, <name>?

==Completion==
<Cho looks at you despondently.>

This jade was meant for... so much more.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Residual Fallout]] and [[Emergency Response]] before heading out.

Steer well clear of the elites unless ready to use [[Celestial Jade]] chunks to weaken them. Start killing the lesser [[Sha Echo]]es and looting jade chunks off the ground. Begin the fight with the elites by using the jade chunks on the [[Sha Remnant]]s to weaken them from elite sha with 1.8 million health to regular sha with 368,000 health.

Clear the immediate area near the battle survivors, get within a few yards, then use the Fireworks to summon Mishka.

Cho is still at the southeastern serpent shrine to complete all three quests.
