==Objectives==
Listen to [[Riko]]'s report.
* Inspect the [[STAY OUT - NO VISITORS|warning sign]]
* Inspect a [[Lifelike Jade Statue]]
* Speak with [[Widow Greenpaw]]

==Description==
I bet I know your first question: "What the ook happened to [[Sergeant Gorrok]]?" Don't worry, don't worry. He's totally alive. Not dead or anything.

<Riko shuffles uncomfortably.>

Well, we THINK he's alive, but he ALSO might be very, very dead.

<Riko looks into your eyes for approval.>

Fine! Let me tell you exactly what happened.

==Progress==
I'm not ookin' done yet!

==Completion==
So, as you can see, none of this is Riko's fault.

==Notes==
Accepting the quest shifts to the perspective of Sergeant Gorrok.
:{{text|bossemote|We was travelin' east, looking for those horkin' human guys.}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Gorrok|Be on the lookout for Alliance.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Things was goin' good, so we decided to split up for a bit.}}
:{{text|bossemote|[[Shokia]] an' [[Kiryn]] went off to do some girl stuff.}}
:{{text|say|Shokia|Come on, Kiryn. Let's go do girl stuff.}}
:''Shokia and Kiryn skip merrily away from the scene.''
:{{text|bossemote|It was just me and Gorrok. I let him take the lead... him bein' all big and all.}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Gorrok|We will investigate this hut. Perhaps they have seen Alliance survivors.}}
:{{text|say|Riko|Yeah, the hut! Good idea. You go first.}}
:''Investigate the nearby warning sign.''
:{{text|say|Sergeant Gorrok|"Stay out - no visitors." Hah!}}
:{{text|say|Riko|Hey Gorrok, which girl do you like? Shokia or Kiryn?}}
:''Inspect the nearby lifelike jade statue.''
:{{text|say|Sergeant Gorrok|These statues... they are almost lifelike. Something's wrong here, Riko.}}
:{{text|say|Riko|You wanna know who I like? I like Kiryn. She's got pretty eyes.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Everything was goin' great! I felt like we was really bonding.}}
:{{text|bossemote|After inspecting the statues, we saw this old lady [[pandaren]] come out of the house.}}

*Talk to Widow Greenpaw.
:What manner of creature are you?
:<The pandaren pauses, her eyes growing wide.>
:My... look at that gorgeous green skin!
:{{gossip|I am an [[orc]], ma'am. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?}}
:{{text|say|Widow Greenpaw|Questions? Hah! AHHH HA HA HAAAA!}}
:{{text|yell|Widow Greenpaw|You, "orc", will make an excellent addition to my family!}}
:''Widow Greenpaw turns Gorrok into a jade statue!''
:{{text|say|Riko|So, Gorrok, do you think I have a chance with Kiryn?}}
:''Riko turns around and looks at Gorrok first then Widow Greenpaw, back and forth.''
:{{text|say|Riko|What the ookin' hork...?}}
:''Riko runs away from the scene.''
On completion:
:{{text|say|Shokia|All right Riko, I think <name> has heard enough. Kiryn can tell the next part.}}

In case you interrupt controlling Gorrok, speak with Riko again.
:{{Gossip|Go on, Riko.}}

In case the quest bugs, and it won't allow you to click on the sign, try leaving Gorrok and speak with Riko again. If it still won't work, mount up, and then speak with Riko.
