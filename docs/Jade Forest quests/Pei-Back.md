== Description ==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|60}}
* 138000 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
This age must be one of great strife to breed heroes such as you. I can only imagine what adventures must lie ahead.

It has been my great honor to have met you, <name>.

I will remain here to usher out the last of the spirits before crossing the tan-chao myself.

Still, I am disturbed by the spirit waker's dying curse...

"You will not stop the thunder."

What could he have meant?

==Notes== 
Head just to the northwest.  A large mogu construct called the [[Stonebound Colossus]] <Shadow of the Spirit-sage> patrols the area, being powered by Pei-Zhi who is Spiritbound above and behind it and under Jitong's control.  When Pei-Zhi strikes, the statue strikes.

:{{text|yell|Pei-Zhi|<Name>!  I am... not in control...  Get away!}}

The Stonebound Colossus is a level 85 simulacrum with 1,264,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic melee|Hits for ~4500 Physical on cloth}}
*{{abilities|Regenerate|note=Channeled. Heals ~15000 damage every few seconds. Cast when Shan Jitong casts Spirit Grasp.}}

When you get the Stonebound Colossus down to 90%, Shan Jitong will teleport in.

:{{text|yell|Shan Jitong|You will not interfere again!}}

Shan Jitong once again is immune via Spirit Shield and will then teleport to one of the four corners. He has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Spirit Crush|range=10|Deals 2% of the target's maximum health as shadow damage an an additional 8% if the target is afflicted by Spirit Grasp.|notes=7.5 sec cast.}}
*{{abilities|Spirit Grasp}}

Every 30 seconds, Shan Jitong will cast Spirit Grasp on all hostile units:

*{{text|yell|Shan Jitong|I will have your unruly spirit, like all the others!}}
*{{text|yell|Shan Jitong|Little spirit, you cannot hide from me in that body!}}
*{{text|yell|Shan Jitong|You are MINE!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Your spirit has been ripped from your body! Get back to your body!}}

Run to the location of your body when the spell cast happened, click on it, and then quickly perform an ability (either a counterspell or any damaging ability) on the Colossus to interrupt the heal. This is a battle for survival, as no NPCs are available to assist. Once the Colossus has been defeated, Pei-Zhi's spirit is freed and drops back down to the ground.

:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|You did it, <name>! I'm free!}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Jitong|What?! Impossible!}}
:''Pei-Zhi walks up within casting distance and casts Free Spirits at Jitong, dissipating his Spirit Shield.''
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|Time to fight your own battles, you monster! No more spirits to hide behind!}}
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|Agh! My wards!}}

In phase two, Shan Jitong, a level 85 mogu with 158k health, has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic melee|~6200 on cloth}}
*{{abilities|Shadow Bolt|range=40|Hurls a bolt of dark magic at an enemy, inflicting Shadow damage.|notes=3 sec cast.}}

Finish Shan Jitong off.

:{{text|yell|Shan Jitong|You... will not defeat... the thunder...}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|It's finally over...}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi I'll be waiting at the Tan-Chao. Come and speak to me there.}}
Return to the location of the previous quest to turn in to Pei-Zhi.

Finishing this quest completes the Ruins of Gan-Shi portion of [[Upjade Complete]].

Pei-Zhi:
: ''The spirits can finally rest, thanks to you.  Soon I, too, will return to the other side.''

: ''I leave you with this piece of advice: [[Pandaria]] is a land of history.  If ever you are unsure about the future, you need only to seek answers from the past.''

: ''Remember this, and you will thrive here.''

* Shan Jitong's last words may have been an attempt to say "the [[Thunder King]]", who the [[Mogu]] were working (and would succeed) at resurrecting.
