==Progress==
I think these methane-grenades are gunna impact the environment, if ya know what I mean.

==Completion==
I'd say repelling the attack is an understatement!

==Notes==
Upon accepting:
:{{text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Hurry, <name>! We have to start the smelling... I mean, the shelling!}}
Talk to Rivett at the east side of the village to start.

*Careful, <name>! Methane labs like these can be extremely volatile.
*Assuming this works, I'll need a name for my invention. How 'bout... Grookin Grenade?
*Woohwee! Smells like [[:Dalaran Sharp]]!
*So if i just substitute the powder with compressed...fuel, we should be in business! So to speak.
:{{gossip|quest=|Okay, Rivett. I'm ready!}}

Control the [[Skat Shooting Vehicle]].
#Throw Methane Bomb

:{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Okay, <name>. I can only make these so fast... you gotta make every shot count!}}
:''Shokia approaches.''
:{{Text|say|[[Shokia]]|I've got your back, <name>.}}

Be careful when you aim, as you can only throw a bomb once every few seconds. If you let a jinyu slip by, it'll hit you and you have to start over again. If you fail, you will still Wake Up Dead.

*{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|If we make it outta here, let's keep this part outta the story...}}
*{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Use it or lose it, mister!}}
*{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Oh, the things I do for the Horde...}}
*{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Let's hope the wind ain't blowin this way...}}
*{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Incoming!}}
*{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Here, <name>, catch!}}

*{{Text|say|Shokia|That one was already in my sights!}}
*{{Text|say|Shokia|That was my kill, <name>!}}
*{{Text|say|Shokia|Hey! Stop stealing my kills, <name>!}}
*{{Text|say|Shokia|There are plenty of targets out there for both of us...}}

When you've killed 15 of them:
:{{text|say|Shokia|Well done, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Wahoo! We did it!}}
