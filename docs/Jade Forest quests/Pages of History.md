==Objectives==
[[File:Pages of History - Bookworms.jpg|thumb|Bookworms!]]
[[File:Bookworm.jpg|thumb|[[Bookworm]].]]
Search through the library books for infestations, then squash 12 Bookworms.
*[[Bookworm]]s squashed (12)

==Description==
The worst possible thing has happened, <race>.

We. Have. Bookworms.

This is a critical situation.  All bookworms in the library must be eradicated at once to prevent their spread.

We must squash this problem, literally!  Please examine the infested books in the library and squash any bookworms that you find.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Depending on your class and specialization you will get one of the following items:
|Ambermist Treads
|Blackthicket Footguards
|Jade Witch Sabatons
|Glass Lake Greaves
|Silkwood Treads
|Deepwoods Boots
|Fox Grove Sabatons
|Thunderwood Warboots
|Jade Tiger Warboots}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My stomach is too fragile to handle the squashing of bugs. Is it done?

==Completion==
Oh, wonderful!  I am so relieved that we have managed to avert disaster.

No no, don't get too close, please.  You still have some squashed bug bits on your shoes.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Moth-Ridden]] before getting started. Inspect any [[Infested Book]]s. A large number of bookworms will pop out. Rather than kill them normally, click them to do a huge amount of damage. Kill the moths normally.
