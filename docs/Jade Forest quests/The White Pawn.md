== Objectives ==
Search the [[Wreck of the Vanguard]] in [[Jade Forest]] for clues about its cargo, and recover the Encoded Captain's Log.
*Clues found x3
*[[Encoded Captain's Log]] collected

== Description ==
Alright, soldier. I've got a critical mission for you. 

Get down to the coastline south of here - in the cove there you'll find a wrecked Alliance vessel. I need you to search it and find out if it was the ship that was carrying {{NPC||Anduin Wrynn||Anduin}}.

Then, recover the Captain's Log and see if it has any information on where we can find him. 

Since the log is from a military ship, it'll be written using a cipher - take it to {{NPC||Nodd Codejack}} afterwards. He's keeping watch on the wreck from the other end of the cove.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 111000 [[XP]]
*[[Partially Soaked Pages]]

== Progress ==
Well?

== Completion ==
Alright... let me see... using the cipher from when the ship went missing...

<Nodd is clearly doing some calculations in his head.>

Aha!

== Notes ==
[[File:Alliance Bodyguard.jpg|thumb|On deck by the stairs below deck]]
[[File:Fine Leather Journal.jpg|thumb|Below deck in the first room]]
[[File:Alliance Banner Jade Forest.jpg|thumb|Hanging on the wall to the back room]]
[[File:Naval Map.jpg|thumb|On the sand under the broken hull]]

Pick up [[Hozen Aren't Your Friends, Hozen Are Your Enemies]] before heading out.

Head southwest from Rogers' position to reach the Wreck of the Vanguard. Get started killing hozen, and head to the stern of the ship or one of the port-side windows to get aboard. Grab the clues, then find Nodd.

On deck topside is an Alliance Bodyguard:
;[[Alliance Bodyguard]]: {{text|bossemote|This soldier is not like the others. He looks like a personal bodyguard.}}
There is also a Horde Seadog and Alliance Cannon by the stern if you care to read them.
;[[Horde Seadog]]: {{text|bossemote|This Horde sailor likely met his end during the battle.}}
;[[Alliance Cannon (Jade Forest)|Alliance Cannon]]: {{text|bossemote|The cannon is dented and streaked with gunpowder.}}
Head below deck. In the very first room is the fine leather journal:
;[[Fine Leather Journal]]: {{text|bossemote|Monogrammed on the leather cover are the initials, "A.L.W."}}
:{{text|bossemote|You take the few intact pages that remain.}}
Keep heading back in the ship. The banner is hanging on a wall and the naval map is on the sand beneath the ship (but still accessible from inside):
;[[Naval Map]]: {{text|bossemote|The map shows a naval strategy for defeating the Horde fleet.}}
;[[Alliance Banner (Jade Forest)|Alliance Banner]]: {{text|bossemote|The King's royal banner. Someone of royal blood certainly slept in this chamber.}}

In the last chamber is a {{NPC||Hozen Diver}}. Kill it to loot the [[Encoded Captain's Log]].

Once the kill quota has been met, exit the ship to the northeast. {{NPC||Nodd Codejack}} is on the ridge overlooking the ship to the north.
:{{Text|say|Nodd Codejack|Watched you investigating the ship and dealing with those creatures down there. Good work. You find anything?}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Nodd Codejack|Alright, I think I know what our next move's gotta be.}}
