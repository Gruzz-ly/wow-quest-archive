== Objectives ==
[[File:Raging Beast Spirit.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Raging Beast Spirit}}]]
Throw Spirit Bottles on the ground in [[Tideview Thicket]] to release 8 Beast Spirits.
*Beast Spirits Returned to Nature x8
*[[Spirit Bottles]] (provided)

== Description ==
I'm afraid I have another favor to ask, <name>.

The bottles you recovered contain neither the spirits of [[mogu]] ancestors nor recently slain foes; they contain spirits of beasts. It seems the [[spiritclaw]]s have resorted to poaching in an effort to fuel their simulacra.

This complicates our task, for I cannot take the beasts with me through the bridge.

Take the bottles west to Tideview Thicket and smash them to return the spirits to nature. Some may be blind with rage and will need to be subdued.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

== Progress ==
Do not fear for the spirits of the beasts - they will find peace here.

== Completion ==
Their bodies have long since returned to the land - their spirits can now follow.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Humble Offering]] before heading out. Head to the northwest through the ruins to reach the thicket. Use the bottles and target the ground to release a spirit, in the form of a bear, owl, or tiger. Release one at a time in case the spirit beasts turn hostile. Then start looing around for mushrooms.

As they use [[spirit beast]] skins, the attacking spirits are classified as undead, presumably to prevent taming by hunters.

During the ''[[Mists of Pandaria]]'' beta, bears labeled [[Tidemist Bruin]]s were part of the area but were eventually removed before release. Bear spirits can still spawn during this quest, an interesting leftover of the beta.
