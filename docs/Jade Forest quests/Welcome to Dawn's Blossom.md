==Description==
[[Lorewalker Cho|Cho]]'s off on another one of his adventures, and this one requires a big order of jade. I'm going to have to call in some favors.

How 'bout in the meantime you introduce yourself to some of the locals.

Kai Wanderbrew is a good guy to know, as is Master Windfur. Oh, and say hi to Peiji Goldendraft up at the inn.

Between the three of them, you should get the feel for life in Dawn's Blossom.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*69000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
Good, good, good. You're going to fit right in.

==Notes==
Kai Wanderbrew is walking along the path near Toya's position. Speak to him:
{{dialogue|
Brewmaster Wanderbrew, at your service.

I travel the [[Jade Forest]] in search of only the finest of ingredients for my brews.

Unlike the high and mighty [[Goldendraft]]s of [[Dawn's Blossom]].

They have their big brewhouse for mass producing. Which is fine, you know, if you enjoy drinking swill.
}}

Run clockwise up to the northwest up the steps, and take a left to reach the [[Drunken Hozen]], the inn of Dawn's Blossom. Goldendraft is inside.

On approach:
{{dialogue|
{{text|say|Peiji Goldendraft|And where did you come from, I wonder? Some place that lacks for quality beverages? Hmm?}}
}}
Speak with him:
{{dialogue|
So... you're the stranger [[Lorewalker Cho|Cho]] was talking about.

Welcome to Dawn's Blossom! I am Peiji Goldendraft and my family makes only the finest brews in [[Pandaria]].

Unlike those Wanderbrews who keep slinking around ruining the good name of Brewmasters everywhere. I think I even spied the young one eyeing my daughter. Can't have that! Goldendrafts and [[Wanderbrew]]s do not mix.
}}

Exit the inn and follow the path southeast. On the left side across the bridge is a building with Master Windfur inside.

On approach:
{{dialogue|
{{text|say|Master Windfur|What a strange and curious creature. Do you come to my town with peaceful intentions?}}
}}
Speak with him:
{{dialogue|
So you are the creature who gave the [[Pearlfin Jinyu|jinyu]] the courage they needed to stand their ground against the [[Forest Hozen|hozen]].

Such courage is something we have not seen in some time. I welcome you to our humble home.
}}

Return to Toya by the flight master.

On completion:
{{dialogue|
{{text|say|Toya|I'm going to keep looking for jade. May want to ask around and see if anyone could use a hand.}}
}}

[[An Windfur]], [[Tzu the Ironbelly]], and [[Lo Wanderbrew]] all offer quests: [[The Double Hozen Dare]], [[The Silkwood Road]], and [[The Threads that Stick]].
