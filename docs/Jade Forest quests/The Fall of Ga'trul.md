== Progress ==
What's the matter, <name>?  Didn't you find [[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Sully]]?  Did Ga'trul elude you?

[[Sha]]...

Fighting the Horde on a foreign shore is hard enough.

*{{abilities|Rain of Meteors|The caster readies himself to call down multiple meteors on his enemies. Targets in the area of impact suffer 63 to 77 Shadow damage.|notes=1.73 sec cast.}}

And the following abilities in phase two:
*{{abilities|Rejection|range=60|The caster hurls raw energies of doubt at the victim, inflicting 36 to 44 Shadow damage.|notes=1.73 sec cast. Hits for 3600 Shadow.}}

:{{text|yell|Ga'trul|There's something about this land - you don't understand...}}
:''Dark gray energy begins to affect Ga'trul...''
:{{text|say|Ga'trul|They defied us - they defied Hellscream's Horde - I should've executed the whole town!}}
:''Ga'trul transforms into a [[Sha]]!''
:{{text|yell|Ga'trul|Burn, Alliance scum! BURN!}}

:''Taran Zhu and Rell Nightwind enter the keep.''
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|King's mercy - what happened here?  What WAS that thing?}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Your foe was overwhelmed by a dark energy we call the "[[Sha]]." It thrives on negative emotions, such as doubt.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|It has been many years since I have seen it manifest so dramatically.}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|I am not surprised. The Horde are monsters!}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|We are here on a peaceful rescue mission - will you help us?}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|I have seen your sky-fortress. Your people have an interesting notion of "peace."}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|Left to their own devices, the Horde will overwhelm your land. Will you not help us fight them?}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|We are not afraid to fight. Our warriors, while few in number, are extremely skilled.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|But we will not participate in this... genocidal... bloodbath of yours.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Your conflict will have immense consequences here. Do NOT bring your war to these shores!}}
''Taran Zhu exits and despawns at the bottom of the stairs.''
