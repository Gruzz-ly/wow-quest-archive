==Objectives==
Find 6 Barrels of Honeybrew in [[Honeydew Glade]].
* [[:Barrel of Honeybrew]] (6)

==Description==
Just look at this mess! All that brew gone to waste!

[[Taran Zhu]] warned us against speaking to you outsiders, but I'll take any help I can get.

We were on our way to [[Dawn's Blossom]] when the fighting broke out. Now all of our brew has been lost!

You want to make it up to us? Maybe you can find some of our Honeybrew barrels that haven't been broken. Then it wouldn't be a complete loss.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

==Completion==
Well, it's not as much as I would have hoped, but it will have to do. I guess there is no sense in cryin' over spilled brew.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|I will help you carry the barrels. Or did you think they were going to magically fit in your bag?}}

;Quest abandon
:{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|I was really hoping to find more Honeybrew. I guess I'll just try and find more on my own. Let me know if you need anymore help!}}

;Carrying kegs
:{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|My village will not enter your conflict. Though, I fear your arrival has changed our peaceful existence forever.}}
:{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|Heavy, but I can hold more! Keep going!}}
:{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|Why have you brought your war to our land? What of your homes? Was there nothing worth fighting for there?}}
:{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|I may have overestimated my own strength...}}
:{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|This Honeybrew is the lifeblood of this village. Now THAT is something worth fighting for!}}
:{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|Thank you for your help. I'll make sure this Honeybrew gets back to the village. Try not to blow anything else up!}}

;Random
*{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|Honeydew Village is run by the [[Honeydew]]s, but the real heart of the village is the brewery! The brewery belongs to my family, the [[Honeypaw]]s. Best Honeybrew you'll find anywhere!}}
*{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|Horde, Alliance... what's the difference?! Do you not both love a good brew? Do you both not value your friends and families the same?}}
*{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|All this fighting is such a waste. How do your people do it all the time? When do you find time to celebrate and enjoy the simple things?}}
*{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|Why is it you can't just talk out your differences? I have never encountered a problem that a good long talk couldn't fix!}}
*{{Text|say|Gi-Oh|We were on our way to [[Dawn's Blossom]] for a festival before you arrived! When I imagined fireworks tonight, I didn't expect it to be like this!}}
