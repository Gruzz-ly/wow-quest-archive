== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Kung Din.jpg|Kung Din|The great beast holds the key.}}
Obtain the Slingtail Key by slaying [[Kung Din]]{{co|54.7|80.1|Jade Forest}}
*[[Slingtail Key]]

== Description ==
I hope you are capable of this next task, for our lives depend on it.

There is only one key that will unlock our chains. Unfortunately, the key hangs around the neck of the [[hozen]]'s pet [[tiger]], Kung Din.

They keep the tiger in the great pit to the east. The only way to retrieve the key will be to kill the beast.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Landfall Satin Treads
|Landfall Silk Treads
|Landfall Leather Boots
|Landfall Moccasins

|Landfall Sabatons

|Landfall Plate Boots
|Landfall Warboots}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||20}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+4,000 reputation with [[Pearlfin Jinyu]]

== Progress ==
Did you find him?

== Completion ==
Yes, with this key I will be able to free our chains.

You have delivered us from this vile place.

== Notes ==
Kung Din can be found to the northeast in a big bamboo spike-lined pit. He has the following ability:
*{{abilities|Ravage|Kung Din claws at you, inflicting Physical damage.|id=116486|notes=Instant, channeled, ticks for Physical damage every second.}}

He also has a pounce move, announced by the following boss emote:
:{{text|bossemote|Kung Din pounced on you! Fight for your life!}}

This stuns the player, then pops up the vehicle UI with one ability available:
*{{Abilities|Fight For Your Life|Punch Kung Din in the face!|id=116506|icon=ability_warrior_secondwind|notes=Deals Physical damage to Kung Din.|cd=1 sec}}

Fight him normally unless he pounces, then spam the first ability in the vehicle UI. Make sure to get at least one hit in before he dies and loot the corpse, then return back to camp.

==Progression==
{{Spirits of the Water}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
