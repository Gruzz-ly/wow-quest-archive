==Objectives==
Kill 8 Alliance Infiltrators near the [[Scenic Overlook]].
* [[Alliance Infiltrator]] slain (8)

== Description ==
Prince [[Anduin Wrynn]]. The very son of our enemy's [[Varian Wrynn|king]]! Fortune has smiled on the [[Horde]] once again, <name>.

But there's another side of this coin. We'd be naive to think the child was left alone.

Any [[Alliance]] scum within sight of this land must be searching desperately for their precious princeling.

You and I are going to scour the area and root out his would-be rescuers.

==Progress==
I love the sound of screaming Alliance in the morning.

Yes!

By [[Thrall]]'s bloodiest fist, I've missed hunting Alliance!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|General Nazgrim|The stench of Alliance scum is in the air.}}

For a second, you can click on Nazgrim before he joins you:
:{{Gossip|Are you coming?}}

Pick up [[Green-ish Energy]] from [[Rivett Clutchpop]] at the hill. Nazgrim accompanies the player. He has special gossip:
:I'm not about to let this Alliance scum steal back my prize.
