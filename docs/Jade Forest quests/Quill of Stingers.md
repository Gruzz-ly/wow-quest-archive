==Objectives==
Gather 6 Wasp Stingers from [[Orchard Wasp]]s.
*[[Wasp Stinger]] (6)

==Description==
To achieve perfect paint strokes, one must have the right tools. My own have fallen into disrepair, their bristles becoming as unmanageable as hozu hair.

Have you seen the [[wasp]]s throughout the [[Arboretum]]? Their stingers can be fashioned into quills that provide just the right lvel of sharpness in each line.

Could you gather some for me please?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Depending on your class and specialization you will get one of the following items:
|Ambermist Leggings
|Blackthicket Legguards
|Jade Witch Legguards
|Glass Lake Legplates
|Silkwood Trousers
|Deepwoods Legguards

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you been able to acquire some stingers? I would normally ask a monk for help with this but they all seem to be elsewhere at the moment.

==Completion==
My thanks traveler. These will make a fine set of quills. Here is something for your trouble.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Perfect Color]] before heading out. Kill wasps and loot petals.
