== Objectives ==
Motivate 10 Lazy Hozen.
* Hozen Motivated (10)
* [[Bucket of Slicky Water]]

== Description ==
Training these savages has been quite a task, <name>.

Finding ways to motivate them was easy enough; the problem is keeping them motivated.. and focused... and awake.

Now that you're back, you can help me in getting the less disciplined Hozen moving, if you catch my drift. I'll leave the method up to you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}

== Progress ==
Are the Hozen ready to deploy?

== Completion ==
Hrmm, I'll be surprised if we can keep these creatures focused enough to employ any tactics at all, <name>.

They'd better not get in my way when blades begin to fly.
