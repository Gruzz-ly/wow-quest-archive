== Objectives ==
Destroy 2 Training Bags. Follow {{NPC||Instructor Xann}}'s instructions to determing which bags to attack.
*[[Training Bag]] slain (2)

== Description ==
Your next test also involves concentration and attention. I want you to practice your abilities on the training bags in the pit below.

The bags are hung in groups of two. When I call out "Left", attack the bag on the left. When I call out "Right", attack the bag on the right.

If you fail to follow my simple directions, this task will become much harder.

Now beat on those practice bags until they burst, <name>.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|Depending on your class and specialization you will get one of the following items:
|Ambermist Cord
|Blackthicket Belt
|Jade Witch Waistguard
|Glass Lake Clasp
|Silkwood Cord
|Deepwoods Belt
|Fox Grove Belt
|Thunderwood Girdle
|Jade Tiger Girdle}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110,000 XP

== Progress ==
What are you waiting for?

== Completion ==
You may not be a full-time trainee here, but do not let that keep you from learning anything.

I can assure you, the ability to quickly switch targets will prove valuable in future fights.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Instructor Xann|I will yell out commands for "Left" and "Right". Pay close attention, <class>.}}

Boss emotes will appear, either "{{text|bossemote|LEFT!}}" or "{{text|bossemote|RIGHT!}}". Attack the appropriate training bag until he changes sides. He changes every 5, 10, or 15 seconds. The training bags share a 2.3 million hit point pool, so this will take some time. The "wrong" bags are buffed with Absorb, which absorbs 99% of all incoming damage. Deplete the health pool and return to Xann.
