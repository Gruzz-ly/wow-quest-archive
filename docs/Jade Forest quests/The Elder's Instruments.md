Collect the Waterspeaker's Staff, Ceremonial Robe, Jade Crown, and Rosewood Beads from [[Slingtail Stickypaw]]s.
*[[Waterspeaker's Staff]]
*[[Ceremonial Robes (quest item)]]
*[[Jade Crown]]
*[[Rosewood Beads]]

==Description==
Oh dear, oh dear... [[Elder Lusshan|The Elder]] mustn't find out!

I must have left the Elder's ceremonial instruments behind during the escape.

But... [[Moonwater Retreat]] is crawling with [[hozen]] by now!

What sort of Pearlkeeper am I, to have lost them so carelessly?

<The old [[jinyu]] buries his face into his hands.>

Stranger, could you find it in your heart to help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]
*+2500 [[reputation]] with [[Pearlfin Jinyu]]

==Progress==
The Elder is a Waterspeaker. He speaks to the waters, and they answer.

==Completion==
You found them? Oh thank the spirits of water!

You have saved my tailfin, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Family Heirlooms]] before heading out. Down to the southeast, follow the path up the hill to Moonwater Retreat. Keep killing pillagers until all four items have been found, and keep looting villagers until enough heirlooms have been found.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Pearlkeeper Fujin|You brought back the instruments just in time, <name>. The Elder is ready to perform the waterspeaking ceremony.}}

==Progression==
{{Spirits of the Water}}
