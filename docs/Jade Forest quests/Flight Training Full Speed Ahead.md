==Notes==
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|Your cloud serpent approaches, <name>. When you are ready, hop on and we will begin.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|Students of our Order test their speed in an aerial competition known as the [[Sky Race]].}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|I will teach you the rules of this race. Follow me!}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|I will gain speed as the exercise continues. Try to keep up.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|I will guide you with this rope. If you get too far away from me, it will break and I will be forced to restart the exercise.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|If you start to get too far, I will warn you. If you continue to stray, I will not hesitate to fail you.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|Do you see the hanging pennants above our heads? These flags mark the race course. If you ever get lost, you can use these flags as a guide.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|Spread among the spires are 10 hot air balloons, or checkpoints. We are passing one just now.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|In a real race, you will need to fly through each checkered flag to get credit for passing the checkpoint.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|You must fly through all 10 checkpoints before you can finish the race.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|The pennants mark the race course, but you will not be penalized for finding other routes.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|You may find that other paths are faster.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|I have shown you part of the course. Now, let us see the finish line. Follow me!}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|Remember, in a real race, you will compete against the other trainees in the Order.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|The stakes will be high.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|The faster you race, the better your prize.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|This is the finish line. After you have thrown through all 10 checkpoints, fly under the finish line to lock in your place.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|That concludes our lesson.}}
