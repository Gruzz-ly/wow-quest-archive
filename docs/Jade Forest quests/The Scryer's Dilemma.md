==Objectives==
Kill [[Water Fiend]]s to recover [[Wise Mari]]'s Staff.
*[[Scryer's Staff]]

==Description==
Since you were so helpful at [[Greenstone Quarry|the mines]], would you be willing to help us with a small problem here at the temple?

Wise Mari has been complaining recently of a disturbance in [[Fountain of the Everseeing|his temple]].

The water sprites have gotten quite playful recently, and made off with his ceremonial staff.

If you could help him, I would be most grateful. I may even put in a word with the [[Jade Serpent]] for you.

Just follow the path to the north.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The pools are clouded. I will need my staff to calm the spirits and speak to the water.

==Completion==
I am but an old [[jinyu]], and those pesky water sprites were impossible to catch.  Thank you, <name>, for returning my staff to me.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Librarian's Quandary]], [[The Rider's Bind]], and [[Lighting Up the Sky]] before heading out. Head north out of the [[Terrace of the Twin Dragons]] to reach the [[Fountain of the Everseeing]]. Inside, kill sprites until the staff drops, then turn it in.
