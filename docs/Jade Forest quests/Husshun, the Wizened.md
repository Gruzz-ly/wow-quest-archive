== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Husshun.jpg|Husshun|Not surprisingly, you can find him by the water.}}
Challenge and defeat Husshun at the [[Tian Monastery]].
*{{NPC||Husshun}} defeated {{co|44.6|24.0|Jade Forest}}

== Description ==
The [[jinyu]] are long-standing allies of the [[pandaren]], and we welcome any of their kind into our monastery.  Husshun, one of their elder shaman, is one of our newest trainees.

His skills as a monk are mediocre at best, but he is still a fierce combatant.  He should provide you with the challenge that you deserve.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110,000 XP

== Progress ==
I do not know why he decided to take the monastic path so late in life.  It is not my place to ask.  Such questions fall under the responsibility of our [[Spirit-Sage Gaoquan|Spirit-Sage]].

== Completion ==
I must warn you, <Class>:

If you continue defeating my best trainees, I will no longer be able to train you.  And then you will have no excuse to enjoy the presence of my company.

Think wisely before you quickly dispatch any more of my students.

<It is difficult to tell if Master Stone Fist is joking.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Zhi-Zhi, the Dextrous]] before heading out. Husshun can be found to the northeast, near the water between the two buildings.

* I like this place.  Although it needs more water... I like it.
* The pandaren elders were wise to allow the jinyu into their monastery.

: They were unwise to allow the [[hozen]] the same privileges.

* I have learned much from these monks, <race>.  You would do well to do the same.
