==Objectives==
Kill the Shadowfae Madcap.
*[[Shadowfae Madcap]] slain

==Description==
There is another task I must ask of you.

The leader of the woodland sprites is the Shadowfae Madcap.

If there is trouble brewing, he is the mastermind pulling the puppet strings.

We do not have time to deal with the sprites' tiresome pranks and insolence. Take out the Shadowfae Madcap, and be quick about it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+600 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
The only thing I like less than a forest sprite is a mountain sprite. Those mountain sprites will put vinegar in your brew and nails in your shoes.

==Completion==
Good riddance. With everything that is worrying us these days, it is good to have one less problem to worry about.
