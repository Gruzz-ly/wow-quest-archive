== Objectives ==
Slay [[Captain Doren]] in [[Thunder Hold]].
* Destroy the first barricade
* Destroy the second barricade
* Destroy the third barricade
* Find Captain Doren
* [[Nazgrim's Flare Gun]] (provided)

== Description ==
We've learned that their captain has barricaded himself in above us.

The coward allowed his forces to die while he hid from our fury! Typical Alliance! No matter. He cannot delay his fate any longer.

I will scale the walls with my [[marine]]s while you lead a frontal assault up the ramps. Use your flare gun on munitions near the barricades to blast your way through.

We will meet you up top and destroy this pathetic excuse for a captain together!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Completion ==
An air base - they had a hidden airbase here this entire time! Had I know I would've kept more men on the guns, I would've - Uaaghh -

<The color drains from Nazgrim's face, and his body begins to exude a mysterious dark energy.>

==Notes==
Use the flare gun on the firework at the barricades.

:{{Text|yell|[[Thunder Hold Sharp-Shooter]]|There's a <class> incoming! Don't let him through!}}

When at the top, [[Kor'kron Dubs]] greets you.
:{{text|say|Kor'kron Dubs|<Name>! You're here! Assault their leader and we will back you up.}}
When you get to the top and go to Doren, he will jump off the edge and into [[Doren's Gyrocopter|his gyrocopter]].
:{{text|yell|Captain Doren|You scum will NOT destroy this land as you defiled [[Kalimdor]]!}}
:{{text|yell|General Nazgrim|Coward!}}
Doren and his other [[gyrocopter]] troops shoot down ''[[Hellscream's Fist]]''.
:{{text|yell|General Nazgrim|What is - no - NO! They had an airbase, a hidden airbase... my ship - my - [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]] will have my head!}}

When completing the quest, Nazgrim suddenly transforms...
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|They all must die.}}
Out of nowhere, a pandaren appears and cleanses Nazgrim of the [[Sha]] that transformed him.
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|You! Bear-creature. What kind of sorcery was that?}}
:{{text|say|[[Taran Zhu]]|Stranger - your own doubts have been made manifest. Pandaria is not like whatever land you come from; it lives and breathes. YOU should be careful what kind of energy you bring here.}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|We bring only our honor and the desire to crush our enemies. Have your kind been aiding the Alliance?}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|It is not our desire to get wrapped up in your bloodshed. Now have your men lower their weapons, or you will face TWO enemies on this continent.}}
