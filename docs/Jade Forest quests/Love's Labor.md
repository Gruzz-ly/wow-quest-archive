==Description==
Can I trouble you for another favor?

We're way behind schedule, and this jade shipment is the last we need to finish the great statue.

I've got my hands full, so could you run this ore over to the other foremen?

Historian Dinh, Surveyor Sawa, and Kitemaster Shoku can all be found around the base of the statue. Taskmaster Emi is directing production at the top of the statue.

We're on a deadline, so make sure you do it fast! Time's a wasting!

==Progress==
Did you deliver the jade in time?

==Completion==
What, done already? You're quite the runner, <class>. You ever thought about making a living out of this?

==Notes==
On accept, you will be buffed with "Jade Delivery: Delivering an important shipment of jade." and a barrel of jade will appear on your back.

Down to the southwest is [[Historian Dinh]]:
: Sometimes it is good to take a step back and reflect upon our larger goals.
:{{gossip|''I've got a new jade shipment for you.''}}
* {{text|say|Lovely, beautiful!  If you have time, you should also visit the [[Temple of the Jade Serpent|East Temple]].  You may gain further insight into our great statue, and its importance to our way of life.}}

Just north is [[Surveyor Sawa]]:
* Jade, it's all about the jade! We need it, and that's the bottom line!
* This jade shortage is the worst thing to happen since the golden autumn crisis.  Production is already months behind.  The Serpent ain't getting any younger!
:{{gossip|''I've got your jade right here.''}}
: {{text|say|Unbelievable!  You've just saved my neck, <name>.  Oh ho, and just look at this luster.}}

On the other side of the statue is [[Kitemaster Shoku]]:
: Need a lift?
:{{gossip|''I've got a jade delivery for you.''}}
: {{text|say|It's about time we got another shipment.  I heard they were having trouble at the mines, but our work cannot wait.}}

Speak with him again:
:{{gossip|''I need a ride to the top of the statue.''}}

A kite will take players up to the top of the statue. Speak with [[Taskmaster Emi]]:
* Take a moment and look at the statue.  This marvel is the culmination of a hundred years of labor.
* Our work here has been steady and tedious, but the statue is almost complete.
* Soon, very soon, it will all pay off.
:{{gossip|''Did someone say they needed jade?''}}
: {{text|say|Wonderful!  Just look at it!  A hundred years to produce this incredible monument for the Jade Serpent.  And now, you too have contributed to this masterpiece.}}

Speak with [[Kitemaster Inga]] to safely return to the bottom, then turn in to the foreman.
