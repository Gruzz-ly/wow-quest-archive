==Objectives==
Collect 100 Tiny Spider Eyes.
*[[Tiny Spider Eye]] x100

==Description==
As you near, your serpent opens its mouth and begins drooling. It looks quite hungry since you last left it.

From the way it whimpers and slaps its tail, you can tell it is not looking for just any treat, but a special favorite snack.

Your serpent loves to munch on tiny spider eyes, but this delicacy comes only from the Widowspawn spiders in the cave along the coast to the north.

Well, what's a rider to do? Your serpent is waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 XP
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
Your serpent perks up at your return.

==Completion==
Your serpent nudges your hand affectionately, then proceeds to devour the treats!

==Progression==
