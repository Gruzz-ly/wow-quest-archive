==Objectives==
[[File:Sha Harbinger.jpg|thumb|[[Sha Harbinger]].]]
Slay 15 Sha Haunts and 5 Sha Harbingers in [[Garrosh'ar Point]].
*[[Sha Haunt]] slain (15)
*[[Sha Harbinger]] slain (5)

==Description==
This whole place is going up in flames and the ''[[Skyfire]]'' is reporting that more of those... [[sha|shadows]] are crawling up out of the ground. We need to get our people out of here.

Clear a path through the base on your way north and head for the town. I will rendezvous with you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*122,100 [[XP]]
*+5 reputation with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
You have no idea what kind of consequences your actions may have here!

==Completion==
I am glad you took responsibility for your actions. Left unchecked, negative emotions can quickly overwhelm an individual here, just as they started to overwhelm the one you call "[[Rell Nightwind|Rell]]."

==Notes==
Pick up [[Envoy of the Alliance]] before heading out.

: {{text|say|Skyfire Marine|Give 'em hell for us, <name>!  Whatever those things are...}}

Head back up the dock and start killing the sha. Watch out for the Sha Tendrils on the ground; Shadow damage taken is increased by 100%, movement speed reduced by 35%, but damage dealt is increased by 25%. The sha spawn quite quickly near the tendrils on the ground, so keep that in mind.

Once done, head north out of Garrosh'ar to [[Paw'don Village]] to find [[Taran Zhu]].

Exiting Garrosh'ar, Sully has managed to get the goblin shredder working and is now riding in it:
:{{text|say|[[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary]]|Good work in there, <name>! Get on to the village over the bridge. I'm covering extraction for the marines.}}
: {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Suck it down, freaks!!}}
: {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|I kinda like this thing.  What ye think, lads?  Can we keep it?}}
: {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|I even had time to install an [[Broken I.W.I.N. Button|I.W.I.N. Button]]!}}

On entering the village:
:{{Text|say|Paw'don Villager|Another stranger comes to our village... a <class> by the look of it. Enter, but do not draw your weapons against us as the Horde did.}}

;Approaching the mayor
:{{Text|say|Teng Applebloom|Mayor Khang, we must act quickly! Rally the city guards, at least!}}
:{{Text|say|Sunke Khang|Just a moment, Teng. We have... a visitor.}}

On completion of the quest, as Rell walks up to the three pandaren:
:{{Text|say|Taran Zhu|If it is war you mean to bring to our shores, the very land itself will respond to your passions and your violence. I do not know what the ultimate consequences will be - nobody does.}}

==Progression==
