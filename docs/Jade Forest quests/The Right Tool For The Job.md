==Objectives==
[[File:Ga'trul.jpg|thumb|[[Ga'trul]].]]
Use Sully's Flaregun to clear out the barricades and confront Ga'trul at the end of the dock.
*First Barricade Destroyed
*Second Barricade Destroyed
*[[Ga'trul]] Confronted
*[[Sully's Flaregun (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
I've scouted the area and found no leads on [[Anduin Wrynn|the prince]] or [[Admiral Taylor]]. We need to neutralize this base quickly and continue our search elsewhere.

Operations here are being led by an [[orc]] [[warlock]]: Ga'trul. He's barricaded the dock and is planning to escape through a demonic circle.

Put that flare gun to work again and blow those barricades! I'll cover your back and move in when you reach Ga'trul.

==Progress==
We will complete our mission, but right now our priority is that warlock!

==Completion==
We'll catch up with him again. I'm sure of it.

==Notes==
Immediately to Rell's left, to the east, is a dock with some barriers on it. Conveniently, a large pile of explosives is placed directly behind it. Get relatively close to the barricade, then use the flare gun to take it out. A [[Garrosh'ar Grunt]] will spawn behind it. Take it out, then repeat the process for the second barricade. Take a left and get to the end of the dock to confront Ga'trul.

Upon confronting Ga'trul:
:{{text|say|Ga'trul|By our sweat and your blood, this land WILL be ours!}}
:''Ga'trul teleports out. Rell runs in:''
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|A warlock! He couldn't have ported far - there must be another base.}}

When completing the quest, a cinematic plays:
:''Rell Nightwind talks to glowing communicator in his hand.''
:{{text|say|[[Sky Admiral Rogers]]|Nightwind, report! What's going on down there?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Rell Nightwind|No sign of the flagship, and no sign of Admiral Taylor or Prince Anduin.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Sky Admiral Rogers|[[Horde]] troops are swimming toward your position. Open fire at once.}}
:''Camera pans to [[Garrosh'ar Grunt]]s swimming from their sinking and burning ships.''
:{{text|bossemote|Rell Nightwind|Admiral - I think they mean to surrender. They're not armed - They're just trying not to drown!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Sky Admiral Rogers|You don't think they'll hesitate to strangle you with their bare hands? GUN THEM DOWN!}}
:''The [[Skyfire Marine]]s open fire on the grunts.''
:{{text|bossemote|Rell Nightwind|That's not right... this is a massacre... they were unarmed - ugh! I don't... I don't feel well...}}
:''Rell suddenly transforms and stands up; he's covered in inky black energy and his hands are twisted, clawed paws.  He speaks with a cold, cruel tone.''
:{{text|bossemote|Rell Nightwind|Maybe they deserved to die.}}
:''Out of nowhere, a [[pandaren]] appears and cleanses Rell of the [[Sha Haunt]] that transformed him.  The [[Alliance]] surrounds the pandaren.''
:{{text|bossemote|[[Taran Zhu]]|You beasts! What sort of madness is this?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Rell Nightwind|Men, stand down - this is one of the natives.}}
:''The cutscene concludes, but the script event continues. The player walks over to the north to a clear position of the two.''
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|We are from the Alliance, and mean you no harm. Tell me, what was that shadow you drew out of me?}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|This is not the place to explain. In short, your own doubts have been made manifest, as a consequence of your actions.}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|You don't understand - we're fighting a war here-}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Oh, I understand perfectly. I have eyes. But Pandaria is not like whatever land you came from; it lives and breathes. You should be careful what kind of energy you bring here. Now put those weapons away!}}
:''Taran Zhu walks off to the side of the dock, mounts his [[cloud serpent]] and flies off to the north.''
