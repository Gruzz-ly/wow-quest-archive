==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Windward Saber.jpg|Windward Saber|The king of the island.}}
Kill the Windward Saber.
*[[Windward Saber]] slain {{co|63.8|22.4|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
I have heard report of a great white beast that stalks the wood on the northwestern side of the wild serpent island.

This savage creature is mate to the Windward Huntress, and already he has taken down several of the adult cloud serpent matriarchs.

We cannot have such a fearsome predator roaming the island unchecked.

Go and deal with this creature. Let us see if your training has paid off.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}

*+600 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
How goes your hunt for the creature?

==Completion==
I see you have vanquished the beast. Quite a promising student, you are.

==Notes==
Fly up to the northern side of [[Windward Isle]]. In between two peaks at {{co|63.8|22.4|Jade Forest}} is the [[Windward Saber]]. A level 90 tiger with 787,000 health, it has the following abilities:
