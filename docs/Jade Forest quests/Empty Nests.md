==Objectives==
Leash and return 6 [[Windward Hatchling]]s to their nests.
*Windward Hatchlings returned to their nests (6)
*[[Silken Rope]] (provided)

==Description==
When the attacks began, the young hatchlings scattered in terror.

They are roaming around the island, lost and scared.

If you want to help, take this rope and leash the lost little ones. Take them back to their nests. Return them home.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 XP
* +1000 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
Did you return the hatchlings to their nests?

==Completion==
Don't worry. The hatchlings will be safe inside their nests.

I can't thank you enough for arriving when you did.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Beating the Odds]] and [[Egg Collection]] before heading out.

Head north away from Tong and circle clockwise to the northwest around the high bluff to reach the saurok camp, killing saurok and leashing cloud serpent hatchlings along the way. Once [[Slitherscale Ripper]]s are found, the eggs will also be nearby.
