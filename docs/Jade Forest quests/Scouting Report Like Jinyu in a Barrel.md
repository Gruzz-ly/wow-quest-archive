==Progress==
I'm not quite done yet, <name>.

==Completion==
The most important thing we learned was that... not only have the [[Alliance]] befriended the [[jinyu]], but they're giving them weapons, and teaching them how to use them.

The Alliance now control a force that outnumbers us thirty-to-one. And we - the [[Horde|HORDE]] - have befriended [[monkey]]s.

==Notes==

:{{text|bossemote|We set up a small camp in the hills above [[Pearlfin Village|the jinyu village]].}}
:{{text|bossemote|With nobody to watch over our prisoner, I had to make sure he was... incapable of escaping.}}
:{{text|say|Young Alliance Soldier|Wha-?}}
:''Shokia whacks the soldier unconscious.''
:{{text|bossemote|I approached my sniper rifle and took aim at the jinyu village.}}
Walk over to the nearby mounted [[Sniper Rifle (Jade Forest)|sniper rifle]].
:{{text|bossemote|Kiryn had made it to the jinyu village. I spotted her lurking in some bushes on the village's edge.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Straining my eyes, I could just barely read her lips, as she said:}}
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|Shoot all the guards, so I can move ahead.}}
Aim the cursor for [[Pearlfin Poolwatcher|the guards]], then right-click them to kill them.
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|Nice work back there! One more time!}}
Kill more guards.
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|Let's see if my [[hozen]] poison works on jinyu! Try not to blow me up, Shokia!}}
:{{text|bossemote|The center of the jinyu village was clear. Just to be safe, Kiryn planted some explosive barrels for me to shoot.}}
Wait for Kiryn to plant [[Kiryn's Poison Barrel|the three barrels]], then shoot them to make them explode.

In case the barrels are targeted too quickly:
:{{Text|yell|Shademaster Kiryn|Gah!}}

;All barrels exploded
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|That'll teach the jinyu and the Alliance to mess with us! Let's get out of here!}}
:{{text|yell|Shademaster Kiryn|Shokia, they've spotted me! Give me cover!}}
:{{text|bossemote|The coast was clear. Kiryn began to make her escape.}}
:''Kiryn runs over the lake, but gets trapped in a net!''
:{{text|bossemote|Damn, another jinyu net! We were so close, too...}}
:{{text|bossemote|I sensed a commotion in the village's eastern island.}}
:''Out of nowhere, Riko appears, who is ready for some revenge on jinyu.''
:{{text|yell|Riko|I'M BACK, YOU DOOKERS!}}
Aim for the guards to kill them before they kill Riko first! When the guards are gone, Riko runs toward Kiryn.
:{{text|yell|Riko|I on way, Kiryn! And I don't care about you weird dead face!}}
:{{Text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|Riko...}}
Continue shooting the jinyu.
:{{text|say|Riko|Come on, Kiryn! Let's get the ook outta here!}}
After completing, [[Nazgrim]] comes to the location.
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|What's this? An Alliance boy? Here?}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Wait, I know your face, human. You are the son of [[Varian Wrynn]]!}}
:{{text|say|Young Alliance Soldier|Sir, I demand to be released to my father's custody!}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Hah! Make another demand, princeling, and I'll release your head from your shoulders!}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|[[Anduin Wrynn]]... a fitting reward for the trials we've endured! <name>, come, speak with me.}}

In case you interrupt controlling Shokia, speak with her again.
:{{Gossip|Let's hear the rest of your report, Shokia.}}
