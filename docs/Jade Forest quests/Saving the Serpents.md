==Objectives==
Collect 10 Rescued Serpents.
*[[Rescued Serpent]] (10)

==Description==
Those [[Oona tribe|Oona]] [[hozen]] have gone too far this time.

Do you know what they are doing with wild [[cloud serpent]]s? Captured hatchlings are forced to fight one another in the pits, for nothing more than the Oona's amusement.

Savages!

If the young hatchlings learn such aggressive behavior at a young age, they may become violent and corrupted adults. A malicious cloud serpent is not something we want to deal with.

We must save the hatchlings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
The [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]] has worked for centuries to make the cloud serpents into loyal companions. Our kindness brings out the best in these creatures.

Unfortunately, violence and anger can quickly turn them into destructive monsters.

==Completion==
Ah yes, these hatchlings look quite tired. They have been through a great ordeal, but thanks to you, they are safe now.
