== Objectives ==
Slay Corporal Jackson Silver, Morgus Grimhatchet, and Master Mechanic Cogswing and Gyro-Engineer Lavenderp.
* [[Master Engineer Cogswing]] and * [[Gyro-Mechanic Lavenderp]] slain
* [[Morgus Grimhatchet]] slain
* [[Corporal Jackson Silver]] slain

== Description ==
Scouting reports from the [[Strongarm Airstrip]] are in, and I've underlined a few high-priority targets for you.

Two gnomish mechanics have been keeping Alliance [[gyrocopter]]s in the air. Take out the mechanics, and the gyrocopters' numbers will dwindle.

A dwarven death knight wanders their perimeter. He's an adventurer like yourself - loosely allied and highly dangerous.

Finally, a name I recognize: Corporal Jackson Silver. He's a hero of the Alliance and a deadshot with a crossbow.

Good luck, <name>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
These aren't your normal kill targets, <name>. Be on guard.

== Completion ==
Blood and thunder, <name>. Blood and thunder.
