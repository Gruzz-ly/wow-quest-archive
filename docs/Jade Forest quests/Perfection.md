== Objectives ==
Peform 12 practice strikes in the Monastery Training Arena by following the leader's example.
* Practice Strikes completed (12)

== Description ==
Perfection can be achieved through repetition. Every single student in the training area below will eventually perfect his or her form... assuming they don't give up first. This is a fact.

I encourage you to join them, <name>. As an honorary guest of the monastery, you are not required to perform the requisite 10,000 daily strikes. Simply follow the leader's example for a few minutes.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110,000 XP

== Progress ==
I, too, once trained in this very arena. Times were simpler then.

== Completion ==
This isn't your first time fighting, is it? Your form isn't perfect, but it is certainly practiced.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Instructor Xann|Join the students in the block formation below. Then follow the leader, as they do.}}

Players enter the vehicle UI with four abilities:
*{{abilities|Punch|Punch|notes=Instant|cd=4.5 sec}}
*{{abilities|Kick|Kick!|notes=Instant|cd=4.5 sec}}
*{{abilities|Growl|Growl!|notes=Instant|cd=4.5 sec}}
*{{abilities|Stop Training|Cancel your current training session.|notes=Instant.}}

There is no messaging, but the animations for the leader and the other trainees is quite obvious as to what's a punch, a kick, and a roar.
