==Objectives==
Collect 8 Viscous Chlorophyll.
* [[Viscous Chlorophyll]] (8)

==Description==
These creatures are everywhere - and very hostile! We'll need to deal with them before any more [[Alliance]] show up.

This one's taken quite a beating, but I've still made some determinations about its anatomy.

With the proper reagents, I'll be able to fashion a poison that should be quite effective against this species. In fact, I'll just need to modify a bit of the poison I have with me.

Go and find me some viscous chlorophyll down by the water. Any semi-sentient flora should do.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|11|40|}}
* 13,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope you were successful. Our survival here may depend on it.

==Completion==
Oh yes, <name>. This will do nicely.

==Progression==
{{The Art of War}}

Collect 5 Viscous Chlorophyll from Lurching Blossoms in [[Serenity Falls]].

;Description
This one's taken quite a beating, but I'm still able to make some fascinating determinations about its anatomy.

I'm confident that with the proper combination of reagents, ​I'll​ be able to fashion a poison that should prove quite effective against this species. In fact, I'll just need to modify a bit of the poison I have with me.

See if you can find me some viscous chlorophyll anywhere nearby. Any semi-sentient flora should provide me what I need.
