==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Slitherscale Lizard-Lord.jpg|Slitherscale Lizard-Lord|A greater threat still awaits.}}
Kill the Slitherscale Lizard-Lord.
*[[Slitherscale Lizard-Lord]] slain {{co|69.7|31.3|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
The Slitherscale take orders from their leader, the Slitherscale Lizard-Lord. He can be found celebrating his victories on the southeastern corner of [[Windward Isle]].

If we can destroy this leader, we can deal their tribe a great blow.

Without their lord, the Slitherscale will think twice before attacking the gentle cloud serpents of the east.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}

*+600 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
A snake without a head cannot strike.

==Completion==
Wonderful! I knew you could triumph against the Slitherscale lord.

==Notes==
Head to the southeast side of [[Windward Isle]]. On a little bit of land away from the main saurok camp is the [[Slitherscale Lizard-Lord]], a saurok with the following abilities:
