== Objectives ==
Speak to Lorewalker Cho at the [[Circle of Stone]].
* Lorewalker Cho escorted to Circle of Stone

== Description ==
Just a moment, now. Allow me to gather my things.

Wouldn't want me to lose these notes now, would we? Especially after you risked life and limb for them!

There, all set. Let us be off, shall we?

I must say, I feel much safer traveling with you after seeing how you handled [[Bloodthirsty Saurok|that saurok]]!

==Completion==
I am most grateful for the knowledge my forebears have passed on to me.

I stand upon their shoulders.

==Notes==
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I have everything I need. Quickly, let's move on before they return!}}
:''Cho mounts a dragon turtle.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Enough about pandaren history. Let's talk about your people, traveler.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I've learned a great deal already just by watching you in action. You fight with the fervor of youth but the experience of an old veteran. You've seen a lifetime of warfare, haven't you?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Ah, this is a special place. My great grandparents called this part of the forest their home. Come, this will take only a moment.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|We [[Pandaren]] do not worship our ancestors, but we revere their memory and the wisdom that they have passed on to us.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|It was my Great Grandfather who first told me the tale of the [[mogu]] that I recently shared with you.}}
:''Visions of [[Lorewalker Chang|Lorewalkers Chang]], [[Lorewalker Chi Chi|Chi Chi]], [[Lorewalker Cheech|Cheech]], [[Lorewalker Chong|Chong]], and [[Lorewalker Lola|Lola]] appear.''
