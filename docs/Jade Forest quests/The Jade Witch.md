==Objectives==
Defeat the Jade Witch.
* Confront the [[Widow Greenpaw|Jade Witch]]

==Description==
The Jade Witch must still have [[Shin]].

I... I can't do it! I don't want to see the witch. Can you please go talk to her and see if she has Shin?

You're an adult, I don't think she would try to turn you into jade.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Jade Raccoon]]
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

==Completion==
Hurray! Thank you so much! Shin is saved and you beat up the old witch! And the best part is our parents were never told what we were up to. Hurray!

It looks like everybody who came back is trying to get rid of whatever jade they had. [[Toya]]'s been collecting it for some reason and said you should go chat with him.

==Notes==
After completing [[The Double Hozen Dare]] and [[Down Kitty!]], An offers this quest. Head to the [[Lair of the Jade Witch]] and speak with her:

:Well well, a young visitor.

:Have you come to pay your respects at the shrine of my [[Master Greenpaw|husband]]? He was a hero you know. A master of Jade crafting and fighting. He was to be remembered forever they said.

:Do you like my statues? I craft them with special care saving only the best to provide my husband company and protection.

:{{text|say|Widow Greenpaw|I believe I heard some young whipper snapper in my garden out back. Let's go look for him.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Greenpaw|Ah, here is the boy. Doesn't he look special? My late husband and I always wanted [[child]]ren.}}
:''Widow Greenpaw suddenly attacks!''
:{{text|say|Widow Greenpaw|You should join our family, preserved forever in jade.}}
:{{text|say|An Windfur|You will NOT turn my friends into stupid statues!}}
:{{text|say|Widow Greenpaw|Here kitty kitty.}}

On victory:
:{{text|say|An Windfur|Yay! Shin! You're alive!}}
:{{text|say|An Windfur|Thank you so much <name>! If you find me in [[Dawn's Blossom]] later I'll give you one of the things we stashed from our adventures.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|An Windfur|Toya's been looking for you. He's been collecting all our extra jade.}}
