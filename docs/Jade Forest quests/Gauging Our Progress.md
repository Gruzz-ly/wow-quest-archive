== Objectives ==
Check in with [[Shademaster Kiryn]], [[Rivett Clutchpop]], [[Shokia]], and [[Riko]].
* [[Shademaster Kiryn's Report]]
* [[Rivett Clutchpop's Report]]
* [[Shokia's Report]]
* [[Riko's Report]]

== Description ==
The time for war is at hand, <name>!

We've been training these natives non-stop since you left, and I believe they're as good as they're going to get.

See for yourself. Check in with the others and return with your findings.

We must rely on our enemy being somehow... even less prepared.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
How is our combat training coming along?

== Completion ==
At least they're confident.

That might count for something.
