On accept, players find themselves in Rell's shoes, all the way over in the [[Fox Grove]]:
:{{text|bossemote|We had traveled north through the forest for several hours.}}
:{{text|bossemote|We stopped when we found a strange fallen tree.}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|What do you suppose happened to this tree, Sully?}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Somethin' hit it, sir. Wasn't cut down, didn't fall on its own.}}
:{{text|say|Little Lu|What's that, over there? Some kind of bird?}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Naw, that's a plane. Wait... A PLANE!?}}
:{{text|yell|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|That's Amber an' [[Nimm Codejack|Nimm]]'s plane! They might be alive after all!}}
:''Sully runs towards the crash site of a gnomish [[bomber]].''
:{{text|say|Little Lu|Who are Amber and Nimm? Should we follow him?}}
:''Run after Sully.''
:{{text|yell|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|She's still breathin', sir! Get over here! Talk to 'er!}}
Speak with Amber:
:The... the monkeys... they attacked...
:I fought them off, but... they'll be back... with more...
:{{gossip|You did well, Agent Kearnen. Now save your energy... we'll fend them off.}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|Listen up, men! Prepare for a hozen ambush!}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|Little Lu, keep Amber alive! Sully, try and keep this plane from exploding on us!}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|I'll hold them off as long as I can!}}
:{{text|bossemote|I readied my swords for battle. [Strong Attack], [Stronger Attack], [Strongest Attack].}}

Rell has three abilities:
*{{abilities|Sure Strike|range=Melee|Strikees at an enemy, dealing Physical damage.|notes=Instant. Hits for 26-28000 Physical.|cd=0.85 sec}}
*{{abilities|Masterful Strike|range=Melee|Deals a large amount of Physical damage.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~83000 Physical.|cd=5 sec}}
*{{abilities|Twin Strike|range=Melee|Deals an incredible amount of Physical damage, knocking the target down.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~150000 Physical. Knockdown lasts for ~1 sec.|cd=15 sec}}
The only real tactic here is to use CDs as they come back up. Three elite {{NPC||Ambushing Hozen}} come out followed by {{NPC||General Rik-Rik}}, who has 1.5 million health.

Dispatch all of the enemies, then:
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|Sully, Little Lu, our plans have changed. We need to transport Amber back to the main camp.}}
:{{text|say|Amber Kearnen|That's not necessary. I'll be coming with you.}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Ye've gotta be kiddin' me! Yer nearly dead! Look at ye!}}
:{{text|say|Amber Kearnen|No, Sully. My injuries will heal. Right now, we need to find the White Pawn.}}
:{{text|say|Little Lu|What's the White Pawn? I thought we were talking about attacking the hozen.}}
When the event ends, speak to Rell again to continue.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Amber Kearnen|Rell, please... save your energy. Sully can tell <name> what happened next.}}
