==Objectives==
Collect 6 Applebloom Cider.
*[[:Applebloom Cider]] (6)

==Description==
Those "[[orc]]" things ransacked the brewery and made off with my family's finest barrels of cider.

I know there is a war out there, but I am not a brewer who will stand idly by while his prized vintage is chugged by undeserving lips.

The "[[Horde]]" will likely put up some resistance. Why don't you put that weapon to good use and help me recover my cider?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is that my husband with you? Did you recover the cider?

==Completion==
I see that you two have been busy. Thank you for recovering our kegs.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Teng Applebloom|Let us go! The barrels are out in the orchard.}}
:''Teng joins the party.''

Pick up [[Pillaging Peons]] and [[Critical Condition]] before heading out.

Head southwest to the [[Paw'don Glade]] and get started killing, looting, and collecting.

After each barrel collected, Teng has something to say:
:{{text|say|Teng Applebloom|Yes, that's the stuff! Our cider is prized throughout the [[Jade Forest]]. I hope I can carry them all.}}
:{{text|say|Teng Applebloom|[[Pandaria]] has not seen a full-scale war since [[Mists of Pandaria (lore)|the mists]] closed in. The [[Shado-Pan]] usually handle any trouble that crops up on the continent.}}
:{{text|say|Teng Applebloom|Oof... I do not know what to make of your kind. Why have you brought your war to our shores? Why do you fight against this... Horde?}}
:{{text|say|Teng Applebloom|[[Sunke Khang|Mayor Khang]] is so worried, he called the Shado-Pan to deal with your arrival. I still cannot believe {{NPC||Taran Zhu||Lord Taran Zhu}} is here!}}
:{{text|say|Teng Applebloom|We do not wish to enter your conflict. But I fear that when war is on the horizon, peace is not a choice.}}
:{{text|say|Teng Applebloom|Ah, such troubling thoughts. Our [[Emperor Shaohao|last emperor]] advised us not to live in the shadow of fear. Do you see now why we love to drink and celebrate?}}

Note that Lin is not in Paw'don Village, but instead southwest of the glade on a small island in the bay.
