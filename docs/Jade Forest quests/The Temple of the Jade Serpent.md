*Elder Sage Wind-Yi spoken to {{co|55.8|57.1|Jade Forest}}
*[[Scroll of Introduction]] (provided)

==Description==
You've done us a huge favor here, traveler.

Now that we have enough jade to complete the statue, we should send word of our progress to Yu'Lon{{Sic}}, the Jade Serpent.

When you arrive, speak to Elder Sage Wind-Yi outside the entrance to the Temple of the Jade Serpent.

If you wish to speed your journey, speak to Kitemaster Shoku.  I'm sure he can spare an extra kite for you.

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
You bring news from the [[Serpent's Spine]]?

<The Elder Sage patiently listens to your tale of what occurred at the [[Greenstone Quarry|Jade Mines]] and at [[Serpent's Heart|the large jade statue]].>

Thank you for coming all this way, stranger.  However, I cannot allow you to speak to the Jade Serpent right now.

The ancient one is very busy, and as you can see, is not here at the moment.

==Notes==
Speak to Shoku and choose the other option for a kite ride to the Jade Temple.
:{{gossip|Take me to the Temple of the Jade Serpent.}}

Elder Sage Wind-Yi is a few yards in front of where the kite lands.  But before speaking to her, interact with [[The Emperor's Burden - Part 3]], immediately to her right.

Speak with her:
:Welcome to the Temple of the Jade Serpent, stranger.  Our doors are open to all who seek knowledge.
:{{gossip|I have a message for the Jade Serpent.}}

A cutscene plays where the inside of the courtyard is shown of the temple proper, where [[Liu Flameheart|Priestess Liu Flameheart]] is training the [[Serpent Trainer]]s alongside their young [[Tamed Serpent]]s.  Above the massive doors further in, the view pans up to a breathtaking view of the temple's towers above.  The view comes down to a point half way up the stairs, at which the player then spawns.  Speak with Elder Sage Rain-Zhu to continue.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Fei|Hey, stranger!  Pssst!  Come over here!}}
