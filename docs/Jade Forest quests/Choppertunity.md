==Objectives==
Pick up [[Requisitioned Firework Launcher|Requisitioned Fireworks Launcher]]s in [[Strongarm Airstrip]], then use them on 12 Strongarm Gyrocopters.
* [[Strongarm Gyrocopter]] shot down (12)

==Description==
I spotted some shoulder-mounted rocket launchers on the way over here.

They mighta been fireworks. I dunno. I'm just going to assume that they were shoulder-mounted rocket launchers until I'm proven wrong.

Point is, in the arms of a skilled <class> like you, they could probably take down a chopper. If you find any lying around, try pointing them at those poorly-built gyrocopters.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
I hope those ding-dongs enjoyed the party you threw for them!

==Progression==
{{The Art of War}}
