==Objectives==
Use the Nectarbreeze Cider to put out 12 fires around [[Nectarbreeze Orchard]].
*Orchard Fires Put Out (12)
*[[Nectarbreeze Cider]] (provided)

==Description==
We've tended these orchards and made cider from their nectar for generations. In that time, we've learned a special trick for putting out fires in a pinch.

<Hanae pushes a jug of cider into your hand.>

The cider itself - when mixed with crushed gingerleeaf and saliva - quickly becomes sticky and viscous. Perfect for smothering flames.

Please, while you're out there, try to get the flames under control. I've already mixed the gingerleaf, just swing and spit.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Best not to judge our prized cider by its flavor in this state.

==Completion==
A survivor came in moments ago and said the flames are beginning to die down.

We owe our very way of life to you, stranger. I cannot possibly reward you adequately, but please take this.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Defiance]], [[Rally the Survivors]], and [[Orchard-Supplied Hardware]] before heading out. Raiders are in town, incinerators are further away. Tools are out on the ground in the trees.
