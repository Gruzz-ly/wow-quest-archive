==Objectives==
[[File:Windward Tiger.jpg|thumb|[[Windward Tiger]].]]
[[File:Windward Alpha.jpg|thumb|[[Windward Alpha]].]]
Kill 8 [[Windward Tiger]]s or [[Windward Alpha]]s.
*Windward Tiger slain (8)

==Description==
The past few seasons have been plentiful, and as a result, the wild tiger population on [[Windward Isle]] has exploded.

The savage creatures have hunted out all the nearby game, and are beginning to encroach upon the cloud serpent nests.

As a result, as the tigers thrive, the cloud serpents decline.

If we are not careful, the predatory cats could completely wipe them out.

We must thin the tigers' numbers, <race>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
If we let nature take its course too often, we may lose great treasures.

==Completion==
You have carried out the task to the letter, <name>.

==Notes==
Fly to the northwest side of [[Windward Isle]] and get cracking. Note that the [[Windward Saber]] for [[On The Prowl]] counts too.

==Progression==
{{Cloud Serpent dailies}}

==Patch changes==
