==Objectives==
[[File:Twinspire Deathguard.jpg|thumb|[[Twinspire Deathguard]].]]
[[File:Twinspire Demolitionist.jpg|thumb|[[Twinspire Demolitionist]].]]
Slay 15 Horde troops in [[Twinspire Keep]].
*Twinspire Horde slain (15)

==Description==
I do not trust this [[Horde]]. They wield foul magic, and their intentions are clearly malevolent. We can no longer stand their presence in Twinspire Keep, so close to [[Paw'don Village|Paw'don]].

I beg you, visitor: thin their numbers before they do something awful to this village.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Gol' dang, but there's a bunch of 'em down there...

==Completion==
One heck of a bloody mess y'made down there, kid.

Nice work.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fractured Forces]], [[Smoke Before Fire]], and [[Unfair Trade]] before heading out.

Take the northwest exit out of [[Paw'don Village]], along the north side of [[Paw'don Glade]] to reach [[Twinspire Keep]]. Get started killing goblins, orcs and Forsaken. Also, kill the [[Eye of Ga'trul|Eyes of Ga'trul]] guarding the pandaren cubs. The four targets of interest are on the lower level, and the two named commanders are on the upper level.

As is Sully.

Kill: [[Fixxul Lonelyheart]], [[Gatrul'lon Flamecaller]]s, [[Felstorm Warlock]]s, [[Twinspire Deathguard]]s, [[Gatrul'lon Curseweaver]]s, [[Twinspire Grunt]]s, [[Felstorm Summoner]]s, and [[Twinspire Demolitionist]]s.

==Progression==
{{Paw'don Village}}
