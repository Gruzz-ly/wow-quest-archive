==Objectives==
Use Sully's Flaregun to destroy 5 Horde War Wagons.
* [[Horde War Wagon]] destroyed (5)
* [[Sully's Flaregun]] (provided)

==Description==
Did you see the size of those war wagons? They're packing so many [[explosive]]s, I cannae tell if the [[Horde]] is here to take over this continent or just blow it out of the sea!

We need to neutralize those wagons before they leave [[Garrosh'ar Point]].

Here, take me pocket flares. Fire 'em into a wagon and watch the fireworks!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*122,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did "The Pickle" send you with a mission?

==Completion==
With those wagons out of comission, we can turn our attention to the commander.

==Notes==
Pick up [[No Plan Survives Contact with the Enemy]] before heading out.

War Wagons are all over the area. Get within 20-30 yards of one and use the flare to automatically destroy it.
