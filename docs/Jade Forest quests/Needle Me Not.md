==Objectives==
Use the honey at the northern clearing in [[Arboretum|The Arboretum]], and then kill the Orchard Needler.
*[[Orchard Needler]] slain {{co|57.0|41.5|Jade Forest}}
*[[Golden Honey]] (provided)

==Description==
The Arboretum is our home, a safe haven where we raise young hatchlings and train our students.

Unfortunately, there are other, more dangerous creatures who wish to make this their home as well.

To the north, beyond the river, we have seen a great wasp feeding on the nectar blossoms.

This creature has already stung several of our students.

Use this honey to lure the wasp out of hiding. Then, destroy it before it harms anyone else.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +600 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
The nectar attracts many unsavory creatures.

==Completion==
The poisonous wasp is dead? Good. Where so many other students failed, you have succeeded, <name>.

==Notes==
Head northeast along the cliff edge and cross the creek. A huge wasp nest and several smaller ones are hanging from a tree. Use the [[Golden Honey]] there to summon the Orchard Needler:
