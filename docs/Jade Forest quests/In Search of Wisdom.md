==Objectives==
[[File:Toya.jpg|thumb|[[Toya]].]]
[[File:Curious Cub.jpg|thumb|[[Curious Cub]].]]
Speak to Kitemaster [[Ut-Nam]] and get a ride to [[Dawn's Blossom]].
*Speak to Kitemaster Ut-Nam {{co|57.9|82.5|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
[[Lorewalker Cho]] came by and asked for you while you were gone.

He needs your assistance urgently in the town of Dawn's Blossom to the north. For what reason, he did not say.

Speak to Kitemaster Ut-Nam. He would be happy to send you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|90}}
*55000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ah!  You made it.  Fantastic!

==Completion==
Your deeds have sparked a long forgotten memory I have of an ancient prophecy.  This deserves investigation.

In order to investigate, I need jade though. I have instructed [[Toya]] to gather as much as he can find and give it to you when he is done. Bring it to me and we will see about deciphering the ancient "[[Emperor's Omen]]."

While he gathers the jade, feel free to explore. You may find the people of this town are in need of a person of your caliber.

==Notes==
Exit Lusshan's position and turn right at the bottom of the ramp. The Kitemaster is marked on the minimap, at the western edge of the island.
