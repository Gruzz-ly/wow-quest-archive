==Objectives==
[[File:Waxwood Matriarch.jpg|thumb|[[Waxwood Matriarch]].]]
Slay 6 [[Waxwood]] tigers.
*[[Waxwood Hunter]] slain (6)

==Description==
Might I ask a favor of you, trainee <name>?

Before I came to the monastery, I was a stranger to battle. During my time as a trainee, I performed adequately, but I was never placed in any real danger. Now, as a graduate and a wage-earning guard, I am expected to protect this perimeter at all costs.

I can handle [[Greenwood Trickster|greenwood sprites]], but the tigers in the western Waxwood are something different altogether. Would you mind taking care of them for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please, do not speak of our arrangement with others. My cowardice shames me.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. A thousand times, thank you.

==Notes==
Heading out from the monastery for [[Groundskeeper Wu]]'s quests, adventurers pass Guard Shan Long, who offers this quest. Pick it up and kill tigers while doing everything else Wu wants.

Quickly turn north in the Waxwood to reach Mother Wu's house and pick up a Boiling Cauldron:
:{{text|say|Mother Wu|Did my son send you? There's plenty of stew to go around. Please, help yourself.}}
Interact with a Boiling Cauldron to start dragging it along. Greenwood Tricksters are attracted by the smell, so take this opportunity to kill them. It moves at run speed, so stay off mounts. Make it back to Wu:
:{{text|say|Groundskeeper Wu|<Name>, you have no idea how glad I am to see you. Supervising is hungry work.}}
Head back out and complete the other quests. The tricksters are closer to the monastary, while the bushleaf and tigers are further away. Blushleaf can be gathered in groups of up to ~15.

The title of this quest is a reference to the poem ''[[wikipedia:The Tyger|The Tyger]]'' by William Blake, more specifically its first line ("Tyger, tyger, burning bright").
