==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Instructor Windblade|Your serpent will arrive in just a moment. Good luck!}}

When the serpent flies up, hop on. It acts just like a regular flying mount, so fly through any six smoke rings out over the water, then return to Windblade. Get off of the serpent in order to turn in.
