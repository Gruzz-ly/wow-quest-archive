==Objectives==
Use the Bouncy Ball. Then, catch and return the ball to your hatchling 8 times.
*Balls caught (8)
*[[Bouncy Ball]] (provided)

==Description==
<The hatchling looks up at you with a bored, listless expression.>

You have a feeling the serpent is tired of being cooped up all day.

How about playing a little game of catch?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
<The serpent watches you curiously.>

==Completion==
Oh my, I see you and your serpent are having a great time! Well done, <name>. Playtime will greatly increase your serpent's mental and physical acuities.

==Notes==
Use the ball to throw it. The serpent will chase after it and bounce it back in the air. A huge shadow will appear on the ground where it will land. Get there before the ball (it moves slower than run speed) and volley it enough times to complete the quest. The serpent will emote:
*{{text|emote|Don't worry, your hatchling's got it!}}
*{{text|emote|Your hatchling chases after the ball!}}
*{{text|emote|Your hatchling wants to catch this one!}}
