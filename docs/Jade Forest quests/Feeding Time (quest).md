==Objectives==
Collect 3 Saltback Meat and feed them to your hatchling companion.
*Hatchling fed (3)

==Description==
<The serpent darts forward and bites your fingers.>

Ouch! It seems, without a doubt, that the little beast is hungry. You recall that some meaty-looking turtles can be found on the [[Windward Isle|wild cloud serpent island]] to the northeast.

Perhaps some turtle meat will fill the hatchling's voracious appetite.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
<The serpent looks at you with hungry eyes.> 

==Completion==
You are learning well, young trainer. Saltback meat is tough, but loaded with the nutrients that a young hatchling needs to grow.
