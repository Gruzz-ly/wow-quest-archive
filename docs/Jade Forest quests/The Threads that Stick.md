==Objectives==
[[File:Silk Patch.jpg|thumb|Silk Patch]]
Gather 7 Pristine Silk Strands.
*[[Pristine Silk Strand]] (7)

==Description==
Ah, welcome traveler. I have need of your services!

[[Syra Goldendraft]] was looking for some silk. Personally I hate silk as it always gets stuck in my fur.

I really want to impress her though.

If you bring me some silk from the [[Silkwood]] to the west of here I will gladly pay you for your help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the Silkwood?

==Completion==
Oh thank you so much! This is perfect!

I hope it didn't stick to you like it stuck to me.

I'm going to go find Syra and give this to her right away!

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Double Hozen Dare]] and [[The Silkwood Road]] before heading out. Exit town to the south and take the first right. Silk caches are near trees and spiders are everywhere. Keep heading west in the Silkwood to reach the Central Bamboo Forest. An Windfur will join the party and offer [[Down Kitty!]]. Kill tigers and talk to pandaren. Complete both her quests and pick up [[The Jade Witch]]. Kill the Jade Witch, then return to [[Dawn's Blossom]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|[[Kai Wanderbrew]]|Lo! We are leaving. Where did you get off to?}}
:{{text|say|Lo Wanderbrew|I need to find Syra!}}
Kai Wanderbrew has appeared and offers [[Find the Boy]], which continues Lo's story.
