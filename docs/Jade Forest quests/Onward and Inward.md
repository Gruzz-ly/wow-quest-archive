== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Sky Admiral Rogers||Admiral Rogers}} at [[Paw'don Village]] in the [[Jade Forest]].
*Return to Paw'don Village

== Description ==
"Sha" energy, hm? Tread carefully, <name> - there's a hidden darkness to this continent.

We'll stay behind to mop up the rest of the Horde, but we need you to continue with the main mission: the rescue of {{NPC||Taylor||Captain Taylor}}, and the retrieval of {{NPC||Anduin Wrynn||Prince Anduin}}.

Our aerial scouts think we've found the wreckage of the flagship near Paw'don village. Go there and report to Admiral Rogers for instructions.

You are welcome to use my gyrocopter.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
Excellent work, <class>. I can see why you came so highly recommended.

== Notes ==
Immediately outside the keep interior is {{NPC||Rell's Gyrocopter}}. Hop in for a quick lift back to town. {{NPC||Xhu'daggab}} spots you leaving, and will blow the gyro out of the sky:
:{{Text|yell|Xhu'daggab|DESTROY...}}
Thankfully, the gyro is equipped with a parachute and the adventurer will land safely back in town. Take care of any business, then head southwest across the bridge to the western side of the village, where Rogers is speaking with {{NPC||Taran Zhu}} and {{NPC||Sunke Khang}}.

This completes the Paw'don Village requirement of [[Upjade Complete]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Thank you for your hospitality, Mayor.  I assure you: you're doing the right thing.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|You may give these soldiers quarter at your discretion, but we are not choosing sides.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|This conflict is little more than a race-war.  Their hatreds would engulf this land - we will have no part in this!}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|I must go - there are others who have landed on our northern shores.}}
:''Taran Zhu mounts his cloud serpent and peels off to the north.''
