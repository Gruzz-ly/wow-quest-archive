Check in with [[Bold Karasshi]], [[Amber Kearnen]], and [[Mishka]].
*Challenge a [[Pearlfin Recruit]]
*Defeat the [[Hozen Brawler|Captive Hozen]] {{co|54.7|80.1|Jade Forest}}
*Assist the [[Wounded Pearlfin]] (3)

==Description==
Welcome back, <name>! It seems the jinyu have taken to our training even better than I had hoped. We're in the final stages of our preparations now.

I need someone to go check in with Amber, Bold Karasshi, and Mishka. See if they need any help to complete their training.

You'll find Karasshi and Mishka here in [[Pearlfin Village]]. Amber is training recruits in [[Slingtail Pits]] to the northwest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is everyone in order and ready to move?

==Completion==
Impressive work, <name>. We should be ready to move out shortly. With our allies at our side, there is no way we can be defeated.

==Notes==
Pick up [[An Unexpected Advantage]] before going too far.

Not far to the south of [[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary]] is [[Bold Karasshi]], at {{co|59.3|83.4|Jade Forest}} standing in front of the inn. Speak with him:
* We are friends now, <name>.  You are welcome to our village any time you wish to return.
* Someday, perhaps you will show me your home.  It must be very different than ours.
* We owe you a great debt, <race>.
* Are you finding everything well, name>?
* Your name will be spoken in our village for many years to come.
* May your waters never run dry.

:{{gossip|What can I do to help?}}
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|See if the new recruits are up to a challenge.  They could use a lesson in advanced combat.}}

Find a [[Pearlfin Recruit]] and speak with it:
* Will you test my skills?
* Training is an ongoing process.  There is always something to learn.
* I must be in top fighting condition when we face the Hozen in battle.

:{{gossip|Let's see what you've got.}}

Defeat it:
* {{text|say|Pearlfin Recruit|One can only grow from their defeats.}}
* {{text|say|Pearlfin Recruit|I will be better prepared the next time we meet!}}
* {{text|say|Pearlfin Recruit|It has been an honor to train with you.}}

Keep heading south to find [[Mishka]] at {{co|59.9|86.4|Jade Forest}} between the two halves of Pearlfin:
:Being resourceful can often sway a battle in your favor.

:I've put together this remedy using plants from the forest around us. Hopefully it will be enough. We need every available fighter in the field.

:{{gossip|What can I do to help?}}
:{{text|say|Mishka|Any assistance getting the wounded back on their feet would be appreciated.}}

Interact with {{NPC||Wounded Pearlfin}} south of her:
*{{text|say|Wounded Pearlfin|Thank you, traveler. I think I can make it now.}}
*{{text|say|Wounded Pearlfin|A simple flesh wound won't keep me from the battle.}}
*{{text|say|Wounded Pearlfin|You have my gratitude. I should return back to training now.}}

Finally, head north to the [[Slingtail Pits]]. At the big pit is a [[Hozen Brawler]] locked in a Re-Inforced Jinyu Cage. Opposite it at {{co|54.8|79.7|Jade Forest}} is Amber Kearnen and Little Lu. Talk to Amber:
:Winning any battle is just as much about understanding your opponent, as it is knowing how to fight.

:{{gossip|What can I do to help?}}
:{{text|say|Amber Kearnen|Let's see what the Hozen have in store for us in combat.}}
:''The Hozen Brawler is released into the pit.''

The Bralwer is an 85 elite with 237,000 health and the following special ability:
*{{abilities|Grookin'|range=30|Konk charges at an enemy and spins wildly, inflicting Physical damage to all nearby enemies periodically.|notes=1.5 sec cast. Starts a channel, triggering...}}
**{{abilities|Grookin'|Konk Charges at an enemy and spins wildly, inflicting Physical damage to all nearby enemies periodically.|notes=Channeled.|cd=7 sec}}

Aggro:
*{{text|say|Hozen Brawler|Ookin' dooker!}}
*{{text|say|Hozen Brawler|Ook off, you big dookers!}}

Kill it:
:{{text|say|Amber Kearnen|Good work! Dealing with the Hozen will be easier than I had anticipated.}}

Return to Taylor.
