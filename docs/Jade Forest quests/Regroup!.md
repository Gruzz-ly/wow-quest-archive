==Objectives==
Rescue Shademaster Kiryn, Rivett Clutchpop, Shokia, and Sergeant Gorrok from [[Honeydew Glade]].
*[[Shademaster Kiryn]] Rescued
*[[Rivett Clutchpop]] Rescued
*[[Sergeant Gorrok]] Rescued
*[[Shokia]] Rescued

==Description==
They have a secret airbase! I have underestimated this Alliance Captain for the last time. So many good warriors lost...

There must have been a few survivors who were able to bail during the crash. We need every able-bodied fighter we can get.

Find as many survivors as you can in the forest below, and I will investigate the wreckage itself. Rally everyone together at the nearby village for a counter-attack.
