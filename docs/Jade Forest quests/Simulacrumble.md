==Objectives==
[[File:Shattered Destroyer.jpg|thumb|[[Shattered Destroyer]].]]
[[File:Vacant Destroyer.jpg|thumb|[[Vacant Destroyer]].]]
Kick 6 Vacant Destroyers in the [[Terrace of Ten Thunders]].
*[[Vacant Destroyer]] Kicked (6)

==Description==
<The shattered remains of a ancient [[mogu]] statue.  This one looks like it never animated before it was broken.

Whatever dark magic the mogu are employing here, it seems to make the brittle statues significantly tougher. Better to destroy them while they are still vacant.

A good old-fashioned kick should do the job.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The statues topple and shatter with ease; a testament to the immense weight of the spirit.>

==Notes==
After completing The Sprites' Plight, the head of a shattered destroyer near the south end of the ruins offers this quest. Pick it up before getting started on [[Break the Cycle]].
