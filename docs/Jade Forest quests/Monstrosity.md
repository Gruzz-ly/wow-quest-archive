==Objectives==
Collect sketches of each piece of the ancient statue.
* [[Ancient Statue Torso|Statue Torso]] Sketched
* [[Ancient Statue Arm|Statue Arm]] Sketched
* [[Ancient Statue Shoulder|Statue Shoulder]] Sketched
* [[Ancient Statue Head|Statue Head]] Sketched

==Description==
It's plain to see that this statue and the surrounding ruins are of ancient origin. Clearly, this land has a deep history, which means it could not have been born of the [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]].

And yet these waters have been explored for ages now, with no record of anything here but open sea.

Perhaps if you were to sketch the pieces of this broken statue, you might shed light on the [[Pandaria|continent]]'s origins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*[[XP]]

==Completion==

As you look over your sketch, you can't help but hope that these creatures don't really exist.

==Notes==
;Ancient Statue Torso
:Fortunately, you can still make out enough detail to sketch what looks to be a creature's torso.

:{{Gossip|<Create a sketch of the statue piece.>}}

;Ancient Statue Arm
:This portion of the statue tells you little, other than the subject actually had arms...

:{{Gossip|<Create a sketch of the statue piece.>}}

;Ancient Statue Shoulder
:The statue's shoulder looks quite imposing in relation to the rest of its features. The subject was clearly a mighty creature!

:Perhaps it's a good nature sort. Or if not, then maybe it's extinct!

:One can hope...

;Ancient Statue Head
:Maybe that's just a big scary mask on its face...
