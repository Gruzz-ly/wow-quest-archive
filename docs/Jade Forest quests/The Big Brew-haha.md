==Objectives==
Collect 100 Sri-La Stout.
*[[Stolen Sri-La Stout]] (100)

==Description==
It's a disaster, <name>!

When I went to visit the [[The Dancing Serpent|Dancing Serpent Inn]] yesterday, they were all out of brew.  They said the shipment from [[Sri-La Village]] had been stolen. STOLEN!

Turns out those Oona hozen have been making all kinds of trouble down at the docks, including taking all the brew to their cave at [[Oona Kagu]] along the coast.

I can't handle a dry spell.  A life without brew is not a life worth living!

Someone needs to go and save the brew!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
Is the brew recovered yet?  I'm... I'm starting to lose it...

==Completion==
Oh, thank the Stormstouts!  You are my hero!
