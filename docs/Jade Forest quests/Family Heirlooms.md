==Objectives==
Collect 8 Pearlfin Heirlooms from dead Pearlfin Villagers in [[Moonwater Retreat]].
*[[Glassfin Heirloom]] (8)

==Description==
We recently lost a fierce battle against the [[hozen]] at Moonwater Retreat.

We evacuated as many of our people as we could, but still, there were many we could not save.

We have no tokens of our lost over which to send our prayers.

If someone could go and retrieve heirlooms from the dead bodies, we could properly lay them to rest, and move on.

It would mean so much to us if you could do this, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]
*+2500 [[reputation]] with [[Pearlfin Jinyu]]

==Progress==
We still grieve for our fallen brothers.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You do not know how much this means to the families of the lost.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Elder's Instruments]] before heading out. Down to the southeast, follow the path up the hill to Moonwater Retreat. Keep killing pillagers until all four items have been found, and keep looting villagers until enough heirlooms have been found.

==Progression==
{{Spirits of the Water}}
