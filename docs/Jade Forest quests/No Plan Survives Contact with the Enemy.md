== Objectives ==
[[File:Garrosh'ar Grunt.jpg|thumb|[[Garrosh'ar Grunt]].]]
[[File:Garrosh'ar Gear-Greaser.jpg|thumb|[[Garrosh'ar Gear-Greaser]].]]
Kill 6 Garrosh'ar Grunts and 6 Garrosh'ar Gear-Greasers.
* [[Garrosh'ar Grunt]] slain (6)
* [[Garrosh'ar Gear-Greaser]] slain (6)

==Description==
Quickly and quietly; that's how [[SI:7]] prefers to operate. That was the plan, at least.

[[Rell Nightwind]] is already inside [[Garrosh'ar Point]] looking for signs of [[Anduin]] and [[Taylor]], but it's getting hot in there and he needs support.

Fight yer way through these dogs and find Rell!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*122,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This place is crawling with Horde soldiers - we can't advance on their leader with so many at our backs.

==Completion==
Great work! If you ever decide to give up your life of adventure, the SI: 7 could use more talent like you...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Welcome Wagons]] before heading out.

Orcish grunts and goblin gear-greasers are all over the area.

==Progression==
{{Paw'don Village}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
