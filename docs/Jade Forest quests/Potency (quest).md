''The dream brew that you sampled earlier can expand your consciousness and show you events transpiring around the land.  I will teach you how to use it properly, and we will find your prince!''

''But first, help me to create a fresh batch.''

==Objectives==
[[File:Mist Horror.jpg|thumb|[[Mist Horror]].]]
Kill Mist Creepers until a [[Mist Horror]] appears, then collect a Mist Horror Heart.
*[[Mist Creeper]] slain (8)
*[[Mist Horror Heart]]

==Description==
To make the Dream Brew, we will need several ingredients.

First, to improvve its strength, I will need an ingredient from a fearsome creature, the legendary Mist Horror.

It is said that this creature only appears where the fog is deepest.

North and east of here, you will find the smaller Mist Creepers raoming the swamps. Kill these creatures until the Mist Horror appears, and then bring me its heart.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The mists seem to have a mind of their own, do they not?

==Completion==
This is an amazing specimen! I am quite shocked that you have succeeded, actually.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Body]] and [[Hue]] before heading out. Into the [[Amberfly Bog]] to kill [[mistlurker]]s, [[crocolisk]]s, and [[wasp]]s. Don't forget to use the skinning knife on the amberflies!

First kill:
:{{text|bossemote|The mist senses your presence!}}

Second:
:{{text|bossemote|Mist gathers around you.}}

Fourth:
:{{text|bossemote|All around you, the mist grows denser.}}

Sixth:
:{{text|bossemote|The mist envelops you in its grip!}}

On the eighth kill, the Bog Horror will appear!
:{{text|bossemote|Out of the mist, a creature emerges!}}
:{{text|yell|Mist Horror|You cannot...escape!}}

The [[Mist Horror]] is a level 85 [[mistlurker]] with 158,000 health and one special ability:
*{{abilities|Swamp Gas|Breathes a foul gas, inflicting Nature damage to all enemies in front of the caster every second for 5 sec.|notes=1 sec cast. Starts a channel, which triggers every second:}}
**{{abilities|Swamp Gas|Inflicts Nature damage every second.|notes=Instant. Ticks for 2631 Nature every second}}
