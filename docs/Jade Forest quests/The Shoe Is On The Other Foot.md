==Objectives==
[[File:Stolen Boots.jpg|thumb|Stolen Boots.]]
[[File:Shadowfae Trickster.jpg|thumb|[[Shadowfae Trickster]].]]
Re-steal 14 Stolen Boots.
*[[Stolen Boots]] (14)

==Description==
I loathe [[sprite]]s! One time, one of those nasty buggers followed me all day, putting dirt in my tea and bugs in my hair.

I mean, who does that!?

Well, I think it's time for a little payback. Do you know what the sprites up at [[Windward Isle]] love more than anything in the world?

Yeah, you guessed it. Shoes!

And we're going to steal them. Won't that make them mad! Hah!

Well, I'm scared to go near sprites, so you'll have to do it, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
Did you see the looks on their faces? Were they mad?

==Completion==
I see you and [[Ningna Darkwheel|Ningna]] have been up to some mischief. Unfortunately, this type of behavior is not condoned by the Order--

Wait, where did you find those shoes? I've been looking for that pair of moleskin riding boots for ages!

Well... I suppose I will let this slide... this time. Hmph.

==Notes==
Fly to the northwest side of [[Windward Isle]]. Shoes are most likely guarded by weak [[Shadowfae Trickster]]s, so be warned when looting.
