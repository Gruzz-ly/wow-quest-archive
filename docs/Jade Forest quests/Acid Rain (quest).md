==Objectives==
Using the [[Recovered Gyrocopter]], kill 50 Hozen Gutrippers and 50 Hozen Nibstabbers.
* [[Hozen Gutripper]] slain (50)
* [[Hozen Nibstabber]] slain (50)

==Description==
Since you've been gone, more and more of these creatures are approaching our camp. They appear to be amassing for a major assault!

We're going to have to take some drastic measures if we hope to see tomorrow.

Here, take my poisoned throwing stars and figure out a way to thin out their numbers.
