Listen to Riko's report.
* Listen to [[Riko]]'s report

==Description==
We weren't only looking for [[Alliance]], you know. We were also looking for those snooked-up, tik-flikklin' [[jinyu]]!

Well, we found 'em all right...

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*[[XP]]
*[[Money]]

==Progress==
Riko wishes you were a bit more patient, <name>.

==Completion==
Yeah, I ran away. So blikkin' what? If it weren't for me, [[Kiryn]] would be dead. Oh, wait... she's already dead... already...

Go away! Riko's head hurts.

==Notes==
In [[Fox Grove]]...

:{{text|bossemote|We kept goin' south, until Shokia started whinin' about somethin'.}}
:{{text|say|Shokia|Look, up ahead - an Alliance [[bomber]]!}}
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|I see it, Shokia. I'll go take a look.}}
:''Kiryn goes into stealth and moves in the direction of the bomber.''
:{{text|bossemote|Shokia watched [[Young Alliance Soldier|the prisoner]] while Kiryn went ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Shokia|Don't you dare follow her, Riko. I don't want you messing things up again.}}
:{{text|say|Riko|No, you tik-jooglin' orc! Riko done following you stupid orders!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Maybe Riko lost his temper a little bit.}}
:{{text|yell|Riko|You nothin' but a blikk-jeekin' dikkety dook-manker with an ook for a head!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Yelling at Shokia wasn't doing nothin'. Riko decided to follow Kiryn.}}
:{{text|yell|Shademaster Kiryn|Wha- Help! Help, Shokia! Riko!}}
:{{text|bossemote|All of a sudden, I heard a noise. Kiryn was trapped! In jinyu nets!}}
:{{text|yell|Riko|I save you, Kiryn!}}
Move toward the bomber and talk to Kiryn in the net.
:If the jinyu set this trap, they'll be back soon.
:<Kiryn looks up at the horizon in shock.>
:[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]] watch over us... they're here. Save yourself, Riko!
:{{gossip|Never! Riko protect you to death!}}
:{{text|say|Riko|Alright! It's time to kill some skreekin' jinyu!}}
:{{text|yell|Riko|COME AT ME, BROKKERS!}}
:{{text|bossemote|I cracked my knuckles and got ready for a fight.}}
Use Uppercut to gain distance to the [[Ambushing Jinyu|jinyu]], then use Fling Filth while they're away from you. Keep moving to keep the distance away from them.
:''After killing a few jinyu, an [[Alliance Scout]] appears and fights Riko.''
:{{text|yell|Alliance Scout|Get away from our plane, hozen scum!}}
:{{text|say|Riko|Alliance and jinyu... fight side by side?}}
:{{text|bossemote|When I done fightin', went up to Kiryn to ask for my... reward.}}
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|Riko, you... you saved my life.}}
:{{text|say|Riko|So... uh... can Riko get a kiss?}}
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|Of course. let me just take off my mask...}}
:''Kiryn takes off her mask and shows her [[undead]] face.
:{{text|yell|Riko|WHAT THE OOK IS WRONG WITH YOUR FACE? YOU'RE... YOU'RE JEEKIN' DEAD?}}
:{{text|yell|Riko|AHHHHHH!}}
:''Riko runs away from the scene.''
On completion:
:{{text|say|Shokia|The important thing is that these jinyu and Alliance have joined forces. Come speak with me, <name>. I can give you the final part of our report.}}

In case you interrupt controlling Riko, speak with him again.
:{{Gossip|Go on, Riko.}}
