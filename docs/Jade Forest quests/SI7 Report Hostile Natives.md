==Notes==
Accept the quest to start Little Lu's story. They are out front of the [[Lair of the Jade Witch]]:
:{{text|bossemote|Rell survived the attack, but he wasn't doing very well.}}
:{{text|say|Amber Kearnen|Rell's condition is worsening. We must stop to rest again.}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|If only Mishka were here. She'd fix him up in no time.}}
:''Little Lu runs closer to the sign.''
:{{text|say|Little Lu|Fellow agents! This is a [[pandaren]] hut. The pandaren are allies.}}
:{{text|say|Amber Kearnen|Good thinking, Little Lu. Go find out who lives here. Take Sully with you.}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|And [[Socks]]!}}
:{{text|say|Amber Kearnen|Yes... and the raccoon. I will watch over our commander.}}

Turn around. A few yards from where Little Lu is standing is a sign: "STAY OUT - NO VISITORS".
:{{text|bossemote|The sign out front was not very... welcoming.}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Pshh! No sign is gonna stop me an' my best pal Socks!}}

Keep heading closer to the hut and stop to inspect the surprisingly lifelike jade statues.
:{{text|bossemote|The lawn was littered with small jade statues.  They seemed almost... lifelike.}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|This person sure has lots o' statues...}}

Also nearby is a jade statue of an... orc?
:{{text|bossemote|One statue in particular stood out. I had never seen a creature like this.}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Now wait a darn minute. Is that an orc? Is... is the HORDE here too!?}}
:{{text|bossemote|After inspecting the statues, we saw a female pandaren emerge from the house.}}

Speak with her:
:Yes, little children?
:{{gossip|''Can you help us? Our friend is injured.''}}

:{{text|say|Widow Greenpaw|Now look at this... a [[jinyu]] and... what is that? Some sort of Beard-Sprite?}}
:''Sully acts embarassed.''
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|I'm a [[dwarf]], ma'am. Can we borrow some food?}}
:{{text|say|Widow Greenpaw|The Beard-Sprite will make an excellent addition to my family!}}
:''Greenpaw starts casting a spell in Sully's direction.''
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|What in blazes are you talkin' about...}}
:{{text|bossemote|I finally understood what was going on... but I was a second too late.}}
:{{text|yell|Little Lu|Sully... those aren't statues on her lawn! She wants to turn you into jade!}}
:{{text|say|Socks|Squeak!}}
:''Suddenly, Socks jumps in between Greenpaw and Sully, taking the force of the spell!''
:{{text|yell|Widow Greenpaw|AHHH HA HA HAAAAA!}}
:{{text|yell|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|SOCKS! NOOOOOOOOOOO!}}
:''Greenpaw starts casting again; Sully wisely doesn't wait around and takes off running.''
:{{text|yell|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Run, Little Lu! Run away!! Before she gets you too!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Amber Kearnen|The loss of the raccoon is the least of our worries. Our biggest concern is that petrified orc... and what its presence means. I can tell you the rest of the story.}}

Speak with Amber to continue.


;Mishka on Rell Nightwind's current condition
* ''I am afraid the Commander's injuries are beyond my aid.''
* ''I have done all that I can for the Commander.  I am afraid it will not be long, now.''
* ''It would take a miracle to save the Commander, now.''
