== Objectives ==
Set off 8 fireworks.
*[[Firework Launcher (Jade Forest)|Fireworks launched]] (8)

== Description ==
Do you like fireworks, <sir/ma'am?>

I love them! In older times we would set them off to frighten away [[demon]]s, but I just like them because they're pretty!

I think there are still some old launchers lying around the temple.

Would you go set off some big fireworks for me? It would make me so happy!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
I love to see fireworks lighting up the sky!

== Completion ==
Yay! I saw the fireworks all the way from over here!

Thank you so much, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Scryer's Dilemma]], [[The Librarian's Quandary]], and [[The Rider's Bind]] before heading out. Firework launchers are ''everywhere''. Don't go looking for them, focus on the other quests and click any launchers nearby.
