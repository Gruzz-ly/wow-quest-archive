==Objectives==
Gather 7 Green Branches in the [[Dookin' Grounds]].
* [[Green Branch]] (7)

==Description==
One word: Methane!

We're going green. Clean burning, high availability, all natural, and will keep the [[druid]]s off my back when we get back to our neck of [[Azeroth|the world]].

That, and I ran out of blasting powder...

So, I need your help, <name>.

No, no, I wouldn't ask you to do the dirty work - especially not in front of [[General Nazgrim|the general]]. I'll collect these 'deposits' myself.

You gather up some wood for an outhouse - I'm thinking long-term here!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

==Progress==
Gotta watch out for the wet ones...whewee!

==Completion==
Ah, the smell of progress, and methane.

==Notes==
Rivett can be found in [[Grookin Hill]] at {{Co|27.24|50.76|Jade Forest}} or [[Dookin' Grounds]] at {{Co|30.79|52.27|Jade Forest}}. If accepted in Dookin' Grounds:
:{{text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Watch your step, it's a mine field out here!}}
:''Rivett picks up the poo on the ground and runs back.''
