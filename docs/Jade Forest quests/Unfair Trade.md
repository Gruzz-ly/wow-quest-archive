==Objectives==
Free 8 Captive Pandaren Cubs from [[Twinspire Keep]] by slaying the demonic eyeballs that watch over them.
*[[Captive Pandaren Cub]] freed (8)

==Description==
Though we have only just met, we have a common enemy: this group called the "[[Horde]]."

Several days ago, their leader made us a trade offer. When we refused, his servants abducted several of our cubs as bargaining chips.

We have called in the [[Shado-Pan]] to help, but they are in [[Kun-Lai Summit]], a journey of several days. Can you come to our aid?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Those poor, wee little cubs.  Go, help 'em out, <name>.  Do what's right.

==Completion==
Aye, I seen the wee ones, too. Busted a few out on m'way up here.

Ye've done good, <lad/lass>. Those cubs might have some nasty nightmares, but they'll grow up some day, thanks to you.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fractured Forces]], [[Smoke Before Fire]], and [[Twinspire Keep (quest)]] before heading out.

Take the northwest exit out of [[Paw'don Village]], along the north side of [[Paw'don Glade]] to reach [[Twinspire Keep]]. Get started killing goblins, orcs and Forsaken. Also, kill the [[Eye of Ga'trul|Eyes of Ga'trul]] guarding the pandaren cubs. The four targets of interest are on the lower level, and the two named commanders are on the upper level. As is Sully.
