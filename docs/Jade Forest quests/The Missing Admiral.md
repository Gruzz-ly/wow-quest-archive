== Objectives ==
[[File:Bold Karasshi.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Bold Karasshi}}]]
Find {{NPC||Taylor||Admiral Taylor}}.

== Description ==
Alright. According to the clues you found, that was [[Anduin]]'s ship, and Admiral Taylor was the captain.

And Admiral Taylor's last entry says he was going to fight off the [[hozen]] and protect the vessel after the shipwreck.

The locals say these hozen sometimes take [[prisoner]]s, and I didn't see Taylor's corpse anywhere among [[Wreck of the Vanguard|the wreckage]]. So you'll probably find Taylor at the hozen encampment to the northeast.

Get going, we have no time to lose!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|90}}
* 55000 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
<You found him, but the Admiral is unconscious. He looks on the verge of death.>

== Notes ==
At the big fork in the road, head left, then exit the path off to the right at the [[Slingtail Pits]]. {{NPC||Taylor||Admiral Taylor}} can be found in a hozen cage near the middle of town.  {{NPC||Bold Karasshi}} is in another cage beside him.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|Your friend put up quite the fight. He nearly escaped, but now he is a prisoner, just like the rest of us.}}
Speak with Bold Karasshi to continue.
