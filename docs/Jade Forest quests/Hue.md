==Objectives==
Collect 8 Amberfly Wings.
*[[Amberfly Wing]] x8
*[[Delicate Shearing Knife]] (provided)

==Description==
The most distinguishing feature of the Dream Brew is its iridescent, dream-like color.

To the east, you will find [[Glittering Amberfly|Glittering Amberflies]]. I will need their wings to create the final luminescent color of the brew.

Take this knife and use it to collect 8 wings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 111000 XP

==Progress==
Have you collected all the ingredients? It is almost time to make the Dream Brew.

==Completion==
Beautiful color, rare transparency, shimmer but not sparkle... these will do quite well.

I am beginning to see great potential in you, strange one.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Potency (quest)]] and [[Body]] before heading out. Into the [[Amberfly Bog]] to kill [[mistlurker]]s, [[crocolisk]]s, and [[wasp]]s. Don't forget to use the skinning knife on the amberflies!
