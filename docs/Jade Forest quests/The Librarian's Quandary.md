==Objectives==
[[File:Lorewalker Stonestep.jpg|thumb|[[Lorewalker Stonestep]].]]
Speak to [[Lorewalker Stonestep]] in the [[Scrollkeeper's Sanctum|temple library]].

==Description==
Lorewalker Stonestep is in charge of the entire temple library. Lately, something has been troubling him and his work.

With thousands of ancient tomes to be transcribed, I can't afford to have him distracted.

Would you follow the path south to the library and see what ails him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|90}}
*55000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Elder Sage Rain-Zhu sent you?

Very well. You shall help me.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Scryer's Dilemma]], [[The Rider's Bind]], and [[Lighting Up the Sky]] before heading out. Head south out of the [[Terrace of the Twin Dragons]] to the [[Scrollkeeper's Sanctum]].

==Progression==
