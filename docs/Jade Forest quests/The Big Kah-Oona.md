==Objectives==
Kill Lord Oona.
*[[Lord Oona]] slain {{co|46.5|80.6|Oona Kagu}} / {{co|55.7|29.2|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
The leader of the [[Oona tribe|Oona]] [[hozen]] is a [[brigand]] by the name of Lord Oona.

I have heard fearsome tales of this roaming [[Captain (rank)|sea captain]] and his crew.  Everywhere he takes his tribe, destruction follows.

The Oona land their boats on fertile soil, pillage the local villages, and drain the land dry before moving on to their next conquest.

We shall not allow the same to occur on our shores, not while I am still in charge.

I need someone to go eradicate him now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
* 236000 XP
* +600 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
The tales of Lord Oona are quite interesting.

I have heard that he and his crew have sailed all around [[Azeroth|the world]].  It's said that the Oona have defeated [[kraken]] and ventured to a [[Nazjatar|deep underwater kingdom]] of a creature known as the [[naga]].

Some say there are many Lord Oonas, and that when one dies, another hozen takes his place.  In one tale, he drank an elixir of immortality and cannot be killed.  I have even heard that the Oona are all [[ghost]]s.

What is truth and what is an old fisherwoman's tale?

==Completion==
The leader is dead, then?  Good.  Perhaps now the hozen will leave the villagers in peace.
