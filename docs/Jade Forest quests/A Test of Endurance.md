[[File:Rumpus Pit.jpg|thumb|[[Ring of Inner Focus]].]]
Report to [[Instructor Myang]] on the western side of the [[Tian Monastery]]. {{co|39.0|24.0|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
I have taught you everything that I can, <name>.  It is time you spoke with Instructor Myang.

The fights that she stages are less traditional than the sparring matches I am used to.  Nevertheless, the path of a traveling [[adventurer]] like yourself is unpredictable, and a broad knowledge of fighting styles is an admirable trait.

Farewell, <name>, and best of luck on the remainder of your training.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||98}}
*11,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Greetings, <name>. You are becoming quite famous among the trainees here. I have already heard your name whispered several times, usually between the puffy and discolored lips one{{Sic}} of your sparring partners.

I'm looking forward to working with you.

==Notes==
Head out west. Overlooking the [[Ring of Inner Focus]] is Instructor Myang.
