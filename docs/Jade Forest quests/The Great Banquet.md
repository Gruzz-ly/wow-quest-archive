Head across to the Banquet Grounds:
:{{text|say|Tian Trainee|Welcome to the Great Banquet. High Elder Cloudfall awaits you at the back table.}}
The banquet grounds are full of trainees. Cloudfall and the instructors are at the table in the back.
:Welcome, <name>. We are honored to have you as our guest. Today we celebrate not only your arrival, but the initiation of a new class of trainees within our monastery.
:Please, enjoy the food and drink that we have prepared. When you are ready, I would like to introduce you to some of the monastery's instructors.
*{{gossip|I'm ready to be introduced to the instructors, High Elder.}}
*{{gossip|I don't need any instructions, old man. Let's skip ahead to the good part.}}
Should players choose to not be impolite...
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Let us start with the three who sit behind me.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Before you sits Instructor Myang. She will be responsible for teaching you most practical fighting techinques.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|It is said that, before she joined our monastery, Myang defeated one hundred ravaging hozen in a single melee.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Myang|You flatter me, High Elder. Those hozen were weak, young and unskilled. Any other pandaren would have done the same.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Flatter you? You were eight years old.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Myang|...and a half. Sir.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Next, we have Master Stone Fist. He will be leading your sparring exercises.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Master Stone Fist is nearly unmatched in single combat. He once defeated nine hundred and ninety-nine challengers in a row.}}
:{{text|say|Master Stone Fist|The thousandth challenger cheated.}}
:{{text|yell|High Elder Cloudfall|What? Cheated!?}}
:''Cloudfall jumps on Stone Fist's table and whacks him, before jumping back off.''
:{{text|yell|High Elder Cloudfall|I never cheat!}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Finally, Instructor Xann. His mastery of the very basics of combat has given him a nearly perfect fighting form.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Xann, how many practice strikes do your students perform daily?}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Xann|Ten thousand strikes, every day.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|And how many do YOU perform?}}
:{{text|emote|Instructor Xann smiles.}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Xann|Ten thousand and one.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Luckily, High Elders no longer have to perform basic training. I find that I am happier when I am not exercising.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Walk and drink with me, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Ah! Upon this table, you see Spirit-Sage Gaoquan, the oldest member of our monastery.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|He has seen many elders come and go. He also tends to take these celebrations very seriously.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|You may have noticed the hozen and jinyu among us. All are welcome here at the monastery, as long as they have the desire to learn.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Finally, this is Groundskeeper Wu.}}
:''Wu is passed out on the ground.''
:{{text|yell|High Elder Cloudfall|WU!}}
:{{text|say|Groundskeeper Wu|Ye... yes, high <hic> elder?}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Wu, this is <name>. <He/She> will be joining the other trainees.}}
:{{text|say|Groundskeeper Wu|Oh...<hic>... hello... <name>sszzhhhh....}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Wu will be asking you to perform a few chores. Nothing complex, just some tasks related to the maintenance of our monastery.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|We are all responsible for maintaining our home. Even the High Elder must occasionally lend a hand.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|See? I'm helping by picking up this full mug of ale that someone left on the ground.}}
:{{text|say|High Elder CLoudfall|Now you are caught up. And would you look at that? My cup is full again! It is good to be the High Elder.}}
On complete:
:{{text|say|High Elder Cloudfall|Another mug of ale for <name>!}}
Players will imbibe and quickly pass out. When they wake, Xiao and Master Stone Fist offer quests.
