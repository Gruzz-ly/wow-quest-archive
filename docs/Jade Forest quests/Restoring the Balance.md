==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Slitherscale Ripper]]s or [[Slitherscale Eggdrinker]]s.
*[[Slitherscale]] [[saurok]] slain (8)

==Description==
The situation at the islands remains dire, <name>.

The Slitherscale saurok have not responded to our attempts at peace, so only one option remains.

In order to protect the wild [[cloud serpent]]s, we must rid the island of their presence. Only then can the cloud serpents be left to live in peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
The poachers will wipe out the cloud serpents completely if they are not stopped.

==Completion==
If the poachers will not listen to diplomacy, then they will surely listen to our blades. Thank you, <name>.
