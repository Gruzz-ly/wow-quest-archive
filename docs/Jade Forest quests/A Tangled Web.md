==Objectives==
Destroy Widow's Webs to free 5 Sri-La Villagers.
*[[Freed Sri-La Villager|Sri-La Villagers freed]] x5

==Description==
We have had a disturbing report from the [[Anglers]] fishermen of [[Sri-La Village]], <name>.

Many of their villagers are missing, taken by the spiders who live in [[Widow's Wail|The Widow's Wail]], a cave along the coast to the north.

The victims are dragged into the dark depths, wrapped in cocoons, and left to become the spiders' next meal.

We believe that some of the people may still be alive. There is still time to save them! I need you to go and rescue as many villagers as you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}

* +450 reputation with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
You have done a great deed today, <name>. This is the duty of the Order of the Cloud Serpent - to protect the people of the [[Jade Forest]].
