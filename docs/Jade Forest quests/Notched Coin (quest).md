*[[Notched Coin]]

You saw a number of these coins scattered around the island, they appear to be quite commonly used.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]]
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hello, have you come to sample our new brews?

A coin? Oh, yes, I have seen these before, the island tribes use them.

Sometimes they visit us and purchase supplies. They live a very different life than us, always traveling from place to place, never settling down.

When one group packs up to move on to a new island, it is not uncommon for another tribe to take their place. On and on they go like this.

While you are here, we have be fishing up these [[:Azerite|strange gems]]. Can you make use of them?
