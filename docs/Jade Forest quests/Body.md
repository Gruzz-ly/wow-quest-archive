''A good dream brew is VERY powerful.  It will require a focused mind to gain any kind of clarity from the visions!''

==Objectives==
Collect 5 Pristine Crocolisk Eyes from [[Bog Crocolisk]]s.
*[[Pristine Crocolisk Eye]] (5)

==Description==
A brew's body is an important and often overlooked factor.

To create the perfect consistency, I will need pristine eyes from the Bog Crocolisks to the east.

Take care. The creatures are quite vicious.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Watch your step in the swamp, my new friend.

==Completion==
Do you have crocolisks where you are from?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Potency (quest)]] and [[Hue]] before heading out. Into the [[Amberfly Bog]] to kill [[bog beast]]s, [[mistlurker]]s, and [[wasp]]s. Don't forget to use the skinning knife on the amberflies!

Crocs will more often drop a [[Crocolisk Tear]] instead of its eye...
