== Objectives ==
[[File:Hao Mann.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Hao Mann}} freed]]
Locate {{NPC||Hao Mann}} at the [[Greenstone Quarry]].
*Locate Hao Mann

== Description ==
<For once, the foreman lowers her voice.>

Look, this ain't easy... I got another favor to ask. My idiot husband, Hao, is a shift lead down at the quarry. I told him not to go back, that it was too dangerous, but he's as stubborn as a [[hozen]] and twice as stupid. Says the boys need him around for "moral support."

<Mann sneers.>

What about my moral support?! What am I gonna do if that idiot dies?!

Please... keep an eye out for him. Tell him to come home.

<Her eyes soften before she turns away.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
* 83000 XP

== Completion ==
<Hao looks up at you, struggling to pull himself from the rubble.>

No, no. I got it. HNNGHHH!!

Okay, maybe I don't got it.

== Notes ==
Foreman Mann:
:Normally we'd be more than capable of fulfilling Cho's request.  Jade veins run through this land like...

:<Mann scratches her head for a moment in thought.>

:Well, like something that runs through something else in veins.

:Look, I ain't a poet.

:Point is: we got problems.


Pick up [[Calamity Jade]] before heading out.  Exit to the south and head through the mason's quarter to reach the Greenstone Quarry. Head in:

Further in is Hao Mann, trapped in some rocks:
:{{text|say|Hao Mann|Over here!}}
Turn in and pick up [[Trapped!]] before heading in further. Keep heading in, then start killing shale spiders and freeing miners.

A short ride away in the [[Woods of the Lost]], [[The Sprites' Plight]] is also available.
