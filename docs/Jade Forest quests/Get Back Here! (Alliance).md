==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Admiral Taylor Lion's Landing.jpg|Admiral Taylor|Admiral Taylor is awaiting your return.}}
Report to [[Taylor|Admiral Taylor]] in [[Pearlfin Village]].
*[[Alliance Missive (Jade Forest)]] (provided)

==Description==
Oh, before I forget, I have something I was asked to deliver to you. A letter from one of your companions, I assume.

I was made to understand that your presence was urgently required, so I took the liberty of arranging your passage.

Speak to [[Ginsa Arroweye]] just south of here when you're ready. She has a kite waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
* 83000 XP

==Completion==
Welcome back, <name>. I trust your journey has been insightful, particularly in regards to the layout of the land. There is still much to do before we march into battle.

==Notes==
{{Book|Alliance Missive|content=
Whatever you're up to, <name>, make an end of it.

The [[Horde]] and their [[hozen|savage monkeys]] are preparing to attack.

They outnumber our forces considerably and must not be allowed the time to train their forces.

Put an end to whatever distractions you're engaged in and return to [[Pearlfin Village]] at once.

Head down the stairs, then take a left at the fork heading south. Before leaving the temple grounds, [[Ginsa Arroweye]], the flightmaster, can be found. Speak with her and take a ride down to Pearlfin.

: Where would you like to fly to?

:{{gossip|I could use a kite to Pearlfin Village.}}

Admiral Taylor is up near Elder Lusshan. He offers [[Helping the Cause]], and Sully offers [[An Unexpected Advantage]].  [[Rell Nightwind]] is nowhere to be seen.  As [[Mishka]] predicted, he has apparently died from his injuries and was likely buried; the others make no further mention of him and are focusing on their duties.
