==Completion==
I heard [[Alliance|your people]] had washed up on [[Pandaria|our shores]], but I did not not expect to find one washed up on [[Dreamer's Pavilion|my very doorstep]]! What brings you here, stranger?

<You explain about your search for [[Anduin Wrynn|Prince Anduin]], and describe the boy to the [[pandaren]].>

Very interesting! And so the [[Pearlfin tribe|Pearlfin]] sent you to me, did they?

Well, worth a shot. Interact with the other bottle on the table.
:''After drinking the liquid, the adventurer becomes groggy and lays down, immediately entering a dream state.''
:{{text|bossemote|Spirit of Lo'Gosh|Two hundred ships at my disposal, yet the one carrying my SON goes missing!}}
:''The spirit walks just past the well and stands between it and the table.''
:''Anduin walks up from the other direction with two [[Avenging Wrath]] wings on his back, stops in front of the house and begins casting a spell on the spirit.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|I am sorry, but I cannot go back just yet.}}
:''Anduin dispels the Spirit of Lo'Gosh, revealing his true form as [[Varian Wrynn]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|I've decided to search for the Vale... Vale... Vale...}}
:''Anduin runs out of the pavilion as just beyond, a massive wall of flame goes up.  A sudden explosion (along with the appearance of two tall Horde banners with their bottoms burning) in the fire creates gouts of black smoke. A gigantic [[Garrosh Hellscream]] rises up from the smoke and fire, as in front of the pavilion's wall, two regular Horde banners appear and two more tall banners rise up.''
:{{text|bossemote|Garrosh Hellscream|STORM the shores, and PAINT THIS NEW CONTINENT RED!!}}
:''Lorewalker Cho walks up with a bucket as the vision fades.''
:{{text|bossemote|Lorewalker Cho|My, my. Hello, stranger! Sampled my dream brew, have we?<ref>Here, Cho actually bossemotes the words {{text|bossemote|I see}}, not "have we".</ref> Its visions are hard to interpret - half truth, half illusion. Who's to say which is which?}}
:''He splashes some water on the adventurer.''

Speak with Cho to continue.
