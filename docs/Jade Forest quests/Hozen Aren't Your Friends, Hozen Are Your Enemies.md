==Objectives==
Kill 10 Hozen at the [[Wreck of the Vanguard]].
*Hozen slain (10)

==Description==
We've located an [[Alliance]] wreck to the south. Unfortunately, the locals have informed us that it's currently being scavenged by a group of creatures called "[[hozen]]." 

By pillaging our wrecked ships, these creatures have already shown that they aren't friendly. We can't have them taking spoils from our ships, stealing our supplies, and worse, potentially capturing or killing any survivors. 

Get down there and take them out! When you're done, meet up with [[Nodd Codejack]], our [[SI:7]] agent in the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These Hozen don't act right. Have you dealt with them?

==Completion==
Good work. Dirty creatures trying to kick us when we're down...

That'll teach 'em to try and salvage an Alliance vessel!

==Notes==
Pick up [[The White Pawn]] before heading out.

Head southwest from Rogers' position to reach the Wreck of the Vanguard. Get started killing hozen, and head to the stern of the ship or one of the port-side windows to get aboard. Grab the clues, then find Nodd northwest of the ship, on a cliff overlooking the wreck to the north.
