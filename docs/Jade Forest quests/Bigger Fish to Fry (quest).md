Train the Pearlfin Adepts by killing 24 wildlife in the [[Bamboo Wilds]].
*Bamboo Wilds wildlife (24)

==Description==
I've prepared a team of bright young Pearlfin trainees who need field experience.

Take them northeast, into the Bamboo Wilds, and kill any wildlife that you find.

Don't bring them back until they're fit for battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111,000 [[XP]]
*+4500 [[reputation]] with [[Pearlfin Jinyu]]

==Progress==
How are those trainees looking?

==Completion==
Your trainees returned recently. I could hardly believe my eyes! They did not look like the same jinyu you left with.

Excellent work, <class>.  Couldn't have done better myself.

==Notes==
24! Yup. Head northeast. A differently-classed jinyu will join the adventurer for every 6 mobs. Starting at level 82, they [[ding]] after every other mob, reaching level 85 on the sixth kill.

Any beast-type mobs in the [[Bamboo Wilds]] count, including [[Bamboo Huntress]]es, [[Bamboo Prowler]]s, [[Jeweled Macaw]]s, [[Stoneskin Basilisk]]s, and [[Wild Stalker]]s.
