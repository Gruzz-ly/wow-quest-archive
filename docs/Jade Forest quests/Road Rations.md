==Objectives==
Collect 6 Tortoise Flanks.
*[[Tortoise Flank]] (6)

==Description==
We do not have time to wait around for [[Admiral Taylor|the Admiral]] to recover.

[[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Sully]] and I are planning to search for [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] to the north, but we'll need supplies for our journey.

The lake here is teeming with wildlife, which we have received permission to hunt.

Go and gather some supplies while Sully and I finalize our preparations.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Tortoise Jerky]] x10
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Time is short. Each hour we delay, the White Pawn may move further away.

Where are the supplies I asked for?

==Completion==
This should be plenty, <name>. Thanks.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Pearlfin Situation]] before heading out. The first two NPCs are just to the north. Tortoises are in the water. The Blessing of the Pearlfin swimspeed/waterbreathing buff given by the jinyu when in [[Pearl Lake]] helps. The other two are down at the south end of the island.

:''When you get back, three [[Pearlfin Villager]]s are looking to the south as the ''[[Skyfire]]'' arrives above the village. It may or may not despawn once it comes to a halt.''
:{{text|say|Pearlfin Villager|Wh...  What is that?!}}
:{{text|say|Pearlfin Villager|Is...  Is it some sort of giant flying whale?}}
:{{text|say|Pearlfin Villager|It is so much larger than any of the [[Pandaren]] balloons...  Does it belong to the outsiders?}}

On complete:
:''The ''Skyfire'' spawns above the village.  [[Sky Admiral Rogers]] flys down in [[Admiral Rogers' Personal Gyrocopter|her personal gyrocopter]] and lands, jumping out to walk to Admiral Taylor.''
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Admiral! It's good to see that you are okay.}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Thank you, Catherine. It's good that you're here: With full carrier support we can push north-}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|I'm afraid you'll have to push forward without us.}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|What?}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|I've been ordered back to the main battlegroup to provide carrier escort. The full might of the Alliance navy will arrive in two months' time.}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|What am I supposed to do until then? I've got no men! We don't know where the [[Horde]] are, or how many we're dealing with!}}
:''Rogers laughs.''
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Put on your big-boy pants, Taylor. I will leave the SI:7 officers with you. I suggest a scouting mission.}}
:''Rogers walks back to her gyrocopter and jumps in.''
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Maybe you can recruit some of the locals. I'll leave the situation here in your capable hands.}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Yes, Admiral.}}
:''Rogers flies back up to the ''Skyfire''.  Taylor salutes.''
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Godspeed.}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|"Improvise." Humph.}}
:''The ''Skyfire'' begins pulling away, departing in a northerly direction.''
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Nightwind! Take your men and scout the interior. Look for a Horde presence. And find Prince Anduin!}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|If there's any sign of Anduin, we'll find it.}}
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|Wait! Even though we are not friends, you should not go into unfamiliar territory alone.}}
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|I will send my brother to go with you.}}
:{{text|say|[[Little Lu]]|Hmm, you want... me?}}
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|Please bring him back safely. He is young, but clever. He can help you find your way.}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|I swear I will keep him safe. We will return as soon as we can.}}
:{{text|emote|Rell lowers his voice to a whisper.}}
:{{text|whisper|Rell Nightwind|Make friends with the jinyu. We may need them before this mission is over, and that's an order.}}
:''Rell and Sully take off.''
:{{text|say|Little Lu|Very well. Let us proceed.}}
:''Little Lu takes off after them.''

==Progression==
{{Spirits of the Water}}

==Trivia==
The ''Skyfire'' that shows up here is merely a hollow graphic; if you can fly, there is nothing to actually land on.
