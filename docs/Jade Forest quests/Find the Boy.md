== Objectives ==
[[File:Inkmaster Wei.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Inkmaster Wei}}]]
Speak with {{NPC||Inkmaster Wei}}.

== Description ==
Have you seen my son, {{NPC||Lo Wanderbrew||Lo}}? He was here a moment ago and I told him we were leaving today.

I'm sure he's off trying to woo that young {{NPC||Syra Goldendraft}}. That is the very reason we need to leave!

No son of mine is going to run off with a Goldendraft!

I'm going to search around here for them.

I do keep catching those two sneaking off to the [[Arboretum]]. Any chance you could head out there and look for them?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

== Completion ==
You seek two lovers blind to the ambitions of their family names. They were here, seeking a way to hold to their path.

Sadly they did not find their answers among the trees or art.

== Notes ==
Head the hill to the Arboretum. Near the main building is Inkmaster Wei, who completes the quest. Nearby, Inkmasters {{NPC||Inkmaster Glenzu||Glenzu}} and {{NPC||Inkmaster Jo Po||Jo Po}} also offer quests.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Inkmaster Jo Po|Oh! <class>! Over here. I could use some assistance if you have a moment.}}

==Progression==
{{Goldendraft and Wanderbrew}}
