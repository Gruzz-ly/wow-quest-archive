==Objectives==
[[File:Mouthwatering Brew.jpg|thumb|Mouthwatering Brew]]
Search for [[Lorewalker Cho]] at the [[Dreamer's Pavilion]] in the [[Jade Forest]].

==Description==
I see that you and your people are desperate to find your [[Anduin Wrynn|Prince Anduin]].

I know someone who may be able to help you, a pandaren [[Lorewalker]] who knows this land better than anyone. I cannot guarantee what kind of reception you will receive, but he will almost certainly be as curious about you are you are of him!

The Lorewalker lives in the forest to the southwest. Tell him that the [[Pearlfin tribe|Pearlfin]] have sent you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|90}}
*55000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You look around the empty house.

It appears you are in the right place, but there is no sign of its inhabitant.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Perfect Match]] before heading out. It is probably more efficient to finish that series of quests before leaving the jinyu area for this quest.

Either way, exit the town to the south and head west, then take a left at the fork in [[Amberfly Bog]] to reach the [[Dreamer's Pavilion]]. Immediately outside the building opposite the gate is a table with some Mouthwatering Brew. Interact with it.

==Progression==
