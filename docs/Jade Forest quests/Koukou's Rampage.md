== Objectives ==
Kill Koukou.
*[[Koukou]] slain {{co|39.3|90.0|Jade Forest}}

== Description ==
We have more than just our cellars to worry about.

Koukou, our beloved [[mushan]], has gone crazy! Just look at him!

I've tried cajoling and pleading and yelling and soothing, but nothing has worked.

I'm afraid he is no longer of his own mind. There is only one way to save him, and our brewery.

Strike swift and sure. He will not feel a thing.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Things are going crazy around here, and it all started when you arrived, <race>.

== Completion ==
You did well to help the Brewers and bring this news to me.

From what you have told me, it sounds as if Koukou was possessed by some dark energy. Could it be...?

No. That is impossible.

== Notes ==
Koukou should be right next to Lin and Teng. A level 85 mushan, it has 316,000 health. Take it out, then return to {{NPC||Sunke Khang}} bac at [[Paw'don Village]].

==Progression==
{{Paw'don Village}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
