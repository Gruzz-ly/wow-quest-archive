:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Thanks to your actions, the [[Hozen]] fear your people. Indulge me a moment...}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Ah! Here we are. Over 14,000 years ago, [[Pandaria|this entire land]] was ruled by a terrible race of warlords called "the [[mogu]]."}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The mogu ruled through fear. And fear kept them in power... until the first [[Pandaren]] [[monk]]s taught my people courage.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Then the mogu were overthrown.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|You see, those who lead through fear only stay in power while those they govern lack courage.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The hozen are many things, but they are not cowards - not for long. If you don't wish to fight them, you must... inspire them!}}
