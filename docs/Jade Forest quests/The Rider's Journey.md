==Objectives==
Return to [[Instructor Skythorn]] at the [[Arboretum]] in the [[Jade Forest]].
*<Color> Serpent Egg (provided)

==Description==
Excellent, just excellent! I will return the other eggs to their nests, undisturbed.

In the meantime, deliver your egg to Instructor Skythorn at The Arboretum.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
The wild cloud serpents live in a delicate balance with nature. Their rare eggs are quite vulnerable to enemies.

==Completion==
Ah yes, [[Elder Anli]] mentioned that a new student had joined our ranks. I see you have already chosen your cloud serpent egg.

I will instruct you on its care. Let me see it for a moment.
