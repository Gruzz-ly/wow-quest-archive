==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 Orchard Tools from [[Nectarbreeze Orchard]].
*[[Orchard Tool]] (6)

==Description==
They may not be weaponmasters, but many of these farmers can wield a simple hoe or rake as an extension of their own will.

That mastery coupled with the right motivation could muster a force capable of standing against the [[mogu]].

If you can bring back some tools from the orchard, I'll distribute them to anyone willing to fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were there any tools left?

==Completion==
There are no <class>es among us, but we'll fight to protect our loved ones.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Defiance]], [[Rally the Survivors]], and [[Spitfire]] before heading out.  Raiders are in town, incinerators are further away. Tools are out on the ground in the trees.

==Progression==
