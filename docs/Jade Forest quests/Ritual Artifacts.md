== Description ==
So many spirits held in captivity here... I can feel them everywhere. Even the walls are a cage for the long-dead.

<Name>, we cannot simply break the sorcery over this place - doing so would release countless agonized souls to wander the earth. They will need a beacon, something to guide them.

With your help, I can create [[The Tan-Chao|a tan-chao]]: a bridge from this world to the heavens. For this ritual, I'll need a bowl, a candle, and a jade cong. You should be able to find them all within the ruins.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

== Progress ==
Have you found the items we need for the ritual? We cannot guide these spirits back without them.

== Completion ==
Good work. With these, I can complete the ritual to send all of the spirits here--including myself--back where they belong.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Vessels of the Spirit]] and [[The Wayward Dead]] before heading out.

Kill mogu, use the staff on the spirits, and find the three items.
