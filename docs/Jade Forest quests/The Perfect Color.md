==Objectives==
Gather 8 Freshly Fallen Petals.
*[[Freshly Fallen Petal]] (8)

==Description==
As you have seen, [[Arboretum|this grove]] is abundant with beautiful pink petals. As each petal ages, the tone deepens and fades.

If you would be so kind, I am in need of a few petals that have freshly fallen. Only the ones that have just fallen will have precisely the right color I am after.

From it I can forge an ink that is breathtaking. Can you help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 XP

==Progress==
There is only a small window of time after each petal falls that it may be used to achieve the perfect hue.

==Completion==
Ah! You have a wonderful eye for color my friend. These will make a superb pigment.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Quill of Stingers]] before heading out. Kill wasps and loot petals.
