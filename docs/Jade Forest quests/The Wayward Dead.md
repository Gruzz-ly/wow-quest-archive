==Objectives==
Use the Staff of Pei-Zhi to absorb 10 Wayward Ancestors in the [[Terrace of Ten Thunders]].
*[[Wayward Ancestor]]s Recovered x10
*[[Staff of Pei-Zhi (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
The process of mass conjuring, as the [[mogu]] are doing here, is not without byproduct. Some spirits arrive too distraught or unruly to be harnessed, so they are confined and left to wander until their desperation leaves them more malleable.

I suspect the mogu have such a holding area somewhere nearby, likely guarded by spiritclaws.

Please, take my staff again and use it to collect these wayward spirits. You needn't fight them - present the staff and they should be drawn in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

==Progress==
We mustn't forsake the wayward dead.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I will take them with me into the nether.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Vessels of the Spirit]] and [[Ritual Artifacts]] before heading out.

Kill mogu, use the staff on the spirits, and find the three items.
