==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Pei-Zhi.jpg|Pei-Zhi|Take my staff from the altar and charge it with Ancient Spirits!}}
Recover the Staff of Pei-Zhi and interrupt the mogu ritual in the center of the [[Terrace of Ten Thunders]].
*[[Staff of Pei-Zhi]] {{co|44.2|14.9|Jade Forest}}
*Interrupt the Ritual of Spiritbinding

==Description==
<Your mind is racked with a howl. Beneath it, a wispy voice is barely audible, as if from far away.>

Please... help... heart of the ruins... a ritual... conjuring...

...should not be here...

My staff... on the altar... use it. Please hurry.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Axe of Sacrifice
|Spirit Crusher
|Spiritsage's Protector
|Spiritsage's Shield
|Spiritbound Crescent
|Spiritbound Axe
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Spirit-binding! How can the [[mogu]] have been allowed to resume such a disgusting practice?! And now here I am, the product of a half-failed conjuring...

<The spirit fumes for a moment, then turns to you.>

What century is this?

==Completion==
Allow me to introduce myself: I am Pei-Zhi, Master Spiritsage under the last pandaren emperor {{NPC||Shaohao}}.

At least... I was.

==Notes==
Upon completion of Break the Cycle and Simulacrumble, this quest is automatically accepted. Head northwest in the ruins to find {{NPC||Shan Jitong|Waker of Spirits}} conjuring something with {{NPC||Pei-Zhi}}. Just below Pei-Zhi's floating body is the Staff of Pei-Zhi on the altar. Pick it up, then start killing the {{NPC||Ancient Spirit}}s Shan Jitong is summoning. Each kill is worth 5%.

:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|What do you think you're doing?!  No matter - I no longer need the staff.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Slay Ancient Spirits to empower the Staff of Pei-Zhi!}}

At 20%:
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|Ancestors, hear me! I call you back from the beyond, to bind this spirit to my will!}}
At 50%:
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|Enough of your interference, <race>! Spiritclaws! Deal with this pest!}}
Two [[Shan'ze Spiritclaw]]s come out. They have a void zone ability, dodge it! Kill the two mogu, then return to killing the spirits.

At 75%:
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|More spirits! MORE! Quickly now!}}
At 100%:
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|I WILL have you, spirit sage!}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|No. Your perversion of the dead ends here.}}
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|Spirits of old, I release you from my staff! Seek your vengeance on this beast!}}
:{{text|say|Shan Jitong|Augh! Too... much... It's too much!}}
:{{text|say|Shan Jiton|I cannot fall here. Not with so much work left to be done...}}
:''Shan Jitong runs forward beyond the walls and teleports.''
:{{text|say|Pei-Zhi|All these poor souls... here, this will lead you home.}}
:''Pei-Zhi opens some kind of portal for the Ancient Spirits to use.''

If players level up during this quest from the two mogu that attack, the quest will bug out preventing players from completing it and keep them in combat.
*To fix this, abandon the quest and walk down to the [[Seat of the Spirit Waker]]. While you'll likely still be in combat, the staff should respawn for the quest to start up the progress bar once again.
