==Objectives==
[[File:Jailbreak.jpg|thumb|Taylor and Karasshi at Pearlfin Village]]
Kill 10 Slingtail Fishrippers.
*[[Slingtail Fishripper]] slain (10)

==Description==
Without healing, your friend [[Taylor]] will die. [[Pearlfin Village|My village]] is just east of here, in the middle of the [[Pearl Lake|large lake]].

I will take Taylor myself, but the fighting is most dangerous in that direction.

I need you to help clear a path through the [[hozen]], so that I may run safely into my village.

Can you do this?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|90}}
* 55000 [[XP]]
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Pearlfin Jinyu]]

==Progress==
Our conflict with the hozen goes back many generations.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Because of you we were able to make it here safely.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Karasshi jumps from his cage to Taylor's, freeing Taylor and putting him on Karasshi's back.''
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|My people do not like strangers, but I owe you this much. May the elders not punish me for this deed.}}
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|We are going to pass through a fierce battle, <name>. You must engage the hozen while I run through. If all goes well, I will meet you at my village.}}
Karasshi lifts Taylor on to his back and sprints through the conflict to [[Pearlfin Village]]. Kill the quota of fishrippers and follow Karasshi. He can be found on the far side of the island. Pick up the flight path on the way in to town.
:{{Text|say|[[Pearlfin Poolwatcher]]|Who is the stranger who walks among us?}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|Wait, I sense the presence of intruders. Is it hozen? Show yourselves!}}
:''[[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Sully]], [[Mishka]] and [[Rell Nightwind|Rell]] have been [[Stealth|stealthing]] towards Taylor, but drop out of stealth when called out with their weapons drawn.''
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|What have you done to our Admiral?}}
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|I have done nothing. This is the work of the Slingtail chief, [[Chief Gukgut|Gukgut]].}}
:{{text|say|Mishka|You think we can believe him, Commander?}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|We have no other choice. Put down your weapon, warrior, and we will put down ours.}}
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|Slowly then.}}
:''All four slowly put their weapons away.''
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|We are not in the habit of welcoming outsiders into our village.}}
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|You may stay only until Taylor is well. But then, you must leave.}}
:{{text|say|Bold Karasshi|We will be watching you.}}

Rell and Karasshi offer quests upon conclusion of the conversation.
