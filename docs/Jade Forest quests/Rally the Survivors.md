== Objectives ==
Speak with 6 {{NPC||Nectarbreeze Farmer}}s around the [[Nectarbreeze Orchard]] and send them to the safehouse.
*Survivors Rescued (5)

== Description ==
The people of this village are simple farmers - not fighters like you and I. Still, they are stubbornly defending their homes as best they can.

Search the village for anyone still on their feet and tell them to rally here at {{NPC||Gentle Mother Hanae||Hanae's}} place.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Please tell me some still live...

== Completion ==
They're inside. Shaken, but still alive thanks to you.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Gentle Mother Hanae|Who's out there, Shao? Is it safe?}}
:{{text|say|Shao the Defiant|Stay inside, Hanae! Adventurer, please see if there's anything the Gentle Mother needs. She is working tirelessly to tend to the survivors inside.}}
Pick up [[Defiance]], [[Spitfire]], and [[Orchard-Supplied Hardware]] before heading out. Raiders are in town, incinerators are further away. Tools are out on the ground in the trees.
