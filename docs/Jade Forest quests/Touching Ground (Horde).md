==Objectives==
Use a [[Rappelling Rope]] to reach the ground.
* Rappel into [[Honeydew Glade]]

==Description==
[[Nazgrim]] has taken command of the ground assault and has requested that you be sent to meet up with him immediately.

We have several rappelling ropes setup near the guns. Fastest way down you're going to find, save the one that ends poorly.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

==Progress==
What?

==Completion==
There you are!

I was starting to worry we'd have to charge in and have all the fun without you.

==Progression==
{{The Art of War}}
