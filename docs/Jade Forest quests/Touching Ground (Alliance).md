[[File:Touching Ground parachutes.jpg|The Skyfire Parachutes.|thumb]]

==Objectives==
Use a Skyfire Parachute to touch ground in [[Garrosh'ar Point]], then speak to [[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary]].
* Equip a Skyfire Parachute

==Description==
Their town is burning and their men are scattered and broken. I need every available man on the ground NOW to finish them off.

Grab one of the parachutes on the edge of the ship and get down there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*122,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Move it!

==Completion==
'Bout time you showed up, <laddy/lassie>! Let's do some damage!

==Notes==
* This quest was slightly bugged at release, with the parachutes sometimes not spawning on the sides of the ship.

Upon accepting the quest, [[Sky Admiral Rogers]] gives a speech to a group of nine [[Alliance Paratrooper (Jade Forest)|Alliance Paratroopers]] standing in formation before her on deck.
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Men, you've trained for this.  You're among the elite.  You are ''Skyfire'' men!}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|This is the ship that took down [[Deathwing]].  You think some raggedy little Horde outpost stands a chance against the pride of the Alliance fleet?  NO!}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Those green dirtbags down there plagued your homes in [[Ruins of Southshore|Southshore]], laid siege to your children in [[Redridge]], and massacred every man, woman and child in [[Theramore]].}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|It.  Is.  PAYBACK TIME!}}
:''The paratroopers cheer.''

Run to the side of the ship and interact with a parachute. The adventurer will put it on and jump off, circling over Garrosh'ar Point before landing to the north next to Sully.  He's tinkering with a busted Garrosh'ar Shredder.

* {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Gah, this thing's a death trap!}}
* {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Is that... a cherrywood drive-shaft?  Who does that?!}}
* {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|I'm pretty sure this "valve" is a toenail.  Goblins...}}
* {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Yeesh!  Me great nan could build a more reliable manifold than this.  An' she has!}}
* {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Look at this - total amateur hour!  Doesn't even have a second-stage turbine blade.}}
* {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Level two grappling done.  Now to tighten up level three...}}
* {{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Wait and see, lads.  We'll have ourselves a fine killin' machine in no time.}}
