==Objectives==
[[File:Serpent Egg.jpg|thumb|Serpent Egg]]
Collect 6 Serpent Eggs.
*[[Serpent Egg]] (6)

==Description==
Ahhh, I should have known! You have the look of a hungry initiate.

I would gladly help you choose a serpent egg, but the Slitherscale have thoroughly raided the [[cloud serpent]] nests.

I'm terribly sorry. I don't know what to tell you.

Unless you're crazy enough to sneak into the [[saurok]] camp to the east and retrieve some stolen cloud serpent eggs, I'm afraid I can't help you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Cloud Serpent]]

==Progress==
The saurok keep the stolen serpent eggs in their camp.

==Completion==
Oh, wonderful!

These eggs look...well...they look a little on the small side. Are you sure you couldn't find any better ones?

Oh well, I suppose with the current situation, we can't be so picky.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Beating the Odds]] and [[Empty Nests]] before heading out.

Head north away from Tong and circle clockwise to the northwest around the high bluff to reach the saurok camp, killing saurok and leashing cloud serpent hatchlings along the way. Once [[Slitherscale Ripper]]s are found, the eggs will also be nearby.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Instructor Tong|Ahhh, here's a nice one. Yes, this egg will do. Not this one. Too small! Perhaps this one could pass the bill...}}
