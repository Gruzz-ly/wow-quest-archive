* [[Garrosh'ar Shredder]] slain (8)
* [[Bladefist Reaper]] sunk

== Description ==
I will NOT let the [[Horde]] gain a foothold on these shores before we do! If you're looking to jump into the fray, I've got a spare [[gyrocopter]] for you at the end of the runway. An attack run is already programmed in, all you have to do is concentrate on shooting.

Speaking to Sky Admiral Rogers:
:I've been waiting to unleash this gunship against a worthy target.  Let's spend some ammunition!

On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Nodd Codejack]]|Over here, <name>! Your gyrocopter's ready to go!}}

Hop in. Communications among the quest givers are heard as your gyrocopter joins the attack.
:{{text|say|[[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary]]|What in blazes is this?}}
:{{text|say|[[Rell Nightwind]]|Admiral, we're seeing a significant native presence here. Ornate structures-}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Rogers|Cut the chatter, people. Eyes on the target!}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|You heard the admiral. Concentrate fire on the Horde base. Begin your attack runs.}}

The vehicle UI pops up with one ability:
*{{abilities|Torpedo Rocket|range=200|Deals 0 damage to targets in a radius around the impact location.|cd=6 sec}}

Kill the [[Garrosh'ar Grunt]]s and [[Garrosh'ar Shredder]]s. Note that [[Garrosh'ar Peon]]s do NOT count. The gyrocopter will loop around [[Garrosh'ar Point]] until quota is met. Once that's done:
:{{text|say|Admiral Rogers|Well done. No mercy!}}
:''The gyrocopter flies over to the ''Bladefist Reaper''.''
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|Use your torpedo rockets on those ships.}}

Conveniently, the ship is carrying large quantities of explosive wooden barrels on deck. There's a group up toward the bow and another astern. Take both sets out.
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|Confirmed kill. Nice shooting.}}
:''The gyrocopter flies over to the ''Stygian Star''.''
:{{text|say|Admiral Rogers|Pay 'em back! Hit them with everything you've got!}}

Same as the previous ship, blow up both sets of explosive barrels.
:{{text|say|Admiral Rogers|That one's for [[Theramore]]!}}
:''The gyrocopter starts flying back to the ''Skyfire''.''
:{{text|say|Admiral Rogers|Any sign of the flagship down there?}}
:{{text|say|Rell Nightwind|Negative, Admiral. No sign of [[Captain Taylor]] OR his flagship.}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Rogers|That's enough - all wings, report back. Prepare for ground assault.}}

Return to [[Sky Admiral Rogers]] on deck.
