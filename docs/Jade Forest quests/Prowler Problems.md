== Objectives ==
Destroy 10 Sha-Infested Prowlers in [[Honeydew Glade]].
* [[Sha-Infested Prowler]] slain (10)

== Description ==
The animals have all gone crazy!

Normally the prowlers steer clear of the village, but now we can't seem to keep them away. I've never seen them act this way before!

The mayor has summoned in the Shado-Pan, but they're not all here yet. Can you take care of those prowlers before they maul one of our farmers?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

==Progress==
Look at this mess! This is madness!

== Completion ==
Ah, so your conflict at the ruins is beginning to pollute the local wildlife? This is very troubling - I have never seen a reaction so intense.

Thank you for protecting the village, but it is a tragedy that those poor animals had to die.
