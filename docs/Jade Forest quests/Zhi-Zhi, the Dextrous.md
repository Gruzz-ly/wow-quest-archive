== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Zhi-Zhi.jpg|Zhi-Zhi|Fights with blinding speed and a less-than-blinding intellect.}}
Defeat Zhi-Zhi at the [[Tian Monastery]].
* {{NPC||Zhi-Zhi}} defeated {{co|43.1|26.0|Jade Forest}}

== Description ==
Upon the hills to my right, you will find a [[hozen]] named Zhi-Zhi. He, too, won enough sparring matches to move up the ranks. I think he will provide you with more of a challenge.

Challenge him, and try to defeat him.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110,000 XP

== Progress ==
Zhi-Zhi's style is different than that of most [[pandaren]] monks. He and his kind tend to have more... energy... than us.

== Completion ==
It appears that I must move you up the ranks yet again, <class>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Husshun, the Wizened]] before heading out. Zhi-Zhi can be found south of the immediate area up on a hill.
* Zhi-Zhi can't believe they've actually let me into the monastery training program!

: Me!  Zhi-Zhi!

* Zhi-Zhi has always been good at hitting his friends, but Zhi-Zhi has gotten a lot better since studying here.
* Stand back!  Zhi-Zhi  practicing here!  Anybody who gets within 5 yards of here is probably going to get knocked out... maybe even killed.

: Hai-yah!
