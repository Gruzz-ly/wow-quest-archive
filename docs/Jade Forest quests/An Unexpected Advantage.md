==Objectives==
Retrieve the missing Water-Damaged Gears and Rusty Locking Bolts from the Hozen Ambushers{{Sic}} to the East.
*[[Water-Damaged Gear]] (4)
*[[Rusty Locking Bolt]] (4)

==Description==
Things seem to be goin' our way more and more lately, <name>. I was out doin some explorin' when I came upon this little beauty.

<Sully gestures to the [[ballista]] to his right.>

Problem is she's one of a set and the other one is still in pieces. I'd have gotten it together by now if those pesky Grimleers hadn't ambushed me and taken some of the gears and bolts.

Hey, ye seem to be pretty good at handlin' the natives. Ye wouldn't mind goin' and helpin' ol'Sully out would ye?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did ye find my missing gears and bolts?

==Completion==
Well these aren't as good as she deserves, but it will have to work.

<Sully pats the dismantled ballista.>

I'll get 'er up and runnin' in no time, just ye watch!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Helping the Cause]] before heading out. Head east back to the [[Bamboo Wilds]] to fight the [[Slingtail Ambusher]]s, who have the goods.

;Sully "The Pickle" McLeary
: These ballistas{{sic}} are just the advantage we needed!  Now if we can just get the other one up and runnin' we'll really be in business.
