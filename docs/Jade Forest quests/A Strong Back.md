==Objectives==
[[File:Mother Wu.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Mother Wu}}]]
Obtain a Boiling Cauldron from {{NPC||Mother Wu}} in the [[Waxwood Forest]], then return to {{NPC||Groundskeeper Wu}} in the [[Tian Monastery]].
*Boiling Cauldron obtained {{co|37.8|17.5|Jade Forest}}
*Boiling Cauldron returned {{co|41.6|23.7|Jade Forest}}

==Description==
Some of our trainees have... larger-than-normal appetites. We have occasionally had difficulty supplying enough food for all of them. In times like these, we have to ask for help.

A kindly older woman, who lives in a small house to the northwest, has agreed to make some stew for our trainees. All you need to do is go and get it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 XP

==Progress==
She really is a nice woman. And an excellent cook.

The best cook in the world, actually.

==Completion==
I will see to it that stew is distributed evenly and appropriately among the trainees.

After I set some aside for myself, of course.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Steady Hand]] and [[And a Heavy Fist]] before heading out. Exit to the nortwest, either through or around the [[Ring of Inner Focus]], and pick up [[Burning Bright]] from {{NPC||Guard Shan Long}} before entering the Waxwood.

Quickly turn north in the Waxwood to reach Mother Wu's house and pick up a Boiling Cauldron.
:{{text|say|Mother Wu|Did my son send you? There's plenty of stew to go around. Please, help yourself.}}

Interact with a Boiling Cauldron to start dragging it along. It is lvl 87 with 214,000 health. It moves at run speed, so stay off mounts. On the way back, Greenwood Tricksters are attracted by the smell and will attack the cauldron, so take this opportunity to kill them. Turn it in to Wu.

*{{text|say|Greenwood Trickster|What I smell?}}
*{{text|say|Greenwood Trickster|Smell good!}}
*{{text|say|Greenwood Trickster|Want to eat the stew! Want to eat the stew!}}
*{{text|say|Greenwood Trickster|Stew, stew, stew stew...}}
*{{text|say|Greenwood Trickster|Gimme gimme gimme...}}

Head back out and complete the other quests. The tricksters are closer to the monastery, while the bushleaf and tigers are further away. Blushleaf can be gathered in groups of up to ~15.

;On completion
:{{text|say|Groundskeeper Wu|<Name>, you have no idea how glad I am to see you. Supervising is hungry work.}}
