== Objectives ==
Talk to {{NPC||Fanny Thundermar||Fanny}} at [[Kirthaven]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
{{NPC||Keegan Firebeard||Firebeard}}? Marry my sister!? I swear the world's gone mad, <name>!

Still, maybe {{NPC||Kurdran Wildhammer||Kurdran}} is right. A nice normal wedding would ease everyone's mind... and maybe cool off Firebeard a little. It was great to actually work together here against the ogres.

Right then! It's all up to Fanny. Something tells me she won't want to be tied down.

Fly back to Kirthaven and see if she's game. I'll finish up the nasty business with the ogres here.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|50}} (or {{cost|6|57|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
<Fanny throws her arms up, exasperated.>

You, Kurdran, Firebeard, and now my brother - everyone's got wedding fever!

Fine, fine, I'll marry Keegan Firebeard. But only 'cuz he's strong and handsome, with a jaw that can cut gravel and an arse like an anvil. Not for any political reasons.

We're going to need your help, though. We got a whole lotta wedding to put together, and not a lot of time to do it.

== Notes ==
Try to get ''that'' image out of your mind...

On complete:
