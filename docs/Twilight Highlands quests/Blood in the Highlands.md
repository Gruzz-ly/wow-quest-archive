== Objectives ==
Talk to [[Wodin the Troll-Servant]] at the [[Crucible of Carnage]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
You've got some fight in you, <class>. You might do well in the crucible.

What!? You haven't heard of the Crucible of Carnage? That smarmy goblin [[Gurgthock]] and his Troll sidekick have been plastering us with leaflets ever since he set up shop here in the Highlands. Champions from all over [[Azeroth]] fight to the death in there. You should gather up some friends and see how you fare.

The Crucible is just to the southwest. Look for Wodin the Troll-Servant somewhere in the middle of a ring of bones.

Hey, you're one big strong heap of <class>. Can you handle the crucible? We got bookies are standing by!
