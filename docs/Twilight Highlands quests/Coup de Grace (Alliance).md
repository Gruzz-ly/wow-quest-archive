== Description ==
Look at that. [[Lirastrasza]]'s destroying them!

There are drakes that she's downing that need finishing off, <name>. Wouldn't want the Twililght's healers to get them back up into the air.

Time for a little Coup de Grace.

== Progress ==
Finish off more Twilight Skyterrors.

== Completion ==
Our efforts to improve relations with the red dragons has really paid off, <name>.

== Notes ==
Lira is circling the citadel complex, knocking skyterrors out of the sky. Finish them off. If players have not done [[Help from the Earthcaller (Alliance)|Help from the Earthcaller]], now is the time, as Shaw will not offer more quests until players do Yevaa and Goldmine's quests.
