== Objectives ==
Slay 10 [[Citadel Veteran]]s, [[Corrupted Elementalist]]s, and/or [[Twilight Vindicator]]s.
* [[Twilight Citadel]] cultists slain x10

== Description ==
There's nothing worse than a self-hating [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultist. Nothing! These idiots actually want to bring about the end of the world.

That marks them for extinction in my book.

Between the citadel veterans, the corrupted elementalists, and the twilight vindicators, you should have no shortage of targets.

I could care less how you choose to kill them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Go back and kill more.

== Completion ==
Feels good to get a little blood on your hands, doesn't it? Especially when that blood belongs to such self-deluded fools.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dark Assassins (Horde)|Dark Assassins]] and [[Help from the Earthcaller (Horde)|Help from the Earthcaller]] before heading out. Kill any enslaved elementals for a buff:
*Tempest's Blessing: Damage taken decreased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
*Waterspout's Favor: Health regeneration increased by 100% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 Minutesn*Inferno's Invocation: Damage increased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
Dark Assassins are [[shade]]s wandering the area. The cultists are all humanoid.

==Progression==
