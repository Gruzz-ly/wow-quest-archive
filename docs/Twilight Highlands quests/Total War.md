== Objectives ==
Smash 10 Thundermar Ale Kegs within the [[Thundermar Ruins]].
* Wildhammer Kegs Smashed (10)

== Description ==
Many of the [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]] have already fled their homes. It is time to wipe them from the map.

Up on the ridge to the north you will find abandoned houses in the Thundermar Ruins. Kegs of potent Thundermar ale have been left behind.

Thundermar ale is 220% proof; I don't know how that's possible.

Smash open the kegs and set their content aflame. Burn them out! Leave the dwarves nothing to return to!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Alefire Bracers
|Wound-Binder Chestguard
|Keg Smasher}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9}}

== Completion ==
Yes, yes. Burn them out, as you would flush groundhogs from their holes...

Well done, <name>.
