== Objectives ==
Defeat 6 Dragonmaw Stragglers.
*[[Dragonmaw Straggler]] defeated x6

== Description ==
The [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight]] sacked this town, killin' most of the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] that lived in it. A few survived though, and they're not right keen on us takin' liberties with their supplies.

Not that that matters much.

Well, I'm not right keen on them attackin' my boys. Kill'm off, chase'm out - I don't care, just get'm gone.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
Clear this place out for me yet? Not lookin' like it.

== Completion ==
That's more like it. Let's finish gatherin' up supplies and get back to Keegan.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Lost Brother]] and [[Anything We Can Get]] before heading out. Immediately fly fifty yards northeast to find Bahrum before leaving the area.

Players can choose to either help the injured stragglers to their feet, sending them running, or attempting to slice the straggler's necks, resulting in a fight. The uninjured ones just want to be killed.
