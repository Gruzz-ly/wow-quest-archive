== Objectives ==
Slay {{NPC||Muddied Water Elemental}}s to collect 5 Whirlpool Cores.
*[[Whirlpool Core]] x5

== Description ==
Our friends in the [[Earthen Ring]] have been trying to open portals back to [[Stormwind]], with no luck. But {{NPC||Thordun Hammerblow||Thordun}} here tells me he might just have the key.

The crazed [[water elemental]]s in the nearby [[Verrall Delta|Verrall River Delta]] have been sent into a frenzy. Thordun tells me we can channel their energy into a portal.

I don't understand all this elemental-claptrap, but I understand one thing: killin' elementals and takin' their whirlpool cores. Deliver them to {{NPC||Talaa}} in the courtyard!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Water-Drill Treads|Whirlpool Bracers|Coregrip Gauntlets}}
You also will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
Hello, <class>. Kurdran tells me you've got a solution to getting this portal opened?

== Completion ==
My word, <name>. These elemental energies are so powerful, so chaotic - no wonder the [[Twilight's Hammer]] has chosen to build their stronghold here!

I should be able to channel these energies into something more benign and productive though. Let's give it a try...

''On complete:''
:{{text|say|Talaa|By wind and wave, by earth and fire... To Stormwind we go, <name>!}}
:''The elemental portal to Stormwind activates!''

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Perfect Poultice]] before heading out. Head west over the [[Twilight Shore (Twilight Highlands)|Twilight Shore]], west of [[Dragonmaw Port]] up the bay to the [[Verrall Delta]]. Then go killing and looting.

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Highbank!}}
