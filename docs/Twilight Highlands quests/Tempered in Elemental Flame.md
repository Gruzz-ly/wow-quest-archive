== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Tempered Spears.
*[[Tempered Spear]] x8

== Description ==
First things first: We're going to need ammunition. Ammunition powerful enough to pierce the armored hide of a black drake.

West of [[Thundermar]] is a Wildhammer town that's been overrun with unbound fire elementals. Any weapons left behind in that conflagration will have been tempered in elemental flame. Tougher than anything I could whip up at this forge!

Find me spears in the [[Humboldt Conflagration]], <name>. The pointier the better.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Spears, yes? My rapid-fire speargun would be rendered ineffective without them.

== Completion ==
Look at that - OW! Pointy! Hot!

These spears should cut through that dragonhide like an electric cheese-slicing apparatus through butter.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Magmalord Falthazar]], [[Hot Stuff]], [[Potential Energy]] and [[A Vision of Twilight (Alliance)|A Vision of Twilight]] before heading out.

Northwest out of Thundermar to the conflagration. Tempered Spears litter the area.

==Progression==
