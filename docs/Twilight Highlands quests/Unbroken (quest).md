== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Earthcaller Yevaa}} within the [[Ruins of Drakgor]].

== Description ==
We are preparing a ritual that may be of use in destroying [[Iso'rath]], the [[old god]] bred abomination that the [[Twilight's Hammer]] have brought up from the depths. We are delayed though, for one of our strongest was captured during an assault on their encampment.

Earthcaller Yevaa is within the ruins to the south. She is not dead. I am sure of it. Please, rescue her. If any of us is deserving of your aid, it is her.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Thank the elements that you've come. Did my brothers send you?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Pushing Back]] and [[Simple Solutions]] before heading out. Yevaa can be found inside what's left of the keep, guarded by [[Omak'Tul]], a level 84 ogre mage with 128,000 health, who is preparing to sacrifice her. Kill him and talk to her.
