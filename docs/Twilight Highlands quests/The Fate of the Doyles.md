== Objectives ==
Return the news of [[Doyle clan|Clan Doyle]] to {{NPC||Iain Firebeard}} at the [[Firebeard Cemetery]].

== Description ==
It seems the Doyles already joined their last fight. Iain will want to know of this.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|31|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
That's a right shame. Stubborn as they were to speak to, they were just as stubborn in a fight. Would've been good to have 'em.

Once this is done, we'll have to send some boys out to bring them back for a proper send off.

== Notes ==
Ouch. Complete the [[Clan Mullan]] and [[Firebeard Bellows]] chains before returning to Iain. Mullan can be found just to the northwest, by the Crucible of Carnage, while Firebeard is due north, on the other side of the [[Devouring Rift]] from [[Firebeard Watch]].

==Progression==
{{Firebeard's Patrol}}
