== Objectives ==
Safeguard 5 Vermillion Menders as they heal wounded dragons.
*{{NPC||Vermillion Mender}}s Defended x5

== Description ==
Our [[dragon]]s are returning from battle covered in Twilight corrupted flame and pursued by [[Twilight drake]]s.

My menders can tend to our dragons' wounds, but they must be defended. Keep the drakes off of my menders. Lend your healing to our dragons as well if you are able.

Thank you for your help with this. Our battles for [[Grim Batol]] are never-ending. We need to get our strongest dragons back into the battle as soon as possible.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Flashseal Sandals|Vermillion Belt|Safeguard Spaulders}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Keep the menders safe as they heal our wounded dragons!

== Completion ==
We will take Grim Batol back from the [[Twilight's Hammer]] and thier{{sic}} allies. It may take time, but this is one charge that we cannot forsake.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Life from Death]] before heading out. Circle the area looking for a named dragon that is wounded and actively getting healed. Defend the menders until the dragon is fully healed. Twilight Wyrmkillers will attack the menders. Kill the wyrmkillers and then reclaim their corpses. Heal the dragon to speed the process, if possible.
