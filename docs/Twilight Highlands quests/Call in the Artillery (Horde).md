==Objectives==
Use the Artillery Flare to target the Northern, Northeastern, Southwestern, and Southern buildings at the [[Twilight Gate]].
*Northern building targeted
*Northeastern building targeted
*Southwestern building targeted
*Southern building targeted
*[[Artillery Flare#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
A pity that we're no longer allowed to drop the Plague on our enemies. It would prove quite effective in this situation. Oh well, at least we have war machines to destroy their precious gates.

I want you to take this flare. Use it to mark each of the four buildings within the Twilight Gate to the northwest. The war machines will handle the rest.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Buildingblast Bracers|Smokeflare Chestguard|Gatecrasher Shoulderguards}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

==Progress==
We need those buildings to be marked if our bombardment is to be effective.

==Completion==
I must say that I rather enjoyed the sight of their buildings being hit.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ogres & Ettins (Horde)|Ogres & Ettins]] and [[Kor'kron Drop]] before heading out.

Hop on a flying mount, talk to Jon-Jon, and head in. Quickly drop off the Kor'kron assassins by reaching the drop point, marked by a red X on the ground, at {{co|39.2|64.5|Twilight Highlands}} on the northern part of the gate. Then start killing and marking. The flares can be used outside of the buildings, which is a nice change.
