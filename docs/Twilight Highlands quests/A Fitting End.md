== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Obsidian [[wyrmkin]].
*Obsidian Dragonkin slain x10

== Description ==
The Obsidian wyrmkin litter the landscape to our south. They're in no position to push back against us, but one can never tell what new threats the ebb of battle may bring.

I want you to take the fight to the wyrmkin. Clear them out so that we may proceed with purging this land of the polluting presence of the [[black dragonflight]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
There is more that must be done...

== Completion ==
You've proven a great ally. I would have never expected such upon our first meeting.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Blackout (Twilight Highlands)|Blackout]] and [[Shining Through the Dark]] before heading out. Dragonspawn on the ground. Drakes up in the air. Kill [[Obsidian Viletongue]]s and [[Obsidian Charscale]]s.

==Progression==
{{Vermillion Redoubt}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
