== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Kurdran Wildhammer]] at [[Victor's Point]].

== Description ==
You've more than proved your intent and your abilities. With [[Grim Batol]] cut off and the black dragons routed, the [[Twilight's Hammer]] are cornered in their Citadel.

Go to your leaders. You should find them northwest, at Victor's Point. Let them know that when the attack on the Twilight Citadel begins, the red flight shall fill the skies above. You may not be able to atone for all of the sins your allies have committed, but in this one battle, we shall be by your side.

The Twilight's Hammer will fall.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|35}} (or {{cost|4|13|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
You've done well, <name>. We're in the process of preparing the attack now.

== Notes ==
To the northwest of the Dunwald Ruins and the Crucible of Carnage. Pick up the flight path.

==Progression==
{{Twilight Gate}}
