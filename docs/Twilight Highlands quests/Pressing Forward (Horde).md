== Objectives ==
Bring the [[Gob Squad]] past the northern Dragonmaw Gate to the entrance of [[Grim Batol]].

If you are separated from the Gob Squad, return to [[Warlord Krogg]] in [[Wyrms' Bend]] to be reassigned.
* Grim Batol entrance secured

== Description ==
Good work so far. We should find the entrance to Grim Batol just past the next gate.

I was ordered to secure the entrance and block off reinforcements while the rest of our men press through the path we've cleared up the canyon. I'm thinking if we get there soon enough, maybe I can let Ticker have a little more fun.

Let's get moving down the canyon to the southwest - we should find the next gate pretty quickly.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Squadron Leader's Gloves|Gate-Breaker Treads|Cloak of Valorous Direction}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Completion ==
The gate is clear. Once your people finish clearing the canyon, we will speak to your leaders about the next move.

== Notes ==
Keep running to the southwest along the road to reach Calen, standing at the foot of Alexstrasza! The squad will run off first:
:{{text|say|Ticker|See you around!}}
:{{text|say|Patch|Good working with you.}}
:{{text|say|Newt|I kind of like you. Try not to get killed out there.}}
Get closer to Calen:
:{{text|say|Calen|<Name>! I'm glad you made it.}}
