== Objectives ==
Check the cellar {{NPC||Eoin Dunwald}} mentioned for a keg.
*[[Sacred Wildhammer Ale]]

== Description ==
Look, buddy. Either you're here to help me find some drink, or you're in the way.

Why don't ya go down to the old storehouse and look downstairs. I had a mighty suspicion that ol' bookkeeper up in there was sneaking sips between pages. I bet he has a keg in his basement!

If ya find anything, come straight back to me! No dallyin'... this is urgent!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Aledrinker Shoulderpads|Brewtaster Bracers|Keg-Sized Chestplate}}
You will also receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
You stink of sober! Find me some drink!

== Completion ==
Donnely's belly! That's more like it. Good to not be dyin' of the thirst again.

Here, have some. Good ol Eoin's never so impolite as ta not share!

== Notes ==
Fly back to the ruins. At {{co|52.5|70.3|Twilight Highlands}} north of the road just outside the building is a sign:
: Wildhammer Ale Inside. Private Stash.
Intriguing. Head inside to find another:
: Ale downstairs. Do not touch. Sincerely, not the bad guys.

Well, that second sign looks trustworthy. It clearly said "not the bad guys"! So, head downstairs.

It's a trap! Three Twilight Shadeprowlers step out of the shadows.
:{{text|say|Twilight Shadowprowler|You're ours now, <race>.}}
:''Suddenly, Eoin jumps in the fray!''
:{{text|yell|Eoin|Keep your hands of me ale, ya unclean pint-hatin' mongrels!}}
:''Eoin one-shots the prowlers near him. Seeing this, one shadeprowler makes a run for it!''
:{{text|yell|Eoin|An' where you think you're goin', sonny?!}}
:''Eoin takes off after him.''
Clean up the area and then loot one of the Sacred Ale Taps. Eoin is upstairs, standing over the corpse of the runner.
