== Objectives ==
Collect the four heads of [[Za'brox]] and [[Beeble'phod]].
*[[Za's Head]]
*[[Phod's Head]]
*[[Beeble's Head]]
*[[Brox's Head]]

== Description ==
Now while the attack upon the [[Twilight Gate]] is launched, there is one last loose end to tie up: Za'brox and Beeble'phod, the disciples of [[Cho'gall]].

Intelligence has placed them within the [[Den of the Disciples]], a small ogre cave at the southwest corner of the Twilight Gate.

You're fairly certain that [[Lady Cozwynn]] and [[Zaela]] will want proof of their deaths.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Spaulders of Gruesome Glory|Za'brox's Lucky Tooth|Skull Carrier}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Is that blood dripping from your pack? I hope that it's not yours.

== Completion ==
<The noble lady grins wickedly.>

That's quite a gruesome trophy collection you have there. I would have believed you if you had simply said they were dead, though I do appreciate the extra effort. Thank you for having the foresight to take care of them.

The Twilight Gate will soon be ours. Time to move up to the [[Twilight Citadel]].

== Notes ==
The mouth of the cave can be found at {{co|39.9|71.3|Twilight Highlands}} to the southwest. Both ogre magi are level 85 with 154k health. Enter, take the north fork, kill [[Beeble'phod]], loot his two heads, turn around, take the west fork, kill [[Za'brox]], loot his two heads and return to [[Crushblow]].
