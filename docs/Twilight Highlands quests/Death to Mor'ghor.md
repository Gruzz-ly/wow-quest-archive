* [[Warchief Mor'ghor]] slain

==Description==
The time has come. Mor'ghor dies today.

Be warned, <class>. Demon blood courses through his wretched veins, and he channels unnatural power. He will be destroyed, yes. But it will not be an easy wfight.

You remember where Mor'ghor resides, at the top of the camp. I will meet you there. Finish him!

Be sure to recruit 3 Dragonmaw followers if you are short - you will need our help.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Merchant-Rise Shoulderguards
|Helm of Furious Uprising
|Treads of the Common Man
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18}}
*15910 [[XP]]
*+1750 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonmaw Clan]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! You have done the Horde proud in my absence.

The Dragonmaw have joined us, with Zaela as their new leader. Blood was shed, but casualties were low, and we have their complete loyalty.

Our Horde grows stronger!
