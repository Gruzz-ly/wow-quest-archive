== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Subjugated Firestarters.
*[[Subjugated Firestarter]] slain (8)

== Description ==
I've got boys formin' defensive lines on all sides of the town, keepin' back the [[fire elemental|elementals]] streaming from the torn ground. They're good lads and they've been holding firm, but even the sturdiest dwarf tires eventually.

They're split into shifts: on hour of rest for every hour on the line. Best I can get'm with the men we have.

If you want to be helpin', pick a line and take up a shift. Give some of my boys a welcome breather. Report back in once you've killed several of the elementals.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
Don't be dallyin'. These men are pourin' every fiber of their bein' into holding this town, and I'll not see them insulted by the presence of anyone that won't hold their weight.

== Completion ==
Good work, <boy/girl>. Good to have another capable set of hands about.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Only Homes We Have]] and [[Small Comforts]] before heading out

==Progression==
{{Firebeard's Patrol}}

== Patch changes ==
