[[File:Highlands Clucker.jpg|thumb|Highlands Clucker]]
Collect 100 Saber Flanks, 100 Worg Meat, and 100 Clucker Tidbits.
*[[Saber Flank]] (100)
*[[Worg Meat]] (100)
*[[Clucker Tidbits]] (100)
*[[Enlarging Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
It sounds like the [[peon]]s are feeling undervalued. They do important work for the [[Horde]], but their diligence is often overlooked. A little goodwill would go a long way.

Let's plan a feast in their honor. We'll need quite a bit of meat to sate their enormous appetites, luckily, I have a totem that can help with that.

You acquire the ingredients, and I will make a meal guaranteed to boost morale.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Did you bring the meat?

==Completion==
We'll be eating well tonight, <name>.

==Notes==
Upon accepting A Little Goodwill, [[Worthwhile Repairs]], and [[Peon Promotions!]]:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|We have to do what we can to appease the peons.}}

Look for [[Highland Worg]]s, [[Twilight Prowler]]s, and [[Highlands Clucker]]s in the [[Dunwald Ruins]] area. While they can be killed as they are, doing so will only yield about 1 piece of meat per kill. Plant the [[Enlarging Totem]] on the ground near them to massively increase their size and the amount of meat they drop.
