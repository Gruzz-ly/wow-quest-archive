== Objectives ==
Collect a bolt of Fine Dark Cloth.
*[[Fine Dark Cloth]]

== Description ==
Everyone's going to want to dress their best for this, and finery is in short supply in the Highlands.

I understand that those goblin wretches off the coast use the finest silk for repairing their [[zeppelin]] air envelopes. A waste!

Find a zeppelin flying back and forth between [[Dragonmaw Port]] and the [[Krazzworks]], and liberate some silk from the cargo hold in the lower decks.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
How did the air raid go?

== Completion ==
Oh, aye! Kilts for the gents, gowns for the bridesmaids.

Just don't tell the ladies they're wearing clothes fit for a blimp.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Something Bold]], [[Something Brewed]] and [[Something Stewed]] before heading out.

A small zeppelin spawns at the Krazzworks and flies a clockwise path down to the Dragonmaw Port and back up to the Krazzworks. Catch up to it and land on the lower deck on the stern. Two crates of cloth are inside, guarded by two level 83 Krazzworks Sky Marshalls.

==Progression==
