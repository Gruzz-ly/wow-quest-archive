== Objectives ==
Gather 10 Wildhammer Food Stores from the [[Thundermar Ruins]].
*[[Wildhammer Food Stores]] (10)

== Description ==
Supplies are short, <name>. We've got refugees coming into [[Thundermar]] from up and down the ridge - that's a lot of mouths to feed.

Plenty of food stores were left behind as people pulled their families to safety. We need that food!

Scour the Thundermar ruins south, east, and southwest of here for food stores.

Careful, <class>! The fighting around the ruins is pretty intense.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Got some eats?

== Completion ==
It's good - hardly a worm or weevil to be found!

This is a lifesaver to the folk who fled here for survival.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dragonmaw Takedown]] and [[Fight Like a Wildhammer]] before heading out. Food stores in various forms are everywhere.

==Progression==
{{A Coward's Due}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Hotfix|date=2010-12-15|bluenote=The amount of Wildhammer Food Stores required to complete the quests ha been reduced to 10, down from 15.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
