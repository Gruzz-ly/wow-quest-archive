== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Rok'tar]] at the [[Twilight Shore (Twilight Highlands)|Twilight Shore]]s in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
Our new arrangement with the Horde will put my people in direct conflict with the Alliance.

Bring. Them. On.

As we speak, the Alliance moves up the peninsula to threaten [[Dragonmaw Port]].

Find Rok'tar to the south - I believe he has set up a command post on one of the shipwrecks - and ensure that the Twilight Shores remain in our control.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|50}}

== Completion ==
Good timing, <class>. We were just about to unleash a counter-attack.

== Notes ==
Rok'tar is found on a ship on the shore, at {{coords|78.24|62.54|Twilight Highlands}}
