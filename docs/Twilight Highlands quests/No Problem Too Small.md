==Objectives==
Meet [[Kiro]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

==Description==
These problems might seem small, but they will eat away at the [[Horde]] overtime if they remain unaddressed.

We must offer our help.

The [[vulpera]] are skilled at solving problems, no matter their size.

I will investigate the outpost. [[Nisha]] and [[Meerah]] will see to the others.

Meet me in the Twilight Highlands when you're ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Abandoned, just like [[Commander Dresh]] said.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|Nisha, head for [[Zuldazar]] and do what you do best.}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Those [[naga]] won't know what hit 'em!}}
:{{Text|say|Kiro|Meerah, can you sort things out with the vintner in [[Suramar]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|You got it, Kiro!}}
:{{Text|say|Kiro|Good. Let's get to work.}}

Kiro, Nisha, and Meerah all run out of [[Grommash Hold]] and disappear. Outside, Meerah's wagon and [[alpaca]]s have vanished as well.

The fastest way to the Twilight Highlands from [[Orgrimmar]] is the portal at the [[Western Earthshrine]]. Once in the Highlands, head to the area north of [[Crushblow]] and east of the [[Twilight Gate]] to find Kiro and his mount [[Sasha (hyena)|Sasha]] at the bottom of a ruined tower with worker equipment scattered around.
