Now that you've lured [[Skullcrusher the Mountain]] away from the Twilight Gate, it's time to signal your forces at [[Crushblow]] to attack!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

==Completion==
The horns have been sounded. Crushblow should launch their attack at any moment.

Now there's only one thing left to take care of.
