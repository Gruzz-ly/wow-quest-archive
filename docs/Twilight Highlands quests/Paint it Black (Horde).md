== Objectives ==
Acquire a Black Diamond Heart.
* [[Black Diamond Heart]]

== Description ==
The ground bleeds, <class>. They tear it open, as one would gouge flesh.

These cultists relish their secrecy but the very elementals they use for their misdeeds can betray them. Seek out [[Obsidian Stoneslave]]s northeast of here, among the ruined earth we have named the [[Black Breach]].

Shatter their bodies and find for me a perfect heart of black diamond. I will look into this heart. And I will bare its soul.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Diamond Clutching Gloves
|Heartstone Treads
|Legplates of Riven Futures}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9}}

== Progress ==
The heart. A stone heart, of purest black. Have you found one?

== Completion ==
<Mallia removes her eyepatch and holds the black diamond before her empty eye socket.>

What have we, what have we - breaches, the breaches number three. Two heads, one wholly given to its master. I see the future. A hammer united. A mountain shattered. Oh - OH!

<Mallia drops the diamond to the floor, covering her face with her hands.>
