==Objectives==
Inform [[Foreman Magrok]] that the [[Horde]] is throwing a party for the [[peon]]s.
*Foreman Magrok invited

==Description==
I think I have everything needed to make tonight a success.

We just need to make sure the peons show up.

Tell their leader that the Horde is throwing a party in their honor.

I'm sure they won't decline a night of free food and drink.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}

==Completion==
It's a success, wouldn't you say?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|I'll make my way back to [[Crushblow]] and get things cooking.}}
:''Kiro mounts [[Sasha (hyena)|Sasha]] and rides off southwest.''

Return to the [[Peon Hideout]] and talk to Magrok.
:You'd better be here to help the peon's plight, otherwise--get out!
:{{Gossip|The Horde are throwing a party in your honor.}}
::{{Text|yell|Foreman Magrok|You hear that? The Horde's finally listening to us!}}
::{{Text|yell|Foreman Magrok|Party back at Crushblow! Let's go!}}
::''The [[Crushblow Peon]]s cheer. Magrok jumps down from his crate and runs out of the cellar with all of the peons in tow.''

Head to the now party-decorated Crushblow, where Magrok and his peons are enjoying tables filled with food. Talk to Kiro—who is standing next to the inn with Sasha—to turn in.
