== Objectives ==
Collect {{NPC||Magmalord Falthazar}}'s Head.
*[[Magmalord Falthazar's Head]]

== Description ==
I just heard the terrible news from the west - we've lost Humboldt's Stead. Wiped off the face of the planet in a wall of fire!

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] is to blame, and the survivors say it were the work of one Magmalord Falthazar. He's an [[Elemental ascendant|ascendant]] - that's what they call the highest echelon of Twilight's Hammer cultists who become one with the [[elemental|elements]]. He's a creature of pure fire.

And he'll soon be a creature of pure dead! Go kill Falthazar at the [[Humboldt Conflagration]] and bring me his head!

("Magmalord Falthazar: Seek him out in the center of the blaze.")

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Corruption Resistant Gloves|Flameproof Treads|Legplates of Cooled Magma}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
All these years ol' Humboldt throught his worst problems were from the Glopgut ogres up on the ridge. Then the Twilight's Hammer came.

In an instant, they set the whole valley ablaze like it were a birthday cake. Heartless.

== Completion ==
Aye, that's him. Can you believe this thing was human once?

That's the Twilight's Hammer for you. What they don't destroy, they corrupt.

Thank you, <class>.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Tempered in Elemental Flame]], [[Hot Stuff]], [[Potential Energy]] and [[A Vision of Twilight (Alliance)|A Vision of Twilight]] before heading out.

Northwest out of Thundermar to the conflagration. Falthazar is a level 84 ascendant with 128,000 health.
