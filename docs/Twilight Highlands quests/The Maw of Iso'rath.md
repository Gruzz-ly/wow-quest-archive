== Objectives ==
Mount a gryphon to join the attack on [[Iso'rath]].
*Join the assault on Iso'rath

== Description ==
We are ready to attack the beast. First, we need to destroy it's tentacles, then Yevaa will perform a ritual to summon a powerful fire elemental that we will drop into its maw.

I want you to fly out with our first group attack. Hold steady until an opportunity presents itself, then join the battle with the rest of the shaman in cutting the tentacles down.

Take any one of the gryphons when you're ready to join the assault.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
The tentacles swept us off of our gryphons as well! They were far more nimble than we anticipated.

No matter. We were prepared for this possibility. I can summon the elemental from here if you can keep me safe.

== Notes ==
Run about 30 yards to the southwest and hop on an [[Earthen Ring Gryphon]].

:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Watch those tentacles! Their reach is frightening.}}
:''A tentacle snags the player and drops it into the mouth of Iso'rath. Luckily, Mylra thinks quickly and casts a slow fall spell on the player.''
Speak to Yevaa, standing next to a few other members of the attacking party.
