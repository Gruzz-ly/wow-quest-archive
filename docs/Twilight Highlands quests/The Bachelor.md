== Objectives ==
Discuss marriage prospects with {{NPC||Keegan Firebeard}} at [[Kirthaven]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
We need to make this work, <name>. The answer is in the blood! Family bonds have kept these Wildhammer clans apart from one another. It'll take family bonds to glue 'em back together. It's a long shot, but we're going to have to play matchmaker!

I'll track down {{NPC||Colin Thundermar}} and talk with him. You're a smooth one - you should talk to Keegan Firebeard inside. He's sharp enough to understand a political marriage. Go find out if he fancies anyone!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|29}} at max level

== Completion ==
What? {{NPC||Kurdran Wildhammer||Kurdran's}} talkin' marriage!? Didn't he just see me an' ol' Thunderface tearing each other new ones?

The only eligible Thundermar is {{NPC||Fanny Thundermar||Fanny}}. Now, I'll give you this, she's got the looks allright. All lumpy in the right places, if you hear me. But she's not got that somethun' somethun' a Firebeard looks for in a woman, right?

== Notes ==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Keegan|Here, what's this?}}
:''Cliff runs into the room.''
:{{text|yell|Cliff Thundermar|Haaaaaalp!}}
:{{text|say|Cliff|The Glopgut ogres stormed Thundermar while Colin was here at the summit. They kidnapped Fanny and ran for the hills!}}
:{{text|say|Cliff|Colin is massing the Thundermar for a full-on assault of [[Glopgut's Hollow]].}}
