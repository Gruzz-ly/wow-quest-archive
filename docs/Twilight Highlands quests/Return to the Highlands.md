==Objectives==
Use the [[Twilight Highlands]] Portal in [[Orgrimmar]] to return to [[Dragonmaw Port]] in the Twilight Highlands and speak to [[Zaela]].

==Description==
With Orgrimmar secure and our [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] allies behind us, we can turn our attention to the conquest of the Twilight Highlands and the utter destruction of [[Deathwing]]'s forces there.

I need the Horde's best on the front lines. That means you. And all your friends.

The Highlands WILL be ours!

Use the new portal you created to return to Dragonmaw Port. Report to Zaela to see where she needs you the most.

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*1270 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
<name>! I trust Orgrimmar fares well?

As you can see, construction of Dragonmaw Port continues at a breakneck pace. If my people questioned the Horde's power before... the sight of this imposing edifice and the speed in which it was constructed leaves no doubt.

A new day dawns for the Dragonmaw.
