== Objectives ==
Slay 10 Shaman of the Black.
* [[Shaman of the Black]] slain (10)

== Description ==
<The eye speaks to you, its 'voice' reverberating as if coming from everywhere at once.>

You seek my sight, <race>? My powers come at a price. These disciples of the twilight have been honoring me with the blood of [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]] dwarves from the nearby ruins, but still I thirst. Perhaps you can do better.

Slay my old masters, and my vision is yours. Honor me with the slaughter of the Shaman of the Black. Blood is blood, after all.

== Progress ==
I have been watching you, <race>.

==Completion==
<The Eye glimmers darkly, colors swirling about its dusky surface.>

Ah, the succulent thrill of life extinguished. Do you feel it, <class>? Do you relish it as I do?

No, I see not. You fight to protect the lives of others. Pity.
