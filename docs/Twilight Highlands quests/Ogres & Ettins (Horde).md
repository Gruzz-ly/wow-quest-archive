== Objectives ==
Slay 10 Bloodeye Clan ogres or ettins at the [[Twilight Gate]].
* Bloodeye Clan ogres & ettins slain  (10)

== Description ==
I want you to get in there past those boulders to the northwest at the Twilight Gate. Kill every Bloodeye Clan ogre and ettin in sight. Think you can handle that for me, <name>?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
There are more to be killed, <race>. You do have the stomach for that, yes?

== Completion ==
And here I thought that today couldn't get any better.

I enjoy being wrong, occasionally.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Call in the Artillery (Horde)|Call in the Artillery]] and [[Kor'kron Drop]] before heading out.

Hop on a flying mount, talk to Jon-Jon, and head in. Quickly drop off the Kor'kron assassins by reaching the drop point, marked by a red X on the ground, at {{co|39.2|64.5|Twilight Highlands}} on the northern part of the gate. Then start killing and marking.
