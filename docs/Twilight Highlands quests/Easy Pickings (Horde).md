==Objectives==
Kill 8 Twilight Spearwardens.
* [[Twilight Spearwarder]] slain (8)

==Description==
The ambush launched smoothly. Most of the guards are dead, but a few are still pinned down with the wagons.

You can see them just to our west, in the canyon below. Get in there and clear them out so we can get this attack on the move.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
* 69400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
There are still some guards left down there. Finish'm off.

==Completion==
Excellent. Now we can start pushing our ground forces up towards Grim Batol.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Precious Goods (Horde)|Precious Goods]] before heading out. Kill spearwarders until the key drops, then loot a chest, then go back to killing spearwarders to hit the quota.
