'''From Ashes to Wisdom''' concludes the fifth hidden local story of [[Guest Relations]], started on 12 November and required for [[Assistant to the Assistant Guest Relations Manager]].

==Objectives==
Show [[Voidfire]] the destruction of [[Deathwing]].
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* Lessons learned (0/100%)
* [[Whelpling Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
I will become the great and powerful Deathwing! Cower before my strength!

You there! Do you wish to join me, the next Deathwing, on an epic adventure?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
;Initial
Let's go to the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. I want to see volcanic destruction!

;Intermissions
I'm gonna be like Deathwing one day!

;After Burning Steppes
I want to leave a big bad scar on the world! Scars look cool, right?

;After Badlands
I want to get followers to do my bidding! Like a cult!

;After the Twilight Highlands
Flooding is cool and exciting and it won't cause destruction like fire does!

==Completion==
Ok, I guess burning things, flooding things, and forming [[cult]]s isn't as fun as it sounds... Everything that Deathwing affected is just desolate and not as fun afterwards.

I'll be more like [[Nozdormu]]! He's cool and has [[time travel]] stuff!

==Notes==
<onlyinclude>Speak with [[Voidfire]] again before taking off:
{{dialogue|Let's go to the Eastern Kingdoms. I want to see volcanic destruction!}}

Also check in with [[Maru]]:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain the case of Ashes to Wisdom to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Voidfire sounds like a bad dragon. He wants to go see volcanic destruction in da Eastern Kingdoms?

Tat sounds like da [[Burning Steppes]].}}

[[File:From Ashes to Wisdom - Burning Steppes.jpg|thumb|Voidfire at the Burning Steppes]]
Alliance characters should return to [[Stormwind]] and fly to the [[Burning Steppes]]. Horde characters should connect from the [[Orgrimmar]] portal to the [[Twilight Highlands]] or take the [[zeppelin]] to [[Northern Stranglethorn]], use a mage's [[Portal: Stonard]], rogues can use [[Scroll of Teleport: Ravenholdt]], or druids with [[Dreamwalk]] can connect through the [[Twilight Grove]]. Also consider using [[Direbrew's Remote]] which teleports the player character to the beginning of [[Blackrock Depths]], exit it and briefly run through the [[Grinding Quarry]] to the [[Molten Span]] of [[Blackrock Mountain]] where mounts are usable. The specific location for each zone will be visible on the zone map while in the zone.

When near the specific location:
{{Dialogue|
Yeah! Let's get a closer look.
}}

Head just east of the [[Ruins of Thaurissan]] at {{co|61.1|29.5|Burning Steppes}} and use the provided [[Whelpling Whistle]] to summon [[Voidfire]]:
:{{text|say|Voidfire|Yeah! So much FIRE!}}
:{{text|say|Voidfire|Buuurn!}}
:{{text|say|Voidfire|Why is it so dark and empty? I thought this would be more exciting.}}

Speak with the whelp:
{{dialogue|Why is it so dark and empty? I thought this would be more exciting.

{{gossip|This is what happens with fire and volcanic destruction. It leaves the area dark and barren.}}

Ok, but I want to leave a scar on the world! Scars look cool, right?}}

This adds 25% progress to the quest. Maru has a new hint:
{{dialogue|A scar on da world? The [[Badlands]] has somefing like tat.}}

[[File:From Ashes to Wisdom - Badlands.jpg|thumb|Voidfire at the [[Scar of the Worldbreaker]]]]
Fly directly north over the ridge into the Badlands and head to {{co|31.1|48.7|Badlands}} on the north rim of the [[Scar of the Worldbreaker]]:
:{{text|say|Voidfire|Whoa, this scar is HUGE!}}
:{{text|say|Voidfire|This isn't that bad, right? It just looks cool!}}

{{dialogue|This isn't that bad, right? It just looks cool!

{{gossip|This scar will not heal and will always serve as a reminder of Deathwing's wrath and the devastation he caused on the land and its inhabitants.}}

Fine, I get it. Maybe I can get followers to do my bidding. Yeah, they don't have to destroy things, they'll just do whatever I say! Like cultists!}}

This advances to 50% progress. Check in with Maru:
{{dialogue|There's a lot of meanie cultists in the [[Twilight Breach]]. Maybe if Voidfire sees them he'll change his mind!}}

[[File:From Ashes to Wisdom - Twilight Highlands.jpg|thumb|Voidfire at the [[Twilight Breach]]]]
Mount up and aim for the [[Bastion of Twilight]] off in the distance to the northeast in the [[Twilight Highlands]], then look at the map to travel to the Twilight Breach:
:{{text|say|Voidfire|Wait, these are cultists?}}
:{{text|say|Voidfire|Are they destroying things on Deathwing's orders?}}

{{dialogue|Are they destroying things on Deathwing's orders?

{{gossip|Even if you have followers, they won't always do what you want. Other cults may also form that will follow their own rules.}}

Ugh, ok, so no followers and no fire or volcanic destruction... What about water? Flooding is cool and exciting and it won't cause destruction like fire does!}}

This continues to progress the quest, now at 75%, and Maru has wisdom to share:
{{dialogue|There's a lot of places that were damaged by flooding. I can fink of one BIG flooded area.

What was it called? Vash somefing... and da Shimmering place...}}

[[File:From Ashes to Wisdom - Shimmering Expanse.jpg|thumb|Voidfire at the [[Quel'Dormir Gardens]]]]

Players can use the portals to [[Vashj'ir]] at the [[Eastern Earthshrine|Eastern]] and [[Western Earthshrine]]s, but it's also possible to just fly to [[Vashj'ir]], off the western coast of the Eastern Kingdoms, west of [[Dun Morogh]]. Maru mentioned the [[Shimmering Expanse]], so head there. The quest marker is at {{co|39.1|64.5|Shimmering Expanse}} on the eastern edge of the [[Ruins of Vashj'ir]] in [[Quel'Dormir Gardens]].
:{{text|say|Voidfire|See? Doesn't this look so cool?}}
:{{text|say|Voidfire|Everything is underwater and awesome!}}

{{dialogue|Everything is underwater and awesome!

{{gossip|This was once a thriving elven city. Many historical ancient structures have now been lost to the depths.}}

I guess being like Deathwing and destroying things isn't as cool as it sounded.

{{gossip|That's right.}}}}

This completes the quest.</onlyinclude>
