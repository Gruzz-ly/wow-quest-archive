== Objectives ==
Bring Forgehammer's weapons to {{NPC||Iain Firebeard}} at the [[Firebeard Cemetery]]
*[[Forgehammer Weapons]] (provided)

== Description ==
Cleaned up the camp and ran errands for Forgehammer? Not bad for a wee <Class>. Take these to Iain at Firebeard Cemetery, and he should reward you for a job well done.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Forge-Hold Gloves|Camp-Cleaner Chestguard|Weapon-Bearer Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|57|50}}

== Progress ==
What have we here?

== Completion ==
Hah! Looks like their raid went mighty well then. I'll have to buy ol' Forgehammer a round once we finish with this mess.

== Notes ==
Make sure to complete the [[Clan Mullan]] and [[Stubborn as a Doyle]] chains before returning to Iain. Mullan can be found to the southwest, near the [[Crucible of Carnage]]. Doyle is pretty much due south on the border with the [[Obsidian Forest]].
