*Speak to the Squad commander

== Description ==
Now that the attack is underway, it's time to deal with the [[Twilight Citadel]]. If you don't mind, I'd like for you to escort the SI:7 forces to [[Master Mathias Shaw]].

He's hiding somewhere up top. The SI:7 squad commander can tell you where.

Thank you, <name>. We look forward to joining you in the assault upon the Citadel!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Oh no!

== Notes ==
Back to the gate. At the base of the ramp leading up the hill, at {{co|38.9|64.0|Twilight Highlands}} is the SI:7 Squad Commander. Speak with him:
:Good to see you again, <name>. We snuck some more of us in here while you were prepping the Gates for the attack.
:I'll show you where we're to rendezvous with Master Shaw.
:<The squad leader produces a map of the Twilight Citadel and points to the spot.>
:Let me know when you're ready, and we'll all head up together.
{{gossip|''I'm ready, Commander, let's head up.''}}
:{{text|say|SI:7 Squad Commander|We should move out, <name>. Up the ramp and then straight to Master Shaw.}}
:''A number of SI:7 agents appear and the squad stealths about halfway up the hill, when suddenly'':
:{{text|say|SI:7 Squad Commander|Wait! Do you hear something?}}
:{{text|say|SI:7 Squad Commander|Cho'gall!}}
:''Cho'gall teleports in to the top of the ramp!''
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Alliance soldiers! So bold, so cavalier. (Scurry, scurry, scurry, mortals.) Your numbers are small, and you are too late. (Helpless and hopeless, helpless and hopeless.)}}
:{{text|yell|SI:7 Squad Commander|Kill him!}}
:''The squad charges in!''
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|(Finish it! Finish them all!)}}
:''They are nigh-instantly killed by Cho'gall. The commander runs in and is thrown back down the hill, killing him as well.''
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Pathetic flesh!}}
:''Cho'gall teleports out.''
The quest automatically completes at this point.
