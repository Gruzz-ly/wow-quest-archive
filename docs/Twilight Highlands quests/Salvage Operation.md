== Objectives ==
Retrieve 8 Recovered Supplies from the Waterlogged Crates in the [[Obsidian Breakers]].
*[[Recovered Supplies]] (8)

== Description ==
Between the [[Horde]] and the [[naga]], our fleet has been decimated. We can't do anything to bring back the men who gave their lives to the sea, but sink me if I allow all of our supplies to be lost forever.

Swim out to the Obsidian Breakers southwest of [[Highbank]] and retrieve the supplies from the wrecks and the ocean floor.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
How much were you able to recover?

== Completion ==
Look at all of this! You were able to recover more than I thought. We can outfit a whole squad of [[marine]]s with this stuff.

We have the gear. If only we had some way to bolster our numbers here in the Highlands...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Naga Reinforcements]] before heading out. Then head southwest, jump in and go killing and collecting. Don't forget to come up for air!

While out at the breakers, players may run across {{NPC||Ephram Hardstone}}, a beached ship still mostly above water. He offers [[Siren's Song]]. Do it, as it's a one-off reference to the ''[[wikipedia:Odyssey|Odyssey]]'', then head back to Highbank.

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Highbank!}}
