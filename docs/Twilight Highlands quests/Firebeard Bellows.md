== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Mackay Firebeard}} at the [[Gorshak War Camp]].

== Description ==
I also need ya to seek out Mackay and his men on the other side of the [[Devouring Breach]], at the Gorshak War Camp.

The [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] didn't survive the initial onslaught, and Mackay's lookin' to ransack what he can of their camp to supply our fight. There shouldn't be much convincin' necessary, but they'll likely want a hand wrappin' things up there before they make their way back to Keegan.

Give'm a boot in the arse from ol' Iain if ya have to.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}}

== Completion ==
Bout that time, eh? Help us wrap things up then.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Clan Mullan]] and [[Stubborn as a Doyle]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{Firebeard's Patrol}}

== Patch changes ==
