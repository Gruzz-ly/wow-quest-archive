== Objectives ==
Slay Dame Alys Finnsson, Master Klem, and Mia the Rose.
* [[Dame Alys Finnsson]] slain
* [[Master Klem]] slain
* [[Mia the Rose]] slain

== Description ==
There are three candidates for Ascendancy that need to killing: Dame Alys Finnsson, Master Klem, and Mia the Rose.

I want you to serve as a distraction. When the time is right, I'll step in to finish them off from behind.

Just make sure that whatever you do, you don't underestimate them, <name>. Each of those lunatics got to where they are by being ruthless and very good at what they do.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Rose-Scented Hood|Dame's Scaled Greaves|Klem's Rusted Gauntlets}}
You will also receive: {{cost|18|80}} (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)

== Progress ==
They're not all dead yet now are they?

== Completion ==
That takes care of most of their leaders outside of the [[Bastion of Twilight|Bastion]]. Not bad work, <name>. Not bad at all.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Elementium Axe (Horde)|The Elementium Axe]] before heading out. First, head just to the southeast. In the center of a pit is Master Klem, a level 85 elite human warrior with 387k health. Aggro him, knock off 20% of his health and keep him still as Shaw will spawn 20 yards behind him and stealth up to him.
:{{text|yell|Master Klem|You've come for training. Good!}}
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|You're telegraphing your moves.}}
Garona, once she gets in range, will stunlock and finish Klem off. Head to the southeast next. Just south of [[Cannon's Inferno]] is a big twilight building with Mia the Rose inside. She is a level 85 elite night elf rogue with 387k health. Same as before, knock off at least 20% of her health before Garona will spawn. Pop trinkets and fight defensively, she hits hard.
:{{text|yell|Mia the Rose|I knew you were coming. No one can resist me, not even you!}}
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|That was great fun.}}
Blindeye is just to the west, at the [[Altar of Ascension]], so take a slight detour and kill him. He is a level 85 ettin with 154k health. Garona will not help out on this kill, however.

Finally, keep heading southwest. In the shadow of the Twilight Altar is a small building just to the west of it. Inside is Dame Alys Finnsson, a level 85 elite worgen druid with 387k health. She fights in cat form.
:{{text|yell|Dame Alys Finnsson|We could have been civil about this, but no!}}
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|Not bad, I guess.}}
