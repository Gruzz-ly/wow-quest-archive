*[[Eye of Twilight]] (provided)

== Description ==
Very well then, <race>. You have purchased my services in blood. Take me back to the "Low Shaman" of Thundermar.

Oh yes, I already know where you're taking me. Blundy's meager, ale-soaked abilities are trivial. But you - you fascinate me, <race>. With my sight and your abilities, imagine the havoc we could unleash into this pathetic world together...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|18}}

== Progress ==
You again? Wot? You bring me somethun'?

== Completion ==
You found one? A gen-u-ine Eye of Twilight? Lemme see.

Oh Gods. It's lookin' at me. It's lookin' right back!

I need a drink. Can you face that thing toward the wall or somethin'?

== Notes ==
Make sure to finish [[Potential Energy]] before heading back.
