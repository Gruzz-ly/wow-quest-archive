== Objectives ==
Peer into the Eye of Twilight for {{NPC||Low Shaman Blundy}}.
* Peered into the Eye

== Description ==
I'll be honest, <name>. That thing gives me the willy-willies. But seein' as you went to all the trouble of bringin' it here, I s'pose we ought to put it to use.

You first.

Peer into the eye and ask it to show you inside {{NPC||Cho'gall}}'s [[Bastion of Twilight]]. We'll find out what that fat two-headed bugger is up to, and use it against him.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Eye of Despair|Dark-Eye Ring}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|50}} (or {{cost|6|57|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Whad'ya see, <class>?

== Completion ==
What did you see, <name>? Cho'gall? Wait - he saw YOU!?

Oh aye, that wee sneaky eye! It looks both ways. That cheeky looker! Where's me hammer!?

== Notes ==
The Eye of Twilight is right next to Blundy. Interact with it.
:''The camera pulls in close to the eye, then suddenly, it sees the eye's duplicate on the other side of the zone. The camera pans over to a Twilight Servant who kneels in front of Cho'gall.''
:{{text|say|Twilight Servant|The Alliance has made landfall, master, and in great numbers upon the shore.}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|This changes nothing. (Nothing nothing changes. Crush them, crush.)}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|What of our agents in Stormwind? (Stormwind! The eye, the eye sees into the city heart.) Bring me the eye.}}
:''The servant cowers in fear.''
:{{text|say|Twilight Servant|Our agents have been outed and killed, master.}}
:''The servant runs off to the eye off screen and walks back with it.''
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|([[Blasphemy|Blaspheme]]! Blaspheme disgust hate hate...) No matter. Where one eye closes, another opens. (The Master sees all! The Master knows all!) We will know our enemy's hearts, for they are weak. The eye. Now.}}
:''The servant places the matching Eye of Twilight in front of Cho'gall.''
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|The shadow of the Master covers this world... (Darkness, all darkness.) Our enemies fight one another, across the Highland. Fools. (Blood, blood.) WAIT! There is another!}}
:''The camera pulls in close to Cho'gall.''
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|A mortal dares peer into the eye! (Brave little plaything.) I see you, little one! You want to see what the Eye sees, do you? (Show it! Show it all!)}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|Behold the chaos to come. (Madness, madness, bliss!) Do you like what you see mortal?}}
:''The camera pulls back, out of the building and pans around to show an [[ettin]], then looks over the ettin's shoulder up at the [[Bastion of Twilight]] itself, with some twilight dragons circling it, then keeps panning around to show a [[gronn]], who strikes at the camera. The vision ends. As the player regains its senses back at Thundermar...''
:{{text|whisper|Voice of Cho'gall|(The master sees you! He sees! He sees! He wants! Wants wants...)}} ''This is voiced as "He wants and wants and wants!"''
On complete:
:{{text|say|Low Shaman Blundy|Quit lookin' at me, ya big purple eye-face! Ah, blast it all, <name>.}}
:''The eye explodes and disappears.''
