== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Glopgut ogres (either {{NPC||Glopgut Pounder}}s or {{NPC||Glopgut Hurler}}s).
* Glopgut Ogre Slain x10

== Description ==
Glopgut ogres! I'd say they was dumb as a sack of hammers, but I have more respect for me hammers than that.

We've fought off their raids for years, but if they're bold enough to steal one of our own, we're gonna have to learn them a lesson.

Help us smack around some Glopgut ogres! Kill their pounders or hurlers, either out here or - better - inside the cave. That'll show 'em.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Walp? Got a few more notches on yer weapon to show off?

== Completion ==
Har! My men could learn a lot by watching you work. Well done.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Find Fanny]] before heading out. Head immediately to the northwest to enter the ogre den guarded by a Glopgut Warhound, then go killing. There aren't going to be enough ogres in the cave, but no matter. Get to the back of the cave for the Find Fanny event, then head back to the surface and kill to get to ten.
