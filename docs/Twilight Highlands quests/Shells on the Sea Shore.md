== Objectives ==
Gather 8 Unexploded Mortar Shells along the beach at [[Slithering Cove]].
* [[Unexploded Mortar Shell]] (8)

== Description ==
I salvaged these mortars from the wreck of our airship when she detonated above [[Dragonmaw Port]]. But ammunition is in short supply!

While you're running along the beach, do me a favor and pick up any unexploded mortar shells you find.

Unexploded shells are the best kind - you never know WHEN they're going to go off. Perfect for surprising an enemy!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*55200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Do you have the shells? Hand them here!

...Gently!

== Completion ==
Oh yeah. YEAH! These are DEFINITELY going to kill somebody.

Probably naga.
