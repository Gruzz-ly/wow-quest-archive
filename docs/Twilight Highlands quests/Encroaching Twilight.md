== Objectives ==
Kill 12 Twilight invaders within the [[Vermillion Redoubt]].
*Twilight invaders slain x12

== Description ==
Fragile Twilight invaders litter the redoubt. They're pouring in from somewhere to the west.

There can be no mercy offered to them within this hallowed place. Whatever violence grips your moral heart, release it upon them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
It was inevitable I suppose. We've kept them out for far longer than I thought we could. They were sure to find a way in eventually.

== Completion ==
You have a talent for killing I see. In times like these, that has its place.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Breach in the Defenses]] and [[Far from the Nest]] before heading out.

Head to the northwest. In the northwest corner of the redoubt is a twilight spire encircling a tree near the back of the valley. Just south of it, at {{co|18.0|16.9|Twilight Highlands}} is a mouth of a cave with a [[Twilight Portal]] inside it. Plant the seed to destroy it. Kill Twilight Abductors and loot the eggs they drop on the ground.

==Progression==
{{Vermillion Redoubt}}
