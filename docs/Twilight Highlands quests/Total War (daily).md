== Objectives ==
Smash 10 Thundermar Ale Kegs within the Thundermar Ruins.
* Wildhammer Kegs Smashed (10)

== Description ==
Some of the Wildhammer still cling to the hope of reclaiming the Thundermar Ruins to the north, across the river. Burn them out! Smash open kegs of Thundermar Ale. That wicked brew is potent enough to explode when set aflame.

Don't ask me why.

And don't ask me how they drink the stuff.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} ({{cost|13|15|50}} at 85)

== Completion ==
Yes, yes. Burn them out, as you would flush groundhogs from their holes...

Well done, <name>.

== Notes ==
When blowing up the kegs, any nearby Wildhammer dwarf will aggro, so clear the area before getting unwanted adds. This can prove deadly in combination with [[Bring Down the High Shaman]].

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
