==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Lieutenant Fawkes}} at [[Highbank]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

==Description==
Right then, just hop in the [[Flintlocke's Seaplane|seaplane]] behind me and I'll fly yeh to the Highlands.

We're to report to a feller named "Lieutenant Fawkes." I've promised {{NPC||Varian Wrynn||the King}} we'd get there lickety-fast, so I took the liberty of ditchin' any excess weight. Like seatbelts. Parachutes. Maps. Stabilizers. Landing gear.

I never actually "land" these things anyways.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|45000}} (or {{coppercost|65750}} at max level)

==Completion==
You two are the last thing I expected to see fall from the sky. Highbank is under attack!

==Notes==
Hop on the seaplane.
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|Yep! Off we go.}}
:''Fargo sets off through Stormwind. The engine stalls and the plane nearly flies into the wall of the harbor!''
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|Easy ... does it...}}
:''Fargo flies for the pass between the harbor and the canal district, nearly crashing into the wall above before dropping down into the tunnel, and makes a wide turn over the mage district bearing toward the keep.''
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|Right then. I hate long plane rides. So I'mma gonna kick in the after-market burners and ignite our entire fuel supply in one go.}}
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|Whatever yeh do... Don't. Black. Out!}}
:''Flintlocke kicks in the afterburners over the trade district and rockets northward. The player does wind up passing out, however. The next thing the player is aware of is hearing a crash. The player opens its eyes to see the burning seaplane jammed between the mast and crow's nest of an [[Destroyer#Human destroyer|icebreaker]]! Sitting up, the player looks over to the left and sees Fargo looking at it, somewhat sheepishly.''
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|Oh, like you coulda done any better.}}
Talk to Fawkes. Welcome to Highbank!
