== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Colin Thundermar}} in [[Thundermar]].

== Description ==
We may be safe here, but there are still a lot of Wildhammer who could still use support. Our wing can offer that, but we need to keep bolsterin' our forces if we're going to clear the Twilight completely.

I'm going to have words with Colin Thundermar. Only a coward turns down the callin' of his people, especially in a time this dire.

Go to Thundermar, find Colin and get a real explanation out of'm. I won't be putting up with cowardice in a Wildhammer leader.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|50}} (or {{cost|6|57|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Here here, WOT!? He calls ME a COWARD!?

Just like a Firebeard, all hot air and not a lick of sense. I've been bearing the brunt of a Dragonmaw invasion from the south, much of Thundermar is in ruins, and do any of the other clans step up to help? NO! Ol' Thundermar is on his own he is, and you'd better believe I'm usin' everything in my arsenal to stem the tide.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dunwalds Don't Die]] before heading out. They're in opposite directions, though.

Fly to the northwest.

Colin's gossip text:
:Curse the Dragonmaw!
:They kill our birds, attack our families, take our land. Even as the world crashes down around us, still they assault our homes.
:If your Alliance wants the help of the Wildhammer, there's only one way to win us over: Stop. The. Dragonmaw.
