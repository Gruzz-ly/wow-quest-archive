== Objectives ==
Gather 8 slabs of Fresh Venison and 5 Worg Ribs.
*[[Fresh Venison]] x8
*[[Worg Rib]] x5

== Description ==
Finally, we're going to need a feast. And none of that "finger food" stuff! This crowd wants meat, and lots of it.

Gather up venison from Highland elk and does. Highland worg are good eatin' too - bring back some ribs. We'll show you a feast like you've never had in all the [[Eastern Kingdoms]], friend.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
What's the food situation, <name>?

== Completion ==
Lookat that! You're practically bent double under the weight of all that meat. I'd better get my people cooking.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Something Bold]], [[Something Brewed]] and [[Something Stolen]] before heading out. Southeast of Thunderstrike Mountain on the high bluff is an area full of elk and worg. Go hunting.
