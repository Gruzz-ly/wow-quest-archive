== Objectives ==
Bring your squad past the northern Dragonmaw Gate to the entrance of [[Grim Batol]].

If you are separated from your squad, return to [[Master Mathias Shaw]] in [[Wyrms' Bend]] to be reassigned.
* Grim Batol entrance secured

== Description ==
Good work so far.

We should find the entrance to Grim Batol just past the next gate. I was ordered to secure the entrance and block off reinforcements while the rest of our men press through the path we've cleared up the canyon.

Let's get moving down the canyon to the southwest - we should find the next gate pretty quickly.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gatesmashing Gauntlets|Commander's Stompers|Cloak of Grand Leadership}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Completion ==
The gate is clear. Once your people finish clearing the canyon, we will speak to your leaders about the next move.

== Notes ==
Keep running to the southwest along the road to reach Calen, standing at the foot of Alexstrasza! The troops will run off first:
:{{text|say|Highbank Demolitionist|See you around!}}
:{{text|say|Highbank Lieutenant|Good working with you.}}
:{{text|say|Highbank Medic|I kind of like you. Try not to get killed out there.}}
Get closer to Calen:
:{{text|say|Calen|<Name>! I'm glad you made it.}}
