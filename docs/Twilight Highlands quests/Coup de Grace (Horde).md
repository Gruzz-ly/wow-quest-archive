== Objectives ==
Deliver a Coup de Grace on 5 [[Twilight Skyterror]]s.
* Coup de Grace delivered x5

== Description ==
Look at that. [[Lirastrasza]]'s destroying them!

There are still drakes that she's downing that need finishing off, <name>. We don't want the stinking Twilight healers to get them back up into the air.

Time for a little Coup de Grace.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Throat-Slitter Gauntlets|Lifecrusher Treads|Redistributed Signet}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
That's all? I think that you can finish off a few more.

== Completion ==
Good thing that you and [[Warlord Krogg]] made friends with the red dragons.

== Notes ==
Lira is circling the citadel complex, knocking skyterrors out of the sky. Finish them off. If players have not done [[Help from the Earthcaller (Horde)|Help from the Earthcaller]], now is the time, as Garona will not offer more quests until players do Yevaa and Goldmine's quests.

==Progression==
{{Twilight Gate}}
