== Objectives ==
Travel to the [[Gullet]] and speak with [[Zaela]]. Kill Torth.
* [[Torth]] slain

== Description ==
[[Narkrall Rakeclaw|Narkrall]]'s drake Torth survived the failed attack on [[Thundermar]], and now the creature is free from his former master.

Torth seeks vengeance against the Dragonmaw, and has already strafed [[Bloodgulch]] once. He will keep returning until we skewer him for good. It is time to put the [[The Demon Chain|Demon Chain]] to work.

Torth's old nest is a small cave in the hills west of here that we have turned into a small camp called "The Gullet."

Meet me at the Gullet and we will finish Torth off.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bastion-Clearing Leggings
|Gauntlets of Dragonwrath
|Clear-Eyed Waistguard
|Torth-Slayer's Staff
|Mace of the Gullet}}
You will also receive: {{cost|18}}

== Completion ==
Once free of the chain, Torth died rather than submit again. I admire the creature. I will have his hide fashioned into a set of armor.

This much is clear to me now: The Dragonmaw cannot stand alone if the Alliance backs the [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]]. Narkrall proved that. And you have proven the might of the Horde, again and again.

I will rebuild our drake wings and take up position outside the Bastion of Twilight. You should continue to help out here in the Gullet and elsewhere in the [[Twilight Highlands|Highlands]].

== Notes ==
Speak with Zaela at {{coords|36.42|38.12|Twilight Highlands}} to start fighting Torth.

:{{text|say|Zaela|Keep fighting, <class>! The Demon Chain will eventually win out.}}
:{{text|say|Torth|I ... will not ... serve!}}
:{{text|say|Zaela|Then you will die.}}
:{{text|say|Zaela|So be it. It is done.}}
