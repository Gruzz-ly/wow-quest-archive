==Objectives==
Speak with Kalecgos to fly to the [[Vermillion Redoubt]], locate Alexstrasza and discover the source of the threat.
* Speak with [[Kalecgos]]
* [[Alexstrasza]] reached
* Threat discovered
* [[Vexiona]] confronted
* [[Lost Scale of the Scarlet Broodmother]]
* Ride [[Corastrasza]] to [[Silithus: The Wound|Silithus]] (optional)
*Meet Alexstrasza in the Chamber of Heart.

==Description==
It is unlike Alexstrasza to remain out of contact for so long, particularly when the very essences of the [[dragonflight]]s' power are being made manifest. 

While our allies here tend to the injured, we must seek out the Life-Binder at once.

When you are ready, we shall ride to the Vermillion Redoubt together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]
*[[Tempered Scale of the Scarlet Broodmother]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (1,800x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
We must rely on your aid once more, champion.

==Completion==
We owe you a great deal of gratitude. You have the support of the [[red dragonflight]] in your efforts to save [[Azeroth]].

==Notes==
;Speaking with Kalecgos
:Our journey continues.
:{{Gossip|I'm ready to travel to the Vermillion Redoubt.}}

You queue for the Essence of the Red Dragon scenario. (The Kalimdor [[loading screen]] shows.)

:''A scene plays, Alexstrasza is surrounded by twilight dragons. The player is riding the [[Azure Skywing]] who is shot down. [[Vermillion Sentinel]]s, [[Vermillion Mender]]s, and [[Vermillion Flamelash]]es are fighting enemies. Kalecgos is in the air, freezing enemies.''

*Meet Alexstrasza atop the Vermillion Redoubt

:{{Text|yell|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|This battle is far from over. I can sense their leader drawing near.}}

:{{Gossip|Whatever happens, I stand by your side, Life-Binder.}}

===Stage 3 - Stemming the Corruption===
*Free the corrupted drakes atop the Vermillion Redoubt.
*Vermillion Sentinels rescued (5)

:{{Text|yell|Vexiona|Life-Binder. Give in to the whispers. Join us and you will be granted power beyond measure.}}
:{{Text|yell|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Never!}}
:{{Text|yell|Kalecgos|Alexstrasza and I will focus on Vexiona. Do what you can to save the captives!}}
:{{Text|yell|Vexiona|Behold the future of all dragonflights. United as one. You will see the truth as I have, sister.}}
:{{Text|yell|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You are not my sister.}}

===Stage 4 - Take to the Skies!===

===Final Stage - From the Shadows===
*Confront Vexiona outside of [[Grim Batol]].
*Vexiona confronted

:''[[Dragonmaw Pass]], [[Wyrm's Bend]], and the Grim Batol area is taken by the twilight dragonflight are a battlefield. On the other end, the sentinels and flamelashes guard the entrance to the [[Wetlands]].''
:{{Text|yell|Vexiona|Why do you resist, sister? Do you not see the grand destiny that awaits our kind?}}
:{{Text|yell|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|The power you were promised will not protect you from me!}}
:{{Text|yell|Kalecgos|There is but one way this can end, <name>. Prepare for a fight.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|There she is. Now we finish this.}}
:{{Text|yell|Vexiona|So be it. If you will not join us, then you will be reduced to empty husks.}}
:''Alexstrasza and Kalecgos are entrapped in Twilight Stasis.''

:{{Text|yell|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Your master will lead you to nothing but ruin.}}

Kill the corruptor to free the Aspects.

:{{Text|yell|Kalecgos|Enough! This madness ends now!}}
:{{Text|yell|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|The Aspects stand in defense of this world!}}
:''The Aspects shot at Vexiona, destroying her shield.''

:{{Text|yell|Vexiona|This is not possible! I just need... more power!}}
:{{Text|yell|Vexiona|Your pathetic dragonflights will fall. If you will not serve the master, then I will find one who will!}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Let her go. My children are safe for now.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Champion. Your actions today have saved the red dragonflight from a terrible fate. For that, I am eternally grateful.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I know you seek to empower the Heart of Azeroth. You have more than earned my support.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Corastrasza will carry you back to Silithus. I will meet you there.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Long has my flight protected all life on Azeroth. And so shall we continue for as long as we draw breath.}}
:''Alexstrasza channels her power.''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Accept this gift. May it light a flame within you, to burn bright through the darkest times.}}
:''Alexstrasza leaves.''
