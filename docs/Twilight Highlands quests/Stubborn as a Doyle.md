== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Keeland Doyle}} in the [[Highland Forest]].

== Description ==
The Doyle riders were last spotted convergin' in the trees to the south, on the border of the [[Obsidian Forest]]. They're a stubborn bunch and are likely to take some convincin' if they're going to join up with us.

Your best bet with Keeland Doyle is to tell'm {{NPC||Cailin Longfellow}}'s taken up shelter with us back at the town. Keeland's got a soft sport for her and she just might be enough to convince him to drag all his boys along.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
It seems the Doyles suffered the worst of the attacking Twilight drakes.

It's clear they fought to the end: not a single rider's footprint more than a few yards from his gryphon. It's doubtful there were any survivors.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Clan Mullan]] and [[Firebeard Bellows]] before heading out. Head southeast. Doyle and his group didn't make it &mdash; taken out by {{NPC||Gloomwing}}s of the black flight. There are two guarding his corpse.

==Progression==
{{Firebeard's Patrol}}

== Patch changes ==
