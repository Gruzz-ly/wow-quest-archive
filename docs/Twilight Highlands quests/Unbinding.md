== Objectives ==
Free 10 Enslaved elementals by slaying them at the [[Twilight Citadel]].
* Enslaved elementals freed x10

== Description ==
Look, if there's one thing I know, it's elementals. I've been able to really gain an appreciation for how they feel. Let me tell you, they don't appreciate being enslaved one bit!

So, what I'm saying here is that if you were to free the enslaved elementals, I'm sure that not only would they show their gratitude, they'd also likely turn on their masters.

Sounds like a win-win to me, <name>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Try a few more, would ya?

== Completion ==
What'd I tell you? Elementals aren't so bad after all, eh?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Portal Overload]] and [[Spirit of the Loch]] before heading out.

Kill any enslaved elementals for a buff:
*Tempest's Blessing: Damage taken decreased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
*Waterspout's Favor: Health regeneration increased by 100% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 Minutes
*Inferno's Invocation: Damage increased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
