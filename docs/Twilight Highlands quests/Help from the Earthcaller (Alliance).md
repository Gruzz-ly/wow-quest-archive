== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Earthcaller Yevaa]] at the [[Elementium Depths]] in the [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
My investigation into [[Cho'gall]]'s artifact has hit a dead end. The [[Twilight's Hammer]] enslaved a group of Wildhammer smiths and then drowned them in [[Loch Verrall|the lake]] when they were done with their services.

<Mathias spits.>

We need help. There's an [[Earthen Ring]] woman, Earthcaller Yevaa, southwest at the [[Elementium]] mine.

She and her goblin initiate need help with the shutting down the elemental portals hereabouts. I'm thinking that in exchange, she can help us with our problem.

== Completion ==
<Name>! I'm glad you're here.

Of course, I'm more than happy to lend you whatever assistance that I can.

== Notes ==
Yevaa can be found at the southern end of the citadel complex, at {{co|37.5|88.6|Twilight Highlands}} standing at the entrance to the Elementium Depths mine.

==Progression==
