== Objectives ==
Collect 10 Kegs of Thundermar Ale from the [[Thundermar Ruins]]. Carfeul{{sic}} - it's got some kick!
*[[Keg of Thundermar Ale]] x10

== Description ==
S'not a boast to say that we Thundermars brew the finest ale in the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. It's 220 proof. Yeah, you heard me!

As folks fled from the south to the town center, they were forced to leave behind their ale.

<{{NPC||Low Shaman Blundy||Blundy}} pauses, allowing the gravity of the situation to soak in.>

GET IT BACK! That stuff'll turn even the stringiest of warriors into a whirlin' dervish of mouth-foaming destruction. Get them kegs! S'our only hope!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Keg-Stealer Bracers|Blundy's Breastplate|Barrel Opener}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Get me that ale, <name>.

Hey, you haven't been skimmin' off the top, have you?

== Completion ==
Oh aye ... we get a few of these kegs out to the boys on the front and we're gonna see some fireworks. Thank you, <name>!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dragonmaw Takedown]] and [[My Sister, Fanny]]. Fanny immediately turns around and offers [[Never Leave a Dinner Behind]], so pick it up before heading out.

Blundy's gossip text:
:<Blundy peers up from his cups.>
:Aye, that's right. The High Shaman is out in the field, fighting to retake the [[Thundermar Ruins|Thundermar Wreckage]]. I'm whatcha call the "Low Shaman."
:While he's away, he left me here, to take care of all of [[Thundermar]]'s Shamanin'in... nin.

Collecting ale will buff players with "Frothing Rage: Thundermar Ale has sent you into a drunken rampage. Damage output increased by 5%." It gets players increasingly drunk and stacks five times (to +25% damage).

== Popular reference ==
The effect of the ale and the old celtic theme (as well as the hanging meat from the quest Never Leave a Dinner Behind) together may be a reference to the French comic series Asterix where the Gaul warriors gain strength from drinking a magic potion to fight the Romans
