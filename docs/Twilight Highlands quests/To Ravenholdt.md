This rogue-only quest is the third part of the chain to obtain the legendary dagger set [[Fangs of the Father]]. It transports the rogue to [[Ravenholdt Manor]], the base of operations for the rest of the quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Mostrasz]] at the [[Vermillion Redoubt]] and fly to [[Ravenholdt Manor]] together.
* Speak with Mostrasz

==Description==
If the egg is in Ravenholdt Manor, we can't risk torching it in an all-out assault. I'll need someone slippery to get in there and find out for sure.

That's you, <name>.

Mostrasz will help you infiltrate the compound. Speak to him just outside and fly to Ravenholdt together. Good luck!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|13|50}}

==Progress==
So, are you ready to do some spying?

==Completion==
So far so good. Are you ready to do some spying?

== Notes ==
Don't fly to Ravenholdt on your own! Talk to Mostrasz, just outside.

Speaking with Mostrasz:
:<Name>! Great work decoding the message. Let's get to the bottom of this.

:Are you ready to fly?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready! Let's go to Ravenholdt.}}

:{{text|say|Mostrasz|Let's move out, friend! There's no time to lose.}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|[[Corastrasza]] is understandably upset. Under her care was the one black dragon egg that we believe was free of the taint of [[Deathwing]]'s corruption...}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|...and it was stolen away from us by thieves in the night!}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|You've found for us our only lead. The rogues from [[Ravenholdt]] are behind this.}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|Ravenholdt? It just doesn't make sense! A mongrel band of petty thieves. How did they even KNOW about the egg?}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|We'll get to the bottom of this. Someone with your skills is exactly what we need.}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|What's the expression? "To catch a thief," they say?}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|Look at this devastation. These [[Arathi Highlands|foothills]] have never recovered from the campaigns of the [[Second War|second]] and [[Third War|third]] wars.}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|Ruins and debris litter the landscape... and I consider the thieves and assassins of Ravenholdt to be part of that debris.}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|Without a state... without a cause... what drives them, do you wonder?}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|And what possessed them to strike out against the [[red dragonflight]]? Madness. We must learn more!}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|We're almost to [[Ravenholdt Manor]].}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|If they have the egg, it's too dangerous to risk an all-out assault. You'll need to sneak in there, find out what they're up to... And retrieve the egg at any cost.}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|Quiet now! We'll form up a plan within this cave...}}
