==Objectives==
Blow the Heth'Jatari Conch next to a Heth'Jatari Banner. Kill Fathom-Lord Heth'Jatar. Luring him into incoming mortar fire will help.
* [[Fathom-Lord Heth'Jatar]] slain
* [[Heth'Jatari Conch]] (provided)

==Description==
Let's go fishing, <name>! Now that the mortars are ready, we can take out the leader of this invasion.

Fathom-Lord Heth'Jatar rules over the Blackscale warrior caste. Go to the Heth'Jatari Banners just northeast of here and honk this conch shell. It's like a dog-whistle. For fish.

When Heth'Jartar shows up, I'll order the mortars to concentrate fire. You'll see the targets of the incoming shells.

Lure Heth'Jatar into our mortar fire and pummel him into submission!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bracers of the Fallen Fathom-Lord

*{{cost|9}}
* 55200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
You want me to keep firing?

I can keep firing.

==Completion==
Boom baby, boom!

What? You killed the Fathom-Lord already?

I suppose we should stop shelling his corpse, then.
