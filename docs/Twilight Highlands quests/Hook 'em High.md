==Objectives==
Use the Barbed Fleshook to dismount and kill 4 Thundermar Gryphon Riders.
* [[Thundermar Gryphon Rider]] slain (4)
* [[Barbed Fleshhook]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]] can train war [[gryphon]]s faster than we can subvert and control [[drake]]s. We can't let them continue to outnumber us!

Hunt gryphon riders flying over the river north of [[Bloodgulch]]. Take this hook and fling it at them as they fly by. Their momentum will hurl them from their mount, right to your feet. Kill the dismounted gryphon riders!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} ({{cost|13|15|50}} at 85)

==Completion==
You made that look easy, <name>.

Get the Wildhammer off of their mounts and they're nothing!

==Notes==
Not all of the gryphons will carry a Gryphon Rider, so look for the ones that carry a trail of lightning behind them.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
