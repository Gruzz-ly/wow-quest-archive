== Objectives ==
Locate an [[Eye of Twilight]] within the [[Black Breach]].

== Description ==
[[Cho'gall]] keeps track of his minions through powerful magical orbs: "The Eyes of Twilight."

In [[Mount Hyjal]], the [[Guardians of Hyjal]] managed to [[Elementary!|find and manipulate one]] to their own ends. We must do the same. I want one of those orbs, and I want to use it to peer into the very heart of Cho'gall's lair.

Search the Black Breach, across the river to the northeast, and find an Eye of Twilight. Do whatever you need to bring it back to me!

== Completion ==
<The Eye sits before you, humming ominously with dark energies.>

<Without warning, the orb rotates, as if to look at you. You sense a malevolent presence, as though the orb is alive.>
