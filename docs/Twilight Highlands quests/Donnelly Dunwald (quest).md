== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Donnelly Dunwald}}.

== Description ==
So you be lookin' to find us, and I be lookin' to find me brothers. It sounds to me like we got some common ground in there abouts.

Donnelly's our eldest, and while his size shows it, his wits might not. He's usually up in the northern ruins - in the hovel. Do ya think you might go lookin' for him for me? It'd be a right comfort if I knew he were safe.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
Hi friend! I don't think I know you. I'm Donnely Dunwald.

What's your name. I don't think I know you... Do I know you?

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Eoin Dunwald]], [[Cayden Dunwald]], [[While Meeting The Family]] and [[Sifting Through The Wreckage]] before heading out. Donnely is to the north. The hovel is just to the southwest of the [[Crucible of Carnage]], and Donnely is searching the area looking for Beak.
*Come back, Beak! Don't get hurt!
*Beak! Where are ya Beak?
*Beak! No more hiding. Come out right now!
*Beak! Come back to Donnely. Donnely keep you safe!
