== Objectives ==
Use Alexstrasza's Tear within the hollow beneath the Obsidian Tree.
* [[Alexstrasza's Tear]] planted (provided)

== Description ==
The great petrified tree that lies before us to the south was once a beacon of great life. Our beacon. We lost this forest to the black flight, and it has since been corrupted and petrified. Nearly unredeemable.

But all is not without hope. I've brought a powerful tool to begin the healing process. The tree may still be saved, with much time and fortune, and with perhaps a little effort from you.

Bring this, Alexstrasza's Tear, and use it within the hollowed heart of the tree.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
The black flight may never be redeemed, but in the wake of all of their destruction, there is always hope for life anew.

== Completion ==
You've started a wonderful thing this day, amidst all of this blood shed.

It may take many years, but this ravaged land will be restored. It will be beautiful again.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Fitting End]] and [[Blackout (Twilight Highlands)|Blackout]] before heading out. Dragonspawn on the ground. Drakes up in the air. Head to the center of the forest. At {{co|63.6|77.8|Twilight Highlands}} is the entrance to the base of the Obsidian Tree, guarded by [[Scarderis]], a level 85 dragonspawn with 116k health. Kill him, plant the seed and get out.
