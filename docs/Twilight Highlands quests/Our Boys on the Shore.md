== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Lieutenant Emry}} at the [[Twilight Shores]] in the [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
The situation here in the Highlands changes by the minute. Our objective is to storm the [[Bastion of Twilight]], but I can't even secure a landing zone on the shore without the blasted [[Horde]] creating trouble.

While I scrape together the remains of the fleet, I need men on the shore securing the beach head.

Report to Lieutenant Emry on the shore and help his marines to beat back the Horde!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
Keep your head down 'fore you lose it, <class>!

This is MY beach.

The Horde WANTS my beach.

They will NOT have my beach.

Is the beach situation clear?

== Notes ==
[[Salvage Operation]] and [[Naga Reinforcements]] are side quests, but they lead to an ''Odyssey'' reference in [[Siren's Song]].

Head northwest out of the keep to the Twilight Shore. There, the Horde and the Alliance are having fun shelling the living daylights out of each other. Fargo also has a few words of wisdom:
*{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|So long as we're sendin' troops up the beach, we should double-up the artillery-fire. You know, to help.}}
*{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|More artillery... more! I never liked peninsulas.}}
*{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|Can we fire some more cannons? I dunnae think we're firin' nearly enough cannons.}}
*{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|Thas'it! Pulverize the beach! Leave nuthin' but ... sand.}}
Emry's gossip text on completion:
:You will own this peninsula, <class>.
:You will be a weapon.
:You will be a minister of death, praying for war.

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Highbank!}}
