==Objectives==
Escort the [[Horde Negotiator]] to the main hall in [[Dragonmaw Port]] to meet with [[Warchief Mor'ghor]] of the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]]. Speak with [[Ornak]] on the coast if you lose your Negotiator.
*Negotiations Concluded

==Description==
Our last two negotiators haven't returned from speaking with the Dragonmaw Warchief. I think we might need to flex a little bit of muscle.

This time, I want YOU to accompany the negotiator. Their Warchief might think twice once he realizes the Horde is full of battle-hardened heroes like yourself.

Simply escort our negotiator into the main hold in the center of Dragonmaw Port and look menacing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*12730 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
<Name>, I understand you're going to speak with our "Warchief" about joining your Horde.

Be careful, <class>.

See me afterwards...

==Completion==
Wake up, <name>! We don't have much time.

I rescued your gear for you.

At least now you've seen the foolishness of our leader first-hand. His blood is contaminated, his rage is unquenchable -- and he'll destroy us all trying to defeat the Horde!

==Notes==
* If the player accepts this quest while mounted, the negotiator will not follow him/her until they log in and out.<!--Is this still true?-->
* The Negotiator will follow the player around Dragonmaw Port. Upon reaching the Warchief's building, the Negotiator will stop following and walk into the building on his own.
* Should the Negotiator somehow die or disappear before completing the quest, speak to Ornak:
:{{gossip|I think I lost my negotiator. In fact he's probably dead. Is another available?}}
