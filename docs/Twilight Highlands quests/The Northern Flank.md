== Objectives ==
Report to [[Gralok]] at the [[Slithering Cove]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
I have ordered a defensive perimeter set up on our northern coast, at the Slithering Cove. Our scouts reported that the [[naga]] were trying to make landfall there.

Gralok is in charge of the operation - report to him and secure that beach!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|50}}

== Completion ==
Warlord Zaela sent you? Good.

If you Horde are as strong as your Warchief promised, I expect to see some bloodshed on these shores.
