==Objectives==
Collect 10 piles of Verrall River Muck.
*[[Verrall River Muck]] (10)

==Description==
Our alliance with the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] is secured, but this port is far from combat ready. These flimsy wooden walls are an embarrassment to the Warchief.

When water elementals carve their way through rock, as they have in the [[Verrall River]], they create a peculiar kind of muck. It spreads easily and dries harder than the hardest stone. It's the perfect mortar for large-scale construction.

Go to the river delta northwest of here and collect some Verrall River muck. Even a little will go a long way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*12730 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Do you have the mud? Construction of the new walls has already begun!

==Completion==
<Ornak allows the muck to drip from his fingertips.>

Now that's the stuff! I'll start mixing and diluting this with gravel and water. Just a few handfuls of this can enhance enough cement for an entire stone tower.

We've got big plans for this port, <name>. You'll see!
