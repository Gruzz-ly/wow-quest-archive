== Objectives ==
Get to the Hammer of Twilight.

== Description ==
While you were in the mine, I was able to figure out where the Hammer of Twilight is being kept. They created it at the [[Altar of Twilight]] to the south.

More important than that, the cultists have made a critical error: [[Cho'gall]] is personally overseeing its final construction.

Many [[SI:7]] died to bring us this information.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Completion ==
The Hammer of Twilight floats in the middle of the altar, unprotected....

== Notes ==
...and immediately back to the south. The altar is now lit up with a giant blue beam of light pointing skyward.

== Trivia ==
Shaw's lines, 'the cultists have made a critical error: [[Cho'gall]] is personally overseeing its final construction' and 'Many [[SI:7]] died to bring us this information' are a reference to lines in the third Star Wars movie, ''[[wikipedia:Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'', during the war meeting aboard the Rebel Star Cruiser, planning the attack on the new Death Star.
