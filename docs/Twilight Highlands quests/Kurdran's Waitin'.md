== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Kurdran Wildhammer}} inside of the [[Highbank]] Keep in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
It looks like the attack stopped, <name>. Which is a shame, 'cuz we never got to use the <class>-rocket.

Anyways, Kurdran Wildhammer is up in the top of the keep an I'm sure he'll be wantin' to gives ya a hero's welcome. Yeh earned it! Go talk to 'im!

I'll move on ahead and scout out the beach.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Varian Wrynn||The King}} himself sent you? Good to hear that [[Stormwind]] is secure.

I was expecting more in the way of troops, but word is that the [[Alliance navy|Alliance fleet]] was ambushed by the Horde on the way here. They gave as good as they got, but the fleet is in shambles.

If we're to make any forward progress here in the Highlands, we're going to need the help of heroes like you.

== Notes ==
Upstairs in the back of the keep.

Kurdran's gossip text:
{{Dialogue|
I've been placed in command of Alliance joint operations in the Twilight Highlands.

The independent [[Wildhammer clan]]s still dot this countryside. If we can unite them under the Alliance banner, nothing can stop us! But enemies close in from all sides. I hope you're ready for a fight, <class>.
