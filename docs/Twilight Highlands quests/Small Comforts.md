== Objectives ==
Find and return {{NPC||Meara}}'s Dried Roses, {{NPC||Parlan}}'s Ivory Hammer, and {{NPC||Aprika}}'s Doll.
*[[Meara's Dried Roses]] {{co|59.8|56.2|Twilight Highlands}}
*[[Parlan's Ivory Hammer]] {{co|59.3|56.9|Twilight Highlands}}
*[[Aprika's Doll]] {{co|59.5|55.9|Twilight Highlands}}

== Description ==
You're the new face that's meant to be helping {{NPC||Keegan Firebeard||Keegan}} out I take it? Pleasure to meet you. Maybe you can lend a favor or two to the troubled Wildhammer that have made refuge here.

We were all forced to retreat to this building quickly, and some of us left behind things of great value in our destroyed homes nearby. Would you mind bringing them back after you go out there? You would bring happiness to some very troubled souls.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Fire-Dodged Shoulderpads|Waistguard of Salvaged Happiness|Legplates of Remnants|Drape of Lost Valuables}}
You will also receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
Were you able to find their valuables? I know it seems so minor, but little things make a big difference to some people in times like these.

== Completion ==
You are very generous. Thank you.

There's a lot of darkness in our world these days. We appreciate the light that you've brought here.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Welcome Relief]] and [[The Only Homes We Have]] before heading out.

The three items are due north of the questgiver where the northern bucket brigade line is fighting off elementals. Check inside each building.

On complete:
