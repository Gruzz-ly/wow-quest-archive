== Objectives ==
Slay 10 [[Citadel Veteran]]s, [[Corrupted Elementalist]]s, and/or [[Twilight Vindicator]]s.
* [[Twilight Citadel]] cultists slain x10

== Description ==
No foray into the field would be complete without a good old-fashioned take-the-bad-guys-out kind of mission.

Between the citadel veterans, the corrupted elementalists, and the twilight vindicators, I'm sure you'll have plenty of targets.

How you choose to kill them is up to you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Looks to me like you might need to take out a few more. I'm just saying.

== Completion ==
None of us are too good to get our hands a little dirty. Or bloody, in this case.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dark Assassins (Alliance)|Dark Assassins]] and [[Help from the Earthcaller (Alliance)|Help from the Earthcaller]] before heading out. Kill any enslaved elementals for a buff:
*Tempest's Blessing: Damage taken decreased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
*Waterspout's Favor: Health regeneration increased by 100% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 Minutesn*Inferno's Invocation: Damage increased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
Dark Assassins are [[shade]]s wandering the area. The cultists are all humanoid.
