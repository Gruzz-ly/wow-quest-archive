==Objectives==
Speak with [[Earthcaller Torunscar]] at the [[Ring of the Elements]].

==Description==
A beast, <name>! I saw a beast. A great maw, an even greater hungering. [[Twilight's Hammer|They]] can't possibly know what they unleashed.

It is here. Its terrible shapeless body is erupting right into the [[Twilight Highlands|Highlands]].

I saw you in my vision, <name>. You struggle with the Earthen Ring to contain the beast. You will face the darkness.

Go now, before the beast grows in power. Speak to Earthcaller Torunscar at the Circle of the Elements, northwest of here atop the ridge beyond the ruined [[Ruins of Drakgor|Drakgor Encampment]]. Hurry!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|25}}
*+25 reputation with the [[Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
Welcome, brotha. You've chosen a harsh time to be joinin' us, but that is to our fortune. We could use ya help.
