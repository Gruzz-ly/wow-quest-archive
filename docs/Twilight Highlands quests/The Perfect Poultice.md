== Objectives ==
Collect 10 piles of Verall River Muck.
*[[Verrall River Muck]] x10

== Description ==
Are you goin' by way of the [[Verrall Delta|Verrall river delta]]? I've got a tip that'll help your men here... and my bird!

When [[water elemental]]s carve their way through rock, they create a peculiar kind of muck. It dires hard as stone but carries with it the rejuvenating power of water. You make a cast out of that muck and broken bones knit together like iron.

Bring some of that muck to {{NPC||Talaa}}, your [[shaman]] downstairs. She'll know what to do with it!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
What is this I keep hearing about the muck of the [[Verrall River]]?

== Completion ==
Oh... mud. You brought me mud?

Wow - this stuff oozes with power! I see what Thordun was saying, now. I'll distribute this to all of the healers. Our wounded will be on their feet in no time!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Any Portal in a Storm]] before heading out. Head west over the [[Twilight Shore (Twilight Highlands)|Twilight Shore]], west of [[Dragonmaw Port]] up the bay to the [[Verrall Delta]]. Then go killing and looting.

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Highbank!}}
