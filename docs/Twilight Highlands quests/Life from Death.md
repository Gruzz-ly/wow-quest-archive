==Objectives==
Plant Ruby Seeds at the corpses of 6 dragonkin within the [[Vermillion Redoubt]].
* [[Dragonkin]] [[corpse]] reclaimed (6)
* [[Ruby Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
<Race>, I have a task for you.

Take these ruby seeds and plant them at the corpses of any dragonkin that you come across. Twilight or Vermillion, whelping or dragon, it matters not. We need to see that their bodies are returned to the earth so that life can continue to flourish.

In death, there should always be new life. This may be our one consolation during times of war and great tragedy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*69400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you done as I asked?

==Completion==
In this, we deny Deathwing the destruction that he so passionately seeks. In this, life continues.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Draconic Mending]] before heading out. Circle the area looking for a named dragon that is wounded and actively getting healed. Defend the menders until the dragon is fully healed. Twilight Wyrmkillers will attack the menders. Kill the wyrmkillers and then reclaim their corpses. Heal the dragon to speed the process, if possible.

If players should come across the corpses of vermillion dragons, they count too.
