== Objectives ==
Lead the [[Gob Squad]] to the closed [[Dragonmaw Gate]].

If you lose the Gob Squad, return to [[Warlord Krogg]] for reassignment.
* Dragonmaw Gate opened

== Description ==
The wyrms have already taken the battle to the sky above [[Grim Batol]]. It's up to us to move our men in by ground and secure the gates.

I want you to know what is at stake here, <class>. Grim Batol is the source of [[Twilight's Hammer]] reinforcements to all of the highlands. If we do not cut them off here, we will not win the battles ahead.

I'm sending the Gob Squad with you. Get to the gate to the southeast and get it open. Patch should have any further instructions you'll need from there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*69400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Completion ==
Works like a charm, every time. 

== Notes ==
On accept, the Gob Squad join the player: Patch, who immediately offers [[Paving the Way (Horde)|Paving the Way]], [[Grit]], [[Ticker]], [[Volt]], and [[Newt]]. Talk to Patch:
:Sir.

*{{text|say|Newt|You want me to steal third?}}
*{{text|emote|Patch looks confused.}}
*{{text|say|Newt|Was that... Yoga?}}
*{{text|say|Grit|Leading under the influence...}}
*{{text|say|Ticker|Now that's just rude...}}
*{{text|say|Ticker|What did you just call my mother?}}
*{{text|say|Volt|I don't think that's physically possible, sir.}}
*{{text|say|Volt|Sir, I think the explosions and gunfire gave us away. You don't have to use hand signals.}}
*{{text|say|Grit|What the heck was that?}}
Hop on a ground mount and start running. Remember to do some damage to the twilights in order to get credit for killing them. If there aren't enough twilights nearby, get to the gate at {{co|29.6|51.6|Twilight Highlands}} where a script event will play out and spawn in at least a dozen twilights:
:{{text|say|Patch|Newt, you're up! Break out the gatestone!}}
:{{text|say|Newt|You got it boss. Er... where do I put it?}}
:{{text|say|Patch|You put it right in the... wait... where's the keyhole? What kind of racket is this?}}
:{{text|say|Patch|Screw it. Ticker, you're up!}}
:{{text|say|Ticker|Right away, boss!}}
:''A few squads of twilights rush the gate. Fend them off.''
:{{text|say|Ticker|Almost done.}}
On success, Krogg runs up and stops just on the other side of the gate:
:{{text|say|Warlord Krogg|Good work. I'll keep the men pushing from here. Move forward and take the last gate.}}
Finish this quest and pick up [[Pressing Forward (Horde)|Pressing Forward]] before leaving Krogg's new position.
