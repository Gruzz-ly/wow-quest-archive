==Objectives==
Use the Blast Tape to seal 10 Faulty Valves.
* Faulty Valves sealed (10)
* [[Blast Tape]] (provided)

==Description==
Look here, chief, if it weren't for this [[Flashbang Rothman|bumbly idiot]] across from me, the [[Krazzworks]] would be holding up just fine.

Unfortunately for everyone involved, "Fancypants" Rothman here decided to deploy the place on top of a mountain! I mean really, who does that?

So, we got leaks all over the place due to faulty valves. Think you could take this blast tape and seal 'em up for me?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cartographer's Chestguard
|Techie's Hard Hat
|Crazed Pilot's Gloves}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*4,100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Look, I'm just a simple cartographer, but according to my estimates, not to mention what my eyes are telling me, there are a few more faulty valves that need to be sealed.

==Completion==
There you go. Now hows about we use this blast tape on Rothman's mouth?
