== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Dark Assassin Pendants.
*[[Dark Assassin's Pendant]] x5

== Description ==
Even I get hunted. I suppose that's what I get for hiding amongst the sheep.

<Mathias studies you for a moment.>

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] has taken it up a notch and sent their dark assassins after me. Nice bunch of guys. Dead now. They're made from the souls of the most skilled killers.

Want to do me a favor? Hunt them down. Bring back their soul pendants.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Fencer's Nimblefingers|Muffled Bracers|Silenced Blunderbuss}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
How many pendants do you have?

== Completion ==
I'm not sure what I'm going to do with all of these. I'll probably fence them and donate the proceeds to the Stormwind orphanage.

Now to find someone sick enough to buy such a thing. It'll probably be a goblin. Or, a gnome warlock.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Bring the Hammer Down (Alliance)|Bring the Hammer Down]] and [[Help from the Earthcaller (Alliance)|Help from the Earthcaller]] before heading out. Kill any enslaved elementals for a buff:
*Tempest's Blessing: Damage taken decreased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
*Waterspout's Favor: Health regeneration increased by 100% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 Minutes
*Inferno's Invocation: Damage increased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
Dark Assassins are [[shade]]s wandering the area. The cultists are all humanoid.
