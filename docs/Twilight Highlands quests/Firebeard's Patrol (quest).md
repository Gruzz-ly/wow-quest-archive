== Objectives ==
Seek out {{NPC||Keegan Firebeard}} at [[Firebeard's Patrol]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
I was on my way to join Firebeard's Patrol when my bird was shot down.

[[Twilight's Hammer]] launched surprise attacks all over the Highlands. Sometimes their buildings crawled right out of the earth in the middle of our villages. It was a nightmare!

In the chaos, Firebeard is one of the few who's kept his head on straight. He's trying to piece together a full [[Gryphon rider|gryphon wing]] from the survivors.

If you want to bring the Wildhammer into the Alliance, start by helping out Firebeard, to the west.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
Come to join the patrol, <lad/lass>? Glad to have ya.

I need some bodies helpin' to get our defenses under control here. Help me out and I'll see if I can't find some more prestigious work for ya.

== Notes ==
Back northwest over the [[Twilight Shore (Twilight Highlands)|Twilight Shore]], but head south of the big purple volcano and not up to the river delta. Firebeard's Patrol is at the southern base of the volcano, half in flames from attacks by fire ascendants. Citizens are trying to make a bucket brigade from the well a few feet away from Keegan in the center of town.

Pick up the flight path, then talk to Keegan.
