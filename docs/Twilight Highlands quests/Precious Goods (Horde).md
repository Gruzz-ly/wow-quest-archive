== Objectives ==
Retrieve a Twilight Caravan Gatestone. The [[Twilight Spearwarder|Spearwardens]] should carry keys that can get you into the gatestone chests.
*[[Twilight Caravan Cargo Key]]
*[[Twilight's Hammer Gatestone]]

== Description ==
The gates further down the canyon are shut. Our scouting revealed some kind of stone that they carry in chests in their caravans that they use to open the gates.

Get down there and look for a chest key on the bodies of the guards. When you find it, use it on one of those chests on the caravan wagons and bring the gatestone back to me.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Crushchest Leggings|Helm of Durable Hatred}}
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*69400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
You know, we could probably just blow the gates, but knowing our demoman, we're probably better off dodging the risk.

== Completion ==
Good going.

Doesn't look like much, does it?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Easy Pickings (Horde)|Easy Pickings]] before heading out. Kill spearwarders until the key drops, then loot a chest, then go back to killing spearwarders to hit the quota.
