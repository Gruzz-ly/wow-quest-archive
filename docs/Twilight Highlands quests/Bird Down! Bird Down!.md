== Objectives ==
Locate {{NPC||Thordun Hammerblow}}, a downed wildhammer [[Gryphon rider|gryphon-rider]], at the [[Twilight Shore (Twilight Highlands)|Twilight Shore]]s in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
While you were fighting along the coast, I spotted a [[gryphon]] tumble out of the clouds almost due west of here.

It wasn't one of ours.

Likely it belonged to one of the Wildhammer. I know that Kurdran wanted to establish contact with the lost [[Wildhammer clan]]s as one of his primary objectives after taking the beach.

I can't spare any more of my men to scout it out, but I can spare you. Find that downed Wildhammer!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
Aw dang crap it all. You're just an Alliance <class>. I was hoping for a rescue.

== Notes ==
Head west-northwest. Thordun Hammerblow and his fallen gryphon are up next to a tree near the border with the [[Obsidian Forest]].

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Highbank!}}

== Patch changes ==
