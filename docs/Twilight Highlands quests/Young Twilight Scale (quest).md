==Objectives==
Show the scale to [[Eryna]] above [[Grim Batol]] in the [[Wetlands]].

* [[Young Twilight Scale]]

==Description==
<A partially-grown scale from a young [[Twilight dragonflight|twilight]] whelp.

More and more twilight dragons are appearing once again. This seems suspicious.

You should show the scale to Eryna above Grim Batol in the Wetlands, perhaps she has seen something recently.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 950 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]

==Completion==
Welcome, I see you noticed the whelps. They appeared recently, along with more members of the flight coming and going from the citadel.

I have indeed been observing strange happenings below.

I sense a great power has manifested. Something awakened in the depths, perhaps? One thing is certain -- the flight is mobilizing at someone's command.

I will continue to relay all I find to [[Red dragonflight|my flight]] and your [[Magni Bronzebeard|Speaker]], thank you for your assistance.

==Notes==
*Although the quest is categorized under [[Wetlands]], it actually takes place in the [[Twilight Highlands]].
