== Objectives ==
Slay Ophelia, the Siren of the Highlands.
*Slay {{NPC||Ophelia}} and Protect Ephram

== Description ==
She's still out there... Ophelia, the siren of the Highlands! Her terrible song will lure you to the depths. I've vowed to stay behind and avenge my fallen crewmembers, <class>. If you want to join me, just say the word.

We'll lash ourselves to the mast, we will. We'll shour our eyes. We'll stuff our ears with wax. And when her beautiful illusion drops.. we'll strike.

Are you in?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Wax-Filled Hood|Mast-Bound Leggings|Song-Reflecting Spaulders}}
You will also receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
She had me under her spell, <name>. I wouldn't have made it out of there alive if it weren't for you. Thank you!

Maybe the rest of the Alliance fleet can finally anchor here in peace...
