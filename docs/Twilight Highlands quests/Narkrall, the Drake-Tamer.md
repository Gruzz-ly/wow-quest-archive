== Objectives ==
Slay Narkrall Rakeclaw. Speak with {{NPC||Colin Thundermar}} when you're ready.
* [[Narkrall Rakeclaw]] slain

== Description ==
There's one Dragonmaw among this lot, the one they call "Narkrall: The Drake-Tamer." I don't know where he gets his power over those beasts, but the black terror he rides is as nasty a brute as ever took the skies over the Highlands.

<name>, Narkrall is the fiend who took my father's life and left Thundermar in my hands.

I can't take him on alone, but I've seen what you're capable of, <class>. Maybe together we can end this.

Let me know when you're ready, and we'll fight Narkrall together!
("Narkrall Rakeclaw: Speak to me when you're ready. I'll get him off his drake, b ut I'll need your help finishing him off...")

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Narkrall's Leggings|Ale Soaked Grips|Furybound Waistplate|Staff of Draconic Pacification|Dragonscorn Mace}}
You will also receive: {{cost|18}}

== Progress ==
Narkrall. With a heart as black as the beast he rides.

== Completion ==
We did it, <name>! Narkrall Rakeclaw lies dead at my feet, and Thundermar has weathered a storm of drakes!

This wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for the help of the Alliance. I owe you a debt that I don't think can ever be repaid.

== Notes ==
Talk to Colin again:
:D'ye hear it, <name>? The beating of great leathery wings over the treetops... Narkrall is closing in.
{{gossip|''I'm ready to fight him!''}}
:{{text|say|Colin Thundermar|Here he comes, <name>! Flying in from the west. Get your weapons ready!}}
Rakeclaw flies in on his mount and drops on the ground. He is a level 85 Dragonmaw orc with 193,725 health.
