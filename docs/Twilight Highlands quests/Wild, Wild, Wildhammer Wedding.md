== Objectives ==
Talk to {{NPC||Grundy MacGraff}} to begin the wedding ceremony. Kill any [[Twilight's Hammer]] that try to stop it!
* Nuptuals Completed

== Description ==
We are ready to begin, <name>!

But I have it on good authority that the Twilight's Hammer may try to disrupt the ceremony, so as to demoralize and destroy the Wildhammer. Things could get dangerous!

For this reason, I will be performing the ceremony myself, so that I can keep the bride and groom close to me. Sound like a plan? Good!

Since her father is dead and her brother the best man, Fanny has asked that you walk her down the aisle. What an honor! Talk to me when you're ready to begin.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
It's a nice day for a Wild wedding...

== Completion ==
We did it, <name>! Fighting that ... thing side-by-side really brought all the Wildhammers together. The heads of the families are more united than I've ever seen them. Drink up, <name>, and celebrate!!

Of course, our work is only beginning. I'll rally our new Wildhammer reinforcements with the rest of the Alliance and prepare to storm the [[Bastion of Twilight|Twilight Bastion]].

I'm sure we'll meet again soon.

== Notes ==
Talk to Grundy again:
:I'm ready to start whenever you are! I'll keep the bride and groom close in case the Twilight's Hammer tries anying.
:Are you ready?
{{gossip|''I'll keep my eyes open, Grundy. Let the wedding commence!''}}
:''The camera heads outside, focused on Russell, and pans across the audience before circling back to Kurdran and Firebeard.
:{{text|say|Kurdran|A big day, Firebeard. The Wildhammer united can never be stopped!}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|I hope you're right, Kurdran old friend.}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran|Never doubt it. Here, allow me to give you my wedding gift.}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran|The only surviving egg of my late gryphon, [[Sky'ree]]. Honor it and care for it; her child is yours.}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|Kurdran - no, I couldn't. Sky'ree was a legend, I can't-}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran|I'll not hear a word of it. The egg is yours. I want you to see how committed I am to this union.}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran|And how committed the Alliance is to the Wildhammer cause!}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|Aye. Thank you, Kurdran.}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran|Ah, look. Here comers <name>, escorting your bride!}}
:''The camera pans over to show the player escorts Fanny, now dressed in white, up the aisle.''
:{{text|say|Grundy|Ladies and gentledwarves, we gather here in the the shadow of Thunderstrike to honor the union of Fanny Thundermar and Keegan Firebeard.}}
:{{text|say|Grundy|May their bond be as eternal as the wind, waves, stone and fire.}}
:{{text|say|Grundy|Do you, Keegan and Fanny, accept one another into your lies, that two become as one, in union everlasting?}}
:{{text|say|Fanny|I do.}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|I do.}}
:{{text|say|Grundy|Then, by the powers vested in me... the powers vested in me...}}
:{{text|say|Grundy|...BY BLOOD AND SHADOW!}}
:{{text|say|Grundy|I shall consume your lifeblood in the name of the master!!}}
:''Grundy transforms into a level 84 elite faceless one, The Beast Unleashed, with nearly a million health!''
:{{text|bossemote|SAVE THE WEDDING!}}
:''A few random shouts from the wedding party as the fight begins.''
*{{text|say|Iain|It's one of them!}}
*{{text|say|Donnelly|Waaaaahhhhh!!}}
*{{text|say|Cliff|Stop that thing!}}
*{{text|say|Keely|Get it! Kill it!}}
Ten seconds in, Russell starts playing his lute:
:{{text|bossemote|Russell Brower begins to play a wedding hymn! Stand near him to receive its regenerative effects!}}
Wedding Hymn is an aoe heal aura that ticks for roughly 3530 health per second. A few seconds later, the Beast Unleashed knocks out the wedding party:
:{{text|bossemote|The wedding party is afflicted with {{text|red|[Cold Feet]}}!}}
:{{text|yell|The Beast Unleashed|Uulwi gag erh'ongg w'ssh.}}
:{{text|bossemote|The Beast Unleashed begins to emit an {{text|red|[Aura of Darkness]}}!}}
A few seconds later, Russell frees the wedding party:

:{{text|yell|<Every Wildhammer dwarf in attendance>|For the Wildhammer!}}
