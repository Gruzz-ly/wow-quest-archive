==Objectives==
Find {{NPC||Bahrum Forgehammer||Bahrum}}'s legguards.
*[[Bahrum's Pants]]

==Description==
Why I be standing in the grain crate? Long story short, there were hornets and some [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] that showed up at a bad time. I got away safely, but the bastards took off with me leggings!

My sister made those for me from scratch, even engraved my name on... I would die of shame if she found out I lost 'em.

Please find 'em for me - I saw the pant thief going into that fortress over there. I'm going to stay here for *ahem* cover.

And don't be asking what a Wildhammer wears under his kilt!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}}
{{itembox||Sack of Grain}}

==Progress==
Have you found 'em yet? This grain is pretty itchy.

==Completion==
Thank you! Now turn around so I can put'em on.

==Notes==
Head inside the orc fortress and run upstairs. On the top floor at {{co|62.3|47.1|Twilight Highlands}} is {{NPC||Gorosh the Pant Stealer}}. Kill him and return to Bahrum.

On complete:
:''Bahrum puts on his pants and jumps out of the box.
:{{text|say|Bahum Forgehammer|Now I can return with dignity!}}
:''He runs back to Ella.''
:{{text|say|Bahrum Forgehammer|I'm back, Sis!}}
:{{text|say|Ella Forgehammer|Thank heavens! It's so good to see... Why are your pants on backwards?}}
:''Bahrum runs off.''
