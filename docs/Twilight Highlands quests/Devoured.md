== Objectives ==
Defend yourself and [[Earthcaller Yevaa]] from [[Iso'rath]]'s bodily defenses.
* Survive Iso'rath's defenses

== Description ==
We knew this was possibility, but we had no idea how the beast would defend itself. Iso'rath's body is reacting quickly to our threat.

I can complete the summoning from here, but only if you can hold back Iso'rath's defenses. Keep them busy! We will survive this!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
I've brought you back from the brink of death, hero!

[[Deathwing]] is upon us! We need your help.

("Thrall: Into the fire")

== Notes ==
DO NOT DROP THIS QUEST OR LEAVE THE AREA!

Feel free to fight slimes as long as desired. They won't stop coming. The longer the adventurer lasts, the faster they come. There is no surviving this attack. Give in and take the death. Suddenly, [[Thrall]] will resurrect the player in the [[Maelstrom]]!

''Deathwing'' is attacking!

Wait, what?

Upon waking up in the Maelstrom:
