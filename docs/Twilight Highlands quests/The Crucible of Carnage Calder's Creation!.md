Intro
:{{text|say|Gurgthock|The grand Crucible of Carnage awaits, <name>. Remember, once a battle starts you have to stay in the arena. WIN OR DIE!}}
:{{text|yell|Gurgthock|Imagine my surprise when I was approached by the genius forsaken, Calder Gray, and propositioned with a combatant made of all the best features of our previous champions... LITERALLY! Who could refuse a chance to challenge CALDER'S CREATION?!}}
:{{text|yell|Gurgthock|You know what they say... if you can't beat 'em, join 'em! And in this case, you won't have the choice! Crucible of Carnage, I adore you so.}}
:{{text|yell|Calder Gray|Go forth, my beautiful angel! Ah, it is so very sad when one's children leave the nest, isn't it?}}
:{{text|yell|Cadaver Collage|Calder said that if I kill you, I get to have your parts!}}

:{{text|yell|Cadaver Collage|As you wish, Daddy!}}
:{{text|yell|Cadaver Collage|Oh! Too full... oh no...}}
:{{text|yell|Calder Gray|What... my creation! It didn't even blot out the sky! I'd better recheck my notes...}}
:{{text|yell|Gurgthock|OOOOOOOH! Check that mess out! Amazing win! Way to stick it through him!}}
:{{text|yell|Calder Gray|Your bodies are all magnificient! If you'd be willing to take a small whiff of this chloroform, I promise that you will all wake up 10 times stronger and 100 timres more... unified in purpose.}}
:{{text|yell|Calder Gray|No? Well... my offer stands. Just come by anytime and I'll be glad to give you the makeover you've always dreamed of.}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Hotfix|date=2010-12-21|bluenote=Cadaver Collage's hit points in Crucible of Carnage have been increased. The poison clouds that are left on the ground now despawn when Cadaver Collage begins casting Inhale. When Cadaver Collage begins to float away, it now displays an explosion animation after a few seconds and the player is removed from combat. This occurs within a few seconds, much faster than it previously took to leave combat.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
