== Objectives ==
Challenge and defeat one of the Mullan Gryphon Riders.
*{{NPC||Mullan Gryphon Rider}} defeated

== Description ==
{{NPC||Keegan Firebeard||Keegan}} wants the Mullans to take wing with 'em eh? If there's a dwarf I'd fly for, he'd be it. Still, I don't get why he'd be sendin' an outsider to be recruitin' me - not right polite by my standards.

I'm guessin' ya don't last 20 seconds with any of my boys, at the bar or in the battlefield. Prove me wrong. Take one of 'm down in a fight and then I'll think about flyin' with ol' Keegan.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
Naw, I'll not be fightin' ya. Get in there and challenge one of my boys if you've got a gut on ya at all.

== Completion ==
That's the stuff! Not half bad. You've got a bit of fight in ya after all.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Scent of Battle]] before heading out.

Talk to a rider not busy fighting.
:Duglas send you over to get roughed up?

On victory:
:{{text|say|Mullan Gryphon Rider|Fine! Fine. You win this one.}}

'''As of 2011/01/12 - there is a bug for hunters:''' When a pet is active they cannot complete the quest after winning the duel. They can only complete the quest when they fight without a pet - which makes it somewhat hard to solo it ...  
Ticket created so it will hopefully disappear in the near future.

One way around this is to use your pet as normal, and then to dismiss the pet when the Rider is at about 10-15% health. This should get around the bug.
