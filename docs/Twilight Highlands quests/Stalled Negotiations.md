==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ornak]] in [[Dragonmaw Port]]. [[Horzog]] can provide you with quick transportation to the shore.

==Description==
The [[Warchief]]'s whereabouts are unknown! But we have to keep his plan moving forward. <name>, you look like you can get things done.

Our negotiations with the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] have stalled. Their Warchief is... [[Overlord Mor'ghor|not what we expected]]. I need you to go in there and get negotiations back on track.

Meet with Ornak on the shore, he'll fill you in.

Talk to Horzog on deck here for quick transportation to the shore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|50}}
*6370 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
I'm glad you're here, <class>. Perhaps a seasoned veteran of the Horde's campaigns in [[Northrend]] and elsewhere can talk some sense into the Dragonmaw leadership...
