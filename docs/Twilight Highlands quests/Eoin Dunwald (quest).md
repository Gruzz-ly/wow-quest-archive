== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Eoin Dunwald}}.

== Description ==
Eoin's one of the twins. He's got a penchant for the drink. You'll likely be findin' him over by the old well - the ale stores were in a building there.

Mind making him pay his worrying sister a visit? Shouldn't take too much convincin' if you can get to the ale first.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
Of all the buildings in all the towns to collapse, why'd it have to be this one?!

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Donnelly Dunwald]], [[Cayden Dunwald]], [[While Meeting The Family]] and [[Sifting Through The Wreckage]] before heading out.

Eoin is southeast, at the well, bemoaning the loss of the ale stores.

:{{text|say|Bah!  Dere's got to be some here somewhere...}}
:{{text|yell|Of all the buildings in all of Dunwald, why this one?!}}
:{{text|yell|They've gone too far!  Some Twilight are goin' to be dyin' this day!}}
:{{text|yell|Soul-less, ale-hatin', uncultured vagabonds!  Ya better hide!}}

Talk to him:
:So... thirsty...
{{gossip|''Eoin, there's a full well right there.''}}
:{{text|say|Water?!  Are you daft?!  I need some ALE!}}
