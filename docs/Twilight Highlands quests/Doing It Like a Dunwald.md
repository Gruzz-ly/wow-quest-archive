== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Darunga.jpg|Darunga|There are few things in the highlands as terrifying as the Dunwalds reunited.}}
Speak to {{NPC||Flynn Dunwald}} and aid the Dunwald brothers in killing Darunga.
*[[Darunga]] slain

== Description ==
They already left to hunt down the [[ettin]] that lead the attack on Dunwald. I asked them to at least give ya a chance to catch up, but I'm not sure waitin's in their blood.

They made off towards the town square, in the center of the ruins. You should go join'm before ya miss out on all the fun.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dunwald Winged Helm|Gryphon-Grip Leggings|Flynn's Favorite Chestplate|Skyflight Beacon}}
You will also receive: {{cost|18}}

== Progress ==


== Completion ==
Thanks for your help. You've got a warrior's spirit in ya - you coulda fooled me for a Wildhammer if it weren't for your... well... you know.

I know Firebeard sent you to invite us. My love for that dwarf runs shallow, but you know now we've got plenty of reasons to make enemies of Twilight. If you see him, tell him that when the battle starts, the Dunwald family will be there.

== Notes ==
Head southeast to the town square. At {{co|50.5|70.6|Twilight Highlands}} on the path are the five brothers staring down Darunga, a level 84 elite ettin with 967,000 health. Speak with Flynn:
:Hah! My brothers be itchin' for a fight. It was all I could do ta hold them back this long.
:You in?
{{gossip|''I'm in.''}}
:{{text|yell|Flynn|Let's give'm a proper Dunwald welcome, brothers!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn|FOR CLAN WILDHAMMER!}}
Random taunts from the brothers:
*{{text|say|Donnelly|When I'm done with ye, ye won't have a toe to stand on!}}
*{{text|say|Cayden|Say goodbye to yer kneecaps, baddie!}}
*{{text|say|Eoin|I've had about enough of this aleless inbreed!}}
*{{text|say|Cayden|Take that, ye beardless coward!}}
The ettin has a ground stomp and a boulder throw ability:
*{{text|bossemote|Daruna roars wildly, initiating a masive stomp attack!}}
Eoin will also throw mugs of ale to replenish health:
:{{text|say|Eoin|How's about a nice, refreshing ale?!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Use Eoin's mug to replenish your health!}}
In addition to the ettin, there are two Twilight Shadowshifters channeling a +10% damage dealt buff on the ettin, so take them out.

This concludes the Dunwald quest chain. Do the Thundermar chain, starting with [[A Coward's Due]].
