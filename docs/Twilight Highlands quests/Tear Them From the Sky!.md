==Objectives==
Use the Shoulder-Mounted Drake-Dropper to slay 8 Dragonmaw Black Drakes.
* [[Dragonmaw Black Drake]] slain x8
* [[Shoulder-Mounted Drake-Dropper]] (provided)

==Description==
Egah! They're here, <name>. They're here!

I had hoped to equip a whole army with my shoulder-mounted drake-droppers, but all I have is a single, extremely expensive and wholly untested prototype. Here, take it!

Shoot the Dragonmaw black drakes that are circling [[Thundermar]], and drop them from the sky!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

==Progress==
You're still alive!

Wait, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound so surprised.

==Completion==
You did it, <name>! Alliance ingenuity to the rescue.

Of course, I don't have anything to help you fight the dismounted riders now that they're on the ground. You're a <class>; improvise!

==Notes==
The item cannot be used while mounted, so pick a drake that is flying a path that won't take it out of line of sight behind a building and pull the trigger. It has a two second cast time, so make sure to keep it in front.
