Speak with the [[Kor'kron Squad Commander]] and then escort the Kor'kron squad.
*Speak to the Squad commander

== Description ==
Now that the attack is underway, it's time to deal with the [[Twilight Citadel]]. If you don't mind, I'd like for you to escort the Kor'kron forces up to [[Garona Halforcen|Garona]].

She's hiding somewhere up top. The Kor'kron squad commander can tell you where.

Thank you, <name>. We look forward to joining you in the assault upon the Citadel!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Oh no!

== Notes ==
Back to the gate. At the base of the ramp leading up the hill, at {{co|38.9|64.0|Twilight Highlands}} is the Kor'kron Squad Commander. Speak with him:
:Throm-Ka, <name>. We snuck a few more in while you were preparing the Gates for attack.
:I'll show you where we're to meet with Garona.
:<The squad leader produces a map of the Twilight Citadel and points to the spot.>
:Let me know when you're ready, and we'll go together.
{{gossip|''I'm ready, Commander, let's head up.''}}
:{{text|say|Kor'kron quad Commander|Let's move out quickly, <name>. Up the ramp and then straight to Garona.}}
:''A number of Kor'kron assassins appear and the squad stealths about halfway up the hill, when suddenly'':
:{{text|say|Kor'kron Squad Commander|Wait! Do you hear something?}}
:{{text|say|Kor'kron Squad Commander|Cho'gall!}}
:''Cho'gall runs to the top of the ramp!''
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Horde scum! I was once like you. (Our old masters, small and hungry.) You cling to your mortal shells... (Bags of blood and bone and tears). ...trying to deny your insignificance.}}
:{{text|yell|Kor'kron Squad Commander|Kill him!}}
:''The squad charges in!''
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|(Finish it! Finish them all!)}}
:''They are nigh-instantly killed by Cho'gall. The commander runs in and is thrown back down the hill, killing him as well.''
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Pathetic flesh!}}
:''Cho'gall teleports out.''
The quest automatically completes at this point.
