== Objectives ==
Slay High Shaman MacKilligan.
* [[High Shaman MacKilligan]] slain
* Suggested Players [2]

== Description ==
Our scouts in the field report that High Shaman MacKilligan has moved out of [[Thundermar]] and is fighting in amidst the [[Thundermar Ruins]] northwest of here, across the river.

He's a dangerous one, <name>, responsible for the deaths of many a [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]]. He WILL be destroyed, that is not the question.

The question is: will you be the one to earn the glory of the kill?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} ({{cost|13|15|50}} at 85)

== Completion ==
The High Shaman has been brought down! Thundermar will no doubt try to send others, but on this day, the Dragonmaw are triumphant.

== Notes ==
The High Shaman is an elite mob, so expect it to be a tough fight. Assisting in killing the non-elite dwarves before engaging him is advised, as it will make the Dragonmaw NPCs fighting them aid you in the combat. Destroying the Healing Stream Totem will make it considerably easier to kill him.
