== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Kurdran Wildhammer}} at [[Highbank]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
My fellow [[Shaman]] and I will stay here to keep the portal open.

You should go upstairs and notify Kurdran that the work here is done. It'll please him to hear some good news for once.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
Ho! I knew you were a <class> I could count on, <name>. Use that portal anytime you need to get from [[Stormwind]] back to the Highlands.

Now then, time to get to business. We need to locate and unite the lost Wildhammer clans scattered around the Highlands. Talking with Thordun here is a good start!
