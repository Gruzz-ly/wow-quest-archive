== Objectives ==
Destroy the Twilight Rune of Earth, Rune of Water, Rune of Air, and Rune of Fire.
*Rune of Earth destroyed
*Rune of Water destroyed
*Rune of Air destroyed
*Rune of Fire destroyed

== Description ==
Examining the Twilight Rune of Earth, you can almost feel its power extending further into the [[Elementium Depths]].

It's probably connected to other runes. [[Initiate Goldmine]] thinks that you should destroy all of them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
We still have some runes to destroy, <name>.

== Completion ==
That'll teach 'em to move in on our territory!

What's that over across the way?

== Notes ==
On accept, the Earth Rune is destroyed automatically:
:{{text|say|Initiate Goldmine|You destroyed their Earth rune! I bet there are three others. And, I bet they're all linked to the fire portal in the back.}}
:{{text|say|Initiate Goldmine|We better destroy them all. But first, I need to get the shrapnel out of my backside.}}
Keep heading back to the northwest. Next is the water rune:
:{{text|say|Initiate Goldmine|Did you get wet? I'm soaked! Okay, what do you want to bet the next rune is attuned to air?}}
Further along is the air rune:
:{{text|say|Initiate Goldmine|The blast of air totally dried my hair. That gives me a great idea for a spare flying machine engine!}}
Finally, at the exit of the tunnel leading to a natural cave is the rune of fire:
:{{text|say|Initiate Goldmine|Ahahahaha, that's the last of their runes! Twilight Suckers, no more elemental power for you!}}
On complete:
:{{text|yell|Initiate Goldtooth|Wait! What's that over there?}}
