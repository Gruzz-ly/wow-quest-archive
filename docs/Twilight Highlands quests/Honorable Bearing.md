== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Iain Firebeard}} at the [[Firebeard Cemetery]].

== Description ==
Iain, my second in command, bore the body of one of our fallen heroes to the cathedral to the west. He's the man I put in charge of reforming a wing of [[gryphon rider]]s from whatever scattered forces he can find. I would like you to help him.

I should impress upon you the urgency of this task. We will not be able to hold here forever; the [[Twilight's Hammer]] or the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw orcs]] will eventually overwhelm us. Putting together an active gryphon wing may be our only hope for surviving these conflicts.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|29}} (at 80)

== Completion ==
Greetings, <race>. Sent by Keegan?

== Notes ==
A few hundred yards to the west.

Iain's gossip text:
:They took us unaware... attacked all of the highlands at once, burstin' forth from the ground, swoopin' from the air. Most of the gryphon wings were scattered, and far too many good dwarves lost their lives.
:There'd be little hope at all if Keegan hadn't rallied us together. I owe that man my life. At least now we have a chance.

The three follow-ups take players in different directions, all pretty much equidistant from Ian.
