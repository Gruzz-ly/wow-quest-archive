These naga scum think to move upriver to reinforce the Bastion of Twilight. We will RIP off their fish heads and PULL OUT their SPINES.

After the battle we will mount their heads on pikes and build a wall all along the beach. THAT will show these belly-crawling SNAKES who owns the [[Twilight Highlands|Highlands]].
