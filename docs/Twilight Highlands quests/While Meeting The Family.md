== Objectives ==
Kill 20 Twilight's Hammer in Dunwald territory.
*Twilight guests welcomed to Dunwald x20

== Description ==
Hey there, <lad/lass>. I'm sure {{NPC||Keely Dunwald||Keely}}'s got you worrying about our brothers, but they can take care of themselves. They'll find their way back here one way or another.

Maybe you can do me a favor while you're out meeting the family... Dunwald territory is still infested with [[Twilight's Hammer]] and their servants. I'd appreciate it if you could remind them that they're not welcome.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|18}}

== Progress ==
Have you delivered that message for me?

== Completion ==
Now that's what I'm talkin' about <lad/lass>. My kinda <race>.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Donnelly Dunwald]], [[Eoin Dunwald]], [[Cayden Dunwald]] and [[Sifting Through The Wreckage]] before heading out. Don't focus on killing Twilights. Cayden's escort will be more than enough.

On accept:
:Be wary of taking to the sky above these ruins, <lad/lass>. The Twilight drakes have a taste for things that fly.
