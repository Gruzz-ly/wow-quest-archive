== Objectives ==
Find and rescue Fanny Thundermar.
* {{NPC||Fanny Thundermar}} Rescued

== Description ==
We've started tearing this camp apart, <name>, but there's no sign of Fanny. Maybe you can find her.

We haven't checked the cave just behind me, to the northwest. See if you can find Fanny in the cave!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Fanny is safe! I hear Firebeard was in there with you? Nice to hear he's finally pulling his weight.

Wait, why are you looking at me like that, <name>? Do you know something I don't?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Ogre Bashin']] before heading out. Head immediately to the northwest to enter the ogre den guarded by a Glopgut Warhound, then go killing.

Near the back of the cave, around {{co|35.4|31.7|Twilight Highlands}} Keegan pops out behind the player:
:{{text|say|Fanny Thundermar|<Name>? What are you doing here? And is that Keegan Firebeard behind you?}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|Aye! We're here to rescue you!}}
:{{text|say|Fanny|Took yer sweet time, didnt'cha?}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|The ogres - ya kilt 'em!}}
:{{text|say|Fanny|Aye, they was gettin' a wee handsy, so I took care of it. C'mon then. I'm done here.}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|Did you see that, <name>? What a woman!}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|She's a real powder-keg that one. She'd make a fine Firebeard! Y'think the Thundermars would go for it?}}
