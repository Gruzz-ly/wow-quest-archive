== Objectives ==
Collect 5 pellets of Molten Fury.
*[[Molten Fury]] x5

== Description ==
I have a plan to quadruple the recommended torque for a standard speargun of this size, but according to my calculations the act of firing the weapon would shatter the casing. And possibly cleave the planet in two.

I can weld together a chassis 100-times stronger if I had a good source of pure elemental flame for the smelting.

{{NPC||Unbound Emberfiend}}s are roiling around west of here, in the [[Humboldt Conflagration]]. Killing them should render them down to pellets of molten fury. Bring me some!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Do you have the molten fury? No no, don't put it in my hand. Here, use the tongs!

== Completion ==
Marvelous! I'll smelt this down into a delicious soup. An angry soup. Of molten metal.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Magmalord Falthazar]], [[Tempered in Elemental Flame]], [[Potential Energy]] and [[A Vision of Twilight (Alliance)|A Vision of Twilight]] before heading out.

Northwest out of Thundermar to the conflagration. Emberfiends carpet the area, but the drop rate of the Molten Fury is low.

==Progression==
{{A Coward's Due}}
