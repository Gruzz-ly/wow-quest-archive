== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Velastrasza]] within the [[Vermillion Redoubt]].

== Description ==
I won't be so impolite as to refuse your aid if you're offering it.

We're locked in constant battle with the twilight drakes and dragons to the south. Our strikes have not been entirely without success, but the dragons coming out of [[Grim Batol]] have been breathing some kind of corruption upon us that takes time to cleanse.

Velastrasza and [[Baleflame]] are attending to our injured brothers. Go and see if you can be of help to them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||94}} (or {{cost|1|65|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
[[Calen]] has become very trusting. It is not often that strangers are permitted within the redoubt.

== Notes ==
Velastrasza is due south.

You will be able to use the Vermillion Redoubt flight point after completing this quest.
