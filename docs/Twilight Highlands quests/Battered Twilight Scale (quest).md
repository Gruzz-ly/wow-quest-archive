Shh! Step back! We can't let them see us!

What are you doing here? Who sent you?

<[[Eryna]] listens as you explain the twilight attack.>

Yes, we know. It's those damn [[stone trogg]]s, nothing stops their digging! They dug far deeper and further than we thought possible.

What's more, when I really concentrate, I can feel the heartbeat of thousands of tiny creatures in there. We have no idea how many more eggs remain...

Since you're out here, one of them had these gems on them, take them.
