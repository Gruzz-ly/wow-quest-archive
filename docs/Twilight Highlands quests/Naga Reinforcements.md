== Objectives ==
Slay 10 {{NPC||Blackscale Myrmidon}}s or {{NPC||Blackscale Seacaller}}s.
*Blackcale Naga Slain x10

== Description ==
They've come slithering up from the ocean depths, <name>. The [[naga]]. I think their intent is to reinforce the [[Bastion of Twilight]], probably by heading inland via the [[Verrall River|Verrall river]]. We can't let that happen!

Teach them that these shores are ours now, and send them scurrying back to the lightless depths.

Kill the [[Blackscale naga]] worming their way through the [[Obsidian Breakers]]!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Myrmidon-Slaying Bracers|Blackscale Wraps|Chill-Tail Waistguard}}
You will also receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
You're soaked, mate.

== Completion ==
That'll send 'em packing, <name>! {{NPC||Cho'gall}} won't be able to count on the naga to back him up in this fight. Friom here on out, it's just us versus the [[Twilight Hammer]].

<Simon pauses, his jaw tightening.>

...And the Horde.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Salvage Operation]] before heading out. Then head southwest, jump in and go killing and collecting. Don't forget to come up for air!

While out at the breakers, players may run across {{NPC||Ephram Hardstone}}, a beached ship still mostly above water. He offers [[Siren's Song]]. Do it, as it's a one-off reference to the ''[[wikipedia:Odyssey|Odyssey]]'', then head back to Highbank.

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Highbank!}}
