==Objectives==
Collect 15 Twilight Ore so [[Kiro]] can repair the [[peon]]'s{{Sic}} tools.
*[[Twilight Ore]] (15)

==Description==
The peons are right. These tools are inexcusable.

How can they be expected to complete a job without the proper tools for their trade?

I can make the needed repairs, but I'll need some ore first.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Have you found any ore?

==Completion==
I can work with this.

==Notes==
Upon accepting Worthwhile Repairs, [[A Little Goodwill]], and [[Peon Promotions!]]:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|We have to do what we can to appease the peons.}}

[[Twilight Ore]] nodes can be found around the [[Dunwald Ruins]].
