== Objectives ==
Get a Crushblow Wind Rider squad from [[Jon-Jon Jellyneck]] and then escort them to the drop off point in the [[Twilight Gate]].
* Get wind rider squad
* Kor'kron dropped off

== Description ==
[[Garona Halforcen|Garona]] and a detachment of the [[Kor'kron]] are here to assist us with operations up top in the [[Twilight Citadel]]. I need you to escort them there.

I've called upon a local tribe of trolls to give us a lift in with their wind riders. The assassins have some things that they need to do down in the [[Twilight Gate]] area first, though.

Speak with the troll chief, Jon-Jon Jellyneck and get yourself a detachment of Kor'kron to drop off. You'll fly them in. A big red X marks the spot.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Completion ==
That must have been exciting.

Despite any losses that the Kor'kron may have incurred along the way, no one will be able to doubt their effectiveness, nor that of Garona. And with you in the mix, it's only a matter of time before victory is ours.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Ogres & Ettins (Horde)|Ogres & Ettins]] and [[Call in the Artillery (Horde)|Call in the Artillery]] before heading out.

Jon-Jon Jellyneck stands next to the flight master. Talk to him:
:Dere'es nothin' bettah dan flyin' ovah ya enemies an' droppin' dey boom-boom bombs on dem!
:Dat, or droppin' two-hundred, fifty pound orcs on dere heads. Right, mon?
{{gossip|''Jon-Jon, I'm here to lead your wind rider squad and drop off the Kor'kron assassins.''}}
:Hey, why not you say so? Give dem Twilight's the ol' one-two, den ya comin' back here an' we party!
:I gots me a sweet lil' place down on dey beach with me lady. You comin' by!
:''A squad of Crushblow Flyer flies in.''

*{{text|say|Crushblow Flyer|Why we gotta taxi you? Canna ya just sneak in dere, mon?}}
*{{text|say|Crushblow Flyer|Let's get ta dey drop point!}}
Hop on a flying mount and head in. The drop point is marked by a blue X at {{co|39.2|64.5|Twilight Highlands}} on the northern part of the gate. Then start killing and marking.
