*Sauranok's Guilt Revealed
*[[Sauranok the Mystic]] slain

==Description==
The Twilight's Hammer agents still lurk within the confines of Orgrimmar. I need someone I trust to collect the final evidence of treachery.

<Eitrigg pulls you aside.>

I suspect that Sauranok the Mystic is involved. I need you to uncover the truth, <name>.

The Twilight's Hammer has placed their agents within the ranks of the workers at the airship docks to spread their lies across the land. Speak with them. If you find evidence of Sauranok's guilt then show him what happens to traitors of the Horde.

==Completion==
Sauranok, Sauranok. His own visions worked against him. Twilight's Hammer probably corrupted him from afar. Bah! Weak! We'll speak his name no more.

I told him you were investigating the airship docks, <name>. To flush him out. Yes, I used you as bait. You served your Horde well, and deserve a reward for outing this viper from our midst.

==Notes==
Head for the south zeppelin tower that goes to Warsong Hold and Thunder Bluff. Speak to the Suspicious Peon inside.
:Zub zub.
:What? Two zubs not good 'nuff for you, <class>?
:{{gossip|''Has a secret cult infiltrated the Orgrimmar skyway?''}}
:Why ask me? I know nothing of the Twilight's Hammer.
:{{gossip|''I didn't say Twilight's hammer. YOU said Twilight's Hammer.''}}
:<The peon sweats and twitches.>
:I was ... what I meant ... um, bad!
:{{gossip|''I know all about your cult master.''}}
:<The peon's eyes widen in terror.>
:No! You've discovered Sauranok is the new cult leader in Orgrimmar? He told me his secret is safe!
:{{gossip|''So it's true? Sauranok IS guilty of treason!''}}
:{{text|say|Suspicious Peon|Wait, uh - you put words in my mouth! Not fair!}}
''Sauranok enters the tower and instantly kills the peon with a lightning bolt.''
:{{text|say|Sauranok the Mystic|Silence, idiot.}}
:{{text|say|Sauranok the Mystic|Hear anything interesting, <name>? Your little revelation about me is about to cost you your life.}}
:{{text|say|Sauranok the Mystic|The Twilight's Hammer has agents everywhere! Kill me and a dozen take my place!}}
:{{text|say|Sauranok the Mystic|My powers of sight... I beheld the future... I have seen what is to come...}}
:{{text|say|Sauranok the Mystic|This world unravels. If you could see the horrors I have seen... }}
:{{text|say|Sauranok the Mystic|To serve is madness, but defiance ... impossible!}}

===Other Skyway Peon responses===
* Cult? I don't know. Seen some suspicious types lingering around the south zeppelin tower, though.
* I don't know. Don't hit me!
* I don't know nothing! Ask the others.
* I hear strange orcs whispering all the time in the south zeppelin tower. They always shut up when I get near.
* Secret cult? You're not with those creepy orcs who lurk around the south zeppelin tower, are you?
* I'm too dumb to be in a cult. Been that way since I fell off the back of the zeppelin. And hit them propellers. Landed on a rock. They fixed my head up with a metal bowl to make it round and hard.{{spc}}<He thunks his fist against his skull.>{{spc}}Then the lightning done come.

I haven't given up my search for the Twilight's Hammer agents that lurk here in Orgrimmar. I need someone I can trust to collect the final evidence of treachery.

<Hellscream pulls you aside.>

Sauranok the Mystic - my own most trusted advisor! - is under suspicion. Uncover the truth, <name>, and you'll be rewarded.

I understand Twilight's Hammer has infiltrated workers at the airship docks, to spread their lies all over the continent. Question them. If you discover Sauranok's guilt... Kill him.
