== Objectives ==
Slay 12 [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists, either [[Depths Overseer]] or [[Twilight Miner]]s, within the [[Elementium Depths]].
*Elementium Depths cultists slain x12

== Description ==
You know, while we're here, we might as well take care of the Twilight's Hammer intruders. This place used to be ours, after all!

I'd help, but with my totems and weapons broken, I'm pretty helpless.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Let's take care of a few more of them, okay?

== Completion ==
They had it coming to them.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Little on the Side]] before heading out. Also, notice the [[Twilight Rune of Earth]] just to the south on the lower level. It starts [[Rune Ruination]].

Kill all the way to the back of the mine.

==Progression==
{{Twilight Gate}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
