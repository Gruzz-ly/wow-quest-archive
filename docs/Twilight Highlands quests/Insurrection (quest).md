==Objectives==
Arm 3 Dragonmaw Workers or Merchants, then slay 10 Dragonmaw Enforcers and 4 Dragonmaw Warlocks.
*Dragonmaw Civilian Armed (3)
*[[Dragonmaw Enforcer]] slain (10)
*[[Dragonmaw Warlock]] slain (4)

==Description==
The weapons the Horde has supplied us with will be more than enough. The four of us should split up and arm as many Dragonmaw workers and merchants as we can.

Don't underestimate us, <name>. You'll find even our tradesmen are ferocious in battle.

Let's do as much damage as possible. Arm a squad of Dragonmaw and lay waste to the fel enforcers and warlocks that have intimidated my people for so long. Then meet back here to launch our final strike!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ring of Rebellion
|Shackle-Shatter Wand}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|27}}
*25460 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonmaw Clan]]

==Progress==
Revolution, at last!

The Dragonmaw are finally undoing the shackles of the filth who have held us back!

==Completion==
We've lost a lot of good orcs, but the fight is going our way, <name>.

Mor'ghor's regime is collapsing. All that remains is to destroy the beast himself.

==Notes==
Dragonmaw Enforcers and Warlocks can be found around the Port, usually in conflict with Dragonmaw Workers or Merchants. They can be fought solo, but arming civilians makes it easier. 

Dragonmaw Civilians can be recruited in one of two ways per head - you can give them blades and arm them as Dragonmaw Warriors, rendering them DPS units, or give them warhammers and turn them into Dragonmaw Shamans, who combined buffing your "group" with the power to heal. After that, it is a simple matter of killing any enemies left to be counted up and reporting back to Zaela to continue. 

It is advisable to set yourself up in a manner similar to the standard 5-player dungeon group, as in the subsequent quest [[Death to Mor'ghor|Death to Mor'ghor]] you face off against fel orc Warchief in the flesh - and he has elite status; thus, your choices should be built around your character's role in a group, and bare in mind that Zaela will fight him with you as an extra DPS.
