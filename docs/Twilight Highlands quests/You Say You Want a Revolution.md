==Objectives==
Slip through the front lines at [[Dragonmaw Port]] and speak with [[Zaela]].

==Description==
If what you say is true, <name>, then we have friends within the [[Dragonmaw Clan]]. We can support an insurgency from within their ranks and avoid a lot of bloodshed on both sides.

I can help, but the most dangerous part is up to you.

My [[Axebite Warrior]]s will launch an offensive on the shores. During the confusion, I need you to slip behind the lines and speak with your revolutionary contact, Zaela.

We'll arm the Dragonmaw and overthrow their fel masters!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|80}}
*9550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonmaw Clan]]

==Completion==
<name>, what are your people doing? Are you attacking the Dragonmaw or are you here to rid us of Mor'ghor's corruption?

<Zaela listens to the plan.>

Ah, I see now. I like the way you think. [[Warchief Mor'ghor]] won't even know what hit him.

Let's do this!
