==Objectives==
Use the Barbed Fleshook to dismount and kill 4 Thundermar Gryphon Riders.
* [[Thundermar Gryphon Rider]] slain (4)
* [[Barbed Fleshhook]] (provided)

==Description==
A single Dragonmaw drake is worth a dozen Wildhammer gryphon-riders. Take them off of their lice-ridden birds and they're nothing.

Even you can slay them easily, Horde-<class>.

Hunt gryphon riders flying over the river north of [[Bloodgulch]]. Take this hook and fling it at them as they fly by. Their momentum will hurl them from their mount, right to your feet. Finish them! Kill a few Thundermar gryphon riders and I'll believe your Horde is as mighty as you say.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9}}

==Completion==
You look a little battered. Those dwarves didn't give you any challenge, did they?

Still, that was an impressive show.

==Progression==
{{The Northern Flank}}
