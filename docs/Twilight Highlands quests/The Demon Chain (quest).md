== Objectives ==
Acquire the Demon Chain.
* [[The Demon Chain]]

== Description ==
[[Narkrall Rakeclaw|Narkrall]] revealed to me the secret of his influence over the drakes in this area. I thought the Demon Chain was a myth, but he's had it all along.

And now the fool is about to lose it!

His life is meaningless to me but the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] can't afford to lose that artifact. Follow him north, up to [[Thundermar]]. The city will be in chaos, so you may be able to land undetected. Return to me with the Demon Chain, even if you have to remove it from Narkrall's corpse.

Find that artifact, <name>!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|80}}

== Progress ==
Do you have it? Yes? The fate of the Dragonmaw depends on the Demon Chain!

== Completion ==
<Zaela takes the gore-spattered length of chain and wraps it around her hand and wrist.>

If the stories are true, <name>, it was on this length of chain that [[Deathwing]] had once fastened the [[Demon Soul]], forged in his bid to control the other dragonflights. The Demon Stone has long been destroyed but perhaps this hunk of elementium holds some residual power...

You've done a great thing today.

== Notes ==
Although Narkrall is dead, the dwarves have not yet taken the chain, you will find it beside his corpse on a hill. {{co|49.10|28.20|Twilight Highlands}}
