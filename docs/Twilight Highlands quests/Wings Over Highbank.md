== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Thordun Hammerblow}} and fly together back to [[Highbank]].
*Thordun Hammerblow Flown to Highbank

== Description ==
Aye, look! I think she's perkin' up already.

Okay, <Mr./Miss> Alliance fancy-pants <class>. Is that your base I see on the shore? "Highbank" you say. Can me and my bird hunker down there until she's better?

Hop on! We'll fly together back to Highbank!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
What's the news from the peninsula, <name>?

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>!  Aiding that downed [[Gryphon rider|gryphon-rider]] has given us our first contact with the old [[Wildhammer clan]]s.  We'll be able to find out who's still left, and in what numbers.

Our campaign is looking up!

== Notes ==
Speak with him again:
:Well then. Ready to fly?
:{{gossip|I'm ready. Let's go!}}
:{{text|say|Thordun Hammerblow|Hop aboard, <name>. Let's move!}}
:''Thordun directs Lightning back over the middle of the shores bearing back to Highperch.''
:{{text|say|Thordun Hammerblow|I hope you Alliance are here to give them [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw Orcs]] a good thumpin'.}}
:''Thordun circles the keep, landing in the courtyard.''
:{{text|say|Thordun Hammerblow|You've got quite the setup here, friend. Come with me while I find out who's in charge.}}
:''Thordun runs in the keep, heading back to the back.''
:{{text|say|Thordun Hammerblow|Stuff me like a haggis! Kurdran Wildhammer - in the flesh. He lives!}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Aye, friend. How fare the Wildhammer clans? We've much to discuss!}}
