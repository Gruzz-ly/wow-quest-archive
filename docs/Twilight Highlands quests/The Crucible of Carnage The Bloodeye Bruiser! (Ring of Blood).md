Get in the arena at the [[Crucible of Carnage]] and defeat Hurp'derp!
*[[Hurp'derp]] defeated
*Suggested Players [5]

== Description ==
I was wondering when you'd show up, <name>! Having a past champion of the Ring of Blood here will be a huge draw! We're gonna be rich, buddy! RICH!

Anyway, this is some old Dragonmaw fighting pit. Didn't take much modification to tune it up to our uses. I put out a few feelers, and got some heavy hitters from all around Azeroth to join in the carnage. Bout time to make some gold!

You know the drill, <name>. When you're ready, let me know and we'll get this show on the road! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|28|20}} (at max level)

Not bad, friend. You might make some gold out here - if you manage to stay alive.

== Notes ==
Round one, Hurp'derp! An elite ogre lord with the following abilities:
