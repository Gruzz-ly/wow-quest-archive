== Objectives ==
Meet with [[Lirastrasza]] at [[Vermillion Redoubt]].
* Meet with Lirastrasza

== Description ==
Good. You're back! Saving the world again I assume.

I was dispatched to establish relations with the [[red dragonflight|red dragons]] in the area, but I'm finding this bunch somewhat less accommodating than the ones at [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]] were. I have, however, been told that you are the type that solves problems.

A problem solver as it were.

I need you to gain the trust of Lirastrasza at Vermillion Redoubt to the southwest. Our association with the Dragonmaw has complicated things, but I'm hoping you can ease relations.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|10}} (or {{cost|12|40|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
I'm glad Lira didn't scare you off. I won't say her concerns aren't warranted, but we have a common enemy. She is perhaps a bit overzealous.

== Notes ==
Head to the southwest, past the ruins and the ogre camp. Aim for the red tree peaking over the mountain. Fly in and a Vermillion Sentinel will stun the player and take it over to Lirastrasza. She will fly in and shift to her elven form before telling off the player and flying away.

His gossip text:
:Deathwing has returned. He's seized Grim Batol and much of the highlands, and I feel near powerless to stop him.
:Soon, our queen shall arrive, and together we shall put the once Earthwarder in his place.
