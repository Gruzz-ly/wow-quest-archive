==Objectives==
Slay 8 Obsidian Pyrewings after using the Wyrmhunter Hooks to reach them.
*[[Obsidian Pyrewing]] slain x8
*[[Wyrmhunter Hooks]] (provided)

==Description==
The Twilight Drakehunters used vicious implements to drag our circling drakes from the sky. Hooks that buried into their scales and held the Twilight secure while they brought our kin to the ground.

We are past the point of peace. Past hope for their redemption. The only mercy we have left to offer the black flight is the oblivion that they so passionately pursue.

Use these hooks to slay the Obsidian Pyrewings to the south. They should allow you much maneuverability in the air if used right.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dragonwing Leggings|Nightscale Girdle|Wyrmhunter Spaulders}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

==Progress==
Trust me, I know how disgraceful it sounds. We have a grim task ahead of us, but tenderness and sympathy must be put aside in these moments... for the sake of all life.

==Completion==
You seem to have made use of the disturbing implements with ease.

I take solace in knowing that some tools of evil can ultimately still lead to safeguarding life. Nothing is without purpose.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Fitting End]] and [[Shining Through the Dark]] before heading out. Dragonspawn on the ground. Drakes up in the air. Use the hook, flying or not, to get on the back of a drake and wail on it. When it's near death, a boss emote triggers warning players to hop to another drake:
:{{text|bossemote|The drake under you is mortally wounded and about to fall! Move to another drake, quickly!}}
