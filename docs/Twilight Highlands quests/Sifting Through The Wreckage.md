== Objectives ==
Search for the bodies of 12 Dunwald victims.
*{{NPC||Dunwald Victim}}s found x12

== Description ==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] were damn thorough when they sacked our town. Me and me brothers may well be the only one's that held'm back. I gotta be sure though.

As you're siftin through the ruins, keep an eye out for the bodies of me kinsmen. I wanna know if dere were any survivors... or if it seems like some might have gotten away.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
What's the news, <race>?

== Completion ==
That many dead, eh? Not seemin' likely that anyone outside of me brothers fought through it then. I guess I already expected as much. Thanks for takin' the time to look for me.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Donnelly Dunwald]], [[Eoin Dunwald]], [[Cayden Dunwald]] and [[While Meeting The Family]] before heading out.
