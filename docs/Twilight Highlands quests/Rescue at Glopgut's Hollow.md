== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Colin Thundermar}} at [[Glopgut's Hollow]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
Well speak of the devil in a blue dress. {{NPC||Fanny Thundermar||Fanny's}} gone and gotten herself kidnapped by ogres!

I don't trust the Thundermars to be able to mount a rescue on their own. I'll round up my gryphon riders and provide some air support.

I'm sure they can use an extra <class> down there, <name>. Grab your gear and look for Colin Thundermar in the Glopgut ogre camp. It's southwest of here, below the cliffs. Hurry now!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Good to have you fighting at my side again, <name>!

And I see the Firebeards have come as well. I suppose they'll provide a distraction while me and my boys do the heavy lifting.

== Notes ==
Sigh. Back to the southwest, past the [[Humboldt Conflagration]]. Fly deep inside the hollow to find Colin on the ground by a few banners.

==Progression==
{{Wild, Wild, Wildhammer Wedding}}
