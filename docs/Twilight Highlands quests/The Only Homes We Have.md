==Objectives==
Extinguish 50 fires at [[Firebeard's Patrol]].
*Village Fires Extinguished
*[[Wildhammer Water Bucket]] (provided)

==Description==
We've already been pushed back farther than I'd hoped, but I'm not about to give up our homes to these mongrels. They may burn them, pillage them, and spit on the rubbled remains, but we'll still fight to take them back.

That being said, I rather like them not burnt. I have the boys running buckets from the well to try to keep the fire down. If you'd join them, they can help out by tossing you buckets so you don't have to make the runs.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

==Progress==
As long as we work together, we can overcome anything the [[Twilight's Hammer]] might throw at us.

==Completion==
Thanks for your help. Every little bit makes a difference.

We'll keep the water going until we can push the Twilight back.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Welcome Relief]] and [[Small Comforts]] before heading out. Players are handed a water bucket, and there are more by the well. This works just like the [[Hallow's End]] events all over Azeroth. The Wildhammer will be glad to throw buckets, so just use them.
*Over there! The fire's flarin' up!
*We've got your back.
*Ready for some more?
*Keep it up.
*Take this!
*We're not done yet.
*Ready for some more?
*Here's some more water.
