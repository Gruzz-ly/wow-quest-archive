==Objectives==
Slay [[Muddied Water Elemental]]s to collect 5 Whirlpool Cores.
*[[Whirlpool Core]] (5)

==Description==
The elemental powers are strong here in the [[Twilight Highlands|Highlands]], <name>. It is why [[Twilight's Hammer]] chose to build their stronghold here.

In the right hands, we can channel this energy into something productive... like a portal directly to [[Orgrimmar]].

Northwest of here, at the [[Verrall Delta|Verrall River Delta]], water elementals have been stirred up by the actions of our foes upstream. Destroy them and gather 5 whirlpool cores. You'll not only calm the river, you'll power up our portal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*12730 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
I hope the fighting within the river wasn't too dangerous.

==Completion==
These are perfect! The restless waters of that troubled river will now do much more than move silt or stone... They'll move you across continents.

Finish up the rest of your business here in Dragonmaw and then we should be able to proceed.
