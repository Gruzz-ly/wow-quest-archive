== Objectives ==
Get a Wildhammer Hellions squad from [[Angus Stillmountain]] and then escort them to the drop off point in the [[Twilight Gate]].
* Get Wildhammer squad
*SI:7 dropped off

== Description ==
[[Mathias Shaw]] and the [[SI:7]] are here to assist us with operations up top in the [[Twilight Citadel]]. I need you to escort them there.

The Wildhammer are being kind enough to give us a lift in. The agents have some things that they need to do down in the Twilight Gate area first, though.

Speak with Angus Stillmountain and get yourself a squad to drop off. You'll fly them in. A big blue X marks the spot.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
I need you to escort those SI:7 agents safely to their destination, <name>.

== Completion ==
That must have been deadly.

While I don't approve of their methods, no one can question the effectiveness of Master Mathias Shaw and his SI:7. Not to mention that you're here. Our victory is all but assured.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Ogres & Ettins (Alliance)|Ogres & Ettins]] and [[Call in the Artillery (Alliance)|Call in the Artillery]] before heading out.

Angus Stillmountain stands next to the flight master. Talk to him:
:There's nothing more exciting than to soar through the air.
:Well, maybe to fight while soaring through the air, and a good tankard of ale afterward!
{{gossip|''Angus, I'm here to lead the Wildhammer squad and drop off the [[SI:7 Agent (Twilight Highlands)|SI:7 agents]].''}}
:Well, why didn't you say so? Give those Twilight cultists a good one from me, will ya?
:''A squad of Wildhammer Hellion fly in.''
*{{text|say|Wildhammer Hellion|Hang on tight. It's going to get bumpy!}}
*{{text|say|Wildhammer Hellion|Let's get these humans to the drop point.}}
Hop on a flying mount and head in. The drop point is marked by a blue X at {{co|39.2|64.5|Twilight Highlands}} on the northern part of the gate. Then start killing and marking.
