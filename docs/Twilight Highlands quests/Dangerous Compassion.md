==Objectives==
Bring the Crate of Dragonmaw Bandages back to [[Warlord Krogg]] off the coast of [[Dragonmaw Port]].
*[[Crate of Dragonmaw Bandages]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[red dragonflight]] represents the aspect of life. As such, their blood has healing properties.

This crate of bandages has been soaked in red dragon blood. It is the last of my supply. May it bring a speedy recovery to your warriors.

Whatever the outcome of your negotiations here, do not forget that you have friends among the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Blood-Bind Sandals
|Dragonheart Bracers
|Heartblood Gauntlets}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|50}}
*6370 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Do you bring any hope for our wounded?

==Completion==
Dragon's Blood!? We best not tell our red dragon allies that we've used these.

Still, it's powerful magic... We'll have our fighting force back in no time.
