== Objectives ==
Slay Debilitated Apexar, Debilitated Aetheron, and Debilitated Edemantus.
* [[Debilitated Apexar]] slain
*[[Debilitated Aetharon]] slain
*[[Debilitated Edemantus]] slain

== Description ==
I used to be the caretaker of the [[Earthen Ring]]'s portals here. But while we were away helping to save [[Deepholm]], the [[Twilight's Hammer]] moved in and corrupted the area.

They're using powerful [[Elemental ascendant|ascendants]] to guard our portals. That's where they've made a critical error.

I want you to go to the portals and use the controllers to overload them. This will unleash all of the portal's energy, debilitating the ascendant. Slay it.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Portal-Sealer's Breastplate|Deepdigger Helm|Darklight Torch}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
We need those portals shutdown and their ascendant guardians slain, <class>.

== Completion ==
The last portal is deep within the mine here, but we'll deal with that in a bit.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Spirit of the Loch]] and [[Unbinding]] before heading out.

Aetharon, guardian of the air portal, is first, east of Yevaa, north of the altar on a floating rock formation. In his normal state, Aetharon is a level 85 elite ascendant with 774k health. Debilitated, he is down to 154k health, but still hits very hard. Pop trinkets and fight defensively. Apexar, guardian of the earth portal is next, just east of the citadel. Same statistics as Aetharon. Finally, Edemantus, guardian of the water portal, can be found on the island in [[Loch Verrall]]. Same statistics as the earlier two.

While up at the loch, speak with Countess Verrall, who can be found on the bottom of the western side of the lake.
