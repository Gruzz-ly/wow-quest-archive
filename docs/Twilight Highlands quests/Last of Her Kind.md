== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Obsidia.jpg|Obsidia|One of the last breeding black dragons in all of Azeroth.}}
Kill Obsidia.
*[[Obsidia]] defeated

== Description ==
Obsidia is one of the last mature dragons that can continue the [[black dragonflight]] bloodline. She must be killed.

If you succeed in killing her, you should inform Lirastrasza immediately of your victory. She's been fighting a long time to see this done.

Thank you for being our fang in these battles. You've proven a powerful ally.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Bracers of Final Memories|Hood of Lost Solitude|Waistguard of Twilight Finality}}
You will receive: {{cost|18|80}} (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)

== Completion ==
You killed Obsidia within her own lair? Impressive, <race>. I'm sorry that I could not be there.

You're true to your word, and you most certainly have the bite to back your bellow. Thank you.

== Notes ==
[[File:Last of Her Kind.jpg|thumb|Obsidia and Baleflame]]
On accept, Obsidia flies down from on high.
:{{text|yell|Obsidia|Baleflame! Your tender flesh shall be an appropriate meal for my whelps!}}
She is a level 85 elite black dragon with 774k health and a few abilities
*{{abilities|Summon Whelps|notes=A few whelps with 4000 health each, but hitting for less than 100 on cloth.}}
**{{text|yell|Obsidia|Come, my children! Awaken and feast upon their flesh!}}
*{{abilities|Lava Spout|notes=Triggers...}}
**{{abilities|Lava Pool}}
*{{abilities|Flame Breath|notes=Standard dragon breath attack.}}
Let Baleflame tank her. She will not be able to finish her off alone, so help her out. Dodge the lava pools, which are announced by a gout of fire shooting up a few seconds before it spawns. Focus on her unless the whelps are annoying, then take them out and go back to focusing on her.

On death:
:{{text|yell|Obsidia|No ! My clutch is the last...! Father... I've failed you...}}
:{{text|say|Baleflame|Well done. Find Lirastrasza and ler her know that we've succeeded.}}
