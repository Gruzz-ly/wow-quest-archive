==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Brain of Iso'rath.jpg|Iso'rath|Host of Nightmares.}}
Destroy the [[Brain of Iso'rath]].
* Kill [[Iso'rath]]

==Description==
Iso'rath's brain is revealed! The shaman you've saved should keep you somewhat safe amidst his defenses.

Strike at the brain and destroy Iso'rath!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Woundseal Leggings|Weeping Scar Cover|Nightmare Choker}}
You will receive: {{cost|28|20}} and [[Consumed by Nightmare]]

==Completion==
You saved many of my closest allies today, <name>. I can only imagine what horrors you witnessed within Iso'rath, but you have the thanks of all of the Earthen Ring.

==Notes==
The Brain of Iso'rath is a boss level mob with 1.6 million health. Duarn and Mylra will both chain heal for 16,000 health, Dimblaze will Bloodlust. Duarn will also pop a Field of Restoration like the four surrounding the area. This will probably take a while, so act like it's a fight for survival, not a DPS race. Iso'rath will chain cast Mind Flay and Digestive Burst, and the stacking debuff aura is still in effect.

Once Iso'rath dies, Yevaa snags the player and takes a gryphon back to the surface.
