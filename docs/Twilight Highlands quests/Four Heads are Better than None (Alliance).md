== Objectives ==
Collect the four heads of [[Za'brox]] and [[Beeble'phod]].
*[[Za's Head]]
*[[Phod's Head]]
*[[Beeble's Head]]
*[[Brox's Head]]

== Description ==
Now while the attack upon the [[Twilight Gate]] is launched, there is one last loose end to tie up: Za'brox and Beeble'phod, the disciples of [[Cho'gall]].

Intelligence has placed them within the [[Den of the Disciples]], a small ogre cave at the southwest corner of the Twilight Gate.

You're fairly certain that [[Cassius the White|Cassius]] and [[Kurdran Wildhammer|Kurdran]] will want proof of their deaths.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Spaulders of Gruesome Accomplishment|Za'brox's Lucky Tooth|Skull Carrier}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Is that blood dripping from your pack?

== Completion ==
<The paladin frowns.>

That's quite a gruesome trophy collection you have there. I would have believed you if you had simply said they were dead. Regardless, thank you for having the foresight to take care of them.

The Twilight Gate will soon be ours. Time to move up to the [[Twilight Citadel]].

== Notes ==
The mouth of the cave can be found at {{co|39.9|71.3|Twilight Highlands}} to the southwest. Both ogre magi are level 85 with 154k health. Enter, take the north fork, kill [[Beeble'phod]], loot his two heads, turn around, take the west fork, kill [[Za'brox]], loot his two heads and return to [[Victor's Point]].
