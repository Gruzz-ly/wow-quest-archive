== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Master Mathias Shaw]] in [[Dragonmaw Pass]].

== Description ==
Recent events make it even more apparent that holing up here and making sporadic attacks on [[Grim Batol]] isn't enough to keep our kind safe, much less retake Grim Batol. We need to be more aggressive, we need to strike into their heart.

I've agreed to send dragons to the aid of your commanders. They were already hatching a plan to strike at Grim Batol, so you should focus your attention there first.

You should be able to find Mathias Shaw in Dragonmaw Pass, in the canyon below us to the south.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}} (or {{cost|8|27}} at max level)

== Completion ==
The red dragons have agreed to help! No small feat, I'm sure. You have the thanks of the Alliance.

We'd already laid out plans for our ambush on a Twilight caravan by the time the dragons contacted us. They're helping by cutting off their retreat.

The battle still rages. You can definitely be of aid.

== Notes ==
Down to the southwest, in what used to be the [[Wetlands]], is the Dragonmaw Pass.

His gossip text:
:The dragons have bought us an opportunity to sieze the gates from the Twilight's Hammer. We would do well not to waste it.
