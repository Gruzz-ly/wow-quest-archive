On accept, Kiro hops up on Sasha's back and rides off northeast, jumping over obstacles along the way:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|Let's get moving. The peons can't be far.}}

Upon reaching the [[Dunwald Holdout]], which now has a new area called the [[Peon Hideout]]:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|Sasha's snout says this is the place. Maybe they're in one of these houses?}}
:''Kiro dismounts and goes to stand in front of the main building.''
:{{Text|say|Kiro|Head inside and check things out. I'll keep watch.}}

Head into the building and down into the cellar, where a group of [[Crushblow Peon]]s are listening to a speech by [[Foreman Magrok]].
:{{Text|say|Foreman Magrok|Throw down your tools and raise up your fists!}}
:{{Text|say|Crushblow Peon|Yeah!}}
:{{Text|say|Crushblow Peon|Yeah!}}
:{{Text|say|Foreman Magrok|What's this? Someone from [[Orgrimmar]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Foreman Magrok|Are you finally ready to hear our demands?}}

Start questioning the peons, who all express their displeasure at the situation:
*Foreman Magrok cares about us peons.
*Me no take orders from the [[Horde]] no more.
*Me not go back there!
*Me won't build that outpost!
*This meeting's for peons only!
:{{Gossip|Why aren't you working?}}
::''(First peon)'' {{Text|say|Tools broken. Had to use hands. Now they break too!}}
::''(Second peon)'' {{Text|say|Peons treated like [[Work is da poop|da poop]]. Never get nothing nice.}}
::''(Third peon)'' {{Text|say|Always been a peon. Never nothing else. Maybe want more?}}

As soon as you finish questioning the workers, Magrok briefly resumes his speech:
:{{Text|say|Foreman Magrok|When I'm [[warchief]], peons will be respected members of the Horde!}}

Before you leave the cellar, Magrok has some gossip text as well:
:You'd better be here to help the peon's plight, otherwise--get out!

Head back outside to turn in to Kiro.
