== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Keegan Firebeard}} at [[Firebeard's Patrol]].

== Description ==
Shame about the Doyles. It's a fair miracle that so many of us made it out as is though, so can't count it much as a surprise.

Those louts at [[Thundermar]] are cowards. Even after tellin' them it was Keegan askin', they won't set foot outside of their town. I did rope in the Moores though, so that's at least three clans' worth.

Keegan wanted to hear from ya personally when you returned. Go find'm in town.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}}

== Completion ==
It seems you had some luck bringin' riders back. Well timed too - we just pushed the elementals back, so we should have the arm room to lead an attack right away.

Thank you, <name>. You're a good <race>.

== Notes ==
Keegan has gotten things under control back at town. The other clans that have been recruited are there, as well as all of the utility NPCs.

==Progression==
{{Firebeard's Patrol}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
