==Objectives==
Use the portal in Dragonmaw Port to go to Orgrimmar and report to [[High Overlord Saurfang]].

==Description==
The portal is ready!

It's not powerful enough to transport an army, but we can maintain the connection long enough to allow important individuals to pass back and forth.

Saurfang will want to know about our progress here. Walk through the portal to Orgrimmar, then deliver the news him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1270 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
<class>, you've returned from Dragonmaw. The portal is functioning then? Good.

Before you return to your work there, we've got some dirty business to clean up right here in Orgrimmar...

==Previous version==
