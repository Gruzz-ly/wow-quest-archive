==Objectives==
Use the Water of Life to extract information from the [[Corpse of Forgemaster Finlay]].
* Artifact information extracted
* [[Water of Life]] (provided)

==Description==
Take my Water of Life and pass it into the corpse of the drowned dwarf.

He was a worker of metals in life, and though his body now feeds my loch, the Water will allow him to tell you what you want to know.

Then, take your information and be gone from my demesne.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Soulgrowth Spaulders|Grips of the Damned Mind|Mindsear Shanker}}
You will also receive: {{cost|18|80}} (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)

==Completion==
The Hammer of Twilight? And you say you got this information out of a drowned Wildhammer dwarf?

You're kidding, right?

==Notes==
Head to the northeast side of the loch. Forgemaster's drowned corpse can be found at {{co|35.1|61.1|Twilight Highlands}} floating chained to an anchor.

Use the water:
