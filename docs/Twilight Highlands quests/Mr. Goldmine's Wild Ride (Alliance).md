== Description ==
Okay, <name>, we need to get to the earth portal at the back of the cave.

I've "procured" a ride for us. Why walk when we can ride in style? I hope you don't mind mine carts.

Let me know when you're ready.

Oh no! My weapons and totems! They're destroyed!!!

== Notes ==
Talk to him again.

:''The mine cart goes for a wild ride. Completely unexpectedly, it falls down a mine shaft!''
:{{text|yell|Initiate Goldmine|OH NO!}}
:''Goldmine's totems and weapons fly from the cart.''
:{{text|yell|Initiate Goldmine|My totems!!!}}
:''The cart keeps moving down the hill and is about to fly into a deep chasm.''
:{{text|yell|Initiate Goldmine|JUMP!!!}}
:''Goldmine and the player jump out of the cart, narrowly avoiding liquification.''
Talk to Goldmine again:
:You're gonna have to protect me, <name>. Without my weapons and totems, I'm defenseless!
