==Objectives==
Speak with [[Artesh]] at [[Dragonmaw Port]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

==Description==
Something troubles me, <name>. The [[twilight dragonflight|twilight dragon]]s knew just where and when to strike our airfleet. It's as if they knew our plans.

[[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight]] spies cower within our midst!

I'm going to take one of our remaining ships back to [[Orgrimmar]] to roll some heads. I need you to stay behind and secure this front. The [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] shaman are powerful; I have asked them to open up a portal to Orgrimmar, and I need you to help.

So. Start helping!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1270 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
Your Warchief is decisive, <name>. He makes things happen. I like him.

Let's talk about this portal that he wants!
