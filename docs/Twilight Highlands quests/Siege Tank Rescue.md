== Objectives ==
Speak with a Siege Tank Commander standing on top of a crippled Highbank Siege Tank. Defend the tank while engineers make repairs.
*{{NPC||Siege Tank Commander}} Spoken To
*Siege Tank Defended
*[[Crate of Abused Parts]] (provided)

== Description ==
One by one, we're gonna have to pull our siege tanks outta the muck. Take these 'ere spare parts you've collected and give 'em to a siege tank commander who's standing on top of a gimped-up machine.

Then defend the tank while engineers de-gimpify it.

Go an' make me proud, <class>!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Tread-Bind Spaulders|Nature-Crush Helm|Tank-Defending Treads}}
You will also receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
Rocks an' stumps an' hills an' mud... Bah.

I hate nature.

== Completion ==
Yep, one more tank limpin' back home for repairs.

All these trees an' stumps an' mud an' rock - you coulnae drive a golfball into this turf, much less a tank.

We're gonna need a new approach.

==Notes==
Head down to the southwest. Find a Siege Tank Commander that is willing to talk.
{{Dialogue|
She's hung up in the debris and I've lost steam pressure. This terrain is murder!

Can you get us out of this?

{{gossip|Here are some spare parts. I'll cover you while you make repairs!}}

:{{text|say|Siege Tank Commander|Aye, protect the tank while the boys make repairs! I'll try to get her moving again...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Defend the Siege Tank!}}
:''A slow stream of five or six Axebite Grunts with only 16104 health come out of the distance focusing on the engineers. Keep the engineers alive!''
:{{text|say|Siege Tank Commander|Ahh, blast it. C'mon, c'mon already!}}
Victory!
:{{text|bossemote|Success! The Siege Tank is able to retreat.}}
:{{text|say|Siege Tank Commander|There! We got it! Let's get 'er outta here.}}

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Highbank!}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Hotfix|date=2010-12-14|bluenote=[[Axebite Grunt]]s now despawn whenever the siege tanks get healed and leave, or if they get destroyed. The [[Siege Tank Commander]]s are now flagged as immune creatures and no longer get stuck in combat, which prevented players from interacting with them. In addition, players can no longer attack Siege Tank Commanders.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
