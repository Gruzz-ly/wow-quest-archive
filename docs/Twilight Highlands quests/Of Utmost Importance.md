== Objectives ==
Recover the Induction Samophlange.
* [[Induction Samophlange]]

== Description ==
When [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]]'s zeppelin went down, so did the induction samophlange that you recovered for us in [[Azshara]]. The Alliance have it somewhere in that keep, and [[Captain Krazz|Krazz]] wants it back.

The basement of the keep would be my best guess, so start there. When you get your hands on it, bring it back to me near the eastern tower.

You will receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*55200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

Krazz is waitin'. Keep it moving.

== Completion ==
Brilliant! Krazz will love you something mighty for bringing this one home. Good on you.
