== Objectives ==
Scout the Beach Head Control Point on the [[Twilight Shore (Twilight Highlands)|Twilight Shore]]. You don't need to capture it, but doing so will give your side a combat advantage and flag you for PvP.
* Beach Head Control Point Scouted

== Description ==
If the Alliance gains control of this peninsula, they will threaten [[Dragonmaw Port]]. Not going to happen.

South of here you'll see a small hill with a commanding view of the shoreline. Whoever controls that hill will have the upper hand all along the shore!

Rush over there and scout the beach head control point. It's marked by that enormous flag. Then return to me.

You don't have to capture it, unless you're spoiling for a fight with the Alliance.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}}

== Progress ==
What's the state of the beach head, <name>?

== Completion ==
Good work, <class>. Now you know the lay of the land.

If you're ever having difficulty fighting here on the Twilight Shores, remember that capturing and holding the Beach Head will give all Horde forces here a combat advantage!

== Notes ==
The flag is found at {{co|77.44|65.18|Twilight Highlands}}. You do not need to capture the flag to complete the objective.
