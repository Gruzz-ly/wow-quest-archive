== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Dragonmaw Skyclaws on foot.
*[[Dragonmaw Skyclaw]] slain x8

== Description ==
I'll hand it to you and your [[Alliance]] friends. You've really worked the Dragonmaw over!

Many of their riders are dismounted but they're still coming at us, and my defenders will be overrun without help.

Kill Dragonmaw Skyclaws on foot and[[ Thundermar]] will forever be in your debt!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
We'd best finish fighting and put these fires out, or Thundermar will look like the rest of the wreckage...

== Completion ==
You sure know your way around a battlefield, <class>. It looks like they're about to fall back.

All we need is one decisive blow...

== Notes ==
Colin offers this with a yell after [[Tear Them From the Sky!]]. His new gossip text:
:This is it! They're making their final assault. There's no place to run. We hold Thundermar or die with hammer in hand.
:For the Wildhammer!!

==Progression==
