== Objectives ==
Retrieve a Twilight Caravan Gatestone. The [[Twilight Spearwarder|Spearwardens]] should carry keys that can get you into the gatestone chests.
*[[Twilight Caravan Cargo Key]]
*[[Twilight's Hammer Gatestone]]

== Description ==
The gates further down the canyon are shut. Our scouting revealed a stone that they carried in chests in their caravans that they used to open the gates.

Get down there and look for a chest key on the bodies of the guards. When you find it, use it on one of those chests on the caravan wagons and bring the gatestone back to me.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Spear-Impaled Leggings|Gatekeeper's Helm}}You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
They've grown overconfident. More and more, that seems the downfall of the most powerful armies.

== Completion ==
Good going.

Doesn't look like much, does it?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Easy Pickings (Alliance)|Easy Pickings]] before heading out. Kill spearwarders until the key drops, then loot a chest, then go back to killing spearwarders to hit the quota.

==Progression==
{{Vermillion Redoubt}}
