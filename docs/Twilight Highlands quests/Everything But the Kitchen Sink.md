== Objectives ==
Slay 15 Wildhammer Stormtalons.
* Hop into a Krazz Cannon
* [[Wildhammer Stormtalon]] slain (15)

== Description ==
You gotta do something about them Wildhammer Stormtalons. They're tearing us up!

Problem is, we're out of ammo, so we had to improvise. We loaded up my Krazz Cannons with all kinds of stuff: pool ponies, [[Kaja'Cola]] cans, food containers, fuelcells, tires... you get the picture.

Basically, everything but the kitchen sink.

Think you're in the mood for some target practice?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gunnery Gloves
|Rivetproof Chestguard
|Tool-Bracing Armguards
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18}}
*69000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Whatsa matter? You go blind? Can't you see we're still being creamed here?

Get back on one of those cannons and pulverize those Wildhammmer!

== Completion ==
That's the spirit! Must be pretty humiliating being shot down by junk.
