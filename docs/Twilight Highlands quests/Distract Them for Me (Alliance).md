== Objectives ==
Slay Dame Alys Finnsson, Master Klem, and Mia the Rose.
* [[Dame Alys Finnsson]] slain
* [[Master Klem]] slain
* [[Mia the Rose]] slain

== Description ==
There are three candidates for Ascendancy that we need to eliminate: Dame Alys Finnsson, Master Klem, and Mia the Rose.

I'd like for you to serve as my distraction. When the time is right, I'll step in and finish them off from behind.

Whatever you do, <name>, do not underestimate them. Each got to where they are by being ruthless and very good at what they do.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Rose-Scented Hood|Dame's Scaled Greaves|Klem's Rusted Gauntlets}}
You will also receive: {{cost|18|80}} (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)

== Progress ==
They're not all dead yet.

== Completion ==
That takes care of most of their leaders outside of the [[Bastion of Twilight]].

We work well together, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Elementium Axe (Alliance)|The Elementium Axe]] before heading out. First, head just to the southeast. In the center of a pit is Master Klem, a level 85 elite human warrior with 387k health. Aggro him, knock off 20% of his health and keep him still as Shaw will spawn 20 yards behind him and stealth up to him.
:{{text|yell|Master Klem|You've come for training. Good!}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|That was fun.}}
Shaw, once he gets in range, will stunlock and finish Klem off. Head to the southeast next. Just south of [[Cannon's Inferno]] is a big twilight building with Mia the Rose inside. She is a level 85 elite night elf rogue with 387k health. Same as before, knock off at least 20% of her health before Shaw will spawn. Pop trinkets and fight defensively, she hits hard.
:{{text|yell|Mia the Rose|I knew you were coming. No one can resist me, not even you!}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|You're telegraphing your moves.}}
Blindeye is just to the west, at the [[Altar of Ascension]], so take a slight detour and kill him. He is a level 85 ettin with 154k health. Shaw will not help out on this kill, however.

Finally, keep heading southwest. In the shadow of the Twilight Altar is a small building just to the west of it. Inside is Dame Alys Finnsson, a level 85 elite worgen druid with 387k health. She fights in cat form.
:{{text|yell|Dame Alys Finnsson|We could have been civil about this, but no!}}
