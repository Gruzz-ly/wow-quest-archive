==Objectives==
Give promotions to a few of the [[Crushblow Peon]]s at [[Peon Hideout]].
*Peons promoted (3)

==Description==
I agree with the plight of the [[peon]]s. They should be rewarded for the work they do.

It's unlikely that the [[Horde]] will agree to increase their wages, but there's no reason they can't be given a promotion.

Any title other than peon would help build some confidence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Have the peons been promoted yet?

==Completion==
I am sure your praise means a lot to the peons.

==Notes==
Upon accepting Peon Promotions!, [[A Little Goodwill]], and [[Worthwhile Repairs]]:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|We have to do what we can to appease the peons.}}

Head back inside the hideout and talk to the Crushblow Peons again. You now have the option to promote them to one of three ranks:
*{{Gossip|Job well done. You've been promoted to Peon, Rank 2.}}
::{{Text|say|Crushblow Peon|Dis mean me da boss?}}
*{{Gossip|Good work. You've been promoted to Senior Peon!}}
::{{Text|say|Crushblow Peon|Momma gonna be so proud!}}
*{{Gossip|Congratulations! You've been promoted to Lead Peon.}}
::{{Text|say|Crushblow Peon|Me important now!}}

Only three of the peons can be promoted, and each rank can only be given to one peon; once a rank has been given to a peon, that dialogue option will no longer be available when talking to subsequent peons. Promoting a peon also causes their name to change accordingly to "Crushblow Peon, Rank 2", "Senior Crushblow Peon", or "Lead Crushblow Peon".
