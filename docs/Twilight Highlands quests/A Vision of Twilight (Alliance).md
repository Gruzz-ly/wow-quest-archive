== Objectives ==
Locate an [[Eye of Twilight]] within the [[Black Breach]].

== Description ==
{{NPC||Cho'gall}} keeps track of his minions through these funny magical balls: "The Eyes of Twilight."

If I could get me hands on one of those, I bet we could use it to look in on Cho'gall and see what his creeps are up to. Get me one!

Search the Black Breach, east of here and just north of the river. Find me an Eye of Twilight, and do whatever you gotta do to bring it back here.

== Completion ==
<The Eye sits before you, humming ominously with dark energies.>

<Without warning, the orb rotates, as if to look at you. You sense a malevolent presence, as though the orb is alive.>

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Magmalord Falthazar]], [[Tempered in Elemental Flame]], [[Hot Stuff]] and [[Potential Energy]] before heading out. Potential Energy is the only other quest in the Black Breach, though.

The Eye can be found just north of the Verall due south of the breach proper.
