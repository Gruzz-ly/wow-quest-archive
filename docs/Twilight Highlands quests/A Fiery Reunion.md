==Objectives==
Obtain the Fire Portal Controller and use it at the Fire Portal.
*Use the Fire Portal Controller
*[[Fire Portal Controller]]

==Description==
That's [[Magmatooth]], my estranged [[fire elemental]]. <name>, you gotta kill him or he's gonna kill me!

It was all just a big misunderstanding. How was I to know he'd be mad about me [[Something that Burns|"borrowing" his heart]] down in [[Deepholm]]? He can't die... not permanently anyway!

He's got the controller to the portal on him for sure. You gotta get the controller and then use it in the Fire portal to take us back to the entrance.

("Magmatooth: Former fire elemental of Initiate Goldmine. There's bad blood between them.")

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Magma-Proof Sandals|Widener's Bracers|Lava-Melted Legplates}}
You will receive: {{cost|18|80}} (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)

==Progress==
<Name>!

==Completion==
We survived and all of the portals are now shutdown!

You don't think Magmatooth is going to hold a grudge, do you?

==Notes==
Magmatooth is a level 85 fire elemental with 154k health.

:{{text|yell|Magmatooth|GOLDMINE! YOU THINK I'VE FORGOTTEN?! I TOLD YOU THAT I'D GET MY REVENGE!!!}}
Aggro:
:{{text|yell|Magmatooth|YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO BURN!}}
:{{text|yell|Initiate Goldmine|Oh yeah? Um... get him!}}
:{{text|yell|Initiate Goldmine|Take this, you ungrateful elemental. After all I've done for you!}}
:''Goldmine shoots him with his All-in-1der-Belt rocket.
:{{text|yell|Magmatooth|AHAHAHAHAHAHA, FIRE? REALLY?}}
:{{text|yell|Magmatooth|YOU'RE NEXT JUST AS SOON AS I FINISH OFF YOUR FRIEND HERE!}}
On death:
:{{text|yell|Magmatooth|I'LL GET YOU, GOLDMINE!}}
The instant Magmatooth dies, loot him, and use the item to get out. His corpse despawns very quickly.
