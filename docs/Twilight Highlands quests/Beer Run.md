==Objectives==
Speak with [[Hammelhand]] on the road southeast of [[Thunderstrike Mountain]] and escort a supply caravan to [[Kirthaven]].
*Supply Caravan Escorted

==Description==
After [[Wild, Wild, Wildhammer Wedding|my sister's wedding]], I developed a taste for that [[Thunderbrew Lager]] that [[Kurdran Wildhammer|Kurdran]] had imported from [[Dun Morogh]]. More is on the way, but our caravan keeps getting jumped by the Dragonmaw!

Head on up to the southeast side of Thunderstrike Mountain and catch up with the caravan. Look for a fellow named Hammelhand at the side of the road, and help him get the booze through the pass.

Just get it as far as Kirthaven, and we'll take it from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|90000}} (or {{coppercost|131550}} at max level)

==Progress==
Is the road clear? Or were the Dragonmaw causing trouble again?

==Completion==
Go figure. Never thought I'd develop a taste for imported draft. Thanks, <name>!
