== Objectives ==
Obtain the Elementium Axe.
*[[The Elementium Axe]]

== Description ==
The Twilight cowards have captured and killed many red dragons, but one's still breathing. Do you remember [[Lirastrasza]]? She's chained nearby and we're going to free her.

But first, we need something sharp enough to cut her free.

There's an old [[ettin]] named [[Blindeye the Guardian]]. He stands watch at the [[Altar of Ascension]] to the south.

He has a purely-wrought [[Elementium]] axe. I wonder if that's [[Cho'gall]]'s "ultimate" weapon?

("Blindeye the Guardian: He has the Elementium Axe!")

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Do you have the axe?

== Completion ==
That's a very sharp axe. It'll do the job, but if I'm any judge of weaponry, that's not what Cho'gall's after.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Distract Them for Me (Horde)|Distract Them for Me]] before heading out. First, head just to the southeast. In the center of a pit is Master Klem, a level 85 elite human warrior with 387k health. Aggro him, knock off 20% of his health and keep him still as Shaw will spawn 20 yards behind him and stealth up to him.
:{{text|yell|Master Klem|You've come for training. Good!}}
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|You're telegraphing your moves.}}
Garona, once she gets in range, will stunlock and finish Klem off. Head to the southeast next. Just south of [[Cannon's Inferno]] is a big twilight building with Mia the Rose inside. She is a level 85 elite night elf rogue with 387k health. Same as before, knock off at least 20% of her health before Garona will spawn. Pop trinkets and fight defensively, she hits hard.
:{{text|yell|Mia the Rose|I knew you were coming. No one can resist me, not even you!}}
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|That was great fun.}}
Blindeye is just to the west, at the [[Altar of Ascension]], so take a slight detour and kill him. He is a level 85 ettin with 154k health. Garona will not help out on this kill, however.

Finally, keep heading southwest. In the shadow of the Twilight Altar is a small building just to the west of it. Inside is Dame Alys Finnsson, a level 85 elite worgen druid with 387k health. She fights in cat form.
:{{text|yell|Dame Alys Finnsson|We could have been civil about this, but no!}}
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|Not bad, I guess.}}
