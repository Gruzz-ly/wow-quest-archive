== Objectives ==
Talk to {{NPC||Fanny Thundermar}} at [[Thundermar]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
Before you go, be sure to stop by the inn behind me. My sister Fanny is inside.

Refugees are pouring into Thundermar from all of the torched [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]] settlements around us, and I put Fanny in charge of 'em. She's tough as talons, that one. But she might need your help.

== Completion ==
Me brother sent you? Good! I could use a <class>. Can ya hold yer own in a fight?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dragonmaw Takedown]] and [[Fight Like a Wildhammer]]. Fanny immediately turns around and offers [[Never Leave a Dinner Behind]], so pick it up before heading out.

Any hostiles have a chance of carrying the insignia.
