==Objectives==
Find the source of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] in the [[Vermillion Redoubt]] and destroy it.
*Twilight Portal destroyed
*[[Flashgrowth Mote]] (provided)

==Description==
Every inch of air and every hill surrounding the redoubt is constantly under the watchful eye of Lira's drakes. They must have found a way into the shrine from beneath.

Take this Flashgrowth mote. It should prove more than sufficient to close any hole, tunnel, or portal they might have used to get inside our defenses.

Find the breach in our defenses. Close it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dragonmender Waistguard|Helm of Verdant Explosion}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did you find the breach?

==Completion==
Well done. Thank you, <race>.

I will not be so foolish as to let such an oversight happen again.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Encroaching Twilight]] and [[Far from the Nest]] before heading out.

Head to the northwest. In the northwest corner of the redoubt is a twilight spire encircling a tree near the back of the valley. Just south of it, at {{co|18.0|16.9|Twilight Highlands}} is a mouth of a cave with a [[Twilight Portal]] inside it. Plant the seed to destroy it. Kill Twilight Abductors and loot the eggs they drop on the ground.

==Progression==
{{Vermillion Redoubt}}
