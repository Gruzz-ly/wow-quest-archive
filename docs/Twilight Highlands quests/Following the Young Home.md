==Objectives==
Use the Mother's Flame on [[Obsidian Egg]]s to release whelps. Follow those hatchlings to the lair of their mother.
*[[Obsidian Whelp (Twilight Highlands)|Obsidian Whelps]] hatched
*[[Obsidian Lair]] infiltrated
*[[Mother's Flame]] (provided)

==Description==
In the southwestern portion of the [[Obsidian Forest]], you will find some of the black egg clutches. Many of the eggs can be hatched at any time with a bit of prodding from the right flame, and as the whelplings hatch, they will cry out and flock for their mother.

Do not worry, if this purging is to be taken to the whelps, that is not a task that I will force on you. I simply want you to let them out and follow them home as they seek their mother. It is she who we must confront.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

==Completion==
Lirastraza sent me ahead to the lair, suspecting the black dragon we are seeking may still be here. Judging by the hatchlings, it seems she was not mistaken.

==Notes==
Fly due south from Lira's position. Egg clutches are found at the incinerated bases of trees, guarded by a dragonspawn. Kill the guard and use the item.
:{{text|bossemote|Follow the hatchlings into the Obsidian Lair.}}
Do so. The lair is the cave to the southwest marked on the map. Follow the whelps in and cross the bridge over the water and Baleflame will run in toward the back of the cave.
:{{text|say|Baleflame|Lira sent me to watch your backs. If [[Obsidia]] is in here, I'll keep her busy while you finish her off.}}
Keep running to the back of the cave to find Baleflame. Quickly interact with Baleflame, if he's not busy fighting Obsidia, to complete this quest and pick up [[Last of Her Kind]].
