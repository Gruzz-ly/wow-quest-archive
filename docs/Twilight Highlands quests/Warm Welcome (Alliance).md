== Objectives ==
Meet with [[Lirastrasza]] at [[Vermillion Redoubt]].
* Meet with Lirastrasza

== Description ==
I'm glad you're back! Saving the world or something, I'm sure.

I was dispatched to establish relations with the [[red dragonflight|red dragons]] in the area, but I'm finding this bunch somewhat less accommodating than the ones at [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]] were. I have, however, been told that you are the type that solves problems.

A problem solver as it were.

Care to take a crack at earning a bit of trust with Lirastrasza at Vermillion Redoubt to the southwest? Anything that might soften her up a bit for me would be lovely.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|10}} (or {{cost|12|40|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
I'm glad Lira didn't scare you off. I won't say her concerns aren't warranted, but we have a common enemy. She is perhaps a bit overzealous.

== Notes ==
Head to the southwest, past the ruins and the ogre camp. Aim for the red tree peaking over the mountain. Fly in and a Vermillion Sentinel will stun the player and take it over to Lirastrasza. She will fly in and shift to her elven form before telling off the player and flying away.
:{{text|say|Lirastrasza|You've crossed into the domain of red dragons, <race>.}}
:{{text|say|Lirastrasza|You and your allies have struck against my kind at the [[Dragonmaw Gates|gates]] to [[Grim Batol]] in the past. You've shown no respect for the sacred oath we would die to keep. You'll find no trust with me.}}
:{{text|say|Lirastrasza|Fortunately for you, your fate is not mine to decide.}}
:{{text|say|Lirastrasza|My drakes shall be watching you. Choose your words and your actions carefully, <race>.}}
Head to the south side of the large tree in the center of the redoubt to talk to Calen.

His gossip text:
:Deathwing has returned. He's seized Grim Batol and much of the highlands, and I feel near powerless to stop him.
:Soon, our queen shall arrive, and together we shall put the once Earthwarder in his place.
