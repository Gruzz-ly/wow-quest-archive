== Objectives ==
Gather up 8 Twilight Garment Scraps.
* [[Twilight Garment Scrap]] (8)

== Description ==
So far as I can tell, the [[Glopgut]] [[Ogre]]s right outside the cave here have not yet joined up with the [[Twilight's Hammer]]. If we're clever, we can turn the two groups against each other.

Let's roll with a little trick I learned in [[Silithus]]. First we'll need to put together a set of cultist robes for you.

Head south of here and kill some [[Twilight Windwarper]]s in the [[Twilight Breach]]. Aside from disrupting whatever they're up to, it'll give you a chance to collect garment scraps.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}

== Progress ==
This is good, <name>. With heroes like you stirring up trouble out here, we'll keep the cult distracted from our main invasion.

Do you have a disguise?

== Completion ==
What did you manage to get? I suppose we can piece something together from this.

After all, you're not joining the cult. We just need to fool a few ogres.

==Progression==
{{The Northern Flank}}
