# Twilight Highlands quests

[[File:WorldMap-TwilightHighlands.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

'''[[Twilight Highlands]]''' is the fifth and final level-up zone of ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm]]'', found on the east coast of [[Khaz Modan]] on the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. The quest chain starts in either [[Stormwind]] or [[Orgrimmar]] and involves a short chain in the capital city before heading out to the highlands proper.
