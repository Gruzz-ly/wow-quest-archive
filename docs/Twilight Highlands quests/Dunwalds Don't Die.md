==Objectives==
Look for Dunwald family survivors in the [[Dunwald Ruins]].

==Description==
As I understand it, you're to be looking to bring the Wildhammer clans together with the Alliance for war. Not sure you know what you're gettin' into.

Anyway, if it's battle you're preparin' for, there's definitely one family you want by your side. Head north, to the opposite side of the [[Crucible of Carnage]], and there you'll find Clan Dunwald's ruins. They're rightly ravaged, but that's not likely to be stoppin' the Dunwalds. It's just a matter of findin' them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

==Completion==
If it's Dunwalds you be lookin for, it's Dunwalds you've found. A couple of'm anyway. I can't find me other brothers for the life of me.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Coward's Due]] before heading out. They're in opposite directions, though. Head west to what's left of Dunwald. It has been picked over by [[Twilight Pillager]]s, [[Bloodgorged Ettin]] are on patrol on the ground with [[Highland Black Drake]]s providing aerial support. No friendlies appear to be present in the Ruins of Dunwald, so head west to the [[Dunwald Holdout]]. [[Keely Dunwald|Keely]] and [[Flynn Dunwald|Flynn]] are holed up in the bottom of the westernmost building.

Five quests open up on completion.
