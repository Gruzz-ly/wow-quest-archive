I'll tell you what, buddy, this place is a far cry from the rolling plains of Nagrand or the bloodbowl in Zul'Drak, but hey, I go where the gold's at. So welcome to Twi-Hi, pal.

If you're ready and you've got a group of friends with you, we can start! What do you say?

You will receive: {{cost|28|20}} (at max level)

==Progress==
No payout until the fight's over, man.
