With [[Deathwing]] otherwise occupied, we have a grim and daunting task ahead of us, under charge of [[Alexstrasza|the queen herself]]. The black dragonflight is to be wiped out.

I would welcome your aid in this, if it is offered. As soon as you are ready, I will send you with the next flight joining the attack.

== Completion ==
It seems you are still with us. I'm somewhat appreciative of that.

Thank you.
