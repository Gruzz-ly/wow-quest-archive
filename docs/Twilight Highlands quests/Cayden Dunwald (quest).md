== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Cayden Dunwald}}.

== Description ==
Cayden's the other twin. He's got a thirst too, but not for ale. I'm sure he's been havin' a grand time of it since the Twilight came to our doorstep. Gettin' some of that agreesion out of his system mayhaps.

I'm thinkin' the best place to go lookin for him is at market row, by the old [[Blacksmith|smithy]]. He used ta hang out there anyway, but since that place is swarmin' with the most Twilight, he's probably got all the more reason to be callin' it home now.

Bring'm back for me. In one piece would be nice.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
Wel look at ya, all geared and facny. {{NPC||Keely Dunwald||Keely}} send you to keep an eye on old Cayden, eh? Won't be needin' it. I got these louts handled.

Haha! They chose the wrong dwarf to be ambushin' today! Ahahahahah!

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Donnelly Dunwald]], [[Eoin Dunwald]], [[While Meeting The Family]] and [[Sifting Through The Wreckage]] before heading out.

Cayden can be found due south at the [[Dunwald Market Row]] at either its eastern or western end.
