== Objectives ==
Detonate the Hidden Explosives to lure [[Skullcrusher the Mountain]] away from the [[Twilight Gate]].
* Hidden explosives detonated

== Description ==
If the Twilight Gate is to fall, we must get Skullcrusher the Mountain out of there!

Before they left, I saw to it that your [[Kor'kron]] assassins took some explosives hidden in a [[Twilight's Hammer]] crate. By now, they will have planted them on the steps leading up to the upper portion of the Citadel.

I want you to set the explosives off and then signal us when that monster's out of the way.

That's when we'll attack and finish off the ogre compound!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Success!

== Notes ==
More of a ramp than steps, but at {{co|38.1|66.2|Twilight Highlands}} halfway up the hill is a crate of Hidden Explosives. Interact with the crate then get away!
