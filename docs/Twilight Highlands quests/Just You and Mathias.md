Find [[Master Mathias Shaw]] at the [[Twilight Citadel]] in the [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
The SI:7 are all dead. Time to find Master Mathias Shaw.

Good thing the squad commander told you where he would be.

== Completion ==
Where are the rest of my people?

== Notes ==
Keep heading up the ramp, then circle around to the left and south to find Shaw, stealthed at the base of a guard tower.

His gossip text:
:There's an artifact, a weapon, being forged with the power of an Old God. We don't know exactly what it is, but we need to get to it before it's completed by Cho'gall.
:Everything else is secondary. Everyone is expendable, including you and I.
