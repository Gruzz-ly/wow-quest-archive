== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Twilight Spearwardens.

== Description ==
The ambush launched smoothly. Most of the guards are dead, but a few are still pinned down with the wagons.

Get in there and clear them out so we can push forward into the canyons.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
There are still some guards left down there. Clean them out.

== Completion ==
Excellent. Now we can start pushing our ground forces up towards Grim Batol.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Precious Goods (Alliance)|Precious Goods]] before heading out. Kill spearwarders until the key drops, then loot a chest, then go back to killing spearwarders to hit the quota.
