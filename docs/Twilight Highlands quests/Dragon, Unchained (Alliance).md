==Objectives==
Use the Elementium Axe to break the chains enslaving Lirastrasza.
* [[Lirastrasza]] freed
* [[The Elementium Axe (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
Lirastrasza is the last and greatest of the red dragons that the [[Twilight's Hammer]] captured. They're about to kill her.

I need you to take the Elementium Axe and free her from her bonds.

("Lirastrasza: Use the Elementium Axe to unchain her!")

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

==Progress==
Use the axe to break Lirastrasza's chains.

==Completion==
Isn't she a beauty?

Let's see what she does now that she's free.

==Notes==
Head southwest. Lira is chained up at {{co|32.3|68.7|Twilight Highlands}} in the middle of the red dragon area. On getting close to her:
:{{text|say|Lirastrasza|<Name>, is that you? Please free me from these chains.}}
Swing the axe:
:{{text|say|Lirastrasza|I am eternally grateful to you, <name>.}}
:''Lirastrasza gets up and hovers.''
:{{text|say|Lirastrasza|I'll take care of the drakes. You worry about the rest of the Twilight rubbish.}}
:''She flies off and disappears.''

==Progression==
{{Twilight Gate}}
