== Objectives ==
Lead squad from [[Highbank]] to the closed Dragonmaw Gate.

If you lose your squad, return to [[Master Mathias Shaw]] for reassignment.
* Dragonmaw Gate opened

== Description ==
The wyrms have already taken the battle to the sky above [[Grim Batol]]. It's up to us to move our men in by ground and secure the gates.

I want you to know what is at stake here, <class>. Grim Batol is the source of [[Twilight's Hammer]] reinforcements to all of the highlands. If we do not cut them off here, we will not win the battles ahead.

I'm sending a squad from [[Highbank]] with you. Get to the gate to the southeast and get it open. Your lieutenant should have any further instructions you'll need from there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Like a well-oiled machine.

== Notes ==
On accept, a party of five from Highbank join the player: a lieutenant, who immediately offers [[Paving the Way (Alliance)|Paving the Way]], a marine, a demolitionist, a sniper and a medic. Talk to the lieutenant:
:Sir.

*{{text|say|Highbank Sniper|Sir, I think the explosions and gunfire gave us away. You don't have to use hand signals.}}
*{{text|say|Highbank Marine|What the heck was that?}}
Hop on a ground mount and start running. Remember to do some damage to the twilights in order to get credit for killing them. If there aren't enough twilights nearby, get to the gate at {{co|29.6|51.6|Twilight Highlands}} where a script event will play out and spawn in at least a dozen twilights:
:{{text|say|Highbank Lieutenant|Break out the gatestone. Open this thing up.}}
:{{text|say|Highbank Medic|Right away sir. Er... I don't see a slot to put it in?}}
:{{text|say|Highbank Lieutenant|It's never easy, is it? That's alright, we came prepared.}}
:{{text|say|Highbnak Lieutenant|Blow it open. There isn't a problem that some explosives can't solve.}}
:{{text|say|Highbank Demolitionist|On it.}}
:''A few squads of twilights rush the gate. Fend them off.''
:{{text|say|Highbank Demolitionist|Almost done.}}
On success, Shaw runs up and stops just on the other side of the gate:
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Good work. I'll keep the men pushing from here. Move forward and take the last gate.}}
Finish this quest and pick up [[Pressing Forward (Alliance)|Pressing Forward]] before leaving Mathias' new position.
