== Objectives ==
Kill [[Wildhammer Warbrand]]s to collect 8 Wildhammer Insignias. Named characters within the [[Thundermar Ruins]] will also carry insignias.
* [[Wildhammer Insignia]] (8)

== Description ==
Since my people first claimed the [[Twilight Highlands|Highlands]], the [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]] dwarves have been our persistent foe. We fought them in [[Grim Batol]], we fought them in the [[Wetlands]], and even now open warfare rages to our north, across the river, amidst the Thundermar Ruins.

Prove your valor to me. Seek out and crush Wildhammer Warbrands. The best among them carry insignias - my warriors collect them by the dozen.

Can you?

<Narkrall clenches the insignias in his weathered hand.>

So, <class>. There's more to you than meets the eye.
