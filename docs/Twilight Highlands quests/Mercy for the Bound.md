== Objectives ==
Gather 5 Fleshburner Hearts.
*[[Fleshburner Heart]] x5

== Description ==
It goes without saying that I had no desire to stay here, but there were materials we needed for the ritual... I delayed to secure them, and that is what lead to my capture.

I will return to the circle, but I would be indebted to you if you would finish what I could not. We need hearts from the [[bound fire elemental]]s that the [[Twilight's Hammer]] enslave in the western portion of [[Ruins of Drakgor|the encampment]].

The elementals are without hope, but in this sacrifice they can extract their revenge.

Find me at camp.
