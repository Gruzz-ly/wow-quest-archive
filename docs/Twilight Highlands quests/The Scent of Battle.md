==Objectives==
Find 8 Mullan Gryphons and dispatch them back to their gryphon riders.
*[[Mullan Gryphon]]s found and returned x8
*[[Charred Highland Birch]] (provided)

==Description==
Don't let [[Duglas Mullan|Duglas]] fool you, the Mullans have been itchin' to take wing again, and if there's anyone we'd do it for, it's Firebeard.

We left our gryphons in the [[Highland Forest]] to the south to hunt and get away from the sounds of battle for a bit. They deserved a rest.

If you want us back in the air soon, you'd do well to help us bring our gryphons back in.

Take this piece of charred highland birch. We use it during training - as soon as they smell it, they'll come straight back to us.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

==Progress==
We're not going to be of much use to you without our birds.

==Completion==
Good on you. I alwas feel like a part of me is missing when my gryphon isn't neary. I can't speak for Duglas or the rest of the clan, but I'll be ready to ride at Firebeard's call.

==Notes==
Do [[The Fighting Spirit]] before taking off. Head east into the highlands. Often, the gryphons are in one spot, relaxing. Simply interact with them to show them the branch. However, [[Twilight Trapper (Twilight Highlands)|Twilight Trappers]] have caught a few. Kill the trapper and destroy the bindings holding the gryphon down to release it. Others are injured, looking for first aid or healing. Toss a heal or use a bandage on it and it will fly back too.

==Bugs==
There appears to be at least one trapped gryphon that has no bindings to destroy. It is unknown if this is intentional or a bug.

==Progression==
