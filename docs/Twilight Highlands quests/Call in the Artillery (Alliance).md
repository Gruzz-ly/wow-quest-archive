==Objectives==
Use the Artillery Flare to target the Northern, Northeastern, Southwestern, and Southern buildings at the [[Twilight Gate]].
*Northern building targeted
*Northeastern building targeted
*Southwestern building targeted
*Southern building targeted
*[[Artillery Flare]] (provided)

==Description==
I prefer a stand up honorable fight. These monsters deserve nothing better than to be destroyed by the weapons in our hands. However, this particular situation calls for the use of more powerful measures.

Take this flare and mark each of the four buildings within the Twilight Gate to the southwest. Our cannons will handle the rest.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Flarefire Bracers|Marker's Hauberk|Signal Smoke Shoulderpads}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

==Progress==
I need you to go back to the Twilight Gate and mark those buildings for bombardment.

==Completion==
Thanks to you, our [[cannoneer]]s hit their marks. Tell me about the situation within the Twilight Gate.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ogres & Ettins (Alliance)|Ogres & Ettins]] and [[SI:7 Drop]] before heading out.

Hop on a flying mount, talk to Angus, and head in. Quickly drop off the SI:7 agents by reaching the drop point, marked by a blue X on the ground, at {{co|39.2|64.5|Twilight Highlands}} on the northern part of the gate. Then start killing and marking. The flares can be used outside of the buildings, which is a nice change.
