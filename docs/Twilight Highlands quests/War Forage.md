== Description ==
<Griff's stomach growls.>

Whenever we Dragonmaw go on the warpath, everyone stops hunting.

The best tasting food is stolen from the mouths of the enemy. Up on the ridge north of the river there's a bunch of wrecked Wildhammer houses. I bet they're loaded with food.

Bring some to my mouth.

You will receive: {{cost|9}}

Hungry.

<Griff greedily snatches the heap of food, enough to feed dozens of men.>

Great! Did you get any for yourself?
