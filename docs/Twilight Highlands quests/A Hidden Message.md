This rogue-only quest is the second part of the chain to obtain the legendary dagger set [[Fangs of the Father]]. It is a courier quest, sending the rogue to aid the [[red dragonflight]] in the [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Objectives ==
Charge your Cryptomancer's Decoder Ring and use it to decode the [[Corastrasza]]'s Singed Cipher.
* Decoder Ring [[Charged Decoder Ring|Charged]]
* Acquire the [[Singed Cipher]]
* [[Solved Cipher]]
* [[Cryptomancer's Decoder Ring (2)]] (provided)

== Description ==
Corastrasza, currently stationed at the [[Vermillion Redoubt]] in the [[Twilight Highlands]], has intercepted a coded message of grave importance. I'll let her explain the full situation, but we need your expertise to unravel the cipher!

Take your decoder ring to an [[ethereal]] thaumaturge in your capital city - he should know how to charge it. Acquire the encoded cipher from Corastrasza and use the ring to decode it for her. Hurry! Time is ticking...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54}}

== Progress ==
I was hoping Lord Devrestrasz would find us a competent rogue.

What have you got for us, <name>? Do you have a means of decrypting the message? 

== Completion ==
What's this about? "[[Ravenholdt Manor]]?" I thought that was just a motley band of thieves up in the [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].

What would they want with a dragon egg? More importantly, how did they find out about it?

We're going to need some answers, <name>!

==Notes==
Take the [[Cryptomancer's Decoder Ring (2)]] to a capital city to pay the ethereal 10,000 gold for the [[Charging Decoder Ring]] and wait 12 hours to charge it up in to the [[Charged Decoder Ring]]. Then head to the [[Twilight Highlands]] and fly to the [[Vermillion Redoubt]]. There, [[Corastrasza]] has relocated from her previous location at [[Coldarra]] in [[Borean Tundra]]. Interact with her, acquire the [[Singed Cipher]] and use the Charged Decoder Ring on it to create the [[Solved Cipher]], then hand that cipher back in to Corastrasza.

===At the thaumaturge===
:Our [[ethereal]] [[technomancy]] has the ability to modify an item's arcane essence in ways previously unimaginable. We can also house items in a pocket dimension... for a small fee. See my associates for details.
:Unless you have something for me to examine?
{{gossip|Can you charge my [[:Cryptomancer's Decoder Ring]]?}}
:I see... involved in some shady business, <race>? Oh no need to worry - the confidentiality of all transactions is assured.
:This ring you have is a superb piece of work. We can begin the charging process... for a modest fee. Charging the ring will take roughly one half of your world's cycles to complete. In other world, twelve hours.
:Shall we say 10,000 gold? That's fair.
*{{gossip|<Pay the 10,000 gold.>}}
::{{text|say|Very good, <race>! Remember, your ring will not reach its full charge for many hours.}}
*{{gossip|Ten thousand? Outrageous! I'll kill you while you sleep!}}
::Well then.
::It is good that I no longer sleep.

===At Corastrasza===
Inspecting the {{NPC||Suspicious Infiltrator}}:
:&lt;The body has been very badly burned and nearly bitten in half.&gt;
:&lt;The red dragonflight may be the guardians of all life on Azeroth, but clearly they are not to be crossed.&gt;
Talking to [[Corastrasza]]:
:Lost. Stolen! This is a terrible blow. Terrible!
*{{gossip|What happened here? What was stolen?}}
::Are you familiar with the late dragon [[Rheastrasza]]? A little off, that one. She often lurked about the [[Badlands]] in the form of a [[mortal]] [[goblin]].
::Rheastrasza came up with a scheme to steal and purify a [[black dragon]] egg, severing its tie with the [[black dragonflight]] and the corrupted [[Earth Warder]], [[Deathwing]].
::If you helped Rheastrasza:
::*{{gossip|Of course! I helped her back when I was in the Badlands.}}
:::&lt;Corastrasza does a double-take.&gt;
:::You!? YOU helped Rheastrasza? And lived to tell about it?
:::I underestimate you, &lt;race&gt;. No wonder [[Lord Devrestrasz]] sent you to me.
:::No doubt you remember what happened next: Rheastrasza was killed by Deathwing, but thanks to her sacrifice a single purified black dragon egg was secreted away and hidden.
::If you didn't help Rheastrasza:
::*{{gossip|Did it work?}}
:::Believe it or not, her plan DID work. She acquired an egg - I'm still not certain by what means - and claimed to have severed its link to the tainted flight.
:::Then Deathwing found out about it.
:::He cornered Rheastrasza in a cave in the Badlands, destroying her and all of her work. Or so he thought. Rheastrasza had sacrificed her own eggs to fool the Aspect of Death.
:::The single, purified black dragon egg was secreted away and hidden!
:*{{gossip|What happened to the egg?}}
::That's why you're here, &lt;name&gt;. The egg was hidden here at the [[Vermillion Redoubt|Vermilion Redoubt]]{{sic|remove is spelled correctly.}}. Days ago, it disappeared.
::Whoever did it was able to elude our sharpest guards. One of the thieves was killed during the abduction, although now I believe he may have been a diversion - the egg is simply GONE.
::On his corpse we found this note. It remains our only clue, but it is written in a dense code and it MUST be deciphered.
*{{Gossip|I'm your <woman/man>! Give me the coded message.}}
::'''Acquire the Singed Cipher: 1/1'''
::{{text|say|Corastrasza|Here's what's left of the message we found, <name>. Can you make any sense of it?}}

Corastrasza's gossip after decoding the message
:That coded message is the only clue we have.
