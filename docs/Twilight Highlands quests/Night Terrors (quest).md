==Map==
[[File:the-gullet-map.svg|frame|right|diagram of The Gullet]]

The cave is dark to begin with, and when you are shifted to the spirit world it becomes unreasonably dark, so dark that almost nothing is visible on some monitors and projectors.  Have a diagram to help you navigate via the mini-map.
