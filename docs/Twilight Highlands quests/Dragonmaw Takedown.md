== Objectives ==
Kill {{NPC||Dragonmaw Marauder}}s and collect 8 Dragonmaw Insignias. Named characters within the [[Thundermar Ruins]] will also carry insignias.
*[[Dragonmaw Insignia]] x8

== Description ==
The [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]]!

<{{NPC||Colin Thundermar||Colin}} spits.>

Monsters, all of them. We've fought them up and down [[Twilight Highlands|these highlands]] since the [[Third War|last war]]. And now they're joining forces with the [[Horde]]?

If you're going to convince us [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammers]] to unite under the [[Alliance]] banner, you'd best prove yourself against the Dragonmaw. Wade into the battle that's raging in the Thundermar ruins to the south and southwest. Kill Dragonmaw marauders and collect the insignias that their greatest warriors wear. Then we'll talk.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Trophy-Taker Bracers|Belt of Bloody Dreams|Orc-Shock Spaulders}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
How goes the fight, <class>?

== Completion ==
Look at that! That's quite a collection of trophies you have there.

I'll spread the word. If a single Alliance <class> can do this, imagine what the rest of your lot can accomplish!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[My Sister, Fanny]] and [[Fight Like a Wildhammer]]. Fanny immediately turns around and offers [[Never Leave a Dinner Behind]], so pick it up before heading out.
