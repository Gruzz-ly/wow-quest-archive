==Objectives==
Use the Attack Signal from atop one of the towers at the [[Twilight Gate]].

==Description==
Now that you've lured [[Skullcrusher the Mountain]] away from the Twilight Gate, it's time to signal your forces at [[Victor's Point]] to attack!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

==Completion==
The horns have been sounded. Victor's Point should launch their attack at any moment.

Now there's only one thing left to take care of.

==Notes==
