== Objectives ==
Talk to {{NPC||Russell Brower (NPC)||Russell Brower}} and help him write a song.
* Create a Song

== Description ==
I've written many an epic tune in my lifetime, <name>, but this upcoming wedding deserves a very special ballad. And fast!

Should I write a love song? A lighthearted ditty? A bawdy drinking song?

I could use some help with the lyrics, if you fancy a go at it.

Talk to me and we'll write a song together!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|80}} (or {{cost|9|86|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
"Words and Music by Russell Brower the Bard and <name> the <Class>."

That's got a nice ring to it.

== Completion ==
Well, it's catchy, that's for sure.

But is it a classic?

== Notes ==
His gossip text:
:Hallo, friend!
:Russell's the name, and music is my business. All the great Wildhammer heroes from ages past are kept alive with song. Through the strings of my lute and the sound of my voice, our warriors gain immortality.
