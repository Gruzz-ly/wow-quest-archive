==Objectives==
Wait for [[Fargo Flintlocke]] to get you onto the zeppelin and then set his explosives in its lower chamber.
*Wait to be launched from [[Flintlocke's Cannon]]
*Destroy the [[The Skyshredder|Skyshredder]]
*[[Flintlocke's Explosives]] (provided)

==Description==
Lookie here, <name>. I found the biggest gun in [[Highbank]]! We're gonna try a technique handed down ta me by my pappy, from his pappy, from his pappy, shortly before he got blowed up.

It's called the "<class>-shot."

You take a <race> <class>, and load <him/her> inta a gigantic cannon, and then ya - oh relax. This usually works.

Take these explosives, then wait here next ta me. As soon as that blimpy comes around I'll blast you onto tha deck. Plant the explosives in 'er bely and, oh I dunno, make it up as you go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18}} 
*[[Flintlocke's Chuckshooter]]

==Progress==
Ain't no problem a bomb can't solve.

==Completion==
<Flintlocke wipes tears from his eyes.>

Oh, <name>, <name>!

That ... were beautiful.

==Notes==
:''Flintlocke throws the player into the cannon, shortly before he lights it!''
As the zeppelin approaches...
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|Now hold yer breeks. The zeppelin will take a minute or so to pull around.}}
:{{text|say|[["Doc" Schweitzer]]|Flintlocke, if we have a big giant cannon, why don't we just shoot ... a cannonball?}}
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|Bah, predictable! They'll see it comin'!}}
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|But once ol' <name> here blasts through their bulkhead in a hail of splintered wood, blood, and phlegm then starts crawlin' across the deck with both legs broken, oh aye, they'll not see THAT comin' by a sweet mile, no sir!}}
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|It's almost here. Get ready!}}
:{{text|say|Fargo Flintlocke|She's here! Get in that cannon, damnit! Get ready to fire!}}
On deck, there's one [[Skyshredder Crewmember]] and another below deck. Get below deck and plant the bomb. Then run to the balcony and jump off!
:{{text|bossemote|The bombs are set! Run to the balcony and jump to escape!}}
:{{text|bossemote|3...}}
:{{text|bossemote|2...}}
:{{text|bossemote|1...}}
:{{text|bossemote|BOOM!}}

As the player jumps from the balcony, they're thrown clear of the zeppelin by the blast and hopefully into the open water below. Get back to Flintlocke. The town's no longer under siege! He's also had time to hide the cannon. That was quick.

Now that the town is secure, all of the vendors and other useful NPCs (like the innkeeper and flight master) have set up shop. Pick up the flight path!

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Highbank!}}

==Trivia==
The <class>-shot is a reference to chuck-shot, the secret technique used by Flintlocke in the [[Flintlocke's Guide to Azeroth]] webcomic.
