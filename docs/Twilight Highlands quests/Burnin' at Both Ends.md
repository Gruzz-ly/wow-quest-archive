== Objectives ==
Collect 10 bags full of Cannon Powder.
*[[Cannon Powder]] (10)

== Description ==
Har! We get to jump right inta the action, <name>. Looks like [[Highbank]] has whatcha call a [[zeppelin]] problem: that airship is poundin' the crap outta the walls.

Listen, I've got me an idear so stupid it's genius. I just need some cannon powder.

Collect as much as you can find around Highbank an' meet me by the trade area!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|15|50}} (at max level)

== Progress ==
I need more powder! Get me more powder! More more more!

== Completion ==
Aye, that'll do 'er.

<Flintlocke stuffs some of the powder in his mouth.>

Ohhh, fresh. Heady. [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]] fine grain with a hint of [[Westfall]] sulphur and a mild aftertaste. Highbank gets the good stuff.

==Notes==
[[Cannon Powder Barrel]]s can be found all over Highbank. As players collect their last bag, Fargo relocates to the southwestern end of Highbank, standing next to what looks like a [[Darkmoon Faire]] cannon.
