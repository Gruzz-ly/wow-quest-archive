== Objectives ==
Take the Patent Application to [[Captain Krazz]] at the [[Krazzworks]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].
* [[Patent Application]] (provided)

== Description ==
This new shredder design is tops, <name>. Tops! Next step is to protect my intellectual property. There are patents to file, traders to mark, ceases to desist. Oh, and the bribes!

Here, take this patent application to Captain Krazz at the Krazzworks. He survived the destruction of his zeppelin, so he's probably hungry for new business opportunities.

The Krazzworks is due north of here, atop a perfectly safe mountain peak. Go ahead, kid. Chop chop!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|50}}
*27600 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Progress ==
I know you! You were on the Zeppelin with me on the way in.

== Completion ==
What's this? The "<name>-o-matic:" a shredder with an integrated missile platform?

Bah! Already patented by [[Labor Captain Grabbit]] in [[Azshara]]. Worthless!

What I really need is a machine that knocks dwarves from the sky.

== Notes ==
The Krazzworks is found at {{co|77.62|16.63|Twilight Highlands}}.
