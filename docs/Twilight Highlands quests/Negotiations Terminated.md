==Objectives==
Return to [[Admiral Stonefist]] off the shore of [[Dragonmaw Port|Dragonmaw Hold]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

==Description==
Go now, go back to your fleet. Tell them what kind of a monster claims authority over the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]].

Our "[[Warchief Mor'ghor|Warchief]]" is a traitor to his blood. Since his return from Outland he reeks of demon and leads what remains of our clan to ruin.

Help rid the Dragonmaw of Mor'ghor, and those of us with pure blood will be your allies forever. This I can promise.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*12730 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The [[Fel orc|Fel Orcs]] from [[Outland]] have laid claim to the Dragonmaw? Obscene!

If [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]] knew what was happening here, he'd raze their city to the ground...

==Notes==
After completion:
:{{text|say|Admiral Stonefist|What do we do now? Surely the Warchief would want us to storm the port in force!}}
:{{text|say|[[Warlord Krogg]]|Perhaps. And perhaps we would win, but at what cost? Maybe <name> has a better plan...}}

==Progression==
{{Stalled Negotiations}}
