== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Warlord Krogg]] in [[Wyrms' Bend]].

== Description ==
Kroggs started the assault to push up the canyon. He's just past the gate to our southeast.

I'm going to get the squad together to join the attack. We'll meet you down there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||94}} (or {{cost|1|65|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
The canyon is well fortified, but the distraction that the dragons are providing should be enough to allow us to break through.

==Progression==
{{Vermillion Redoubt}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
