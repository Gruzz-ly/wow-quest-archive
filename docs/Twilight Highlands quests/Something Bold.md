== Objectives ==
Collect 12 Pristine Owl Feathers.
*[[Pristine Owl Feather]] x12

== Description ==
By tradition, Wildhammer brides wear white to show their purity. In addition, they wear a crown of black feathers - to show their ''{{wplink|Chutzpah|CHUTZPAH}}''.

Owl feathers make the boldest statement, and Fanny deserves nothing less. Tawny owls are native to the Highlands. Look for them circling near trees that grow along the cliffs, and take their feathers.

You'll probably want to kill 'em, first.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Have you Fanny's feathers?

== Completion ==
Ah, you work fast. Bold feathers for a bold woman. Well done!

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Something Brewed]], [[Something Stolen]] and [[Something Stewed]] before heading out.

Tawny Owls are south of Thunderstrike Mountain, and pretty much everywhere else on the high ridge. In the same area, Pristine Owl Feathers can be found on the ground as well.
