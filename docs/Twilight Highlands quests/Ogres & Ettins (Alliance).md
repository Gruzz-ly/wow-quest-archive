== Objectives ==
Slay 10 [[ogre]]s or [[ettin]]s at the [[Twilight Gate]].
* Bloodeye Clan ogres & ettins slain (10)

== Description ==
As with any offensive, you first need to soften them up. We've been having a heck of a time getting in there. But someone like you... well, let's just say I have no doubt in my mind that you can get into the Twilight Gate to the southwest and teach the Bloodeye Clan ogres and ettins a thing or two!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
What's the matter? You Alliance boys don't have the stomach to get the job done?

<Kurdran gives you a wink.>

Need me to fly over there and kill them for you?

== Completion ==
That's the spirit, lad! Today's already shaping up to be a good one.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Call in the Artillery (Alliance)|Call in the Artillery]] and [[SI:7 Drop]] before heading out.

Hop on a flying mount, talk to Angus, and head in. Quickly drop off the SI:7 agents by reaching the drop point, marked by a blue X on the ground, at {{co|39.2|64.5|Twilight Highlands}} on the northern part of the gate. Then start killing and marking.
