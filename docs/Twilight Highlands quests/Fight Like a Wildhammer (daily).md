==Objectives==
Collect 10 Kegs of Thundermar Ale from the [[Thundermar Ruins]]. Careful - it's got some kick!
*[[Keg of Thundermar Ale]] x10

==Description==
<Blundy upends his cup.>

I'm all outta ale, <name>!

Head out into the Thundermar Ruins and see if there's any left, before those grungy Dragonmaw get their mouths on it.

Feel free to have a few sips, yerself. A mug of ol' Thundermar's finest will fortify yer fightin' skills. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|90000}} (or {{coppercost|131550}} at max level)

==Progress==
Got sumthun'? 

==Completion==
Oh aye, quite a haul!

This'll last me until... oh say probably tomorrow.

==Progression==
{{Wild, Wild, Wildhammer Wedding}}

==Popular reference==
The effect of the ale and the old celtic theme (as well as the hanging meat from the quest Never Leave a Dinner Behind) together may be a reference to the French comic series Asterix where the Gaul warriors gain strength from drinking a magic potion to fight the Romans
