== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Duglas Mullan}} at the [[Crucible of Carnage]].

== Description ==
If we're going to pull a full [[Gryphon rider|gryphon wing]] back together, we're going to need to move fast to gather the survivors before they leave or get picked off. I've got a bead on a few groups of riders that stuck together. I'm leavin' to find the Thundermar riders and the Moore riders shortly.

The Mullans were heading up west to the Crucible of Carnage last I saw. Go see if you can convince Duglas Mullan to join up with Keegan - he should owe him a favor or three.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|57|50}} (at max level)

== Completion ==
Iain sent ya?

You don't look like a Firebeard to me. Why exactly should I be listenin' to anything you say?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Stubborn as a Doyle]] and [[Firebeard Bellows]] before heading out. Mullan is to the southwest at [[the Boneyard]], just south of {{NPC||Gurgthock}}'s postion overlooking the Crucible of Carnage.

==Progression==
{{Firebeard's Patrol}}

== Patch changes ==
