== Objectives ==
Gather up 10 Twisted Elementium Coils.
*[[Twisted Elementium Loop]] x10

== Description ==
As you well know, the amount of energy stored in a conventional spring is equal to one half the spring's elasticity times the displacement squared. Unless you're using an [[elementium]] spring. Then the numbers get obscene! Mathematically grotesque!

I need some elementium loops for my secret weapon, and it just so happens that [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists use coils like that to bind [[earth elemental]]s.

Find them on the {{NPC||Obsidian Stoneslave}}s east of here, in the terrible region known as the [[Black Breach]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
If you start pulling heaps of elementium coils out of your backpack right now, you're going to make me one happy gnome!

== Completion ==
Terrific! These coils will decompress with the force of a thousand suns!

That's just a rough approximation of course, don't hold me accountable for those numbers.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Magmalord Falthazar]], [[Tempered in Elemental Flame]], [[Hot Stuff]] and [[A Vision of Twilight (Alliance)|A Vision of Twilight]] before heading out. A Vision of Twilight is the only other quest in the Black Breach, though. Quickly find the Eye of Twilight and complete A Vision of Twilight to pick up [[We All Must Sacrifice (Alliance)|We All Must Sacrifice]] before starting to collect springs.

==Progression==
