== Completion ==

No love in your heart for dwarves I see. You really made a mess of that guy.

== Notes ==
Round two, Sully Kneecapper! An elite Wildhammer dwarf with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Charge}}A melee attack that hits for around 8-10k on plate afflicting them with a knockback
*{{abilities|Uppercut}}A weak charge attack that hits for about 2.5k health that stuns the target
*An area of effect attack that lays "mines" on the ground

The melee attack is the main threat in this fight as your tank will become easily overwhelmed without proper healing and the incoming damage is fairly consistent.

While this is going on he will cast his AoE ability which lays a marker on the ground, similar to the Ick and Krik fight in The Pit of Saron. These are easily avoided with proper movement and common sense. 

Lastly, Sully will charge a party member at random. Carrying them a few feet from your group and stunning them. While the damage from this is minimal, it is worth keeping an eye on in case someone is charged into a leftover mine from his AoE attack.
