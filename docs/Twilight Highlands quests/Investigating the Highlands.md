==Objectives==
Meet [[Kalecgos]] in the [[Twilight Highlands]].

==Description==
When I first sensed these essences, I did not anticipate the importance of the role they would play. It is only a matter of time before all of the [[dragonflight]]s are brought into the fold.

Though I have reached out to the other [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]], I have yet to hear from [[Alexstrasza]]. It is odd that she would be silent while these powers manifest.

She was last seen in the [[Vermillion Redoubt]] in Twilight Highlands.

I fear she may be in trouble. We must hurry.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is far worse than expected. We tried to reach the Redoubt, but did not even make it to the ridge.

Something is watching the skies and preventing us from reaching Alexstrasza.

==Notes==
This quest requires a level 60 [[Heart of Azeroth]].

In the Twilight Highlands, Kalecos is tending to an [[Azure Skywing]]. Near them are [[Vermillion Mender]]s and injured [[Vermillion Sentinel]]s.
