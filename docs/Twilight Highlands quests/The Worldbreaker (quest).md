== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Deathwing head on.jpg|Deathwing|You are the only one left who can stand against the Worldbreaker. If you fail, all of Azeroth is doomed.}}
Defeat [[Deathwing]], the Aspect of Death.
* Aid [[Thrall]] in battling Deathwing

== Description ==
There's no time! Deathwing struck before we could form against him. If you do not stop him, the [[Earthen Ring]] will end this day!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Earthcaller Yevaa.jpg|Yevaa|Nightmares threaten to swarm and consume all within Iso'rath.}}
You're awake! Thank the elements. I'd almost lost all hope.

== Notes ==
The quest automatically accepts. DO NOT LEAVE THE AREA OR ABANDON THE QUEST!

Deathwing starts attacking the other members of the Earthen Ring:
:''[[Farseer Nobundo]] is struck down.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|NOBUNDO! NOOO!}}
:{{text|yell|Thrall|You will die this day, Earthwarder! <Name> will see to it!}}
:''Deathwing flies over to [[Aggra]] and kills her.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|Aggra... this can't be... this has gone too far...}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Do something, you useless <race>. My allies are giving their lives for you!}}
:''[[Muln Earthfury]] is then killed.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|Muln falls! And the Earthen Ring dies with him.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|You've failed us all, <name>. Deathwing has won. The world is doomed.}}
:''Deathwing flies over to Thrall and the player.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|We're surrounded! Its defenses are too great. <Name>! Wake up!}}
:''Deathwing casts an enormous breath of fire, covering Thrall and the player.''
Players wake up back in Iso'rath.

Should players somehow leave the area or abandon the quest, get back to Iso'rath (fly to the surface and come back to the bottom if necessary) to reset the phase such that the Earthen Ring are surrounding the bound fire elemental and the [[Blood of Iso'rath]] are swarming the center. "Die" again and players will wake up in the Maelstrom.
