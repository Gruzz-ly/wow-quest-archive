== Objectives ==
Seek out [[Lirastrasza]] at the Circle of Life in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
Hello, <race>. I wish we could meet in more favorable circumstances. The world hangs by a thread, and all that the [[Titans]] have wrought may be in jeopardy.

It saddens me greatly, but my judgment is final. [[Deathwing]] - the horrific creature that was once the Earth Warder and once my friend - must be destroyed.

I have prepared a site atop the Highlands, to the west of the [[Vermillion Redoubt]], where I can bring about his end. Seek out the Circle of Life and speak with Lirastrasza within. I will join you there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}} (or {{cost|8|27}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Hello again, <race>. I hear you were instrumental in our push toward Grim Batol - thank you!

[[Alexstrasza]] has sanctified this ground in the hopes of luring Deathwing here. She'll perform a ceremony to lure him out... and then destroy him within this sacred circle.

Let's hope her plan works.

== Notes ==
To the north-northwest. Easier to circle around Grim Batol than to fly over it.

Lira's new gossip text:
:I understand that Alexstrasza has pronounced judgement on Deathwing. Perhaps this whole ordeal will end, right here?
Cutscene time!
:''Alexstrasza flies in from the west and lands in front of the player. Calen follows shortly behind. They roar and transform into their humanoid forms.''
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza|Mortal, I want you to bear witness to this, but for your own safety stay back. Calen, you too.}}
:{{text|say|Calen|I will not leave your side.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza|Your life isn't yours to throw away, Calen. Should I fail, the fate of this world may rest on your shoulders.}}
:{{text|say|Calen|Yes, mother.}}
:''The player and Calen walk away as Alexstrasza casts a flower-growing spell in the center of the ring to attract Deathwing, who dutifully appears from the south. The area behind Deathwing explodes and remains on fire.
:{{text|say|Deathwing|Lifebinder! Do you presume that I am at your beck and call? I have a world to unmake.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza|It pains me, Neltharion - but I must end you, as I have ended [[Malygos]].}}
:''Deathwing chuckles evilly.''
:{{text|say|Deathwing|"End" me? Lifebinder, you think life is yours to take away?}}
:{{text|say|Deathwing|Life is weak, mortal, fleeting ... fragile.}}
:{{text|say|Deathwing|Death is final. Death is eternal. Death is ... my realm.}}
:{{text|say|Deathwing|Look upon me and you see death incarnate, the unmaker of worlds.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza|I see the hollow metal shell of a once great ally, and the precious gift of the Titans wasted.}}
:{{text|say|Deathwing|Then witness my new gifts, bestowed by this world's true masters.}}
:''Deathwing breathes fire on Alexstrasza and flies away. Alexstrasza regains her dragon form and follows behind him.''
Speak to Calen to continue.
