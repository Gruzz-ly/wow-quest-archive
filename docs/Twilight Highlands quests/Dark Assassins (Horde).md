== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Dark Assassin Pendants.
*[[Dark Assassin's Pendant]] x5

== Description ==
Even I get hunted, <class>. But that's part of the fun of hiding amongst the sheep.

<Garona studies you for a moment.>

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] has taken it up a notch and sent their dark assassins after me. Nice for a group of dead guys. They're made from the souls of only the most skilled killers.

Do me a favor? Hunt them down.

They wear their souls in pendants about their necks. Bring them back to me. Souls optional.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Needle-Threader Gauntlets|Wound-Heart Bracers|Muffled Blunderbuss}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
How many pendants do you have?

== Completion ==
What do you think I should do with all of these? Maybe I'll melt them down and have the metal imbued into a new dagger that I can thrust into Cho'gall's chest.

Think there's time for that?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Bring the Hammer Down (Horde)|Bring the Hammer Down]] and [[Help from the Earthcaller (Horde)|Help from the Earthcaller]] before heading out. Kill any enslaved elementals for a buff:
*Tempest's Blessing: Damage taken decreased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
*Waterspout's Favor: Health regeneration increased by 100% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 Minutes
*Inferno's Invocation: Damage increased by 5% within the Twilight Highlands. 15 minutes.
Dark Assassins are [[shade]]s wandering the area. The cultists are all humanoid.
