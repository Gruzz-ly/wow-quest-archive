== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Lachlan MacGraff}} at [[Kirthaven]] in [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
After the licking we just gave 'em, the Dragonmaw assaults on Thundermar ought to stop. Maybe the Wildhammer do have a place in your Alliance - we Thundermars certainly owe you a debt.

Up in Kirthaven, our Grand Shaman Lachlan MacGraff has been trying to arrange a summit between the surviving Wildhammer family leaders. It's a tall order to get us all to work together, but I'm at least willing to give it a go.

Fly up to Kirthaven in the North and talk to Lachlan MacGraff. I'll meet you there!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|50}} (or {{cost|6|57|50}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Hello, <class>! {{NPC||Keegan Firebeard}} here has told me all about your heroics down south. Thank you for all of your efforts on behalf of the Wildhammer.

I see Colin Thundermar is right behind you. The summit is ready to begin! Please stay and let's see how things unfold...

== Notes ==
Up to the northeast. Make sure to pick up the flight path northeast of town proper.
Most of the clan leaders are in town. MacGraff's gossip text:
:Welcome, friend of the Wildhammer!
:Kirthaven is the spiritual center of our people, the one place where the varied clans can come together in peace.
:It's here we honor our dead heroes, before burying them with their gryphons atop [[Mount Thunderstrike]]. There they spend eternity at one with the sky.
On complete:
:{{text|say|Lachlan|Friends. The Wildhammer way of life is threatened. Our enemies are too numerous for us to remain isolated from one another. We must unite!}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|Unity? Now? The Thundermars weren't exactly unitin' when them Twilight Shaman tore open our stronghold on the shore.}}
:{{text|say|Colin|Oh, that's just like a Firebeard, can't see anything past yer own fat nose. We were up to arses and elbows in Dragonmaw. But did you send a single bird to help? NO!}}
:{{text|say|Lachlan|Gentlemen, please -}}
:{{text|say|Keegan|Thundermar, if we weren't on holy ground I'd pop you one so hard yer shoes would be the only thing left standin'!}}
:{{text|say|Colin|I don't have to take this. I'll be part of no Alliance that has a Firebeard innit. That's me final word!}}
:''Colin storms off.''
:{{text|say|Lachlan|Ach! This'll be harder than I thought.}}
Step outside and speak to Kurdran. His gossip text:
:Yes <name>, I heard the whole miserable thing from out here.
:I was hoping my old Wildhammer brothers could work things out among themselves, but it doesn't look like it. You and I are going to have to get creative.
He offers [[The Bachelor]], which continues the chain.
