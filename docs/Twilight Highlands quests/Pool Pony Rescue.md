==Objectives==
Use the Pool Ponies to rescue 10 [[Krazzworks Laborer]]s that have fallen into the water.
* Krazzworks Laborers rescued (10)
* [[Emergency Pool Pony]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Brett the Bomber|This jerk]] across from me is getting all of our people killed!

Brett "the Bummer" unpacked the [[Krazzworks]] in the wrong place and now it's highly unstable. The explosions from the instability are throwing our laborers off of the platforms and into the water below.

You don't mind flying down there and rescuing them with some pool ponies, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*55200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Maybe you'd be willing to fly back down there and rescue a few more of our laborers?

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>! Now if we could just get the Krazzworks stable so that our people would stop being thrown off of the platforms.
