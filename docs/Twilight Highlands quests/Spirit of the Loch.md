== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Countess Verrall]] at [[Loch Verrall]] in the [[Twilight Highlands]].

== Description ==
I have no knowledge of any artfact that [[Cho'gall]] is crafting, but I think I know one that can help.

Countess Verrall is the ancient spirit of Loch Verrall to the north. She has no love for the [[Twilight's Hammer]], who have polluted her waters.

Seek her for the wisdom that you seek.

== Completion ==
I know why you are here, <name>. Your reasons sing within your fluids.

I know about the dead dwarf forgesmith polluting my lake. If you want to find out what his corpse remembers, you must earn it.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Portal Overload]] and [[Unbinding]] before heading out. Kill the three ascendants and some elementals on the way up to the western end of the loch. Verrall can be found on the bottom of the lake. She helpfully provides a waterbreathing aura.
