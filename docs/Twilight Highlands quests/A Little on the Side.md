== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Elementium Shards.
*[[Elementium Shard]] x6

== Description ==
You know, it's our moral obligation to save all of this [[Elementium]] from the [[shale spider]]s. Those creepy things eat the stuff!

What a waste!

So, what do you say? 90/10 my way?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Shard-Keeper Helm|Bracers of Gleaming Shards|Giltstone Necklace}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
How much do you think you can carry?

== Completion ==
<Goldmine slyly looks at the pile of Elementium shards.>

Hmm, I don't think that stuff's going to sell for much. I better give you your cut right now so you don't feel ripped off.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[While We're Here]] before heading out. Also, notice the [[Twilight Rune of Earth]] just to the south on the lower level. It starts [[Rune Ruination]].

Shale spiders have the shards on them, and they can also be found littering the ground.

==Progression==
{{Twilight Gate}}
