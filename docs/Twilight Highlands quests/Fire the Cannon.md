== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Lord Cannon.jpg|Lord Cannon|Slay him to appease Countess Verall.}}
Slay Lord Cannon.
* [[Lord Cannon]] slain

== Description ==
My arch-nemesis, Lord Cannon, has foolishly decided to throw his allegiance to the [[Twilight's Hammer]].

In the past, we've coexisted with a shaky truce, but his change of heart leaves me little choice but to put an end to him. Or, I should say, if you want the information that you seek from the dead dwarf, you're going to kill Lord Cannon for me.

Seek him at [[Cannon's Inferno]] to the southeast.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Lord Cannon's not dead. I'd know if he were.

== Completion ==
I am pleased. Lord Cannon was always an unworthy adversary.

Very well, <race>, I will help you gain the information which you seek.

== Notes ==
Back to the southeast. Lord Cannon can be found at {{co|40.8|79.1|Twilight Highlands}} in the middle of Cannon's Inferno. He is a level 85 with 116k health. Aggro him:
:{{text|yell|Lord Cannon|She's sent you to do her dirty work, has she? I'll deal with the countess after I've killed you, fleshling!}}
Turn in Portal Overload and Unbinding while down at the south end of the complex.

==Progression==
{{Twilight Gate}}
