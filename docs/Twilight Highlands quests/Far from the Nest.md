== Objectives ==
Recover 6 Vermillion Eggs.
*[[Vermillion Egg]] x6

== Description ==
Look... I know you have no reason to be fond of me, just as I'm not terribly fond of you, but I need any help I can get.

Our eggs are being stolen by these Twilight invaders. I have no doubt that they want to take them back to [[Grim Batol]] to experiment on and pervert. I will NOT let that happen.

If you truly do want to help us, stop them! Recover the eggs. Bring them back to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}} (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)

== Progress ==
[[Twilight dragonflight|Twilight dragons]] were born of these disgusting experiments of theirs. The [[Twilight's Hammer]] have gone too far. [[Deathwing]] has gone too far.

== Completion ==
I don't know if you did this for me or the young inside these eggs, but it doesn't really matter, either way it's clear that you want to be an ally of [[red dragonflight|our flight]]. I appreciate that.

I cannot forgive the attacks by your allies against my brood, but for now, it seems you have chosen the right side.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Encroaching Twilight]] and [[Breach in the Defenses]] before heading out.

Head to the northwest. In the northwest corner of the redoubt is a twilight spire encircling a tree near the back of the valley. Just south of it, at {{co|18.0|16.9|Twilight Highlands}} is a mouth of a cave with a [[Twilight Portal]] inside it. Plant the seed to destroy it. Kill Twilight Abductors and loot the eggs they drop on the ground.

==Progression==
{{Vermillion Redoubt}}
