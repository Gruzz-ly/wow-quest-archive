== Objectives ==
Locate a [[Salvageable Shredder]] on the [[Twilight Shores]], and use it to summon a [[Bilgewater Salvage Expert]]. Defend the shredder until it is operational again.
* Salvageable Shredder Located
* Salvageable Shredder Defended

== Description ==
<Name>, I've got plans for a better [[shredder]]. But my engineers can't wade into a combat zone alone.

Go locate a salvageable shredder in the Twilight Shores, and use it to signal one of my salvage experts to join you. Defend the shredder while we make some "upgrades."

The Alliance won't know what hit them! At least, not until my marketing campaign kicks in!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mechano-Assembler Headguard
|Leggings of Shredded Protection
|Shredder-Salvage Spaulders}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*55200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Is my salvage expert still alive? More importantly... is my shredder?

== Completion ==
That's right baby! That's right! Cold steel and hot death!

What should we name our new creation? The Gnugatron? No - better - the <name>-o-matic. That's got a ring to it.
