== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Glopgut Ogres. Your [[Twilight's Hammer]] disguise will automatically apply while inside [[Glopgut's Hollow]].
* Glopgut Ogres Slain  (10)

== Description ==
Your disguise is ready, <name>. Whenever you go north into Glopgut's Hollow now, your Twilight's Hammer regalia will fool the ogres.

The rest of the plan is simple: you kill a bunch of Glopgut ogres, and they blame the cult. Are you ready to create some havoc in the ogre camp? I thought so.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cult-Hide Spaulders
|Bracers of False Night
|Ogre-Slayer Chestplate}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

== Progress ==
How is your disguise holding up? And what's happening with those ogres?

== Completion ==
Hah! I'm sure Twilight's Hammer wanted to number those ogres among their ranks. Now they'll probably have to fight them off instead.

This is good, <name>. With one well-placed <class> we managed to do the work of a small army. I'll let [[Warlord Krogg]] know of your work here!
