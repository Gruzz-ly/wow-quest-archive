==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Hammelhand}} on the road East of [[Kirthaven]], and escort a supply caravan back to town.
* Supply Caravan Escorted

==Description==
It would be an insult to celebrate a Wildhammer wedding without drink. {{NPC||Kurdran Wildhammer||Kurdran}} himself called for a few kegs of rare Thunderbrew Lager to be sent ashore from [[Highbank]], but the caravan can't get through the pass.

Follow the road east of here, around the south side of [[Thunderstrike Mountain]], and catch up with the caravan. Look for a fellow named Hammelhand, and help him get the booze through the pass!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9}} (or {{cost|13|15|50}} at max level)

==Progress==
Is the road clear? Or were the Dragonmaw causing trouble again?

==Completion==
Ahh, Russell the Bard is always raving about Thundermar Lager. I guess it doesn't have the kick of a good Wildhammer brew, but he goes on and on about the "body" or "flavor." I guess we'll find out, eh?

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Something Bold]], [[Something Stolen]] and [[Something Stewed]] before heading out.

While killing owls on the road south of Thunderstrike Mountain, keep heading east, where at {{co|64.4|22.6|Twilight Highlands}} just north of the road, is Hammelhand.

Speak to him:
:Careful there, <laddie/lass>. Between the worg down below and the orcs lurking in the pass, a <class> could get <hisself/herself> killed up here.
{{gossip|''I'm here to escort a delivery to Kirthaven.''}}
:''A lookout and two couriers spawn and immediately set out.''
:{{text|say|Wildhammer Lookout|Woohoo! We got us a convoy!}}
:{{text|say|Hammelhand|Keep yer eyes open, <name>! That road is crawling with Dragonmaw.}}
The couriers do not have much health, so keep an eye on them. The Lookout will charge any Dragonmaw that get close and the Couriers will freeze in terror until the Lookout is no longer fighting anything.
