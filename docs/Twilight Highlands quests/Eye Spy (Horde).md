== Objectives ==
Peer into the [[Eye of Twilight]] for [[Garona Halforcen|Garona]].
* Peered into the Eye

== Description ==
This terrible thing makes my hair stand on end. [[Cho'gall]] uses these to control his minions - now it's time to use it against him.

Let me see... hmm, it's all cloudy. All I can see is you. Why is it showing me you?

<Garona sets the eye out in front of her.>

Look into the eye and tell me what you see. Peer into Cho'gall's lair! What is he doing? Is he heavily guarded? Tell me!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Eye of Reversal
|Shard-Heart Ring}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|50}}

== Progress ==
What did the Eye show you?

== Completion ==
You've gone pale, <class>. What did the Eye show you?

You saw Cho'gall? Wait - Cho'gall saw you? He's watching us? He's watching us right now!?

Damn this stupid dark magic! I'm going to have to infiltrate Cho'gall's stronghold myself.

== Notes ==
The Eye of Twilight is right next to Garona. Interact with it.
:''The camera pulls in close to the eye, then suddenly, it sees the eye's duplicate on the other side of the zone. The camera pans over to a Twilight Servant who kneels in front of Cho'gall.''
:{{text|say|Twilight Servant|We have confirmed the Horde presence at Dragonmaw Port, master. They are now in league.}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|This changes nothing. (Nothing nothing changes. Crush them, crush.)}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|What of our agents in Orgrimmar? (City engulfed in stone and sand, we see it! The Eye sees into its heart.) Bring me the eye.}}
:''The servant cowers in fear.''
:{{text|say|Twilight Servant|Our agents have been outed and killed, master.}}
:''The servant runs off to the eye off screen and walks back with it.''
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|([[Blasphemy|Blaspheme]]! Blaspheme disgust hate hate...) No matter. Where one eye closes, another opens. (The Master sees all! The Master knows all!) We will know our enemy's hearts, for they are weak. The eye. Now.}}
:''The servant places the matching Eye of Twilight in front of Cho'gall.''
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|The shadow of the Master covers this world... (Darkness, all darkness.) Our enemies fight one another, across the Highland. Fools. (Blood, blood.) WAIT! There is another!}}
:''The camera pulls in close to Cho'gall.''
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|A mortal dares peer into the eye! (Brave little plaything.) I see you, little one! You want to see what the Eye sees, do you? (Show it! Show it all!)}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|Behold the chaos to come. (Madness, madness, bliss!) Do you like what you see mortal?}}
:''The camera pulls back, out of the building and pans around to show an [[ettin]], then looks over the ettin's shoulder up at the [[Bastion of Twilight]] itself, with some twilight dragons circling it, then keeps panning around to show a [[gronn]], who strikes at the camera. The vision ends. As the player regains its senses back at Bloodgulch...''
:{{text|whisper|Voice of Cho'gall|(The master sees you! He sees! He sees! He wants! Wants wants...)}}
On complete:
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|Do you see me now, Cho'gall? I'm coming for you! I'm going to rip off your head while the other watches!}}
:''Garona strikes the eye, which explodes and disappears.''
