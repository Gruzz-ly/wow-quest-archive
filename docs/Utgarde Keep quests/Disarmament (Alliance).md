== Progress ==
You pinch a load a' them vrykul axes?

Will ya just look at 'em? Incredible.

I half expected these neanderthals to be swingin' around clubs and throwin' rock.

No such luck...

Take it from me, <lad/lass>, them vrykul weapons be downright nasty!

I've felt their edge personally, and there be somethin' unnatural about 'em.  Deceptively well-balanced, wickedly sharp - just plain deadly.

I need you to pilfer some o' them weapons before they're used on us!
