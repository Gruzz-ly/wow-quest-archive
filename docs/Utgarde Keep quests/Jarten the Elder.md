==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Coin of Ancestry]]

==Completion==
It is good to know the people of this land still pay homage to the olden races.  I bid you well, <name>, and offer you this token...

==Notes==
Elder Jarten is located in an alcove just past the [[Prince Keleseth|Prince Keleseth's]] room, and before the staircase up. Just turn around to the left when you approach the landing before you go up the stairs.

This Elder will be a part of the 2009 [[Lunar Festival]]. Visiting this elder will help you complete the [[achievement]] [[To Honor One's Elders]].
