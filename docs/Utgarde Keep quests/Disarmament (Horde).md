==Objectives==
[[Dark Ranger Marrah]] wants you to steal 5 Vrykul Weapons from [[Utgarde Keep]] and bring them to  [[High Executor Anselm]] in [[Vengeance Landing]].
*[[Vrykul Weapon]] (5)

==Description==
We must discover the secret to these savages' weapons!

If you'd have seen how easily they cut through my companions, you'd understand my sense of urgency. Just have a look at their forge if you doubt my words.

Scour the place. Gather all of their arms that you can carry and bring them to Anselm for his inspection.

Do not fail us, <class>. Every weapon you are able to bring out of this place is one less that we must face in the field.

==Progress==
What have you got there, <class>?

==Completion==
Marrah has informed us of the superiority of the Vrykul's weaponry. We'll have a look at these and see if there's anything to learn.

Take this for your trouble, <class>.

==Rewards==

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Necklace of Calm Skies
|Hundred Tooth Necklace
|Amulet of Constrained Power
|Tiled-Stone Pendant}}
