==Objectives==
[[High Executor Anselm]] wants you to go into [[Utgarde Keep|Utgarde]] and slay Prince Keleseth.
*[[Prince Keleseth]] slain

==Description==
This [[San'layn|elf prince]] thinks he can come to my town, insult my queen, kill my men and get away with it? He thinks we're going to stand by while the hordes of Utgarde build up to launch an attack?

Not in a million years.

You're going to walk right into Utgarde and kill him in front of any of these [[vrykul]] gorillas that might be watching. I want Arthas to know that we've arrived and we're playing for keeps. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wraps of the San'layn
|Vendetta Bindings
|Runecaster's Bracers
|Vambraces of the Vengeance Bringer}}

==Progress==
It is good to see you again, <name>. Unless you haven't killed that aberration of an elf yet, in which case I'd get going if I were you.

==Completion==
Keleseth is out of the way? Excellent.

That will make our task here all the more simple.

{{Rfg-section|4.3.0}}
Revenge feels good.  To think that this is but a taste of what's to come.

Arthas will get what he deserves soon enough.  Then and only then will I die a happy man.
