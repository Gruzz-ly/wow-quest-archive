==Objectives==
Find [[Kang Bramblestaff]].

==Description==
Kang's pride regularly becomes overconfidence, which often leads him down dangerous paths. His current path is as dangerous as any - he is headed deep into the [[Krasarang Wilds]].

I wouldn't normally ask a favor of a stranger, but... would you make sure that he is well? It would give me relief to know that a brave <race> was looking out for him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||94}}
*6940 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm pretty sure this settlement wasn't here a few weeks ago. Where did these people come from?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ken-Ken (quest)]], [[Clever Ashyo (quest)]], and [[Lin Tenderpaw (quest)]] before heading out. These quests will not be quickly completed, as they all lead to other zones, so focus instead on the quests around [[Pang's Stead]] with [[Low Turnip Turnout]].

Kang can be found at [[Incursion|The Incursion]] in the [[Krasarang Wilds]]. Players will be sent there after shoring up the [[Zhu Province]] in [[Into the Wilds (Alliance)]].
