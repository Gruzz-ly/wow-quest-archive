*Find Baine Bloodhoof at the Shrine of Two Moons

==Description==
Ah, <name>, we meet again. I have heard some wondrous news.

High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof of the [[tauren]] has arrived here on [[Pandaria]].

He meets with Warchief [[Garrosh Hellscream]] and Regent Lord [[Lor'themar Theron]] now, at the Shrine of Two Moons in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

He sent me a strange request - to send him a loyal champion of the Horde, capable of combat... and discretion.

I can think of none better to send than you. Speak to Tak-Tak if you seek transport. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118,000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Completion==
Well met, <class>. You were sent from Domination Point? Very well. We have much to discuss.
