==Objectives==
Rescue 8 captives of the [[mogu]].
*[[Captive Sentinel|Captives]] Freed (8)

==Description==
We were searching the [[Ruins of Korja|ruins south of here]] when the mogu fell upon us out of nowhere.

Some of us were able to retreat to [[Sentinel Basecamp|this encampment]] but many others were captured. The mogu have also caught a number of [[Horde]] and [[pandaren]] who happened to be in the area as well.

Please, <name>, rescue any sentinels  that you can.

Leave the [[Dawnchaser Captive|Dawnchasers]] to their fate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will not have my people condemned to slavery and torture at the hands of the mogu.

==Completion==
There are so few of us, it is a great relief to see such help.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sever Their Supply Line]] and [[Re-Reclaim (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Just south of the basecamp is a small [[jinyu]] village, [[Fallsong Village]], beset by [[saurok]]. [[Tired Shushen]] offers a couple of quests, [[Thieving Raiders]] and [[Raid Leader Slovan]].

To the southeast is the [[Field of Korja]] and the [[Ruins of Korja]]. [[Korjan Reclaimer|reclaimers]] and [[Korjan Collector|collectors]] are wandering the area, guarding captive NPCs and loot on the ground. Kill reclaimers, free captives, loot the loot, then return to base camp. Back at camp are [[Ambassador Han]] and some [[Wounded Traveller]]s.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ambassador Han|<name>, we could use a champion like you in [[Stoneplow]].}}

==Progression==
