==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Wildscale Saurok]] or [[Wildscale Herbalist]]s in [[Zhu Province]].
*Wildscale Saurok slain (10)

==Description==
With our grip on the province loosening, [[saurok]] from the wilds have already moved in to the cave just north of town.

Most of our hunters are face-down in their own tears, so the saurok just walk in here like they own the place and grab whatever they want!

I want to send a message that [[Zhu's Watch]] is not to be crossed.

Will you be my messenger?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 399 necklaces
|Sha-Haunted Locket
|Choker of Despair
|Wildscale Amulet
|Red Crane Pendant
|Pendant of the Lost Dynasty}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We cannot let the saurok walk all over us anymore.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. That should teach those savages to know their boundaries.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Why So Serious?]] and [[Borderlands (quest)]] before heading out.

Head northwest into the cave and get started killing saurok. In the back of the cave is the [[Jar of Pigment]], probably guarded by a Herbalist. Loot it, then get out of the cave, heading toward the southwest to reach the panther area. They drop several fangs at a time. The three fires are on the border between the cleared area and the mostly-untouched wilds.
