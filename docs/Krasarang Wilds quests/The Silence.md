==Objectives==
Use the Alliance Flare Gun.
*Use the Alliance Flare Gun
*[[Alliance Flare Gun]] (provided)

==Description==
D..did we... do it?

<[[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] mumbles the words, even though the effort clearly costs him.>

L..look... in.. my... bag...

Use... flare...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|34|20}}
*353000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Alliance]]
*[[Grand Gryphon]]

==Progress==
Well met.

==Completion==
I hesitate to guess what would have happened if you had not been there with the young Prince, <name>.

Today, you put an end to [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh's]] plans.

You have undoubtedly saved thousands of lives, and most importantly, you brought Anduin back to us.

We are doing everything we can for the boy, but we can only wait and see.

I believe he has the fight in him. I must believe it...

<[[Taylor|Admiral Taylor]] chokes up and looks away.>

==Notes==
Use the provided [[Alliance Flare Gun]]:
:''Fennie Hornswaggle flies in on her kite.''
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Saw yer flare 'n came as quick as I could!}}
:''She dismounts and runs over to Anduin.''
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Oh no! Prince Anduin!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Don't worry. I'll get Anduin back to Lion's Landing safely. We'll meet ye there.}}
Fennie doesn't provide a ride, so get back to [[Lion's Landing]] the old-fashioned way. Anduin and Taylor are inside the keep, not outside in the field.

[[File:The Silence finale.jpg|thumb|Jaina, Varian, and Anduin]]
On complete, Varian and Jaina enter from the eastern side of the room:
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Garrosh attacked my son...? Where is he?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Anduin!}}
:''Jaina spots Anduin and runs to him, kneeling over his prone body. Varian is not far behind her.''
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Anduin, what were you thinking? I should've sent you back to Stormwind!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|He's alive, but his bones are shattered.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Send for [[Velen]]. Bring him here at once!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|My King, I promise you. The [[Kirin Tor|Kirin-Tor]] will come down on Garrosh so hard his ancestors will reel. Blood will pay for blood!}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Jaina-}}
:''Jaina teleports away in a flash.''
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|I will end Garrosh for this. His Horde already crumbles beneath him. We will deliver the final blow.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Champion, you and Anduin thwarted the Warchief today and won the Alliance a critical victory.}}
:''Varian's voice finally breaks as he kneels down to tend to Anduin.''
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|But please, leave me now. I must tend to my son... and prepare for our next battle.}}
This completes the "Breath of Darkest Shadow" portion of [[Operation: Shieldwall Campaign]], and thus, awards the achievement itself.
