==Objectives==
Kill 10 Ik'thik Mantid.
*[[Ik'thik Precursor]] slain (10)

==Description==
The [[mantid]]! They came out of nowhere and smashed our convoy to ruin, scattering our people this way and that.

Now they are preparing to hit [[Stoneplow]].

Please, <class>, destroy some of these beasts before they get sufficient numbers to flank our home.

If my cousin, {{NPC||Ambassador Len}}, is still alive and at our convoy he should be able to reward you for your help.

==Progress==
It has been many thousands of years since mantid were seen on this side of the Great Wall.

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <class>! I've never seen anybody stand up to the mantid like that before. 

Well, other than the [[Shado-Pan]], of course...
