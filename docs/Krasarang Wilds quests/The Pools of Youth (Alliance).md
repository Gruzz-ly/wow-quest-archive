==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lorekeeper Vaeldrin.jpg|Lorekeeper Vaeldrin|A sense of urgency fills you.}}
Obtain some of the Water of Youth.
*[[The Water of Youth]]

==Description==
[[File:Pools of Youth.jpg|thumb|The Pools of Youth]]
North! Go north to the [[Pools of Youth]]. Get some of the water but be on your guard.

The [[mogu]] list this as a "high value" target. [[Kang Bramblestaff]] will meet you there if he has not already arrived by your side.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 399 cloaks|Drape of the Lagoon|Waterfall Drape|Canopy Drape|Greenback Cape|Balmy Drape}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nothing like being mortal to give one a sense of urgency.

==Completion==
You... you found the pools! The waters do exist!

Something is wrong, though. I feel equal parts shadow and light swirling in this vial.

==Notes==
[[File:The Pools of Youth.jpg|thumb|Brojai is unhappy that Na Lek has been freed]]
Just to the northwest of the dominator's position is a bridge. Cross it to reach the [[Pools of Youth]], where [[Na Lek]] is frozen in the middle of the pool. Speak with him:
:<Na Lek smiles at you, and you feel young as though you have not felt in years.>
:{{gossip|Attempt to free Na Lek from his prison.}}
:''[[Groundbreaker Brojai]] teleports in.''
:{{text|yell|Groundbreaker Brojai|Halt, supplicant! These waters belong to the Thunder King. Your presence is unwelcome.}}
:{{text|yell|Groundbreaker Brojai|Guardians! Kill these intruders.}}
Four [[Sleeping Guardian]]s, level 86 [[quilen]] with 184,000 health, awaken and have the following ability:
*{{abilities|Petrifying Strike|Inflict 110% weapon damage and petrify the target reducing movement speed and haste by 10% for 10 sec.|notes=Instant. Stacks.}}
However, players will not have to fight all by themselves, as Na Lek channels a healing aura that heals for 3583 health a tick.

On victory:
:{{text|emote|Na Lek embues <name> with gratitude and returns to the waters of the pool.}}
:{{text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|Look at that. The little guy left you some purified water.}}
Loot one of the water pools, jump down to the lower road and return to the Incursion.

==Progression==
{{Trapped at the Incursion}}
