==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Groundbreaker Brojai.jpg|Groundbreaker Brojai|The Lord Reclaimer}}
Find Lyalia and kill Groundbreaker Brojai.
*[[Groundbreaker Brojai]] slain {{co|23.6|48.8|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
They have my daughter! Brojai... that Lord Reclaimer! I can see him clearly through [[Lyalia]]'s eyes.

That foolish girl must have tried to take him head on.

Please, <name>! Go to the [[Ruins of Korja]] and try to free her.

I'll get [[Kang Bramblestaff|Kang]] and try to draw out Brojai from the ruins with a distraction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Lyalia is the only family I have left. I had to bury her mother during the war of Ahn'Qiraj.

==Completion==
Thank you for avenging my daughter. I am not willing to let her stay dead, however.

==Notes==
[[File:The Lord Reclaimer - setup.jpg|thumb|The setup]]
Back down to the southwest to the southern end of the [[Ruins of Korja]]. Lyalia and [[Kor Bloodtusk]] are trapped in a net. Speak with her:
:It... it's a trap...
:{{gossip|<Try to untie Lyalia.>}}
:''Brojai teleports in.''
:{{text|say|Groundkeeper Brojai|You fail to bend the knee to our power? Then die like the vermin you are.}}
:''Brojai smites Kor and Lyalia, killing both.''
:{{text|yell|Sunwalker Dezco|KOR! NOOOOOOO!}}
:{{text|yell|Lorekeeper Vaeldrin|LYALIA! NOOOOOOOO!}}
The fight begins. The [[Sunwalker Dezco]] and [[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin]] will come out swinging at ''each other'', and not the mogu, so ignore them and keep attention on Brojai. Every now and then Brojai will stop what he's doing and channel Revive Guardian on one of the statues to activate it.
:{{text|bossemote|Groundbreaker Brojai is reviving a Ruined Guardian.}}
:{{text|yell|Groundkeeper Brojai|Guardian! Awaken and defend your master!}}
The [[Ruined Guardian]] has 107,000 health, so quickly take it out then go back to Brojai.

On victory:
:''Vaeldrin and Dezco walk up to the corpses of Lyalia and Kor and stare each other down.''
:{{text|say|Lorekeeper Vaeldin|What now, Sunwalker?}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|I think we have both lost enough today, old elf. See to your dead.}}
:{{text|say|Lorekeeper Vaeldin|Agreed.}}
:''Vaeldrin kneels down to Lyalia's body.''
:{{text|say|Lorekeeper Vaeldrin|Lyalia! I am so sorry, my child.}}
:{{text|say|Lorekeeper Vaeldin|<Name>, meet me at the [[Sentinel Basecamp]]. I must bring my daughter's body there. We still have the Water of Youth.}}
:''The five NPCs despawn.''
Head back to the basecamp to turn in.
