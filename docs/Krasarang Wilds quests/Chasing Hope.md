*[[Spirit of the Crane (NPC)|Spirit of the Crane]] found x3

==Description==
[[Chi-Ji]] is always with us. Even when he is not here in the [[Cradle of Chi-Ji|Cradle]], pieces of his spirit run through the forests and beaches of the island, watching us and testing us.

Prove your dexterity in the eyes of Chi-Ji, <name>. Find and catch the spirits of the crane.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 XP
* +250 reputation with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Return when you are finished, <name>. Now go!

==Completion==
Chi-Ji smiles on you.

==Notes==
Ghostly afterimages of Chi-Ji are running around the island, faster than epic mount speed, but slower than 310% flying speed. Get in front of one, land, wait for it to run through your model, then repeat.

==Progression==
{{Cradle of Chi-Ji dailies}}
