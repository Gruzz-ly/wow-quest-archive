==Notes==
When players ask [[Tak-Tak]] for a ride, he'll make the following small talk:
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Heya! I'm Tak-Tak. I'll take you to the Vale now, just like the big green guy over there told me to.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Wait an ookin' jibbet! Are you the wikket dat cleared the beach of jerb-derkin' Alliance slicky-siders?}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|You did all of that? You bammin'!}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|You know, big brown guy was lookin' for a trip up north earlier. Some Garrod... err... Ganosh... err... anyway, I didn't get his name.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|He looked real important. Tak-Tak try to chitchatter with 'im, but he jus' stared at me so I shut my jabber real quick.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Oh, looks like we're here!}}

In the shrine, head upstairs to the [[Chamber of Wisdom]]. In attendance are [[Ellendra Palescorn]], [[Lor'themar Theron]], [[Garrosh Hellscream]], [[Malkorok]], [[Ishi]], and a [[Kor'kron Marine]]. On approach, Garrosh and Malkorok say:
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Just look at this place, Malkorok. THIS is the prosperity that our people deserve!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Tell me again the names of those who built this kingdom.}}
:{{text|say|Malkorok|The mogu, Warchief. In the tome of pandaren history, they are written as cruel, relentless leaders. They were feared, not loved.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Indeed? It appears I have much to learn from these "mogu."}}
