==Objectives==
Use "Scrutiny" to set off 10 Riverblade Spike Traps from a safe distance.
*[[Riverblade Spike Trap|Traps]] Poked (10)
*[["Scrutiny"]] (provided)

==Description==
My students tell me the surrounding area is littered with deadly traps, no doubt set by the [[saurok]]. Stumbling into one gets you a face full of spikes.

As the saying goes: "The Way is rife with danger - tread lightly, and with scrutiny."

<Koro hands you a long tree branch.>

Here, this is scrutiny.

It should be long enough to set the traps off at a safe distance.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, I don't see any spikes in your face. That's a good sign.

==Completion==
Every trap you sprang is a life saved, be it [[pandaren]], [[beast]], or otherwise. Nobody deserves an honorless death like that.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Blinding the Riverblades]] and [[The Murksweats]] before heading out.

Saurok are to the west and south. Snakes are in the water. Get within interact distance of the traps (but not too close), then click on "Scrutiny", then the traps to avoid taking damage and get quest credit.

On complete of all three:
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Anduin, will you join me? With the saurok threat at bay for now, it's time we discuss our next move.}}
:{{text|say|[[Anduin Wrynn]]|Certainly.}}
:''Anduin walks over from his position to where Koro is sitting.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|There should be plenty of [[Anti-Venom_(disambiguation)|anti-venom]], thanks to <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Thank you - both of you. The [[Chi-Ji|Red Crane]] has always symbolized hope to our people, but in his absence, I fear that even my thoughts began to darken.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Think no more on despair, Koro. We have a saying where I'm from: It is darkest just before the dawn.}}
:{{text|emote|Koro Mistwalker chuckles.}}
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|That it is. You speak with a wisdom beyond your years. If we get through this, I think I'd like to know more about where you're from.}}
They both offer quests.
