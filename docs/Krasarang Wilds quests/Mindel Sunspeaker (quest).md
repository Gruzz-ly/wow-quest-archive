Defeat Mindel Sunspeaker.
*[[Mindel Sunspeaker]] defeated {{co|32.1|69.9|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
Our highest-ranked trainee is an outsider like you. It is both strange and exciting to live in a time when so many foreigners have embraced the way of the [[Chi-Ji|Crane]].

Your challenger's name is Mindel Sunspeaker, and he awaits you within [[Angkhal Pavilion]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Don't lose, <name>.

==Completion==
You are now our highest-ranked trainee. You are no longer obligated to participate in trainee duels. Congratulations!

Of course, there are still other ways to prove yourself. I have the feeling I will be seeing you again...

==Notes==
Mindel is at [[Angkhal Pavilion]], immediately to the south of the questgivers. Speak with him:
:Nobody can defeat me.
:I've been on [[Cradle of Chi-Ji|this island]] for weeks, fighting duels every day, and nobody's come close to winning.
:Is this the best Pandaria has to offer?
:{{gossip|Let's fight!}}
:{{text|say|Mindel Sunspeaker|<sigh>...Let's get this over with.}}
Mindel is a level 90 blood elf with 787,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Sunstrike|range=Melee|Strikes target enemy, inflicting Fire damage and additionally inflicts Fire damage every 1 sec for 7 secs.|notes=Hits for 4100 Fire, ticks for 2050 Fire.}}
*{{abilities|Sunflare Kick|Inflicting Fire damage every .5 secs for 6 secs to all enemies within 7 yards.|notes=Channeled. Uninterruptible.|cd=8 sec}}
Get out of the sunflare kick. Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Mindel Sunspeaker|Now THAT's what I was looking for! You've given me a reason to train again, <class>.}}

[[Yan Quillpaw]] sends today's letter:
{{book|I Challenge You|content=You have defeated every student that had a chance of beating you. But you have not yet defeated me.

I may be one of your trainers, but I am not too proud to test my skills against a student.

I challenge you to a duel, <name>. See you in the Cradle.}}
