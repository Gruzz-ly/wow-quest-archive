==Objectives==
Gather 20 Imperial Lotus Leaves.
*[[Imperial Lotus Leaves]] (20)

==Description==
The [[mogu]] really like their poisons and curses. Mama Bramblestaff always said lotus tea cures any mogu curse.

I saw some imperial lotus plants in the nearby [[Ruins of Dojan]]. We should go gather some of their leaves and keep them on hand just in case the mogu get unruly.

Also this will give me a chance to introduce my fists to some mogu faces.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5x [[Lotus Water]]
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have never seen the mogu this numerous before. They have always been a nuisance but never this bad.

==Completion==
That's it! You pick, I punch!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|You could learn much by watching me in action.}}

Pick up [[Where are the Pools]] and [[Threat from Dojan (Alliance)]] before heading out. Kang will join the party on accept. Follow the road south and west, cross the [[Dojani River]], then keep going west when the road turns north to reach the [[Ruins of Dojan]].

On the road leading to the Ruins of Dojan:
:{{Text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|This is the old Imperial Road. They say the mogu empire used to bring their prisoners here for torture.}}

On the stairs in the Ruins of Dojan:
:{{Text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|I don't think these mogu are from here. They seem to be scavenging old relics, not digging in or pillaging.}}

During fights:
*{{Text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|Victory is mine!}}
*{{Text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|Face the wrath of the Bramblestaff!}}
*{{Text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|I think I punched him so hard his ancestors felt it.}}
*{{Text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|I think I will just sit this one out.}}

Respawn:
:{{Text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|Come, my apprentice! You ARE my apprentice, right...?}}

[[Imperial Lotus Leaves]] are all over the grounds and gathered 2-4 at a time. As are the [[Dojani Surveyor]]s and [[Dojani Reclaimer]]s. Feel free to turn in Lotus Tea as soon as the 20th set of leaves are gathered - Kang will not leave the player. Up at the higher level of the ruins is the Dojani Dominator, a level 86 mogu with 368,000 health. Kill him to loot the Dojani Orders from him. He is shared-tap, so don't worry about having to get the only tap if the area is busy. Where are the Pools is remote-completable, so finish the quest in the ruins and pick up [[The Pools of Youth (Alliance)]].

Just to the northwest of the dominator's position is a bridge. Cross it to reach the [[Pools of Youth]], where [[Na Lek]] is frozen in the middle of the pool. Speak with him:
:<Na Lek smiles at you, and you feel young as though you have not felt in years.>
:{{gossip|Attempt to free Na Lek from his prison.}}
:{{text|yell|Groundbreaker Brojai|Halt, supplicant! These waters belong to the Thunder King. Your presence is unwelcome.}}
:{{text|yell|Groundkeeper Brojai|Guardians! Kill these intruders.}}
A [[Sleeping Guardian]], a level 86 [[quilen]] with 384,000 health, awakens and has the following ability:
*{{abilities|Petrifying Strike|Inflict 110% weapon damage and petrify the target reducing movement speed and haste by 10% for 10 sec.|notes=Instant. Stacks.}}
However, players will not have to fight all by themselves, as Na Lek channels a healing aura that heals for 3583 health a tick.

On victory:
:{{text|emote|Na Lek embues <name> with gratitude and returns to the waters of the pool.}}
:{{text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|Look at that. The little guy left you some purified water.}}
Loot one of the water pools, jump down to the lower road and return to the Incursion.

==Progression==
{{Trapped at the Incursion}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2024-05-10|bluenote=Fixed a bug preventing the completion of "Lotus Tea" after completing "[[The Pools of Youth (Alliance)]]".}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
