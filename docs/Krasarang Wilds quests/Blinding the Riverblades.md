==Objectives==
Kill 8 Riverblade Pathstalkers in the areas surrounding [[Crane Wing Refuge]].
*[[Riverblade Pathstalker]] slain (8)

==Description==
"A hooded falcon catches no quarry."

This is one of the first mantras we teach young monks at the temple. It means that even a foe as swift and lethal as a falcon can be neutralized by depriving its senses.

The [[saurok|sauren]] have scouts all over the region acting as eyes for their raiding parties.

It's time we put their eyes out, don't you think?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We cannot risk any more saurok ambushes, but we're in no position to take them on in force. Fortunately, with you here, we shouldn't need to.

==Completion==
Well done. I only wish I could have accompanied you...

The blood on these hand-wraps is not my own, you know.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Tread Lightly]] and [[The Murksweats]] before heading out.

Saurok are to the west and south. Snakes are in the water. Get within interact distance of the traps (but not too close), then click on "Scrutiny", then the traps to avoid taking damage and get quest credit.

On complete of all three:
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Anduin, will you join me? With the saurok threat at bay for now, it's time we discuss our next move.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Certainly.}}
:''Anduin walks over from his position to where Koro is sitting.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|There should be plenty of anti-venom, thanks to <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Thank you - both of you. The Red Crane has always symbolized hope to our people, but in his absence, I fear that even my thoughts began to darken.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Think no more on despair, Koro. We have a saying where I'm from: It is darkest just before the dawn.}}
:{{text|emote|Koro Mistwalker chuckles.}}
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|That it is. You speak with a wisdom beyond your years. If we get through this, I think I'd like to know more about where you're from.}}
They both offer quests.
