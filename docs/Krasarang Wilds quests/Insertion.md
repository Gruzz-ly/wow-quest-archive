==Objectives==
Use the Sunreaver Portal in [[Domination Point]] to secure a teleport to [[Darnassus]].
*Take the [[Sunreaver Portal: Darnassus|portal]] to Darnassus

==Description==
<Name>! You'll do perfectly.

We know where the [[Alliance]] have hidden the [[:Divine Bell]]. We've already inserted an agent into enemy territory, we just need you to help him execute his mission.

Pack up, <name>. You're headed to Darnassus.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Completion==
<Name>! So glad Nazgrim selected you.

It's taken a great deal of the Horde's effort to get you here through Jaina's traps. Maintaining our illusion this close to Darnassus is considerably expensive.

Furthermore, the Sunreavers of Dalaran are risking their neutrality by assisting the Horde with this operation.

In other words, we expect only the best from you.

==Notes==
*The portal is maintained by a [[Silvermoon Mage (Landfall)|Silvermoon Mage]].
