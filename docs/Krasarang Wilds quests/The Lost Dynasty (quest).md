==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Dynastic Tablets.
*[[Dynastic Tablet]] x6

==Description==
I wonder if I could bother you for another task. My daughter, the good [[Lyalia|Sentinel Commander Lyalia]] here, refuses to let me go into the field.

I have spent everyday in that oubliette staring at the ruins to our north, itching to investigate.

If we are where I suspect we are those ruins could contain the key we need to finding the fabled [[Pools of Youth]]!

Please, <class>! Go to those ruins and salvage any tablets that still have writing on them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 399 rings|Ring of the Pools of Youth|Ring of Tears|Toothrow Band|Seal of Lost Centuries|Seal of the Forbidden Jungle}}
You will also receive:
* {{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 XP

==Progress==
It is one thing to research the lost dynasties. It is quite another to visit their ancient ruins.

I am giddy as I have not felt in centuries!

==Completion==
Oh! Fabulous! Fabulous!

Your one trip has advanced my research more than ten years of reading dusty tomes and decaying scrolls...

And those "[[mogu]]" you saw. I have been doing some research as well as speaking to [[Kang Bramblestaff|Kang]] on the subject.

I suspect now that they were the race of the lost dynasties that my research is derived from.

Of course, that also means that they are the ones who used to control the Pools of Youth.

==Notes==
[[File:Krasari Ruins.jpg|thumb|Find tablets in the Krasari Ruins.]]
Pick up [[Blind Them! (Alliance)]] and [[Squirmy Delight (quest)]] before heading out.

Swing to the northwest to reach the [[Dojani River]] and start killing water striders. The scout paths along the east-west road from [[Thunder Cleft]] to the [[Krasari Ruins]]. He is a level 86 [[Sunwalkers]] (paladin) tauren with 368,000 health. Stay well clear of the road unless actively trying to engage him. More skitterers can be found in the pool north of the tauren camp. Once enough glands have been gathered, swing back to the west to reach the Krasari Ruins. Tablet fragments litter the ground. The mogu have a very wide aggro radius (compared to other at-level mobs), so be a bit more aggressive about clearing a path through the ruins.
