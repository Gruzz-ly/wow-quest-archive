==Objectives==
Speak with [[Vereesa Windrunner]] to travel to [[Lion's Landing]], then speak with [[King Varian Wrynn]].

==Description==
Thank you for your aid today, <name>.  I will be handling the purge from here on out.

[[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] will soon be off to Lion's Landing, to speak with King Varian.  She asked for your attendance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|34|20}}
*353000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]
*+350 reputation with [[Alliance]]

==Completion==
I can't fault you for following orders.  In fact, I can't really fault Jaina for acting on her own behalf, for once.

But still... we aren't playing a game here.  We are dealing with war, with people's lives, with the future of the Alliance itself.

At the very least, we now have the [[Kirin Tor]] on our side.  Today will be remembered by all as a victory for the Alliance.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Vereesa Windrunner]] for a teleport back to [[Lion's Landing]]. There, in the throne room of the keep, [[Varian Wrynn]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], and [[Jaina Proudmoore]] are all at the table. Speak with Varian to turn in and complete the "The Purge of Dalaran" portion of [[Operation: Shieldwall Campaign]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Jaina!  What's happening in Dalaran?  Has there been an attack?}}
:''Varian walks around the table to Jaina.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The Kirin Tor was betrayed from within.  I've handled the situation.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|How?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I've purged the Horde from Dalaran.  You have what you wanted, Your Majesty: The Kirin Tor belongs to the Alliance.}}
:''Varian is confused.''
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|But you said-}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I know what I said.  My trust was misplaced.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|What of the [[Sin'dorei]] - the [[Sunreavers]]?}}
:''Surprisingly, Varian is not happy, but sounds concerned instead.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Those that surrendered are being taken to the [[Violet Hold]].  I make no guarantees about those who chose to fight.}}
:''Varian sounds dismayed and is becoming frustrated.''
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Jaina, you need to talk to me before you act-}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|How I run the Kirin Tor is my business.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|I was trying to negotiate with the Sin'dorei.  I was opening discussions to bring them into the Alliance!  By attacking their people, you've forced their hand-}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They chose their own path.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|You've driven them back to the Horde.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You're fooling yourself.  Once Horde, always Horde.  I see that now.  I'm mobilizing the Kirin Tor.}}
:''Jaina walks down to the center of the floor and opens a portal to Dalaran as Varian looks on, stressing his words.''
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Jaina.  We've got to work together on this.  The Alliance must act as one.}}
:''Jaina turns halfway back to Varian - the equivalent of looking back over her shoulder.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Don't get soft on me, Varian.}}
:''Jaina turns back to her portal and ports out.  Varian goes around the other end of the table to return to his spot.  He and Anduin despawn.''

[[Agent Connelly|Connelly]] also sends a letter via the in-game mail system:
{{book|Dalaran Fallout|content=Great news!

Ah, sure, Garrosh got his hands on the Divine Bell.  But he broke a LOT of eggs to make that omelet!  Proudmoore's gone and kicked the Horde out of the Kirin-Tor.  The mages are on our side, now!

I've been intercepting Horde messages and all hell is breaking loose here.  The Sunreavers blame Garrosh for what happened just as much as they blame Jaina.  Accusations!  Recriminations!  Oh, this is why I became a spy in the first place.
