==Objectives==
Kill 10 Ik'thik Mantid.
*[[Ik'thik]] [[Mantid]] slain (10)

==Description==
The mantid! They came out of nowhere and smashed our convoy to ruin, scattering our people this way and that.

Now they are preparing to hit [[Stoneplow]].

Please, <class>, destroy some of these beasts before they get sufficient numbers to flank our home.

If my cousin, [[Ambassador Len]], is still alive and at our convoy he should be able to reward you for your help.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 399 chestpieces
|Nayeli Robe
|Mortbreath Robes
|Deepwild Armor
|Narsong Chestguard
|Angkhal Robe
|Riverblade Tunic
|Sarjun Chestguard
|Korjan Chestpiece
|Dojani Chestpiece
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It has been many thousands of years since mantid have been seen on this side of the Great Wall.

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <class>! I've never seen anybody stand up to the mantid like that before.

Well, other than the [[Shado-Pan]], of course...

==Notes==

Head due west through the [[Forbidden Jungle]] to find what's left of the [[Shattered Convoy]]. Heavily wounded [[Stoneplow Envoy]]s litter the ground and [[Ik'thik Precursor]]s are swarming the area. [[Ambassador Len]] and [[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin]] are on the road itself—Vaeldin offers [[The Stoneplow Convoy (Alliance)]]. Pick it up before killing too many mantid.
