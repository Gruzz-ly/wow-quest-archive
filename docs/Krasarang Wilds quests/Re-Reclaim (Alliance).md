==Objectives==
Recover 10 Mogu Artifacts.
*[[Mogu Artifact (Re-Reclaim)]] (10)

==Description==
[[Mogu]] do NOT use [[arcane]] magics.

They are thugs. They have always been thugs. Only when they ruled their empires in the old stories did they ever know any kind of magic.

But these mogu are using arcane portals and old artifacts. We need to stop them!

<Name>, look for any artifacts the mogu are using to cast their magics with. I saw piles of these items being collected near the [[Ruins of Korja]] [[Sentinel Basecamp|south of here]].

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Every artifact in our posession is one less weapon in mogu hands.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. You have removed the sword from the child's hands.

==Notes==
Pick up [[No Sister Left Behind]] and [[Sever Their Supply Line]] before heading out.

Just south of the basecamp is a small [[jinyu]] village, [[Fallsong Village]], beset by [[saurok]]. [[Tired Shushen]] offers a couple of quests, [[Thieving Raiders]] and [[Raid Leader Slovan]].

To the southeast is the [[Field of Korja]] and the [[Ruins of Korja]]. [[Korjan Reclaimer|reclaimers]] and [[Korjan Collector|collectors]] are wandering the area, guarding captive NPCs and loot on the ground. Kill reclaimers, free captives, loot the loot, then return to base camp. Back at camp are [[Ambassador Han]] and some [[Wounded Traveller]]s.
