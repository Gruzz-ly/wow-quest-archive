Defeat Julia Bates.
*[[Julia Bates]] defeated {{co|28.9|75.5|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
We welcome all kinds here within the [[Cradle of Chi-Ji|Cradle]], as long as they recognize and subscribe to the ideologies of the [[Chi-Ji|Red Crane]]. One of our new, more exotic trainees comes from the human kingdoms to the northeast. She goes by the rather foreign-sounding name of Julia Bates.

She is your next challenger. You will find her on the island's western shore.

You will receive:
*5x[[Valor Points]] {{cost|24|72|lcgf=2}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Stay strong, <name>.

==Completion==
Another fight handily won. I anxiously await your next match, <name>.

==Notes==
Julia can be found at {{co|28.9|75.5|Krasarang Wilds}} the south end of the western beach of the [[Cradle of Chi-Ji]]. Speak with her:
:Hey there, sweetie. You're lookin' pretty good in all that fancy armor.
:So you've found the way of the Red Crane, too? Interested in a duel?
:{{gossip|Let's fight!}}
:{{text|say|Julia Bates|YAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!}}
She is a human with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Hundred Hand Slap|Quickly strikes target enemy, inflicting 50% weapon damage every .25 secs for 4 secs.|notes=Channeled. Hits for ~5000 on cloth.}}
*{{abilities|Spinning Crane Kick|Spinning kick all nearby enemies, inflicting Physical damage every sec to all enemies within 7 yards for 5 secs.|notes=Channeled.}}
:{{text|say|Julia Bates|Nice moves, sweetie. Maybe I'll see you again...}} (defeat)

As before, some time after turning in, another letter comes via the in-game mail system. Today's letter is from [[Fat Long-Fat]]:
{{book|A Question|content=Greetings, <name>.

This is Fat Long-Fat. We fought a few days ago, atop [[Angkhal Pavilion]].

I have a question for you. You do not need to answer me, but you should seek the answer within your mind. The question is this:

Why do you fight?}}
