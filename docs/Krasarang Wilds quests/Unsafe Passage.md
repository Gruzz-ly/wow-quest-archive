==Objectives==
Help [[Koro Mistwalker]] escort a group of refugees from the [[Temple of the Red Crane]] to [[Crane Wing Refuge]]. Speak with Koro first to begin.
*Accompany Koro to the Refugee Camp

==Description==
As we say at the temple: "Never fight a [[tiger]] with a [[hozen]] on your back."

We will deal with the [[sha]], but first we must see to the more immediate... nuisance.

<Koro slams the writhing [[saurok]] HARD against the stone.>

Groups of refugees from the temple are heading for a camp to the north, but they're being ambushed by sauren. Help me see the next group to the camp and we'll figure out our next move from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. We would not have made it without your help.

==Notes==
Speak with Koro again:
:Are you ready to go? I think we're just about done here...
:{{gossip|I'm ready, Koro.}}
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Alright, lizard lips, one more chance: where are your patrols?!}}
:{{text|say|Riverside Pathstalker|Kthh! You will die in the mud like your friend over there...}}
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Wrong answer.}}
:''Koro kills the [[Riverblade Pathstalker|pathstalker]].''
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|It looks like we're going in blind. I'm glad you're with us, <name>.}}
:''The party starts walking north.''
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Stay close and keep your eyes peeled.}}
:''Later...''
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Hold up... I don't like the looks of this...}}
:''The sky darkens with a volley of arrows headed toward the party, taking out one unlucky refugee.''
:{{text|yell|Koro Mistwalker|Look out!}}
:{{text|yell|Koro Mistwalker|Argh, I'm pinned! Watch yourselves!}}
Two [[Riverblade Bloodletter|bloodletters]] jump down and attack. Kill them.
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Help me up, <name>. I... I took an arrow in the knee...}}
Click on him.
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Thank you. I'll be okay, but we'd better keep moving.}}
:''Later...''
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|More saurok incoming!}}
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Gah! My knee! I'm sorry, <name>, I can't fight like this.}}
Two more bloodletters attack. Dispatch them.
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|The camp is just ahead, we should be able to make it from here.}}
:''The remaining NPCs run to camp.''

The quest completes here. Follow them in. On complete, both Koro and [[Anduin Wrynn]] offer quests.

==Trivia==
* Koro taking an arrow in the knee is likely a reference to ''{{wp|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim}}'', in which guard NPCs will often claim that they used to be an adventurer much like the player until they took an arrow in the knee. The phrase became a popular internet meme and is also referenced in the [[Ask CDev#Ask CDev Answers - Round 4|fourth round of Ask Creative Development]] as well as in [[Captain Washburn]]'s gossip text.
