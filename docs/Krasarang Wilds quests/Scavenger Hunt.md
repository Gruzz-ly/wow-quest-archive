==Objectives==
Use the Goblin Fishing Raft to fish up 15 Rusty Shipwreck Parts out of the floating debris near the shipwrecks.
*[[Rusty Shipwreck Debris]] (15)

==Description==
YOU! You're just who I have been looking for!

I need more parts for my goblin fishing bombs but I hurt my leg and can't collect them myself.

You see those shipwrecks nearby? I bet they have just what I need if you can get to it and fish it out. Take my fishing raft and see what you can find! My buddy has been trying to help me out too so you might find some extra rafts near the wreckage, feel free to use em' too.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|lcgf=1}}
*One point of [[Fishing]] skill
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
Did you find the shipwrecks?

==Completion==
Looks like you found plenty of parts, another set of fishing bombs coming right up! Thanks <name>!

==Notes==
Hop on the raft beside Fiznix and circle around the south side of the western [[Narsong Spires|Narsong Spire]] to find a shipwreck and a large number of debris pools. There's another shipwreck further west closer to [[Nayeli Lagoon]] as well.
