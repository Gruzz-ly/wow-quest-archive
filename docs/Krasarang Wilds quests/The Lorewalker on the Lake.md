*Pick up [[Your Raft|your raft]]

==Description==
[[File:Your Raft.jpg|thumb|Your Raft]]
Your raft is down in the water below. Take it out to the middle of the lake, where you should find a woman. Her name is Ana Wu.

Whenever I have a question that I can't figure out on my own, I'll ask her. She should be able to tell us why these crocolisks won't stop attacking.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You appear troubled, child.

How can this Lorewalker serve you? What is it that you seek?

==Notes==
Hop on to the raft and click on it.
:{{text|say|Max Narstave|That raft is all yours, neighbor. You ever want to go rafting, just come back here. It'll be waiting for you.}}
