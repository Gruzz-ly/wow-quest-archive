# Krasarang Wilds storyline

{{shortcut|kwquest}}
[[File:VZ-Krasarang Wilds.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Krasarang Wilds]] storyline''' runs parallel to the [[Valley of the Four Winds storyline]] during the [[Mists of Pandaria campaign]], starting about three quests in with [[Ken-Ken (quest)]] and [[Kang Bramblestaff (quest)]] acting as breadcrumbs to the zone. {{NPC||Ken-Ken}} is the first quest giver encountered on the road coming out of the [[Valley of the Four Winds]] heading toward [[Zhu's Watch]].

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Mighty Roamin' Krasaranger]].

After reaching the end of both halves of the storyline, adventurers are sent up to [[Stoneplow]] on the west side of [[Valley of the Four Winds]]. Players should complete all of the [[The Search for the Hidden Master]]-started quests (of which Ken-Ken and Kang Bramblestaff are two) to continue the storyline further. After saving Stoneplow (or as soon as adventurers reach level 87), {{NPC||Messenger Grummle}}s at [[Stoneplow]], [[Halfhill]] and the [[Grassy Cline]] bring news from {{NPC||Lorewalker Cho}} in the form of [[The Road to Kun-Lai]], who requests the adventurer's presence atop the [[Kun-Lai Summit]], starting the [[Kun-Lai Summit storyline]].

In [[patch 5.1]]: Landfall, a new series of quests open up on either end of the southern coast. Alliance adventurers start [[Operation: Shieldwall]], setting up [[Lion's Landing]] in the [[Krasarang Cove]], while Horde adventurers call in the [[Dominance Offensive]], constructing [[Domination Point]] on one of the western isles. The progression of 5.1 storyline is tracked in the achievements [[Operation: Shieldwall Campaign]] and [[Dominance Offensive Campaign]]

==Zhu's Watch==
[[File:Zhu Province.jpg|thumb|[[Zhu Province]], with [[Zhu's Watch]] in the background]]
Searching for Ken-Ken, players first find [[Zhu's Watch]]. A strange lethargy has come over almost all of the inhabitants and it is up to Ken-Ken and the adventurer to solve the mystery of what's causing it.

{{Zhu's Watch}}

Mystery solved, Mei sends adventurers forward in [[Into the Wilds]].

==Into the Wilds==
Heading to the southwest from Zhu's Watch, players come across their first faction camp in the zone. From there, both sides run in to {{NPC||Koro Mistwalker}} on the path crossing the [[Krasarang River]] north of the [[Temple of the Red Crane]].

===The Incursion and the Waters of Youth===
[[File:Incursion.jpg|thumb|An Arcanic Oubliette has trapped the [[Incursion]]]]
Night elf [[Sentinels]] have found themselves trapped at the [[Incursion]]. After dropping the shield and freeing the trapped night elves, the [[Pools of Youth]] prove too tempting a target, so adventurers get sent out to clean out the [[Ruins of Dojan]] and bring a sample of the youthful water back for testing.

{{Trapped at the Incursion}}

Fed up that the Pools of Purity aren't going to make the night elves immortal again, {{NPC||Lyalia}} orders adventurers onward to the [[Sentinel Basecamp]] in [[Going on the Offensive]].

===Thunder Cleft===

After discovering the secret of the [[Pools of Youth]], adventurers are sent toward their second camps further in the zone. Before they can get there, though, they run across {{NPC||Koro Mistwalker}} north of the [[Temple of the Red Crane]]. The [[sha]] have come out in force and the [[saurok]] are causing problems too. Help Koro escort a group of evacuees to the [[Crane Wing Refuge]], but not before he takes an arrow to the knee, then help clear out the temple.

==Taking on the mogu==

The temple cleaner for the moment, keep heading to the second faction base. The [[mogu]] are pushing hard from the [[Ruins of Korja]] and the [[Sentinels]] and [[Sunwalkers]] could use some time and space to lick their wounds. After discovering [[pandaren]] captured alongside members of Alliance and Horde, the pandaren from [[Stoneplow]] mention that the [[mantid]] shattered their convoy. While helping save pandaren near the border with the [[Valley of the Four Winds]], Kor and Lyalia both get themselves captured by {{NPC||Groundbreaker Brojai}}, the leader of the invading mogu forces. Brojai is slain, but not before he kills Kor and Lyalia.

===Sentinel Basecamp===
