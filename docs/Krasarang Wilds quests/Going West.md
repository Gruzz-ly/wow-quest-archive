Find the Sunwalker Scout near the Crane Temple.
*[[Sunwalker Scout's Report]]

==Description==
Leza now walks with the ancestors of this strange land. I must look now to the living.

Kor has led a group of our scouts west deeper into the jungle.

I sent a scout of my own to investigate the crane temple. Please, <name>, seek out my scout, get their report, then meet up with Kor and lend what aid you can to him.

We will join you as quickly as we are able.
