==Description==
You are making a name for yourself, <name>. I received a challenge from one of our more skilled competitors. He believes you are not as strong as you seem.

His name is Tukka-Tuk, the [[hozen]]. If you've ever fought against hozen before, you know that their battle acumen belies their apparent juvenility. Good luck.

Tukka-Tuk awaits, <name>.

==Completion==
Well done, as usual.

I trust we will see you again soon.
