== Objectives ==
Recover water from the [[Pools of Youth]].
* [[The Water of Youth]]

== Description ==
The [[mogu]] found the Pools of Youth!

Mama Bramblestaff used to tell me old stories about those. During the [[mogu empire]] they would use the waters to extend life.

Thing is those stories never ended well for some reason. As if the waters were cursed.

Either way, we should investigate. There is a good chance those waters might help [[Leza]].

It looks like the Pools of Youth are on the northwestern side of the ruins.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Drape of the Lagoon 	
|Waterfall Drape
|Canopy Drape
|Greenback Cape
|Balmy Drape}}
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
Leza's pain is immense. Only powers beyond my own can save her and the baby now.

== Completion ==
At this point I am willing to try anything. This land is claiming my wife and unborn child. I need all the help I can get.

==Notes==
;Speaking with [[Na Lek]]
