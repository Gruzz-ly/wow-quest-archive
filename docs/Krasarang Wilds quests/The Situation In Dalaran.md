==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kromthar]] to obtain a ride to [[Dalaran]].
*Obtain ride to Dalaran

==Description==
The [[Night elf|night elves]] learned that the [[:Divine Bell]] was stolen. This much we anticipated.

However, they've also found out that the "neutral" [[Sunreavers]] of [[Dalaran]] were complicit. Now, we've got a situation.

I need you to go to Dalaran. Speak with Kromthar for a ride. You are to rendezvous with [[Grand Magister Rommath]] once you arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|88|50}}
*177000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Completion==
Good... you've arrived. It's not a good day to be Horde in Dalaran.

Jaina's called for the exile of all the Sunreavers. You and I are going to save as many as we can - including [[Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]] himself - and then get out of here as fast as possible.

{{Dialogue-child|
You think I know where Dalaran is, buddy? I can't even find my own tail! Sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't.

You know what I heard though, <name>?

Dook's got real since last time.

I heard you went to Darnassus and got the Divine Bell.

But some human lady... Jana or somethin'... she got real mad!

She says the Horde betrayed her trust or something'... and she's kickin' all your people out of her city!

Orc general Nazgrim say we need to help them vacuum... vacuate... err... evocate... err... get the ook out!
