== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Korjani Reclaimers.
*[[Korjan Reclaimer]] slain x8

== Description ==
I apologize for my harsh words earlier. [[Dezco]] might have been right to wait and move west with a unified strength.

The [[mogu]] hit us hard when we were searching the ruins west of here. They ambushed us using summoning portals and some dark magics. I haven't seen such evil sorcery used since [[Outland]].

We need a respite. Head west, kill their summoners, cut their supply line.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|10|20}}

== Progress ==
Did you break their reinforcements?

== Completion ==
With their reinforcements severed we can begin to mount an offensive against their Lord Reclaimer.

==Progression==
{{Dawnchaser Retreat}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
