== Objectives ==
Recover the Dojani Orders.
* [[Dojani Orders]]

== Description ==
[[Mogu]] don't often gather in numbers like this. We should find out what they are up to.

I thought I heard someone shouting orders near the center of the ruins.

We should probably see if he has information.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
The mogu once ruled as emperors, subjugating all races they encountered.

It would seem these particular mogu have aspirations of reliving the past.

== Completion ==
Wait. This document talks about the [[Pools of Youth]]!

The pools exist?!
