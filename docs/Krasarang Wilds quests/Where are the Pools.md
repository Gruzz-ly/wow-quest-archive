==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lorekeeper Vaeldrin.jpg|Lorekeeper Vaeldrin|The priest's mind touches yours.}}
Obtain the Dojani Orders.
*[[Dojani Orders]] {{co|55.5|34.5|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
Perhaps these [[mogu]] know where [[Pools of Youth|the pools]] are.

Our scouts have reported seeing [[Dojani Dominator|a commander]] along the southern side of the [[Ruins of Dojan]].

Kill him and take whatever information he is carrying.  They should lead you to the pool.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<You sense the presence of [[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin]], then hear his voice within your mind.>

Hmm. I'm still not sure about these references to "torture" regarding the Pools of Youth.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Hmm, it looks like the mogu are here to collect ancient relics and weapons from their forgotten dynasty. That is a problem we can face later, though.

Ah! Here is a reference to the Pools of Youth.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Threat from Dojan (Alliance)]] and [[Lotus Tea]] before heading out. Follow the road south and west, cross the [[Dojani River]], then keep going west when the road turns north to reach the [[Ruins of Dojan]].

[[Imperial Lotus]] is all over the grounds and gathered 2-4 at a time. As are the [[Dojani Surveyor]]s and [[Dojani Reclaimer]]s. Feel free to turn in Lotus Tea as soon as the 20th set of leaves are gathered - Kang will not leave the player. Up at the higher level of the ruins is the Dojani Dominator, a level 86 mogu with 368,000 health. Kill him to loot the Dojani Orders from him. He is shared-tap, so don't worry about having to get the only tap if the area is busy. Where are the Pools is remote-completable, so finish the quest in the ruins and pick up [[The Pools of Youth (Alliance)]]. See that article for more.
