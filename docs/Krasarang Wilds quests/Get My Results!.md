==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lor'themar Theron]] in [[Silvermoon City]].

==Description==
Ah, <name>. [[Garrosh Hellscream|The Warchief]] has instructed me to dispatch you to Silvermoon.

He grows impatient with the progress of Lor'themar's research and feels they might benefit from your... unique... experiences with the [[mogu]].

Go to Silvermoon and demand that Lor'themar increase the speed of his research.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]
*+75 reputation with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
The Warchief "demands" progress? His impatience is growing more destructive with each command.

As it stands, we could use your expertise. 

==Notes==
It is possible to ask [[Tak-Tak]] for a ride:
:{{Gossip|Take me to Silvermoon City.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|I ain't flyin' a kite to Silvermoon City! You crazy?}}
