==Objectives==
Kill 18 [[Haunt of Despair|Haunts of Despair]] at the [[Temple of the Red Crane]].
*Sha manifestations slain (18)

==Description==
Now as for that "striking the rain" part... well, sometimes you have to.

"Hope is the sun behind a stormy sky - ever in the heart, but veiled to the eye."

There seems to be no end to the [[sha]] pouring out of the temple. But in order to see beyond the veil of despair, you must carve through it.

With any luck, you'll find a sun behind the clouds...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We shouldn't press further into the temple before clearing out some of the sha presence outside.

==Completion==
You know something, <name>? We make a pretty good team!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ahead on the Way]] and [[Sha Can Awe]] before heading out.

After picking up all three, Anduin will join the adventurer's party, adding a buff: Aura of Hope - "Fortified by Anduin Wrynn. When you defeat a sha creature at the Temple of the Red Crane, you regain a portion of your health and mana, and inspire nearby Hopeless defenders. The more powerful the sha vanquished, the greater the magnitude of these effects.

Head down to the temple and get started killing sha, making sure to kite them close to defenders before actually finishing them off, but don't focus on the killing yet. Valid units include [[Haunt of Despair]], [[Incarnation of Despair]], and [[Source of Despair]]. On either side of the temple are two very large pagodas with a [[Maw of Despair (sha)|Maw of Despair]], a sha with 644,000 health. Kill all along the way down there, mindful of the location of the hopeless pandaren on the sha's death. The maw of despair will channel Wail of Despair - interrupt it quickly to limit the number of [[Ripple of Despair]] spawns. Kill around to the other side of the temple and cleanse the other pagoda. By this point, all three quests should be done.
