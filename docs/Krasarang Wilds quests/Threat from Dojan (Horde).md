== Objectives ==
Kill 6 Dojani Reclaimers and 8 Dojani Surveyors, and 4 Dojani Enforcers.
* [[Dojani Surveyor]] slain (8)
* [[Dojani Reclaimer]] slain (6)
* [[Dojani Enforcer]] slain (4)

== Description ==
[[Mogu]]? They seem like the elves, ancient and an over developed sense of entitlement. Everyone of [[Azeroth]] must learn, sooner or later, that the Horde is not "visiting" this world. We are here. We are staying.

Teach them this lesson. Quell their numbers in the ruins south and west of here. Break their amassing forces before they decide to attack.

Learn what you can of how these creatures fight, and how they die.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
You found how many? Sounds like a veritable nest of the vile creatures. If they were more civilized I might consider extending them an invitation to join the Horde.

== Completion ==
These are more than just a bandit threat. They are an ancient people beginning to rally under a single banner. Mark my words, soon these lands will know war.

== Notes ==
On accepting:
