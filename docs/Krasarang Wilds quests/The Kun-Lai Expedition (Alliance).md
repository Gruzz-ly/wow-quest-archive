==Objectives==
Find [[Agent Connelly|Connelly]] at the [[Grummle Bazaar]]. Speak to [[Fennie Hornswaggle]] at [[Lion's Landing]] for transportation.
*Find Connelly at the Grummle Bazaar

==Description==
Glory to the Alliance, <class>. We are making gains against the Horde in the [[Krasarang Wilds]], albeit slowly.

While we hold the front here, we need your help to fight a different battle - one that strikes at our enemy's heart.

Our [[SI:7]] informant, Agent Connelly, has sent word that a Horde vanguard is moving up into the northern reaches of [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

Go without delay. Make contact with Agent Connelly in the field, and find out what is going on.

Speak to Fennie over there for a flight in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
<You do a doubletake when the Pandaren suddenly speaks with Connelly's voice.>

'Bout time, laddie!  I've been waitin' fer ya to show up.

These Pandaren are good people but can't mix a martini fer nothin'.

==Notes==
Speak with Hilda once again for some more story along the way.
:{{gossip|Take me to Garrosh'ar Advance.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Howdy. How are ye today?}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|After I dropped ye off last time, I heard there was some kind of sha infectin' our soldiers at the Shrine of Seven Stars.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|If ye and Prince Anduin hadn't been there, we could all be turnin' on each other, lettin' our anger get the best o' us!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I also heard that King Varian swore he would never use the sha to no good.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Maybe Varian ain't such a sour grape after all! Good ta see our King show some heart.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Anyway, Agent Connelly sent me word to bring ya to him in Kun-Lai Summit.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Sounds like the Horde are close to finding the location o' that Divine Bell, and that ain't no good.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|You'd better meet up with him in the field and see what Garrosh is up to.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Good luck!}}

Fennie drops the adventurer off at the [[Grummle Bazaar]] in eastern Kun-Lai Summit, roughly 10 yards in front of Agent Connelly, who has taken the form of a pandaren.
