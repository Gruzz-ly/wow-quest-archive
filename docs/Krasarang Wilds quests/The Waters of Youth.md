==Objectives==
Give [[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin|Vaeldrin]]'s message to [[Lyalia]].
*Observe Vaeldrin's ritual

==Description==
She is headstrong, my little Lyalia. I should have known she would try to challenge the [[Groundbreaker Brojai|Lord Reclaimer]].

Since her mother died I forsake much of the time I should have spent with her in search of immortality, insisting that we could live forever, together.

And now my obsession has cost my little Lyalia her life.

Please, <name>, when she wakes, tell her I love her.
