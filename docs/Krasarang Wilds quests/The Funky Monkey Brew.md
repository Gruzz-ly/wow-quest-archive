==Objectives==
Defeat Captain Ook.
*[[Captain Ook]] slain

==Description==
[[Pirate]]s! Our shores have been scoured by the most ill-tempered, ill-mannered, ill-hygienic, and ill-good [[hozen]] that ever was found in [[Pandaria]]. And to make matters worse, they claim to serve the legendary Captain Ook!

We see them every night partying and brewing punch on their island [[Unga Ingoo]].

I say we take their brew for a change! I think I can even improve their mix.

Gather up some friends and meet me on the southern side of Unga Ingoo. It is time for a Brew Run!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72||}}
*294,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These hozen pack some mean toys and some meaner brews.

==Completion==
A fine punch! A fine punch indeed! The sort of punch that punches back. Well done, <class>!

==Patch changes==
