Accompany [[Varian Wrynn|King Varian Wrynn]] to find Marshal Troteman, Hilda Hornswaggle, and slay 25 Horde.
*Horde slain (25)
*[[Marshal Troteman]] found {{co|79.9|25.1|Krasarang Wilds}}
*[[Hilda Hornswaggle]] found {{co|80.4|17.5|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
There's no time to waste, we need to find Troteman and secure the beach.

We should check on the dwarves, too - the [[Explorer's League]] is tough, but they're no army. They should be along the cliff just north of here.

Let us ride, <class>. For our friends. For the [[Alliance]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Progress==
The Alliance will be a shield, protecting Pandaria from the Horde.

==Completion==
I'm satisified with this site, it's time to bring in our fleet.

==Notes==
On accept, Varian joins the party. A boss-level NPC with 590 million health, he flies the Banner of King Varian Wrynn, increasing health, healing and absorption effects, and damage dealt by 25%. Slaying members of the Horde will trigger King Varian Wrynn to release a warcry, restoring 20% of total health and mana.

Head northwest along the beach and start killing [[Horde Raider (Krasarang Wilds)|Horde Raiders]], [[Horde Priest]]s, and [[Horde Hunter]]s past the roots.

West along the beach is [[Marshal Troteman]] and a few [[7th Legion Scout (Krasarang Wilds)|7th Legion Scouts]]. On approach:
:{{text|yell|Marshal Troteman|Brace yourselves, they're coming back around!}}
:''A squad of Horde troops swarm Troteman and his scouts.''

Help fend them off. When Troteman's out of combat:
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Troteman, you old dog, I knew I'd find you stirring up trouble.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|The survey team has done well. This is an ideal deep-water port.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|I want to see a tower built right here.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Marshal, see to it that you hold this position until construction is complete.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Now, let's see to our supplies...}}

Hornswaggle and her team of Explorers' League Surveyors are fending off more Horde troops at the northern end of the cove in front of a small cave called [[Seaspittle Nook]].
:{{text|yell|Hilda Hornswaggle|Heads up, more Horde!}}

Help clear out the troops:
:{{text|say|Hilda Hornswaggle|Explorer's League reporting in, sir!}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|I'm glad to see you contribute to the war effort. But I need supplies. What have you got?}}
:{{text|say|Hilda Hornswaggle|Plenty of stone, aye. But no sign of major ore veins in this whole area.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|I'll take it. Anything else?}}
:{{text|say|Hilda Hornswaggle|Somethun' even BETTER. History! Artifacts from an ancient an' powerful race!}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|I'll make a deal with you, Hornswaggle. Help my men get a stone quarry running, and we'll protect your dig site.}}
:{{text|say|Hilda Hornswaggle|You mean it? Oh, I cannae WAIT to see the look on [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]]'s face when he finds out I got an excavation green-lit by the King himself! You'll have your quarry by next sundown!}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Hm. I used to think leadership was all about strength. I see things more clearly now - it's a little bit of give, a little bit of take. It's about binding people together. A bundle of sticks is not easily broken.}}
Once the quota of kills is met, speak to Varian again to turn in.
