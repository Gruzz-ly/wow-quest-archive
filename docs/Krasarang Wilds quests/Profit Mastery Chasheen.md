==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Chasheen.jpg|Chasheen|Queen of the Deepwild}}
Collect Ancient Tiger's Blood.
*[[Ancient Tiger's Blood]] {{co|61.7|32.3|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
I am totally on to another great scam!

When I was flying overhead I saw a really ancient tigress prowling about.

Do you know how much her blood would go for on the black market? Not to mention if I convince some [[warlock]]s it adds extra potency to their summoning spells or something.

If you bring me back some of her blood I will cut you in on the scam. She was prowling about on the far side of the [[Dojani River]] from here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*111000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I thought about taking that tiger on myself but to be honest I like living...

==Completion==
Impressive! Can you smell the money? Here's your end.

==Notes==
Head to the southwest part of the [[Dojani River]] road loop to find Chasheen's den just east of the [[Dojani Ruins]]. {{NPC||Chasheen}} is a level 87 tiger with 430,000 health and the following special abilities:
*{{abilities|Pounce|range=10|Inflicts normal damage and stuns an enemy.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~5700 on cloth. Stuns for ~3 seconds.}}
