==Objectives==
[[File:Ellia Ravenmane.jpg|thumb|[[Ellia Ravenmane]].]]
Defeat Ellia Ravenmane near the base of the [[Pedestal of Hope]].
*[[Ellia Ravenmane]] defeated

==Description==
Ellia Ravenmane requested a rematch with you. She seems to identify you as her "rival".

We discourage rivalries here within the [[Cradle of Chi-Ji]], but we rarely decline a rematch request. You will find Ellia near the Pedestal of Hope, on the island's eastern side.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|lcgf=2}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Good luck, <name>.

==Completion==
Twice fought, twice defeated. It stands to reason that Ellia will not be requesting more rematches anytime soon.

==Notes==
To the southeast side of the island. Ellia's standing at the base of the steps. Speak with her again:
:I've been training really hard! There's no way you can defeat me now, <name>.
:{{gossip|Let's fight!}}
:{{text|say|Ellia Ravenmane|Today is the day I defeat my rival!}}
She has the following ability:
*{{abilities|Fierce Jab|Jab target enemy, inflicting 120% weapon damage.|range=Melee|notes=Instant. Hits for ~10,000-12,700 Physical on cloth.}}
Finish her off:
:{{text|say|Ellia Ravenmane|I lost to <name>, twice in a row? I can't believe it.}}

Some time after completing the quest, [[Thelonius]] sends a letter to the player via the in-game mail system:
{{Book|The Fine Line Between Hope and Despair|content=
Before your match today, Ellia Ravenmane swelled with hope and pride. After your victory, she lost a lot of that hope.

Your lesson for today is that hope can turn into despair in a heartbeat. Ellia is learning this lesson the hard way.}}
