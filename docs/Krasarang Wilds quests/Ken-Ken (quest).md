==Objectives==
Find [[Ken-Ken]].

==Description==
So... Ken-Ken. The [[hozen]].

Personally, I'm impressed he's progressed so far in his training. He's got a brain between his ears, which is more than can be said for most of his kind.

He said he was headed east, but, seeing as we're already on the far east side of [[Valley of the Four Winds|the valley]], I can't imagine he went too far from here. Look for him at [[Zhu's Watch]], in [[Krasarang Wilds]], down the path to the south. See what he's found.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||94}}
*6940 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This place... it... it so SAD!

Ken-Ken never seen a place so sad.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Clever Ashyo (quest)]], [[Kang Bramblestaff (quest)]], and [[Lin Tenderpaw (quest)]] before heading out. These quests will not be quickly completed, as they all lead to other zones, so focus instead on the quests around [[Pang's Stead]] with [[Low Turnip Turnout]].

Ken-Ken can be found at [[Zhu's Watch]] in the [[Krasarang Wilds]]. His gossip text:
:Ken-Ken meet a few pandaren in his time. He tell you something: they NOT sads.
:Now, look at this place! Sad, mopey-dopeys sulking around everywhere.
:Where's song and dance? Where's piles of food?
:Where's BOOZE, man?!
