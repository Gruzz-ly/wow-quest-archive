:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Watch the might of the [[Horde]] in action. As we change this sand of land into DOMINATION POINT.}} (The audio still says, "Watch the might of the [[Horde]] in action. As we turn this slab of land into DOMINATION POINT."

:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Do you see, champion? There is little my Horde cannot accomplish. What is this?}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Vol'jin. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be on your [[Echo Isles|island]] kissing frogs?}}
:{{text|say|[[Vol'jin]]|The question is, what are WE doin' here? Yeh bring 'dis war to anudder corner of [[Azeroth]], and I wanna know why.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Your lack of vision is why your people are still primitives, and your lack of loyalty is why I did not summon the [[Darkspear]] for this campaign.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Look around you, Vol'jin. This land is rich in resources: wood, stone, iron, fuel. And people.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|A show of might on these shores will make the [[pandaren]] think twice about joining the [[Alliance]].}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|All dis bloodshed make everyone tink twice 'bout joinin' da Horde.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|This is the difference between me and you, Vol'jin. I won't let [[Orc|MY people]] starve to death in the [[Durotar|desert]]. I will stop at nothing - NOTHING - to ensure a proud and glorious future for the orcs and anyone with the courage to stand with us. Wait here.}}
:{{Text|emote|Garrosh Hellscream and Rak'gor Bloodrazor exchange hushed words.}}
''Garrosh walks up to Blood Guard Gro'tash to know what's going on with preparations. For now, he gives Vol'jin a quest...''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|There is something you can do, troll, to demonstrate your value to the Horde. A mission in the heart of this continent.}}
