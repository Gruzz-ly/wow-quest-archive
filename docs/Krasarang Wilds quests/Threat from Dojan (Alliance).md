==Objectives==
Kill 6 Dojani Reclaimers, 8 Dojani Surveyors, and 4 Dojani Enforcers.
*[[Dojani Reclaimer]] slain (6)
*[[Dojani Surveyor]] slain (8)
*[[Dojani Enforcer]] slain (4)

==Description==
While you were at [[Krasari Ruins|the ruins]] dusting off tablets for [[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin|my father]] I lost five scouts to wandering [[mogu]] patrols.

These creatures apparently have little interest in peace and are about as trustworthy as the [[Horde]].

They are too numerous and we are too weak, however.

Go to the ruins west of here and cull the mogu numbers. They won't be expecting a <class>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 399 necklaces
|Bramble Locket
|Bramble Choker
|Bramble Necklace
|Bramble Pendant
|Bramble Amulet}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[Kang Bramblestaff|Kang]] has been sharing stories with me about these mogu.

Apprently ages ago they ruled as emperors subjugating all free races of [[Pandaria]] and the surrounding regions. Now they are little more than hoodlums.

To see these mogu fight, though, I suspect they are trying to rekindle some of their older ideals and ambitions.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Another few missions like that and we might have to make you an honorary Sentinel.

==Notes==

[[File:Dojani Reclaimer.jpg|thumb|Dojani Reclaimer]]

Pick up [[Where are the Pools]] and [[Lotus Tea]] before heading out. Follow the road south and west, cross the [[Dojani River]], then keep going west when the road turns north to reach the [[Ruins of Dojan]].

[[Imperial Lotus]] is all over the grounds and gathered 2-4 at a time. As are the [[Dojani Surveyor]]s and [[Dojani Reclaimer]]s. Feel free to turn in Lotus Tea as soon as the 20th set of leaves are gathered - Kang will not leave the player. Up at the higher level of the ruins is the Dojani Dominator. Kill him to loot the Dojani Orders from him. He is shared-tap, so don't worry about having to get the only tap if the area is busy. Where are the Pools is remote-completable, so finish the quest in the ruins and pick up [[The Pools of Youth (Alliance)]].

Just to the northwest of the dominator's position is a bridge. Cross it to reach the [[Pools of Youth]], where [[Na Lek]] is frozen in the middle of the pool. Speak with him:
:<Na Lek smiles at you, and you feel young as though you have not felt in years.>
:{{gossip|Attempt to free Na Lek from his prison.}}
:{{text|yell|Groundbreaker Brojai|Halt, supplicant! These waters belong to the Thunder King. Your presence is unwelcome.}}
:{{text|yell|Groundkeeper Brojai|Guardians! Kill these intruders.}}
A [[Sleeping Guardian]], a [[quilen]], awakens and has the following ability:
*{{abilities|Petrifying Strike|Inflict 110% weapon damage and petrify the target reducing movement speed and haste by 10% for 10 sec.|notes=Instant. Stacks.}}
However, players will not have to fight all by themselves, as Na Lek channels a healing aura that heals for 3583 health a tick.

On victory:
:{{text|emote|Na Lek embues <name> with gratitude and returns to the waters of the pool.}}
:{{text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|Look at that. The little guy left you some purified water.}}
Loot one of the water pools, jump down to the lower road, and return to the Incursion.
