'''Hope Springs Eternal''' is a breadcrumb quest to the finale of [[Stoneplow]]. It can be accepted when the Stoneplow questline and the quests from [[Lin Tenderpaw]], [[Clever Ashyo]], [[Kang Bramblestaff]], and [[Ken-Ken]] have been completed, but [[Warn Stoneplow]] or other breadcrumbs have not been accepted.

==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Loon Mai}} in [[Stoneplow]].

==Description==
The [[Shado-Pan]] are likely dealing with similar outbreaks elsewhere in [[Pandaria]].

Seek out Loon Mai, the Shado-Pan Watch Commander in Stoneplow on the western end of the [[Valley of the Four Winds]]. Let him know that we have the situation here under control; the Shado-Pan need not send any aid.

Quite the opposite, in fact - I will be sending many of my followers on pilgrimage, to bring a message of hope to those in need.

Thank you again, <name>. Farewell.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Finally, some good news. I will send a [[falcon]] to [[Winter's Blossom]] right away and let them know the [[Temple of the Red Crane]] is safe.

Between the sha outbreak and the increasing aggression of the [[mantid]], our forces are being stretched thin.

==Notes==
Either take a flight path, or head west to reach [[Dustback Gorge]] then turn north to travel past [[Nesingwary's Safari]] and through the [[Stoneplow Fields]] to reach [[Stoneplow]]. Speak with {{NPC||Watch Commander Loon Mai}}, near the village's eastern end (in front of the [[Stone Mug Tavern]]) to turn in.

If players have not completed all of the other portions (ending with [[The Golden Dream]], [[Warn Stoneplow]], and [[Training and Discipline]]), Loon Mai will say:
:{{text|say|Watch Commander Loon Mai|You have been an asset to Stoneplow, <name>. We may call upon you again in the future. Until then, you should speak with our flight master. He will take you wherever you need to go... free of charge.}}
Feel free to take a flight elsewhere and finish whatever quests need to be done.
