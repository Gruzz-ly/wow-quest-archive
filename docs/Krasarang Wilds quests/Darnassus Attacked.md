== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] in [[Darnassus]].

You may speak with [[Seamus Goldenkicks]] in [[Lion's Landing]] to be ported to Darnassus.

== Description ==
As you know, our [[night elf|night elven]] allies moved the [[:Divine Bell]] you retrieved to Darnassus for safekeeping and study.  Moments ago, they portaled some [[Highborne|Highbourne]]{{sic}} mages over here to ask for backup.  Details are hazy - some sort of stealth attack on the city?

I don't know what to make of it, but Jaina Proudmoore is already on the scene and I suspect they need all the help they can get.

Speak to Seamus Goldenkicks over there for a quick portal to Darnassus.  Find Jaina!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
* 118000 XP
* +100 reputation with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

== Completion ==
The Bell is gone...

At the scene of the crime, we found traces of arcane magic... I may be able to use my skills to find the thieves.

== Notes ==
Taylor will offer this quest at 9250/21000 {{rep|revered}} with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]. Head over to [[Seamus Goldenkicks]] and speak with him.  This will trigger an immediate teleport rather than a summoned portal.
:What're ye lookin' at?  Is it m'shoes?
:{{gossip|I need a portal to Darnassus.}}

If you happen to automatically go to [[Fennie Hornswaggle]] to ask for a ride...
:{{gossip|Take me to Darnassus.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I ain't flyin' no kite to Darnassus! I can barely navigate that thing in the mountains. Ye think we'd last over an entire ocean? Ye'd best talk to Seamus Goldenkicks over there.}}

Players may wind up in the {{expac|Battle for Azeroth}} phase of [[Darkshore]] instead. If this happens, speak to [[Zidormi]] to switch to the correct phase, then fly to Darnassus.

In the [[Temple of the Moon]], run north to get outside and mount up, then keep heading north to find Jaina at the [[Cenarion Enclave]]. On getting close to Jaina:
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|No, no, no! The Bell!}}
