==Objectives==
Accompany [[Garrosh Hellscream]] to find Blood Guard Gro'tash, Grizzle Gearslip, and slay 25 Alliance.
*Alliance slain  (25)
*[[Blood Guard Gro'tash]] found
*[[Grizzle Gearslip]] found

==Description==
Come, <class>! I want to inspect this island and ensure that my landing team has done their job.

Blood Guard Gro'tash should be somewhere on the northern side of the island looking for a suitable place to build our keep. The goblin survey team will have gone up the eastern coast in search of oil.

Let us crush this pitiful display and claim this land for the Horde!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|85|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]
*+250 reputation with [[Horde]]

==Progress==
Gorehowl thirsts for Alliance blood.

==Completion==
Well done. Our presence here will not be denied!

==Notes==
On accept, Garrosh joins the party. A boss-level NPC with 590 million health, he flies the Banner of Garrosh Hellscream, increasing health, healing and absorption effects, and damage dealt by 25%. Slaying members of the Alliance will trigger Garrosh Hellscream to release a warcry, restoring 20% of total health and mana.

When reaching to Blood Guard Gro'tash, when you kill Alliance ambush Garrosh comments on the fight and moves on:
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|A pitiful skirmish! The Alliance fights without conviction.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Hold this ground, Blood Guard. Here is where we will build our keep. Expect peons within the hour, and be ready to motivate them.}}

When you reach Grizzle Gearslip, he commands him to do as follows:
:{{text|say|Grizzle Gearslip|I never thought the Warchief himself would come to bail me out!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|I didn't come to save your sorry hide, goblin. Did you find fuel or not?}}
:{{text|say|Grizzle Gearslip|Y-yes sir! We struck it big. There's crude all along the coast. We'll get an operation going right away, your hugeness!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|I know you will. I'm sending in grunts to make sure of it.}}
