==Description==
[[Saurok]]!

These vile creatures are obsessed with killing and stealing. They attacked [[Fallsong Village|our settlement]] without provocation or warning.

Please, <class>, can you aid us?

Help us recover our lost possessions from these Riverblade raiders that march along the river and we will gladly reward you.

You will also receive:

==Progress==
I think they even stole my holy spittoon.

==Completion==
Not many would stop to help a village in need... especially so deep in the wilds.

You are a champion to our people, <name>.

Pick up [[Raid Leader Slovan]] before heading out. Slovan is to the north and the loot is held by [[Riverblade Slayer]]s to the south.
