==Objectives==
Use Imperial Lotus Poultice on 7 Stoneplow Envoys.
*[[Stoneplow Envoy]] Saved (7)
*[[Imperial Lotus Poultice]] (provided)

==Description==
Help me, <name>. These poor pandaren are in need of healing, and my powers are weakened.

I did find an old tome in my collection that allowed me to convert [[Imperial Lotus Leaves|the herbs]] you [[Lotus Tea|collected earlier]] into a healing poultice.

Use this on the injured pandaren and it should get them back on their feet.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|item level 399 cloaks|Imperial Lotus Shawl|Imperial Lotus Drape|Imperial Lotus Cape|Imperial Lotus Manteau|Imperial Lotus Cloak}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These mantid are a much bigger threat than I think even the pandaren give them credit for.

==Completion==
It has been a long time since I rolled up my sleeves and helped the needy. In my lust for immortality I forgot why I became a priest.

Thank you for reminding me there is good in this world worth fighting for, <name>.

==Notes==
While looking for the [[Shattered Convoy]] in the [[Forbidden Jungle]] for [[The Mantid (Alliance)]], [[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin]] offers this quest. While killing mantid, use the poltice on wounded envoys littered over the area.
