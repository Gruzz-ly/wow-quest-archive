==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Fat Long-Fat.jpg|Fat Long-Fat|The enigmatic warrior returns.}}
Defeat Fat Long-Fat atop [[Dome Balrissa]].
*[[Fat Long-Fat]] defeated {{co|34.8|82.6|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
Fat Long-Fat has requested another match with you. I find this strange. And concerning.

He will be waiting atop the Dome Belrissa.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|lcgf=2}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
I wonder what he needs you for...

==Completion==
I believe I understand why he wanted to fight you a second time, though I need to speak with [[Chi-Ji]] before I can be sure.

Come back soon, <name>. I think it is time you learned the true nature of Fat Long-Fat.

==Notes==
Down to the southern tip of the island. Again, atop the building, not in it. Speak with him:
:It is me again. It is good to see you, <name>. Shall we begin?
:{{gossip|Let's fight!}}
:{{text|say|Fat Long-Fat|Give me everything you have, <name>.}}
Long-Fat is still a pandaren but with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Blackout Kick|Kick target enemy, inflicting Physical damage.|notes=Hits for ~3000 Physical on cloth.}}
*{{abilities|Storm Stout|Drinks the famous Storm Stout, increasing all damage dealt by 35% and inflicting Nature damage to attackers.|notes=Instant. Self-buff. Stellstealable. 6-sec duration.}}
*{{abilities|Fat Long-Flop|range=Melee|Inflicts Physical damage and stuns the target for 3 sec.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~15,000 Physical.}}
The hard part of the fight for those who like to kite is the small size of the area. Don't fall off the platform or he will evade and reset!

Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Fat Long-Fat|Yes... yes, I believe you will do. I will see you again shortly, <name>.}}
:''Fat Long-Fat jumps off the building to the northeast, fading into the trees.''

Thelonius sends today's letter:
{{book|Fat Long-Fat|content=[[Fat Long-Fat]] is not what he seems. He is testing you. He is testing both of us, actually.

Your next duel will be against me. The victor will perform a special task for the [[Chi-Ji|Red Crane]] himself.

I haven't fought in ages. I suppose I'd better start limbering up. See you on the battlefield, <name>.}}

==Progression==
