==Objectives==
Find [[Brann Bronzebeard]] at [[Mogujia]]. Speak to [[Fennie Hornswaggle]] at [[Lion's Landing]] for transportation.
*Find Brann Bronzebeard

==Description==
The [[Explorers' League]] sent an expedition north some days ago.

We haven't heard from them since, and I'd sleep better at night knowing our folks aren't in some sort of trouble.

Last I heard, Brann Bronzebeard was heading toward Mogujia in the [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

Find him and report back with their status. Fennie over there can give you a ride if you need one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
These artifacts must be several thousand years old. Have ye ever seen the like?

==Notes==
:{{gossip|''Take me to Mogujia.''}}
Speak with Fennie for more story along the way:
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Well, we meet again.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I trust that ye're well and good?}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Have ye yeard all the buzz that's been going 'round Lion's Landing?}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I heard that the Horde's learned of an ancient mogu artifact... somethin' called the Divine Bell.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|That bell's capable of turning a normal army into killin' machines!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|No one knows where the artifact was hidden, but the Horde's doing anything they can ta get their hands on it first.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|The [[Reliquary]] is hot on the trail o' that bell at Mogujia.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I'll be a snot-nosed ninny if we don't beat 'em to the punch!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I can't do much since I'm just Hilda's assistant, but ye can.  I hope ye can find out what they're up to.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Here we are.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Go wreck those Horde!}}

Fennie drops players off just outside of [[Mogujia]], where elite [[Sentinel Striker]]s and [[Shieldwall Explorer]]s are camped out. [[Brann Bronzebeard]] and [[Hilda Hornswaggle]] are looking at a [[quilen]] statue, while [[Silent Tosi]] and [[Penni Whitepetal]] are further northeast, offering repairs and food and drink, respectively. Turn in to Brann. Hilda and [[Sarannha Skyglaive]], next to Tosi and Penni, offer followups.
