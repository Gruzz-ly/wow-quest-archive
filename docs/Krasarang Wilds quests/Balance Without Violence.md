==Objectives==
Throw 6 Flailing Carp into [[Nayeli Lagoon]].
*Throw [[Flailing Carp]] back into the water (6)

==Description==
Some of the fish that the Unga hozen have gathered don't seem do be dead yet. There may still be time to throw them back into the water.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*129000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The grateful fish swim happily toward the safety of the middle of the lagoon.

With any luck, they will be eaten by [[crocolisk]]s.

==Notes==
This quest is automatically offered when walking near any of the large fish piles on the beach of [[Unga Ingoo]]. Near big fish piles are small fish flopping about. Interact with a small fish to throw it back in. Additionally, one of the hozen will drop the [[Confusing Treasure Map]], which starts [[Buried Hozen Treasure (quest)]]. The "buried treasure" can be found all over the beach in Lumps of Sand. Buried by {{NPC||Unga Treasure-Hider}}s, one of the sand piles may actually have something other than an [[Empty Barrel]] or a [[Banana Peel]]...
