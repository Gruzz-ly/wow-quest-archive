[[File:Great Grey Shark.jpg|thumb|[[Great Grey Shark]].]]
Obtain 5 Shark Fillets.
*[[Shark Fillet]] (5)

==Description==
[[File:Nayeli Hammerhead.jpg|thumb|[[Nayeli Hammerhead]].]]
<[[Wise Ana Wu|Ana]] listens to your story, and nods.>

[[Crocolisk]]s attacking? I know a story about that. And I will share it with you, but first... I grow hungry.

Shark meat should do the trick. You should find enough sharks in the [[Nayeli Lagoon|water beneath us]].

*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My hunger is great, <race>. I have been on this lagoon for several days, without food.

==Completion==
You've brought me more meat than I could ever hope to eat.

Now, I suppose I owe you a story.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|Allow me to make your underwater experience a little more... pleasant.}}
:''Ana buffs players with Water Gliding: Increases swim speed by 50%. Also allows underwater breathing.''
Pick up [[Misery (quest)]] before heading out. Then swim straight down and start killing sharks. Near the bottom is the mouth of the [[Mortbreath Grotto]], where [[Nahassa]] can be found inside. At full health he has 1.7 million health, but since he is so near death, he only has 429,000 health left. The quest finishes automatically once he dies, so feel free to turn it in.

On complete, Wise Ana Wu tells a story:
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|This is the tale of the Hungry Crocolisk.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|The crocolisks of the [[Narsong Trench]] ate fish. They were fat and happy.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|And then the sharks came.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|The sharks competed for the fish, but the crocolisks survived.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|Soon after, the pandaren arrived.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|The pandaren fished in the trench's waters, but the crocolisks survived.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|Finally, the hozen came to Narsong Trench.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|The hozen overfished the area, catching more fish than they could eat.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|With no fish to eat, the crocolisks became hungry and desperate. They attacked the pandaren out of sheer hunger.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|The pandaren, in fear and defense, killed all the crocolisks of Narsong Trench.}}
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|The Narsong crocolisk is no more... simply because the pandaren didn't see the whole story.}}
