==Objectives==
Observe Vaeldrin as he tests the water of youth.
*Observe [[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin]]'s Ritual

==Description==
Something is... off. The water feels strange.

When we arrived [[Incursion|here]] I felt the presence of the [[Light]], strong and vibrant, far to the north.

I thought it would be the [[Pools of Youth]]. But this... this water is tainted somehow. Stained with [[mogu]] magics.

I think it best I try only a sip and we see what happens.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Wha... what happened? The water... it... it only transfers life. It will not make new life.

==Notes==
On accept:

:''A red beam flies from Vaeldin to the adventurer, giving him or her a 2% increase to stamina for 15 minutes while in the zone.''
:{{text|say|Lyalia|Father! Are you okay?}}
:{{text|say|Lorekeeper Vaeldrin|That... hurt.}}
Lyalia offers the next quest.

This completes "The Incursion" portion of [[Mighty Roamin' Krasaranger]]
