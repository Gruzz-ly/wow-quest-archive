==Objectives==
Use the [[Flare Launcher]] in [[Krasarang Cove]] to signal the [[Alliance]] fleet.

==Description==
For too long the [[Horde]] has been allowed to run rampant across [[Azeroth]]. I will not see these new lands conquered by some barbaric "warchief."

Are you ready to bring Alliance justice to the shores of [[Pandaria]]?

Let us return to the landing site. Use the flare launcher to bring in the fleet proper, and begin [[Operation: Shieldwall]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
<Blue sails are barely visible on the horizon - the full might of the Alliance fleet, awaiting one final signal.>

==Notes==
Head back southeast. On approaching the landing site:
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Everything is in place. We'll construct a town center on this peninsula, using resources from along the coast.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|From here we can reach out to the natives and keep Horde aggression in check.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Champion! Without your pioneering efforts on Pandaria, this foothold wouldn't have been possible.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|The honor is yours. Signal the fleet.}}
Interact with the Flare Launcher to complete the quest.

This completes the Lion's Landing portion of [[Operation: Shieldwall Campaign]], and triggers a cutscene, showing Alliance troops coming ashore. On the other side of the cutscene, adventurers regain control at a hastily-built [[Lion's Landing]].

:{{text|yell|Anduin Wrynn|Father!}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|What-?}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Anduin... you're safe...}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Father, you can't do this. All the hatred and anger our war brings here - it poisons this place.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Easy, son. We're fighting a different war now. This isn't about hatred of the Horde. This is about a love of what's right. About doing what needs to be done.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|This land is - different than ours. It's a treasure.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Then we'll protect it with our lives. Son, I need you with me on this. We in this together?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Together...}}
:''Hilda Hornswaggle rides up on her ram.''
:{{text|yell|Hilda Hornswaggle|Yer Majesty! The Horde, they've holed up in a temple west of here. Night elf [[Elven ranger|rangers]] have surrounded it and locked it down...}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Rangers? ...Tyrande.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Father! You can't let them turn the [[Temple of the Red Crane|Crane Temple]] into a war zone! That place is still recovering from [[In the House of the Red Crane|a sha infestation]]...}}
:{{text|say|Hilda Hornswaggle|AND it's a historical treasure trove.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Everyone, calm down. This sounds like one of Garrosh's traps. He's trying to lure us from the beach. Troteman? Round me up some peasants and a mortar team, and don't let down your guard.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But father-}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|I'll bring a small group of champions with me and talk to Tyrande myself. Anduin, I can handle this. I need you to trust that I'm going to do the right thing here.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|... I trust you, father.}}
