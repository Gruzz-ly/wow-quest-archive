==Objectives==
Slay 10 Unga Fish-Getters.
*[[Unga Fish-Getter]] slain (10)

==Description==
[[File:Unga Fish-Getter.jpg|thumb|[[Unga Fish-Getter]].]]
The story did not end happily. The Narsong [[crocolisk]] is no more.

This time, however, you may have a chance to change the ending.

The [[hozen]] to the south are overfishing these waters. With the fish gone, the crocolisks are hungry and desperate - and so they attack [[Marista]].

Go now, <race>! Stop those hozen from their reckless fishing!

==Rewards==

You will also receive:

*161000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did Ana have any clue what was going on?

==Completion==
<Jay listens to your account of the day's events.>

I see. We'll keep an eye on the Ungas from here. And we'll do our best not to fish these waters too heavily, either. No doubt we're part of the problem, too.

Until next time, <name>.

==Notes==
Head south across the lagoon to reach [[Unga Ingoo]]. Start killing fish-getters. Additionally, a one of the hozen will drop the [[Confusing Treasure Map]], which starts [[Buried Hozen Treasure (quest)]]. Also, walk up close to one of the fish piles to start [[Balance Without Violence]] automatically. Near big fish piles are small fish flopping about. Interact with a small fish to throw it back in. The "buried treasure" can be found all over the beach in Lumps of Sand. Buried by [[Unga Treasure-Hider]]s, one of the sand piles may actually have something other than an [[Empty Barrel]] or a [[Banana Peel]]...

This completes the "Nayeli Lagoon" portion of [[Mighty Roamin' Krasaranger]].
