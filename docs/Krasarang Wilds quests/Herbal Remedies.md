==Objectives==
Find 20 Imperial Lotus Leaves.
* [[Imperial Lotus Leaves]] (20)

==Description==
Kang's remedy isn't working.

There is something else at work here. A power deep beneath the soil. It is sapping us of hope, hitting us with depression and despair.

[[Kang Bramblestaff|Kang]] tells me this land has lotus plants. I might be able to make a tea that would hopefully lend [[Leza]] some strength.

Please, <name>, search the ruins south and west of here for lotus leaves. I will pay you for your efforts.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}
|q=5|Lotus Water}}

==Progress==
I've been punched, stabbed, thrown off of a cliff, hit in the face by someone's mace, hit in the face by my own mace, and fell off the elevator at [[Thunder Bluff]] on more than one occasion.

None of that pain sounds even half as bad as what Leza is going through. I hope this tea helps...

==Completion==
Thank you hero. [[Kor Bloodtusk|Kor]] is a brave warrior but he lacks compassion at times. Life must come before death, or there will be none of us left when the fighting is done.
