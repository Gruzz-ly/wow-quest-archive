==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Slovan.jpg|Raid Leader Slovan|The terror of the falls.}}
Kill Slovan.
*[[Slovan]] slain {{co|31.7|29.0|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
The raiders are led by a particularly violent saurok known as Slovan. The [[Temple of the Red Crane|Crane Temple]] usually comes to our aid when he attacks but now we find ourselves outmatched and outmanuevered.

Please, <class>, aid us by destroying this raid leader.

You can find him in [[Riverblade Den|his den]] behind the [[Krasari Falls]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]
*[[Shushen's Spittoon]]

==Progress==
Slovan has always been a nuisance, but with the [[Temple of the Red Crane|Crane Temple's]] defenses down he has become a true threat.

==Completion==
You have done us a great service today. On behalf of my people I thank you.

Please, accept this token of our gratitude.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Thieving Raiders]] before heading out. Slovan is to the north and the loot is held by [[Riverblade Slayer]]s to the south.
