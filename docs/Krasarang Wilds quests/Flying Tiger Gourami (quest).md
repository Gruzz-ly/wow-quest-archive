==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Nat Pagle at Anglers Wharf.jpg|Nat Pagle|Maybe Nat would know more about this rare catch?}}
Bring the Flying Tiger Gourami to [[Nat Pagle]] at [[Anglers Wharf]].
*[[Flying Tiger Gourami]] (provided)

==Description==
You've caught a unique fish... with wings.  Perhaps it deserves the expert opinion of Nat Pagle in Anglers Wharf.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|lcgf=1}}
*+600 [[reputation]] with [[Nat Pagle]]
*+350 reputation with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
Flying fish?

==Completion==
Is that a flying tiger gourami?

This little fish is a rare mutation of the tiger gourami that can fly, and are consequently caught in any freshwater here in Pandaria.

Local legend states that good luck comes to the person who eats it, and local tradition states that only royalty can eat them.  To be caught breaking this "tradition" is a death sentence.

With that in mind, I'll make sure it gets to the right person.

==Notes==
While it is possible to catch a second one of these fish after turning in the daily quest, it cannot be turned in again that day. It can be kept to be turned in after the daily quest resets the next morning.
