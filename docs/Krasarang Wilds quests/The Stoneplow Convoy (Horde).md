==Objectives==
Use Imperial Lotus Poultice on 7 Stoneplow Envoys.
*[[Stoneplow Envoy]] saved x7
*[[Imperial Lotus Poultice]] (provided)

==Description==
I tried to save as many of the [[Stoneplow]] envoys as I could but these "[[mantid]]" dragged many of them off into the jungle.

These are civilians in need of our help.

Please take the herbs you gathered earlier. I've infused them with what gifts of the [[Light]] are still granted me. Use them on as many of the Stoneplow envoys as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|10|20}}

==Progress==
A [[sunwalker]]'s first duty is to preserve and protect life.

==Completion==
The civilians are trickling in thanks to you. These "mantid" creatures are a serious threat. We will need to rally our forces soon to help.

One of the envoys asked me to give this to you as a token of thanks.

==Progression==
{{Dawnchaser Retreat}}
