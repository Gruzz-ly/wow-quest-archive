==Objectives==
Look for Yi-Mo Longbrow somewhere northeast of [[Zhu's Watch]].
*Find [[Yi-Mo Longbrow]]

==Description==
My nephew, Yi-Mo, has always been sort of a downer. When this wave of despair hit the town, he took it harder than most. He sat around for days refusing to eat, just staring off into the horizon.

Now he's wandered off toward the cliffs northeast of here, where the thunderbirds nest and hunt.

Please, <class>, will you look for him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*83000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Yi-Mo lets out a long sigh.>

==Completion==
Let me guess: my aunt sent you?

==Notes and trivia==
On [[What's Eating Zhu's Watch?]], adventurers talk to the only sane pandaren in town, [[Mei Barrelbottom]], who offers this quest. Pick it up and head east to find him.

The quest title is a reference to ''{{wplink|Finding Nemo}}''.
