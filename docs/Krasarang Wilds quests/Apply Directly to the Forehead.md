*[[Despondent Warden of Zhu|Despondent Wardens of Zhu]] Cured (8)
*[[Ken-Ken's Mask (Apply Directly to the Forehead)]] (provided)

==Description==
Well... THAT was unexpected!

Come to think of it, now [[Ken-Ken]] remember why [[hozen]] use mask in the first place...

A legend about [[Monkey King]] says he used a mask to cure old pandaren emperor, [[Shaohao]], when he was too sad to lead his people.  Then they buried mask--with all his sadness--in the ground.

We should use the mask on more pandaren, but instead of putting sad away in ground, we gonna PUNCH ITS BUTT.

Let's do this, <name>!

==Completion==
We saving pandaren, but the land still sad... Look, rain's not stopping at all!

<Ken-Ken shakes his tiny fists at the sky.>

How many more butts we gotta punch before we fix this town?!
