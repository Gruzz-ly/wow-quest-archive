==Objectives==
Kill the Sunwalker Scout.
*[[Sunwalker Scout]] slain {{co|65|25|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
Horde [[sunwalkers]]! We saw one of their scouts patrolling by the oubliette not long before you arrived.

I don't know how they got here but I can guarantee you he isn't alone. They never are.

Kill the sunwalker scout before he reports our position.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the [[tauren]] scout? Our presence must be kept a secret. The Horde can NOT know we are here.

==Completion==
Sunwalkers are not to be trusted. They are the most militant branch of the tauren armies within the Horde.

Thank you for your help in this, <name>. Please accept this token as a reward.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Lost Dynasty (quest)]] and [[Squirmy Delight (quest)]] before heading out.

Swing to the northwest to reach the [[Dojani River]] and start killing water striders. The scout paths along the east-west road from [[Thunder Cleft]] to the [[Krasari Ruins]]. He is a level 86 [[Sunwalkers]] (paladin) tauren with 368,000 health. Stay well clear of the road unless actively trying to engage him. More skitterers can be found in the pool north of the tauren camp. Once enough glands have been gathered, swing back to the west to reach the Krasari Ruins. Tablet fragments litter the ground. The mogu have a very wide aggro radius (compared to other at-level mobs), so be a bit more aggressive about clearing a path through the ruins.
