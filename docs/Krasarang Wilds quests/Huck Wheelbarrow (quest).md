==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Huck Wheelbarrow.jpg|Huck Wheelbarrow|An immigrant from the farmlands, to the north.}}
Defeat Huck Wheelbarrow.
*[[Huck Wheelbarrow]] defeated {{co|27.9|70.3|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
Usually our trainees are adventurers like yourself, or monks from [[Tian Monastery]], or occasionally retired [[Shado-Pan]]. Very rarely, though, we will greet trainees that have no fighting experience whatsoever.

Huck Wheelbarrow is one such trainee. He has requested a duel with you. Look for him on the island's western shore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|lcgf=2}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Go to Huck now, <name>.

==Completion==
There remains only one trainee ranked higher than you.

I have a feeling that you will be facing him when you return.

==Notes==
Swing around to the southwest side of the island on the beach to find Huck:
:Howdy, neighbor.
:I heard a lot about you. You been winnin' duels all over this here island. I suppose I'm ready to give you a shot.
:{{gossip|Let's fight!}}
:{{text|say|Huck Wheelbarrow|Don't rule me out be just 'cause I'm a country boy! I got freakish strong arms, you know.}}
Huck is a pandaren with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Wheel Punch|range=Melee|Inflicts 120% weapon damage.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~13,000 Physical on cloth.}}
*{{abilities|Wheelbarrow Roll|range=40|Rapidly spins, dealing Physical damage every 0.20 sec to target enemy and increases movement speed by 300%.|notes=Instant Hits for ~2000-2500 Physical on cloth.}}
Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Huck WHeelbarrow|Nice moves. You keep reapin' in those wins like grain, <name>. I'll be rootin' for you.}}

[[Thelonius]] sends today's post-match letter:
{{book|Your "Rival"|content=I am concerned about [[Ellia Ravenmane]]. She has not appeared for her training in several days. I fear she has crossed that narrow threshold from hope into despair.

If you see her, let me know.
