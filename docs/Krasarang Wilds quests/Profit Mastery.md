==Objectives==
Obtain 12 Vials of Tiger Blood.
*[[Vial of Tiger Blood]] (12)

==Description==
Two words: Tiger Blood!

This is gonna sell better than [[saronite]] back on the black market. Especially once I finish spreading a rumor about how it makes you all buff and stuff.

Thing is, I ran out of ammo. Can you round up a few vials of tiger blood for me? I'll cut you in on the scam.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I like hunting with Nesingwary and all but he's in it for the hunting. I'm in it for the profit, and he doesn't pay us.

==Completion==
Great! This stuff is gonna make me a mint back in [[Kalimdor]]. Here's your cut.

==Notes==
On the way from [[Zhu's Watch]] to the [[Temple of the Red Crane]] for [[Into the Wilds]], adventurers reach a fork in the road just south of the [[Krasari Ruins]], where Daggle can be found standing next to her rocket surrounded by dead [[Krasari Huntress]]es. Pick up this quest and [[Crane Mastery]], then go killing cranes and tigers.

On complete:
