== Objectives ==
Gather 5 Intact Skitterer Glands.
* [[Intact Skitterer Glands]] (5)

== Description ==
[[Leza Dawnchaser|Leza]] has a fever. No mother in labor should have a fever.

[[Mama Bramblestaff]] once told me that Skitterer Stew could heal almost any illness. Let us put this knowledge to the test.

Gather some intact skitterer glands for me while I get the herbs we'll need and I'll whip up a batch.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
Even the jungle air is alive with danger.

== Completion ==
Excellent! Nothing clears a sickness like Skitterer Stew.

Here, take this. It's a little memento of Mama Bramblestaff.
