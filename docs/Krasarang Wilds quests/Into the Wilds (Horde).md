==Objectives==
Locate the missing Zhu's Watch Courier in the northern area of the [[Dojani River]], then continue on to the [[Temple of the Red Crane]] and speak with [[Koro Mistwalker]].
*[[Zhu's Watch Courier]] Found

==Description==
Deep in the wilds, on the southern coast where the [[Krasarang River]] meets the sea, rests the Temple of the Red Crane, home of the great [[Chi-Ji]] and his most devout followers.

They should be told of what happened here.

If you're headed that way, I have a favor to ask; We often send supplies to the temple, but our last courier has not returned. Please look for signs of him as you travel - where the road forks at the Dojani River, he'd have gone north. When you reach the temple, find Koro Mistwalker.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Supplies from the watch?  Great!  We'll need them at the camp...

But... Mei never sends a <class>... where's the usual courier?

==Completion==
I see... And the [[sha]] have seeped out as far as [[Zhu Province|the province]] already, have they?

Well, I hate to break it to you, but the temple is also overrun with sha. Those of us who haven't been killed or... possessed, or whatever, are fleeing for our very lives.

If you have defeated the sha at [[Zhu's Watch]], I have to implore you to help us deal with them here.
