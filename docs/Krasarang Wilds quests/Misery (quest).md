==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Nahassa.jpg|Nahassa|Even a great beast deserves mercy.}}
Put Nahassa out his misery.
*Put [[Nahassa]] out of his misery

==Description==
While you are in the water below, you should slay Nahassa, the mortbreath patriarch. He suffers. I can feel his death cries ululating up to the surface of the lagoon.

Find his cave, and put him out of his misery. Not because it will solve [[Marista|Marista's]] [[crocolisk]] problem. Simply out of mercy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*193000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please, <name>. Even the great beasts of this world have a right to die in dignity.

==Completion==
Nahassa's fevered suffering has come to an end.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Wise Ana Wu|Allow me to make your underwater experience a little more... pleasant.}}
:''Ana buffs players with Water Gliding: Increases swim speed by 50%. Also allows underwater breathing.''
Pick up [[Wisdom Has A Price]] before heading out. Then swim straight down and start killing sharks. Near the bottom is the mouth of the [[Mortbreath Grotto]], where [[Nahassa]] can be found inside. At full health he has 1.7 million health, but since he is so near death, he only has 429,000 health left. The quest finishes automatically once he dies, so feel free to turn it in.
