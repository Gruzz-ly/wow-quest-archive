==Description==
Okay, so that not work. Well... it cheer [[Ken-Ken]] up! But [[pandaren]] still sad...

We try another old [[hozen]] remedy - this time, we go back even further than gramma, way WAY back to ancient times. Hozen still do this sometimes... mostly at parties.

Ken-Ken got woodworking to do - you bring him teeth! Not yours; big ones, like a panther would have!

Oh, and some paint! [[Mei Barrelbottom|Mei]] might know where to find.

==Progress==
<Ken-Ken is hard at work carving something out of tree bark.>

This is gonna be great, you'll see.

==Completion==
Just in time! All done... look!

<Ken-Ken holds up a carved wooden mask with a ridiculous face.>

Now we put on finishing touches and we gots a guaranteed FUN MACHINE!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Securing the Province]] and [[Borderlands (quest)]] from Mei, then speak with her again:
:{{gossip|''This may be a strange request, but... do you have any ink or paint?''}}

:[[Saurok]] take any opportunity to plunder, and with our Wardens out of commission, they've been running nightly raids on our supplies.

:They take anything they can carry and sort through it back at their lair.

:Crafting supplies and pigments are just some of the things they're sure to be sitting on.

Head northwest into the cave and get started killing saurok. In the back of the cave is the [[Jar of Pigment]], probably guarded by a Herbalist. Loot it, then get out of the cave, heading toward the southwest to reach the panther area. [[Krasari Stalker]]s drop several fangs at a time. The three fires are on the border between the cleared area and the mostly-untouched wilds.
