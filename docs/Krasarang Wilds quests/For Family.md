Kor should have caught up by now. He said he was going to secure the [[Ruins of Korja]] east of here and meet us to help with the mantid threat.

He may need help against Groundbreaker Brojai. Could you assist him? [[Kang Bramblestaff|Kang]] and I will follow shortly.

==Progress==
This land claims so much.

==Completion==
I thank you for avenging my friend, <name>. We did not always see eye to eye, but I will mourn him.

==Notes==
[[File:The Lord Reclaimer - setup.jpg|thumb|The setup]]
Back down to the southwest to the southern end of the [[Ruins of Korja]]. Kor Bloodtusk and [[Lyalia]] are trapped in a net. Speak with Kor:
:These... mogu... are tougher than I gave them credit for. And clever. You shouldn't have come, this is a trap.
:{{gossip|<Try to free Kor Bloodtusk from his bonds.>}}
:''Brojai teleports in.''
:{{text|say|Groundkeeper Brojai|You fail to bend the knee to our power? Then die like the vermin you are.}}
:''Brojai smites Kor and Lyalia, killing both.''
:{{text|yell|Sunwalker Dezco|KOR! NOOOOOOO!}}
:{{text|yell|Lorekeeper Vaeldrin|LYALIA! NOOOOOOOO!}}
The fight begins. [[Sunwalker Dezco]], [[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin]] and [[Kang Bramblestaff]] will help fight Brojai. Every now and then Brojai will stop what he's doing and channel Revive Guardian on one of the statues to activate it.
:{{text|bossemote|Groundbreaker Brojai is reviving a Ruined Guardian.}}
:{{text|yell|Groundkeeper Brojai|Guardian! Awaken and defend your master!}}
The [[Ruined Guardian]] has 107,000 health, so quickly take it out then go back to Brojai.

On victory:
:''Dezco and Vaeldrin walk up to the corpses of Kor and Lyalia and stare each other down.''
:{{text|say|Lorekeeper Vaeldin|What now, Sunwalker?}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|I think we have both lost enough today, old elf. See to your dead.}}
:{{text|say|Lorekeeper Vaeldin|Agreed.}}
:''Dezco kneels down to Kor's body.''
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|Kor, why did you do this? Vengeance is not worth dying over.}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|<Name>, meet me at the [[Dawnchaser Retreat]]. I must see to my brother's remains, and then we must deal with this mantid threat.}}
:''The five NPCs despawn.''
Head back to the retreat to turn in.
