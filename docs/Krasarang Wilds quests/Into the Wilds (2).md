==Objectives==
Locate [[Koro Mistwalker]] near the [[Temple of the Red Crane]] at the southern end of [[Krasarang River]].

==Description==
Deep in the wilds rests the Temple of the Red Crane, home of the great Chi-Ji and his most devout followers. I suspect they'll know something about what happened here.

The temple is located on the southern coast of the wilds, where the Krasarang River meets the sea.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80||}}
Upon completion of this quest you will also gain:
*111,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see... So the sha have seeped out as far as the province already, have they?

Well, I hate to break it to you, but the temple is also overrun with sha. Those of us who haven't been killed or... possessed, or whatever, are fleeing for our very lives.

If you defeated the sha at Zhu's Bastion, I have to implore you to help us deal with them here.
