*Find Lor'themar Theron at Mogujia

==Description==
Throm-ka, <class>. While we were busy defending our foothold here, Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron led a research expedition north into [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

Unfortunately, it seems they have encountered trouble.

[[Warchief Garrosh Hellscream]] has already departed to lend his assistance, but he will require additional reinforcements.

Go northward into the mountains of Kun-Lai. Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Completion==
Well met, <class>. We are an archaeological expedition, sent to excavate these ruins. We had no idea that this area was crawling with dangerous mogu. 

==Notes==
[[Tak-Tak]] offers a ride on [[Tak-Tak's Kite|his kite]]:
:{{Gossip|Take me to Mogujia.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Headin' back up to Kun-Lai Summit, wikket?}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Last time we met, you were headin' to Binan Village to see your pandaren friend.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Did you get your business done?}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Anyway, I saw some more pretty elves headin' north earlier. Lots of elves.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|They're lookin' for [[Divine Bell|that bell]]. Big, powerful bell! You lookin' for it too, wikket?}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Here we are. See ya!}}

When adventurers approach [[Lor'themar Theron]] and [[Garrosh Hellscream]], they have the following conversation:
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|You gave us no warning about the mogu, Warchief. These statues came to life!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Was I wrong to assume your Blood Elves could handle themselves?}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|We could have, had we been given any warning. You threw my people to the wolves.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Your weakness is not my failing, Regent. My Horde has room only for those strong enough to stand within it.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Do not question my loyalty, Warchief. We came across an ocean to fight for you.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Yes, and with your help, we will pry the secrets from this land. For the glory of the Horde!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|If I must pay with some elven blood, then so be it.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Take care, Garrosh. You would destroy the Horde to create your perfect future.}}
