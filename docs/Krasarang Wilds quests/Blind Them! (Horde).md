== Objectives ==
Kill the Darnassian Outrider.
* [[Darnassian Outrider]] slain

== Description ==
These [[sunwalkers]] are a tiresome lot. I need soldiers with horde blood in their veins and honor in their hearts. Not some pacifist sun spirit filth.

The Alliance are here, <name>. Followed us no doubt, or somehow tracked the same visions [[Leza]] had that led us here. It doesn't matter. I don't want them to know how divided we are at the moment. Go kill their scout south of here before it can report back.

[[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]'s eyes upon you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress == 
Sentinels. Bah! I remember a time when these creatures were the terror of the trees, hunting any orc or tauren that dared enter their wood in search of food or shelter.

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>. You have performed admirably and bought us some time to fortify our defenses. Now if I can just get Dezco to go on the offensive.

== Notes ==
On completion:
:{{text|say|Kor Bloodtusk|[[Sunwalker Dezco|Dezco]], we should keep pressing westward. We are vulnerable here.}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|Not while [[Leza Dawnchaser|Leza]] is in labor. We must wait.}}
:{{text|say|Kor Bloodtusk|I appreciate that your wife led us here, old friend, but she chose a poor time to have a child.}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|What part of our journey gave you the impression of choice?}}

==Progression==
{{Thunder Cleft}}
