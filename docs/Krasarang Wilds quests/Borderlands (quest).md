==Objectives==
[[File:Memorial Flame lit.jpg|thumb|Flame lit.]]
Light the Memorial Flame of Zhu, Memorial Flame of Rin, and Memorial Flame of Po along the southwest border of Zhu Province.
* Memorial Flame of Zhu {{co|72.7|18.1|Krasarang Wilds}}
* Memorial Flame of Po {{co|75.2|17.1|Krasarang Wilds}}
* Memorial Flame of Rin {{co|71.3|17.5|Krasarang Wilds}}
*[[Flame of Zhu's Watch]] (provided)

==Description==
Bonfires are surprisingly effective at discouraging beasts from wandering out of the wilds. We have three along the border to the southwest which we normally keep lit at all times.

Nobody's been there for days, though, and the fires must be out by now. It's only a matter of time before the wilds creep back in and overtake the land we have kept safe for centuries.

Please, re-ignite the bonfires. They are critical in keeping the province safe, and they are memorials to the founders of our way of life.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
* 110000 XP

==Progress==
Zhu warned against the dangers of trying to conquer the wilds, and asked only that we contain them.

The bonfires honor his wishes and his spirit.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

Zhu Province serves as a corridor from the upper tier of the valley down to the sea.

Keeping the province safe requires daily efforts to maintain a border against the savage Krasarang Wilds.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Why So Serious?]] and [[Securing the Province]] before heading out.

Head northwest into the cave and get started killing saurok. In the back of the cave is the [[Jar of Pigment]], probably guarded by a Herbalist. Loot it, then get out of the cave, heading toward the southwest to reach the panther area. They drop several fangs at a time. The three fires are on the border between the cleared area and the mostly-untouched wilds.
