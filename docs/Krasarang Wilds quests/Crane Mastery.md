==Objectives==
Kill 12 Carp Hunters.
*[[Carp Hunter]] slain (12)

==Description==
Thing about hunting birds is you need ammo - and I ain't got any. Thing about hunting with [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]] is you need to prove you can keep your tally and bragging rights up.

Can't hunt, can't brag. And I like bragging so this is no good.

Can I hire you to go kill me some carp hunters? You'll find them up and down the river west of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
As far as I'm concerned, paying you to kill these birds is the same as me shooting them myself. You just get to be my gun as it were.

==Completion==
Fantastic. Only thing that would make this hunting trip more entertaining is a chair. Here is the reward I promised you.

==Notes==
On the way from [[Zhu's Watch]] to the [[Temple of the Red Crane]] for [[Into the Wilds]], adventurers reach a fork in the road just south of the [[Krasari Ruins]], where Daggle can be found standing next to her rocket surrounded by dead [[Krasari Huntress]]es. Pick up this quest and [[Profit Mastery]], then go killing cranes and tigers.
