==Objectives==
[[File:Emerald Lory.jpg|thumb|[[Emerald Lory]].]]
Obtain 6 Emerald Tailfeathers, 6 Crimson Tailfeathers, and 6 Dusky Tailfeathers.
*[[Emerald Tailfeather]] (6)
*[[Crimson Tailfeather]] (6)
*[[Dusky Tailfeather]] (6)

==Description==
[[File:Crimson Lory.jpg|thumb|[[Crimson Lory]].]]
When the crocs started attacking, they scared a bunch of the lories out of their nests, up in that island to our northwest.

I can use those lories' feathers to make some specialized lures, which will come in handy if and when I get to stop defending my brethren from these reptiles.

You up for some feather hunting?

==Rewards==

*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<A bead of sweat twinkles in the fur above Tony's brow.>

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>. You've made my day. I always hate to see such a prime feather-gathering opportunity go to waste.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sudden, Unexpected Crocolisk Aggression]] before heading out. Note that the [[Desperate Mortbreath]]s do ''not'' count for Crocolisk Aggression.

Cross to the northwest to [[Kea Krak]] and start killing [[Crimson Lory|crimson]], [[Dusky Lory|dusky]], and [[Emerald Lory|emerald]] lories and [[Mortbreath Skulker|skulkers]] and [[Mortbreath Snapper|snappers]]. Feathers drop up to four at a time.
