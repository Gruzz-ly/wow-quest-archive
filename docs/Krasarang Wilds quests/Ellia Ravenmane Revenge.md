==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ellia Ravenmane.jpg|Ellia Ravenmane|Ellia has returned, and she's determined to defeat her rival.}}
Defeat Ellia Ravenmane at [[Dome Balrissa]].
*[[Ellia Ravenmane]] defeated {{co|34.5|83.3|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
Your "rival" has appeared again. Ellia Ravenmane has been avoiding her duities on [[Cradle of Chi-Ji|the island]], instead focusing on personal training, with the intent to defeat you in battle.

"I will destroy <name>," she said.

I have honored her request for a rematch, but I will be keeping a close eye on her. Her motives may be shifting in a dangerous direction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|lcgf=2}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Fight with skill, <name>.

==Completion==
I will consult directly with [[Chi-Ji]] about Ellia's behavior. She treads on thin ice.

==Notes==
Head down south to the southernmost building, [[Dome Balrissa]]. Ellia is on the southern side of the platform. Speak with her:
:Hello, rival.
:I've been busy training.
:I hope you've done the same.
:{{gossip|Let's fight!}}
:{{text|say|Ellia Ravenmane|Just give up! It's hopeless! You'll never beat me!}}
She again has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Fierce Jab|range=Melee|Jab target enemy, inflicting 120% weapon damage.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~10,000 Physical}}
*{{abilities|Fists of Fury|range=10|Furiously punch tarrget enemy, inflicting Physical damage every 1 sec for 4 sec.|notes=Channeled. Hits for ~6800-7900 Physical}}
*{{abilities|Vicious Kick|Kick target enemy, inflicting Physical damage.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~16,000 Physical.}}
Finish her off:
:{{text|say|Ellia Ravenmane|How did... I don't... no, no NO! NOT AGAIN!}}

The letter this time comes from [[Tukka-Tuk]]:
{{book|Cradle of Chi-Ji Letter|content=Tukka-Tuk heard people saying you strong.

Tukka-Tuk watched you fight. Three of your fights, you just beat up [[Ellia Ravenmane|little girl]]. Not very strong, Tukka-Tuk thinks.

Tukka-Tuk challenge you, <name>!}}
