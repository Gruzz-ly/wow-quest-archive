==Objectives==
Gather 5 Intact Skitterer Glands.
*[[Intact Skitterer Glands]] (5)

==Description==
The hidden master may have to wait. Look at these people, <name>.

They are so THIN! They must be starving.

You know what we need? A big steaming bowl of Squirmy Delight.

If you find yourself near a river, try rounding up some intact skitterer glands and I'll cook up a batch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10x[[Squirmy Delight]]
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Mama Bramblestaff always said Squirmy Delight will cure any hunger one way or another.

==Completion==
Ha! With this I can make a stew potent enough to knock these waifish elves on their feet.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Lost Dynasty (quest)]] and [[Blind Them! (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Swing to the northwest to reach the [[Dojani River]] and start killing [[Jungle Skitterer]]s. The scout paths along the east-west road from [[Thunder Cleft]] to the [[Krasari Ruins]]. He is a level 86 [[Sunwalkers]] (paladin) tauren with 368,000 health. Stay well clear of the road unless actively trying to engage him. More skitterers can be found in the pool north of the tauren camp. Once enough glands have been gathered, swing back to the west to reach the Krasari Ruins. Tablet fragments litter the ground. The mogu have a very wide aggro radius (compared to other at-level mobs), so be a bit more aggressive about clearing a path through the ruins.
