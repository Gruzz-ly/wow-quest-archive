I sent a diplomat to look for allies in the ruins east of here.

My diplomat has not returned and now [[Kang Bramblestaff|Kang]] tells me this jungle is filled with a sinister people known as the mogu.

Chezin is my friend and [[Leza Dawnchaser|Leza]]'s brother. To lose a brother would cause her to give in to despair. She already has enough to worry about with her fever.
