Obtain 4 Spare Planks and some Tough Kelp.
*[[Spare Plank]] (4) {{co|52.4|76.1|Krasarang Wilds}}
*[[Tough Kelp]] {{co|52.2|77.9|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
[[File:Tough Kelp.jpg|thumb|Tough Kelp]]
<{{NPC||Jay Cloudfall||Jay}} looks off in the direction of [[Kea Krak]].>

Hmm. They don't seem to be... calming down. We're going to have to try something different.

You'll need a raft. Go grab some wood planks and seaweed, and bring them over to me. I'll put something together for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*32000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got the stuff? I'll build your raft, I just need materials.

==Completion==
<Jay deftly weaves the planks together into a surprisingly seaworthy-looking vessel, then tosses them down into water below.>

==Notes==
Plenty of [[Spare Plank]]s next to [[John Shin (NPC)|John Shin]] on the beach. Pick up four:
:{{text|say|John Shin|I heard the crocs are attacking because of an ancient [[mogu]] curse.}}
The kelp is near the southern tip of the [[Marista]] island, next to [[Leni Kelpenstout]]. Loot it:
:{{text|say|Leni Kelpenstout|I say just let the crocolisks come. They'll stop attacking eventually. Why interfere?}}

==Progression==
{{Marista}}
