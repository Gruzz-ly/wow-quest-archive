==Objectives==
Report to [[General Nazgrim]] at [[Domination Point]] in [[Krasarang Wilds]].

==Description==
Wherever your loyalties might lie - with Rommath and I, with Garrosh, or elsewhere - one thing is true: your acts today were truly heroic.

I can arrange for your transport back to Krasarang Wilds. Speak with me if you would like passage back to Pandaria, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Nazgrim listens as you recount the day's events.>

We take the bell... and the Alliance takes Dalaran. That escalated quickly.

War is coming, <name>. Be on your toes.

==Notes==
*This quest is not necessary to trigger the next one in the chain. Should you overlook it and return to Domination Point (whether by using the portal or not) then Nazgrim will still offer the next quest.
*After One Last Grasp is completed, the NPCs in the Court of the Sun cannot be interacted with. To obtain this quest, return to Domination Point, speak to Kromthar to be teleported to the phased version of Dalaran, and speak with Rommath in the Runeweaver Square to accept the quest. Then you are on your own to get to Nazgrim in Dominance Point. You can also get to Silvermoon and speak with Lor'themar in the Sunfury Spire to be teleported to Nazgrim - {{gossip|I would like to go to Krasarang Wilds.}}
**Considering the quest text, it was to be given Lor'themar in Court of the Sun.
