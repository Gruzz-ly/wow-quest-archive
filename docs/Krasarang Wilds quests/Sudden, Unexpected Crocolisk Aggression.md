==Objectives==

Slay 8 Mortbreath [[crocolisk]]s at [[Kea Krak]].
*Mortbreath crocolisk slain (8)

==Description==
[[File:Mortbreath Snapper.jpg|thumb|[[Mortbreath Snapper]].]]
Normally, my day consists of catching fish, and then eating the fish I caught, followed by sleeping. Note that I did not include "fight with a crocolisk" in that list of activities.

You look like a handy <class>. Can you go get rid of some of these crocolisks, so I can get back to my regular routine? The crocolisks normally keep to themselves up at Kea Krak, to the northwest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What would make the crocs attack like this?

==Completion==
Yesterday, we were fishing happily. Today, the crocs just started... tryin' to eat us.

Strange.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Particular Plumage]] before heading out. Note that the [[Desperate Mortbreath]]s do ''not'' count for Crocolisk Aggression.

Cross to the northwest to [[Kea Krak]] and start killing [[Crimson Lory|crimson]], [[Dusky Lory|dusky]], and [[Emerald Lory|emeral]] lories and [[Mortbreath Skulker|skulkers]] and [[Mortbreath Snapper|snappers]]. Feathers drop up to four at a time.

==Progression==
