==Objectives==
Kill 8 Korjan Reclaimers.
*[[Korjan Reclaimer]] slain (8)

==Description==
The [[mogu]] reclaimers are using portals to connect to [[Kun-Lai Summit]], bringing in reinforcements and supplies.

What is worse, they are sending their captives through these portals.

Go to the [[Ruins of Korja]] and destroy as many of these Korjan Reclaimers as you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We cannot hope to beat these mogu if their numbers keep growing.

==Completion==
You have bought us some much needed breathing room to lick our wounds and prepare a counter-attack.

==Notes==
Pick up [[No Sister Left Behind]] and [[Re-Reclaim (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Just south of the basecamp is a small [[jinyu]] village, [[Fallsong Village]], beset by [[saurok]]. [[Tired Shushen]] offers a couple of quests, [[Thieving Raiders]] and [[Raid Leader Slovan]].

To the southeast is the [[Field of Korja]] and the [[Ruins of Korja]]. [[Korjan Reclaimer|reclaimers]] and [[Korjan Collector|collectors]] are wandering the area, guarding captive NPCs and loot on the ground. Kill reclaimers, free captives, loot the loot, then return to base camp. Back at camp are [[Ambassador Han]] and some [[Wounded Traveller]]s.

==Progression==
{{Sentinel Basecamp}}
