Find the object the [[Monkey King]] described in his riddle.
*[[Untamed Amber]] {{co|65.7|71.7|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
So, you wake up the Monkey King for a mallet hmmm? Answer first, these riddles three, and then the mallet you shall see.

First riddle!

<blockquote>"Softly singing a song of pain<br /><br />
There is a creature tortured and lame.<br /><br />
Way down south and beyond the wall,<br /><br />
It hides from its wikket masters' call.<br /><br />
Seek out the creature sad and somber,<br /><br />
And free it from its untamed amber."</blockquote>

Bring me the untamed amber.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Progress==
Ah, the wise-ish thing returns. Have you my amber?

==Completion==
Ah! Amber! Fresh and untamed. Did you kill to get it? But of course.

Though free, the untamed amber is a dangerous thing, and many might die because of it.

Mercy comes in many forms, like spikes and mantid and really ookin' spooky storms.

Pick up [[The Second Riddle: Fellowship]] and [[The Third Riddle: Strength]] before heading out. Speak with Anduin for a reminder:
:I will try to lead the "King" back to Lion's Landing and see if I can't persuade him to volunteer the information we need. In the meantime, I would say try to solve his riddles and meet us there.

The [[Temple of the White Tiger]], location of the third riddle, is closest, so head there first. Exit the [[Tomb of Conquerors]] and fly southeast to reach the tiger temple. Fly to the main building and stop at the entrance. Immediately inside, at {{co|68.7|45.5|Kun-Lai Summit}} is a ramp leading down to the right. Inside is... [[The Monkey King]]? Speak with him:
:Ha! Didn't expect to see me here did you? The Monkey King does not delegate duelery! Now, are you hero? Or are you wikket?
:{{gossip|I challenge you.}}
:{{text|say|The Monkey King|Okee dokee! Let's see what you got.}}

The Monkey King here is a boss-level hozen with 787,882 health. Finish him off:
:{{text|say|The Monkey King|Eek! Quick, strong, dangerous. You know how to stick it. I no longer afraid you just some filthy wikket.}}
:{{text|say|The Monkey King|Solve the other riddles, I am demanding! And then meet me down south at Lion's Landing.}}

Jade Forest is next closest, so head east in that direction. The [[Shrine of Fellowship]] is in northwestern Jade Forest, between [[Honeydew Village]], [[Grookin Hill]], and the [[Tian Monastery]]. There at the shrine at {{co|33.4|34.2|Jade Forest}} is a huge bell and a small mallet resting on its northern support. Interact with it to ring the bell, summoning [[Sam the Wise]]:
:{{text|say|Sam the Wise|Ah, so there is one who wishes to taste the might of the Metal Brew?}}
:{{text|say|Sam the Wise|It's flavor is intended for friends to share after a battle. Come... friend... and battle me if you dare.}}
:{{text|yell|Sam the Wise|Glory to the brave!}}

Sam the Wise is a level 90 male pandaren with 787,882 health. Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Sam the Wise|Well done, hero! I yield to your might.}}
:{{text|say|Sam the Wise|Enjoy this well-earned brew. The recipe has been in my family for over ten thousand years. Once enjoyed by the Monkey King himself, they say.}}
:''Sam the Wise steps over to A Keg of Metal Brew and takes some to drink.''

Interact with the Keg and collect some of [[The Metal Brew]]. Finally, head southwest to [[Dread Wastes]]. It may be quicker to run by Lion's Landing, turn in, and then take the portal to the ''Skyfire'' to cut off some travel time. Just north of the main scorpid camp on the [[Chittering Coast]] just inside the wall at {{co|65.7|71.7|Dread Wastes}} is a piece of [[Untamed Amber]]. Interact with it to spawn an [[Untamed Ambertail]], a level 90 scorpid with 787,882 health. Kill it and loot the Untamed Amber from it.

Head back to [[Lion's Landing]] once all three riddles are solved.
