*Find Baine Bloodhoof at Garrosh'ar Advance

==Description==
I have another message for you from High Chieftain Bloodhoof.

It seems you've made quite the impression on him.

He travels with the Warchief's vanguard into [[Kun-Lai Summit]], to the north. They have set up an outpost, Garrosh'ar Advance, just east of [[One Keg]].

You had best not keep him waiting. Speak to Tak-Tak for swift travel.

*118,000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Completion==
Thank you for coming, <name>. 

==Notes==
You must speak with [[Tak-Tak]] in order to get credit for finding [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]]. Tak-Tak offers a ride on [[Tak-Tak's Kite|his kite]]:
