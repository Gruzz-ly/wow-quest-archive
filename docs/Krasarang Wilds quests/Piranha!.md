==Objectives==
Fish up 5 Wolf Piranha from the [[Krasarang River]] in [[Krasarang Wilds]].
*[[Wolf Piranha]] (5)

==Description==
Certain fish are very difficult to catch. The wolf piranha falls squarely into this category.

Lucky for me that you showed up! Put those fishing skills to the test and bring me back a few from the krasarang river due northwest of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|lcgf=1}} and one point of [[Fishing]] skill
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
I see you still have all your fingers, nice work.

==Notes==
Head to the western of the two rivers, find a quiet spot, and get to fishing.

It appears that these fish either cannot be caught in a [[fishing pool]] or are extremely rare to catch in one. Fish instead in normal water.

==Progression==
