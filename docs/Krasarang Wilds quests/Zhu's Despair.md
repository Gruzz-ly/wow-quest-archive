==Description==
Hmm... Is that Yi-Mo kid over there?

<{{NPC||Ken-Ken}} squints against the increasing torrents of rain.>

It is! He's at the well, and he's not lookin' so good.

Ken-Ken got a bad feeling about this...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ken-Ken's Mask]] and {{cost|19|60}}
* 110000 XP

==Completion==
We did some good work here today, <name>. [[Tian Monastery|Monastery]] always tells us to leave a place better than we find it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ken-Ken|What the... Sha nasties are poppin' out everywhere! We gotta take care of them first!}}

Don't bother trying to skip ahead and use the mask on Yi-Mo before the quota of sha have been killed:
:{{text|say|Ken-Ken|Yi-Mo will be fine for right now, we gotta take care of these nasties first!}}

Kill 8.
:{{text|yell|Yi-Mo Longbrow|ALL IS LOST! LAY DOWN AND SUBMIT TO YOUR DESPAIR!}}
:{{text|say|Ken-Ken|Okay, no more time. Yi-Mo needs help now! Let's get a mask on him!}}

Walk up to him and use the mask.
A level 86 sha with 365,000 health, the {{NPC||Quintessence of Despair}}, appears out of Yi-Mo. It casts a debuff that will stun for four seconds if it is not dispelled, but otherwise the fight is straightforward. Ken-Ken will help.  Once defeated, the player gets knocked out cold.

:{{text|say|Ken-Ken|<Name>!  Are you okay?  Wake up!}}
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|He's coming to!}}
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|<Name>...  To think you'd risked your life to save me - twice now - and I'd only treated you with disdain.}}
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|I am shamed beyond comprehension.  Please forgive me - my mind was not my own.}}
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Should you ever need aid of any kind, from a handful of turnip seeds to a volley of arrows, know that Zhu's Watch will provide it.}}
:''Longbrow walks back to [[Wilds' Edge Inn]].''
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|For now, I must direct my attention to rebuilding the village.  There is much to be done.  You may rest here if you like, but we'll not accept any more help.}}
:{{text|say|Ken-Ken|We did it, <name>!  That was some good butt-punchin' back there!}}
:{{text|say|Ken-Ken|Something tells Ken-Ken that's not the last of the sads, though...}}

Ken-Ken will run back to respawn beneath the inn for turn in. Mei continues the chain with [[Into the Wilds]]. Don't forget about [[Kang Bramblestaff (quest)]], either.

This completes the "Zhu's Watch" portion of [[Mighty Roamin' Krasaranger]].
