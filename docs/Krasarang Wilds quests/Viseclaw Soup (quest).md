==Objectives==
Kill [[Viseclaw Fisher]]s on the beach and return with 16 eyes to make some yummy soup.
*[[Viseclaw Fisher Eye]] (16)

==Description==
Nothing tastes quite like viseclaw soup. It's a [[Krasarang Wilds|krasarang]] specialty!

I was just about to start up on a new batch when I realized I am missing a key ingredient, the eyes!

I need you to kill the viseclaw fishers on the beach and return with their eyes for the soup!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|lcgf=1}} and 1 point of [[Fishing]] skill.
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
How many of their beady little eyes did you get?

==Completion==
Thanks, <class>, this might be my best catch of soup yet!

==Notes==
Head northeast to [[Turtle Beach]] or southeast past the [[Anglers Expedition]] and start killing mobs specifically called [[Viseclaw Fisher]]s. The scuttlers do not drop fisher eyes. However, [[Viseclaw Fry]]s do. Huh?

==Progression==
{{Anglers Wharf dailies}}
