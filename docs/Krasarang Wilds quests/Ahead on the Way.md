==Objectives==
Kill the [[Maw of Despair (sha)|Maw of Despair]] in both the eastern and western pagodas at the [[Temple of the Red Crane]].
*West Pagoda Cleansed {{co|43.1|54.3|Krasarang Wilds}}
*East Pagoda Cleansed {{co|37.8|54.3|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
Huge maws of despair are spewing out [[sha]] from the pagodas on either side of the temple. Meanwhile, your impromptu training in the Way continues.

"She who mends torn umbrella will be more dry than she who strikes at rain."

While I take issue with that particular lesson—sometimes punching the rain can be quite effective—the meaning holds true in this case.

Take out those maws of despair and give my order a chance at reclaiming the temple grounds.

==Progress==
[[Koro Mistwalker|Koro]] said there's a pagoda on either side of the temple. Let's find them and wipe out the sha presence in both.

==Completion==
Koro's metaphors can get a little tiring, but there's always true wisdom behind them.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Striking the Rain]] and [[Sha Can Awe]] before heading out.

After picking up all three, Anduin will join the adventurer's party, adding a buff: Aura of Hope - "Fortified by Anduin Wrynn. When you defeat a sha creature at the Temple of the Red Crane, you regain a portion of your health and mana, and inspire nearby Hopeless defenders. The more powerful the sha vanquished, the greater the magnitude of these effects.

Head down to the temple and get started killing sha, making sure to kite them close to defenders before actually finishing them off, but don't focus on the killing yet. Valid units include [[Haunt of Despair]], [[Incarnation of Despair]], and [[Source of Despair]]. On either side of the temple are two very large pagodas with a [[Maw of Despair (sha)|Maw of Despair]], a level 87 sha with 644,000 health. Kill all along the way down there, mindful of the location of the hopeless pandaren on the sha's death. The maw of despair will channel Wail of Despair - interrupt it quickly to limit the number of [[Ripple of Despair]] spawns. Kill around to the other side of the temple and cleanse the other pagoda. By this point, all three quests should be done.
