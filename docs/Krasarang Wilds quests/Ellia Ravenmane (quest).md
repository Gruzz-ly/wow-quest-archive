*Ellia Ravenmane defeated

==Description==
We regularly organize one-on-one duels with trainees that we think are well-suited for one another. We have found one such trainee for you, <name>.

Her name is Ellia Ravenmane. This will be her first duel, too. She will be waiting for you at the pavilion just to the south of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|lcgf=2}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Yes, you and Ellia should be a perfect match...

==Completion==
Very good!

The next time you return, you will face a new challenger. Continue winning, and your favor in the eyes of [[Chi-Ji]] will increase.

==Notes==
Head south to the [[Angkhal Pavilion]]. Ella is standing on its southern side. Speak with her:
:Hey! You here to challenge me to a fight?
:{{gossip|Let's fight!}}
Ellia is a pandaren with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Jab|range=Melee|Jab target enemy, inflicting 110% weapon damage.|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant}}
*{{abilities|Kick|Kick target enemy, inflicting Physical damage.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~11,000 Physical on cloth.}}
Finish her off:
:{{text|say|Ellia Ravenmane|Alright, <name>. We are now RIVALS. You haven't seen the last of me.}}
She runs off to the north.

Shortly after complete, Ellia sends a letter to the player through the in-game mail system:
{{book|Rivals|content=I refuse to accept defeat! You haven't heard the last of me!}}
