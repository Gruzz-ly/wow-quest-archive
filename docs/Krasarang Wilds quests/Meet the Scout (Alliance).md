==Objectives==
Speak with [[Scout Lynna]] at [[Krasarang Cove]] in [[Krasarang Wilds]].

==Description==
It has been two months since the parting of the mists. Alliance scouts, seeking a suitable landing site for the fleet, have engaged Horde forces on a beach in Krasarang Wilds.

Meet with Scout Lynna and help secure the landing site.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|70}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
You have impeccable timing, <class>. [[Varian Wrynn|King Wrynn]] is just about to land, and the full might of our fleet will follow soon after.

==Notes==
This quest begins the Alliance Pandaren campaign. Given automatically upon reaching level 90, head to southeastern [[Krasarang Wilds]]. The [[Incursion]] is the nearest flight path.

[[Scout Lynna]] and [[Hilda Hornswaggle]] are on the eastern end of the cove just feet from the water. Speak with Lynna to turn in, which starts a short script event:
:{{text|yell|King Varian Wrynn|There's my survey team. Bring us in.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|What's the situation?}}
:{{text|say|Hilda Hornswaggle|Yer Highness! This site has everything we need. Lumber, stone and-}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|The Horde?}}
:{{text|say|Hilda Hornswaggle|Marshal Troteman and a handful o' scouts pursued a Horde warband up the beach. They haven't come back.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Hmm... Troteman may have gotten himself in over his head. We'll split up.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Lynna, stay here and establish a camp. Your first priority should be medical tents and shelters. When the peasants arrive, see that they begin construction of the docks.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Hornswaggle, notify the rest of the survey team. Quarry and mining operations will begin as soon as the fleet arrives.}}
:{{text|say|Hilda Hornswaggle|Yes, Yer Majesty!}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Champion, you know this land better than anyone. You're with me. Let's go find Troteman.}}
:''Hilda mounts her ram and takes off.''
Speak with Wrynn to continue.
