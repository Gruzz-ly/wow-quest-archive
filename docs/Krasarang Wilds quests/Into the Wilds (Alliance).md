==Objectives==
Locate the missing Zhu's Watch Courier in the southern area of the [[Dojani River]], then continue on to the [[Temple of the Red Crane]] and speak with [[Koro Mistwalker]].
*[[Zhu's Watch Courier]] Found {{co|66.3|30.9|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
Deep in the wilds, on the southern coast where the [[Krasarang River]] meets the sea, rests the Temple of the Red Crane, home of the great [[Chi-Ji]] and his most devout followers.

They should be told of what happened here.

If you're headed that way, I have a favor to ask; We often send supplies to the temple, but our last courier has not returned.  Please look for signs of him as you travel - where the road forks at the Dojani River, he'd have gone south.  When you reach the temple, find Koro Mistwalker.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Supplies from the watch?  Great!  We'll need them at the camp...

But... Mei never sends a <class>... where's the usual courier?

==Completion==
I see...  And the [[sha]] have seeped out as far as [[Zhu Province|the province]] already, have they?

Well, I hate to break it to you, but the temple is also overrun with sha.  Those of us who haven't been killed or... possessed, or whatever, are fleeing for our very lives.

If you have defeated the sha at [[Zhu's Watch]], I have to implore you to help us deal with them here.

==Notes==
[[File:Daggle Bombstrider at Krasari Ruins.jpg|thumb|[[Daggle Bombstrider]] surrounded by dead tigers at [[Krasari Ruins]]]]
Follow the road south through the [[Krasari Ruins]] to reach a fork in the road. At the fork is [[Daggle Bombstrider]], surrounded by dead Krasari Huntresses. She too offers Mastery quests... [[Crane Mastery]] and [[Profit Mastery]]. Do her quests or not, then take the south fork to find the corpses of the courier and a Krasari Mauler. Interact with the courier:
:The courier must have died of his wounds after what looks to have been a brutal struggle.
:His supply satchel appears to be unharmed.

[[File:Incursion.jpg|thumb|The [[Incursion]] trapped by the Arcanic Oubliette]]
Immediately to the south is the [[Incursion]], locked in an arcane bubble. [[Kang Bramblestaff]] is immediately outside. Do the Incursion quests starting with [[The Arcanic Oubliette]] or not, then keep heading along the path south to reach the temple. Koro can be found on the path right as it crosses the river north of the [[Temple of the Red Crane]].
