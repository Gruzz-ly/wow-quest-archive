'''The Great Angler Returns''' is the third quest to recruit Nat Pagle.

==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|image=Molten Catfish.jpg|name=Molten Catfish|text=A rare species of fish from Frostfire Ridge in Draenor.}}
Return to [[Rak'jin]] with Nat's journal page as proof that you found him.
*[[Page from Nat's Fishing Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
What's this species, a molten catfish you say?  I have never even heard of a fish like this, much less seen one in person!

I have to find more fish like this, it's what I live for!  And if the fishing is as good as you say it is, there is just no way I can pass this opportunity up.  Take this page from my journal as proof that you found me and I will meet you back at your Garrison.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
You found Nat?  The real Nat Pagle?!

==Completion==
We should really catch some big one's{{Sic}} when Nat's{{Sic}} gets here!
