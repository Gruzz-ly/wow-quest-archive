==Objectives==
Bring [[Yi-Mo Longbrow]] back to [[Zhu's Watch]].
*Yi-Mo Brought to Zhu's Watch

==Description==
Ever since this storm began, I've just been... tired.

Not physically... no. It's like my very soul is exhausted. Worthless. Hopeless. I imagine it's what one feels when a mate leaves them for someone with a rounder belly, but I've never had a mate so how would I know?

How can I claim to know anything? I'm worthless to everyone but these [[thunderbird]]s. At least they'll have a good meal out of me.

<Yi-Mo sighs deeply and continues staring off into the sky. It doesn't look like he's going anywhere.>

==Progress==
You found him?! Please, is he alright?

==Completion==
I can't believe he was actually going to do that... This despair is worse than I had even imagined.

I cannot thank you enough for bringing him back.

Talk to him again:
:You're wasting your time.
:I'm not going anywhere.
*{{gossip|Please, Yi-Mo: your aunt's worried sick about you.}}
:Is she REALLY worried about me? I doubt it...
*{{gossip|You have your whole life ahead of you.}}
:What is life, anyway? A series of disappointments, one after another.
*{{gossip|I don't have time for this. Move your ass or I'll move it for you.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Roll Yi-Mo towards Zhu's Watch!}}
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Say what you want. I'm not moving an inch.}}

Dismount and click on him:
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Oof! What are you doing?!}}
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Ow! Stop it! I'm waiting for the thunderbirds to take me!}}
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Here they come...}}
:''First attack''
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Why?!}}
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Just leave me here or they'll take you too!}}
:''Second attack''
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Ugh... I'm getting dizzy.}}
:''Yi-Mo throws up!''
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|You're crazy, you know that? Here comes another!}}
:''Third attack''
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Don't give up, thunderbirds! Come back for me!}}
:''Fourth attack''
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Nooooo!}}
:''Yi-Mo finally gives up, gets up, and starts walking to the inn.''
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Alright, alright already! Enough with the shoving!}}
:{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|I'm going to my room. Feel free to tell my aunt about how you "heroically" saved me from myself or whatever.}}
:''Yi-Mo walks upstairs and despawns.''

He rolls about 10 yards. Every few kicks a Thunderbird will spawn, so kill it, then repeat the process.

On complete:
:{{text|yell|[[Ken-Ken]]|Hey, <name>, come over here!  Ken-Ken thinks he knows how to fix sad pandas!}}
