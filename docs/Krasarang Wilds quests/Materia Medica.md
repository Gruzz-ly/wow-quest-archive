[[File:Slick Mudfish.jpg|thumb|Slick Mudfish]]
[[File:Rain-Slick Honeycomb.jpg|thumb|Rain-Slick Honeycomb]]
Gather 4 Chunks of Honeycomb, 4 Slick Mudfish, and 4 Salty Cores from [[Zhu Province]].
* [[Salty Core]] (4)
* [[Slick Mudfish]] (4)
*[[Chunk of Honeycomb]] (4)

==Description==
Alright, [[Ken-Ken]] pretty sure he knows what wrong with pandaren! Got old, old [[hozen]] remedy that do the trick.

Need to mix honey, fish oil, and salt. Ken-Ken saw lots of beehives in the trees around town, and there must be fish left in the dry ponds.

That just leave salt... [[Mei Barrelbottom|Mei]] might know where we can find some.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Can't believe Ken-Ken did not think of this sooner. It's the ONE thing that can ruin his day...

==Completion==
Pandaren got a case of the spooky-dooks!

Dooks get scared sometimes, don't wanna come out. Poor, fluffy mopey-dopes must be ready to explode by now!

This just the thing to bring 'em out. That make pandaren happy for sure!

Just like ol' gramma used to say: can't THROW if can't GO!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Tears of Pandaria]] before heading out. Speak to Mei again:
:Thank you for bringing back Yi-Mo.

:It's clear to me now that we can no longer ignore our duties in [[Zhu Province|the province]].

:{{gossip|''Mei, do you have any idea where I can find salt around here?''}}

:Normally we'd have plenty on hand, but most of our suppies have been left out to ruin in the rain.

:However, I'm certain the creatures in the dried up ponds are a mixture of rainwater and salt from the earth. You may be able to get what you need from them.

Head south or southwest out of town to the dried-up ponds, kill the elementals, loot the fish off the ground and the honeycombs from trees nearby.
