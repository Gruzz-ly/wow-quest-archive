==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Needlebeak.jpg|Needlebeak|Lord of the Flock}}
Acquire the Needlebeak.
*[[The Needlebeak]] {{co|63.4|20.0|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
So, now that you've got a vibe for how cranes fight, I've got a doozy for you.

[[Needlebeak]]!

Or at least, that's what I'm calling him. Biggest crane I ever saw. And its beak is so sharp it's like a sword.

Northwest of here you'll find the big water fall that kicks off the [[Dojani River]]. Needlebeak likes to hang out by the waterfall.

You bring me its beak as a trophy and I will talk you up a good game to [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]].

==Progress==
I watched that bird stab a tiger through the face. What kind of place is this where birds are the predators for tigers?

==Completion==
Now THAT is a trophy. Looks intimidating. Wait... is this your blood on it?

==Notes==
Head northwest to the lower side of the [[Winds' Edge]] of the [[Valley of the Four Winds]]. Underneath the waterfall north of [[Thunder Cleft]] is [[Needlebeak]], a crane with the following special abilities:
