==Objectives==
Kill 12 Weeping Horrors in [[Zhu Province]].
*[[Weeping Horror]] slain (12)

==Description==
All of this started with our ponds. In a single day, all of the water retreated down into the earth. When there was no more water in the ponds, it began to fall from the sky.

Despite endless torrents of rain, the ponds do not fill. It's as if the land itself thirsts and cannot be quenched.

Now the ponds birth horrific manifestations of despair. [[Elemental]]s made of water from the sky and salt from the earth; the tears of Pandaria.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|80}}
*110000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I don't know why this is happening, but I can say for certain that those elementals were the start of it all.

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>.

It's time we take back our land from this curse.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Materia Medica]] before heading out.

Head south or southwest out of town to the dried-up ponds, kill the elementals, loot the fish off the ground and the honeycombs from trees nearby.
