==Objectives==
[[File:Unga Treasure-Hider.jpg|thumb|[[Unga Treasure-Hider]]s do not have any treasure on them...]]
Find the Buried Hozen Treasure
*[[Buried Hozen Treasure]]

==Description==
The map you hold is crinkled, dirty, and poorly drawn, but you can see a big X on a beach.

Is there buried treasure somewhere on [[Unga Ingoo|this island]]?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[The Golden Banana]]
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This must be it!

==Completion==
With some effort, the box creaks open. This must be what the hozen were hiding.

==Notes==
The [[Unga Fish-Getter]]s overfishing [[Nayeli Lagoon]] from [[Unga Ingoo]] drop a [[Confusing Treasure Map]] while adventurers are killing them for [[Balance (quest)]]. Also, walk up close to one of the fish piles to start [[Balance Without Violence]] automatically. Near big fish piles are small fish flopping about. Interact with a small fish to throw it back in. The "buried treasure" can be found all over the beach in Lumps of Sand. Buried by [[Unga Treasure-Hider]]s, one of the sand piles may actually have something other than an [[Empty Barrel]] or a [[Banana Peel]]...
