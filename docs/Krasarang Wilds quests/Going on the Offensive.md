==Objectives==
Get Incursion Sentinel's Report.
*[[Sentinel Scout's Report]] {{co|43.9|43.4|Krasarang Wilds}}

==Description==
Ha! So [[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin|my father]] just wasted twenty years of our lives on a fool's errand!

I'm taking charge.

When [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] sent us here she was very specific that we not come back until we find the source of the [[Light]] that she saw in her visions. It's obvious now that the [[Pools of Youth]] were not it.

I want you to look for [[Incursion Sentinel|my scout]]. I sent her to investigate the [[Temple of the Red Crane|Crane Temple]] but she hasn't returned.

Get her report and rendezvous with us at the [[Sentinel Basecamp]] further west.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the scout?

==Completion==
<Name>, well timed as usual. It turns out the mogu know how to use portals as well.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lyalia|Sentinels, saddle up and prepare to move out! [[Magister Xintar|Xintar]], carve us a portal to the next location. We are leaving a small garrision here and pressing northwestward.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Xintar|Um, this may take a while.}}
Follow the road west and sneak through the ruins to reach the [[Deepwild]]. As the path reaches the [[Krasarang River]], the [[Incursion Sentinel]] can be found dead, just to the south of the path, slain by arrows. Loot the [[Sentinel Scout's Report]]. If desired, stop and speak with [[Koro Mistwalker]], holding a [[saurok]] by the neck, for [[Into the Wilds (Alliance)]]. Otherwse, keep heading northwest to reach the [[Sentinel Basecamp]].

==Progression==
