==Progress==
Congratulations in advance, <name>.

==Completion==
And with that victory, I suppose we've run out of challengers for you to fight! Other than me, of course.

But... I don't fight. I mean, you wouldn't want to fight me. It would... not go well for you.

==Notes==

Head southeast to the [[Pedestal of Hope]] to find Yan Quillpaw looking out toward [[Unga Ingoo]]. Speak with him:
:You've faced the best of our trainees, and defeated them all. Now let's see what you're really made of...

This is Fat Long-Fat. We fought on top of [[Angkhal Pavilion]]. Do you remember me?

I will be returning from my absence shortly. When I return, I would like to fight with you again. Perhaps this time, we fight atop [[Dome Balrissa]]?
