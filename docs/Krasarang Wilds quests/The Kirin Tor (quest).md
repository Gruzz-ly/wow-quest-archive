==Objectives==
[[File:The Fate of Dalaran.jpg|thumb|Anduin and Jaina]]
Use the Portal to the Purple Parlor in [[Lion's Landing]] and meet with [[Anduin Wrynn]].
*Use the Portal to The Purple Parlor {{coords|89.2|33.6|Krasarang Wilds||1}}

==Description==
<Name>, [[Varian Wrynn|King Varian]] has asked that I send you after his son to [[Dalaran]]. He believes you can help negotiate the withdrawal of [[blood elf|blood elves]] there.

These "[[Sunreavers]]" claim fealty to the [[Horde]] and represent a major threat to the war effort.

Now that our very own [[Jaina Proudmoore]] is in charge of the [[Kirin Tor]] it should be easy to convince her to remove this Horde threat to her city.

Use the portal here in Lion's Landing to go to the Purple Parlor and lend what aid you can to Prince Anduin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
I am glad to see you, friend. While I have learned much about diplomacy I think Jaina is too familiar with my tactics.

I could use a friendly hand in resolving this conflict.

==Notes==
[[Seamus Goldenkicks]] will spawn a special Portal to the Purple Parlor at {{coords|89.2|33.6|Krasarang Wilds||1}} next to him. Using the [[Violet Hold (instance)|Violet Hold]] loading screen, the adventurer will teleport to a [[phasing|phased]] version of the [[Purple Parlor]] of [[Dalaran]].

As the adventurer teleports in:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|My father isn't asking you to pledge the Kirin Tor to the Alliance-}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Anduin, I know exactly what he's asking. Oh - look who's arrived.}}
Step outside to the balcony to speak with Anduin.

==Progression==
{{Alliance Pandaren campaign}}
