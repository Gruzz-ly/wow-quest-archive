== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Sunwalker Dezco]], and wait for the newborn.
* Stand by Dezco's side

== Description ==
My child is coming. I must help as I may.

Stay nearby, hero. If [[Leza Dawnchaser|my wife]] and child survive, I would have them look on the face of the one who saved them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|80}}

== Progress ==
I pray to [[An'she]] that my wife and child survive this journey.

== Completion ==
She... she died. For all the powers the [[Light]] has given me, I was unable to save her.

Thanks to your help, however... we saved my sons.

== Notes ==
Speaking with Dezco:
:My child is nearly here... everything changes today...
:{{gossip|Go, stand by your wife's side. I will protect the tent from invaders.}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|You are right, <name>. I should be there for Leza. Thank you.}}
:{{text|say|Leza Farwalker|Dezco... it hurts... it... AAAHHH!}}
:{{text|say|[[Nala]]|Something's wrong. The baby's turned the wrong way.}}
:{{text|say|Leza Farwalker|Dezco, where are you?!}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|I'm here, Leza.}}
:{{text|say|Leza Farwalker|My love... whatever happens... you must protect our... our child....}}
:{{text|yell|Leza Farwalker|GAAAHHH!}}
:{{text|yell|Sunwalker Dezco|Leza!}}
:{{text|yell|Sunwalker Dezco|LEZA!!}}
:''The cutscene cuts to show Leza's funeral and then Dezco tending to his child, before the camera slowly moves to reveal there are two babies.''

The cutscene can be viewed again by using [[Leza's Totem]], located at the door of the tent where Leza died.

== Analysis ==
The efforts of the player and [[Kang Bramblestaff]] during the previous quest [[The Pools of Youth (Horde)]] may have in fact made the situation worse for the Dawnchasers. During the Alliance-only quest [[Immortality?]] it is discovered that the water of the [[Pools of Youth]] does not give life or youth to those who drink from it, it transfers the drinkers' life from one person to another. Thus, when Leza Dawnchaser drank the water, it took her vitality from her. Whether it was given to the players, Dezco, Nala or the babies within her is unknown.
