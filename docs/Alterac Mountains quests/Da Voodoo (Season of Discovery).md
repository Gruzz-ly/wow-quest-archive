==Description==
The spirit totem just isn't enough. We be needin' some [[voodoo]] [[magic]] to make it work jus' right.

The [[Jungle troll|trolls]] in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|sunken temple]] have feathers strong with voodoo magics. Go there and kill [[Gasher]], [[Mijan]], [[Zolo]], [[Hukku]], [[Zul'Lor|Zul'lor]], and [[Loro]]. Then we have magic enough for a real spirit totem.

Where's the feathers, mon?

==Completion==
It's about time this troll got a full night's rest!  The spirit totem will watch over me.

I been a long time collectin' things, maybe you want somethin' for all your trouble? 

==Notes==
The feathers drop from the [[Atal'ai Defenders]] in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Temple of Atal'Hakkar]].
