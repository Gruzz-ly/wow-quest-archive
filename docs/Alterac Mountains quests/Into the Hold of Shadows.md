==Objectives==
Find Caius inside of [[Shadow Hold]], in {{C|Felwood}}, and stop his ritual. In addition, bring proof of his demise to [[Fahrad]] at [[Ravenholdt Manor]]. You must go alone, and remain unseen until you find Caius.
*Find [[Caius Blackwood]]
*[[Caius' Dream Eater]]

==Description==
Caius' betrayal is a troubling wrinkle. It points towards another, more dangerous, [[organization]].

Our intelligence indicates that this may be the [[Shadow Council]].

The council's base of operations is Shadow Hold, in Felwood. If our information is correct, Caius' ritual will likely be performed there. You must infiltrate Shadow Hold, find Caius, and stop him.

It is imperative you remain undetected. If Caius catches wind of your presence, he is likely flee, or have you killed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70}}
*9950 [[XP]]
*[[Dream Eater]]

==Progress==
Have you found Caius yet?

==Completion==
So Caius was indeed an ally of the Shadow Council. The implications of such a conspiracy could be massive.

Your mission's success has provided valuable intelligence, and thwarted a great danger to all of [[Azeroth]]. Excellent work, <name>.  

As for this "Dream Eater" you've recovered: I shudder to think what it could have been if Caius had completed his ritual. Wield it with finesse, and choose your targets wisely.

==Notes==
If you are not in a party, an instance portal will appear at the entrance of [[Shadow Hold]] in {{C|Felwood}}. The quest can only be completed within this instanced version.

You must move all the way through Shadow Hold to the end in [[Stealth]] without being detected to find [[Caius Blackwood]]. He will only be present if you remain undetected; otherwise, he will despawn and the instance will need to be reset. Upon approaching, the quest objective will complete and he will begin his ritual.

Once the ritual fails, kill Caius and take the Dream Eater then return to Fahrad to turn in the quest.
