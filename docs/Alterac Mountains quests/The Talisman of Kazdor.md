==Objectives==
Find The Talisman of Kazdor inside of [[Zul'Farrak]]. Then, bring it to [[Fahrad]] at [[Ravenholdt Manor]]. You must complete the job alone.
*[[Talisman of Kazdor]]

==Description==
From the most recent letter we intercepted, it appears the final artifact [[Caius Blackwood|Caius]] desires is the Talisman of Kazdor. The letter states this talisman is somewhere inside Zul'Farrak.

I want you to complete the job as per Caius' instructions, as not to arouse his suspicion. This means you'll have to go into Zul'Farrak alone, as usual.

However, before you deliver the Talisman, bring it back here. We'll be giving Caius a little more than he asked for.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4700 [[XP]]
*{{cost||75}}

==Progress==
Go now, time is of the essence.

==Completion==
Some fine thievery indeed, <name>. Now, time for step two.

==Notes==
===Completing the quest===
To obtain the Eye, the Rogue must sneak through Zul'Farrak and open the [[Spellbound War Chest]] atop the pyramid. This ''must'' be done solo.
*[[Vile Concoction]]s can be looted from [[Clay Vessel]]s found throughout the instance. These can be thrown into cauldrons to create an explosion, killing nearby enemies without breaking [[Stealth]].
*Obtain [[Offering of Bone]] from [[Antu'Sul's Satchel]] and [[Ward of the Dead]] from [[Zum'Rah's Satchel]]; both will require killing the bosses with Vile Concoctions.
**With the Ward of the Dead equipped, open the glowing [[Shallow Grave (Zul'Farrak)|Shallow Grave]] to receive [[Offering of Flesh]]. Combine it with the Offering of Bone to make [[Blood Magic Essence]].
*Walk along the wall east of the pyramid to find the [[Sandfury Cache]], which contains a [[Hollow Emblem]]. Combine it with the Blood Magic Essence to make [[Emblem of Blood Magic]].
*With the Emblem of Blood Magic, ascend the pyramid and open the Spellbound War Chest to receive the [[Talisman of Kazdor]].
