==Objectives==
Speak to [[Fahrad]] when you're ready to hear his plan.

==Description==
Not a moment too soon, <name>

[[Ravenholdt Manor|The manor]] has been keeping tabs on this "C" character you've been dealing with.

C's true identity is [[Caius Blackwood]]; a powerful [[magic]] user working with the [[Syndicate]]. Our sources say he has been gathering artifacts for an unknown purpose. Only recently did we discover *you* were the one providing them.

Caius must be stopped, and I believe the onus of doing so falls on you. Fortunately, I've devised a plan. Come speak to me when you're ready to clear your name.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*470 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Alright then, let's get down to business.

==Notes==
===Obtaining the quest===
In order to obtain this quest, you must first reach level 45, at which point you will receive a letter from [[Fahrad]] in the mail. This quest will only appear after reading the letter:
{{Book|An Urgent Matter|content=
<Name>,

[[Ravenholdt]]'s agents have learned that you are delivering artifacts to an entity known, to you, only as "C".

I'm afraid you are being played for a fool.

Come to Ravenholdt Manor at once. We do not begrudge you for your errors, but the situation must be dealt with swiftly.

I cannot say more in this letter. You will be given more information when you arrive.
