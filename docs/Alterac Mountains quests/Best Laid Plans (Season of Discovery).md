==Objectives==
Bring the Talisman of Kazdor to [[Zan Shivsproket|Zan Shivsprocket]]{{sic}} in the basement of [[Ravenholdt Manor]].
*[[Talisman of Kazdor]] (provided)

==Description==
Take the talisman down to Zan Shivsprocket, in the basement. I've asked him to rig the artifact with a mechanism that will detect any attempt to channel [[magic]] energy into, or out of, it.

The mechanism is all but invisible to the naked eye, and will detonate when triggered. With any luck, [[Caius Blackwood|Caius]] will be killed in the blast. At the very least, his plans for the talisman will be foiled.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*470 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes, rogue? Do you need something from me?

==Completion==
So you're on [[Fahrad]]'s job, hm?  Very well. Give me the talisman and I'll get to work.

==Progression==
{{Fool Me Twice}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.2|note=Added.}}
