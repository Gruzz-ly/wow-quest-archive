== Objectives ==
Recover the Forsaken Communication Device.
* [[Forsaken Communication Device]]

== Description ==
Communications are down with all of our frontline outposts, <name>. As of right now I don't have a damn clue as to the status of our troops in [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]]. We need to re-establish communications.

I need you to head west into the headlands and find our outpost on the coast. By now the soldiers there are likely all dead, but their F.C.D. might be operational. Grab the device and get back to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Progress ==
Recover the F.C.D.

== Completion ==
With this device I will be able to communicate with you in the field. Now to check the rest of our frontline outposts.
