==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Scarlet Crusade]] Members in [[Aderic's Repose]].
* Members of the Scarlet Crusade slain (10)

==Description==
[[Calia Menethil|Calia]] will lead the [[Forsaken]] army in a distracting assault to the North.

I'd like you to meet up with [[Lilian Voss|Lilian]] and me in [[Gilneas City|the city]]. There's a secret tunnel that will give us access to the south. From there, we can open the south gate and let our forces in while the Scarlets are distracted with Calia's troops.

There's a group of Scarlet Crusade currently skulking about the entrance to that secret tunnel. Care to take them out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
These Scarlets are a blight upon the land.

==Completion==
The first blow to the Scarlet Crusade was well struck, thanks to you.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|I will gather the Forsaken forces. Good luck.}}
:''Calia mounts up on a bat and flies off.''
:{{text|say|Princess Tess Greymane|Lilian and I will meet you in the city. Be careful.}}
:{{text|say|Mia Greymane|Trust her, Genn. She knows what she is doing.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|I know.}}
:''The rest (except Mia) walk off.''

Valid units include [[Scarlet Gravedigger]]s, [[Scarlet Purifier (Ruins of Gilneas)|Scarlet Purifiers]], [[Scarlet Recruit (Ruins of Gilneas)|Scarlet Recruit]]s, and [[Scarlet Scout (Ruins of Gilneas)|Scarlet Scouts]].

Catch up with [[Genn Greymane]] (in worgen form) and [[Celestine of the Harvest]] outside the house that hides the secret passage to [[Gilneas City]].

On approach:
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Ah, you are here. Good.}}

He has new gossip:
{{book|content=This tunnel was responsible for many Gilneans surviving when we had to leave.

It is only right it is the means to us retaking the city.}}
