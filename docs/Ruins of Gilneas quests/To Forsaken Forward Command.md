== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Deathstalker Commander Belmont}} at [[Forsaken Forward Command]] in [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]].

== Description ==
The time has come to destroy {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Crowley}}, {{NPC||Ivar Bloodfang||Bloodfang}} and every [[Worgen|dog]] at their command. To do this, though, will require cunning and planning the likes of which they would never dare dream!

As one of my most trusted soldiers, <name>, I need you to go to Forsaken Forward Command, located in Gilneas, and report to Deathstalker Commander Belmont. I have sent Belmont ahead with my plans. He awaits your arrival.

{{NPC||Arthura}} will escort you to Forward Command. Tell me when you are ready and I will send you on your way.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Completion ==
Well if it isn't <name>nub!

I hope you're ready for battle, because that's all you'll find in this hellhole. We're at the heart of contested territory and these worgen mongrels won't give an inch!
