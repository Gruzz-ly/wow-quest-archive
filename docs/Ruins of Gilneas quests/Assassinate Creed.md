This rogue-only quest is the sixth part of the chain to obtain the legendary dagger set [[Fangs of the Father]]. It is the second of several [[Stealth]]-based missions in the series, and the first of two assassination missions.

==Objectives==
Stealth into the ruins of [[Gilneas City]] and slay [[Lord Hiram Creed|Hiram Creed]] within the military district.
* [[Lord Hiram Creed]] slain

==Description==
The city has been in chaos for days now. Hiram Creed, disguised as a [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilnean]], has infected the lot of those dogs with his own draconic blood. Even the [[Forsaken]] are having trouble routing him out.

Only a surgical assassination can end this!

The bridge behind me is relatively unguarded. Slip in through merchant's square and head south - you'll find Creed in the middle of the military district.

I'll keep an eye on you and pull you out if there's any trouble.

...There WILL be trouble!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Ravenholdt]]

==Progress==
Hiram Creed. Among the black dragons, he is known as "Creetharus."

==Completion==
Creed is finished. The Gilneans who followed his lead are on their own now - assuming his corrupted draconic blood works its way out of their system without killing them.

Either way they're no longer a concern of ours.

Flying into Gilneas teleports you back in front of [[Zazzo Twinklefingers]]:
:{{text|say|Zazzo Twinklefingers|One cannot simply FLY into Gilneas City!}}
:{{text|say|Zazzo Twinklefingers|Whoa whoa whoa - they've got snipers on all the rooftops. You'll have to go in by foot!}}
:{{text|say|Zazzo Twinklefingers|You can't just fly in there - you'll be spotted for sure. Don't you think we've already tried that?}}

Avoid the [[Blackhowl]] worgen who have Heightened Senses.

If you are found, Zazzo Twinklefingers will teleport you back to the start and say:
:{{text|say|Zazzo Twinklefingers|You see? They're wild animals in there!}}
:{{text|say|Zazzo Twinklefingers|You call that sneaking?}}
:{{text|say|Zazzo Twinklefingers|It's okay, <name>. I've got you... this time.}}
:{{text|say|Zazzo Twinklefingers|Watch out! That's how our other 12 assassins got killed.}}
:{{text|say|Zazzo Twinklefingers|Watch where you're going! They're everywhere in that city...}}

Getting to [[Lord Hiram Creed]]:
:{{text|whisper|Zazzo Twinklefingers|You made it! Creed's dark magic is disrupting my vision - you're on your own from here. Good luck!}}

After finishing the objective:
:''The player is teleported back to Zazzo.''
:{{text|say|Zazzo Twinklefingers|You did it!! You're my hero, <name>! Prince [[Wrathion]] will be delighted.}}

==Trivia==
*The name is a reference to the {{wp|Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed}} series.
*The quote Zazzo says when attempting to fly into the city is a reference to the "[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/one-does-not-simply-walk-into-mordor One does not simply walk into Mordor]" meme.
