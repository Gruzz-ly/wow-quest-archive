== Objectives ==
Investigate [[Dreadwatch Outpost]].
* Investigate Dreadwatch Outpost.

== Description ==
I'm not gonna lie to you, <name>. What I'm about to ask you to do is suicide. Chance of failure is about 95%.

All communication from Dreadwatch Outpost has been severed. With the [[worgen]] constantly rushing us we have no means by which to get to Dreadwatch to check on our soldiers. I need you to head south to the outpost and check on our soldiers. I'll keep in contact through the Forsaken communication device - F.C.D. - from here on out.

KEEP CLEAR OF THE MAIN ROAD.

== Progress ==
Status?

== Completion ==

<The F.C.D. crackles with static.>

Dreadwatch is lost? This is bad, <name>. Real bad.

If Dreadwatch is compromised it means we've lost [[Gilneas City]].
