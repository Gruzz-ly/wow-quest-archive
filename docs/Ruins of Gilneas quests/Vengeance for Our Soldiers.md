== Objectives ==
Kill 10 7th Legion Submariners.
* [[7th Legion Submariner]] slain (10)

== Description ==
[[7th Legion]]... They rushed us in the dead of the night. Their captain barked orders as the submariners slaughtered my men. Then he came to me, put his face in mine, and said something I'll never forget:

"The name's {{NPC||Pietro Zaren||Master Sergeant Pietro Zaren}}, officer in the 7th Legion. When you see your soldiers being slaughtered in your nightmares - if you even still dream - remember my name and tremble."

Avenge my soldiers! Kill the 7th Legion occupying the [[Cathedral Quarter]] of [[Gilneas City]], southwest of here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|War Blood Cloak
|Rutsak Carriers
|Submariner Killer
|War Blood Gloves
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

== Progress ==
The 7th Legion must pay for what they did!

== Completion ==
Though we were shamed in battle, the enemy was not victorious. I will not soon forget this, <name>.

If I make it back to [[Silverpine Forest|Silverpine]] I will likely retire from the service. War is not in my blood.
