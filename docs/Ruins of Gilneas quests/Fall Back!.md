{{questportrait|Forward Commander Onslaught.jpg|Forward Commander Onslaught|This is my final transmission.}}
== Objectives ==
Find [[Deathstalker Commander Belmont]] at [[Emberstone Village]] in the [[Ruins of Gilneas]].

== Description ==
<The F.C.D. buzzes.>

<Howls can be heard in the background.>

<name>, do you read me? Come in, <name>. This is likely my final transmission. The [[worgen]] have overrun [[Forsaken Forward Command]]. It is now only a matter of time before the base is lost. Belmont and the [[val'kyr]], {{NPC||Arthura}}, have left. Belmont mentioned that they will rendezvous with you at Emberstone Village, located to the northeast. Find Belmont, <name>. Our mission - our very existence - depends on it.

You are our final hope.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Emberstone Breastplate
|Bracers of the Final Transmission
|Wild Howl Dagger}}
You will also receive: {{cost||20}}

== Completion ==
Forward Commander Onslaught fought until the bitter end, <name>. It took a pack of bloodthirsty worgen to finally bring him down. We must not let his death, or the death of all of our soldiers in Gilneas, go in vain. Our mission MUST succeed.

Now I will reveal to you why we are here.
