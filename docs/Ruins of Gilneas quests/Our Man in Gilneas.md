This rogue-only quest is the fifth part of the chain to obtain the legendary dagger set [[Fangs of the Father]]. It is a simple travel quest from [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] to [[Ruins of Gilneas]].

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Zazzo Twinklefingers]] near the ruins of [[Gilneas City]] in [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]].

==Description==
If you wish to join my cause and slaughter the [[black dragonflight|black dragons]] in hiding, prove yourself by taking down [[Hiram Creed]]. He's amassing an army in Gilneas.

We haven't been able to slip past his defenders, but we've got a man on the scene keeping an eye on him. Zazzo Twinklefingers, a very crafty arcane mage, is waiting for us to contact him just outside of the ruins of the Gilnean capital.

Find him and he'll direct you to the target.

==Completion==
Ravenholdt sent you? I hope you're a better assassin than the others.
