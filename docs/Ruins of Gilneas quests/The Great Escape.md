== Objectives ==
Escape the [[Ruins of Gilneas]] with [[Arthura]] and the corpse of [[Lord Godfrey]].
* Escape the Ruins of Gilneas.

== Description ==
With our mission objective secured, the time has come for us to make our escape. Though Gilneas is lost, with the aid of Godfrey and his lieutenants we will have it back in no time at all.

Go now, <name>. Fly back with Arthura to the [[Forsaken Front]] in southern [[Silverpine Forest]]. The Banshee Queen awaits your arrival.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Treads of the True Plan
|Godfrey's Belt
|Cloak of Secret Purpose
|Godfrey's Waistband
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||22|60}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]
* +1,000 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

== Completion ==
I had no doubt that you would success, <name>. I hope you can understand why I kept the true purpose of your mission a secret. Should [[Darius Crowley|Crowley]] and [[Ivar Bloodfang|Bloodfang]] have found out about our plan, they would have surely gotten to Godfrey first and disposed of the body.

Stand by, <name>. The time of their rebirth is at hand.

== Notes ==
:{{text|say|Arthura|What about you, Belmont. How will you get back?}}
:{{text|say|Deathstalker Commander Belmont|I'll be fine, Arthura. The worgen lost our scent. It's doubtful that they even know we're here.}}
:{{text|say|Deathstalker Commander Belmont|I'll probably make it back to the Forsaken Front before you two, er, three.}}
:{{text|say|Deathstalker Commander Belmont|Now move out! You must not keep the Banshee Queen waiting.}}
:{{text|say|Arthura|So be it. Farewell, Belmont.}}
:''As you fly up from the shore, a group of worgen cast Frostbolts on you!''
:{{text|say|Arthura|Oh my... hang on tight!}}
:''Arthura keeps on flying, passing the Forsaken Forward Command where the worgen are howling, the Forsaken slain, the 7th Legion marching down the road and the structures burning.''
