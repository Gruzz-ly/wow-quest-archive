==Objectives==
Travel to [[Keel Harbor]] in the [[Ruins of Gilneas]].
* Let [[Genn Greymane|Genn]] know you are ready
* Arrive in [[Gilneas]]
* Talk to [[Tess Greymane|Tess]]

==Description==
The time has come to reclaim my kingdom, champion. The [[Forsaken]] have left the land, as promised.

However, in their absence it seems the [[Scarlet Crusade]] have decided to move in and use the city as their own personal stronghold. I mean to move them out. 

Join me in retaking Gilneas.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Gilneas will be ours once more.

==Completion==
Well then, looks like I'm in charge now.

A bit unexpected, but not unwelcome.

Very well. Let's do this.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Gilneas will be ours again. Let me know when you are ready.}}
:{{text|say|Mia Greymane|Thank you for offering your aid, <name>. I knew you'd come.}}

Mia has gossip:
{{book|content=Thank you for coming, <name>. Your support means a lot to me, and to Genn.

He may not be the most expressive of men, but he did not want to leave without you.

For him, that says everything.}}

As does Genn:
{{book|content=I will not allow anyone else to occupy Gilneas... not after everything we have been through.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to go to Gilneas.}}
}}
:''The player hops on the gryphon between Mia and Genn and they take off, flying north.''
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|I have little experience with the Scarlet Crusade. They rose to power after we walled off Gilneas.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|My understanding is that they were originally formed to eradicate the Scourge. A noble enough cause.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|But their zealotry has caused them to turn on any who did not join their crusade.}}
:''The scene fades to black. On the other side, the party has arrived in [[Keel Harbor]].''
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|What is this? Forsaken!}}
:{{text|say|Mia Greymane|Calm yourself, Genn. Tess is with them. Surely they have reason to be here.}}
:''They land at the dock.''
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Tess! What are they doing here?}}

Genn and Mia run up to [[Lilian Voss]], [[Tess Greymane|Princess Tess Greymane]], and [[Calia Menethil]], the Pallid Lady. Littering the area are the corpses of [[Scarlet Scout (Ruins of Gilneas)|Scarlet Scouts]].

The named characters all have gossip:
{{book|Mia Greymane|content=My daughter is as much a force to be reckoned with as my husband.

The Scarlet Crusade has no idea what it is about to face.}}
{{book|Genn Greymane|content=First the Forsaken, now the Scarlet Crusade--I won't allow anyone to take Gilneas from us again.

This is my kingdom. I will see these lands returned to my people.}}
{{book|Lilian Voss|content=The Forsaken army stands ready to assist the Gilneans in retaking their city.

Any chance to think out the Scarlet Crusade's numbers is a good one, no matter who they're fighting.}}
{{book|Calia Menethil|content=I had intended this to be another step in repairing relations between the Forsaken and the Gilneans. I only hope King Greymane sees our intentions for what they are.

His people have suffered enough.}}
{{book|Princess Tess Greymane|content=Attempting to take Gilneas by siege will result in carnage on both sides. 

The Forsaken are experts in dealing with the Scarlet Crusade. That's useful alone--but the Scarlets also hate them enough that any Forsaken presence will prove a useful distraction from our forces. 

That will give us the edge we need.
*{{gossip|quest=|How can the Forsaken help?}}
*{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Skip Conversation)}} I don't have time for this.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Princess Tess Greymane|They are here to help us retake Gilneas, Father.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|They are the reason we were driven out! Have you forgotten?}}
:{{text|say|Mia Greymane|Genn... it's Calia. Calia Menethil. Not some mindless Scourge. Let her speak.}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|The Forsaken know the Scarlet Crusade better than anyone, King Greymane.}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|You have little reason to trust us. But I give you my word, as a Menethil--we only wish to return what rightfully belongs to you.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Tess... every time I look at them, I see [[Liam Greymane|your brother]]'s face. I can't. I am sorry.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|But perhaps you can show me the way.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|What are your orders?}}

Also in town are [[Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig]] leading a squad of [[7th Legion Scout]]s, [[7th Legion Infantry]], [[7th Legion Sharpshooter]]s, and [[7th Legion Battlemage]]s.

{{book|Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig|content=The 7th Legion stands ready to assist with the reclamation of Gilneas. The bulk of our forces are with the main Gilnean Army. 

Gilneas will belong to the Gilneans once again.}}
