== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Wolfsbane.
* [[Wolfsbane]] (6)

== Description ==
{{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||The Dark Lady}} has sent you and {{NPC||Arthura}} here for a very specific purpose. Before I tell you more, we must make preparations.

Head east into the forest of [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]] and search near the trees and rocks of the region for a special plant known as wolfsbane. Gather as much of the wolfsbane as you can carry and return to me.

Our mission here goes far beyond the scope of the battlefield, <name>. In time, all will be revealed.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Belmont's Bracers
|Wolfsbane Vest
|Watched Watcher's Slippers
|Wolfsbane Harness
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

== Progress ==
Did you gather the wolfsbane?

== Completion ==
<Belmont takes the wolfsbane from you.>

Good. Now just do as {{NPC||Forward Commander Onslaught}} try. Try your best to fit in with the rest of the soldiers. We won't want the [[Gilneas Liberation Front]] to get suspicious.

Oh, you didn't know they were watching us? Right now there are five different worgen spies looking down on our position. Just be calm and follow orders. I'll let you know when we are ready to proceed.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
