== Objectives ==
Find the corpse of [[Lord Vincent Godfrey]].
* Lord Vincent Godfrey's corpse found

== Description ==
Lord Vincent Godfrey spent his life defending the [[Gilneas (kingdom)|kingdom of Gilneas]]. When the [[worgen]] curse ravaged this land, Godfrey was one of the first Gilneans to take up arms against the beasts. It is said that upon discovering that [[Genn Greymane|his king]] was afflicted by the curse, Godfrey took his own life. He would rather be dead than serve the very creatures that he had defended his home against.

We are going to give him a second chance, <name>. Together we will battle southeast towards [[Tempest's Reach]] to collect his corpse.

== Progress ==
Lord Vincent Godfrey. The name itself evokes feelings of dread in the hearts of worgen.

== Completion ==
Here we are, <name>. He is a little rotted, but no worse for the wear. We must hurry before the Alliance finds us!

== Notes ==
Walking a few steps outside the area automatically gives you the quest [[Resistance is Futile (quest)]].
