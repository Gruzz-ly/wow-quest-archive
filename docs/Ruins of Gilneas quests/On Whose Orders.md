== Objectives ==
Recover the Orders from High Command.
* [[Orders from High Command]]

== Description ==
<The F.C.D. buzzes.>

The [[7th Legion]] are an elite special ops regiment. They've been there, behind the scenes, for almost every major offensive and military engagement the [[Alliance]] has ever done. This is bad news. How did they get past our warships? And on whose orders are they here?

We need to get our hands on their orders. This [[Master Sergeant Pietro Zaren|Pietro]] character will undoubtedly have vital information. Find him at the [[Cathedral Quarter]] in [[Gilneas City]] and take him out. Search his corpse for clues.

== Progress ==
Status?

== Completion ==

<The F.C.D. crackles with electricity.>

An Alliance armada is en route? How could this have happened?

<Forward Commander Onslaught cuts out for a moment. You hear worgen howling in the background.>

You've got to hurry, <name>. We're being overrun up here at [[Forsaken Forward Command|Forward Command]].
