'''Feed Your Soul''' is a post-[[Rule 5: Be Audacious]] daily quest in the [[Perdition Hold]] of the [[Maw]]. 

==Objectives==
Reclaim anima to empower the Vengeful Soul and defeat Inquisitor Moorlac with their help.

Suggested Players [3]
* [[Vengeful Soul]] strengthened with [[anima]] (0/100%)
* [[Inquisitor Moorlac]] slain {{co|25.2|55.1|Maw}}

==Description==
They... drained my anima... to fuel their ritual...

Souls of great power are brought here... to this altar... and sacrificed to conjure unspeakable horrors bound to [[the Jailer]].

I was powerful once... Imbue me with the anima they stole... and I can be powerful again.

Then, together... we will destroy the one who leads their efforts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 225x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Quite the tale, <name>. Few motivations are as potent as revenge.

==Notes==
To fill up the bar, interact with [[Sealed Urns]] and kill [[Mawsworn Conqueror]]s, [[Vengeful Shade]]s, and [[Master Shadeweaver]]s.

At 100%:
:{{text|say|Vengeful Soul|Anima courses through me... my power returns!}}

Once full, head inside and defeat [[Inquisitor Moorlac]]:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Moorlac|Your actions here change nothing!}}
:{{text|say|Vengeful Soul|Leave me here! I will have my vengeance on the rest of them!}}
