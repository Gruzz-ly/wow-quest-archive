==Objectives==
[[File:Twisted Mawstone.jpg|thumb|Twisted Mawstone]]
Collect 8 Ebon Runeblades and build a monument to the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Ebon Blade's]] sacrifice in the [[Crucible of the Damned]].
* [[Ebon Runeblade]] (8)

==Description==
<Corpses of Ebon Blade knights litter the Crucible of the Damned, displaying the aftermath of [[Through the Shattered Sky|your first foray]] into this desolate place.

Their sacrifice should not be forgotten.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
<This precipice is highly visible throughout the Maw. 

Building the monument here will surely draw the Jailer's ire.>

==Completion==

<The Ebon Blade monument radiates with energy from the fallen knights' runeblades.

It is a small tribute to their sacrifice, but it will have to do.>

==Notes==
On the bridge over [[Gorgoa: River of Souls]] in the [[Crucible of the Damned]], the corpse of a [[Knight of the Ebon Blade]] starts this quest. [[Ebon Runeblade]]s light up in the area.

Gathering the eighth runeblade adds 500 points of threat (50% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
