'''Prison of the Forgotten''' begins the [[Runecarver]] storyline in [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned]]. Players will start this quest in the process of saving [[Baine Bloodhoof]] during [[The Search for Baine]].

==Objectives==
Take the object back to Ve'nari.
*Speak with [[Ve'nari]] {{co|46.9|41.7|Maw}}
*Find a [[Domination Lock]] within Torghast's antechamber.
*[[The Forgotten Key]] (provided)

==Description==
;The Forgotten Key
<As you stare at the object you've found, you wonder if it may lead you to some other part of this forsaken tower.

Perhaps Ve'nari may know more of its purpose.>

;Ve'nari
I discovered an interesting item off the Warden you killed in the tower. 

Best not to ask how I know what you do and where you do it within the tower. Let's just say, I have my ways.

But this key could lead to something interesting within Torghast. Or something horrible. Most likely horrible.

You ought to explore a bit and see what it unlocks.

==Progress==
<The lock appears to be sturdy, yet old and untouched. Dust has collected considerably upon it.>

==Completion==
<As you place the key into the device, it shudders for a moment and begins to unlock.>

==Notes==
In Torghast during [[The Search for Baine]], defeat [[Warden Arkoban]] on floor six to loot the key that starts this quest. Exit Torghast and check in with Ve'nari:
:You were not followed, were you?

{{gossip|(Quest) This was carried by Warden Arkoban. Do you know what it does?}} -OR- {{gossip|(Quest) This was carried by one of the Jailer's more powerful guards. Do you know what it does?}}
:I believe this is a key, of sorts, to a chamber within Torghast.
:Search the antechamber for a device that will accept it.
:Where it leads after that... I could only speculate.

;If Baine is still in tow
:I do, and I shall tell you after you see to it that your friend there is in [[Oribos]].
:Come back to me once he is safe.

Head back in to Torghast and turn south to the [[Domination Lock]]. This unlocks a portal to the [[Runecarver's Oubliette]]. Take the portal to reach the [[Runecarver]], who continues a quest chain of his own with [[Deep Within]].
