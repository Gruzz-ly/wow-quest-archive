'''Trust Issues''' is offered by [[Ve'rayn]] after players accept [[Explore Torghast]]. She spawns next to the runes at the [[Ring of Transference]] and will follow the player around until they pick up the quest.

==Objectives==
Answer [[Ve'rayn|Ve'rayn's]] questions about the [[Maw]].
*Ve'rayn's questions answered

==Description==
Ah, [[Maw Walker]]! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ve'rayn. I deal with assets and liabilities for [[Cartel Ve]].

I have heard that you are able to freely travel between [[Oribos]] and the Maw, a place of great interest to my cartel.

Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about it?

You will, of course, be properly compensated for your time and information. They are the most valuable of commodities, after all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|87}}

==Progress==
This should be fast. I am sure you have many tasks to which you must attend.

==Completion==
Cartel Ve was asking you questions about me?

I'm flattered. Make sure you never tell them anything.

Ever.

Come. There's work to do.

==Notes==
: {{text|say|Ve'rayn|Maw Walker! I need just a moment of your time.}}

Speak with Ve'rayn:
:I appreciate your willingness to provide us with your knowledge of the Maw.
:Question one: 
:Is it true that [[The Jailer|the Jailer's]] [[mawsworn|forces]] have grown in both strength and number?
{{gossip|Yes, the Jailer's forces have grown more powerful since [[Denathrius|Denathrius's]] betrayal.}}
:Ah, so it remains quite a dangerous place in which to conduct business. That leads to my next inquiry.
:Question two! 
:Do you find it challenging to survive amidst the oppressive and unceasing horrors within the Maw?
*{{gossip|Absolutely. It takes everything I have just to stay alive.}}
*{{gossip|It's a challenge, but I can overcome it.}}
*{{gossip|I eat monsters like the Jailer for breakfast. Ever heard of the [[Burning Legion]]?}}
*{{gossip|I'm sorry, what did you say this was for?}}
:Of course, of course. That brings me to my final question.
:As you have braved the Maw, has Ve'nari proven to be a valuable ally to you?
:<Before you answer, you remember that Ve'nari specifically told you not to mention your arrangement to anyone.>
{{gossip|Ve'nari? Who is Ve'nari?}}
:Oh, I'm sure you are quite familiar with her by now. There is no way a mortal like you could survive an excursion to the Maw without her assistance.
:Tell me everything about your dealings with Ve'nari.
:If she has chosen not to return to Oribos with you, then she will have questions to answer as well.
{{gossip|I have never met anyone named Ve'nari.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'rayn|I see... how unfortunate. A word of advice, Maw Walker: Be careful who you trust. Especially within the Maw.}}
:''Ve'rayn walks away.''

Jump in to the Maw to turn in to Ve'nari.

==Progression==
{{New Rules}}

==Trivia==
In beta, some of the options were:
*{{gossip|I eat monsters like the Jailer for breakfast. Ever heard of [[Burning Legion|the Legion]]? THAT was a threat. And they fought with [[legion ship|ships]], not [[Sylvanas Windrunner|an undead elf who breaks helmets]].}}
*{{gossip|Challenging? Call me when the Jailer [[Kairozdormu|breaks the space time continuum]] and creates an [[Draenor (alternate universe)|alternate reality on a different planet in the past]].}}

The third completion line was:
:I'm flattered. Make sure you never speak about me to them.
