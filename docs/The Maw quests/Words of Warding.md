'''Words of Warding''' is a weekly [[Perdition Hold]] quest, offered to players who have unlocked the area by completing [[Rule 5: Be Audacious]] at Tentative standing with [[Ve'nari]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Cloaked Ward.jpg|thumb|Cloaked Ward]]

Steal an Assassin's Soulcloak and dispel 4 Runes of Warding within [[Perdition Hold]] in [[Maw|The Maw]].
* [[Assassin's Soulcloak]]
* [[Cloaked Ward]] dispelled (4)
Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
The towering citadel in the distance is protected by perilous walls, but its greatest dangers cannot be seen with mortal eyes.

The Mawsworn have placed invisible runes of warding throughout Perdition Hold. These traps have caught many intruders unaware.

The runes can be dispelled, but only if you can see them. I believe one of their soulcloaks should give you the sight you require.

Good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|77|22|}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +1400 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]
*700x [[Stygia]]

==Progress==
Are the wards gone? I am eager to resume surveillance of our enemy.

==Completion==
I trust you did not let your eyes wander while wearing the soulcloak? It can reveal some truly terrible things... 

==Notes==
Back south through the [[Face of Oblivion]]. Don't go inside the main gate, but instead loop around to the southeast. Inside, find and kill [[Spectral Assassin (Maw)|Spectral Assassins]] until they drop the [[Assassin's Soulcloak]], then immediately use it to go invisible. The buff has a two-minute duration and the item is reusable, so take all the time necessary. 

[[Cloaked Ward]]s look like anima caches from inside Torghast. Note that interacting with one will drop the player out of invisibility, so keep that in mind if hostiles are nearby. It is possible to use the cloak in combat, which will drop combat.

Note that looting the cloak immediately adds 600 points of threat (60% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]], and dispelling the fourth ward adds another 600 points.

;Description
The towering citadel in the distance is protected by walls, but the most dangerous defenses are the ones you don't see with your eyes. Powerful [[Mawsworn]] use an innocent [[soul]]'s [[anima]] to paint runes of warding throughout the space, which alert the Mawsworn to intruders.

These runes can be dispelled, but seeing their inner workings is impossible in this phase of existence. Stealing an Assassin's Soulcloak should give you the sight you need to dispel the wards.
