==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bolvar Fordragon]] in [[Oribos]].
*Use the [[Waystone to Oribos]] (Optional) {{co|42.4|42.2|Maw}}

==Description==
The terms of our bargain have been met. You may depart with the souls you acquired.

Perhaps the fate of this "[[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]]" is of interest to you or your allies. I suggest you return to Oribos and consult them.

No need to rush. After all, those held within [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]] are tortured for centuries.

Kindly remember not to tell anyone about our arrangement. Discretion is key between business partners, after all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>! The darkness of the Maw lingers upon you. What news do you bring?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|You really shouldn't linger here. The Jailer doesn't like having his toys taken away... even ones he discarded. Go on. Back to Oribos with you!}}

Ve'nari has some dailies. Complete them or not, then take the [[Waystone to Oribos]] back to civilization.

Bolvar will not offer the Torghast-unlocking quest ([[Into Torghast]]) until players complete the first chapter of their covenant campaign. Return to Oribos at that point.

==Progression==

;Description
The terms of our bargain have been met. It is time for you to depart with the souls you acquired.

I can see you are concerned about your friend being taken to [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]].

Fear not, you will have plenty of time to plan his rescue after you return to Oribos. Those in the tower are tortured for centuries.

Oh, and do remember to tell no one about our arrangement.
