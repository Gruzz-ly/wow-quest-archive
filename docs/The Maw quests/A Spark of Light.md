==Objectives==
[[File:Eye of Damnation.png|thumb|Crucible Soulseeker]]
Defeat 4 Eyes of Damnation.
* [[Crucible Soulseeker]] slain (4)
* [[Cypher of Blinding]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Gorgoa: River of Souls|Gorgoa]] is a protean force fueled by [[soul]]s that trickle in from many [[planet|worlds]]. They wash in from the head of the river, a place they have named the [[Crucible of the Damned]].

[[The Jailer]]'s unblinking eyes patrol the river and watch for souls who attempt escape.

Blind the eyes that find them. Close them for good.

Take this and do what must be done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 425x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +850 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Have you closed the Jailer's eyes?

==Completion==
Well done, Maw Walker. The Jailer's eyes are dangerous, indeed.

==Notes==
Down south in the [[Crucible of the Damned]], [[Crucible Soulseeker]]s stand watch, rather than the usual [[Mawsworn Soulseeker]]s. Use the provided [[Cypher of Blinding]] to stun them for a few seconds if necessary.

Completing the objective by killing the fourth adds 1000 points (100% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].

==Beta version==
