==Description==
<The tortured embodiment of the soul before you burns with magmatic flame. Whatever purpose it was meant for here in the cauldron has since been served.

The complete disregard for the remaining husk of this soul is unsettling. These efforts will continue if something isn't done.

Send the inhabitants of Zovaal's Cauldron a message.>
