==Objectives==
Bring the Coldheart Flight Routes to [[Ve'nari]] at [[Ve'nari's Refuge]].
* [[Coldheart Flight Routes]]

==Description==
<These diagrams contain detailed information concerning the patrols of the [[Mawsworn]] [[Kyrian]].

Ve'nari would relish this knowledge.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
This will help mitigate the Mawsworn's aerial advantage. Caution must still be exercised, of course.

Do try to avoid their notice whenever possible. I would hate for one of them to follow you here.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
