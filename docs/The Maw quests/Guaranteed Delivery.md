==Description==
<The broker appears to be from [[Cartel Ve]]. Perhaps they were once an associate of Ve'nari.

Clutched in their hand is a list of items and a containment orb.

Finishing this broker's task and sending the items back to Ve'nari will surely earn you some compensation.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 225x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
What have you collected, <class>?

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>. I wondered what had become of that particular associate. 

It pleases me to know that their demise was not a complete loss.

==Notes==
There are two versions of this quest, but both play out the same way.

Use the quest item on objects in [[Perdition Hold]]. Note that this will likely aggro nearby enemies.

Completing the objective of this quest adds 667 points of threat (66.7% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
