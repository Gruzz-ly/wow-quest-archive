==Objectives==
[[File:Death Mote.png|thumb|Death Mote]]
Collect Death Motes from [[Ruin's Cradle]].
* [[Death Mote]] collected (12)

==Description==
I have a task for you, Maw Walker.

[[Soul]]s deemed suitable for service among the [[Mawsworn]] are broken down to their barest essence. The resulting creature forms a black [[shade]], devoid of all individual will.

It is a tragic end.

I wish to better understand this process--what is it about a soul that causes this transformation?

Fragments of broken souls rain down across Ruin's Cradle. Bring me some of them, so that I might learn more about our common adversaries.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 425x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +850 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Do you have the fragments?

==Completion==
It is perhaps... ethically questionable to benefit from these motes, given their source. 

But such knowledge may prove vital in defeating our enemies.

==Notes==
Looting the tenth mote will add 1000 points of threat (100% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].

==Beta version==

;Description
Souls deemed suitable for service among the Mawsworn are broken down to their barest essence. The resulting creature forms a black shade, devoid of all personal will.

Though you cannot stop this process alone, you can help me understand it. Fragments of broken souls rain down across Ruin's Cradle. Bring me some of those fragments, and I shall learn more about our common enemy.
