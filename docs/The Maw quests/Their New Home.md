'''Their New Home''' concludes the week two of the [[Night Fae Campaign]]. At [[Renown (Shadowlands)]] 8, first achievable the week of December 8, the next chapter unlocks, starting with [[On De Other Side]].

==Objectives==
Take [[Shandris Feathermoon]] and the rescued night elf souls to [[Ysera]] at the [[Heart of the Forest]] in [[Ardenweald]].
* [[Night elf]] [[soul]]s brought to Ysera in Ardenweald
*Speak with Ysera to release Night Elf souls
*Return to Ysera in the Heart of the Forest.

==Description==
It pains me to leave my [[Tyrande Whisperwind|mother]] behind... but the souls of my people must be brought to safety.

I heard the [[attendant]]s in [[Oribos]] speaking of a place called Ardenweald. A [[Plane|realm]] of ancient forests where the spirits of [[nature]] slumber.

This is a land you know well, is it not? I would see its wonders with my own eyes.

Perhaps the spirits there will know how to save my [[Darnassian|minn'do]] from the [[Night Warrior]]'s power.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Faewoven Tunic
|Oakheart Tunic
|Runewarden's Hauberk
|Queensguard Chestplate
|Faewoven Raiment
|Oakheart Vestment
|Runewarden's Vestment
}}

You will also receive:
* [[Emblem of Renown]]
* {{cost|77|22}}
* 11,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You've returned. But what of the others?

==Completion==
My heart aches for Tyrande. The might of the Night Warrior is empowering her to battle these monsters... but it will consume her if we do nothing.

Shandris and I will investigate a... promising whisper that I have heard. I shall call upon you when I know more.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I will not give up on my mother. But for now, we must help these souls find peace. Come, let us leave this place.}}

Get back to Ardenweald by any means. No need to hop through Oribos if a [[Hearthstone]] will suffice.

:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Ysera! It is a wonder to see you awakened once more!}}
:{{Text|say|Ysera|My spirit was nearly lost. The touch of the Winter Queen awakened me. Now I am bound to this realm.}}
:{{Text|say|Ysera|I sense kaldorei spirits in your soulkeeper, <name>. Release them to the wilds of Ardenweald.}}

Speak with Ysera:
:<Ysera smiles warmly at you.>
<!-- *Such a beautiful place.... -->
:{{gossip|I'm ready to release the night elf souls into Ardenweald.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|What will happen to these souls?}}
:{{Text|say|Ysera|They will find peace and respite here. Some may even choose new forms and help tend the groves.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Ysera, I... failed to bring Tyrande back. She still wanders the Maw, fueled by the Night Warrior's might. And driven by a relentless rage.}}
:{{Text|say|Ysera|Do not let your heart be troubled, young one. There may be another one who can aid us in saving Tyrande Whisperwind.}}

This concludes the "Daughter of the Night Warrior" chapter of the [[Night Fae Campaign]]. At Renown 8, the [[Mask of Bwonsamdi]] starts the next quest: [[On De Other Side]].
