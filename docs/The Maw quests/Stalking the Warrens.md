==Objectives==
Complete a Hunt in The [[Beastwarrens]].
* Hunt completed
* Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
So, they are creating magical beasts deep within the Warrens. Their power is... substantial.

Maw Walker, I must trust in you to handle this. While I can provide insight, in combat I must admit your prowess exceeds my own.

Hunt the beasts that they train to hunt us. Show the Mawsworn that we too can bare fangs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What game have you cornered, Maw Walker?

==Completion==
I suspect this will not be your last foray into the Warrens.
