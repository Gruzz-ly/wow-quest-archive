==Objectives==
Collect 9 Runeforged Shackles and return them to [[Ve'nari]] in the [[Maw]].
* [[Runeforged Shackles]] (provided) (9)

==Description==
<The chains here are carved with [[domination]] runes, imbuing them with the [[magic]] needed to subdue the most powerful of the [[Mawsworn]]'s [[prisoner]]s.

No doubt Ve'nari could find some use in studying these runes.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*140 [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Another transaction?

==Completion==
Chains? Not exactly hard to find around here... wait, those runes...

You have a keen eye, indeed. The magic here is worth further study.

==Notes==
The quest-starting shackle counts as one, so eight more are required. Shackles are all over [[Ruin's Cradle]].

Looting the ninth shackle will add 500 points of threat (50% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
