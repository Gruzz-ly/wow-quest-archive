==Objectives==
Collect 15 pieces of Stygic Ore in [[Marrow's Coppice]] and return them to [[Ve'nari]] in the [[Maw]].
* [[Stygic Ore]] (15)
*Return to Ve'nari at Ve'nari's Refuge.

==Description==
<The rock columns in this area are teeming with veins of a glowing, otherworldly metal.

The [[Mawsworn]] have employed [[soul]]s to mine it, but it looks like they didn't last long.

Ve'nari could certainly find use for some of this ore, if you can manage to mine it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
What do you carry, Maw Walker?

==Completion==
Fascinating, the metal here seems to be fabricated entirely of stygia!

There is much I can do with this. Take this reward, with my thanks.

==Notes==
In [[Marrow's Coppice]], look for the [[Spectral Pick]] that starts this quest. Stygic Ore Veins are close by, and each one contains 1-3 [[Stygic Ore]]. Rogues can mine it in Stealth.

Collecting the fifteenth piece of [[Stygic Ore]] will add 500 points of threat (50% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
