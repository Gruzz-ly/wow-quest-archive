'''Rule 6 Footnote: Don't Forget Anything''' is a breadcrumb to [[Rule 6 Addendum: Save Me At Any Cost]] should players not pick it up while in the area. Ve'nari will encourage players to return to the questgiver, [[Ve'brax]].

==Objectives==
Look for whatever was left behind by the [[broker]]s in the [[Beastwarrens]].

==Description==
In the [[Maw]], you must never forget something.

Many things crawl within the Beastwarrens. It would do well for you to go back and ensure nothing of value was left.

These runes you gave me indicate there may be something useful left behind by the brokers in the Beastwarrens.

See if you can find it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're back! Thank goodness... I thought my one chance at salvation had slipped away!

You will save me, yes?

==Progression==
