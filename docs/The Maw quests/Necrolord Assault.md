The '''Necrolord Assault''' is one of four bi-weekly [[Chains of Domination campaign#Covenant assaults|covenant assaults]] on the [[Maw]] in [[patch 9.1]]. This assault focuses on [[Perdition Hold]].

Taking part in the assault are most of the friendly players in the Necrolords, including [[Draka]], [[Baroness Vashj]], [[Margrave Sin'dane]], [[Gunn Gorgebone]], [[Vassili Freeshot]], [[Rathan]], [[Winslow Swan]], [[Kearnen the Blade]], [[Cutter Fin]], [[Secutor Mevix]], [[Plague Deviser Marileth]], [[Felicia Night]], [[Kevin]], [[Bloop]], [[Ooz]], and [[Plaguey]]. The [[necropolis]] [[Zerekriss]] is seen in the Maw, sieging [[Perdition Hold]] and bombarding the [[Altar of Domination]].

During this assault, members of the [[Necrolord Covenant]] have the portal in the [[Seat of the Primus]] that normally transports them to [[Zerekriss]] in Maldraxxus take them to Zerekriss in the Maw instead, with [[Twigin]] present to take players down to Perdition Hold.

All four of the [[Quartered Ancient Ring]] items for the [[Nilganihmaht's Stone Ring]] can be found in and around Perdition Hold during the assault. The stone ring is one of five for the [[Nilganihmaht Control Ring]].

:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|The Necrolords march on the Altar of Domination. Join us and lead the charge!}}

Head to the front gate of [[Perdition Hold]] and speak with [[Baroness Draka]]:
:The battle is fierce, <name>. Your skills are greatly needed.
{{gossip|I am ready to assist you.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|You have arrived just in time, <name>.}}

After picking up Draka's quests:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Meet me in Perdition Hold when you are done.}}
:{{text|yell|Baroness Draka|The Mawsworn tremble at our might! Blood and thunder!}}

Pick up and complete the four available quests, then turn in to Draka, just inside:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|We must push forward! Maw Walker, signal the advance!}}

Use the bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Signal To Advance|Signal troops to press the attack.|icon=inv_misc_horn_05}}

:{{text|say|Prime Shieldguard|They were no match for us!}}
:{{text|say|Prime Gatecrasher|We have them on the run!}}

Cross the bridge to the [[Altar of Domination]]:
