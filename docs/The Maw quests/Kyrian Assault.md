==Walkthrough==
:{{text|say|Xandria|The minions of the Jailer forge a vile monstrosity within Zovaal's Cauldron. We must destroy it.}}

The [[kyrian]] and [[venthyr]] are just outside [[Ve'nari's Refuge]]. Check in with Xandria:
:The battle is fierce <name>, your skills are greatly needed.
{{gossip|I am ready to assist you.}}

Pick up and complete the four available quests, then check in with Xandria again:
:{{text|say|Xandria|The colossus nears completion! Ascended, to me! We strike at once!}}
:Now is the time to strike! Are you ready to fly with me?
{{gossip|Let's fly, Xandria.}}

This starts a bombing run:
:{{text|yell|Xandria|Take to the skies, Ascended! For Bastion!}}

Players have access to two abilities:
:{{abilities|Anima Javelin|Fires a javelin of charged anima at targets within a 10 yard radius.|range=100|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant}}
:{{abilities|Kyrian Strafing Run|Instruct three Kyrain Avengers to strafe selected area for holy damage.|range=100|cd=8 sec|notes=Instant}}

:{{text|yell|Xandria|Let the rain of justice cleanse this ground!}}

Take out anything that moves, including:
*Forge Summoner (6-7%)
*Ascendant of Flame (2%)

Fill the bar:
:{{text|say|Xandria|Serve with courage.}}
:{{text|say|Xandria|Now is our chance! Reduce that hideous monstrosity to rubble!}}
:{{text|say|Xandria|Archon's eyes upon us all.}}

Xandria lands a short distance from the [[Flameforged Colossus]], reduced to 50% health after the bombing run. Aggro it and a bunch of Valiant Protectors fly in. Help them take it out. Once it runs out of health, a cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Xandria|We shall purge your blight...now!}}
:{{text|say|Xandria|For the Archon!}}

On the other side of the cutscene, Xandria flies the Maw Walker back to camp.
:{{text|say|Xandria|A courageous display, Maw Walker. We shall continue the fight.}}
