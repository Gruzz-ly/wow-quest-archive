# Shadowlands intro experience

[[File:Mawsworn Soulbearer.jpg|thumb|A Mawsworn Soulbearer in Icecrown]]
The '''Shadowlands intro experience''' comprises the first three storylines of the [[Shadowlands campaign]]. [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] has shattered the [[Helm of Domination]] and torn a hole in the veil between the [[Azeroth|mortal plane]] and the [[Shadowlands|realm of death]] above the [[Frozen Throne]] upon [[Icecrown Citadel]]. Several faction leaders have been kidnapped for Sylvanas' unknown purpose.

It's up to the champion and the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Ebon Blade]] to venture through the veil and save reality!

==Death Rising==

Prior to the launch of Shadowlands itself, the pre-launch event played out in a limited-time two-week quest chain (and associated daily quests) alongside other pre-patch content during the [[Death Rising]] event.

==The Maw==

Having already lost contact with [[Anduin Wrynn]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Thrall]], and [[Jaina Proudmoore]] after [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] and the [[Mawsworn]] kyrian have kidnapped them, [[Bolvar Fordragon]], the current [[Lich King]], calls upon other representatives of the Alliance and Horde to come up with a plan to recover them from the [[Maw]].

As is tradition, the plan immediately goes awry and it's up to [[Darion Mograine]] and the [[adventurer|champion]] to step up and escape.

This portion of the intro experience can be skipped by speaking with [[High Inquisitor Whitemane]] or [[Nazgrim]] in [[Orgrimmar]] or [[Stormwind]] and picking the gossip option:
{{dialogue|
{{gossip|I have heard this tale before. {{text|red|<Skip the Maw introduction. Oribos awaits.>}}}}
}}

Completing the initial Maw storyline awards the achievement [[Into the Maw (achievement)]].

{{Through the Shattered Sky}}

==Threads of Fate==

Alts of players who have already completed the level-up campaign, earned the [[Choosing Your Purpose (achievement)]] achievement, and completed the first chapter of their covenant campaign will be offered a choice by [[Fatescribe Roh-Tahl]], once they make it out of the Maw and land in Oribos. Players can choose to play through the level-up campaign again, or twist the threads of fate: immediately choose a covenant, start working on renown, and level through world quests/side quests/bonus objectives, and dungeons.

If alts choose to go down this road they will be locked in and cannot play through the level-up campaign. However, alts on the level-up campaign can choose to speak to the fatescribe at any time.

==Oribos==

After escaping alone from the Jailer's forces bearing down on them at the Maw, the player appears at [[Oribos]], the Eternal City, with some unpleasantly surprised guards noticing the player's arrival. Take a few moments to learn the lay of the land and of the greater situation involving the anima drought before moving on to [[Bastion]].

{{Stranger in an Even Stranger Land}}

==Onwards to Bastion==
The champion uses some of the last of Oribos' [[anima]] to open the way to [[Bastion]], starting the [[Shadowlands campaign]] in earnest in the [[Bastion storyline]]'s first quest: [[Welcome to Eternity]].
