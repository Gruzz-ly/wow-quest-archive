==Objectives==
[[File:Misery Conduit.jpg|thumb|Southern Misery Conduit]]
Collect 10 Essences of Misery and destroy the [[Misery Conduit]]s.
* [[Essence of Misery]] (10)
* Southern Misery Conduit destroyed {{co|26.5|43.6|Maw}}
* Northern Misery Conduit destroyed {{co|35.3|26.1|Maw}}

==Description==
The [[Mawsworn]] have begun harvesting the misery of the souls flowing through [[Gorgoa]], the river of souls.

Why? I do not know yet. But it behooves us to stop them.

Destroy the conduits that they deposit the misery into and bring me some samples of their work.

Perhaps with some research, I can discern their intentions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 425x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +850 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Have you halted their misery?

==Completion==
Your burden is great, but today you have saved souls from damnation.

==Notes==
An [[Essence of Misery]] will drop from [[Resonant Misery]] and [[Mawsworn Collector]]s in [[Gorgoa: River of Souls]], and the two conduits are marked on the map.

Each of the three objectives is worth 333 threat (33% of a level) of the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
