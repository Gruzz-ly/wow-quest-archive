'''Gotta Hand It To Ya''' awards the [[Nilganihmaht Control Ring]]. To be offered this quest, players must find and return the five bands of Nilganihmaht in both the normal and [[Rift (Shadowlands)|The Rift]] phases of the [[Maw]]. See the Control Ring article for more information on the five bands and where to turn them in to.

==Objectives==
Accept Nilganihmaht's help.

==Description==
Your power [[Maw Walker]]... it rivals even mine before [[The Jailer|Zovaal]] separated my body.

This is but a small part of my whole, but more than enough...

Allow me to aid you in your efforts against Zovaal. In doing so my vengeance will be fulfilled.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Nilganihmaht Control Ring]]

==Completion==
<The five rings glow and morph their power coalescing into a small ring that would perfectly fit your finger.>

<Nilganihmaht's voice booms in your head>

Let us embark from this place and bring down Zovaal together.

==Patch changes==
