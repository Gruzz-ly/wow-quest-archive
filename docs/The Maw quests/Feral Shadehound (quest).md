The '''Feral Shadehound''' quest is the last step to acquire the [[Bound Shadehound]] mount, one of three that works in the [[Maw]]. To start this quest, combine the [[Armored Husk (item)]] and the [[Willing Wolf Soul]] at the [[Binding Altar]] in [[Cocyrus]]. See the Bound Shadehound article for more information.

==Objectives==
Summon and bind your Feral Shadehound.
*Summon and bind your [[Feral Shadehound]].
*[[Summon Feral Shadehound]] (provided)

==Description==
<The runed armor husk pulses with power and seems to struggle for its freedom.

Release your feral shadehound and bind it to you.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Bound Shadehound]]

==Completion==
The Shadehound will now serve as your mount.

==Notes==
Get to an area without enemies and far from any edges of the Maw. Use the provided [[Summon Feral Shadehound]] to do what it says on the tin. The feral shadehound will run forward uncontrollably once summoned, and it will happily take the player with it off the edge of the zone. A good spot is at {{co|46.3|40.6|Maw}} in [[Ve'nari's Refuge]] pointed at the nook of the wall.

While mounted, players will be in the vehicle interface.
