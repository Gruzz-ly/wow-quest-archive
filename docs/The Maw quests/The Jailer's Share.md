==Objectives==
Place 4 Stygia Conduits at marked locations within [[Calcis]] in The [[Maw]].
* [[Stygia Conduit]] placed (4)

==Description==
The [[Mawsworn]]'s torturers have a talent for misery.

The suffering they inflict often produces more stygia than they can collect. The excess floats loosely in the air, left to drift into the abyss.

I have fashioned a conduit specifically for capturing the leftover stygia. You can borrow it if you wish.

There are a handful of prime gathering locations throughout Calcis. As you'll be using my conduits, we can split what you find upon your return.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +850 [[reputation]] with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Were the conduits effective? How much stygia did they collect?

==Completion==
It is satisfying to know that the Jailer's share now belongs to us. Well done, Maw Walker.
