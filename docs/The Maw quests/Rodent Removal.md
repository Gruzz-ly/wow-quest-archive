'''Rodent Removal''' is a [[Beastwarrens]] daily quest in the [[Maw]]. In the [[Ravener's Lament]], look for the corpse of a [[Mawsworn Tormentor]] and two [[Giant Mawrat]]s.

==Objectives==
Test the Tormentor's Rod on 8 [[Giant Mawrat]]s in [[Beastwarrens|The Beastwarrens]].
* Mawrats exploded (8)
* [[Tormentor's Rod]] (provided)

==Description==
<The weapon buzzes with a dark, static energy. Whatever this Mawsworn was testing, it appears to have been somewhat successful on the nearby rodents.

Further investigation may yield additional information.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

== Progress ==
Find something of interest?

==Completion==
Serves them right for leaving this unattended.

I am sure we can find other uses for it.

==Notes==
Knock [[Giant Mawrat]]s down to <35% health, then use the quest item.

Exploding the eight mawrat will add 500 points of threat (50% of a level) of the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
