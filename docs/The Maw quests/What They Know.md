==Objectives==
Collect 18 Torn Journal Pages in the [[Hungering Wastes]] and return them to [[Ve'nari]] in the [[Maw]].
* [[Torn Journal Page (Maw)]] (18)

==Description==
<It looks like this [[broker]] was gathering information before he met his unfortunate end. Ve'nari would likely be very interested in what he found.

Unfortunately, his notes look to have been scattered far and wide by the local beasts.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
That book... that is a pathfinder's journal you carry!

==Completion==
It would seem that Cartel Ve has not given up their pursuit of the Maw.

You did well to bring me this pathfinder's journal. Whatever the cartel has learned about this place will surely serve us better than it would a corpse.

==Notes==
Near the corpse of a [[Cartel Ve Pathfinder]], it's [[Broker Journal]] starts this quest. Look for Torn Pages in the [[Hungering Wastes]] of the [[Beastwarrens]].

This daily quest adds 500 points of threat to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
