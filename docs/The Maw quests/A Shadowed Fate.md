==Objectives==
Free 6 Tormented Souls in [[Ruin's Cradle]] by stomping out the [[Circle of Agony|Circles of Agony]] binding them.
* [[Tormented Soul (Maw)|Tormented Soul]] released  (6)

==Description==
The [[Mawsworn]]... torture and torment [[soul]]s within Ruin's Cradle.

I... barely escaped, but I'm afraid I won't last long.

Their twisted rituals... breaking souls to serve as wretched shades.

Spare them this fate!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
You have... saved these souls from a terrible fate.

Even a... true end... cannot be worse than this torment...

==Notes==
The Circle of Agony objects are ''not'' shared, so other players can steal them. Interacting with the object will either free the Tormented Soul immediately, or release a hostile [[Tormented Shade]], which is shareable, but must be killed.

Completing the objective of this quest adds 500 points (50% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]]. Note that the turn in point is the Tormented Soul that started this quest up in the [[Planes of Torment]], not [[Ve'nari]].
