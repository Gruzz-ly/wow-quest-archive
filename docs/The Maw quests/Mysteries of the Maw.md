[[File:Mysteries of the Maw - flying to the Beastwarrens.jpg|thumb|Ve'nari and the Maw Walker flying to the Beastwarrens]]

==Objectives==
Travel with [[Ve'nari]] to the site of the [[Korthia|new landmass]] within the [[Maw]]
*Animaflow teleporter used {{co|47.2|43.3|Maw||1}}
*Ve'nari followed to site

==Description==
The Maw is changing, mortal. And with change comes opportunity.

[[The Jailer]] has pulled a realm that was hidden deep within the [[Shadowlands]] into the Maw. It is a location of some interest to me, but I do not wish to approach it alone.

The [[Mawsworn]] are swarming the area, you see. There must be something of value that they seek.

I have a safe enclave nearby. Accompany me there and I may be able to help you find that waystone you're looking for.

Do we have a deal?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
The Jailer desperately wants something here, yet his precious Eye cannot breach its defenses.

Oh well. Shall we?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I possess a device that will take us to a safe enclave near this landmass. Once we arrive, it is imperative that you stay close.}}

Don't use the normal [[Animaflow Teleporter]] (that links to the [[Tremaculum]] and the [[Beastwarrens]]), but instead head downhill immediately to Ve'nari's south to find another one. Interact with it, and Ve'nari will run up and tag along. She and the Maw Walker will land in a small cave at {{co|61.1|68.9|Maw||1}} in the eastern part of the Beastwarrens outside [[Desmotaeron]], where an endless line of Mawsworn are marching along the road into Desmotaeron.

:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Reports I intercepted from the Mawsworn indicate that the Jailer has been seeking a realm called Korthia.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|My fellow brokers whisper legends of this place. A magnificent city filled with treasures, its location a closely guarded secret.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Be on alert. No doubt the [[Eye of the Jailer|Jailer's Eye]] will be upon this place.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I have the means to keep us hidden, [[Delving Deeper|as I have before]].}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Stay close and obey my every word, lest the Jailer's Eye reduce you to stygia.}}

Speak with Ve'nari:
:Are you ready, Maw Walker? We must move carefully and quickly.
:{{gossip|I'm ready, let's move.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|We will be uncomfortably close to the Jailer's forces. Stay near me.}}

Ve'nari activates a [[Shroud of Concealment]]-like effect:
:{{Abilities|Cloak of Ve'nari|id=350923|Shielded from the Eye of the Jailer.|icon=ability_skyreach_lens_flare}}

Stay near her as she moves to the southeast. While in the shroud, Ve'nari will fully suppress the typical [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]] mechanic, and the additional mechanic during this quest, which blasts unprotected players with roughly 1000 damage every 1/4 second:
:{{Abilities|Eye of the Jailer|id=351068|The Eye of the Jailer has found you and is causing massive damage.|icon=achievement_raid_torghast_theeyeofthejailer}}
:{{text|say|Eye of the Jailer|I see you, Maw Walker!}}

Should players get too far from Ve'nari, she will stop:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Stay close, Maw Walker.}}

Walking along, a steady stream of [[Mawsworn Houndmaster]]s and [[Mawsworn Brutalizer]]s are seen making their way to Korthia

[[File:Mysteries of the Maw - eavesdropping.jpg|thumb|Eavesdropping on Mawsworn]]
At {{co|61.1|65.8|Maw||1}} on the way:
:{{text|say|[[Mawsworn Raider]]|It seems the Eye cannot peer into Korthia. Our search must proceed without it.}}
:{{text|say|[[Mawsworn Sentry]]|No matter. The Banished One shall have his prize.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|There must be strong magic in Korthia if it keeps the Eye at bay. Perhaps the legends are true...}}

[[Mawsworn Myrmidon]]s are seen swarming the airspace all around the Eye of the Jailer.

[[File:Mysteries of the Maw - Eye vs wall.jpg|thumb|The Eye bombarding the barrier]]
Ve'nari keeps moving to the southeast. At around {{co|62.2|68.4|Maw||1}} a cutscene plays:
:''Ve'nari stops and motions for the Maw Walker to do the same.''
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Not. A. Word.}}
:''The Eye of the Jailer appears over the nearby cliffs and flies over Ve'nari and the Maw Walker with a loud shriek, missing them by a hair's breadth but not noticing them, and flies south to the new landmass. It stops just before the border, where some kind of barrier is blocking the way. The eye channels a beam into the barrier in an attempt to break it. The camera tracks forward, showing some destroyed buildings of Korthia.''

[[File:Mysteries of the Maw - Ve'nari and the Eye.jpg|thumb|Ve'nari moving toward the Eye]]
On the other side of the cutscene, Ve'nari keeps moving southward.
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|We must reach our destination before my cloak dissipates. Oh, and watch your step.}}

On the way, the beam from the Eye into the barrier is getting reflected, launching missiles onto the ground. Dodge the swirlies, else the Residual Blast will hit hard:
:{{Abilities|Residual Blast|Inflicts Shadow damage to targets struck.|icon=ability_argus_soulburst|notes=Deals 23% of the player's max health as Shadow damage}}

[[File:Mysteries of the Maw - Eye closeup.jpg|thumb|The Eye, uncomfortably close]]
She follows the path south until...
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Stop!}}
:''The Eye of the Jailer stops what it's doing and moves very close to Ve'nari and the Maw Walker. After several seconds, it flies away to the north.''
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Move!}}

Ve'nari and the Maw Walker reach the northern tip of [[Korthia]]:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|It seems Korthia is shielded against the Eye of the Jailer, but his Mawsworn are breaching its defenses.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|We made it! Imagine the wonders to be found here, Maw Walker! Oh, and that waystone of yours as well.}}

Ve'nari has gossip:
:Who knows what secrets this place holds? There is only one way to find out...
