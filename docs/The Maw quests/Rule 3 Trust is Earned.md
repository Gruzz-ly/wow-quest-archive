==Objectives==
[[File:Bloodhoof Mace.jpg|thumb|Bloodhoof Mace]]
Place a Signaling Beacon in [[Cocyrus]].
* [[Signaling Beacon]] Placed {{co|35.0|47.7|Maw}}
* [[Bloodhoof Warmace]] recovered {{co|33.4|49.1|Maw}}
* [[Tower Inquisitor]] slain
* Use your [[Cypher of Relocation]] to Return to Ve'nari (Optional)

==Description==
Before you leave this cursed realm, there is one final task you must complete for me.

The [[Mawsworn]] regularly transfer [[soul]]s to various blocks of [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]] from many different areas in the [[Maw]].

I happen to know of one such area. Place this beacon there so I may be informed when the next transfer happens.

And if you are seen by the enemy... well, you are known for your prowess in combat, yes?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|49|14}}
* +15 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
I will have opportunities for trade in the future, Maw Walker. I am certain our paths will cross again.

==Completion==
One of your associates was taken into Torghast? 

It sounds as if he put up quite the fight. Perhaps he could also prove useful... if he were to be rescued.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Rule 3: Trust is earned, and information has a price. You recall the cypher I gave you? That's right--you are now in my debt.}}

Exit to the southwest and follow the road to the quest marker on the south side of [[Zovaal's Cauldron]]. Look for the Signaling Beacon ghost object, and interact with it to see a cutscene of Baine getting run through by a Tower Inquisitor and dragged through a gateway into Torghast:
:{{text|say|[[Baine Bloodhoof]]|For the [[Earth Mother]]!}}
:{{text|say|Tower Inquisitor|You will never escape the Maw!}}

[[Bloodhoof Mace]] is still on the ground, surrounded by the corpses of Tower Inquisitors. Interact with it and another will drop out of the sky:
:{{text|say|Tower Inquisitor|Your soul shall soon be bound to the Jailer.}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Tower Inquisitor|He... will claim... your soul...}}

Return to Ve'nari, either on foot or with a charge of the [[Cypher of Relocation]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Tread carefully when the [[Eye of the Jailer]] falls upon you, mortal. It would be frightfully inconvenient to lose a trading partner with such potential!}}

:The [[Mawsworn]] regularly transfer [[soul]]s to various blocks of [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]] from [[the Tremaculum]]. It would be most useful to know when they do this.
:<She hands you a small device.>
:Place this signaling beacon near the portal. Try not to be caught. If you are seen by the enemy... well, I trust you know what to do.

:The beacon functioned, yes? Do not look so surprised, Maw Walker!
