==Objectives==
Rescue 5 souls and retrieve 60 Stygia.

Stronger enemies will have a higher chance to drop large amounts of Stygia.

Use the Stygia to purchase a Cypher of Relocation from [[Ve'nari]].
* Souls taken into the Soulkeeper (5)
* [[Stygia]] (60)
*More Stygia can be found from powerful foes
* Purchase a [[Cypher of Relocation]]

==Description==
Many doomed [[soul]]s suffer within the [[Maw]]. You must be careful if you do not wish to join them.

Your Soulkeeper can hold a small number of souls until you return to your covenant. But that will be of little benefit if you do not survive this place yourself.

There is a substance, stygia, that is found on some creatures within the Maw. The stronger the soul, the more stygia they have.

Collect some of it for me and I can fashion it into many things you will find quite useful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|57|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +1 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
I will gladly assist you in the acquisition of survival tools... provided you bring me the stygia.

==Completion==
You seem to have a knack for drawing the Jailer's attention.

This changes the terms of our arrangement.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Rule 1: Always have an exit strategy. To ensure one's continued existence within the Maw, one must maintain a plan of escape at all times.}}
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|I acknowledge the irony of me creating this rule despite my current inability to depart this place. You may laugh--briefly--without causing offense.}}
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Enough chuckling. Gather the stygia I require and return with haste. Your cypher awaits!}}

Exit the refuge and look all over for mobs to kill and [[Soul Cage]]s to open. Cages are marked on the minimap with treasure chests. Open a cage to free a [[Caged Soul]], then ''click on the Caged Soul'' to actually advance the quest. Wailing Souls also count - interact with one between its Overwhelming Misery casts to collect it. Each soul is worth roughly twenty Stygia, so just freeing the souls will gather enough stygia for the quest.

*{{Text|say|Caged Soul|They have taken... everything...}}
*{{Text|say|Caged Soul|Can you... hear me?}}
*{{Text|say|Caged Soul|The last of my strength... is yours.}}
:{{Text|emote|The soul enters your Soulkeeper.}}

A good target as far as mobs to kill go are elites - marked with skulls on the minimap. They will drop a significant amount of stygia, but are under the Jailer's eye.

Acquire 60 stygia:
:{{text|say|The Jailer|You trespass in my domain, mortal. No matter where you hide... I will find you.}}

This unlocks the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]] mechanic.

Return to Ve'nari and purchase the [[Cypher of Relocation]] from her.

;Description
:Until the emergence of [[mortal]]s who could walk the [[Maw]], the [[Mawsworn]] didn't bother chasing their enemies for long. You pose a rather unique threat, to them and to me.
:I can help you better understand your enemy, and operate within the Maw. Know that I shall not do so without the benefits of your labor.
:Fetch me some stygia from beyond my cloak's protection. For your trouble, I will trade a Cypher of Relocation.
;Completion
:Ably done, Maw Walker. I am certain this is all most overwhelming.
:Make sure you hold on tight to that cypher. You'll need it.

:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|It is surprising what can you find lying around the Maw if you know where to look.}}
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Apparently this one didn't meet the Jailer's exacting specifications.}}
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|No need to worry about his condition. He is content. And, you may leave here with him when our bargain is met.}}
