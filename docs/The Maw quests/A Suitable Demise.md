==Objectives==
Throw 5 Soulforged Cores into Soulforges in [[Zovaal's Cauldron]] in the Maw.
* [[Soulforged Core]] destroyed (5)

==Description==
Surviving in this miserable place has been difficult, but I must confess... sending a few Mawsworn to a suitable demise does bring me joy.

The soulforgers in Zovaal's Cauldron are among the cruelest minions the Jailer employs. I find satisfaction in disposing of their cores in the very forges which they maintain.

This of course has the added benefit of temporarily slowing down their arms production, if you require more sober justification for your actions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 425x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Their cores have such a satisfying pop when they are destroyed, do they not?

==Completion==
Next time, ask me how to run a stampede of mawrats off the edge of a cliff. That never fails to entertain.

==Notes==
Defeat [[Magmic Flamebinder]]s for a [[Soulforged Core]], then throw it into a Soulsteel Forge. Each core must be tossed into a ''different'' forge. Still-valid forges are marked with a yellow ping on the minimap. Additionally, though the cores are not marked as "Unique", treat them as unique items.

Soulsteel Forge locations include:
*{{co|36.5|46.6|Maw}}
*{{co|35.9|45.3|Maw}}
*{{co|35.0|44.8|Maw}}
*{{co|38.8|39.8|Maw}}
*{{co|41.9|42.3|Maw}}

Completing the objective will add 1000 points of threat (100% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
