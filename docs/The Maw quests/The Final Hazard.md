==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|The Final Hazard.jpeg|Living Gateway|A sentient amalgam of void magics. Prefers to kill by displacing its foes high in the air.}}
Slay the Living Gateway atop the Tremaculum.
* Use the Grapple Point to ascend the tower (Optional)
* [[Living Gateway]] slain
* Enter the Maw Gate

==Description==
With their lesser rifts closed, the Devouring Host will be hard-pressed to muster any reinforcements. But if we don't deal with their leader, then they'll just open more.

Above, in the parapets... There's no mistaking it. I can feel a force of Void drawing everything toward it, even all the way from down here. That's where we'll find our mark, without a doubt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}

==Progress==
All that's left to do is deal with their commander.

I just really wish he'd picked a slightly lower vantage.

==Completion==
The bulk of the lingering threat is bound in the Tremaculum. With their commander slain and their portals shut, the natural denizens of the Maw should see to the remainder soon enough.

Now begone. I have work to do.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Is this a bad time to mention that I'm not terribly fond of heights?}}
:''Sylvanas and Arator ascend the tower.''

Head up the tower or use the grapple point to ascend the tower and confront the Living Gateway.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|How's this for "keeping pace?"}}
:{{Text|Say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Kill it, and their reinforcements will cease.}}

;Upon slaying the Living Gateway
:{{Text|Say|Sylvanas Windrunner|It is done.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Good. Sylvanas, we need to--}}
:{{Text|Say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Not here. Come.}}

Use the Maw Gate, and the party is teleported to the [[Planes of Torment]].
:{{Text|Say|Sylvanas Windrunner|It's time for you to leave, Arator.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I'm not going anywhere until we've had a chance to talk.}}

Upon completion, Sylvanas has a gossip:
{{dialogue|I should have known you would be the one behind this mess. If nothing else, you have a remarkable knack for inciting conflict.}}
