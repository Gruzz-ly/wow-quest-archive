'''Full of Surprises''' is a daily quest offered by [[Ve'nari]] in [[Rift (Shadowlands)|The Rift]]. Find her near the bridge to the [[Beastwarrens]] in [[Cocyrus]]. See the Rift article for more information about how to access the Rift.

==Objectives==
Locate Zovaal's Vault.    
*[[Zovaal's Vault]] located
*Zovaal's Vault returned to Ve'nari (Optional)

==Description==
[[File:Zovaal's Vault.jpg|thumb|Zovaal's Vault]]
You continue to surprise me Maw Walker, your presence here is most unexpected!

Since we are both here, I believe we should work together.

[[The Jailer]] hides has a vault, full of valuables, somewhere in [[Rift (Shadowlands)|this rift]]. Locate it for me, or bring it here to be opened, and we'll share the wealth together!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|77|22|}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the vault?

==Completion==
This is quite a profitable partnership. I am certain Cartel Ve will be most unhappy with our success.

==Notes==
[[File:Full of Surprises - dragging the vault.jpg|thumb|Dragging the vault]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|There is a mystery to unravel. Perhaps you will not fail me yet.}}

[[Zovaal's Vault]] is not marked on the zone map, but it will appear on the minimap once players get in range of it. {{:Zovaal's Vault}}

Players do not have to return to Ve'nari with the Vault - just approaching it is enough for quest credit. However, if they want what's inside... Interact with the chest to hook up '''Zovaal's Vault Chain''':
:{{Abilities|Zovaal's Vault Chain|This large chain allows you to drag Zovaal's Vault.|icon=creatureportrait_blackrock_chainsofwoe|notes=Movement speed reduced by 50%}}

Start heading back in the direction of Ve'nari. Mount up or not, but don't get too far from the vault, as the player will eventually run out of chain and trip over it. Players can also enter combat and they won't drop the chain. Should players run out of time while in the Rift, if they can get back in they will be able to pick up the Vault where it was last seen.

Approach Ve'nari with the chest in tow:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|What have you found, Maw Walker? Is it... valuable?}}

The vault contains ~100 [[Stygia]], 5x [[Zovaal's Dark Carafe]], and some junk items.
