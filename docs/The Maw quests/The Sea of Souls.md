==Objectives==
Follow the trail of [[corpse]]s to [[Tyrande Whisperwind]]
*Tyrande Whisperwind found {{co|39.3|25.9|Maw}}
*Meet Shandris Feathermoon in Ve'nari's Refuge.

==Description==
Some force here seeks to keep us from finding Tyrande.

The trail of bodies seems to go into this... stream of [[soul]]s.

I suggest we split up. I will follow along the bank of the river. You enter its current and follow the trail.

Should you need me, I will be close at hand.

We will find Tyrande, no matter where this course leads.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Tyrande must see reason. She cannot save the kaldorei if she remains lost within this darkness.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You take the river. I will provide cover from along the bank. Let us hope the real Tyrande awaits us ahead.}}
Jump off the bridge and follow the river of souls northeast. Try to avoid all of the enemies inside. If problems arise, Shandris can be signaled to use a '''Smoke Arrow''', functioning like [[Vanish]].

The trail of corpses exits the river just before the landmass ends. There, Tyrande is staring at [[Torghast]], afflicted by the Power of the Night Warrior:
:{{abilities|Power of the Night Warrior|Fueled by the uncontainable power of the Night Warrior. Deals massive damage, but also heals the same amount as long as the power can be contained.}}

Approach her:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Minn'do! Leave the Maw with us--before the Night Warrior's power overwhelms you!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|No! Not while our people suffer inside Torghast!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I will tear that tower apart, and [[Sylvanas Windrunner|the Banshee]] with it!}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Whatever evils lurk within the tower that Tyrande seeks, we must not let her face them alone.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I cannot afford to lose her trail. I will meet you up ahead.}}

Return to Ve'nari's Refuge, where Shandris is facing down Ve'nari.

==Progression==
{{Daughter of the Night Warrior}}

;On approach
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Why, of course, mortal! I can attune my portal to help you follow your friend inside Torghast. Just... one small favor, if you'll indulge me.}}
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Would you be so kind as to tell me about that intriguing energy that was erupting so violently from her?}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I... see no harm in answering your question. It is the power of the Night Warrior, granted by the goddess Elune. A force too potent to be wielded by mortals.}}
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Elune... Night Warrior... fascinating. Thank you for the information. Now I will, of course, honor our arrangement.}}
