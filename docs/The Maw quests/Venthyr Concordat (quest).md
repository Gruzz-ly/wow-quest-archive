Bring the Venthyr Concordat to [[Ve'nari]] at [[Ve'nari's Refuge]].
* [[Venthyr Concordat]] (provided)

==Description==
<This appears to be an encoded correspondence between a [[venthyr]] noble and a [[Mawsworn]] [[lieutenant]].

Perhaps Ve'nari can decipher it.>

You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
<Ve'nari glances over the scroll, rotating it in various directions.>

It has been some time since I've seen a method of encryption so intricate. But I suppose the venthyr are nothing if not ostentatious.

Whatever the contents of this message might be, it is clear that its author wanted to keep it clandestine.
