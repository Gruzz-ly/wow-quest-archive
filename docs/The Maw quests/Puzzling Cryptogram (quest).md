==Objectives==
Bring the Puzzling Cryptogram to [[Ve'nari]] at [[Ve'nari's Refuge]].
* [[Puzzling Cryptogram]] (provided)

==Description==
<The markings on each side of the cube periodically switch positions.

Ve'nari will be interested in this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
<Ve'nari laughs as she appraises the cryptogram.>

This... is a [[child]]ren's toy. [[Broker]]s use them to teach their [[cartel]]'s encryption methods.

Not to say that this is worthless. Quite the contrary. In a place such of this, even a glimmer of mirth is valuable beyond measure.
