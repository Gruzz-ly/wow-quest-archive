==Objectives==
Destroy 10 Soulrend Traps in the [[Tremaculum]].
* [[Soulrend Trap]] disabled (10)

==Description==
The traps... they didn't effect us before. Too many [[soul]]s... escaping.

They... made new traps... tear apart fleeing souls...

...too late for me. Destroy... so others might escape!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
<With the rending traps disabled, the souls here should stand a better chance of escaping their captors.

Though they may never escape the Maw, at least they have a chance of escaping the grim fate of becoming a mindless shade.>

==Notes==
Traps are all over the [[Tremaculum]].

Destroying the last trap will add 500 points (50% of a level) of threat to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
