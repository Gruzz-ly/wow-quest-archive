==Objectives==
Bring the Soulforge Blueprints to [[Ve'nari]] at [[Ve'nari's Refuge]].
* [[Soulforge Blueprints]] (provided)

==Description==
<As you scan the documents in your possession, you realize that they outline the horrific methods by which [[soul]]s can be forged into armaments.

Ve'nari would be intrigued by this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
Raw materials must be hard to come by in the [[Maw]]. It does not surprise me that [[the Jailer]]'s weaponsmiths would need to be... resourceful.

Perhaps the knowledge recorded in these blueprints should remain a secret.

==Patch changes==
