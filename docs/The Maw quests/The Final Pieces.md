==Objectives==
Acquire a Runecarver Memory, an Armor Rune Vessel suitable to your class, and two different Missives. These items can be obtained through crafting, or can be found on the Auction House.
* Rune Vessel Acquired
* Different Missives Obtained (2)
* Runecarver Memory Restored

==Description==
The final components you'll need to acquire are... vessels... rune vessels! Armor to hold the might that will be imbued.

And... powers? No... missives? Yes! Missives will allow your item to enhance your own personal strengths. But they cannot be the same. No, the two must offer different benefits.

All of these can be obtained from souls with the correct crafting knowledge.

And lastly, more of my memories. Memories of the runes, of the powers... of myself.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:

==Completion==
You've collected all the necessary pieces. Now all that's left is to combine them.

Speak with me again when you are ready, and I will create the prize you seek.
