==Objectives==
[[File:Disciple Kimonas.jpg|thumb|[[Disciple Kimonas]]]]

Free 8 Drowning Kyrian in [[Gorgoa: River of Souls|Gorgoa, the River of Souls]].
* [[Drowning Kyrian|Drowned Kyrian]] released (8)

==Description==
Maw Walker! I am relieved to see you in this place.

A dark sect of [[kyrian]] who have allied themselves with the [[Maw]] stole my brothers and sisters from their posts in [[Bastion]]. They turned us over to a foul sea witch, the likes of which I've never seen.

This... [[Helya]], I believe they called her... seems determined to break us so that we might also join her ranks.

Please, if you can, save my brethren.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Rescue my brothers and sisters... before Helya breaks them. I cannot imagine a bleaker fate.

==Completion==
We are in your debt, Maw Walker.

I don't know if we will ever escape this place, but you have at least bought us a chance to strike back at our foes.

==Notes==
In Gorgoa, look for [[Grasping Tentacle]]s holding [[Drowning Kyrian]].

Freeing the eighth kyrian adds 500 points of threat (50% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
