'''Rule 4: Make A List''' concludes the initial step of [[Ve'nari|Ve'nari's]] questline involving the [[Maw]] and [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned]]. As players gain standing with her, she will reveal additional rules. At Tentative, the quest chain continues with [[Rule 5: Be Audacious]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Inquisitor Devaki.jpg|Inquisitor Devaki|Slay Inquisitor Devaki and uncover how he is learning more about the brokers.}}
Kill Inquisitor Devaki and find out how he is trying to track [[Ve'nari]].
* [[Inquisitor Devaki]] slain {{co|33.9|16.0|Maw}}
* [[Pulsing Sphere|Source of broker tracking found]] {{co|34.3|14.7|Maw}}

==Description==
I've discovered that one of [[the Jailer]]'s inquisitors is attempting to devise a method to track my movements.

Clearly, that is a problem for me... and by extension, it is a problem for you.

The inquisitor has risen to the top of my list of potential threats. In the past, I would have had to deal with him myself. But now... I have a business partner.

Put an end to him, yes? And if you can, determine exactly how he intended to track me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +180 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Have you learned anything of Inquisitor Devaki's tracking methods?

==Completion==
Fine work. This should keep the both of us safe from the Mawsworn. 

I will hold onto the sphere that you found for the purpose of study.

Don't you have other matters to attend to?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Rule 4: Maintain a list of those who might wish to end your existence. Do not flatter yourself; your presence on this list is among the least of the Mawsworn's functionaries.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|At the top of my list is an Inquisitor. His position has risen. I would be most generous were his existence to cease by your actions.}}

Head to the marked location on the map, up to the northeast in the [[Planes of Torment]]. Devaki is standing over the corpses of three [[Clandestine Operative]]s from [[Cartel Ve]].

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Devaki|The brokers cannot hide forever!}}

Kill him:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Devaki|The Jailer... sees... all...}}

Close to the edge of the cliff is a Broker Cache, near another broker corpse. Open it to obtain the [[Pulsing Sphere]], then return to Ve'nari.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|My cartel has been sending agents into the Maw for some time. A dangerous assignment, but the lure of valuable information has a certain appeal to my kind.}}

Speak with Ve'nari again:
:You were not followed, were you?
{{gossip|Your cartel says they know what you did. Is there something you're not telling me?}}
:Oh, there are many things I choose not to tell you. As I am sure there are many things you do not tell me.
:Trust is built on discretion, Maw Walker. Without it, business would be impossible.
:That being said, I have trusted you with my most valuable secret: the location of this very refuge. I ask only that you trust me in return.

Once players reach Tenative standing with Ve'nari, she will offer [[Rule 5: Be Audacious]], unlocking access to [[Perdition Hold]].

;Early beta description
Inquisitor Devaki has passed word to [[the Jailer]] that he can sense [[Broker]] [[magic]] within this place.

In the past, I would dispatch him myself. With you here, all I need to do is maintain a list. The Inquisitor has surged to the top.

Put an end to him, yes?

;Progress
I sense unease. Has my target been eliminated?

;Completion
We are safe then. Or, well... you know. As safe as we can be surrounded by torturers on all sides.

;Later beta description
I've discovered a [[Mawsworn]] by the name of [[Inquisitor Devaki]] is attempting to devise a method to track broker movement.

Clearly, that is a problem for me... and by association you.

In the past, I would dispatch him myself. With you here, all I need to do is maintain a list. The Inquisitor has surged to the top.

Put an end to him, yes? And if you can, find out how he got the idea to track my movements.

;Later beta progress
Have you found how Inquisitor Devaki's methods?

;Later beta completion
Fine work. This should keep me, and by association you, safe from the Mawsworn. 

I will keep this sphere you found for study. 

;Speaking with Ve'nari
:{{gossip|The sphere I found on Inquisitor Devaki said you betrayed someone.}}
:Do not trouble yourself over that. What was the saying... betrayal is in the eye of the beholder. 
:Or something like that.
:There are more matters things to handle here in the Maw. I cannot have a business partner worried about such shortsighted dealings.
