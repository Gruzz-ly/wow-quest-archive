==Objectives==
Collect 12 Blazing Ingots and return them to [[Ve'nari]] in the [[Maw]].
* [[Blazing Ingot]] (provided) (12)

==Description==
<The [[Stygian Runesmith|runesmiths]] have imbued this ingot with an enchantment that causes it to burn with inextinguishable flames.

It is likely that this metal is used to empower the [[Mawsworn]] protectors of [[Zovaal's Cauldron]].

Bringing some samples of this ore to Ve'nari could aid her attempts at unlocking [[the Jailer]]'s secrets.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
What's this?

==Completion==
Intriguing. I had often wondered what differentiated the Cauldron's protectors from the rest of the Mawsworn.

I hope these weren't too difficult for you to procure.

==Patch changes==
