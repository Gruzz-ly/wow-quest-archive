'''Rule 6: Concealment is Everything''' is the Ambivalent step in [[Ve'nari|Ve'nari's]] storyline in the [[Maw]]. The quest unlocks access to the [[Beastwarrens]], opening up access to the area and the Maw Hunts mechanic.

The final quest will take place at Appreciative, not at Cordial, when she offers [[Rule 7: Betrayal is Inevitable]].

==Objectives==
Retrieve 15 Broker Hunting Runes from The [[Beastwarrens]].
* [[Cypher of Dampening]] used within the Beastwarrens {{co|46|56|Maw}}
* [[Broker Hunting Rune]] (15) {{co|57|55|Maw}} 
* [[Cypher of Dampening]] (provided)

==Description==
I have made a startling discovery, <name>. 

Do you recall how the captured agents of my cartel were taken to the Beastwarrens? 

The Mawsworn seem to think they possess a means of tracking me. And now, strange new runes empower the Jailer's hounds.

Clearly, we cannot have that.

This new cypher will grant you solace from the screeching in the Beastwarrens. Brave its caverns and secure those runes for inspection.

If we are to counter their effects, I must know how they work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Abilities|Access to the Beastwarrens|Allows safe access to The Beastwarrens by suppressing the effects of Otherworldly Screeching.|id=340351|icon=ability_fomor_boss_rune_green}}
* [[Make it Double!]]
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
The runes... you have them?

==Completion==
Interesting... runes that can detect brokers by using our extracted essence.

Let us hope you were able to stop any further production. I will keep these for study.

At some point, you will certainly need to walk the nightmarish plains of the Beastwarrens again. My cypher will continue to allow you to do so.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Rule 6: Implement new concealment measures regularly. The Mawsworn never stop devising new ways to find us.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|This cypher will dampen your aroma in their Warrens. Bring me the runes which animate these fiends, that I may better understand their function.}}

Head southeast into the [[Beastwarrens]] across the bridge, and the Otherworldly Screeching will harass the player for the last time:
:{{text|bossemote|Denizens of the Beastwarrens fill your mind with [Otherworldly Screeching]!}}

Use the quest item, then head in. Follow the road east into [[Desmotaeron]], then immediately take the north fork to find [[Ve'brax]], a chained broker who starts [[Rule 6 Addendum: Save Me At Any Cost]]. Pick it up before heading further northeast to the quest area.

Kill [[Rune Extractor]]s, [[Rune Hunter]]s, [[Rune Inscriber]]s, and [[Rune Scribed Husk]]s in the area for the [[Broker Hunting Rune]]s. Then enter the [[Echoing Caverns]] to find [[Runemaster Mavrok]]. Defeat him, finish up the rune collection, turn in to Ve'brax, then head back to Ve'nari.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Learn what you can inside the Warrens, mortal. My research continues.}}

Ve'nari has new gossip text on complete:
:{{gossip|What happened to the other brokers who came into the Maw with you?}}
:None of the others survived. Only me.
:The Maw, as you are well aware, is a dangerous place. And while traveling in a large group may provide the illusion of security, in reality it just makes you a more tempting target.
:We learned that the hard way. Our numbers were whittled away until there were few enough of us left to hide ourselves. That slowed the hunt... but did not stop it.
:When I alone remained, I accepted the truth of my situation. Solitude offered the best chance of survival.
:At least until you arrived.

==Progression==

;Description
Deep within the Beastwarrens, [[Shadehound]]s are being raised in remarkable numbers. They are also... considerably more powerful than before.

Go to the Beastwarrens and acquire the runes the [[Mawsworn]] use to twist [[shade]]s into [[beast]]s.

While you're there, it would be prudent to install some perimeter security. An early warning system, of sorts.

In exchange, I offer a cypher, which will deafen your ears to the screeching within the warrens. Move carefully, [[Maw Walker]].
