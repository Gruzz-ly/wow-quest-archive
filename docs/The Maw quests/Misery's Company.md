==Objectives==
Kill 10 Hopeless Vessels in [[Gorgoa: River of Souls]].
* [[Hopeless Vessel]] slain (10)

==Description==
<The husk of this poor soul has been stripped of everything, down to near nonexistence.

This suffering cannot continue. Save the others from their misery.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
<The hope of releasing these poor souls from their anguish washes over you.>

==Notes==
A specific dead [[Hopeless Vessel]] in [[Gorgoa: River of Souls]] starts this quest. Kill ten others, which can be found in the length of Gorgoa. Be mindful of the Gorgoan Lament debuff, which stacks incoming and outgoing damage, up to 30% of each!

Killing the tenth vessel adds 500 points of threat (50% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
