==Objectives==
Purchase an Anima Supricifer from [[Ve'nari]] and recover 5 Molten Anima.
*Purchase an [[:Anima Supricifer]] from Ve'nari
* [[Molten Anima]] (5)

==Description==
First you'll need a vessel to house [[anima]] and a way to expel it. I happen to possess such a device, which I'll be pleased to give to you.

For a price, of course.

You recall [[Zovaal's Cauldron]], I trust? The denizens there were forged in unholy fire. Assuming their anima is of a similar nature, it should be able to melt even the metals of the tower.

With my device and their anima, I believe you can achieve your goal, [[Maw Walker]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to acquire the anima?

==Completion==
Your success continues to impress, Maw Walker.

Though I admit, such feats are becoming less unexpected as I come to know you more.

==Notes==
The [[Anima Supricifer]] costs 50x [[Stygia]].

Head west to [[Zovaal's Cauldron]], then kill [[Blazing Stygia]] and [[Cauldron Enforcer]]s for their [[Molten Anima]].

Should players not have enough stygia, head out into the Maw, then kill mobs, free souls, and complete Ve'nari's quests to acquire some.
