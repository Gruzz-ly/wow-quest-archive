'''Phantasmagoria''' is a quest started from the [[Warped Phantasma]] found occasionally inside a [[Tormentor's Cache]] after a [[Tormentors of Torghast]] event in the [[Maw]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Warped Phantasma to [[Ve'nari]] at [[Ve'nari's Refuge]].
*[[Warped Phantasma]] (provided)

==Description==
<The strange mote of otherworldly energy glows with an erratic rhythm. 

Ve'nari may find it of interest.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
How beautiful. That this Phantasma is able to exist outside of [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|the tower]] at all is unbelievable. Something is most curious about it's{{sic}} nature...further study is needed.

==Patch changes==
