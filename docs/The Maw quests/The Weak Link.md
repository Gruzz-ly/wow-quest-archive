'''The Weak Link''' fully unlocks the [[Runecarver]] in [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned]], and once this quest is complete, memories of the Runecarver will start dropping (or be available for purchase).

==Objectives==
Break the Runecarver free.
*Break the Chain
*Speak to the Runecarver in The Runecarver's Oubliette in Torghast.

==Description==
This ought to be enough to break the bonds that hold your newfound ally.

<Ve'nari pauses for a moment.>

Before you do so, I offer a word of warning.

No creature imprisoned in that place should be trusted. Tread carefully, mortal. 

After all, it would be a shame to lose so valuable a business partner.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|17|50}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
*[[The Forgotten One]]

==Progress==
It's good to remember something new again.

==Completion==
Freedom. Of a sort. Yes... this is good. You have my thanks.

What was it you wanted? Ah, power. Yes. Very well, then.

==Notes==
Back into Torghast, south to the oubliette, and speak with the Runecarver:
:Did you a discover a way to free me?

:{{gossip|I've found a way, but we only have one shot at it. Let's get you free!}}

A cutscene plays:
:''The Maw Walker raises the [[:Anima Supricifer]] and channels the molten anima in a beam into the Runecarver's right shackle.
:{{text|say|Runecarver|Yes... Yes! Bonds weakening...}}
:''After some struggling, the Runecarver snaps the chain holding his right hand. The supricifer shatters in the Maw Walker's hand. The Runecarver tries to stretch away from the chain holding his left hand as well, but is tugged back and comes to a rest lying on his side.''

Speak with Runecarver again:
:Have you recovered any more of my memories?
:The more you find, the more both of us shall benefit.
