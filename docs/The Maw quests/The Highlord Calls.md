'''The Highlord Calls''' begins the [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned]] storyline, part of the [[Shadowlands campaign]]. To begin this quest, players must have completed the first chapter of their [[Covenant Campaign]].

==Objectives==
Report to Highlord [[Bolvar Fordragon]] in [[Oribos]].

==Description==
;Bastion
:We have received word from Highlord Fordragon urging you to return to him in Oribos at once.
:All I know is it pertains to the [[Maw]].
:You should go to him with haste. Anything involving that dark place must be our top priority.
;Maldraxxus
:Highlord Fordragon has requested your presence in Oribos.
:We know only that it involves the Maw.
:Go to him, and show him that the Maldraxxi will never falter. Even in the face of that dark place.
;Ardenweald
:Highlord Fordragon needs you in Oribos right away!
:I'm not sure of the details, but the messenger mentioned the Maw.
:You should go to him as soon as you can. If the Maw is involved, it must be serious!
;Revendreth
:A messenger from Oribos has informed us that Highlord Fordragon has requested your presence in Oribos.
:It seems it pertains to the Maw... and the [[Denathrius|Master]]'s plans, no doubt.
:I suggest you heed his summons, Maw Walker. We must leave nothing to chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have dire news, <name>.

==Notes==
In [[patch 9.1]], Bolvar offers skips for alts who have already done this before:
*{{gossip|I have been to Torghast and met the Runecarver. {{text|red|<Skip ahead to finish the Torghast chapter and have Torghast, Ve'nari, and the Runecarver unlocked.>}}}}
*:This will skip the Maw/Torghast chapters of the covenant campaign, and players will be able to pick up "[[The Captive King]]" with Bolvar. Note that this will forfeit 900 [[Soul Ash]] as part of the Torghast chain.
*{{gossip|I have already learned of Anduin's fate. {{text|red|<Skip ahead of the Anduin exposition and cut scenes to begin Chains of Domination quests.>}}}}
*:This will finish the [[Maw storyline]]s, including the "A Fateful Vision" chapter, which involves killing [[Sire Denathrius (tactics)|Sire Denathrius]] and the final four quests of the Maw campaign, forfeiting 2500 [[Reservoir Anima]]. The next quest offered will immediately start the [[Chains of Domination campaign]] with "[[The First Move]]".

==Progression==
{{The Maw and Torghast}}
