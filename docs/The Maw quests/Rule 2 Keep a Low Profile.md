==Objectives==
[[File:Soul Ward activated.jpg|thumb|An activated Soul Ward]]
Reinforce 4 Soul Wards.
* [[Soul Ward (Maw)|Soul Ward]] reinforced (4)
* [[Broker Device]] (provided)

==Description==
Though you may wish to depart with your precious souls in tow, we now have additional matters to settle first.

The Eye of the Jailer is upon you. And that does not bode well for either of us.

Take this device. You will reinforce my wards to ensure he does not take notice of me as well.

The last thing I need is a loud, inelegant mortal bringing more attention my way. I can't have the Jailer capturing me, after all.

I'm far too valuable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|28|50}}
* +4 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Our business is not yet complete. Attend to my wards.

==Completion==
That should be enough to hide us from the Jailer's sight.

I need you alive. For the time being, at least.

Now, back to business.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Rule 2: Keep a low profile. The [[Maw]] is no place for theatrics. Get in, get what you want, and get out... while endeavoring to retain your limbs and other possessions.}}

The four wards are in the refuge, marked on the minimap. Click on the ward, then use the quest item on it:
#{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Now that the Jailer's noticed you, you're doomed. Anything of import you do in the Maw will catch his attention. And attention is exactly what we don't want.}}
#{{Text|say|Ve'nari|First he'll turn the [[Soul seeker|soulseekers]] on you. Then the towers. Then his kill squads. And after that... well, you don't want to know. Surgical and meticulous--that's how you stay alive.}}
#{{Text|say|Ve'nari|The good news is that you're safe here in my refuge. Not so out there. Remember, should a tragic fate befall you, some of that precious stygia might slip through your fingers.}}
#{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Fret not, mortal. A day at most away from his gaze, and the Jailer will turn his attention elsewhere. Then it will be safe for you to venture out again. To acquire stygia. For me.}}
