==Walkthrough==
Find [[Burly Hurly]] outside the eastern gate to the [[Tremaculum]]:
:{{text|say|Watchmaster Boromod|Thank the stone you've arrived, Maw Walker. Prince Renathal awaits you on the barricade above.}}
:{{text|yell|Burly Hurly|I throw you there, <name>!}}

Interact with Burly Hurly to get thrown:
:{{text|say|Burly Hurly|Don't worry, I throw good!}}

Speak with Renathal:
:No enemy can stand against a united Shadowlands.
{{gossip|How can I help the assault, Prince Renathal?}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Your arrival heralds our victory. Lead our charge into the fortress!}}

Four quests unlock. Pick up enough of them and Renathal, [[Lady Moonberry]], and [[General Draven]] fly off:
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Lady Moonberry, might you kindly cover our advance into the fortress?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|A simple trick. No one can see us unless we want them to!}}

Finish them, then check back in with Renathal under the steps by the [[Conjured Death]] and [[Talaporas, Herald of Pain]]. Draven is behind Renathal and Moonberry, so hop on:
:{{text|say|General Draven|Hold tight!}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|With the power of Revendreth and Ardenweald united, even the most dreaded of the Jailer's beasts will fall with ease!}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|However, I did not expect it to be quite so large...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Look, now it's easier to hit!}}

[[File:Venthyr Assault - light mirror.jpg|thumb|A Light mirror]]

[[Gothra the Trembler]] is on the platform where [[Talaporas, Herald of Pain]] usually spawns, but he can't be attacked. Walk through a Maw Mirror back to Revendreth, clear out the hostiles defending the mirror, then aim the Light back through the mirror. Rinse and repeat for the other three mirrors.

[[File:Venthyr Assault - finale.jpg|thumb|Gothra dead]]
After running back through the last mirror, a cutscene plays.
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Allies, brace yourselves!}}
:''Light from the four mirrors slam into the behemoth.''
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Burn in the light of the Ember Ward, wretched beast!}}
:{{text|say|Gothra the Trembler|Raaagh!}}

On the other side, Gothra is dead:
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|And so the Tremaculum is ours. For the Shadowlands!}}

Prince Renathal gossip:
:Today's victory is not just for Revendreth or Ardenweald. Every win is shared among all who wish the best for the Shadowlands.
:We will not rest until our fight is complete.

===Gossip===
;Lady Moonberry at the wall
:<Lady Moonberry whispers softly.> 
:Don't tell Prince Renathal, but I'm secretly keeping score between our spell-slinging.
:He has the most total, but I currently hold the record for most enemies downed in a single hit!
:Oh, and I've also been adding disgusting smells to mine, just to annoy the Mawsworn!
:<Lady Moonberry giggles.>
;Lady Moonberry at the end of the assault
:<Lady Moonberry surveys the smoldering corpse of Gothra and smiles.>
:I've always liked Prince Renathal's style... We should do this again sometime.
;General Draven at the wall
:We are utilizing a less conventional army than I am accustomed to today.
:I would be more comfortable if we had more [[stoneborn]] at our disposal, but we will make due with what we have.
:Revendreth stands strong.
;General Draven at the end of the assault
:<General nods approvingly at the corpse of Gothra.>
:I was uncertain of this plan when Prince Renathal first proposed it, but now I see his wisdom.
:Many stoneborn would've been lost in this fight, but the careful manipulation of Light left only one casualty?
:Intriguing...
;Theotar
:Ah, welcome to the Maw, <name>! 
:I am so pleased you could join us.
:Although, I suppose our greetings should be reversed.
:I am but a humble guest in your domain of expertise.
:<Theotar bows his head to you and asks quietly.>
:Has it always been so... rustic here? I have not yet found a single chair in this entire domain.
;Niya
:<Niya scratches the head of her [[gorm]]ling, which wiggles in happiness.>
:I must admit, if you can control their more dangerous urges, these little guys are actually quite cute.
:Don't worry, I'll hold onto him tight.
;Hunt-Captain Korayn
:Today is a good day, for today we hunt!
;Cryptkeeper Kassir
:I was honored to receive Prince Renathal's request to reinforce his assault into the Maw.
:Though Temel prefers a different title nowadays...
:<Cryptkeeper Kassir gives Temel an annoyed look.>
:... I suppose he is still able to contribute as "the party herald" even if it's unconventional. 
:However, our enemies here have many sins that could be exploited by a good sin herald like Temel.
;The Curator
:Oh, um, hello.
:Can I help you in some way? Or were you already helping me with something?
:I am afraid I am a little distracted at the moment.
;The Accuser
:Even here, surrounded by enemies in the darkest depths of the Maw, we cannot forget our charge.
:Venthyr are not called to destroy. We are called to desperately pursue every possible avenue that might avoid destruction.
:There are souls in the Maw that deserve to be here. I know that because I have sent many here myself.
:But the Jailer has claimed souls far beyond his right, and we must not rest until every last wrongfully convicted soul is rescued.
:The calling of Revendreth has never been easy, but it has always been important.
:I believe you understand this now.
;Gresit
:We will save every soul that we can. 
:Everyone deserves the same opportunity that the Accuser gave me.
;Rendle
:Fangcrack'll be back in no time, crackin' heads!
;Cudgelface
:Take a drink and a seat, <name>. We got time.
;Nadjia the Mistblade
:<Nadjia continues to parry attacks while she speaks with you.>
:Do not waste time or resources on our eastern flank. I shall have no problem holding them off while you and the others focus your efforts on the primary objective.
:Just send word if you need me elsewhere. Though you would have to send an entire brigade here to take my place, of course.
:<Nadjia smiles as she turns her full attention back to the Mawsworn.>
