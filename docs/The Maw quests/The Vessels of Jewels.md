==Objectives==
Bring the memory back to Appraiser Au'vesk in [[Oribos]].
* Bring the Memory back to [[Appraiser Au'vesk]]

==Description==
You have the bearing of a lapidary. Though familiar with the art of [[Jewelcrafting|jewelcraft]], perhaps there is yet more to learn.

Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you.

Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way.

What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*{{Abilities|Shadowghast Jewelry Recipes|Unlock the Shadowghast Jewelry recipes at your trainer in Oribos.|id=346020|icon=spell_holy_mindsooth}}
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Au'vesk inspects what you brought to him.>

A memory? Fascinating... With this knowledge, I can teach you to craft jewelry capable of holding immense power. 

For a price, of course.

==Notes==
*This quest unlocks the ability to purchase the [[Shadowghast Necklace]] and [[Shadowghast Ring]] recipes from [[Appraiser Au'vesk]].
