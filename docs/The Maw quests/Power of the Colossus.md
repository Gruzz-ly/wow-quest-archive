==Objectives==
Retrieve a Colossal Power Core from [[Perdition Hold]] in [[Maw|The Maw]].
* [[Colossal Power Core]] {{co|22.8|65.4|Maw}}
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
I have another task for you, [[Maw Walker]].

Deep within Perdition Hold, there lurks a menacing mechanization known as the [[Soulsteel Colossus]]. It must be destroyed before it wreaks havoc upon us.

Travel to the Hold, and then across the bridge into the [[Altar of Domination]]. There, casting its vast shadow upon The [[Maw]], you will find the Soulsteel Colossus.

Shatter the colossus and bring me its power source as proof of your victory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 700x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|77|22|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +1100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
The power source... I trust it was not too heavy?

==Completion==
The souls trapped within the power core may yet be saved. Leave me to my research, Maw Walker.

==Notes and trivia==
*This quest was renamed from '''Colossal Conundrum''' during the beta.

;Beta description
Deep within Perdtion Hold, a colossal threat looms. We must destroy it before it is brought to bear on us both.

Travel to the Hold, and then across the bridge and into the Altar of Domination. Shatter the Colossus, and bring me its power source so I may better understand its nature.
