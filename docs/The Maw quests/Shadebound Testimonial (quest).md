==Objectives==
Bring the Shadebound Testimonial to [[Ve'nari]] at [[Ve'nari's Refuge]].
* [[Shadebound Testimonial]] (provided)

==Description==
<These appear to be the pain-induced ramblings of a tormented [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]] [[prisoner]].

Ve'nari would find value in this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
Quite the find, Maw Walker. Firsthand information from within Torghast is rare and valuable. None who set foot in the tower return to tell the tale.

Present company excluded, of course.
