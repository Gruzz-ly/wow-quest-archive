==Objectives==
Find a stolen memory of the [[Runecarver]].
*Exit Torghast through the exit door (Optional)
*Recover the [[Runecarver's Memory|Runecarver's memory]] from Odalrik {{co|38.6|28.0|Maw}}

==Description==
If you can retrieve my memories, I can help you. At least I believe I can.

Then, perhaps, we can help each other.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|71|50}}

==Progress==
Have you found what was taken from me?

==Completion==
It's been an age since I knew anything other than the contours of this hellish prison.

Thank you, mortal. Now to aid you.

==Notes==
Exit Torghast and return to [[Ve'nari's Refuge]]. Head northwest along the road, stopping just before [[Gorgoa: River of Souls]]. [[Odalrik]] is found off the road to the east, marked with a skull on the minimap (like all other elites).

==Progression==
{{The Maw and Torghast}}

==Patch changes==
