==Objectives==
Kill [[Mawsworn]] Troops within [[Perdition Hold]].
* [[Mawsworn Myrmidon]] slain (5)
* [[Mawsworn Instructor]] slain (3)
* [[Mawsworn Eviscerator]] slain

==Description==
Survival requires that we keep our enemies in check, [[Maw Walker]].

With [[Gorgoa: River of Souls|Gorgoa]] overflowing, the Mawsworn continue to gain strength.

Perdition Hold has been fortified with fresh troops. We cannot allow the Mawsworn to bolster their ranks any further.

Make your way into Perdition Hold and decimate their forces. When the work is done, you may return to me for your reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 700x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +1,100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
I trust the Mawsworn did not trouble you?

==Completion==
A small victory, Maw Walker. Many more will be required.

;Description
With Gorgoa running over, the Mawsworn's ranks swell. Perdition Hold is swarming with new troops.
