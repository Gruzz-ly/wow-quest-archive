'''Into Torghast''' is offered by [[Bolvar Fordragon]] in [[Oribos]] after players complete their first chapter of their covenant campaign.

==Objectives==
Find a way into Torghast, Tower of the Damned.
* Jump into the [[Maw]] from the [[Ring of Transference]] (Optional)
* Ask [[Ve'nari]] about a way into [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]] {{co|46.9|41.7|Maw}}

==Description==
The bond to your covenant is growing stronger, <name>. Good. The power lies within you to venture into Torghast and rescue our allies.

You saw [[Baine Bloodhoof]] while assisting the [[broker]] in the [[Maw]]. Perhaps this [[Ve'nari]] knows a way to breach [[The Jailer|the Jailer's]] tower and find the chieftain.

When I peered into Torghast once before, you stood at my side. I believe that connection will allow me to see through your eyes as you navigate its torments.

Seek out Ve'nari and request her aid, Maw Walker.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Abilities|Access to Torghast|Unlock access to Torghast, Tower of the Damned|id=334746|icon=inv_torghast}}
* {{cost|3|8|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do whatever you can, Maw Walker. We are depending on you.

==Completion==
Well, Maw Walker, what are you waiting for?

==Notes==
Upstairs to the [[Ring of Transference]] and a high-dive off the ring into the Maw once more. Speak with Ve'nari:
:You were not followed, were you?
{{gossip|How do I enter Torghast?}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Torghast, eh? Once I told you that your friends were being held inside, I knew it was only a matter of time before you came to me for aid.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Because I was able to anticipate your request, it just so happens I have already acquired a portal device that leads into the tower.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I will dispense with the usual warnings and disclaimers, as your unique combination of courage and foolhardiness would render them moot.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Do not ask how it was obtained. Simply consider it a gesture of goodwill that you are now obligated to repay. I look forward to our future transactions, Maw Walker.}}

;First beta description
:It is fortunate you brought Baine Bloodhoof to safety. I fear the others will not be so easily rescued.
:It is clear that [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]], [[Thrall]], and [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] are being held in the Jailer's most impenetrable stronghold:
:Torghast.
:I must ask you to brave the dangers of the Maw again. Find a way inside that tower, and look for any sign of our allies.
:You helped me peer into Torghast once before. Through that shared bond, I may be able to see through your eyes and help guide you through its torments.

;Second beta description
:So [[Baine Bloodhoof]] is being held in Torghast.
:I must ask you to brave the dangers of the Maw again. Find a way inside that tower, and look for any sign of our ally.

;Beta completion
Our bond holds true. I can sense that you've entered the Jailer's Tower.

Now it is time to climb. 

;On accept during beta
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|You assisted me in peering into Torghast once, Maw Walker. That bond may forge a link between us as you search the tower.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I... will join you, <name>. Just... give me a moment to...}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|No, Baine. Though your heart yearns to help save your friends, your body needs to recover.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|The attendants here can tend your wounds while the Maw Walker seeks our allies. Stay and tell me what you learned from your time inside the Maw.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|If you think it best, Highlord. An'she light your path, champion.}}

{{Rfa-section}}
;Alpha description
:We rely on you, Maw Walker, to save [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]], [[Thrall]], and [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] from the [[Maw]]. With each passing day, it becomes clearer to me that they are being held in [[the Jailer]]'s most impenetrable stronghold:
:Torghast.
:It is time to begin the search. Find a way in, and look for our allies. We need to recover the architects of peace.
;Ve'nari speech
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Torghast? Why would anyone want to go there?}}
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|Then again, I suppose I am not one to question bravery so audacious it borders on idiocy, am I?}}
:{{Text|say|Ve'nari|You will find a portal to Torghast in the back of my refuge.}}
