'''Soulless Husks''' is one of [[Ve'nari]]'s potential weekly quests in the [[Maw]].

==Objectives==
Obtain a Stygian Hammer from a [[Stygian Runesmith]] and destroy 10 Armored Husks in [[Zovaal's Cauldron]].
* [[Stygian Hammer]]
* [[Armored Husk]] destroyed (10)

==Description==
Some of the [[Mawsworn]] begin as inanimate suits of armor, forged by the stygian smiths of Zovaal's Cauldron. Once fashioned, they await infusion of a decrepit [[shade]] to complete their genesis.

It is at this time they are the most vulnerable, and so it is then you should strike.

The hammers wielded by the Mawsworn runesmiths hold the power to break as well as they shape. Procure one of them and smash our foes to dust before they can rise against us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 425x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +850 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Have you satisfactorily dismantled our enemies?

==Completion==
Satisfying, is it not?

The fewer Mawsworn to rise into the Jailer's ranks, the better for our continued existence.

==Notes==
Defeat [[Stygian Runesmith]]s for their [[Stygian Hammer]], then use the hammer on the [[Armored Husk]]s in [[Zovaal's Cauldron]].

Destroying the last husk will add 1000 points of threat (100% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
