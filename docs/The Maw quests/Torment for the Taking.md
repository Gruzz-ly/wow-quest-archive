==Objectives==
Fill the Phasic Siphoner from the Soul Fissures in [[Detrithos]] and return it to [[Ve'nari]] in the [[Maw]].
* [[Phasic Siphoner]] full (0/100%)
*Return to Ve'nari at Ve'nari's Refuge.

==Description==
<A [[Broker]] device has been abandoned here. It seems like it was being used to siphon energy from rifts of soul energy that have erupted in the area.

The Brokers surely would not have sought to harness this energy if it didn't have a use. Perhaps you should finish what they started.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
What's this you've found?

==Completion==
You've found my siphoner. You are just full of surprises, Maw Walker.

The unique way that pain and suffering manifests physically in the Maw is a mystery... one which this energy you've collected may help unravel. 

Well done.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Phasic Siphoner]] in [[Detrithos]], then click on the Soul Fissures in the area to fill the bar.

Filling the bar will add 500 points of threat (50% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
