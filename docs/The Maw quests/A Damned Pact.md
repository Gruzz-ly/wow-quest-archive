==Objectives==
Discover a way to break the [[Runecarver]] free from his chains.

==Description==
Yes... I begin to remember. Power. Power with a purpose. That is what I can offer.

Runes. Runes are the key. I've recalled some of them, but to infuse them into your equipment, I require my hands.

Well, one hand would suffice. Both would be better.

Find a way to free me from my bonds, mortal. Then I can offer the power you seek. After that, freedom... and perhaps the downfall of the one who bound me.

==Completion==
Breaking a prisoner's chains? I'm not sure I know how that could be done, unless...

It's dangerous, but I believe there may be a way.

==Notes==
Return to the antechamber and exit Torghast again. Turn in to [[Ve'nari]].

==Progression==
{{The Maw and Torghast}}

;Description
:Yes, it's coming back to me. My specialty is imbuing armor with great power.
:I've recalled some of the runes, but in order to carve them into a piece of equipment I need the use of my hands. Well, one hand would suffice, but both would be preferable.
:If you can discover a way to free me from my bonds, I will work with you to make you more powerful. Then together we can take down my captor and free me from this prison once and for all.
