==Objectives==
Bring the Mawsworn Shackles to [[Ve'nari]] at [[Ve'nari's Refuge]].
* [[Mawsworn Shackles]]

==Description==
<The shackles are part tangible, part ethereal. They scream into your mind when held.

Just the sort of thing Ve'nari might be looking for.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
<Ve'nari snatches the shackles from your hands.>

Rather dangerous for a mortal such as yourself to be carrying these around.

<Ve'nari lifts and lowers the shackles slowly, as if to determine the weight.>

Though I must admit... these could prove useful.

==Patch changes==
