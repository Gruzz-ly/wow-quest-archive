==Objectives==
[[File:Dirt Pile (Maw).jpg|thumb|Dirt Pile]]
Rescue Half-Buried Souls in [[Calcis]].
* Half-Buried Soul rescued (8)

==Description==
The Mawsworn never cease to invent new forms of suffering.

Even the ground on which we tread is formed from souls pounded into dust. With the flood of souls passing through Gorgoa, the Mawsworn are keen to expand their domain.

At present, the Mawsworn are burying souls and crafting new terrain from their torment. It is not too late for some of them.
Free the buried souls and stop the endless expansion of suffering.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 425x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +850 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
They are safe?

==Completion==
The curious forms of torment the Mawsworn invent will never cease to amaze me.

==Notes==
In Calcis, interact with Dirt Piles to free a Half-Buried Soul. This does not count as saving a soul for the normal weekly quest.

Freeing the eighth soul adds 1000 points of threat (100% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].

==Beta version==

Ahh! Again you surprise me with your attention to detail!
