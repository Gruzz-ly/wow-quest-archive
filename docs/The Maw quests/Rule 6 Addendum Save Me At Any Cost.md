{{questportrait|Runemaster Mavrok.jpg|Runemaster Mavrok|Runemaster Mavrok is controlling the chains that bind Ve'brax. Slay him!}}

==Objectives==
Slay Runemaster Mavrok.
* [[Runemaster Mavrok]] slain {{co|63.0|52.0|Maw}}

==Description==
You! You, there! Wait!

You are the infamous [[Maw Walker]], yes? I have heard much about you.

Please, help me! My compatriots have been drained of their essence. The Mawsworn are using it to fashion their foul runes.

One of them bound me here, and I am sure to be next on his list. You must slay him in order to free me!

I can make it worth your while. I have collected a fair amount of [[:stygia]] during my time in the [[Maw]]. It is yours, all of it, if you save me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 223x [[Stygia]]
*{{cost|51|48}}
* 10,200 XP

==Progress==
There is no time to waste. Hurry, before the Mawsworn return!

==Completion==
Not a moment too soon! Those fiends were just about to put the sword to me. 

Here, as we agreed, is your payment in stygia. 

Though truth be told, I owe you a great deal more than this. I have nothing left to offer... except for wisdom and warnings.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Ve'brax|Over here! Please, get me out of this. I have plenty of stygia to pay you!}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'brax|We came here hoping to recoup our losses from Ve'nari's betrayal. Oh, how foolish we were...}}

Keep heading northeast to enter the [[Echoing Caverns]], and fine [[Runemaster Mavrok]] in the back.

Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Runemaster Mavrok|Maw Walker! We'll slay you and finish off those brokers.}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Runemaster Mavrok|Ha... your broker friend... is doomed...}}

On return, the corpses of two [[Mawsworn Runemaster]]s lie at the feet of [[Ve'brax]], who has freed himself:
:{{text|say|Ve'brax|Maw Walker! You broke me free just in time, these fiends would have torn me apart.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ve'brax|Before I retreat to my safe haven, I must warn you about Ve'nari. She is not who she seems.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'brax|She betrayed her former associates, and will do the same to you if she knows we spoke. Do not trust her lies.}}

==Progression==

;Description
Hello! Quite interesting running into someone else that isn't shackled here.

You must be the infamous Maw Walker. I've heard all about you and your heroics.

Would you be willing to get me out of here? A nasty beast by the name of Runemaster Mavrok has me bound here.

I do believe he intends to drain me of all my anima, as he did to my compatriots.

I've gathered a fair amount of [[:stygia]] here that I would be willing to part with, should you aid me.
