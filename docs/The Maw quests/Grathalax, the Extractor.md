==Objectives==
Defeat Grathalax underneath the [[Tremaculum]] in The Maw.
* [[Pain Conduit]] disabled (3)
* [[Grathalax]] slain

==Description==
There are many powerful lieutenants among the Mawsworn, but there is one who is particularly important to the Jailer.

Far beneath the Tremaculum lives the Jailer's prime interrogator, Grathalax. Power is fed to him via conduits throughout the area.

His role is to make the process of [[anima]] extraction more efficient. His methods are... unkind.

I believe we would both benefit from the end of his existence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*425x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +850 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Has Grathalax been destroyed?

==Completion==
The end of Grathalax will deal a great blow to the Jailer's infrastructure. Well done.

==Beta version==

;Description
Far beneath The Tremaculum lives [[Zovaal]]'s prime ritualist, Grathalax. His presence is felt everywhere in the form of his communicator beacons.

His role is to make the process of anima extraction more efficient. His methods are... unkind.

Perhaps his existence is contrary to your goals?
