[[Ve'nari]] starts '''Rule 7: Betrayal is Inevitable''' when players have reached Appreciative ({{rep|Exalted}}) standing with her. This concludes her storyline in [[Patch 9.0]]. Note that, as always, there is no special dispensation for the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]]. If players are at max threat, they should wait to return after it has reset.

==Objectives==
Recover the broker device outside of [[Perdition Hold]].
* [[Broker Device (object)|Broker Device]] recovered {{co|37.4|62.2|Maw}}
* [[Ve'brax]] slain

==Description==
Our arrangement has been quite lucrative. Reliable associates like yourself can be so hard to find.

I believe I can entrust you with a task I would usually perform on my own.

While working with the tracking runes you retrieved for me earlier, I detected a device of [[broker]] origin nearby. It must have been brought into the [[Maw]] by the captured expedition.

Please examine it and prepare it for transport back to the refuge. I will join you shortly.

This could be a valuable discovery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|77|22}}

==Progress==
Have you found the device?

==Completion==
It seems our partnership has become rather permanent. [[Cartel Ve]] will not rest until we are both eliminated.

I suppose now would be the time to share one of my most important rules with you.

==Notes==
The Broker Device is outside [[Perdition Hold]] on the [[Face of Oblivion]], inside the [[Woeful Cavern]] where [[Yero the Skittish]] retreats to. Interact with the device, which is obviously a trap, as it stuns the player while [[Ve'brax]] and [[Ve'nari]] spawn in:
:{{text|say|Ve'brax|I tried to warn you, Maw Walker. But you wouldn't listen.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Did you think they'd take the word of an assassin?}}
:{{text|say|Ve'brax|Over yours? Of course. You broke your contract and betrayed the cartel! Now you'll pay the price!}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I think not. Maw Walker, let us end this nuisance.}}
:{{text|yell|Ve'brax|One way or another, you will be my way out of the Maw!}}

Fight Ve'brax off, and get him to 50% health, when he pops an immunity shield:
:{{text|yell|Ve'brax|Enough of this! I'll end you both and find another path back to Oribos!}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|No, Ve'brax. You will leave the Maw... but you will never return to the cartel.}}
:''Ve'nari places several '''Soul Wards''' around Ve'brax.''
:{{text|say|Ve'brax|AGH! What... are you... doing... ?!}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Utilizing one of my more interesting devices. I'm afraid it will prove quite painful for you.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'brax|No! You cannot hide, Ve'nari! You--AHH!}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|That took quite a bit of stygia... but I suppose that's the cost of doing business.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Come, Maw Walker. I believe we have much to discuss.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Rule 7: Betrayal is inevitable, even from those close to you. Especially from those close to you.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Now that we know there are mortals who can leave this realm, I suddenly find myself in what is, shall we say, an enviable position.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|And my cartel does not handle envy particularly well. Those who assigned me here years ago are now sending assassins to destroy me.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Should you encounter others of my cartel in the Shadowlands, they are not to be trusted.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|If they realize that you are my trading partner, I suspect they will eagerly end you in an effort to harm my prosperity.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|For that is what we are, <name>. Partners. From now until our last flame flickers.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|In closing: Do not betray me.}}

==Progression==
