==Walkthrough==
:{{text|yell|Lord Herne|The hunt has begun!}}

The Night Fae and Necrlords have set up camp in the [[Crucible of the Damned]], just south from where [[Apholeias, Herald of Loss]] spawns. Speak with Herne:
:The Queen has ordered that we cleanse this area. We shall cull the Jailer's minions in a great hunt.
:The champions of Maldraxxus have already arrived. Will you join us?
{{gossip|I will join the hunt, Lord Herne.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Herne|Your prey awaits, Maw Walker. Good hunting.}}

[[File:Night Fae Assault - on bridge.jpg|thumb|The party on the bridge]]
Four quests open up. On accept of most of the quests:
:{{text|say|Lord Herne|Ride forth! We strike at the heart of this encroaching darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|You will clearly have need of my sorcerous expertise.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Well, this should be fun...}}
:''The majority of the assault party charges uphill to the southwest.

Catch up with the party on the bridge over [[Gorgoa: River of Souls]] and turn in the quests. On completion of all four, a cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Lord Herne|What vile horror is this?}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|I know this magic...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Don't worry, Maw Walker. I have you.}}
:{{text|say|Mawsworn Watcher|Darkness awaits you!}}

[[File:Night Fae Assault - dark.jpg|thumb|It's rather dark]]
On the other side, the Crucible has gotten quite dark. Players are buffed with:
:{{Abilities|Moonberry's Shadow|Stealthed from the watchful eye of Mawsworn Watchers by Lady Moonberry. Avoid their direct gaze!|icon=spell_animaardenweald_groundstate}}
:{{Abilities|Desperate Assault|Helping Lady Moonberry and the Night Fae assault Crucible of the Damned.|icon=inv_misc_sigil_ardenweald01}}

''Dismount'', then speak with Moonberry:
:The mawsworn took our friends into that foreboding fog ahead...
:I can keep us hidden, but it will not be easy to find them in there.
{{gossip|Keep us hidden while we search for our friends.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|You'd better stay close. The Mawsworn are looking for us.}}

They also enter the vehicle interface and gain three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Rescue Prisoner|Release the bonds of a prisoner, allowing them to escape with you.|range=5|notes=3 sec cast|icon=inv_misc_key_11}}
#{{Abilities|Distracting Illusion|Creates a distraction, attracting the attention of all nearby Mawsworn Watchers for 5 seconds.|range=20|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant|icon=spell_animaardenweald_orb}}
#{{Abilities|Blinding Dust|Blinds a Mawsworn Watcher, causing it to lose sight of its current target and unable to see for 4 sec. Usable while caught by watchers.|range=40|cd=4 sec|notes=Instant|icon=inv_enchant_dustsoul}}

:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Quick! Distract that watcher so we can sneak past.}}

Move forward to the edge of the guard's searchlight, then use the '''Distracting Illusion''' ability and target the ground underneath it:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Good! Now let's move before it notices us.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Ha! Fooled him! If we get caught, the blinding dust can help us escape.}}

[[File:Night Fae Assault - stealth section.jpg|thumb|Dodge the lights]]
Cross the bridge to the south to be afflicted by Overwhelming Darkness:
:{{Abilities|Overwhelming Darkness|Mawsworn magic reduces your visibility and movement speed.|icon=spell_animamaw_nova}}

It's a stealth section! Use the distraction ability to force the watchers to focus wherever the illusion looks for a few seconds, then use that time to sneak past or free a prisoner while nobody's looking:
:{{text|say|Lord Herne|A clever trick, Lady Moonberry. You have my thanks.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|My weapons don't work here. Find me something to hit.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|The leader of these Mawsworn lurks nearby. But not for long.}}
:{{text|say|Thiernax|Have you found the others? I will leave no one behind.}}

Should players get caught:
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|Quick, use the blinding dust!}}

[[File:Darkmist Ascendant Relyana.jpg|thumb|Darkmist Ascendant Relyana]]
Once all four are freed, head uphill to find [[Darkmist Ascendant Relyana]]
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Phew! I've never felt such a dark presence before.}}
:{{Text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|It will pale in comparison to my wrath.}}

Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Darkmist Ascendant Relyana|Your soul shall soon be bound to the Jailer.}}

The NPCs will tank, so just focus on dealing damage.
:{{text|say|Lord Herne|The darkness recedes and our quarry is slain! A victory well earned!}}

==Dialog==
;Margave Sin'dane:
:Lord Herne was wise to call for Maldraxxus's aid.
:This growing darkness is no trifling trick.
;Thiernax
:While others tend to the growing darkness, I will tend to those who fight.
:The injured, the lost, the desperate--we cannot abandon our own out here.
;Dreamweaver
:Too many view rest as a burden, instead of the gift that it is.
:The busier you are, the more you should welcome it.
:I am certain you are very busy here today. Will you sit awhile and rest with me?
;Lady Moonberry
:The best part of any new adventure is finding avenues to have fun along the way.
:<Lady Moonberry grins mischievously.>
:With the proper choices, transmogrification can be an endless source of entertainment while still achieving more practical ends.
;Niya
:<Niya scratches her arm furiously.>
:Will these needler stings ever stop itching?!
;Choofa
:Having a tirnenn carry me where I am needed on the battlefield isn't laziness--it's tactical efficiency!
:It takes my tiny legs twenty steps to match a single step of a tirnenn. I'd actually be hurting our cause if I wasn't carried everywhere!
;Emeni
:I told them I could handle this myself, but they insisting on sending the rest of the army too.
:<Emeni grunts as she sharpens her blade hand.>

==Night Fae shortcut==
Approach the two Assault Recruits near the port to the Ring in the Heart of the Forest:
:{{text|say|Assault Recruit|A hunt has been called. Who will answer its challenge?}}

Speak with the recruit:
:The Winter Queen has called for a hunt on the Crucible of the Damned in the Maw.
:All able members of the Wild Hunt are to report to Lord Herne at the assault camp in the Crucible of the Damned immediately.
:We will be reinforced by representatives of the Maldraxxian military.
:When you are ready to answer the call, Marasmius has prepared a special mushroom connection in The Ring.

In the Ring, a special mushroom has sprouted up between [[Marasmius]] and [[Cortinarius]]:
:{{text|say|Cortinarius|Marasmius has connected this mushroom to one that Lord Herne planted in the Maw.}}

Take the mushroom to the Night Fae camp at [[Crucible of the Damned]].
