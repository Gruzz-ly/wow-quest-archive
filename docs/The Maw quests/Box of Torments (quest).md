Ve'nari may find it melodious.>

==Completion==
How soothing.

<Ve'nari takes a closer look at the item in her hands.>

I wonder...

<Ve'nari presses a diamond shaped etching on the side of the box. It clicks into place, then opens to reveal a secret compartment containing a small piece of rolled up parchment.>

Nothing is what it seems, Maw Walker.
