==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Leerok the Scryer.jpg|Leerok the Scryer|Leerok is already mostly eye, as it is. Extracting its eye should be trivial... once you defeat it.}}
Obtain the Eye of the Scryer from [[Leerok the Scryer]] in [[Maw|The Maw]].
* [[Eye of the Scryer]] {{co|24.9|36.4|Maw}}

==Description==
Evading the [[Mawsworn]]'s scryers requires powerful [[magic]]al countermeasures.

The prime reagent? A luminescent eye, pried from the skull of a scryer recently shaken from its trance.

The scrying ritual begins as we speak. You will, of course, be compensated only for an intact eye.

Restraint is advised in its procurement.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 425x [[Stygia]]
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +850 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Well? Do you have it, undamaged?

==Completion==
Do you think he saw that one coming?

That was an attempt at mortal humor. You may laugh at your leisure.

==Notes==
Enter the [[Forlorn Respite]] at {{co|25.5|32.6|Maw}} in the [[Planes of Torment]], then defeat the [[Mawsworn Thaumaturge]]s channeling a spell into [[Leerok the Scryer]] to spawn it.

Defeating Leerok and looting the [[Eye of the Scryer]] will add 1000 points (100% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]]. 

==Trivia==
*During the alpha, this quest was named '''Scryer's Eyes'''.
