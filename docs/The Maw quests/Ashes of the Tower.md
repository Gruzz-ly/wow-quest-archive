'''Ashes of the Tower''' is a not-so-subtle hint to acquire enough [[Soul Ash]] in [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned]] to craft a Shadowlands legendary. Though this quest suggests that the looted Soul Ash will be lost, the Runecaver does not actually take it from players, so they will be capable of immediately crafting their legendary.

==Objectives==
Collect 1250 Soul Ash in Torghast.
* [[Soul Ash]] (1250)

==Description==
Your first step towards obtaining the power is to retrieve... something. Yes, I believe it's coming back to me.

==Progress==
Have you recovered what is needed?

==Completion==
Yes, this should be enough to engrave the runes. Upon lesser equipment, that is. 

Potent items will require more... more... Soul Ash. Yes, Soul Ash.

And you should hold onto it. I will ask for it when the time comes.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Runecarver|To imbue such power, there is a price. The ashen remnants of souls lost within this tower. Yes. Ascend, mortal. Acquire what remains.}}

Soul Ash drops from layer bosses in [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]].

==Progression==
{{The Maw and Torghast}}

==Previous versions==
;Beta completion
:Yes, this should be enough for the lowest tier of items that can be engraved with the runes. If you wish to imbue greater items, it will require more... more... Soul Ash. Yes, Soul Ash.
:I've also recalled something, a power that could aid you in your pursuits.
