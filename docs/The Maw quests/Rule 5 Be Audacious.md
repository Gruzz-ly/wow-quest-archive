'''Rule 5: Be Audacious''' is offered by [[Ve'nari]] to players who have reached Tentative standing with her, unlocking access to [[Perdition Hold]]. The next quest is offered at Ambivalent standing with her.

==Objectives==
Investigate the increased activity within [[Perdition Hold]].
* Cypher of Obfuscation used within Perdition Hold's entrance {{co|34|56|Maw}}
* [[Suspicious Operative|Surviving broker]] found {{co|32.5|57.5|Maw}}
* [[Seeker Xeros]] slain {{co|26.4|54.8|Maw}}
* [[Cypher of Obfuscation]] (provided)

==Description==
You have proven yourself a useful associate, <class>. In thanks, I have crafted a cypher that will allow you to venture further into the Maw.

But... it is experimental in nature. You will have to test it in the field. And I have just the test in mind.

Cartel Ve has foolishly sent more agents into the Maw. They were captured and taken to Perdition Hold. I must know why.

Breach the fortress and learn what has become of the captive brokers. Nothing is more valuable than knowledge of your enemy's plans.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Abilities|Access to Perdition Hold|Allows safe access to Perdition Hold by suppressing the effects of Exposed Anima.|id=340350|icon=ability_bossfelmagnaron_runeempowered}}
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* [[Prepare for Trouble!]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
What have you discovered, Maw Walker?

==Completion==
The Beastwarrens, you say... I wonder what they are plotting...

Such an embarrassment that they were discovered and captured in the first place. It seems Cartel Ve has become quite careless in my absence.

You have my gratitude for your assistance, as always. I will inform you when I have need of your services again.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Rule 5: Be audacious, when the situation demands it. The Mawsworn rarely expect this.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Perdition Hold is teeming with activity. I must know why.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Take this experimental cypher. Should it function as I expect, entering Perdition Hold should not result in your sudden demise. Probably.}}

Head south of [[Zovaal's Cauldron]] through [[Calcis]] and across the bridge to the [[Face of Oblivion]]. As players cross the bridge, a squad of winged mawsworn fly through, with a Clandestine Operative in tow.
:{{text|say|Clandestine Operative|Where are you taking me?!}}
:{{text|say|Clandestine Operative|Help!}}
:{{text|say|Clandestine Operative|Let go of me!}}

Get to the gate at {{co|34|56|Maw}} and use the provided [[Cypher of Obfuscation]]:
:{{text|bossemote|Enemies within Perdition Hold sense your [Exposed Anima]!}}

Kill a path through the two [[Mawsworn Veteran]] guards, then interact with the [[Suspicious Operative]] from [[Cartel Ve]] just on the other side of the gate.
:{{text|say|Suspicious Operative|Xeros... has... the others...}}

Speak with the broker:
:Captured... tortured... broken...
:Xeros... taking others... to Beastwarrens...
:Failed... our assignment...
:{{gossip|What does Xeros want with the brokers?}}
:{{text|say|Suspicious Operative|Ve'nari...}}
:''The operative draws their final breath.''

Xeros's location lights up on the exposed island to the northwest of Perdition Hold at {{co|26.4|54.8|Maw}}. Consider using an invisibility item (like the [[Oil of Ethereal Force]]) to skip past most of the mobs in the area.

Crossing the bridge to Xeros' tower, another squad of winged mawsworn fly through, with Clandestine Operatives in tow.
:{{text|say|Clandestine Operative|Leave me be!}}
:{{text|say|Clandestine Operative|Release me!}}

Aggro Xeros:
:{{text|say|Seeker Xeros|You will join the brokers in the Beastwarrens!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Seeker Xeros|They will... lead us... to her...}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I must confess, I was not certain you would return. Do not take this as a compliment.}}

After turning in, Ve'nari has new gossip:
:You were not followed, were you?
{{gossip|Aren't you concerned about the brokers who were taken to the Beastwarrens?}}
:It is unfortunate that they should suffer such a fate, but make no mistake. They are as much our enemy as are the Mawsworn.
:Those brokers were doomed from the moment they arrived. And even if you rescued them, doing so would only invite ruin upon us both.
:A ruthless mentality, I admit. But it is one that is necessary for survival in the Maw.
:You would do well to remember that.

Completing this quest offers a Perdition Hold weekly group quest, like [[Words of Warding]].

==Progression==
{{New Rules}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Description
The Mawsworn are rarely subtle when they have new orders.

Whatever they've got in mind, it cannot be good for either of us.

Go to Perdition Hold, find the reason for their agitation, and deal with it. This cypher will obscure your identity well enough.
