'''On the Trail''' is the third step of chapter two of the [[Night Fae Campaign]]. Players are not granted a free pass on their [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]] threat levels, so if they have maxed out for the day they will need to return after the daily reset.

==Objectives==
Look for signs of [[Tyrande Whisperwind]].
* Location in [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]]'s dream found {{co|36.2|48.0|Maw}}
* [[Velzhen the Duplicitous|Trail of corpses]] followed {{co|33.0|37.3|Maw}}

==Description==
In my visions, I witnessed Tyrande cutting through an endless storm of malevolent, nightmarish beings.

Up ahead... is that...? Yes. I believe it is the very place I saw.

Come. It may hold a clue as to where my mother has gone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Completion==
Some vile force in this place intends to stop us from finding Tyrande.

If experience serves, that means we must be on the right track.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The place shown in my vision lies ahead. Come. We will see if any answers are to be found there.}}

Head southeast through [[Cocyrus]] south of [[Zovaal's Cauldron]]. At the crossroads leading south to [[Perdition Hold]], Shandris is kneeling in the center of a huge number of [[Mawsworn]] corpses.
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|This is my minn'do's handiwork. Just as I dreamed.}}

Speak with her:
:This is Tyrande's work. I saw her cleave through these monsters in my dreams.
:It looks like there is a trail of corpses. They seem fresh... as if she was just here!
:{{gossip|We should be able to find Tyrande if we follow the trail of corpses.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|This path of carnage should lead us to her.}}

Head clockwise around the cauldron, following the corpses all the way. Approach Tyrande:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Minn'do!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Shandris? Why have you come?}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|My dreams brought me here. We have come to save you.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Foolish child. There is no leaving this place. But you can join me here...}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Forever.}}
:''Tyrande suddenly transforms, revealing the true form of a Mawsworn.''
:{{text|say|Velzhen the Duplicitous|You will never find the Night Warrior!}}

Defeat Velzhen:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|This realm seeks to deceive our senses. Keep moving. I see another trail of bodies up ahead.}}

Keep following the trail west across to the bridge over [[Gorgoa: River of Souls]].
