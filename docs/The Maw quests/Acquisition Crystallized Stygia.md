==Objectives==
Collect 10 Crystallized Stygia and return it to [[Ve'nari]] in the [[Maw]].
* [[Crystallized Stygia]] (provided) (10)

==Description==
<This shard of crystal appears to have broken off of one of the massive crystalline structures throughout [[Calcis|the area]]. It thrums with untapped energy.

Ve'nari would likely be interested in any of these shards you come across.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*140x [[Stygia]]
*{{cost|25|74}}
*+75 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
What have you collected, <class>?

==Completion==
Ah yes, the dormant stygia throughout the Maw will sometimes coalesce into forms such as this.

You were wise to bring this to me, <class>.

==Notes==
Crystals of [[:Crystallized Stygia]] litter the nearby area of [[Calcis]].

Completing the objective adds 500 points (50% of a level) to the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
