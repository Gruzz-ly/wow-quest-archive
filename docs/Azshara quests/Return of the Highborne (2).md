== Objectives ==
Deliver the Scout's Orders to {{NPC||Malynea Skyreaver}} at the [[Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange]].
*[[Scout's Orders]] (provided)

== Description ==
Our [[blood elf|blood elven]] allies have been examining the ruins marked on this map, and can likely understand this mysterious script. Seek out the one called Malynea Skyreaver. She conducts her research from the Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange just north of here - it's part of the new goblin transit system that snakes across this land. Quickly, now!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

== Progress ==
I trust this interruption is in regards to something important?

== Completion ==
What? Give that here, this instant! {{NPC||Ag'tor Bloodfist||Ag'tor}} is correct, these are [[arcane]] runes. They're scouting out magical sites? Experimenting with the arcane arts? This is a marked departure from thousands of years of [[night elf|night elven]] history.

Hmph! The idea that they will achieve any competence in this field - even those who once counted themselve among the [[highborne]] - is absurd.

<Malynea puts aside the scroll dismissively, but her face is furrowed with concern.>

== Notes ==
Follow the path north to the rocketway exchange. Listen to her story too.
