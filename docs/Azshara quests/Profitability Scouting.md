==Objectives==
Use the stealth field generator to infiltrate the [[Ruins of Eldarath]] and identify the Heart of [[Arkkoroc]].
*Heart of Arokkoroc identified
*[[Stealth Field Generator]] (provided)

==Description==
Things seem to be quieting down a bit. [[Trade Prince Gallywix|Gallywix]] will probably keep forking out cash to keep us posted [[Gallywix Defense Post|here]], but I have a feeling we might be able to milk a bit more out of the deal.

[[Naga]] and [[Sea giant|Sea Giant]]s aren't normally friends, so the naga must be controlling them somehow. Take this stealth field generator, get in those ruins, and let me know if you find something that looks really pricey.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Molotov Gloves
|Pricey Bracers
|Fine-Link Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||22|60}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Our stealth field generator has the same acronym as our [[SFG|rocket launcher]]. Probably poor planning on our part.

==Completion==
Hahah! Sweet deal. I'll get the ball rolling on this. All I need now is to find a buyer and get the go-ahead from [[Uncle Bedlam]].

Here are your wages for your work here. Excellent work, soldier.

==Notes==
Accepting the quest puts the player in stealth. Should something happen to break stealth, use the [[Stealth Field Generator]] to reenter stealth. Take the north minefield down to the ruins toward the statue of [[Queen Azshara]]. Immediately in front of the statue at {{co|32.0|50.0|Azshara}} is [[High Priestess Silthera]] and an [[Enslaved Son of Arkkoroc]]. The high priestess appears to have some gigantic red crystal in front of her. Thus scouted, head back through the northern minefield to reach the defense post. Remember that stealth does not work on land mines!
