== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Horzak Zignibble}} at the [[Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange]] in [[Azshara]].

== Description ==
You've done a bangup job getting our lumber operations in order. But word on the wire is that we're falling under our stone quote. You think if we could move mountains, we could gather up a few rocks...

Well, that's not my problem, but maybe you can make it yours. Report to Horzak Zignibble up ahead at the Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange. See if you can't help him straighten out his operations. Just follow the road northeast and find him in the rocketway tower.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 220 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
You're here to help? Excellent! Here, sign this indemnity waiver. And here, this noncompete clause. Let's get you started!
