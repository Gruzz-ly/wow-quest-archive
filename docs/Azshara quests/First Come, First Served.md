==Objectives==
Plant [[Ruckus]]' Flag of Territorial Claim next to the prime real estate locations along [[The Shattered Strand]].
*0/1 Southern Pagoda claimed
*0/1 Big ol' Tower claimed
*0/1 Northern Vista claimed
*[[Flag of Territorial Claim]] (provided)

==Description==
There's some gorgeous beach front property along the shore. I can market this stuff for 10 times what construction will cost me.

The prime spots are that naga pagoda to the south, the tower right next to the water, and the ruins at the far northern end of the beach. I'll give you some coin if you claim them for me before the fighting clears out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2}}
*1,150 [[XP]]
+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
I should probably grab up some of that land along the cliff too. Hmm...

==Completion==
Hah hah! Brilliant. Right fine job there, <boy/girl>.

==Notes==
While you are on this quest, also have [[Halo Drops]] and [[Mop Up]] in your quest log. They can be worked at the same time.

The three locations to plant the flag are easily visible as glowing blue areas along the beach.

Each spot has 1-3 mobs you'll probably want to clear to get safely to the spots. They're {{mob|Spitelash Naga|level=15-16|icon=Naga_Male}}.
*{{Raidicon|Cross}} '''Southern Pagoda'''{{coords|43.90|59.91|Azshara}} - reddish roof, right near the water with a few [[Spitelash Naga|Spitelash]] flags by it. The Southern Pagoda may contain a rare spawn, {{mob|Lady Sesspira|level=17|icon=Naga_Female}}.
*{{Raidicon|Square}} '''Big ol' Tower'''{{coords|43.61|43.41|Azshara}} - can't miss it.
*{{Raidicon|Triangle}} '''Northern Vista'''{{coords|45.47|38.47|Azshara}} - little Greek-looking ruin, tucked into base of a small group of rocks.
