== Objectives ==
Escort a {{NPC||Goblin Surveyor Jr. Grade||Goblin Surveyor}} to the three pieces of Surveyor's Equipment that surround [[Lake Mennar]], and defend her while she takes reading. Another Surveyor can always be summoned with your Surveyor's Beacon.
*Survey West Marker
*Survey North Marker
*Survey East Marker
*[[Surveyor's Beacon]] (provided)

== Description ==
All these cruddy ancient ruins have to be bulldozed if we're ever to see [[Azshara|Azshara's]] full potential. Look on my map here - you see lake Mennar, to the east? I'll tell you what I see: a future rocket depot!

But we need an accurate lay of the land before we can clearcut, bulldoze, landfill, and pave over that lake. All of my surveyors have been spooked off by the oogly-boogleys haunting that area. Escort one of my Jr. grade surveyors to the area and take the readings from the equipment that's been set up.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5}}
*900 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
No buncha dead elves can put a stop to progress. Not on my watch!

== Completion ==
Beautiful work! Now that we know the area better, we can tear this lake a new one.

== Notes ==
{{Cleanup-section}}
Pick up [[A Thousand Stories in the Sand]] before heading out!

This is not an escort in the traditional sense &mdash; the {{NPC||Goblin Surveyor Jr. Grade}} acts as a guardian and does not have a scripted path. Surrounding Mennar are {{NPC||Restless Spirit (Azshara)||Restless Spirits}}. Getting too close to the survey markers will spawn four level 12 shades.
*North @ {{co|34.7|71.6|Azshara}}
*East @ {{co|37.4|74.6|Azshara}}
*West @ {{co|34.3|76.6|Azshara}}

At each spot:
*{{Text|say|Goblin Surveyor Jr. Grade|There's the survey marker!}}
*{{Text|say|Goblin Surveyor Jr. Grade|Watch my back, I need to concentrate on this...
*{{Text|say|Goblin Surveyor Jr. Grade|Here we go - keep those things off of me while I work!}}

:Turn ... back ...
:These grounds ... are not ... yours ...
:{{Text|say|Goblin Surveyor Jr. Grade|I got it!}}
Killing stuff:
*I'm going to put in for hazard pay.
*...and stay dead!
*I'll never make Sr. Grade at this rate...
:{{Text|say|Goblin Surveyor Jr. Grade|That's how it's done!}}
