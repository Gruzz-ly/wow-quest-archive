==Objectives==
Deliver the Scout's Orders to [[Ag'tor Bloodfist]] at the [[Orgrimmar Rear Gate|rear gate]] to [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Scout's Orders (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
The wax seal on these orders has been freshly broken. You can't read the carefully-penned [[night elf|night elven]] script, but a small hand-drawn map indicates the [[Lake Mennar|nearby ruins]]. Underneath the map, written in a [[Darnassian|different language]] entirely, are a series of runes penned in a metallic, shimmering ink.

[[Ag'tor Bloodfist|Ag'tor]] will no doubt want to see this important piece of intelligence.

==Progress==
You found something on one of the bodies, you say? Give it here!

==Completion==
<Ag'tor squints at the parchment, turning it in the light.>

No, I can't make sense of it either, but I don't like what I see. Are these arcane runes?

I'll need you to deliver this to an expert.

==Notes==
Looted from dead scouts killed for [[The Eyes of Ashenvale]].
