==Objectives==
Bring the Tooth of [[Hazzas and Morphaz|Morphaz]] to [[Ogtinc]] in {{C|Azshara}}. Ogtinc resides atop the cliffs northeast the [[Ruins of Eldarath]].
* [[Tooth of Morphaz]]

==Description==
Now I set you on a dangerous hunt to slay the [[green drake]], Morphaz, and bring his tooth to me. Morphaz dwells deep in [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Temple of Atal'Hakkar]], the entrance to which lies in {{C|Swamp of Sorrows}}.

If you wish to defeat him, you must not go alone. This drake is an enemy of many -- seek others who wish to destroy him.

The drake's tooth represents the power a [[hunter]] will find in the company of others. Bring it to me and you will have learned much.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Devilsaur Eye]]
*[[Devilsaur Tooth]]
*[[Hunting Spear]]
* 5900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I see wisdom in your eyes, <name>. Has your hunt ended?

==Completion==
You have learned the old ways, <name>, and for that I offer you a gift from my days as a hunter.

==Progression==
#[[The Hunter's Charm]]
#[[Courser Antlers]]
