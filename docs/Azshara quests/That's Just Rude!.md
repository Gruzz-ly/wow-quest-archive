==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Makrinni]] in the [[Ruins of Arkkoran]].
*Ruins of Arkkoran Makrinni slain (10)

==Description==
I'd share if they asked. They just go clickity-claking up my kawphi plants. So rude! You should teach them a lesson.

Dumb Makrinni.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|900}} (or {{coppercost|780}} at max level)

==Progress==
Nightmares of claws snapping. Nightmares!

==Completion==
Too mean? Naw, not too mean. They deserved it.

I don't gum up their plants. Not ever.

==Notes==
Do this quest along with [[A Little Pick-me-up]] before heading off to do [[Absorbent]] and its follow-up.

Some, but not all, of the [[makrura]] in [[Bilgewater Harbor]] count for this quest as well. You shouldn't need to run there though.
