==Objectives==
Release five Experimental Raptors from their cages in the [[Secret Lab]] and deliver them to {{NPC||The Velocistar||the rocket}} beside {{NPC||Subject Nine}}.
*[[Experimental Raptor]] Delivered x5

== Description ==
Shortly after my intellect was augmented, I bred with {{NPC||Subject Four}} in order to create a unique race of cognitively superior [[raptor]]s. Subsequently, Subject Four neither called nor wrote: I have determined to disembowel him upon our next encounter.

Nonetheless, there are enough raptor children imprisoned in this lab to provide adequate genetic stock for repopulating my race. Please release them from their cages and carry them to the rocket.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||13}}

== Progress ==
My beautiful children may attempt to bite you upon release, but at their stage of physical development, it is unlikely that their attacks will be fatal.

== Completion ==
Wonderful! Exemplary work, <name>. As you have no doubt surmised, my objective with regard to this rocket is to utilize it as a sort of astral cradle, an ark if you will, allowing my newly-forged race to slip the surly bonds of this [[Azeroth|ravaged planet]] and colonize a world to our own liking. You have been instrumental to our cause. Please accept this currency as I will be minting my own monetary units upon arrival. Farewell, <name>!

== Notes ==
Head down to the lab and open up five cages with {{NPC||Experimental Raptor}}s in them. The raptors will ''jump'' on their savior, knocking them down and stacking a Babysitting Raptors "buff": One or more baby raptors are attempting to eat your face. Zoom in and look close. Freeing more than five will cause any additional raptors to simply run away instead of jumping on.
