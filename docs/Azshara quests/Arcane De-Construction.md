==Objectives==
Slay [[Apprentice Investigator]]s and [[Apprentice Illuminator]]s to collect 10 Attuned Runestones.
*[[Attuned Runestone]] (10)

==Description==
Arcane constructs are creatures spawned of pure mana and intellect. In the right hands, a construct allows its user to quickly assimilate vast riches of arcane knowledge. But they're dangerous, <name>. So intelligent! So powerful! So very vulnerable to external tampering...

Let's teach these amateurs a lesson and use their own magic against them. Slay Apprentices and collect their runestones for me. Contact me via the lower scrying stone when you're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Andorel's image is blurry and indistinct. He squints at you and taps against the glass of the scrying stone.>

<name>, is that you? The resolution on this stone is terrible. What kind of hardware are they using?

==Completion==
Good work getting those runestones. To be honest, I only needed one, but the thought of so many night elves slain for such useless baubles fills me with a dark, giddy joy.

Please hold one of those runes up to the scrying stone to let me see. Hmmm. As I suspected, an amateur effort at best.
