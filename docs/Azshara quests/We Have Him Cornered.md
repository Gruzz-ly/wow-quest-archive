==Objectives==
Kill Trade Prince Gallywix.
* [[Gallywix Impersonator|Trade Prince Gallywix]] slain {{co|21.0|60.6|Azshara}}

==Description==
Did you hear Gallywix barking orders to his servants and thugs? Still concerned with frivolities as we edge ever closer.

He feels safe in his petulant palace of profits. He should not.

Even here, we will strike down Trade Prince Gallywix. For the [[Alliance]]!

("Trade Prince Gallywix: No time like the present... to get rich!")

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,780 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Completion==
The Gallywix that we fought was a decoy? A body double?

Infuriating. We were so close... I'm sorry, <name>.

==Notes==
Down south.

Aggro and during the fight:
:{{text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Welcome to the Gallywix PAIN Palace, ya grimy thief!}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|All the wealth you've amassed and this is what you build, Gallywix? A den of depravity!}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|Your ego is as bloated as your body. Think of the good you could've done for this world!}}
:{{text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Eh, what's the world done for me?}}

At 25%, the decoy suit explodes, killing the Gallywix Impersonator:
:{{text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Whoa... Whoa... The suit's malfunctioning!}}
:{{text|say|Gallywix Impersonator|I should've... bought... the warranty option...}}
:''Gallywix himself appears.''
:{{text|yell|Trade Prince Gallywix|Ha! I wish you could see the looks on your faces right now.}}
:{{text|yell|Trade Prince Gallywix|You fell for the oldest trick in the [[Bilgewater Cartel|Bilgewater]] book: high-quality, low-paid laborers!}}
:{{text|yell|Trade Prince Gallywix|Those mech suits ain't cheap, though, <name>. I'm gonna be sendin' you the bill for that one!}}
:{{text|yell|Trade Prince Gallywix|See ya later, losers!}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|We were hunting a decoy Gallywix that whole time? [[Goblin]]s truly are the worst.}}
