==Objectives==
Kill [[Lord Kassarus]] in the [[Temple of Zin-Malor]].
*[[Lord Kassarus]] slain
*[[Gob Squad Flare]] (provided)

==Description==
They taught us at officers camp to always cut off the head of the snake. Seemed dumb considering we never fought any snakes, but I guess it kind of makes sense now.

Take your men in there and kill [[Lord Kassarus]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
You look to still be in one piece.

==Completion==
Glad you're on our side, soldier.

==Notes==
During the fight, [[Lord Kassarus]] tosses Impaling Spines on the ground. Pick them up and throw them back at the boss to give him a debuff that causes him to take 50% more damage, killing him faster.
