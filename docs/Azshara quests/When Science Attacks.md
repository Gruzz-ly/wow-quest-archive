==Objectives==
Use the Fireliminator X-21 to extinguish 8 fires and to rescue 6 Research Interns from the inferno at the [[Secret Lab]].

See [[Assistant Greely]] at the [[Southern Rocketway Terminus]] if you lose your Fireliminator.
*Lab Fires Extinguished (8)
*[[Research Intern]]s Rescued (6)
*[[Fireliminator X-21]] (provided)

==Description==
Did you see the explosions on the way in? The Secret Lab is engulfed in flames! Again! If we don't stamp out those flames we're going to hit critical temperatacity and resonate into a meltdown cascade.

Here, I'm entrusting you with a canister of experimental hypercooled pressurized liquigel: The most volatile fire retardant known to science! (Keep that canister away from open flame.) Put out the fires and hose down my interns, then contact me via the squawkbox in central control.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6}}
*900 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
<Greely's squeaky voice peels through a set of speakers.>

Rocketway to Secret Lab! Come in, Secret Lab...

==Completion==
Nice work, <name>! Now we need to decouple the reaction core matrix from the fuel sumps, or that whole place is gonna blow itself to [[Outland]]...

==Notes==
Before heading to the lab, head east past the flight master to [[Bombardier Captain Smooks]]. He offers [[Mortar the Point]], which also involves the lab.

On fire interns
*This whole place is gonna blow!
*My flesh!
*Again with the flames and the hurt.
*Fire ... FIRE!
*I'm on fire. Note that in the logs!
*The goggles! They do nothing!
On extinguishing interns
*That wasn't as bad as it looked.
*Make a note: Fire bad.
*Whew, thanks! I'm going to check and see if these results are repeatable.
*This is one of our less productive colossal disasters.
*Thank you, thank you!
*I'm going to go find some ointment.

While on the way to the lab, [[Twistex Happytongs]] offers [[Bad Science! Bad!]].
