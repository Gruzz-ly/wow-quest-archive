:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Boarding [[the Spear of Durotar]], are we?  You are to be envied, Horde marine!}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|You are about to rip the horizon a new sky-hole aboard a sensational new era in aeronautical innovation.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|It's been recklessly engineered with a merciless disregard for both budgetary concerns and those cumbersome, inefficient "laws of physics."}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|Not a penny was wasted on comfort or personal safety!}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|While you wait for its arrival, my assistant and I will momentarily demonstrate some of the features of this remarkable craft.}}
:{{text|say|Loudspeaker|Zeppelin arrival in five minutes.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|As you know, air weighs nothing.  So to create a lighter-than-air vessel, we had to bend a few rules.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|We bent the crap outta them!}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|The Spear of Durotar is filled to the bursting point with combustible, super-heated gas.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Bilgewater engineers have taken advantage of its inherent high-altitude instability and resultant low-cost.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|We passed the savings on to us.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|We've mitigated the explosive instability of the gas by putting it under IMMENSE pressure.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Doing so required the removal of a number of safety valves that kept erupting}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|Ask yourself: what good is a "safety" valve if it keeps going off?  That doesn't sound very safe to me.}}
:{{text|say|Loudspeaker|Zeppelin arrival in four minutes.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|Tell 'em about the engines, boss.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Oh my, yes.  In order to maximize both range and payload, we've concocted an unorthodox blend of rocket fuels for the state-of-the-art engines.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|We call it "Doom Juice."}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|It is so energy-dense as to combust at the slightest provocation.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|Even verbal.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|This stuff is so volatile, it probably shouldn't be moved.  Much less... flown.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|To ensure a rapid crew response in the event of a fire, fuel storage has been moved away from the crew quarters and placed beneath the passenger compartment}}
:{{text|say|Loudspeaker|Zeppelin arrival in three minutes.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Your course today will take you directly across the great sea.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|An enormous, unforgiving expanse of pounding grey waves, freezing temperatures, and ravenous sea life.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|In the unlikely event of a water "landing," please reach under your seat cushion where a cyanide capsule has been located for your convenience.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Trust me, friend, a rapid pill-induced death is far preferable to the long, agonizing process of hypothermia and subsequent dismemberment by sharks.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|For those of you allergic to almonds, our cyanide capsules come in an assortment of flavors.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Don't ask how we know what they taste like.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|You'll also find a complimentary bag of peanuts.}}
:{{text|say|Loudspeaker|Zeppelin arrival in two minutes.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Should your zeppelin be attacked en-route, panic is inadvisable.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Instead, look for a number of deck-mounted flak cannons positioned for just such an emergency.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|Nothing keeps a fleet of combustible dirigibles safer than randomly flinging molten metal in every conceivable direction!}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Greely, Show them how the guns work.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|With Pleasure!}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Simply aim and pull the trigger.  Or don't aim.  I wash my hands of the whole thing}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|I can hit my house from here!}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Greely, you're not randomly firing that thing into Bilgewater Port, are you?}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|No.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|Maybe.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|A little.}}
:{{text|say|Loudspeaker|Zeppelin arrival in one minute.  One minute.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|In the unlikely event that a catastrophic failure does not instantly kill everyone aboard...}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|...a number of parachutes will appear along the railings}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|We call them "Emergency Rampless Debarkation Devices."}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Simply grab a nearby parachute to be vaulted clear of the burning zeppelin.  Hopefully onto dry land.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Greely, would you like to demonstrate how our parachutes work?}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|Oh hells no! Those things are death-traps!}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Very well then.  I see that the Spear of Durotar has almost arrived.}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Your safety and well-being are no longer any concern of mine.}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|From all of us at Bilgewater Harbor...}}
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|Have fun storming the Highlands!}}
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Have fun storming the Highlands!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Take us out, Mister Gearchum.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Chart to course east with all possible speed, we will rendezvous with the main fleet.}}
:{{text|say|[[Fergus Gearchum]]|Aye aye, sir.}}

:{{text|say|Fergus Gearchum|Sir, the fleet is straight ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Match altitude and speed, Mister Gearchum.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Signal the fleet to fall into formation.}}
:{{text|say|Fergus Gearchum|Approaching the Thandol Span, sir.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Order the fleet into close formation.  Keep it tight, everyone!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Heart of Orgrimmar, you're coming in too low.  Too low!}}
:{{text|yell| Captain Krazz|Pull up! Pull down! PULL SOMETHING!}}
:{{text|yell| Fergus Gearchum|Oh, the Goblinity!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|The valley should mask our movements. Stay low. Stay close.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|I don't want to see any more mistakes!}}
:{{text|yell| [[Garrosh Hellscream]]|Fellow warriors of the Horde. Hear me now!}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|Ahead hides our foe. Worshippers of chaos who seek to remake the world.}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|A new world is coming, friends. But it is not the world of their design.}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|Together, we will crush the Twilight's Hammer, raze their stronghold,}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|salt the earth, and burn the bodies. All will tremble at our might.}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|Then we will stand astride this world as its masters -}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|united in our conviction, unrivaled in strength, beholden to no one.}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|Today, WE will remake the world. Our world. FOR THE HORDE!}}
:{{text|say|Fergus Gearchum|Coming up on the Twilight Highlands, Captain.}}
:{{text|say|[[Kor'kron Air Marine]]|Look - dwarves. Hah! They sulk like prairie dogs in holes in the ground.}}
:{{text|say|Fergus Gearchum|Captain, sir! Alliance naval fleet sighted off the port bow.}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|The Alliance steams in close formation without escort.}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|Air guard, attack!! Strafe them now, while they cannot maneuver!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|What - WHAT!? What does he think he's DOING?  The carriers are unprotected.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|What kind of madman orders away his close air support?}}
:{{text|say|Kor'kron Air Marine|A winner.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Mister Gearchum, signal the fleet. Defensive formations!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|We're without our escort. I want to see interlocking fields of fire. Now, now!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|What the WHAT!?}}
:{{text|yell| Kor'kron Air Marine|It's an attack!}}
:{{text|yell| Captain Krazz|The guns, man the guns! Fire everything we've got!}}
:{{text|say|Kor'kron Air Marine|They're after the Warchief -}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|GET!}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|OFF!}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|MY!}}
:{{text|say|Kor'kron Air Marine|The Warchief's zeppelin is in flames! It's going down!}}
:{{text|yell| Garrosh Hellscream|SHIP!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Egah - all hands aft. One's aboard. Shoot it! Kill it!}}
:{{text|say|Fergus Gearchum|It's tangled up in the rigging.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Somebody, DO SOMETHING! That's an order!}}
:{{text|say|Fergus Gearchum|She's breaking up, sir!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Krazz|Tamp down the inflammants. Batten up the gear carriage. Rudder for the shore.}}
:{{text|yell| Captain Krazz|Everyone, to the parachutes!}}
:{{text|yell| Captain Krazz|Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Bail out everyone. BAIL!}}
