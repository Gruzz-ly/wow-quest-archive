==Objectives==
Use a [[Goblin Mortar]] to slaughter 60 Spitelash Attackers.
*Spitelash Attackers blown to bits x60

==Description==
Hey bud! Like explosions? Of course you do. Who doesn't like explosions?!

I've got mortars set up on the ridge ot the east to hold the naga back. Go forth, recruit. Mortar them... mortar them all! Ahahahah.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Kaboom Leggings
|Mortar-Slinger Belt
|Salvoblast Tunic
|Belt of Explosive Potential
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
KABOOM!

==Completion==
Can you believe they PAY us to do this?

==Notes==
Head east, hop in. The mortars only have one ability:
*{{abilities|Mortar Round|range=10-70|Deals 400 to 600 Fire damage to naga within 15 yards of impact.}}
[[Spitelash Myrmidon]] are level 12-13 male naga with 247-273 health and [[Spitelash Screamer]]s are 11-12 female naga with 199-219 health. Don't worry about naga getting through the barrage, as the hill leading up is filled with land mines with a pretty long-range knockback.
