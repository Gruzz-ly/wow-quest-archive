==Objectives==
Speak to {{npc||Sorata Firespinner}} at the [[Northern Rocketway Exchange]].

==Description==
Delicious!

Azy always trying to get his hands on magic artifacts. Said he was trying to make friends with that archmage person. [[Archmage Xylem|Xylem]]!

Xylem has LOTS of apprentices. Takes in all kinds, burns'm out, leaves them wandering all over. High turnover.

Last one was last night. Headed over towards that big goblin tower construction thing, way west. Maybe he'll help you meet Xylem? Maybe Xylem knows where Azy is?

Play nice!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|700}} (or {{coppercost|570}} at max level)

==Completion==
Look buddy, I was in your shoes not a week ago. Big powerful Archmage actually takes on apprentices! Who could pass up an opportunity like that?!

Sometimes, things really are just too good to be true.

This will take a while despite Gurgll's fast speed due to the roundabout way you must travel. Still, it is probably faster than travelling on foot, at least for those at the appropriate level. For those with a flying mount, there is a button to dismount from Gurgll.

On arrival, Gurgll will perform the following emote and despawn:
