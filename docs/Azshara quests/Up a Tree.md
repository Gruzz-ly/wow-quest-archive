== Objectives ==
Use the {{NPC||Reprogrammed Shredder||shredder's}} buzzsaw to cut down Azshara Saplings, and kill 9 Talrendis Snipers as they emerge.
*[[Talrendis Sniper]] slain (9)

== Description ==
Hold still a second, I'm going to bring your main buzzsaw controls online.

[[Night elf|Night elven]] snipers from [[Talrendis Point|Talrendis]] have been highting in the trees, taking potshots at my workers. I want you to take care of those snipers... by first taking care of those trees. Look for Azshara saplings east of the [[Orgrimmar Rear Gate|main gates]]. Your [[goblin shredder|shredder]] will know what to do. Chop to it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*875 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Are my workers safe?

== Completion ==
Great work, <name>! That's how we took care of business back on [[Kezan]].

== Notes ==
:{{Text|bossemote|Shredder Blades Activated.}}

The shredder now has two abilities:
#{{abilities|Buzzsaw|range=5|Saw down a nearby tree or damage nearby enemies.|notes=0.1 sec cast|cd=3 sec}}
#{{abilities|Fling Blade|range=35|Eject a pair of sawblades at enemy night elves up to 35 yards away.|notes=0.1 sec cast|cd=3 sec}}

Walk up to a tree and use the Buzzsaw to knock it down. 3 snipers will jump out.
