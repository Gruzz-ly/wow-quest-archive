== Objectives ==
You've been sent to meet with the goblin assassin Slinky Sharpshiv at the base of the northern tower of Talrendis Point.

== Description ==
He's here, <name>! Captain Grunwald is a high-ranking Alliance officer from Northwatch Hold, no doubt here to coordinate an assault on Orgrimmar with his night elven allies. We have observed him entering the tower southwest of here. I want his head, <class>. I want to send it back to Northwatch to drive a wedge between our enemies!

I've sent a goblin assassin, Slinky Sharpshiv, to the tower but she hasn't returned. Go find her. And get me that head!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*155 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
You're just in time, <class>. I'm about to launch a lightning-strike precision assassination. Let's see...

Explosives? Check.<br>
Pneumatic grapplestabber? Check.<br>
Portable parachute? Check.<br>
Crippling nerve toxin?<br>

<Slinky Sharpshiv licks one of her blades.>

Check. Let's do this thing.
