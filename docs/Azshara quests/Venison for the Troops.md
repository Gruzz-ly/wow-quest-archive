== Objectives ==
Collect 15 Slabs of Venison from {{NPC||Weakened Mosshoof Stag}}s.
*[[Slab of Venison]] x15

== Description ==
As we chew up the resources of [[Azshara|this land]] for our war machines, we deprive the local animals of their homes. If they are to die anyway, we should not allow that meat to go to waste. Not when the maw of [[Orgrimmar]] gapes open, hungry.

Kill the weakened mosshoof stags that remain in this area and collect their meat for our peons and grunts.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
You smell of fresh kill, <class>.

== Completion ==
Meat - and lots of it! Well done. This will keep bellies full as we build our arsenal.
