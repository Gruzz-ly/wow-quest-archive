== Objectives ==
Take the Crystal Pendant to the [[Weapons Cabinet]] in the [[Mountainfoot Strip Mine]] Headquarters.
*[[Crystal Pendant]] (provided)

== Description ==
If that prism of yours is tuned to refract a basilisk's gaze, we can use its crystal properties to reverse the process. All we need is a source of power.

In the weapons cabinet to your right, you'll find our prototype laser mining drill. I loved that thing but the near daily dismemberments got to be a real bother. Grab the laser drill and swap out the lens with that crystal of yours...

== Progress ==
<The weapons cabinet is loaded with heinous and broken experimental devices, some of which still have [[goblin]] limbs attached. You discover the laser drill lovingly ensconced in a velvet-lined wooden case.>

== Completion ==
<You pop out the lens assembly and slide the crystal into place. The weapon hums ominously.>

== Notes ==
Run across the room.
