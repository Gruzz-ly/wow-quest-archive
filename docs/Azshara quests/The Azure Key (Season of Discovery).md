'''The Azure Key''' is the [[Rogue]] class-specific [[Temple_of_Atal'Hakkar_(Classic)#Quest_guide|Sunken Temple Quest]].  It is a long quest chain that yields a very good {{quality|rare}} item for its level.

==Objectives==
Return the Azure Key to [[Lord Jorach Ravenholdt]].
*[[Azure Key]]

==Description==
It will take some time to decipher the fragments and remove the enchantment. When I am complete, I'll deliver the bag to Lord Ravenholdt personally.

There is still the matter of the key, said to be held by a green drake known as [[Hazzas and Morphaz|Morphaz]]. The drake has made its home deep in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Temple of Atal'Hakkar]], the entrance to which lies in the {{C|Swamp of Sorrows}}.

Gather your friends and venture to his lair. Lord Ravenholdt will await your return with the key.

==Rewards==
You will be receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*5900 [[XP]]
*[[Ebon Mask]]
*[[Whisperwalk Boots]]
*[[Duskbat Drape]]

==Progress==
The bag has already arrived from [[Archmage Xylem]], have you found the key?

==Completion==
The key!  I thought it lost forever.  Please, take an enchanted garment from my stores—they are reserved for rogues of exceptional skill and loyalty.  It should be known that <name> is not to be trifled with!

<Jorach opens the bag and is bathed by a golden glow from within.  His eyes widen and he stares...>
