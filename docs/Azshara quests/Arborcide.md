== Objectives ==
Use the {{NPC||Reprogrammed Shredder||shredder}} to destroy the Talrendis Ancient. Emergency {{NPC||Backup Shredder}}s are available at the [[Orgrimmar Rear Gate]] if you lose yours.
*[[Talrendis Ancient]] slain

== Description ==
How's that [[goblin shredder|shredder]] holding up? I think I can bring your emergency power supplies online - that'll recharge you when you're wounded.

Listen, these [[night elf|night elves]] are being strengthened by an [[Ancient of War|ancient of war]] who's taken root just west of the gates. he's a big, giant tree. You know what to do! Take him out!

You were made for this!!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Woodchipper Dagger|Chopped Off Ancient Limb|Arborcide Axe}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||11|30}}
*1100 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
You did it, <name>! The invaders have pulled back and they told me I was crazy for installing a grenade launcher on a woodchipper...

Great work with the Shredder. With an impressive showing like that right here on {{NPC||Garrosh Hellscream||the Warchief's}} doorstep, the [[Horde]] can't doubt what [[goblin technology]] can do for them. I owe you a big thanks!

== Notes ==
:{{Text|bossemote|Emergency Power Reserves Online.}}

The shredder gains one last ability:
*{{abilities|Recharge|Tap emergency power reserves, healing the shredder for 70% of its maximum health.|notes=Instant|cd=12 sec}}

Head west along the path to the [[Ancient Grove]]. There, at {{co|21.5|75.9|Azshara}}, the Talrendis Ancient awaits, initially friendly. Getting too close will turn it hostile, however:
:{{text|yell|Talrendis Ancient|Keep your machines away from me, <race>! You'll be cleansed from this land like the weeds you are!}}

Get about 20 yards away and spam the grenades, using fling blade ability when it's off cooldown. The new ability is a heal, so take advantage of it!
