== Objectives ==
Retrieve 12 Military Supply Packs from the central minefield.
*[[Military Supplies]] x12

== Description ==
First thing's first - we need more supplies for you and the other new recruits. There are some perfectly good standard issue packs on the bodies of our last round of recruits, in the minefield to the north.

Taking their lessons to heart, I'd recommend you avoid stepping on mines yourself.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*900 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}
*2x [[Molotov Cocktail]]

== Progress ==
Nothing wrong with recycled goods.

== Completion ==
You're a light-footed bugger, aren't ya? Good work.

Here are a few of the supplies to keep you lively.

== Notes ==
Head north. The minefield is between the two ridges on the ramp leading down from the Forlorn Ridge to the Ruins of Eldrath. The land mines have a ~10 yd proximity radius, so be careful. They only knock back and don't inflict any damage. Also, use the knockbacks as a way of launching across the area: the knockback happens along a line from the land mine to the player away from the land mine. Also, there are a few dead soldiers near {{NPC||Warlord Krellian}} north of the minefield.
