==Objectives==
Complete the [[Trial of Frost]] by gathering 20 Essence of Ice without getting hit by Frostburn.
*Frost Trial Completed

==Description==
You know, some of my apprentices have called me cold hearted. I always say though, I shall not let the temperature of my body parts stand in the way of true learning.

To reach the Trial of Frost, touch the Frost crystal to open a portal. Once there, the goal is quite simple - gather the little floaty ice orb thingies.

To counter the simple, the rotating Frostburns may put back your progress, as it were. If you want to be fancy, you can use the rune traps to jump over them as they rotate by. Neat, eh?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|840}} at max level)

==Progress==
No. Just no. Do it right this time.

==Completion==
Brilliant. You certainly don't let cold feet stop you. Or cold any part for that matter!

No? ...too soon?

==Notes==
You can get the achievement [[Glutton for Icy Punishment]] while doing this quest, by avoiding the [[Eye of Frost|Eyes of Frost]].
