==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Kajind]]'s blade from the [[Ceruleos|blue drake]] roaming south-east of [[Forlorn Ridge]] in {{C|Azshara}}.
*[[Kajind's Blade]]

==Description==
Battle is all I know, <name>. During the [[Third War|third war]], countless fell before my blade. When the war ended, I made my way as a prize fighter. That is when I came upon [[Thunderdrome|the arena]] of [[Gadgetzan]].

My days there were glorious, but I soon tired of being [[Champion (rank)|champion]]. I came to Azshara in search of a greater challenge; a blue drake who roams south-east of here. Alas, the creature got the better of me. I escaped alive, but my blade was taken for its hoard.

If you recover my blade, I will return with you to Gadgetzan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4700 [[XP]]
*{{cost||75}}

==Progress==
I do not fault your hesitation, <race>. The drake is a fearsome foe.

==Completion==
Where once I failed, you have succeeded. You have my deepest respect and gratitude, <name>. Perhaps you will best me in the arena as well.

==Progression==
{{The Old Champ}}
