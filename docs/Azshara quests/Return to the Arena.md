==Objectives==
Return to [[Fizbuz Mithril]] in [[Gadgetzan]], {{C|Tanaris}}.

==Description==
I am an [[orc]] of my word. You have avenged me, and I will return your favor in kind. Go to Gadgetzan and tell Fizbuz he has his champion back.

I hope to see you in [[Thunderdrome|the ring]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Spectacular! Everyone'll be going nuts when they hear ol' [[Kajind]]'s back in town.

And did you say you killed [[Ceruleos|a dragon]] for the guy!? Sounds like you'll be quite the draw yourself.

I can feel it now, <name>. We're about to have a rumble for the ages in here!
