== Objectives ==
Retrieve the Sarcen Stone from the bottom of [[Lake Mennar]].
*[[Sarcen Stone]]

== Description ==
Before she died, {{NPC||Kalytha}} was charged with burying something at the bottom of the lake, a powerful artifact that the archmages of [[Mennar Academy|Mennar]] spent their last moments creating. No doubt Malynea Skyreaver will want to see the artifact, presuming it still exists. You resolve to search the bottom of Lake Mennar for the Sarcen Stone.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bottom-Wader Boots

|Weighted Chain Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

== Progress ==
Did you discover anything at the lake? You're soaking wet.

== Completion ==
A Sarcen stone? That's the stuff of legend - let me see that!

<Name>, Sarcen stones are used to redirect the [[ley line]]s of magical energy. You realize what this means? The mages of Mennar weren't staying behind out of misguided loyalty. They sacrificed their lives in order to create this artifact in an attempt to draw energy away from the portal through which the demons were flooding Azeroth. They were buying time for the rest of the world to fight back! History never recorded their deeds. What a discovery!

== Notes ==
South of the arch in the middle of the lake on the lakebed is an Ancien Stone Cask, mostly buried.
