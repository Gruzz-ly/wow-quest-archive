== Objectives ==
Find the Keystone Shard nearby

== Description ==
The air around this strange stone crackles with energy. The stone itself is smooth and icy cold. It pulses periodically as you run your hands over it, like the crashing of surf.

A wedge-shaped piece appears to be missing from the top surface of the artifact. This 'keystone shard' is likely the key to unlocking the secrets of the stone. Search the grounds near the temple and locate the keystone shard.

== Progress ==
The naga power stone pulses with an expectant hum.

== Completion ==
The keystone shard slides into place and previously invisible runes suddenly erupt onto the surface of the stone, shimmering in blue and violet hues. Your knees buckle as powerful arcane currents suddenly race into your body...

== Notes ==
Follow the path to the northwest. The shard is in the middle of the outcrop at {{co|57.5|70.9|Azshara}}.

Completing the quest buffs players with Stormward: The might of the sea surrounds you, increasing all of your resistances by 10. 15 min duration.
