== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Talrendis Lorekeepers and locate a [[Lorekeeper's Summoning Stone|Lorekeeper Summoning Stone]] somewhere within [[Talrendis Point]].
*[[Talrendis Lorekeeper]] slain x5

== Description ==
Are you sensitive to the tremors of the local [[Ley line|ley-lines]], <name>? I can feel the occasional thrum, like the plucking of a string. It's the kind of resonance I'd expect from a long-range summoning spell. The Lorekeepers in Talrendis, with their laughably primitive magics, are trying to summon in backup from [[Darnassus]].

We can use this to our advantage, <name>. If you can compromise their summoning stone, we can teleport a crack team of commandos behind enemy lines.

Locate the summoning stone in Talrendis!

==Progress==
If Andorel's instructions are to be believed, it should be easy to refocus the stone's energies.

== Completion ==
Images of a great and distant tree flood your mind. Your stomach lurches as you reorient the stone, briefly filling your senses with visions of a fiery portal, a towering mountain, a frigid wasteland, and a terrible scar across the earth.

After a moment, the magical energies of the stone calm, and you feel you are but a step away from Valormok. Andorel's invasion can begin...
