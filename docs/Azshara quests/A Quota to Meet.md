== Objectives ==
Gather 20 ingots of Mountainfoot Iron from the [[Mountainfoot Strip Mine]] in [[Azshara]].
*[[Mountainfoot Iron]] x20

== Description ==
Mountainfoot iron is a brittle alloy, but with the right bribes it meets [[goblin]] safety standards. {{NPC||Horzak Zignibble||Zignibble}} here is having trouble on the production end of things, but that doesn't change any of my deadlines. I've got a quota to fill!

Head down into the Mountainfoot Strip Mine and gather up any ingots of Mountainfoot iron you find. There should be piles of it smelted and ready for shipment.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
*875 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Did you get my shipment together?

== Completion ==
Well done! When it comes to iron, always pick quantity over quality.

== Notes ==
There are individual ingots scattered about, but there are also stockpiles which can have up to five ingots at a time.
