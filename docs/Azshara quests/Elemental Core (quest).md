==Objectives==
Bring the core to [[Duke Hydraxis]] in [[Azshara]].
* [[Elemental Core]]

==Description==
<A burned-out core from the [[elemental]]s you encountered.

When you concentrate, you can sense that some elemental energy still exists, deep within the core.

They were clearly after the [[:Azerite]], but why?

It might be time to call in an old favor.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yes? I am no longer in the business of fire prevention.

Oh, you have questions about the [[elemental plane]]s? They are in quite a state at the moment. Though the elements are always tumultuous, things have gotten quite out of hand.

The presence of this [[:Azerite]] has ignited the lesser lords, and each seeks to overthrow the current lords and take the plane for themselves.

They see this new element as a sign of elemental rebirth.

I do not see this. Here, I do not want even the gems I have, take them.
