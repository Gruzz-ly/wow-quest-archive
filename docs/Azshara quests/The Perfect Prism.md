== Objectives ==
Acquire a Crystal Pendant from a {{NPC||Talrendis Saboteur}} in the [[Mountainfoot Strip Mine]].
*[[Crystal Pendant]]

== Description ==
There's got to be a way to reverse the {{NPC||Greystone Basilisk||basilisks'}} stonification. Those irritating [[night elf]] saboteurs who have been lurking around my mine must know something we don't. They seem to be immune to the gaze of the beast!

I want you to find out their secret, <name>. Pick off a few of the [[Talrendis Point|Talrendis]] saboteurs skulking about in the rear of the strip mine and get a sample of whatever charm or ding-dong they're wearing to give them immunity. radio me from the main forge building once you're successful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*875 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
<Strange goblin speakers hiss and crackle.>

== Completion ==
<Zignibble's voice squawks over the speakers.>

Is that you, <name>? Still alive? You aren't trashing my explosive stockpiles are you?

Hmmm... you say you found a clear crystal pendant. That makes sense. A perfect prism would refract the gaze of the basilisk. Maybe we can use this to our advantage. Time to drop some science!

== Notes ==
Head toward the southwest part of the dig. Saboteurs will either drop [[Shattered Crystal Pendant]]s or [[Crystal Pendant]]s. Then enter the forge itself at {{co|20.3|70.4|Azshara}} to use the radio.

On complete:
