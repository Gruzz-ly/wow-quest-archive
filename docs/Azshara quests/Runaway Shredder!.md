== Objectives ==
Attack one of the {{NPC||Runaway Shredder||runaway shredders}} near the [[Orgrimmar Rear Gate|rear gates]] of [[Orgrimmar]] and hop inside once it's been significantly damaged.
*Runaway Shredder Captured

== Description ==
I've been trying to impress our new [[Horde]] allies with our legendary [[goblin]] efficiency, but in hindsight automating the [[goblin shredder|shredders]] was a bad idea. Now they're mindless killing machines, rampaging over the countryside. Don't get me wrong - that kind of thing has its place - but for the time being I need a brave <class> to help me get these things under control.

It's easy. Automated shredders, like all machines, must first be beaten into submission. Afterwards, seize the controls and I'll radio you instructions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==

Hey <name>! Are you reading this?

Piloting that sucker is easy. Push the pedals for your pedal controls and, ah, move the levers for your lever controls. Got it?

== Completion ==

== Notes ==
Head to the southeast. It will take more-or-less killing a runaway shredder to pacify it.
