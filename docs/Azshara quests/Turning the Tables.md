==Objectives==
Speak to [[Anara]] to return to the world of the living, then meet with [[Kalecgos]] at the [[Northern Rocketway Terminus]].

==Description==
[[Azuregos]] and Kalecgos are due to meet up at the Northern Rocketway Terminus. You should meet with them there to make sure that Kalecgos doesn't require any additional help.

Should you prefer to not be dead, Anara will likely be able to help.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1100}} (or {{coppercost|900}} at max level)

==Completion==
Great to see you again! Thank you for finding Azuregos and sending him to me.

I do feel I owe you an apology - I may have undersold how difficult it would be to accomplish the task I gave you. You performed quite admirably, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Azuregos quest chain}}

==Notes==
Despite what the quest says, it is not necessary to talk to Anara. Running far enough out of the phased zone cancels the fake-death phasing effect and returns you to the main world.

==Patch changes==
