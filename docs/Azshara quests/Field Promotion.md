==Objectives==
Report to [[Captain Tork]] at the forward post in the [[Ruins of Eldarath]].

==Description==
[[Commander Molotov]] sent word directly that you should be dispatched to our forward post. We're preparing to send squads into the ruins to route the naga and recover the artifact, and he would like you to lead one of them.

Get to the northwest corner of the beach and follow the path up to our forward post.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||22|60}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Completion==
<Name>! You made it in one piece, good.

We've got a lot of work for you to handle for us inside the ruins, but we're sending you in with the best to take care of it. You're working with GAMA Force now, Goblin Army: Mergers and Acquisitions. Molotov says you can handle it - that's all I need to hear.
