== Objectives ==
Search [[Bilgewater Harbor]] and convince 12 AWOL Grunts to report for duty.
* [[AWOL Grunt]] Disciplined (12)

== Description ==
It was a bad idea to muster the troops in this festering goblin metropolis. Every vice that coin can buy is within arm's reach. Our mighty veterans are running rampant, blowing years of [[Northrend]] back-pay in a city-wide debacle.

Can you make a sweep through the city and gather up any stragglers that have gone AWOL?

My axebite warriors are unmatched on the battlefield, but I won't have them disgrace their uniforms while on shore leave.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}}

==Progress==
Have you found my missing troops?

Be sure to search every filthy back-alley. If there's trouble, they'll find it.

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>! Most of my soldiers have already reported for duty, some a little worse for the wear.

One night in Bilgewater makes a hard orc humble.

Still, fresh fighting in the [[Twilight Highlands]] should restore discipline.

==Progression==
{{To Twilight Highlands}}

== Trivia ==
The line "One night in Bilgewater makes a hard orc humble" paraphrases a line in "One Night in Bangkok" from the musical Chess.
