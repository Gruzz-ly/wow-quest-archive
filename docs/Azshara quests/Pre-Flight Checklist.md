== Objectives ==
Talk to [[Captain Krazz]] at [[Bilgewater Harbor]] in [[Azshara]].

== Description ==
This new engine is extremely fast. And dangerous. I'd use the word "volatile."

That's the way the Captain likes it.

Run back up the hill and let him know that I'll install this bad boy right now and that he should meet me at the construction site.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5520 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
My airship has engines? At last!

Now we can rip the heavens a new one!

Once the ground and naval forces are ready, we're going to light up the skies over the [[Twilight Highlands]].

==Progression==
{{To Twilight Highlands}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
