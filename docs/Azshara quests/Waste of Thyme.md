==Objectives==
Collect 8 bundles of Living Ire Thyme near the [[Ruins of Nordressa]].
*[[Living Ire Thyme]] (8)

==Description==
[[File:Living Ire Thyme.jpg|thumb|Living Ire Thyme]]
Living Ire Thyme. I must have more! Be quick about it, will you?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|840}} at max level)

==Progress==
Do you have that thyme for me? 

==Completion==
Perfect. It's quite interesting how useful the most random things end up being to incantations of this sort.

So much more to learn! 

==Notes==
These flowers grow near trees and are somewhat difficult to see, but having your ground clutter settings low can help. They give a temporary damage buff when picked, which can help with doing [[Shear Will]] at the same time as this quest.
