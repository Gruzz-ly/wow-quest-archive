==Objectives==
Locate [[Ergll]] on the coast of the [[Ruins of Arkkoran]].

==Description==
[[Blue dragonflight|My brothers]] and I are being hunted.

[[Malygos|Our sire]] was recently killed and the [[black dragonflight]] seeks to route those of us that still live. I'm here to find [[Azuregos]] and take him to safety, if only he would let it be that easy.

Azuregos doesn't make many friends, and his taste in them tends to be a bit... unique. The only one I know of here is a [[murloc]] named Ergll. You should be able to find him on the coast northeast of here.

Do whatever it takes to find Azuregos and send him to me.

Please hurry.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|700}} (or {{coppercost|570}} at max level)

==Completion==
Hello there! A new friend! So glad to meet you. My name is Ergll. The g is silent.

==Notes==
This is one of the best times to get the achievement [[Joy Ride]] - instead of using Kalec's waterwalking buff, fly to [[Southern Rocketway Terminus]], and ride the rocket all the way to [[Northern Rocketway Terminus]]. [[Ergll]] is but a stone's throw away from the northern terminus.
