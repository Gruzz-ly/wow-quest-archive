==Objectives==
Use your [[Personal Arcane Assistant]] to turn 12 Legash demons into [[Cockroach|insects]] and then squash them.
*Polymorphed Cockroach slain (12)

==Description==
Look at you. Doing errands. Quite responsible of you. You're moving up up up, you are... up up!

There be demons ahead! Demons of many unpleasant kinds. Demons that would quite like your innards! Legash demons of a southeasternly heading! But do not worry. No no, no reason to worry, for I shall provide you with a companion!

Point, bugify, squash. Point, bugify, squash! Quite efficient. Quite messy too... but again, worry not. No no, worry not, for afterwards, we don't have to clean up!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|840}} at max level)

==Progress==
Demons demons, always more demons. Like rabbits! But less cuddly... not so good for pulling out of hats either.

==Completion==
<[[Archmage Xylem]] appears to be doing some kind of dance as he turns to you.>

Do not fret, and better yet, do not forget, to do not let the bug juice set or you will regret... well, you'll regret the smell of your boots really! It won't smell good today and it won't smell good even more tomorrow!

==Notes==
You will have an elemental called a Personal Arcane Assistant accompany you for this quest. Its two abilities are "Polymorph Cockroach" and a teleport spell that takes you back to Xylem's camp.

Note that [[hunter]]s must have their pet put away for this quest according to reports, and Bartender users need to have the pet bar enabled. 

Once the demons have been transformed into giant cockroaches, simply hit them and you will get credit. Do this quest while making your way toward the objective for [[Manual Labor]].
