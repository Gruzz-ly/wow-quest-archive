== Objectives ==
Locate {{NPC||Subject Nine}} somewhere near the [[Secret Lab]] complex in [[Azshara]].

== Description ==
I don't know if you've noticed, <name>, but this whole lab complex has gone south of cheese! I don't mind writing off all {{NPC||Static-Charged Hippogryph||these hippogryphs}}, but my most prized experiment has gone missing: Subject Nine!

Subject Nine is a [[raptor]] we imported from the [[Barrens]]. I wonder - is she still alive? Try checking above the main complex west of here, near the giant top secret rocket. You can't miss it.

== Completion ==
Have you come to assist me with my work? My claws are quite dexterous, but I must reluctantly confess that my arms are debilitatingly short.

== Notes ==
Above the lab to the west, {{NPC||Subject Nine}} is in the teleporter next to ''{{NPC||The S.S. Placeholder}}''
