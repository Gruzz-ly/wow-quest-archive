== Objectives ==
Inspect {{NPC||Clubnik's Dozer}} and collect a sample of the Ectosplatter that's gumming up the engine.
*[[Ectosplatter Sample]]

== Description ==
Those [[Lake Mennar|ancient ruins]] have survived ten thousand years of wind and weather, so I brought out my biggest and bestest bulldozer to flatten 'em. I call her "Margene."

But my dozer's been letting me down lately, <name>. The moment I drove her into those haunted woods, her engine seized up with a spine-chilling howl. Now my engineers tell me something's clogging her valves. Go over there and inspect Margene's engine compartment, and bring me back a sample of whatever gunk has her stalled.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*675 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Margene is one heck of a machine, isn't she?

== Completion ==
Buested ball bearings! Look at [[Ectoplasm|this stuff]] - ugh, SMELL this stuff - my poor, poor dozer!

<Name>, I consider myself a goop expert and this here goop ain't natural. It's supernatural. This is ghost goop. We're going to need more than a mechanic...

== Notes ==
Interact with Clubnik's Dozer (the cast bar says "Tinkering"):
:{{text|emote|<Name> pops open the engine hatch and mucks around with the machine's innards...}}
:{{text|emote|Clubnik's Dozer shudders as piles of green sludge ooze out of the exhaust pipes!}}

An {{NPC||Ectoplasmic Exhaust}} spawns! Kill it to loot the [[Ectosplatter Sample]].
