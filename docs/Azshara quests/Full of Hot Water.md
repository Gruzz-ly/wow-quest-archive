==Objectives==
Obtain a Globe of Boiling Water from a [[Scalding Water Lord]] at the [[Tower of Eldara]].
*[[Globe of Boiling Water]]
*[[Engorged Azshari Sea Sponge]] (provided)

==Description==
Ergll indicated that you should be able to use the Engorged Azshara Sea Sponge to summon a "jumbo" elemental near the Tower of Eldara to the northeast.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Spongy Vest
|Scalding Gloves
|Ergll's Body Sieve
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're back!

==Completion==
Convenient, no? Who needs hot springs anyway. This is perfect.

==Notes==
The [[Stone of the Scalding Water Lords]] to summon the elemental can be found around {{coords|81|30|Azshara}}. You do not need to return to Ergll in order to start this quest after completing the prior one.

When you turn this in, Ergll will say:
:{{text|emote|Ergll takes a drink of his brew and jitters uncomfortably for a few moments.}}
:{{text|say|Ergll|That's the stuff! All awake now. Tasty!}}
