==Objectives==
Collect 20 [[Simmering Water Droplet]]s from the [[Vile Splash]]es east of the [[Ruins of Arkkoran]].

==Description==
One other thing I need. Hot water.

Not easy around here. Not hot springs, no friends to share. One good way though. Have this sponge... it's ultra absorbent! Use it to go soak Vile Splashes at the sandbar eastish.

With enough, go squeeze them out over near the tower to summon jumbo elemental. He has hot water.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|780}} at max level)

==Progress==
The {{item|Enchanted Azshari Sea Sponge|Azshari Sea Sponge}} undulates with living water.

==Completion==
You've collected all of the simmering water droplets that Ergll requested. Now it's just a matter of summoning the [[Scalding Water Lord|"jumbo" elemental]].

==Notes==
Do [[A Little Pick-me-up]] and [[That's Just Rude!]] before heading off to do this quest and its follow-up.

This is an extremely easy quest. Simply mount up and ride through the mini-elementals running around the islands to the east of the [[Ruins of Arkkoran]]. The [[Enchanted Azshari Sea Sponge]] provided for this quest will "soak them up" automatically as you run by and they will dissolve toward you. The follow-up quest, [[Full of Hot Water]], starts automatically without having to run back to Ergll.
