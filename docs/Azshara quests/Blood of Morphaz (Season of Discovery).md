==Objectives==
Kill [[Hazzas and Morphaz|Morphaz]] in the sunken [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|temple of Atal'Hakkar]], and return his blood to [[Greta Mosshoof]] in [[Felwood]]. The entrance to the sunken temple can be found in the [[Swamp of Sorrows]].
* [[Blood of Morphaz]]

==Description==
Now the last part, the second cure.

The [[green drake]] Morphaz is known to be immune to all forms of [[poison]] and [[disease]] -- many [[druid]]s died to bring us this information. There is no doubt his blood is potent for our needs.

A courier from the [[Cenarion Circle]] will take the parts you have already collected while you gather the last. Summon your allies and seek out the drake's lair in the sunken temple of Atal'Hakkar. Bring his blood to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|45}}
*5900 [[XP]]
*[[Blessed Prayer Beads]]
*[[Woestave]]
*[[Circle of Hope]]

==Progress==
Do you have the blood of Morphaz?

==Completion==
You have slain Morphaz and carried his blood to us...  I can hardly believe this good news!

We will combine the ingredients at once and begin healing the trees and creatures of Felwood.  It will take a lifetime to undo what has happened here, but you have given us the means to do it.
