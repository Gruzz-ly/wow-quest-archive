== Objectives ==
Use The Refleshifier to de-stonify eight Mountainfoot Miners within the [[Mountainfoot Strip Mine]].
*{{NPC||Mountainfoot Miner}} Destoned
*[[The Refleshifier]] (provided)

== Description ==
<The [[Headquarters Radio|nearby radio]] calls out to you.>

Hey, <name>, you got that gun? Good! Don't point it directly at your eye.

Aim that baby at my stonified workers and the refracted light should reverse the petrification process. Or it will melt them. Whatever. Return my workers to a state of profitability! And if the refleshification process makes them crazy-go-nuts, they should be killed for insurance purposes. {{NPC||Horzak Zignibble||Horzak}} OUT!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Stonifying Gun|Refleshified Bracers}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||8}}
*875 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Hey look, all your limbs are intact.

== Completion ==
Ah, good. Now we can get these slackers back to work. You've earned a cut of the profits though - minus the usual company fees. Take your pick!

== Notes ==
After being destoned the miners will say one the following:
*{{Text|say|Mountainfoot Miner|Give that <man/woman> a raise!}}
*{{Text|say|Mountainfoot Miner|Give that woman a raise!}}
*{{Text|say|Mountainfoot Miner|I can still clock in for the time I was petrified, right?}}
*{{Text|say|Mountainfoot Miner|I quit, I QUIT!}}
*{{Text|say|Mountainfoot Miner|I'm outta here...}}
*{{Text|say|Mountainfoot Miner|No job is worth this!}}
*{{Text|say|Mountainfoot Miner|That was surprisingly restful.}}
*{{Text|say|Mountainfoot Miner|The nightmare is over!}}
*{{Text|say|Mountainfoot Miner|I'm free!}}
