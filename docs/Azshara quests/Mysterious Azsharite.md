== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Azsharite Samples from the nearby cliffs.
*[[Azsharite Sample]] x5

== Description ==
[[Azsharite]]! This mysterious crystalline substance has [[Azsharite|been used]] to [[The Formation of Felbane|forge weapons]] of [[Enchanted Azsharite Fel Weaponry|fel power]], but in our hands, we've discovered that it's capable of focusing enormous amounts of energy. It may be the biggest [[goblin]] discovery since [[kaja'mite]].

But what is it? Where does it come from? Why is it located [[Azshara|only here]]? Science demands an answer! I need more samples to study. Search out Azsharite deposits all along the nearby cliffs.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6}}
*900 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Progress ==
Have you got more samples? Careless [[adventurer]]s have been looting this stuff for years - they don't know how precious it is!

== Completion ==
Ah, excellent. Some of these samples look fresh. I'm going to be up to my neck in this stuff trying to solve this mystery!

== Notes ==
While looting the samples, keep an eye out for the [[Crystallized Note]]s found in fossilized humanoid forms, not the crystal objects.
