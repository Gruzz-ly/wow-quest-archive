== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Talrendis Scouts.
*[[Talrendis Scout]] slain x8

== Description ==
Our enemies abound, <class>, even here at our [[Orgrimmar Rear Gate|very doorstep]]. The [[night elf|night elves]] have reinforced [[Talrendis Point]] in attempt to stop our advance into [[Ashenvale]]. As we speak, their scouts patrol the nearby hills, reporting every movement to and from these gates.

We must remove these eyes of Ashenvale.

Go! Your prey stalks all around these gates, especially to the east. Slay the scouts who shadow us!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Hill's Eye Wand
|Stolen Talrendis Boots
|Hill Ranger Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
Are the hills no longer alive, <class>?

== Completion ==
Excellent. As their scouts fail to report in, Talrendis will feel the terror they've tried in vain to inflict on us.

== Notes ==
Don't hold off killing scouts until getting to the [[Up a Tree]] portion of the shredder questline. A scout will drop the [[Scout's Orders]], which starts [[Return of the Highborne?]]

== Trivia ==
This quest is a reference to the popular horror movie, The hills have eyes.
