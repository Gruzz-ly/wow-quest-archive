{{questportrait|Smoot.jpg||Find Smoot somewhere in Bilgewater Harbor!}}
== Objectives ==
Find [[Smoot]] somewhere in [[Bilgewater Harbor]]. Tackle him and get the Induction Samophlange.
* [[Induction Samophlange]]

== Description ==
It was the Captain who insisted his new engines use an induction samophlange.

Those things hadn't even been invented yet!

I tasked Smoot with creating one based on some stolen [[Venture Company]] schematics, and he's finally built a working model.

Now that he's got his samophlange, he's drunk with power. He's running all over town with it like a goblin possessed.

Smack Smoot and snag my samophlange, <name>.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Smoot-Smacking Shoulderpads

*{{cost|9}}
*55200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Smoot's a good engineer.

A samophlange can kill from thirty yards if you misalign the reduction caliphracts.
