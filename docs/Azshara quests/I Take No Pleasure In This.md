==Objectives==
Crash [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix's]] party.
* Crash Gallywix's party (0/100%)

==Description==
I knew that Gallywix was selfish and wasteful, but this... this is too much.

His bloated pride has blacked out the sun of good leadership. He hoards the wealth of his people to satiate his gluttony, greed, and lust while his people toil under his calloused heel.

And, maybe worse, opportunistic socialites from all across the Horde revel in the depravity.

All people of [[Azeroth]] deserve better than this. We must teach these spoiled cowards a lesson.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Completion==
I won't pretend that this will solve all of the goblins' problems, but it does feel good to bring a little justice to these pompous parasites.

==Notes==
The [[Disabled Teleporter]] is behind. Continue to the palace. To fill up the bar, kill [[Palace Mook]]s (10%), [[Pleasure Palace Golfer]]s, [[Pleasure Palace VIP]]s, [[Pleasure Palace Sunbather]] (5-6%), [[Pleasure Palace Caddie]]s, [[Pleasure Palace Waitress]]es, and [[Pleasure Palace Waiter]]s (4%), and interact with [[Party Plunger]]s and [[Pleasure Palace Barbecue]]s (5-6%).
