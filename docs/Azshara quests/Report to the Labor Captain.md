You will receive:
*90 [[XP]]

<Name>? The <Name>?

<The labor captain eyes you up and down.>

The rumors are already flying about you. I don't know if I should be thankful or frightened that you're here. At least we don't have any volcanoes in Azshara!

Honestly, I can't believe you're showing your face here... {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix}} has set up shop atop the mountain!
