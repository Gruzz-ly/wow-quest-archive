==Objectives==
Complete the [[Trial of Shadow]] by luring 20 [[Weeping Soul]]s into the shadow runes without getting touched.
*Shadow Trial Completed

==Description==
Let us not be confined by the bounds of the mage repertoire of magic. I, for one, choose not to be classist. Necromancy can just be so much fun!

Touch the Shadow Crystal to open a portal to my Trial of Shadow. Once there, move to the Altar when you are ready to begin.

Weeping Souls shall begin to pursue you... your goal is simply to drag them into the traps. And be sure not to let them touch you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|840}} at max level)

==Progress==
You're not very good at this. You're supposed to complete the trial BEFORE you come talk to me again. Make sense?

==Completion==
I like the way you move, apprentice.

Don't you worry about where I got all the souls from. They were obtained in a perfectly humane manner, I assure you.

==Notes==
You can get the achievement [[Glutton for Shadowy Punishment]] while doing this quest.
