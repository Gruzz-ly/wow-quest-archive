== Objectives ==
Fight your way across Talrendis Point, slaying 12 Talrendis Defenders and 6 Talrendis Sentinels.
*[[Talrendis Defender]] slain x12
*[[Talrendis Sentinel]] slain x6

== Description ==
Our grunts are strong but have no initiative. They're fighting toe-to-toe on the front lines. But an independent <class> like yourself - well, someone like you can slip behind the lines and cause some real havoc deep within the enemy redoubt.

Cut a swath of destruction through the heart of Talrendis, <name>! Slay our foes in territory they think is secure, leaving blood and fear in your wake.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||12}}

==Progress==
I trust you've left our foes in complete disarray?

== Completion ==
Lok'tar ogar, <name>! As they discover the bodies of their comrades they will learn that no place is safe from the fury of the horde, and their will to fight will crumble.
