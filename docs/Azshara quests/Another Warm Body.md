== Objectives ==
Report to [[Commander Molotov]] on [[Forlorn Ridge]].

== Description ==
Oh have I got a deal for you! Immerse yourself in foreign cultures, go on epic adventures, blow things up, and get paid to do it! Sound too good to be true? Well it's not - this is what we do!

If you're interested, head over to [[Gallywix Defense Post]] on Forlorn Ridge to the north and look for Commander Molotov.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 460 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
Latest recruit, eh?

I'll make this short and sweet. We're under contract to keep the [[naga]] in the [[Ruins of Eldarath|ruins]] from reaching {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix||Gallywix}} or [[Gallywix Pleasure Palace|his property]]. You handle whatever we ask of you, and I'll see to it that you get paid when all of your rounds are complete.

Welcome to the [[Bilgewater Battalion]].

== Notes ==
Faster to simply run there than to take the rocketway and backtrack south. Head due north, above the ruins to the due east of [[Gallywix Pleasure Palace]].
