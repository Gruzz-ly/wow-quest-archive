== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Recovered Artifacts from the ruins around [[Lake Mennar]] in [[Azshara]].
*[[Recovered Artifacts]] x5

== Description ==
The ruins around Lake Mennar, to our east, have a story to tell. The lesser races - like those clumsy [[dwarf|dwarves]] - would go after the truth with picks and shovels. <Malynea wrinkles her nose.> We'll be using more elegant methods.

My scrying magic is somewhat rusty, but with the right trinket I should be able to peer through the shrouds of time. The bones of my forefathers have long since rotted away but some of their personal treasures may remain - bring me some.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||5}}

== Progress ==
Have you gotten your hands dirty for me?

== Completion ==
<Malynea furrows her brow and begins sifting through the artifacts you brought her.>

So the spirits of the dead still haunt those old stones, hm? Well, <name>, as it happens, I'm counting on their help. Let's see what the dead have to say.

== Notes ==
Plenty of broken pottery circling the lake while on [[Survey the Lakeshore]].
