== Objectives ==
Arm the three [[Azshara Detonator|Explosive Charge]]s located around the base of the southern-most tower at [[Talrendis Point]].
*[[Detonator Charge 1]] Armed
*[[Detonator Charge 2]] Armed
*[[Detonator Charge 3]] Armed

== Description ==
This tower was out of cannon range, so I thought we'd blow it up the old-fashioned way - in person. We set all the main charges but the guards fought us back before we could arm the detonators.

<Name>! Get up there and arm the three detonators we placed around the base of the tower. Those things are wired into a pack of thermals I set up along the spine... It'll be some show!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Did you get 'em? Did you get all three?

== Completion ==
Sweet. Let's torch this banana stand!
