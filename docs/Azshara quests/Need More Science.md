== Objectives ==
Locate {{NPC||Assistant Greely}} at the [[Southern Rocketway Terminus]]. The [[Goblin Rocketway]] can be used to move quickly around [[Azshara]].

== Description ==
<Clubnik wipes away a tear, then juts his chin out with determination.>

Never again, <name>! No bulldozer deserves the fate of my Margene. We're going to need some industrial ghostproofing. This is a job for our top scientists, and I know just the woman for the job. Look for Assistant Greely at the Southern Rocketway Terminus. She's the administrator for Azshara's world-famous [[Secret Lab]], and she owes me a favor.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
*675 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
What is Clubnik talking about? Haunted construction equipment? Does it look like I have time for ghost stories?

I've got a laboratory in the middle of a meltdown, fires burning, animals mutated, and worst of all - projects falling behind schedule. Help!

== Notes ==
Hop on the rocketway elevator and take the ride to the [[Southern Rocketway Terminus]]. Greely is standing at the base, near Grapplehammer.
