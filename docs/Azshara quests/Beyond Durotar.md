==Objectives==
Report to Ag'tor Bloodfist at the [[Orgrimmar Rear Gate]] in [[Azshara]].

==Description==
Hmmph... it looks like your services are being requested elsewhere. Ag'tor Bloodfist is looking for recruits to assist the Horde's ventures in [[Azshara]], north of Orgrimmar.

I'm sure you still have work to do here in Durotar, and I understand that they'll shortly be asking for your help in the [[Northern Barrens|Barrens]]. I wouldn't be going anywhere yet if I were you, but if you're itching for some manifest destiny... Azshara awaits. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}} (or {{cost|||60}} at level 85)
==Completion==
Good, you're here.  Welcome to Azshara, the stage for the next act of the Horde's glorious future.  Now get to work.
