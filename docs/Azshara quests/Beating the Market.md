== Objectives ==
Track down a [[Bilgewater Foreman]] somewhere in [[Bilgewater Harbor]] and knock him around a little.
* Bilgewater Foreman Intimidated

== Description ==
<It's not hard to see why the [[Foebreaker]] is behind schedule. Every other day, a foreman comes in and changes the blueprints.>

<Most troubling are the recent alterations. The workers have been ordered to remove rivets to save on costs!>

<You'd better track down one of the Bilgewater foremen responsible for this and make an example out of him, before any Horde lives are lost in a faulty ship.>

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}}

==Progress==
Word on the street has it there's been a shakeup at the dockyards. Is that your handiwork or are you still investigating?

== Completion ==
So they were trying to skimp on production costs? Unacceptable!

I'm glad you knocked some sense into them. If that foreman makes good on his word, our fleet will be ship-shape in time for the invasion.

==Notes==
;Speaking with the Foreman
:What's the deal, <class>?

:Word on the docks is that you've been poking around my construction sites...

:{{Gossip|Nobody shorts Garrosh Hellscream. You finish those ships - and finish them right - or this gets personal.}}
:{{Text|say|Bilgewater Foreman|Nobody tells me how to run my business here.}}
:{{Text|say|Bilgewater Foreman|It was just a couple of rivets. That ship had plenty!}}
:{{Text|say|Bilgewater Foreman|I'm sure it would've been seaworthy in calm waters.}}
:{{Text|say|Bilgewater Foreman|Less rivets mean a cleaner environment!}}
:{{Text|say|Bilgewater Foreman|...can we settle this with cash?}}
:{{Text|say|Bilgewater Foreman|Okay okay, stop! Stop! You make a compelling argument.}}
:{{Text|say|Bilgewater Foreman|I'll double the worker shifts and put in my own money to get those ships seaworthy and back on schedule. Count on it!}}
