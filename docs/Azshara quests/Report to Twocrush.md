== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Torg Twocrush}} at the [[Southern Rocketway Terminus]] in [[Azshara]] with news of your discovery.

A magical barrier pulses around you, chilling your bones. You feel secure behind this enchanted wall.

Torg Twocrush will want to know what you've discovered here!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Completion ==
An energy barrier, you say? This explains a great deal! I've seen firsthand how naga leaders have been able to turn aside the blades of some of my best warriors.

Now we know the source of their power, <name>. Let's finish this!
