== Objectives ==
Use the {{NPC||Reprogrammed Shredder}} to collect 6 [[Azshara Lumber Pile|piles of Azshara Lumber]]. If you lose your shredder, another can {{NPC||Runaway Shredder||be attacked}} and reprogrammed.
*Azshara Lumber x6

== Description ==
Now that you've got that thing under control, let's gather up the lumber I was supposed to be collecting. Otherwise these [[orc]]s are going to build a [[catapult]] out of ME!

Fresh lumber should be stockpiled all around [[Orgrimmar Rear Gate|the area]]. Use the [[goblin shredder|shredder]] to collect all you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
How's the wood processing going? You should see what that thing does to broccoli!

== Completion ==
Great! You've loaded the shredder to capacity. You're getting pretty handy with that thing...

== Notes ==
The shredder only has one ability:
#{{abilities|Gather Lumber|range=5|Gather up a nearby pile of Azshara Lumber.|notes=1 sec cast}}
