== Objectives ==
Gather a Blackmaw Meeting Agenda at Blackmaw Hold, and kill a [[Talrendis Ambassador]] to collect her Ambassador's Robes.
*[[Blackmaw Meeting Agenda]]
*[[Ambassador's Robes]]

== Description ==
In order to infiltrate and disrupt the Blackmaw negotiations, we'll need to know where they're happening. In Blackmaw Hold to the southwest, I suspect you'll find night elven ambassadors milling around, making preparations.

<Haggrum spits on the ground.>

Kill them at your leisure, and search the area for important documents. Oh, and grab a set of their ambassador's robes, we'll need them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*950 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
Do you have the robes? [[Andorel Sunsworn|Andorel]] here has been whipping up some magic for us to use. 

== Completion ==
Excellent work! Let me see those documents. Hmm. Now we know exactly when and where the final negotiations will happen. Don't worry if those robes don't fit you - I've got it all worked out.
