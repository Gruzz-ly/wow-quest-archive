# Azshara storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Aszhara.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]
'''[[Azshara]]''' is a level 12-20 zone accessed after [[Durotar]] or the [[goblin starting experience]]. The zone is a relatively directed-questing experience, starting at the [[Orgrimmar Rear Gate]] and heading counterclockwise around the zone.

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Azshara Quests]].

==Orgrimmar Rear Gate==
Players start their Azshara questing at the Orgrimmar Rear Gate where they discover that [[Night Elf]] warriors from nearby [[Ashenvale]] are sneaking around Azshara and disrupting the activities of the [[Goblin]]s and [[Orc]]s in the area. Both [[Labor Captain Grabbit]] and [[Ag'tor Bloodfist]] have players push back against the Night Elven offensive around the gate as the Horde tries to harvest the forest for lumber. In [[Defend the Gates!]] the Night Elves launch a full-out attack against the gate and are thwarted by players with Goblin [[Shredder]]s.

After [[Arborcide]], to the Rocketway Exchange in [[Report to Horzak]].

==Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange==
At the [[Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange]], players continue their work collecting resources for the Horde as they are sent into the [[Mountainfoot Strip Mine]] by [[Horzak Zignibble]] to deal with [[Basilisk]]s released into the mine by the Night Elves. After clearing out the basilisks, players are faced with another threat as they are recruited into the Bilgewater Battalion under [[Commander Molotov]] in the quest [[Another Warm Body]]. Molotov is defending against [[Naga]] incursions from the sea and together with players the Naga are repelled. There is one final quest chain starting with [[Survey the Lakeshore]] which has players visiting Lake Mennar and finding out about its history as Custer Clubnick and Malynea Skyreaver fight over what to do with it - Clubnick wants to pave it over while Malynea wants to study it. This quest line culminates in Custer's bulldozer becoming haunted in [[Dozercism]] and players being sent to the Southern Rocketway Terminus for help.
{{:Azshara quests/Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange}}
After [[Dozercism]], to the Southern Rocketway Terminus in [[Need More Science]].

==Southern Rocketway Terminus==
[[Assistant Greely]], who Goblin players met in the [[Lost Isles]], is having a minor crisis at the [[Southern Rocketway Terminus]] and cannot spare any time for Custer's dozer. The [[Secret Lab]] where she and [[Hobart Grapplehammer]] were working has had an accident and fires are breaking out everywhere. She sends players to the lab to fix some of the problems before getting them to bring back the extremely valuable Azsharite core. Once players return, Greely explains that Azsharite is a very valuable substance that comes in limited quantities. It is later revealed by the Stone Giant [[Gormungan]] that Azsharite is in fact Giant droppings and Greely attempts several methods of "acquiring" these droppings. Finally in [[A Hello to Arms]], Greely sends the player into [[Bilgewater Harbor]] with the Azsharite core for further study. Also at the Southern Rocketway Terminus is a quest chain starting with [[Mortar the Point]] where players help [[Torg Twocrush]] route the Naga attacking the area.
{{:Azshara quests/Southern Rocketway Terminus}}
After [[Azsharite Experiment Number Two]], to the Bilgewater Harbor in [[A Hello to Arms]].

==Bilgewater Harbor==
At this point, the questing experience branches:
*[[Teemo]] starts [[Azshara Blues]], which leads to the [[#Azuregos_quest_chain|Azuregos quest chain]].
*The [[Wrenchmen Recruitment Poster]] starts [[Operation Fishgut]], which leads to [[#The_Shattered_Strand|The Shattered Strand]].

==Azuregos quest chain==
The Azuregos quest chain is a long chain started by the Blue [[Dragon Aspect]] [[Kalecgos]] who is searching for another Blue Dragon [[Azuregos]] in the area. He sends players out to search for him which leads to the [[Murloc]] [[Ergll]], then to the Northern Rocketway Exchange and then further. Eventually players are mixed up with the apprentices of [[Archmage Xylem]], becoming apprentices themselves and passing the three trials before finding Azuregos in Archmage Xylem's tower in [[Wasn't It Obvious?]]. After this, Azuregos, Kalecgos and players work together to take down some [[Black Dragon]]s led by [[Malicion]] before the quest chain ends.

===Northern Rocketway Exchange===
After arriving to the [[Northern Rocketway Exchange]] via [[Wash Out]], two side chains are available. The first is started by [[Andorel Sunsworn]] and it features players clearing out a nearby Night Elven encampment. The second is started by [[Haggrum Bloodfist]], who has players sabotage negotiations between the Alliance and the [[Blackmaw tribe|Blackmaw furbolgs]].

==The Shattered Strand==
The Shattered Strand quest chain has players returning to the Shattered Strand where they first battled the Naga to resume the fight with vigor. Players battle the Naga before uniting with the [[Gob Squad]] for an assault on the Naga base in the [[Ruins of Eldarath]]. After dealing some damage, players are sent back in to steal the [[Heart of Arkkoroc]], an item which the Naga are using to brainwash the local sea giants.
{{:Azshara quests/The Shattered Strand}}

==Valormok==
After reaching level 20, players are flown to [[Valormok]] where the Horde is preparing a final assault against the Night Elven forces in Azshara. Players slay the Night Elven defenders, assassinate the commander in charge of the Alliance forces and then bomb the command center, destroying the Night Elven foothold in the region. With the conquest of Azshara complete and the Horde victorious, players are sent to continue the offensive on the front lines in [[Ashenvale]].
