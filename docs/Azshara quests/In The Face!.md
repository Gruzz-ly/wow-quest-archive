==Objectives==
Use an SFG to kill an Enslaved Son of Arkkoroc in the southern minefield.
*[[Enslaved Son of Arkkoroc]] slain
*[[SFG]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[naga]] are using those giants to stamp paths through our minefields. Time to put that SFG to use!

Head over to the entrance to the southern minefield - I think you can figure out the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*900 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Sweet little piece of [[goblin technology]], that thing is.

==Completion==
BAM! In the face! Nice shot, kid.

==Notes==
Head south and wait until one of the giants reaches the top of the path. Then pull the trigger. The SFG is one-time use, however.
