==Objectives==
Wear the Ambassador Disguise and talk to {{npc|horde|Andorel Sunsworn}} to teleport into Blackmaw Hold. Speak with [[Ungarl]] to wreck the negotiations, then kill 4 Blackmaw Warriors and 4 Blackmaw Shaman on your way out.
*[[Ungarl#Quotes|Negotiations Sabotaged]]
*[[Blackmaw Warrior]] slain (4)
*[[Blackmaw Shaman]] slain (4)
*[[Ambassador Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
Andorel here has crafted a little bit of magic for me. Come, stand next to my fire, and steep yourself in the fumes from the tea. Drape the robes around you and you'll take on the appearance of a night elven ambassador to the Blackmaw.

Don your disguise and speak to Andorel here in camp. He'll teleport you to the heart of Blackmaw hold, where the negotiations are to take place. Speak with Chieftain Ungarl and sabotage the treaty. Then, kill as many Blackmaw as you can on the way back!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Treaty Breaker Gloves
|Diplomatic Belt
|Negotiation Stompers
|Accomodating Cinch
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
If our ruse pays off, <name>, we will forever drive a wedge between the Alliance and the Blackmaw.

==Completion==
Victory! The Blackmaw won't know who to trust anymore.

With that delicate bit of business complete, I can orchestrate a full-on assault against those beasts without worrying about them siding with the Alliance.

You do good work, <name>. Perhaps we should place you in the Horde diplomatic corps? Hah-har!

==Notes==
Don the disguise near [[Haggrum's Smokepit]]:
:{{Text|say|Haggrum Bloodfist|Har! You look uglier than usual, <name>!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Andorel Sunsworn]]|That's a primitive disguise spell, orc, but it should suffice.}}
