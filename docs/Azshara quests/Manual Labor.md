==Objectives==
Retrieve the [[Abjurer's Manual]] from the [[Lagash Encampment]].

==Description==
The local demons seem to get quite a kick out of stealing all of our arcane manuals. I highly doubt most of them can even read, so they're probably doing it just to spite us.

I could care less about most of the books they've taken, but they took an Abjurer's Manual that I'm going to need if there's any hope of keeping apprentices like you alive amidst Xylem's "trials." Find the demons at the Lagash Encampment to the southeast and retrieve the Abjurer's Manual.

That's all. Scoot.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|840}} at max level)

==Progress==
And here you are... back... talking to me again. I assume this means that you have my book?

==Completion==
Peachy. Back to work then.

Thanks, snookums.

==Notes==
There are many items named "Stolen Manual" in the area, but only one will contain the real Abjurer's Manual. It is located at {{coords|55.25|25.21|Azshara}} and requires running around the other side from where you approach the camp.
