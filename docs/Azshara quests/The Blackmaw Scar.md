==Objectives==
Slay 8 Talrendis Biologists and gather up Blackmaw Intelligence from one of the bodies.
*[[Talrendis Biologist]] slain (8)
*[[Blackmaw Intelligence]] (1)

==Description==
The [[Blackmaw tribe|Blackmaw furbolg]] that live in this area have broken rank with their [[Timbermaw tribe|Timbermaw]] brethren as we began to aggressively settle [[Azshara]]. They've gone wild, <class>, and harass our forces at every turn. Worse, we have seen them engaging the [[night elf|night elves]] from [[Talrendis Point|Talrendis]] on friendly terms. We cannot allow the two to ally!

Just southwest of here you will find a great scar across the earth where my scouts report night elven activity. Slay them and gather any intelligence you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Orgrimmar}}

==Progress==
The Blackmaw are ferocious. Were they ever to organize, they would prove to be an immense disruption to our work here.

==Completion==
I see... This definitely looks like a working draft of some sort of treaty. That's a worst-case scenario for us, <name>: Night elves coordinating attacks with entrenched furbolg allies.

My initial instinct - a full-out frontal assault - would only drive them into the arms of the Alliance. We will have to take a different approach...
