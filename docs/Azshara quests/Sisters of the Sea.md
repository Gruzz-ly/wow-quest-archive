==Objectives==
Kill Lady Silisthra and Lady Vesthra by disabling their power stones.
*{{Mob|Lady Silisthra|icon=Naga Female}} slain
*{{Mob|Lady Vesthra|icon=Naga Female}} slain

==Description==
Two naga witches have been masterminding the assault on [[Southern Rocketway Terminus|this outpost]]. They've repelled direct attacks from some of my best grunts, but you can finish the job where others have failed.

Seek out and slay Lady Silisthra and Lady Vesthra at the eastern edge of the cliffs, around the ruins of the ancient [[night elf|night elven]] colossus. You will first need to destroy the powerstones that give them their strength. Do not disappoint me, <class>!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sea Sister Vest
|Serpent-Crusher Gloves
|Scaled Gloves of the Serpent
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Is the job finished?

==Completion==
Now THAT is how we used to handle serpents back in [[Durotar]] - we crushed them under our boots! You have done the [[Horde]] proud, <name>. As soon as my reinforcements arrive we'll mop up the rest of those vermin and claim this peninsula once and for all.

==Notes==
[[Vesthra's Power Stone]] can be found at {{co|63.6|79.4|Azshara}} and [[Silisthra's Power Stone]] at {{co|63.2|75.8|Azshara}}.
