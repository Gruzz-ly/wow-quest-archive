== Objectives ==
Look for [[Fleep]] at her junkyard within [[Bilgewater Harbor]] in [[Azshara]].

== Description ==
I gave [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]  my personal guarantee that I'd have his airfleet ready this week, but our flagship - The [[Spear of Durotar]] - still doesn't have its primary engines installed.

Fleep promised me a dangerously shiny new engine last week. Go to her junkyard behind the bank and find out what the holdup is.

The airfleet is waiting on us, <name>!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*5520 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
<Fleep wipes her face, plastering an enormous grease smear across her cheek.>

What? The Captain said WHAT?

<She shakes her pipe wrench threateningly.>

It's HIS fault this big beast of an engine is delayed.

==Progression==
{{To Twilight Highlands}}

== Patch changes ==
