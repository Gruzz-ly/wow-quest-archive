==Objectives==
Kill Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion in [[Sable Ridge]]. 
*[[Twilight Lord Katrana]] slain
*[[Malicion]] slain

==Description==
Now we put an end to all this madness. We need to route the [[black dragonflight]] from Azshara entirely before they can return with any communication for their master.

I still don't know what they have up their sleeve for capturing us, so I'd like to ask this one last thing of you - go into sable ridge and kill their leaders, Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion.

If things get hairy, I will come help. I just don't want to risk falling into whatever trap they set for Azuregos.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Blue Hide Vest
|Kalecgos' Gift
|Azure Scale Hauberk
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will be glad to be done with these wretches.

==Completion==
You truly amaze me, mortal. It's rare to meet someone so dedicated and resourceful.

Azuregos and I are likely to depart Azshara and remain discrete for a while. I do hope that we meet again someday though. Perhaps to put an end to Deathwing himself.

Farewell, <name>. Stay safe.

==Notes==
Simply engage Katrana and give Malicion a few moments to fly over the altar. When you kill Katrana, a scripted scene will start, in which Malicion will capture you and get killed by Kalecgos.
