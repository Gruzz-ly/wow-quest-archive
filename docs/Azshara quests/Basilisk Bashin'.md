==Objectives==
Kill 10 Greystone Basilisks in the [[Mountainfoot Strip Mine]].
*[[Greystone Basilisk]] slain (10)

==Description==
We moved this whole mountain to strip mine the minerals below. But what we didn't take into consideration were the subterranean [[basilisk]]s that are now, uh, terranean. You look like you've got some iniative - go in there and kill some of those nuisances and I'll dip into our petty cash fund for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8}}
*875 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Are those beasts good and dead?

==Completion==
Good, good. One less nuisance to worry about.
