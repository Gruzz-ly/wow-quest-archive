==Objectives==
Put on your new wizard hat and then speak to the {{npc||Image of Archmage Xylem}} just northeast of the [[Northern Rocketway Exchange]].
*Approach Archmage Xylem while wearing your Wizard Hat
*[[Dingy Wizard Hat]] (provided)

==Description==
Every man's got to learn his own lessons I suppose.

Here, take my wizard hat. I have no doubt that he'll take you on as an apprentice if you look the role... you just might have to jump through some hoops first. Tiny flaming hoops, suspended over spikes, with spinning blades on the other side.

You should be able to find an image of Xylem on top of that hill to the northeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|700}} (or {{coppercost|600}} at max level)

==Progress==
Hello.

==Completion==
Well look at you, aren't you just a marvel of modern Magery! Quite a fancy hat, I must say.

Apprentices. Apprentici? I do think that I might have quite a few already, but I suppose one can never have too many appren..tici.

==Notes==
The entrance to the Ruins of Nordressa is on the eastern side of the encampment, meaning you will have to go around. It is around {{coords|48.5|19.8|Azshara}} and is marked by a pair of torches.

The item provided for this quest gives the player a buff that does not have any actual meaning but says you are fooling Xylem by wearing it. After completing the quests in the chain, you will eventually get [[Faded Wizard Hat]], a permanent version of the hat, although as of [[patch 4.0.3a]] the original quest item did not disappear at any point.
