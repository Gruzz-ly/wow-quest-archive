== Objectives ==
Recover the Heart of Arkkoroc from the center of the [[Ruins of Eldarath]].
*[[Heart of Arkkoroc]]
*[[Gob Squad Flare]] (provided)

== Description ==
[[Commander Molotov]] found a party at the [[Secret Lab]] willing to act as buyer for the artifact that you scouted out earlier.

Undoubtedly, it's still in the center of the ruins with the High Priestess, where you initially spotted it. Get it back here undamaged, soldier.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,250 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
I love it when people leave priceless artifacts just lying around.

== Completion ==
Hahah! It's HUGE!

We'll have you take it back to [[Uncle Bedlam]] as soon as everything's cleaned up here and you're ready to go.
