==Objectives==
Claim your reward from [[Hydraxis' Coffer]]. 

==Description==
<Name>, your services to the [[Hydraxian Waterlords|Warlords]] surpassed all we could expect from the denizens of this world.

We do not understand your people's notions of gratitude, or rewarding good works, but in this case... perhaps a reward is warranted.

Under the surf at the southern base of this island, you will find a coffer. In it you will find your... reward.

Go, <name>. Claim your reward.

==Completion==
Hydraxis' voice descends from the waters' surface...

"Choose that which best suits you, <name>.  May it protect you against the foes of the Waterlords."

The coffer is located underwater on the south side of the island.

This is the only quest to award reputation with the [[Hydraxian Waterlords]].
