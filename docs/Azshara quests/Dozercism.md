==Objectives==
Use the Blessed Flare Gun near Clubnik's Dozer to summon help, then '[[Exorcism|Exorcise]]' the bulldozer.
*[[Clubnik's Dozer]] Exorcised
*[[Blessed Flaregun]] (provided)

==Description==
...what we need is a priest!

Fortunately I have a small budget set aside for the blessing of machinery. Take this flare gun and head over to Margene, my poor sweet busted bulldozer. Fire off the signal and one of our finest airborne priests should airdrop in to get a handle on the situation. Come back when my bulldozer is taken care of!

==Progress==
How is Margene doin'? Running like her sweet self again?

==Completion==
What? ...What?

Margene! Oh my sweet Margene!!

==Notes==
Upon using the Blessed Flaregun, an [[Airborne Goblin Priest]] parachutes in in a beam of light.

:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|Praise to the Light, <brother/sister> <name>! Let's take a look here...}}
:''He walks up to the bulldozer.''
:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|Well, there's your problem! You have what we call a ghost in the machine.}}
:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|This calls for an old-fashioned bulldozer exorcism! Give me a hand if she gets uppity, will ya?}}
:''The priest hops on the bulldozer and starts the "exorcism", which consists of banging it with a pickaxe.''
:{{text|emote|Clubnik's Dozer becomes enraged!}}

The bulldozer starts erratically jumping around the area and becomes hostile, occasionally shooting fire in a cone in front of it.
:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|Whoa! We got a live one here!}}
:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|I cast you out! Unclean spirit - Begone!}}
:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|The power tools compel you! The power tools compel you!}}
:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|I cleanse thee with holy fire!}}
:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|I uh - I could use a little help here?}}

Kill the bulldozer:
:''The priest jumps down on the ground.''
:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|Terrific! That went down nice and clean.}}
:{{Text|say|Airborne Goblin Priest|Let Clubnik know that the priesthood will be sending him a bill. For the Light!}}
:''The priest despawns.''

(If the player takes too long to start helping, the priest will die but the dozer will remain hostile and killable.)
