== Objectives ==
Deliver the Armed Azsharite Core to {{NPC||Bleenik Fizzlefuse}} at [[Bilgewater Harbor]]. Speak with {{NPC||Friz Groundspin}} for a free airlift.
*[[Armed Azsharite Core]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Name>, I've taken the purified sample of [[Azsharite]] you rescued from [[Secret Lab|the lab]] and I've weaponized it. If my calculations are correct, it will detonate with enough force to level a city.

If I'm wrong, we may cleave the planet in two.

The only way to find out is a test-firing! Deliver the Azsharite core to [[Gallywix's Pride|the giant cannon]] in Bilgewater and report to Bleenik Fizzlefuse. My pilot-for-hire Friz Groundspin here can give you a ride.

I'll follow... from a safe distance.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5}}
*800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
What's that you have there - did {{NPC||Hobart Grapplehammer||Grapplehammer}} send you?

== Completion ==
Oh! This is it! It's the big one!

<Fizzlefuse calls out to his workers.>

We're in business boys!

== Notes ==
Talk to Friz:
:{{NPC||Hobart Grapplehammer||Grapplehammer}} wants me to do WHAT? He's finally finished his bomb and he wants ME to fly it across the harbor? No-sir-ee!
:Here, I'll set one of my 'copters on autopilot for you. Good luck!

:I'll be in my shelter.

:{{gossip|Just give me the 'copter, Friz.}}

The gyrocopter takes a scenic tour of Bilgewater Harbor including the really big gun pointing out to sea before haphazardly setting down on the west side of the island, just behind the inn.
