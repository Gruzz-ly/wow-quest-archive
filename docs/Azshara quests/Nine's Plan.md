==Objectives==
Acquire the Secret Rocket Plans from the Laboratory Archives building at the eastern end of the [[Secret Lab]]. You may have to kill the [[Mutant Goblin|lab director]].
*Ring [[Door Buzzer]]
*[[Secret Rocket Plans]]

== Description ==
My benefactors used their diminuitive intellect to construct an interplanetary transport. As designed, this so-called "Rocket" is a death trap. But I suspect a simple re-engineering of the fuel catalyst semifold would render a stable mixture, providing a breathable oxygen byproduct. To implement such changes, I require the original engineering plans.

Presuming they have not yet burned to the ground, locate the Laboratory Archives and attempt entry. The plans may be held by the lab director himself.

== Progress ==
I suspect the archives are close, <name>. Locate those plans!

== Completion ==
<The raptor snatches the paperwork in her prehensile claws and holds the schematics up to her face, clucking her pointed teeth dismissively.>

These are like the scrawling of children. Common sense precludes the routing of control hydraulics so near to the secondary stage burners! Still, this is salvageable.

Do you know how to refactor fuel matrixes for pressure variations at a fixed temperature? No? Very well, perhaps you can do something else for me while I reconfigure the rocket...

== Notes ==
Head back across to the east side of the lab. The archives building has a locked door with a [[Buzzer]] in front of it at {{co|45.9|76.1|Azshara}}
:<A hand-lettered sign reads:>
:Secret Lab Archives<br/>X. Nizzlebex, Lab Director:Please ring buzzer for service.
{{gossip|''<Ring the Buzzer>''}}

A {{NPC||Mutant Goblin}} with two {{NPC||Mutant Tentacle}}s attached comes out the door and attacks!

Echoing the {{NPC||Kologarn}} encounter, the tentacles are separate mobs that need to be killed as well as the mutant goblin itself. If the tentacles are still alive when the goblin dies:
:{{text|emote|The mutant goblin's tentacles berak free and slither across the ground!}}

The goblin, formerly X. Nizzlebex, drops the [[Secret Lab ID Card]] and the [[Secret Rocket Plans]].
