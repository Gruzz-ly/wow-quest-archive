==Objectives==
Bring [[Ticker]] into the ruins and cover him as he sets up bombs at 3 of the Spitelash Runestones.
*[[Spitelash Runestone]]s destroyed (3)
*[[Gob Squad Flare]] (provided)

==Description==
Our best demo-man, Ticker, is on assignment with the [[Gob Squad]]. He's got WAY more than enough explosives for all the runestones in the ruins.

All you have to do is get him there and keep him covered - he'll handle the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,250 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Ticker's a man after my own heart. Couldn't be prouder.

==Completion==
The hope is that that cuts off a major source of their magic. The truth is, we don't really have a clue. Who can pass up an opportunity to blow some stuff up though.

==Notes==
You can summon and dismiss the Gob Squad whenver you need them using the [[Gob Squad Flare]].

Locate a Spitelash Runestone. Use  the [[Gob Squad Flare]] to summon the Gob Squad. They parachute down, help you battle any naga nearby. Once the naga are defeated, Ticker will set the bomb to destroy the runestone.

If you talk to Patch:

First one dismisses the Gob Squad. The second doesn't do anything.
