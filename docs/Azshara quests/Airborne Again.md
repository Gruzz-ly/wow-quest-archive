==Objectives==
Secure a ride to [[Valormok]] with the [[Airborne Priest]]s in the eastern portion of [[Bilgewater Harbor]].

==Description==
We just got word from Valormok that we can't send anymore [[Wyvern|windriders]] that way unless we want them shot down by [[Talrendis Point|Talrendis]] snipers. We can't give up Valormok if we want a secure route to [[Ashenvale]], so we're going in another way.

The airborne priests have graciously offered to drop some people in for us from above sniper range. Head up to the military area and secure a ride on one of their planes. They'll get you there in one piece, and hopefully once you're there, you can resecure our windrider lines.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6}}
*780 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Completion==
It's past time that these night elf scum be purged from [[Azshara]]. Glad to have an able body like you to sink the point home.

Ready to get to work?

==Notes==
*Go up to the fortress at the top of the island. On the eastern side of the fortress, you'll find parked planes and some that are middle of the path. Climb in one of the ones that are in the middle of the path, and the goblin priest pilot will fly you to Valormok where you will parachute down automatically.
*The quest text originally contained a typo where Valormok was spelled as Valermok.
