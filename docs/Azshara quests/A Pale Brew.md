==Objectives==
Gather up 10 samples of [[Briaroot Brew]] from outside [[Blackmaw Hold]].
*[[Briaroot Brew]] (10)

==Description==
It looks like our [[Alliance]] foes have been making headway with their [[Blackmaw tribe|Blackmaw]] talks by conducting negotiations in the [[furbolg]] tongue. If we're to sabotage the treaty, we're going to have to do the same.

It's not as hard as it sounds, <name>. The Blackmaw make a potent herbal tea, the fumes of which will place one in a trance-like state where you'll start speaking in tongues. The Blackmaw tongue, specifically. Go to Blackmaw Hold southwest of here and get me some samples of that briaroot brew!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt? I sampled that briaroot stuff myself once, but it was too bitter, even for an old gravel-eater like myself.

==Completion==
Ah good, that's plenty. We'll boil this stuff up and you can bask in the fumes for a while - you'll be speaking like a furbolg in no time. Our plan is beginning to take shape...
