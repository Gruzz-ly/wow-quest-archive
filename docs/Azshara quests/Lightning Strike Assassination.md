==Objectives==
Talk to [[Slinky Sharpshiv]] to ascend the tower and assassinate [[Captain Grunwald]]. Collect Captain Grunwald's head.
*[[Grunwald's Head]]

==Description==
The base of the tower is patrolled by the Captain's elite guards. So here's what we're going to do: we're going to grapple straight up to the top, slice-and-dice the VIPs, and bail out using my portable low-altitude parachute. I'll rig the tower to explode behind us. You be sure to grab Captain Grunwald's head for Chawg. Got it?

Do NOT accept this mission unless you are prepared for UNMITIGATED BADASSERY. Is that clear?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Low-Altitude Parachute
|Gloves of Unmitigated Badassery
|Grips of the Lightning Fast Assasin
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
I trust you've got good news, <name>?

==Completion==
I'm impressed by the cleverness of our new goblin allies, but I'm even more impressed by you, <name>. Look at the gaze of terror frozen onto the Captain's face! He never saw your attack coming. Imagine the fear this will cause in Northwatch when they see what happened to one of their precious officers in night elf lands.

Well done, <class>. Our assault proceeds...

==Notes==

;Grunwald killed

:{{Text|say|Slinky Sharpshiv|Okay, this place is set to blow. Let's get out of here!}}
:{{Text|say|Slinky Sharpshiv|Hop on!}}

Click on [[Sharpshiv's Parachute]]. As the duo lands, the tower explodes.
