== Objectives ==
Check in with [[Friz Groundspin]] at the [[Southern Rocketway Terminus]] in [[Azshara]].

== Description ==
I just got word from [[Orgrimmar]] that the [[Warchief]] wants us to move out. We wouldn't have been ready if it wasn't for your help!

The plan is for the air fleet to take off immediately, and for the navy to follow close behind. [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]] will be accompanying the air fleet and specifically requested that you come along with us.

No time to delay! Go to the Southern Rocketway Terminus here in Azshara, and check in with Friz Groundspin. I'll bring the zeppelin around to pick you up.

== Completion ==
Another <class> for the Highlands? Here, sign this indemnification waiver...
