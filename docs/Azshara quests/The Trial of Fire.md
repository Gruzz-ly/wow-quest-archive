==Objectives==
Complete the [[Trial of Fire]] by standing in the fire runes without getting hit by flame for 10 consecutive bursts.
*Fire Trial Completed

==Description==
The Trial of Fire... oooh... sounds intimidating, doesn't it? No? Hm. Well I kind of thought so. Firsts are first, you touch the fire crystal and the portal to the trial opens.

To beat this trial, you have to hop around in the fire runes without getting hit by the fire. If you stay unflamed long enough, you win!

There are little signs to help you - fire hopping to it's new rune, fizzles when a rune goes cold. You can figure that stuff out if you want. Or just guess! That's what most people do.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|840}} at max level)

==Progress==
Um, no. You're not done. Get back in there and get toasty!

==Completion==
Woo! Good for you! That trial really put a fire under your bottom. 

==Notes==
This quest can be completed fairly easily by following {{npc||Darwin}} the blood elf apprentice who is also trying the Trial of Fire.
