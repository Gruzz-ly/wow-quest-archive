==Objectives==
Bring the Heart of Arkkoroc to [[Uncle Bedlam]] in [[Bilgewater Harbor]].
*[[Heart of Arkkoroc]] (provided)

==Description==
We're looking pretty good here at this point. It's definitely been a pleasure working with you, soldier.

If you're ready to take the artifact back, we've got a [[Gyrocopter]] ready to take you back to [[Bilgewater Harbor]] so that you can deliver it to [[Uncle Bedlam]] personally.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bedlam Gun
|Merger Boots
|Acquisition Bracers
|Heart Wrapper
|Deal Makers Bindings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||22|60}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Ah, the man of the hour!

==Completion==
And you come with the artifact! The operation was a success then. Mergers and Acquisitions can definitely handle themselves. This thing will fetch quite a pretty penny.

And you - I heard you did some impressive work down there. You may well have cut-down expenses by 10% single-handedly. That's the kind of smarty businessman I want in my army!

Here are your wages, as promised. And a little something extra too - I hope you like it.
