== Objectives ==
Find [[Bombardier Captain Smooks]] at the southernmost night elf tower at [[Talrendis Point]].
 
== Description ==
Do you see a problem with these wind riders, <name>? They're not riding the wind! Every flight I send aloft gets peppered by night elf snipers.

Talrendis sharpshooters are holed up in the southern-most tower, against the mountains. I sent one of these little goblin scrubs to take care of the tower, but I haven't heard a word from him. Go find Bombardier Captain Smooks and beat him with the hurry stick!
