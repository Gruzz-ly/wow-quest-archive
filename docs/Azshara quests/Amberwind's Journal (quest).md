==Objectives==
Slay [[Lorekeeper Amberwind]] at the [[Darnassian Base Camp]] and retrieve her journal.
*[[Amberwind's Journal]] (0/1)

==Description==
If my sources are trustworthy, Lorekeeper Amberwind is overseeing the Alliance investigation of the ruins to the east. I have not yet probed the extent of her abilities: I'm hoping you can give me a full report by engaging her in combat and destroying her.

With a title like 'Lorekeeper,' I'm guessing Amberwind will have a journal on her that'll tell us exactly what those night elves are up to. Fetch that journal for me. No need to run back; use their own scrying stones to contact me remotely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Andorel's distorted face appears within the scrying stone.>

<Name>, have you made contact? What can you tell me?

==Completion==
Amberwind was making use of an [[Arcane Construct]]? Hah! How delightfully inexperienced. It's like watching children play with firearms.

Let's take a look at that journal, <name>. Hold it up to the scrying stone... keep it still ...
