==Objectives==
Collect 10 [[Kawphi Bean]]s from the plants in the [[Ruins of Arkkoran]].

==Description==
[[Azuregos]]... Azuregos. Azy? The dragon? We're friends, definitely! Taught me to speak. Said he liked [[Blue dragonflight|my hue]]... kinda colorist, eh?

Don't remember where he went. Mmm... maybe something to help my memory?

I plant Kawphi plants all over the beach. They like sand. Kinda weird.

Could you go collect some?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|900}} (or {{coppercost|780}} at max level)

==Progress==
So tired, it's hard to concentrate.

==Completion==
Beautiful beans! They smell absolutely delicious, don't they?

==Notes==
[[File:Kawphi Plant.jpg|thumb|Kawphi Plant]]
Do this quest along with [[That's Just Rude!]] before heading off to do [[Absorbent]] and its follow-up.

The Kawphi Plant required for this quest can be found all around the Ruins of Arkkoran, particularly along the edges of rocks and other formations. High level characters in the area are likely doing [[archaeology]] and should not bother you even though they will look like they are looting something. (Of course, they may also be doing the low-level quests to experience the Cataclysm changes.)
