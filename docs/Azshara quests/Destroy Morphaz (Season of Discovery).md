'''Destroy Morphaz''' is the [[Mage]] class-specific [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Sunken Temple]] quest. It is a long quest chain that yields a very good {{quality|rare}} item for its level.

==Objective==
Retrieve the Arcane Shard from [[Hazzas and Morphaz|Morphaz]] and return to [[Archmage Xylem]].
* [[Arcane Shard]]

==Description==
There is a [[green drake]] deep in the sunken temple of Atal'Hakkar by the name of Morphaz.

Years ago, he overwhelmed me in a bold ambush and consumed my apprentice whole. While the loss of an apprentice is not unknown to me, this particular one carried an arcane shard of unsurpassed size and quality.

You must gather powerful allies and delve into the temple. Destroy Morphaz and recover the arcane shard from his ageless stomach.

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|45}}
*5900 [[XP]]
*[[Glacial Spike (dagger)]]
*[[Arcane Crystal Pendant]]
*[[Fire Ruby]]

==Progress==
Have you slain my old nemesis?

==Completion==
Incredible.  The shard has grown as it absorbed the drake's energy over the long years.

There is no more I can ask of you now.  My full ability to forge the arcane has returned with this shard.  My first creation is yours, <name>, and you have but to choose...

==Progression==
