== Description ==
It tries my patience, defending against creatures who can disappear into the sea at will and emerge where they please. But I will not back down until their like has been wiped from [[Azshara]].

Spitelash naga have slithered up the cliff walls and are besieging [[Southern Rocketway Terminus|this post]] from the east. Destroy them, <name>. Gut them head to tail, so that they know the full fury of my [[Horde]].

You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Progress ==
I trust you left a trail of destruction in your wake?

== Completion ==
<Torg scans the horizon.> And still they come! They are like a plague, <name>. But with strength like yours, we will crush them. Someday.

Seacallers summon a level 10 {{NPC||Shipwrecker}} water elemental to assist them.
