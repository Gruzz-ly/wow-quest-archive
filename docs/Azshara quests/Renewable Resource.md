==Objectives==
Use the Arcane Charge to retrieve 5 Animate Basalt from [[Balboa]] near the [[Ruins of Nordressa]].
*[[Animate Basalt]] (5)
*[[Arcane Charge (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
We're going to need some more animate basalt. There's only one reliable source for that in the area, a [[mountain giant]] named Balboa. We can't be killing the mountain giant if we want to keep stocked in the stuff long term, so we've just been chipping off pieces at a time.

You'll be able to see his path northeast and east of here. Find him, place the charge ahead on the path, and then hide until it goes off. Once he's cleared the area, you should be able to retrieve the basalt and bring it back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|840}} at max level)

==Prorgess==
I heard a few explosions. I can hardly tell if one of them was yours or not... these [[goblin]]s can be quite a nuisance.

==Completion==
Good work. This should keep us for another few hours before we have to go back for more.

He doesn't seem to be the brightest of giants. I expect we'll be able to keep doing this for a while before he catches on.

==Notes==
[[File:Animate Basalt.jpg|thumb|Animate Basalt chunks fall from Rocky.]]
The giant required for this quest, [[Balboa]] (as in Rocky Balboa), patrols an area north of the Ruins where you will be completing the other quests you receive with this one. He does not need to be engaged and should be avoided since he is an elite. Simply place the charge on the ground and several chunks will fly out of him. You shouldn't need to do this more than once or twice as several drop at a time.
