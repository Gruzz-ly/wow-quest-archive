==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sorata Firespinner]] in [[Bilgewater Harbor]].

==Description==
Thank you, little one.

Sometimes it's easy to get lost on the throes of love and lose sight of things, even as a dragon. I plan to rededicate myself entirely to making sure [[Kalec]] never steps up to take [[Malygos]]' place. It's the most noble cause I can think of.

You should head back to the harbor. I believe someone's waiting for you there.

Try not to get squashed or eaten by anything.

==Rewards==
{{itembox||Faded Wizard Hat}}
You will also receive: {{coppercost|2000}} (or {{coppercost|1080}} at max level)

==Completion==
Hey there... again.

Look, I gave you my hat. It was a gift. I thought you'd make some use of it. More specifically though, I thought you'd get it the heck away from me.

Can you imagine my surprise when [[Archmage Xylem|Xylem]] comes by himself to give it back to me? "Want to be more like my other apprentices, Sorata? Give your hat another try."  Not one of my proudest moments.

So what... you just tossed it aside for him to find? No. I don't think so. You're going to take this hat and you're going to like it. Really.

==Progression==
{{Azuregos quest chain}}

==Notes==
The "minnow" in the name of this quest is a reference to [[Maws]], which [[Azuregos]] previously mentioned in his dialogue during [[the Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest chain]].
