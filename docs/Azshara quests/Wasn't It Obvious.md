==Objectives==
Use the portal behind [[Joanna]] at [[Xylem]]'s tower to find [[Anara]] the [[Spirit Healer]] and—hopefully--[[Azuregos]].

==Description==
Azuregos! Yes, of course. Troubled old dragon, but lovely heart. I don't think all the years of vagabonds assaulting him have done him much good. He's a mite strange these days.

Not long ago, when returning yet again to our local Spirit Healer, Anara, I couldn't help but notice that her and Azuregos seemed to be hitting it off. I imagine he's still keeping her company.

The portal behind me is probably the quickest way to reach her. It might sting a little though.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|800}} (or {{coppercost|660}} at max level)

==Completion==
[[File:Wasn't It Obvious.jpg|thumb|You've found [[Azuregos]] at last.]]
Azuregos! At last you've found him!
