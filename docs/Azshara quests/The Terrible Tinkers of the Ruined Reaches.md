== Objectives ==
Slay Bingham Gadgetspring in the [[Ruined Reaches]], along with 4 Netgun Gnomes and 6 Zapper Gnomes.
*[[Bingham Gadgetspring]] slain
*[[Netgun Gnome]] slain x4
*[[Zapper Gnome]] slain x6

== Description ==
Scoundrels! Infidels! Ever since I started my operation here in [[Azshara]] the Gadgetspring family has hampered my studies and sabotaged my research. And now a mob of middling, second-rate tinkers have rallied to their aid! I have pressing business to attend to: see to it that those [[gnome]]s are finished for good.

Head to the Ruined Reaches on the coast, south of my [[Secret Lab]], and start rolling some of their disproportionately enormous heads for me.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Hobart's Spare Hubcap|Spring Gadget}}
You will receive:
*{{cost||6}}
* 975 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
I trust you've dug a significant number of tiny graves along the coast, yes?

== Completion ==
Oh - marvelous. Tell me more. And that precocious young Gadgetspring? Dead as well? Ah, wonderful. My work here is important but at times I do miss the carnage of demolishing my enemies on a more personal level. Here, perhaps you can make use of some of my discarded equipment.

== Notes ==
Head to the southwest, west of the naga path to the beach. Kill gnomes all the way down. Bingham is in the gnomish building at the end of the beach and the laxative for [[Azsharite Experiment Number One]] is upstairs. Bingham starts the fight by using his explosive sheep, which hits for ~130 damage, so be careful!
