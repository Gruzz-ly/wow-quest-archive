== Objectives ==
Collect a stonified {{NPC||Mountainfoot Miner}} from the [[Mountainfoot Strip Mine]] and bring him or her back to {{NPC||Horzak Zignibble}} at the [[Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange]].
*Stonified Miner Delivered

== Description ==
Workers act like it's their job to complain. If it isn't the backbreaking labor, the long hours, or the low pay, it's being turned to stone by [[basilisk]]s. It's always something.

But I'm thinking maybe this whole workers-to-stone business could be a big moneymaker for me. What if those guys are now high-quality stone? My whiny employees could be worth more to me as luxury building materials than a source of labor! Grab a stonified mountainfoot miner and haul him or her back to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
*875 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Get to the strip mine, <name>, and get me a sample of one of my former workers!

== Completion ==
Well well, let's take a look at what we got here...

<{{NPC||Horzak Zignibble||Horzak}} examines the shattered remains of the poor petrified miner.>

Bah! Crubmly! Useless. Wouldn't even make a good countertop. My miners may be mediocre workers, but they make lousy bricks.

<Sigh>. Well, I suppose we should re-fleshify these guys so I can get some return on my investment.

== Notes ==
Head down and find a {{NPC||Mountainfoot Miner}}. Right-click on the miner to pick him or her up. Players are "buffed" with Lugging a Goblin: This goblin needs to lose some weight! It has no effect other than visual, though.
