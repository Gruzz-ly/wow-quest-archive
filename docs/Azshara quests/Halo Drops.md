== Objectives ==
Call in [[Airborne Priest]]s at the bodies of 8 Wounded Soldiers on [[The Shattered Strand]].
*[[Wounded Soldier (Azshara)|Wounded Soldier]] rescued (0)
* [[Sanctified Flaregun]] (provided)

== Description ==
We've got "soldiers" all over the beach trying to get out of their work by dying on us. Find the slackers and use this flaregun to call in a priest to take care of the situation.

We can't have men thinking they can get off that easy.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Disposable Cloak
|Hort's Axe
|Hort's Motivator
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
It's a solid business model - Bedlam thought this one out pretty well. We hire 3 times as many people as we intend to pay, and depend on the rest to lose their money to resurrection fees.

Some of them even come back owing US money. Hah!

== Completion ==
Fine job there, bud. We'll have this beach cleaned up in no time.

==Notes==
There are [[Wounded Soldier (Azshara)|Wounded Soldiers]] all over the beach. You may have to battle naga to get close enough to them to fire the [[Sanctified Flaregun]], so do the quest [[Mop Up]] at the same time.

Fire the flaregun, and an [[Airborne Priest]] parachutes to the wounded soldier and resurrects him. The Wounded Soldier then runs off.

When the [[Airborne Priest]] lands, he says one of the following:
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|Health from above!}}
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|I've got what you need!}}
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|Light is money, friend.}}
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|Rez incoming!}}
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|Your salvation has arrived... and it's affordably priced!}}

After the [[Airborne Priest]] resurrects the Wounded Soldier, he says one of the following:
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|Back to work!}}
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|I'm charging you for hazard pay on this one, pal.}}
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|Not getting out of your debts that easy.}}
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|That's 3 for you, buddy. One more and my fee goes up.}}
*{{text|say|Airborne Priest|Walk it off.}}
