== Objectives ==
Kill Warlord Krellian and recover the SFG.
*[[Warlord Krellian]] slain
*[[SFG]]

== Description ==
We've lost contact with {{NPC||Sergeant Dynamo}}, stationed at the next ridge to the north of the central minefield. They were probably overrun.

He had our last SFG. Go over there and get it back. Clear out any naga that have broken through while you're there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*900 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Where's my rocket launcher, recruit?

== Completion ==
Quick work there, recruit.

She's a beauty, isn't she? Assembled her myself. I've got special plans for this baby.

== Notes ==
Dodge the path leading down to the ruins and circle north to the next ridge, where {{NPC||Warlord Krellian}} awaits, looking at the corpse of {{NPC||Sergeant Dynamo}}, who has the [[SFG]] next to him.

==Progression==
