== Objectives ==
Use [[Ironwrought Key]]s from cultists and dragonkin to free 4 [[Goblin]] Workers in [[Sable Ridge]].
*[[Bilgewater Laborer (Azshara)|Bilgewater Laborer]] rescued (4)

== Description ==
I knew these guys would be trouble as soon as we started building this tower. Scoffing our bribes. Stealing our workers.

Labor isn't cheap with all the construction in [[Azshara]]. I need those men back!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|s=11}}
*1,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
There's no way I'm paying them for time in captivity. Greedy little punks.

== Completion ==
Thanks there, pal. Here's your commission.

If you'll excuse me, I've gotta get these slackers back to work.
