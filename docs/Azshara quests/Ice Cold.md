==Objectives==
Use the Cryomatic 16 to freeze and kill 8 [[Sable Drake]]s.
*Sable Drake slain (8)
*[[Cryomatic 16]] (provided)

==Description==
I've got the perfect solution to our drake problem. My very own Cryomatic 16.

I originally developed it to freeze my workers during transport and between shifts so that I wouldn't have to feed and entertain them, but there were... complications. It should be perfect for dropping these drakes out of the sky though!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1100}} (or {{coppercost|900}} at max level)
* 1450 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
I wonder if there's any market for frozen, shattered drake parts. Maybe with a bit of marketing, I could pitch it as a new delicacy?

==Completion==
What? So you didn't bring any of the drake pieces back? Disappointing.

I knew I should have made you sign a contract before I sent you out...
