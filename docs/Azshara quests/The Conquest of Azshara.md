{{questportrait|Commander Jarrodenus.jpg|Commander Jarrodenus|One head stands between us and victory. This is that head.}}
== Objectives ==
Slay [[Commander Jarrodenus]] in [[Talrendis Point]] and collect his head.
*[[The Head of Jarrodenus]]

== Description ==
<Name>! Was it you who piloted the [[Grounded Wind Rider|wind rider]] who bombed the command center? It was a direct hit!

My [[scout]]s tell me that you gravely wounded Jarrodenus, flight master of the [[Night elf|night-elven]] skychasers and de facto commander of the opposition.

The opportunity to strike is now - I don't have time to assemble a full assault. Rush the command center building and kill Commander Jarrodenus before his backup arrives. Bring me his head... and Azshara is ours!

== Progress ==
Is Jarrodenus still barking orders, or have you removed from him the burden of his head?

== Completion ==
...Then it is done!

<Chawg surveys the battlefield.>

There are still pockets of resistance around our camp, but this rearguard action appears to be masking a full-fledged retreat to [[Ashenvale]]. Azshara is ours!

The Warchief will hear of this victory and your part in it. But we will surely need the help of a <class> like you elsewhere. Be sure to speak with Kroum here in camp before you leave.
