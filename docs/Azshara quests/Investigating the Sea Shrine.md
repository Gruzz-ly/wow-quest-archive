== Objectives ==
Investigate the Naga shrine for {{NPC||Torg Twocrush}}.
*Shrine investigated

== Description ==
The naga invaders have set up a series of shrines along the cliffs. I don't know their purpose, <name>, but I believe they're strengthening our foes. I need someone to get in there and root out this threat.

One nearby shrine is lightly defended: Cross the first bridge east of here and then head north towards the bay. You'll find it on a small outcropping. Investigate that shrine and come back with some info I can use.

== Completion ==
The stone in the center of this shrine emits a faint glow and roars with the power of the angry sea.
