==Objectives==
Collect 8 Mutilated Mistwing Carcasses from [[Mistwing Cliffdweller]]s.
*[[Mutilated Mistwing Carcass]] (8)

==Description==
While you're here [[Mysterious Azsharite|running around the cliffs]], perhaps you can help me with another line of investigation. The [[Cliff Crasher|giants]] who walk these cliffs have been here since these mountains formed. Maybe they know where the [[Azsharite]] comes from? It's in our best interest to befriend these giants and find out.

Gather up a gigantic meal for me as a peace offering! Kill the mistwing cliffdwellers that have been such a nuisance to our studies and collect their carcasses for me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6}}
*900 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
I probably should've warned you that mistwing [[chimaera]]s can shoot lightning.

==Completion==
Phew! The stench! Well, hopefully that massive heap of carcasses smells more appetizing to a giant.

==Notes==
Plenty of chimaera in the area with the azsharite formations.
