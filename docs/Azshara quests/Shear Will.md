==Objectives==
Obtain 80 Pristine Thunderhead Feathers from the [[Hippogryph]]s near the [[Ruins of Nordressa]].
*[[Pristine Thunderhead Feather]] (80)

==Description==
I'd be amazing! At archmagery. Amazing! He won't even talk to me because I don't have a stupid robe and hat. Pffft.

The most amazing archmage this land has ever seen can't just have any robe and hat. I need to show him that I'm something special, and I know just how to do it.

Go out there and kill some of those hippogryph things. Bring me back a TON of feathers.

You heard me! A whole bunch of feathers! Go go, I'll have the robe ready for them by the time you get back.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My robe's looking pretty good. Did you bring those feathers? 

==Completion==
Ha ha! Perfect! Let me toss this together really fast. [[Archmage Xylem|The Archmage]] is sure to be taken in by my style! 

==Notes==
When this quest was first put on the beta, the birds only dropped one feather at a time. However, this was fixed so they drop 5-12 feathers at a time.
