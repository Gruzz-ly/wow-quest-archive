==Objectives==
Receive 6 Energized charges from the Energy Conduits as you ascend to the top of the [[Arcane Pinnacle]].
*Arcane Trial Completed

==Description==
This is somewhat simple and somewhat not simple. All the way up there are Energy Conduits. Rather like this one right here one might say! Indeed, I do say.

Now for you. You must use my jump pads to ascend the pinnacle, and you must touch all of the conduits you see along the way. When you get to me at the top, you should be all juicy with energy, because really that's the only way to be.

And be sure to keep moving or you're likely to be sent for quite a trip!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Charged Robes
|Juicy Bracers
|Capacitance Bands
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
No no no, you've got it all wrong. You were supposed to gather Energy from the Conduits before you came up here, remember?

One more time, with style!

==Completion==
It is in this moment that most of my apprentices wonder if there was a logical purpose to storing the energy for my portal in those conduits so that it has to be collected in such a fashion.

Of course there's a purpose! I wish to study your behavior... your strategies, your mistakes, your frustrations, your triumphs. Those are the entire point of these trials.

Now, more. More trials! Doesn't that sound exciting?! Of course it does. 

==Notes==
Along with Xylem's other trials, a series of warnings flash across the screen with instructions. They say:

:{{Text|bossemote|Spread across the ledge of the Arcane Pinnacle are 6 pedestals that will energize you if touched.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Using the energy pads on the ground, ascend the Arcane Pinnacle, touching all the pedestals along the way.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Keep moving or you will risk being hit by arcane detonations that will hurl you into the waters below.}}

If you get blown off the cliff, there is a jump gate at {{coords|55.4|14.9|Azshara}} that will put you back up where the initial Image of Archmage Xylem is located. Additionally, the cliff side in this particular spot is molded to allow climbing up manually.

Do not forget to ''click the items'' along the way, including the first one next to Xylem's image, rather than simply hurrying to the top. You will not complete the quest this way.

:{{Text|say|Image of Archmage Xylem|Marvelous! You bound ahead with more haste than a flame-laden kitten. Quite suitable indeed!}}
