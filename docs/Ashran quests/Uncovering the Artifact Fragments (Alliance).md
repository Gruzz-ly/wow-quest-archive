==Objectives==
[[Misirin Stouttoe]] in [[Stormshield Stronghold]] wants you to go kill creatures in the outskirts of [[Ashran]] outside of the main road and bring back 5 [[Artifact Fragment]]s to [[Ecilam]].
* Collect: [[Artifact Fragment]] (500)

==Description==
The Artifact Fragments seem to come from any creature we've found in the outskirts of Ashran. Go out and kill any you find and bring at least five to Ecilam the Mage near the campfire in Stormshield Stronghold.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Disposable Pocket Flying Machine]]
*{{cost|15|40|}}
* 7,540 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Wrynn's Vanguard]]

==Progress==
Are those Artifact Fragments, I see?

==Completion==
Good work. If you happen to find anymore Artifact Fragments, bring them to me or the others in need of them to contribute to the war effort.
