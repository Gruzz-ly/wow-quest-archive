==Objectives==
Bring [[Tyra Silverblood]] 10 Ashmaul Pearls.
* [[Ashmaul Pearl]] (10)

==Description==
The Alliance have increased their usage of snares, roots and stuns on our melee forces. Luckily I have just the potion for them. The recipe is a little old, but it'll work. 

A key ingredient I need can be found here in Ashran, at the beach near that Ogre Tower.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|30|80|}}
|Vintage Free Action Potion

==Progress==
I need those pearls for the potion, did you find them <name>?

==Completion==
It is made. If you don't have any use for it, give it to one of our melee.

==Gains==
*+25 [[Vol'jin's Spear]]

==Notes==
The item required for this quest is no longer obtainable, but the quest itself remains in the game for those who still have any Ashmaul Pearls.

==Patch changes==
