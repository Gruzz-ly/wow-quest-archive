== Progress ==
That extravagant fortification you built is impressive. Tell me, does it keep all the bad things away? Yes?  How about an exchange for a bit of fate? A wall can be thick enough, but one is never lucky enough. Besides, safety can be so overpriced...

Remember, you can only obtain three seals per week.  This counts as one of those three.  Next week, I may have others.
* Collect: [[Garrison Resources]] x1,000

== Completion ==
Feeling safe, stranger?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Seal of Inevitable Fate]]

==Notes==
*Players may acquire THREE Seals of Inevitable Fate every week, and this weekly quest counts as one of those three acquisitions. It is cheapest overall to spread out the acquisitions over the four different currencies: [[Apexis Crystal]], [[Garrison Resources]], Gold, and [[Honor Points]], as acquiring an additional seal with the same currency will cost double the amount.
