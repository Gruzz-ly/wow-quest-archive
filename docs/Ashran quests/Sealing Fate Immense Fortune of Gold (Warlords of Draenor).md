== Progress ==
Four times the cost of the first, but only one seal. Remember, I still offer more efficient options, but I never refuse someone who is insistent on paying me more. I leave you the choice.

Remember, you can only obtain three seals per week. This counts as one of those three. Next week, I may have others.
*Required money: {{cost|2,000}}

== Completion ==
A simple exchange with complex results. That's the art of doing business.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Seal of Inevitable Fate]]

==Notes==
*Players may acquire THREE Seals of Inevitable Fate every week, and this weekly quest counts as one of those three acquisitions. It is cheapest overall to spread out the acquisitions over the four different currencies: [[Apexis Crystal]], [[Garrison Resources]], Gold, and [[Honor Points]], as acquiring an additional seal with the same currency will cost double the amount.

==Progression==
{{Tempered Fate weeklies}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 6.2.0|note=Reward updated from [[Seal of Tempered Fate]].}}
* {{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
