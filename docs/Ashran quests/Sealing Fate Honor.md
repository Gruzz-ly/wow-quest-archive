== Progress ==
To kill another for honor is peculiar...a relic of an older time, perhaps? No matter, this seal is of no use to me. It is far too burdened with power for me to control.

Remember, you can only collect three seals per week. This counts as one of those three. Next week, I may have others.
*Collect: [[Honor Points]] x500

== Completion ==
A bloody price to pay just to play with luck. Let's hope it was worth it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Seal of Inevitable Fate]]

==Notes==
*Players may acquire THREE Seals of Inevitable Fate every week, and this weekly quest counts as one of those three acquisitions. It is cheapest overall to spread out the acquisitions over the four different currencies: [[Apexis Crystal]], [[Garrison Resources]], Gold, and [[Honor Points]], as acquiring an additional seal with the same currency will cost double the amount.
