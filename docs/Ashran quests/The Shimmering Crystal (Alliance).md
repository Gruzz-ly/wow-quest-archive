==Objectives==
Bring the [[Shimmering Timewarped Crystal]] to [[Tempra]] in [[Stormshield]].

==Description==
Though the crystal appears familiar at first, upon contact with your finger it reveals itself as so much more. A grand, lost civilization appears in front of you. Fixtures of gold shimmer in every direction, bright feathers of purple occasionally falling from overhead. You hear the distant sounds of battle, culminating in a thunderous explosion that overwhelms all of your senses and turns your vision white.

When your vision returns, you feel something within you pulling you toward [[Ashran]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*500x [[Timewarped Badge]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've always been fascinated with [[Age of Order|The Age of Order]], but never have I found such an interesting crystal.

I will study this artifact. Perhaps I chose the right time to conduct my research.
