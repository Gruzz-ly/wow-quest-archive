==Objectives==
Bring the [[Shimmering Timewarped Crystal#Horde]] to [[Kronnus]] in [[Warspear]].

==Description==
Though the crystal appears familiar at first, upon contact with your finger it reveals itself as so much more. A grand, lost civilization appears in front of you. Fixtures of gold shimmer in every direction, bright feathers of purple occasionally falling from overhead. You hear the distant sounds of battle, culminating in a thunderous explosion that overwhelms all of your senses and turns your vision white.

When your vision returns, you feel something within you pulling you toward [[Ashran]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*500x [[Timewarped Badge]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The [[Age of Order]] shaped much of [[Draenor]]'s future in many [[Alternate timeline|timelines]]. With each new artifact we find, we learn more about their development and demise, the commonalities and dissonances between each branch.

This artifact is the most peculiar of all. You did well to bring it to me.
