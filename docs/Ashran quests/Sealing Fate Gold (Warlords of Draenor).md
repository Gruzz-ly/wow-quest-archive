== Progress ==
Gold is indeed treasure, but additional treasure for gold? That's the offer I present. A Seal of Twisted Fate twists time, providing a burst of additional luck just when you need it.

Remember, you can only obtain three Seals of Twisted Fate per week. This counts as one of those three. Next week, I may have others.
*Required money: {{cost|500}}

== Completion ==
A simple exchange with complex results. That's the art of doing business.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Seal of Inevitable Fate]]

==Notes==
*Players may acquire THREE Seals of Inevitable Fate every week, and this weekly quest counts as one of those three acquisitions. It is cheapest overall to spread out the acquisitions over the four different currencies: [[Apexis Crystal]], [[Garrison Resources]], Gold, and [[Honor Points]], as acquiring an additional seal with the same currency will cost double the amount.
