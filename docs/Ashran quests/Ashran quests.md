# Ashran quests

[[File:WorldMap-Ashran.jpg|thumb|Map of Ashran.]]

While a Player vs. Player-focused zone, Ashran is home to a surprising number of quests - though a large number of those quests have since been removed.

[[Patch 8.0.1]] have discontinued Ashran, and removed almost all quests associated with it. As of [[patch 8.2.0]] most of those quests are now done on the Battleground version of Ashran.

==Arrival to Ashran==
The player is initially sent to Ashran after establishing their Garrison on Draenor.

#[[A Surly Dwarf]] / [[Burning Beauty]]
#[[Delvar Ironfist (quest)]] / [[The Dark Lady's Gift]]

In addition, players have an additional lead to Ashran once they obtain their first [[Outpost Building Assembly Notes]], though only if the player didn't previously buy any building upgrades.

Having arrived to Ashran, the player is then sent to familiarize themself with the island. This part is removed in [[patch 8.0.1]].

==Ashran Dominance==
Now that the player is familiarized with the island, it's time for action. The main quest requires defeating the opposing faction in four primary areas, and then defeating enemy leader. There is another quest focused on just defeating the leader. Easier said than done.

==Artifact Fragments==
After completing [[Uncovering the Artifact Fragments]], the player can keep bringing in [[Artifact Fragment]]s for additional reputation.

==Token of demise==
While killing other players on Ashran, the player can occasionally obtain tokens of their demise. The player can bring those tokens to get [[Dented Ashmaul Strongbox]] for each one.
