== Progress ==
You seem like the type who is always seeking power, no? These seals provide an investment, if you will, in your future power.

I also seek power, but one that is a more immediate and tangible. If you manage to find some crystals, we can make a deal.

Remember, you can only obtain three seals per week. This counts as one of those three. Next week, I may have others.
*Collect: [[Apexis Crystal]] x500

== Completion ==
Of course you agree.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Seal of Inevitable Fate]]

==Notes==
*Players may acquire THREE Seals of Inevitable Fate every week, and this weekly quest counts as one of those three acquisitions. It is cheapest overall to spread out the acquisitions over the four different currencies: [[Apexis Crystal]], [[Garrison Resources]], Gold, and [[Honor Points]], as acquiring an additional seal with the same currency will cost double the amount.
