==Objectives==
Bring [[Tyra Silverblood]] 10 Ghost Truffles.
*[[Ghost Truffle]] (10)

==Description==
Every turn you take in [[Ashran]] you run into danger. But don't fret <name>, I've developed the perfect solution. It's my very own riff on the popular [[Invisibility Potion]]. 

I'm just missing one of the ingredients: cave mushrooms. 

Luckily, a variety grows right here in Ashran.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|30|80|}}
|Phantom Potion
}}

==Progress==
Are those the truffles?

==Completion==
Here she is! Careful with her, these potions have a reputation for mysteriously disappearing.

==Gains==
*+25 reputation with [[Vol'jin's Spear]]

==Notes==
The item required for this quest is no longer obtainable, but the quest itself remains in the game for those who still have any Ghost Truffles.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
