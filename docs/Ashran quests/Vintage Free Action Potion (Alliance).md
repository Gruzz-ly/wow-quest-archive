==Objectives==
Bring [[Gimlet Ginfizz]] 10 Ashmaul Pearls.
* [[Ashmaul Pearl]] (10)

==Description==
I hear our heroes in the front line are becoming victim to massive amounts of snares, roots and stuns! Luckily I have just the potion for them. The recipe is a little old, but it'll work. 

A key ingredient I need can be found here in Ashran, at the beach near that Ogre Tower.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|30|80|}}
|Vintage Free Action Potion

==Progress==
Have you got the pearls, <name>?

==Completion==
And here's your potion, <name>! If you don't have any use for it, maybe gift it to a friend who does?

==Gains==
*+25 [[Wrynn's Vanguard]]

==Notes==
The item required for this quest is no longer obtainable, but the quest itself remains in the game for those who still have any Ashmaul Pearls.

==Patch changes==
