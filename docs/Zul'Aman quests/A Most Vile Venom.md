==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Venomhexxer Raxxis.png|Venomhexxer Raxxis|This Vilebranch doctor is to blame for the new types of venom used against the Witherbark.}}
Kill the Vilebranch Venomhexxer and find the fang Tobui described.
*[[Venomhexxer Raxxis]] slain
*[[Ritual Fang]]

==Description==
The Vilebranch are cooking up more bad things. We should go to the source and make them stop! 

[[Halazzi]] has smelled their venom mixing place someplace to the southeast. More than just frog venom. 

...Oh, Halazzi also said to bring back some kind of huge fang. Frogs don't have fangs, though. Well, find it anyway!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,705 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you look for the big fang?

==Completion==
Hey, that's a spider fang. That must have been one huge spider!

==Notes==
Make sure you accept [[Probable Paralytic]] as well.

Halazzi has a gossip
{{Dialogue|The Vilebranch continue to assault my lynxes and the Witherbark.

{{Gossip|Does this have something to do with [[Shadra]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|That is what we will discover. A hunt can be a long path.}}
}}

So too does [[Sakaja]],
{{Dialogue|We were traveling on the road from the village and were ambushed by [[Venomhexxer Raxxis|someone]] unseen in the forest. I heard a voice rambling about testing a new venom.

Immediately [[Daki]] was hit with something and could barely walk. I dragged him here as quickly as I could!}}

Head to Raxxis' altar.
:{{Text|Emote|Venomhexxer Raxxis hums cheerfully to himself.}}
:{{Text|Say|Venomhexxer Raxxis|Frog venom not as strong as de spider, but not bad...}}

Walk up and confront the witch doctor,
:{{Text|Say|Venomhexxer Raxxis|Why hello dere, test subject!}}

Upon slaying the doctor
:{{Text|Say|Venomhexxer Raxxis|You... resisted my venoms?}}

Take the Ritual Fang from the [[Ritual Supplies (Zul'Aman)|Ritual Supplies]] and then turn in both quests.
