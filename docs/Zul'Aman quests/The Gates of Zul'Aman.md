==Objectives==
Meet [[Lady Liadrin]] at the [[Amani Pass]].

==Description==
After the [[Amani tribe|Amani]] surrender, we demanded [[Zul'jan]] relinquish our [[lightwood]] and return to their lands. Even so, Zul'jan still lingers at the gates of [[Zul'Aman]] with his troops.

Lady Liadrin and her [[Blood Knights]] hold the pass, and Liadrin is trying to remedy the situation with diplomacy, but she reports that aggression may begin anew.

She requests your assistance in this precarious matter.

==Rewards==

* {{cost|11|70}}

Our cease-fire is strained but holding. For now.
