==Objectives==
Kill 12 murlocs in [[Atal'Abasi]].
*[[Murloc]]s slain (12)

==Description==
Me and [[Tobani]] had loaded de skiff with medicine, steel, and food to bring upriver to de forward camp.

It was meant to be a quiet run. No trouble, no eyes on us.

But in de shallows, de murlocs came swarmin' out of de reeds all foam and teeth. Dey hit us hard--too fast to fight back proper. We tipped and lost de cargo. I barely made it to shore.

Tolbani didn't. I dragged his dart-riddled body here.

De murlocs must pay for what dey have done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]
