==Objectives==
Slay the echoes of Prigmon, Zungam, Budd Nedreck, and Harrison Jones.
*[[Prigmon]] slain
*[[Zungam]] slain
*[[Budd Nedreck]] slain
*[[Harrison Jones]] slain

==Description==
De scouts report seeing a few unique faces amongst de echoes.

I feel old angers rising when de scouts spoke their names. They were not honorable fighters for us to challenge ourselves against, such as ya self. They were vermin--Greedy opportunists that drove legions of conniving adventurers to rob us of our possessions, our treasures, and... our tusks.

Even as echoes of de past, slaying them should reduce de number of echoes appearing.

And it will make me laugh to see them fall.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,695 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I admit it, <name>. Knowing you slayed de instigators brings warmth my old bones.

Does that lower your opinion of me?

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Four Instigators''' from Torundo the Grizzled & [[Hex the Innocent, Disrupt the Guilty]] from [[Elder Doru]],
:{{Text|Say|Elder Doru|Do not forget that these are mere echoes. They feel no pain. They do not die.}}

Upon confronting [[Zungam]],
:{{Text|Say|Zungam|The least I can be doin' is stickin' around to offer my services!}}

Upon slaying [[Zungam]],
:{{Text|Say|Zungam|I never gon' forgive dat [[Griftah]] for sendin' me out here...}}

There's even an echo of [[Zungam's Anvil]] that was present.

Upon confronting [[Budd Nedreck]] at the [[Talonstrike Terrace]],
:{{Text|Say|Budd Nedreck|I can only assume that you know who I am. And yet you insist on disturbing me?}}

Upon slaying [[Budd Nedreck]],
:{{Text|Say|Budd Nedreck|Oh come now, don't be ridiculous! I'm the one and only Budd Nedreck!}}

Upon confronting [[Harrison Jones]],
:{{Text|Say|Harrison Jones|A word to the wise, stranger, go back to wherever you're from!}}

Upon slaying [[Harrison Jones]],
:{{Text|Say|Harrison Jones|Are you here to train in Archaeology...}}

Upon confronting [[Prigmon]] at the [[Firewing Terrace]],
:{{Text|Say|Prigmon|Budd's been refinin' his forest troll disguise! They just be needin' one last touch!}}

Upon slaying [[Prigmon]],
:{{Text|Say|Prigmon|My skinnin' talents be wasted 'ere. Somethin' about yankin' troll tusks be makin me queasy...}}

Return to the [[Altar of Malacrass]] to turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Torundo the Grizzled|Admit it, Doru. You love how all this reminds you of de old days.}}
:{{Text|Say|Elder Doru|Hah! All it reminds me of is dragging ya sorry, beaten self off de battlefield over and over again.}}
