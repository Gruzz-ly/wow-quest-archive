He's our uncle. We can't leave him here.

Eagles... loa... we don't have time to dwell on de spirits of the past.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both '''Important Amani''' from Zul'jan & [[Show Us Your Worth]] from [[Zul'jarra]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|We can split up to cover more ground. <Name> and I--}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|No. An elf in Zul'Aman is an elf with a blade in her back. You come with me. Jan, keep an eye on her friend.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'Jan|I will watch their every move.}}
:''The party departs.''

Head to [[Swiftclaw Terrace]] and speak with Torundo the Grizzled.
{{dialogue|<Torundo eyes you suspiciously and moves as if he is hiding something behind him.>

Who you be?

Is it time to leave Atal'Aman?

{{gossip|quest=|Yes. Zul'jan sent me to find you.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Torundo the Grizzled|Thanks for clearing de way, stranger.}}
:{{Text|Say|Torundo the Grizzled|I'll help Zul'jan prepare our ballistas once I see de children here to safety.}}
:''Torundo the Grizzled leaves''

Speak with Elder Doru.
{{dialogue|<Elder Doru is preoccupied with collecting lightwood weapons from an abandoned wagon.>

I heard de battle drums, but we can't leave these weapons behind.

{{gossip|quest=|Zul'jan sent me to find you..}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Elder Doru|Hope Zul'jan brought more lightwood back. I'm tired of workin' with only leftover scraps.}}
:''Erder Doru picks up the crate and leaves.''

Go to [[Talonstrike Terrace]] as Zul'jan is speaking to the Loa Speaker Kinduru.
:{{Text|Say|Zul'Jan|Please, uncle. We are under attack! Only take what you need and let's go!}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|Just a minute now, Jan-boy.}}

Speak with Kinduru.
{{dialogue|Hm. Should I invoke de keen eyes of [[Akil'zon]] or [[Halazzi]] to dispel what be hidin' it from me?

Why not both? Yes, yes. Why not both?

{{gossip|quest=|It is time to evacuate, Loa Speaker Kinduru.}}

{{gossip|Who are Akil'zon and Halazzi?}}
{{dialogue-child|Dey be two of our sacred loa! Halazzi. de loa of de hunt and Akil'zon, de loa of victory!

Akil'zon is keen-eyed. Halazzi hides in de shadows. But he can reveal what be hidden!

I speak for... or. I spoke for. Akil'zon--de loa of victory!

Oh, how I want to hear de loa again. Now. before dis shrine be destroyed by de Twilight's Blade.

But de loa silent now... Maybe dey hear us, maybe dey don't. Maybe dey be speakin' loud but we can't hear dem because of somethin' we have done.

If we had a hash'ey... maybe...

{{gossip|I'd like to ask you something else.}}
}}

{{gossip|Why is your staff important?}}
{{dialogue-child|It is de staff held by de hash'ey--someone who unites de people an' wields de power of de loa.

If de loa ever speak to us again. we gonna need dis staff.

We haven't had a true hash'ey in... a very long time.

But an' old man can hope!

{{gossip|I'd like to ask you something else.}}
}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|I need my staff. Akil'zon will never grant me favor again if I abandon de staff in battle!}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'Jan|So Old man, de loa stopped granting us favor decades ago. And we are better off without them.}}

Scour the [[Hastily Packed Belongings]] for the pieces.
:{{Text|Say|Zul'Jan|You sure you didn't pack it already?}}

Scour the last Belonging and it has the real Hash'ey staff.
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|My staff! You got de eyes of our blessed Akil'zon herself.}}
