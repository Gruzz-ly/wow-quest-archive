==Description==
De [[loa]] have not spoken to us in many years... Not since I was a young child.

And dey have showed no sign of wanting to help us now.

No. It is up to us alone. We must find a way to rally de other tribes and fight de [[Twilight's Blade]] as one.

I will speak to de tribal representatives and help de refugees where I can--dey are our priority.

Come, you might learn somethin' about de Amani.

==Progress==
Ancestors willing, we will find our opportunity to strike back soon.

==Completion==
Hash'ey? Has uncle lost his sense?

It is a tale for children. Maybe if this were de old days, generations ago, before de elves arrived...

But if de last chance we got is to try to speak to the loa, then I will try.

==Notes==
;Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|No point in talking about de loa. Dey abandoned us long ago. Come. Let us check on de refugees.}}

While leaving the Zari Lodge as Liadrin and Zul'jarra departed, [[Zul'jan]] and [[Kul'amara the Fierce]] are speaking
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Your forces are needed here, Kul'amara.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kul'amara the Fierce|Den stop de Vilebranch from kidnappin' us in de middle of de night!}}
:''Kul'amara the Fierce mounted on her eagle and departed.''
:{{Text|Emote|Zul'jan scowls at Kul'amara angrily.}}
:''Zul'jan walks off.''

Go to Zul'jarra and Liadrin as they are aiding the Refugees with [[Torundo the Grizzled]].
:{{Text|Say|[[Small Refugee]]|Mama! I'm so hungry...}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Torundo, I need ya report. When can our soldiers be ready for battle?}}
:{{Text|Say|Torundo the Grizzled|It don't look good. All that's left be de old, de injured, and de hungry.}}

Zul'jarra has a gossip:
{{dialogue|All Amani are fierce, but many of these refugees are not trained fighters.}} 

Walk to the [[Rations Cauldron]] and serve rations to the refugees.
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Your people's situation is far more desperate than I realized.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|De tribes have splintered since [[Zul'jin]] [[Zul'jin (tactics)|fell]]. De [[Twilight Blade]] be picking us apart because we no longer work as one.}}

Follow Liadrin and Zul'jarra to meet with Lilaju.
:{{Text|Say|Lilaju|De [[Revantusk tribe|Revantusk]]'s best smiths be repairing our weapons, Zul'jarra{{sic}}}}

Zul'jarra has a new gossip:
{{dialogue|De Revantusk lost their village first, they were on the front line of the Twiligh{{sic}} Blade assault.}}

Speak with Lilaju:
{{dialogue|We Revantusk lost our elders an' our village because of de Twilight's Blade, Including me grandfaddah.

I lead de Revantusk now.

{{gossip|quest=|<Request lightwood report.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilaju|We are workin' as fast as we can. But many of our weapons were broken in de attack.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Keep it up. These weapons are our best chance against de void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|If de lightwood weapons not be ready, maybe de Shadowpine shamans can help.}}

Follow Liadrin and Zul'jarra to meet with Tak'lejo.
:{{Text|Say|Tak'lejo|Ah, Zul'jarra. You come seeking de power of my tribe's shamans?}}

Zul'jarra has a new gossip:
{{gossip|De Shadowpine have no village, dey are nomads of Zul' Aman. After they lost their loa, [[Jan'alai|de Dragonhawk]], they lost their anchor.}}

Speak with Tak'lejo.
{{dialogue|We only be a dozen left. We survivors gon' think before we act.

De Shadowpine waits and listens.

{{gossip|quest=|Where are the shamans?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Tak'lejo|You know none can order de Shadowpine. We wander, obeying only de inner fire in each of us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Then we be left with few warriors, few weapons, and few shamans as well...}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|It is time for desperate acts. Would you let your people perish because you didn't try every option?}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Fool elf, I told you de loa be silent! If you need proof, we let de old loa speaker tell you himself!}}

Follow them once more to [[Kinduru]].
:{{Text|Say|Kinduru|You were with me as a child when I last went to [[Akil'zon]]'s [[Temple of Akil'zon|temple]], Zul'jarra. Do you not remember?}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Yes, uncle. But even den de loa did not speak to us.}}

Speak with Kinduru:
{{dialogue|When Zul'jarra was a child and her grandfather, Zul'jin, was chieftain, de loa were still at de heart of Amani culture--as dey had been since de Amani feet touch dis earth.

All de Amani chieftain had to present themselves to de loa. But only some were blessed by all and became hash'ey--not just a chief, not just a speaker for de loa, but a fearsome warrior and a pillar of de community.

Dis is de journey Zul'jarra must undertake, loa willing! Dis is what will save us.

And you... will you help her? Yes, you are not Amani, but you are strong. And I sense Akil'zon has blessed you with victory many times before. I can think of no one better to be her hash'ura.

{{gossip|quest=|I will help Zul'jarra.}}

{{gossip|What is a "hash'ura?"}}
{{dialogue-child|De path of de hash'ey is long and arduous, full of trials and perils.

A hash'ura is an acolyte of de hash'ey. Dey follow dem along de path. Dey fight for dem--and dey die for dem.

Usually there are, erm, two. But, seeing as I am an old man, our soldiers are injured, and Zul'jan would never agree...

I guess Liadrin will have to be de second.

<Kinduru laughs uncertainly.>

De honor of hash'ura goin' to two blood elves. What a time to be alive.

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Kinduru|De loa always heed us in times of crisis. Dey may listen now to de right voice--someone on de path of de hash'ey!}}
