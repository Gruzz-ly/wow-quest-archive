Light the Hash'ey Shrines around the [[Temple of Halazzi]].
*First Hash'ey Shrine found
*Lynx Hash'ey Shrine activated (3)
*Final Lynx Hash'ey Shrine activated

==Description==
The Vilebranch seemed to be just as confused by the mist as the Witherbark.

Whatever has caused de mist, dealin' with de Vilebranch changed nothing.

And now we must find de hash'ey shrines in de dark.

<Zul'jarra moves her hand in front of her face, testing her range of visibility and frowns.>

We must all light de shrines. Try not to get separated.

Dis will try my patience. But I'm sure if we use our heads we will find de path.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Prowlers Cloth]]
* [[Prowlers Shawl]]

You will also receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,365 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Findin' Halazzi and de hash'ey shrines has taught me patience. And forced me to think through my obstacles--instead of cuttin' my way through dem.

I wish Zul'jan were here. He would be proud of me for gainin' some brains. Heh.

==Notes==
