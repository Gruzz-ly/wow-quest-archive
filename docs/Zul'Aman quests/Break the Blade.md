[[Zul'jan]]'s ballista is ready. And it had better work after what he has done.

We lost de army we needed to defend de city, but we can fend off Mor'duun long enough to let our people escape.

Help my brother man de ballista. Focus on de Shadow Warders and de pylon. Liadrin and I will distract Mor'duun.

I will kill him if I can, but even den we can't stay here. There's too much void energy. And too much destruction. Atal Aman is truly lost

:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|With me, elf. Let's get in close an' distract him.}}
:''The two departed.''
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Get over here, <name>! I'll load de bolts. You start firing.}}

Zul'jan has a gossip:
{{dialogue|You about to see how potent my lightwood ballista is!}}

;Upon getting on the Lightwood Ballista
:{{Text|Yell|Mor'duun|Mere mortal armaments cannot stop the glorious machinations of Xal'atath!}}

;Upon destroying the 8 Shadow Wards
:{{Text|Yell|Mor'duun|GRAH! Your weapons are empowered with Light?}}

Upon destroying the Pylon, a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Mor'duun Escapes" starts playing:
:''A big lightwood ballista bolt breaks Mor'duun's pylon.''
:''Mor'duun turns away but then Lady Liadrin & Zul'jarra came to confront them. The two charge at Mor'duun but the ogre cast his shadows at Liadrin but she deflected it with her shield. Zul'jarra grunts leaping in to slay Mor'duun. However, Mor'duun stopped Zul'jarra as she plummeted and picks herself up as Liadrin knelt to Zul'jarra.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Mor'duun|Foolish Amani. You have already lost.}}
:''Liadrin purifies Zul'jarra as she gets back up.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Mor'duun|Your city is in ruins. No one is coming to help you--not even your gods.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Mor'duun|[[Xal'atath]] relishes in your anguish and will exalt us when your empire falls.}}
:''Zul'jarra grunts as she throws her axe toward Mor'duun. Unfortunately, Mor'duun starts glowing the void avoiding the axe as it went pass through him and the Orge begins hover above her.''.
:{{Text|Bossemote|Mor'duun|Don't worry. Your end will come soon.}}
:''Mor'duun and all his Twilight Blade teleport away. Liadrin and Adventurer gazed at Mor'duun getting away as Zul'jarra bellowed in rage.''

On the other side of the cutscene, Liadrin and Zul'jarra are speaking to Zul'jan.
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Running away? Coward. De victory should have been ours!}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Dis was no victory. We bought de civilians' escape with blood.}}
:''Zul'jan departs on his eagle.''
