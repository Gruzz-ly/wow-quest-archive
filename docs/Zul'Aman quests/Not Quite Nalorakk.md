==Objectives==
Remove 12{{Sic}} Nalorakk Trinkets from the [[furbolg]]s in the [[Spiritpaw Village]].
*[[Nalorakk Trinket]] (8)

==Description==
We saw you go inside [[Den of Nalorakk|Nalorakk's temple]]. Did you talk to [[Nalorakk]]? That doesn't make sense. We have a new "friend" that is the Voice of Nalorakk. He says Nalorakk won't talk to anybody but him.

He gave out trinkets so that we could feel closer to Nalorakk. But they've made the tribe fight over who has the trinkets. The ursas think it's unfair they don't get any. It's like a war within the tribe.

We gotta get the trinkets out of the village.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,860 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I don't want them. We'll toss them on the fire.

==Completion==
It'll be better without those trinkets corrupting my friends.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Furgh|Everybody wants to fight, even if they got no trinkets. Be careful.}}

Make sure you accept [[Too Much Twilight]] from [[Fleeg]]
:{{Text|Say|Fleeg|The guardians can smell the bad stuff.}}

Loot the Nalorakk Trinkets from the [[Spiritpaw Chosen]]s & the [[Spiritpaw Den Watcher]]s.

Return to the Furbolg duo and turn in both quests.
