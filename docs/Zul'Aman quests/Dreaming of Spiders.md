==Objectives==
Attempt the ritual with the fang and eye to speak to Shadra.
*Fang of Shadra placed
*Eye of Shadra placed

==Description==
There be three relics of [[Shadra]]. I only had two. I had the fang in the village and the eye hidden here. Dey musta stolen the fang somehow, then come for the eye!

We never had de Shell of Shadra: it was lost when we left [[Shadra'Alor]]. It's possible the Vilebranch have de shell.

The fang and eye should let us talk to Shadra briefly, even if we lack de last ritual bit to summon her.

Come with me. I will show you how.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,860 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is the Shadra I remember from Shadra'Alor. She will assist us if we help her.

She keeps her promises.
