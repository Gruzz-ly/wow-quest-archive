I have heard your mrgls, my people. Your stomachs grgl in hunger!

The invaders have cut you off from the food you so desperately need to survive.

I will send my champion to gather fish so you may fill your bellies once more!

Or you can just give me fish if you have some?

* 1,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My kingdom is ready for a feast! Are you prepared?

==Completion==
Witness the power of my champion! Be fed, my people, and hunger no more!

==Notes and trivia==
Upon accepting [[Murloc Madness]], '''Fish Are Food, Not Friends''', & [[Following Suit]],
:{{Text|Say|King Mrgl-Mrgl|Witness my champion, whom I have granted my blessing, go forth to do battle on your behalf!}}

King Mrgl-Mrgl gets a new gossip.
{{Dialogue|<King Mrgl-Mrgl drops his voice to a whisper.>

If we can somehow stop the Deepfin Incursion, these murlocs should return to their begrudgingly peaceful coexistence with the trolls.

And then the "Loa of Murlocs" won't be needed to protect them, and we can leave!}}

Around [[Atal'Abasi]] interact with the skewers and collect the Murloc-Skewered Lynxfish.

Return to the altar,
:{{Text|Say|King Mrgl-Mrgl|Behold! Witness the triumphant return of the hero of murlocs!}}

This quest's name was a reference to the sharks' motto from ''{{wp|Finding Nemo}}'': "Fish are friends, not food."
