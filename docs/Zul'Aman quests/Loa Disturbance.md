==Objectives==
Find [[Loa Speaker Sij'ta]] at the [[Shrine of Kulzi]].

==Description==
Now dat we are tryin' to contact all de loa, my mind turns to [[Kulzi]], de loa of medicine--and the madness that surrounds his shrine.

His Loa Speaker, Sij'ta, was a good friend. He healed many war parties of dey injuries. But somethin' happened at Kulzi's shrine, and it is full of angry spirits.

Dey attack anybody dat tries to get through to dem, and de loa is silent.

Perhaps you can finally reach out to de loa and find his Speaker!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What do you mean, you don't have de medicine? I sent you for it ages ago!

We must help him... even if de loa won't!

==Notes==
Head to the [[Shrine of Kulzi]] and meet Loa Speaker Sij'ta who is standing before [[Warlord Akutu]]
