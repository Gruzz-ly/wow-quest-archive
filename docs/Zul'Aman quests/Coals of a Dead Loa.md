*Speak with [[Vun'zarah]]

==Description==
By helpin' de [[Witherbark]], we helped ourselves--and passed [[Halazzi]]'s trial.

There is a lesson in that.

Now dat Halazzi had returned, we should go back and let him know. I hope dis will improve de relationship between our tribes.

And maybe he knows where we can find out how to resurrect [[Jan'alai]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,705 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We have come dis far. We must try to resurrect de dead loa.

==Completion==
"Eccentric loa speaker."

Heh. That sounds familiar. I guess dey are all like dat.

:''The Sheltered Witherbark and [[Loa Speaker Tobui]] departed leaving only [[Lady Liadrin]], Zul'jarra, and Halazzi.''

Go to [[Witherbark Bluffs]] to meet up with Lady Liadrin and Zul'jarra who are speaking to Vun'zarah.
:{{Text|Say|Vun'zarah|De path of de hash'ey? My grandmother told tales of de hash'ey 'round de fire when I was young.}}

Speak with Vun'zarah:
{{dialogue|I can't offer Zul'jarra my soldiers, but I can try to help her with her journey as hash'ey.

{{gossip|Aren't there Witherbark in other areas outside of Zul'Aman?}}
{{dialogue-child|Ages ago, de Amani Empire held all of de lands surroundin' Zul' Aman. These areas were later known to you as de Hinterlands and de Arathi Highlands.

When de Amani tribes fractured and de Witherbark separated, my younger brothers returned to de Hinterlands and de Arathi Highlands and became leaders, hopin' to recover de areas. We are all Witherbark, but have very different identities now--dey even worship other loa.

Some of our cousins in de Hinterlands were driven out of the area not long ago. Some sought violence by joining our sadistic brethren warmongering in the Arathi Highlands. Those who wanted peace returned home to us here in Zul'Aman.}}

{{gossip|quest=|Do you know anything that will help us speak to Jan'alai?}}
