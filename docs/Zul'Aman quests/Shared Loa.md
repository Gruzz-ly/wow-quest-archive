==Objectives==
Speak to Witherbark Chief about Shadra.

==Description==
De Witherbark Chief knows many of us came from the [[Hinterlands]] with our worship of [[Shadra'Alor]], but believed [[Shadra]] was long dead.

We should let him know how [[Halazzi]] helped us to find and restore Shadra, and of Shadra's presence in the Witherbark crypt. He also must learn of de rapport with de Revantusk.

I will stay with Shadra for now, will you carry the message?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,985 [[XP]]

==Completion==
With Shadra aligned with us against the Vilebranch, we will punish them grievously for their evil acts.
