==Description==
<Zul'jarra growls through her gritted tusks.>

Now it not be as surprisin' dat de [[Hex Lord Malacrass|Malacrass]]'s tribe, de [[Vilebranch]], fell to the lure of hex magic.

But dat is their choice and a path dey chose long ago--a path away from us.

won't let dem live long enough to regret it.

What de Vilebranch has done to de Witherbark has gone too long without an Amani response. De mist is not in our way.

We can use it to our advantage.

We will take a life for all de lives dey took. And make sure dey stay dead.

* 16,720 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Zul'jarra spits on the ground.>

Disgusting. Dey deserve to be brought back and killed a hundred times.

I hope de Maw grinds dem with its back teeth.
