==Objectives==
Kill 10 Invading Shadows while traveling deeper into the city of [[Atal'Aman]].
*[[Invading Shadow]] slain (10)

==Description==
The situation here is far worse than I imagined.

The [[Twilight's Blade]] and their leader, Mor'duun, have completely overrun this city.

We will use this opportunity to show the Amani how efficient we are at eliminating forces of the void. Perhaps that will help convince them to stall hostilities between our people... At least until the current threat has passed.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Twilightbreaker's Handwraps]]
* [[Twilightbreaker's Gloves]]
* [[Twilightbreaker's Grips]]
* [[Twilightbreaker's Gauntlets]]

You will also receive: 
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,710 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Zul'jarra has noticed your prowess in battle.

Good.

Let us continue demonstrating our usefulness. If they push us out of their lands now, we'll have no way to keep an eye on the Twilight's Blade until they're flooding through the gates into Eversong.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both '''Goodwill Tour''' from Liadrin & [[Amani Clarion Call]] from [[Zul'jarra]]
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|When de wardrums sound, reinforcements will rally at de center altar, [[Zul'jan|Jan]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|I can help you if you allow it, Zul'jarra. Find me once you have finished your mission, <name>.}}

Slay 10 Invading Shadows that are in Atal'Aman. Head to the [[Altar of Malcrass]] and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|[[Amani'Zar Scout]]|An invader? Guards, protect de elders!}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Let them through. That <class> wears the blood of our enemies.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|De other tribes did not heed our drums. Why?}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Forget them, sister. We have de lightwood. We need no other tribe than our Amani.}}

Liadrin has a gossip:
{{dialogue|This place is where a group of fabled heroes fought [[Hex Lord Malacrass|Malacrass]] twenty years ago. Malacrass was enslaving the loa.

I wonder what the Amani think of that fight. But now is not the time to bring it up.}}
