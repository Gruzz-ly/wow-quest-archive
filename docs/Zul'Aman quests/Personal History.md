==Objectives==
Speak with Torundo the Grizzled in Atal'Aman.

==Description==
With [[Mor'duun]] slain and de [[Twilight's Blade]] routed, my people are returning to [[Atal'Aman]] again.

It should be a moment of great celebration in our new era... but we are not that fortunate.

Seek out Torundo and [[Elder Doru]]. I sent them ahead to support de resettlement. They'll know how best to use your talents.

Prepare yourself, hash'ura. I wouldn't want you to hesitate at de sight of our new foes.

<Zul'jarra appears to suppress a cackle.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,705 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Zul'jarra sent you, hash'ura?

Heh. She must be tired of waiting for us.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Altar of Malacrass]] and meet with Elder Doru & Torundo.
:{{Text|Say|Torundo the Grizzled|First Mor'duun and the Blade ambush the city. Now Atal'Aman is overrun by these echoes...}}
:{{Text|Say|Elder Doru|You complain like an old [[Pango]]. If our past wants to battle, then we show it our tusks.}}

Elder Doru has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|It ain't natural, all dis going on.

Everything I see here and everything I studied from de echoes leads my mind to a truth: The city be cleansing itself.

Within a short few decades, Atal' Aman has been victim to de dark magics of Malacrass, de sickening void power of Mor'duun, and de reconnection with our loa.

Now it's reacting. It's heaving up all de gunk, like a child eating too many sweetberries on de Eve of Fire.

Except we cleaning up battle-starved adventurers instead of children's retchings.}}

So too does Torundo.
{{Dialogue|Doru has some idea about why all de echoes are here. Very particular. Very specific.

But if ya ask what I believe, it's de ancestors giving us a right smack to de head.

We ain't never confronted de truth--We knew there was something wrong with [[Zul'jin]] and [[Malacrass]]' doings back then. Maybe none of us could explain it... but, in de end, ya could feel a darkness following those two.}}
