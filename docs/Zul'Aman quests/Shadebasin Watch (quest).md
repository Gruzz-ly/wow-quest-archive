:{{Text|Say|Akil'zon|Next you must seek Halazzi's blessing. He is hidden, but his speaker can help you find him.}}

:''Zul'jarra and [[Lady Liadrin]] head to the temple ledge.''

Zul'jarra has a gossip,
{{dialogue|In a single moment, all I've come to know is... questionable.

It is a good time to have de journey to focus on.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|You seem... pensive, Zul'jarra. Are you not relieved Akil'zon graced us with her favor?}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|What is dis, elf? Ya become my hash'ura an' ya think ya can ask me personal questions now?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Zul'jarra, I see that something is burdening you. I genuinely want to help.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|If I share my feelings, you gonna tell me how to rid myself of de hot rage and cold shame at what Akil'zon told us?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|About your grandfather, Zul'jin?}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Yes. Dat my grandfather's rage made him betray de loa, try to take their power, and cut us off from our gods!}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Rage is a powerful emotion. My people were once consumed by it as well.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|I was consumed by rage at Zul'jin for what he did and sought retribution against him for years.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Zul'jin, I realized, was the same. He had good reason for his rage. And it festered and controlled him.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Are you saying I should feel sorry for him? Dat he should be pardoned because he had big feelings?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|No. I'm saying there is a lesson to be learned. Let go of your rage at the loa and at Zul'jin. It will lead you off your path.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Hmph. You have again given me good counsel. And perhaps we are more alike than we seem.}}
:''Zul'jarra and Liadrin left.''

Meet them at [[Shadebasin Watch]] where they are speaking with Kul'amara the Fierce
:{{Text|Say|Kul'amara the Fierce|Ya want me to chase dat ghost of a loa when our warriors be disappearin' right an' left?}}

Kul'amara has a gossip:
{{dialogue|You again? And de elf too.

<Kul'Amara looks you up and down mockingly.>

We must be in de big danger if Zul'jarra be paradin' ya around an' not wearin' both ya entrails.

As leader of de Witherbark army. I be keeping an eye on de Vilebranch fro dis watch.

<Kul'amara gestures to the Vilebranch's temporary swamp shanties in the distance.>

{{gossip|We came to speak with Halazzi. How can we find him?}}
{{dialogue-child|Hah! Halazzi? Do ya forget to use your ears, blood elf? We told ya de loa be gone!

Even if dey weren't, no one can get to de Temple of Halazzi right now. De Vilebranch an' de Twilight's Blade have banded together to destroy us.

We be split on two battlefield, and the Vilebranch be attacking my village every night now.

An' on top of that, there be the mists. De Vilebranch an' de Twilight's Blade be using it to obscure Halazz Alor an' de area around de temple.

Many warriors have gone in, an' none have come back out.}}
}}

Lady Liadrin even has one:
{{dialogue|As we travel with Zul'jarra, I find that my assumptions concerning the Amani are being... challenged.

For one, I did not realize each tribe had a distinctive, separate identity with a separate ruling class. And that they are called "Amani" because that was the original tribal name and the name of the ruling tribe.

I also did not know that while they all worship more than one loa, that each tribe has a loa associated with it--Akil'zon for the Amani and Halazzi for the Witherbark.

Or, I guess I am assuming the Shadowpine and the Revantusk are the same. I suppose we will see.}}

Zul'jarra gets a gossip after completion,
{{dialogue|We have to be helping our brothers and sisters, the Witherbark.}}
