==Objectives==
Follow Lady Liadrin into [[Zul'Aman]].
*Pass through the [[Amani Gate]] with [[Lady Liadrin]].

==Description==
<Liadrin lowers her voice, speaking only to you.>

We have two choices. We can either continue to talk to the [[Amani tribe|Amani]] or fight our way inside.

I would still prefer to negotiate passage with [[Zul'jarra]], but if our diplomacy goes awry, be ready.

For now, follow my lead.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,710 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I must say I am... surprised that Zul'jarra allowed us passage. It has been many years since I or anyone from Eversong has stepped foot on this side of the border.

Stay sharp. This is a volatile situation. We may have to do more to engender their trust.

But don't turn your back on the Amani.
