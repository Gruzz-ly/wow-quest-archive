==Description==
[[Nalorakk]] is the loa of war. His trial must be a battle!

There would be no greater death for an [[Amani]] than to die in combat against de Loa of War. No greater thrill than fightin' him.

Does it not make your blood pump faster and harder in your veins, hash'ura?

<Zul'jarra lets out a feral howl and laughs.>

Come. Meet me at [[Nalorakk's Prowl]] and we will sit at his fire and face our last trial--together.

We won against Nalorakk. We passed de last trial.

My tribe will sing songs and tell stories of dis day for generations.

:{{Text|Say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|Watching you go through [[Jan'alai]]'s trial was unsettling. Are you well?}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|I am fine. I feel as if a weight has been lifted from me. But another be takin' its place.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|De last trial is all we have left. Or is it? What makes a hash'ey? Will I be able to help my people?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|I... cannot say. I do not know.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|But spiritual journeys, taken in earnest, are worthwhile whether they result in success or failure.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|I have the Light. Coming to it with a sense of entitlement--that was my mistake.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|But when I came to the Light in my darkest hour with good intentions, the Light was there for me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Your motivations are good. Now, if you could work on your attitude.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Attitude? You don't think Nalorakk will take kindly to me walkin' up and threatenin' him with my axe?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Perhaps. But I do not think he would like to be formally greeted by an uppity, "gokinye" elf either.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Ha ha ha! Thank you, Liadrin. I do not think I would have made it dis far without you. Without both my hash'ura.}}

Speak to Zul'jarra or go to [[Nalorakk's Prowl]] to go to the dungeon.

Complete the dungeon and then turn in.

Upon completion, a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "The Bear Temple View" starts playing:

:''Several more Villagers appear along with a massive figure.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Loa Speaker Nanea|An' now we have his mercy.}}
:''Zul'jarra kneels before the figure as it turns out to be Nalorakk.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nalorakk|And you have my blessing, cub of the Amani,}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Nalorakk|through the ferocity of your hash'ura's loyalty.}}
:''Lady Liadrin stood bravely and the Adventurer bows.''
