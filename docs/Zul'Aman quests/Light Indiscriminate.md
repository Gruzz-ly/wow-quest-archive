Though the dead litter this field, I still see plenty of amani clinging to life.

Help me heal the injured. We'll ensure their reputation for survival continues on after this day.

==Completion==
I look forward to [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]]'s expression when I report back.

<A slight smile creeps across Liadrin's blood-spotted jaw.>

It's bound to be worth more that my inevitable scolding.
