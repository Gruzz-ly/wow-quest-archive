Light the 4 Hash'ey shrines of in Akil'zon's Reach.
* [[Eagle Hash'ey Shrine]] lit (4)
* Finale Eagle Hash'ey Shrine lit

==Description==
[[Loa Speaker Kinduru|My uncle]], de loa speaker, spoke of de hash'ey when I was a child. But when de loa remained silent so many years...

I do not think he would admit it, but he lost a little faith too.

I remember some of his lessons.

A chieftain must light de shrines on de way to the temple. Dey hash'ura must as well. Why? I do not remember.

But if it is de only way to get de loa's favor? Come. Let us get dis out of de way.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting  '''De Ancient Path''', [[Ahead of the Issue]], & [[Gnarldin Bashing]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|The gnarldin are close to destroying the shrines. And the nests of the eagles that roost here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Den we must strike dem down.}}
:''Lady Liadrin and Zul'jarra starts running.''

Across the reach, light 4 shrines by interacting with the [[Ancient Incense]]s and then Meet back up with Liardin & Zul'jarra 

Zul'jarra has a gossip:
{{dialogue|This be the last hash'ey shrine. Now we have to get to the temple.}}

Light up the last shrine.
:{{Text|Say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|Now that the shrines are lit, the eagles are on the move.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|De eagles be flying towards de temple at the top of de mountain. Maybe dat is an invitation.}}

Make sure you turn in three quests.
