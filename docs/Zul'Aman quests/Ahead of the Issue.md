*[[Head of Brulagh the Crusher]]
*[[Head of Cragward Gaahl]]
*[[Head of Pulverizer Helthra]]

==Description==
I do not know de loa Akil'zon, but she cannot be happy with de gnarldin defilin' de hash'ey shrines and makin' meals of her eagle kin.

We gotta let dem know dis is a sacred place and dat we will not take kindly to dey presence here.

I may not know de Akil'zon, but I know giants. All dey understand is strength--de language of Zul' Aman.

Our strongest message we can send is to take de heads of dey fiercest warriors.

You will receive one of:
* [[Brulagh's Torque]]
* [[Gaahl's Gorget]]
* [[Helthra's Fetish]]

You will also receive: 
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 13,365 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Take dey heads. How painful de method be between you and whatever force you worship.

==Completion==
<Zul'jarra takes one of the heads by the hair and admires your handiwork.>

Now we be talking dey language. Now dey know dat de Amani are stronger!

Some may linger, but when we defeat de Twilight's Blade, we will come back for dem.

Keep de heads. I have an idea how dey might be useful later.
