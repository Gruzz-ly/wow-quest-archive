==Objectives==
Rescue 8 [[Witherbark Captive]]s in Numazon.
*Captured Witherbark rescued (8)

==Description==
What [[Kul'amara the Fierce|Kul'Amara]] has told me dat a shadowy mist has fallen over [[Numazon]].

She believes de Vilebranch are behind it, usin' their magic to hide de crimes dey commit against de Witherbark.

She believes dey are hidin' in de Numazon crypts. De hash'ey strines{{Sic}} are near there as well.

We must find our way to Numazon and rescue Witherbark captives. If we find de hash'ey shrines along de way, so be it.

If [[Halazzi]] will not stand with us, den maybe de Witherbark will.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,365 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So that's why the Vilebranch wanted de Witherbark--to please de Twilight's Blade by givin' dem more soldiers.

Undead soldiers. Obedient soldiers.

And we have already lost too many.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both [[The Crypt in the Mist]] & '''Rescue from the Shadows'''
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|We'll get ya warriors back an' find de way to de Temple of Halazzi.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Kul'amara the Fierce]]|Beware de mist, Zul'jarra. It be unnatural, an' we suspect de Vilebranch hidin' their dark deeds with it.}}

Go to the entrance of Numazon Crypt as [[Lady Liadrin]] and [[Zul'jarra]] are preparing for an assault.
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|De Amani have been ignorin' de Witherbark's calls for help for too long. That ends now.}}

Inside the Crypt, rescue the [[Captured Witherbark Lynx]] and the [[Captured Witherbark]].

Go outside Numazon and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|While in de crypt, I noticed de Vilebranch were blinded by de mist too. Hmm.}}
