==Objectives==
Collect 15 Raider Ash Remains.
*[[Raider Ash Remains]] (15)

==Description==
Endless. An endless stream of these raiders be flooding our sacred [[Atal'Aman]].

What [[Elder Doru|Doru]] calls "echoes" I see simply as ghosts of a bloodier time. And similar to those days, no matter how many we cut through, they never stop swarming in.

Get out there and see for ya self. Bring back any of de echoes' remains, so Doru can study how their spirits might work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,695 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It be like a dream ya can't wake from.

==Completion==
See? Endless.

Perhaps Doru will learn something from de ashes.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Swords to Plowshares''' from Torundo the Grizzled & [[Shrine, Sealed, Delivered]] from Elder Doru,
:{{Text|Say|Torundo the Grizzled|Stay vigilant, <name>. These echoes are weak, but they'll swarm you if you aren't careful.}}

Slay the echoes of the [[Raiding Caster]]s, [[Raiding Rogue]]s, [[Raiding Warrior]]s, [[Budd Nedreck]], [[Harrison Jones]], [[Prigmon]], and [[Zungam]] and collect the ashes.

Return to the [[Altar of Malacrass]] to turn in both quests.
