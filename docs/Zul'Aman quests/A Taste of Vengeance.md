==Objectives==
Assist [[Loa Speaker Kinduru|Elder Kinduru]] with the death rites.
*Use [[Kinduru's Mortar]] to grind Bog Herbs
*Pour Death Rites Mixture into the fires (3)

==Description==
[[Zul'jan]] has taken de troops without my orders--again!

And de number of casualties... for what? For wood?

I want to take his tusks and...

<Zul'jarra growls but seems to center herself.>

Kinduru will need help with de soldiers' death rites. Help him prepare de herb mixture and pour it onto de fires.

My brother and I need to... talk.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,530 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I love my brother. We are as de day is to de night. But even so, as children we were close.

Zul'jan is smart but he doesn't understand. A victory means nothin' if there is no one left to celebrate it.

He is supposed to be my right hand--not a pain in de neck.

I hope I have not left Zul'jan without guidance too long to turn him around.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Sister, you return! While you were prostrating yourself before de loa, I secured real power!}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|And how many warriors did you sacrifice to take this lightwood back from de [[Twilight's Blade|cult]]?}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Sacrifice? They are heroes. Heroes that fell as true Amani, reclaiming de lightwood at Atal'Aman.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|And they are dead just de same, Jan!}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Warriors, ya are relived. Go be with ya families. We will care for de dead.}}
:''The Might of Zul departs.''
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|An' I swear if ya do somethin' stupid while I go to Nalorakk, I'll cut off ya head myself.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Zul'jan scowls at Zul'jarra.}}
:''Zul'jan departs.''

Kinduru has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Use the mortar beside me to grind the bog herbs with the death ashes.

Then pour the mixture into the fire, so that it may spread to the fallen.}}

Interact with [[Kinduru's Mortar]] to grind the Bog Herbs and pour them onto the fire.
