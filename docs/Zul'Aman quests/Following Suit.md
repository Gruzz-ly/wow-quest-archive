{{Dialogue|<King Mrgl-Mrgl drops his voice to a whisper.>

If we can somehow stop the Deepfin Incursion, these murlocs should return to their begrudgingly peaceful coexistence with the trolls.

Speak with her,
{{Dialogue|Thank the [[Earthmother]]! Do you know where King Mrgl-Mrgl is?

We were hiding in a small ruin observing the native murlocs but when I went to spy on the Deepfin murlocs, I was discovered and chased away!

When I returned to our camp. King Mrgl-Mrgl was gone, and the invading murlocs had swarmed the area!

I eventually had to hide here for my own safety. Do you know where he went? Did he get captured?

{{Gossip|quest=|King Mrgl-Mrgl is safe at the top of the temple.}}

{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I am King Mrgl-Mrgl's assistant! You can call me Grgl-Grgl.

Because of my interest in murlocs. I was assigned to assist King Mrgl-Mrgl in his research. This is actually my first assignment!

Of course in order to remain incognito, I have to wear a murloc costume as well. You can imagine how difficult it is for a tauren to fit into one of these I can barely zip it up all the way!}}
