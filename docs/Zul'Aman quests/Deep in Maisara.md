==Objectives==
Recover the Shell of Shadra from within [[Maisara Caverns]].
*[[Shell of Shadra (Midnight)|Shell of Shadra]]

==Description==
Shadra has asked that we recover the third piece of Mixer Jamanga's ritual, de Shell of Shadra. With it, maybe we bring her back.

She recognized both Witherbark and Revantusk as her allies. I felt her approval upon all of us. I believe this be the right choice.

Halazzi set us on dis path, and we each got our roles to see it through. Gather yer allies, and go into Maisara Caverns! I would expect one of dey leaders to hold de shell. Kill them and take it back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|96|60}}}
* 27,665 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I think dat Shadra will honor her word.

==Completion==
I can't imagine that was easy. Halazzi must have blessed your hunt.

==Notes==
Upon accept,

:{{Text|Emote|Nija Torntusk doesn't answer, but a smile twists across her lips.}}

Head to [[Maisara Caverns]] and then slay [[Vordaza]] and loot the Shell of Shadra from her.

Upon completion,
