==Objectives==
Speak with Zul'jarra in [[Amani'Zar Village]].
*Talk to Zul'jarra at [[Amani'Zar Village]].

==Description==
[[Mor'duun]] is slain.

De [[Twilight's Blade]] will continue to plague our lands, but of dem only [[Mor'duun]]'s "fodder" is left. Dey will be easy prey for us.

And now I will say somethin' my uncle would be proud of. Let us follow de teachin' of [[Nalorakk]], de loa of war.

De battle is over. It is time to rest--I can tell by your eyes both my hash'ura need It too.

Let us leave dis place. We can speak again back in Amani'Zar.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,705 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It did not occur to me dat what we would be celebratin' would be... me.

There has been no hash'ey among de Amani since before de elf and human war thousands of years ago.

It is a great honor, but one I am not sure I have yet earned.

I will strive to live up to it.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|The end. Finally.}}
:''Zul'jarra turns and walk towards near the stairs.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|The battlefield is quiet. Your warriors must have finished off the remaining Twilight's Blade.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Zul'jan]]|Lightwood. Loa. Outsiders... Even combined, an ocean of Amani blood paid for our victory.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|We will mourn their loss. But now we should celebrate what dey have given us.}}

Go to the Amani'Zar Village and meet up with Zul'jarra, Liadrin, and Zul'jan, who are with everyone. Speak with Zul'jarra:
{{dialogue|There are so many Amani here--of all de tribes.

It has been so long since I have seen us gathered dis way.

Hash'ura, dis looks more like a celebration than a time for rest. I guess it be fittin' dat we celebrate Mor'duun's defeat.

<Zul'jarra grins mischeviously{{sic}}.>

Are your{{sic}} ready to party like an Amani?

{{gossip|quest=|{{Text|Blue|(Play Movie)}}  <Start the celebration.>}}

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "The Priestess has arisen" starts playing:
:''Zul'jarra walks through the Amani village, awed residents watching from afar as the [[Akil'zon]] swoops above the village as Zul'jarra looks at Akil'zon flying towards the alter. She, Lady Liadrin, the Adventurer, and the Amani villagers walk across the bridge as [[Jan'alai]] flew through them which transitions to Zul'jarra being greeted by [[Loa Speaker Kinduru]] who saluted her and she looks at [[Halazzi]] who looks at Zul'jarra as he walks as Jan'alai flies above him. Zul'jarra then turns her look towards [[Nalorakk]] who Halazzi walked to the position next to Nalorakk.''
