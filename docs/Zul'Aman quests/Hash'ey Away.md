:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|Zul'jarra! Your brother refused to wait. He took de warriors and he's gonna get dem killed!}}

Speak with Zul'jarra.
{{dialogue|I should have known [[Zul'jan]] would do this.

A lynx never change its spots, a snake its scales...

But he is my brother, an' I thought he would learn...

If only he had listened to me just this once! If he'd only seen dat victory don't matter if there be no one left to celebrate it!

De path of de hash'ey was meaningless. Even with de loa's blessin', we we could not win against de Twilight's Blade. An' even if we did... for what? Ah! I could kill him a thousand times!
