:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|I am glad to gain Halazzi's favor, but bein' here brings me shame.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Why? We rescued the Witherbark. You found the hash'ey shrines. And you are now closer to becoming hash'ey.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|De Witherbark needed my help. And I did not listen. I was too worried about my own people.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Luckily, Halazzi could not help but meddle in Witherbark affairs despite what your grandfather had done.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|He would not let them die. If it came to it, I feel Akil'zon would not have let us die as well.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|It sounds like your faith in the loa is strengthening.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Maybe. Akil'zon tested my conviction. An' Halazzi forced me to use my head an' not my fist.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|I only wish I had learned these lessons before and been a better leader.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|You had scant resources. I cannot say I would not have protected my home over others threatened with violence.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|I have been in your situation. And like your grandfather, I wanted power and took it without caring who I hurt.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|I am proud to see you not making the mistakes that I or your grandfather made, and that I am part of your journey.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Proud? Of me? Hmph. I would like to say ya words mean nothin'.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|But as you are one of my hash'ura, I... thank you for your words.}}
