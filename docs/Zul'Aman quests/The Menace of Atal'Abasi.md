Find and slay Mrruk the Musclefin in [[Atal'Abasi]].
* [[Mrruk the Musclefin]] slain

==Description==
Our boat didn't ground on its own.

We were fightin' de [[murloc]]s, and then suddenly we were in de air.

Dats when I saw him--one dat wasn't like de rest. Bigger. Stronger. When he attacked, de other murlocs scattered.

He picked up our boat like it weighed nothin' and hurled it on de rocks. I've never seen a murloc do somethin' like that.

We're gonna keep losin' people and supplies if dat muscle-bound murloc be watchin' de river.
