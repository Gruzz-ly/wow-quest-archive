==Objectives==
Defeat the Vilebranch leading the attack on Shadra's children and recover the Eye of Shadra.
*[[Eye of Shadra (quest item)]]

==Description==
Give me a chance to explain.

I concealed my knowledge of [[Shadra]] before because so many people assume she is an evil force, but she is only merciless to her enemies. When the Witherbark left the [[Hinterlands]], we had to leave our temple of [[Shadra'Alor]]. I brought two of her relics with me--the eye and the fang.

Dese Vilebranch stole the fang. Dey are in the area where I hid the Shadra's Eye. collecting venom! Please kill the Vilebranch trespassing in the crypt. We can't let dem find de eye.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,860 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can understand why they would harvest spider venom, but targeting the artifacts?

==Completion==
They must mean to weaken us and our ability to commune with Shadra.

==Notes==
Upon accept, 
:{{Text|Say|[[Nija Torntusk]]|You knew Shadra was here all along!}}
:{{Text|Say|Mixer Jamanga|Yes, we brought two of her relics with us. We hoped she would return. But the Vilebranch are trying to use her and her children against us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Mixer Jamanga|I didn't even realize de fang was gone! I was embarrassed to tell ya when you showed me de fang.}}
:{{Text|Say|Mixer Jamanga|But I rushed over here right away to check on de eye, and found all dis!}}

Head to the lower level of the crypt and confront [[Venomhexxer Iki]],
:{{Text|Say|Venomhexxer Iki|Keep collecting the venom. I'll deal with pest myself.}}

Upon slaying Iki,
:{{Text|Say|Venomhexxer Iki|You won't get Shadra back, fools.}}

Take the eye and bring it to Mixer Jamanga.
