{{Questportrait|Voice of Nalorakk.png|Voice of Nalorakk|The false "Voice of Nalorakk" has a deep hold over the Spiritpaw furbolg.}}
Kill the false Voice of Nalorakk.
*Fake [[Voice of Nalorakk]] slain

==Description==
That was scary, we nearly lost [[Furgh]]! And he doesn't look so good.

<Fleeg is trembling with worry over his friend.>

Furgh said he heard the Voice of Nalorakk talking to him after touching the treasures. Destroy the evil that pretends to be our most mighty loa!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,860 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
It was a Twilight's Blade monster!

I hope Furgh and the others will be okay now.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Fleeg|I'll make sure Furgh doesn't go wandering off. Please hurry.}}

Go to the Voice of Nalorakk's cave and confront the imposter.
:{{Text|Say|Voice of Nalorakk|I speak for the loa of war. My voice is Nalorakk's. The furbolg are mine!}}

Upon depleting the imposter's health to 75%, it sheds its disguise revealing to be a void creature.
:{{Text|Say|Voice of Nalorakk|The furbolg are too far gone. They destroy each other. You stop nothing!}}

Upon slaying Groffa
:{{Text|Say|Voice of Nalorakk|Nalorakk is nothing to the Twilight's Blade...}}

Return to the Furbolg duo and turn in.
:{{Text|Say|Fleeg|Furgh is not looking good.}}
:''Fleeg begins a spell.''
:{{Text|Say|Fleeg|Nalorakk, mighty loa. <name> has destroyed your false voice. Please help me to cleanse Furgh!}}
:''Furgh gets cured and [[Nalorakk]] appears as an image''
:{{Text|Say|Fleeg|Nalorakk!}}
:{{Text|Emote|Furgh gasps in surprise.}}
:{{Text|Say|Nalorakk|You have learned well. Do not listen to any voice. Use your wisdom to lead your people to recovery.}}
:{{Text|Say|Fleeg|We will, Nalorakk!}}
:{{Text|Say|Furgh|I feel much better.}}
:{{Text|Say|Fleeg|Thank you for helping us, <name>. We must get back to the others. They will need guidance!}}
:''The Furblog duo departed.''
