==Objectives==
Don the Spare Murloc Suit and offer tribute at the underwater shrine to draw out and slay the leader of the Deepfin murlocs.
*Spare Murloc Suit worn (Optional)
*Tribute offered (Optional)
*[[Lightwalker|Deepfin leader]] slain
*[[Spare Murloc Suit]] (provided)

==Description==
I've observed the Deepfin kidnapping native murlocs and raising troll corpses as undead thralls. But they don't push further inland--they take them all back to the sea.

I think they're being led by a powerful murloc, who remains safely offshore. hiding from view as it accepts its minions' tribute.

We can draw it out. If you put on this murloc suit and offer tribute, it might fool the leader into showing itself.

If we eliminate the leader, we might be able to save the native murlocs!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
The leader was a [[kobyss]]? What is a kobyss?!

I mean... well done hero! You have served your loa well!

Now that these murlocs are safe, it is time for us to be going!

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Assistant Grgl-Grgl|Be mindful of how long you can hold your breath underwater. Don't drown!}}
:{{Text|Say|King Mrgl-Mrgl|I send my champion to slay the Loa of the Deep! We will be victorious!}}

Head underwater and confront Lightwalker, or use the spare murloc suit and offer the tribute to summon Lightwalker.
:{{Text|Say|Lightwalker|We rise...}}

Upon slaying Lightwalker,
:{{Text|Say|Lightwalker|Vengeance... comes...}}

Return to the Altar with [[King Mrgl-Mrgl]]
:{{Text|Say|King Mrgl-Mrgl|The hero returns... victorious, yes? Please say yes. I am tired of standing here.}}

Assistant Grgl-Grgl has a new gossip:
{{Dialogue|The leader was a kobyss? Fascinating...

I was under the impression that the kobyss kept to the darkness and hated the light. What was this one doing so close to the surface?

And it seems to have taught the murlocs under its command to use necromantic magic. We've never heard of this kind of behavior before.

Was this just a unique incident? Or are the kobyss planning something more sinister?

<You believe Assistant Grgl-Grgl is staring off into the distance, lost in thought, but it's impossible to tell as the murloc suit's eyes don't move.>}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|King Mrgl-Mrgl|Triumphant hero! You have slain the Deepfin loa, proving that I. King Mrgl-Mrgl, am the true loa of murlocs!}}
:{{Text|Say|King Mrgl-Mrgl|Now that this threat has been dealt with, I must or leave you, my children! Go forth and reclaim your land!}}
:''The [[Murloc Worshipper]]s leap to King Mrgl-Mrgl. The latter walks back.''
:{{Text|Say|King Mrgl-Mrgl|Or... or not! I think I can spare a few more days to stay here with you...}}
:{{Text|Say|Assistant Grgl-Grgl|Hrm... I wonder... a kobyss...}}

King Mrgl-Mrgl has a new gossip after completion,
{{Dialogue|<King Mrgl-Mrgl drops his voice to a whisper.>

It seems I will be trapped here for a while. But how long will I be able to keep up this ruse? I can't stay here forever or I'll starve!

At some point they will realize I am vegetarian. What if they realize that I'm not a murloc? Or... try to imitate me.

A murloc's diet is mostly meat. It would be disastrous for their health.

<King Mrgl-Mrgl sounds concerned but the murloc suit he is wearing does not betray any emotion and stares at you with eyes that go off in two unrelated directions.>

Well, I can still use this opportunity to study the murlocs up close. Perhaps I can offer them guidance... and convince them I must leave to help other tribes as the Loa of Murlocs!}}

==Progression==
{{Loa of Murlocs}}
