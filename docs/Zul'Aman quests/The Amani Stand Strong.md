==Objectives==
Give 8 Lightwood Weapons to Demoralized Defenders.
* [[Demoralized Defender]] armed (8)
* [[Lightwood Weapon]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Zul'jarra]] doesn't think de lightwood is worth de risks I am taking. We will prove her wrong.

I have seen too many warriors discouraged because their weapons don't work against de [[Twilight's Blade]].

Don't just tell dem to retreat. Give them de lightwood weapons.

Nothing stirs Amani blood like an effective axe in their hands. Let dem fight their way back to de [[Altar of Malacrass]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,710 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
De troops we armed have killed a great many Twilight's Blade.

Some survived and made their way here.

We lost a few, but I think de sacrifice was worth it.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting '''The Amani Stand Strong''' from Zul'jan, [[Twilight Bled]] from [[Zul'jarra]], & [[Rituals Cut Short]] from [[Lady Liadrin]]
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Lightwood or no, our people need rescuing, Jan. Take de elf and look for survivors.}}
:''Zul'jan mounts up.''
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Fine. <Class>, take de weapons. Arm any Amani you find.}}
:''Zul'jan departs and Zul'jarra and Liadrin mounted up to follow him.''

Across [[Firewing Terrace]], give the 8 Demoralized Defenders their lightwood weapons 

Go to the [[Altar of Malacrass]] and regroup with the party who are with [[Torundo the Grizzled]],
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Torundo, hold here until Zul'jan fires, den leave with de survivors in de confusion.}}
:{{Text|Say|Torundo the Grizzled|We will fly on de winds of Akil'zon--like in de olden days.}}

Each of the party has a gossip after completion,
{{dialogue|title=Lady Liadrin|Zul'jarra intends to engage Mor'duun directly. I intend to go with her.

Fire the bolts carefully... don't miss!}}

{{dialogue|title=Zul'jarra|Ballista is good, b but my axe to Mor'duun's skull is an even better distraction.

My people are ready to get out ter safety.}}

{{dialogue|title=Torundo the Grizzled|We have enough bolts to strike Mor'duun's shield a few times.

{{gossip|Where are the children that you were protecting?}}
{{dialogue-child|Dey are okay. Dey hidin' close by.

When I see an opportunity. I'll get em out.}}
