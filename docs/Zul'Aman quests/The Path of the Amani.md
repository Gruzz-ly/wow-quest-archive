;Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|Light de shrines on your way to de temple. And don't forget to leave [[Akil'zon]] an offerin'!}}

:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|De temple be overrun with [[gnarldin]]. Killin' dem will help us pass de time on de way. Come, "hash'ura."}}

Speak with Kinduru who has a {{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} option.

:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Uncle, de loa haven't spoken to you in years. Why you think dey will speak to us now?}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|You did not know de world with de loa in it, my child. Dey were our strength. Our hope.}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|Akil'zon bestowed on me a great honor when she made me her speaker.}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|I tried to instill in de both of you--you and Zul'jan--a love for de loa.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|I remember de stories about Akil'zon, Halazzi, Jan'alai, and Nalorakk, and how dey protected us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|I loved listenin' to your stories, uncle. But even then I wondered if they be true.}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|How much do you remember about goin' to Akil'zon's temple?}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|We climbed to de temple. Zul'jan fell. I did not get de loa's blessin'. And my mother died.}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|You saved your brother. And you defended your right to lead as Zul'jin's granddaughter--all on your own.}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|If anyone can go to de loa and get answers, it is you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|As de "hashey?" I'm no priestess. No mystic or uniter.}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|No, my Jarra. As my niece. Because I know you have de fire. And I love you more than anythin'.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Den I will go. For our people and for you, uncle.}}

Go to [[Akil'zon's Reach]] and meet up with Zul'jarra and Liadrin.
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|De Twilight's Blade pushed de gnarldin into our territory. We will have to fight through dem to de temple.}}

Lady Liadrin has a gossip:
{{dialogue|The Twilight's Blade have caused such disruption that even the gnarldin are forced from their territory. There's far too much for the Amani to handle all on their own.

I hope that Zul'jarra is as strong as she appears to be.}}

So too does Zul'jarra after completion:
{{dialogue|Gnarldin be giants that normally dwell in the forest caves to the north. It'd be better for them if they stayed.

Now they be in my way and we don't be having much time, so they got to go.}}
