==Objectives==
Follow Mixer Jamanga's ritual to restore [[Shadra]].
*Shadra Ritual completed
*[[Egg of Shadra]] hatched

==Description==
It is time to bring Shadra to her proper place as a loa of the Witherbark and Revantusk. She will be small at first, but one day could be great like [[Halazzi]] and [[Nalorakk]]!

Even a small loa will be a good ally against the Vilebranch venoms. She is the loa of spies, and will block their thievery of our people and relics.

Hold the Shell of Shadra in the center of the room, and we will call de loa to us!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This journey has been... eye-opening.

Had you asked me at the start if we would be allies with Shadra, I would have laughed in your face!

==Notes==
Upon accept,

:{{Text|Yell|Mixer Jamanga|Return to your loyal Witherbark and Revantusk!}}
:''The egg appears''
:{{Text|Say|Mixer Jamanga|An egg has formed!}}
:{{Text|Say|Mixer Jamanga|Carefully assist it in hatching.}}

Hatch the egg of Shadra and Shadra has returned to the realm of the living.
:{{Text|Yell|Shadra|I am reborn!}}
:''Shadra walks up to Jamanga''
:{{Text|Say|Mixer Jamanga|Shadra. The Witherbark are honored to have you back among us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Nija Torntusk|De Revantusk be ready to work together against de common enemies.}}
:''Halazzi appears.''
:{{Text|Say|Shadra|There's lots to do. Perhaps I shall have two Loa Speakers!}}
:''Shadra turns and walks towards Halazzi.''
:{{Text|Say|Shadra|Vengeance on the foul Vilebranch will be the first task.}}
:{{Text|Say|Halazzi|Already your webs spin! I expected no less. Welcome to Zul'Aman, Shadra.}}
:{{Text|Say|Shadra|They will never see us coming, Halazzi. This will be fun.}}
:''Shadra walks and leaps up at the altar.''

Shadra has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|It is time to expand my following.

I shall have both the Witherbark and Revantusk. They will do nicely.

{{Gossip|What do you think of Halazzi?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Halazzi one of the most powerful loa that exist.

I would be a fool to make an enemy of such power. Together we will be formidable indeed!

{{Gossip|Very formidable.}}
}}
}}

So too does Halazzi,
{{Dialogue|Your hunt has concluded.

{{Gossip|What do you think of Shadra?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Shadra is a loa well known to me. She cared for the Witherbark of the [[Hinterlands]] until her own death, augmenting their weapons and granting knowledge through her children's many eyes. Unfortunately, she is often exploited by mortals, which has made her more aggressive. While she aids my people against the Vilebranch, she is welcome here.

The spider loa may be tiny today, but she will grow rapidly. I will keep an eye on her. She has had a hard time working alone, and has suffered a lot of mistreatment. I'll direct her energy in a positive direction.

Especially Mixer Jamanga,
{{Dialogue|Not to worry, I will be gettin' Shadra's strength up in no time.}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|Nija Torntusk|I'm glad we could come together.}}
:{{Text|Say|Mixer Jamanga|Ah! We need to tell de [[Vun'zarah|Chief]]!}}

Nija Torntusk gets a gossip after completion,
{{Dialogue|I trust Halazzi.

Shadra may take some time, but I will guide the Revantusk in this with all I have seen here.}}
