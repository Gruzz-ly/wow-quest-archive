==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Groffa the Guzzler.png|Groffa the Guzzler|The leader of the Spiritpaw no longer looks out for their for their best interests.}}
Stop the Chief and recover what he's hoarding.
*[[Groffa the Guzzler]] slain
*[[Groffa's Treasures]]

==Description==
We gotta be brave to resist the Chief. We haven't been so brave and this got really bad.

If Chief Groffa is leading the tribe into the dark, he needs to be stopped. I think he's got trinkets in his stash, far more than he's given to the tribe. Stop him and find out what he's hiding!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,860 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What was he hoarding?

==Completion==
The bag feels... tempting. I don't like it!

Good he kept this away from others, but also very bad for him.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Furgh|Our chief is too far gone.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Fleeg]]|He's always been greedy, though.}}

Go to Groffa the Guzzler and confront him.
:{{Text|Say|Groffa the Guzzler|The treasures from [[Nalorakk]] are MINE!}}

Upon slaying Groffa
:{{Text|Say|Groffa the Guzzler|Why didn't Nalorakk... protect me?}}

Head to [[Groffa's Hoard]] behind him and open it and take Groffa's Treasures.

Return to the Furbolg duo and turn in both quests.

==Progression==
{{The Voice of Nalorakk}}
