==Objectives==
Find the Spiritpaw furbolg that wanted to speak to [[Lilaju]].

==Description==
We just chased away some furbolg dat were arguing with each other and trying to wave at Lilaju. Normally dey are hostile, so we ran dem off, but Lilaju wants to see what dey wanted.

Our scouts saw dem follow the river east to de north side of the lake. Investigate, would you?

If it's a trick, kill dem.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,705 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We wanted to talk about the [[Twilight's Blade|shadow cultists]]. We know they attacked the trolls.

A strange loa speaker has appeared, and it doesn't seem like [[Nalorakk]] to us.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Pel'na Torntusk|De furbolg village is near. It could be an ambush. Be wary!}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilaju|The two furbolg seemed like they needed help, to me.}}
