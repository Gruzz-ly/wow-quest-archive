==Objectives==
Slay 15 Deepfin murlocs at [[Atal'Abasi]].
*[[Deepfin]] [[murloc]]s slain (15)

==Description==
These murlocs have come to me, the Loa of Murlocs, to seek my protection against an evil invader.

The Deepfin have risen from the abyssal depths of the ocean. They have invaded this land and defiled its grounds!

I charge you, champion, to defend this kingdom and drive the Deepfin back into the sea!

<King Mrgl-Mrgl lowers his voice to a whisper.>

Get rid of the invaders and maybe the natives won't need me to protect them, and I can leave!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Are you finished?

<King Mrgl-Mrgl clears his throat when he sees one of his "followers" eyeing him suspiciously.>

I mean, it is finished. The Deepfin shall trouble us no more!

==Notes==
;Upon accepting '''Murloc Madness''', [[Fish Are Food, Not Friends]], & [[Following Suit]]
:{{Text|Say|King Mrgl-Mrgl|Witness my champion, whom I have granted my blessing, go forth to do battle on your behalf!}}

King Mrgl-Mrgl gets a new gossip.
{{Dialogue|<King Mrgl-Mrgl drops his voice to a whisper.>

If we can somehow stop the Deepfin Incursion, these murlocs should return to their begrudgingly peaceful coexistence with the trolls.

And then the "Loa of Murlocs" won't be needed to protect them, and we can leave!}}

Around [[Atal'Abasi]] slay the [[Deepfin Snatcher]]s, [[Deepfin Invader]]s, and [[Deepfin Necromancer]]s.

;Return to the altar
