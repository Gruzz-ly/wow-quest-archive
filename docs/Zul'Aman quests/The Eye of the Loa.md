==Objectives==
Find evidence of [[Shadra]] in the [[Witherbark Bluffs]] with Halazzi's aid.
*[[Halazzi]]'s aid requested
*[[Spying Spiderling|Spider]]s scared away (20)

==Description==
I lost friends to venoms made from Shadra's spiders in the Hinterlands. I gotta know if Shadra's lurkin' around here, twistin' the minds of these Witherbark. I won't bring any Revantusk here until I am sure they will be safe.

Maybe I seem paranoid, but you have Halazzi's ear. You could ask him to reveal to you any hidden spiders, couldn't ya?

There is a shrine behind me. Stand in front of it and see if he'll grant you a boon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,860 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Why did the spiders hide and flee?

Halazzi has set us on this hunt. We need to continue.

==Notes==
