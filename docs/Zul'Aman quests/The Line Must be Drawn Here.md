==Objectives==
Speak to Zul'jan and diffuse the situation.
*Speak to [[Zul'jan]]
*Calm the situation
*Kill [[Void Beast]]

==Description==
I had hoped that Zul'jan would leave the lightwood and return swiftly to his lands after our confrontation with him.

But dealing with the Amani has never been a simple matter.

Diplomacy is the only way to avoid more bloodshed, but Zul'jan is finished listening to me.

Perhaps he will listen to you?

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,710 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I find myself relieved to discover Zul'jan is not the leader of the Amani.

But this "[[Zul'jarra]]" might be worse.

No matter. We must get on the other side of that gate and assess the [[Twilight Blade]]'s threat to [[Eversong Woods|Eversong]].

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|There is no need for further bloodshed. Cease your raids, surrender the lightwood, and return to your lands.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Our lands? This was all once "our lands." And everything on it!}}

Speak with Zul'jan:
{{dialogue|De blood elves live on lands they stole from us.

You do not understand. By right de lightwood is ours. We need it!

{{gossip|quest=|Return to Zul' Aman.}}

:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Ya will take de lightwood over my grave, gokinye. Lightwood weapons are--}}
:''Zul'jan was interrupted as a void rift opens.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Mor'duun]]|Destroy the Amani! Break them! Sow chaos for the glory of [[Xal'atath]]!}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|A void beast! Look out!}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Warriors, attack!}}

Upon slaying the Void Beast, a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Zul'Aman-  Zul'jarra's intro" starts playing:
:''The Void Beast stares at Zul'jan but suddenly a roar was heard. The void beast looks up at a figure named [[Zul'jarra]].''
:''Zul'jarra leaps from the high platform, and charges to the Void beast, finishing off the void creature.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jan|Ah! Sister!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jarra|Sister? Did you forget I'm de leader of Zul'Aman?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jarra|Is that why you did not listen to me?}}
:''Zul'jarra turn her gaze at Lady Liadrin and growls walking towards her. Lady Liadrin raises her arm stopping her.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lady Liadrin|Hold. We are not here to fight.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jarra|Then why you be here?}}
:''Zul'jarra lifts her axe from her shoulder in her her left hand.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jarra|Tell me quickly. Before I slice your head from your neck, elf.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, the Blood Elves & the Amani battled the Twilight monstrosities.

Zul'jarra has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Keep your weapons where I can see them.}}

So too does Zul'jan:
{{dialogue|You dare speak to me? I should cut out your tongue.}}
