==Objectives==
Collect 8 Venomous Horns from the Horned Frogs.
*[[Venomous Horn]] (8)

==Description==
[[Halazzi]] says that the Vilebranch have made a new venom that para...parliz--makes it's victims not move--so they can drag them off to be sacrificed. He says frog venom.

I said that doesn't make sense, frogs are poison, right? Halazzi said frogs are normally poisonous, not venomous. But these have sharp horn bits on them, maybe they have venom! I didn't know frogs could have venom, did you?

Let's find out if these do. Then the Witherbark can make an anti-venom!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,705 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Halazzi says venomous is when they bite or stab you, and poisonous is when you bite or eat them! Isn't that interesting?

==Completion==
Look at all the samples you found. The chief will know who can make anti-venom, for sure.

==Notes==
Make sure you accept [[A Most Vile Venom]] as well.

Halazzi has a gossip
{{Dialogue|The Vilebranch continue to assault my lynxes and the Witherbark.

{{Gossip|Does this have something to do with [[Shadra]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|That is what we will discover. A hunt can be a long path.}}
}}

So too does [[Sakaja]],
{{Dialogue|We were traveling on the road from the village and were ambushed by [[Venomhexxer Raxxis|someone]] unseen in the forest. I heard a voice rambling about testing a new venom.

Immediately [[Daki]] was hit with something and could barely walk. I dragged him here as quickly as I could!}}

Slay the [[Horned Frog]]s and collect their Venomous Horns.
