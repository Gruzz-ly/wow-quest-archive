==Objectives==
Extinguish fires on the Lightwood Piles at [[Ragemaw Terrace]].
*Lightwood fires extinguished
*Huge Lightwood Pike extinguished

==Description==
My blood is boiling! While waiting for [[Kinduru]], de [[Twilight's Blade]] was destroying what little stores of [[lightwood]] we had left at Ragemaw Terrace!

But if we act quickly, we can save enough to arm de lightwood [[ballista]]--and take a shot at [[Mor'duun]].

And without de ballista, we cannot claim victory!

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,710 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
We lost so much of it...

We could have blacked out de sky with ballista bolts!

But dis still may be enough. It will have to be!

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both [[Armed by Light]] and '''Everything We Worked For'''
:{{Text|Say|Zul'Jan|I swear to de ancestors I will throw ya over my shoulder and carry ya if ya don't leave now.}}
:{{Text|Say|Loa Speaker Kinduru|Hah! That's what I used to tell you when you were a child!}}
:{{Text|Emote|Zul'jan groans with frustration.}}
:''Kinduru and Zul'jan depart.''

Extinguish the 4 [[Lightwood Pile]]s at the [[Ragemaw Terrace]] and then go to Zul'jan who is dealing with a huge Lightwood pile.
:{{Text|Say|Zul'Jan|Gokinye! Help me put this fire out--now!}}

Upon extinguishing the Huge Lightwood Pile,
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|You and you--take what's left of de ballista bolts to de altar.}}
:''The Amani Civilians take the large pile and [[Lady Liadrin]] and [[Zul'jarra]] appeared.''
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Do you see, <class>? De cult burns de lightwood because they fear its power.}}

Zul'jan has a gossip:
{{dialogue|We may have lost some lightwood, but we'll show 'em.}}
