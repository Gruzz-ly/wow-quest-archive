Seek out [[Zul'jan]] upon the [[Skybridge]].
*Stay awhile and listen (Optional)
*Check on Zul'jan

==Description==
I make one last request of you before you return with Liadrin to Silvermoon. hash'ura.

Find Zul'jan. None have seen him since returnin' to Amani'Zar.

On de way back here, I confronted him about takin' our soldiers to de Broken Throne against my orders.

People died dat shouldn't have again. I asked him what he don't understand about dat.

He didn't argue. He was blank. His body was there, but his mind?

Sometimes he seeks peace in de sound of ocean waves.

You might find him on de Skybridge.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,705 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Glad I found you. Zul'jarra let me know you would be searching this area for Zul'jan, but this land is still so unfamiliar to me.

If you have found him and are finished enjoying the party, we should return to Silvermoon.

==Notes==

Walk to the Skybridge where Zul'jan is sitting at the edge.
{{dialogue|Those ruins be ours, gokinye.

We may seem few now, but once upon a time, our kingdom was larger den any dat exists today.

You see those ruins? We called those ruins home.

{{gossip|quest=|Are you okay. Zul'jan?}}
{{dialogue-child|Heh. That is too simple a question.

I assume my sister asked you to find me. She knows me well. Sometime I wish she didn't.

Tell Zul'jarra that her failure of a little brother is fine, gokinye--No, <name>. You have earned that much from me at least.

I will return to Amani'Zar soon. After I've spent enough time staring into de past.}}
