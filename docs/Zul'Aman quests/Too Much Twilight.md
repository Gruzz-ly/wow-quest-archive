==Objectives==
Destroy 4 corrupted totems in Spiritpaw Village.
*Hidden corruption destroyed (4)

==Description==
Our new loa speaker, Voice of Nalorakk, had some of his "chosen" put special glowy gems inside of our totems around the village. They didn't know that I saw them do it, but if you look close, you can see the purple energy, just like around the chosen.

I noticed that when the guardian bears get near them, they get really agitated and upset. It's got to be bad.

Destroy the hidden shadows!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,860 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I don't know what those things were for, but we're better off without them in the camp.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Fleeg|The guardians can smell the bad stuff.}}

Make sure you accept [[Not Quite Nalorakk]] from [[Furgh]]
:{{Text|Say|Furgh|Everybody wants to fight, even if they got no trinkets. Be careful.}}

The corrupted totems that had to be destroyed are the [[Voidtainted Training Stick]], the [[Voidtainted Totem]], the [[Voidtainted Light]] & the [[Voidtainted Carving]].

Return to the Furbolg duo and turn in both quests.
