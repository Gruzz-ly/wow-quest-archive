==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Haven't been back to de temple since I was a child. There be nothin' there but birds an' bramble.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|Still, the eagles returning here seems like a good sign.}}

;Upon reaching the [[Temple of Akil'zon]]
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|[[Loa Speaker Kinduru|Kinduru]] wanted us to leave an offering. De heads of our enemies will do nicely.}}

Speak with Lady Liadrin.
{{dialogue|Though she feigns indifference. I feel there's still a deep desire in Zul'jarra to see her gods finally appear.

{{gossip|<Stay a while and listen.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|If Kinduru is correct, it may be possible to contact the loa--by walking this path of "hash'ey."}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|And be one step closer to ridding Zul'Aman of the Twilight's Blade.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Yes, gokinye. We are closer to achievin' your goals. Let's go.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Wait... I did not mean to... Zul'jarra, becoming the hash'ey will be a great achievement.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra| Now ya try to flatter me? I know why ya here. To protect ya precious golden fields of Eversong.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Do not pretend to care about me or de Amani.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Enough, Zul'jarra. I admit that my past keeps me from... empathizing fully with your people.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|I told you that I fought against your grandfather.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|But I did not tell you that he held me captive and tortured me. And tortured and killed many of my peers.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|That part of my past led me down a path I am not proud of.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|And, as strange as it seems, I see some of myself in your plight. And want you to become closer to your gods.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Now! <Name> and I are your hash'ura. We will attend you...}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Ha ha ha ha ha. You're a funny one. Straight as a spear but thick as a pango-hide shield.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|If you say that's what guides your hand, I believe you. Your counsel has been good. And you bring strong company.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|But dat don't make us friends.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Dis journey gonna try us all, so we should get goin' soon, eh hash'ura?}}

Interact with [[Sack of Gnarldin Heads]] to retrieve the heads.

Place 3 Gnarldin Heads to feed the hatchlings, and a voice boomed.
:{{Text|Say|[[Akil'zon|???]]|Ha ha ha! The heads of our enemies. A tribute to our victory.}}
