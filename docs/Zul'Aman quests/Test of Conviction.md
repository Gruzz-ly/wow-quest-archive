==Description==
We got her attention. But now what?

I know there is a trial. But Akil'zon is not givin' any hints on what it is.

Think. Think. What did Kinduru teach me as a child? She is de loa of victory. But also of oaths and conviction.

If only we had made it to de top when I was a child, and I hadn't fallen...

==Completion==
<Zul'jarra's eyes are closed. She seems lost in thought.>

Dey were here all along. It was my grandfather's fault dey would not answer.

<She nods her head and sighs.>

My grandfather broke dis. It is up to me to fix it. It is de only way to save my people.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Akil'zon|???]]|All that seek my favor must climb high but not be afraid to fall.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|De trial... Kinduru brought me here as a child... I remember!}}
:''Zul'jarra and [[Lady Liadrin]] head to the temple ledge.''

Follow them to the temple ledge.
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Kinduru... I hope you be right. For de Amani!}}
:''Zul'jarra jumps off.''
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Wait, Zul'jarra! Are you mad?}}

Liadrin has a gossip:
{{dialogue|<Liadrin's wide-eyed gaze is fixated on the ground below.>

She just... jumped.

No hesitation.

Moments ago, she telling us all that was up here was "birds and bramble."

But now that Akil' zon has spoken. I think she has shown us her true convictions.

You're... not going to follow her, are you?}}

Upon jumping off, a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "The Temple View - Eagle" starts.
:''The Adventurer and Zul'jarra dive down into the ground as Akil'zon flies from above. The two were stopped by a powerful gale.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Well done, Zul'jarra!}}
:''Zul'jarra is pulled back up. Only for her to see Akil'zon.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Kinduru was right about you.}}
:''Akil'zon puts Zul'jarra down safely. Lady Liadrin & the Adventurer, is also back up to the altar, walks up to Akil'zon.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jarra|All this time... You were right here!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jarra|Why didn't you answer us?!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Because of your grandfather, [[Zul'jin]].}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|And that snake of a witch doctor, [[Hexlord Malacrass|Malacrass]].}}
:''Akil'Zon, Zul'jarra, Liadrin, & the adventurer begins walking.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Long ago, we loa would choose a champion among the Amani.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|A "hash'ey" to wield our power for the good of their people.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Zul'jin wanted to use that power again.}}
:''Akil'zon looks at Zul'jarra as she continues.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Not to serve his people, but to slaughter his enemies.}}
:''The party stopped near the steps of the Temple.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|We would not grant such a blessing.}}
:''Akil'zon then looks at the temple as the sequence cuts to the shot of the altar inside the temple.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|So he had Malacrass steal it from us and make their own false, abhorrent hash'ey.}}
:''The eagles begin flying out of the temple.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lady Liadrin|But [[Horde|our own champions]] raided the temple city and stopped them.}}
:''Zul'jarra walks up to Akil'zon as the Loa turns to look at Zul'jarra.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jarra|So now all Amani must suffer for my grandfather's mistakes?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jarra|If you don't help us fight de cult...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|You passed my trial, Zul'jarra.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|You have my favor.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Now you just need the others.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Zul'jarra|Need dem for what?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|To become the first hash'ey in generations.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|What else?}}
:''Akil'zon laughs for a while as Zul'jarra opened her eyes wide. Akil'zon spreads her wings open.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Prove to the loa that you are not your grandfather!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Triumph where he failed!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Akil'zon|Become hash'ey, a true hash'ey, and wield the power of the loa in defense of Zul'Aman!}}

On the other side of the cutscene, Akil'zon has a gossip:
{{dialogue|I think of the Amani as my children. But children sometimes go astray.

{{gossip|Why did the loa abandon the Amani?}}
{{dialogue-child|We did not abandon the Amani. The Amani betrayed us.

[[Hex Lord Malacrass|Hexlord Malacrass]] persuaded Warlord [[Zul'jin]] to create powerful warriors by any means necessary.

A profane way to drain our power and infuse it into four Amani avatars was found. Gokinye, like you, stopped them, killing the avatars, Malacrass, and Zul'jin.

I abandoned my temple. [[Halazzi]] retreated into the mists, healing. [[Jan'alai]] died a forever death, their flame extinguished. [[Nalorakk]] became fury Incarnate, only soothed by deep hibernation in the mountain.

If Zul'jarra wants to become hash'ey and destroy the Twilight's Blade. She will need all our blessing--not just mine.

The loa's bond to the Amani must become strong again.}}
