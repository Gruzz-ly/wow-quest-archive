==Objectives==
Investigate the Witherbark from the Hinterlands for signs of Shadra.
*Hinterlands evidence found (3)

==Description==
I am of de [[Revantusk tribe]]. We are cautious of Witherbark because of history from de [[Hinterlands]].

The Witherbark here in Zul'Aman seem to respect us and de Amani, but the Witherbark I remember in the Hinterlands killed and backstabbed dey allies for power.

They worshipped the Spider Loa, [[Shadra]]. I lost friends to dat venom.

When the Hinterlands Witherbark temple [[Shadra'Alor]] fell, the Witherbark went somewhere. Look around for evidence of the [[Hinterlands]]... and of [[Shadra]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,860 [[XP]]

==Completion==
All dem places they mentioned be right next door to Shadra'Alor! Dey probably worshipped Shadra.

I don't trust dem.
