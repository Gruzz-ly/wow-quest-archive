==Objectives==
Find 6 stolen Food Provisions in [[Atal'Abasi]].
*[[Food Provisions]] (6)

==Description==
While I was limping back from the river, I spotted a few of the [[murloc]]s dragging our food bags through the mud. They weren't working together either. Kept snapping at each other, trying to snatch the best pieces for themselves.

I saw one of them stash a whole satchel behind a fallen tree. Another buried something under a pile of rocks. Greedy little monsters think they can steal from us and get away with it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]
