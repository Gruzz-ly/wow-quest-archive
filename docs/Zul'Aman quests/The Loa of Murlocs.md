{{Dialogue|Be welcome within my kingdom. traveler. Peace and prosperity be upon you!

{{Gossip|Can you explain what is happening here?}}
{{Dialogue-child|<King Mrgl-Mrgl lowers his voice to a whisper.>

You have to help me!

I came here to study the murlocs of Zul'Aman, but they were attacked by another tribe and rallied around me when I defended them. Now they think I am their god or loa or something!

I don't know how to be a god! I barely know how to be a murloc in this costume!

And I'm pretty sure this is a professional "no no" as a researcher too.}}
