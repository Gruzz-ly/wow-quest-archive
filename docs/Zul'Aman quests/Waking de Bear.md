==Objectives==
Travel to [[Torntusk Point]] and speak with [[Lilaju]], the Revantusk leader.
*Speak with Lilaju

==Description==
We must set aside what [[Zul'jan]] has done and focus on de final hash'ey trial: facin' [[Nalorakk]], de Loa of War.

De [[Revantusk]] were once beloved of Nalorakk. Legend has it dat his loa speaker was so devoted, she followed him into his temple and his den with de most faithful of de Revantusk's warriors.

But now de temple is sealed. We cannot speak to de loa speaker, but maybe [[Lilaju]] knows how to get Nalorakk's attention.

She keeps watch for de [[Twilight's Blade]] at [[Torntusk Point]] with her guards.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,530 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Lilaju is de only person who can help us now.

==Completion==
I do not pity Lilaju--I was around her age when I took my place as leader of de Amani.

I am proud of her. She is stickin' up for herself and her tribe.

She gave us what we needed. And I will not go back on my promise of helping her.

Is it true that [[Loa Speaker Kinduru|Kinduru]] made you and Liadrin hash'ura? Hmph.

Word has spread dat you helped Zul'jarra along de path of de hash'ey and dat de loa are back.

But I have not heard a sound from Nalorakk's den.

<Lilaju puts her hands on her hips.>

Typical. You came to us last, didn't you?

We needed help too!

{{gossip|quest=|We will. But we need to speak to Nalorakk to do so.}}
