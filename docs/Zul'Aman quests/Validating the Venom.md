==Objectives==
Speak to the Witherbark Chief and locate an anti-venom alchemist in the village.
*Speak to [[Vun'Zarah|Chief Vuk'arah]]
*Speak to [[Mixer Jamanga]]
*Send [[Daki]] to Mixer Jamanga

==Description==
This means there are both frog and spider venoms in the mixtures. [[Halazzi]] says he senses somebody called [[Shadra]] on that fang. They must be a really big spider!

Halazzi doesn't like that the [[Vilebranch]] had it. I can tell. He's unhappy. His ears get all flat.

So we gotta help out. Take the samples and Shadra fang to the Witherbark Chief. We Witherbark have alchemists that can brew anti-venoms for both spiders and frogs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|17|55}}
*10,395 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Vilebranch are the ones doin' something with Shadra?

Could the spiders be working against the Witherbark? This don't make sense.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:''Daki awakens''
:{{Text|Say|Daki|I think the venom is wearing off. I was here and able to see, and feel... but not speak or move!}}
:{{Text|Say|Halazzi|It is safe to return to the village, if you feel ready.}}
:{{Text|Say|Daki|Thank you for your protection, Halazzi.}}
:''[[Sakaja]] & Daki departs.''
:{{Text|Say|Halazzi|The Vilebranch are continuing to brew stronger venoms. They smell of spider. Your hunt continues.}}

Halazzi's gossip changed
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Who is Shadra?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Elortha no Shadra was an ancient loa I once knew. She was the Queen of Spiders. I know her to be dead, killed by the Zandalari.

Shadra has never had a large presence here in Zul' Aman. Groups of Amani that went to the south found her and worshipped her there. I do not know if the Vilebranch worship Shadra. They may not have known this fang was hers.

But if they do know--that is of deep concern. They could want to prevent her return, or twist it to their ends. Her venoms would be horrific in the hands of the Vilebranch.

Shadra may be very fragile in body, but her venom was not to be underestimated.}}
