==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Twilight Ritualists and 6 Twilight Trollbreakers in [[Firewing Terrace]].
*[[Twilight Ritualist (Zul'Aman)|Twilight Ritualist]] slain (6)
*[[Twilight Trollbreaker]] slain (6)

==Description==
In our reconnaissance flight around the city, [[Zul'jarra]] and I got a look at the Twilight's offensive. They're summoning more Twilight's Blade directly into Atal'Aman.

We can counter them by disrupting their dark summoning rituals. That will stop the flow of their cultists into the city and give the Amani time to strategize.

Kill the ritualists, and any trollbreakers already portaled into the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,710 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
That should slow them down--at least for the moment.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[The Amani Stand Strong]] from [[Zul'jan]], [[Twilight Bled]] from [[Zul'jarra]], & '''Rituals Cut Short''' from Lady Liadrin,
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Lightwood or no, our people need rescuing, Jan. Take de elf and look for survivors.}}
:''Zul'jan mounts up.''
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jan|Fine. <Class>, take de weapons. Arm any Amani you find.}}
:''Zul'jan departs and Zul'jarra and Liadrin mounted up to follow him.''

Across [[Firewing Terrace]], slay 6 Twilight Ritualists and 6 Twilight Trollbreakers,
:{{Text|Yell|[[Mor'duun]]|Killing my portal mages gets you nothing! We will still trample your pathetic swamp-city!}}

Go to the [[Altar of Malacrass]] and regroup with the party who are with [[Torundo the Grizzled]],
:{{Text|Say|Zul'jarra|Torundo, hold here until Zul'jan fires, den leave with de survivors in de confusion.}}
:{{Text|Say|Torundo the Grizzled|We will fly on de winds of Akil'zon--like in de olden days.}}

Each of the party has a gossip after completion,
{{dialogue|title=Lady Liadrin|Zul'jarra intends to engage Mor'duun directly. I intend to go with her.

Fire the bolts carefully... don't miss!}}

{{dialogue|title=Zul'jarra|Ballista is good, b but my axe to Mor'duun's skull is an even better distraction.

My people are ready to get out ter safety.}}

{{dialogue|title=Torundo the Grizzled|We have enough bolts to strike Mor'duun's shield a few times.

{{gossip|Where are the children that you were protecting?}}
{{dialogue-child|Dey are okay. Dey hidin' close by.

When I see an opportunity. I'll get em out.}}
