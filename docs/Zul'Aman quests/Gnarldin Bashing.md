==Objectives==
Slay 12 gnarldin in [[Akil'zon's Reach]].
*[[Gnarldin]] slain (12)

==Description==
[[Zul'jarra]] regards the gnarldin as a fierce, nomadic people that normally keep to themselves. It is clear by their clothing and weapons that they have a primative but unique culture.

If the circumstances were different, I would advocate for diplomacy.

But they are between us and our mission.

They cannot block our path or continue to damage the shrines or the nests of the eagles that roost here. We will eliminate only those that are in our way. The Amani can choose what to do with with the them later.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,365 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Good. Hopefully that clears the path to the shrines and the temple enough for our purposes.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[De Ancient Path]], [[Ahead of the Issue]], & '''Gnarldin Bashing'''

:''Lady Liadrin and Zul'jarra starts running.''

Slay the [[Gnarldin Clubfist]]s & [[Gnarldin Nestcrusher]]s.
