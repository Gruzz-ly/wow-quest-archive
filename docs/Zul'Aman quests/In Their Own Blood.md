==Description==
After studying de ashes. [[Elder Doru|Doru]] believes we can only fight with de past by using weapons of de past.

I cannot ask this of any Amani. Or [[Witherbark tribe|Witherbark]], [[Revantusk tribe|Revantusk]], or [[Shadowpine tribe|Shadowpine]]. Ya presence with us in these times must be fate... Because we could only make this request to an outsider.

Ya must inhabit a soul of de profane ones--Those that accepted [[Hex Lord Malacrass|Malacrass]]' vile bargain and consumed Loa power during de era of [[Zul'jin]].

Return to de shrine of de profane one ya wish to merge with.

Ancestors forgive us...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 17,105 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Thank you, hash'ura. Truly.

The battle against de echoes will continue. However, it would seem they cannot return after being slain now that their leader has been dealt with.

Memories stirred my blood these last few days. Now we can all rest. Perhaps even move on?

Bah! It just be de ravings of an old warrior. Do not mind me.

Simply consider myself in ya debts.

==Notes==
