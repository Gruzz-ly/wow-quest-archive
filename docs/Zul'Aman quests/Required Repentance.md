==Objectives==
Use the staff to aid Forgetful Ghosts in remembering what happened at the Shrine of Kulzi.
*[[Forgetful Ghost]] reminded (8)

==Description==
I remember dis staff. And I remember dat day.

We are... dead, then.

<Sij'ta seems to take in the realization with a sort of relief.>

Akutu was near death from a battle in de city. He had some serious wounds. Kulzi said he could not heal dem. Akutu would not accept dis. He wanted me to use de staff--a hexlord staff--on Kulzi to force him to heal.

And then... I tink I broke it.

Show de other spirits here dis staff. Maybe we can piece together what happened from dey memories.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,695 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Show dem de staff. See what dey remember.

==Completion==
I wish I knew why I broke de staff.

I think it be time for de warlord to face his memories, just like we are.

Otherwise, we gonna be trapped in dis curse forever. We gotta remember even if we don't want to.

==Notes==
Across the Shrine, interact with the Forgetful Ghosts which intact them to battle you. Put them down and they run off.
