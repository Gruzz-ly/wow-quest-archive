==Objectives==
Report the events of the battle of [[Andorhal]] to [[Commander Ashlam Valorfist]].

==Description==
Head south, to [[Chillwind Camp]].  Tell Commander Ashlam Valorfist everything that happened here.

Me?  I'm going west, into [[Tirisfal]].

My battle's not over yet.  I've got an appointment with that harpy that calls herself a [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]]... and I'm finding out what she did to [[Koltira]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chillwind Pauldrons
|Chillwind Legguards
|Chillwind Tunic
|Chillwind Staff
|Chillwind Dagger
|Chillwind Breeches
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Lost? No...next, they'll be coming for Chillwind, I suppose. This was a major strategic blow to the Alliance's plans for [[Lordaeron]]. 

Very well. I will report the results of this battle to [[Varian Wrynn|King Wrynn]]. I don't expect him to be happy.

==Notes==
Alliance players do not see anything happen to Koltira, or see why Lurid is now (more) dead.
