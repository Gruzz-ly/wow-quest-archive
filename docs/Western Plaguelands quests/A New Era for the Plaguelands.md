*[[Hulking Plaguebear Sample]] (4)
*[[Diseased Wolf Sample]] (4)

==Description==
No longer does the [[Scourge]] hold this area. We, the living, are retaking [[Lordaeron]].

We have taken great strides already, as you have already seen. The earth flowers, the trees grow tall and green, and the wildlife is beginning to come return. Yet a few remnants of undeath remain.

While the trees and grass prosper, the animals are struggling. Something is preventing them from healing, and I intend to find out what. Bring me samples from the plagued wildlife so that I may study them more closely. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bracers of the Returning Wild
|Boots of the Flowering Earth
|Forest Green Cloak
|Treads of Renewed Growth
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
Once the animals are healed, our duties here will be nearly complete.

==Completion==
This will be more than enough, <name>. Now, I will need some time to perform my studies.

== Notes ==
'''On completion'''
:{{text|say|Field Agent Kaartish|I will need some time to study these samples, <name>. I will speak to you again when I have completed my analysis.}}

==Patch changes==
