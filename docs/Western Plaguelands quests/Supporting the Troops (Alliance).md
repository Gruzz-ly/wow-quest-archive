==Objectives==
Slay 15 Andorhal Deathguards.
*[[Andorhal Deathguard]] slain (15)

==Description==
I'm no military expert, but this battle looks to be in our favor. Our defenders are equally matched with their deathguards, but the farmers' militia has taken them by surprise from the rear. For the Alliance!

Still, we should all do what we can to make sure that we win. Travel east into Andorhal and slay the Forsaken deathguards that are fighting with our men. The sooner they die, the quicker we can re-take Andorhal!

==Progression==
{{Western Plaguelands storyline}}

==Issues==
There is was known bug as of patch 4.1 in which the mobs needed to complete the quest will either not phase in at all, or completely disappear if the player tries to enter the town. Blizzard claims that this is a known issue that is being looked into. 

A workaround involves killing a lone guard that stands near the Sorrow Hill side bridge with a controllable pet (either a Hunter pet, a Warlock demon, or a Mage's Water Elemental) to attack it (it will phase out if you go past the archway from Sorrow Hill for any reason). Afterwards, the player must wait for this mob to respawn.

As of patch 4.3 (at least) there are still some Andorhal Deathguards who vanish either as you attack them or shortly thereafter.  However, those deathguards fighting Andorhal Defenders do not disappear.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Gloves of Approaching Victory]] and [[Belt of Proficiency]] added as rewards.}}
