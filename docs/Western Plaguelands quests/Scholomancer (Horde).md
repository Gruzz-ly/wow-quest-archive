==Objectives==
Kill Darkmaster Gandling within Andorhal.
*[[Darkmaster Gandling]] dealt with

==Description==
The Scholomance is one of the few Scourge holdouts remaining west of the Thondroril. The headmaster of Scholomance, a cultist by the name of Darkmaster Gandling, has made an appearance on the battlefield.

This will be his final mistake.

You will find Gandling in a square near the southern end of town. I want you to fight and weaken Gandling. I will join you to help finish him off. 

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Belt of Lingering Corruption|Elimination Bracers|Burden of Time|Gandling's Gloves}}

You will also receive: {{cost|1|10}}

==Progress==
I will not rest until the Lich King's taint is lifted from Andorhal.

==Completion==
Excellently done, <name>. And now, with the leader of the Scourge forces eliminated from Andorhal, we bide our time.

== Notes ==
'''On accepting the quest'''
:{{text|say|Koltira Deathweaver|Gandling is strong, but do not worry. I will join you shortly after you begin to fight him.}}

'''Encounter with Gandling'''
:{{text|say|Darkmaster Gandling|Prepare to die, <race>!}}
''At low health, Gandling traps the hero within a shadow prison, leaving them helpless.''
:{{text|say|Darkmaster Gandling|Your life is forfeit.}}
''Koltira Deathweaver and Thassarian arrive and break the hero out of the prison. They then assist in finishing off Gandling.
:{{text|say|Darkmaster Gandling|Enough of this. The Cult of the Damned doesn't need Andorhal. This worthless city is yours to fight over.}}
''Darkmaster Gandling teleports away from the battlefield.''
:{{text|say|Thassarian|Koltira! I had heard rumors that you were here in Lordaeron.}}
:{{text|say|Koltira Deathweaver|You heard correctly, Thassarian. I wanted to give you a chance to kill me again.}}
:{{text|emote|Thassarian laughs.}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|It looks like it may have to come to that.}}
:{{text|say|Koltira Deathweaver|Yes, it may... but not today. With the Scourge out of the way, I plan to pull my troops back and regroup.}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|I see. Then I will do the same.}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|But you must be aware, Koltira: we are brothers no longer. You are a member of the Horde now, and I of the Alliance.}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|Eventually, we will fight this battle for Andorhal, and only one of us can walk off this battlefield victorious.}}
:{{text|say|Koltira Deathweaver|Yes, I know. And don't think I'll go easy on you.}}
:{{text|emote|Thassarian laughs.}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|Very well. I look forward to it.}}
:{{text|whisper|Koltira Deathweaver|You are not to speak to ANYONE about the agreement that was made today, <name>. Consider this an order from your direct superior.}}
