==Objectives==
Slay 15 Desiccated Scourge within Andorhal.
*Desiccated Scourge slain (15)

==Description==
[[Darkmaster Gandling]] of the [[Cult of the Damned]] leads the [[Scourge]] offensive here in [[Andorhal]]. My old counterpart, [[Thassarian]], leads the [[Alliance]] forces. If we're to win Andorhal, we'll have to defeat both, but we will certainly fail if we take on both at once.

I know Thassarian well enough to know that he will focus on the Scourge first. We will do the same.

Take out the weaker, desiccated Scourge to reduce their numbers.The Alliance will have to wait to taste our wrath.

==Progress==
Thin out the Scourge forces, <name>. Our victory depends on keeping their numbers down.

==Completion==
You may not act quickly, but at least you do not fail me.

Very well. I will have a more important task for you, <name>, when the time is right.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}
