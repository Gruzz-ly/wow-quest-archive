==Objectives==
Challenge and defeat 7 Hearthglen Trainees.
*[[Hearthglen Trainee]] challenged and defeated (7)

==Description==
Finally! You're here! Get to work!

My men have been sparring with these wooden practice dummies for far too long. Sure, you can learn how to swing a sword by practicing with a dummy, but real combat requires a real combatant.

Hmmm... I had asked for them to send me someone imposing, but I suppose a skinny-armed <race> <class> will have to do.

Now get in there and teach my men how to fight!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*5550 [[XP]]
*+325 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
I'm not paying you to talk to me.  I'm paying you to talk with my soldiers... and then fight with them.

==Completion==
I'm just looking over my paperwork here, and it says that we were expecting a <opposite sex> <race> <class>.  You're not, umm...

<[[Lieutenant Myner]] looks at you awkwardly.>

Never mind.  It would appear that you are not the person that I originally hired, but you did a good job.  So I'm going to pay you anyhow.

==Progression==
