==Objectives==
Find Ada Darkheardt at [[Caer Darrow]] in {{C|Western Plaguelands}}.
*Find [[Ada Darkhardt]]'s Camp

==Description==
Of course I expected you to find me here. Why do you think I left those cultists corpses for you to find in that vault?

Before you get too worked up; yes [[Mannoroc Orb|the orb]] is safe. More safe than this city, apparently. If I had entered the vault just a few moments later the orb would have been long gone.

I've said enough for now and this tavern has ears. Find me on the Island of Caer Darrow in Western Plaguelands. You'll get answers when you arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Testament of Horn of Lordaeron]]
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Let's speak, <name>.

==Completion==
I sense the end is in sight. Hopefully we can find a suitable replacement for your blood, and be done with this business once and for all.

In any case, you came all this way in good faith and didn't try to kill me so I appreciate that. Here, take this as a token of my appreciation. It's not much, but it served me well... in another life. Hopefully it can be a boon to you as well.

==Notes==
;Gregory dialogue
{{dialogue|You don't look surprised to see me.

I've had much time to reflect since our last meeting in {{C|Felwood}}, <name>. Not only was my attempt on your life foolish, it was terribly shortsighted. In my eagerness to complete my mission, I failed to consider my actions and how they would be perceived. This misjudgment has cost us much.

I do believe we can still help each other. What else can I tell you to put your mind at ease?

{{gossip|First off, why did you take the [[Echoing Orb|echoing orb]] from [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]]?}}

The [[Cult of the Damned|cult of the damned]] has eyes and ears in a great many places. When I realized that the [[Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade]] intended to make a move on the orb, I made mine first. Trust me, <name>, the orb is safer where I have it than anywhere in Stormwind.

Getting into the vault first wasn't terribly difficult either. It turns out when you don't properly compensate [[Stonemasons Guild|the people]] who build your opulent castles and vaults, you can never be sure who might end up with knowledge about the secret doors and passageways.

{{gossip|Well that's a disturbing thought.

:Fine. What's next, how do I fit into this?}}

For starters I wanted you to know that the orb was safe to prevent you from rushing off to chase a dead end. For another thing, the partial ritual we performed in Felwood did have an effect on the rob. It's changed now.

I believe that there may be another way to finish the process and destroy it without needless betrayal. However, I believe we'll still need you to complete the ritual, just not as a sacrifice. These things are all about creating and severing arcane connections and for good or ill, you are a part of this until the end now.

{{gossip|Great. Sounds like you tried to kill me for nothing then.}}

Regrettably, yes. You must understand that at that time, your death seemed a perfectly acceptable price to pay for the expedient advancement of my goals. It was simply the most pragmatic path forward. In retrospect of course, I can see that it was entirely self-defeating and served only to delay the completion of my objective.

{{gossip|That is one of the worst apologies I think I've ever heard.}}

The morality of the living is something that does not come easy to someone in my position, paladin. I can honestly say that it was a costly misjudgement, and I am sorry for that. I am also sorry that it made an enemy of of Aeonas, after doing much to gain some amount of his trust. He was a powerful ally and our cause is weakened without him.

{{gossip|"Our" Cause is it? Just like that?}}

Yes, just like that. Or so I had hoped. You are a capable paladin, <name>. Whatever is lurking on the other end of these orbs is dangerous and I think you know that. I hope that you can see logic in continuing our partnership until my mission is completed.

{{gossip|I'll have to think about it. What are your plans now?}}

For now, we lie low and wait. The orb is changed, but it's also as if it's been tempered, hardened. I suspect we'll need something significantly stronger than your blood to finish the job and destroy it this time. Ada will be hard at work searching for a suitable reagent.

If you happen to cross paths with Aeonas again, tell him I'm... sorry.

{{gossip|I just want to ask you about something else.}}

{{dialogue|Don't have much to say to you, paladin. My master thinks we need you. I disagree.

I know enough about paladins to know that you are only going to get in my way. Leave me before I crack in that thick, self-righteous skull of yours.}}
