==Objectives==
Bring {{NPC||Zen'Kiki}} to the [[Malicia's Outpost|Malicia Outpost]] in [[Western Plaguelands]], then break 4 Captive Plaguebears out of their cages and allow Zen'Kiki to heal them.
*[[Captive Plaguebear]] freed and healed (4)

==Description==
While you've been away, I've been trying a different approach on our friend Zen'Kiki. I believe he may have a future as a healer. This is mainly because healing spells never miss.

I hear from {{NPC||Field Agent Kaartish}} that the cultist camp to the east is where the plagued animals are coming from. I hope you don't mind escorting Zen'Kiki over there... perhaps he can help heal some of the plagued animals within the camp.

==Progress==
By the grace of the [[Earthmother]], I hope this works.

==Completion==
By the grace of the Earthmother, he's done it!  Thank you, <name>!

I admit, I had nearly given up hope on Zen'Kiki.  It is only due to your patience and diligence that he has come into his own as a druid and member of the [[Cenarion Circle]].  And that's without even mentioning the good you've done for nature.

You have my admiration and respect.

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
