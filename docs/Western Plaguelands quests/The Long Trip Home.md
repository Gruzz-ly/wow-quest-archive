==Objectives==
Reconvene with {{NPC||Del Gahrron}} at the [[Menders' Stead]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].

==Description==
I've been many places in my life, good <class>. I fought the battle for [[Ahn'Qiraj]], passed through the [[Dark Portal]] into [[Outland]], and joined the [[Argent Crusade]] to beat down [[Scourge]] in coldest [[Northrend]].

But before it all, I was a farmer here in [[Lordaeron]]. Now I find myself here in [[Hearthglen]], a scant few miles from [[Gahrron's Withering|home]]. It's time I paid my respects.

I'm headed to the Menders' Stead before I return home. I wouldn't mind meeting up with you again once I get there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||11}}

==Completion==
It would appear that I arrived before you, <name>.

{{NPC||Field Agent Kaartish}} gave me the details about my old home. It seems my battles with the Scourge aren't quite over yet.
