==Objectives==
Kill 20 Forsaken Troopers within Andorhal.
*[[Forsaken Trooper]] slain (20)

==Description==
Our militia has been nearly wiped out. Only I and these few farmers remain.

Those [[Val'kyr|winged creatures]]...they took the bodies of our men and...and turned them into walking, undead corpses! With every one of our men they took, they bolstered their own ranks.

It pains me to admit it, but you will have to fight them too, along with the deathguards and val'kyr. As they did in life, they hunt in packs, so take some of my minutemen with you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Minuteman Pike
|Quelling Bracers
|Shoulderwraps of the Enthralled
|Pack Leader's Band
|Bracer of Grievance
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Try not to remember - while they used to be allies, these men are Forsaken now.

==Completion==
You fought valiantly, but we're getting nowhere. Every body that falls just fuels their forces.

== Notes ==
Upon accepting either this quest or [[Val'kyr Incursion]], you get a pack (of 3) minutemen to accompany you.
