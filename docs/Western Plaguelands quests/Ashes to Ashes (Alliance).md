==Objectives==
Slay 3 Deathguard War-Captains.
*[[Deathguard War-Captain]] slain (3)

==Description==
To the east, deep within [[Forsaken]]-held [[Andorhal]], you will find their commanders. They do not fight, but call out orders from horseback.

Hunt down and slay these commanders, <name>. The Forsaken won't stand a chance.

==Progress==
You will find them to the east, <name>. Do not fail me.

==Completion==
Well done. With them out of the way, I have no more excuses.

Soon, I must battle Koltira, for honor and for Andorhal.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||50}}

==Notes==
Be aware that at least one of the captains is close enough to the horde flight point that the bats will aggro if you enter melee with him.  Also be prepared that the captains are about twice as tough as the average mob.

The follow-on quest requires the other two quests in this part of the chain be completed.  See progression below.
