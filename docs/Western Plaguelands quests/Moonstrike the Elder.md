The heavens, in their countless stars, hold answers to earthly mysteries, <name>. &nbsp;Might, then, the wise, and the lucky, gaze up and find truth?

You will receive:
*[[Coin of Ancestry]]

==Notes==
She can been found at [[Caer Darrow]] in the [[Western Plaguelands]], at {{co|69.2|73.5|Western Plaguelands}} on the map.

From [[Chillwind Point]] flight path, take the road South (right) and then East (left) along the river. When you reach the lake, head south to the bridge to the island.

Entering Scholomance, go up the hill. You will see her on the roof of the [[barracks]] at Caer Darrow. Facing the building, take the right into the building, there is no need to go into the instance. 

Follow like you would in any other barracks but take the stairs to your right to get to the roof instead of going to the main hall, Darrowmere Lake sub-zone map co-ordinates (69,53).
