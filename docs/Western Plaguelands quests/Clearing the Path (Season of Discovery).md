Kill 5 Blighted Zombies, 10 Skeletal Terrors, and 10 Rotting Cadavers to help clear a path for [[Squire Cuthbert]] to escape.

*[[Skeletal Terror]] slain (10)
*[[Rotting Cadaver]] slain (10)

==Description==
The pounding in my head has subsided somewhat, but I don't think I can fight my way out of here on my own yet. I hate to ask more of you, but could you help thin the ranks and clear a path for me to make my escape?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5650 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*+100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Thank you again, paladin. If we had someone like you with us when we were ambushed, I'm quite sure the ambush would have turned into a rout against our attackers in minutes!

I've got my second wind now and must find Sir Dalton. He is a most skilled [[knight]], but I am sure he needs my aid. Tell me, have you seen him out there? He's hard to miss in his gleaming white plate armor.
