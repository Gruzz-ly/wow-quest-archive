==Objectives==
Kill Darkmaster Gandling within Andorhal.
*[[Darkmaster Gandling]] dealt with

==Description==
The Scholomance is one of the few Scourge holdouts remaining west of the [[Thondroril River|Thondroril]]. The headmaster of Scholomance, a cultist by the name of Darkmaster Gandling, has made an appearance on the battlefield.

This will be his final mistake.

You will find Gandling in a square near the southern end of town. I want you to fight and weaken Gandling. I will join you to help finish him off.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|10}}
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Belt of Lingering Corruption|Elimination Bracers|Burden of Time|Gandling's Gloves}}

==Completion==
Excellently done, <name>.  And now, with the leader of the Scourge forces eliminated from Andorhal, we bide our time.

== Notes ==
;On accept:{{text|say|Thassarian|Gandling is strong, but do not worry.  I will join you shortly after you begin to fight him.}}

;On engaging Gandling
:{{text|say|Darkmaster Gandling|Prepare to die, <race>!}}
;Nearing Gandling's defeat
:{{text|say|Darkmaster Gandling|Your life is forfeit.}}
:{{text|yell|Thassarian|For the Alliance!}}
:{{text|yell|Koltira Deathweaver|For the Horde!}}
:{{text|say|Darkmaster Gandling|Enough of this.  The Cult of the Damned doesn't need Andorhal.  This worthless city is yours to fight over.}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|Koltira!  I had heard rumors that you were here in Lordaeron.}}
:{{text|say|Koltira Deathweaver|You heard correctly, Thassarian.  I wanted to give you a chance to kill me again.}}
:{{text|emote|Thassarian laughs}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|It looks like it may have to come to that.}}
:{{text|say|Koltira Deathweaver|Yes, it may... but not today.  With the Scourge out of the way, I plan to pull my troops back and regroup.}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|I see.  Then I will do the same.}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|But you must be aware, Koltira:  we are brothers no longer.  You are a member of the Horde now, and I of the Alliance.}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|Eventually, we will fight this battle for Andorhal, and only one of us can walk off the battlefield victorious.}}
:{{text|say|Koltira Deathweaver|Yes, I know.  And don't think I'll go easy on you.}}
:{{text|emote|Thassarian laughs}}
:{{text|say|Thassarian|Very well.  I look forward to it.}}
:{{text|whisper|Thassarian|You are not to speak to ANYONE about the agreement that was made today, <name>.  Consider this an order from your direct superior.}}
