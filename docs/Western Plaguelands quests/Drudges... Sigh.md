==Objectives==
Kill Shadril within the [[mine]] inside [[Hearthglen]].

*[[Shadril]] slain

==Description==
Say, I never caught your name. <name>? Pleased to meet you, <name>.

I've got one more problem that needs fixing, and you have a look about you that just screams "I'm a problem-fixer".

There's a small mine on the northern edge of Hearthglen, where we get most of the ore that the town needs. My [[Hearthglen Drudge|drudges]] who work the mine normally do a decent job.

Unfortunately, it seems that a larger-than-average spider has taken up residence within this cave. Think you can clear things up for me?

==Progress==
I need to get those drudges back to work.

==Completion==
Nice work!  In retrospect, I'm glad that other <race> <class> never showed up... you've proven to be all the help I need.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progression==
{{Western Plaguelands storyline}}
