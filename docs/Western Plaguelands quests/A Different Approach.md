'''A Different Approach''' is part of the [[Zen'Kiki]] quest chain.

==Objectives==
Bring [[Zen'Kiki]] to the top of the hill east of the [[Menders' Stead]], then use him to summon and kill 7 [[Diseased Hawk]]s.

==Description==
Among other things, Zen'Kiki needs to work on his spell accuracy. I could see his wrath spells spiraling out of control even from here! In fact, I used them as a marker to follow your progress through the woods.

Perhaps we can use Zen'Kiki another way. Take him up to the top of the hill just to our east. The diseased hawks that circle above that hill must be destroyed. Ask Zen'Kiki to shoot at these hawks. Even if he can't hit them, he will distract them so you can finish them off.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
* 3710 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Back so soon?

==Completion==
Now we're getting somewhere.  How many birds did Zen'Kiki end up killing?

None?  You killed them all yourself?

Alright, I suppose we'll have to find another use for him then.  I will let you know when the time is right.

==Notes==
To get Zen'kiki to fire at a Diseased Hawk, simply click on him while in the quest area.
