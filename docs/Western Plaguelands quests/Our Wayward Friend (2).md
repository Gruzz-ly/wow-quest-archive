Speak with Aeonas before heading back to [[Stormwind]] to let [[Katherine the Pure|Katherine]] know his answer.
*Speak to [[Aeonas]]

==Description==
You look like you've grown strong since last we met. I'm very glad. If there's anything I've done right in my life, its saving your life in {{C|Felwood}} and that is a comfort to me.

Anyway, best be getting going back to Katherine now, unless there was anything else you needed to ask me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
<Name> thank the [[light]] you are here! The vault has just been robbed and the [[Mannoroc Orb|Mannoroc Echoing Orb]] has been stolen!

==Notes==
On speaking to Aeonas:
{{Dialogue|
{{gossip|If you won't come back I respect that, but can you at least tell me where you've been?}}

Here and there, but I've kept busy. I've mostly been taking on odd jobs. Cracking some [[bandit]] skulls here, incinerating some [[necromancer]]s, there. Putting down the odd [[sheep]]-stealing [[dragon]]. It's not much, but it's honest work, and it keeps my hands busy.

Plus... it's a great way to stay in shape!

{{gossip|Why are you here now?}}

Recently I've been... retracing my steps. Trying to understand where it all went wrong. I've known a lot of failure, <name> and I have a lot to atone for. So I'm doing that atonement now, in my own way.

Andorhal is my next stop. I've actually not been back there since before the war started, but it feels like part of me has been waiting there for years.

{{gossip|<Remain silent>}}

I've been avoiding this place for a long time. So many of my best friends, my brothers and sisters... died in that accursed city protecting that little box of ashes. I should have been there with them, of course. But my own stubbornness led me to leave the order just as they were about to need me the most.

{{gossip|You couldn't have known what was coming.}}

It hardly matters. I swore an oath and when you swear an oath it's for life. Whatever petty squabbles I had or how narrow-minded some of our leaders were, it didn't excuse me from walking away, even if many of them wanted me gone.

So now I'm retracing my steps and walking towards the things that are uncomfortable instead of walking away from them.

{{gossip|I understand. I'll let Katherine know you aren't ready yet. I hope we meet again soon.}}
