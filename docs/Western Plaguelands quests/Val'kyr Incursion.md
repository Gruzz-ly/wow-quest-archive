==Objectives==
Kill 9 lesser val'kyr within [[Andorhal]]
*[[Lesser Val'kyr]] slain (5)

==Description==
The [[Val'kyr]] were one of the [[Scourge]]'s primary weapons. Not only were they skilled in battle, but they could be used to convert corpses into Scourge minions. To think that [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] is stooping to such levels for the sake of the Forsaken...

We need to stop the val'kyr before they wipe us out and turn our army against us. Slay as many as you can find. And bring some of these minutemen with you. If they've survived this long, then they must have some battle skill.

==Progress==
Koltira, what have you done...

==Completion==
For every val'kyr you slay, you save dozens of our men...and prevent the Forsaken forces from growing.

Still, they press on. We may not win this battle after all.

==Rewards==
You will receive {{cost|1}}

==Notes==
Upon accepting either this quest or [[Val'kyr Incursion]], you get a pack (of 3) minutemen to accompany you.
