==Objectives==
Remove 6 Bad Corn, 4 Rotten Apples, and 3 Unhealthy-Looking Pumpkins from [[Dalson's Farm]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].
*[[Corn Stalker|Bad Corn]] Removed (6)
*[[Pome Wraith|Rotten Apple]] Removed (4)
*[[Thrashing Pumpkin|Unhealthy-Looking Pumpkin]] Removed (3)

==Description==
<race>! I'm glad someone's here to help me out.

We [[Cenarion Circle|Cenarion]] druids have re-cultivated Dalson's Farm, immediately behind me. The land has flourished and our crops have been successful... mostly.

A few plants seem to still be infected by the plague that ran through this land. Perhaps their roots were too deep, perhaps the seeds were weak... I cannot say. All I can say is that I need an able <class> like you to help me remove the bad plants from the good ones.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progress==
Have you finished killing ... er, removing those plants yet?

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>.  I know that picking vegetables isn't the most heroic task imaginable, but even the humblest tasks have their rewards. 

==Notes==
The quest title is a play on lyrics from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West Kanye West] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Foxx Jamie Foxx's] "Gold Digger"

* Wrotten apples - summon a [[Pome Wraith]].  (Pome?  Google's right there for you.)
