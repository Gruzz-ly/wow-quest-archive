==Objectives==
With the [[Enthralled Val'kyr]] by your side, kill 5 [[Frightened Provincial Minuteman|Frightened Provincial Minutemen]] so that they can be turned into [[Forsaken Trooper (Western Plaguelands)|Forsaken Troopers]]. Then find [[Thassarian]] in western [[Andorhal]].
*[[Frightened Provincial Minuteman]] slain and converted (5)
*[[Forsaken Trooper (Western Plaguelands)|Forsaken Trooper]] mobilized (5)
*Hunt [[Thassarian]]

==Description==
You have no idea how difficult it was to stay disguised while I watched [[Koltira]] let this war slip away from us. Even now, those infernal farmers threaten to overwhelm us. All because he refused to slay a friend.

Take my val'kyr again, <name>. With her by your side, kill these farmers, convert them to Forsaken, and mobilize them. Then take a group of them into Alliance-held western Andorhal and hunt down this death knight, Thassarian.

We will win this war yet.

==Progress==
You will be my weapon. Win this war for Andorhal.

==Completion==
This is the body of Lurid, Thassarian's trusted knight. With Thassarian nowhere to be found, it would seem that the Alliance forces have withdrawn.

The Forsaken have won the battle for Andorhal.
