==Objectives==
Kill 12 Rabid Foxes near [[Northridge Lumber Mill]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].
*[[Rabid Fox]] slain (12)

==Description==
I'm happy for [[Nathaniel Dumah|Nathaniel]]: he's spent so long trying to return to Northridge, and now with the Scarlet Crusade out of the way, he can finally move back home. It's just... even for such a seemingly-idyllic setting, it's not really the best place to raise a family.

For example: along this valley's edge, you will find rabid foxes searching for innocent prey. Every once in a while I catch a glimpse of one looking right at me.

Please, <class>, remove some of these foxes. I don't feel safe with them near.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progress==
I have a family to raise, and I need to do whatever I can to protect them.

==Completion==
I feel a bit more relieved, <name>.  Thank you. 

==Progression==
