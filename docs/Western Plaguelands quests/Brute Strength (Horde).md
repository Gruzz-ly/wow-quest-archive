==Objectives==
Kill the Ravenian within [[Andorhal]].
*[[The Ravenian]] slain

==Description==
[[Darkmaster Gandling|Gandling]] has brought his lieutenant, the Ravenian, with him. This lumbering brute is far more dangerous than any of the other [[Scourge]] you will find upon the battlefield... even the [[abomination]]s.

You will find the Ravenian within a tower near the southern end of town. I recommend caution before fighting him, <name>. He will not be a pushover.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|10}}

==Progress==
I will not rest until the [[Lich King]]'s taint is lifted from Andorhal.

==Completion==
Excellently done, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Western Plaguelands storyline}}
