==Objectives==
Kill Rattlegore within Andorhal.
*[[Rattlegore]] slain

==Description==
Gandling has brought his lieutenant, Rattlegore, with him. This clattering horror is far more dangerous than any of the other Scourge you will find upon the battlefield... even the abominations.

You will find Rattlegore within an old [[town hall|town-hall]] building, near the center of town. I recommend caution before fighting him, <name>. He will not be a pushover. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|10}}

==Completion==
Excellently done, <name>. 

==Progression==
{{Western Plaguelands storyline}}
