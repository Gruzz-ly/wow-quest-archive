==Objectives==
Bring the Battered Weapons and Armor to [[Thurman Grant]] at the [[Writhing Haunt]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].
*[[Battered Weapons and Armor]] (provided)

==Description==
The farmers traveled to the Writhing Haunt, an old farm to the northeast, across the river. Someone needs to keep an eye on them.

Bring them those rusty weapons and armor you found. We can't have them fighting with pitchforks.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||20}}

==Progress==
Did Valorfist send you?  He doesn't know when to let up, does he?

==Completion==
Well, now that you're here, we'll gladly take that armor off your hands.

You can keep the weapons, though.  These men wouldn't know which end to hold.
