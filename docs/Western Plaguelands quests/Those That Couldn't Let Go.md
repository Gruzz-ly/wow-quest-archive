==Objectives==
Use the Holy Thurible on 12 Withdrawn Spirits in [[Sorrow Hill]], and slay them if they react negatively.
*[[Withdrawn Soul]] released (12)
*[[Holy Thurible]] (provided)

==Description==
Sorrow Hill, up the road to the northeast, was one of the first places that the [[Argent Crusade]]rs and [[Cenarion Circle]] were able to heal. The area is now freed of the [[Scourge]].

However, there are still many specters of the past that, for some reason, have not passed on into the next world. They may be mourning, they may have unfinished business... or they may just be lost.

Take my thurible and use it to douse them with holy incense. One way or another, we will help them move onto the next plane.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3,500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Thank you in advance for your assistance, <class>.

==Completion==
Hopefully most of them passed on peacefully.  I thank you, <name>. 

==Notes==
A thurible is a metal censer (incense burner) suspended from chains.  Incense is placed on the charcoal burning in the censer, which is then swung, wafting the burning incense smoke towards the someone or some thing.  "Dowsing with holy incense" is a description heavy in artistic license.
