==Objectives==
Kill 20 plagued wildlife with {{npc||Zen'Kiki}} by your side. You may kill [[Hulking Plaguebear]]s, [[Diseased Wolf|Diseased Wolves]], [[Venom Mist Lurker]]s, or [[Plague Lurker]]s.

Return to the [[Menders' Stead]] if you become separated from Zen'Kiki.
*Wildlife killed with Zen'Kiki (20)

==Description==
I am [[Adrine Towhide]], a [[druid]] of the [[Cenarion Circle]]. You can thank us for healing this land, where once there was only death.

We accept all who choose to follow the druidic path, regardless of race, faction, or talent. Occasionally that means we enlist a druid who needs more help than others.

I'd like you to meet Zen'Kiki. He's pretty new, and he's still learning his craft. Would you mind taking him out with you for a while? You can practice combat on the plagued animals that roam nearby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*4,600 [[XP]]
*+700 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Zen'kiki needs a ... a big (brother/sister), like you to help him gain some confidence.

==Completion==
It looks like Zen'Kiki is still having a little bit of trouble with his shapeshifting. 

==Notes==
Most of the time, Zen'kiki will only use [[Wrath]]. However, he also randomly shifts into a druid form during fights.

*[[Aquatic Form]]: Obviously, this is useless on land. He can only lie on his back and shake his flippers.
*[[Cat Form]]: Zen'kiki randomly jumps around, pouncing and raking, but nowhere near the enemy. After that, he says: "Get back over here!"
*[[Bear Form]]: He turns his rear towards the enemy and starts mauling and swiping. After a while, he asks: "Am I hitting him?"
*[[Moonkin Form]]: While in Moonkin Form, Zen'kiki spams [[Moonfire]]... on himself. At about half health, he shifts back to caster.
