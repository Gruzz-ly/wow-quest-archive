==Objectives==
Find someone who can tell you more about the Blood of the Lightbringer.
*[[Blood of the Lightbringer]] (provided)

==Description==
Your hand trembles slightly as you hold the small vial of blood. Aside from the inscription on the label, you can feel a warmth and energy radiating from the sample. Could this truly be the blood of the legendary hero, [[Uther the Lightbringer]]? You should find someone who can verify the authenticity of this sample.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Peace be with you, <class>.

==Completion==
Wait, what is that you have there?

<High Priest Thel'danis' eyes go wide as he examines the reliquary>

Surely this cannot be. How would the [[black dragon]]s obtain a sample of Lord Uther's blood?

If this is genuine, this would become a relic of profound importance. Let us speak further on this.
