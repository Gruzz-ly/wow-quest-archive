==Objectives==
Talk to [[Gregory]] in [[Andorhal]] and ask him to accompany you to the Burning of Andorhal.

==Description==
[[Demon]]s invading and death rituals! That all sounds very scary. Luckily this handy little time bubble we are standing in makes connecting ourselves to a specific point in time at this location easy.

This will be dangerous, though. When you and your friend are ready, say the word.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
It's really happening then...

As much as I hate to admit it, I don't think that I'm the best person to go back with you. My body has suffered too much damage between [[Aeonas]]' holy fire and the demon attack. In my current state I'm more likely to slow you down than to help. With Ada dead I think we might need outside aid.

==Notes==
You must talk to Chromie before this quest becomes available:
{{dialogue|
{{gossip|Chromie, may you help me travel back in time to the time when Andorhal was destroyed?}}
{{dialogue-child|
That sounds dangerous, both to you and the timeline. I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

What do you need in the past?

{{gossip|<Explain the events involving your attempts to destroy the [[Echoing Orb]]s and what occurred in {{C|Winterspring}}>}}
{{dialogue-child|
Hmm, that is troubling. It goes against my better judgement, but there will come a time that you prove yourself to me to be a trustworthy and responsible [[paladin]]. Yes, I will help.

You must take care in the past. Interfering with past events can have disastrous consequences on the future! Let me know when you are ready, and I'll open a portal to allow you to timewalk to the day that Andorhal burned.

I hope that the current you is just as trustworthy as the future you.

{{gossip|Thank you, Chromie. I promise not to step on any butterflies while I'm there.}}
{{dialogue-child|
Right.

The portal is no problem, but it's keeping you anchored to this time that can be problematic. I think I can maintain a connection with you and one other person, and even spare a bit of magic to glamour some convincing disguises onto you. You'll just want to hurry, as if you linger too long my magic may start to fade.
