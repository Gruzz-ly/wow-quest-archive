==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Opengut Behemoths in [[Andorhal]].
*[[Opengut Behemoth]] slain (6)

==Description==
You fools will never defeat the [[Scourge]] with those [[abomination]]s running around. Koltira blathers on about reducing their numbers, but the Scourge's best weapon here in Andorhal can be found in those lumbering brutes that are throwing my deathguards around like ragdolls.

I won't have it. <name>, enter the battlefield and destroy those monsters. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gut Opener Gloves
|Behemoth Boots#Horde
|Belt of the Blathering Fool
|Bracers of Favorable Chance
|Putrid Mail Boots#Horde
|Belt of Recklessness
}}

You will also receive: {{cost||75}}

==Progress==
How long must I wait before you've done my bidding, <race>?

==Completion==
With the behemoths out of the way, our victory against the Scourge is inevitable.

Our current chances against the Alliance aren't quite as favorable... but that's no concern of yours. Not yet, anyhow.
