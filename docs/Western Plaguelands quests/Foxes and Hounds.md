==Objectives==
Kill 4 Alliance Fox Hunters, 4 Bullmastiffs, and 4 Whitetail Foxes in [[Western Plaguelands]].
*[[Alliance Fox Hunter]] slain (4)
*[[Bullmastiff]] slain (4)
*[[Whitetail Fox]] slain (4)

==Description==
These [[Alliance]] forces walk around the Plaguelands like they own the place. Well, they don't! This land rightfully belongs to the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]]!

As the [[battle for Andorhal]] drew to a close, the Alliance forces occupying the Plaguelands scattered. Several of them can be found just east of here, hunting foxes. Prove to them that this is [[Forsaken]] territory.

Kill the hunters. Kill their hunting dogs. And kill the foxes they hunt, for good measure. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
The Dark Lady will not tolerate the living.

==Completion==
It's a relief to have those hunters out of the way. We're not done killing Alliance, however...
