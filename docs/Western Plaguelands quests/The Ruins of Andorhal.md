==Objectives==
Take the Blood of the Lightbringer and explore Andorhal.
*Explore [[Andorhal]] and see if the blood reacts

==Description==
Remains such as the one you carry tend to have mysterious properties. Some particularly powerful relics may even seem sentient or have a personality at times, particularly in proximity to individuals and places closely tied to their living selves.

If [[Blood of the Lightbringer|this]] truly is [[Uther]]'s blood, there is a chance it may react when near to the place Uther died. Explore the town and see what happens.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Have you explored Andorhal yet? Did the blood react in any way?

==Completion==
So there is no doubt then, the blood is authentic. What you have there is a treasure, <class>. Take care and protect it with your life.

==Notes==
To complete the quest, interact with the [[Damaged Silver Hand Breastplate]] in [[Andorhal]], which will cause [[Uther]]'s spirit to appear. [[Aeonas]] will arrive a moment later.

:{{text|say|Aeonas|This is where he met his end, <name>. I'm sure you know that part. He oversaw the final defenses of the city and in the end was overwhelmed and murdered by his most promising pupil, [[Arthas Menethil]]. I have many regrets in my life, but chief among them is that I was not here, shoulder to shoulder with him and rest of my brothers at the end.}}
:{{text|say|Aeonas|There is no doubt. That truly is the blood of Uther the Lightbringer. We both know how powerful blood can be, this might be the key to finishing Gregory's ritual. I can think of none more heroic that Uther... and none more coldly betrayed.}}
:{{text|say|Aeonas|Yes, I know Gregory is alive. I know he has the [[Echoing Orb|orb]], and I know that he approached you. I suspect that this is more than mere coincidence. It's providence.}}
:{{text|say|Aeonas|It's of course up to you to decide if you trust Gregory enough to help him or not. Whatever you do, just be careful and watch your back. I don't actually think he means you harm, but I've misjudged him before.}}
:{{text|say|Aeonas|I'm very glad I decided to come here and witness this, a fleeting encounter though it was. It reinforces that I'm on the right path. Perhaps for the first time in a long time.}}
:{{text|say|Aeonas|You should return to Thel'danis now. He will be interested to hear about this encounter. Good luck, paladin.}}

After turning in the quest:
:{{text|say|Aeonas|Please, <name>. Speak with me before you go.}}
