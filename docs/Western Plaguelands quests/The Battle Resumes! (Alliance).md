The quest [[Combat Training]] is a prerequisite for this quest, though the breadcrumb quest that leads you to the NPC offering it is different.

==Objectives==
Report to [[Thassarian]] at [[Andorhal]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].

==Description==
Word is in from Andorhal, <name>. The battle has resumed.

It has become somewhat well-known among the Alliance forces that you are a hero of the first battle of Andorhal. Thassarian has requested your presence immediately. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5}}
*440 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Word has it that you helped those farmers arm themselves. Well, now they've initiated the attack without my order! They've forced my hand. 

The battle has resumed. This time, we fight the [[Forsaken]]...and I fight [[Koltira]], my old brother of the [[Ebon Blade]].
