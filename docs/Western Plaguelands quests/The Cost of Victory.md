==Objectives==
Consecrate your weapon with the Blood of the Lightbringer and defeat Azgaloth in {{sod|Demon Fall Canyon}}.
*Consecrate your weapon and slay [[Azgaloth]]
*[[Blood of the Lightbringer (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
Thank you... for bringing me this. The blade is consecrated and will cause me considerable pain to wield, but that seems a small sacrifice to make for my... my friend.

Grief comes later. For now, it's time to end this. Gather your most trusted allies and go to Demon Fall Canyon. Azgaloth may not reveal himself to you immediately, but if you issue a suitable challenge, he will answer.

Take the blood and use it to consecrate your weapon and destroy him. For [[Aeonas]], and for [[Ada Darkhardt|Ada]], it's time to end this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
...<!--Actual dialogue, not just a placeholder.-->

==Completion==
My mission is complete at long last.

This has consumed me for so long now that I haven't really considered what that victory really means.  I suppose this means our alliance is at an end and I should be on my way back to [[Northrend]]...

<An uneasy silence hangs between you>

==Notes==
Using the Blood of the Lightbringer will apply the {{abilities|Consecrated Weapon|icon=ability_paladin_sanctifiedwrath|id=469647|classic=}} buff for 1 hour. Slay Azgaloth in Demon Fall Canyon with this buff active to complete the quest. Gregory will appear nearby.

==Progression==
{{Blood of the Lightbringer}}
