==Objectives==
Speak with [[Chromie]] in [[Andorhal]] and convince her to help you.

==Description==
What we need to finish this mission exists right here in Andorhal, it just isn't here right now.

The room behind me contains a "[[gnome]]" named Chromie.

She's a rather curious creature who is is{{sic}} known to utilize a very special type of draconic magic. [[Time]] magic, in point of fact. If we could convince her to use her magic to help us, we might be able to reach through time briefly and get what we need. It's a gambit, but it just might be our only option. See if you can convince her to lend us her aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
It's great to see you again, <name>! At least I think we've met already. We've met right? It gets hard to keep track of all the different versions of each person I've met... or will meet.

==Progression==
{{Blood of the Lightbringer}}
