==Objectives==
Mount a [[Hearthglen Mustang]] near the [[Northridge Lumber Mill]], then use its Whinny ability to send 10 Northridge Spiders to the [[Hearthglen]] Recruits at the Northridge Lumber Mill. You can round up several spiders at once.
*[[Northridge Spider]] lured to Lumber Mill (10)

==Description==
The [[Tirion Fordring|Highlord]] was generous enough to send some of his recruits to protect us here at the mill. With your horsemanship skills, and their martial prowess, we can do away with this spider problem easily.

Hop back on that mustang and scare those spiders again, but this time, scare them all the way up here to the mill. These Hearthglen recruits can handle things from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Band of the Arachnid Wrangler|Spider Frier|Spider Splatter Mace}}

==Progress==
I don't need you to kill the spiders... that's what these soldiers are for.  Think of it as killing two birds with one stone:  we're getting rid of the spiders, and the recruits are getting valuable combat experience.

==Completion==
That's much more like it!  Now my lumberjacks can get to work again.

Nice riding out there, <name>.  You cut a pretty impressive silhouette on that mustang.
