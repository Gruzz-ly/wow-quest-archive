{{questportrait|Daria L'Rayne.jpg|Daria L'Rayne|You'll want to head back to town to gather information.}}
Speak with Morris Vant, Outfitter Mendelev, Bree Ironstock, and High Cleric Alphus within Hearthglen.

*Speak with [[Bree Ironstock]]
*Speak with [[High Cleric Alphus]]

==Description==
See those reagents over there? And these supplies right here? Those belong to the Argent Crusade.

Gnolls are known for thievery, but as far as I know, Hearthglen hasn't had any incursions since the Redpine came. Very suspicious.

I know a few helpful folks within Hearthglen: Morris Vant, Outfitter Mendelev, Bree Ironstock, and High Cleric Alphus. All can be trusted, and are well-connected. Question them, to find out if they know anything about these lost supplies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3700 [[XP]]
*+325 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
Oh, hi there.

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Daria L'Rayne.jpg|Daria L'Rayne|Bisp is our man.}}
Did you notice, <name>?  Many names were mentioned, but one name was mentioned far more than the others.

Bisp.

==Notes==
;Outfitter Mendelev
{{gossip|Have you noticed anything strange lately?  Any new customers, buying anything suspicious?}}
:What is this, an interrogation?  You're not one of [[Tirion Fordring|Fordring's]] internal affairs guys, are you?

:Well, I've got nothing to hide.  Let me look over my records.  Last week I sold a ball gown to [[Lieutenant Myner]], which struck me as odd.  What else... [[Magus Bisp]] bought several dozen leather jerkins, which he couldn't give a reason for.  Oh, and [[Friar Burlingham]] came by to stock up on swimwear for his trip to [[Hardwrench Hideaway]].  That's about it.

:Now if you don't mind, I have customers!

;Morris Vant
{{gossip|Have you noticed anything strange lately?  Any new customers in the [[blacksmith]] shop?}}
:Well, let's see... I saw some drudges running away from that mine over there.  Said something about a spider.  New customers?  Well, there's [[Jeralee]], the lovely young gnome who bought an axe twice her size last week.  Oh, and Magus Bisp came by asking for armor.  Not sure why he'd need plate armor...

; Bree Ironstock
{{gossip|Hello, ma'am.  Heard any interesting rumors lately?}}
:Well, let's see.  I heard that Magus Bisp has been spending his time cooped up on top of his tower, working on some new spell, or something.

:I heard that [[Del Gahrron]] was [[The Long Trip Home|planning on retiring]] and heading back to his farm.  He may have already left, in fact.

:Oh, and I heard that there's some <race> <class> running around town asking people asll sorts of annoying questions!

:Just playing with you, love.  Hope that information helped.

; High Cleric Alphus
{{gossip|I'm looking for someone who may have stolen some supplies from Hearthglen.  Have any leads for me?}}
:Stolen supplies?  Well, let me think about it...

:I know a certain priest named [[Daria L'Rayne|Daria]] who took all the extra wine after last week's service, but didn't throw it out as I asked.  I believe she'll be apologizing soon, though.

:<Alphus winks at you.>

:I've also heard an abnormal number of confessions this week from one of the mages... what was his name?  Crisp?  Lisp?  Something along those lines.

:Now, be on your way.
