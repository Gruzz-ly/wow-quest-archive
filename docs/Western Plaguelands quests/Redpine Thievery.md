==Objectives==
Retrieve 10 piles of Northridge Lumber from the Redpine Camp in [[Western Plaguelands]].
*[[Northridge Lumber]] (10)

==Description==
Farther to the south, you will find [[Redpine tribe|Redpine gnolls]]... a new arrival to the area. You probably passed some on your way here. Nathaniel pretends like they're not a problem, but I know better.

I've seen them running away with our lumber at night. I don't know what they'd do with lumber - they don't seem particularly handy - but that doesn't stop them from stealing it. Head down to their camps and steal that lumber back.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progress==
Some of the older [[lumberjack]]s tell me that the Redpine lived in the area several years ago, but left when the plague arrived.  That doesn't make it OK for them to steal, though.

==Completion==
I'll just put this back over in the lumber stores outside.  [[Nathaniel Dumah|Nathaniel]] probably won't even notice it was missing.

==Progression==
