Kill 10 Redpine Looters.

==Description==
Greetings. How do you do? My name is Daria.

I am one of the priests in charge of preserving the peace here in [[Hearthglen]]. One of my duties involves maintaining the [[Taelan's Tower|tower]] down the trail to the southeast of Hearthglen. This particular tower is of personal importance to the [[Tirion Fordring|Highlord]]. It's the place where his son was killed.

With the recent incursion of [[gnoll]]s, however, maintenance of the tower has grown difficult. Will you help me rid the trail of some of these gnoll vandals, so I can do my duty?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

Welcome back.

I must admit, <name>... I have been using my mind vision spell to keep tabs on you.  And I must say... the number of gnolls you found on the trail is truly staggering!
