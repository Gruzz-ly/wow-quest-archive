==Objectives==
Travel to the farm house in [[Gahrron's Withering]] and gather any mementos you can find.
* [[Gahrron Prayer Book]]
* [[Faded Finger Painting]]

==Description==
It's funny the things you remember. I spent 16 hours a day working the fields, and every seventh day I'd head into bustling [[Andorhal]] to sell what I'd grown. It was a tough life, but we did alright.

But I barely remember any of that. When I think back to those days, I think about [[Gloria Gahrron|Gloria]]'s smile, or [[Andrea Gahrron|Andrea]] waving from the window whenever I'd look up from the plow.

The farm's just a bit to the east, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go back, <name>. I'd just like to make sure I hold on to these memories.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Andrea's Locket
|Gahrron's Shoulderguard
|Gloria's Work Vest
|Footfalls of Memories
|Del's Discarded Shoulderguard
|Dusty Gahrron Chainmail
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
I wouldn't expect you to indulge the whims of a nostalgic old man, <name>. Still, if you find yourself in the area...

==Completion==
This... Gloria used to read from this prayer book every night! How had I forgotten?  She was so devout, <name>.

&lt;Del's eyes turn to the finger painting.&gt;

Oh...

This painting... my daughter, Andrea... she loved to... to paint...

== Notes ==
On completion:
:{{text|say|Del Gahrron|Th... thank you.}}

The prayer book is by the bed upstairs.  The painting is tacked to the fireplace chimney downstairs.
