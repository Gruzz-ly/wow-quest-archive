==Description==
Allow me to concentrate for a moment.

<You feel Daria's mind vision travel elsewhere, then it returns to you.>

Further down the trail, south of [[Taelan's Tower]], the [[gnoll]]s have carved out a small meeting area to the east of the main road. Something is happening there... I'm not certain what. We should investigate. I will look for anything out of the ordinary... you just protect yourself.

==Progress==
Why, hello!

==Completion==

Gnolls and necromancy... what a surprise!  And I thought that, here in the Western Plaguelands, we had put these dark days behind us.

<You sense Daria's eyes focusing on something on the ground.>

Wait... what is THAT?
