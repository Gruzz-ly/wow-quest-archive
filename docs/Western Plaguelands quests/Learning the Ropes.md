==Objectives==
Mount a [[Hearthglen Mustang]] at [[Northridge Lumber Mill]], then use its [[Hearthglen Mustang#Ability|Whinny]] ability to frighten 25 Northridge Spiders.
*[[Northridge Spider]]s frightened (25)

==Description==
Ah, it's good to be back in Northridge! I've got my mill, my beautiful [[Kelly Dumah|wife]], a bouncing baby boy... I've even put in my hat with the [[Argent Crusade]]. We'll be supplying [[Tirion Fordring|Tirion]]'s forces with lumber.

My [[lumberjack]]s were being exceptionally productive, too... up until the point when the spiders came. Now they refuse to go any deeper in the woods.

Maybe you can help me out. Hop on one of my horses and use it to frighten those spiders. Maybe we can avoid bloodshed and just scare them away.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progress==
The spiders tend to be a little skittish.  One of the mustangs should be enough to scare them away.

==Completion==
Well, it sounds like they're certainly afraid of the mustang, but they're not leaving for good.  I can't have you running around on a horse forever.  Nor do I think you'd want to.

Fine.  Bloodshed it is.
