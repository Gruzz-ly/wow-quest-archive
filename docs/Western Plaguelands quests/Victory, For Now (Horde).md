==Objectives==
Report to [[High Executor Derrington]] at the [[Bulwark]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
The [[Forsaken]] are victorious, and our forces are still strong. Military strategy dictates that we attack the [[Alliance]] now, while they are recovering and unaware. I have other plans, however...

We will wait. We attack [[Thassarian]] and his troops when the time is right. In the meantime, speak with [[Rhonda Molver|Rhonda]] and take a flight to the Bulwark, on the [[Plaguelands]]' western border. High Executor Derrington will give you your next assignment.

You will hear from me when you are needed again in Andorhal. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Completion==
Word arrived shortly before you did, <name>. With the [[Scourge]] ejected from Andorhal, the Forsaken has cemented its foothold in [[Lordaeron]].

==Progression==
