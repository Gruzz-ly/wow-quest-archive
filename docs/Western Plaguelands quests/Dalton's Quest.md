==Objectives==
Speak with Squire Cuthbert to learn more about Sir Dalton's quest.
*Speak with [[Squire Cuthbert]]

==Description==
<Squire Cuthbert stares blankly at the spot where Dalton's body burns. He is clearly in a kind of shock. You can tell that he is no fit state to continue on whatever quest he and his lord set out to complete. Perhaps you should speak with him and see if you can be of more aid?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5650 [[XP]]
*[[Dalton's Horn]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*+100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I... thank you.

==Completion==
I... don't know what to say. Despite the dour circumstances, it is beyond good fortune I find myself in the service another true hero of the [[Alliance]]. I can only hope that I am able to serve you better than I served Sir Dalton.

Lead on, hero.
