==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Squire Cuthbert]]'s sword in the field to the south and return it to him.
*[[Squire Cuthbert's Blade]]

==Description==
You nearly scared me to death! I heard you coming and was convinced the dead had finally sniffed me out! All the same, you are a sight for sore eyes. Please, I need to escape this place and find my master, Sir [[Dalton]]. May you retrieve my weapon for me? It was torn from my grip in the field outside and I was forced to flee into this barn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5650 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*+100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the blade?

==Completion==
Thank you, paladin.  I can't express my gratitude for your aid.

I need but a moment to gather my wits about me. I took a terrible blow to the head out there and I'm not sure how well I can fight just yet. Oh light help me, I hope Sir Dalton is safe.

==Notes==
Before you can accept this quest, you must first find the {{sod|Fallen Knight}} just outside the farm.

==Progression==
{{The Fallen Knight}}
