==Objectives==
Travel to [[Andorhal]] and locate [[Gregory]] to learn what to do next.
*[[Empty Reliquary]] (provided)

==Description==
Time is now against us. The [[dreadlord]] mentioned [[Demon Fall Canyon]], so the good news is we know where they are headed. The bad news is that we've likely strengthened [[Azgaloth]]'s anchor to [[Azeroth]] with our failed ritual. Even if we slay Azgaloth now, he would soon manifest himself again.

I have an idea. It's desperate, but it might be our only hope. There's someone in Andorhal with a very particular set of skills that might be able to help, but we'll need to build some trust with her first.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
You made it, good.

==Completion==
The reliquary of [[Uther]]'s blood was the key to that ritual, but it was unfortunately lost in the attack. As I said before, this magic is all about building and breaking connections. If we could find another sample of that blood we use could against Azgaloth's physical form and slay him to banish his soul from Azeroth completely.

How much do you know about [[bronze dragon]]s?

==Progression==
{{Blood of the Lightbringer}}
