==Objectives==
Go to [[Gahrron's Withering]] in [[Western Plaguelands]] to locate and defeat the [[Cauldron Lord Soulwrath|Cauldron Lord]] present there, and use its key to gain access to the cauldron.

*[[Empty Gahrron's Withering Bottle]] (Provided)
*[[Gahrron's Withering Cauldron Key]]

==Description==
My analysis is complete!  The [[Blight (plague)|blight]] that affects the animals here is no residual disease.  No, it is something new... and I think I know what it is.

The [[Cult of the Damned]] maintains a plague cauldron on a farm called Gahrron's Withering.

This farm is due southeast of us, close to where the [[Eastern Plaguelands]] begin.  I need a sample from this cauldron to verify my suspicions.

Eliminate the cauldron lord present there for its key.  You will then be able to access the cauldron and obtain my sample.

:''(Cauldron Lord Soulwrath: Get the key from the cauldron lord, then activate the cauldron.)''

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|2000}} (+{{coppercost|1200}} at max level)

==Progress==
An access panel to the cauldron remains securely fastened.  In order to open it, you will need to find the key.

==Completion==
Cauldron Lord Soulwrath's key disintegrates as it touches the lock on the access panel at the base of the cauldron's platform.  A slight clanking noise is heard within, and the access panel swings open to reveal more viscous toxins within the cauldron's framework.

There is a small spigot that the bottle fits well enough under, allowing you to draw a sample for Field Agent Kaartish back at the Menders' Stead.
