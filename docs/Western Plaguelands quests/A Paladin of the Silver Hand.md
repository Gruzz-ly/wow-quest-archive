==Objectives==
Go to [[Uther's Tomb]] and explain the situation to Aeonas.
*Speak with [[Aeonas]]

==Description==
I said that I don't believe in fate, but I don't know if that was entirely true. My perspective has changed so much since my mortal life ended, but the longer I spend on this mission, the more I start to see patterns and connections in things. I think you know this already, but its{{sic}} Aeonas that has to go with you.

Believe me when I say I'd like nothing more than to leave my old friend in peace, but this is bigger than what I want. Go to Uther's Tomb and explain the situation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
<[[Gregory]] nods at you, and then at Aeonas in turn>

It's time. <name> go speak with [[Chromie]] when you are ready.

==Notes==
Find Aeonas at Uther's Tomb:
{{dialogue|
{{gossip|Aeonas, I need your help one last time.

:<You tell Aeonas everything that has happened since last you met.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
That is quite the tale, <name>.

<Aeonas pauses and quietly considers what you've just said>

Yes. I'll do it. I'll go. I believe that fate... the light... something is moving us in this direction together. No sense swimming against the current.

{{gossip|Thank you, Aeonas. I'm proud to have you by my side for this.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I'm right behind you, <name>.
