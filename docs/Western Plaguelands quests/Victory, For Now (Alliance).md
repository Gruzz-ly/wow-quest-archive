==Objectives==
Report to [[Commander Ashlam Valorfist]] at [[Chillwind Camp]] in [[Western Plaguelands]]. 

==Description==
The Alliance are victorious, and our forces are still strong. Military strategy dictates that we attack the Forsaken now, while they are recovering and unaware. I made a deal, however...

We will wait. We attack Koltira and his troops when the time is right. In the meantime, speak with Ginny Goodwin and take a flight to the Chillwind Camp, to our south. Commander Ashlam Valorfist will give you your next assignment.

You will hear from me when you are needed again in Andorhal.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Completion==
Word arrived shortly before you did, <name>.  With the Scourge ejected from Andorhal, we are one step closer to retaking Lordaeron.

==Progression==
