This short but convoluted chain of quests starts at a [[Locked Cabinet]] upstairs in the house at [[Dalson's Tears]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].  There, you discover a locked cabinet, with no key.  So, you start looking around for a key.

; [[Mrs. Dalson's Diary (quest)]]
In the nearby barn, you find [[Mrs. Dalson's Diary]].  She describes that she locked her (newly undead) husband in the outhouse.  ... and then belatedly remembered that he kept the key on him.

You go to the outhouse...
;[[Locked Away]]

:''Clicking on the outhouse summons the [[Wandering Skeleton]].  The Wandering Skeleton will drop [[Dalson Outhouse Key]], but only if you have read the diary.''

You slay the wandering skeleton (the mortal remains of Mrs Dalson, one would guess), and open the outhouse.  Inside is a ghoul,  the late, lamented [[Farmer Dalson]].

You slay him as well, and find the [[Dalson Cabinet Key]] on his body.

;[[Locked Away (2)]]

With the cabinet key in hand, you unlock the cabinet and retrieve the valuables that the Dalsons are no longer in any need of.
