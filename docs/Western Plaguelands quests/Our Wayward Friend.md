==Objectives==
Find Aeonas near [[Sorrow Hill]] in the {{C|Western Plaguelands}}.
*Find [[Aeonas]]

==Description==
I'm glad you are here, <name>. We've got word that a traveler matching the description of our friend Aeonas has been seen near [[Chillwind Camp]], heading in the direction of Sorrow Hill.

After what happened in {{C|felwood}} I wanted to give him space but there are those in [[Knights of the Silver Hand|the order]] who still distrust him, and at some point he's going to need to come in from the cold to explain why he withheld his prolonged involvement with a [[Gregory|known agent]] of the [[Lich King]]. Go and find him, see if you can convince him to come in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
I had a feeling you'd turn up sooner or later. Sorry to disappoint you, but its{{sic}} not quite time for me to come back yet. That's the best part about being a "former" member of the Silver hand; I don't answer to anyone in the order anymore.

At some point I'll come back but for now please tell Katherine that I've acknowledged her request but I am not ready just yet.
