==Objectives==
Take the Blood of the Lightbringer to [[Gregory]] in [[Caer Darrow]] in {{C|Western Plaguelands}}.
*[[Blood of the Lightbringer]] (provided)

==Description==
I can already tell that you intend to bring the blood to Gregory. Good. My judgement has been questionable at best, and this was always a younger [[paladin]]'s game that I've just been playing at.

I'm still not sure of how to feel, but I'm certainly happy to see that you've grown into the paladin you were always meant to be.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
I wasn't expecting to see you back here again, at least not this soon. What is it?

==Progression==
{{Blood of the Lightbringer}}
