==Objectives==
Take the portal to the Burning of Andorhal.
*Speak with [[Aeonas]]

==Description==
The portal is ready.

Once you enter, you'll be transported to [[Andorhal]], just after it fell. In order to help you blend in a bit better, I've prepared some magical disguises for you. These will do for most of the denizens of the past but you'll still want to be careful to not get noticed. When you have what you need just make your way back to this place in the past. The portal should be waiting for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
We made it. Steel yourself, <name>.

==Notes==
The nearby Portal To The Past will send you to the [[Burning of Andorhal]], disguised as a [[ghoul]].

Aeonas can be found standing over the corpse of [[Ballador the Bright]].
:{{text|say|Aeonas|Oh, Ballador. I felt much kinship with him. He and I shared a more quiet, introspective demeanor. He had a charismatic way with words though and when he did speak, everyone around him listened. Rest easy, brother.}}
