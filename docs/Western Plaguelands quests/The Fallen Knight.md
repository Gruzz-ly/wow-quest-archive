==Objectives==
Lead [[Squire Cuthbert]] to the body of the Fallen Knight you found earlier and help him burn the corpse. If you lose Squire Cuthbert he will make his way back to his hiding place in the barn at [[Dalson's Tears]] and wait for you there.
*{{sod|Fallen Knight}} burned

==Description==
You say you found his... body? No... my lord cannot be dead. Our work is not yet finished.

I... thank you, paladin. I'm struggling to shake of the shock of it, but I am glad that you were the one to find him.

It seems that his quest now falls to me. First however, I must return to his body and burn it lest he become the very thing he sought to destroy. If I may impose upon you once more, would you please lead me to the place where Sir Dalton fell?

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*Engrave Cloak - [[Righteous Vengeance (paladin rune)]]

You will also receive:
*5650 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*+100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
It seems I am again in your debt, paladin. Even seeing his body like that, it's hard to believe this is real. I've been in Sir Dalton's service since I was a boy, but I feel like I still have so much to learn if I wish to finish what Sir Dalton started.

I cannot hope to keep you now. You've already honored me beyond measure with your kind aid. Please, let me impose upon you no longer. I will find my way from here, somehow.

==Notes==
