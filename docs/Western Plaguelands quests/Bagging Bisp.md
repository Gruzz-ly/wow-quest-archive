==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Daria L'Rayne.jpg|Daria L'Rayne|Hopefully we can avoid combat with Bisp. He's quite skilled.}}
Speak with Magus Bisp atop the [[mage tower]] in [[Hearthglen]].
*[[Magus Bisp]] "spoken with"

==Description==
Magus Bisp is one of Hearthglen's most preeminent arcanists. To imagine that he would be interacting with gnolls... and dabbling in necromancy? Unthinkable.

You'll find him atop the tower near Hearthglen's main gate. Hopefully he'll have an explanation for all of this. If not, well... I wouldn't go to the top of that tower unprepared, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progress==
Hey!

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Daria L'Rayne.jpg|Daria L'Rayne|Bisp, gnolls and necromancy... oh my.}}
I suppose that we can take his aggression as an admission of guilt.  You alright, <name>? 

==Notes==
; Magus Bisp
:W-what are you doing up here, <race>?  Can't you see you're interfering with OFFICIAL ARGENT CRUSADE BUSINESS!?
{{gossip|I was just wondering what you knew about the gnolls to the south.  Someone has been giving them supplies to practice necromancy.}}
