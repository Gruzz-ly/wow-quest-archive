==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Daria L'Rayne.jpg|Daria L'Rayne|You should really speak with Tirion, before he finds out what you did.}}
Report to {{NPC||Highlord Tirion Fordring}} at [[Hearthglen]] in [[Western Plaguelands]]. 

==Description==
So... you killed a member of the Argent Crusade, inside of Hearthglen. Usually that's not smiled upon, even in self-defense.

I recommend you come back to [[Mardenholde Keep]], and turn yourself in to Highlord Fordring. Hopefully he will hear you out, and will be sympathetic with your situation. I hope I haven't gotten you in any trouble.

==Completion==
I'm already aware of your actions, <name>.  I welcome you into my town, give you my blessing, and what do you do?

You slay the traitor that we've been hunting down for weeks.  Well done.  Your heroism is budding much earlier than even I had anticipated.

==Rewards==
You may choose one of:
{{Itembox||Highlord's Favor|Light-Imbued Lantern|Argent Medallion}}

==Progression==
{{Western Plaguelands storyline}}

==Patch changes==
