==Objectives==
Kill 10 Forsaken Outriders.
*[[Forsaken Outrider]] slain (10)

==Description==
I told [[Ashlam Valorfist|Commander Valorfist]] that we could hold our own, and we intend to. I had a little conversation with the death knight general, [[Thassarian]], on my way over here. We farmers plan to help in our own way.

We will take control of this farm, begin to cultivate the land... and then when the battle for [[Andorhal]] commences, we will attack the [[Forsaken]] from the rear. They'll never expect it.

First, we need to get rid of these Forsaken outriders. Kill some, then return to me. 

==Progress==
My men need your help, <name>.

==Completion==
You fight well, <race>.  My men could stand to learn a few moves from an experienced <class> like you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}
