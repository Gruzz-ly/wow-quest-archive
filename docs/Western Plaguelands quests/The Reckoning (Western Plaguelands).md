==Objectives==
Stand by as [[Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] speaks with [[Koltira Deathweaver]].
*Witness the Reckoning

==Description==
Your performance was admirable, soldier. You make the [[Forsaken]] proud, which is more than I can say for our general, [[Koltira Deathweaver]].

I intend to have a word with that death knight. He has shamed himself and his cause.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pauldrons of Andorhal
|Andorhal Legguards
|Andorhal Tunic
|Staff of Andorhal
|Dagger of Andorhal
|Andorhal Chain Leggings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
I have nothing against the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]], but Koltira needs to be reminded who he works for now.&nbsp; His loyalty must lie with the [[Horde]].

Or, more specifically, the Forsaken.

I wouldn't plan on seeing Koltira anytime soon.&nbsp; Now that I have him... you can rest assured that any bonds he may have had with [[Thassarian|that Alliance scum]] will be thoroughly broken.

:{{text|yell|Koltira Deathweaver|No!}}
:''A hooked chain lashes out from the portal, grasping Koltira and completely immobilizing him.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Shh... quiet, death knight. When I'm finished with you, your fear will be gone.}}
