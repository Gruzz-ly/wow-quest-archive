==Objectives==
Bring the Filled Gahrron's Withering Bottle to [[Field Agent Kaartish]] at the [[Menders' Stead]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].
*[[Filled Gahrron's Withering Bottle]] (provided)

==Description==
You carefully close the spigot in the control panel, watching the cauldron's putrid ichors drip into the empty bottle.

With the poison in hand, it is time to return to Field Agent Kaartish at the Menders' Stead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45}}
*3900 [[XP]]
*+325 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
[[Gahrron's Withering]] houses a viciously potent plague cauldron.  Once we have a sample of the plague it spews forth, we will be able to determine whether the [[Cult of the Damned]] is truly responsible for continuing to poison the land.

==Completion==
Good work.  One moment please...

<The [[draenei]] takes a moment to compare your sample with a sample he presumably had distilled earlier.>

Yes, this appears to be the same corruption that is affecting the wildlife.  With this knowledge, and with your combat expertise, we may have the power to stop this.
