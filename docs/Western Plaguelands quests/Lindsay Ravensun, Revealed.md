==Objectives==
Report to [[Lindsay Ravensun]] at [[Andorhal]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].

==Description==
I was informed that that worthless woman, Lindsay Ravensun, would be here to support me in this battle, but so far, she's done nothing but brood within the basement of the greathall behind me. All the better, I suppose. She was a bit of a distraction.

Still, I cannot and will not stand for insubordination. Find her, and bring her to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||27|75}}
*260 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
You won't be taking me anywhere, <name>.

While Koltira prances about with his playmate, Thassarian, I plan to win this battle.  Then I'll make Koltira suffer for his weakness.

Don't believe me?  Fine, I'll let you in on a little secret...

== Notes ==
;On completion
''Lindsay Ravensun removes her disguise, revealing her true identity as [[Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] herself!''
