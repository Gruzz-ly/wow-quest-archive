This quest completes the [[Paladin]]-only series of quests of the same name: {{questchain|Forging the Mightstone}}.

==Objectives==
Bring the voodoo feathers to Ashlam Valorfist. 
*[[Amber Voodoo Feather]] (2)
*[[Blue Voodoo Feather]] (2)
*[[Green Voodoo Feather]] (2)

==Description==
Now we must combine the [[Inert Scourgestone|inert scourgestones]] and create a weapon to shatter the ranks of undead. This is no trivial task, <name>. Only the trolls of the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Classic)|sunken temple]] carry the kind of rare magic able to turn the evil of something against itself.

In the temple, the trolls are known as [[Gasher]], [[Mijan]], [[Zolo]], [[Hukku]], [[Zul'Lor|Zul'lor]], and [[Loro]]. Do not feel remorse for their corrupt souls... they are not without evil.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*{{cost|1|45|}}
*5900 [[XP]]
*150 [[Reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*[[Holy Mightstone]]
*[[Lightforged Blade]]
*[[Chivalrous Signet]]
*[[Sanctified Orb]]

==Progress==
Have you slain the wretched trolls? 

==Completion==
This is excellent, <name>. I would say I am surprised, but I knew without question that you wouldn't let us down.

It is my honor to bestow one of the [[Holy Mightstone]]s to you. Use it well.

==Notes==
The feathers drop from the [[Atal'ai Defenders]] in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Temple of Atal'Hakkar]]

==Progression==
#[[Chillwind Camp (quest)]]
