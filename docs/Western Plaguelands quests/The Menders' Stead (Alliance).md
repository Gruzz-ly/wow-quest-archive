This version of the quest is only available after completing [[Combat Training (Alliance)]].  An alternate version of the quest is available from [[Argent Officer Pureheart]] in [[Chillwind Camp]] without completing the quests at [[The Writhing Haunt]].

==Objectives==
Report to {{npc||Field Agent Kaartish}} at the [[Menders' Stead]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].

==Description==
I can handle training from here. If you're looking for something else to do, I recommend heading up the road to the northwest. The [[Cenarion Circle|Cenarion druids]] and [[Argent Crusade]] have a small camp set up there, at Dalson's old farm. Maybe they can keep you busy until we need your help again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
*370 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome, <class>.  As you can see, our camp is a joint expedition between Argent Crusade members and Cenarion Circle druids, but we welcome all who wish to help heal the land.

==Progression==
{{Western Plaguelands storyline}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
