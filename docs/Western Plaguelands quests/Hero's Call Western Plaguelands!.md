==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Thassarian}} at [[Andorhal]] in the [[Western Plaguelands]].

==Description==
By order of his royal highness, {{NPC||Varian Wrynn||King Varian Wrynn}}, all able-bodied citizens of the [[Alliance]] are to report to Thassarian at Andorhal.

On the heels of our early victories in Andorhal, the [[Forsaken]] have decided to launch a counterattack. Your help is needed to beat back the [[Scourge]] and Horde and reclaim lost [[Andorhal]].

To reach Andorhal, travel north through the [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] and follow the road beyond [[Chillwind Camp]]. 

For the glory and honor of the Alliance!

==Completion==
There is much to be done here. Both of our enemies are relentless and would slaughter us without mercy the moment we sheathe our blades.
