==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Sides of Bear Meat from [[Shaggy Black Bear]]s in [[Western Plaguelands]].
*[[Side of Bear Meat]] (5)

==Description==
I hail from Westfall, far to the south... as do these men that travel with me. We are farmers, and nothing more.

I had been told that Lordaeron had been healed, and that it was ready for tilling. However, this "Commander" now tells me that it's too dangerous to proceed. He says that there's a war going on, and that the plaguelands still aren't healed.

Before anything else, I need to get some food in my men's stomachs. Anything will do. Bear seems to be plentiful. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bear Hunter's Rifle

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
We've traveled a long way.  Anything you can spare would be appreciated. 

==Completion==
You hunt like a true <class>.  Even if we can't set up our homesteads... at least we can still eat.
