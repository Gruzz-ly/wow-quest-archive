==Objectives==
Kill Diseased Black Bears in Western Plaguelands, then loot 20 Plague Tangles that grow near their corpses.
*[[Plague Tangle]] (20)

==Description==
I need plagued grass for an... an experiment, of sorts. Those Argent Crusaders and those infernal Cenarion druids have done too good a job of healing the plaguelands, however... and I can't find proper reagents within a reasonable walking distance.

Some of the local wildlife retain the plague's touch, however. Kill a diseased black bear, then retrieve the grass that grows where its decaying body lies. It's not optimal, but it'll do. 

==Progress==
Animal tissue holds onto disease so much better than plant tissue, doesn't it?

==Completion==
Glorious! This is the last bit I need.

Actually, stick around, <name>. Let me tell you a little bit more about our plan.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}
