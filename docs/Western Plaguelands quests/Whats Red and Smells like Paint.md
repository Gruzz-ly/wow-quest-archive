==Objective==
Go to [[Hearthglen]] and find a Box of Scarlet Dye.
*[[Box of Scarlet Dye]]

==Description==
These new Land Mines work like a charm, but we can't just be playing saboteur. We're gonna need a few upgrades to our own rides so they don't call foul play. So we need to do the most obvious upgrade there is, a sweet paint job. And you don't even got to ask what color we are using! Hotrod red baby! The fastest color there is! Who know who's got the perfect red tint? Those [[Scarlet Crusade]] jabronis. Why don't you go sneak into Hearthglen and find me some of that nice scarlet dye.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4}}
* 14000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Its got to be the Scarlet Crusade red. Not blood red, not fireball red, not demon Orc red. Scarlet Crusade Red or bust baby!

==Completion==
The tasteful hue of it, the perfect gradient of red. Not even a hint of pink or orange. Just pure red goodness. Oh yeah I can feel us going faster already pal.
