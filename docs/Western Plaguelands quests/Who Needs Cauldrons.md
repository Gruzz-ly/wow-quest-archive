==Description==
Have you seen the condition of Felstone Field? The Alliance forces at Andorhal have taken the area, and they're using it to... to... to grow CROPS!

I almost liked it better when the Scourge held the area. At least they had the sense to put a giant plague cauldron in the middle of the field. 

We're going to take that farm back from these humans, <name>. Take these drums and place them at key locations around the field. I'll be waiting here at the Bulwark. 

==Progress==
I see you're still carrying some of those drums with you, <name>. Don't return until they've all been placed.

==Completion==
<Dithers practically glimmers with excitement.>

The drums are placed? In their positions?

Very well then, I will give the word to the High Executor. When the time is ready, he will be the one to press the ignition switch.
