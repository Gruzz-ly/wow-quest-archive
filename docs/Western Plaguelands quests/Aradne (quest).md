==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Aradne.jpg|Aradne|She leads the val'kyr in Andorhal.  This is our only hope...}}
Slay Aradne atop the tower in western [[Andorhal]].
*[[Aradne]] slain

==Description==
Our last hope of victory lies in defeating the [[val'kyr]]. You've done well up until now... but you're only one <man/woman> and there are literally dozens of them raining destruction on the battlefield. 

One enormous val'kyr sits atop the tower to our south...you can see her from here. Perhaps if we eliminate her, the remaining val'kyr will dissipate. 

This is our only hope. Bring some of [[Thurman Grant|Grant's]] men with you. You'll need their protection for this battle.

==Progress==
How did I let this battle slip between my fingers?

==Completion==
I watched your victory from below. Well-fought, but ultimately, it was for naught.

The val'kyr and the [[Forsaken]] press on; soon, they will overtake us. We have lost Andorhal.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{Cost|1|50}}

==Progression==
