==Objectives==
Kill 2 Krastinovian Disciples, 2 Flesh-Cobbled Brutes, 2 Flesh-Cobbled Rippers, and 4 Unholy Corpuscles within the Weeping Cave in [[Western Plaguelands]].
*[[Krastinovian Disciple]] slain (2)
*[[Flesh-Cobbled Brute]] slain (2)
*[[Flesh-Cobbled Ripper]] slain (2)
*[[Unholy Corpuscle]] slain (4)
*[[Cult Orders]] (provided)

==Description==
The Cult orders state that the plague from the cauldron at [[Gahrron's Withering]] is in fact being used for TWO purposes. The first is the practice of spreading disease through the animals of the plaguelands, which you already knew about.

The remainder of the plague is being shipped to the [[Weeping Cave]], a cavern north of [[Malicia's Outpost]], for use in some dark experiments. Students of the [[Scholomance]] are using this plague to re-animate the dead!

Certainly they must be stopped.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Kaartish's Sword
|Field Agent's Belt
|Malicia's Scepter
|Plague-Free Disciple Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|8|32|50}}
* 3,150 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
How is your investigation proceeding, <name>?

==Completion==
You have gone above and beyond, <name>.  Not only have we set back the Cult of the Damned in their crusade to re-plague the plaguelands, but you have uncovered another set of dire plans: they continue to re-animate the dead!

Your name will definitely be mentioned when this information is presented to [[Highlord Tirion Fordring|Highlord Fordring]], <name>.  You have my thanks, and the blessing of the Argent Crusade.

== Notes ==
The cultists are at the very back of the cave.  You will encounter the rest of the targets on the way.
