==Objectives==
Use your Enthralled Val'kyr's Charm ability to charm 5 Forsaken Troopers on Felstone Field. Then slay the Opengut Abomination inside Felstone's barn.
*[[Forsaken Trooper]] charmed (5)
*[[Opengut Behemoth]] slain

==Description==
A val'kyr's only purpose is to serve, and this one serves you. I am now giving you full control over her abilities, <name>.

Roaming around the farm's outskirts, you should find several of the Forsaken that you just created. I want you to use your val'kyr to charm at least five of them. Once you have done so, take your newly-formed band of soldiers, bring them into Felstone's barn, and kill the beast inside. Today, they will learn what it means to fight for the Dark Lady. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Abominable Shoulderguards
|Charming Gloves
|Ravensun Britches
|Zombie Shotgun
|Ravensun Gloves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|8|32|50}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
You try my patience, young <name>.

==Completion==
When Koltira gives his word, I will bring these val'kyr into Andorhal. We will win. And yet another piece of Lordaeron will fall to the might of the Forsaken.

== Notes ==
'''On completion'''
:{{text|say|Lindsay Ravensun|I have no further training for you. Continue east to the Menders' Stead, for now. You will be summoned when the Battle for Andorhal commences. Hopefully Koltira doesn't wait too long...}}
