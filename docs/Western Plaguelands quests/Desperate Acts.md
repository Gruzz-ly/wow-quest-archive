==Objectives==
{{questportrait|InstructorMaliciaWPL.jpg|Instructor Malicia|She claims to be training cultists in the field, but I have other suspicions.}}
Kill [[Instructor Malicia]] and obtain her Cult Orders.
*[[Cult Orders]]

==Description==
The [[Cult of the Damned]] maintains a small camp to the east, [[Malicia's Outpost]], which they use for field training outside of the [[Scholomance]]. We may have allowed them to proceed unchecked with this training for too long.

If cultists are truly using this plague to inoculate the wildlife, then Malicia Outpost must be where the inoculation is occurring.

Instructor Malicia runs the outpost. Find her, slay her, and find out who she's taking orders from.

==Progress==
You take a look at the paperwork Malicia was carrying... 

==Completion==
The orders in Malicia's possession incriminate [[Darkmaster Gandling]] of the Scholomance, but they also conceal another important bit of information.
