==Objectives==
Meet [[Gregory]] at [[Darkwhisper Gorge]], in {{C|Winterspring}}.
*[[Blood of the Lightbringer]] (provided)

==Description==
This is... incredible. I'm far too pragmatic to believe in fate, but this is certainly a fortuitous turn of events. With this, I think we have everything we need to finish the ritual and destroy the [[Echoing Orb|orb]] for good. As with any good ritual, location is key. Are you familiar with Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring? It's an accursed, [[demon]]-infested place, but that is where we must go to finish this.

I will gather the orb and the remaining materials and meet you there. The end of my mission is near at hand!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
You made it, good. Be on your guard, <name>.

==Completion==
I know that this was a bit out of the way, but we needed an area where the barrier between our reality and the nether is thin, with a large concentration of latent [[arcane]] energy. We chose {{C|Felwood}} before because of its proximity to [[Mount Hyjal]]. For this ritual I will take no chances, and I wanted to get as close to the [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|dormant Well of Eternity]] as possible.

I can already tell this is the perfect place. I can nearly feel the energy on the air. Come, let's begin.
