[[File:The Veiled Market.jpg|thumb|The ferry to Tazavesh]]

==Objectives==
Ride the barge to [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]].
*Barge taken to Tazavesh
*[[Zo'mezal|Bouncer]] spoken to

==Description==
Let me guess... [[Bounty Hunter Ta'oku|Ta'oku]] sent you my way, yes? 

<[[Ta'meri]] looks at the coin you offer.>

So, you seek travel to Tazavesh. Not something we'd typically offer an outsider, but since payment has been accounted for, it would be my pleasure to assist you.

Step aboard, and do remember to keep any appendages inside the craft at all times. The currents of the [[In-Between]] can be fickle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
No worries! I have another plan.

==Notes==

Speak with Ta'meri again:
:Do you need something shipped?

:{{gossip|Take me to Tazavesh.}}
:''The barge flies through the In-Between to the open-world Tazavesh. On the way, hidden in a barrel...
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|Are we there yet?}}

Make sure to speak with [[Ta'resarra]] to pick up the flight path!

Find [[Zo'mezal]] up the steps:
:Halt. Only citizens and registered clients are allowed through this entrance.

:{{gossip|I seek entrance into Tazavesh.}}
:{{text|say|Zo'mezal|All non-citizens must accept the required customs check.}}
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|We must tend to a matter of great importance inside. Perhaps an exception can be made?}}
:{{text|say|Zo'mezal|All non-citizens must accept the required customs check!}}
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|If you insist. Customs it is. Follow me, Maw Walker.}}
:''Al'dali, defeated, walks back down the steps.''
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|Not a problem. We will simply follow another plan.}}
