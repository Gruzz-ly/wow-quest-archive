Speak with [[Ta'meri]] in [[Oribos]].
*[[Ta Coin of Favors]] (provided)

==Description==
Your side of the deal is done, [[Maw Walker]]. Now for your payment.

[[Cartel Ta|My cartel]] runs a ferry that travels between [[Oribos]] and [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]]. Its purpose is to transport cargo, but as in all things, there are... exceptions.

Take this coin to Ta'meri and you will be provided safe passage to the market.

What happens after that is up to you.

<[[Bounty Hunter Ta'oku|Ta'oku]] bows, uttering a sound that seems almost like a chuckle.>

Maw Walker! What can humble Ta'meri do for you?

No shortcut back to Oribos this time.
