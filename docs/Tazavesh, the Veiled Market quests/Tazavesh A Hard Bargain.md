'''Tazavesh: A Hard Bargain''' enables hard mode for [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market (instance)|Tazavesh, the Veiled Market]]. To begin purchase the [[Fraudulent Credentials]] from the [[Questionable Trader]] after defeating [[Zo'phex]]. Complete the Myza's Oasis trading game, then equip the credentials and speak with [[Au'manal]] inside in the southwest corner. He will trade the fraudulent credentials for the [[Passably-Forged Credentials]]. Equip them and he will offer this quest.

==Objectives==
Seek out Au'manal's business associate and offer your assistance.
*Speak with [[Fe'tajid]]
*Infiltrate [[Tazavesh Customs Enforcement|Customs]], then defeat [[So'leah]]
*Suggested players: 5

==Description==
Ah, my work looks marvelous on you. You are the very image of legitimacy!

And now that I've provided you with my talents, you shall provide me with yours. Seek out my business associate, Fe'tajid, at the [[Gilded Landing]] and offer him your assistance.

I look forward to hearing of your success.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Perfectly-Forged Credentials]]
* {{cost|102|96|}}
* 350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you spoken to my associate?

==Completion==
It seems our efforts to deceive the [[Cartel Zo|Zo]] were unsuccessful. But their efforts to kill you failed as well, so no harm done, yes?

Perhaps a more generous reward is in order. Please accept this, along with my sincerest gratitude.

==Notes==
On future runs, find Fe'tajid at the [[Gilded Landing]] docks near the entrance. Equip the credentials and use the on-use effect, then speak with Fe'tajid:
{{Dialogue|title=Fe'tajid|A mortal in [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]]? How peculiar... I am [[Fe'tajid]]. Cartel Fe is known for bounty hunting, and I am the finest among them.

I shipped my latest acquisitions here, but Cartel Zo claims they are stuck in customs. Extortion, of course. But perhaps we can be of use to one another.

Be forewarned however, this will not be easy.

{{Gossip|I understand the risks, I will help.}}

Fantastic! I will modify you current... disguise and perhaps it will actually be able to fool someone.

{{Gossip|Please do.}}}}

:{{Text|Say|Fe'tajid|My thanks, mortal. Let us keep our involvement between us, yes?}}

Speaking with Fe'tajid again:
{{Dialogue|You have your, ahem, security clearance. What are you waiting for?

{{gossip|Right, off we go then.}}}}

Head over to the entrance where [[Al'dalil]] and [[Gatewarden Zo'mazz]] have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Al'Dalil|The guards seemed disinterested in speaking with us. Perhaps this one...}}
{{Dialogue|title=Gatewarden Zo'mazz|Halt! Only those With proper identification may proceed.

{{Gossip|Of course. I have our credentials right here.}}

Very well. But be on alert and do not cause any trouble!

{{Gossip|Thank you.}}
}}

Zo'mazz walks up the stairs and unlocks the door to the Customs. Head on in, and pass by [[Portalmancer Zo'honn]] who can be seen chatting with the [[Collector of Worth]]. in the center of the room, [[Portalmancer Zo'dahh]] can be seen with [[Zo'phex]] who has gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Zo'phex|Welcome to Tazavesh, traveler. All who wish to enter the Veiled Market must submit to a security scan.

{{Gossip|Security scan? There's no need for that.}}}}

{{Text|Yell|Zo'phex|All must submit to security protocols.}}

Zo'phex performs a scan on the players and proceeds to aggro. The rest of the personnel in the room will gather, barring entry in to the city. Deal with them and proceed to defeat [[So'leah]].
