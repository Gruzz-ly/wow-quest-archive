==Objectives==
Enter [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]] and defeat So'leah.
*[[So'leah]] slain

==Description==
It looks like you may need to show a bit of force once more, my dear friend. Tazavesh security will not let us simply walk in.

But So'leah needs to be stopped. If that requires a bit of physical... persuasion... then it is a necessary evil. 

Bring some friends. I have a feeling the security here has tricks up their sleeves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3x [[Multi-Modal Anima Container]] (750 anima)
*{{cost|257|40}}

==Completion==
<So'leah has been defeated. Now, for the artifact she was using...>

==Notes==
The quest will autocomplete once you finish [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market]].
