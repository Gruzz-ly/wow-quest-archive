==Objectives==
Kill Urga'zz and return to [[Foreman Razelcraz]] by the mine northwest of [[Thrallmar]].
*[[Urga'zz]] slain

==Description==
I'm almost back in business. Problem is all these [[gan'arg]] are in my mine. I can't send my [[peon]]s in and even once I fix this [[shredder]] I wouldn't want to risk it in combat. Deep down in the mine the gan'arg have a leader. If you kill him maybe the gan'arg will leave. Then I could make some money and buy my way out of here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Shatterstone Pick|Underworld Helm|Deep Core Lantern}}

You will also receive:
*9,800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*{{cost|2||}}

==Progress==
Is he dead yet? I'm too scared to look.

==Completion==
All those gan'arg are sure to clear out now.  I'll be back in [[Booty Bay]] within a week.  I can't wait to go fishing again.  Coming to [[Outland]] was a mistake.  If you'll take my advice, you'll head back the way you came.  Spend some time in [[Stranglethorn Vale|Stranglethorn]], or maybe, if you feel adventurous, head to [[Un'Goro Crater]].  Just don't stay here.

==Progression==
{{Outland Sucks!}}
