==Objectives==
Use the Sanctified Crystal against a wounded [[Uncontrolled Voidwalker]] and return to [[Elsaana]] at the [[Temple of Telhamat]]. 
*[[Glowing Sanctified Crystal]]
*[[Sanctified Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Blood elf|blood elves]] epitomize the irresponsible use of [[magic]], <class>. They do not control magical energy. Rather, they are slaves to it and will suffer nothing to stand between them and their [[Magic addiction|addiction]]. They consume the energies of [[Outland]]'s [[voidwalker]]s to power their [[Fel|demonic magics]].

I've prepared a crystal charged with a spell that will allow us to neutralize a voidwalker and sever its link to this world when destroyed. I've mostly seen the voidwalkers in the [[Warp Fields]] to the southeast of [[Hellfire Citadel]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Have you used the crystal's magic against an uncontrolled voidwalker?

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>. It seems the containment crystal is holding for now, but how long it will last remains a mystery. We'll keep an eye on it and prepare more of the crystals in the meantime.
