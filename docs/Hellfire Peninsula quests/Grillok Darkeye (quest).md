Grillok "Darkeye" is the 2nd quest in the '''The Eyes of Grillok''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Kill [[Grillok "Darkeye"|Grillok Darkeye]] and bring Grillok's Eyepatch to [[Zezzak]] in [[Spinebreaker Post]].
*[[Grillok's Eyepatch]]
*Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
Grillok Darkeye has wagered a piece of himself to dark powers, and gained great [[magic]] for it.  His lost eye burns deep in some hellish pit, now a [[demon]]'s trinket... and the patch that covers his betrayal holds its own dark secrets.

Bring me Grillok's eyepatch, <name>, and I will reward you greatly for your service...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bonechewer Berserker's Vest|Goldweave Tunic|Sacred Feather Vest|Gilded Crimson Chestplate|Jerkin of the Untamed Spirit
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|g=5|s=40}}
*12600 [[XP]] (or {{cost|g=3|s=3}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
The evils of the [[Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow]] [[Fel orc|orcs]] know no bounds, and are rivaled by only their [[Shattered Hand clan|Shattered Hand]] cousins.

==Completion==
Ah, yes.  Just as some who lost a hand or a leg in battle will oftentimes feel their severed limb, I wonder if Grillok still clutched at his lost eye in his dark, dark dreams...

I too will dream on this, and if fortune is with us then perhaps I will learn what drew Grillok and the Bleeding Hollow orcs to succumb to demons.
