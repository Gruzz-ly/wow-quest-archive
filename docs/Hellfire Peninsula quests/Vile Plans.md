==Objectives==
Take the [[Burning Legion Missive]] to [[Magister Bloodhawk]] in [[Thrallmar]]. 
*[[Burning Legion Missive]] (provided)

==Description==
The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one in [[Thrallmar]] that can transcribe such vile script - the [[blood elf]] Magister Bloodhawk.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*4850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||58|50}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
I have little time to waste, <Class>. What is this you pester me with?

==Completion==
You were right to bring this to my attention. This could be a production order for additional [[fel reaver]]s - or new attack plans! This will take some time to decipher. Leave me. I will summon you when I know more.

<Magister Bloodhawk nods to you as you turn to leave>

You are a sharp one, <name>. I shall be watching your progress with interest.
