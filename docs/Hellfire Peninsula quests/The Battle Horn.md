==Objectives==
Take the [[Unyielding Battle Horn]] from [[Lieutenant Commander Thalvos]] and bring it to [[Althen the Historian]] in [[Spinebreaker Post]].
*[[Unyielding Battle Horn]]

==Description==
Perhaps we have taken the wrong approach to the [[Unyielding]]?

The tome tells me the [[Expedition Armory]] was destroyed by [[orc]]s and [[death knight]]s long ago. The Unyielding remain here as vengeful [[Ghost|spirits]] trapped in an eternal battle against the [[fel orc]] [[clan]]s.

They think only of revenge. We must arrange for them to defeat their most hated enemies. Enter the Expedition Armory once again and find Lieutenant Commander Thalvos. He carries a battle horn that can summon the Unyielding. Bring it to me.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
We must help the Unyielding soon.  If we can convince them to join us the [[Horde]] will have gained a powerful ally.

==Completion==
You have done well <name>.  This ancient horn will allow us to summon the Unyielding.

That is, if they are willing.

==Progression==
{{Decipher the Tome}}
