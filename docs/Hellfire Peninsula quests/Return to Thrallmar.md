==Objectives==
Return to [[Thrallmar]] and speak with [[Nazgrel]].

==Description==
Hope you enjoyed your flight, friend. A messenger arrived while you were away - seems Nazgrel's got a new use for you. You'd best head back to Thrallmar and check in with him. I have a feeling the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s just getting warmed up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 960 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Completion==
Ah, <name>, you've come just in time. Our [[scout]]s have discovered that the Legion positions on the ridge behind us are actually '[[forge camp]]s'. It's there that the [[demon]]s are constructing their infernal [[fel reaver]]s. If we move against them quickly we can disrupt their production!

==Progression==
#[[Return to Thrallmar]]
#[[Forge Camp: Mageddon (quest)]]
#[[Cannons of Rage]]
#[[Doorway to the Abyss]]
