This quest is part of the '''Through the Dark Portal (Horde)''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wing Commander Brack]], bomb Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz and then return to [[Forward Commander To'arch]] at [[Reaver's Fall]].
*[[Gateway Murketh]] Destroyed
*[[Gateway Shaadraz]] Destroyed
*[[Seaforium PU-36 Explosive Nether Modulator]] (provided)

==Description==
We've identified the two main transporters that the [[Burning Legion]] are using to bring in reinforcements: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz.

If you look east up the [[Path of Glory]], you'll see them on either side of the road. I want you to bomb them both into oblivion!

Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a [[goblin]] in [[Area 52]]. Now, speak with Wing Commander Brack—he'll put you on a [[wyvern]].

==Reward==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Battle-Scarred Leggings|Helm of Infinite Visions|Raging Spirit Harness|Protectorate Breastplate}}

You will gain:
*1260 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|3|}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
If you missed during your first pass, take another...

==Completion==
That will set them back weeks! Fantastic work, <name>. The Legion never expected such heavy resistance.
