==Objectives==
Kill Arazzius the Cruel, then return to [[Nazgrel]] in [[Thrallmar]].
* [[Arazzius the Cruel]] slain

==Description==
[[Magister Bloodhawk]] finally deciphered the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] missive you found earlier. It turned out to be attack plans sent by one of Highlord [[Kazzak]]'s lieutenants - Arazzius the Cruel. Apparently, Arazzius commands the Legion ground forces in [[Hellfire Peninsula|Hellfire]]. The time has come to terminate his command, <name>. Terminate with extreme prejudice.

Head west to the [[Pools of Aggonar]] and put an end to this so-called 'Legion lord'. Today, the [[Horde]] reclaims Hellfire Peninsula. Let the Legion be damned.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vengeance of the Illidari
|Bladefist's Breadth
|Regal Protectorate
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|8|70|}}
* 14,790 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Destiny calls, <name>. Arazzius the Cruel has eluded justice long enough. Let his death be a message to all those who would oppose the Horde. You are next.

==Completion==
For generations to come, they will sing songs of this day, <name> - songs of your valor. I wish [[Thrall]] had been here to celebrate this victory with us. The Legion is undone - and Hellfire now belongs to the Horde once again! There may yet be hope for this ravaged [[Outland|world]] - and our peoples' place within it. 

Lok'tar ogar!
