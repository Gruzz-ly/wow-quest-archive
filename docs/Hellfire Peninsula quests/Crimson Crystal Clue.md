==Objectives==
Deliver the Crimson Crystal Shard to [[Tola'thion]] at the [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. 
*[[Crimson Crystal Shard]] (provided)

==Description==
As the [[colossus]] falls under the weight of your attacks, you notice for the first time that it was holding a red crystal fragment.

While it was small and unnoticeable in the mountain giant's hand, it's a fairly hefty piece for you to carry around. It also suspiciously looks like it's a piece of the giant crystal in the middle of the ridge.

It's most definitely a clue as to the strangeness that is occurring here, and you're sure that the druids at the Cenarion Post to the south will want to see it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|50|}}
*5250 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|89|}} at level 70)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
That's a big crystal you have there. &nbsp;Did you get that while you were up at the ridge killing colossi?

Let me take a look at it.

==Completion==
Hmph. Just looks like a big lump of unrefined crystal to me.

Admittedly, I can feel a sickly, evil aura emanating off of it, but that's not exactly in my line of work. I'm just here to put an end to the mountain giant menace.
