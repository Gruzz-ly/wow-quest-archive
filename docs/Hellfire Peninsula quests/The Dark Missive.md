==Objectives==
Take the Missive to [[Warp-Scryer Kryv]] in the main keep of [[Honor Hold]].
*[[Burning Legion Missive]] (provided)

==Description==
The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one at Honor Hold who can decipher such archaic script - the [[draenei]] [[mystic]], Kryv.

Take the Burning Legion Missive to Warp-Scryer Kryv who resides within the War-Room at Honor Hold.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*4850 xp or {{cost||58|50}} at level 70.
*+250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
What is it, <Class>? I sense you've found something that speaks of a coming doom.

==Completion==
It is fortuitous that you intercepted this missive when you did, <name>. Though it will take me some time to decipher, I can already sense the hatred and urgency woven into this scroll. I fear the [[Burning Legion|Legion's]] true motives in this land will soon be made evident...

Give me a moment to decipher this script.
