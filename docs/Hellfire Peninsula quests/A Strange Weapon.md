'''A Strange Weapon''' returns the character back to Thrallmar with an unusual axe.

==Objectives==
Bring the Heavy Stone Axe to [[Nazgrel]] in [[Thrallmar]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. 
*[[Heavy Stone Axe]] (provided)

==Description==
You pull the stone axe out of the body to examine it more closely. There's something unusual about the craftsmanship of the weapon.

Its origin appears orcish, though the materials aren't like anything you've seen before. Nazgrel might be interested in seeing the weapon.  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Tell me, is the [[assassin]] dead? 

==Completion==
He was killed by this weapon?  It can't be!

Have we... found them? 

==Progression==
{{The Assassin}}

==Patch changes==
