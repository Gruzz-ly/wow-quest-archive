==Objectives==
Kill 20 Bonechewer Orcs and return to [[Lieutenant Amadi|Amadi]] in [[Honor Hold]].
*[[Bonechewer clan|Bonechewer]] [[Orc]] slain (20)

==Description==
Scavengers, orcs of the Bonechewer clan, skulk about the ruined battlements overlooking the [[Path of Glory]]. We must assume that these [[fel orc]]s are gathering war machine parts for their masters within [[Hellfire Citadel]]—they must be stopped!

Find Bonechewer orcs to the north, <name>. Find them and slay them! But use caution, for although these orcs are the lesser of the fel orc [[clan]]s, their strength is the match of any green-skinned orc we've faced thus far...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Choose one from:
|Desolation Rod
|Adamantine Kite Shield
|Landslide Buckler
|Hellfire Skiver
|Ironstar Repeater
}}

You will gain:
*+250 [[Honor Hold]] faction
*6200 XP (or {{cost||37|50}} at level 70

==Progress==
The Bonechewers appear in large numbers, <name>. Slay them or the fel orcs may overrun us!

==Completion==
Very good. I'm sure their loss will be felt in Hellfire Citadel. Although that dark bastion looms over us and seems nigh insurmountable, it is only with bold moves like you have made that we will find victory over the fel orcs!

*[[Bonechewer Evoker]]
