==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Altumus]] at the [[East Supply Caravan]] east of [[Honor Hold]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to kill 4 Flamewaker Imps, 6 Infernal Warbringers and 1 Dreadcaller. 
*[[Flamewaker Imp]] slain (4)
*[[Infernal Warbringer]] slain (6)
*[[Dreadcaller]] slain

==Description==
[[Lord Kazzak|Doom Lord Kazzak]] commands the [[Burning Legion]] in [[Outland]].  While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground.

They have stationed [[Nathrezim|dreadlords]] at the [[Path of Anguish]], east of here.  They are the ones responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads.  To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Rage Reaver|Screaming Dagger|The Staff of Twin Worlds|Agamaggan's Quill|Foe Reaver}}

You will also receive:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Honor Hold is safe so long as the archers guard our skies.

==Completion==
Outstanding work, soldier.  The frequency of the attacks is sure to lessen - at least until they bring forth new dreadlords.

Now for the bad news: I've got your new orders...

==Progression==
{{The Legion Reborn}}
