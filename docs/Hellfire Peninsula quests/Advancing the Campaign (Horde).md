==Objectives==
[[Shadow Hunter Ty'jin]] has asked you to speak with [[Stone Guard Stok'ton]] inside the [[Shattered Halls]] of [[Hellfire Citadel]].

==Description==
I mostly listen, <class>. I listen so that the [[Thrall|Warchief]] doesn't have to.

I've heard of the status of our campaign against the Hellfire Citadel. It is time to take the Shattered Halls, seat of power for the [[fel orc]]s.

Go speak with Stone Guard Stok'ton, he's in charge there. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*1250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Keep your head down, or it's likely to end up on the wrong end of an arrow.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.3.0|note=Added.}}
