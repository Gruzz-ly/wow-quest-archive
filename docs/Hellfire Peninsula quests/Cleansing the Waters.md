==Objectives==
[[Amaan the Wise]] wants you to travel to the [[Pools of Aggonar]] and use the [[Cleansing Vial]] at [[Aggonar]]'s [[corpse]]. Return to him when Aggonar's essence is cleansed from the water.
*Aggonar's Presence Cleansed
*[[Cleansing Vial]] (provided)

==Description==
I must ask that you finish what we've set in motion. Now that the [[demon]]ic influence has weakened you must take this cleansing vial and pour it at the very source of the taint - Aggonar's own corpse.

You will find the demon's bones at the northern end of the pools. Beware, I sense that Aggonar's essence has not quite left [[Outland|this world]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Telhamat Pendant|Amaan's Signet|Demonslayer's Wristguards}}

You wil also receive:
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
You return, <name>.  Are the waters cleansed?

==Completion==
The essence of Aggonar lived on in the form of his foul offspring [[Aggonis]]. With your success in defeating the demon, we can begin to work towards restoring the pools to their former purity.

You have our thanks, <name>.  Your work will have a deep impact in this world.

==Notes==
Use Cleansing Vial near {{coords|40|30|Hellfire Peninsula}}
