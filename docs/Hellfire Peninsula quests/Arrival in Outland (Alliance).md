'''Arrival in Outland''' is part of the Through the Dark Portal quest chain which begins with [[Through the Dark Portal (quest)]]. This is the very first Outland quest you will see, and only involves walking a short distance. Just follow Commander Duron's instructions and go due south into the Alliance side of the Dark Portal.

==Objectives==
[[Commander Duron]] at the [[Dark Portal]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to bring Duron's Report to [[Amish Wildhammer]].
*[[Duron's Report]] (provided)

==Description==
I want you to speak with Amish Wildhammer, standing about 30 paces south of us, and catch the first flight to [[Honor Hold]]. When you arrive at Honor Hold, you'll be greeted by [[Marshal Isildor]]. I have prepared a report detailing our situation here. Give him the report, and tell him you're ready for duty.

You have your orders, soldier, now move out! And though your blood must be burning to help us against the fiends below, waste no time here. Honor Hold needs you even more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||28|80}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
I saw you speaking with Duron over there. You must be on an important mission!

==Completion==
Reports for Honor Hold? No problem—we'll get you there fast and safe on one of my [[gryphon]]s!

==Progression==
{{Through the Dark Portal (Alliance)}}
