==Objectives==
Use Zezzak's Shard to capture an [[Eye of Grillok]], then approach Zezzak's cauldron to extract it. After it is removed, return Zezzak's Shard to him.
*Eye of Grillok Returned
*[[Zezzak's Shard]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, you have braved the lair of the [[Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow]] [[orc]]s, dreaded [[Zeth'Gor]], and survived! Perhaps you have the strength to aid me, for I aim to gaze into the mind of its darkest witch, [[Grillok "Darkeye"|Grillok]]!

Take this shard. Use it to ensorcel an Eye of Grillok and bind it to yourself. Return here and approach my cauldron... and it will pull the eye from you.

Go, <name>. And use care -- An Eye of Grillok will betray you to our enemies if given the slightest opening!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|40|}}
*5000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|20|}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
The orcs of the Bleeding Hollow Clan were dark allies long ago... and even darker enemies now.

==Completion==
I am indebted to you, <name>.  You have again braved Zeth'Gor and held its darkness close to your heart.  I will study the eye and perhaps pierce the secrets of its master, Grillok.

Let us hope that he can no longer use its [[magic]]!

==Notes==
Once the shard is used, the player gets the [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=38495/eye-of-grillok Eye of Grillok] buff.
