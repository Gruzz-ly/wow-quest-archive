==Objectives==
[[Wing Commander Brack]] at [[Reaver's Fall]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.
*[[Gan'arg Peon]] slain (20)
*[[Mo'arg Overseer]] slain (5)
*[[Fel Cannon (Hellfire Peninsula)|Fel Cannon]] Destroyed (5)
*[[Area 52 Special]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, are you ready for another sortie over the [[Abyssal Shelf]]? I fear that, if we do not maintain pressure on the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] forces there and allow them to strengthen their hold, then we may suffer a large [[demon]] attack from the north.

What say you, <class>? Do you want to take another [[Wyvern|windrider]] and hammer the Abyssal Shelf one more time?

==Progress==
The Legion must not think they are safe high atop the Abyssal Shelf.  We must hit them repeatably!

==Completion==
The other [[Wyvern rider|windrider pilots]] speak highly of you, <name>.  You've scored quite a lot of kills on the Abyssal Shelf.  Keep up the good works!
