==Objectives==
Place the [[Signaling Gem]] near the [[Altar of Aggonar]] at the [[Pools of Aggonar]] and defeat any [[Draenei]] [[Anchorite]]s that respond to your summons. Return to [[Ryathen the Somber]] at [[Falcon Watch]] with the Signaling Gem after completing this task.
*{{NPC||Draenei Anchorite}} slain
*[[Signaling Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
Our [[scout]]s captured a draenei [[paladin]] at the Pools of Aggonar. He was to take part in a cleansing ritual to purify the pools. We must stop the draenei from succeeding or we will lose our supply of [[felblood]]!

He was carrying this signaling gem, looking to mark a spot where a [[priest]] - or "anchorite" as they call themselves - could perform their rituals in safety. Place the gem near the Altar of Aggonar and be ready to ambush any approaching draenei.

I suggest that you take a friend or two along.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Felblood Band|Felforce Medallion|Lost Anchorite's Cloak}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You've returned, <name>.  Did you put an end to the draenei's folly?

==Completion==
That'll show those holy fanatics to mind their own business.
