This quest is part of the '''Through the Dark Portal (Horde)''' quest chain. 

==Objectives==
Take [[Vlagga Freyfeather]]'s [[Wyvern|Wind Rider]] to [[Thrallmar]]. Bring Orion's Report to [[General Krakork]].
*[[Orion's Report]] (provided)

==Description==
When you're ready, I'll summon a wyvern to fly you to Thrallmar. Once you arrive, deliver [[Lieutenant General Orion|Orion]]'s report to General Krakork.

Lok'tar ogar, <name> - good luck.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||28|80}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
A report from Orion? Give it here, quickly!

<Frowning, General Krakork quickly scans the tattered document.>

Damn, it's just as we feared. Orion and his [[warrior]]s could be overrun at any moment!

==Completion==
I'll rally what troops I can and send them to aid Orion's forces at the [[Dark Portal]]. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] will not soon forget the battle cry of the [[Horde]]! As for you <name>, you've done a great service for Thrallmar this day. I expect you'll be a great help to us here... if you have the wits to survive, that is.
