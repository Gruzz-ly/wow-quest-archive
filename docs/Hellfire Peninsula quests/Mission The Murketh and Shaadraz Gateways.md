This quest starts the '''Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wing Commander Dabir'ee]], bomb Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz and then return to [[Forward Commander Kingston]] at [[Expedition Point]].
*[[Gateway Murketh]] Destroyed
*[[Gateway Shaadraz]] Destroyed
*[[Seaforium PU-36 Explosive Nether Modulator]] (Provided)

==Description==
Just west of the [[Dark Portal]] are two huge transporters: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz.

If you look east up the [[Path of Glory]], you'll see them on either side of the road. I want you to bomb them both into rubble!

Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a [[goblin]] in [[Area 52]]. Now, speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee—he'll put you on a [[gryphon]] and send you on your way.

==Rewards==

Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*1260 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|3|}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
This is a vital mission, <name>.  It's one I would not trust to just anyone.

==Completion==
That will slow them down, there's no denying it! I think you just put me in an uncharacteristically good mood, <name>!

==Progression==
{{Shatter Point}}
