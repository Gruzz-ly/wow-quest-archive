==Objectives==
Kill 15 Marauding Crust Bursters and return to [[Foreman Biggums]] at [[Honor Hold]].
* [[Marauding Crust Burster]] slain (15)

==Description==
Well met, <class>. Now that reinforcements are finally arriving, we can recapture some semblance of a normal life.

One of our first goals is to restore the flow of men and goods along the road to the southwest, but it must be reclaimed from the crust bursters that've overrun the area.

If you're willing to help us deal with this menace, you would have the gratitude of the Sons. Watch carefully for the disturbed ground they leave in their wake.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Adept's Band
|Imbued Chain
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
* 9,580 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Were you able to clear the road?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. We shouldn't be too quick to congratulate ourselves, though. I'm certain we haven't seen the last of those worms. If they show their hideous heads around these parts again, the [[Sons of Lothar|Sons]]'ll be ready for them!
