This quest is part of the '''Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways''' quest chain. This quest chain starts with [[Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wing Commander Gryphongar]] in [[Shatter Point]].

==Description==
Wing Commander Gryphongar runs this outfit of [[Wildhammer dwarf|Wildhammers]]. If this is your first time to Shatter Point, then you should report to him.

You'll find him inside what's left of that tower over yonder.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*650 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|90}} at level 70)

==Completion==
You spoke with [[Runetog Wildhammer|Runetog]]?  A fine [[dwarf]] he is.  Keeps his [[gryphon]]s in good shape and battle ready.

I'm Gryphongar, commander here at Shatter Point.  I know it's not pretty, but this hunk of rock is a vital staging point for sorties into [[Hellfire Peninsula|Hellfire]].  You'll see gryphons flying out and in non-stop!

Advice?  Here's some: keep your gear stowed, your stomach empty, and your eye on the horizon... if Shatter Point starts to teeter, then grab onto something that won't float away!
