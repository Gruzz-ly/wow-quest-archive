==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Ruins of Sha'naar]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] and obtain 5 Demonic Essences from the [[Illidari Taskmaster]]s. Return to [[Apothecary Azethen]] at [[Falcon Watch]] after you've completed the task.
*[[Demonic Essence]] (5)

==Description==
Uncorrupted [[draenei]], like this unlucky fellow here, are virtuous champions of the [[Light]]. What corruption caused their great race to devolve into the [[Broken]] and [[Lost One]]s?

I've heard a theory that exposure to [[fel]] energies is what caused the mutation. I would like to put that theory to the test.

Northwest of here lie the Ruins of Sha'naar. There you will find lowly Broken commanded by [[Illidari]] taskmasters. Bring me [[demon]]ic essences from the taskmasters so that I can test them on this draenei. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ring of the Slain Anchorite|Broken Choker|Fallen Vindicator's Blade}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]
