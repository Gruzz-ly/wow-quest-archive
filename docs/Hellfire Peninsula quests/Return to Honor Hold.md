==Objectives==
Speak with [[Assistant Klatu]], at [[Honor Hold]]'s inn.

==Description==
<Name>, while you were on your mission in [[Zeth'Gor]], I received news of my commanding officer, [[Colonel Jules]]. He was stricken with a demonic corruption while fighting near the [[Gor'gaz Outpost]], and his situation has grown very bad.

You have made such great gains for us against the [[fel orc]]s. Your strength in battle is without question... is your spirit just as strong?

Please, return to Honor Hold and speak with Klatu, in an upper room at the Honor Hold inn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4850 [[XP]] ({{cost||58|50}} at level 70)

==Completion==
Yes, it is true. Colonial Jules' situation has grown much worse these past days. [[Anchorite Barada]] is busy praying for him... let us hope he may be cured.

==Notes==
