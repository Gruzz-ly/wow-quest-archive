This quest is part of the '''Return to Thrallmar''' quest chain. This quest chain starts with [[Return to Thrallmar]].

==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Fel Cannon Mk1s in [[Forge Camp: Rage]] and return to [[Nazgrel]] in [[Thrallmar]].
*[[Fel Cannon MKI]] slain (3)

==Description==
There is a second production facility, Forge Camp: Rage, that lies to the immediate northeast of Thrallmar. The [[demon]]s have positioned a number of their fel cannons along the ridge - and they're aimed straight at us! You must enter the camp and destroy these fel cannons.

<Name>, you must be sure to detonate them all - or nothing will stop the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] from raining fiery hell down upon our heads!

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
The Legion could start shelling us at any time, <name>! You need to destroy those blasted cannons!

==Completion==
I knew you had spirit, <name>, but you've outdone yourself this time! We heard those wretched cannons exploding from here! That should teach the Legion not to underestimate the Sons of [[Durotar]]!
