==Objectives==
Gather 12 [[:Hellfire Spineleaf]] plants for a salve and return to [[Grelag]] at [[Spinebreaker Post]]. 
*[[Hellfire Spineleaf]] (12)
*Return to Grelag at Spinebreaker Post in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Description==
Just as [[Zeth'Gor]] came into view, a [[Burning Legion|Legion]] patrol caught sight of me. I ran, hoping to duck into one of the towers in the distance, but one of their [[felhound]]s caught up with me and nearly hamstrung me!

I managed to escape, but my leg is in terrible shape. Stone Guard Ambelan found me and brought me here.<br>
Now, I have to find a way to tend to my leg. Spineleaf grows in and around the [[Valley of Bones]] to the north .{{sic}} A salve made from it will dull the pain enough for me to travel. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Hellfire Spineleaf (consumable)|q=20}}

You will also gain:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Have you brought the plants? 

==Completion==
These should do the job. I'm going to prepare the salve and finish my splint before making my way back to [[Thrallmar]]. Why do I have the feeling that I know what [[Far Seer Regulkut]] will say when she sees me?

<Grelag sighs half-heartedly.>

Thank you for your help, <name>. I have some of the spineleaf left over. You're welcome to take it with you. Who can tell when it will prove useful?
