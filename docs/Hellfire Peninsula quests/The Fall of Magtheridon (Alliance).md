This quest begins from the item [[Magtheridon's Head]], which is obtained by defeating [[Magtheridon]] in [[Magtheridon's Lair]].

==Objectives==
Return Magtheridon's Head to [[Force Commander Danath Trollbane]] at [[Honor Hold]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].
* [[Magtheridon's Head]] (provided)

==Description==
The source of [[Illidan Stormrage]]'s [[fel orc]] army has been vanquished. The manufactory halts production of its grim product - at least for now. All that remains are a few trinkets and this severed head - a fitting trophy for a hero of the [[Alliance]].

Return [[Magtheridon]]'s head to Danath Trollbane at Honor Hold.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|A'dal's Signet of Defense
|Band of Crimson Fury
|Naaru Lightwarden's Band
|Ring of the Recalcitrant
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,230 [[XP]]
* +1000 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
For the first time - in as long as I can remember - there is silence.

==Completion==
This defeat is not only a blow to Illidan, <name>. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] too reels... A [[Annihilan|pit lord]] [[Commander (rank)|commander]] has been defeated. The siege of [[Hellfire Citadel]] now holds no purpose for the Burning Legion. All of their efforts will undoubtedly be turned upon the [[Black Temple]].

Redemption comes for Illidan... and soon.

==Notes==
Completing the quest will also buff every Alliance character in both [[Hellfire Peninsula]] and [[Hellfire Citadel]] with the [[Trollbane's Command]], granting 10% Honor Hold reputation gain for two hours.
