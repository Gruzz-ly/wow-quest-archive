==Objectives==
Cleanse 8 Trampled Skeletons on the [[Path of Glory]] with [[Draenei Holy Water]], then return to [[Warp-Scryer Kryv]] at [[Honor Hold]].
*Cleanse [[Trampled Skeleton]] (8)
*[[Draenei Holy Water]] (provided)

==Description==
The 'Path of Glory,' they called it. A road leading from the heart of their gruesome fortress to the [[Dark Portal]], paved with the bones of [[Draenei|my people]].

It wasn't enough for them to hunt us down like animals, destroy our cities, and torture those who survived. No, they had to use our bones as paving stones, denying my brethren a proper burial under the [[Light]].

Those tortured souls still wander these lands, crying out for release. I ask you, <name>, help me in this undertaking.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9800 [[XP]]
*250 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
The cries seem somehow... fainter than they were before. The Light grant it's more than wishful thinking.

==Completion==
You have my sincere thanks for your efforts, <name>. Though much remains to be done, it gladdens me to know we have helped some find their long-deserved rest.
