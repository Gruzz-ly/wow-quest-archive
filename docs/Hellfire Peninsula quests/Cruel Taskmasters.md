==Objectives==
Slay 4 Illidari Taskmasters at the [[Ruins of Sha'naar]] and return to [[Ikan]] at the [[Temple of Telhamat]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. 
*[[Illidari Taskmaster]] slain (4)

==Description==
You probably think most [[Broken]] are evil, don't you? In reality many just lack guidance.

Before I met the [[Omenai]], I too was lost.

Our minds suffered terrible pain from the [[orc]]s' demonic [[magic]]. We are easily confused and taken advantage of.

[[Demon]]s allied with [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]] raid Hellfire daily and capture our kind as [[slave]]s. With the Omenai we now have hope. Travel to the Ruins of Sha'naar, southwest of here, and slay the [[Illidari]] taskmasters so my people may be free!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
You've returned! Did you complete your task?

==Completion==
You did it! &nbsp;I'm in your debt, &lt;name&gt;. &nbsp;Look at all the Dreghoods that are showing up.

Under my guidance they'll learn all about the old ways, you'll see.
