==Objectives==
Use the [[Cenarion Antidote]] on a [[Hulking Helboar]] and observe the results. Once you have the results of the experiment, return to [[Thiah Redmane]] at the [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. 
*Administer Antidote
*[[Cenarion Antidote]] (provided)

==Description==
I think there's something we can use in the blood as the base of an antidote. Don't look at me like I've lost my mind!

It's a common theme in nature. Often, the cure for something can be derived from the toxin itself. That's just what I aim to do.

Ridding the boars of their [[demon]]ic influence would probably eliminate their aggression and give us insight into how to best attempt to help other species.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Cenarion Naturalist's Staff|Dreadtusk's Fury|Helboar Carving Blade}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Do you have the results of the experiment?

==Completion==
<Thiah Redmane's eyes widen as you describe the results of the experiment.>

But, how could that happen? I'm certain I prepared the antidote correctly!

I've seen it work with spider and [[snake]] venoms, so why would it backfire here? Perhaps that's one of [[Outland]]'s many peculiarities, <name>. I'd best pass this information along to my comrades.

==Notes==
After using the quest item on the boar, it becomes enraged, changes to [[Dreadtusk]] and attacks the player.
