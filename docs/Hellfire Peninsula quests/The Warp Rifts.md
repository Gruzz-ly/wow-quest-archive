'''The Warp Rifts''' sends the player to test out an experimental warp rift generator.

==Objectives==
Use the [[:Unstable Warp Rift Generator]] in the [[Warp Fields]]. Gather 3 [[Warp Nether]]s from [[Unstable Voidwalker]]s and return them to [[Ogath the Mad]] in [[Spinebreaker Post]].
*[[Warp Nether]] (3)
*[[Unstable Warp Rift Generator]] (provided)

==Description==
Long have I wandered through [[Outland]], searching for the truth of the [[void]]. Now I am old and weak. Perhaps you will help me?

I must learn the secrets of the [[voidwalker]]s. You must find the Warp Fields to the west. West of the [[Expedition Armory]] there is a dark place on the edge of the abyss where time and space are weak. Use my unstable warp rift generator in the Warp Fields to create a warp rift. You must gather warp nether from the creatures that come through.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2}}
* 9800 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to use my experimental device yet?  I think my unstable warp rift generator will work out there so close to the abyss.

==Completion==
Unbelievable.  You have touched the void itself!  <Name>, you have saved my life's work.  But there is more that must be done, and you can help me.

==Notes==
When you arrive in the Warp Fields, you will need to right-click on the generator in your inventory. This will create a target on the ground. Click on the ground to generate a warp rift. Voidwalkers that emerge from this rift should drop the needed nethers.

==Progression==
*[[The Warp Rifts]]
**[[Void Ridge (quest)]]
***[[From the Abyss]]
