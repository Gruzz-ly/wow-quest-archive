==Objectives==
Slay Arix'Amal. Take the Burning Legion Gate Key. Use the Burning Legion Gate Key on the [[Rune of Spite]].
*[[Warbringer Arix'Amal]] slain
*Close [[Burning Legion Gate]]
*[[Burning Legion Gate Key]]

==Description==
Well, we've located the Legion's final base on the ridge - [[Invasion Point: Annihilator]]. It lies northwest of [[Forge Camp: Rage]] - and it houses a warp-portal through which the Legion has been drawing its reinforcements!

You've got to close that portal to prevent any more demons from coming through. The Point's overlord, Warbringer Arix'Amal, holds the portal's activation key. Take it from him and shut that blasted gateway down!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2}}
*9800 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|1|17}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
You close down that war-portal yet, <name>?  While you're here shuffling your feet, there are more demons entering [[Outland]]!

==Completion==
Great job! That should drastically cut down on the number of demons trying to creep up our backsides. I can't thank you enough for your help out here, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Shatter Point}}
