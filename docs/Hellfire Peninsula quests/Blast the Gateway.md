'''Blast the Gateway''' is one of the two [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] [[daily quest]]s located at the [[Throne of Kil'jaeden]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. Players must have completed the quest [[The Missing Magistrix]] before Seyla offers this quest.

==Objectives==
[[Magistrix Seyla]] at the [[Throne of Kil'jaeden]] wants you to use the Sizzling Embers to summon a [[Living Flare]] and slay [[Incandescent Fel Spark]]s near it until it becomes an [[Unstable Living Flare]]. Return to the Legion Gateway with the Unstable Fel Spark to destroy it.
*Legion Gateway Destroyed
*[[Sizzling Embers]] (provided)

==Description==
We have to shut down this gateway to stop [[Burning Legion|Legion]] reinforcements to the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]].

Take these embers, they contain one of my creations: a living flare.  It is designed to act as a powerful destructive force - as long as it has been provided enough energy.

Find the fel sparks that wander the area and slay them near the living flare.  The flare will grow in power each time, until it becomes unstable.

Once you've achieved this bring the flare to the gateway.  It will know what to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|10}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Shattered Sun Offensive]]
*[[Shattered Sun Supplies]]

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>? We must stop further Legion forces from reinforcing [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas]].

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. The demons might repair the gateway in due time. I suppose we'll just have to blow it up again.

==Notes==
*After summoning your spark, don't leave the Throne of Kil'jaeden unless you intend to reset the quest.
*You don't actually have to kill any of the fire elementals there; it's enough to just stand at one which is getting killed by another player including one of the opposite faction. Your "spark" will still grow bigger.
*It takes 8 kills to go unstable.
*Dying despawns your spark and you'll have to summon it again at its starting level of energy.

==Progression==
