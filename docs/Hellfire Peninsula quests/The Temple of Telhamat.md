==Objectives==
Speak with [[Amaan the Wise]] at the [[Temple of Telhamat]] in western [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Description==
Fortunately, the [[Path of Glory]] is not the only trace of [[Draenei|my people]] in these lands. To the west, a few of our holy sites survive, although some have been overrun.

While [[Velen]] prepared for the journey that would lead him to [[Azeroth]], those of us who would remain behind sought to reestablish a presence at our holy places.

In the western part of the Hellfire Peninsula, you will find a small group of draenei at the Temple of Telhamat, led by Amaan the Wise. I am certain he'd be interested in meeting you.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2600 [[XP]] (or {{cost||93|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
Ah, so you've met [[Warp-Scryer Kryv|Seer Kryv]]. He is a wise and gifted man and any <race> he would name a friend is also a friend of mine.

Make yourself comfortable and introduce yourself to the others who call the temple home.
