==Objectives==
Travel to [[Falcon Watch]] in the southwest of [[Hellfire Peninsula]] and report to [[Ranger Captain Venn'ren]].

==Description==
What are you still doing here, <name>?  Didn't you hear we built a proper [[Blood elf|sin'dorei]] outpost here in Hellfire Peninsula?

Surely you'd rather be among fellow blood elves and away from all this... smell.  You'll find Falcon Watch in the southwest, beyond [[Hellfire Citadel]].  Report to [[Ranger Captain Venn'ren]]; he will take care of you.

The road ahead is dangerous and heavily patrolled by [[Alliance]] scouts.  I would recommend travelling with companions.  Blood elves, preferably.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:

*1000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|s=24}} at level 70)

==Completion==
Welcome to Falcon Watch, <brother/sister>.  Many other blood elves haven't been fortunate enough to make it this far.

It's a terrible shame; our work in [[Outland]] has just begun.
