'''From the Abyss''' sends the player after a Prince of the Void in order to help Ogath understand the mysteries of the voidwalkers.

==Objectives==
Kill [[Void Baron Galaxis]] and collect his soul shard. Take the shard to [[Ogath the Mad]] in [[Spinebreaker Post]].
* [[Galaxis Soul Shard]]
* [[Warp Rift Generator]] (provided)

==Description==
My warp rift generator is complete. You can now use it to summon a true prince of the [[void]], a creature whose soul shard will tell us much of what lies beyond.

Go south in [[Void Ridge]] and use my warp rift generator near the void stones. Look for a cluster of crystals near the edge of the abyss. A huge warp rift will form and Void Baron Galaxis will surely appear.

Destroy this creature and bring me his soul shard.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Rod of the Void Caller|Circle of Banishing|Abyssal Shroud}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|90}}
*10,400 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Have you destroyed Void Baron Galaxis yet? 

==Completion==
You have saved my life's work <name>.  

They called me insane, they laughed at me, they thought I was mad for my obsession with the Void Ridge and Warp Fields.  Now with this soul shard I can unlock the secrets of the [[voidwalker]]s.  I will command the power of the abyss.

==Notes==
His spawn point is around coordinates 80,79. When he appears, he will also bring 2 additional weak voidwalkers with him. When Galaxis reaches around 20% health, he will absorb one of the voidwalkers to heal himself. Therefore it may be advisable to take out the voidwalkers first before you attack Galaxis.

There has also been an issue with Galaxis' body disappearing before you have time to loot it. This was supposedly fixed in [[Patch 2.1.0 (Release Notes)|patch 2.1.0]] although there are reports that the bug is still around. Players have also started that they've seen Galaxis spawn without any additional voidwalkers.

==Progression==
*[[The Warp Rifts]]
**[[Void Ridge (quest)]]
***[[From the Abyss]]
