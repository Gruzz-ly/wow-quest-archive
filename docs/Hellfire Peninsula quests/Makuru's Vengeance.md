==Objectives==
[[Makuru]] at the [[Temple of Telhamat]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to bring him 10 Mag'har Ancestral Beads.
*[[Mag'har Ancestral Beads]] (10)

==Description==
[[Vindicator Sedai|Sedai]] was like a brother to Makuru. We owe him our lives and more! They call Makuru crazy but if the [[Omenai]] are not going to do anything about his death then they're the crazy ones!

Makuru doesn't have much to call his own in [[Outland|this world]], but he will give you his only possession if you avenge Sedai.

I've seen the [[Mag'har|brown orc Mag'har]] [[grunt]]s before, up in the hills to the northeast. They hate us! They don't deserve our mercy! Go, avenge Sedai! Bring me their ancestral beads as proof!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sedai's Necklace|Sedai's Blade|Sedai's Ring}}

*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Did you avenge Sedai for Makuru?

==Completion==
Yes... revenge!  You did good.

You take this now.  It was a gift from Sedai.  It only makes Makuru sad to see it.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{text|say|[[Anchorite Obadei]]|What have you done, Makuru? These are not our ways!}}
:{{text|say|Makuru|The orcs hate us, Obadei! They've killed many of us before! They deserve death and worse.}}
:{{text|say|Anchorite Obadei|I understand how you feel Makuru. Sedai was my brother after all. Yet we can't disgrace his memory by going against his very ideals.}}
