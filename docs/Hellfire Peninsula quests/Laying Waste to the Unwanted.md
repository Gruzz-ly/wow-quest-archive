==Objectives==
Use the Flaming Torch to burn the [[Horde]] [[Blade thrower|Blade Throwers]] overlooking the [[Path of Glory]]. Then, bring the Flaming Torch to [[Dumphry]] in [[Honor Hold]].
*Eastern Thrower Burned (58,47)
*Central Eastern Thrower Burned (55,45)
*Central Western Thrower Burned
*Western Thrower Burned (52,47)
*[[Flaming Torch (Hellfire Peninsula)]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that we've gotten our salvage operation off the ground, it's time to begin the second phase of the plan.

Across the [[Path of Glory]] the Horde still has their old blade throwers trained on us. Don't let their age fool you, <name>, they're still very dangerous. Much as we're working to reclaim what we can, we can't assume the Horde is going to dismantle their weaponry.

Take this torch and burn the remaining siege equipment. I'll take no chances with Honor Hold's safety.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Wanderer's Stitched Trousers|Nature-Stitched Kilt|Helm of Affinity|Scale Brand Breastplate}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*+250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]
*9800 xp (or {{cost|2|58|50}} at level 70)

==Progress==
You seem to be in good spirits. Has burning Horde siege machinery put the spring back in your step?

==Completion==
That's the spirit!

I'm glad we finally got some reinforcements, but I'm not so sure about their attitude toward the Horde. Where I come from, anyone with a weapon pointed at you is an enemy and needs to be dealt with like one!
