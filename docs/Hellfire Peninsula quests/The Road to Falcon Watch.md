==Objectives==
Protect the [[Wounded Blood Elf Pilgrim]] on her way to [[Falcon Watch]], then speak with [[Taleris Dawngazer]]. 
*Escort Wounded Blood Elf Pilgrim to Falcon Watch
*Speak with Taleris Dawngazer at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula.

==Description==
<The battered [[blood elf]]'s face displays relief at your presence.>

Please, <class>, get me out of this [[cage]]! I foolishly set out from [[Thrallmar]] ahead of the main group, despite [[Martik Tor'seldori]]'s warnings.

I was set upon by horrible creatures that could only be the [[ravager]]s he talked about. I managed to drive them off, but that was only the beginning of my troubles.

As I bound my wounds, those [[Arakkoa|bird men]] found me, dragged me back to this cave, and locked me in this cage! I must get to Falcon Watch! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
What do you need, <class>?

==Completion==
<Taleris shouts to several of the blood elves at the outpost.>

Get her inside and see to her wounds!

<Taleris turns back to you.>

She's fortunate that you found her when you did, <class>. I don't think she'd have lasted much longer out there.

Can you make out what she was saying?
