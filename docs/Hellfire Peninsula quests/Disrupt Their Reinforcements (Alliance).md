==Objectives==
Defeat enemies around [[Portal Grimh]] and [[Portal Kaalez]] to gather [[Demonic Rune Stone]]s.

Use Kingston's Primer inside Portal Grimh and Portal Kaalez.

Return to [[Forward Commander Kingston]] with the remaining explosives.

*Disrupt Portal Grimh
*Disrupt Portal Kaalez
*[[Kingston's Primers]] (provided)

==Description==
You'll find the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] front to our northeast, and spaced along it are portals used to gather reinforcements from throughout [[Outland]]. We, <name>, are going to destroy those portals!

Take this primer. Designed in [[Area 52]], it uses the [[demon]]s' own power as an explosive device! Defeat Legion forces around Portals Grimh and Kaalez to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate the stones inside the portals... then watch the fireworks!!

Go, <name>, and return to me when your mission is complete.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Shadowbrim Travel Hat|Arcane Ringed Tunic|Fire Scarred Breastplate|Flayer-Hide Leggings|Invader's Greathelm}}

You will gain:
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
I wish I could be there to watch the fire display.  Those explosives pack a big punch!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.  Disabling those portals will stem the flow of Legion reinforcements for a long time!

But we can't rest yet... 

==Progression==
