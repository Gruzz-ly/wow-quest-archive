==Description==
[[Honor Hold Mine|The mine]]'s been overrun by a plague of [[gan'arg]] misfits!

Not only did they run all my workers out of the tunnels, but they're pounding away in there night and day! To make things worse, now I've got [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] on me back! He says he's going to take away me ale ration if I don't get this taken care of soon!

None of the miners'll go in there, and the guards are busy drinking themselves silly.

I'm begging you, <name>, help me here. Danath can take me dignity, but he'll never take me ale!

==Progress==
Tell me the shaking's over and my boys can get back to work... please?

==Completion==
By [[Bronzebeard]]'s bronze... beard, you've done it! You're a hero, <name>.
