This quest is part of the '''Through the Dark Portal (Horde)''' quest chain. 

==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Shatterskull]] at the [[Supply Caravan]] east of [[Thrallmar]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to kill 4 Flamewaker Imps, 6 Infernal Warbringers and 1 Dreadcaller.
*{{mob|Dreadcaller|level=59|icon=Dreadlord}} slain
*{{mob|Flamewaker Imp|level=56-58|icon=FelImp}}s slain (4)
*{{mob|Infernal Warbringer|level=58-59}}s slain (6)

==Description==
[[Lord Kazzak|Doom Lord Kazzak]] commands the [[Burning Legion]] in [[Outland]]. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his [[lieutenant]]s that command Legion troops from the ground.

They have stationed [[Nathrezim|dreadlords]] in [[Felspark Ravine]], east of here. They are responsible for these [[infernal]] storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion.

==Reward==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Rage Reaver|Screaming Dagger|The Staff of Twin Worlds|Agamaggan's Quill|Foe Reaver}}

You will gain:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|1|17}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Thrallmar is safe so long as the [[Arcanist Torseldori|arcanist]] and his [[Bloodmage (NPC)|bloodmages]] remain at the front.

==Completion==
Outstanding work, soldier. The frequency of the attacks is sure to lessen - at least until they bring forth more dreadlords.

Now for the bad news: I've got your new orders...

==Progression==
{{Eradicate the Burning Legion}}
