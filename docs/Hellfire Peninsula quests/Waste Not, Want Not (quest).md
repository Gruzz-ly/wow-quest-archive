==Objectives==
Bring 8 pieces of [[Salvaged Metal]] and 8 pieces of [[Salvaged Wood]] to [[Dumphry]] at [[Honor Hold]].
*[[Salvaged Metal]] (8)
*[[Salvaged Wood]] (8)

==Description==
Reinforcements are great, but I don't see 'em haulin' any [[wagon]]s loaded with ingots or [[Lumber|timber]].

Take a look around, friend. Trees are in short supply, and the mines are overrun with [[Burning Legion|Legion]] scum.

I'm in a bad way fer supplies, and I'm makin' what substitutions I can, but it's time to start reusing what we can.

The southern edge of the [[Path of Glory|Path o' Glory]] is strewn with the ruins of siege machinery. Some pieces of 'em are still usable. Feeling up to a bit o' a salvage operation?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Phantasmal Headdress|Battle Seeker Chestguard|Legionnaire's Studded Helm|Magistrate's Greaves}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*+250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]
*9800 xp or {{cost|2|58|50}} at level 70

==Progress==
Were you able to find any usable materials out there underneath all the dust, ash, and char?

==Completion==
This is in better condition than I thought it'd be. Sure, it's going to take some time to work off all the rust, the char, and the like, but I'll not complain.
