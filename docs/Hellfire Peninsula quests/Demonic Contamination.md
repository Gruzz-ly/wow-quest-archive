==Objectives==
[[Thiah Redmane]], at the [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]], has asked you to gather 6 Helboar Blood Samples from [[Hulking Helboar]]s. 
*[[Helboar Blood Sample]] (6)

==Description==
Welcome to the Cenarion Post, <class>. We don't often get company out here, but I'm grateful for the visit. My work with the creatures of this desolate land requires me to travel to many remote places.

The [[Cenarion Expedition]] has dispatched me to study some of the most dangerous wildlife in [[Outland]], and I've made a startling discovery. While many creatures here have already undergone radical changes, they continue to mutate. I'm collecting blood samples to document the changes, and any help would be welcome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Were you able to collect the blood samples? 

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. These blood samples will prove helpful in my research and in the Expedition's wider studies of Outland's creatures.

If I could isolate what causes these creatures to change continuously, perhaps I could concoct an antidote.
