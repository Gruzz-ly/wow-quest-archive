==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Fel Cannon MKIs in [[Forge Camp: Rage]] and return to [[Field Marshal Brock]] at [[Honor Point (Hellfire Peninsula)|Honor Point]].
*[[Fel Cannon MKI]] slain (3)

==Description==
Now we focus on the second target - Forge Camp: Rage. It lies just west of [[Forge Camp: Mageddon|Mageddon]]. Trouble is, the [[demon]]s have a number of [[fel cannon]]s aimed straight at the [[Horde]]'s outpost of [[Thrallmar]]! Though I can scarcely believe it, we actually need the Horde to help us hold the line at the [[Dark Portal]]. We can't afford to let Thrallmar fall. You've got to destroy these cannons before the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] pulverizes our allies!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2}}
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
The Legion could start shelling the Horde at any time, <name>!  You need to destroy those blasted cannons!

==Completion==
I have to hand it to you, <name>, you're a fighter born! Those Horde yokels may never know how close they came to the end. It takes real character to step in harm's way on behalf of your enemies. That's the kind of honor and commitment that holds the [[Alliance]] together!  

<Field Marshal Brock salutes you crisply.>

==Notes==
If you were quick in killing the servants around the cannons at [[Forge Camp: Mageddon]] for the last quest, you can hurry back to the cannons here and kill those instead, before too many re-spawn.
