==Objectives==
[[Mirren Longbeard]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to bring him 8 [[Kaliri Feather]]s from the various [[kaliri]] found in the [[Den of Haal'esh]].
*[[Kaliri Feather]] (8)

==Description==
The [[arakkoa]] at the [[Den of Haal'esh]], south of here, breed a magnificent species of birds called [[kaliri]]. Their feathers would fetch a bundle at the trading posts back in [[Azeroth]]. Just think of all the ale I could buy then!

Tell you what, you bring me a stack of [[kaliri Feather|kaliri feather]]s and I'll give you my very own hat. What do you say? You'll never find a hat like this one! Do we have a deal?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]
*+10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at max level)
*[[Mirren's Drinking Hat]]

==Progress==
Did you bring me the kaliri feathers, <class>?

==Completion==
You did your part. I guess a deal is a deal!

Here you go, friend. Treat it well.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
