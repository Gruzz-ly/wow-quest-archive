'''Hellfire Fortifications''' is the Alliance quest related to the [[world PvP]] objective of [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. It involves capturing three strategic locations surrounding [[Hellfire Citadel]]. A player can only complete it once every 24 hours.

==Objectives==
Capture the [[Overlook]], the [[Stadium]] and [[Broken Hill]], then return to [[Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell]] in [[Honor Hold]].
*Capture The Overlook
*Capture the Stadium
*Capture Broken Hill

==Description==
The Hellfire Citadel wages constant battles with our forces. We are holding our own so far, but we can't yet launch a real offensive against them. To do that, we need forward staging areas.

Our [[scout]]s identified three fortifications near Hellfire Citadel. We want you to help secure these forts. Capture each fort, and then report back to me.

May fortune shine upon you in the conflicts ahead, <name>, for you will no doubt clash with Horde forces eager to gain these same fortifications.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost||70}}

* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
<Name>, return to me when you have aided in the capture of each of the forts!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Your actions in the field are instrumental in our battle for Hellfire Peninsula.

==Notes==
*In order to capture the locations, your faction must have more members inside the objective than the opposing faction whilst having PvP enabled.
