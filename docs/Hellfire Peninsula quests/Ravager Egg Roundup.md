==Objectives==
Retrieve 12 Ravager Eggs for [[Legassi]] at the [[Zeppelin Crash]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. 
*[[Ravager Egg]] (12)

==Description==
I'm starving!

There's irony in that, wouldn't you say? A starving cook?

<Legassi laughs half-heartedly and taps a folded piece of parchment he has in his pocket.>

According to this tourist map we were following - before we were so rudely shot down - there's an area to the southwest, near [[Terokkar Forest]]. It's called the [[Razorthorn Trail]], and supposedly it's brimming with delicious [[ravager]] eggs!

I could cook up quite a feast if only someone were brave enough to go down there and get me some!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5x [[Ravager Egg Omelet]]
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at max level)

==Progress==
You have those eggs yet?

<Legassi's stomach grumbles in anticipation.>

==Completion==
In order to have great cuisine, you need to have great ingredients. And these eggs look great!

I've just finished cleaning off my frying pan, so you're more than welcome to join me for a meal!
