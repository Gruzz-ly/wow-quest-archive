[[Expedition Point]] is a prerequisite for this quest.

==Objectives==
Retrieve Mysteries of the Light and return it to [[Father Malgor Devidicus]] at [[Honor Hold]].
* [[Mysteries of the Light]]

==Description==
<The [[priest]]'s gaze slowly moves from his mug to you.>

Don't you know better than to bother a man in his cups?

Oh, what's the use? I suppose newcomers are a good sign.  What would [[Turalyon]] think?

I remember the eve of our departure, when I gave Mysteries of the Light to him.  During the campaign and the ensuing years, he never forgot to read his daily passage to the men.

When he left us again, he gave the book back to me.  Like a fool, I believed it safe in my quarters to the south of the armory.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
* 9800 xp, or {{cost||1|17}} at level 70
* +250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
I thought I asked you not to bother me.  What is it?

==Completion==
Is that really it?  It's hard to believe it survived the battle.  Conditions in the ruins haven't been kind to the book, but still, I'm glad to have it.

It's the only token I have of Turalyon.

<Father Devidicus seems to be fighting back tears.>

When you fight beside someone for so many years, they become closer than even family.
