'''Hellfire Fortifications''' is the Horde quest related to the [[world PvP]] objective of [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. It involves capturing three strategic locations surrounding [[Hellfire Citadel]]. It can only be completed once every 24 hours.

==Objectives==
Capture the [[Overlook]], the [[Stadium]] and [[Broken Hill]], then return to [[Battlecryer Blackeye]] in [[Thrallmar]].
*Capture The Overlook
*Capture the Stadium
*Capture Broken Hill

==Description==
The [[fel orc]]s of Hellfire Citadel must be scoured from our birthland! To attack them, we must first secure forward staging points near the Citadel.

Our [[outrunner]]s found three fortifications that will suit this purpose, but the [[Alliance]] has the same idea and even now sends forces to take them!

We want you to stop the Alliance and capture these forts. Aid in the capture of each fort and then return to me.

For the [[Horde]]!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost||70}}
|q=3|Mark of Thrallmar}}

* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Return to me after you have helped capture each fort!

==Completion==
Nice work, <name>. I could almost hear the battles raged at those forts. I wish I could be there to see them!

==Notes==
*In order to capture the locations, your faction must have more members inside the objective than the opposing faction.
