==Objectives==
Bring [[Warlord Morkh]]'s Shattered Armor to [[Corporal Ironridge]] in [[Expedition Point]].
*[[Morkh's Shattered Armor]]

==Description==
You have shown great strength and fortune, for you have delved into [[Zeth'Gor]] and lived! Now, let us hope your fortune holds, for I have a dire task to ask of you...

Warlord Morkh sits within the [[barracks]] of Zeth'Gor, commanding his [[fel]] troops against us. His tactics are as clever as they are cruel, and I must admit that his successes against us have cut deep. And so, <name>, I ask you to remove Morkh from his seat. Bring me his armor so that we might display it for our soldiers and bolster them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]
* 6600 XP ({{cost||39|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Do you have Morkh's shattered armor?  Have you braved Zeth'Gor again? 

==Completion==
You've done it!  Morkh is slain!  Now, we have a fighting chance against the [[fel orc]] beasts!

Thank you, <name>.  Your aid to the war effort here is beyond measure.

==Notes==
On his death, the [[Eye of the Citadel]] will spawn.
