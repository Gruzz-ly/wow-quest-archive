==Objectives==
[[Magistrix Carinda]] wants you to interrogate [[Magister Aledis]], last seen traveling from [[Falcon Watch]] to [[Zangarmarsh]].

==Description==
[[Arelion's Journal|Arelion's journal]] does not deal with any sort of scholarly studies. It details his escapades with a young female blood elf! How could I've been such a fool?

Unfortunately, the floozy's identity is not revealed in this journal. Aledis, a colleague of [[Arelion]]'s, was his best friend and confidant. Go question him and find out who he was having this affair with.

I saw Aledis leave Falcon Watch for Zangarmarsh. Follow the road headed north from town; it'll eventually lead west, toward Zangarmarsh.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*7600 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|83|}} at level 70)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
I'll talk, <class>.  Put your weapon down, I don't want any more trouble.

==Notes==
