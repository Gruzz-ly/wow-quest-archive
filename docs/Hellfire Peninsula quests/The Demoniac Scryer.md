==Objectives==
Use the [[:Demoniac Scryer]] in [[Hellfire Basin]], wait for it to attune, and then take a reading.

Return the Demoniac Scryer and the [[:Demoniac Scryer Reading]] to [[Apothecary Antonivich]] in [[Thrallmar]].
*[[Demoniac Scryer]] (provided)
*[[Demoniac Scryer Reading]]

==Description==
The Demoniac Scryer is now ready. Take it behind [[Hellfire Citadel]], to Hellfire Basin, and summon it upon the ground. It will then begin to attune itself to Hellfire Citadel. After its attunement, speak to the Scryer and transcribe what it tells you. Bring that transcription to me...

Go, <name>, but only when you are ready. There is no doubt that Hellfire Citadel will detect the Scryer and send wardens to destroy it!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Demoniac Soul Prison}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|4}}
*12200 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|47|}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Do you have the reading?  Has your mission with the Demonaic Scryer been successful?

==Completion==
You obtained the reading?  Excellent—I am sure this data will prove invaluable to our research.  I will disseminate it to [[Apothecary Zelana|Apothecaries Zelana]] and [[Apothecary Albreck|Albreck]].

You should be proud, <name>.  Your strength and bravery is unquestionable... as is your service to the [[Horde]].

==Notes==
Go to Hellfire Basin and use the quest item. After planting the [[Demoniac Scryer (object)|Demoniac Scryer]] you must protect it from [[Hellfire Wardling]]s and a [[Fel Warden]]. It has an accompanying gossip:
:Greetings, <class>. If I might be so bold, may I remind you that -- while I attune myself to the magics of Hellfire Citadel -- there will undoubtedly be Hellfire wardens biting at my proverbial heels!

:So, do be an upstanding member of your Horde and play the part of the hero... and protect me!

*{{Text|say|Hellfire Wardling|Die!}}
*{{Text|say|Hellfire Wardling|Your end has come!}}
*{{Text|say|Hellfire Wardling|An intruder!  Begone!}}
*{{Text|say|Hellfire Wardling|You will burn!}}
*{{Text|say|Fel Warden|Die, interloper!  Your puny device cannot pierce the dark magics of Hellfire Citadel!}}

;Channeling complete
:Success! I have attuned myself to Hellfire Citadel and the magic within. Ah, such power!

:There are countless [[fel orc]]s in that place... but that is not all! I sense [[Magtheridon|demonic power]] within those walls as well...

:If you open yourself, then I shall grasp your mind -- briefly, mind you -- and take quill to parchment and record my findings for you...

:{{gossip|Yes, Scryer. You may possess me.}}

After that you gain the "Demonaic Visitation" debuff: "A dark presence is within you...". It lasts two minutes.

;When it expires
:{{text|whisper|Demoniac Visitation|Thank you for allowing me to visit, <name>.  You have a very colorful soul, but it's a little brighter than I prefer... or I might have stayed longer!}}
