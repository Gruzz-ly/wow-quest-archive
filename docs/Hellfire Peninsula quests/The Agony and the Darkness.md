==Objectives==
[[Magister Bloodhawk]] wants you to kill 10 Terrorfiends in the [[Pools of Aggonar]]. 
*[[Terrorfiend]] slain (10)

==Description==
Greetings, &lt;name&gt;. I've deciphered the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] missive and uncovered the [[demon]]s' strategic plans for this [[Hellfire Peninsula|Peninsula]]. Apparently, there is a large group of hellish terrorfiends gathering near the Pools of Aggonar in the west. We cannot allow such a force to go unchallenged. You must go there and decimate their cursed numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Well, <Class> - have the terrorfiends been defeated?

==Completion==
Bravo, <name>. I knew you would be victorious! The Legion's defeat draws ever nearer! 

==Patch changes==
