==Objectives==
Take the Mysterious Tome to [[Althen the Historian]] in [[Spinebreaker Post]]. 
*[[A Mysterious Tome]] (provided)

==Description==
This tome appears to be some sort of history written in a secret [[Alliance]] cipher. Althen, the historian in Spinebreaker Post, has studied the [[Unyielding]] for some time; he may be able to crack the Alliance code and decipher the book.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||11|40}} at level 70)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
What is this?  A book carried by an Unyielding [[Ghost|spirit]]?  How strange.  Let me study it.  Perhaps I can learn the history of the Unyielding.

==Completion==
I have studied ancient history my entire un-life.  I have never seen anything like this book.  It tells the entire history of the [[Expedition Armory|Armory]], including events that happened after its destruction.

The Unyielding have kept their history, even after they had fallen in battle.  With this book we will be able to understand the Unyielding and convince them to join us.
