==Objectives==
Slay Arazzius the Cruel in the [[Pools of Aggonar]] and return to [[Force Commander Danath Trollbane]] in the keep of [[Honor Hold]].
* [[Arazzius the Cruel]] slain

==Description==
The [[Warp-Scryer Kryv|honorable Warp-Scryer]] has told me of your perils, <name> - and of the new foe you've discovered. If Kryv is to be believed, this '[[Arazzius the Cruel]]' is as powerful and evil as any foe the [[Sons of Lothar]] have ever faced.

Will you stand for us now, <name>? Will you face this Legionlord and deliver the [[Light]]'s justice upon him? If so, you will find him at the [[Pools of Aggonar]]. If not, his evil will most certainly find you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vengeance of the Illidari
|Bladefist's Breadth
|Regal Protectorate
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|8|70|}}
* 15550 xp or {{cost|8|58|50}} at level 70
* +500 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Tell me, <name>, has the deed been done?  Has the Legionlord been vanquished?

==Completion==
Light be praised, I knew you'd do it! Arazzius and his minions are no more! Soon, we'll have the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] running for home and [[Outland|this battered world]] will be safe once more. Then, when justice has been met, we can return home as well.

Thanks you, <name> - the [[Alliance]] and the Sons of Lothar honor you this day!
