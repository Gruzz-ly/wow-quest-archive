==Objectives==
Search for crash survivors. 

==Description==
When I was wounded in the wastes I saw a [[goblin]] [[zeppelin]] crash. It went down to the northwest, beyond the [[Expedition Armory]].

The zeppelin was on fire. Shrieking, burning goblins were falling like bombs from the sky. Of course I was in a lot of pain and I had lost a lot of blood. I may have imagined the whole thing.

If you can find any survivors, we can offer them sanctuary here at [[Spinebreaker Post]].

==Rewards==
*2400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||28|80}} at level 70)

==Completion==
We were shot down by the [[Burning Legion]], even though we waved a [[flag of truce]]. Who knew the Burning Legion was so mean?

We cannot come with you to Spinebreaker Post. We need to repair our zeppelin and be on our way.

==Progression==
