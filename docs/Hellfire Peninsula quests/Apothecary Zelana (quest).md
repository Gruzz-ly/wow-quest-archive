Players need to search out '''Apothecary Zelana''' who is studying the creatures of Outland.

==Objectives==
[[Vurtok Axebreaker]] in [[Thrallmar]] wants you to bring Bonechewer Blood Samples to [[Apothecary Zelana]] at [[Reaver's Fall]]. 
*[[Bonechewer Blood Samples]] (provided)

==Description==
Apethecary{{sic}} Zelana has been studying the beasts of [[Hellfire Peninsula]] in the field. She wants a sample of the blood you gathered; with luck, she might discover what turned those [[Bonechewer clan|Bonechewer]] bastards' skins red!

Zelana is at Reaver's Fall, southeast of Thrallmar. Follow the road east and when you see a destroyed, green-glowing hunk of metal, you're there. She has a camp set up behind the wyverns. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|s=23}}
*1650 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]] 

==Progress==
It is my honor to serve the wishes of the [[Horde]].  How might I aid you?  

==Completion==
Ah, yes.  The blood of the bonechewer clan.  I am very curious about these orcs... they are still the depraved fiends of the past, but their strength and power is greater than what I had heard...

Well, let us begin, shall we?  

==Notes==
Reaver's Fall is on a hill east of Thrallmar. Once you give Zelana the blood, she will perform a short test on the blood using the equipment behind her. After finishing the test, she will give you the next quest.

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Apothecary Zelana|Thank you, <name>.  Now, to perform the test...}}
:{{Text|say|Apothecary Zelana|Ah, I see...}}
:{{Text|say|Apothecary Zelana|Yes, this is unfortunate.}}
:{{Text|say|Apothecary Zelana|<Name>, I have confirmed that this blood is from the Bonechewer clan of orcs, tainted with demonic power.  I'm afraid, however, that my current equipment can delve no deeper into this mystery...}}

==Progression==
{{Boiling Blood}}
