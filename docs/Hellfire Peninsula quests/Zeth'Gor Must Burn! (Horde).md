==Objectives==
Kill [[Bleeding Hollow Peon]]s for their [[Bleeding Hollow Torch|torches]], ignite them at [[Zeth'Gor]]'s forge then throw the [[Burning Bleeding Hollow Torch|burning torches]] at Zeth'Gor Buildings.
* Barracks Burned
* Eastern Hovel Burned
* Western Hovel Burned
* Stable Burned

==Description==
The [[Bleeding Hollow clan]] have betrayed their noble heritage! We, the [[orc]]s who fought and died to save ourselves from the [[fel]] taint of [[Mannoroth]], look upon our vile cousins and see only weakness and ignobility... and for that, they must burn!

Enter Zeth'Gor, their bastion to the east, and burn their buildings. Kill peons for their torches, ignite them at their forge, and hurl the burning torches at their hovels, their stable and their barracks. Burn them all, and then return to me!

For the [[Horde]]!

==Progress==
Zeth'Gor must burn, <name>! Speak with me again when your task is complete.

==Completion==
Hah!  I could see the smoke and flames of Zeth'Gor from here!  May the Bleeding Hollow fiends burn to ash and drift far from the sight of any true orc!

Thank you, <name>.  You helped burn away an afront to every orc's spirit.
