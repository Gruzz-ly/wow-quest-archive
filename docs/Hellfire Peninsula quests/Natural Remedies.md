==Objectives==
[[File:Natural Remedies TCG.jpg|thumb|In the [[TCG]].]]
Use the Seed of Revitalization at the [[Earthbinder's Circle]] to heal the land around the crystal. Then, return to [[Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze]] at the [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] with any information that you gain.
*[[Fallen Sky Ridge]] Revitalized
*[[Seed of Revitalization]] (provided)

==Description==
It must be that the evil emanations from that giant crystal are summoning the mountain giants and driving them insane.

It's too big to move, and beyond our ability to destroy, but I know a way to quell its power.

I've summoned a circle at the northwest corner of the crystal on the ridge. Take this seed to the circle and channel its powers to heal the land through the natural forces of rain, growth and insect repopulation.

Beware, <name>, I sense an external force at play here... this is not natural!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Studded Green Anklewraps
|Destroyers' Mantle
|Golden Cenarion Greaves
|Verdant Handwraps
}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|5|80}}
*12330 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did it work? &nbsp;What did you learn? &nbsp;Did you find out who or what is behind what happened at [[Fallen Sky Ridge]]?

==Completion==
[[Goliathon]]? &nbsp;[[Pathaleon the Calculator]]?

[[Kael'thas Sunstrider|KAEL'THAS]]!?

Prince Kael'thas has a hand in this?

<The earthbinder fumes.>

It is insanity what he has done!  Dropping giant crystals from the sky and decimating the land can only be the work of a madman!

I can assure you, the [[Cenarion Expedition]] will counter any further attempts by their forces to do this ever again.

We owe you a great debt, <name>.

==Notes==
;Upon using the seed
:{{Text|say|Pathaleon the Calculator's Image|And just what do you think you are doing?  You dare to interfere with [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|my master's]] experiment?}}
:{{Text|say|Pathaleon the Calculator's Image|Do you like what we've done here?  Perhaps we will drop these crystals from the sky all over [[Outland]].}}
:{{Text|say|Pathaleon the Calculator's Image|I grow bored with your attempt to heal the land and quell the energies summoning and driving the [[Colossus|colossi]] mad.  [[Goliathon]], King of the Colossi, Prince Kael'thas and I demand that you defend the crystal!}}
:{{Text|say|Pathaleon the Calculator's Image|We will meet again soon.}}

;If the ritual fails
:{{Text|say|Pathaleon the Calculator's Image|Hah! Your ritual has failed, fool!}}
