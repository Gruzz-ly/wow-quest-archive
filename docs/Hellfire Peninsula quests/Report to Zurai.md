==Objectives==
Report to [[Zurai]] at [[Swamprat Post]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].

==Description==
With the arrival of [[Field Commander Romus]] and his forces, the [[Alliance]] and their [[draenei]] friends have grown bold. They're militarizing every old draenei ruin from here to [[Shattrath]].

In response, the [[Jungle troll|trolls]] have established a new outpost in the eastern part of Zangarmarsh, just south of the [[Dead Mire]]. Swamprat Post, they're calling it. I'm glad they have a sense of humor about living in a place like that, because I wouldn't relish it.

The post's commander has asked me to send anyone I can spare.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||28|80}} at level 70)

==Completion==
To be honest, I had expected more, but you'll have to do. Welcome to Swamprat Post.

==Patch changes==
