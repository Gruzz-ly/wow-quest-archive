This quest is part of the '''Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways''' quest chain. This quest chain starts with [[Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways]].

==Objectives==
[[Forward Commander Kingston]] wants you to speak with [[Wing Commander Dabir'ee]], ride a [[gryphon]] to [[Shatter Point]], and then report to [[Runetog Wildhammer]].

==Description==
<Name>, you've done a great job here at the front, and you showed a lot of talent with that armored gryphon... I think I have another mission in mind for you.

This new mission launches from Shatter Point—an attack base the [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammers]] set up on a floating piece of land near the [[Dark Portal|Portal]]. It's a little unnerving there, but you have tough guts. You'll be fine.

Talk to Wing Commander Dabir'ee and have him send you to Shatter Point. From there, report to the gryphon master Runetog Wildhammer.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*650 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|90}} at level 70)

==Completion==
Hah hah!  A fresh <race> from the mainland!  Well don't worry—Shatter Point might make you queasy but she doesn't stray far!

And I've only seen her flip upside down once... or twice.

==Progression==
