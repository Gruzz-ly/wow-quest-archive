== Objectives ==
[[General Krakork]] in [[Thrallmar]] wants you to speak with [[Nazgrel]].

==Description==
Though our [[warrior]]s are without peer, our hold on [[Hellfire Peninsula|this wasteland]] is still tenuous. Report to Nazgrel inside the [[barracks]] - he has need of agents... such as you. If we can't protect our holdings here, we'll be of no use to anyone. Now go!

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*3300 [[XP]] (or {{cost||19|80}} at level 70)

==Completion==
We've already lost many brave warriors to this cursed wasteland. I have little interest in sending more untested recruits to the slaughter.

<Nazgrel glares at you sternly through his ragged [[wolf]]-mask.>

Still, if General Krakork sent you to me, he must have seen something in you. What say you then, <name>? Will you serve [[Thrall|your warchief]] with honor?
