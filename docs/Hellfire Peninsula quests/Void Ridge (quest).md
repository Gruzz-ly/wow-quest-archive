'''Void Ridge''' sends the player the [[Void Ridge]] to find items that will improve Ogath's warp rift generator.

==Objectives==
Go to [[Void Ridge]] and kill the creatures you find. Collect 40 [[Void Ridge Soul Shard]]s and return them to [[Ogath the Mad]] in [[Spinebreaker Post]].
*[[Void Ridge Soul Shard]] (40)

==Description==
We have to improve my warp rift generator. You must take it to Void Ridge. Head east of here. You must avoid the foul fort of [[Zeth'Gor]]. To the east beyond Zeth'Gor is a small pass through the mountains. Through this pass you will find Void Ridge, a terrible place on the edge of the abyss.

You must kill the [[Voidwalker|walkers]] that you find there, and bring me shards of their [[soul]]s. With their power we will improve upon the warp rift generator and open a [[portal]] to the beyond that cannot be closed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2}}
* 9800 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
You have done it then?  You have the shards that we need? 

==Completion==
Excellent, the warp rift generator is almost complete.  There is only one final ingredient we require.  Soon we shall be able to open up a warp rift to the deepest parts of the abyss.  

Who knows what strange creature may come through?  Think of it <name>, the power such knowledge will bring is limitless. 

==Notes==
Void Ridge is to the east of Spinebreaker Post. You will find two types of voidwalkers there which have a chance of dropping one or more Shards.

#Collapsing Voidwalkers - These are melee voidwalkers that will explode for Shadow damage (approximately 1500 damage) when they die. Around 10% health, they will try to self-destruct anyway. Run away when you see the self-destruct message. If you have a shadow protection ability, it's a good idea to use it here.

#Vacillitating Voidwalkers - These will absorb the first magic spell cast at them and will become resistant to that type of magic. They will also use that spell back at you. Try to use a type of magic you have high resistance too. Shamans would be wise to use Frost Shock and Frost Resistance totem as shamans usually use more nature/fire magic. If you aren't a spellcaster, they will fire shadowbolts at a very fast rate (1.5 sec cast time). For melee classes, it might be better to stick with Collapsing Voidwalkers.
