'''Bonechewer Blood''' sends the Horde player to thin the ranks of the Bonechewer orcs and bring back samples of their blood.

==Objectives==
Bring 12 Bonechewer Blood Vials to [[Vurtok Axebreaker]] in [[Thrallmar]].
*[[Bonechewer Blood]] (12)

==Description==
[[Bonechewer clan|Bonechewers]]! They should all die! The sight of their [[Fel orc|red skin]] and depravity makes my blood boil!

I have a mission for you, <name>. Kill Bonechewer [[orc]]s and collect their vile blood. There is an [[Apothecary Zelana|apothecary]] who needs the blood for her tests, so we can discover how these orcs fell to the [[demon]] taint, a taint from which we so recently freed ourselves.

Bonechewers scavenge near the ruined battlements along the [[Path of Glory]], to the south. Return to me when your mission is complete.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of the following:
|Adamantine Kite Shield
|Desolation Rod
|Hellfire Skiver
|Ironstar Repeater
|Landslide Buckler}}

You will also receive:
*6,600 XP
*{{cost||90}}
*+1,250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Did you face the bonechewers, <name>.{{sic}}  I hope their blood was spilled in great gouts!

==Completion==
Hah!  So you did meet the bonechewers, our depraved cousins.  Well done, <name>.  My only regret is that more of them could not lay down their lives and spill their blood, to cool my outrage!

==Notes==
You can get blood from any of the various Bonechewer orcs to the south of Thrallmar. These include Evokers, Scavengers, Mutants, and Raiders. The drop rate is only around 10%.

==Progression==
{{Boiling Blood}}
