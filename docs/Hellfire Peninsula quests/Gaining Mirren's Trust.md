==Objectives==
[[Mirren Longbeard]] wants you to bring him 1 [[Nethergarde Bitter]].  You must also attain {{Reputation|Friendly}} reputation with [[Honor Hold]] to complete this quest.
*[[Nethergarde Bitter]]
*[[Honor Hold]] (Friendly)

==Description==
So you want to gain our trust?  I don't trust many people these days.

We lost one of our own not long ago to the [[arakkoa]].  It's got me a bit on edge.

Tell you what, if you can prove your loyalty to [[Honor Hold]] and... bring me a mug of [[Nethergarde Bitter]]... yes, that sounds rather good about now... I'll have a deal to offer you then.

[[Bernie Heisten|Bernie]] at [[Nethergarde Keep]] keeps the bitter in stock.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
* +250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]
* 10050 xp or {{cost||58|50}} at level 70

==Progress==
Having trouble finding the bitter?  Good old Bernie at Nethergarde Keep should stock barrels of it.

Unless he's run out... that would be disastrous!

==Completion==
Why, yes!  You seem to be quite an OK <race>.  I suppose I can trust you.

==Notes==
As of {{Expac|Shadowlands}}, it becomes somewhat more difficult to get the beer because the player can no longer walk back through the Dark Portal to get to Nethergarde Keep. First the player needs to return to Stormwind via one of the portals next to the Dark Portal. After that, the player has options:

1) Simply walk all the way to Nethergarde Keep. The longest path, and the only one that's always available.

2) If the player has a Flight Path or Hearthstone at the [[Harborage]] in [[Swamp of Sorrows]], it can be used to significantly shorten the walk distance. Note that the flightpath at the Nethergarde Keep itself will not work due to phasing, and while the Hearthstone ''will'' work, it will drop the player in the present version of Blasted Lands in the middle of Ironmarch orcs - the player will need to go back to [[Zidormi]] to travel to the past and then return to Nethergarde Keep.

3) Accept [[Warlords of Draenor: The Dark Portal]] and speak to [[Vanguard Battlemage]] to get teleported to [[Shattershore]] in the present version of Blasted Lands. From there, make your way to [[Zidormi]] to travel to the past. Only possible if said quest has not been completed yet.
