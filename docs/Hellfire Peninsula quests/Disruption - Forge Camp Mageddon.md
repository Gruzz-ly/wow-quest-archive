==Objectives==
Kill 10 Gan'arg Servants and Razorsaw at [[Forge Camp: Mageddon|Forge Camp Mageddon]] and return to [[Field Marshal Brock|Forward Commander Brock]] at [[Honor Point (Hellfire Peninsula)|Honor Point]].
*[[Gan'arg Servant]] slain (10)
*[[Razorsaw]] slain

==Description==
Pay close attention, <name>. We've been surveying the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] camps that lie along the ridge ahead. We have reason to believe that these so-called 'Forge Camps' are where the demons are constructing those blasted [[Fel reaver|Fel Reavers]].

You can see the closest target, Forge Camp: Mageddon, to the west. Our intelligence suggests that it's still under construction. If you can slay the Gan'arg Servants and their master - Razorsaw - we can bring the Legion's Fel Reaver production to a grinding halt!

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Don't tell me your{{sic}} getting cold feet, <class>?  If they finish construction on that Forge Camp, you'll have more to worry about than just those Fel Reavers!  Get to it!

==Completion==
Well, I must say, I am impressed, <name>. I didn't think you had the mettle for this mission. Well done. Well done, indeed.

==Notes==
Try to clear the servants around the cannons in preparation for the next quest.  If there are other players also doing this quest, you can fly over to [[Forge Camp: Rage]] and kill the servants there.
