==Objectives==
Use the [[Felhound Whistle]] to summon a [[Fel Guard Hound]]. Take the Fel Guard Hound for a walk and kill some [[Deranged Helboar]]s. Search for the [[Shredder Keys]] in the Fel Guard Hound's "[[Felhound Poo|leavings]]." Return the Shredder Keys to [[Foreman Razelcraz]] by the mine northwest of [[Thrallmar]]. 
* [[Shredder Keys]]
* [[Felhound Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
I finally got my [[shredder]] working but I seem to have lost the keys. I keep a pack of [[felhound]]s to protect my camp. They don't do a very good job and they like to bite me a lot. They also like shiny things. I think this one felhound I have may have eaten my shredder keys. I'll pay you if you'll take my felhound on a walk. Kill some [[helboar]]s and let him eat. He'll do his business. When he's done, see if you can't find the keys in his "leavings."

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|4}}
|q=5|Ez-Thro Dynamite II}}

*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost||58|50}} at level 80)

==Progress==
Did you manage to find my keys?  I'm sure one of my felhounds ate them.  It's probably the one I sent with you.  Probably.

==Completion==
You smell terrible.  But you found my keys!  Thank you so much.  Now I can get my shredder started and make some money.  Pretty soon I will have enough money to leave [[Outland]].  I don't know why you stay; I hate this place.  Wouldn't you rather be back in [[Booty Bay]]?  

Maybe do some fishing?

==Notes==
After looting the poo, the player gets the Stanky debuff.

==Progression==
