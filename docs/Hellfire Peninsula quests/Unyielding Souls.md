==Objectives==
[[Honor Guard Wesilow]] wants you to defeat 12 [[Unyielding Footman]], 10 [[Unyielding Sorcerer]]s, and 5 [[Unyielding Knight]]s at the [[Expedition Armory]] to the south.
* [[Unyielding Footman]] slain (12)
* [[Unyielding Sorcerer]] slain (10)
* [[Unyielding Knight]] slain (5)

==Description==
Near the end of [[Invasion of Draenor|our invasion]], the [[Expedition Armory|Armory]] to the south fell under attack by the [[Horde of Draenor|Horde]]'s insidious [[Death knight|Death Knights]]. Those vile shades cursed the Armory's defenders - and trapped their [[soul]]s [[Veil|between the realms of the living and the dead]].

Those noble souls must be set free! I beg you, <name>, end my comrades' torment, for I have not the heart to slay them myself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
* 9800 XP (or {{cost|2|58|50}} at level 70)
* +250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
What I asked of you is a terrible thing to request of anyone.  But what you must understand is many of the men won't go near the ruins.  The memories and the pain are too fresh, but we can't allow the spirits to continue to wander.

The longer they persist, the more they shed their remaining ties to their past life and give themselves over to malevolence.

==Completion==
The [[Sons of Lothar|Sons]] appreciate your efforts, even if few are willing to speak of the armory.
