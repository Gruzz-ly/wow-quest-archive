==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Den of Haal'esh]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] and search the [[Kaliri Nest]]s for a [[Female Kaliri Hatchling]]. Use the Empty Birdcage to capture it and bring it to [[Falconer Drenna Riverwind]] at [[Falcon Watch]]. 
*[[Caged Female Kaliri Hatchling]]
*[[Empty Birdcage]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Haal'eshi]] arakkoa have domesticated a beautiful [[bird]] species called the [[kaliri]].

I've managed to capture a young male and they appear to be trainable. The females are much rarer, but if I had one I could attempt to breed them. She has to be young, though... a hatchling. An older wild bird wouldn't survive in captivity.

Take this cage and travel south, to the Den of Haal'esh. Search the nests for eggs that are ready to hatch. If you bring me back a female hatchling, I'll reward you handsomely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You've returned.  Did you bring me the kaliri female?

==Completion==
You did it!  You caught a female hatchling!

She's precious. You have my thanks, <name>.

==Notes==
;On completion
:''Drenna kneels next to [[Jia (NPC)|Jia]]'s cage and puts the [[Captive Female Kaliri]] in it.''
