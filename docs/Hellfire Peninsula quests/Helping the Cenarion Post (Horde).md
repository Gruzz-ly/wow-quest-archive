==Objectives==
[[Falconer Drenna Riverwind]] wants you to offer your services to [[Thiah Redmane]] at the [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Description==
<Class>, there's some [[tauren]] by the name of Thiah Redmane that keeps pestering us for assistance. She's with the [[Cenarion Expedition]], and they've setup a little post just to the west on the south side of the road leading to [[Zangarmarsh]].

If you hit [[Thornfang Hill]], you've gone too far.

Do you think you might head over there and see what she needs? I don't want to have to bother [[Ranger Captain Venn'ren]] with such trivialities.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||11|40}} at level 70)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Completion==
Oh, goodness, you must be the help I requested weeks ago from [[Falcon Watch]].

Well, you're here now and there's a lot to be done.  I have just the thing to start you out.
