This quest is part of the '''Through the Dark Portal''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Take a flight to [[Honor Hold]] and deliver Duron's Report to [[Marshal Isildor]].
*[[Duron's Report]] (provided)

==Description==
When you're ready, I'll arrange a flight straight to Honor Hold.

From there, speak with Marshal Isildor and give him [[Commander Duron|Duron]]'s report. He'll be happy to see another recruit from the homelands, and I'm sure the information in that report is important stuff!

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*2400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||28|80}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Thank the [[Light]] you made it here safely. Honor Hold needs all the seasoned warriors it can muster.

==Completion==
Our expedition to this forsaken wreck of a world has almost ground to a halt, <name>. We encountered more resistance than we bargained for.

As if facing the [[Burning Legion]] again wasn't bad enough - there are horrors in this land unlike anything we've ever encountered.

==Progression==
