[[Expedition Point]] is a prerequisite for this quest.

==Objectives==
Capture the [[Overlook]], the [[Stadium]] and [[Broken Hill]], then return to [[Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell]] in [[Honor Hold]].
* Capture The Overlook
* Capture the Stadium
* Capture Broken Hill

==Description==
The [[Hellfire Citadel]] wages constant battles with our forces.  We are holding our own so far, but we can't yet launch a real offensive against them.  To do that, we need forward staging areas.

Our scouts identified three fortifications near Hellfire Citadel.  We want you to help secure these forts.  Capture each fort, and then report back to me.

May fortune shine upon you in the conflicts ahead, <name>, for you will no doubt clash with [[Horde]] forces eager to gain these same fortifications. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost||70}}

* 4,300 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
<Name>, return to me when you have aided in the capture of each of the forts!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.  Your actions in the field are instrumental in our battle for [[Hellfire Peninsula]].
