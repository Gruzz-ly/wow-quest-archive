==Objectives==
[[Ranger Captain Venn'ren]] at [[Falcon Watch]] wants you to slay 8 Stonescythe Whelps and 3 Stonescythe Alphas at the [[Great Fissure]], east of [[Falcon Watch]]. 
*[[Stonescythe Whelp]] slain (8)
*[[Stonescythe Alpha]] slain (3)

==Description==
We're dangerously close to becoming fenced in by [[Alliance]] forces. With the influx of [[Blood elf|sin'dorei]] pilgrims from [[Azeroth]], we must establish a route that's safe from our enemies' prying eyes.

I've given it some thought and have arrived at a solution. We're to establish a secret path through the Great Fissure.

Yes, even though the area is crawling with brutal [[rock flayer]]s, they are merely beasts and can be taught to fear us. I want you to go and kill a good number of them. They shall learn fear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You've returned. Is the task done?

==Completion==
Good job, <name>.  That should teach the rock flayers to stay far away from us.

==Progression==
#[[Falcon Watch (quest)]] or [[Falcon Watch (blood elves)]]
#[[The Great Fissure (quest)]]
#[[Marking the Path]]
