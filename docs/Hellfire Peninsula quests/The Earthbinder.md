==Objectives==
Take the [[Crimson Crystal Shard]] to [[Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze]] at the [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. 
*[[Crimson Crystal Shard]] (provided)

==Description==
You should take the crystal lump over to the earthbinder. She's just like you... always needing to get to the bottom of a mystery and thinking all of the time.

If you ask me, she thinks a little too much.

Just give it to her and I'm sure that she'll get you into a heap of trouble figuring out what is going on up there on the ridge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*1050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||37|50}} at level 70)
*10 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Is that a piece from the giant crystal shard up on [[Fallen Sky Ridge]]?

==Completion==
Oh, excellent! I've been waiting to get my hands on a piece of that thing, but Tola'thion's been dragging his feet.

He's supposed to be out here helping me to investigate what's going on up on Fallen Sky Ridge. Instead he's just been sending poor dupes like you - no offense - up there into the slaughter mill.

If you give me the crystal maybe I can find a link between it and the [[Colossus|colossi]].

==Notes==
;On completion
:''Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze says:''
:{{text|say|I have an idea. Let's plant this in the ground and see what happens.}}
:''Galandria walks down from the small hill she is standing on, and plants the crystal. A [[Lured Colossus]] suddenly appears.''
:{{text|say|The evil emanating from the crystal shard has lured one of the colossi. Put it down quick!}}

After the player defeats the colossus, the quest [[Natural Remedies|Natural Remedies]] becomes available from Galandria.

Before patch 4.3.0, some players may have problems soloing the suddenly appearing colossus, which was elite at the time. A solution may have been that Galandria was almost able to defeat it by herself, giving fragile classes such as mages the choice to attack from a distance. Some players have, however, observed Galandria to instead run back up to her hill and just look at the fight during the entire encounter.
Patch 4.3.0 resulted in the Lured Colossus becoming no longer elite and the quest became a solo quest, rather than a group quest.
