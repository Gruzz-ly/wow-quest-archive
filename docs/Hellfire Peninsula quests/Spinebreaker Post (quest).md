==Objectives==
[[Apothecary Zelana]] at [[Reaver's Fall]] wants you to speak with [[Wing Commander Brack]] to take a [[wyvern]] to [[Spinebreaker Post]], and then bring the [[Bleeding Hollow Blood Sample]] to [[Apothecary Albreck]] at Spinebreaker Post.
*[[Bleeding Hollow Blood Sample]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, my equipment here is, unfortunately, not configured for all the tests I'd like to perform. However, my colleague at Spinebreaker Post, Apothecary Albreck, possesses the required implements.

I have acquired a sample of [[Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow]] blood -- gained from a past mission of [[Thrallmar]]'s agents. Take the sample to Albreck and allow him to study it.

To reach Spinebreaker Post, speak with Wing Commander Brack, near the wyverns to the south.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||23|}}
*1650 [[XP]] (or {{cost||10|20}} at level 70)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Welcome to Spinebreaker Post.  How might my talents serve you?

==Completion==
A blood test, is it?  It will be my pleasure.  I always enjoy working with blood...
