==Objectives==
Look for [[Gremni Longbeard]] northwest of the [[Den of Haal'esh]], to the far west of [[Honor Hold]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Description==
We were having a problem with [[arakkoa]] [[bandit]]s raiding many of our supply [[caravan]]s, so I hired some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] to take care of them.

They were brothers; Gremni Longbeard was the oldest.

I'm a little worried about them. Those crazy dwarves packed more ale than food or ammunition! Maybe you can go check up on them?

The arakkoa's hideout, the Den of Haal'esh, can be found to the far west of here - beyond the [[Great Fissure]]. They set up camp northwest of there, south of [[Dustquill Ravine]].

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*1000 [[XP]] (or {{cost||24|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
How'd you find us, <class>?  No matter, I imagine you were sent here to give us a hand.  Let's get to work then!
