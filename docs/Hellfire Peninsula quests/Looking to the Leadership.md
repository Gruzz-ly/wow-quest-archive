==Objectives==
Overcome the [[ghost]]s of Arch Mage Xintor and Lieutenant Commander Thalvos and return to [[Honor Guard Wesilow]] in the [[tower]] northwest of [[Honor Hold]].
* [[Arch Mage Xintor]] slain
* [[Lieutenant Commander Thalvos]] slain

==Description==
The disturbances at [[Expedition Armory]] continue, despite your best efforts. No one truly knows everything that happened there, nor exactly what binds the spirits of the fallen soldiers to the ruins.

Perhaps we've been approaching this the wrong way. I've always assumed that each of the ghosts had a tie to the ruins, but what if their ties were to their leaders?

Arch Mage Xintor and Lieutenant Commander Thalvos were particularly close to their men, so perhaps overcoming their ghosts will calm the rest.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Draenethyst Chaplet
|Enforcer's Chain
|Finely Wrought Chain
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
* 9,580 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Were you able to overcome the officers at the ruins?

==Completion==
We can only hope that with the quieting of the ghosts of the officers, the spirits of the foot soldiers will follow. Thank you once again for your help, <name>.

==Progression==
