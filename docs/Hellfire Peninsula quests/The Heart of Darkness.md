==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Terrorfiend]]s in the [[Pools of Aggonar]] and return to [[Warp-Scryer Kryv]] in the main keep of [[Honor Hold]].
*Terrorfiend slain (10)

== Description==
It is just as I feared. Arix'Amal - the demon you killed earlier, was working for a secret Legionlord - [[Arazzius the Cruel]]. It appears this new villain has amassed a force of hellish terrorfiends near the Pools of Aggonar.

You must journey there and slay the terrorfiends before they strike against us. But be wary, friend - the Pools of Aggonar lie within a tortured, poisonous valley. You can find the cursed pools to the northwest of here, beyond [[Hellfire Citadel]].

Light be with you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2||}}
* 9800 xp (or {{cost|2|58|50}} at level 70)
* +250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
I sense a growing darkness within your heart, <Class>.  Have you faced your fear?  Of does it still await you at the Pools of Aggonar?

==Completion==
I foresaw this great victory, <name>. The blessed [[naaru]] smile upon you this day.
