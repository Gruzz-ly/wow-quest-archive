==Objectives==
Collect 30 pieces of [[:Zeppelin Debris]] and bring them to [["Screaming" Screed Luckheed]] at the [[Zeppelin Crash]]. 
*[[Zeppelin Debris]] (30)

==Description==
In the event of an emergency, it's always the pilot's job to keep a level head, especially when the only orders your co-pilot follows come from his stomach.

The good news is that we won't need to wait days for replacement parts to be imported. The bad news is that the "spare" parts got scattered from here to the [[Valley of Bones]] to the east.

The other bad news? The spare parts aren't so spare. They, uh, fell off during our rapid descent. Could you help me collect enough to get us off the ground again?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Flintlocke's Piloting Pants|Aerodynamic Scaled Vest|Dirigible Crash Helmet}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Did you find enough of the parts? If not, I might have to use that frying pan [[Legassi]] keeps waving around. Then, I'd have to rename the [[zeppelin]] the "Flying Skillet."

==Completion==
Some of this is in pretty bad shape, but there should be enough to work with here. With some creative engineering, I'm confident I can make it work!
