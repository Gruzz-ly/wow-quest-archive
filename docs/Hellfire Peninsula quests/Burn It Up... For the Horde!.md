==Objectives==
Use the Flaming Torch to burn the Eastern [[Alliance Cannon]] and the Western [[Alliance Cannon]], and then return to [[Megzeg Nukklebust]] in [[Thrallmar]]. 
*Eastern Cannon Burned
*Western Cannon Burned
*[[Flaming Torch (Hellfire Peninsula)#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm a lucky, lucky [[goblin]]. I get to make explosives and killing machines, knowing they'll be used immediately on important missions!

Speaking of missions, I just got one from Thrallmar command: burn the [[Alliance cannon]]s on the far side of the [[Path of Glory]]... the ones pointing dangerously close to [[Horde]] fortifications. Take this torch and make your way to each cannon. Fire the torch and watch the sparks fly!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Wanderer's Stitched Trousers|Nature-Stitched Kilt|Helm of Affinity|Scale Brand Breastplate}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
I've been looking for the telltale signs of burning [[cannon]]s—smoke plumes, or the cries of burning [[fel orc]]s...

Any luck on your mission?

==Completion==
I thought so! I couldn't quite make out the destruction from here, but I can imagine how it must have looked. Splendid!

Well done, <name>. Thrallmar command will be happy to hear of your success!
