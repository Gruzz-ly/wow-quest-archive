==Objectives==
[[Scout Vanura]] at the [[Temple of Telhamat]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to slay 8 Stonescythe Whelps and 4 Stonescythe Alpha. 
*[[Stonescythe Whelp]] slain (8)
*[[Stonescythe Alpha]] slain (4)

==Description==
The [[Broken]] that live in [[Outland]] have endured endless violence. It is of little surprise that as soon as the [[Dark Portal]] opened they flocked to it in droves with hopes of escaping this land.

Unfortunately for our confused brothers and sisters coming from the south, the [[rock flayer]]s that inhabit the [[Great Fissure]] see them as easy prey. Go there and thin the rock flayer population, so that our kin might have a chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Welcome back, <name>. Have you completed the task I asked of you?

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>.  It is always unfortunate to have to resort to taking a life, even when it's that of a dangerous beast such as the rock flayer.

You have my thanks for carrying out this grim task.
