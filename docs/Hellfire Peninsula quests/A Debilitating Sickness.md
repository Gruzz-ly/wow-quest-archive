==Objectives==
[[Earthcaller Ryga]] at [[Mag'har Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to bring her 1 Drycap Mushroom from a cave inside the [[Great Fissure]].
* [[Drycap Mushroom]]

==Description==
It is good that you've offered to aid us, <name>. Our [[grunt]]s have fallen sick from drinking contaminated water and I'm missing an ingredient to produce a healing salve. I'm in need of a rare mushroom called drycap.

Our foremost orders are to keep our location secret and not risk being spotted while looking for it, or I would go myself. The only place in Hellfire Peninsula where drycap grows is a cave at the Great Fissure, south of here.

Be extremely careful if you choose to seek it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,860 [[XP]]
* +550 reputation with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
Did you obtain the mushroom I need, <name>?

==Completion==
[[Gorkan Bloodfist|Gorkan]] said good things about you.  They're all turning out to be true.

Thanks for your help.

==Notes==
*Players that have finished the quest [[Envoy to the Mag'har]] prior to ''Cataclysm'' are able to accept and do this quest.
*The cave you are looking for is in the Great Fissure, east of [[Falcon Watch]]. You can see the cave shown on the map at 34,64. The mushrooms are inside the cave and herbalist will be able to see them on their minimap.

==Progression==
*[[A Debilitating Sickness]]
**[[Administering the Salve]]
