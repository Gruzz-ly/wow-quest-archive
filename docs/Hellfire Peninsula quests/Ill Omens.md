==Objectives==
[[Lieutenant Amadi]] in [[Honor Hold]] wants you to bring 1 Cursed Talisman to [[Corporal Ironridge]] at [[Expedition Point]].
*[[Cursed Talisman (quest item)]]

==Description==
<Name>, in our battles with the [[Bleeding Hollow clan]] of [[fel orc]]s, we have found upon them foreboding trinkets.  These orcs have collected the insignias of fallen [[Honor Hold]] [[soldier]]s and created cursed talismans from them.  We fear the dark [[magic]] of the Bleeding Hollow orcs have transformed our insignias into evil charms with powers against us!

Find such a talisman from the Bleeding Hollow orcs of [[Zeth'Gor]], to the east, and bring it to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point, northeast of Zeth'Gor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80|}} if completed at level 90.
*2,250 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Reporting from Honor Hold, <name>?  That's good -- our campaign against the [[demon]]s and the fel orcs is running thin on able bodies!

==Completion==
Ah, you recovered an insignia from the Bleeding Hollow orcs?  Good—it is outrageous that they use our own symbols against us, and mock our comrades who've fallen to those red-skinned beasts!
