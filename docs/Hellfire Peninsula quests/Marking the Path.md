==Objectives==
[[Ranger Captain Venn'ren]] at [[Falcon Watch]] wants you to go to the [[Great Fissure]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] and light the Southern Beacon, Western Beacon and Central Beacon. Return to him with the Lit Torch after you've completed this task.
*[[Western Beacon]]
*[[Central Beacon]]
*[[Southern Beacon]]
*[[Lit Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
With the [[rock flayer]] population thinned, all that's left is to signal the safe path to our pilgrims. Return to the Great Fissure with this torch and seek the three beacons that mark the path from the east.

Light the three beacons and return to me. Be warned that the beacons will attract any nearby rock flayers when you first light them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Lightbearer's Gauntlets|Flamehandler's Gloves|Pilgrim's Belt}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Have you done what I asked of you, <name>?

==Completion==
The Great Fissure, though still dangerous, will prove to be a useful path for our pilgrims.

With the [[Alliance]] watching all the roads in and out of [[Falcon Watch]] this is the manner of desperate act that is required of us.
