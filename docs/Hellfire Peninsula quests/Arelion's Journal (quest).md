==Objectives==
[[Magistrix Carinda]] at [[Falcon Watch]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to go to the [[Pools of Aggonar]] and retrieve Arelion's Journal.
*[[Arelion's Journal]]

==Description==
My husband, [[Slime-Covered Corpse|Arelion]], had been fascinated with the Pools of Aggonar ever since we arrived in [[Outland]]. He spent much of his time studying [[Ooze|slimes]], of all things!

He went missing in there a few days ago. They say he's dead and there's nothing I can do about it.

One thing I can do is try to ensure that his research doesn't die with him. Go northeast to the pools and look for his journal. He always carried it inside a brown knapsack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Any luck, <name>?  You'll find the Pools of Aggonar north of [[Hellfire Citadel]]. 

==Completion==
My husband's journal... it's not about research at all!

How could I've been such a fool?  "Magical properties of [[fel]]-infused slime forms," he really had me going there.
