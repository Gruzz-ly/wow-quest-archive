==Objectives==
[[Emissary Mordiba|Mordiba]] wants you to defeat 12 Unyielding Footmen, 8 Unyielding Knights, and 6 Unyielding Sorcerers at the [[Expedition Armory]] to the west of [[Spinebreaker Post]]. 
*[[Unyielding Footman]] slain (12)
*[[Unyielding Sorcerer]] slain (6)
*[[Unyielding Knight]] slain (8)

==Description==
I was sent here to make contact with the [[Unyielding]] [[Ghost|spirits]]. These once proud [[Alliance Expedition|Alliance]] soldiers were defeated long ago, and now their cursed spirits haunt the ruins to the west.

If they would only join us we would gain a powerful ally. Imagine, a legion of undying warriors to use against our enemies. But these [[undead]] are mad with hatred and will not listen to me.

Perhaps they can be forced to join us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Have you taught the Unyielding the consequences of defying the [[Forsaken]]?

==Completion==
The Unyielding have felt the strength of the [[Horde of Draenor|Horde]]. &nbsp;No doubt they will soon be in the mood to listen to my proposed alliance.
