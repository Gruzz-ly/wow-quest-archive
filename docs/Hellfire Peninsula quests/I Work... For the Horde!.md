==Objectives==
Bring 8 pieces of Salvaged Metal and 8 pieces of Salvaged Wood to [[Megzeg Nukklebust]] in [[Thrallmar]]. 
*[[Salvaged Wood]] (8)
*[[Salvaged Metal]] (8)

==Description==
Would you believe it? These [[orc]]s hired me to help them shore up damaged fortifications and build [[explosive]]s. What a dream job! It's too bad we're so short on materials, but a clever [[goblin]] like myself learns how to make do!

Can you help me? I need salvaged wood and metal from the ruined battlements along the [[Path of Glory]]. Go down there and salvage, and watch out for those [[Fel orc|red-skinned orcs]]!

When you're done, come back for big rewards!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Phantasmal Headdress|Battle Seeker Chestguard|Legionnaire's Studded Helm|Magistrate's Greaves}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*9,800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
So how did the salvage mission go? Did you find anything useful?

==Completion==
This stuff is great! A little bent and a little burnt, but I've never let low grade materials stop me from making precision high explosives.

Thanks, <name>. You really have an eye for quality trash!
