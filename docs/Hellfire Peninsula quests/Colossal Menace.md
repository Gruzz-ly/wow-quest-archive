==Objectives==
Slay 5 Raging Colossi and then return to [[Tola'thion]] at the [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. 
*[[Raging Colossus]] slain (5)

==Description==
You see that huge red crystal to the north? It fell from the sky not long ago, causing a massive earthquake.

When we came out here to investigate the disturbance, we found all of these [[Colossus|colossi]] wandering about that weren't previously here.

There's definitely something strange about that crystal and the energies that it's emanating, but I don't have time for that. Those mountain giants are my immediate concern.

I want you to head up to [[Fallen Sky Ridge]] with some friends and deal with them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Expedition Repeater|Survivalist's Wand}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5|80|}}
*12950 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|65|}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
You have eliminated the colossal menace?

==Completion==
Good work.

If you ask me, all that we have to do is kill enough of those colossi, and then we won't have to worry any longer about the ridge or that strange crystal in the middle of it.

Here, take one of these as a gift from the Cenarion Expedition. 

==Notes==
Although this is not part of a formal quest chain, killing a Raging Colossus (five must be killed for this quest) allows the player to loot a [[Crimson Crystal Shard]], which starts the [[Crimson Crystal Clue]] quest.
