==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Quillfang Ravager]]s and return to [[Gremni Longbeard]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].
*[[Quillfang Ravager]] slain (10)

==Description==
So [[Honor Hold]] sends us to deal with the [[arakkoa]] and we set up camp here thinking hey isn't this a great spot. Little did we know how close we were to the quillfang [[ravager]]s.

They are relentless predators and have made any sort of work on our part impossible. There's a bit of coin in it for you if you can deal with them for us. Do you feel up to it??

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Have you made any progress against the ravagers?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. That should teach those beasts who's boss!

==Notes==
*[[Quillfang Skitterer]]s also count.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
