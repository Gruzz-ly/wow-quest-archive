==Objectives==
[[Assistant Klatu|Klatu]] in [[Honor Hold]] wants you to use the Anchorite Relic at [[Gor'gaz Outpost]] southwest of [[Honor Hold]], slay [[Shattered Hand Berserker]]s near the relic, and then slay 10 released [[Fel Spirit]]s to avenge [[Colonel Jules]].
*Jules Avenged (10)
*[[Anchorite Relic (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Colonel Jules was cursed in a battle near the Gor'gaz Outpost, a haunt for [[Shattered Hand clan|Shattered Hand]] [[fel orc]]s. My master, [[Anchorite Barada|Barada]], works feverishly to cure the poor [[human]], but he needs help. The Colonel's tormented spirit seeks peace, and his path to peace is, I fear, a path of vengeance.

Take this [[anchorite]] relic to Gor'gaz Outpost. Place it upon the ground near Shattered Hand orcs and defeat them. This will release their fel spirits -- you must slay those fel spirits for Jules' own spirit's recovery.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*{{cost|2||}}
*+250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]
*9800 xp or {{cost|2|58|50}} at level 70

==Progress==
The fel spirits of the Shattered Hand orcs are a blight to poor Jules' soul.  Tell me, <name>... has he been appeased?

==Completion==
The Shattered Hand orcs are foul and beyond hope, but my heart is saddened that the road to salvation for Colonel Jules holds such bloodshed.
