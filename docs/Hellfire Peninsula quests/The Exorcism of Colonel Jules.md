==Description==
<Name>, it is time to save Colonel Jules. His condition has worsened and Barada fears that, if we do not cleanse him of his corruption, he will be lost to us.

Take the prayer beads you found and speak with Anchorite Barada to begin the ritual. Let no disruptions stop the ritual... and if all goes well, Colonel Jules will be saved. Speak with Jules when he is saved, then return to me.

==Progress==
Go to Anchorite Barada, <name>. He must succeed with his ritual if the colonel is to be saved.

==Completion==
You have done it, <name>. You have saved Colonel Jules' soul and cast the darkness within him back to where it came. A great, noble deed this is! A hero's day!

==Quotes==
Talk to Anchorite Barada:
{{Dialogue|It is with solemn pride that I perform my services in Honor Hold.

{{Gossip|I am ready, Anchorite. Let us begin the [[exorcism]].}}}}

Barada stands up:
:{{text|say|Anchorite Barada|It is time. The rite of exorcism will now commence...}}
:{{text|say|Anchorite Barada|Prepare yourself. Do not allow the ritual to be interrupted or we may lose our patient...}}
:{{Text|say|Colonel Jules|Keep away. The fool is mine.}}

Barada moves to the center of the room, kneels down and starts channeling holy magic. After 30 seconds, Jules' body rises from the bed to hover in mid-air and becomes engulfed in purple smoke as bolts of energy begin flying out of him, and [[Darkness Released]] start spawning at irregular intervals to attack both the player and Barada. About 75 seconds later, Jules starts to float around the room and repeatedly vomit, spawning [[Foul Purge]]s to attack the player and Barada as well. Target Barada with the [[Ritual Prayer Beads]] to heal him, and either kill Darkness Released and Foul Purge normally or target one of them with the Prayer Beads to deal heavy area damage to all adds present. During the ritual, Barada and Jules engage in back-and-forth dialogue using the following randomized lines:
{{Col-begin}}
{{Col|2}}
*{{Text|say|Anchorite Barada|Back, foul beings of darkness! You have no power here!}}
*{{Text|say|Anchorite Barada|Be cleansed with [[Light]], human! Let not the demonic corruption overwhelm you.}}
*{{Text|say|Anchorite Barada|I... must not...falter!}}
*{{Text|say|Anchorite Barada|In the name of the Light! It is Light that commands you! It is Light that flung you to the depths of darkness!}}
*{{Text|say|Anchorite Barada|The Light is my guide... it is my sustenance!}}
*{{Text|say|Anchorite Barada|The power of Light compels you! Back to your pit!}}
*{{Text|say|Anchorite Barada|You cannot deceive me, demon! Your strength wanes just as my faith bolsters!}}
*{{Text|say|Anchorite Barada|You... will... leave... this... man!}}
{{Col|2}}
*{{Text|say|Colonel Jules|Ah! Cease the incantations, Anchorite! Cease, or I will show you such pain that your pathetic people have never imagined!}}
*{{Text|say|Colonel Jules|All is lost, Anchorite! Abandon what hope remains.}}
*{{Text|say|Colonel Jules|Give us time... Let the man die... I am no one... I am no one... Fear the anchorite... Fear the anchorite... Barada... Barada.}}
*{{Text|say|Colonel Jules|I see your ancestors, Anchorite! They writhe and scream in the darkness... they are with us!}}
*{{Text|say|Colonel Jules|I will tear your soul into morsels and slow roast them over demon fire!}}
*{{Text|say|Colonel Jules|No! Not yet! This soul is ours!}}
*{{Text|say|Colonel Jules|This is fruitless, draenei! You and your little helper cannot wrest control of this pathetic human! He is mine!}}
*{{Text|say|Colonel Jules|You will not succeed, mortal! This shell will lie decrepit, blistered and bleeding before I am done with it. And its spirit will be long cast into darkness.}}
{{Col-end}}

If the player successfully keeps Barada alive for a total of 3 minutes and 15 seconds, Jules' body will regain its normal color and float back onto the bed, any remaining adds will despawn, and Barada will bow and walk back to the side of the bed:
:{{text|say|Anchorite Barada|Back! I cast you back... corrupter of faith! Author of pain! Do not return, or suffer the same fate as you did here today!}}

Talk to Jules to complete the objective:
{{Dialogue|Oh, thank you! The pit of blackness inside of me has been lifted! I can see again... and I see the face of my savior!}}

If Barada is killed by the adds, Jules will float back to the bed. Barada will respawn after 1 minute and can be talked to again to retry the event.
