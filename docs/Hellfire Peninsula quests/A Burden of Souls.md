==Objectives==
Kill 20 Shattered Hand [[orc]]s, then return to [[Apothecary Antonivich]] in [[Thrallmar]]. 
*[[Shattered Hand clan|Shattered Hand]] [[Soul]]s Reaped (20)

==Description==
I have a device, the [[:Demoniac Scryer]], that can analyze [[fel]] [[magic]]. I would have you use the Scryer, but first... you must appease it. The Scryer, you see, has trapped within it a creature of vast intelligence and its needs are, shall we say, quite eccentric.

To appease the Scryer, you must kill orcs. Specifically, they must be Shattered Hand orcs—the Scryer demands their souls.

Return to me when the souls are reaped. You will find the orcs north, and south, and surrounding... [[Hellfire Citadel]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
The Demonaic Scryer is not yet appeased, <name>. Return to me after you have reaped the souls of Shattered Hand orcs.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.  Your soul is burdened with many deaths... and the Demonaic Scryer will now perform its duties for you.

Let us hope you are ready for the coming trial...
