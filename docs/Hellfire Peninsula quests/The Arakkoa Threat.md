==Objectives==
[[Gremni Longbeard]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to slay 4 [[Haal'eshi Windwalker]]s and 6 [[Haal'eshi Talonguard]]s.
*[[Haal'eshi Windwalker]] slain (4)
*[[Haal'eshi Talonguard]] slain (6)

==Description==
The [[arakkoa]] are smart creatures... smart as any [[gnome]] you ever met. They have this way with [[magic]] and a violent temper, however.

Lately they've taken to attacking [[Honor Hold]] patrols, which is why we were sent here. See, [[Mirren Longbeard|Mirren]] and I are world-famous [[Marksman|marksmen]], we are! But fowl and game are what we specialize in... not these... lightning-invoking birdmen.

So what do you say you give us a hand in this one assignment? You'll find the [[Den of Haal'esh]] to the southwest.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|5|80|}}
*10400 xp or {{cost|5|58|50}} at level 70
*+250 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
You're back! How did you do?

==Completion==
Great job, <name>! I hereby proclaim you an honorary Longbeard.

Stick around and have a drink with us, won't you?
