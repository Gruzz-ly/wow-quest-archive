==Objectives==
Use [[:Bleeding Hollow Blood]] at the [[Cursed Cauldron]] to make Boiled Blood. Bring 12 Boiled Blood to [[Apothecary Albreck]] at [[Spinebreaker Post]]. 
*[[Boiled Blood]] (12)

==Description==
That last experiment was not a complete loss—I did save a small bit of the blood you brought me. Now boiled down, it should be free of whatever curses the [[Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow]] [[Witch (disambiguation)|witches]] placed on their people's blood.

I need more for study. Go gather Bleeding Hollow blood from the [[Fel orc|orcs]] in [[Zeth'Gor]]. When you've gathered the blood, bring it to their cursed cauldron and boil it. Bring me the boiled blood.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90|}}
*6600 [[XP]] (or {{cost||39|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Do you have the boiled blood, <name>?  I am eager to study it without an interruption this time...

==Completion==
Very good.  Now I can more easily perform my tests...

Thank you, <name>.  Your talents are considerable.
