==Objectives==
Bring 12 Cursed Talismans to [[Corporal Ironridge]] at [[Expedition Point]].
*[[Cursed Talisman (quest item)]] (12)

==Description==
<Name>, we cannot allow the [[Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow]] [[Fel orc|orcs]] to possess their Cursed Talismans! You must acquire them for us so they may be disposed of, and so the soldiers who owned them may be honored for their sacrifices.

Go to [[Zeth'Gor]], the cursed abode of the Bleeding Hollow, and perform your grim task... return to me when you have collected the talismans.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6200 [[XP]] ({{cost||37|50}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Do you have the talismans, <name>?  It pains me to know that those cursed orcs possess our soldiers{{sic}} insignias...

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.  My heart is saddened to see these talismans -- they underline the great losses we of Honor Hold have suffered against the fel orcs.  But I am heartened to see you successful against them.  If we can kill enough, perhaps we might emerge from this war victorious.

==Notes==
The talismans can be found on most fel orcs in and around Zeth'Gor.

==Progression==
