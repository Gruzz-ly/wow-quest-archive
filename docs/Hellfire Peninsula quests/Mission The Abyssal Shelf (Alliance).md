==Objectives==
Wing Commander Gryphongar at [[Shatter Point]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.
*[[Gan'arg Peon]] slain (20)
*[[Mo'arg Overseer]] slain (5)
*[[Fel Cannon (Hellfire Peninsula)|Fel Cannon]] Destroyed (5)
*[[Area 52 Special]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you've got your wings, perhaps you'd be interested in running another bombing mission?

This time we've isolated the Legion's main production area, behind the forge camps to the north. I need you to get on a gryphon and destroy the whole damned thing!

Here are your bombs - now, talk to [[Gryphoneer Windbellow]] when you're ready for takeoff.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Whispering Tunic|Veteran's Skullcap|Arcane Ringed Greaves|Skyfire Greaves}}

Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*1005 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Show them that not even the skies are safe!

==Completion==
You fly as if you've been doing this your entire life, <name>. Outstanding performance out there! Not even a scratch on the gryphon destroyers!

==Notes==
You do not have to complete the quest in one run. If you fail to kill enough targets first time round, you can ask [[Gryphoneer Windbellow]] for another run. You can make as many runs as are necessary to fulfill the quest targets.

Once complete, you can continue accepting this quest and bombing more demons on the Abyssal Shelf.  However, there are no further rewards for doing so, other than as a "job well done".
