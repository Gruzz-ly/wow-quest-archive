'''A Spirit Guide''' takes the adventurer to find the creators of the strange axe.

==Objectives==
Use the [[Ancestral Spirit Wolf Totem|Wolf Totem]] at the location where you found [[Fel Orc Corpse|Krun Spinebreaker's body]] and follow the [[Ancestral Spirit Wolf]].  
*[[Ancestral Spirit Wolf Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Even our best tracking [[Wolf|wolves]]' senses can fail them, <name>. The spirits have a way of seeing the world differently than ours. The being you will call forth will find the person you seek, for they'll be drawn not to their scent but their essence.

Go now, <class>, take this totem with you and use it at the location you found the stone axe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10500 XP
*+700 reputation with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
You are lucky to be alive.   

==Completion==
Who are you to walk in here unannounced?  I ordered my men to stay their hand only because [[Earthcaller Ryga|Ryga]] sensed that the spirits were with you.  

Speak freely, but choose your words wisely.  We rarely trust strangers this close to the [[Hellfire Citadel|Citadel]].

==Notes==
The wolf totem can be used near the [[Fel Orc Corpse]]{{Coords|33|43|Hellfire Peninsula}}, at the south end of the mountains north of the [[Stadium]]. The totem summons a ghostly wolf which must be followed as it walks up into the mountains, right to the inner part of [[Mag'har Post]]. The wolf will ignore all enemies and continue on its path at a steady pace, even if the adventurer is in combat. As long as the summoner stays near the wolf, they are granted the Guided by the Spirits buff, which turns the Mag'har friendly. Getting too far away for too long causes the wolf to despawn.

This quest will be marked as complete as soon as it is accepted, and the map icon will show at the final turn-in location. Nonetheless, the wolf must still be summoned and followed from the Fel Orc Corpse in order to turn in.
