==Objectives==
[[Anchorite Obadei]] wants you to look for his brother, [[Vindicator Sedai|Sedai]], nearby to the east in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. 

==Description==
Hear my plight, <class>. My brother, Sedai, left long ago to contact the [[Mag'har orc|orcs]] of [[Mag'har Post]]. Ever the idealist, he thought the time was ripe to set our differences aside and negotiate a peace with them.

He's been missing for days and I fear for the worst.

Would you set my mind to rest and look for him? Sedai must be somewhere nearby to the east.

==Rewards==
*2550 [[XP]] (or {{cost||60|}} at level 70)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Completion==
You've found the body of a young [[draenei]] [[paladin]]. He appears to have been slain by a blow to his back.

==Notes==
The corpse is located at (26.9, 37.4){{coords|26.9|37.4|Hellfire Peninsula}}
