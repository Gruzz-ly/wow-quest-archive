==Objectives==
Kill 8 Thornfang Ravagers and 8 Thornfang Venomspitters, and then return to [[Mahuram Stouthoof]] at the [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].
*[[Thornfang Ravager]] slain (8)
*[[Thornfang Venomspitter]] slain (8)

==Description==
We've been fighting an ongoing battle to keep the pass through [[Thornfang Hill]] to the west clear of [[ravager]]s. It would be bad if we were to become completely cut off from the refuge in [[Zangarmarsh]].

We don't want to displace the creatures, but there seems to be little choice as their attacks on travelers through the area have become more aggressive.

Clear some of the ravagers out of there if you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
How fares your attempt to clear Thornfang Hill?

==Completion==
With the ravagers cleared, travelers to and from the [[Cenarion Refuge]] in Zangarmarsh should have an easier time of it.

The [[Cenarion Expedition]] is indebted to you.
