==Objectives==
Take a [[gryphon]] to [[Honor Point (Hellfire Peninsula)|Honor Point]] and speak with [[Field Marshal Brock]].

==Description==
Well, <name>, I hope you're prepared for the next phase of our operation. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] never rests - and neither shall we! Take a gryphon and fly over to Honor Point - it's a small post near the [[Legion Front]].

Speak with Field Marshal Brock. He'll have instructions for you when you arrive. Oh, and tell that pasty-faced shield-kisser I said 'hello'.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 975 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Completion==
Well met, <class>. I'm glad that crusty old [[dwarf]] finally saw fit to send us some help!

==Progression==
{{Shatter Point}}
