==Objectives==
[[Amaan the Wise]] wants you to go to the [[Pools of Aggonar]] and slay 6 Terrorfiends and 6 Blistering Rots. 
*[[Blistering Rot]] slain (6)
*[[Terrorfiend]] slain (6)

==Description==
Much has changed since the days when we called this land [[Draenor]]. Parts of the land have been forever changed by the [[demon]]s' taint.

One such place is known as the Pools of Aggonar. It was once the location of our people's sacred springs. The blood of the demon [[Aggonar]] fouled the very essence of the holy waters. This [[Felblood|fel blood]] has spawned foul beings that must be cleansed if we're ever to reclaim the pools. Travel east of here and slay the [[Terrorfiend]]s and [[Ooze|slimes]] that wander the pools.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your task, <name>?

==Completion==
Yes, I feel the fel presence in the pools weakening.

You've done well, <name>.
