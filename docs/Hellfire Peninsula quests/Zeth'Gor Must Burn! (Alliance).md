==Objectives==
Use the smoke beacon at each of [[Zeth'Gor]]'s towers, and then return to [[Wing Commander Dabir'ee]] at [[Expedition Point]].
*Northern Tower Marked
*Southern Tower Marked
*Forge Tower Marked
*Foothill Tower Marked
*[[Smoke Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
It's time to strike [[Zeth'Gor]] from the air! Our [[gryphon rider]]s are ready for a sortie, <name>. But they need someone on the ground to direct their fire. Are you ready for a covert mission?

Take these smoke beacons into Zeth'Gor, the [[Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow]] stronghold to the west. They have four guard towers: one near their northern wall, one near their southern wall, one near their forge and another nestled in their foothills. Place a beacon underneath each of the towers and we'll fly in and bomb them!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Bonechewer Berserker's Vest|Gilded Crimson Chestplate|Sacred Feather Vest|Goldweave Tunic|Jerkin of the Untamed Spirit}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|80}}
*11,900 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Time is crucial, <name>. We need those guard towers burned!

==Completion==
I could see the smoke and flames from here!  Good job, <name>!  You received more than a few words of praise from our gryphon riders—what you just did took a lot of guts...

==Notes==
*Once the locations have been marked, [[Honor Hold Gryphon Brigadier]]s will arrive to finish the job.
