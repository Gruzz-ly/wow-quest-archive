==Objectives==
Seek out [[Naladu]] inside the [[Ruins of Sha'naar]].

==Description==
Perhaps not all hope is lost for the [[Dreghood tribe|Dreghood]]. I am one of four elders that guided this tribe before we were enslaved by the [[Illidari]]. I thought the others were dead, but I've slowly learned that at least two others are alive - chained down and powerless just as I am.

I've not yet been able to find [[Naladu]] and fear for the worst. There are more huts in the ruins upstairs; perhaps you could look for him. It would be a great boon for our tribe if all our elders were alive. 

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2550 [[XP]] (or {{cost||60|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
You've come to help my tribe, <race>?  How unusual.  There aren't many that care about the fate of the [[Broken]] in this land.

==Progression==
{{Ruins of Sha'naar}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
