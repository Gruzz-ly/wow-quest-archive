==Objectives==
Bring 12 Plump Buzzard Wings to [[Legassi]] at the [[Zeppelin Crash]]. 
*[[Plump Buzzard Wing]] (12)

==Description==
[["Screaming" Screed Luckheed|Screed]] likes to say his flying is as "smooth as butter." I think "butterfingered" is more like it!

Take a look at the wreckage over there. He calls it a "rough" landing.

Sure, we got shot at, but I'd be willing to cut him a little more slack if he didn't brag about his piloting skills so often!

I think I'm going to make him a batch of wings to drive the point home. To the east, in the [[Valley of Bones]], you'll find bonestripper buzzards. Their wings are plump, juicy, and perfect for my needs. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive|q=5|Buzzard Bites|Recipe: Buzzard Bites}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
I can't wait to see the look on his face when he digs in. Ever since the crash, he's been complaining that all I can think of is food. Well, someone's got to feed us while he tinkers with the zeppelin!

==Completion==
[[Ravager]] Eggs. Bam!

[[Hellboar]] Bacon. Bam!

[[Buzzard]] Wings. Bam! Bam!

What a great meal. You've really got to try it.
