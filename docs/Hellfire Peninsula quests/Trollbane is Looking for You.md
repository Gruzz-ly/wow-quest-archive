==Objectives==
[[Assistant Klatu]] has informed you that [[Force Commander Danath Trollbane]] has been seeking you. Speak to him in the [[barracks]] at [[Honor Hold]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Description==
While we were busy, a messenger was waiting out in the hall. I suppose he grew tired, or perhaps he simply ran away at the site of [[Colonel Jules|Jules]] floating around the room.

Either way, Force Commander Danath is looking for you. I suggest that you seek an audience with him inside the barracks as quickly as possible!

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
975 xp or {{cost||58|50}} at level 70.

==Completion==
It's about time! I heard all about what you've been up to with that [[draenei]] [[priest]]. You totally freaked my messenger out!

Now that you're done with that, I have a little mission planned for you to [[Hellfire Citadel]].
