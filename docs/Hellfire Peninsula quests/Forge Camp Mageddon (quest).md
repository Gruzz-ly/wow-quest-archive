This quest is part of the '''Return to Thrallmar''' quest chain. This quest chain starts with [[Return to Thrallmar]].

==Objectives==
[[Nazgrel]] in [[Thrallmar]] wants you to attack [[Forge Camp: Mageddon]] and kill 10 Gan'arg Servants and return with the head of Razorsaw.
*[[Gan'arg Servant]] slain (10)
*[[Head of Forgefiend Razorsaw]]

==Description==
<Name>, we have reason to believe that the easternmost forge camp is not yet complete. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s [[gan'arg]] servants are working 'round the clock to get the facility up and running. We can't allow that to happen.

Head east to Forge Camp: Mageddon and slay 10 gan'arg. Bring me the head of their master - Razorsaw - and the Legion's [[fel reaver]] production will grind to a halt!

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Move quickly, <class>, we've got to shut down Forge Camp: Mageddon before the [[demon]]s finish its construction!

==Completion==
Well done, <class>, That's one less forge camp we'll need to worry about. It'll take the Legion a while to get that facility back up and running. You've just bought us the one thing we'd run out of - time.
