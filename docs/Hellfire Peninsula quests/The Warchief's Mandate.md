'''The Warchief's Mandate''' sends the player to ask for help in determining the origins of the strange axe.

==Objectives==
Bring the [[:Heavy Stone Axe]] to [[Far Seer Regulkut]] at [[Thrallmar]] at [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. 
*[[Heavy Stone Axe]] (provided)

==Description==
As you know, [[Thrall|the warchief]] put his power behind this expedition for one reason. This is the world we came from. This is where our roots lie.

This journey means different things to [[orc]]s and [[Blood elf|blood elves]]. To them it's a search for the promised land. To us it's more like returning home.

Whoever made this axe is familiar with the old ways and we must contact them. This is too important for us to use ordinary tracking methods. Show the weapon to Far Seer Regulkut; she will know what to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 5000 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Tell me what you seek, so that I may help you find it.

==Completion==
I understand [[Nazgrel]]'s request, <class>.  Say no more.

==Progression==
{{The Assassin}}

==Patch changes==
