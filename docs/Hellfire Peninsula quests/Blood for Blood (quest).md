'''Blood for Blood''' is one of the two [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] [[daily quest]]s located at the [[Throne of Kil'jaeden]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. Players must have completed the quest [[The Missing Magistrix]] before Seyla offers this quest.

==Objectives==
[[Magistrix Seyla]] at the [[Throne of Kil'jaeden]] wants you to kill 4 [[Emaciated Felblood]]s by using the Fel Siphon on them. You will need [[Demonic Blood]] from nearby [[Wrath Herald]]s to power the Fel Siphon.
*[[Emaciated Felblood]] slain (4)
*[[Fel Siphon]] (provided)

==Description==
When [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael]]'s forces retreated through that portal, his most loyal lackeys were rewarded with an abominable gift. They stayed behind and gorged themselves on the blood of demons for days.

The blood has changed them, given them new powers. It will also prove their undoing.

Obtain blood samples from other demons. Use them to power this fel siphon and deprive these arrogant fools of their new powers. Slay them in their weakened state and return to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|q1=5|Mark of Sargeras
|q2=5|Sunfury Signet}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|15}}
* 12,650 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Shattered Sun Offensive]]

==Progress==
These freaks are a disgrace to our race. You must destroy them, <name>.

==Completion==
Fools. They learned to drain [[fel]] energy but did not learn how to retain it.

We were lucky, <name>. An experienced [[felblood elf|felblood]] would've surely been a formidable opponent.

==Notes==
[[File:Fel Siphon.jpg|thumb|Use the Fel Siphon on the Fel Initiates. You can spot them channeling the Suspended Terrorguards.]]
[[Emaciated Felblood]]s will only appear when you use the provided [[Fel Siphon]] with the dropped [[Demonic Blood]] on [[Felblood Initiate]]s in the area. They are elite, so expect to get hit hard if you cannot use the [[Fel Siphon]] in time. The [[Fel Siphon]] will, however, slow them during channeling. When the channeling is complete, the Initiate will do an emote before switching to a wretched non-elite [[Emaciated Felblood]]. It is a good idea to keep 3 or 4 Demonic Blood in your inventory while in this area because if you aggro another Felblood Initiate it is safer to convert them to a non-elite and kill them than to deal with them at full strength. However, they are soloable even in their elite state.
