==Objectives==
[[Danath Trollbane|Force Commander Danath Trollbane]] has ordered you to kill Drillmaster Zurok with all due haste. Return to the force commander at [[Honor Hold]] in the [[Hellfire Peninsula]] once the drillmaster is dead.
*[[Drillmaster Zurok]] slain
*Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
I'm receiving reports that the [[Shattered Hand clan|Shattered Hand]] [[fel orc]]s, out in front of [[Hellfire Citadel]], are organizing for what looks like an all-out assault. No doubt, they're not happy about your successes against all of the [[clan]]s.

Get to the base of the citadel, where the [[Path of Glory]] ends. You'll find the fel orcs busy with their preparations, but you're going to catch them with their pants down.

Eliminate the one that's in charge of that force. Kill Drillmaster Zurok!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Shadowcast Tunic|Darkstorm Tunic|Stormstrike Vest|Battlemaster's Breastplate}} 

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5|40|}}
*12600 xp or {{cost|5|58|50}} at level 70
*+1,000 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]

==Progress==
Is the drillmaster dead? Hmm, maybe my [[scout]]s are wrong?

==Completion==
I wasn't going to believe it until I heard it from you, personally. Already our scouts are trickling in with information that the Shattered Hand are in disarray without their precious drillmaster to tell them what to do.

You've traveled a long road, I trust that you will accept this armor along with my thanks. Wear it proudly, you've earned it!
