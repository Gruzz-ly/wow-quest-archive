Use To'arch's Primer within Portal Xilus and Portal Kruul.

Return to [[Forward Commander To'arch|To'arch]] with To'arch's Primers at [[Reaver's Fall]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Description==
Directly east of here is the [[Legion Front]]. Spaced across the front are infernal portals and gateways, used to bring reinforcements to Hellfire Peninsula and throughout [[Outland]]. We're going to destroy those portals!

Take these primers. Designed in [[Area 52]], they use the [[demon]]s' own power as an explosive! Defeat [[Burning Legion|Legion]] forces around Portals Xilus and Kruul to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate the stones inside the portals, and watch! Return to me when your mission is complete.

==Progress==
The Legion won't be prepared for the surprise you have for them, eh <name>?

==Completion==
Well done!  I could almost feel the tremors of the explosions from here!

Now, we have one more bombing mission for you...
