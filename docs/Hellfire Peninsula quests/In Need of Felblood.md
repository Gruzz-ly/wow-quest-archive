==Objectives==
[[Ryathen the Somber]] at [[Falcon Watch]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to bring him 6 Felblood Samples from the [[Terrorfiend]]s that inhabit the [[Pools of Aggonar]]. 
*[[Felblood Sample]] (6)

==Description==
Northeast of here lie the Pools of Aggonar. Once a sacred site to the draenei, their waters were corrupted after the blood from the [[demon]] [[Aggonar]] was spilled into them.

That blood, though old and diluted, still possesses tremendous power. Terrorfiends now walk the area, empowered by the pure demonic energies of the original blood. Slay them and retrieve as much [[felblood]] as you can. I'll make it worth your while.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
The felblood... did you obtain it, <name>? 

==Completion==
The energy contained in these samples is tremendous, <name>.  Now we just need to ensure that our access to this felblood continues uninterrupted.
