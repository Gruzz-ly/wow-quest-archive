==Objectives==
[[Amaan the Wise]] at the [[Temple of Telhamat]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to return to [[Sedai's Corpse]], northeast of the Temple of Telhamat, and use the [[Seer's Relic]] at that location. Return to him after you've completed this task.
*Vision Granted
*[[Seer's Relic]] (provided)

==Description==
The stubborn close their mind and convince themselves of one truth. The wise keep an open mind to the different possibilities leading to and stemming from the present.

Take this relic with you to where you found Sedai. See not with your eyes, <name>, but with your mind.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Vindicator's Chain Helm|Leggings of Telhamat|Omenai Vest}}

You will also gain:
*12950 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|65|}} at level 70)
*350 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Have you seen the vision yet, <name>?

==Completion==
I hope the vision you witnessed helped you gain some perspective on Sedai's death.  The relic showed you a likely series of events leading up to the present.  The truth may have been different, we'll never know for sure.

Would you act differently knowing what you know now?

Who can say whether our conflict with the orcs will continue?  What's important is to remain open to the possibilities.

==Notes==
This quest is still frequently broken as of Dec 2008. What's supposed to happen is that, just north of the corpse, you are supposed to see action enacted by several "ghost" NPCs, one of which is Sedai, showing how he was actually killed. But Sedai has a tendency to get stuck. If you see his "ghost" standing around idly by his corpse when no one's doing the quest, the sequence is probably broken. Don't worry, though, you can still use the item near the corpse, and although nothing will appear to happen, you'll get the "Vision Granted" completion a few seconds later.
