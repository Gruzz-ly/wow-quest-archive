This quest is part of the '''Through the Dark Portal (Horde)''' quest chain. 

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sergeant Shatterskull]] at the [[Supply Caravan]] just outside of [[Thrallmar]], to the east.

==Description==
Though this land is full of strange new enemies, the [[Burning Legion]] is still the greatest threat to our Expedition. One of my most trusted [[warrior]]s, Sergeant Shatterskull, has been studying the Legion's tactics - trying to discern the [[demon]]s' true purpose in this land. Seek him out at the supply caravan just outside the southern wall.

And <name> - be wary of the Legion. Their evil cannot be underestimated.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||11|40}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Completion==
No doubt you saw the Legion's warriors dotting the landscape on your flight from the [[Dark Portal]]. Though we defeated them at the [[Battle of Mount Hyjal]] some five years past, the cursed demons just keep coming back for more. If it's a challenge they crave, then the Horde will answer in kind!

We [[orc]]s have more than just a score to settle with the Legion. What about you, <name>? Shall I tell you of our enemy?
