==Objectives==
Gather 8 Bonestripper Tail Feathers from [[Bonestripper Vulture]]s and bring them to [[Falconer Drenna Riverwind]] at [[Falcon Watch]]. 
*[[Bonestripper Tail Feather]] (8)

==Description==
With the influx of pilgrims and the encroachment of [[Alliance]] forces, things around Falcon Watch have gotten quite busy lately. In my spare time, I usually help prepare batches of arrows for the [[Elven ranger|rangers]], but I haven't had the chance to gather feathers for the fletching in a long time.

I could offer you a bit of coin if you'd be willing to gather the tail feathers of the bonestripper vultures. In the past, I've found them circling the bones of large beasts to the north of Falcon Watch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Were you able to get all the feathers? 

==Completion==
These should do the job. I was concerned that the rangers might be short on arrows for a while, but that's one less thing I have to worry about. Thank you for your help, <class>.
