This quest is part of the '''Through the Dark Portal (Horde)''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Forward Commander To'arch]] at [[Reaver's Fall]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.
*[[Gan'arg Peon]] slain (20)
*[[Mo'arg Overseer]] slain (5)
*[[Fel Cannon (Hellfire Peninsula)|Fel Cannon]] Destroyed (5)
*[[Area 52 Special]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you've got your wings, perhaps you'd be interested in running another bombing mission?

This time we've isolated the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s main production area, behind the [[forge camp]]s to the north. I need you to get on a [[wyvern]] and destroy the whole damned thing!

Here are your bombs - now, talk to [[Wing Commander Brack]] when you're ready for takeoff.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Whispering Tunic|Veteran's Skullcap|Arcane Ringed Greaves|Skyfire Greaves}}

You will gain:
*1005 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Show them that not even the skies are safe!

==Completion==
You fly as if you've been doing this your entire life, <name>. Outstanding performance out there! Not even a scratch on the wyvern destroyers!

==Notes==
*You do not have to complete the quest in one run. If you fail to kill enough targets first time round, you can ask [[Wing Commander Brack]] for another run. You can make as many runs as are necessary to fulfill the quest targets.
