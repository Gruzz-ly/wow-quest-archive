This quest is reported to not strictly be a prerequisite for Fel Orc Scavengers, but it does introduce the character to the new NPC.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lieutenant Amadi]] at the old guard tower just west of [[Honor Hold]].

==Description==
Rumors have surfaced that some [[Fel orc|new breed of orc]] is on the rise. Larger, meaner - more cunning than the brutes we're familiar with. If these rumors are true then our forces, already stretched, may be taxed beyond their limit.

I have entrusted my lieutenant, Amadi, with investigating this matter. If you would help us in this dark hour, seek her out. She is stationed at the broken tower just west of the Hold.

And <name> - be careful out there. You're heading into a dangerous new world.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*480 - 2400 [[XP]]
*{{cost||28|80}}

==Completion==
<Lieutenant Amadi nods.> 

Good, we need all the help we can get. The increasing fel orc presence around the Southern Rampart concerns me. I sent out [[Private Imarion|a scout]] to investigate, but he hasn't returned yet.
