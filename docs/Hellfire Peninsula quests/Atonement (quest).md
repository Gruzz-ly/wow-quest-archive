==Objectives==
Speak to [[Amaan the Wise]] at the [[Temple of Telhamat]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Description==
Our history with the orcs is one of constant conflict, <name>. We were once near driven to extinction due to their bloodlust and have since then avoided them even when not under [[demon]]ic influence.

Yet, this retaliation... it's not what [[Vindicator Sedai|Sedai]] would've wanted. Speak with our elder, [[Amaan the Wise]]. He will help shed light on these events.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*1050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||37|50}} at level 70)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Completion==
Can I offer you any assistance, <name>?  You sound troubled.

==Progression==
