==Objectives==
[[Legassi]] at the [[Zeppelin Crash]] wants you to gather 8 Purified Helboar Meat. To purify the meat, use the Purification Mixture on the [[:Tainted Helboar Meat]] you gather from Helboars. 
*[[Purified Helboar Meat]] (8)
*[[Purification Mixture]] (provided)

==Description==
Those eggs are superb, but what do you say we kick it up another notch?

A side of bacon would round out the meal perfectly and I know just where to get it.

This place is littered with [[helboar]]s. Of course, there's no one here to inspect and tenderize the meat, but we're in luck!

<Legassi rummages around in his pack and produces a flask.>

This wasn't made for use on pork, but cooking is as much about improvisation as anything else!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|2||}}
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*5x [[Helboar Bacon]]

==Progress==
Were you successful in purifying the helboar meat?

==Completion==
Hmm...

This looks edible, if spiced properly. Just don't tell Screed where his breakfast came from, ok?

==Notes==
The quest objective system on the [[Map|in-game map]] implies [[Tainted Helboar Meat]] must be obtained from the [[Starving Helboar]]s near the quest-givers, but in fact it can drop from essentially any [[helboar]] in the zone:
*[[Deranged Helboar]]
*[[Hulking Helboar]]
*[[Starving Helboar]]

Note that Deranged and Hulking Helboars are also required for [[Shizz Work]] and [[Demonic Contamination]], respectively, so this quest could be completed while working on those. On the other hand the required quantity is relatively low, so it may be easier to complete this quest locally before venturing elsewhere.

==Progression==
#[[Ravager Egg Roundup]]
#[[Helboar, the Other White Meat]]
#[[Smooth as Butter]]

==Trivia==
The name of this quest is a reference to an advertising campaign launched by the American meat industry proclaiming pork "The Other White Meat" to combat the widespread perception of it as an unhealthy food.
