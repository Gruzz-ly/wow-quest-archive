==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sergeant Altumus]] at the [[East Supply Caravan]] just outside of [[Honor Hold]], to the east.

==Description==
While the [[Burning Legion]] invaded [[Azeroth]], they were also at work here, in [[Outland]]. We have tracked their movements over the years, but this latest activity, <class> - well, this is beyond anything we've seen.

Seek out [[Sergeant Altumus]] near the eastern supply caravan. She has been monitoring the invaders and may have insights into their purpose.

Be swift - and take care, <name> - the Burning Legion is not to be underestimated.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||11|40}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Honor Hold]]

==Completion==
[[Force Commander Danath]] may have misunderstood my request for reinforcements. You look capable, but... I asked for a full sized battalion!

You see, we have a bit of a demon problem...
