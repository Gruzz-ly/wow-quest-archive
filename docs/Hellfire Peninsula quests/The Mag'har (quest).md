'''The Mag'har''' quest brings news of the untainted Outland orc back to the Azerothian orcs.

==Objectives==
Deliver the Letter from the Mag'har to [[Nazgrel]] at [[Thrallmar]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].
*[[Letter from the Mag'har]] (provided)

==Description==
This news you bring from beyond the [[Dark Portal]]... you want us to believe the [[Thrall|son]] of [[Durotan]] now rules over the lands beyond it... free from any [[demon]]ic taint? And that now his people have returned to [[Outland|this world]]?

I hope for your sake that this isn't some manner of joke, <class>. What this means to my people... cannot be described. I must send word to [[Nagrand]] at once! [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]] must hear about this.

Take this letter back to your leader in Thrallmar. Tell him the [[Mag'har]] welcome them!

==Rewards==

*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
What do you bring us, <name>?    

==Completion==
You're certain of this? This is big news, <name>. These orcs can surely help our cause both here and at home! 

{{Rfg-section|4.0.1}}
You're certain of this?  True orcs... here in Hellfire!  This is big news, <name>.

We must inform the warchief at once.
