'''Arelion's Mistress''' is the final quest in the Arelion's Journal quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Magistrix Carinda]] at [[Falcon Watch]] wants you to lure [[Viera Sunwhisper]] away from the settlement and then use [[Carinda's Scroll of Retribution]] on her. 
*Carinda's Scroll of Retribution used
*[[Carinda's Scroll of Retribution]] (provided)

==Description==
With all the important matters at hand [[Slime-Covered Corpse|Arelion]] still found time in his schedule to see a mistress!

It's all becoming perfectly clear. Viera Sunwhisper, that filthy wench... we'll show her to never cross a magistrix again.

Take this scroll and find Viera. Find a way to lure her away from town and use the scroll on her.

Arelion mentioned she couldn't resist a particular wine harvested by the [[Cenarion Expedition|cenarion]] [[druid]]s. You might find some at [[Cenarion Refuge]], just inside [[Zangarmarsh]], west of here.

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|40|}}
*12600 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|3|}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]
*[[Carinda's Wedding Band]]

==Progress==
Well, <name>. Is it done?

==Completion==
Excellent!  That little backstabber won't be running off with anyone's husband any time soon.

Here's a little something for your troubles. I trust we can keep this incident between us, <name>.

==Notes==
After getting the quest, head to [[Cenarion Refuge]] and purchase a bottle of Viera's favorite wine, [[Cenarion Spirits]], from [[Innkeeper Coryth Stoktron]]. Return to [[Falcon Watch]] and give the bottle to Viera (via the repeatable side quest [[Life's Finer Pleasures]]).

As soon as the side quest is completed, she starts walking out of the town.
:{{Text|say|Viera Sunwhisper|Ok, let's go.  I know just the perfect spot!}}
:''[[Twinkle]] starts following Viera.''

;After leading her out of the gates
:{{Text|say|Viera Sunwhisper|I can't wait to try this wine!}}

Use the scroll on her, giving her the following buff: {{Abilities|Carinda's Retribution|id=30077|Unleashes spell prepared by Magistrix Carinda for Viera Sunwhisper.  Cannot possibly be pretty.|icon=spell_brokenheart}}

:{{Text|say|Viera Sunwhisper|What... is happening... to me?  Get this cat away from me!}}
:{{Text|emote|Twinkle looks at Viera Sunwhisper with very hungry eyes.}}
:{{Text|emote|Viera Sunwhisper scurries away, attempting to flee from Twinkle.}}
:''Viera run away, while being chased by Twinkle.''
