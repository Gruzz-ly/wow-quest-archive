==Objectives==
Capture the [[Overlook]], the [[Stadium]] and [[Broken Hill]], then return to [[Battlecryer Blackeye]] in [[Thrallmar]].
* Capture The Overlook
* Capture the Stadium
* Capture Broken Hill

==Description==
The [[fel orc]]s of [[Hellfire Citadel]] must be scoured from our birthland! To attack them, we must first secure forward staging points near the Citadel.

Our [[outrunner]]s found three fortifications that will suit this purpose, but the [[Alliance]] has the same idea and even now sends forces to take them!

We want you to stop the Alliance and capture these forts. Aid in the capture of each fort and then return to me.

For the Horde! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost||70}}
|Insignia of the Horde
|q2=3|Mark of Thrallmar}}

* 4,300 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Return to me after you have helped capture each fort!

==Completion==
Nice work, <name>. I could almost hear the battles waged at those forts. I wish I was there to see them!

==Notes==
You must complete the quest [[Forward Base: Reaver's Fall]] in order to accept this quest.
