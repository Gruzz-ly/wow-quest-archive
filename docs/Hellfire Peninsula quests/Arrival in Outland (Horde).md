This quest is part of the '''Through the Dark Portal (Horde)''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[Through the Dark Portal (Horde)]].

==Objectives==
[[Lieutenant General Orion]] at the [[Dark Portal]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to bring Orion's Report to [[Vlagga Freyfeather]].
*[[Orion's Report]] (provided)

==Description==
Aided by the [[Alliance]], my forces will hold the line here, but I need you to deliver my report to [[General Krakork]] in [[Thrallmar]]. With his help, we'll be able to drive these [[demon]]s back into the abyss that spawned them! Speak to Vlagga Freyfeather who stands on the platform behind us. She'll speed you on your way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||28|80}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
I saw you speaking with Orion - it must be important business...

==Completion==
So you're Orion's new messenger? I pray you fare better than the last one he sent, <class>. With the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] pressing in, you'd never make it to Thrallmar on foot. Say the word, and my faithful [[wyvern]] will deliver you there safely.
