==Warchief's Command==
;Hellfire Peninsula

Stop the demon filth from taking control of the Dark Portal and cutting off supplies to our forces in Hellfire Peninsula.

==Objectives==
Report to [[Lieutenant General Orion]] at the [[Stair of Destiny]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

The [[Thrallmar Mage]] in the [[Orgrimmar Portal Room]] can help you get there. 

==Description==
All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Lieutenant General Orion at the Stair of Destiny.

Your skills are needed to fight the Burning Legion's presence on the shattered remnants of Outland.

Go to the portal room in [[Gates of Orgrimmar|Orgrimmar's front gate]] and talk to the Thrallmar Mage to travel to the Blasted Lands, then walk through the Dark Portal to arrive at the Stair of Destiny.

Destiny calls!

==Rewards==
You will receive:

==Notes==
