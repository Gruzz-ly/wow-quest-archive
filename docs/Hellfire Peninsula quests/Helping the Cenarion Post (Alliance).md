==Objectives==
[[Amaan the Wise]] would like for you to offer your services to [[Thiah Redmane]] at the [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Description==
The [[Cenarion Circle]] has sent an expedition to [[Outland]] and, as I understand it, they are here to study what has happened and to help reverse any damage that they can.

They've setup a little post just to the west on the south side of the road leading to [[Zangarmarsh]].

If you hit [[Thornfang Hill]], you've gone too far.

Would you please go and see how you might help them? Speak with Thiah Redmane as she is the one that sent the request to us for assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*975 XP
*+10 reputation with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Completion==
Oh, goodness, you must be the help that I requested from the [[Temple of Telhamat]].

I'm glad that you're here; there's a lot to be done, and I have just the thing to start you out.
