==Objectives==
Report to [[Commander Hogarth]] in the [[Expedition Armory]]. 

==Description==
Hogarth, the commander of the Armory, is in the eastern tower. You must report your victory over [[Urtrak]] to him. Perhaps he will be friendly? Of course he may try to consume your soul. One can never tell with spirits such as these.

The [[Unyielding]] are still against us and will no doubt kill you if they can. Be careful <name>. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Blade of the Unyielding|Rod of the Unyielding}}

You will also receive:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Completion==
We lost our battle against the [[fel orc]]s so very long ago. You have restored some of our lost honor by killing Urtrak.

Take one of our weapons with you.  When you are fighting our most hated foes, use this weapon, and those who are free of our curse will come to your aid.

Before you leave, those who died at the [[siege tower]] wish to honor you for destroying our enemies.

==Notes==
On completion, several [[Vengeful Unyielding]] and [[Vengeful Unyielding Knight]]s briefly appear to bow.

The Blade of the Unyielding and Rod of the Unyielding will always summon soldiers to fight alongside you when you battle [[Grillok "Darkeye"]].
