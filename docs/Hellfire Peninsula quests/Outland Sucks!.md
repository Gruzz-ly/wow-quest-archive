:''"How am I supposed to make a living here with helboars and demons and fel orcs attacking all the time?" —[[Foreman Razelcraz]]''

==Objectives==
Find 6 [[Shredder Parts]] and return to [[Foreman Razelcraz]] by the mine northwest of [[Thrallmar]]. 
*[[Shredder Spare Parts]] (6)

==Description==
I can't believe I left [[Booty Bay]] to come to [[Outland]]. My cousin [["Screaming" Screed Luckheed|Screed Luckheed]] promised me I would make a fortune, but instead he flew off in his [[zeppelin]] and left me here to try to scrape a living out of this mine.

How am I supposed to make a living here with [[helboar]]s and [[demon]]s and [[fel orc]]s attacking all the time? My [[shredder]] here was broken yesterday and the parts I need to fix it were stolen by fel orcs. They took the parts into the fissure to the southwest and may have dropped them there. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|2}}
|q=5|Fel Iron Ore}}

==Progress==
Did you find some spare parts for my shredder?  I really want to get it fixed so I can get back to mining.  I have to make a living somehow, if only so I can buy a one-way ticket back to Booty Bay.

==Completion==
Hurray, you found some parts!  Now maybe I can get my shredder working.  If I earn enough money I might be able to get back to Booty Bay.

I sure hope my cousin, Screed Luckheed, crashes that stupid zeppelin of his.  I can't believe he tricked me into coming to Outland.
