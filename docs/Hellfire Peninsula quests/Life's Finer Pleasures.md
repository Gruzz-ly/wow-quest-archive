'''Life's Finer Pleasures''' is used to lure Viera away for the quest [[Arelion's Mistress]].

==Objectives==
Just because we're on this pilgrimage doesn't mean we have to give up all of life's pleasures.  It's been ages since I had a good wine.

I'd literally kill for a bottle of cenarion spirits!

I know, I know, how unfashionable of me to enjoy a drink brewed by [[Night elf|night elves]].
*[[Cenarion Spirits]]

==Completion==
You know, maybe we can become friends after all.  Follow me; we don't want to have to share this with the others now, do we?
