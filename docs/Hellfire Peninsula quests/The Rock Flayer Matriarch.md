==Objectives==
Obtain Blacktalon's Claws from [[Blacktalon the Savage]] at the [[Great Fissure]] and bring it to [[Ikan]] at the [[Temple of Telhamat]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].
*[[Blacktalon's Claws]]

==Description==
[[Rock flayer]]s are mean, nasty, violent creatures. But the plain ones are like tame beasts when compared to their matriarch, Blacktalon the Savage.

My cousin got eaten by her and it wasn't pretty. I swore that one day Blacktalon would pay for that. You bring back proof of that monster's death and I will give you my life's savings. Deal?

You're going to need some friends to kill Blacktalon. Big tough friends with sharp swords. You'll find her inside a cave in the Great Fissure. Good luck!
