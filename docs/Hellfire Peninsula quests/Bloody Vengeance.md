==Objectives==
Blow the Unyielding Battle Horn near the [[Unyielding Banner|Alliance Banner]]. Kill [[Urtrak]] and then return to [[Althen the Historian]] at [[Spinebreaker Post]]. 
*[[Urtrak]] slain
*[[Unyielding Battle Horn (usable)]] (provided)

==Description==
East of here is an old destroyed [[Alliance of Lordaeron|Alliance]] [[siege tower]]. Now scavengers loot it for old nails and bits of scrap. Long ago, many Alliance [[warrior]]s lost their lives at this tower and their [[banner]] was captured by Urtrak, a foul [[orc]] [[Commander (rank)|commander]].

Blow the Unyielding battle horn near the [[Alliance]] banner. This will get the attention of Urtrak. It may also summon forth warriors who fell in battle long ago.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Have you blown the horn by the siege tower yet?  We must do this soon.  Who knows when [[Thrallmar]] will have need of the [[Unyielding]].

==Completion==
I am glad to hear that the Unyielding joined you in your battle.  I thought they might come to the sound of their own battle horn, but I could not be sure.  Perhaps we have given some of them the vengeance they so desperately crave.

You have slain Urtrak and we must report your victory to [[Commander Hogarth]] in the [[Expedition Armory]].  He will understand the risks you have taken on his behalf.

==Notes==
Use the quest item near the Unyielding Banner at the Ruined Alliance Siege Tower to summon Urtrak, a [[Vengeful Unyielding Captain]], and [[Vengeful Unyielding Footman|Vengeful Unyielding Footmen]].
