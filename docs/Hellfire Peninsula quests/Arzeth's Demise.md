==Objectives==
Use the Staff of Dreghood Elders on Arzeth the Merciless and slay him after he's lost his powers. Return to [[Naladu]] at the [[Ruins of Sha'naar]] after completing this task.
*[[Arzeth the Powerless]] slain
*[[Staff of the Dreghood Elders]] (provided)

==Description==
Yes, the [[elemental spirit]]s have returned to us! We are not as strong as we once were, but a little [[magic]] can go a long way in the right hands.

[[Arzeth the Merciless|Arzeth]] has great powers bestowed upon him by his dark lord. Take this staff. It was once a great symbol of [[Dreghood tribe|our tribe]]. Use it against Arzeth and his powers will be temporarily removed from him. Defeat him then, so that my people may finally be free!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|40|}}
*12600 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|3|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>? Is Arzeth dead? 

==Completion==
It is true, <name>.  I was once [[Naladu]] the Keeper of Earth.

It was I who betrayed the other Dreghood elders in exchange for empty promises of power.  You can despise me now if you wish to. What matters is that my tribe is free once again and that the spirits have returned to us.

I will not be joining the rest of the tribe, but I can die in peace now. May the spirit of earth find a new servant among my brothers.

==Notes==
*Casting the staff on Arzeth applies the Fury of the Dreghood Elders buff.
