==Objectives==
Take Avruu's Orb to the [[Haal'eshi Altar]] southeast of the [[Den of Haal'esh]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] and give it to [[Aeranas]] once he's free.
*[[Avruu's Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
<As you hold the orb closer to you, you hear a voice address you.>

I sense you're not of the [[arakkoa]], so I will attempt to barter for my freedom. My name is Aeranas. I once ruled over the eastern winds. The [[Haal'eshi]] [[mage]], [[Avruu]], trapped me inside this orb.

Find the altar the arakkoa used to enslave me. It is hidden to the southeast of the arakkoa's den. Approach it with the orb and give it to me once I'm free. In exchange for my liberty I'll reward you with powerful treasure!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Wind Dancer's Pendant|Signet of Aeranas|Windtalker's Cloak}}

You will also receive:
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
The freedom I've yearned for is finally mine!

==Completion==
With this orb I regain my liberty.  Take your reward, mortal, so that our debt may be settled.

==Notes==
In the southern part of [[Haal'eshi Gorge]] find a hut. In front of it is a [[Haal'eshi Altar]]. Click on it to summon the elemental.

:{{text|say|Avruu's magic... it still controls me. You must fight me, mortal. It's the only way to break the spell!}}

Defeat it to make it friendly.

:{{text|say|Avruu's magic is broken! I'm free once again!}}
