*[[Warbringer Arix'Amal]] slain
*Close Burning Legion Gate
*[[Burning Legion Gate Key]]

==Description==
You are an honor to us, <name>. But now we must strike before the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] recovers! To the north of Thrallmar lies [[Invasion Point: Annihilator]]. It houses a warp-portal through which the Legion draws its reinforcements.

You must overload that portal - and blast it back to the abyss it came from. The portal's activation key will be held by the Point's commander - Warbringer Arix'Amal. Slay him. Take the key. Use it on the portal and do what must be done. May the [[Thrall|warchief]]'s blessings be with you.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*9800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|17|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Hurry, <name>. Every second that warp-portal stands open, another foul [[demon]] is brought into [[Outland|this world]]!

==Completion==
Praise the ancients, you've done it, <name>! The Legion has suffered a terrible defeat - and Thrallmar is safe once again. Ah, if I had but a hundred [[warrior]]s with your heart and cunning, this broken land would be tamed already! I salute you.
