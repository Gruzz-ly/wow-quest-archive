This quest is part of the Boiling Blood quest chain. This quest chain starts with [[Boiling Blood]].

==Objectives==
Kill [[Force-Commander Gorax]], place the Challenge From the Horde upon his corpse, kill The [[Hand of Kargath]], and then bring the Head of the Hand of Kargath to [[Nazgrel]] in [[Thrallmar]].
*[[The Head of the Hand of Kargath]]
*[[Challenge From the Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
Force Commander Gorax is training [[Shattered Hand clan|Shattered Hand]] [[Captain (rank)|captains]] at the base of [[Hellfire Citadel]], honing them to a bloody razor's edge. You must kill him, <name>, for his loss would be a mighty blow to the [[fel orc]]s.

However, that is not all you must do.

Take this [[banner]]. Place it atop Gorax's [[corpse]]. Gorax's commander, the Hand of Kargath, must answer your challenge if he has even a drop of true [[orc]] blood within him!

His head, the head of the hand of Kargath, is what I seek.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Stormstrike Vest|Shadowcast Tunic|Darkstorm Tunic|Battlemaster's Breastplate}}

You will also receive:
*12950 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|65|}} at level 70)
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
Have you faced the Hand of Kargath, <name>?

==Completion==
You have done a great deed, <name>.  The fel orcs are a shame to all true orcs.  If we have one fear, it is the fear of succumbing to [[demon]]ic corruption once again. So you see, our war against the fel orcs is more than merely a battle with fierce foes -- it is also a battle within ourselves.

And with strength, strength you have shown time again, it is a battle we will win.

==Notes==
