'''The Assassin''' is a quest which sends the adventurer to ambush an assassin. It begins a quest chain through which [[Horde]] players become neutral with the [[Mag'har (faction)|Mag'har]].

==Objectives==
[[Nazgrel]] wants you to travel to the road north of [[Hellfire Citadel]] and look for an [[assassin]] named [[Krun Spinebreaker]].
*Find Krun Spinebreaker

==Description==
<Name>, we recently uncovered a plot to assassinate our envoy to [[Falcon Watch]]. Hellfire Citadel learned of our plans to send an expedition there earlier this morning and set up an ambush.

Our [[scout]]s have informed me that an assassin known as [[Krun Spinebreaker]] waits along the road north of the Citadel. Go there and slay this assassin. Show the [[fel orc]]s we're not to be trifled with!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thrallmar]]

==Completion==
The corpse matches the description of Krun Spinebreaker, Hellfire Citadel's assassin.  As you turn the body over, you notice a stone axe protruding from his back. 

==Notes==
This quest is known as the [[Mankrik's Wife]] of Outland.

To find the assassin, follow the road west from Thrallmar. Go past Hellfire Citadel and the [[Pools of Aggonar]]. Once you pass the pools, start following the hills on the north side of the road. You'll eventually find the assassin, or what's left of him, at {{coords|33|43|Hellfire Peninsula}}.

'''IMPORTANT''': This quest chain must get completed in order to get friendly with the [[Mag'har (faction)|Mag'har]]. If you don't complete it, you won't be able to talk to most of the people in [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]]. Alternately you can do the Garadar quest [[The Impotent Leader]].

Prerequisites for this quest chain are parts of the [[Through the Dark Portal (Horde)]] quest chain.
