==Objectives==
[[Amaan the Wise]] at the [[Temple of Telhamat]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]] wants you to travel to the [[Ruins of Sha'naar]] and retrieve 10 Sha'naar Relics. 
*[[Sha'naar Relic]] (10)

==Description==
As I've told you before, I do not require eyes to see what others cannot. I will not pass judgment on what you did on [[Makuru]]'s behalf, yet I think you need to see beyond what your eyes show you.

Travel southwest to the Ruins of Sha'naar and salvage any relics you find. If fate wills it you will find what we need.

The meaning of my request might not be immediately apparent. Have faith though, &lt;name&gt;. Clarity comes to those with patience.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Did you retrieve the Sha'naar relics, <name>?

==Completion==
You're very fortunate.  Just as I had hoped, you've found a special relic among these other ones.
