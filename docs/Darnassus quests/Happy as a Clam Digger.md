==Objectives==
Gather 10 Teldrassil Clams from the shores near [[Rut'theran Village]].
*[[Teldrassil Clam]] (10)

==Description==
It seems like everyone I know loves clams, but I can't stand them!  They're smelly and slimy, and harvesting them means digging through mud.  Give me a fishing pole and some bait any day.

Still, I want to surprise my brother with a bucket of fresh clams.  I'd reward you if you were willing to gather those clams for me.

Just go through the portal to Rut'theran Village and look for the clams in the shallows near the shore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|15}} (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+1 Fishing Skill
*[[Bag of Shiny Things]]

==Progress==
Did you find enough clams?

==Completion==
Yuck, they're so gross-looking, but they're my brother's favorite.  Thanks for sparing me from that messy job!
