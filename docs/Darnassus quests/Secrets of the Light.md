==Objectives==
Kill 7 Forsaken Herbalists and 9 Forsaken Seekers in northwest Ashenvale, then return to Maethra Slagheart in Darnassus.
*[[Forsaken Herbalist]] slain (7)
*[[Forsaken Seeker]] slain (9)

==Description==
So you'd like to learn more about the Light? You've come to the right dwarf! Healin', smitin', protectin', I do it all!

How about a practical lesson? Head out to Ashenvale and get one over on those Horde zombies acting like they own the place. The Light's good for lots o' things, but blasting the undead is my favorite!

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Great job! Nothin' like sizzling a few undead to put you in a religious mood, huh?
