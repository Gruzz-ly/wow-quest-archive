== Objectives ==
Retrieve Aquinne's Moon Pendant from the belly of a [[Giant Catfish]].  You should be able to catch them anywhere you can fish in [[Darnassus]]. 
* [[Aquinne's Moon Pendant]] (1)

== Description ==
Have you met [[Sister Aquinne]]?  She and I grew up together in [[Dolanaar]], and she recently came to the city to study at the [[Temple of the Moon]].  We decided to go for a boat ride, but the clumsy oarsman managed to capsize the craft!

When we got back to the shore, Aquinne's moon pendant was missing.  The lakes in Darnassus are full of giant catfish who will gobble up anything shiny!

I've been catching them nonstop, hoping to find the one with her pendant.  I don't suppose you want to help?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{coppercost|94000}} (or {{coppercost|165400}} on lvl 85)
+1 [[Fishing]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

== Progress ==
Have you had any luck finding Aquinne's missing pendant?  I must've caught fifty of those monsters and I have nothing to show for it! 

== Completion ==
<Astaia takes the pendant from you.>

Underneath all the slime and tarnish, I think this is it!  Aquinne will be so happy to have this back... after a thorough cleaning, of course.  I can't thank you enough, <name>.
