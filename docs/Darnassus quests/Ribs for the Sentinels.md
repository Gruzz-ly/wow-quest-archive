==Objectives==
Use the Uncooked Ribs near a stove or campfire to cook them and then use them to feed 5 [[Darnassus Sentinel]]s.
*Feed Ribs to Sentinels (5)
*[[Uncooked Ribs]] (provided)

==Description==
One of my responsibilities is to feed the sentinels of [[Darnassus]] while they're on duty.  It's a time-consuming task, but one I'm happy to undertake.  It's also a great way to practice your skills.  Would you mind helping me with today's meal? Simply take these ribs, cook them near a stove or fire, and distribute them to sentinels throughout the city.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|15}} (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level), +1 [[Cooking]] skill and +2 [[Epicurean's Award]]
*0 XP (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)

==Progress==
The sentinels train hard to keep Darnassus safe and they have big appetites!

==Completion==
Feeding all those sentinels is much easier with your help.  Nobody had to wait in line for their meal this time.

==Notes==
First cook the [[Uncooked Ribs]], then visit five Darnassus Sentinels and offer them a [[Delicious Ribs|Delicious Rib]].

After taking a ration, the Darnassus Sentinel gains a Well Fed buff (2 minutes) and says one of the following:
*{{text|say|Darnassus Sentinel|That meat smells so good.}}
*{{text|say|Darnassus Sentinel|Ribs, my favorite!}}
*{{text|say|Darnassus Sentinel|I was getting so hungry...}}
*{{text|say|Darnassus Sentinel|These are delicious!}}
*{{text|say|Darnassus Sentinel|Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Darnassus Sentinel|Where do I go for seconds?}}

==Patch changes==
