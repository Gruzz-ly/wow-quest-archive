==Objectives==
Travel to Stormwind City and speak to High Priestess Laurena in the Cathedral of Light.

==Description==
All right, <name>, let's get serious. The Light isn't some goddess you need to impress or a spirit you need to befriend. It's in all of us! All you gotta learn is how to feel it.

Treat yourself to a little trip to Stormwind and visit the Cathedral of Light. It's a great place to take some time to pray and get to know the Light. And that architecture's a sight to see!

==Completion==
There is no need to prove yourself, <name>. The Light welcomes all petitioners to its warmth.

Feel free to stay within this sanctuary as long as you like and meditate on the Light's mysteries.

==Notes==
Completing this quest allows night elf priests to [[Meditation (Season of Discovery)|meditate]] at altars of the Light and sanctified areas.
