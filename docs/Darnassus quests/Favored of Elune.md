==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 bundles of Moontouched Wood, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
*[[Commander's Holy Symbol]]
*[[Moontouched Wood]] (5)
*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
You are a true servant of [[Elune]], an example to our people, and stalwart servant of the [[Alliance]]. The [[Temple of the Moon]] and the [[court of Stormwind]] wish to honor your achievements.

We have commissioned the royal enchanter to create a staff for you.

The materials for your staff can only be found in the cursed Shadowfang Keep in Silverpine Forest. Travel there and find the lost holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moontouched wood, and ghostly essence from the spirits haunting the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Moon Staff of Elune]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
I can't believe you managed to get all those materials. I wouldn't think of venturing into Shadowfang Keep! The stories about that place are horrific.

Enough of that, though. This is a time to recognize your achievements, not prattle on about my silly fears.

==Progression==
#[[The Temple of the Moon (quest)]] (optional)
#[[Favored of Elune]]
