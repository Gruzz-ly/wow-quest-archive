'''Back to Basics''' is a [[Daily cooking quests|daily cooking quest]] available from [[Alegorn]] on the Craftsmen's Terrace in Darnassus.

==Objectives==
Help the inhabitants of the Craftsmen's Terrace and Tradesmen's Terrace make rice flour by pounding the contents of [[Rice Basket]]s.
*Practice Making Rice Flour (6)

==Description==
There are certain things that everybody needs, from the basic household cook to the master chef.  One of the city's most important staples is rice flour.  Most families keep at least one basket of rice in their houses and the residents of the [[Craftsmen's Terrace]] and [[Tradesmen's Terrace]] are no different.

I often ask my students to help with the task of pounding rice into flour since it's good practice and an endless task.  Why don't you give it a try?

==Rewards==

* {{cost|16|54|}} (at level 85)
* +1 [[Cooking]] Skill
* [[Epicurean's Award]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Have you practiced making rice flour?

==Completion==
It takes a lot of effort to ensure that there's enough flour for everyone's needs.  Thank you for your help, <name>.
