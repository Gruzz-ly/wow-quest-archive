==Objectives==
Speak with [[Klockmort Spannerspan]] in [[Ironforge]].

==Description==
A gnome friend, Klockmort Spannerspan, sent word to me from Ironforge. He tells me he needs help on a dangerous, but essential, mission into [[Gnomeregan]], the once great [[gnome]] city now contaminated and filled with [[Leper gnome|mad gnomes]] and their devices.

I must stay here, but my heart aches to help my friend. If you can go in my stead, then I would be much indebted to you.

You may find Klockmort in [[Tinkertown]], in Ironforge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 320 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles]]

==Completion==
I do!  I do need help with a mission into Gnomeregan.  And you're just the <class> to do it!
