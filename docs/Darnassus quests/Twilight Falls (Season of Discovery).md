==Objectives==
Bring 10 Twilight Pendants to [[Argent Guard Manados]] in [[Darnassus]].
* [[Twilight Pendant]] (10)

==Description==
Empowered by the ancient rites of the chaotic [[Old God]]s, the members of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] strive to bring about the return of their dark patrons and spread death and terror across the world.

We believe that the Twilight's Hammer has allied with the [[naga]] and are amassing in [[Blackfathom Deeps]] on the coast of [[Ashenvale]].

Whatever evil plan brews in the depths of the old temple must be thwarted.

Wage war on the Hammer and bring back proof of your deeds. Your efforts will be rewarded handsomely.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|Nimbus Boots of Insight
|Tender's Heartwood Girdle

* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
* +150 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Blackfathom Deeps was once an ancient [[night elf]] [[temple]]. It once housed a most powerful [[moonwell]]. Who knows what evil brews there now at the hands of the Twilight's Hammer.

Have you made any progress in ridding their presence?

==Completion==
You are no doubt of brave and noble blood, <name>. The Argent Dawn commends you for your efforts against evil.
