'''The Secret to Perfect Kimchi''' is a [[Daily cooking quests|daily cooking quest]] available from [[Alegorn]] on the Craftsmen's Terrace in Darnassus.

==Objectives==
Find 8 Buried Kimchi Jars in Darnassus.
*[[Buried Kimchi Jar]] (8)

==Description==
My family has been making the best kimchi in Darnassus for generations, <name>.  The secret is something simple, but it makes all the difference.

We bury the jars in the ground until it's ready to serve and my latest batch has just reached that point.  You can find the jars buried in earthen mounds all over the city.  Would you help me gather them while the contents are just right?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|16|54|}} (at level 85)
* +2 [[Cooking]] Skill
* [[Epicurean's Award]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find the jars?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.  There's no way I could've found them all in time and it would be a shame to miss out on so much good kimchi!

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.1.0|note=Added.}}
