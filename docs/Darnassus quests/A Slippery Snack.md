'''A Slippery Snack''' is a [[Fishing_quests#Daily_Quests|daily fishing quest]] available from [[Astaia]]{{coords|49|61|Darnassus}} on the dock in [[Tradesmen's Terrace]] in [[Darnassus]].

==Objectives==
Gather 6 Baby Octopi from the shallow water near [[Rut'theran Village]].
*[[Baby Octopus (item)]] (6)

==Description==
Have you ever eaten octopus meat? It takes some getting used to, but it's my favorite! I even know some people who like to eat the whole thing while it's alive!

I don't plan on trying that anytime soon, but I am out of fresh octopi at the moment. Will you help me gather some more? They live in the shallow water off the shore near Rut'theran Village.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54}} (at max level)
*+2 [[Fishing]] Skill
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}
*[[Bag of Shiny Things]]

==Progress==
It's impossible to catch octopi with a fishing line, so you're just going to have to grab them!

==Completion==
These are going to be delicious, I can already tell! Thanks, <name>!

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.1.0|note=Added.}}
