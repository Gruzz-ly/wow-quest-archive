== Objectives ==
Catch 5 Lake Whitefish by fishing in Darnassus.
* [[Lake Whitefish]] (5)

== Description ==
We've used up most of our food stores in taking care of refugees and feeding those whose homes and livelihoods [[Shattering|were destroyed]].  If we don't replenish our stores, we'll all be in danger next time there's a bad storm or a [[Horde]] invasion.

Perhaps you'd be willing to help me build up our stock of lake whitefish.  You can catch it anywhere in Darnassus, and once it's dried, it'll keep until it's needed.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{coppercost|94000}} (or {{coppercost|165400}} on lvl 85)
+1 [[Fishing]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

== Progress ==
If all of our fishermen pitch in, it won't take long to rebuild our supplies.

== Completion ==
These are beautiful!  Thank you, <name>.  I'll set them out to dry.

== Patch changes ==
