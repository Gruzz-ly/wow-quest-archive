==Objectives==
Collect the Blessed Rice Cakes from the [[Temple of the Moon]].
*[[Blessed Rice Cakes]]

==Description==
The living are not the only ones who require sustenance. One of my duties is to prepare the rice cakes that are left for the ancestors. Normally, my senior apprentice has the honor of taking the cakes to the Temple of the Moon for blessing and then presenting them to the ancestors. Since she is out of the city today, would you mind performing the duty in her place?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|15}} (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*0 XP (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+1 Cooking Skill
*[[Epicurean's Award]]

==Progress==
This is the shrine the trainer mentioned.

==Completion==
<You lay out the rice cakes around the shrine, which begins to glow softly. A faint sense of approval washes over you.>
