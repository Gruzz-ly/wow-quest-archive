'''The Lost Army''' is an optional side quest in [[Trial of Valor]] that can be completed on all difficulties. It rewards an ensemble that unlocks access to the [[Trial of Valor]] [[Appearances]] set.

==Objectives==
Gather 1000 Valarjar Soul Fragments within the [[Trial of Valor]] Raid.
* [[Valarjar Soul Fragment]] (1000)

==Description==
While Helya's defeat is your primary objective, I require more of your aid. [[Helya]] has gained the ability to steal and corrupt the souls of my [[Valarjar]]. Her minions hold these souls, corrupting them. I am certain Helya herself hordes the greatest Valarjar souls to herself. You must recover these lost souls, then return them to me.

Do this and I will reward you with blessed guard from the hall's armory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
*Normal variant transmog set:
**[[Ensemble: Funerary Plate of the Chosen Dead]] (Warrior, Paladin, Death Knight)
**[[Ensemble: Chains of the Chosen Dead]] (Hunter, Shaman)
**[[Ensemble: Garb of the Chosen Dead]] (Rogue, Monk, Druid, Demon Hunter)
**[[Ensemble: Vestment of the Chosen Dead]] (Priest, Mage, Warlock)

==Progress==
Bring me the souls of my lost Valarjar. Only then will I reward you with the blessed armor you desire.

==Completion==
With these souls returned to the Halls of Valor my forces return to their former strength. As promised, the bounty is yours.
