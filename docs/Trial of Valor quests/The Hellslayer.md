==Objectives==
Defeat [[Helya (Trial of Valor tactics)|Helya]] and forge a hammer from the [[Frostveined Shale]] in the [[Trial of Valor]].
* [[Hellslayer Hammer]]

==Description==
The [[Hellslayer]]'s tale is a classic story of revenge. [[Odyn]] wished to take the [[soul]]s of the bravest as champions but [[Helya]] sent her [[kvaldir]] to take the souls first. The people of [[Stormheim]] suffered as their pawns. 

The kvaldir came to the Hellslayer's ship at night and killed her son and took his soul to serve Helya for eternity. The Hellslayer took up her axe and the spear of her son and sought vengeance. Finish her quest. Defeat Helya and forge a hammer from the Frostveined Shale.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}

==Progress==
The Frostveined Shale is what remains of the Hellslayer's weapons after they were destroyed on Helya's cold forge. It is powerful stuff and we need it.

==Completion==
The hammer is perfect but rather cold. I do respect your craftsmanship!
