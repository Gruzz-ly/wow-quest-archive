==Objectives==
Defeat Helya in the Trials of Valor raid and then use the Soul Prism of the Illidari to claim Illidan's Soul.
* [[Helya (Trial of Valor tactics)|Helya]] slain
* Illidan Stormrage's Soul claimed
* Return the Soul Prism of the Illidari to Light's Heart in your Order Hall.
* [[Soul Prism of the Illidari]] (provided)

==Description==
While tracking the master's physical body proved challenging, we were able to locate it in the [[Nighthold]] of [[Suramar City|Suramar]]. Our intelligence reports that [[Gul'dan]] is making final preparations to the [[Nightwell]] in order to use its power to usher the soul of [[Sargeras]] into [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]]'s body.

The only way to stop that from happening is to put Illidan's own immortal soul back.

Take the Soul Prism of the Illidari and venture to [[Helheim]]. Defeat Helya and use the prism on Illidan's soul! Return it to [[:Light's Heart]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:
*{{cost|80|88}}
* 12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We do not know how Illidan's soul ended up in the underworld of Helheim, but we speculate that Gul'dan struck a bargain with Helya to make it happen.

==Completion==
<Light's Heart illuminates brightly and seemingly consumes the Soul Prism.>

==Notes==

This quest can be completed on any difficulty. Illidan's soul can be found on the right-side steps in Helya's area.
