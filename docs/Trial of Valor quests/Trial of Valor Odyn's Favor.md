==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Odyn.jpg|Odyn}}
Gain Odyn's favor within the Trial of Valor Raid.
* Defeat [[Odyn (Trial of Valor tactics)|Odyn]] in the Trial of Valor Raid.

==Description==
The time to deal with that [[Helya|treacherous witch]] has come. I suspect you may be the one to deal the final blow, but I must be certain.

See me in the [[Halls of Valor]] and we will test the strength of your will.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Titan's Boon
}}

* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Now a greater task awaits you.

==Notes==
Take the path leading southeast out of [[Valdisdall]] and head into the large building at the [[Gates of Valor]]. The entrance to the [[Trial of Valor]] raid instance will be on the right.

Do '''not''' go into the Halls of Valor as the description implies.
