'''Felendren the Banished''' is part of the Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle [[quest chain]] and a [[blood elf]] only quest.

== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Arcane Wraiths and 2 Tainted Arcane Wraiths, as well as [[Felendren the Banished]]; they are located in the [[Falthrien Academy]]. Bring Felendren's Head to [[Lanthan Perilon]] on [[Sunstrider Isle]].
*[[Arcane Wraith]] slain (8)
*[[Tainted Arcane Wraith]] slain (2)
*[[Felendren's Head]]

== Description ==
A betrayer of our people resides atop Falthrien Academy to the southwest.

Felendren is his name, and he was banished from blood elf lands for failing to heed the warnings of our teachers and elders. He is the worst of our society, as he lives only to feed his insatiable magical addictions. He refused to learn control; he is a shell of his former self - one of the [[Wretched]] - and he is a threat to the [[Sunspire]].

Destroy him and the wraiths he uses as minions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2}}
*550 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

{{itembox|You will be able to choose from:|Sunstrider Bow|Sunstrider Shield}}

== Progress ==
Heed well this warning - Felendren the Banished is only a symptom of a much larger problem.  His demise will solve our immediate concerns, but all [[Blood elf|blood elves]] share the potential same fate as him if we let our addictions get the best of us.

== Completion ==
Feldren's head... you are to be commended, <Name>.  You've succeeded where others, like Felendren, have utterly failed.  Perhaps you are truly ready to be a contributing member of blood elf society.

Your success here means that you are capable of surviving the greater threats that lurk in [[Eversong Woods|Eversong]]... and believe me, there are plenty to face.
