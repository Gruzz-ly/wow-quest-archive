'''A Fistful of Slivers''' is a [[blood elf]] only quest.

==Objectives==
Collect 6 Arcane Slivers from any creature on the isle that uses mana, and then return to [[Arcanist Ithanas]] on [[Sunstrider Isle]].
* [[Arcane Sliver]] (6)

==Description==
It's a shame that we've lost control of many of the creatures here on the island. This was once a tranquil place of study and research. Now it's all we can do to keep from being attacked by our own creations!

I'm going to offer you a chance to receive a magical boon in exchange for some collecting work on your part. Bring me a stack of arcane slivers that are found on the mana-using creatures of Sunstrider Isle, and I will cast a spell on you that should aid your adventures on the isle.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Daylight Cloak}}

You will also receive:
*360 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Many of the creatures here on the isle were at one point bound into non-aggression and complacency by our magical skills.  When the [[Scourge]] destroyed the [[Sunwell]], our hold over these creatures shattered.  Arcane slivers are the remnants of the control we once had, and as such might be usable in fashioning a new device to aid us in regaining their control.

Better still, perhaps the slivers could be used to see what malaise the isle truly suffers under...

==Completion==
Splendid - these will do nicely.  I've been doing quite a bit of thinking on the current malaise Sunstrider Isle suffers under.  One possible course of action I had pondered was to collect these arcane slivers from the beasts on the isle.  In doing so, they could be experimented on; this would provide a potential source of culpability.

Anyway, I will tend to the research.  Allow me to place this incantation on you.  I believe you'll make good use of it!

==Trivia==
*The name of the quest is a reference to the film {{Wp|A Fistful of Dollars}}.
