==Objectives==
Spar with Trainers in [[Sunstrider Isle]].
* [[Ranger Hannovia]] sparred
* [[Jesthenis Sunstriker]] sparred
* [[Magister Jaronis]] sparred
* [[Kyltus]] assisted

==Description==
Champion! Perhaps you can help me?

I've spent months learning bits of each path--the bow of the [[Farstriders]], the [[Light]] of the [[Blood Knights]], the [[arcane]] teachings of the [[magisters]]... but no matter how hard I train, I still can't feel which one is truly right for me.

If I could watch you face them--see their true strength in a real fight--I think perhaps then I'd finally understand where I belong. Could you help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
