'''Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle''' is the starter [[quest]] for [[blood elf]] players. It is only available to blood elves.

==Objectives==
Kill 6 Mana Wyrms; they are located close to the [[Burning Crystal]]s that are adjacent to the tower and gazebo. Return to [[Magistrix Erona]] at the tower on [[Sunstrider Isle]] when you are done.
* [[Mana Wyrm (mob)|Mana Wyrm]]  slain (6)

==Description==
The sooner you begin your education, <name>, the better for us all. There is little room for error, so listen closely.

The [[Burning Crystal]]s - the green floating objects to the west of the [[Sunspire]] here - have long been used to power the isle's experimentations. The mana wyrms were their guardians, but the [[Scourge]] invasion of [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Quel'Thalas]] has driven them errant from our lack of magical control over them.

There is little choice but to thin their numbers for reclamation. Do this, then return to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Green Plate Boots|Wyrm Sash}}

* You will also receive:
* {{cost|||50}}
* 120 [[XP]]
* 250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Our work in rebuilding our society begins here, <name>. Once we are able to secure our home, we can look outward and upward.

==Completion==
You have successfully completed your first task; for that, you are to be congratulated. Such success gives me faith that you will turn out better than those young blood elves who fail to heed the lessons of their masters. Continued success will be rewarded - not only with knowledge, but also with tangible rewards as well.

Your work here, however, is not finished. There is much more to learn, my young friend...

==Notes==
The Mana Wyrms are quite plentiful and will most likely be the first creature you encounter near Magistrix Erona, they are not aggressive and will not attack you until you attack them.

==Progression==
