==Objectives==
Collect 8 Lynx Collars from slain Springpaw Lynxes and Springpaw Cubs. Return to [[Magistrix Erona]] on [[Sunstrider Isle]] when you are done.
* [[Lynx Collar]] (8)

==Description==
Your effort has made something clear that, honestly, I wish were not true. The unchecked power of the [[Burning Crystal]]s has maligned a much larger swath of the isle's natural balance than I thought. We must now take on more unfortunate measures to reclaim control.

The nearby lynxes have succumbed to the influence of the crystals, and they must be put down. Bring their collars, <name>, as I may yet be able to fashion a magical restraint to turn some back from being uncontrolled.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Green Plate Vest|Lynxskin Gloves|Sunrise Bracers|Verdant Chain Gloves}}
You will receive:
*{{cost|||50}}
*500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
It gives me no pleasure to ask you to destroy these beasts. While in times past we have lived in relative harmony with woodland creatures, these are different times. The first order of business for all [[sin'dorei]] is survival; make sure you remember that.

==Completion==
The tower and surrounding areas should now be relatively secure, though only for the time being.  You have done well in providing us with a buffer of security, but we will need to reassert control over the entire isle if we are to survive here in the long run.  This will involve tackling much greater threats than errant [[mana wyrm]]s and [[lynx]]es.

Take this, <name> - you will no doubt make good use of it for the tasks to come.
