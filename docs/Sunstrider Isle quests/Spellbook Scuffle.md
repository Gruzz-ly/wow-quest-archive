==Objectives==
Collect 9 Torn Spellbook Pages from arcane tomes in [[Sunstrider Isle]].
* [[Torn Spellbook Page]] (9)

==Description==
You there! I've heard whispers of your so-called 'heroics,' but I'm convinced they must be false. For if they were true, it would mean you would have achieved more than I, [[Tytalor Goldenblade]]--the finest, smartest, and most handsome [[mage]] at this academy.

Therefore, I challenge you to prove your worth, if you are not a coward. The arcane tomes will make a fine warm-up for you... if you survive. Tear out their pages and prove you're not a complete fraud.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,750 [[XP]]
