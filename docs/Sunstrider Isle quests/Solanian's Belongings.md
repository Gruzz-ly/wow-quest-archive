==Objectives==
Collect [[Well Watcher Solanian]]'s Scrying Orb, his Scroll of Scourge Magic, and his Journal. They are found on [[Sunstrider Isle]] by the pond, the fountain, and one of the [[Burning Crystal]]s. Return them to the Well Watcher at the [[Sunspire]] on Sunstrider Isle when you've collected them all.
*[[Solanian's Scrying Orb]] {{co|35.1|28.9|Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)}}
*[[Scroll of Scourge Magic]] {{co|31.3|22.7|Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)}}
*[[Solanian's Journal]] {{co|37.7|24.9|Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)}}

==Description==
With all the chaos happening here at the Sunspire, I haven't had a chance to collect my belongings I've left outside at various places on the isle. I must maintain my vigil over the [[Sunwell]] here, so I'll ask you to collect them in my stead.

I need my scrying orb, my scroll of Scourge magic, and my journal. Use this satchel for some extra space, as my things are rather bulky. Return them to me and I'll give you a little something - you know, for the effort; you can keep the satchel as well!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||75}}
*360 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sunspire Cord|Well Watcher Gloves|Sunspire Cinch}}

==Progress==
Have you had a chance to find my belongings? Once we reassert our dominance over Sunstrider Isle, I will need them in my work. For now though, I must maintain my watch over the Sunwell... or what remains of it. 

==Completion==
Well done - I knew you'd be perfect for the task. Once it's safe to make use of our outdoor facilities on the isle, I'll be putting these things to good use.

Like I mentioned, please feel free to keep the satchel. Also, you may find this piece of armor to be useful. Consider it ample compensation for a simple task performed dutifully!

==Notes==
Accepting the quest will equip the player with [[Sunstrider Book Satchel]] (or put it into their inventory if they have no free bag slots).
