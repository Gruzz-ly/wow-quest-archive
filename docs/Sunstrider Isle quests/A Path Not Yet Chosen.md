==Objectives==
Collect Recommendations from the [[Farstriders|Farstrider]], [[Blood Knights|Blood Knight]] and [[Magisters|magister]] Trainers.
*[[Farstrider Recommendation]]
*[[Blood Knight Recommendation]]
*[[Magister Recommendation]]

==Description==
I'm trying to figure out what career path to follow, but I keep second-guessing myself. The Farstriders, the Blood Knights, the magisters... they all seem so incredible that I can't decide.

I was hoping if I spoke to each and earned a recommendation, I might finally understand where I'm meant to be. Would you help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,900 [[XP]]
*[[Silvermoon Court (commendation)]] (50, wb)

==Progress==
I really hope I find where I belong...

==Completion==
Wow... I can't believe I actually got all three recommendations. They all said such kind things, but now I feel even more torn than before!

Do you think... perhaps you could help me choose?

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Kyltus Bloodburn|Hmm, what to choose...}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Kyltus Bloodburn|Let's get those recommendations!}}
:''Kyltus runs towards the hunters.''

This opens up quests from the three trainers nearby. Complete each to receive the recommendation.
