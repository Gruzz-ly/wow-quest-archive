==Objectives==
Bring 8 Nether Residue to [[Emissary Mordin]] in [[Shattrath City]].
*[[Nether Residue]] (8)

==Description==
The troops of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] will need every advantage they can get to beat back the allies of [[Kil'jaeden]]. My colleagues in [[Stormwind]] have created oils which will strengthen the blades and armor of our troops.

The key ingredient, nether residue, pervades [[Outland]] -- if you know where to look. Any master [[herbalist]], [[skinner]], or [[miner]] who knows the signs can gather it while plying his trade. Those herbs, ores, and beasts unique to Outland may all bear the residue.

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Major Rejuvenation Potion]] x1

You will also receive: {{cost|8|80}} ({{cost|16|39}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you any residue for me?

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>. No contribution to the war effort is too small. Our men are going to need every advantage they can get in this battle.

==Notes==
*Drops off any Outland mob when skinned, any Outland herb when gathered or any Outland vein when mined.
*Reports indicates that the residue does not drop from [[Nethercite Ore]] deposits on the [[Netherwing Ledge]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].  The residue does drop from the [[Adamantite Ore]] deposits there.
*[[Mana Thistle]] and Ore deposits found on the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]] are able to drop Nether Residue.

==Patch changes==
