==Objectives==
{{NPC||A'dal}} in [[Shattrath City]] wants you to recover the Unused Axe of the Executioner from the [[Shattered Halls]] of [[Hellfire Citadel]].

This quest must be completed in Heroic dungeon difficulty.
* [[Unused Axe of the Executioner]]

==Description==
Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru.

Within the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel are three of your people. They are held there by the merciless one, Kargath Bladefist. He seeks to execute them as a sign of his virility and power. You must save these prisoners before such an atrocity can come to pass. As proof of deed, bring me the unused axe of the executioner. It must not have a drop of blood on its blade!

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*+500 reputation with [[Sha'tar]]
* 19,000 [[experience]] (or {{cost|11|40}} at 70)

==Progress==
<A'dal greets you.>

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. You have passed the trial of mercy.

==Notes==
The [[Flamewrought Key]] is required to open Heroic Mode in Hellfire Citadel. The key can be obtained at {{reputation|honored}} reputation with [[Honor Hold]] or [[Thrallmar]].

After defeating [[Grand Warlock Nethekurse]] and upon entering the gauntlet afterwards, your group has 80 minutes to reach [[Warchief Kargath Bladefist]]. Similar to the quest [[Dead Man's Plea]] - the 45-minute baron run - a timer-debuff appears and Kargath Bladefist will occasionally yell something about executing the prisoners. Although you lose the debuff upon death you still can complete the quest.

The quest description is misleading, as a prisoner or two may be killed and you can still get the quest item - so don't be quick to give up if you miss the deadline, or even a few kills.
