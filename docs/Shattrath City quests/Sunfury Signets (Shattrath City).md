==Description==
As you might know, the Scryers and the armies of [[Kael'thas]] are at war. Kael sees us as a threat to his influence over other [[Blood elf|blood elves]] and has tried to crush us time and again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]
*-275 reputation with [[The Aldor]]

==Progress==
Go on, <name>.  Speak.
