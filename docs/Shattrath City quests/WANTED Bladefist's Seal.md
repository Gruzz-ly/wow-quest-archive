'''WANTED: Bladefist's Seal''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Objectives==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] has asked you to obtain [[Bladefist's Seal]]. Deliver it to him in [[Shattrath]]'s [[Lower City]] to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[Bladefist's Seal]]

==Description==
Today I have a very wealthy collector in need of something very unique indeed.

[[Warchief Kargath Bladefist]] carries upon his person his seal of command, which he uses to sign all official documents. I want you to retrieve it for me.

You will find him deep within the [[Shattered Halls]]. No doubt you will have to wade through a veritable army to get to him. I have no doubt that you will succeed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with the [[Consortium]]
* +350 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]/[[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
I have heard it whispered that the warchief has weapons in place of his hands. Is this true?

==Completion==
Truly a daring acquisition that the bards should put pen to parchment for. Here, you have more than earned this.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
*This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Shattered Halls]]. It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.
*Originally spelled '''Wanted: Bladefist's Seal'''.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Added.}}
