==Objectives==
Take Socrethar's Teleportation Stone to High Priestess [[Ishanah]] at the [[Shrine of Unending Light]] on the [[Aldor Rise]] in [[Shattrath City]].

Performing quests for the [[Aldor]] will cause your [[Scryers]] reputation to decrease.
*[[Socrethar's Teleportation Stone]] (provided)

==Description==
The time has come to face [[Socrethar]], <name>. Confronting an [[eredar]] leader isn't something that's taken lightly among us. A single mistake is likely to cost us our lives if we're ill-prepared.

Take Socrethar's teleportation stone to High Priestess Ishanah at the Shrine of Unending Light in Shattrath City. She will determine how we need to handle the situation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9500 [[XP]] (or {{cost||57|}} at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-165 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
What troubles you, child?

==Completion==
Socrethar... I remember that name. He was once a renowned warrior of the [[Light]] and pride was his only flaw.

==Progression==
{{Deathblow to the Legion}}
