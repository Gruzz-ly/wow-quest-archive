*[[Coilfang Myrmidon]] slain (14)

==Description==
Mah'duun hears and obeys, and I now ask you to be my instrument.

It has been related to me that the myrmidons of the [[coilfang tribe]] must be destroyed. Seek them out within the humid confines of the [[Steamvault]] underneath [[Coilfang Reservoir]].

I will accept nothing less than their utter annihilation.

==Rewards==

*+250 reputation with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
How fares your fight against the coilfang myrmidons?

==Completion==
I trust that it was a fight worthy of your time? Certainly this bounty will be.

Return again tomorrow and the winds will have whispered once more to Mah'duun.
