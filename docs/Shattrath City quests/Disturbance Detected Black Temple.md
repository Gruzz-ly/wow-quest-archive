==Objectives==
Relive the assault on the [[Black Temple]].
* [[Illidan Stormrage (tactics)|Illidan Stormrage]] defeated
* [[Timewarped Illidari Battleplans]]

==Description==
<Name>, right on time, as always.

Good news first, because they're happening at the same time for me anyway. Thanks to the various timewarped objects past and future you discovered, we've figured out how to detect when a new one turns up.

The bad news is, we know our technique works because something has changed in the Black Temple, and it's wreaking havoc across the timescape! We need you to ensure the fateful raid turns out exactly like it did before, and to remove the source of this disturbance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|50}}
*10,950 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Timewarped Treasures]]
*500 [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
Be extra careful the raid on the temple turns out exactly like it did before. One extra flap of dragonfly wings, and you might end up killing [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]] for real! Then imagine the mess we'd be in!

==Completion==
What's this, <name>?

These are the plans for the raid on [[Mardum, the Shattered Abyss|Mardum]], were we too late?

What's strange, is the new plan seems better than the original! It's unlikely this is the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s doing, Illidan surely would have detected any [[fel]] manipulation. So if not the Legion, who is behind this?

==Notes==
While this quest is available at level 30, level 50 is required to queue for the Timewalking version of the Black Temple.
