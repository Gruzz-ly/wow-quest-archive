==Objectives==
[[Voren'thal the Seer]] in [[Shattrath City]] wants you to obtain an Arcane Tome.

Performing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.
*[[Arcane Tome]]

==Description==
Arcane tomes are not ordinary books that happen to deal with arcane matters.  There is intrinsic power in them - a power I've learned to synthesize into a single arcane rune.

Should you find an arcane tome in your travels I will give you one such rune.  Only the most powerful wielders of magic carry the books I need.  In [[Outland]] this usually means Kael's blood elves - but you'd be surprised by where such tomes often turn up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*15,800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|48|}} at max level)
*-385 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+350 reputation with [[The Scryers]]
*[[Arcane Rune]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained an arcane tome yet, <name>?

==Completion==
As promised, <name>. &nbsp;The entirety of the book's raw power, condensed into a single rune.
