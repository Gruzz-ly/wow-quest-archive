==Objectives==
Speak to [[A'dal]], the leader of the [[Sha'tar]], in the center of the [[Terrace of Light]].

==Description==
Welcome to [[Shattrath City]], <class>. This might be the one place in all of [[Outland]] where you'll find any semblance of safety.

A group of [[naaru]] known as the Sha'tar drove the [[demon]]s away from here.

If you've never met a naaru, you ought to see A'dal inside the Terrace of Light. The leader of the Sha'tar is an awe-inspiring sight if I ever saw one. Sure is a change of pace from anything else in this bleak land.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5500 [[XP]] (or {{cost||58|50}} at level 70)
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Completion==
<The light that filled your senses as you approached A'dal intensifies as you address him. Melodic chimes continue to ring within your head.>

<You are safe here.>

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|[[Archmage Khadgar]]|Do not burden A'dal with mundane questions, <race>.  This being's will is all that keeps our enemies from crushing this city.}}
