'''WANTED: Aeonus's Hourglass''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

== Objectives ==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] has asked you to acquire [[Aeonus' Hourglass]].  Deliver it to him in Shattrath's [[Lower City]] to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[Aeonus' Hourglass]]

== Description ==
I swear that some of my customers are crazy.  There are possessions that you go after, and there are ones that you dare not even think of!

My current client is clearly over-the-top insane.  He covets the hourglass that [[Aeonus]] holds.

Yes, you heard right, Aeonus of the [[infinite dragonflight|Infinite Dragonflight]]!

Who am I to argue since he's paying a king's ransom? So, ready to go to the [[Caverns of Time]] and travel to the [[Black Morass (instance)|Black Morass]] to retrieve it for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with the [[Keepers of Time]]
* +350 reputation with the [[Consortium]]

== Progress ==
If I were you, I would be very careful with time-travel.  You wouldn't want to accidentally do something, like kill one of your ancestors, and then accidentally erase yourself from the present!

== Completion ==
Odd that the sands in that thing are still falling upward.  I think I will have it delivered to its new owner with all due haste.

I thank you for a job well done, <class>.  You have certainly earned your commission.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Black Morass]]. It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
* {{Patch 4.0.1|note=[[Badge of Justice]] removed from game. Heroic dailies now reward 10 [[Justice Points]].}}
* {{Patch 2.4.0|note=Added.}}
