==Objectives==
Bring 30 Arakkoa Feathers to [[Vekax]] in [[Shattrath]]'s [[Lower City]].
*[[Arakkoa Feather]] (30)

==Description==
As an [[Arakkoa Outcasts|outcast]], I am marked by death by [[arakkoa]] loyal to the city of [[Skettis]]. I cannot leave these walls for fear of my life, but that doesn't mean I cannot strike at them in retaliation.

I have a small cache of treasure that I'm willing to part with, should you help me strike back at my would-be assassins. Bring me feathers from the denizens of the various [[List of arakkoa towns|Veils]] of [[Terokkar Forest|Terokkar]] as proof of their demise.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|30|}}
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]
*[[Outcast's Cache]]

==Progress==
Do you bring the feathers I asked for, <name>?

==Completion==
<Vekax squawks in glee as you present him with proof of his enemies' demise.>

Yes, that will show Skettis that we Outcasts will not take their punishment lying down. Here is the reward I promised you. I can arrange for more, should you provide me with additional feathers.
