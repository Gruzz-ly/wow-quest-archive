'''Report to Nasuun''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have activated the [[Sunwell]] portal, this quest replaced [[Report to Nasuun]].

==Objectives==
[[Tradesman Portanuus]] has asked you to speak with [[Exarch Nasuun]] on the [[Terrace of Light]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Description==
I am most glad that you are here, <class>! When we took this sanctum from the [[wretched]], we hurried to create a magical portal that leads here from Shattrath City in the [[Outland]].

My liege lord, [[Exarch Nasuun]], is heading up the [[Shattered Sun Offensive|Offensive]]'s efforts to maintain that portal. He asked me to send along any promising candidates who have what it takes to help with acquiring more energy to fuel it.

Please, travel to Shattrath City and speak with him inside [[A'dal]]'s chamber on the Terrace of Light.

==Completion==
Portanuus sent you? Good, we haven't any time to spare!
