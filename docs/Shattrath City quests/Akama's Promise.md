'''Akama's Promise''' is the final reward quest for the [[Akama]] chain of quests. Afterwards, [[The Secret Compromised]] opens up, involving speaking to Seer Olum in [[Serpentshrine Cavern]].

==Objectives==
Bring the [[Medallion of Karabor (quest item)]] to [[A'dal]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Description==
<Akama inserts [[Heart of Fury|the crystal]] into the medallion in his hand.>

I am not as strong as I once was, <name>. Being so close to evil itself all these years - I do not know if I can trust myself with an artifact as powerful as this.

Take this as my promise to you that when the time comes and you face Illidan, I will be on your side. Take it to the one being we know we can trust with its power. Take the medallion to A'dal in Shattrath City.

==Progress==
<A'dal notices your approach and a warm light embraces you. A'dal seems to know you have something for him.>

==Completion==
<As you give the medallion to A'dal, it disappears into his being in a flash of light.>

<You are briefly shown a glimpse of a moment... perhaps in the future. You see Akama and Maiev coming out of the Warden's Cage, fighting their way to the Dark Temple. A third figure shrouded in shadows is aiding them. Upon closer inspection you notice that the figure is you.>

==Reward==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Akama's Sash
|Ashtongue Blade
|Bloodwarder's Rifle
