'''WANTED: A Black Stalker Egg''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Objectives==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] wants you to obtain a [[Black Stalker Egg]].  Deliver it to him in Shattrath's [[Lower City]] to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[Black Stalker Egg]]

==Description==
There is only ever one great mother of the [[marsh walker]]s in [[Zangarmarsh]].  She is always known as [[the Black Stalker]], and she hatches from one of the eggs left behind when her mother dies.

I have a buyer who is interested in one of those eggs.  He mentioned something about adding her as a zoo attraction.

If you are interested in the reward I am offering, travel to the [[Underbog]] and slay the Black Stalker for her egg.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with the [[Consortium]]
* +350 reputation with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
We're speaking again because you have the egg?  Outstanding, let me see it!

==Completion==
Is it not amazing to feel the life pulsing within the egg?  I must hurry to deliver it to the purchaser.  We wouldn't want it hatching here now would we?

Your payment is ready.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Underbog]].  It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Added.}}
