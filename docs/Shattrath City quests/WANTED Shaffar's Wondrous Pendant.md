'''WANTED: Shaffar's Wondrous Pendant''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Objectives==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] wants you to obtain [[Shaffar's Wondrous Amulet]].  Deliver it to him in Shattrath's [[Lower City]] to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[Shaffar's Wondrous Amulet]]

==Description==
Today I have a personal request of you, yet the reward will certainly match the danger.

My family has a 'history', shall we say, with [[Nexus-Prince Shaffar]] and his followers.  If the amulet he wears were to fall into my hands then surely that would mean that he had been dealt with.

If the bounty I am offering is of interest to you then journey to his lair within [[Auchindoun]]'s [[Mana-Tombs]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
*16,250 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with the [[Consortium]]
*+350 reputation with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
Not many know that the source of Shaffar's magic rests solely within his amulet.  Without it he is powerless.

Then again, if you have it that must mean that he is dead.

==Completion==
<You sense a deep level of satisfaction from the wind trader.>

Good, I am glad to hear of his demise.  And perhaps I will be able to unlock the secrets of his amulet for myself.  If not, then I will sell it for a handsome price.

I trust that this reward is sufficient.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Mana-Tombs]]. It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Added.}}
