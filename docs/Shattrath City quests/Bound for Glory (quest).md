==Objectives==
Bring [[Socrethar's Teleportation Stone]] to [[Voren'thal the Seer]] at the [[Scryer's Tier]] in [[Shattrath City]].

Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.

==Description==
Now I can properly send you back to Shattrath City. You've uncovered evidence of [[Kael'thas]] making pacts with the [[Burning Legion]] and you've got the key to the overlord's back door.

Make sure Voren'thal doesn't topple over with excitement from the news - the old man's getting a bit fragile, if you know what I mean. You'll find him inside the [[Seer's Library]] at the Scryer's Tier.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9500 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|70|}} at max level)
*-165 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Completion==
You have no idea what this will mean for the Scryers, <name>. You will have to excuse me while I catch my breath and assess the situation.

==Progression==
{{Turning Point}}

==Patch changes==
