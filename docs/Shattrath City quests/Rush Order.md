==Objectives==
Speak to Beruun. Perhaps he knows a way to convince Ataanya to leave [[Shattrath]].
*Speak to [[Apprentice Beruun|Beruun]]
*Draenite miners located
*[[Draenite Crate]]s loaded (3)
*[[Draenite Fragments]] gathered
*Draenite delivered to crystalsmiths
*[[Signed Work Orders]]
*Work orders brought to [[High Artificer Ataanya|Ataanya]]

==Description==
My schematics speak for themselves.

Each calculation has been verified. It is respectful of all building codes. I even included a layout of the channels that the power grid must follow.

[[Romuul]] knows the project. He already signed off on everything. He can explain it to the masses himself.

I do not need to waste my valuable time traveling to the [[Exodar]] for [[Tishamaat|this ridiculous holiday]].

My apprentice will give you the schematics on a data crystal. Take it and leave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max-level)

==Progress==
We will do what we can for Ataanya.

==Completion==
Hm, it was worth a try.

It seems it will be difficult to get her to the Tishamaat...

But I have another idea.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|Get the crystal from Beruun. Then, get out of my workshop.}}

Speak to Apprentice Beruun nearby:
{{Dialogue|<Beruun leans in and lowers his voice.>

Romuul sent Ataanya many messages about the Tishamaat. They usually have a good relationship but... she ignored them and has been very annoyed ever since. Well, more annoyed than usual.

She claims the travel time to the Exodar cuts into her workload. But... I think it's really something to do with the Tishamaat. Lessening her workload should at least, uh, cheer her up, yes?

I know she has a [[draenite]] shipment coming into [[Shattrath City|the city]], but it's late. Maybe you could track it down?

Perhaps then she will have "time" to travel to the Exodar.

{{Gossip|quest=|I'll try to locate the draenite shipment.}}}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Beruun|It's worth a try. Though if the Tishamaat is what is putting her in a bad mood, it might not work.}}

Head to the eastern entrance and find a caravan with [[Miner Landani]], [[Miner Jareeth]], and a pair of [[Frazzled Talbuk]]s at {{Co|40.20|24.83|Terokkar Forest}}.
:{{Text|say|Miner Landani|Hey, you! Lend us a hand? Our cargo went haywire and knocked crates off our wagon!}}
:{{Text|say|Miner Jareeth|[[Netherstorm]] draenite is the worst. We should have reinforced the crates!}}

On the ground behind the wagon are [[Draenite Crate]]s. Throwing them back onto the wagon spawns [[Unstable Draenite]]s and [[Draenite Shard]]s. Once all three are returned, interact with [[Draenite Fragments]].
:{{Text|say|Miner Landani|Thank you! We will handle the crates. You can take those draenite fragments to the crystalsmiths.}}

The character is {{Abilities|Carrying Draenite|id=430572|icon=inv_misc_gem_ebondraenite_02}}. Return back to Shattrah and head to the orphanage building in [[Lower City]]. On the left side are [[Shattrath Crystalsmith]]s and [[Crystalsmith Laharu]].

Speak with Laharu:
{{Dialogue|Greetings. 

If you are in need of crystalsmithing services, I am not sure we have time for any new orders, but I will see what I can do.

The artificers have been keeping us very busy recently.

{{Gossip|quest=|Here is some of the High Artificer's draenite order. The rest is on the way.}}}}
:{{Text|say|Crystalsmith Laharu|Ah, the lost shipment! Tell the High Artificer we will process it after the Tishamaat. We are closing for the holiday!}}

{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|What is the difference between a [[crystalsmith]] and an [[artificer]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Ah, interested in the trade, are you?

Crystalsmiths process raw crystals into materials that artificers can use. Typically this means removing impurities, reforging energy channels, cutting to size, and faceting based on intended use.

Artificers then assemble these materials into whatever they might be building.

{{Gossip|Why don't artificers do that work themselves?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Well, why does not every painter make their own paints?

Some might prefer to, but they are different skills, and the Light calls us all to different paths.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}}}

After the fragments are delivered, return to Ataanya and speak to her:
{{Dialogue|Why are you still here?

Beruun is distracted enough without someone lurking about.

{{Gossip|quest=|I took your draenite shipment to the crystalsmiths. Here are your completed work orders.}}}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|You-- If I needed help, I would have asked for it.}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|My work is very precise! I don't need a clumsy novice's hands in it!}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|Beruun! Get the crystal. <Name>, take it to Romuul. Tell him I have my reasons for not attending the Tishamaat!}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Beruun|Yes, High Artificer. Come, <name>. I will get the crystal for you.}}

The objectives are now complete, turn in to Beruun.
