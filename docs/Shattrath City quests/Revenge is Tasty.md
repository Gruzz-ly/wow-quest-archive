'''Revenge is Tasty''' requires Cooking skill of 275.

==Objectives==
[[The Rokk]] in [[Lower City]] has asked you to cook up some Kaliri Stew using his cooking pot. Return to him when it's done.
*[[Kaliri Stew]]
*[[Cooking Pot (Kaliri Stew)]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm providing the catering for some unusual party guests tonight. One of these fellows was flying around in [[Skettis]] and got knocked to the ground by a [[Monstrous Kaliri|monstrous kaliri]]--his leg was broken badly.

They've requested something special for his get well party: Kaliri Stew.

I can loan you my cooking pot so you can whip up a batch of stew for me. The recipe itself is simple, but you'll need to get a [[Giant Kaliri Wing|giant kaliri wing]] and some cooked [[Warp Burger|warp burgers]].

==Rewards==
You will receive {{cost|7|59|}}.<br>
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Barrel of Fish|Crate of Meat}}

==Progress==
Do I smell something tasty?

==Completion==
Oh, I do smell something tasty! I hope you gave that bird quite a beating.

Please, help yourself to some of my extra stock. I'm sure someone of your talent could put it to good use.

==Notes==
You might want to pick up the [[Fires Over Skettis]] daily quest while you are doing this daily cooking quest, as it is in the same general area.

Use the [[Cooking Pot (Kaliri Stew)]] at a cooking fire with a [[Giant Kaliri Wing]] and three [[Warp Burger]].
*[[Giant Kaliri Wing]]s only drop from [[Monstrous Kaliri]] found in [[Skettis]].
*[[Warp Burger]]s are made from [[Warped Flesh]] which drop from [[Warp Stalker]]s, [[Warp Hunter]]s, [[Warp Chaser]]s and [[Blackwind Warp Chaser]]s found in [[Terokkar Forest]], [[Skettis]] and [[Netherstorm]].

==Trivia==
*Revenge is Tasty is [[Revenge Is Tasty|a Common Quest card]] in the [[World of Warcraft: Trading Card Game]]'s [[Drums of War (TCG)|Drums of War]] set.
