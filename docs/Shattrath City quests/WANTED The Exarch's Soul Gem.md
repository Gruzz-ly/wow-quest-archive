'''WANTED: The Exarch's Soul Gem''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

== Objectives ==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] has asked you to recover [[The Exarch's Soul Gem]].  Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[The Exarch's Soul Gem]]

== Description ==
Within [[Auchindoun]]'s [[Auchenai Crypts]] many unsavory experiments are undertaken in the pursuit of a greater understanding of the necromantic arts. Many are the spirits that are tortured or destroyed therein.

I have a customer who is interested in the liberation of one of those spirits. I have been informed that this spirit is contained within a soul gem held by none other than [[Exarch Maladaar]] himself.

Seek him out within the crypts with all due haste and return to me with the gem.

== Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]
* +350 reputation with the [[Consortium]]

== Progress ==
Can you imagine being trapped within a gem for all eternity?

== Completion ==
You're quite the hero, <name>. I am certain that my customer will find a way to free the spirit of their loved one from within the gem. For a job well done, your payment awaits.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Auchenai Crypts]].  It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.
