'''WANTED: Nazan's Riding Crop''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Objectives==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] has asked you to obtain [[Nazan]]'s Riding Crop. Deliver it to him in [[Shattrath]]'s [[Lower City]] to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[Nazan's Riding Crop]]

==Description==
Today I have a buyer who is interested in a piece that's held by the mount of [[Illidan]]'s [[herald]].  I, of course, speak of [[Vazruden the Herald]] and his dragon mount, [[Nazan]].

If you want the finder's fee that I offer in return, find them flying above the [[Hellfire Ramparts|Ramparts]] at [[Hellfire Citadel]] and return with the dragon's riding crop.

My sources tell me that the item in question is personally held by the dragon.  It is said Nazan refuses to allow Vazruden to strike him with it.

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with the [[Consortium]]
* +350 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]/[[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
The riding crop please.

==Completion==
Another soon-to-be satisfied customer. It looks like it's in fine condition. You are to be rewarded.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Hellfire Ramparts]] and defeating [[Vazruden]]/[[Nazan]]. It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Added.}}
