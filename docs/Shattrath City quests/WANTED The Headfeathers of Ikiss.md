'''WANTED: The Headfeathers of Ikiss''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Objectives==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] has asked you to acquire [[The Headfeathers of Ikiss]]. Deliver them to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[The Headfeathers of Ikiss]]

==Description==
I've recently been approached by a [[tauren]] whose husband is about to be elevated to chieftain.  She wishes to make a special addition to his headdress.

Specifically, she wants to obtain the headfeathers from the dastardly [[Talon King Ikiss]].

If you are interested in collecting my reward, travel to [[Auchindoun]]'s [[Sethekk Halls]] and find him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with the [[Consortium]]
* +350 reputation with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
The time of the chieftain's ceremony grows near.

==Completion==
I am sure that these feathers will make a fine addition to the chieftain's headdress. You have earned your compensation, <class>.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Sethekk Halls]].  It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Added.}}
