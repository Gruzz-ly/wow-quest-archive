*{{NPC||Millhouse Manastorm}} Rescued

== Description ==
Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the [[naaru]].

In our travels we have encountered many dangerous beings. Some of these beings we incarcerated and placed in what is now known as the Arcatraz of Tempest Keep.

There is one prisoner, however, that is a victim of circumstance. A stowaway who was in the wrong naaru vessel at the wrong time.

Venture to the Arcatraz and rescue the gnome, Millhouse Manastorm. Ensure his survival.

== Progress ==
<A'dal greets you.>

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>. You have passed the trial of tenacity.

== Notes ==
In order to enter Tempest Keep on [[Heroic mode]], the [[Warpforged Key]] must be obtained; it is available to players who have reached {{reputation|Honored}} reputation with the [[Sha'tar]].
