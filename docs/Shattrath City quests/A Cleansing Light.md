==Objectives==
Bring a Fel Armament to [[Ishanah]] in [[Shattrath]] City.

Completing quests for the [[Aldor]] will cause your [[Scryers]] reputation to decrease.
*[[Fel Armament]]

==Description==
This temple is one of the holiest places in all of [[Outland]]. The power of the [[Light]] here is so strong, that even items with the strongest [[fel]] taint can be cleansed of a worldly item.

Should you run into any fel armaments in your confrontations with demonic enemies, bring them to me and I will demonstrate the cleansing power of the Light.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*15800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|48|}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-385 reputation with [[The Scryers]]
*[[Holy Dust]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained any fel armaments yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Watch as foul materials disintegrate.  Watch as metal turns to dust.

The Light cleanses all and only the purest residue remains.
