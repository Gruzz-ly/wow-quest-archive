==Objectives==
Recover a Cardinal Stone Core, a Cardinal Earth Core, and a Cardinal Lava Core for [[Lunelli]]. Bring them back to her in [[Shattrath]] when you have all three.
* [[Cardinal Stone Core]]
* [[Cardinal Earth Core]]
* [[Cardinal Lava Core]]

==Description==
From the earth comes strength, and such strength can be imbued into weapons of power.

You have the look of one who seeks to know how to create such weapons.

There are creatures that still inhabit [[Outland|this dying planet]] who bear such strength. Bring me their cores and I shall trade you the knowledge you seek.

==Progress==
There are also those who use such cores for more than mere forging. Be weary of such beings.

==Completion==
It would appear the earth trembled at YOUR power instead. Well done, champion.

As we agreed, here are your prizes in exchange for the cores.

==Rewards==
*[[Plans: Stoneforged Claymore]]
*[[Plans: Great Earthforged Hammer]]
*[[Plans: Lavaforged Warhammer]]

==Gains==
* 1,010 [[XP]]

==Notes==
*Cardinal Stone Core drops from [[Dampscale Patriarch]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*Cardinal Earth Core from [[Terra'gul]] in [[Nagrand]].
*Cardinal Lava Core from [[Geo-Lord Garug]] in [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
