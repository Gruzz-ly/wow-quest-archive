==Objectives==
Recover a Cardinal Sky Core, a Cardinal Storm Core, and a Cardinal Wind Core for [[Lunelli]]. Bring them back to her in [[Shattrath]] when you have all three.
* [[Cardinal Sky Core]]
* [[Cardinal Storm Core]]
* [[Cardinal Wind Core]]

==Description==
Ancient weapons require ancient offerings to regain the knowledge on how to construct them.

If you wish to learn how weapons forged from air are crafted, then you must first battle with beings born from it.

Bring me their cores and I will gift you the knowledge you seek.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Plans: Windforged Rapier
|Plans: Stormforged Axe
|Plans: Skyforged Great Axe
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,010 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be mindful of their attacks, for with air, you never know it's there until you feel it move across your skin.

==Completion==
I smell the air about you and see that you have returned triumphant.

Here is the knowledge that you seek.

==Notes==
*Cardinal Sky Core drops from [[Kal'okkar]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*Cardinal Storm Core drops from [[Ohme]] in [[Nagrand]].
*Cardinal Wind Core drops from [[Scalewing Queen]] in [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
