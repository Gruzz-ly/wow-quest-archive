==Objectives==
[[Ezekiel]] said the book has been stolen. Your best bet is to find the Ruffians and see if they have any information.
*Beat Down "Dirty" Larry and Get Information
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
Ramdor? Hrm, let me think... Ramdor... Oh yes, the death priest. What does he want with the book? Well it doesn't matter. Yes I lied to you and no I don't have the book. Not anymore, anyway. It was stolen. Probably by one of those filthy refugees.

Besides, [[Auchindoun]] is now defunct. We have no use for the book. If you find it, you can keep it.

Like I said, I saw some of those ruffians snooping around the terrace last week. Start your search with them. They're probably playing dice in the slums.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Progress==
Whaddya what?

==Completion==
Ok, ok! Don't hurt us. We had the book but we sold it...

==Notes==
You can find [["Dirty" Larry]] in the Lower part of [[Shattrath City]]. Travel as far as you can to the most Northwestern corner. [["Epic" Malone]] and another ruffian are with him and aggro when the fight begins.. If you don't want to solo this just sit there a moment, most likely someone else will be strolling up to do the same quest sooner or later.

;Gossip
Beat it, kid.  I got business to attend to...
