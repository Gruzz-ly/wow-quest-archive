==Objectives==
Speak with [[Exarch Orelis]] at [[Area 52]].

==Description==
Not long ago, [[Ishanah|High Priestess Ishanah]] sent a small group of anchorites to [[Netherstorm]], under the command of Exarch Orelis. They were to investigate the activities of [[Kael'thas]] and his minions, but we haven't received any reports of their findings yet.

I worry that our presence in the area might not be strong enough to carry out the mission. I'm certain that the exarch could benefit from your knowledge and experience. Are you willing to travel to Area 52 and assist him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or a 69 compensation at level 70)
*+10 [[reputation]] with The [[Aldor]]
*-11 reputation with The [[Scryers]]

==Completion==
So you're here to help us determine exactly what Kael'thas is planning? Your help is most welcome. [[Netherstorm]] is crawling with [[blood elf]] agents whose activities threaten to tear the land asunder.
