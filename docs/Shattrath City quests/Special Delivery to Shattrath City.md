==Objectives==
Deliver the Ata'mal Crystal to [[A'dal]] on the Terrace of Light in [[Shattrath City]].
*[[Ata'mal Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
I am an ethereal of my word, <name>. You have truly inspired me.

I am now going to give you the ata'mal crystal to hand over to the naaru. As it was your heroics that made this possible, I wish for you to deliver it.

You may use my personal teleporter to go directly to [[Shattrath City]]. Simply step through it and you will be transported there.

Give the crystal to the naaru known as [[A'dal]] on the Terrace of Light. May the trade winds be at your back.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
*19000 [[XP]]
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Progress==
<The musical tinkling of the naaru's speech fills your mind.>

I sense that you have something of great power with you, <race>. What is it that you bring to me?

==Completion==
You have recovered Spirit's Song! It is the ata'mal crystal that Prophet Velen left behind with his people for safekeeping before he went upon his ill-fated mission to the [[Exodar]].

Odd that he did not foresee it falling into the hands of the Burning Legion, if even for a short time.

Or, perhaps he did? It may be that he foresaw all of this, and left it there so that you would retrieve the crystal and deliver it to me here?

I sense that is the truth of it. You are a great hero of your people, <name>!
