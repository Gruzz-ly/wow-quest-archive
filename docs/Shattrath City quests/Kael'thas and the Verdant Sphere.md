'''Kael'thas and the Verdant Sphere''' is a quest which begins from the item [[Verdant Sphere]] dropped by [[Kael'thas Sunstrider (tactics)|Kael'thas Sunstrider]].

==Objectives==
Take the Verdant Sphere to {{NPC|Neutral|A'dal}} in [[Shattrath City]].
* [[Verdant Sphere]] (provided)

==Description==
The air around you hums - a gentle hum. The [[naaru]] are aware of your victory. Perhaps they are the reason you were compelled to pick up this sphere from the still-twitching remains of [[Kael'thas Sunstrider (tactics)|Kael'thas Sunstrider]]. What secrets could it hold?

Perhaps A'dal in Shattrath City could make sense of the item.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Lord Sanguinar's Claim
|Telonicus' Pendant of Mayhem
|The Darkener's Grasp
|The Sun King's Talisman
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|31|50}}
* 6,200 [[XP]]
* +1000 reputation with [[Sha'tar]]

==Progress==
You heard my call? Yes...

==Completion==
<A'dal's thoughts intermingle with your own.>

The sphere... Strange. Did you know that he lived? Yes. It is here - in the sphere itself. Maimed for certain. He calls to a higher power now. No, not [[Illidan]].

Higher.

[[Kil'jaeden the Deceiver]] comes...

Not here...

<A'dal points your mind elsewhere.>

[[Azeroth]]. Unknown.

Rest. Your brothers and sisters will retake [[Tempest Keep]] now.

<A'dal hums a song of battle.>

==Notes==

Upon completing the quest, the following appears to everyone in Shattrath City.

:{{text|yell|Kael'thas Sunstrider|Your monkeys failed to finish the job, naaru.  Beaten but alive...  The same mistake was not made when we took command of your vessel.}}
:{{text|yell|Kael'thas Sunstrider|All for what?  Trinkets?  You are too late.  The preparations have already begun. Soon the master will make his return.}}
:{{text|yell|Kael'thas Sunstrider|And there is nothing you or that fool, Illidan, can do to stop me!  You have both served me in your own right - unwittingly.}}
:''Kael'thas laughs.''
:{{text|yell|Kael'thas Sunstrider|Lay down your arms and succumb to the might of [[Kil'jaeden]]!}}
