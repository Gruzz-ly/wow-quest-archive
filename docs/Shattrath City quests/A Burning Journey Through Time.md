==Objectives==
Defeat 5 Timewalking dungeons.
* [[Timewalking]] [[dungeon]]s defeated (5)

==Description==
The blazing star shines upon the land, searing the earth and parching the landscape. This star is relentless, malevolent almost. While its influence holds, new paths may open up, to distant places and even distant times. No [[sage]] truly understands the nature of this sign, but fortune favors the daring.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Timely Goodie Bag]]

==Progress==
I foresee that you will follow the blazing star and walk the paths it reveals.

==Completion==
Ah, <name>, you have returned. An otherworldly air hangs heavy about you.
