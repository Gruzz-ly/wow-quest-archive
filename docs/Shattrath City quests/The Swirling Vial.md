==Objectives==
Bring the [[Swirling Timewarped Vial]] to the central dome in [[Shattrath City|Shattrath]].

==Description==
As you touch the vial, your mind is flooded with memories, not all of which are your own. The most vivid is a memory of exchanging a similar vial with someone in Shattrath, with [[A'dal]]'s light shining behind you. Despite your best efforts however, you can't pinpoint when that might have been - maybe it hasn't been, and is yet to be?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|15|40}}, 500x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Completion==
Oh, interesting!

<Cupri quickly grabs the vial and studies it intensely.>  

Perhaps [[Zephyr|Zeph]] was right to keep investigating here. This vial certainly didn't originate from any currently known timeline. Most curious! Thank you for bringing it to me. Or did you already bring it once before?
