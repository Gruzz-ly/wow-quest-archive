'''WANTED: Keli'dan's Feathered Stave''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Objectives==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] has asked you to obtain Keli'dan's Feathered Stave.  Deliver it to him in [[Shattrath]]'s [[Lower City]] to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on [[Heroic]] difficulty.
* [[Keli'dan's Feathered Stave]]

==Description==
There is no accounting for taste.  Take my most recent buyer for instance.

There is a blood orc within [[Hellfire Citadel]] known as [[Keli'dan the Breaker]].  He bears a most mundane stave; certainly nothing to take a second glance at.  And yet, this is what my customer wishes.

Who am I to say no?

If you desire my compensation, you will find him and his stave within the [[Blood Furnace]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with the [[Consortium]]
* +350 reputation with [[Honor Hold]]/[[Thrallmar]]

==Progress==
We are speaking again... you must have the stave.

==Completion==
Perhaps I will have new feathers tied onto it before shipping it on to the buyer.  I'm certain with so many [[Skettis Exiles|arakkoa]] hereabouts it will not prove difficult.  A small matter, and nothing to detract from your reward in any case.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Blood Furnace]].  It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Added.}}
