== Objectives ==
[[Magistrix Fyalenn]] in [[Shattrath City]] wants you to bring her 10 Firewing Signets.

Performing quests for the [[Scryers]] will cause your [[Aldor]] reputation level to decrease.
*[[Firewing Signet]] (10)

== Description ==
It is no secret that [[Kael'thas Sunstrider]] perceives us as a great threat. Let's face it - not many [[sin'dorei]], fresh from [[Silvermoon]], are willing to join the sort of company that Kael keeps.

It's also no secret that this is not just a war of words. Scryers and the armies that serve Kael'thas attack each other on sight. The only way to prove you're with us, <name>, is to do your share of fighting.

Kael's lower ranking followers wear Firewing signets to indicate their rank. Bring them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at level 70)
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+250 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

== Progress ==
Go on, <name>.  Speak.

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>.  You might prove to be a useful ally after all.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
