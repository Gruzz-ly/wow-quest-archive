By now it should be clear to you why we oppose the Burning Legion and those who serve them.

If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of high-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers. The highest-ranking Legion can be found in [[Netherstorm]] and [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]

== Progress ==
Do you bear any of our enemies' insignias, <name>?

== Completion ==
Facing the demons of the Burning Legion and the mad cultists that worship them is no small feat, <name>. &nbsp;You've shown great dedication and courage. &nbsp;Keep it up and your renown among the Aldor will continue to grow.
