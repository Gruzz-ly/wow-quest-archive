'''WANTED: The Epoch Hunter's Head''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

== Objectives ==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] has asked you to obtain the [[Epoch Hunter's Head]].  Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[Epoch Hunter's Head]]

== Description ==
The tastes of my customers range from the mundane to the exotic.  And sometimes they want to do very mundane things with the exotic objects they seek.

Such is the case with my latest request.  My client, who shall remain nameless, wishes to obtain the head of the [[Epoch Hunter]] to mount on his wall.

<Class>, will you find a way to travel back in time to [[Escape from Durnholde Keep|Old Hillsbrad]] and procure said head for my trophy-hunting patron?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with the [[Keepers of Time]]
* +350 reputation with the [[Consortium]]

== Progress ==
The head of the Epoch Hunter... how does one come to the decision that they want it mounted on their wall?

And even then, to not hunt the beast yourself, what does one say to their friends when asked how the fight went?

He'll lie, I suppose.

== Completion ==
I see you are returned to the present time intact.

<The wind trader looks around.>

It doesn't appear that anything has changed.  But then again, how would I know?

That's a nice cut; my customer will be pleased.  Here is your reward.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

== Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Escape from Durnholde Keep]].  It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
* {{Patch 4.0.1|note=[[Badge of Justice]] removed from game. Heroic dailies now reward 10 [[Justice Points]].}}
* {{Patch 2.4.0|note=Added.}}
