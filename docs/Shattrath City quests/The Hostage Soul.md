==Objectives==
Travel to [[Shattrath City]] to tell [[A'dal]] about [[Akama]]'s request.

==Description==
You might wonder why I go to such lengths to hide my intentions. Why not throw my lot in openly with the [[naaru]]?

My very essence - my soul - is held prisoner inside the [[Black Temple]]. [[Illidan]] could destroy me any moment... until now! This phylactery will allow me to regain control of my soul.

The time has come, <name>. I'll lead [[Maiev]] and [[Ashtongue Deathsworn|my Deathsworn]] to Illidan's doorstep.

Speak to A'dal and and{{sic}} tell him of our plan. If we strike together we'll break through Illidan's defenses.

==Completion==
<A'dal's light surrounds you as he welcomes you back.  You have a feeling he knows what you're about to ask of him.>

==Progression==
{{The Fall of the Betrayer}}
