Bring Stonegazer's Blood to [[Sha'nir]] in [[Shattrath City]].

Completing quests for the [[Aldor]] will cause your [[Scryers]] reputation level to decrease.
*[[Stonegazer's Blood]]
*Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
[[File:Stonegazer picture.jpg|thumb|The basilisk Stonegazer]]
The woman to my right suffered a severe injury to the head. She survived, but lost her eyesight.

A traditional cure used among my people requires the blood of a very old [[basilisk]].

Unfortunately, due to poaching from various groups, [[Terokkar]] basilisks don't tend to live very long.

There is one basilisk whose name I've known since I was a youngling. It is known only as "[[Stonegazer]]" and it's rumored to live east of here, near the land's edge.

Bring me its blood so that [[Zahlia]] may see once again.

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*{{cost|6|20}}
*13350 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|g=6|s=42}} as compensation at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with the [[Aldor]]
*-385 reputation with the [[Scryers]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the blood, <name>?  Without it, Zahlia may never see her son again.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.  Caring for those in need is a difficult task, but in time I've discovered that it is its own reward.

==Notes==
Just walk along the coast near [[Firewing Point]] and you will find him.
