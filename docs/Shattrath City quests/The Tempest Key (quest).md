This quest opens up after completing [[the Cipher of Damnation quest chain]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]]. You will receive the [[Letter from Shattrath]] from [[Khadgar]] upon the completion of [[The Cipher of Damnation (quest)]], asking you to seek him out.

==Objectives==
Speak to A'dal in Shattrath City.

==Description==
You have proven yourself capable of great feats, <name>. Your discovery of the Cipher of Damnation and Kael'Thas' involvement is most important to our cause. Should Kael use the cipher, what little is left of this world may collapse.

A'dal is convinced that Kael must be stopped and now seeks adventurers willing to undergo trials. Those that prove their strength will be granted the Tempest Key.

<Khadgar nods.>

The naaru's key to the vessel.

A'dal awaits...

==Completion==
Tempest Keep is a naaru creation, mortal. Access to the vessel has always been within our power to grant. A return to Tempest Keep, though, had been deemed unnecessary. A point of pride for a mortal race, perhaps, but naaru invest little in such things.

We go now because we must. Kael'Thas cannot be allowed to utter the words of damnation.

==Progression==
