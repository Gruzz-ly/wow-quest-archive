==Objectives==
Collect 6 Prairie Wolf Paws and 4 Plainstrider Talons.
* [[Prairie Wolf Paw]] (6)
* [[Plainstrider Talon]] (4)

==Description==
Our sacred wells have been tainted, and I will need your help to fix this.

To cleanse each well, I must create a cleansing totem, then you must bring the totem to the well and perform a cleansing ritual.

First we will create a cleansing totem for the [[Winterhoof Water Well]]. To do this, the land must offer its aid. Hunt [[Prairie Wolf|prairie wolves]] for their paws and [[Adult Plainstrider|adult plainstriders]] for their talons. They are to the southwest.

Return to me with the paws and talons, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*80 - 9,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Do you have the paws and talons, <name>?

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>. I will take these and bind their power into a totem of cleansing.
