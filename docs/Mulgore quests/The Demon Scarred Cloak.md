Find someone who knows of Ghost Howl. 
*[[Demon Scarred Cloak]]

==  Reward ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Skorn's Hammer|Skorn's Rifle}}

==  Completion ==
I can barely believe my old eyes! &nbsp;You defeated the great wolf Ghost Howl? &nbsp;I look upon you with new respect, young &lt;class&gt;. &nbsp;You are a hunter of extreme skills!

Let me offer you something. &nbsp;My days of hunting are over, but I would be honored if you used one of my weapons in your hunts.

May it strike true, and bring you renown.

And let us hope that Ghost Howl's spirit has finally found peace.
