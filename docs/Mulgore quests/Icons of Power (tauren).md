==Objectives==
Recover the lost icon from the [[Bristleback Shaman]]s in [[Brambleblade Ravine]]. Learn its power, then report back to [[Harutt Thunderhorn]] in [[Camp Narache]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Chest - [[Overload]]

==Description==
[[Shamanism]] is an ancient practice, <name>. Many artifacts, full of spiritual energy, can be found across [[Azeroth]]. I had recently discovered an icon of notable power myself, but it was stolen by the [[quilboar]].

Go to their territory, to the east, and find the stolen icon. It is likely being carried by one of their own shamans attempting to understand its secrets.

Once you find the icon, learn its power and return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*90 [[XP]]
*[[Cracked Leather Vest]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Have you found the icon, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout Azeroth. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.
