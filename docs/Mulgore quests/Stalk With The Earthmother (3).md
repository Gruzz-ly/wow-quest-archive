==Objectives==
Buy or catch a [[:Raw Brilliant Smallfish]], then use the Knife Set to fillet it in front of [[Boarton Shadetotem]] in [[Thunder Bluff]].
*[[Fish Chunks]]
*[[Knife Set]] (provided)

==Description==
I have one last idea that may lead us to success. I still feel there is hidden talent in you, but let us try and coax it out with a less direct approach.

Go and procure a Raw Brilliant Smallfish, then bring it back here. Use these daggers to clean and fillet it. Do not think too hard - do what comes naturally.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*[[Dual wield]]
*Engrave Gloves - [[Lava Lash (shaman rune)]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for me?

==Completion==
That was quite a display, shaman.  Not the [[rogue]]ish precision I hoped for, but you possess an impressive ambidexterity.

I see now that you will not be the one to train my people in the subtle arts, but there is one thing I can teach you.  Good luck on your travels, shaman.  The Horde will need heroes like you.
