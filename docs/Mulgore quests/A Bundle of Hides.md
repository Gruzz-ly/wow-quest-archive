==Objectives==
Bring the Bundle of Hides to the wind rider master [[Tak]] in [[Bloodhoof Village]].
* [[Bundle of Hides]] (provided)

==Description==
I have a bundle of hides from the animals of [[Mulgore]], and must get them to [[Thunder Bluff]]. A colleague there, [[Ahanu]], will use the hides to create leather goods.

Will you take the hides to him for me?

The quickest way to Thunder Bluff is on the back of a wind rider. Bring the bundle of hides to Tak, our wind rider master in Bloodhoof Village, and speak to him about transport to Thunder Bluff.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*50 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Are you here for a wind rider? You have something to transport?

==Completion==
If you must take these hides to Thunder Bluff, then you have come to the right place.

*This quest is [[Tauren]] only.
