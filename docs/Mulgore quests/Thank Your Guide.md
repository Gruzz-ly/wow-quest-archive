The balance has been restored, and [[Thunder Bluff]] is safe. Thank you.

We owe our victory to your spirit's guidance. We must honor the old ways by giving thanks to the ones who came before us.

To the southwest lies a beautiful vista where [[Cairne Bloodhoof|my father]] once took me. It would be a fitting place to reflect upon all that has transpired.

Please take this offering there to honor our ancestors.

On accept, Baine Bloodhoof walks out of his tent.
