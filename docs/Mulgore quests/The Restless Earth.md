==Objectives==
Use the Drums of the Soothed Earth to calm 6 [[Agitated Earth Spirit]]s.
* Spirits Calmed (6)
* [[Drum of the Soothed Earth]] (provided)

==Description==
Until recently, a group of [[Dwarf|dwarves]] intruded on our lands to the west, carving the earth apart senselessly to search for treasure. When the very earth itself tore apart, the spirits of the land they had abused rose up and took their revenge.

The agitated earth spirits still roam the [[Bael'dun Digsite|former dig site]], <name>. We must offer them appeasement.

Take this drum with you to the west and play to the spirits. The rhythm may calm their fury and confusion.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chestguard of the Beating Drum
|Restless Gloves
|Worn Ceremonial Tomahawk}}
You will also receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Progress==
Is the land satisfied?

==Completion==
The land is clearly still in great upheaval if it took such effort to calm.

Remember this, <name>. Do not forget seeing the fate of those who would scar the Earth Mother.
