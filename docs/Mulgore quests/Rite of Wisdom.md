Travel to [[Red Rocks]] east of [[Thunder Bluff]] and speak with the [[Ancestral Spirit (NPC)|Ancestral Spirit]]. 

==Description==
To gain acceptance amongst the elders of Thunder Bluff you must next complete the Rite of Wisdom.

Now that you have passed the Rite of Vision, the ancestral spirits of Red Rocks will give you the blessing of our ancestors. Only those who have drunk from the Water of Seers can gain the blessing.

Travel east of Thunder Bluff, to Red Rocks and seek out the Ancestral Spirit, <name>. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Completion==
You have shown great diligence in your yearning to pass the Rites of the Earthmother, <name>.

We, the Ancestral Spirits, represent the mighty tauren who gave their lives bravely to found and protect our great city of Thunder Bluff. I hereby pass the duty of that protection over to you.

==Notes==
*Red Rocks is in the mountains directly east from Thunder Bluff. The Ancestral Spirit is in an old [[Tauren]] graveyard. The graveyard is guarded by [[gnoll]]s. 
*This quest previously was in the middle of a chain, but is now a dead end. A new version of the previous follow-up, [[Journey into Thunder Bluff]], is now part of the Grimtotem questline.
