==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Supervisor Fizsprocket.jpg|Supervisor Fizsprocket|Get his clipboard.}}
Kill [[Supervisor Fizsprocket]] and collect Fizsprocket's Clipboard.
* [[Fizsprocket's Clipboard]]

==Description==
According to the documents you salvaged from the caravan, the [[Venture Co.]] created many plans to attempt to drive us from our lands here, so that they could have free reign to plunder our lands.

The depths that they would sink to accomplish their goals disgusts and appalls me. I want the mastermind behind their plans killed. His name is Supervisor Fizsprocket, you will find him at the [[Venture Co. Mine|Venture Co. mine]] east of the ravaged caravan. Bring me his clipboard, we shall see if we find out anything useful.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Trackless Sandals
|Goblin Masher
|Trackless Boots
}}

You will also receive: {{cost||4|50}}

==Progress==
I seethe with anger at the thought of the atrocities the Venture Co. is willing to perpetrate against us in the name of profit.

==Completion==
My anger is somewhat lessened at the news that the villain Fizsprocket is dead. I will go through his personal effects and see if there is any additional information about what the Venture Co. has planned for the future. Thank you for your efforts, <name>.

==Notes==
This quest should be done at the same time as [[The Venture Co.]].
