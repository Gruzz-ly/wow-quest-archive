==Objectives==
Collect 6 Azure Feathers and 6 Bronze Feathers.
* [[Azure Feather]] (6)
* [[Bronze Feather]] (6)

==Description==
<name>, [[Ruul Eagletalon|my brother]] soon stands before [[Baine Bloodhoof|Chief Bloodhoof]], and it is my honor to make his headdress for him.

I want to ask a favor of you while I finish tanning these leather straps. There is not time for me to find enough feathers, and I was wondering, would you gather more for me?

You can find feathers of the correct size from the harpies residing far to the north and northwest of [[Thunder Bluff]]. I need only 6 azure and 6 bronze feathers to complete the design.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:

* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
This headdress will certainly be a wonderful gift for my brother.

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>.

My part in my brother's ceremony is almost complete. Giving him his headdress and witnessing the ceremony are all my duty requires of me.
