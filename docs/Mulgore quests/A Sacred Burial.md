==Objectives==
Lorekeeper Raintotem wants you to kill 8 Bristleback Interlopers at Red Rocks. 
*[[Bristleback Interloper]] slain (8)

==Description==
Only the most valiant tauren are laid to rest at Red Rocks, our sacred burial ground. It is an honor bestowed upon the great warriors who helped found and defend [[Thunder Bluff]] and those who have given their lives for the greater good of their tribes and chieftains.

But it appears a foul menace has made its way onto our holy land. A band of Bristleback Interlopers is ravaging the grave site and I am too old and past my prime to drive them away.

They must be driven off with force, <name>.

==Rewards==

* 150 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
The Bristleback Interlopers must be driven away from our sacred burial ground, <name>.

==Completion==
Well done. You have sent those foul Bristlebacks a clear message. They will think twice before attempting to meddle in this holy spot again.
