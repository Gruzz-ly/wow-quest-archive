==Objectives==
Buy a wind rider to [[Thunder Bluff]] from the [[wind rider master]] [[Tak]], then bring the Bundle of Hides to [[Ahanu]] in Thunder Bluff.
* [[Bundle of Hides]] (provided)

==Description==
For a small fee, I will give you a [[wind rider]] to Thunder Bluff. There's no faster way to the city!

If that is acceptable, speak to me again when you are ready to go.

If you're taking those hides to Ahanu, then I think he's at [[Hewa's Armory]], at the base of the wind rider tower in Thunder Bluff. And that's right where you'll land!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 100 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
There is dust on your shoulders that must be from [[Mulgore]]. You have spoken with my friend [[Varg Windwhisper|Varg]]?

==Completion==
Ah, a new bundle of hides. I will get to work on these immediately!

Thank you, <sister/brother>. You have done me a great service. Here are some coins to pay for your time and travel costs.
