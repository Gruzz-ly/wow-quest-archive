==Objectives==
Recover the lost rune from [[Brambleblade Ravine]]. Use the rune to learn a new ability, then report back to [[Harutt Thunderhorn]] in [[Camp Narache]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Victory Rush (warrior rune)]]

==Description==
The [[warrior]]s of the [[Horde]] have much to teach you, <name>, but you must also seek out new techniques on your own.

As you may know, there is a group of hostile [[quilboar]]s to the east. Another fledgling warrior ventured into their territory some time ago, and never returned. He was experimenting with engraving mystical runes onto his equipment to improve his combat prowess.

Find the rune among the quilboar and learn this technique yourself. Return to me when you have done so.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]
*[[Tarnished Chain Gloves]]

==Progress==
Have you found the rune, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout [[Azeroth]]. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.
