== Objectives ==
Kill 7 Venture Co. Workers for [[Morin Cloudstalker]] at [[Bloodhoof Village]].
* [[Venture Co. Worker]] slain (7)

== Description ==
This explains the buildup of Venture Co. employees and equipment we've seen in [[Mulgore]]. Those [[goblin]]s... their company is expanding too quickly for their own good. It's how they say, show a goblin something, and you can hear the scales in the background.

Greedy little things, they are. Unfortunately for their business enterprise, we [[tauren]] cannot allow them to conduct their operations in our lands. Go to their mine northeast of the ravaged caravan and send them a message.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

== Progress ==
The Venture Co. was refused mining rights here in Mulgore, but it would seem that they do not take no for an answer. We tauren are not ones to mince words, however, and we have other ways of getting our message across.

== Completion ==
I don't think there could be too much misinterpreting or ignoring of that signal, hm? The Venture Co. will know not to take the tauren lightly, or to be so arrogant as to believe we would allow them to steal the natural resources around us without protest.

==Notes==
This quest should be done at the same time as [[Supervisor Fizsprocket (quest)]].
