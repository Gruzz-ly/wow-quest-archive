== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Stalker Claws and 6 Cougar Claws.
* [[Stalker Claws]] (6)
* [[Cougar Claws]] (6)

== Description ==
There is more work to be done. We must create a new totem to cleanse the [[Thunderhorn Water Well|Thunderhorn Well]].

You must gather the claws of the predators of the Mulgore plains. Hunt prairie stalkers for their stalker claws and flatland cougars for their cougar claws, then return to me.

You will find the prairie stalkers and flatland cougars to the east and west.

== Progress ==
<name>, do you have the claws I sent you to gather? The Thunderhorn Water Well grows more tainted with each passing hour!

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>. The purity with which these beasts hunt is vital in the creation of the next cleansing totem.

The Thunderhorn Well is a symbol of my own tribe, and to know it is being desecrated by our own kind raises a fury in me I haven't felt for years.

==Notes==
The quest [[Mazzranache (quest)]] should be done alongside this, as both require items dropped by Flatland Cougars.
