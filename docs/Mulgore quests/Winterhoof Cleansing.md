== Objectives ==
Use the Winterhoof Cleansing Totem at the [[Winterhoof Water Well]].
* Well Cleansed
*Return to [[Mull Thunderhorn]] at [[Bloodhoof Village]].
* [[Winterhoof Cleansing Totem]] (provided)

== Description ==
I have crafted the totem to cleanse the Winterhoof Water Well. Now, you must take it to the well and perform a cleansing ritual. The well is to the southeast, but be warned: whoever did this may still be there, laying in wait.

This may prove very dangerous, <name>. Be careful...but do not let the defilers of our well escape.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Legs of the Long Day
|Plains Hunter Guards}}

== Progress ==
Do not delay, <name>. The Winterhoof Well must be purified!

== Completion ==
The [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]]...

<Mull scowls.>

I'd hoped to see the end of my days before Tauren attacked other Tauren senselessly on the very plains of Mulgore. But be proud, <name>. You have done a great things for the lend, and for our people.
