== Objectives ==
Return the Venture Co. Documents to [[Morin Cloudstalker]] near [[Bloodhoof Village]].
*[[Venture Co. Documents]] (Provided)

== Description ==
Prying open the lid reveals a tightly packed assortment of ore and minerals, more evidence of the Venture Co.'s mining operation in Mulgore. On the top of the ore and minerals you remove a tightly bound sheaf of papers.

Up in the foothills to the east, you can barely hear the sounds of work, and see smoke rising from a large fire.

==Progress==
Hail, <name>. Have you learned anything new about the Venture Co.'s plans and operations in our homeland?

If they plan to exploit our lands as they have others, the [[Outrunner#Tauren Outrunners|Outrunners]] will be quick to put an end to it.

==Completion==
It does indeed appear that the [[Venture Co.]] is attempting to rob us of our natural resources. It is good to know this for true, and now it seems, we must do something about it.
