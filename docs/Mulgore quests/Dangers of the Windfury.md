== Objectives ==
Bring 8 [[Windfury Talon]]s to [[Ruul Eagletalon]] in [[Bloodhoof Village]].

== Description ==
Thank you for taking the time to speak to me, <name>. I am Ruul, warrior and teacher.

You have obviously reached an age when you must prepare for your trials if you are to adventure much further out of [[Mulgore]].

If you wish a test of your strength, start by seeking out the Windfury [[harpy|harpies]] to the southeast. They nestle along the mountain's edges away from the road.

They are one of our natural enemies here in Mulgore and will be a good gauge of your skill.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
The Windfuries are deadly foes. Their strength in battle is only rivaled by their desire for fresh meat.

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>. You seem well prepared to travel onward. Let the wind always be at your back.

==Progression==
