== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Baine Bloodhoof]] in [[Thunder Bluff]].

== Description ==
The wells are cleansed, and [[Mulgore]]'s waters run sweet and clear once more. You've saved us...but you've also uncovered grim happenings. The actions of the [[Grimtotem]] must be made known.

It is time for you to enter Thunder Bluff, our great city atop the mesa. Go to our leader, Baine Bloodhoof, son of Cairne. He must hear of this.

== Completion ==
Welcome to Thunder Bluff, <name>. You've done great things for our people.

Tell me of your journey.
