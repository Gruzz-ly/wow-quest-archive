== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Zarlman Two-Moons]] in [[Bloodhoof Village]].

== Description ==
I cannot thank you enough for cleansing my tribe's well, <name>, and for fighting the savage [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] to do it. But there is more to be done, and it is time for your journey to lead you beyond Bloodhoof Village.

Zarlman Two-Moons stands by the fire in the north end of the village. Go speak with him and learn of the next ritual you must undertake.

== Completion ==
I sensed you would be coming to me, <class>. I can always recognize one who is trying to pass the Rites of the Earthmother.
