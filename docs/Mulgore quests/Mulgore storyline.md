# Mulgore storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Mulgore.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]
'''[[Mulgore]]''' is a level 1—10 zone for [[Horde]] players. Players travel through the zone, battling the quilboar and completing the Rites of the Earthmother to become true tauren braves.

Unlike many other non-instanced starting areas (which, for the most part, can be done by any race), more than half of Mulgore storyline is only doable by tauren characters.

==Bloodhoof Village==
Picking up from [[Tauren starting experience]], in [[Bloodhoof Village]] there are numerous quests that players can complete to help the tauren of that village before beginning the main quest line for Mulgore. In this quest line the sacred wells of Mulgore have been poisoned by the nefarious [[Grimtotem]] tribe. Under the direction of [[Ahmo Thunderhorn]], players gather the necessary materials to create totems and then use those totems to cleanse the wells of the corruption - beating back the Grimtotem tauren who try to prevent that. After cleansing both the Winterhoof well and the Thunderhorn well, players are sent onward to Camp Sungraze via the Rite of Vision to cleanse the final well. A side quest line has players fighting against the Goblins of the Venture Co. who are trying to drive the tauren from the land so that they can use it for profit.

==Camp Sungraze==
Continuing with the main Mulgore quest line, players cleanse the final well - the Wildmane well - and then travel to Thunder Bluff to tell [[Baine Bloodhoof]] of what has transpired. Enraged, Baine orders all Grimtotem expelled from Mulgore and he personally slays [[Orno Grimtotem]], leader of the Grimtotem. There are a couple of other side quests in Camp Sungraze, including one which clears the quillboar out from the sacred Red Rocks burial ground. After completing all quests, players can complete the final Rite of the Earth Mother, the [[Rite of Wisdom]]. Finally the quest [[Walk With The Earth Mother]] brings players onwards to Orgrimmar.

After that, the player ends up right next to [[Gotura Fourwinds]], who sends the player to [[Northern Barrens]]. Alternatively, a quest the player might have picked up in Thunder Bluff leads to [[Silverpine Forest]]:
