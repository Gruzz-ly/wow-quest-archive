==Objectives==
Bring a Flatland Cougar Femur to [[Maur Raincaller]] at [[Bloodhoof Village]].
* [[Flatland Cougar Femur]]

==Description==
My grandfather told me stories about his battles with a strider named [[Mazzranache]]. He told me of its demonic red eyes, razor-sharp talons and venomous bite.

As fortune would have it, while traveling across the plains, I encountered it, and it took a nasty bite from my shoulder. He was as terrible as my grandfather described. I have gathered all the parts of the remedy I need to cure myself... except a flatland cougar femur.

I grow weaker by the moment... please, help me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Belt of the Prairie Wolf
|Cougar Pelt Wristwraps
|Swoopskin Gloves
|Prairie Wolf Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
My fever grows worse and I find my mind drifting into delirious nightmares... I should have known that I wouldn't be able to handle a beast my grandfather was unable to defeat...

Do you have the ingredients for the remedy? I fear if I do not clean the infection soon, it will be the death of me.

==Completion==
Ah, thank you, <name>. Using the items you brought me, I will be able to create the remedy I need to stop the spread of the infection and, eventually, cure it completely. I owe you my life in thanks.

But I'll never forget that screeching call when Mazzranache came upon me, the blaze of color as its beak descended...

Be wary on your travels.

==Notes==
If playing a tauren, the quest [[Thunderhorn Totem]] should be done at the same time, as both require items dropped by Flatland Cougars.

Prior to ''[[Cataclysm]]'', this quest was much more difficult, requiring the collection of four rare dropped items instead of one.
