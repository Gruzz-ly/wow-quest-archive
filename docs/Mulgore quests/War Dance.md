== Objectives ==
Defeat Orno Grimtotem at [[Stonetalon Pass (Mulgore)|Stonetalon Pass]].
* [[Orno Grimtotem]] slain

== Description ==
Some see our people as gentle giants, or noble savages. They have never seen us fight against our own kind...against betrayers from within.

The [[Grimtotem]] were offered mercy in exile, and they have scarred their own home to spite us. They will no longer be tolerated in [[Mulgore]].

I've already sent our warriors ahead to drive them out through Stonetalon Pass, to the north. You have fought bravely against the Grimtotem, <name>; I ask that you join the battle again. Go, and help deal this final blow.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dreamwalking Staff
|Kodo Mallet
|Stunted Tree Root
|Sunwalker's Stunner
|Kodo Gavel
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
*[[Kodo Saddlebag]]

== Progress ==
I do not plan on sitting idly in Thunder Bluff while our warriors risk their lives for our home, <name>. We shall meet on the battlefield. Strike out ahead of me; I will leave soon.

== Completion ==
Welcome back, <name>.

<Baine stares off a moment, centering himself.>

What was done was not for revenge, or pride. It was simply to protect Thunder Bluff, and all our people, from torment and fear. Today, Mulgore is safe once more.

The Earth Mother thanks you for all your brave deeds, <name>, as do I. You have earned your reward, hero. May you be welcome in Thunder Bluff always.

== Notes ==
Stonetalon Pass is northwest of Thunder Bluff, Orno Grimtotem can be found at the top. Shortly after engaging him in combat, Baine arrives.
