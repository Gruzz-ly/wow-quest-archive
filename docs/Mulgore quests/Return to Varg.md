==Objectives==
Buy a wind rider to [[Bloodhoof Village]] from the [[wind rider master]] [[Tal]], then bring Ahanu's Leather Goods to [[Varg Windwhisper]].
* [[Ahanu's Leather Goods]] (provided)

==Description==
In order to fly to a town, you must have already been there and spoken with the wind rider master of that town. You have been to the Bloodhoof Village and spoken to their wind rider master [[Tak]], so for a small fee you can take a wind rider to him from here.

Speak with me again when you are ready. Once at Bloodhoof Village, you can then deliver the leather goods to [[Varg Windwhisper]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Progress==
<name>, you are back from [[Thunder Bluff]]? Did you deliver the hides to [[Ahanu]]?

==Completion==
Ahanu sent me the finished products? Very good. There are many hunters and adventurers in Bloodhoof Village now and business is lively. I am sure I'll sell these goods very soon.

Thank you for all your efforts, <name>. I am in your debt.
