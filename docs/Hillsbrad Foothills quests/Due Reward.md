==Objectives==
Place [[Twinkles]]' favorite toy by his grave at the [[Sludge Fields]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].
* Honor Twinkles' memory {{co|38.7|60.0|Hillsbrad Foothills}}

==Description==
You have served me well these past few minutes we've spent together - minutes I shall not soon forget.

I believe a reward befitting your unwavering loyalty is in order. You will have the distinct honor of placing Twinkles' favorite toy by his grave in honor of his memory.

Please, please - save your thanks for Twinkles; it is not every day that we may honor a horse made of STARS.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|20|22|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Hopefully this is the last you see of [[Johnny Awesome]] and his menagerie.>

==Notes==

One of the fastest ways to get to Hillsbrad Foothills would be to use the [[Dalaran Crater]] portal back in Dalaran. Horde players could also use the [[Undercity]] portal in Dalaran.

At [[The Sludge Fields]] interact with [[Wilson (mount)|Wilson]].

After completing the quest, players will receive an in-game mail from the [[Postmaster]]:
{{Book|URGENT!!!|content=
<Name>,

In your absence, things at the [[Postmaster's Office|office]] have gone quite awry. There is mail everywhere - and I do mean everywhere!

[[Katy Stampwhistle|Katy]] and I will never sort all of this in a timely manner without your aid. I am afraid I must ask you to return to the office at once.

We have a job to do.

However, receiving the mail is not necessary, as the Postmaster immediately offers the next quest.
