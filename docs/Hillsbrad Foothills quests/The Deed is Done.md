This rogue-only quest is the seventh part of the chain to obtain the legendary dagger set [[Fangs of the Father]]. It is a simple travel quest directing the rogue back to [[Wrathion]]. It rewards the [[Jaws of Retribution]], the first of two dagger sets that will be upgraded during the questline, ultimately becoming the [[Fangs of the Father]].

== Objectives ==
Report your success to [[Prince Wrathion]] at [[Ravenholdt Manor]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].

== Description ==
Prince Wrathion will be pleased to hear that you've succeeded. You should report back to him at Ravenholdt Manor.

The Prince has been known to be extremely generous to those who help him.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|8|27}}
|Vengeance (dagger)
|Fear (dagger)}}

== Completion ==
That's wonderful news, <name>. [[Hiram Creed|Creed]] was not the most powerful of the remaining [[black dragon]]s, but his manipulation of the [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneans]] was truly diabolical.

I've prepared a reward for you. These blades may not look like much at present, but in the right hands they may yet awaken.

Perhaps in YOUR hands...

==Notes==
After turning in the quest:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Excellent work, friend. You've proven that a single skilled assassin can strike a decisive blow where a whole army may fail.}}
:{{text|say|Fahrad|Huh! A lucky blow, against an unprepared opponent.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|If you wish to continue our work, we will need some additional supplies.}}
