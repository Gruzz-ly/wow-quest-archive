==Description==
We must break the fingers of the [[Stormpike Guard|Stormpike]] if we are to stop their incursion.

<Cromush hands you a small package.>

Within this package are four high-yield goblin explosives. You are to infiltrate each of the four fingers - [[Sofera's Naze]], [[Corrahn's Dagger]], the [[Headland]] and [[Gavin's Naze]] - and plant a goblin pocket-nuke at each.

Once you have done that - as well as all that [[Melisara]] asks of you - return to me.
