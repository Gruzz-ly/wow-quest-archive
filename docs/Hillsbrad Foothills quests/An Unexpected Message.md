==Objectives==
Discover [[Archmage Modera]]'s message by using the Glowing Resonate Crystal.
* Discover the Crystal's Message
*Optional: Take Portal to Dalaran Crater
* Meet Archmage Modera in [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]]
*[[Glowing Resonate Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, [[:Felo'melorn]]. I am familiar with this weapon.

For ages the [[Council of Tirisfal]] attempted to recover the blade. Its control over the primal forces of fire would be devastating in the wrong hands.

As luck would have it, an associate of mine, Archmage Modera has recently uncovered some information on this artifact. This crystal contains a message from her.

I suggest you start your search there. The portal over there will bring you back to the city.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
* 1500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>, I'm glad you came.

I've found information on just the thing we need to turn this war in our favor.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Meryl Felstorm|Return here once you have retrieved the artifact, <name>. In the mean time, I'll see about tidying this place up a bit.}}
:''Meryl summons a number of enchanted brooms and other cleaning items.''

Use the quest item to summon an Image of Archmage Modera:
:{{text|say|Image of Archmage Modera|Greetings, <name>. I trust this projection is clear! This is Modera, Archmage of the [[Council of Six]]. I've come across a lead on a weapon that could significantly aid your fight against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].}}
:{{text|say|Image of Archmage Modera|My source is... well... unable to join us within the city. I ask that you meet with me at the [[Dalaran Crater|crater]] of [[Dalaran]]'s foundation in Hillsbrad.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Archmage Modera|Due to the sensitive nature of this matter, I must ask for your discretion. If you attempt to speak to me at any other location, I will disavow all knowledge of this message!}}
:{{text|say|Image of Archmage Modera|I await your arrival.}}

If the mage has not acquired the [[Ancient Tome of Teleport: Dalaran]] from [[Flameweaver Koegler]] in [[Scarlet Halls]], the quickest way to get there is to teleport to {{Alliance}} [[Ironforge]] / {{Horde}} [[Undercity]] and fly to Hillsbrad.

Another option existed before patch 8.1.5: Take the standing portal to return to Dalaran, then head to the center of the city (previously [[Runeweaver Square]]) and enter the new [[Chamber of the Guardian‎]]. In the center of the tower is a glowing blue pad. Step on it to enter the [[Portrait Room]] beneath the city. At the bottom, near a meeting stone, are portals to the [[Caverns of Time]], Outland's [[Shattrath]], [[Wyrmrest Temple]], [[Dalaran Crater]], and [[Karazhan]]. The Dalaran Crater portal will drop players at the same spot as the mage spell (a few hundred yards up!) so make sure to cast [[Slow Fall (ability)]] before entering the portal!

On the east side of the crater on the high rim, find Modera and approach her.
:{{text|say|Archmage Modera|Welcome, <name>. I'm glad you received my message.}}
