This quest concludes the {{questchain|Plants vs. Ghouls}} quest chain and awards the singing sunflower pet.

Defeat Warden Stillwater.

==Description==
IT'S STILLWATER! HE'S ALMOST HERE! It's going to take everything that we've got to beat him! Let's do this!

==Rewards==

}}

You will also receive:

==Completion==
I can't believe we defeated him, <name>! That was the toughest fight yet, but there are still hundreds of crazed zombies roaming around Hillsbrad. We'll need to stay alert. 

==Trivia==
The name is a reference to George Romero's zombie movie titles ("Dawn of the Dead", "Day of the Dead" etc.). This was also the original name of Plants Versus Zombies, the puzzle game that this quest line was based off of.
