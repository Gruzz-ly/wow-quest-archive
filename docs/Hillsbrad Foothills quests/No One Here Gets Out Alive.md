==Objectives==
Assess the situation at the [[Sludge Fields]].
*Assess the situation at the Sludge Fields.
*Speak with Warden Stillwater at the Sludge Fields in Hillsbrad Foothills.

==Description==
This farm is under lockdown! Nothing gets in and nothing gets out! We're still assessing the situation to try and figure out what exactly happened, but my theory is that the laborers ate the mushrooms and somehow mutated into hideous undead monsters. I mean, how else could this have happened? This is just a farm! We grow mushrooms here! And sludge! Yes, sludge!

Take a look around, <class>, because now that you're here you can't leave until this issue is resolved.

See for yourself!

==Completion==
As you can see, they're all monsters! Most of my guards died and the ones that managed to escape are now holding down the barricades, preventing any of these potentially dangerous creatures from getting out.

We need your help!
