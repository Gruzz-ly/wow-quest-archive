==Objectives==
Save 10 [[Hill Fawn]]s.
*Hill Fawn "saved" (10)
*[[Duskingdawn's Wand]] (provided)

==Description==
Blessed be the Light! I need your help!

On my way into Hillsbrad I noticed several families of adorable little deer. As I went out to pet one of the little fawns a ravenous mountain cat leapt out and killed it. I fled to [[Tarren Mill]] to solve the plight of the hill fawn. Now, after many days of tinkering, I have created the hill fawn's salvation!

Take my wand into the fields to the west and use it to empower the wee hill fawns. Once empowered they will be able to fend for themselves!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

==Progress==
So... did it work?

==Completion==
WHAT!? No, don't tell me that, <name>! It can't be true! My... I... I would never...

I won't give up, <class>. Just you wait and see. I will save those fawns!

==Notes==
"Saving" the fawns will enrage them, and using the wand on them twice will cause them to explode.
