Deliver Muckgill's Flipper back to [[Captain Keyton]] at the [[Azurelode Mine]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].
* [[Muckgill's Flipper]] (provided)

==Description==
This looks like Muckgill's flipper or something. Maybe there's somebody that cares that you killed this [[murloc]] back at the Azurelode Mine camp. Probably not, but it's worth a shot.

Take Muckgill's fin or whatever it might be back to Captain Keyton at the Azurelode Mine in southwestern Hillsbrad.

* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Do I look like some kind of murloc scientist?

==Completion==
Muckgill you say? Never heard of him. What is this anyway? Some kind of fin or something?
