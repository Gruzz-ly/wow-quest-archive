* [[The Ray Getz-Kalaba Monstrosity]] slain

==Description==
Before the [[Warden Stillwater|warden]] receives his comeuppance we must deal with the outbreak. We cannot risk this contagion being released into the world.

Within the laborers' quarters, directly north of here, is a monstrosity Stillwater pieced together out of three farmers. This beast must be destroyed if we are to secure the [[Sludge Fields]]! Protocol demands it!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

==Progress==
Do not waste my time, <name>.

==Completion==
Once we deal with the rest of the undead we will confront Stillwater!

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Hillsbrad Foothills!}}
