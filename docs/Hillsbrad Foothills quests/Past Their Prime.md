==Objectives==
Kill 12 Infested Bears.
* [[Infested Bear]] slain (12)

==Description==
Bears are soulless beasts put upon this earth to torment us. Only through Forsaken ingenuity have we have devised a way to make use of the bears so that they may serve some purpose! We use the living bears at our spider [[Farm|farm]] as living egg feeders. Our spiders lay their eggs in the bear flesh and the eggs thrive off of the meat and blood of the beasts.

After they have served their purpose the monsters must be put down. Travel southeast and kill the infested bears that have lived past their prime.

==Progress==
Don't worry, <class>. We'll never run out of bears.

==Completion==
The bear gods are cruel masters. They will continue to populate this world with bears until the end of days. It is our right as civilized people to make use of this nuisance - for the betterment of us all!
