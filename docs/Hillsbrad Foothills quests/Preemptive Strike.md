==Objectives==
Kill any 15 Naga at the Eastern Strand.
* [[Daggerspine Naga]] slain (15)

==Description==
These plans document what appears to be an imminent attack on [[Southshore]]. The naga of the Eastern Strand are planning to take over the town now that the [[Alliance]] has been pushed out.

Not if you can help it!

Kill all of the naga on the Eastern Strand and report to [[Helcular]] at the [[Ruins of Southshore]] with the Daggerspine attack plan. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Band of the Eastern Strand
|Daggerspine Ball
|Daggerspine Dagger
|Preemptive Staff
}}

You will also receive:
*2200 [[XP]]
*350 reputation with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
What's this?

==Completion==
HAH! Those naga have some balls on them! To think that they could take Southshore from us in our own territory! Such a preposterous notion.

<Helcular laughs.>

You have done well to thwart their attack - though I do wonder if they could have survived for even a minute in the blight.
