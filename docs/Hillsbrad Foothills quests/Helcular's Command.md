==Objectives==
Kill 15 Bloodfang Forsaken Hunters.
* [[Bloodfang Forsaken Hunter]] slain (15)

==Description==
Our [[dark ranger]]s search the fields for worgen terrorists. These worgen have been sent out by their dark masters to hunt and kill us. And though a dark ranger is a formidable combatant, the worgen often attack in packs, which can overwhelm even a dark ranger.

Search the fields around the ruins of Southshore for Bloodfang forsaken hunters. Kill any that you see! For the Forsaken and for Lordaeron!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||14}}

==Progress==
Have you dealt with the worgen?

==Completion==
We should have killed [[Ivar Bloodfang|Bloodfang]] in [[Silverpine Forest|Silverpine]]. It's a shame he still lives. It's an even bigger shame that we have as of yet been unable to turn worgen into undead. Surely there is a way...
