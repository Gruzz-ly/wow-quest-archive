==Objectives==
Kill any 10 [[Gnoll]]s at the Nethander Stead.
*Mudsnout Gnoll or Shaman slain (10)

==Description==
Gnolls! These terrible little creatures are a blight upon any land - which is saying a lot when you consider that [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]] is [[Forsaken]] territory. Kill as many of the gnolls at the [[Nethander Stead]] as you can. For the good of the world!

==Completion==
Though you have taken a sizeable chunk out of the current gnoll populace of Hillsbrad, more will take their place. For now you may sit comfortably knowing that you did your part.

== Notes ==
This quest is gained when killing any [[Mudsnout Gnoll]] or [[Mudsnout Shaman]] at [[Nethander Stead]] during the quest [[Kasha Will Fly Again]].
