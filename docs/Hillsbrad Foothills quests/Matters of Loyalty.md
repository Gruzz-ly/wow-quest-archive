==Objectives==
Speak to [[Drek'Thar]].
*Learn of Matters of Loyalty.

==Description==
I have no authority over such matters. You must speak to our leader, Drek'Thar. I have already sent word of your arrival to [[Frostwolf Keep]]. Drek'Thar will be out to speak with you personally.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||17}}

==Completion==
<High Warlord Cromush's face turns white.>

THEY HAVE FORSAKEN US? THEY HAVE FORSAKEN THE HORDE? This cannot be!

I...

<Cromush falls to one knee.>

I... I WILL BE FINE. We will do this without their aid. To hell with the Frostwolf!

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest will give a cutscene where [[Captain Galvangar]] comes out of the tunnel to Alterac Valley, pushing [[Drek'Thar]] on a wheelchair.

:{{text|say|Drek'Thar|Yes... I have done terrible things, but nothing could ever be as terrible as lending aid to the Forsaken.}}
:{{text|say|Drek'Thar|You go back to that spineless orc who would not come see me and you tell him that the Frostwolf clan will not aid the Forsaken. Not now, not ever!}}
