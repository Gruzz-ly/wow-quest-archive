Survive 2 Massive Waves of Zombies.

==Description==
Even though we beat [[Warden Stillwater]], his zombies still roam the countryside. Look there, another wave is approaching! Help me fight them off, old buddy! Let's go!

You will receive: {{coppercost|94000}} (+{{coppercost|165400}} at max level)

That'll keep 'em out for today, but I know they'll be back tomorrow. Hopefully you'll be around to help me.
