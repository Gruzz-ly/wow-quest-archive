==Objectives==
Collect 12 Beating Yeti Hearts.
* [[Beating Yeti Heart]] (12)

==Description==
[[Magus Wordeen Voidglare|The magus]] has been idle for far too long and an idle magus often leads to poorly thought out schemes. This time I am charged with collecting various beast organs in order to power some type of control rod. I am far too frail to go out hunting beasts - especially yetis!

Perhaps if I were to offer you a reward of some kind you would do it? All I need is for you to head west to the yeti caves and kill yetis. Rip their still beating hearts from their chests and bring them back here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tell-Tale Bracers
|Supple Yeti Leggings
|Bel'varil's Armbands
|Bel'varil's Chain Leggings
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*12x [[Yetichoke Hearts]]

==Progress==
Bring me the yeti hearts, <name>.

==Completion==
I... um... well... turns out he doesn't need the hearts anymore. Sorry about that! Hope it wasn't too inconvenient! A deal's a deal though, so here is your reward. You can go ahead and keep the yeti hearts. I hear they hold excellent nutritional value - if you're into eating.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Bel'varil's Chain Leggings]] added as a reward.}}
