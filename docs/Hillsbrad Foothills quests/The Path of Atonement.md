==Objectives==
Speak to [[Archmage Modera]]'s associate at the [[Dalaran Crater]] within [[Hillsbrad Foothills]]
* Discover the location of [[Felo'melorn]]

==Description==
Felo'melorn, the runeblade of the [[Sunstrider|kings]] of [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Quel'Thalas]]. It was said to harness the very essence of flame and after being reforged by [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas]] could even stand against the legendary [[Frostmourne]].

We thought that the blade was lost with Kael'thas's death but an associate of mine has a lead on where it may be located.

We need every advantage we can get and with Felo'melorn in your hand the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] surely will tremble!

Ah, our company is here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
* 1500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Our next journey will be to [[Icecrown Citadel|Icecrown]], <name>.

There, in the heart of the [[Scourge]], we will find Felo'melorn.

:''[[Aethas Sunreaver]] teleports in!''
:{{text|say|Aethas Sunreaver|Thank you both for meeting me in such an inhospitable location. I assure you that if I were able to join you in [[Dalaran]], I would.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Modera|The wounds inflicted by the [[:Divine Bell]] incident run deep, Aethas. Others in the [[Council of Six|council]] are not as forgiving as I.}}
:{{text|say|Aethas Sunreaver|Precisely why I'm here. If I can't return to my former position, then perhaps the council will at least consider restoring my access to the city. As a show of good faith, I have information to offer.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Modera|I will bring your case before the others... but I cannot promise the outcome will be in your favor.}}
:{{text|say|Aethas Sunreaver|You have my thanks, friend.}}
:{{text|say|Aethas Sunreaver|I once knew [[Lyandra Sunstrider]], a distant relative of [[Anasterian Sunstrider|King Anasterian]]. Though she bore the Sunstrider name, in truth her branch of the family held no claim to the throne.}}
:{{text|say|Aethas Sunreaver|After Kael'thas's betrayal, she became obsessed with finding Felo'melorn to claim it for her own. I told her it was a fool's errand, that she'd never find the relic. Indeed, it has been many years since I last heard from her.}}
:{{text|say|Aethas Sunreaver|But with the Legion's coming, I decided to begin my own search for the location of the blade. I saw a vision of Lyandra with the weapon in hand. Around her the land was covered in ice, and an all-too-familiar fortress loomed behind her.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Modera|Icecrown. You believe you'll find her there?}}
:{{text|say|Aethas Sunreaver|Indeed I do. And nothing happens in that citadel unless [[Lich King|its master]] wills it. I would not be surprised to learn he had a hand in this.}}
