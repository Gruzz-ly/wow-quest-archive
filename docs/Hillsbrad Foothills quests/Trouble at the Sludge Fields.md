==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Warden Stillwater}} at the [[Sludge Fields]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].

==Description==
Warden Stillwater, over at the Sludge Fields, north of here, has sent out a distress signal. The missive wasn't clear, but from what I could make of the letter there's a riot happening at the Sludge Fields and most of the guards have been killed. The warden has warned that any would-be-heroes approach from the back entry, located on the western side of the Sludge Fields.

He's also asked for discretion. He doesn't want news of this little *ahem* uprising to the surface.

==Completion==
Who are you? Did [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] send you? Everything is FINE! Yes, perfectly fine! I've got it all under control!

Well, fine all things considered that is... We've got a few problems that perhaps you could help with, <class>.
