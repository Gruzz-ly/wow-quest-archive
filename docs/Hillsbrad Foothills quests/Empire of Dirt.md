==Objectives==
Report to [[High Executor Darthalia]] at [[Southpoint Blockade]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].

==Description==
This war has taken its toll on us as a people. We have lost much to secure our place as the rightful rulers of [[Lordaeron]]. And though the moment is won, the battle continues to rage in other parts of the [[Eastern Kingdoms]].

I must return to the [[Undercity]] to recuperate. I want you to go to Hillsbrad Foothills in my stead, <name>. As my most trusted soldier, you will lead our forces to absolute domination against our enemies in Hillsbrad.

Report to High Executor Darthalia at Southpoint Blockade, to the east.

==Completion==
News of your conquest in [[Silverpine Forest|Silverpine]] emboldens us, <name>. We are prepared to fight at your command and beat back the last remaining vestiges of humanity in Hillsbrad.

==Trivia==
*This quest's name is likely a reference to the song "{{wp|Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt}}" by Nine Inch Nails, which contains the lyrics "You can have it all / My empire of dirt."
