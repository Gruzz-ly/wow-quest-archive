==Objectives==
Report to [[Captain Keyton]] at the [[Azurelode Mine]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].

==Description==
Productivity from our spider [[Farm|farm]] at the Azurelode Mine is at a standstill. Captain Keyton has requested that we send help immediately. Keyton claims that the mine spiders refuse command and are running rampant. Furthermore, a group of coastal murlocs are raiding our supplies. I want you to go down there and check things out. Help out Keyton and the spider-handler, <name>.

You'll fine Azurelord to the southeast, near the coast.

==Completion==
We're in a bit of a bind <class>. [[Spider-Handler Sarus|Sarus]]' spiders are starting to get a little uppity as we've been unable to feed them for days. If we leave the [[murloc]]s will overtake our post! Further more, [[Warden Stillwater]] over at the [[Sludge Fields]] is demanding that we send him more humans! He is insatiable! We need help!
