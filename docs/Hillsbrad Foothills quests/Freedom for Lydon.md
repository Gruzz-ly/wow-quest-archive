==Objectives==
Recover Lydon's Cage Key.
* [[Lydon's Cage Key]]

==Description==
This place is no farm! [[Warden Stillwater|Stillwater]] has been experimenting on the humans of [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]]. These monstrosities here are all his creations.

That's not the worst of it, <class>. The aberrations that have the key to my cage are former [[Forsaken]]. Stillwater's experiments have the side effect of turning Forsaken into mindless [[zombie]]s. Why do you think he's so afraid of letting this out? He knows that such a crime is punishable by [[Forsaken#True death|true death]].

Get me out of here! The infected sludge guards outside have the key!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Monstrous Shield
|Aberrant Vest
|Sludge Guard Mail Vest
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Get the key!

==Completion==
<Lydon takes the key from you.>

I'll let myself out, thanks.

I have never been so angry! Stillwater won't get away with this. I will present his head to the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]] myself.

You and I will work together, <name>.

I don't know about [[Johnny Awesome|this one]] over here, but I'd prefer he stayed behind.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
Lydon and Johnny accompany the player.
