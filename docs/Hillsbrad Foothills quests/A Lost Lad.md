==Objectives==
Find [[Johnny Awesome]] at the [[Sludge Fields]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].

==Description==
It was only yesterday that I sent him out to investigate the [[farm]] directly east of here, but it feels like an eternity has passed!

True perfection. The way his blond locks framed his perfect [[blood elf]] face... Such strength. I didn't want to send him away, but he insisted! How could I refuse him?

Alas, poor Johnny Awesome has not returned! I fear the worst, <name>. Find him!

==Completion==
<Johnny is sobbing loudly.>

Tw... Twinkles!!!! Th... It killed her!

<Johnny continues to cry>

==Notes==
When entering the building:
:{{text|say|[[Master Apothecary Lydon]]|YOU THERE! Yes, you, <class>! I have been captured against my will and imprisoned illegaly{{sic}} by Warden Stillwater. Get me out of this cage and I will explain everything.}}

{{Rfg-section}}
Prior to {{g|Sl}}, this quest was named '''Little Girl Lost''' and featured Stillwater humorously mistaking Johnny Awesome for a woman. The original quest description read:
:It was only yesterday that I sent her out to investigate the farm directly east of here, but it feels like an eternity has passed!

:I knew it was true love the minute I saw her. Her lovely blonde locks and the way they framed her perfect blood elf face... She melted my shriveled heart. I didn't want to send her out, but she was so demanding! I had to give her what she asked for! Who could refuse such a vision?

:Alas, poor Jenny Awesome has not returned! I fear the worst, <name>. Find her!

The last completion sentence was:
:<Johnny continues to cry. Little snot bubbles form in his nostrils.>
