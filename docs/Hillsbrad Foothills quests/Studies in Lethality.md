==Objectives==
Recover 250 Blight Samples.
*Blight Sample taken (250)

==Description==
We used a fairly potent strain of blight against the humans of [[Southshore]]. As you can see, it worked. The trouble with blight use, though, is that blight tends to stick around after it's served its purpose.

What I need from you is to take this testing kit and get out into the field to get a lethality count from the blight slimes that we've released into the area. Use the lethality analyzer on the blight slimes sweeping the slime pools. Come back to me when you have some solid data.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||14}}

==Progress==
We need Southshore move in ready!

==Completion==
Oh my. 250? This thing doesn't go past 250. How are you still standing? You should be a puddle of goo by now. [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] will be most displeased with this information. There might be some things we can do to reduce the lethality levels of the area by a few decades, but that still leaves us out by about a hundred or so years.

== Notes ==

Once you accept this quest, you will get a new heads-up display, an analogue meter reader that shows the level of anger from the Blight Slime.



As you take samples from the [[Blight Slime]], they will progressively get angry at you. Initialy they are {{reputation|neutral}} to you. As you progress in this quest, they become {{reputation|unfriendly}} and the following warnings are given. Finally, near completion, they are {{reputation|hostile}} to you and attack you on sight. 

* {{text|yellow|The Blight Slimes are beginning to react negatively towards your prodding.}}
* {{text|yellow|The Blight Slimes are getting ANGRY!}}
* {{text|yellow|The Blight Slimes want your blood!}}
** At this point, you will be offered the quest [[Angry Scrubbing Bubbles]], and the [[Angry Blight Slimes]] will become attackable.
