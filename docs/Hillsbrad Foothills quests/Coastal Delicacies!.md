==Objectives==
Feed the Hungry Mine Spider 12 Murlocs from the [[Western Strand]].
* Murlocs fed to [[Hungry Mine Creeper|Hungry Mine Spider]] (12)

==Description==
My spiders are hungry and agitated! They haven't eaten for days and are starting to sample our human captives. We can't have that. We need those humans for use in the [[Sludge Fields]].

I want you to take one of my hungry mine spiders out and feed it murlocs from the [[Western Strand]], south of here. Whatever you kill, it'll eat! The more the better!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||12}}

==Progress==
Have you fed my spider?

==Completion==
This should keep it happy and content for a few days. You've done a good thing here, <name>!

== Notes ==
{{NPC||Muckgill}} wanders the coast.  You can kill him to loot [[Muckgill's Flipper]], which starts the quest [[Muckgill's Flipper or Something...]] .

==Progression==
