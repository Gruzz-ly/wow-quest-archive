==Objectives==
Recover 8 Used Blight Canisters.
* [[Used Blight Canister]] (8)
* [[Lethality Analyzer]] (provided)

==Description==
Recycling! It's all the craze these days. The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]] has decreed that we must conserve if we are to prosper as a people. Everyone must do their part, right? With that said, you will be doing our part for us.

There are likely thousands of blight canister bits and pieces all over Southshore. We can reuse those canisters for more blight bombing goodness. Just head into the ruins here and pick up whatever you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||14}}

==Progress==
Bring me those canisters!

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. You are incredibly resilient to this blight. We'll have to take you in for testing some time.

==Progression==
