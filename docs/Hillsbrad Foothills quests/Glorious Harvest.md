==Objectives==
Recover 60 Creeper Eggs.
* [[Creeper Egg]] (60)

==Description==
Directly south of Southpoint Gate you will find our spider domestication operations. Through the years we have grown a kinship with the spiders of Hillsbrad and have managed to domesticate and breed the adorable little critters. Spiders now serve us as regular household pets and beasts of battle! Such diverse creatures they are!

I need you to head into the fields to the southeast and carefully harvest the eggs that we have incubating on the bears. Deliver the harvest to Sarus at the mine.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:

* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Have you brought my harvest?

==Completion==
Wonderful! Now to place these eggs into a nice, dark alcove inside the [[Azurelode Mine|mine]] and let the miracle of life happen!

The pods can be found both on the bears and on the ground. Some pods might contain more than one egg.
