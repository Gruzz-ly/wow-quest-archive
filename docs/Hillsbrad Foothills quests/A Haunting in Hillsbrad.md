==Objectives==
Search Dun Garok for Evidence of a Haunting. 
*Search Dun Garok for Evidence of a Haunting.

==Description==
The battle over [[Dun Garok]] was the bloodiest of all the [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]] battles. The dwarves, outnumbered ten-to-one, fought until the bitter end. Every last one of 'em died in defense of that piece of land.

Now I hear claims that the place is haunted. Nobody wants to go near it! Unfortunately I have orders to prepare Dun Garok for habitation.

Could you do me a favor and go to Dun Garok and search for evidence of a haunting? It's far to the southeast.

==Completion==
Haunted? Ye could say that!
