==Objectives==
Capture 8 Hillsbrad Humans.
* [[Captured Hillsbrad Human|Hillsbrad Human]] Captured (8)
* [[Titanium Shackles]] (provided)

==Description==
This mine was once the heart of [[Alliance]] mining operations in [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]]. It now serves as a breeding ground for our loyal spiders, though, the humans still occupy it - in a way.

<Keyton grins.>

But onto business! {{NPC||Warden Stillwater}} has called for more workers at the [[Sludge Fields]]. I want you to enter the mine with these shackles and capture Hillsbrad humans for labor in the fields.

Break them out of their web paralysis and beat them into submission before you use the shackles.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Binding Plates
|Slaver's Leggings
|Officer's Armbands
|Web Coated Leggings
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
We mustn't keep the warden waiting!

==Completion==
These will do nicely. I do wonder what the warden has planned for them. Last I heard the Sludge Fields were overrun by some very bad things.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Hillsbrad Foothills!}}
