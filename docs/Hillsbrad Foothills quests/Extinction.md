==Objectives==
Kill 12 Rampaging Owlbeasts.
* [[Rampaging Owlbeast]] slain (12)

==Description==
[[Owlbeast]]s... Soulless, feathered monstrosities sent from the darkest depths of the [[Twisting Nether]] to prey upon the weak.

<Nils points to the woods surrounding [[Eastpoint Tower]].>

They surround us on all sides and they are planning an attack - I can sense it. You must stop them before they can organize.

I want you to head into the forest and kill every owlbeast that you see. NONE SHOULD SURVIVE!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progress==
Nothing less than extinction will be accepted!

==Completion==
The itching has stopped - for now - but they will return.

Oh yes, they will return...

==Progression==
{{Eastpoint Tower}}
