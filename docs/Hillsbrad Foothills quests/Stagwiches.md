==Objectives==
Retrieve 8 slabs of Stag Meat.
* [[Juicy Stag Meat]] (8)

==Description==
Ever had a stagwich? Me neither. Apparently they're delicious. Now I'm not one for eating, but I am a businessman. If my customers want stagwiches, who am I to argue?

You're probably asking yourself, "What does this have to do with me?" I'll tell you what, <class>, I need stag meat! You get me stag meat from the hill stags of [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]] and I will pay you. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn't it?

Get going! Stags are most plentiful to the west.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will receive: {{cost||30}}
|q1=3|Stagwich
|Stagwich Slicer}}

==Progress==
I need stag meat!

==Completion==
That's a hefty load you're carrying. It should keep my customers satisfied for the time being.

Here is your pay, as promised.
