==Objectives==
Kill Instructor Rufus, Drill Sergeant Magnus and Captain Crudbeard.
* [[Instructor Rufus]] slain
* [[Drill Sergeant Magnus]] slain
* [[Captain Crudbeard]] slain

==Description==
For your next mission I want you to travel west to the [[Headland]]s and infiltrate the [[Stormpike clan|Stormpike]] training grounds. Though there are hundreds of [[Stormpike Trainee|Stormpike trainees]] there, one of my [[banshee]]s will disguise you to look like one of the humans captured earlier, allowing you to walk freely among the enemy.

Enter the Headlands and find the Stormpike Instructors. Once found, coerce them into attacking you! When they attack, kill them. With their instructors dead, they will be unable to train more soldiers.

==Progress==
<Melisara's thoughts intermingle with your thoughts.>

==Completion==

<Melisara's voice pervades your thoughts.>

Perfectly handled. You could easily be a [[Deathstalkers|Deathstalker]]. And what could they have even done to you? You acted in self defense!

Now to deal with the final finger.

==Notes==
;Instructor Rufus
:OY! Piss of, eh?
:{{gossip|Dirty, stinkin' [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]]. You know these dwarves only consider you as half a dwarf, right? What does that make you? A gnome?}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Rufus|What did ye say, Sally?! The only one of us who resembles a gnome is you - after I'm done cuttin' you into wee pieces!}}
:{{text|say|Instructor Rufus|Come on then, Nancy! Let's go!}}

;Drill Sergeant Magnus
:I'm busy, lad. Why don't ye go find some Forsaken goo and take a bath, eh?
:{{gossip|I guess it's true, then. I didn't want to believe that you were a yellow-bellied snow-licker, but there's no doubt about it now.}}
:{{text|say|Drill Sergeant Magnus|What did ye call me? I'll show ye what a "snow licker" can do!}}
:{{text|say|Drill Sergeant Magnus|OY! GET A ROPE!}}

;Captain Crudbeard
:Leave or I'll be forced to pound yer face in!
:{{gossip|Crudbeard? You are one ugly little girl. I didn't even know they let little girls become death knights. Was the [[Lich King]] trying to meet his quota when he made you or something? I would have thrown you back.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Crudbeard|Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this more than I probably should.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Crudbeard|When I'm through with ya, yer head's gonna be firmly placed between yer ass cheeks!}}
