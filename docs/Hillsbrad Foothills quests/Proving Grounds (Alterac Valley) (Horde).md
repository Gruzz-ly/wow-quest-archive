==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Wildpaw Cavern]] located southeast of the main base in [[Alterac Valley]] and find the Frostwolf Banner. Return the Frostwolf Banner to [[Warmaster Laggrond]]. 
*[[Frostwolf Banner]] {{co|50.7|93.4|Alterac Valley}}

==Description==
Hail, <class>. It has been a long time since we have had the chance to answer the call of battle. The old feelings are slow to rise but once awakened, the blood does rush. The battle rage returns...

All newcomers to the Valley must first complete the rite of battle.

Deep within the Wildpaw gnoll cave is a banner of the Frostwolf. Venture forth and recover the banner. Return it to me and I shall grant you the Frostwolf initiate's insignia. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Frostwolf Insignia Rank 1]]
*[[Peeling the Onion]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Clan]]
*250 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Wake up! Wake up, <name>! This is not a dream. You really are entrenched in the midst of a raging battle! 

==Completion==
That burning sensation you feel is your soul being awakened. Your spirit has accepted the call to arms.

You are now one of the Frostwolf, <name>. Congratulations.

Carry this insignia with you at all times. As you advance among the ranks of Frostwolf, I will replace the insignia with other, more powerful insignias.

Perhaps someday you will be exalted among the Frostwolf Clan. Should that day ever come, you will be granted the Eye of Command.
