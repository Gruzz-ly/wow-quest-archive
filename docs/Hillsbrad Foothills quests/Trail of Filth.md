==Objectives==
Kill Chet the Slime-Breeder.
* [[Chet the Slime-Breeder]] slain
* Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
The trail of filth and anger leads into the ruined [[town hall]]. Surely there is a slime breeding pool inside the structure. Fight your way inside and dealt with whatever angry slime-breeder that you encounter!

Should you succeed [[Serge Hinott]] at the [[Ruins of Southshore]] will surely want to hear about it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Lethality Leggings
|Chet's Slimy Bracers
|Hinott's Outer Robe
|Slime Resistant Bracer
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Perhaps with Chet vanquished, the lethality levels of this place will decrease a tad faster. A job well done, <name>!

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Hillsbrad Foothills!}}
