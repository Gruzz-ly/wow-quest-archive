==Objectives==
Use the Barrel of Water to Poison 30 Stormpike Trainees.
* [[Stormpike Trainee]]s poisoned (30)
* [[Water Barrel (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
As long as I am by your side the enemy will think of you as one of their own. Your newfound humanity, however, will not allow you to be reckless. If you draw attention to yourself the dwarves will grow suspicious and likely attack!

With this said, I have a plan. Take this barrel of poisoned water and use it to sate the thirst of the tired Stormpike trainees. Once they drink from it they will become deathly ill, eventually succumbing to the poison.

== Rewards ==

*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Deception and trickery - these are your tools!

==Completion==
They won't die immediately, but they WILL die! When they finally piece together who was responsible for the deaths of their soldiers, you will be long gone - a phantom of death!
