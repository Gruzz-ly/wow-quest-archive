==Objectives==
Kill 5 Angry Blight Slimes.
* [[Angry Blight Slime]] slain (5)

==Description==
These blight slimes seem to be really angry. They've even got a faint of an angry humanoid face in their ectoplasm. You don't think [[Serge Hinott|Hinott]] would be too happy having non-compliant slimes working the slime pools.

Kill any angry blight slimes that you see and try to get a lock on a breeding pool.

==Completion==
All signs indicate to a breeding pool being inside the ruined [[town hall]]. You'll need to investigate!

== Notes ==
You get this quest automatically when killing any [[Angry Blight Slime]]s at the [[Ruins of Southshore]].
