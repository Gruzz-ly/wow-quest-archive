Kill 10 Dun Garok Spirits.
* [[Dun Garok Spirit]] slain (10)

==Description==
The spirits of my soldiers haunt [[Dun Garok|this fort]] now, <lad/lass>. Their souls are now bound to this place. Even in death they continue to fight for it. 'Tis sad.

Put 'em out o' their misery and perhaps ye shall have the spoils of yer people's victory.
