Horde Adventurers at last see the fruits of their labors. [[Kingslayer Orkus|Kingslayer Orkus']] sacrifice has allowed [[High Warlord Cromush]]'s plan to come together, leading to the '''Stormpike Apocalypse'''. Adventurers simply need to watch as Hillsbrad is delivered to the Horde... 

==Objectives==
Witness the Stormpike Apocalypse.
*Witness the Stormpike Apocalypse.

==Description==
Before we continue, let us have a moment of silence for our fallen brother, [[Kingslayer Orkus|Orkus]], for without him, we would have been destroyed by the [[Stormpike clan|Stormpike]] onslaught. This is for you, brother!

<Cromush takes a knee.>

Now, <name>, do not think that I forgot your part in all of this! That is why you get the honors of detonating the goblin pocket-nukes.

Are you ready? FOR THE HORDE!

With the fingers destroyed and the hand shattered, the Stormpike will have no choice but scurry back to their cave in [[Alterac Valley]].
