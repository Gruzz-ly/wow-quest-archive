==Completion==
I... cannot explain this, <race>,  but I think I have something you need. I came to this land to seek knowledge, and that search led me up the mountain over yonder to a giant stone of light, fallen from the sky. In my contemplation at the stone, [[An'she]] gifted me with a great many things. One was a sense of new purpose. Another of which was a vision of you and me, here, having this conversation. I think I gave you this.

Please, take this totem. Use it well in service of An'she... in service of the [[light]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5900 [[XP]]
*[[Symbol of Faith]]

==Notes==
This quest is only available during [[Materials of Significance]].
