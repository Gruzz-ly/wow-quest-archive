Recover 6 Flesh Samples.

Samples... yes... must have samples! These, ah, experiments... I mean, these unfortunate laborers must be studied.

Travel southeast to the first farm and kill the risen ghouls. From their decrepit corpses you must recover flesh samples. Bring them to me!

<Arnauld wrings his hands together and laughs maniacally for no discernible reason.>

Must test!
