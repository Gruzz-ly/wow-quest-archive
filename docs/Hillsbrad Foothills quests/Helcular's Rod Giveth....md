==Description==
[[File:Touched by Helcular's Rod.jpg|thumb|Touched by Helcular's Rod...]]
To think, I, a master of [[necromancy]], trained by [[Kel'Thuzad]] himself, was reduced to nothing more than a corpse in a grave. Thankfully, my astute apprentice, [[Novice Thaivand|Thaivand]], managed to find a group of heroes to recover this:

<Helcular whips out his rod.>

It is through the power of the rod that I was reborn. The rod giveth and the rod taketh away!

Take it now and use it to empower our [[dark ranger]]s battling the [[worgen]] in the field north of us. Renew their vigor with my rod.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Helcular's Other Rod}}

==Progress==
I want that rod back when you're done.

==Completion==
As I said, the rod giveth to our dark rangers and doth taketh away from our enemy!

==Progression==
