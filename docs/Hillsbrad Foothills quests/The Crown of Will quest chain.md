# The Crown of Will quest chain

{{Removed}}

This series of quests takes place mostly in the [[Hillsbrad Foothills]], and concerns the fate of the [[Crown of Will]]. 

You are initially directed by [[Sharlindra]] in [[Undercity]] to report to [[Melisara]] in [[Tarren Mill]], in the [[Hillsbrad Foothills]]. Between these events you learn that [[Mug'thol]] and his ogre warband was sent to Alterac to retrieve the [[Crown of Will]] for Lady Sylvanas. However instead of returning with it the crown Mug'thol decided to try the crown, an act which released him from the Banshee Queens control. As such Horde adventurers are tasked with striking back against Mug'thol by killing liutentans and then Mug'thol himself. After killing the ogre warlord, adventurers turn the Crown of Will over to the Banshee Melisara, who plans to give to Sylvanas.
