==Objectives==
Kill Captain Iceheart and 12 Stormpike Soldiers.
* [[Captain Iceheart]] slain
* [[Stormpike Soldier]] slain (12)

==Description==
<[[Melisara]]'s image appears before you.>

The [[Stormpike clan|Stormpike]] forward camp sits atop [[Corrahn's Dagger]], west of [[Sofera's Naze]]. You must enter the camp and slaughter every dwarf that you see. They must be taught what it means to fear and there is no finer lesson than absolute decimation.

No survivors, <name>. Even their captain - especially their captain - must die.

I will be in contact.

==Progress==
<Melisara's thoughts intermingle with your thoughts.>

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Melisara.jpg|Melisara|Decimation leads to hesitation.}}
<Melisara's voice pervades your thoughts.>

They will see the bloodshed and they will hesitate. Hesitation will make them think twice about ever attacking us again.
