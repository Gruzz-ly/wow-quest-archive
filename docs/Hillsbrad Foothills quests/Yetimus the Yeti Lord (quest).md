==Objectives==
Take [[Yetimus the Yeti Lord|Yetimus]]' Twisted Horn.
* [[Yetimus' Twisted Horn]]
* Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
For years the mountain yeti of this region have been allowed free reign. Our complacency in dealing with the yeti menace has resulted in an aberration! Yetimus, lord of all yetis, has grown to a size and strength that our guard simply cannot handle. We fear that should his appetite lead him near [[Tarren Mill]] he would devour us all.

Gather a party of suitable adventurers and dispatch the beast. He roams the countryside to the west.

Bring me one of his horns and I will reward you handsomely.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shield of Uncurbed Appetite
|Tarren Orb
|Yetimus Maximus}}

==Progress==
Yetimus must die!

==Completion==
So it's true, you did kill the beast! The people of Hillsbrad are indebted to you, <name>. You have made the land safer for our citizens.

Take whatever you may desire from our coffers.
