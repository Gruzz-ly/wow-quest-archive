==Objectives==
Use the Banshee Mirror to capture 10 SI:7 Agents.
* SI:7 Agents captured (10)
* [[Banshee Mirror]] (provided)

==Description==
So you are to be our savior? Very well then, I will bond myself with you. Through this bond I will be able to see through your eyes and communicate with you in the field.

According to the plans you brought to us, the [[Stormpike Guard|Stormpike]] have enlisted the aid of [[SI:7]] at [[Sofera's Naze]], to the north. SI:7 are comprised solely of humans - humans that we are able to use to our benefit.

Take my mirror and travel north. Engage in combat with the SI:7 and bring them near death. Once they are injured, use the mirror.

==Progress==
<Melisara's thoughts intermingle with your thoughts.>

==Completion==

<Melisara's voice pervades your thoughts.>

The humans will serve us in life and in death. I will be in contact with you shortly.

==Notes==
Bring [[SI:7 Assassin (Hillsbrad Foothills)|SI:7 Assassins]] and [[SI:7 Operative (Hillsbrad Foothills)|SI:7 Operatives]] to 30%.
