==Progress==
My rogues need to hone their lockpicking skills, and I need locks of adequate difficulty—the stuff [[Zan Shivsproket|Zan]] makes us is unfit for all but the lowliest neophytes.

Tell ya what, if you bring me 5 Heavy Junkboxes, I'll provide you with some of the finest throwing knives known to roguekind.

You can unlock the boxes and rifle through them, but you'll have to leave at least a few coins in them... even a rogue in training needs motivation.
*[[Heavy Junkbox]] (5)

==Completion==
May these knives find a place in someone's heart.

Literally.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Ravenholdt]]
*-75 reputation with [[Syndicate]]

==Notes==
*[[Heavy Junkbox]]es are received from level 52+ mobs using [[Pick Pocket]].
*This quest is available to all classes, not just [[Rogues]] (although you will need a rogue to get you the Heavy Junkboxes).
*See [[Ravenholdt]] or [[Farming Heavy Junkboxes]] for more information.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.3.0|note=[[Fahrad]] no longer offers this quest. Quest now offered by [[Winstone Wolfe]].}}
