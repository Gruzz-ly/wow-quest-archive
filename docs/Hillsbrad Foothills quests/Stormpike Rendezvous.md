==Objectives==
Learn about the Stormpike Rendezvous from [[Kingslayer Orkus|Orkus]].
*Learn about the Stormpike Rendezvous from Orkus.
*Speak to Kingslayer Orkus at the Ruins of Southshore in Hillsbrad Foothills.

==Description==
I tracked down the decrepit necromancer, [[Helcular]], in hope of getting a lead on Alliance movement within [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]].

Helcular tasked me with finding and killing [[worgen]]. Ordinarily this would be not a problem for Orkus, but I had just eaten several helpings of [[Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok Chops|Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok chops]], causing my bowels to cry out in anguish. That's when the trouble began and how I ended up in the water.

Hear Orkus out, <name>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||14}}

==Completion==
I will have my vengeance, but first we must heal [[Kasha]].

== Notes ==
:"I had just finished making use of the facilities on the docks when..."

:{{text|yell|Vanndar Stormpike|ENOUGH TOYIN' AROUND!!!}}
:{{text|say|Vanndar Stormpike|Let's get outta here, 'Linda. We dun wanna draw any unwanted attention!}}
