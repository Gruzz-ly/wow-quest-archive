==Objectives==
Speak to [[Serge Hinott]] at the [[Ruins of Southshore]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].

==Description==
Before my capture and imprisonment, I was stationed at [[Southshore]]. My primary job at the ruins was to take slime samples and make sure that the blight that we released was safely dissipating. Simple and easy if not for the [[worgen]] that would continuously harass us.

I need you to head to Southshore and find my apprentice, Serge Hinott. Make sure that he's ok and inform him that I will return once my work here has concluded.

You'll find the Ruins of Southshore to the southeast, near the coast.

==Completion==
The worgen situation hasn't gotten any better and [[Helcular]] is really creeping me out.

==Progression==
