==Objectives==
Accompany [[Kingslayer Orkus]] to [[Purgation Isle]].
*The Road to Purgation taken

==Description==
The time of vengeance has come, <name>. Kasha can once more fly, thanks to you. She will take us to Purgation Isle so that we may confront the [[Stormpike clan|Stormpike]] [[dwarf]] general, [[Vanndar Stormpike]], and his captain, [[Balinda Stonehearth]]. BOTH will pay for what they have done.

Are you ready? Orkus cannot do this alone.

==Completion==
This place is dark... foreboding. It smells of piss and fur. There are definitely [[worgen]] here and very likely dwarves.
