==Objectives==
Recover 6 Forsaken Camp "Supplies."
* [[Forsaken Camp "Supplies"]] (6)

==Description==
The long strength of coastline directly south of our position that extends from west to east is known as the [[Western Strand]]. Along the Western Strand you will find two things: [[murloc]]s and our stolen "supplies."

<Keyton puts his hands in the air and makes quotation marks with his fingers.>

Those damned thieving murlocs struck while our backs were return and took our "supplies."

Sarus and I cannot leave this post. We need you to head to the Wester Strand and recover those "supplies!"

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||12}}

==Progress==
Recover our "supplies," <name>!

==Completion==
At least we'll be prepared for any future incidents. Moving "supplies" like this around is a risky proposition. You never know who is going to open their big fat mouth.

<Keyton raises what appears to be an eyebrow at you.>

==Progression==
