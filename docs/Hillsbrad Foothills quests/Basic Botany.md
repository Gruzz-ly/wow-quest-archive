Survive a Massive Wave of Zombies.

==Description==
HELP! HELP! Crazed undead are attacking my farm! That psycho [[Warden Stillwater|warden]] over at the [[Sludge Fields]] is probably responsible for this mess. Help me fight off the zombies!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (+{{coppercost|165300}} at max level)

==Completion==
PHEW! That was close! You're a real natural with these plants, <class>. You know, I brought the seeds here with me from [[Lost Isles]]. I figure once I get them all figured out I'll make a fortune in the deadly flower business!

Wha... LOOK! MORE ARE COMING!
