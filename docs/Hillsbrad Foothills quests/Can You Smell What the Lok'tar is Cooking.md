==Objectives==
Find Kingslayer Orkus at the [[Ruins of Southshore]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].

==Description==
Shortly before you arrived an orc flew in upon a [[frost wyrm]] and demanded that I direct him to where the 'newbies were hanging out.' Uncertain as to the vernacular, I told him to fulfill his duty as a member of the Horde and deal with the [[worgen]] threat of the area. He grumbled something about 'what the lok'tar was cooking' and headed south to the docks.

Ordinarily I wouldn't care about whether or not an orc went missing, but I am genuinely curious about what the lok'tar might be cooking. Find out.
