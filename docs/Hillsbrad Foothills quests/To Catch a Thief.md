This rogue-only quest is the fourth part of the chain to obtain the legendary dagger set [[Fangs of the Father]]. It is the first of several [[Stealth]]-based missions in the series. It also marks the end of the "prelude" to the storyline, revealing the power that has been influencing events so far.

==Objectives==
Infiltrate [[Ravenholdt Manor]] and locate the missing black dragon egg.
* Egg Located

==Description==
Just beyond this cave lies Ravenholdt Manor. You need to get inside without being seen!

<{{NPC||Mostrasz}} places an enchantment on you.>

There - now I'll be able to keep an eye on you and communicate as you venture into the compound. Now sneak into that manor, locate the egg, and don't get caught...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Ravenholdt]]

==Completion==
So, you will join with me?

Good. Very good.

== Notes ==
;Upon accept
:Mostrasz casts Mostrasz's Vision
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|Stay on the ground, and stay hidden. I'll port you back here if you get into any trouble!}}

* If you do something or cause something wrong, Mostrasz will say the following:
:;Not Stealthed
:{{Text|bossemote|Don't forget to use your stealth!}}

:;Away from Ravenholdt Manor
:*{{text|whisper|Mostrasz|Where are you going? The manor is in the other direction!}}
:*{{text|whisper|Mostrasz|Hmm...Doesn't look like there's anything over here. Try circling around to the back of the manor.}}

:;Caught
Ravenhold guards:
*{{Text|say|I see you, fool!}}
*{{Text|say|Thief. Thief!}}
*{{Text|say|Over here - get him!}}

Mostrasz will teleport the rogue back to him:
:*{{text|say|Mostrasz|I've got you! That was close...}}
:*{{text|say|Mostrasz|You need to be careful - they're on full alert!}}
:*{{text|say|Mostrasz|Well, that got ugly...You're lucky I'm here.}}
:*{{text|say|Mostrasz|You weren't trying to pick their pockets were you?}}
:*{{text|say|Mostrasz|Gotcha! Let's try that again...}}
:*{{text|say|Mostrasz|Are you crazy? They'll see you if you go flying in there!}}
:*{{text|say|Mostrasz|You can't fly here! We'll be spotted for sure!}}

;Sneaking
:{{text|whisper|Mostrasz|That's it... you've got this... keep it up...}}
:{{text|whisper|Mostrasz|Careful! The front door is too heavily guarded. Hmmm - Circle around the back of the manor and maybe we can find another way in.}}
[[Winstone Wolfe]] and sentries stand guard. Continue past [[Master Kang]] to the back of the manor and find a [[Convenient Rope]].
:{{text|whisper|Mostrasz|Ah-hah! There are no guards back here. Maybe you can find a way up onto the roof?}}
:{{text|whisper|Mostrasz|Nice work! Is there a window open up there? Look around!}}
Find the [[Unsecured Vent]].
:{{text|whisper|Mostrasz|You did it! You're in! Now... where would they be keeping the egg? Someplace dark, I would imagine. Be careful!}}
Jump down to avoid [[Fahrad]]. Continue to the basement where a cutscene starts.
:{{text|say|{{NPC||Wrathion}}|That's right, mortal. The prize you seek no longer sleeps within a shell. Here I am: in the flesh.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I'm not some trophy for a red dragon's mantle-piece, and I'm never going back.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Don't look so surprised! We dragons are conscious, even within our shells. As I grew, I could hear the plotting and scheming. I was to be born a prisoner.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|But I'm one-of-a-kind! A black dragon raised free from the taint of my father's corruption. And that's how I intend to stay: free.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Somehow, you managed to elude all of my guards. You slipped in here like a ghost. That makes you ... valuable to me. Let's talk.}}
:{{text|say|{{NPC||Fahrad}}|Your highness, we caught this beast snooping around the caves just outside the compound.}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|I'm not afraid of you! Wait - who - who are you?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|You don't recognize your former prisoner?}}
:{{text|say|Fahrad|Shall we execute him, my prince?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|No. I want him to deliver a message to the red dragonflight.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Tell them that I am free of my father's madness, and I will be free of them as well. I am to be left alone: this will be my first and only warning.}}
:{{text|say|Mostrasz|But... But Deathwing's minions may have you killed...}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Deathwing's minions should be afraid of ME. Get him out of here.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|And Fahrad?}}
:{{text|say|Fahrad|Yes sir?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Break his legs.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Now then, my new friend. We have much to talk about.}}

Cutscene ends, but Wrathion's dialogue continues.
:{{text|say|Wrathion|As you know, Black Dragons frequently disguise themselves as humanoids in order to tamper with mortal affairs.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|While the house of my mad father collapses around him, the few remaining Black Dragons have gone into hiding.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|But I can still sense them. My cowardly brothers and sisters will cause untold suffering if we allow them to stay in the shadows.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Moreover, they are a threat to me.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|That's where you come in. Help us to slay them all, and I will reward you handsomely.}}
:{{text|say|Fahrad|Your first target is here, in the [[ruins of Gilneas]]. I've lost some of my best men already: let's see if you can fare any better.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|The dragon you're looking for goes by the name "Creed."}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|He's deluded a group of diseased humans into thinking they can take their land back. He's poisoned their blood with his own draconic essence.}}
:{{text|say|Fahrad|If he succeeds in looting the whole of Gilneas, there's no telling where he'll hide next. Now is the time to strike.}}

At this point in the questline, the rogue stops serving the [[red dragonflight]] and begins aiding [[Ravenholdt]] and its employer, [[Wrathion]].
