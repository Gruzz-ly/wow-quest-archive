Kill Zephyrus.
* [[Zephyrus]] slain
* Suggested Players [3]
* [[The Durnholde Challenge]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Durnholde Keep]] has always been a place of strife. For years the humans used it as an [[internment camp]] and prison for the [[orc]]s. After that it was taken over by the [[Syndicate]]. Now? [[Sylvanas Windrunner|The Dark Lady]] captured and placed powerful elementals within its walls. She charged me with administering "The Durnholde Challenge." Any that can defeat all of the elementals will earn a grand prize! Take this guide and face your first challenge: Zephyrus!

Durnholde is located just northeast of us.

==Completion==
Zephyrus was a mighty adversary. Surely the remaining elementals will challenge you further!

<You open the guide that Jekyll gave to you.>
