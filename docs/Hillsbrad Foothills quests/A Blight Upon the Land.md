==Objectives==
Take the Head of [[Warden Stillwater]].
*[[Head of Warden Stillwater]]

==Description==
With the [[undead]] outbreak contained, the time has come for Stillwater and his followers to answer for their crimes. Though we averted a tragedy the likes of which has not been seen since the [[Scourge]] invaded, we must ensure that such a thing can never happen again. They will all face true death!

Come, <name>! I will have Stillwater's head!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Stillwater's Signet|Stillwater's Cloak|Stillwater's Dagger}}

==Progress==
Do not waste my time, <name>.

==Completion==
I will deliver this head to the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]] personally. Of course I will make mention of your part in all of this, <name>.

As for your reward - take from Stillwater's cache whatever you desire. You earned it.
