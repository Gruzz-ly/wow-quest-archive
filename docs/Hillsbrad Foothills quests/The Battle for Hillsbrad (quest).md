==Objectives==
Deliver the Battle for Hillsbrad to [[Warden Stillwater]] at the [[Sludge Fields]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].
*[[The Battle for Hillsbrad]] (provided)

==Description==
The journal documents the last 62 days of [[Clerk Horrace Whitesteed]]'s life. In it is written damning allegations against Warden Stillwater and his activities at the Sludge Fields.

You should show this to the warden. He will undoubtedly have an explanation for what is written in this journal. 

==Progress==
What's this?

==Completion==
<Warden Stillwater flips through the journal, reading under his breath.>

Ramblings of a mad man! Clearly he had been ingesting the mushrooms. It is good that you brought this to me, <name>. I will burn it myself!

==Progression==
