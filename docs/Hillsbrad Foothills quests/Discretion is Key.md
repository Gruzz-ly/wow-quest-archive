==Objectives==
Kill Citizen Wilkes and Clerk Horrace Whitesteed.
*[[Citizen Wilkes]] slain
*[[Clerk Horrace Whitesteed]] slain

==Description==
We must destroy all of the evidence, <name>! Did I say evidence? I meant crazed undead! Anyway, discretion is key. We must not let the rampaging undead make it out of the [[Sludge Fields]] and no one outside of this institution must know about what happened here!

Directly southeast of here in what used to be the old mushroom farm you'll find a reanimated fiend known as Citizen Wilkes and his cohort, Clerk Horrace Whitsteed. They have been causing huge problems for my guards. Find them and kill them!

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Citizen Wilkes' Ring
|Clerk Whitesteed's Cloak
|Crossbow of the Twice-Slain}}

==Progress==
Kill the beasts! We can't have a rampaging [[geist]] and skeleton wandering the countryside!

==Completion==
Well done! Wilkes was hanged after we discovered that he was ingesting mass quantities of mushrooms and other highly toxic substances. After he died he awoke, reborn as an undead geist. Many of my guards fell to Wilkes before he ran off into hiding. Fearing something like this might happen again, we incinerated the Clerk until only bones were left!

Why would they willingly ingest toxic substances? I have no idea! This is a farm, sir, nothing more!

== Notes ==
Clerk Horrace Whitesteed drops {{loot|common|The Battle for Hillsbrad (starter)|The Battle for Hillsbrad}} for [[The Battle for Hillsbrad]].
