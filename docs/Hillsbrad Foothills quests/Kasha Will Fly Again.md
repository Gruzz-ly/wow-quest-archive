==Objectives==
Gather 8 Mudsnout Blossoms.
* [[Mudsnout Blossom]] (8)

==Description==
[[Kasha]] will fly again, <name>. She must if we are to claim vengeance! Sadly, [[Kingslayer Orkus|Orkus]] must stay here with Kasha. You must help us. I beg of you!

Listen carefully, quest giver. When I first arrived here I flew around for days to learn the lay of the land. There is a farm east of here that as long since been abandoned and is now overrun by gnolls. On this farm grows a special type of mushroom known as the mudsnout. Go to the stead and gather mudsnout for Kasha. Return here when your pack is full.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:

==Progress==
Have you recovered the mudsnout?

==Completion==
This mushroom is toxic to living things, but provides a restorative boost to the undead. Let us see how Kasha reacts.

While on the farm, kill any [[Mudsnout Gnoll]] or [[Mudsnout Shaman]] to get the quest [[Terrible Little Creatures]].
