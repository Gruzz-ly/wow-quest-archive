==Objectives==
Defeat Elder Cassaphine at the base of [[Amirdrassil]].
*[[Elder Cassaphine]] slain
*Meet [[Merithra]] at the [[Firebreach]].

==Description==
The [[Druids of the Flame]] pose more of a threat than I realized. Not only do they let [[Fyrakk]] and his forces pour into the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]], but they also tempt the Dream's denizens to the flame!

We cannot dwell on how this happened. It pains me greatly, but Elder Cassaphine must be stopped.

Go with [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] and... end the dryad.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fearless Faerie's Mace
|Spirited Stag's Chopper
|Chartreuse Champion's Bulwark
|Summer Soother's Implement
|Spirited Stag's Branch
|Fearless Faerie's Glaive
|Chartreuse Champion's Blade
|Chartreuse Champion's Warspear
|Spirited Stag's Handaxe
|Summer Soother's Mallet
}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*15x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
The Emerald Dream is a place of wild [[nature]], [[magic]], and [[life]].

It saddens me to see one of ours come to this end. I hope that she is not the first of many.

Wait... do you hear that?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The [[Night elf|kaldorei]] have intercepted Elder Cassaphine at the edge of Amirdrassil. We will strike her down, if we must, Merithra.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Go, Tyrande. And you as well, <name>. Though it pains me to lose yet another friend, we have no time and no choice.}}

Head to the [[Firebreach]] at {{co|50.5|71.3|Emerald Dream (zone)}} to join Tyrande and her two [[Sentinel of the New Moon|Sentinels of the New Moon]]. Attack the dryad:
:{{Text|say|Elder Cassaphine|The lords of fire return and bring new life!}}

Kill her:
:{{Text|say|Elder Cassaphine|You... fight for... ashes...}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|I am sorry, my friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|What tempted them to the flame? Why do they embrace it and deny our people a home?}}

A few paces away are Merithra and [[Alexstrasza]]. Turning in the quest changes the skybox to a fiery one.
