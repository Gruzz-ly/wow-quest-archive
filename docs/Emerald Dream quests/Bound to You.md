==Objectives==
Ask Shae'lune about the cleansing the stones.
*Ask [[Shae'lune]] about the stones
*Ask [[Cyanthesa]] to cleanse the stones
*[[Vial of Moonwell Water]]
*[[Spirit Stone|First Spirit]] Released
*Second Spirit Released
*Third Spirit Released
*Defeat the [[Angered Dream Spirit]]
*Fourth Spirit Released
*Meet Lilian back at the Haven Cascades camp.

==Description==
I haven't worked with [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] long, but... it's unusual for her to act like that.

But it doesn't matter.

While she deals with logistics, you and I should go ahead and find a way to cleanse these stones.

Maybe Shae'lune knows what to do next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 7,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Completion==
It will be hard to deal with these stones if Shandris is off somewhere.

==Notes==
Shae'lune is next to Lilian:
:Do you need my help, mortal?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Can you help us purify these stones?}}
:{{Text|say|Shae'lune|My sister, [[Cyanthesa]], knows all about rocks and stones. She would probably know what to do with them.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|I will head to the moonwell. See you there, <name>.}}
:''Lilian hops on a bat and flies off.''

Find Cyanthesa on the lower part of the Cascades.
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|I have placed the stones where you asked. Now what?}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|Now you move out of the circle, and I wait for Shandris.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Shandris isn't coming, but <name> can help with the ritual.}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|Shandris is not ... I see.}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|<Name>, come speak to me once you are ready to begin the purification ritual.}}

Before speaking with Cyanthesa, Lilian has gossip:
{{book|content=
The dryads don't like me, and they don't really hide it.

That's okay by me. I like knowing where I stand--even if it's in the dog house.

I thought Shandris was different. Maybe I was wrong.
}}

Speak with Cyanthesa:
{{book|content=
I understand that we need the help, but...

<Cyanthesa looks at Lilian with noticeable revulsion.>

I sure hope that this General Shandris knows what she is doing.

{{Gossip|quest=|Let's start the ritual.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|Get the vial by the moonwell and use it on the stones in order. My voice will guide the spirits to freedom.}}

Grab the [[Vial of Moonwell Water]] from the nearby moonwell, then approach the first Spirit Stone to make the Vial of Moonwell Water extra action button visible. Use it:
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|Rise now, leaf spirit. You are free to roam the Dream!}}
:''A [[Cleansed Dream Spirit]] appears and flies into the wild.''

Repeat the process with the second Spirit Stone:
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|Rise now, wolf spirit. The moonlight will again shine upon you.}}
:''Another Cleansed Dream Spirit appears for a brief time, howling, then disappears.''

And the third Stone:
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|Rise, bear spirit, and--}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|An angry dream spirit! Watch out!}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|Unfortunately, being bound to a stone cage can do that to spirits.}}<!-- Didn't show up. -->

The Angered Dream Spirit attacks, so fend it off. Upon defeat, it turns {{Rep|unfriendly}} and runs away.

Use the extra action button on the fourth and final Spirit Stone:
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|What is this? This stone... it is damaged, cracked.}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|I am sorry, <name>. But if there was a spirit in this stone, it is no longer there.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|No longer there? Where is it then?}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|Anywhere from a petal or stone... to someone it felt connected to.}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|I sense fear, pain, and great trauma in it. It will require great care to free this spirit.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Shandris will know what to do.}}
:{{Text|say|Cyanthesa|Keep the vial of moonwell water--you are going to need it.}}
:''Lilian turns back and walks away.''

Before Lilian walks off, she has new gossip:
{{book|content=
Of course one of the dream spirits is missing.

This couldn't just be easy, could it?
}}

As does Cyanthesa:
{{book|content=
The ritual is the same for all bounded spirits.

It warms my heart to see these spirits roam the dream once again.

{{A Call to Aid}}

==PTR version==
;Description
:[[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] really must be tired. She has never raised her voice like that to me before.
:Doesn't matter. Everyone has bad days.
:While she deals with... logistics, you and I should go ahead and find a way to cleanse these stones.
:Maybe Shae'lune knows what to do next.
;Completion
:Is Shandris gone? Where did she go?

;Lilian's gossip
{{book|content=
These dryads didn't like me since we started working with them. This one is even giving me the stink eye without the slight attempt of hiding it.

The only one who treated me right was Shandris. Which is why our last conversation hit a nerve. I may be looking too much into things.
