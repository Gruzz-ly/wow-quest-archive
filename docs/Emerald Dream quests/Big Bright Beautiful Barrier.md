==Objectives==
Collect 6 Barrier Fragments in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].
* [[Barrier Fragment|Barrier fragments]] (6)
* Barrier healed {{co|28.0|31.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* Speak with [[Suzska]]

==Description==
[[Buri]]? [[Vyranoth]]?

Once she left us at the mercy of [[Fyrakk]], we had no choice but to follow him. I do not know what his plan is, but he ordered me and these [[Primalists]] to bring down this barrier.

We have made little progress, but Vyranoth will want us to slow him down.

Some fragments of the barrier have chipped away. If you collect them, we can channel their energy back into the shield.

Can I trust you to undo the damage that I have done?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Summer Soother's Leggings]]
*[[Fearless Faerie's Trousers]]
*[[Spirited Stag's Legguards]]
*[[Chartreuse Champion's Legplates]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Thank you for preventing his onslaught.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Suzska|After Vyranoth left, Fyrakk separated any who might be loyal to her.}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|I was sent here to attack the barrier. I do not know where [[Terro]] and Buri are.}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|But Fyrakk still trusted [[Lethka]], and sent her to detonate the [[Cinder Summit]]. She readily accepted.}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|Once the barrier is gone, Fyrakk will reach the [[Wellspring of Life|Wellspring]] and convert its [[life]] [[magic]] to flame.}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|Lethka was always trouble, now she is dangerous.}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|We have damaged the barrier, but I think we can undo some of it.}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|The wayward barrier magic can be channeled to restore it.}}

Pick up six [[Barrier Fragment]] crystals (rogues can pick them up in stealth), then head to the marked spot in the middle of the platform and use the extra action button:
:{{abilities|Heal Barrier|Send the collected fragments back into the barrier to heal it.}}

Check in with Suzska:
:{{gossip|quest=|The barrier has been repaired.}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|We should regroup with the others and stop Lethka.}}
:''Suzska flies off.''
