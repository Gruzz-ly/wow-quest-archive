==Objectives==
Use The Dreamer's Essence on 5 Emerald Preservers. Then, meet [[Ysera]] inside the temple in the [[Eye of Ysera]].
* [[Emerald Preserver]]s imbued (5)
* Check in on Ysera
* [[The Dreamer's Essence]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Galok Wingslicer|Galok]] is but another one of [[Fyrakk]]'s minions. I will not be baited by his bluster.

The fire orb must be his doing. Its magic threatens to overwhelm the Eye. Ysera is channeling a shield from inside the temple, but it doesn't seem to be as effective as we expected.

Now, I must confront Galok. Use my magic to bolster our casters if they weaken. The defense must not fall!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Luscious Leaf Loop]]
* [[Summer Sky Signet]]
* [[Bramble Bark Band]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
With haste, <name>! Our defenders are in pain.

==Completion==
Mother is struggling...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Merithra|You will never take the Eye!}}
:{{text|say|Galok Wingslicer|Is that a no? Then burn!}}
:''Galok channels a flame spell into the orb, vastly expanding its power, then has his proto-drake fly off.''

Use the provided quest item on the five Emerald Preservers:
:{{text|say|Emerald Preserver|Thank you. We will hold fast against the [[djaradin]] and their magic.}}
:{{text|say|Emerald Preserver|Temper their flames, and our enemies cannot touch us. We have the high ground!}}
:{{text|say|Emerald Preserver|This bastion was created in Ysera's name. Long may it stand!}}
:{{text|say|Emerald Preserver|The Eye's energies are directly tied to the Dream all around us.}}
:{{text|say|Emerald Preserver|The Eye is the font that nourishes [[Amirdrassil]]. It must be protected!}}

After the fifth:
:{{text|say|Merithra|For all his bluster, he fled when he saw we had gathered here.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|But that does not mean he will not return. We must--}}
:{{text|say|[[Gerithus]]|Go, Mother. Check on Grandmother. I will hold the defense here.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Thank you, son. <Name>, come with me to the temple. Ysera is inside.}}
:''Merithra runs in.''

[[Gerithus]] has new gossip at this point:
{{book|content=
We've stabilized the fire, but it threatens to overwhelm us given any opportunity. With Merithra's imbuement, the preservers and I can hold the line for now.

But my grandmother, Ysera, is the key. If Ysera is compromised, this shield will most certainly fall. This is Ysera's domain, but I only sense a tiny fraction of her power being utilized.
}}

Ysera is inside and has the Ysera's Ward buff. Speak with her:
{{book|content=
<Ysera's hands shake. Her forehead is lined with sweat, and her jaw set with effort.>

Please leave me, <name>. I must stay attuned to the Eye to maintain our shield.
}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Mother? Good news. The Eye is stabilized, but--}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|...Mother?}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|It is not... working. Why does it reject me?}}

On complete:
:''[[Bodwin]] flies in.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|The Eye is my problem to solve, dear daughter.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Faithful Bodwin brings news. Follow him. Lead your flight.}}

==Progression==
