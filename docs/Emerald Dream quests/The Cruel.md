==Objectives==
Help Merithra close the flaming portal.
*Help [[Merithra]] close [[Flame Portal|flame portal]]
*Take Dream Portal (Optional)
*Meet Merithra on the road outside the [[Fields of Reverie]].

==Description==
[[Primalists]], [[djaradin]], and [[Druids of the Flame]] all work together against us.

But I can sense that this is not the last of them. Something powerful is trying to come through this portal. Let us try to seal them out for as long as we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
I am glad you made it out. We have no choice but to retreat to the tree, before [[Fyrakk]]'s forces arrive.

And [[Elder Cassaphine]]... I fear that she has already been lost to this [[prophecy]] of flame.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Merithra|As quickly as I close their portals, more come.}}

Interact with the portal to close it.
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Look out!}}
:''The [[adventurer]] is knocked back and stunned. [[Igira]] and a group of djaradin appear.''
:{{Text|say|Igira the Cruel|Behold the weapons of [[shadowflame]]... and your end.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Follow me! Take the portal, now!}}
:{{Text|say|Igira the Cruel|Fly, little [[dragon]]. My greatest creation will cleave your wings.}}
:''Igira starts casting Devastating Blow.''

Take the Dream Portal to avoid the spell and be teleported to [[Shoreline Roots]] where [[Cenarius]] and Merithra await.

==Progression==
{{Enter the Dream}}
