'''Dragon Keeping''' concludes the "Misfit Dragons" optional storyline of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Vyranoth]] and complete the Storm the Halls of Valor scenario.
*Speak with Vyranoth to go to the Halls of Valor
*Complete Scenario: Storming the Halls of Valor

==Description==
First he opposes [[dragonkin]]d, then he enslaves them, denying them their birthrights.

We shall visit these so-called "[[Halls of Valor]]," defeat any who oppose us, and liberate the storm drakes from that which binds them.

Come along.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]
* [[Grotto Netherwing Drake]]
* [[Pact of the Netherwing]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]
* 8x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Progress==
These dragons will be freed.

==Completion==
The Thorignir are free of that wretched keeper's influence for now--and hopefully for good.

==Notes==
Speak with Vyranoth:
:Come, <name>.

:We go to these so-called "Halls of Valor".

:{{Gossip|quest=|I am ready to go.}}

This starts the "Storm the Halls of Valor" scenario:

===Stage 1: Pass Hymdall===
:Defeat Hymdall.
*Defeat [[Hymdall]]
:{{Text|say|[[Wrathion]]|The Halls of Valor host some of Odyn's most trusted allies.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Allies? Enforcers and slaves, more likely.}}
:''Vyranoth shifts to her proto-dragon form and starts flying around.''
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Come, whelps. We shall confront this "guardian" Hymdall.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|I expect this will be interesting.}}

In the scenario, the character has the Wrathion's Entourage buff.

Up ahead are [[Valarjar Champion (Storming the Halls of Valor)|Valarjar Champions]] and [[Valarjar Thundercaller (Storming the Halls of Valor)|Valarjar Thundercallers]]. Wrathion will help tank them in combat. After the third wave, Vyranoth spots a [[Storm Drake (Storming the Halls of Valor)|Storm Drake]]:
:{{Text|yell|Vyranoth|Child of storms! You need not be slave to your rider!}}
:{{Text|yell|Vyranoth|Rise and be free!}}

A [[Valarjar Stormrider]] attempts to hop on, but Vyranoth kills it and the Storm Drake rides away. Push forward to [[Hymdall]]:
:{{Text|yell|Hymdall|I will be the judge now.}}
*{{Text|yell|Hymdall|Drake riders, I call upon your aid!}}
*{{Text|yell|Hymdall|Storm drakes! At my side!}}
:{{Text|yell|Hymdall|The blood of the unworthy will flow through these halls!}}

:{{Text|bossemote|Hymdall blows the {{text|red|[Horn of Valor]}} summoning Storm Drakes!}}
:{{Text|yell|Vyranoth|Thorignir! You need not heed this construct's call!}}
:{{Text|yell|Hymdall|Let your worth be measured in blood!}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Odyn believed dragons unworthy protectors, unless they were bound by his command!}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|You are worthy in your own right!}}

Should the adventurer be killed:
:{{Text|yell|Hymdall|My vigil continues.}}

Knock Hymdall down to 10% health, and he will stop the encounter and turn {{Rep|friendly}}:
:{{Text|yell|Hymdall|A battle well fought! The path forward is open.}}
:''Hymdall kneels.''

===Stage 2: Pass Eyir===
:Pass Eyir and her shield maidens.
*Get past [[Eyir]]'s Shield maidens.
Continue forth, new enemies include [[Stormforged Sentinel]]s, [[Valarjar Runecarver (Storming the Halls of Valor)|Valarjar Runecarvers]], [[Valarjar Mystic]]s, and [[Valarjar Shieldmaiden (Storming the Halls of Valor)|Valarjar Shieldmaidens]].

Inside, Vyranoth has shifted back to her visage form:
:{{Text|say|Eyir|Dragon! Prepare to face my wrath!}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Stay your hand, valkyr{{sic}}. This is a matter between my kind and your master.}}
:{{Text|say|Eyir|Honor compels me to stop you, dragon.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Then you have more honor than Odyn.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|The same honor that the Thorignir hold. They remain here though they are called to a greater cause--protecting [[Azeroth]].}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Stand aside, Eyir. This matter does not involve you.}}

Keep defeating waves of shieldmadens until Eyir has had enough:
:{{Text|say|Eyir|Shieldmaidens, stand down!}}

===Stage 3: Cross Bridge===
:Enter the Hall of Glory.
*[[Odyn]]'s arena entered.

Continue through the Ephemeral Way to Odyn.
:{{Text|say|Eyir|May your battle prove worthy, dragon.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|And yours as well, should you ever choose that path. Your arrogant keeper has not treated his servants with respect... or truth.}}

On the bridge:
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|When I told you of Odyn, I didn't expect such an... explosive response.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|A likely story, whelp. You knew I would not abide such hypocrisy.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Well, I--}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Own it and just be glad I have not eaten everyone here. I am being diplomatic.}}

===Stage 4: Confront Odyn===
:Confront Odyn.
*Confront Odyn
In the throne room are [[King Haldor]], [[King Ranulf]], [[King Bjorn]], and [[King Tor]]. Go to the center of the arena and use the Confront Odyn extra action button.

:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Ah, Odyn! We'd like to have a word with you. Several, actually.}}
:{{Text|emote|King Ranulf shifts awkwardly and looks at the others.}}
:{{Text|say|Odyn|Most impressive! I never thought I would meet anyone who could match the Valarjar's strength--}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Save your words, keeper. Are you really too cowardly to face us yourself?}}
:{{Text|say|Odyn|Impudent whelp! You dare insult the ruler of the Valarjar? Face me, then!}}
:''Odyn jumps down and aggroes. The kings run away.''
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Coward. Hypocrite. Liar!}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|You come to this world, and demand its children bow to you? You dare?}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|You claimed dragons were not fit to protect Azeroth, yet you bound them as your servants!}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|You call them "born of [[god]]s," and claim ownership of their greatness!}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|The Thorignir were and are great without you. Their honor keeps them bound here, but you have never earned it!}}

Get Odyn to 80% health and [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|an in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|-ApmskPOZkQ}}
:{{Text|say|Odyn|Enough of this foolishness!}}
:{{Text|say|Odyn|<grunts>}}
:''Odyn blasts and knocks back Wrathion and the adventurer. Vyranoth steps forward.''
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|I agree.}}
:''Vyranoth encasts Odyn in a block of ice.''
:{{Text|say|Odyn|<grunts>}}
:''Vyranoth turns and addresses the present dragons.''
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Dragons of the storm! You are true dragons, not constructs beholden to an unworthy keeper! You are free to choose your own path.}}
:''Vyranoth shifts into her dragon form.''
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|If you wish it, there is a home for you on the Dragon Isles. Join your kin and claim your birthright!}}
:''Vyranoth ascends and flies away. The storm dragons follow suit and so does Wrathion and the adventurer.''

After the cutscene, the player and several new arrivals are found in the [[Central Encampment]]. More dragons are in [[Thaldraszus]]'s cave above the [[Sand-Lost Sanctum]].
