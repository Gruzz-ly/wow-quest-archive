==Objectives==
Speak to the [[Flame-Disguised Dreamkin]] to gather intel on the [[Druids of the Flame]].
*Dreamkin intel gathered (5)

==Description==
You again! Well, you must be here to help, correct?

Absolutely you are. Why would you not? This development is so exciting. What could these desolating [[druid]]s be up to?

Fortunately, a few of my friends have infiltrated the druids. I'm sure they have quite the story to tell.

Go forth, my curious companion and bring back exciting news!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Change has come to the dream and yet we are so quick to snuff it out.

How unnaturally boring.

==Completion==
Well now, this IS interesting, isn't it?

<Q'onzu shudders as they tap their feet rapidly in excitement.>

You must be fascinated by this too, <name>?

Oh, how silly of me. Of course you are!

==Notes==
Find and speak with the fiery wildkin:
:<The Fiery Dreamkin looks at you in surprise.>

:{{Gossip|Q'onzu is interested in what you have learned about the Druids of the Flame.}}
:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::The dreamless druids come but they no burn. They watch the plants. They change the plants.

:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::They harvest the seeds and roots with fire. But fire no burn. Fire blooms!

:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::Through dream and flame, a fledgling flower! It sprouts and blooms. Blooms of destruction!

:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::It burns, it burns. The flowers peak burns! From roots through petals, the fires bloom!

:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::From blooms to wind, the pollen soars. Through beasts and plant, the burning spreads.

::{{Gossip|quest=|I will report this to Q'onzu.}}

:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::Druids no burn, but yes, they learn! They watch the plants! They change the plants!

:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::They harvest the seeds, the roots and the bark. Infused with flame, but leave no mark!

:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::Through dream and flame, new life is made. A spark of fire, a spark of change!

:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::The pollen burns, the flowers turn! From root through stem, the cinders bloom!

:*Q'onzu, Q'onzuuu!

::Some druids rejoice! A change is made! New change for plants and soon, the beasts!

The [[Mark of Q'onzu]] was planned to be provided for the quest during the PTR.
