==Description==
[[Amirdrassil]] is growing and needs nourishment. Dear old [[Sprucecrown]] has a ritual to bloom life around the tree, but our enemies have taken note. We need all the help we can get.

During the ritual, Sprucecrown will draw on the [[magic]] of [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] to grow Dreamfruit. Consuming these will grant you amazing powers. Only a few of these powerful and delicious fruits can appear. Keep an eye out for them!

Pray lend a hand, hero, and the dream will reward you aplenty.
