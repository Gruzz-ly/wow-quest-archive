'''The Burning Barrow''' begins the second chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]], Druids of the Flame.

==Objectives==
Find [[Tyrande]] near the [[Sor'theril Barrow Den]].

==Description==
[[Fyrakk]]'s forces have already set their plans in motion. We are one step behind, and we need to catch up quickly if we are to properly protect [[Amirdrassil]].

While you were on your way here, we received word of suspicious-looking figures entering one of the nearby [[barrow den]]s. Tyrande already went to investigate. Seek her out and lend her your aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}

==Completion==
Your arrival is timely, <class>. I require another set of hands.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Haven Cascades]] to find Tyrande healing [[Singed Sister]]s.
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Help is on the way. Rest assured, we will save as many as we can.}}

She has new gossip here:
:Barrow dens are meant to be places of rest and communion. To attack one in the heart of the Dream itself is more than merely wicked. It is cruel.

==Progression==
{{Druids of the Flame}}
