==Objectives==
Collect documents & kill Druids of the Flame within the [[Smoldering Copse]].
*[[Singed Leaflet]] (6)
*[[Druids of the Flame]] Slain (8)
*Return to [[Solarys Thorngale|Solarys]] at the [[Central Encampment]].

==Description==
<Strategic documents are scattered around [[Lyandris Thorngale|Lyandris]]. Notes detailing experiments and future assault locations covering many of them.>

<It would be of great use to your allies to find more of these documents. Thinning out the Flame's numbers wouldn't hurt either.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Bounty of the Fallen Defector]]
* 3x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
What is it?

==Completion==
Lyandris saved all this? And you... you finished what she started.

Thank you for returning her journal to me. Keep the documents. They will provide valuable information to you and your allies.

They would only be a grim reminder to me.

==Notes==
Mobs that count are [[Smoldering Thaumaturge]]s, [[Cinderclaw Stalker]]s, [[Molten Runebear]]s, [[Incendiary Runebear]]s, [[Smoldering Enforcer]], [[Smoldering Raven]]s, and [[Fanatical Ritualist]]s.

:{{Text|say|Solarys Thorngale|Thank goodness you made it, Brother. I could not stand the thought of being truly alone again.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Kery'nael Thorngale]]|Nor could I. I wish the rest of the Flame could see their own madness, but they would not care.}}
:{{Text|say|Kery'nael Thorngale|They are too preoccupied with reclaiming [[immortal]]ity, something we are too young to have ever known.}}
:{{Text|say|Solarys Thorngale|How could something so foreign break us apart like this?}}
:{{Text|say|Solarys Thorngale|We lost more of our family! This is not what we wanted!}}
:{{Text|say|Solarys Thorngale|After all we've done, Kery, what do we do now?}}
:{{Text|say|Kery'nael Thorngale|Lyandris, she would want us to heal, I think. Perhaps we should focus on that.}}
