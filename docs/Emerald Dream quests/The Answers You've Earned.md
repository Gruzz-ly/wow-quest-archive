==Description==
Ah, that's much better. Now I can think.

What did you want, again? Oh yes! Questions.

Ask away, if you must.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Tangled Yarn of Secrets]]
* [[Feather of Friends]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]
* 5x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Completion==
<Q'onzu and their followers have gone. This must be the answer they deemed you deserved.

For now, at least.>

==Notes==
Speak with Q'onzu again:
:Go ahead then. Ask your questions.

:{{Gossip|How old are you?}}
:{{Gossip|Where have you been?}}
:{{Gossip|Why do you call yourself a [[loa]]?}}
:{{Gossip|Have you been in the Dream this whole time?}}
:{{Gossip|What do you have the power to change?}}
:{{Gossip|So, what's the deal with all the [[dreamkin]]?}}
:{{Gossip|Do you know [[Bwonsamdi]]?}}
:{{Gossip|Are you always this annoying?}}
:{{Gossip|Are you actually going to answer or are you just going to-}}

Choosing any option progresses the quest in the same way:
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|You see, the problem is that I've already lived my own life.}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|As such, I find recounting these things quite redundant. Repetitive.}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|Boring.}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|If you really care to know so much about my life, why don't you ask the others? The [[Wild God]]s, I mean.}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|I'm sure they have plenty of stories about me.}}

Afterward, they won't budge:
:Go on, then. I've said enough.

Return to Cenarius.
:{{Gossip|quest=|Q'onzu told me to ask other people about their story.}}
::As expected. I should not have expected them to make anything easy.

::I can think of a few folk who might know more about Q'onzu's past.

::I believe Q'onzu has some history with Aviana. Perhaps she may be able to shed some light.

::[[Ysera]] would also certainly have much to say, but she is quite busy. Aessina, however, is close with Ysera. Perhaps she knows something.

::A denizen of the Dream would be my final suggestion. A dryad, perhaps?

Speak with Aviana at {{Co|49.7|65.9|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:
:What do you require, mortal?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you know anything about Q'onzu?}}
::Don't get me started on that good-for-nothing [[Somnowl|owl]].

::Refusing our call to assist against the [[Druids of the Flame]] is not the first time they have shown cowardice in the face of evil. They claim that their domain requires them to stay out of such conflicts, but I find it convenient how their choices always lead to their own comfort.

::Surely they're up to their old tricks again. I'm still trying to figure out who allowed them back into the Dream!

::I do not wish to speak about Q'onzu any longer. Begone from me, mortal.

Speak with Aessina at {{Co|52.5|66.6|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:
:Yes, <class>?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you know anything about Q'onzu?}}
::Q'onzu? Ah, yes. Ysera is... quite familiar with that one. As familiar as one can be with such a creature.

::I'm afraid I know little for certain, but I believe that Q'onzu has always been in the Dream.

::There were once rumors that they dug their way out. Preposterous. They can change many things, but they cannot change the nature of this place.

The dryad in question are actually three [[Gossiping Dryad]]s at {{Co|53.2|63.1|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:
:Oh! Hello!

:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you know anything about Q'onzu?}}
:{{Text|say|Gossiping Dryad (1)|Q'onzu? The Wild God?}}
:{{Text|say|Gossiping Dryad (2)|Of course, the Wild God. Do you know any other Q'onzu?}}
:{{Text|say|Gossiping Dryad (3)|I heard they're demanding to be called a 'loa' these days.}}
:{{Text|say|Gossiping Dryad|That is so like them. Could never settle.}}
:{{Text|say|Gossiping Dryad|Weren't they imprisoned by Ysera?}}
:{{Text|say|Gossiping Dryad|No, no... I heard they were spending time hidden among the mortals!}}
:{{Text|say|Gossiping Dryad|Perhaps that's where they picked up "loa"!}}
:{{Text|say|Gossiping Dryad|Wonder what else they picked up there...}}

Return to Cenarius:
:{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell Cenarius of the rumors you heard.>}}
:Well then. Those can't all possibly be true.

:Return to Q'onzu. See if they'll at the very least confirm or deny what you've heard.

Then return to Whorlwing Basin, only to find it empty, with only a [[Single Feather]] remaining.

The storyline continues back at the [[Central Encampment]], where Cenarius next starts [[Sky Mother's Ire]].
