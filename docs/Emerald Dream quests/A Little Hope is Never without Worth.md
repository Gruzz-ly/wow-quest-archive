'''A Little Hope is Never without Worth''' is the final quest in a series of five that rewards the [[Reins of the Ochre Dreamtalon]] mount. To reach this point, players must have gone through at minimum 27 daily resets worth of waiting for the sprout to grow after completing the previous quests.

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Professor Ash]].

==Description==
The plant has matured and is thriving. And with this little corner of our ecosystem restored, we've seen something I've been wishing for since I learned what you were up to.

The Dreamtalon have returned with their kits!

One of the grateful mature dreamtalons has offered their services to you, if you wish it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18|}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* [[Reins of the Ochre Dreamtalon]]
* [[Delicately Curated Blossoms]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]
* 5x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Completion==
If you treat this Dreamtalon like you've treated this plant, they're very lucky indeed.

==Notes==
The Blooming Plant has gossip:
{{book|content=The plant's leaves spread wide, welcoming future generations of Dreamtalons to take refuge under its boughs.}}

Also in the area are a number of adult dreamtalons, dreamtalon kits, and dragonflies.

==Progression==
{{A Mix of Hope, Care, and Patience}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Hotfix|date=2024-01-18|bluenote=Players who found themselves unable to pick up "A Little Hope is Never without Worth" should return to the grove in the Emerald Dream to continue (provided the plant growth phase is complete).}}
* {{Patch 10.2.0|note=Added.}}
