==Objectives==
Uncover more information about [[Fyrakk]]'s plan in the [[Emerald Dream]].
* Investigate [[Scorching Chasm]] {{co|39.9|20.0|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* [[Terro]]'s corpse investigated
* [[Igneous Stonemauler]] slain

==Description==
I had no idea my old guard would be willing to return to my side. I am... I am happy to see them. When I chose to go to [[Alexstrasza]], I told no one. I simply left.

But we must learn more about Fyrakk's plan before pursuing personal matters. Let us see what else [[Buri]] can tell us.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Sunrise Circlet]]
*[[Perennial Pompon Pendant]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
If we could just find the other Claws...

==Completion==
Vyranoth will not rest until Terro is avenged.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Buri, what did Fyrakk say of his plan?}}
:{{text|say|Buri|He separated any of us he feared would be loyal to you early on.}}
:{{text|say|Buri|Fyrakk is fixated on the [[Wellspring of Life]], that is all I learned.}}
:{{text|say|Buri|Terro was with Fyrakk in a cave to the west not long ago.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Thank you, my friend.}}
:''Buri flies off, and Vyranoth runs a short distance, then sheds her visage and flies away as well.''

Enter the [[Scorching Chasm]]:
:{{Text|say|Buri|I will wait here.}}

Head northeast into the Scorching Chasm to find the corpse of [[Terro]] and an [[Igneous Stonemauler]]. Interact with the proto-dragon's corpse:

{{book|content=
Terro's lifeless body lay motionless atop the stone.

{{gossip|<Investigate Terro's body.>}}

<Terro's body is burned and badly beaten. 

Two puncture wounds on his neck delivered the killing blow. A bite, from a proto-dragon.

The wound is too small for Fyrakk. It came from someone much smaller.>
}}

:''The Igneous Stonemauler wakes up!''
:{{text|say|Igneous Stonemauler|Keep your hands off Lethka's prize!}}

Fend it off, and Vyranoth walks up while [[Lethka]] flies in.
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Lethka! What have you done?}}
:{{text|say|Lethka|I removed an obstacle.}}
:{{text|say|Lethka|You abandoned us to your regrets. Fyrakk continued on the path to victory.}}
:{{text|say|Lethka|Now, I have a mountain to explode.}}
:''Lethka flies off.''
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|I will stop Lethka! <Name>, take Buri and find Suzska.}}
:''Vyranoth transforms and follows her.''
