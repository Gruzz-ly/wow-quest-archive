==Objectives==
Use the Root Restoration Fruit to help heal [[Gracus]].
*[[Root Restoration Fruit]]
*Fruit Juice applied

==Description==
Gracus sent word for [[Ysera]] to come and see him. We arrived and found him in a dire condition. 

Our efforts to heal him so far have proved fruitless. But now that you are here, you can assist.

Gracus is of [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]]. Perhaps infusing his roots with something grown here will be the final thing we need to restore him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Gracus' condition is dire. We must do what we can to try to help.

==Completion==
I was so certain we could help.

Ysera seems to be sensing something here that I cannot. After all she has been through, it seems her magic has indeed changed beyond my recognition.

==Notes==
Find the [[Root Restoration Fruit]] directly to the south, then use it on Gracus:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Gracus... Your health has not improved.}}
:{{text|say|Gracus|It is all right, Alexstrasza.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|His time has come.}}
