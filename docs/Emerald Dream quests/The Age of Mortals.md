[[File:The Age of Mortals.jpg|thumb|Cenarius, empowered with the Horn of Cenarius]]

==Objectives==
Blow the Horn of [[Cenarius]] while next to heroes of [[Azeroth]] and slay [[Fyrakk]]'s forces.
* Empower heroes and slay enemies on the [[Field of Flames]] (0/100%)
*Meet [[Tyrande]] at [[Wellspring Overlook]].
* [[Horn of Cenarius (Dragonflight)]] (provided)

==Description==
Once again, the mortal [[race]]s have come together to defend a [[World Tree]]. It is only fitting then that we bolster their efforts with a relic from that past battle. The Horn of Cenarius.

I entrust the horn to you, <name>. Use it to bestow the blessings of Cenarius to our allies. With luck, it will allow us to break through [[Fyrakk]]'s forces and open a path to [[Wellspring of Life|the temple]].

And do not forget to lend your strength as well. Every enemy felled is one fewer between us and Fyrakk.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fearless Faerie's Shoulderpads
|Chartreuse Champion's Shoulderplates
|Summer Soother's Shoulders
|Spirited Stag's Epaulets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Our allies fight with the blessing of Cenarius! It is only a matter of time until Fyrakk's forces break their ranks and flee before us.

==Notes==
On accept, Tyrande mounts up and runs off.

Each hero empowered or non-elite enemy slain is worth 3%.

A great number of characters from across ''Warcraft'''s history are taking part in the battle, and many of them have something to say when empowered with the [[Horn of Cenarius]].
