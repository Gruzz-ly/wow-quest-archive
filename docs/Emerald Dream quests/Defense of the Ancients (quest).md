==Objectives==
Free the Ancients at [[Skystone Falls]].
* [[Gnarlroot]] assisted (3) {{co|39.1|35.4|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* [[Elderbranch]] assisted (3) {{co|39.2|32.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* [[Cloudsong]] assisted (3) {{co|41.2|34.4|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* [[Shadebough (ancient)|Shadebough]] assisted (3) {{co|38.9|34.3|Emerald Dream (zone)}}

==Description==
[[Fyrakk]]'s forces at Skystone Falls are already threatening to overwhelm us. I fear not even the combined might of the [[Sentinels]] and [[Ancient]]s can hold out against them.

The Ancients are bearing the brunt of the offensive. We have reports of [[djaradin]] attempting to capture them for some unknown purpose.

We cannot allow [[Igira]] to succeed in whatever nefarious plan she has in mind. You must seek out the Ancients on the battlefield and free any who are captured.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Summer Soother's Gown
|Chartreuse Champion's Chestplate
|Spirited Stag's Chestguard
|Fearless Faerie's Vest
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
The Ancients may be few, but they battle fiercely for our cause. Go, <name>. Help them.

==Completion==
Your aid has helped the Ancients stand against the djaradin, but for how long? How many more will be lost before this battle is done?

So much sacrificed for this war. So many fallen. Too many.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|[[Merithra]]|We must discover why [[Khadgar]] and our allies cannot reach us. I will seek out the Prophet.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alexstrasza]] the Life-Binder|Make haste, Merithra. Our forces will not last much longer.}}
:''Merithra flies off.''

Each ancient is held down by chains attached to three harpoons as well as a number of other djaradin and Primalists nearby. The harpoon-ropes are all that are counted for this quest, but the other unitsdrop the parchment scraps for the other one.

The three ancients on the ground will be freed normally:
:{{text|say|Gnarlroot|These djaradin cannot contain us!}}
:{{text|say|Elderbranch|At last! I must return to battle.}}
:{{text|say|Cloudsong|Thank you for the rescue, champion!}}

Shadebough, up on the floating island, gets caught by Ashendir and does not survive the flames:
:{{text|say|Shadebough|Thank you for your--}}
:{{text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|Let the world be reborn in flame!}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I cannot stand by any longer. I must join this fight.}}
:''The death toll has grown significantly as many corpses of sentinels and druids litter the camp.''

==Progression==
