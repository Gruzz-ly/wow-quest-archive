==Objectives==
Collect eight samples of Metamorphic Ash from [[Druids of the Flame]] in the [[Smoldering Copse]].
*Complete the events of "Enter the Dream"
*[[Metamorphic Soot]] (8)

==Description==
The Druids of the Flame practice virulent [[magic]]s that warp and burn all they touch. They do, however, have excellent taste in alchemical reagents.

If you should happen across any of their metamorphic ash, could you gather it up for me? One of my contacts within [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] has been asking after the stuff.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Alchemy Notes
}}

==Progress==
Ah, there you are! Have you managed to get your hands on any of that ash, yet? Its alchemical properties are truly wondrous.

==Completion==
Ah, wonderful! The things I will be able to accomplish with this... One does not simply walk into the [[Firelands]], after all!
