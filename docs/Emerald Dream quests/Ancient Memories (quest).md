'''Ancient Memories''' concludes the optional "Memory of the Dreamer" storyline in the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lingering Torment.jpg|Lingering Torment|A fearsome foe defeated by [[Gracus]] long, long ago in the [[Emerald Dream]].}}
Kill the Lingering Torment.
*[[Lingering Torment]] slain {{co|54.8|18.3|Emerald Dream (zone)}}

==Description==
Those dark memories cannot be allowed to fester in the Dream.

Unleashing them was necessary. Gracus needed to let go. But if they linger, they may become malevolent.

Defeat the memory that haunts him most so that Gracus can slumber at last.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|56|18}}
* 59,500 [[XP]]
* [[Branch of Gracus]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]
* [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]] x5
* [[Emerald Dewdrop]] x5

==Progress==
Gracus cannot truly rest until his memories have been calmed.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Gracus will be at peace now.

As will those who cared for him, it seems. It is not often people get a second chance to say goodbye.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Ysera]]|You must find the nightmares, <name>. When you do, defeat them, and Gracus will be soothed.}}

Head northwest to another floating island to find a memory of Gracus fighting the Torment, as memories of Gracus's loved ones are fighting off other enemies:
:{{text|say|Lingering Torment|I will flay this Dream into [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]]!}}
:{{text|say|Lingering Torment|I will not... be... forgotten...}}

Return to Ysera to find a [[Burial Mound (Emerald Dream)|Burial Mound]] with an [[Ancient Sprout]] in Gracus' place:
:{{text|say|Ysera|He has passed on, <name>. In vanquishing his nightmare, you ensured he finally knows peace.}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Ysera|Be at peace, my old friend.}}
:''Most of the present druids walk away, while the two keepers, ducks, and Rani stay.''
:{{text|say|[[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]]|Sister, I did not know [[death]] could be so... peaceful.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Not all ends must be violent.}}
:''The dragon sisters follow suit.''

[[Keeper Adranas]] has new gossip:
{{book|content=
Where an [[ancient]] falls the next shall rise.

Gracus is gone for now but one day there will be an ancient that will be born from him.

Like all things in the dream, the cycle continues and so too shall life.

I mourn my friend but I am eager to meet my next one.
}}

[[Keeper Meridon]] repeats his previous text:
{{book|content=
[[Admiral Peppers]] is a duck of the Dream. 

Long ago, when Gracus was still protecting the Dream, Admiral Peppers came to him.

I would say the gentle duck handler we have seen today is all thanks to the love Gracus had for Admiral Peppers.
