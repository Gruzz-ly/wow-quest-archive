==Objectives==
Seek out [[Aviana]].

==Description==
We received reports that the [[Druids of the Flame]] have established another staging ground just south of the [[Eye of Ysera]].

Unfortunately for them, their incursion point has disrupted the local winged wildlife and drawn the ire of the Mother of Flight.

Speak with Aviana and lend her your aid. We will need her eyes and wings in the battle to come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}

==Completion==
I expected [[Cenarius]] would send some support eventually.

But this foolish, ground dwelling [[loa]]?

<Aviana taps her talon in annoyance as she gives [[Q'onzu]] a side-eyed glare.>

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Cenarius|I have no doubt my old friend has established a roost above the invasion point. Find her to the east.}}

Head to [[Aviana's Perch]] to find Aviana with Q'onzu.
:{{Text|say|Aviana|By the [[G'Hanir|Mother Tree]], why do you care what they are doing?}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|Fascination, my precious friend, is the only reason I care!}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|Change comes to the dream and you're not the least bit curious?}}
:{{Text|say|Aviana|Curious? I watched them and their sycophantic leaders burn [[Hyjal]]. I will not let them--}}
:{{Text|emote|Aviana shifts her furious gaze from the Loa of Change to <name> as they approach.}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|Oh, a friend! Mine or yours?}}

Q'onzu has new gossip:

{{book|content=
Things are not what they seem!

Isn't that exciting?

*{{Gossip|Why are you called a loa?}}

Why are you a <race>? Why are you called a <class>?

It's who you are. Loa is who I am. It's what I was called by my first devotees and it's what I have chosen to embrace.

<Q'onzu swivels their great head around, their eyes narrowing in a cheeky expression.>

Mystery is certainly delightful... isn't it?

*{{gossip|I have met and aided many spirits of the Wilds and those that worship them. You, however, are new.}}

Doesn't that make this all the more exciting? An unfamiliar droplet in an ocean of ordinariness!  

The Wild Gods, the August Celestials, even the many loa you are familiar with! Instead of perceiving me through the lens of what is known, consider an alternative.

The tree of life is vast, her crown reaching high and her roots sinking deep. 

And you, <class order hall title>, have only seen a few of her many branches.

*{{Gossip|Loa of Change? The Chronicles of [[Zanchul]] have never mentioned you before.}} (Zandalari trolls only)

The records of [[Zuldazar]] are not as complete as you might think! History has always been ever changing.

No, the Zandalari chronicles would not know of me. As a matter of fact, I don't think any of your kind would. Few mortals have witnessed the manifestation of change with their own eyes!

Such an honor it must be for you!

*{{Gossip|The [[Darkspear]] Elders have never mentioned the Loa of Change before.}} (Darkspear trolls)

Darkspear you say? Ah yes! One of the [[Jungle troll|Gurubashi]] tribes... or former tribe, I suppose.

No, they would not know of me. As a matter of fact, I don't think any of your kind would. Few mortals have witnessed the manifestation of change with their own eyes!

Such an honor it must be for you!
