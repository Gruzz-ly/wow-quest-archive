==Objectives==
Collect 6 Lasher Hearts in the [[Twisting Wood]] near the [[Root-Bound Sanctuary]].
*[[Lasher Heart]] (6)
*Speak with Dionaessa.

==Description==
I was charged with imparting knowledge on every [[dryad]] seed. [[Dionaessa]] will have retained all of my teachings, but she will be unpracticed in implementing them.

Since it seems you are practiced at completing tasks, you will show Dionaessa the ropes.

A group of [[lasher]]s have{{sic}} grown strangely restless in the Twisting Wood just outside the garden. Collect some of their hearts so we can discern what has happened.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10 [[Emerald Dewdrop]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
The [[druid]] [[Ethidris Creekward|Creekward]] told me lashers tend to lie in wait for their prey.

I'm glad these are not. Makes the fight more interesting!

==Completion==
These hearts smell awful! Almost as awful as those [[podling]]s with the sharp little teeth...

==Notes==
Ethidris has new gossip:

{{book|content=
Aside from helping the garden acclimate to the roots of the World Tree, the dryads here have had few tasks for me thus far.

<Ethidriss sighs and looks across the garden.>

Until today.

*{{gossip|What are Dream acorns?}}

All acorns in the Dream are imbued with great magic. Most are nebulous and can be used in rituals, spells, and much more.

Some are descended from great Ancients and retain the memories of all their ancestors. They become Ancients themselves upon being planted.

And some are dryads, like the ones we care for here.

*{{gossip|Do all dryads grow from seeds?}}

Yes, but not just any seed. They are dryad acorns unique to the Dream. This garden is one of several where they are raised.

It only takes a splash of water for them to sprout, as you have seen.

<Ethidris grimaces at Dionaessa.>

And then they immediately imprint on the first person they see.

The hearts drop from [[Sickly Lasher]]s and [[Meddling Podling]]s.

*{{Text|say|Dionaessa|Guardian! Critique my stabbing form!}}
*{{Text|say|Dionaessa|This is so much FUN!}}
*{{Text|say|Dionaessa|Can you show me how to do that?}}
*{{Text|say|Dionaessa|Ha! These creatures are delightfully violent!}}
*{{Text|say|Dionaessa|Unpruned fiends, beware!}}
