==Objectives==
Plant a seed at each of the Dreamsoil patches.
*Small Seed planted
*Plump Seed planted
*Gigantic Seed planted
*[[Mysterious Ageless Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
For years I worked with [[Denalan]] in [[Teldrassil]]. His research will be the foundation of how we will restore these seeds.

The first step: we must coax them back to life, allowing them to grow into vibrant blossoming plants. I have located suitable patches of soil where the plants can take root and grow, revealing their true potential.

We will plant one small, one plump, and one gigantic seed to observe how the quality of the seed can sprout different growth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you planted the seeds?

==Completion==
Denalan would be proud to see his work continued by one such as you!

==Notes==
You may examine the Emerald Bounty soils:

Otherwise, proceed with planting the seeds at the three dreamsoils to grow [[Dreamseed Bloom]]s.

;Small
:{{Text|say|[[Kaldorei Researcher]]|Though of lesser quality, a small seed still holds the hope of embellishments for those that harvest its bloom.}}

;Plump
:{{Text|say|Kaldorei Researcher|The rare plump seed has been known to attract small creatures to its bloom. Many become suitable pets.}}

;Gigantic
:{{Text|say|Kaldorei Researcher|The gigantic seed is both epic in size and rewards. A few have attracted mounts with the beauty of this bloom.}}

==Progression==
{{Mysterious Seeds}}
