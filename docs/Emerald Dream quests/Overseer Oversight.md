'''Overseer Oversight''' concludes the "The Q'onzu Query" optional storyline of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Overseer Chardryn.jpg|Overseer Chardryn|Chardryn oversees the Druids of the Flame twisted experiments on the Dream's flora and fauna.}}
Slay Overseer Chardryn.
*[[Overseer Chardryn]] slain

==Description==
Those research notes you brought [[Q'onzu]] made mention of the ones behind these foul experiments.

The overseer, the one named Chardryn, has been under our noses this whole time.

He oversees their research station below us.

If we are to permanently end their terrible experiments and disrupt their progress, then he must be made an example of.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* [[Charred Staff of the Overseer]]
* [[Gigantic Dreamseed]]
* 5x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Progress==
If Chardryn and his insane herbologists are allowed to carry out biological warfare here in the dream, then [[Amirdrassil]] and all of [[Azeroth]] is at risk.

We cannot allow these sycophants of fire to remain alive.

==Completion==
Their overseer is dead then?

<[[Aviana]] gives you a curt nod of approval.>

Good.

With Chardryn gone, their experiments destroyed and their research brought to a halt, let us hope this is the end of their twisted schemes.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Q'onzu|Mortal! Your dedication through these discoveries has been something to behold! I'm almost a little proud to have set you on such heroics.}}
:{{text|say|Aviana|Must it always be about you?}}
:{{text|say|Q'onzu|Of course, Aviana! And this mortal already expects as much. As a friend of Q'onzu, they've come to know me quite well! Or maybe not at all.}}
:{{text|emote|Q'onzu blinks slowly as they regard you with a knowing nod.}}

Head down to the main area of [[the Char]] and find Overseer Chardryn in the central area. Aggro him:
:{{Text|say|Overseer Chardryn|You come too late, 'hero'! Our work is already complete!}}

And kill him:
:{{Text|say|Overseer Chardryn|[[Firodren Mooncaller|Firodren]]'s vision... will come to...}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Aviana|If you're wondering where Q'onzu swooped off to during your absence, don't ask. They weren't inclined to tell me.}}
:{{Text|say|Aviana|They mentioned something about being bored with the 'agents of uniformity'. I'm sure they'll turn up again at some inopportune time.}}
:{{Text|emote|Aviana shakes her head in annoyance.}}
