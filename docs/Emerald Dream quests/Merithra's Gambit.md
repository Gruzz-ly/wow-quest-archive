==Objectives==
Tell [[Ysera]] to drop the magical defense.
* Ask Ysera to lower [[Eye of Ysera|the Eye's]] defenses

==Description==
We are ready as we can be. Our guard is in place, and our trap ripe to spring.

The emerald preservers' magic is linked to Ysera's. Upon your signal, they will simultaneously drop the magical defense. This is what [[Galok Wingslicer|Galok's]] been waiting for. His forces will swoop in like carrion birds.

We await your word, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Here we go.

==Completion==
I must trust her--and myself. It is time to fight.

==Notes==
Speak with Ysera:
{{book|content=
The [[djaradin]] [[mage]]s must be strong to launch a sustained assault like this.

We are running out of time. I cannot attune fully--it grows painful to keep trying.

I am ready, as I trust you are. Say the word, and I will let go.

{{gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}

The area is now phased to be under attack by the [[Zaqali]]. Regular NPCs are gone, now only guard/defender-type are present, fighting the enemies. In addition to the forces gathered by Somnikus, [[Emerald Balancer]]s, [[Ancient of Lore (Emerald Dream)|Ancients of Lore]], [[Horned Somnowl]]s, and [[Umbraclaw Cub]]s are on the battlefield.

==Progression==
{{Eye of Ysera}}
