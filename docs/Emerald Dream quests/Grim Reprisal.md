==Objectives==
Disrupt the [[Smoldering Copse]].
* Disrupt the Smoldering Copse (0/100%)

==Description==
The [[Druids of the Flame]] will not allow you to proceed unfettered once your intentions here become clear.

They are my kin, my brothers and sisters under [[Elune]]... But they seek to undo all that we have toiled for. Their machinations would condemn countless lives to an all-consuming inferno.

I won't allow it. We cannot allow it.

Disrupt their rituals. Destroy their supplies. If they raise their blades against you, cut them down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Take heed. These druids' zealotry fuels their reckless ends. Should they identify you as an enemy, they will not show mercy.

==Completion==
To think, after all we have been through, that any druid would dare try to warp the Dream in such a way.

<Tyrande scowls.>

These 'druids' are an affront to the suffering that the [[Kaldorei]] have endured.

==Notes==
When accepting both this quest and [[Burning Ground]]:<!--both or only Grim Reprisal?-->
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Immortality... Is that truly what this is about? Is that the lie these zealots have sold them?}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|My people have suffered so much. I will not allow these sycophants to sell them a seeming eternity, built upon a burning pyre of innocent lives.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Disrupt their camp and break their ranks. I will seek out their leader - and show them how foolish it is to tempt the ire of Elune.}}
:''Tyrande runs off.''

Fill the bar by defeating or destroying:
*7-8%: [[Cinderclaw Stalker]], [[Molten Runebear]]
*5%: [[Fanatical Ritualist]], [[Firestorm Totem]]s, [[Smoldering Enforcer]], [[Smoldering Supplies]], [[Smoldering Thaumaturge]]

Catch up with Tyrande southwest of the quest area, with some [[Rescued Runebear]]s, [[Rescued Sister]]s, and [[Rescued Darter]]s.
