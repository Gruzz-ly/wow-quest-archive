==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Void Horror (Emerald Dream).jpg|The Void Horror|Something dark and disturbing lies in wait. It must be destroyed.}}
Destroy all Grips of Horror and the Void Horror.
*[[Grip of Horror|Grips of Horror]] slain (3)
*[[Void Horror (Emerald Dream)|Void Horror]] slain

==Description==
It is as I feared. We cannot fuse the shards together until the [[Void]] has been driven from this place.

Quickly, strike down these [[aberration]]s. I suspect the source of the corruption will not sit idle in response.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* +350 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (1,000x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
The Void is at its strongest here. I feel at fault for allowing it to spread unhindered.

==Completion==
To think something so dark, so terrible, festered here for this long. We are truly lost.
