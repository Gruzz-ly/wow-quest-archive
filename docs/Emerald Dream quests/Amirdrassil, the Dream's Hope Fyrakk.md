'''Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope: Fyrakk''' is the standard "go storm the castle" breadcrumb quest, capping off the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]] and formally sending players into [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]]. This quest can be completed on all difficulty levels, from Raid Finder to Mythic.

==Objectives==
Enter [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]], and defeat Fyrakk.
* Slay [[Fyrakk the Blazing|Fyrakk]]

==Description==
Fyrakk may have entered the temple, but our fight has not ended. Thanks to your efforts, we have broken through his forces. There is still time to stop him.

You must gather your allies and follow Fyrakk into the [[Wellspring Temple]]. We will cover your flank.

Know that it is not only [[Amirdrassil]] that you protect this day, <name>. All of Azeroth will burn if Fyrakk claims the World Tree. He must be stopped, here and now. This is our final stand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1,685|40}}
* 19,050 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Wyrm's Dreaming Crest]]
*[[Ember of Fyrakk]]
*[[Emerald Flightstone]]
*[[Gigantic Dreamseed]]

==Progress==
Once, Fyrakk fought to free dragonkind. He raged a war against us for that very ideal. What drove him to seek domination instead? Was it the need for revenge? The desire for power?

The same fire that burns can also renew. Yet Fyrakk's flames would swallow the whole world.

==Completion==
Amirdrassil is saved, and with it all of Azeroth. Fyrakk's defeat has ensured that.

From the champion of the Dragon Isles to the savior of the Emerald Dream. All the dragonflights owe you a great debt, <name>. And we shall not soon forget it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Alexstrasza shifts to her dragon form.''
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Go! We will follow when we can.}}
:''She flies off.''

This quest was originally required to unlock [[A Blossom Witnessed]], the next quest in the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].
