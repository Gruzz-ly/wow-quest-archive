==Objectives==
Inform [[Gracus]]' loved ones.
* Dream Denizens informed (6)

==Description==
It is as I feared. It is Gracus' time.

Healing him would never have worked. The world beyond already calls to him.

Although he has such peace, those that care for him will still grieve. He will still be dearly missed.

Not everyone is granted a chance to say goodbye.

We must ensure that in this case, they are.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
I am grateful we can give them this opportunity to say goodbye.

==Completion==
There is a sense of peace in this place.

Gracus summoned me here for a reason. He knew.

==Notes==
[[Talathar Brightsong]], near [[Aryn Lightfeather]] and [[Hahdor Moonseer]] {{co|57.0|26.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:

{{book|content=
I have found it is great fun to show druids around the Dream who have never visited before.

To see the awe in their eyes is quite rewarding.

:{{text|say|Talathar Brightsong|The old man will not sleep without seeing me first.}}
:''They run off.''

[[Keeper Adranas]] {{co|57.7|28.1|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:

{{book|content=
<Keeper Adranas nods knowingly.>

<Name>. Thank you for coming.

The Dream works in mysterious ways. I remember you, although we have yet to meet.

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell them about Gracus.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Adranas|Old friend, persist just a little longer.}}

[[Alfie Turner]] with a few ducks running in circles around a cart {{co|56.9|29.3|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:

{{book|content=
The ducklings seem to be enjoying the Dream.

Myself, I find it all a bit overwhelming. But remarkable!

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell them about Gracus.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Alfie Turner|I haven't known Gracus for long, but he's taught me so much in this little amount of time.}}

[[Admiral Peppers]] and [[Keeper Meridon]] {{co|55.3|28.4|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:

Meridon:
{{book|content=
Admiral Peppers would not calm down until we were here. 

Something seems to be distressing her.

{{gossip|<Ask about Admiral Peppers.>}}

Admiral Peppers is a duck of the Dream. 

Long ago, when Gracus was still protecting the Dream, Admiral Peppers came to him.

I would say the gentle duck handler we have seen today is all thanks to the love Gracus had for Admiral Peppers.

Admiral Peppers:
{{book|content=
<The duck looks at you expectantly, as though she knows you bring solemn news.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell them about Gracus.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Meridon|So this what made you so anxious, Admiral.}}

[[Rani]] {{co|52.8|25.3|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
{{book|content=
I came here once, as a child.

Not on purpose. It was terrifying, to have dreamed myself into another world.

It started me on the path of becoming a druid. So it is good to be back, in better spirits.

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell them about Gracus.>}}
}}

:{{text|say|Rani|Gracus, I'll be there for you like you've been there for me!}}

[[Sprucecrown]] and [[Kaz'arin]] {{co|52.4|24.4|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:

{{book|content=
Greetings, young one. What news do you bring?

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell them about Gracus.>}}
}}

:{{text|say|Sprucecrown|His time has come then.}}

All the druids and ducks then gather in front of Gracus.
