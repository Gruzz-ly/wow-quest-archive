==Objectives==
Collect the Sample of Cinder-pollen.
*[[Sample of Cinder Pollen]]
*Show [[Q'onzu]] the pollen and the research notes

==Description==
<You find some singed research notes on the slain [[druid]].

The notes detail experiments being carried out by the [[Druids of the Flame]].

You learn that they have created an unusual pollen capable of infusing dream flora with their flame-imbued [[magic]]. The next stage targets the local wildlife with the same pollen.

[[Q'onzu]] would definitely be interested in a sample of the pollen and these notes.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* [[Treacherous Research Notes]]
* [[Ashphodel Research Notes (poor)]]

==Progress==
<Q'onzu blinks slowly as they stare down at you.>

==Completion==
That...was devastatingly mundane. Soot and ash, forever unchanged?

<Q'onzu shakes their enormous head.>

No. I do not like.

==Notes==
Head to {{Co|60.8|44.9|Emerald Dream|link=Emerald Dream (zone)}} and loot the sample.

Return and speak with Q'onzu:

<Q'onzu swivels their head and leans in close.>

There is something different about you, <name>. You've brought me something. 

Oh, I do enjoy mysteries!

{{Gossip|quest=|I found this bundle of flame pollen and these research notes with the Druids of the Flame.}}

<Q'onzu peers at the note, reading it in full before sniffing at the bag of pollen.>

How intriguing! Not only have these druids created a new type of plant, but they are using its pollen to cross-pollinate other dream plants? How curious!

It makes you wonder what kind of effect this has on the local wildlife? Or perhaps a [[loa]]?

Only one way to find out, isn't there?

*{{Gossip|quest=|Let's find out!}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Wait, hold on!}}
}}

Pick either option, it doesn't matter as Q'onzu eats the pollen regardless:
:''Q'onzu places the [[Bag of Cinder Pollen]] and devours it.''
:{{Text|say|Aviana|Wait, what are you -- Q'onzu NO!}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|This pollen....this change...is....is...}}
:''Q'onzu briefly turns orange!''
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|Boring! Predictable! This isn't change! Pah!}}
:{{Text|emote|Aviana stares at the Loa of Change in disbelief.}}
:{{Text|say|Aviana|Have you gone mad?}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|Sadly, no. But this does change things!}}
