At the encampment, new characters are present - [[Ysera]], [[Galenori]], [[Gerithus]], [[Somnikus]], and [[Lord Itharius]].

This concludes the week one portion of the campaign. The next chapter starts the week of 14 November, but a number of side quests immediately open up: [[The Dryad Garden]], [[The Q'onzu Query]], [[A Call to Aid]], [[A Sleepy Search]], and [[Trouble at the Tree]].
