==Objectives==
Put 6 silly hats on Dreaming Druids.
*Silly Hats on [[Dreaming Druid]]s (6)
*[[Silly Hat]] (provided)

==Description==
I'll let you in on a secret, these crates? They're prank supplies!

People are so serious around here. What's better than a little prank to lift everyone's spirits?

You could put some of these fun hats on some of the sleeping [[druid]]s because what's more fun than a surprise hat?

Be careful though, their connection to [[Emerald Dream|the dream]] could make anything happen!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Napping in the Dream... I wonder what they're dreaming about!

==Completion==
I'm impressed. I thought I was pranking you too!

But looks like you're better at this than I expected...

Maybe it's time for a real challenge.

==Notes==
Use the hat on the Dreaming Druids in and around the encampment. It changes their name to Dreaming Druid with a Hat and summons a hostile [[Manifested Dreamsaber]]... that is also wearing a hat.
