==Objectives==
Slay Calderamor, Ignarion, and 15 Wildfire enemies.
* Use Frozenheart's Wrath on Calderamor or Ognarion (Optional)
* [[Calderamor]] slain {{co|35.6|40.3|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* [[Ignarion]] slain {{Co|33.4|41.0|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* Wildfire forces slain (15)
* [[Frozenheart's Wrath]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] have erected great flame wards throughout their encampment. Yet we know not why. I have asked our ground forces to investigate, but they are blocked at every turn.

Two [[fire elemental]]s in particular stand against us, empowered by [[Fyrakk]]'s [[shadowflame]].

You must clear the area of enemies. I have imbued this scale with my magic. Use it to weaken the elementals and any other who stands in your way.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chartreuse Champion's Sabatons
|Chartreuse Champion's Girdle
|Summer Soother's Sash
|Spirited Stag's Waistguard
|Fearless Faerie's Belt
|Summer Soother's Slippers
|Fearless Faerie's Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Even in the heat of battle, the Primalists continue to empower those flame wards. But to what end? We must clear the way so that our forces can investigate.

==Completion==
I am glad my scale was of use to you. Though I cannot take to the field, I can at least empower you to fight on my behalf.

I will tell our ground forces to begin their investigations. We must find out why those flame wards are being empowered.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|[[Alexstrasza]] the Life-Binder|Vyranoth and I will engage Fyrakk.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]|He burns for retribution. Fyrakk will stop at nothing to kill you himself.}}
:{{text|say|[[Merithra]]|We need you here, Life-Binder. There will likely be heavy casualties.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Very well. I will stay for now.}}

The provided quest item works on generic units as well as the named elites! [[Calderamor]] is to the southwest. Use [[Frozenheart's Wrath]] to pierce the 90% damage reduction shield, then finish off the fire elemental. [[Ignarion]] is further southwest. Rinse and repeat with the quest item to defeat it as well.

On return:
:{{text|say|Merithra|Cutting off our reinforcements seems too calculating for Fyrakk.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|But not for [[Ashendir Hartwood|Ashendir]]. The Prophet of the Flame must be the one behind it all.}}

==Progression==
