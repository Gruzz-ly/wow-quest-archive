==Objectives==
Discuss [[Merithra]]'s plan with the [[green dragonflight]].
* Regroup with Merithra
* Speak to [[green dragon]]s (3)
* Speak with Ysera

==Description==
[[Galok Wingslicer|Galok]] is a coward. He refuses to engage us directly until he is sure of success.

We do not have the resources to attack his base. But if we cannot go to him, maybe we can entangle him in our own territory.

I am confident we can prepare a trap here for Galok and his forces. My plan is not without risks, and controlling the playing field will be our key advantage.

The question remains... how do we lure them here?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I must understand everyone's perspectives, especially for a maneuver this big.

==Completion==
<Merithra solemnly nods at our allies.>

That settles it then. Let us begin preparations.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Merithra|Meet me back in the temple. I have an idea to lure Galok into our hands, but I must consult my flight.}}

Return to Ysera inside the temple.
:{{Text|say|Merithra|We don't have the forces to breach Galok's base of operations.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|We also can't hold this defense indefinitely.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|He wants the Eye. If we line it with traps first and then lure him here...}}

[[Gerithus]], [[Somnikus]], and [[Lord Itharius]] have also gathered. Speak with them:

{{book|Gerithus|content=
We are struggling to keep up the protective barrier. Every moment that passes, the enemy's magic just burns hotter.

Galok knows this. He expects us to fall.

{{gossip|quest=|What do you think about Merithra's plan?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|All the suffering that has been endured here... We must act.}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|I will busy myself conceiving strategies for Lord Itharius and Somnikus. I believe that is where I am most useful.}}

{{book|Somnikus|content=
Whether we like it or not, there will be battle--and we must face it headstrong.

I've begun rallying the Eye's defenders to anticipate this. Let us execute the plan swiftly and surely.

{{gossip|quest=|What do you think about Merithra's plan?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Somnikus|Merithra is right. Our enemy has shown they can breach our most well-defended strongholds.}}
:{{text|say|Somnikus|I have rallied the druids here to help us. It is time to be proactive--not reactive.}}

{{book|Lord Itharius|content=
I've sounded the horn for additional allies. I'm not sure how many will come to our aid in time. The Dream is under siege on all fronts.

May their arrival be swift.

{{gossip|quest=|What do you think about Merithra's plan?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Lord Itharius|I have already sounded the horn to bring our flight here.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Itharius|On your command, Merithra, I will have them descend on the djaradin. We will prevail--together!}}

Then speak with Ysera:

{{book|Ysera|content=
<Despite the magnitude of Ysera's efforts, Ysera finally looks at you, and her expression is that of peace.>

My daughter wisely seeks the counsel of her flight.

She already knows what needs to be done, but she does not want to ask me, because I am her mother.

She should know that I will always make the sacrifice.

{{gossip|quest=|What do you think about Merithra's plan?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|You no longer need my counsel, daughter... But you are all correct--it is time to act.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|We need a way to lure Galok here, and I can think of only one. It is risky...}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|I can dispel the shield over the Eye. That will bring our enemies here, and then we can execute your plan.}}

==Progression==
{{Eye of Ysera}}
