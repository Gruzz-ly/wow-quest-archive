==Objectives==
Find and confront the interloper in [[Q'onzu]]'s nest.
*Interloper found

==Description==
You have many questions and I have many worries.

Such pressing worries. An interloper, a rude disrupter of our joyous day. How I worry so. If only someone could confront this trespasser.

Wait, you could do it for me! It's a win-win, you go confront the trespasser and I answer your questions. I've tracked them down to a cave in the north. Surely you can handle them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I can sense the interloper causing a disturbance in my nest!

==Completion==
Ha! Oh, come now. That was funny. Don't look so cross.

==Notes==
Go around through [[Shiversnap Grove]] and find the cave entrance at {{Co|32.9|66.7|Emerald Dream|link=Emerald Dream}}.

Approach The Interloper, and it changes to the Image of the Interloper - the adventurer!
