==Objectives==
Meet [[Mother Elion]] at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]] in the [[Waking Shores]].

==Description==
Well done, <name>.

Now we must ensure [[Dragon whelp|the whelps]] of the [[netherwing]] have the best opportunities to grow and flourish. 

Let us speak to Mother Elion. I know she would relish the opportunity to care for the young of a new [[Dragonflight|flight]].

Can you meet us at the Ruby Lifeshrine?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Wrathion]] says there are new whelps on the way?

Of a new flight? Are you certain this is not a joke?

Very well. Let us get started.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Vyranoth]]|I will stay and ensure the whelps are safe until members of their flight arrive.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|We will meet in Valdrakken once you are done.}}
:{{Text|emote|Wrathion smiles.}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|Thank you, Vyranoth. My kin should be along very soon.}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|I look forward to speaking to you more in Valdrakken.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|You'll enjoy Elion, Mordenaku. Quite the character, but a more motherly soul you will never find. Your whelps will receive the best of care.}}
:''Wrathion and Mordenaku transform into their dragon forms and fly toward Valdrakken.''

Head to the Ruby Lifeshrine.

;Approaching Mother Elion
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|You went through all of that, before you had even hatched?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Hard to believe, I know--but your people have a much deeper understanding of what it means to be altered in the shell than most.}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|We do. Strange... it is as though you and I are kin in more ways than one.}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|Do not mistake my words, however. Our shells may have been kin to your own, but we have since developed our own flight, and our own culture.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|I would hear more of your people... when we have time.}}

Mordenaku has new gossip here:
:Our eggs will still be tended elsewhere of course--delicate as they are, they require special conditions to properly hatch. But it's heartening to see that our whelps will be treated with such care.
