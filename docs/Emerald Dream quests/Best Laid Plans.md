==Objectives==
Collect 4 clues in the [[Primalist Stronghold]].
* Clues found (4)

==Description==
[[Fyrakk]] may be brash, but he is not a fool. If we are to save the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]], we must undermine his plans as quickly as possible.

At their core, the Primalists are unorganized. Infiltrate their camp and search for any clues or information.

The more information we have, the sooner we can take down Fyrakk once and for all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Have you discovered anything of interest?

==Completion==
[[Lethka]] left those notes?

==Notes==
The four [[Proto-dragon Tablet]]s are marked on the area map at {{co|37.2|22.9|Emerald Dream (zone)}}, {{co|36.2|21.0|Emerald Dream (zone)}}, {{co|36.0|20.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}} and {{co|34.7|20.1|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:
:{{text|say|Lethka|Vyranoth neglected my power, but Fyrakk will not. If I prove myself here, I could become as mighty as the Incarnates.}}
:{{text|say|Lethka|How dare he? I alone am worthy to receive this power. Fyrakk chose me!}}
:{{text|say|Lethka|I will be the one to smash the barrier to pieces! Then Vyranoth will see how wrong she was to leave us!}}
:{{text|say|Lethka|[[Cinder Summit]] will serve our needs. Only I am strong enough to harness the power within that mountain. Not these... servants.}}

==Progression==
{{Ice and Fire}}
