==Objectives==
Interrupt the Flame Druids' Ritual.
* Speak to [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]]
* [[Sylvanesh the Ascended]] slain

==Description==
You've arrived just in time. [[Norana Morninglight|Norana]] lurks just beyond the ridge. She appears to be taking part in some manner of ritual - alongside a man who appears to be their leader.

These are powerful druids, and their strength is amplified by their ties to the [[Firelands]]. Taking the blade to all of them at once would be foolish.

Still, the least we can do is disrupt their ritual. If we send them scattering, we buy ourselves time - and an opportunity to press the advance elsewhere.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Summer Soother's Shoulders]]
*[[Fearless Faerie's Shoulderpads]]
*[[Spirited Stag's Epaulets]]
*[[Chartreuse Champion's Shoulderplates]]

You will also receive:
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
This so-called [[Prophet]] purports to represent the interests of the [[Kaldorei]], but I see him plain enough. He craves power, and he exploits the fear and suffering of the Kaldorei to claim it.

His work must not continue. Not while I yet draw breath.

We've done all that we can here, for now. We must return to [[Amirdrassil]].

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|While you were disrupting their camp, [[Andi'thur]] took the liberty of discerning Norana's location. She stands with the so-called Prophet of the Flame, just beyond the terrace.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|We have a chance to behead this foul serpent, and I intend to take it. Whatever ritual they seek to invoke, we must put a stop to it.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|We do not have much time. Speak to me when you are ready to strike.}}

Speak with her:
{{book|content=
The time to strike is now. We must be decisive.

Let me know when you are ready, <class>.

{{gossip|I am ready.}}}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|9KjIUXg0Nas}}
:''Tyrande and the adventurer sneak up toward the group, close enough to hear them.''
:{{Text|say|[[Ashendir Hartwood]]|Behold! I bless you with the embers of [[Ragnaros]].}}
:''Two night elves walk toward Ashendir and kneel. He empowers them with fire.''
:{{Text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|We must ensure [[Fyrakk]] makes way for the [[Smolderon|new Firelord]].}}
:''The two night elves stand up, then transform into a fiery [[somnowl]] and a [[fire hawk]]. The somnowl is likely [[Tindral Sageswift]] as he uses that model later.'' 
:{{Text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|A crown of flame will reign over Azeroth!}}
:''The two elves take into the sky, and Ashendir with Norana walk toward the rest of the druids.''
:{{Text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|You all have seen the destruction caused by Tyrande!}}
:{{Text|say|Norana Morninglight|She refused to join us in the restoration of our people's immortality!}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|These lies poison my people against me.}}
:{{Text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|She would bring a tree of [[death]] into the world, condemning the kaldorei to the [[Shadowlands]]!}}
:''Tyrande, fury in her face, charges at the group and dispatches two druids.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Traitors! Apostates! This madness ends here!}}

After the cutscene, Tyrande is engaged in combat with [[Sylvanesh the Ascended]], the fire hawk. Take out the bird:
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|It is done.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Come. We regroup with the denizens you saved.}}

Then follow Tyrande back to the quest-starting spot to turn in.
