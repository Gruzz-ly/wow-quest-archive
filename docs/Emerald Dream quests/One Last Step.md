{{questportrait|Raelas Firewind.jpg|Raelas Firewind|A [[druid]] equipped with enough firepower to burn the [[Lushdream Crags]] to ash.}}

==Objectives==
Eliminate Raelas Firewind.
*[[Raelas Firewind]] slain {{Co|49.9|43.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}}

==Description==
This operation would not have come this far without [[Lilian Voss|Lilian's]] aid. 

We may not have much in common, but Lillian{{sic}} is a... dependable ally. After fighting side-by-side in [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]], we have an odd kinship that was forged by this mission.

Together, we will finish this. With the stones in our hands, it is now safe to take out Raelas and end his little crusade.

Onward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
*[[Rune of the Fire Druids]]
*5x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Completion==

<Shandris's gaze is locked on something else and she seems deep in thought. She then shakes her head as if to clear it.>

I... [[Shae'lune]] would probably like to take a look at these... stones.

==Notes==
Find Raelas trying to burn down a tree:
:{{Text|say|Raelas Firewind|Those spirits are mine! Give me back the stones!}}

Defeat him:

:''Raelas explodes, leaving behind a pile of ash.''
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Shandris! What were you doing? You were way too close!}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I... I know. I wanted...}}
:{{text|emote|Shandris's face twists with anger.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I know what I'm doing, Lilian. Meet me back at camp.}}
:''Shandris runs off.''
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Hmm... was it something I said?}}
:''Lilian follows suit.

Head to east to {{Co|55.2|42.4|Emerald Dream (zone)}} in the [[Haven Cascades]] and approach Shandris:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|What happened back there, Shandris? What is wrong?}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I said it was nothing! Do not ask again.}}
:{{text|emote|Lilian gives Shandris a sidelong glance.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I need to work on some logistics before we go.}}
:''She wanders off behind the cart with the dazed symbol above her head.''

Shandris has new gossip:
{{book|content=
<Shandris looks far into the dense forest.>

{{Gossip|Are you alright?}}

I need a moment to clear my mind.

Go with...

<Shandris pauses for a moment, her gaze is back to the forest.>

Go with Lillian{{sic}}. Come back once you have purified the stones.
