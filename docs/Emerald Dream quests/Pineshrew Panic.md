==Objectives==
Shake out 20 Pineshrew seeds in the [[Root-Bound Sanctuary]].
*Pineshrew seeds shaken (20)
*[[Big Snaggleclaw]] retrieved
*Big Snaggleclaw retrieved
*Tell [[Ethidris Creekward|Ethidris]] about [[Dionaessa|the dryad]]

==Description==
With the garden in such disarray, the pineshrews here are hoarding seeds. Important seeds. Seeds we've spent a lot of time caring for and teaching.

A gentle shake will release the seeds properly. Please hurry before they run off with any more!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Ordinarily, pineshrews shake out collected seeds across the Dream to promote variety and growth. It's a beautiful cycle.

If you have a few hours, I have a lesson prepared about pineshrew migration habits.

==Completion==
It seems Dionaessa has chosen you to train her.

<Ethidris's face tightens.>

Splendid. Just perfect.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Ethidris Creekward|If you happen to see a Dream acorn in your pineshrew toss, don't let it get wet. At all. We don't have time for that.}}

Click on [[Pineshrew Seedsnatcher]]s to shake them. Each snatcher is worth 4 points. As you do, [[Big Snaggleclaw]] briefly appears.
:{{Text|emote|Big Snaggleclaw squeaks with shock and indignation.}}
:{{Text|emote|Big Snaggleclaw squeaks a harsh warning.}}
:{{Text|emote|Big Snaggleclaw stamps a tiny foot and scurries away.}}

Once the objective is fulfilled, head to {{Co|54.0|77.2|Emerald Dream|link=Emerald Dream (zone)}} and take the acorn from Big Snaggleclaw:
:''[[Newborn Dryad]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Newborn Dryad|Hello! Are you my [[druid]]? You don't look like a Creekward.}}
:{{Text|say|Newborn Dryad|Well, you're my guardian now. I never liked the druid Creekward's voice anyway. It's too dreary!}}

Return to Ethidris:
:{{Text|say|Ethidris Creekward|<Name>! Is that a newborn dryad? Do not tell me you dropped that dryad acorn.}}

Speak with him:
:<Ethidris gawks at the newborn dryad.>

:Those acorns were my responsibility. How did this happen?

:{{Gossip|quest=|A big pineshrew hopped into a puddle and this dryad appeared.}}
:{{Text|say|Ethidris Creekward|Yes, that would do it. I ought to take on the role of guardian for this one. You do not need to stay.}}
:{{Text|emote|Newborn Dryad's face scrunches up in disgust.}}
:{{Text|say|Newborn Dryad|You? Really? No. I like this one. They will be my guardian. I've heard your dull voice long enough.}}
:{{Text|say|Newborn Dryad|And my name is Dionaessa, druid Creekward.}}
:{{Text|emote|Ethidris pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs.}}
:{{Text|say|Ethidris Creekward|Very well, Dionaessa.}}
