==Objectives==
Toss the Emerald Shards into the lake and collect the Dreamglow Dragonscale.
* Shards tossed in lake
* Reforging Ritual completed
* [[Reforged Dreamglow Dragonscale]]
* [[Emerald Shards]] (provided)

==Description==
All that remains is to throw the emerald fragments you collected into the lake. I will use my power to bind them together.

If this works, they will be reforged into a powerful dragonscale that you can use to empower the [[:Heart of Azeroth]].

I believe that [[Ysera|my mother]] would be pleased that some of our power will go toward saving the [[Azeroth|world]]. I hope she would be proud of us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]
*[[Dreamglow Dragonscale]]

==Progress==
These waters may no longer be tainted by the [[Void]], but the [[green dragonflight]] must remain vigilant lest it ever return.

==Completion==
You hold the coalesced power of the green dragonflight in your hands, <name>. I trust you will use it well.
