==Objectives==
Find clues regarding Shandris' whereabouts.
*[[Shandris's Mission Journal|Clues]] found
*Ask [[Keeper Sillas]] if he saw [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]]
*Search for [[Hasty Tracks|more clues]]
*Follow [[Confusing Tracks|the tracks]]
*Find [[Heavy Tracks (Emerald Dream)|more tracks]]

==Description==
I knew coming into this that Shandris likes to work alone, but letting us know where she's going would be nice.

Not a great turn in our professional relationship.

Keeper Sillas won't speak to me...

We should take a look around the camp. Maybe she left a note or some clue... maybe in her mission log?

Take a look, and see if you can get anything out of Sillas. 

I'll wait here in case she comes back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 7,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
I haven't known Shandris for long, but her behavior is out of line.

And out of character.

I wonder...

==Notes==
Head behind the wagon to find [[Shandris's Mission Journal]]. It reads:

{{:Shandris's Mission Journal}}

Then speak with [[Keeper Sillas]]:

{{book|content=
Shandris was assigned to help us foil [[Raelas Firewind]]'s plans of turning this area into kindling...

But [[Lilian Voss|the other one]]. She was not part of the plan.

{{Gossip|quest=|Have you seen Shandris?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Giving us the information we need will only help you, Sillas.}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Sillas|I do not answer to the [[Undead|likes of you]].}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|I don't have time for this. Tell me where Shandris went!}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Sillas|Shandris headed south from here. She seemed... full of haste.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|See? That wasn't so hard now, was it?}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|I am going to find Shandris, <name>, and you are coming with me.}}

Head southeast to the [[Meandering Rootlands]] and find [[Hasty Tracks]] at {{Co|56.3|45.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|These boot prints could be Shandris's.}}

Inspect them:
:<These tracks, light and swift, are heading west.>

Continue west to the [[Lushdream Crags]] and at {{Co|56.3|45.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}} find [[Confusing Tracks]]. Continue further and find [[Heavy Tracks (Emerald Dream)|Heavy Tracks]] at {{Co|51.9|46.6|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Fresh tracks. Shandris must be close.}}

Inspect them:
:<These tracks are heavier and slower than before. Seems like Shandris was struggling with the thick mud.>
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|She must be in that cave. I have a hunch the spirit's there too. We need to get to her--now!}}
:''Lilian runs into the cave up ahead.''

Follow suit:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Shandris! What's going on?}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Why did you follow me, Forsaken? Leave my presence!}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|This isn't you, Shandris. It's the spirit. It has bonded to you!}}<!-- Didn't show up. -->
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I can see their faces and hear their voices--everything! It is like a waking nightmare!}}

;Description
:Shandris likes to work alone, but letting us know where she's going would be nice.
:Especially since we've worked together all this time now...
:We should take a look around the camp. Maybe she left a note or some clue in her mission orders.
:I usually wouldn't snoop around in her mission orders since she "outranks" me, but since I'm the only one of any rank here... Go take a look.
