==Objectives==
Find and excise the source of the [[Sor'theril Barrow Den|barrow-den]]'s flame corruption.
*Druid of the Flame found

==Description==
It seems the [[Druids of the Flame]] wasted no time in seeking to expand their influence.

Deep within these [[barrow den]]s, some manner of corruption has taken root. It will spread if left unchecked, consuming the entire den before expanding outwards to threaten the rest of the [[Emerald Dream|dream]].

Time is short, <name>. Delve into the barrow, seek out the sources of the spreading flame, and excise them before the smoldering embers can grow and spread.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Make haste. These flames grow brighter by the moment.

==Completion==
<Tyrande's expression wavers between sadness and conviction.>

These are not [[Fandral Staghelm]]'s Druids of the Flame. To think that someone as kind and compassionate as [[Norana Morninglight|Norana]] would count herself amongst them...

We may never truly understand the depth of the scars left by the fallen boughs of [[Teldrassil]].

==Notes==
When accepting both this quest and [[Not Yet Lost]] before entering the [[Sor'theril Barrow Den]]:
:{{Text|say|[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]|The Druids of the Flame may be traitors to the Dream, but they still possess the requisite knowledge to cross into it. No doubt that is why [[Fyrakk]] has made allies of them.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I will remain here and tend to any wounded that you send me. The safety of the barrow's denizens must come first.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Take care, <name>. These fanatics are as dangerous and unpredictable as the flames they seek to spread.}}

Head into the barrow den, dodging fire patches on the way:
:{{text|say|[[Norana Morninglight]]|So you've arrived at last.}}
:{{text|say|Norana Morninglight|I had hoped to meet you, before things began in earnest.}}

At {{co|40|70|Sor'theril Barrow Den}}:
:{{text|say|Norana Morninglight|An unassuming [[adventurer]], free to act as you please.}}
:{{text|say|Norana Morninglight|We were free once. Unbound by the fetters of mortality. Perfect beings, blessed by the [[Azeroth|world]]'s [[Dragon Aspects|stewards]].}}

At {{co|55|22|Sor'theril Barrow Den}}:
:{{text|say|Norana Morninglight|We could find that world again if you wished. An unending world, preserved in flame.}}

Find Norana at {{co|64|59|Sor'theril Barrow Den}} and Tyrande runs in:
:{{text|say|Norana Morninglight|Ah, there you are. I was beginning to think you had lost your way.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Norana? You've set an entire barrow ablaze! What madness is this?}}
:{{text|say|Norana Morninglight|[[Burning of Teldrassil|Teldrassil]] opened my eyes to the truth. We cannot save our people through force of will alone, [[Night Warrior]].}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Our people have seen enough forests burn, Norana. Whatever these fanatics promised you, it is not worth the toll the [[Firelands]] would exact.}}
:{{text|say|Norana Morninglight|I have simply promised these "fanatics" the birthright they are due. The fire will return to us the eternity that your draconic keepers continue to hoard for themselves.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Wait, Norana! I--}}
:''Norana teleports away.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I knew Norana once, Champion. I hesitated. It will not happen again.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Join me on the surface and we will attempt to track her down.}}

Tyrande can be seen talking to [[Andi'thur]] near the barrow den entrance if objectives of the two quests mentioned are all achieved:
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|You have my thanks, Andi'thur. Worry not. We will track them down.}}

She also has new gossip:
{{book|content=
Norana Morninglight... She was an initiate at the [[Temple of the Moon]] in [[Darnassus]], in the years following the birth of Teldrassil.

She was always such a kind, quiet soul. I thought her dead. Instead, she now walks amongst the Druids of the Flame.

<Tyrande sighs.>
