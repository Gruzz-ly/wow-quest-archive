'''A Dash of Minerals...''' is the second in a series of quests that eventually award the [[Reins of the Ochre Dreamtalon]] mount. [[Professor Ash]] at the [[Central Encampment]] will offer this quest six days after completing [[Some Water...]].

==Objectives==
Collect Fish Bones from [[Fathomless Lurker]]s.
* [[Fish Bones (quest item)]] (5)

==Description==
I think we have a chance with this one, <name>. But we'll need to begin revitalizing the soil if we want to see this plant flourish.

Head to the [[Eye of Ysera]] and harvest fish bones from the Fathomless Lurkers in the depths of the water. They're rich in minerals and degrade easily. It won't replenish the soil on its own, but it's a great start.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Did you have a chance to pick up what I asked for? This plant won't thrive without it.

==Completion==
That's the stuff. I appreciate you taking the trouble to collect them. 

This form isn't optimal for swimming, you understand.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|This sapling is doing wonderfully, <name>!}}

The Plant Phase Growth bar appears over the Dewy Sapling again. Check back in six days.

==Progression==
{{A Mix of Hope, Care, and Patience}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.2.0|note=Added.}}
