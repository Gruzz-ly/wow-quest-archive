*Talk to [[Wrathion]] about the [[Netherwing]]

==Description==
Ah, <name>, so wonderful to see you!

You have arrived just in time. I was tasked with seeking out potential allies to aid with the protection of the world tree.

Your accomplishments speak for themselves--your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

What do you say, up for some diplomacy?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}

==Progress==
I'm quite excited to meet these new dragons.

==Completion==
Well then! We should go meet the representative of the netherwing. 

[[Mordenaku]] is his name. Apparently, he is also a prince.

==Notes==
Speak with Wrathion:

{{book|content=
We are not alone, <name>. There are other [[Dragonflight|flights]] of [[dragon]]s out there that have yet to make their way to [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].

[[Vyranoth]] has shown in her... unique way that not only can we work with others, we should.

[[Sabellian]] spoke of a brood in [[Outland]] known as the Netherwing. I extended an invitation to [[Valdrakken]] and their representative has agreed to meet us there.

*{{Gossip|quest=|Tell me of the netherwing.}} ''(if not already affiliated/exalted with the Netherwing faction)''

I confess, I have not met them myself.

Sabellian however, has provided some helpful information about them.

They were created from [[Twisting Nether|nether]] energies that mixed with the [[black dragon]] eggs stored on Outland. Apparently, they are entirely separate from Sabellian's [[Obsidian Brood|brood]]... but when you think upon it, they are still our direct kin.

I suppose we both have bizarre circumstances surrounding our origins.

*{{Gossip|quest=|I have helped the netherwing before. I can tell you about it.}} ''(if exalted with the netherwing)''

<You tell Wrathion of how you worked with the netherwing leader to infiltrate and ultimately free their flight from the Dragonmaw in Outland.>

Thank you <name>, you are a font of knowledge! This is more than Sabellian was able to tell me.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
