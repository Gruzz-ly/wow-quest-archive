==Objectives==
Meet [[Merithra]] at the base of [[Amirdrassil]].

==Description==
This tree has grown peacefully in the [[Emerald Dream]] since it was planted here. We have watched over it and nurtured it.

And now, just when it is about to leave the cradle of this realm and enter [[Azeroth]], our enemies see it as a means to further their own plans.

It is so much more.

Come. Let us go to Amirdrassil.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
We arrived just in time. We must intercept [[Elder Cassaphine|Cassaphine]] before she can do any harm to the tree... or to us.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Merithra|Amirdrassil! "Crown of Harmony." Grown of two [[Plane|realms]], a window between [[death]] and [[life]].}}
:''Merithra transforms into her dragon form and flies toward Amirdrassil.''
:{{Text|say|Merithra|[[The Sisters' Tear|Its seed]] was gifted to [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] by the [[Winter Queen]]. Here in the Emerald Dream, it thrives.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|But there are others who would seize its power and use it for their own ends. We cannot let them.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|We of the [[green dragonflight]] and countless lost [[soul]]s have pledged to keep it safe. We must be vigilant until it takes its place in the world.}}
:''Merithra lands in front of Tyrande Whisperwind.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Merithra, we must speak. One of the [[Elder Cassaphine|elder dryads]] approaches, but she is... not herself. She is one with [[Druids of the Flame|the flame]].}}

Besides the gossip text Tyrande had in the [[Ancient Bough]], she has a new gossip option:
{{book|content=
{{Gossip|What does Amirdrassil mean?}}

Amirdrassil means "Crown of Harmony."

It is a symbol of our hopes and our aspirations for a restored future.

When I held the [[Finel|last child]] of [[Darnassus]] in my arms, I wished desperately that it was not the end of us. But I know that in order to have that future, we must fight for it.

That is why we defend this tree, and when it blooms, [[Elune|Goddess]] willing, we will have our home once more.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
