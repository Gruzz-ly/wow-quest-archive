==Objectives==
Clear out [[Skyfire Turret]]s and mark Primalist Flame Wards.
* Northern Skyfire Turrets destroyed (3) {{co|26.1|27.6|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* First Flame Ward marked
* Western Skyfire Turrets destroyed (3) {{co|24.4|32.1|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* Second Flame Ward marked
* Southern Skyfire Turrets destroyed (3) {{co|28.2|34.8|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* Final Flame Ward marked

==Description==
The notes you found, combined with [[Merithra]]'s reconnaissance, have revealed [[Ashendir Hartwood|Ashendir]]'s plan. The flame wards that surround the [[Wellspring Temple]] are blocking our reinforcements.

Our allies will distract [[Fyrakk]] while you and I slip behind enemy lines to destroy the wards.

The skies are filled with drakes, and I must fend them off. Once you find a flame ward and thin out its defenses, signal me to destroy it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chartreuse Champion's Legplates
|Summer Soother's Leggings
|Spirited Stag's Legguards
|Fearless Faerie's Trousers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Fyrakk may have retreated, but he still aims to destroy the barrier protecting the Wellspring Temple. We must break through the enemy's ranks and stop him.

It is there we will put an end to his machinations, once and for all.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We will destroy the flame wards while [[Vyranoth]] holds Fyrakk's attention.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Signal our allies once the wards are down. This is our only chance.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|And now to face Fyrakk. He who was once my brother.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Take care. Too many have been lost today.}}
:''The named characters all fly or run off.''

Head to the marked area, destroy the three smaller turrets, then approach the larger flame ward and use the Call Alexstrasza extra action button to call Alexstrasza down to destroy it:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I will destroy the flame ward! Stand back!}}

Head west to the next area to repeat the process:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Excellent work! Leave the rest to me!}}

One more time with the southern set to start an [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cinematic]]:

:''Fyrakk lands and changes to his visage as well and approaches her.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|It seems your reign is finished, Alexstrasza.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You once fought for an ideal, Fyrakk.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Now, you merely seek power.}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|<Sinister laugh> Yes.}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|And you are in my way.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Amirdrassil will never be yours.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Your obsession will destroy you.}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|<Mocking chuckle>}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|This is your end, Alexstrasza.}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|The Dragon Queen dies alone.}}
:''Fyrakk prepares to strike Alexstrasza with [[Fyr'alath the Dreamrender|Dream Render]].''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I am not alone!}}
:''An axe hits Fyrakk, interrupting his attack.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|<Grunts>}}
:''Camera then moves to reveal it be [[Thrall]]'s axe.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|Hmm...}}
:''Fyrakk looks on the ridge, with Thrall, [[Khadgar]], [[Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]], and [[Mayla Highmountain]]. All around them more forces join in: [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]] [[centaur]], [[Khanam Matra Sarest]], [[Sansok Khan]], [[Okir]], and [[Tigari Khan]], then [[Gelbin Mekkatorque]] with [[Toddy Whiskers]] and [[Naleidea Rivergleam]], [[Lilian Voss]] with [[Rexxar]] and [[Rokhan]], [[Velen]] and [[Moira Thaurissan]] with [[dracthyr]], and [[Turalyon]] with [[Lor'themar Theron]] and [[Genn Greymane]].''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Do you not see?}}
:''Fyrakk starts backing up, and Alexstrasza stands up.''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|All of Azeroth stands united against you.}}
:''All the heroes and more dragons in the sky stare at Fyrakk, with Jaina and other casters firing spells at him.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|<Surprised grunt>}}
:''Fyrakk jumps and transforms into dragon form.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|<Frustrated roar>}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|It is time to end this!}}
:''Fyrakk turns and flies away.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|You will all burn together!}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Defenders of the Dream!}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Do not let him escape.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, the player has made it up onto the ridge where [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], [[Vyranoth]], [[Merithra]], and a host of [[Kaldorei Sentinel (Emerald Dream)|Kaldorei Sentinels]] and [[Kaldorei Archer]]s, as well as a [[Green Dragon (Emerald Dream)|Green Dragon]], [[Ancient Protector (Emerald Dream)|Ancient Protectors]], and [[Gnarlroot]]:
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Azeroth has answered us! Amirdrassil shall not fall.}}

The whole area is phased to show the newly arrived heroes fighting the enemies.
