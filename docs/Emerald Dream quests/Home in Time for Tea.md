==Objectives==
Meet [[Wrathion]], [[Mordenaku]], and [[Vyranoth]] in the Roasted Ram Inn in [[Valdrakken]].
*Retire to the [[Roasted Ram]]

==Description==
I must admit, I did not expect to be altering the future of [[Netherwing|my flight]] when I arrived. But it feels as though we belong here. Perhaps this is the call they spoke of...

Regardless, I am looking forward to some rest.

Wrathion mentioned retiring to the Roasted Ram Inn.

Can you meet us there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Roasted Ram Special]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
I am looking forward to some rest.

==Completion==
The safety and future of the netherwing has been secured, <name>.

Traveling from [[Outland]] to [[Azeroth]] has been overwhelming, but in the best of ways. I am glad you were here.

My flight flourishes. I cannot thank you enough for your aid over the years.

==Notes==
Approach the dragons in the inn:
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Are you certain of this?}}
:{{Text|emote|Wrathion nods.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|I have no reason to doubt what I have been told. But let us discuss this later. For now, we welcome our new friends to the [[Valdrakken Accord]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|Thank you for your kindness--and thank you, <name>, for your continued aid. The netherwing look forward to settling here on Azeroth.}}

They each have new gossip:

{{book|Mordenaku|content=
I understand that [[Khadgar]] is in the [[Dragon Isles]]? 

Once my flight is settled, I should pay him a visit. Tales of his time in [[Shattrath]] reached even my ears in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

{{Gossip|What has your flight been doing since they were freed?}}

We have been surviving--free we may be, but Outland is still a harsh place to live.

You know, I have heard strange murmurings about Illidan Stormrage. Perhaps when we have more time, you can tell me the tale? I suspect you were involved one way or another.

Ah, but enough about my thoughts!

<Name>, we can never repay what you've done for our kind. The netherwing will always stand with you.

{{book|Vyranoth|content=
<The air around Vyranoth is significantly cooler. Although she appears to be calm, it is clear that something has deeply upset her.>

{{Gossip|Is everything all right?}}

Wrathion has been telling me about the [[storm drake]]s. The [[Thorignir]] and their... "creator."

[[Odyn]].

He has virtually enslaved these dragons, after declaring our kind unworthy of protecting Azeroth!
}}

{{book|Wrathion|content=
I think that went rather well, <name>.

The netherwing have joined our cause, and their numbers have been added to the [[Dragonflight|flights]] of the [[Dragon Isles]].

Now we turn our attention to the Thorignir.

Vyranoth seems to be quite invested in their future, wouldn't you say?

{{Gossip|What did you tell her?}}

Only that Keeper Odyn uplifted another flight of dragons to be his personal chauffeurs, lackeys and lapdogs.

<Wrathion ponders a moment.>

There's also the bit about insisting the dragons did not deserve to defend the world, and the part about selling [[Eye of the Jailer|his eye]] for forbidden knowledge, and that whole "subjecting an adopted child to an eternity of torment to suit his needs" moment, as well as abandoning his duties as prime designate...

But those affronts don't seem to... disturb her quite as much as the treatment the storm dragons have received.

;Mordenaku
:{{Gossip|How have you been since we freed your flight?}}
::I have been doing well, dealing with living in Outland.

::Vicious monsters. Ravaged landscape. The usual.

::I understand [[Illidan]] was resurrected recently, and helped save [[Azeroth]]? I find that hard to imagine.

::Ah, but enough about my thoughts!

::<Name>, you have helped so much. Your tales are already popular among my flight for your actions in freeing us.

::I hope you are ready for your legend to double after today!

:{{Gossip|What is it like to live on Outland?}}
::A unique challenge. Between the torn landscape and the world's more... aggressive denizens, life is a constant struggle.

::There is beauty to be found, but nothing quite like the scenery here.
