==Objectives==
Weaken the [[Primalists|Primalist]] encampment in the [[Primalist Stronghold]].
* Hinder Primalist forces (0/100%)

==Description==
After [[Vyranoth]] left, [[Fyrakk]] put all four of the Claws of Vyranoth on different tasks.

He left me in charge of this camp and told me to keep the portals open at all costs. The [[Druids of the Flame]] are empowering the portals for the Primalist's reinforcements to come through. 

We should close those portals and thin out their ranks.
