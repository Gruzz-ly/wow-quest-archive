==Objectives==
Dragonride or ride the Faerie Drake to consume fiery patches in the Dream.
*Summon Your [[Dragonriding]] Mount or Mount [[Faerie Drake]] (Optional)
*[[Flame Tear|Flames]] Eaten (12)
*Meet [[Cenarius]] by the [[Shallow Crossing]] in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].

==Description==
Already [[Fyrakk]] damages the fabric of the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]]. I can feel it burning, as if flames were consuming my scales.

And I know that simmering agony is only a fraction of what [[Gerithus|my son]] felt when Fyrakk tormented him.

But we have a potent weapon against this fire. Our [[Faerie dragon|faerie drakes and dragons]] consume what does not belong here. They are excellent allies, if a bit difficult to manage.

Now they need our help. Use this. Clear the skies of encroaching flame.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
The Dream is my home and the home of [[Green dragonflight|my flight]]. I will not let it fall to fire.

==Completion==
Fyrakk may attack the tree at any moment. We will need the help of the other [[Wild God]]s.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Merithra]]|Faerie dragons are special creatures, colorful and unpredictable.  Take to the skies and witness how they spread their wings.}}

Using a dragonriding mount shows the usual rings that need to be flown through. Alternatively, interact with the [[Faerie Drake]] nearby, and it automatically collects the flames:
:<The faerie drake eyes you expectantly. Or perhaps it is trying to think of how to eat your armor.>
:{{Gossip|{{Text|rare|(Accessibility)}} Help me fly.}}

First flame eaten:
:{{Text|say|Merithra|[[Cenarius]], how long until Fyrakk reaches the tree?}}
:{{Text|say|Cenarius|He has not yet threatened it directly, sister. But every moment we wait, the danger grows.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|We must gather more allies to our side. Will the Wild Gods come?}}
:{{Text|say|Cenarius|Some have. Yet we must summon more and rally the denizens of the Dream.}}

Cenarius has gossip:
{{book|content=
For eons, we watched over the Dream. We suffered onslaughts and defeats, but we must hold here. The flames cannot reach our heart.

{{Gossip|Who are you?}}

I am Cenarius, and I am the Lord of the Forest. I taught the [[Night elf|night elves]] how to fully embrace nature as [[druid]]s, and I defend the Emerald Dream.

My path has not always been an easy one, nor have I always been on the correct side of wars. But I have returned, stronger than ever. I will stand with Merithra and the dragonflights as they help bring [[Amirdrassil|the World Tree]] into [[Azeroth]].

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
