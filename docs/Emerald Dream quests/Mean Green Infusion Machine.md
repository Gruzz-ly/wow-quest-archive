==Objectives==
Kill 6 [[podling]]s and [[lasher]]s in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].
*Dream Infusion extracted (6)

==Description==
Pleased to meet you. I am [[Elianna]], a Dream Researcher.

A strange phenomenon has recently been detected in [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]]. Fragments of dream [[magic]] are being left behind by the creatures here.

I'm curious to know the effects of such magic in concentrated doses. But I need someone to extract it for me.

There are some problematic lashers and podlings to the south of here.

Several of them should be enough for a lesser infusion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

{{itembox||Rithro

==Progress==
Have you brought me enough Dream energy?

==Completion==
Excellent! We should be able to perform the infusion!

==Notes==
Kill [[Sickly Lasher]]s and [[Meddling Podling]]s.
