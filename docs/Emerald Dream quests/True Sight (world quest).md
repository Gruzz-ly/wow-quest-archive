;Speaking with Albon the Watcher
:<The wise owl looks you up and down. You feel particularly vulnerable under her gaze.>

:The guardians of the Dream grant me the ability to converse with non-owls such as yourself.

:Our Dream is under attack. Many of the forest creatures will suffer a fiery doom due to ingesting cinderpollen, though they may appear unaffected at first glance.

:My wild god grants me the power to detect these flame-ridden creatures. Slay them before they become a greater threat.

:If you require a demonstration of true sight's power, just ask. Otherwise, my power is in your hands.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Show me how True Sight works.}}
:{{Text|say|Albon the Watcher|This power highlights our enemies clearly in red, for a time. They cannot hide behind trees and rocks.}}
:{{Text|say|Albon the Watcher|Now, slay them so that our forest is safe!}}
