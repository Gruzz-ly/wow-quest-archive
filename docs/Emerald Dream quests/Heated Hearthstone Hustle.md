==Objectives==
Retrieve the Heated Hearthstone from [[the Stonewarmer]].
*[[Heated Hearthstone]]
*Give Heated Hearthstone to [[Thaalean]]
*Have Thaalean test the [[Leaf Blanket|Blanket]]

==Description==
Wait, my hearthstone! I can't sleep without my [[:hearthstone]].

A djaradin stole it during our last battle. It stays warm perpetually and I always sleep with it.

I hate that I must ask more of you, but could you get my hearthstone?

The djaradin that stole it should be near [[Fyrakk]]'s army, just north of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* 5x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Progress==
My eyes grow tired, but my body is still awake...

==Completion==
Gah! I still can not fall asleep! I am embarrassed to ask but there is only one option left.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Thaalean|Please get my hearthstone! I can't sleep without it!}}
:''Thaalean places a [[Leaf Blanket]].''

Head to the [[Fields of Reverie]] and attack the Stonewarmer:
:{{Text|say|The Stonewarmer|Death to the [[Dragon]]s!}}

;Death
:{{Text|say|The Stonewarmer|If only I could... take down one more dragon...}}

With the hearthstone return to Thaalean and speak with him:
:I wish I could fall asleep.
