'''The Q'onzu Query''' begins an optional storyline in the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Approach Q'onzu again and ask what they've been up to.
*Find [[Q'onzu]]'s nest
*Speak to the Follower of Q'onzu

==Description==
Champion, I understand we were unable to convince Q'onzu to join us. However, we need all the aid we can gather.   

You must discover why they refuse to aid us and convince them of the right path. Q'onzu and I have a rather strained relationship. Your efforts could bear more fruit. 

I hear Q'onzu has built a nest near [[Shiversnap Grove]]. Would you go and approach them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}

==Completion==
Q'onzu said a visitor would come. Baring{{sic}} offerings, I hope?

==Notes==
Head to the Whorlwing Basin and approach Dreamkin.
