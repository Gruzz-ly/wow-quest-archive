'''A Better Future, Together''' concludes the "A Call to Aid" side story of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Help Shae'lune perform the separation ritual on [[Shandris]].
*Talk to [[Shae'lune]] about the ritual
*[[Somnium Bark]] (2)
*[[Sleeping Glory]] (5)
*Ingredients mixed in the bowl of moon water
*Help Shandris drink the remedy

==Description==
<Name>, we need to work with Shae'lune and help her perform the purification ritual on Shandris.

Shae'lune says she's only done it on objects before--not people. There is some... risk involved.

But I've come to know Shandris. She'd do the same for me.

Talk to Shae'lune and follow her instructions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 7,600 [[XP]]
* [[Drops of Moon Water]]
* [[A Muddy Journal]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I will help Shandris as best I can. It's the least I can do for another soldier.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>, for helping us with [[Raelas Firewind|Raelas]] and with the spirit stones.

I will take care of Shandris for now and help her back to Amirdrassil soon.

==Notes==
Speak with Shaelune:
{{book|content=
We have to hurry if we want to help Shandris.

I will explain what has to be done once you are ready.

{{Gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Shae'lune|I will need a handful of sleeping glory flowers and a bit of somnium bark.}}
:{{text|say|Shae'lune|Gather those, and I will have the moon water bowl ready by your return.}}

Head southeast to find the ingredients in the [[Meandering Rootlands]], then return back. Shae'lune has new gossip:

{{book|content=
While I have performed this ritual on flora and fauna before, I have never tried it on a... well, anything more than a small animal, and that thought alone makes me doubt the ritual's effectiveness.

But having Lilian here, watching her care for Shandris... Maybe I was wrong about her... kind. 

Maybe there is hope.

Next to her is a [[Moon Water Ritual Bowl]]. Interact with it to brew the [[Ritual Remedy]]:
:{{text|say|Shae'lune|Good, now have Shandris drink the mixture.}}

Speak with Shandris:
{{book|content=
<Shandris is exhausted. She breathes slowly while whispering to herself in her sleep.>

{{gossip|quest=|Here, try and drink this remedy.}}
}}

:{{Text|say|Shae'lune|Rise, spirit. Let go of Shandris Feathermoon and return to your home within [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]].}}
:''A [[Cleansed Dream Spirit]] appears.''
:{{Text|emote|The spirit hovers up and down before Lilian.}}
:{{Text|emote|Lilian nods with acceptance.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Is it over?}}
:''The spirit flies away.''
:{{Text|say|Shae'lune|The ritual is over. Shandris will get better with time, but she needs someone to be there for her. Someone she can talk to.}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|I'll stay and help Shandris.}}
:{{text|say|Shae'lune|You? Why?}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Because I've also been through loss too.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|And I want her to know my people are not what they were.}}
:{{text|emote|Shae'lune nods and begins studying the grass at her feet.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Lilian, I want to thank you for coming after me--and apologize.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The spirit caused all my past pain to surface. You did not deserve my ire.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|I've heard worse. But a word of advice? Don't hold on to that pain. Let it go.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I have been living with these memories for eons. I don't know a life without them haunting my mind.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Someone told me that we all have pieces of our past that haunt us. But we can work towards a better future.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|That is... wise. You are a good friend, Lilian.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Friend? No one's called me that in awhile. Rest. We'll go to Amirdrassil when you're ready.}}

Keeper Sillas has new gossip:
{{book|content=
This petty war of yours have ravaged our home.

It will take many years to undo the damage.
