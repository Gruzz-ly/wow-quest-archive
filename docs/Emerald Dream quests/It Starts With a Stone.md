*Upgrade a piece of equipment with [[:Flightstones]]

==Description==
[[Emerald Dream (zone)|This land]] holds so many secrets. And even more power!

And you... we both know you enjoy unraveling secrets and collecting marvelous gear. And when you're ready to unlock the power of gear you find in this new land, come visit Cuzolth and me. We are experimenting and will be able to upgrade your gear by the time you come back.

Please bring me some Flightstones and a new item so I can show you how these upgrades work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*100x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Can you feel the power? The excitement of knowing you can now take on even more daring adventures?

==Completion==
Now look at all that shine and glitter! 

Please accept these gifts.

==Notes==
As in [[Zaralek Cavern]], get at least 50 [[Flightstones]] from any activity, then upgrade a [[Dragonflight Season 3]] item. Any previous quest reward will suffice. 

==Progression==
{{Enter the Dream}}

;Description
My first impression of this land is that it holds many secrets!

My first impression of you is that you like unraveling secrets and collect marvelous gear, which leads me to believe you may want to... make that gear better. Wouldn't you?

You may have heard of Flghtstones before, but did you know that my friend, Cuzolth, and yours truly can unlock the stones' true power to upgrade your gear?

I urge you to bring me some Flightstones and an Explorer tier item so I can show you how upgrading works.
