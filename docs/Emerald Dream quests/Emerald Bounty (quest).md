==Objectives==
Partake in the [[Emerald Frenzy]] to earn [[Emerald Dewdrop]]s and contribute a [[Dreamseed]] to sprout new growths.
*Dreamseed contributed to an Emerald Bounty
*Emerald Frenzy completed to earn Emerald Dewdrops

==Description==
There are so many more species to locate and study. As you explore the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Dream]], you will find more seeds known as Dreamseeds. Please, nurture them to continue our studies, and enjoy the bounty they share with you!

You will find Dreamseeds all over, but many are hoarded by powerful creatures around the Dream.

Additionally, you should keep an eye out for the surge of life energy we call an Emerald Frenzy. It will be a source of many Emerald Dewdrops, which will help in nurturing Dreamseeds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]
