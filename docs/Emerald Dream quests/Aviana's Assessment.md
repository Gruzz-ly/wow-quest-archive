==Objectives==
Collect 20 Bloodied Armor Scraps.
*[[Bloodied Armor Scrap]]s (20)

==Description==
<[[Aviana]]'s eyes narrow as she watches the [[Druids of the Flame]] far below.>

[[Q'onzu]] may be content with letting these [[heretic]]s destroy the very fabric of [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]], but I am not.

Bring me scraps of their armor stained with blood as proof of your deed.

Do not hold back, <name>. Remember what these heathens are capable of.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Every minute they are left uncontested, another portion of the Dream is lost to their heinous acts.

==Completion==
Actions speak louder than inquiries, champion.

Remember that the next time your prey invades your homeland.

<Aviana shoots a cruel side-eye towards Q'onzu. >

==Notes==
Loot the armor scraps from [[Searing Herbalist]]s and [[Searing Rootguard]]s in the [[Meandering Rootlands]].

The first druid killed will drop [[Ashphodel Research Notes (item)]], starting [[Ashphodel Research Notes]].

==Progression==
