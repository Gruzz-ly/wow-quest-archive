==Objectives==
Collect 8 Uprooted Ashphodels.
*[[Uprooted Ashphodel]] (8)

==Description==
<[[Aviana]]'s gaze remains locked on [[Q'onzu]] for a moment, her brow furrowed.>

While I don't see eye to eye with Q'onzu's fascination for change, their incessant inquiry has unveiled a more deep-seated plot than originally suspected.

Putting down the wildlife won't mean much if we don't tear out the root of the cause.

Locate the burning ashphodels in the glade below and tear them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
If the ashphodels are allowed to spread their foul pollen unchecked, then the rest of the dream is in grave danger.

<Aviana grimaces.>

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.

I'll ensure [[Cenarius]] is made aware of the damage these weeds have inflicted. A few [[dryad]]s should be able to clear up any remaining pollen or flowers you might have missed.

<Aviana's gaze drops to the [[Druids of the Flame|Druid of the Flame]] incursion point directly below.>

All but one task remains now, Champion.

==Notes==
Head back to the [[Meandering Rootlands]] and loot [[Burning Ashphodel]]s.

On return:
:{{text|say|Q'onzu|Come now, Aviana! Is credit not due where credit is earned?}}
:{{text|say|Aviana|Your penchant for fascinated inaction has finally yielded fruit. Do try your best not to choke on it.}}
:{{text|say|Q'onzu|You wound me, oh Lady of the Birds. Do not mistaken my curiosity for change for meaningless inaction.}}
:{{text|emote|Aviana twitches and ruffles her wings in aggravation.}}
