'''Burning Out''' begins an optional side storyline of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]], unlocked the week of 14 November 2023.

==Objectives==
Find [[Solarys Thorngale|Solarys]]'s siblings in the [[Smoldering Copse]].
*Find [[Lyandris Thorngale]]
*Find [[Thaeldus Thorngale]]
*Find [[Kery'nael Thorngale]]
*Return to Solarys at the [[Central Encampment]].

==Description==
Please, I know how this looks, but we are on the same side!

My siblings and I intended to defect from the [[Druids of the Flame|Flame]] together. However, none of them have escaped or met up with me since I left, and it's been days! I fear the worst.

Do you think I would be begging for aid, alone and unarmed, if I was not honest? Please, find them. They are all I have left.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Kal'andu]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]
* 3x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Progress==
Whatever you need from me, just find them, please!

==Completion==
<Solarys's face falls, clouding with grief at your explanation.>

Finite moments with my family are worth more than an eternity of regrets. Life itself is worth more than that, but my pleas fell on deaf ears.

Thank you for saving what little of my family is left.

One of the little creatures Kery'nael helped saved{{sic}} seems to have taken a liking to you. Please take them. It's the least we can offer the poor thing.

==Notes==
;On approach
:''Solarys Thorngale is kneeling in front of two [[Amirdrassil Defenders]].''
:{{Text|say|Solarys Thorngale|Please, listen to me, I am not here as an enemy!}}
:{{Text|say|Amirdrassil Defender (1)|Silence, traitor!}}
:{{Text|say|Amirdrassil Defender (2)|Why should we trust a word you say?}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Amirdrassil Defender (1)|We'll keep an eye on her until you return, <class>.}}

Head to the Smoldering Copse and find the corpse of [[Lyandris Thorngale]] at {{Co|38.0|47.2|Emerald Dream|link=Emerald Dream (zone)}}:
{{book|content=
<This young druid lays still, cauterized lacerations covering her body.>

<She is curled around a journal protectively, even in death. Prying it from her fingers reveals a name in neat script on the inside cover: Lyandris Thorngale.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Take the journal.>}}
}}

After taking the journal:
{{book|content=
<This young druid lays still, cauterized lacerations covering her body.>
}}

Next to Lyandris is [[Singed Leaflet]] which starts [[A Passed Torch]]. Continue to the cave at {{Co|34.8|45.0|Emerald Dream|link=Emerald Dream (zone)}} to find [[Slain Lunarwing Darter]]s and a meditating [[Thaeldus Thorngale]]. Speak with him:
{{book|content=
Leave me be. I am in no mood for interruptions.

{{Gossip|quest=|Your sister Solarys sent me to find you.}}
}}

:{{Text|say|Thaeldus Thorngale|I am aware of her... misguided attempts to lead myself and my siblings astray.}}
:{{Text|say|Thaeldus Thorngale|I won't let her drag me around like we're children still--I am not so cowardly as to waver from the Flame's heat.}}
:{{Text|say|Thaeldus Thorngale|In fact, she has yet to witness my prize for loyalty. Allow me to demonstrate, <class>.}}
:''Thaeldus changes to hostile and attacks.''
:{{Text|say|Thaeldus Thorngale|I have tasted true power, purged the weak with it. Solarys is a fool to think I'd turn from the Flame!}}
:{{Text|say|Thaeldus Thorngale|Lyandris was pitifully easy to kill, and Kery'nael barely has a will to break. They are all blind!}}
:{{Text|yell|Thaeldus Thorngale|Nothing will hinder the Flame--we will have our ascension! I will cull all who stand in our way!}}

When Thaeldus reaches 20% HP:
:{{Text|yell|Thaeldus Thorngale|You will burn with the--AGH! NO--IT HURTS!}}
:''Thaeldus is {{Abilities|Consumed by Flame|id=422641|icon=ability_mage_livingbomb}} and dies.''
:{{Text|say|Thaeldus Thorngale|I have no family... only ash.}}

Continue to {{Co|38.7|43.6|Emerald Dream|link=Emerald Dream (zone)}} to find [[Kery'nael Thorngale]] surrounded by more Slain Lunarwing Darters and kneeling by a [[Singed Lunarwing Juvenile]] and a [[Innocent Lunarwing Hatchling]].
:{{Text|say|Kery'nael Thorngale|What have I done?}}

Speak with him:
{{book|content=
Must we sacrifice innocent life to prolong our own? Is this truly [[druidism]], or just madness?

{{Gossip|quest=|Your sister Solarys sent me to find you. Are you alright?}}
<br />
{{Gossip|quest=|Get up, kid. Your sister sent me to find you, and there's no time for a pity party.}}

Solarys is alive? Thank goodness! She disappeared days ago.

She told us that the Flame was just using us, that there was nothing for us with them. She wanted us to escape, but Thael argued we'd be abandoning our only chance at a new home.

Would a new home require us to burn innocent creatures? Solarys was right. This is no family. This is a [[cult]].

{{Gossip|quest=|Go join your sister. She is in the Central Encampment under [[Amirdrassil]].}}
}}

:{{Text|say|Kery'nael Thorngale|I should have listened to Solarys when she first told me the Flame's philosophies were insanity.}}
:{{Text|say|Kery'nael Thorngale|Thank you, <class>. I will go to her by a roundabout path, to avoid the Flame.}}
:''Kery'nael runs away and the two faerie dragons follow him.''

Return to find Solarys and Kery'nael further in the encampment.
