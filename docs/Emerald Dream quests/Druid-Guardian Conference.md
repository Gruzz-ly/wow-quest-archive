==Objectives==
Speak with Ethidris Creekward about raising a [[dryad]] in the [[Root-Bound Sanctuary]].
*Answer [[Ethidris Creekward|Ethidris]]'s questions

==Description==
Typically, the [[druid]] assigned to a dryad sanctuary would guide a newborn dryad until they were ready to take on a position of their own.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to separate a dryad from whoever she imprints on.

<Ethidris sighs and rubs his eyes.>

Which she has made very clear. Regardless, tell me about yourself. Perhaps you will be just as apt a caretaker as I would have been.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|4|50}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*[[Dryad-Keeper Credentials]]

==Progress==
<Ethidris furrows his brow at [[Dionaessa]].>

Among so many other things happening right now, there's a new dryad to raise.

==Completion==
You regularly engage in combat and you solve problems. Sometimes for yourself, sometimes for others.

That honestly does not sound too far off from my experience with dryads.

I think Dionaessa will be fine.

==Notes==
Speak with Ethidris again:
:I only have a few questions, <name>.

:How often do you assist others with tasks?

:{{Gossip|I often embark on quests on behalf of others.}}
:{{Gossip|If I'm going to do a chore, you can bet it's for me alone.}}
:{{Gossip|If there are any quests remaining on [[Azeroth]], I will find them.}}
:{{Gossip|The tasks don't matter as much as the reward.}}
:{{Gossip|When the task is fun, sometimes.}}
:{{Gossip|<Indicate something else.>}}
::Well, good to know, then. Dryads take on many duties during their lifespan. Preparing Dionaessa for them is rather important.

::Now. How would you describe your general disposition?

::{{Gossip|Not even a fourth [[Burning Legion|Legion]] invasion could sour my day.}}
::{{Gossip|If I could become a shadow and cling to the dark spaces of the world, I would.}}
::{{Gossip|I'm sure my reputation precedes me.}}
::{{Gossip|I never back down from a fight. I'll always win.}}
::{{Gossip|I'm not sure. I can be whatever, I guess.}}
::{{Gossip|<Indicate something else.>}}
:::That's... fine. Dryads can be exuberant, so you may meet your match here.

:::Last question. What do you consider your greatest failure?

:::{{Gossip|I failed to protect someone I care about.}}
:::{{Gossip|I let an enemy escape on my watch. Never again.}}
:::{{Gossip|I forgot the flour in a cake I made once.}}
:::{{Gossip|I failed to bring the proper equipment on a dire mission.}}
:::{{Gossip|I never fail.}}
:::{{Gossip|<Indicate something else.>}}
:{{Text|say|Ethidris Creekward|I think that's enough. You've led an interesting life, <name>.}}
