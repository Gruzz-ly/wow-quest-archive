'''The Ember Still Smolders''' concludes the [[Eye of Ysera]] chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]]. The next chapter, A Dream of Fields and Fire, starts immediately after with [[The Bloom Begins]].

==Objectives==
Regroup with [[Merithra]] at [[Amirdrassil]].

==Description==
I... almost cannot believe this worked. I am ever grateful for everyone's trust and faith. We could not have won this battle without the help of our allies and [[green dragonflight|the flight]].

But the fight is far from over. Based on the intel we have gathered, [[Fyrakk]] and his minions are preparing an even greater assault. Their bases stand strong and terrifying close to the Dream's Hope, bastion of Amirdrassil.

[[Eye of Ysera|The Eye]] might have only been a distraction. We will regroup at Amirdrassil with the rest of our allies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Tears of the Eye]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]

==Completion==
Thank you for coming, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Gerithus]]|[[Galok Wingslicer|Galok]] is defeated! The Eye is safe again. We did it, mother!}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|But Amirdrassil is still at risk. [[Igira]] and Fyrakk...}}
:{{text|say|[[Ysera]]|We will deal with them in time, Merithra. For now, we must meditate and consider our next course of action.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|And to do that, we must deepen your bond with the Dream. You must take my place and commune with the Eye.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Mother, the Eye has always been yours. I cannot--}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|You can. I believed the Eye rejected me because of my fall. But, I know now it was not my fall, but your rise.}}
:{{text|say|[[Lord Itharius]]|Take what time you need, Merithra. We will be waiting once you have meditated on the Eye.}}
:{{text|say|[[Somnikus]]|Yes. We will follow your lead when you are ready, Merithra.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Thank you. All of you. I need time with the Eye, but we will regroup soon at Amirdrassil.}}

No teleport back to the [[Central Encampment]], so fly there the hard way.

On complete:
:{{text|say|[[Vyranoth]]|Fyrakk still assaults the [[Wellspring Temple]], but the barrier holds strong.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alexstrasza]] the Life-Binder|As long as it remains intact, the World Tree is safe.}}
