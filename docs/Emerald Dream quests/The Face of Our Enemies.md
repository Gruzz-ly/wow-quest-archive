==Objectives==
Defeat [[Fyrakk]]'s powerful [[lieutenant]]s and secure the battlefield.
*[[Stormbrand Ko'mal]] slain
*[[Apostle Fenarelle]] slain
*Meet [[Merithra]] in the [[Fields of Reverie]].

==Description==
Powerful foes lurk among the enemies Fyrakk summoned into the [[Emerald Dream]].

I have not seen [[Elder Cassaphine|Cassaphine]] since she came up out of the [[Barrows of Reverie|barrows]].

Find her, and assist our allies by striking down these leaders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
It saddens me to see the children of the Dream so twisted.

==Completion==
This is far worse than I thought. Every time we close a portal, Druids of the Flame open more.

I fear greater dangers are waiting to come through.

==Notes==
After the [[adventurer]] accepts both this quest and [[Burning Assault]], Cenarius rushes to join in the fray.

Approach [[Stormbrand Ko'mal]] at {{Co|64.1|68.1|Emerald Dream (zone)}} to see a injured [[Aronus]]. Approaching the dragon to see him stand up and leave the battlefield.

On the opposite side at {{Co|61.3|69.0|Emerald Dream (zone)}} is [[Apostle Fenarelle]]. In front of her are [[Ashendir Hartwood]] and [[Elder Cassaphine]].

:{{Text|say|Elder Cassaphine|My heart burns with renewal.}}
:''Cassaphine is infused with fire power. They enter a portal, leaving behind the apostle.''

==Progression==
{{Enter the Dream}}
