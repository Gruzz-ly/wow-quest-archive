'''The Right Food...''' is the third quest in a series of five that eventually rewards the [[Reins of the Ochre Dreamtalon]] mount. This quest has both a required 72-hour wait in order to complete and the standard six daily-reset wait before the next quest is offered.

==Objectives==
Bring some fertilizer for the plant.
* Ask [[Professor Ash]] for advice
* Acquire the Fertilizer Ingredients
* Combine the Fertilizer Compound using the Plant Matter
* Wait for the Fertilizer to finish composting (Optional)
* Spread the completed fertilizer around the sapling
* Entertain the plant with a few words

==Description==
<The plant is now a promising sapling and has thrived with the attention you've given.

Peering closely at the plant's leaves, you see its exterior brimming with dew. Perhaps the right food will help the plant even further.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
<The plant is hydrated, but remains severely underfed.>

==Completion==
<The soil around the sapling glows faintly.>

==Notes==
Ash is a few yards away:
{{book|content=
I could sense the rejuvenative energy you've been cultivating here and I had to see it for myself.

Incredible!

I think with a little push we can see this sapling bloom.

{{gossip|quest=|Professor, what do you know about feeding plants?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|Ah, there's no better place to find that knowledge than a copy of my book, "Ash's Recipes to Delight and Nourish your Plant Pals."}}
:''Ash hands over a copy of [[Ash's Recipes to Delight and Nourish Your Plant Pals]].''
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|Don't worry about paying me for it. Knowing that I helped bring a better life to plant friends the world over is payment enough.}}

{{book|content=
{{gossip|Where were the Dreamtalons I saw here before?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|Ah, yes. The little Dreamtalon kits are small but ferocious creatures. They learn to hunt and feed with the Dragonflies that reside around these plants.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|Or they used to, before this plant and those like it were burned away.}}

The book reads:
{{book|Ash's Recipes to Delight and Nourish Your Plant Pals|content=
<The first few pages are for plant species that you don't recognize.>
----
<This page looks relevant.>

When your plant friend is in dire need of nourishment, this is the only recipe that will be sure to put life in their leaves, and spring in their stalk. To collect in any order:

- Five (5) fresh [[Tel'Abim Banana|Bananas]], found at your local grocer or innkeep.

- Three (3) handfuls of eggshell shards, left from the [[Cantankerous Turtle]]s found on the [[Summerjoy Shoal|southern shore]].

- Five (5) generous bushels of [[:Lasher Plant Matter]], sourced from [[lasher]]s within the Emerald Dream.

Combine thoroughly and rest for at least three days. When complete, spread liberally around the base of the plant.

Topping the evening off with some friendly conversation will support the food's rejuvenative effects.
}}

Ash has additional gossip after handing over the book:

:{{Gossip|Where can I find some fresh bananas?}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|I'd check with Saelienne, our local innkeep that's camped near Amirdrassil.}}
:{{Gossip|The eggshells you mention in your book. Where can I find them?}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|I prefer the ones found from the Cantankerous Turtles. The shells are nutrient-rich and degrade quickly.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|You can find them south of here, along the Summerjoy Shoal.}}
:{{Gossip|So about this plant matter you mention in the recipe...}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|The Sprigling Gloam and Singing Fen to the northeast is teeming with lashers.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|But you should be able to find them all over if you explore.}}

[[Saelienne]], the innkeeper at {{co|49.9|61.6|Emerald Dream (zone)}} sells a stack of 5 [[Tel'Abim Banana]] for {{cost||1|25}}.

The [[Cantankerous Turtle]]s are found in the vicinity of {{co|44|80|Emerald Dream (zone)}} at the [[Summerjoy Shoal]] on the southwestern shore of the island. Look for [[Turtle Egg]]s in protected spots in the area and loot the [[Turtle Eggshell Shards]].

Lashers are all over the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]], but there's a concentration of [[Enraged Velvet Lasher]]s and [[Enraged Velveteen Lasher]]s around {{co|57|80|Emerald Dream (zone)}} on the southeastern [[Slumbersome Shores]] that drop [[Lasher Plant Matter]].

Use the non-banana ingredients to make the [[Combined Fertilizer Ingredients]]. Despite the "(Optional)" tag in the objectives, waiting the three days for the combined ingredients to finish composting into the [[Primed Emerald Dream Fertilizer]] is required. Once that time has elapsed, interact with the Dewy Sapling:

{{book|content=
The plant is looking green and dewy from the potent water you've provided.

Perhaps in the near future you can help it further.

{{gossip|quest=|<Spread the fertilizer underneath the plant.>}}
}}

Then interact with it again to either tell it a joke or recite a poem:

{{book|content=
The plant is watered and has been recently fertilized.

Maybe some more attention will help.

*{{gossip|quest=|<Tell a joke.>}}
*{{gossip|quest=|<Recite a poem.>}}
}}

;Joke
:{{text|say|<Name>|What's a nervous tree called? A sweaty palm!}}
:{{text|emote|The plant leans slightly to the left, then to the right. The movement seems unrelated to what you've said.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|Well said! Either someone found my compendium on plant puns...}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|Or you heard it through the grapevine!}}

;Poem
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Druids of fire and ash come...}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Before them they burn everything...}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Yet here we stand.}}

After completing the quest, the bar over the Dewy Sapling appears, and it has new gossip:
{{book|content=The plant is watered and has been recently fertilized.

Give it some time, and there may be more to do.}}
