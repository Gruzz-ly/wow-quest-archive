==Objectives==
Slay [[Primalists]], [[Djaradin]], and [[Druids of the Flame]].
*Slay [[Fyrakk]]'s forces (0/100%)
*Meet [[Merithra]] in the [[Fields of Reverie]].

==Description==
The Druids of the Flame are opening a way into the Dream for Fyrakk's forces. Every moment, more of them enter.

We must stop this rising tide before it becomes a flood.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Fyrakk's forces must be cut down before they can establish a hold on the Dream.

==Completion==
You fought well, though I fear there is no stopping these forces now. They may forever reshape the Dream.

==Notes==
After the [[adventurer]] accepts both this quest and [[The Face of Our Enemies]], Cenarius rushes to join in the fray.

Kill [[Invading Sparkhewer]]s (+6%), [[Invading Flameclaw]]s (+6%), [[Invading Earthshaker]]s (+6%), [[Invading Squallcaster]]s (+6%), [[Invading Flamespeaker]]s (+6%), [[Zaqali Spearhead]]s (+8%), and [[Invading Flametail]]s (+8%). Killing [[Stormbrand Ko'mal]] and [[Apostle Fenarelle]] also contributes toward the objective of this quest (+8%).

;Merithra's gossip
:There are too many portals. I cannot close them all.
