'''A Call to Aid''' begins an optional storyline in the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] and [[Lilian Voss|Lilian]] in the [[Lushdream Crags]].

==Description==
Ah, so you are <name>?

Hm, I suppose Lilian consorts with heroes of all sorts now...

Lilian sent me with a message. She and Shandris have been tasked with tracking a powerful Druid of the Flame.

He continues to elude them, but with your assistance, they believe they can corner him and his dryad conspirators.

Seek them out if you are able to aid them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>. Good.

We have cornered our quarry. Let me brief you on our mission.

==Notes==
Before leaving, Delaryn has gossip:

{{book|content=
In a different place and a different time, I would find this place profound... and beautiful.

But now I just feel nothing.

Even that has been taken from me.
}}

Head north to the [[Lushdream Crags]]:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I... apologize for the treatment you have been subjected to here in the Dream.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Heh. Don't worry, Shandris. I care very little what anyone thinks of me.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|When we speak to the Keepers next, I will remind them that you are helping us.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|It's fine, Shandris. I'm not exactly thin skinned. Or skinned much at all.}}

Shandris has gossip:
{{book|content=
There is much work to be done here. But with both you and Lilian here, I am confident we can finish our mission.
}}

As does Lilian:
{{book|content=
Why am I working with Shandris?

What are you, an Undercity guard?

Not all Forsaken agreed with Sylvanas's actions. We did not want Teldrassil to burn.

We're not the monsters many think we are, and it's time more people knew that. Maybe this will help.

For her part, Shandris has been patient and welcoming. I can't say the same of the Keepers.

{{A Call to Aid}}

==PTR version==
On the PTR the quest description was:

:Ah, so you are <name>?

:Hm, I suppose Lilian consorts with heroes of all sorts now...

:Lillian sent me to find you and give you a message. They have been stamping out the last embers of the [[Druids of the Flame]], but one [[druid]] in particular is eluding her: [[Raelas Firewind]]. Lilian and Shandris have finally cornered him, but would like your assistance in taking him and his [[dryad]]s down.

:It is Shandris who is at the head of this venture. Lilian asks you seek her out if you are able to aid them.

On PTR, this was the script event betwen Shandris and Lilian:
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|You carry the stones. I'm not going back to the [[Keeper of the grove|keepers]].}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You must. They are wrong about you, Lilian. I have seen what a good soldier you are.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Do not give them the satisfaction of knowing they upset you.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|I'm not upset. The keepers have their reasons. But I appreciate your faith in me, Shandris.}}
