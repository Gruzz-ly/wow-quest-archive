'''Merithra Says''' concludes the "Trouble at the Tree" optional side storyline of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Give instructions to 5 druids while disguised as Merithra.
*Get [[Merithra]] disguise from [[Lady Moonberry]]
*Orders given to [[druid]]s (5)

==Description==
Some druids are volunteering to help tend to [[Amirdrassil|the tree]] and set up [[Central Encampment|camp]].

But they're so sad!

<Lady Moonberry grows a mischievous grin.>

We have to give them a reason to smile. You can give them some orders that remind them to have fun.

But there's no way they'll take orders from you.

That's why I got this costume for you. With this and a little spell they'll for sure listen to you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* [[Moonberry's Many Mischief Makers]]
* [[Spare Party Hat]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]
* 5x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Progress==
You're clearly a master prankster but you'll have to be a master actor as well.

A costume and a spell can only do so much.

==Completion==
Your performance as Merithra was unmatched.

<Lady Moonberry bursts into laughter.>

I can hardly tell you two apart!

==Notes==
Speak with Lady Moonberry again:
:This place is just like [[Ysera]] described. Beautiful, but strange. It's magnificent!

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Get Merithra costume.>}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Moonberry|You look just like her! Or... you will to other people, at least.}}
:''The adventurer receives a 10-minute buff Very Authentic Merithra Costume.''

Speak with [[Malia Pierce]]:
:The Dream is more full of life than I thought.

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell the druid to start a dance party.>}}
:{{Text|say|Malia Pierce|A dance party? I'm not sure how that will help, but sounds like fun!}}
:''She joins the [[Dancing Druid]]s.''

Speak with [[Sian'Shim]]:
:Dey asked me if I'd help, I asked them why else I'd be here?

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell the druid to make cupcakes.>}}
:{{Text|say|Sian'Shim|If you believe it will help us here, I will bake these confections.}}

Speak with [[Dodon Silverwing]]:
:The worse part about all of this helping is that people keep coming up to talk to me.

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell the druid to collect luminescent redberries.>}}
:{{Text|say|Dodon Silverwing|Luminescent redberries are impossible to capture. But I will try.}}

Speak with [[Yonpak Ambercrest]]:
:Every time I think we've mapped the Dream, I find there is still much more to explore.

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Give the druid a list of instructions to read to others around camp.>}}
:{{Text|say|Yonpak Ambercrest|This is a list of corny jokes. If this is what you wish... it will be done.}}

Speak with [[Edith Morgan]]:
:How can I help?

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell the druid to make flower crowns so that all the volunteers can match.>}}
:{{Text|say|Edith Morgan|Flower crowns... What a thoughtful idea!}}

In case the disguise is not on:
*{{Text|say|Edith Morgan|How am I to trust you are here on behalf of the Dreamer?}}
*{{Text|say|Malia Pierce|I'm not sure the Dreamer wants us to do that right now.}}
*{{Text|say|Sian'Shim|Nice try, but you are not the Dreamer.}}
*{{Text|say|Yonpak Ambercrest|Perhaps we should double check with the Dreamer first.}}
*{{Text|say|Dodon Silverwing|I do not answer to you, <class>. Only to the Dreamer.}}

;Upon completion
:''Merithra walks up and stops short in front of Moonberry, arms crossed.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Oh, hi Merithra!}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|What is the meaning of this chaos, Lady Moonberry?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Just cheering people up with some harmless pranks!}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|I suppose... the druids do seem to be in brighter spirits now.}}
:''Merithra walks away.''

==PTR version==
;Description
:Some druids have volunteered to help tend to the tree and set up the camp!
:But... they're all so somber. Someone needs to do something to lighten the mood here! Give them some tasks that will help remind everyone to have some fun.
:But they won't take orders from you.
:Luckily, I brought this costume to make you look like the Dreamer! Otherwise, they probably won't take your instructions seriously.

;Progress
:Since you're clearly a master prankster, I'm sure no one will be able to tell the difference with you in costume!

;Completion
:Everyone seems to be in such better spirits now. See what some harmless pranks can achieve?
