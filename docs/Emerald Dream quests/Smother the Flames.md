==Objectives==
Help [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] and [[Lilian Voss|Lilian]] retrieve the spirit stones from the Sisters of Flame dryads.
*[[Wolf Spirit Stone]]
*[[Leaf Spirit Stone]]
*[[Bear Spirit Stone]]
*[[Moon Spirit Stone]]

==Description==
Lilian and I have been shadowing [[Raelas Firewind]] and have uncovered his plan. He has manipulated the [[Sisters of the Flame]] to bind spirits from [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] to magical spirit stones.

With Raelas's blessing, these stones became powerful tools of corruption, allowing these fallen dryads to twist the Dream and its denizens.

We will start our purge with the dryads--they have the stones. Then we will end Raelas.

The hunt begins, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|21|6|75}}
* 7,150 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Bring me all four spirit stones. We must keep them close so they do not fall into the wrong hands.

==Completion==
Good!

<Shandris stashes the spirit stones in a small, leather pouch.>

Now, let us put an end to Raelas's madness.

==Notes==
On accept, Shandris and Lilian join the party and will follow the player.

[[Sister Eydlin]] holds the [[Wolf Spirit Stone]]:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|These stones... I can feel the spirits in them. Powerful spirits.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|I'm sure that's why Raelas wants them. To amplify the dryads' power. And his.}}

[[Sister Fae'da]] holds the [[Bear Spirit Stone]]:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|This is going quickly with <name> here.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Yes. I will have time to return to [[Amirdrassil]] and take on another mission for [[Night elf|my people]].}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Well, aren't we the overachiever.}}

[[Sister Jodnar]] holds the [[Leaf Spirit Stone]]:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Why didn't you send someone else to do this? Seems below your pay grade.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|All missions in the Dream are of the utmost importance. I will not let another tree fall.}}

[[Sister Sylasta]] holds the [[Moon Spirit Stone]]:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|That was close. The power these dryads have. And the ferocity...}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I am disturbed by it also. It does not bode well for the Dream.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|We'll take them down, and we'll get the stones.}}
