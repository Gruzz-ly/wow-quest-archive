==Objectives==
Plant seeds in 8 [[Tilled Soil (Emerald Dream)|Tilled Soil]] and speak to Kiya Featherpaw. Then, speak with Somnikus.
* Noxious seeds planted (8)
* Speak to [[Kiya Featherpaw]] {{co|57.5|25.9|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* Speak to [[Somnikus]] {{co|57.0|23.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}}

==Description==
Our trap is many-layered.

Plant these seeds around town. Our gardeners have already prepared the soil. These plants will be effective tools to poisoning our enemy. Handle them carefully, for some may sprout sooner than later.

Also, Kiya Featherpaw, our [[umbraclaw]] keeper, has an idea to mobilize the very strong creatures. Go speak with her.

Finally, meet with Somnikus to give everyone the signal that battle is imminent.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Summer Soother's Bands]]
* [[Chartreuse Champion's Bracers]]
* [[Spirited Stag's Cuffs]]
* [[Fearless Faerie's Wristbands]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Our trap will work, I know it.

Make haste, <name>. Even with my mother's and my strength...It is like some part of her is holding back her attunement. I dare not dwell on it.

==Completion==
Now... we are ready.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Merithra|We shall do it, then. Everyone, go and finish the preparations.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|<Name> will send word when everything is ready. I shall hold the defenses steadfast here with my mother.}}
:''The three other dragons run out.''

Head out and interact with Tilled Soil in the quest area. Most of the time it will temporarily buff the player with bonus run speed, but occasionally a [[Noxious Seedling]] pops out. Fend it off and move on.

[[Kiya Featherpaw]] is at the eastern end of the quest area:

{{book|Kiya Featherpaw|content=
Hello. You must be Merithra's champion.

{{gossip|quest=|Merithra said you have a plan to help defeat the djaradin.}}

I will direct the umbraclaws to take strategic positions for the battle ahead.

Don't forget. Dinner time is the special phrase to activate the umbraclaw's aggression. They will charge and rip into the nearest foe.

The djaradin think us delicate and magic-forward. I'm eager to prove them wrong.

Go on then, <name>. I will proudly meet you in the battlefield.

:{{text|say|Kiya Featherpaw|This shall cast an illusion that they are just baby cubs.}}
:''Kiya casts Transforming on [[Tamed Umbraclaw]]s.''
:{{text|say|Kiya Featherpaw|When the djaradin come, they will appear as easy prey.}}
:{{text|say|Kiya Featherpaw|Then, to motivate the umbraclaw to fight the djaradin, just say dinner time!}}

Then find [[Somnikus]] at {{Co|56.96|23.26|Emerald Dream (zone)}}. He has rallied a force composed of [[General Shycura]], [[Galenori]], [[Kaldorei Defender (Emerald Dream)|Kaldorei Defenders]], [[Kaldorei Huntress (Emerald Dream)|Kaldorei Huntresses]], [[Elder Scaleguard (Emerald Dream)|Elder Scaleguards]], [[Emerald Preserver]]s, [[Keeper of the Grove (Emerald Dream)|Keepers of the Grove]], and [[Green Dragon (Emerald Dream)|Green Dragons]].

Speak with him:
{{book|Somnikus|content=
Thank you for helping us prepare the trap. I have great confidence in Merithra's plan.

I have rallied the Eye's guard and denizens. Upon your word, we will move into position and be ready to fight!

{{gossip|quest=|The traps are prepared. We are ready.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Somnikus|To arms, my brethren. For [[Amirdrassil]]!}}
:''Somnikus flies off.''
:{{text|say|General Shycura|For Amirdrassil!}}
:''The collected fighters all run off.''
:{{Text|say|Galenori|For Amirdrassil!}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper of the Grove|For Amirdrassil!}}
