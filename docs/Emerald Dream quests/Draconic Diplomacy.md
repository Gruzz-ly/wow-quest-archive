==Objectives==
Talk to Prince Mordenaku at the [[Petitioner's Concourse|Petitioners Concourse]] in Valdrakken.
*Locate [[Mordenaku]] in [[Valdrakken]]
*Talk to [[Wrathion]]
*Talk to Mordenaku

==Description==
I suspect [[Vyranoth]] might also be interested in recruiting new [[dragon]]s to our cause... but she'll need a little convincing. 

I just so happen to be very good at convincing.

I'll speak with Vyranoth, and we'll meet you in Valdrakken once she's decided to join us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
The [[netherwing]] are a fascinating [[Dragonflight|flight]].

==Completion==
These seem like very reasonable requests. Nothing obscure, nothing secretive. 

I'm almost disappointed.

I can handle one, but I may need your help with the rest.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Lady Vyranoth, <name> and I will be meeting potential new allies in the defense of [[Amirdrassil|the world tree]]. Would you care to join?}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|No.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I see. I thought perhaps you would be interested in meeting flights of dragons that were never part of [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]] and their broods. A thousand pardons.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Wait. I am listening.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Then let me tell you of the netherwing...}}

Head to the Petitioner's Concourse and find the dragons at {{co|33.7|62.1|Thaldraszus}}. Wrathion and Vyranoth are speaking to Mordenaku, with four [[Curious Netherwhelp]]s observing them.

:{{text|say|Mordenaku|While I appreciate your invitation, I suspect it was not delivered purely for altruistic reasons.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|You are correct, although I assure you that our outreach was intended as friendly first and foremost.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|But the Aspects would appreciate the aid of the netherwing in helping to protect the new world tree.}}
:{{text|say|Mordenaku|You wish my flight to endanger ourselves for a world not our own? A bold ask, stranger. What will you give in return?}}

;Vyranoth's gossip
:Hail, <class>.

;Mordenaku's gossip
:This city is incredible. [[Shattrath]] pales in comparison.

Speak with Wrathion:
:Thank you for joining me on this, <name>. While Vyranoth claims to be an ally, it... is good to have backup.

:Just in case.
:{{Gossip|quest=|What are you offering the Netherwing?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Well, we--}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|--if I may, Wrathion?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Of course.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Wrathion has told me of your [[Outland]]... a harsh place. Your flight would benefit from safer spaces. You are true dragons. [[Dragon Isles|This Isle]] is a home for every flight.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|The [[Valdrakken Accord]] accepted me, though I was an enemy. They will accept you. Your flight will flourish here.}}
:{{Text|emote|Wrathion smiles.}}
:{{Text|emote|Mordenaku furrows his brow in thought.}}

Speak with Mordenaku:
:Vyranoth is not wrong.

:You freed my flight, but Outland remains a harsh place. The freedom to simply live here and grow is tempting.

:Yet we have long lived away from bustling cities. Our current roost is rustic, but it is home.

:What options exist for my people to roost outside of [[Valdrakken]]?

:{{Gossip|quest=|The mountains of [[Thaldraszus]] would make excellent roosts.}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|A proper home for my flight, safety for our eggs, and wings outstretched in welcome.}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|These are what my flight desires.}}

==Progression==
{{Misfit Dragons}}

==PTR version==
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|<Name> has been telling me all about you, Prince Mordenaku{{sic}}}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|<Name> is here? I look forward to meeting them again!}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Ah! Your timing, as always, is impeccable, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|But the Aspects would appreciate the aid of the netherwing in helping to protect the new world tree.}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|Normally, my flight and I would do anything to help <name>. However, you want us to go to war.}}
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|If you want us to endanger ourselves, what will you give in return?}}
