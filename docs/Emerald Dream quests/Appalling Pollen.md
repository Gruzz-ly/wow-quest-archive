==Objectives==
Reveal and kill 10 Cinderpollen Beast.
*Use Q'onzu's Vision Charm (Optional)
*Cinderpollen Beasts revealed and slain (10)
*[[Q'onzu's Vision Charm]] (provided)

==Description==
This cinder pollen doesn't evoke interesting change. It consumes all until nothing, but ash remains. It brings... uniformity.

And I find that to be tragically stale.

I'm all for change, no matter the origin. But if THIS change stymies all future possibilities for further change, then it must be stopped.

If creatures of the dream have been infected by this pollen, then they must be extinguished. This is not a flame that can be allowed to grow.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Bringing about change to the dream through fire is a fascinating concept - life and fire can coexist!

<[[Q'onzu]]'s expression hardens as they shudder.>

But this change is not that.

==Completion==
Imagine the lengths these agents of monotony had to go to in order to get me -- ME, THE LOA OF CHANGE -- to interfere with their dream-changing plot?

The absolute gall!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|Tasting this flame pollen has given me a small glimpse into the terrible, unchanging state that awaits these creatures.}}
:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|Take this charm and use my vision to see which creatures have been afflicted. You know what to do next.}}

Use the charm, granting a 90-second true sight buff, then look for the revealed red-tinged [[Cinderpollen Beast]]s, which can take the form of [[Verdant Bristlebruin]]s, [[Verdant Dream Raven]]s, [[Verdant Gladehart]]s, [[Verdant Dreamsaber]]s in the [[Meandering Rootlands]].

On return:
:{{text|say|Q'onzu|Come now, Aviana! Is credit not due where credit is earned?}}
:{{text|say|Aviana|Your penchant for fascinated inaction has finally yielded fruit. Do try your best not to choke on it.}}
:{{text|say|Q'onzu|You wound me, oh Lady of the Birds. Do not mistaken my curiosity for change for meaningless inaction.}}
:{{text|emote|Aviana twitches and ruffles her wings in aggravation.}}
