'''Sleepy Druid in Emerald Dream''' concludes the "A Sleepy Search" optional side story in the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Sing a lullaby for sleepy [[druid]].
*Lullaby Sang to [[Thaalean]]
*Report back to [[Icarius]] in the [[Central Encampment]].

==Description==
Why can I still not fall asleep, even with a heated blanket?

<Thaalean curses the air then sighs.>

This is embarrassing to request, but my mother used to sing me a lullaby before I slept back in [[Teldrassil]], may I ask you to do the same?

Any lullaby will do, I just want to rest peacefully.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* [[Improvised Leafbed]]
* [[Spare Heated Hearthstone]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Please don't make me ask again, it was embarrassing enough the first time.

==Completion==
Thank you so much for checking on my friends.

When they reawake, we will be ready to fight [[Fyrakk]]'s forces once more.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Thaaelean lies down.''
:{{Text|emote|Thaalean yawns softly.}}

Speak with Thaalean:
{{book|content=
I wish I could fall asleep.

{{Gossip|quest=|<Sing a lullaby.>}}

<Thaalean lays on his heated blanket and closes his eyes. Perhaps it is time to sing.>

*{{Gossip|In [[Ysera]]'s embrace, the forest sways...}}
*{{Gossip|Whisper of leaves, a soft caress...}}
*{{Gossip|Hush little [[goblin]], don't say a peep...}}
*{{Gossip|Rock-a-bye [[blood elf]] on the treetops...}}

<Thaalean yawns and goes quiet. His big and burly chest puffs as his breathes{{sic}} get deeper.>

*{{Gossip|With ancient chants, we'll dream away...}}
*{{Gossip|As moonbeams dance, we sleep and bless...}}
*{{Gossip|Papa's gonna make you an explosive sheep...}}
*{{Gossip|When [[Al'Akir]] blows, the cradle will rock...}}

<Thaalean's muscles relax. His fingers loosen and face lightens.>

*{{Gossip|Through moonlit mists, calmness shall rise...}}
*{{Gossip|The world tree bows, the shelter keep...}}
*{{Gossip|And if that sheep fails to blast,}}
*{{Gossip|When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall...}}

<Thaalean's mouth moves ajar slightly. He ceases to move.>

*{{Gossip|Sleep now child, 'neath the starry skies.}}
*{{Gossip|Dream on little one, in nature's sleep.}}
*{{Gossip|You'll still be the sneakiest goblin in [[Gadgetzan]]!}}
*{{Gossip|And down will come baby, cradle and all.}}
}}

Once asleep, he has new gossip:
:<Thaalean snores in his slumber.>

As the lullaby is sung, the debuff Lullaby Enthusiast is applied, and [[Dream Pineshrew]]s appear. Once done, return to Icarius:
:{{Text|say|Icarius|Champion! Were you able to find them?}}
