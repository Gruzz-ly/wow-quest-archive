==Objectives==
Collect 6 Velvety Lasher Leaves from [[lasher]]s.
*[[Velvety Lasher Leaves]] (6)

==Description==
I am unable to rest! I have spent all my energy in battle, but there is too much noise and the ground is too hard for me to sleep...

I know! It pains me to ask this, but I need to rest so I can go back out and fight.

Could you feed two birds with one seed for me? Take out the enraged lashers and retrieve their leaves so I can make a blanket to rest on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
For the [[Emerald Dream]], it sure is quite chaotic here.

==Completion==
Thanks for the leaves. Hopefully this will help me fall asleep.

==Notes==
The leaves drop from [[Enraged Velveteen Lasher]]s and [[Enraged Velvet Lasher]]s.

==Progression==
{{A Sleepy Search}}
