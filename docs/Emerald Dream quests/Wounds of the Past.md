==Objectives==
Talk to Shandris and help her back to the camp.
*Speak to [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]]
*[[Anguished Dream Spirit|Spirit]] retreated

==Description==
It's all making sense now. I believe the missing dream spirit bonded with her--like [[Cyanthesa]] said.

It's making Shandris relive traumatic moments from her life.

It's not malicious, but the spirit and Shandris are feeding off each others' fears. We have to bring her back to the camp. [[Shae'lune]] might be able to help her.

Talk to her. I look like the enemy right now. But maybe she'll talk to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 7,600 [[XP]]
* 5x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Completion==
I thought that Shandris was venting her anger on me because I am [[Forsaken]].

I thought now that we had finished the task, she was done with me.

Wouldn't be the first time.

But I'm glad I was wrong. I have come to have... a great respect for her and her abilities.

We have to help her.

==Notes==
Speak with Shandris:

{{book|content=
Why is she here?

Why are you following me?

Do you not understand? Leave me here with my grief!

{{gossip|quest=|Come with us. We will explain back at camp.}}

And why would I go back to camp with you? Or with her?

I cannot bear to look at her now.

I relive what the undead have done to us over and over...

{{gossip|quest=|That is the dream spirit. Lilian believes it is making your relive memories.}}

:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|A dream spirit?}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Listen, we'll take you back to camp and Shae'lune will help you.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I do not... What is happening?}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|<Name>, wear out the dream spirit! I will attend Shandris.}}

An [[Anguished Dream Spirit]] appears and attacks. Defeat it, only for it to retreat back into Shandris:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|No, not again...}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|You'll be all right, Shandris. But we have to get you back to camp.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I need... a moment.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Take all the moments you need.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|I will stay with her. <Name>, meet us back at camp.}}

Shandris has new gossip:
:What is happening to me? Why me? Why here? I have to recollect my thoughts.

So dies Lilian:
:Shandris and I have seen our share of battles. But this is of a different kind.

:I think she'll pull through, but we need to get her to Shae'lune.

Return to the camp.
:{{Text|say|Shae'lune|It should be easier to reach the spirit now that Shandris is asleep.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|You can do it, Shandris. Fight it.}}

Shandris has new gossip:
:<Shandris is exhausted. She breaths slowly while whispering to herself in her sleep.>
