:''Shandris and Tyrande walk uphill from the moonwell.''
:{{text|bossemote|Shandris Feathermoon|Such beauty. Such tranquility. More [[kaldorei]] settle here every day.}}
:''Shandris pauses to look at her adoptive mother for a moment, before looking back out at Bel'ameth.''
:{{text|bossemote|Shandris Feathermoon|After so many years of strife, [[Bel'ameth]] offers rest and comfort.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande Whisperwind|This village welcomes all who wish to dwell here.}}
:''Tyrande looks at Shandris for a moment.''
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande Whisperwind|But it shall not be our only home.}}
:''They start walking again.''
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande Whisperwind|Hyjal, Val'sharah, Ashenvale... These are sacred places to us. We shall protect them forever more.}}
:''The stop at the moonwell again, facing one another.''
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande Whisperwind|And one day, when life blossoms again upon its ashen shores... we will return to Teldrassil and build anew.}}
:''Shandris smiles. Noticing something, she looks away from Tyrande and lets out a gasp. This catches Tyrande's attention, who turns around to look the same direction, letting out a gasp of her own and laughs gently. In the distance is [[Malfurion Stormrage]], back from [[Ardenweald]]. With a sigh of relief, Tyrande takes off running to her husband and he steps forward. With a leap, she jumps into his arms and they share a kiss, wrapping each other in a hug. They look into each others eyes for a beat, then close their eyes and hug tighter.''
:''A few moments later, Tyrande and Malfurion open their eyes and look at Shandris, who has stopped a few yards away, with her hands held together in front of her. Malfurion and Tyrande open their arms, beckoning Shandris, who obliges and moves in to share a three-way hug.''

:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|As I slumbered within [[Ardenweald]], [[Ysera]] let me dream through her eyes. I saw the courage you showed defending [[Amirdrassil]].}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|I am so proud of you both. And of all the heroes of [[Azeroth]] who joined together for this cause.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Though we will never forget the past, it is time to look forward.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Our people will be pleased to have both of you leading them into that future.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|No, my beloved daughter. I think we will tarry here in Bel'ameth a while.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I believe we have earned some time alone together.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|That we have, my love.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|But our people need--}}

:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|You have grown into a wise leader, Shandris. Within you beats the heart of the kaldorei people.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Trust your instincts. And if you have need of us, you know where we will be.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Thank you. For your faith in me. For... everything.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Now come. I want to show you a spot that would be perfect for our home.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|I do hope there is room for a garden...}}
