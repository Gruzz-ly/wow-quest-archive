'''Eye of Ysera''' begins the same-named chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]]. It unlocked the week of 14 November 2023, alongside [[Dragonflight Season 3]] and [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]].

==Objectives==
Take the portal from [[Amirdrassil]] into the Eye of Ysera.
* Take the portal into the [[Eye of Ysera]]

==Description==
Galenori's report is deeply troubling.

The Eye's temple is my seat of power here in [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]]. From it, I commune with the Eye's energies and monitor the health of the Dream and its denizens. The Eye's power flows throughout the Dream, and helps Amirdrassil grow.

If the [[djaradin]] take control of it, they could pervert its nature and stunt the growth of the tree.

My daughter knows the Eye's importance. I will follow her lead--and so should you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So, this is [[Igira]]'s new [[General (rank)|general]]? I am not impressed. We will prevail over this monster.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|[[Galenori]]|[[Ysera]]! [[Merithra]]! I have grave news to report.}}
:{{text|say|Galenori|A new djaradin general and his forces area laying siege to the Eye of Ysera!}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|The Eye of Ysera must not fall to fire. Merithra...}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|If the Eye has been breached, our enemies are stronger than we anticipated.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Do not worry, Mother. We will go there at once to defend it.}}

Before accepting, [[Lord Itharius]] has gossip:
:I am here to serve Merithra and our flight.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Merithra|We must confront this general immediately. Somnikus, can you make a portal to the Eye?}}
:{{text|say|[[Somnikus]]|Of course. This will take us to its heart.}}
:''Somnikus summons a Portal to Eye of Ysera.''
:{{text|say|Merithra|Lord Itharius, do you know of any allies who can come to our aid, quickly?}}
:{{text|say|[[Lord Itharius]]|Yes. I will go at once, Merithra.}}
:''Itharius runs a few yards away, shifts to dragon form, and flies off.''
:{{text|say|[[Gerithus]]|Mother, I am fully recovered. Let me join you--}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Good. I need you. With me, then!}}
:''Gerithus and Merithra run through the portal.''

Somnikus has gossip:
{{book|content=
Hurry, champion. This portal will take you into the Eye of Ysera, which under siege.

I will come as soon as I can.
}}

Head through the portal to spot Merithra facing down [[Galok Wingslicer]], who has summoned a fiery orb of shadowflame:
:{{text|say|Galok Wingslicer|At last! Merithra, daughter of the fallen Dreamer.}}
:{{text|say|Galok Wingslicer|Your dream is death, and your tree will be ash!}}

Gerithus is also channeling into the orb:

{{book|content=
<Gerithus is laser focused on the fiery orb.>

I will not fail. Fyrakk may have beat me once...

<Gerithus roars.>

I will not fail!
}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Galok Wingslicer|Surrender now for a quick death! It's more than you deserve.}}
