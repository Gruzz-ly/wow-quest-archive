==Objectives==
Weaken 8 podlings, then use Q'onzu's Faerie Feather to change them into [[Faerie dragon|Faerie Dragons]].
*Weakened spriglings transformed (8)
*[[Q'onzu's Faerie Feather]] (provided)

==Description==
Truly your questions are important to me. Alas, I am simply too distracted.

These [[podling]]s--nasty little ones. I'm sure you've seen them. They're encroaching upon my nest and just a total nuisance.

Bothering myself and my friends? The nerve! Here's my feather. Why don't you go change these nuisances into something less bothersome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
I can still hear the annoying sounds of those podlings. It's torture.

==Completion==
You again? You did what? Oh, yes. That's fine.

==Notes==
Use the feather on [[Invasive Podling]]s when below 50%.

==Progression==
