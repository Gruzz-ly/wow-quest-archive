==Objectives==
Collect 8 Scraps of Parchment from [[Fyrakk]]'s forces at [[Skystone Falls]].
* [[Scrap of Parchment]] (8)

==Description==
It is only a matter of time before Fyrakk's forces decimate our own. And then there will be nothing stopping him from entering the [[Wellspring Temple]].

If the [[Ashendir Hartwood|Prophet of the Flame]] is responsible for blocking our reinforcements from entering [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]], there must be some record or communication of his plan. We just have to find it.

Search for any communications amongst Fyrakk's forces at Skystone Falls. If we can disrupt their efforts in some way, we might have a chance to turn the tide.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
If Fyrakk enters the Wellspring Temple, it is not just [[Amirdrassil]] that will burn. All of [[Azeroth]] will burn with it.

==Completion==
Let us hope some knowledge can be gained from the communications you collected.

<Alexstrasza pores over the notes you handed her. Her expression slowly changes from grim to hopeful.>

You might have just saved us all, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|[[Merithra]]|We must discover why [[Khadgar]] and our allies cannot reach us. I will seek out the Prophet.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Make haste, Merithra. Our forces will not last much longer.}}
:''Merithra flies off.''

Defeat djaradin and Primalist units for their [[Scrap of Parchment]], but don't focus on killing them until after freeing the four ancients first. The hostiles guarding the ancients should drop enough parchment scraps.

On return:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I cannot stand by any longer. I must join this fight.}}
:''The death toll has grown significantly as many corpses of sentinels and druids litter the camp.''

Alexstrasza has new gossip:

{{book|content=
A desperate battle, a never ending war. And once more we fight together.

I had hoped that Amirdrassil would herald an age of peace. Yet here we are, shedding blood once more. Will it never end?
