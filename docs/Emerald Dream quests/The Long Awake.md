==Objectives==
Return to Merithra in the [[Chamber of Heart]] with the [[:Dreamglow Dragonscale]].
* Speak to [[Merithra]] to leave the [[Emerald Dream]]

==Description==
There is nothing more you can do for us here, champion. You have the power you sought, and the Emerald Dream is fighting back against the [[Void]].

Bring this dragonscale back to [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]] and the others. I will meet you in the Chamber of Heart to help infuse it into the [[:Heart of Azeroth]].

As for [[Green dragonflight|my flight]], our long vigil must continue... or we will be lost to the Void.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This place is incredible, and I am proud to stand with the other dragonflights in defense of [[Azeroth]]. Let us hope that this essence will turn the tide in our favor.
