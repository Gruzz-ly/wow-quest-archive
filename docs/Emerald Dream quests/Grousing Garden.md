==Objectives==
Tire out 8 wildlife in the [[Root-Bound Sanctuary]].
*Wildlife tired out (8)

==Description==
The sanctuary has been overrun!

The roots of [[Amirdrassil|the World Tree]] have grown alongside this garden, but it seems the wildlife have grown uncomfortable with the change.

Please help them get out their restless energy. Perhaps tired out, they will relax in this space again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
<Ethidris winces and rubs his shoulder.>

You would think being a bear would lend oneself resistance to being knocked around by deer.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I can see you've calmed them down for now.

This is not the first time this has happened, and likely will not be the last. Is it simply the roots of Amirdrassil? This behavior is so strange...

==Notes==
Click on [[Fidgety Gladefawn]] and defeat [[Distressed Gladehind]]s, [[Irate Gladehart]]s, and [[Agitated Bristlebruin]]s.

==Progression==
{{The Dryad Garden}}
