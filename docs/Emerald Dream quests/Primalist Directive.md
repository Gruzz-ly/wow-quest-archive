==Objectives==
Convince 5 of [[Terro]]'s Primalists to side with [[Vyranoth]].
* Primalists swayed (5)

==Description==
Terro was another one of Vyranoth's claws. He never wanted to attack the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]], and some of the [[Primalists]] who served him may feel the same. See if you can convince them to join our side. 

I can put a mark of Vyranoth on you so Terro's troops will not attack you... right away.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Terro never wanted to attack the Dream. It was against his nature.

==Completion==
Terro was always protective of those he commanded. He would have wanted us to save who we can.

==Notes==
After picking up this quest, Vyranoth pops [[Finding Terro]]. Pick it up before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Buri, what did [[Fyrakk]] say of his plan?}}
:{{text|say|Buri|He separated any of us he feared would be loyal to you early on.}}
:{{text|say|Buri|Fyrakk is fixated on the [[Wellspring of Life]], that is all I learned.}}
:{{text|say|Buri|Terro was with Fyrakk in a cave to the west not long ago.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Thank you, my friend.}}
:''Buri flies off, and Vyranoth runs a short distance, then sheds her visage and flies away as well.''

Enter the [[Scorching Chasm]]:
:{{Text|say|Buri|I will wait here.}}

While in the area, all the [[Dreambreaker Ashblade]], [[Dreambreaker Cragfist|Cragfist]], [[Dreambreaker Flametongue|Flametongue]], and [[Dreambreaker Stonewarden|Stonewarden]] units in the area are friendly. Interact with them. Swayable units will walk away:
*{{text|say|If Fyrakk turns the world to fire, where am I supposed to live?}}
*{{text|say|I'm loyal to Terro. And Terro was loyal to Vyranoth.}}
*{{text|say|Terro wanted us to stand with Vyranoth.}}
*{{Text|say|Harming the Dream was a step too far.}}

Units who won't be swayed will turn hostile and attack, also turning any nearby units hostile:
*{{text|say|If we don't follow through now, everything up to this point will be in vain.}}
*{{text|say|Fyrakk will prevail!}}
*{{text|say|I'd rather die than side with the titans!}}
*{{text|say|Fyrakk won't rest until the Wellspring burns! Why try to resist?}}
*{{Text|say|You're nothing compared to the power of the elements!}}
*{{Text|say|Vyranoth has a lot of nerve preaching to us about loyalty.}}
*{{Text|say|Vyranoth talks too much about how things SHOULD be done. Fyrakk just does it!}}

The name of this quest is a reference to the {{wplink|Prime Directive}} of ''{{wplink|Star Trek}}''.

{{Ice and Fire}}
