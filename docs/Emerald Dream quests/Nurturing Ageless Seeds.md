==Objectives==
Nurture each of the seed we planted with Ageless Dewdrops.
*[[Ageless Dewdrops]] collected from [[Encroaching Lashling]]s (15)
*Small [[Ageless Dreamseed Bloom|Ageless Bloom]] nurtured (5)
*Plump Ageless Bloom nurtured (5)
*Gigantic Ageless Bloom nurtured (5)

==Description==
The growth of these seeds is a delicate balance, requiring constant nurturing.

I've found that Ageless Dewdrops, gathered from around this area, hold a special energy that can awaken the dormant potential within these seeds.

If you could collect some dewdrops and apply them to the plants, we can unlock their full potential.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you given the Ageless Dewdrops to the blossoming seeds?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Your willingness to aid in the nurturing of these ancient seeds warms my heart.

==Notes==
Defeat [[Encroaching Lashling]]s and loot [[Ageless Dewdrops]].

Interact with the [[Ageless Dreamseed Bloom]]s and contribute the dewdrops. Despite the item having been changed, the interface will still refer to them as [[Emerald Dewdrop]].

During the PTR, the quest instead asked for 150 [[Emerald Dewdrop]], which could be pulled from [[Encroaching Growth]]s.
