'''Memory of the Dreamer''' begins an optional storyline in the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Rest at the [[Eye of Ysera]].
* Rest at the Eye of Ysera

==Description==
In [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]], memories can live on in unusual ways. Memories are not always linear. And memories that are not of your own can become yours.

Perhaps you were drawn to this place by the presence of the once-Dreamer. Or perhaps you were drawn to this place because of my great friend. Come, won't you see?

Rest here and let the magic of the Dream wash over you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good that you are here, <name>. Perhaps you can lend your assistance?

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Adranas runs a few yards away and summons in a [[Comfy Pillow]] leaf bed.''
:{{text|say|Keeper Adranas|You may rest here, Champion.}}

Interact with it to fall asleep. Across a brief fade-to-black, the player wakes up:
:{{text|say|Ysera|It is not working, sister. Something is not right.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|There is still one thing left to try. Over here, champion!}}

[[Ysera]] and [[Alexstrasza]] are channeling into [[Gracus]].

Ysera has gossip:
:Thank you for aiding us, <name>.

:{{Gossip|<Ask Ysera how she is still here.>}}
::What you see is what has already been.

::A piece of the Dream will always be in me, and I in the Dream. Even when I am no longer truly there.
