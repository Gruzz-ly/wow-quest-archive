==Objectives==
Plant 6 flowers around [[Gracus]].
* Sprouts planted (6)
* Talk to Gracus

==Description==
As one life ends so too will a life begin.

We must remind those that love Gracus of this, <name>.

Plant seeds around Gracus. [[Alexstrasza|My sister]] can handle the rest.

This place will not only represent an end but also a beginning of new life.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* [[Sprout of Rebirth]]
* 5x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Progress==
These flowers will bloom around Gracus and serve as a reminder of all he helped to grow during his life.

==Completion==
Those memories... Gracus suffers. We should aid him.

==Notes==
Six plots of [[Tilled Earth]] appear around Gracus. Interact with them:
:{{text|say|[[Sprucecrown]]|My friend... thank you.}}
:{{text|say|[[Kaz'arin]]|Look at the impact you have had, my friend! A life well lived.}}
:{{text|say|[[Firequackers]]|<Sad quacks.>}}
:{{text|say|[[Keeper Adranas]]|Your memory will live on forever, old friend.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alfie Turner]]|You opened my eyes to what it means to protect nature, Gracus.}}
:{{text|say|[[Talathar Brightsong]]|The Dream will remember you fondly. As will I.}}

After the sixth, Gracus also speaks up:
:{{text|say|Gracus|Champion, if I might have a word.}}

{{book|content=
Ah... young <name>.

My life comes to its end. Do not feel sorry. 

Do not fret. I am ready.

{{gossip|<Ask Gracus what ails him.>}}

That is an answer I cannot give. I know I have lived a long life. 

I know that my life has had meaning. 

And I know that this is as far as it is meant to come. This is the end.

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask Gracus how you can help.>}}
}}
:''A number of [[Haunting Memory|Haunting Memories]] pour out of Gracus for a moment before fading.''
:{{text|say|Gracus|One battle still haunts me. We were victorious, but I cannot shake the terror of that day.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|A nightmare? Perhaps you still have fears that need closure, my friend.}}
