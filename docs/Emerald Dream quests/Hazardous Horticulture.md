==Objectives==
Plant 6 Dream Seeds across [[Wildfire Canyon]].
* Dream Seeds [[Dream Seed Dirt Pile|planted]] (6)

==Description==
We may be outnumbered, but this is my domain. And I have a way of evening our odds.

Take this pouch of seeds. Plant them throughout Wildfire Canyon and [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]]'s [[faerie dragon]]s will transform them into [[treant]]s.

With luck, they will draw attention from our front lines and bolster our ground forces.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Hopefully the faerie dragons are small enough to go unnoticed by Fyrakk's forces.

==Completion==
I did not expect the [[Ashendir Hartwood|Prophet of the Flame]] to join the fray himself. We may have less time than I thought.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|[[Alexstrasza]] the Life-Binder|Vyranoth and I will engage [[Fyrakk]].}}
:{{text|say|[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]|He burns for retribution. Fyrakk will stop at nothing to kill you himself.}}
:{{text|say|[[Merithra]]|We need you here, Life-Binder. There will likely be heavy casualties.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Very well. I will stay for now.}}

Plant seeds. Three [[Emerald Gardener]]s approach and grow a [[Rapidly Grown Treant]]. Sometimes, Ashendir will fly by and burn them:
*{{Text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|Immortality will be ours. Forged in fire!}}
*{{text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|Druids of the Flame! Incinerate that pest!}}
*{{text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|Such impudence cannot stand!}}
*{{text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|Fyrakk shall reign over [[Azeroth]]!}}
*{{text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|Let the world be reborn in flame!}}

Throughout the questing, Fyrakk also comes down and obliterates his enemies:
*{{Text|say|Fyrakk|Your army is pathetic, Dragon Queen!}}
*{{text|say|Fyrakk|Where are your reinforcements, Alexstrasza?}}
*{{text|say|Fyrakk|What hope have you against my wrath?}}
*{{Text|say|Fyrakk|I shall claim the tree. I shall claim Azeroth!}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Merithra|Cutting off our reinforcements seems too calculating for Fyrakk.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|But not for Ashendir. The Prophet of the Flame must be the one behind it all.}}

==Progression==
{{A Dream of Fields and Fire}}
