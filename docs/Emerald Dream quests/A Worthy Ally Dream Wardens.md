I have no doubt the Dream will share it's{{sic}} plenty with you in return.

You will receive:
*[[Satchel of Dreams]]
*[[Dream Wardens Commendation]] (+500)

Do take some time to stop and smell all that blooms throughout the Dream. It will enrich your life.

The air has gone calm. Peace returns to the Dream, even if slowly.

All who keep and defend this place thank you, hero.
