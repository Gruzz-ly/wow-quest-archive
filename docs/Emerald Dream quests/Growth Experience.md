==Objectives==
Have Dionaessa grow 3{{sic}} flowers in the [[Twisting Wood]].
*Instruct [[Dionaessa]] to follow (Optional)
*[[Prepared Soil|Flowers grown]] (5)
*Speak with Dionaessa.

==Description==
Dionaessa's connection to [[Cenarius]] gives her the ability to grow plants, but she needs space to practice.

The stirred-up wildlife here will be in your way. The Twisting Wood nearby will have plenty of space with far fewer hooves.

<Melyrine smiles. Her eyes shine with intensity.>

If she gets poisoned by a [[podling]], don't worry. [[Dryad]]s are immune to poison. You are not.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*3x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Progress==
Do you smell that?

<Dionaessa scrunches up her face.>

The [[druid]] [[Ethidris Creekward|Creekward]] did not describe [[lasher]]s and podlings as smelling so foul. I have been mislead!{{sic}}

==Completion==
Guardian. If the podlings are poisoning the ground here, then that large growth with the incredible stench over there needs pruning!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Dionaessa|I will study your every move, Guardian! Hey-ah!}}

Melyrine has new gossip:
{{book|content=
We caretakers of this grove will have many tasks for you, mage. Should you survive.

<Melyrine tilts her head and smiles.>

{{gossip|What exactly is a dryad?}}

We are the descendants of Cenarius. We share his connection to nature and the Dream.

We watch over gardens like this and ensure life persists. By any means necessary.

{{gossip|Are you a plant or a mammal?}}

We are dryads. We are not centaur, if that's what you're wondering.

Do you need a task? I can give you a task. We have plenty of spears that need sharpening.
