==Objectives==
Collect 8 Silky Sage.
*[[Silky Sage]] (8)

==Description==
There is no way I could rest without something soft to sleep on. Luckily, [[Emerald Dream (zone)|the dream]] has some sage so plush, that it would even put [[roc]] feathers to shame! It would be a perfect filling!

Could you collect some sage around the area for me to rest on?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
The sage should be soft enough to make a comfortable place to sleep. Thank you for your assistance.

==Completion==
Thanks for bringing back the bed filling.

==Notes==
Loot the sages from [[Voluptuous Vines]].

==Progression==
