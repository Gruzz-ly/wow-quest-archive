'''A Multi-Front Battle''' concludes the first chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]], Enter the Dream. The second chapter, Druids of the Flame, starts immediately with [[The Burning Barrow]].

==Objectives==
Meet Saelienne, Keeper Amrymn and Vaskarn in the [[Central Encampment]].
*[[Saelienne]] found
*[[Keeper Amrymn]] found
*[[Vaskarn]] found

==Description==
The [[kaldorei]] have set up a temporary base beneath the boughs of [[Amirdrassil]].

With hope and hard work, this encampment will become permanent when the tree enters [[Azeroth|our world]].

Feel free to acquaint yourself with the provisions available. Then return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*[[Plump Dreamseed]]
*[[Mysterious Seeds (item)]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Have you found what you needed here in camp?

==Completion==
[[Tyrande]] has gone to investigate the [[Druids of the Flame]], learn more about their purpose in the [[Emerald Dream]], and identify their leaders.

How could night elves and Dream denizens turn to the flame?

I am confident that you and Tyrande can find the answer.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Vyranoth]]|[[Fyrakk]] will return. He cannot control himself for long, not even with guidance.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]]|[[Merithra]], this is your [[Plane|realm]]. Where shall we send our [[Dragonflight|flights]] and our people to aid you?}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|We must know what our enemies seek in the Dream. There are other places of power, such as the [[Wellspring Temple]] and the [[Eye of Ysera]].}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|And the Druids of the Flame have opened the way for them all. I must know why they are here.}}
:''Tyrande heads off.''
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Then we will begin there. Tyrande, seek them out and uncover their aims. Vyranoth, let us speak of the [[Primalists]].}}

[[Vaskarn]] is to the southwest near [[Cuzolth]] and [[Cylania]]:

{{book|content=
Look at this place! There is so much to explore and take in. If my bet is correct--and it usually is--we could use Flightstones with Crests from around the Dream to upgrade the adventuring gear you find here! The possibilities, if not the sheer power alone, should be more than rewarding.

Now, how can I help you?

{{gossip|How do I acquire Flightstones and Dreaming Crests?}}

Flightstones are located all over the Dragon Isles. They can be obtained by opening outdoor treasures, completing world quests, and by participating in weekly events, dungeons, and raids.

Dreaming Crests can be acquired in similar fashion. There are four tiers of crests. The more dangerous the adventure you overcome, the more powerful the crests you will find.

{{gossip|Tell me about upgrading gear using Flightstones and Dreaming Crests.}}

Most upgrades will require a varied amount of Flightstones.

Upgrading gear labeled as Adventurer, Veteran, Champion, Hero, or Myth usually requires the addition of Dreaming Crests. You will need fifteen Crests of the appropriate power level for each upgrade. Cuzolth will let you know which kind of Crest you need for each upgrade.

If you bring us a piece of equipment less powerful than your equipped gear, it will be cheaper to upgrade and won't require any crests. In this way, we can lean on your own existing power to improve less-powerful gear when possible.

If not already done, complete [[It Starts With a Stone]] and [[Dreaming of Crests]] to be (re)introduced to [[Flightstones]] and crests.

Immediately to the north is [[Lady Moonberry]], who starts [[Dreams Unified]], and [[Talisa Whisperbloom]], starting [[Blooming Dreamseeds]], both weekly quests.

Further north is [[Saelienne]], the innkeeper:

{{book|content=Your body looks worn and your spirit weary. Rest yourself beneath these branches and dream of a better future for all.}}

Outside the tent to the northeast is [[Keeper Amrymn]], the Keeper of Renown for the [[Dream Wardens]], who starts [[A Worthy Ally: Dream Wardens]], the weekly wrapper quest.

Completing this quest is the "Enter the Dream" criterion of [[Defenders of the Dream (achievement)]].
