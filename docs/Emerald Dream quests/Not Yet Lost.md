==Objectives==
Rescue the denizens of the [[Sor'theril Barrow Den]].
*Burning Barrow assisted (0/100%)

==Description==
The flame did not take root here on a whim.

No doubt there are servants of the [[Firelands]] cloistered within, trying to spread their flame to the creatures that reside within these barrows. We must do what we can to save those who can still be saved, and mete out swift justice to the [[heretic]]s that lurk within.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

{{Itembox||Chartreuse Champion's Cloak|Spirited Stag's Cape|Summer Soother's Wrap|Fearless Faerie's Shroud}}

You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
If even one soul remains languishing within these dens, we must do everything we can to save them.

==Completion==
Not a day goes by where I do not mark the memories of those that fell at [[Teldrassil]], consumed by a fire that I could not quell.

Be they [[Kaldorei]] or [[Dryad]], I will never again let the cries of the anguished go unanswered. Not while I still draw breath.

==Notes==
When accepting both this quest and [[Ashen Soil]] before entering the [[Sor'theril Barrow Den]]:
:{{Text|say|[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]|The Druids of the Flame may be traitors to the Dream, but they still possess the requisite knowledge to cross into it. No doubt that is why [[Fyrakk]] has made allies of them.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I will remain here and tend to any wounded that you send me. The safety of the barrow's denizens must come first.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Take care, <name>. These fanatics are as dangerous and unpredictable as the flames they seek to spread.}}

Fill the bar by killing [[Flame-Warped Sister]]s (5%), [[Emberbloom]]s (10%), [[Smoldering Hierophant]]s (7%), and saving [[Harried Dryad]]s (10%).

Tyrande can be seen talking to [[Andi'thur]] near the barrow den entrance if objectives of the two quests mentioned are all achieved:
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|You have my thanks, Andi'thur. Worry not. We will track them down.}}

She also has new gossip:
{{book|content=
Norana Morninglight... She was an initiate at the [[Temple of the Moon]] in [[Darnassus]], in the years following the birth of Teldrassil.

She was always such a kind, quiet soul. I thought her dead. Instead, she now walks amongst the Druids of the Flame.

<Tyrande sighs.>
