[[File:Some Water.jpg|thumb|A Dreamtalon, a Dreamtalon Kit, and the Smoldering Sprout]]

'''Some Water...''' begins the optional "A Mix of Hope, Care, and Patience" side storyline of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]], unlocked the week of 14 November 2023. This storyline eventually rewards the [[Reins of the Ochre Dreamtalon]] mount.

==Objectives==
Nurse the plant back to health.
* Consult with [[Professor Ash|an expert]] in the [[Central Encampment]] {{co|49.6|62.8|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* Pick up the bucket
* Fill the bucket {{co|51.1|65.7|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* Water the plant
* Speak to the plant

==Description==
<The plant is clear of soot and flame, but its leaves are limp with thirst. Perhaps someone from Central Encampment will know the perfect remedy.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
<The plant's leaves are fringed in brown and brittle along the edges.>

==Completion==
<The plant seems partially revitalized, and its leaves dip briefly towards you, as if in thanks.>

==Notes==
The Smoldering Sprout does not have a quest bang over it's head to start out, but nearby are a [[Dreamtalon Kit]]:
:<The infant dreamtalon ignores you as it attempts to find sustenance on the charred fly corpse. It is unsuccessful so far.>

And an adult [[Dreamtalon]]:
:<The adult dreamtalon eyes you with equal parts wariness and curiosity.>

Interact with the sprout:
{{book|content=
The nearby ground is littered with flame-scorched insect bodies.

The plant bulb in the center of the clearing is smoldering, yet clings on to life. But surely not for long.

{{gossip|<Put out the flames.>}}
}}

This puts out the fires, so now it's a Blackened Sprout. Interact with it again:

{{book|content=
<No longer burning, the plant is still covered in soot.>

{{gossip|<Clean the plant.>}}
}}

This turns the plant into a Sprout, which finally starts this quest. Head to the [[Central Encampment]] and speak with [[Professor Ash]], the [[herbalism]] trainer in [[Treant Form]]:

{{book|content=
Hello, <name>. How can I be of service?

{{gossip|quest=|Professor, what do you recommend for a plant suffering from burns and severe dehydration?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|The waters surrounding Amirdrassil have unique restorative properties. Feel free to use my bucket on the side here.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Ash|Oh, and a little attention goes a long way. Try talking to it!}}

Pick up the [[Empty Gardening Bucket]] next to Ash, fill the [[Unfilled Bucket]] in the center of the formation under Amirdrassil, then use the [[Filled Bucket]] on the Sprout:

{{book|content=
The plant quivers slightly in anticipation of your return. Its leaves droop from thirst.

{{gossip|quest=|<Water the plant with the moonwell water.>}}
}}

Speak with the plant again:

{{book|content=
The plant is looking green and dewy from the potent water you've provided.

Perhaps a moment of undivided attention will help?

*{{gossip|quest=|<Tell a joke.>}}
*{{gossip|quest=|<Recite a poem.>}}
}}

Jokes:
*What do you call a cheerleading herb? An encourage-mint!
*What did the big plant say to the little plant? What's up bud?
*What plant should you watch out for? An amBUSH!
*What new plant did the gardener sow? Beets me!
:''The player does their /laugh emote.''

Poems:
*The sun warms the top of your leaves... The soil feeds the depths of your roots... Your flower feeds the bellies of the bees.
*A calming afternoon... A breath of cold air... A dream within a dream.

Responses:
*{{text|emote|The plant remains silent, swaying slightly with the breeze.}}
*{{text|emote|The plant leans slightly to the left, then to the right. The movement seems unrelated to what you've said.}}
*{{text|emote|The plant's leaves quiver almost imperceptibly, perhaps in amusement.}}

After completing the quest, a bar appears above the plant's head, showing the Plant Phase Growth. It also has new gossip:

{{book|content=
The plant is looking green and dewy from the potent water you've provided.

Perhaps in the near future you can help it further.
