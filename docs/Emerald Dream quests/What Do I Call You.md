'''What Do I Call You?''' concludes the optional Dryad Garden storyline of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].
==Objectives==
Speak with Dionaessa to choose a title in the [[Root-Bound Sanctuary]].
*Speak with [[Dionaessa]] to choose a title

==Description==
Guardian! Or... teacher! Parent?

I want you to tell me what to call you. The other [[dryad]]s will ask me who my [[druid]] is now that I am working in the garden on my own.

I want to tell them that I do not have a druid. I have you!

Tell me what title you prefer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*[[Crown of the Dryad Daughter]]

==Progress==
I have heard so many titles from the druid [[Ethidris Creekward|Creekward]]. I am certain we can come up with something far more interesting.

==Completion==
What an excellent title! I will use it as often as I can.

Thank you.

==Notes==
Speak with Dionaessa again:
:What should I call you?
