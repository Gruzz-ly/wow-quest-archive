==Objectives==
Acquire 15 Whelpling's Dreaming Crests by defeating unique creatures, conquering [[dungeon]]s and [[raid]]s, completing world activities, or by looting caches. Then speak to [[Vaskarn]].
*[[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Description==
Now that you've learned the fundamentals, you can easily upgrade lower-level gear.

Sooner than later, though, you will find better gear that requires various types of Dreaming Crests to upgrade. Much like [[:Flightstones]], these Crests are rewarded through many different activities. Dreaming Crests have four tiers, and more dangerous tasks reward you with higher-tier crests.

Go and help with tasks, down formidable foes, find treasures, and bring me a few handfuls of Whelpling's Dreaming Crests!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*[[Emerald Flightstone]]
*[[Pouch of Whelpling's Dreaming Crests]]

==Progress==
I foresee great results with these Dreaming Crests.

==Completion==
Yes, yes! These crests hold magnificent power. And now so will you.

==Notes==
Much like in [[Dragonflight Season 2]], complete activities to acquire the lowest tier of crests, including defeating rare enemies, conquering dungeons and raids or world events like the [[Superbloom]].

==Progression==
{{Enter the Dream}}
