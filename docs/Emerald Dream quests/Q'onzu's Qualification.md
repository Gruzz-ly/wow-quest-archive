==Objectives==
Answer Q'onzu's 100 questions.
*[[Q'onzu]]'s 100 questions answered (0/100%)

==Description==
You seek an audience with Q'onzu but bring no offerings?

One does not just walk up and speak to the [[loa]] of Change, I'm afraid. You must first prove you are worth their time.

The friends of Q'onzu have been granted one hundred questions by the loa themself! You must prove your wit and answer each of them true.

Return to me if you answer all one hundred. Then perhaps you'll earn an audience.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* [[Bag of Many Wonders]]

==Completion==
You were actually going to answer a hundred questions? I just assumed that would make you go away.

Next time, I'll raise it to a thousand questions.

==Notes==
Upon accept, 50 Dreamkin jump down.
