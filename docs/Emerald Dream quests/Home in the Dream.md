'''Home in the Dream''' unlocks outdoor activities in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]], including [[World Quest]]s and the [[Superbloom]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Merithra]] at the [[Central Encampment|central encampment]] beneath [[Amirdrassil]].

==Description==
[[Fyrakk]] has withdrawn from Amirdrassil, but that only increases my concern. He must have another target within the [[Emerald Dream]].

We must convene with the others at the base of the tree. [[Tyrande]] and the [[Night elf|kaldorei]] have established a camp. 

I need to speak with [[Alexstrasza]] to determine our next step.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*[[Dream Wardens Commendation]] (+2,500)

==Completion==
Now that we have a moment to breathe, we can begin to think about what we will do next.

And I know that we are stronger with you on our side.

==Notes==

At the [[Central Encampment]], Merithra, Alexstrasza, Tyrande, [[Vyranoth]], and [[Wrathion]] are having a conversation.

Completing this quest also unlocks access to [[A Worthy Ally: Dream Wardens]], [[Blooming Dreamseeds]], and [[Dreams Unified]].
