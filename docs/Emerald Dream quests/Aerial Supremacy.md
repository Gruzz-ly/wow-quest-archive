==Objectives==
Slay 15 enemy proto-drakes flying above the [[Field of Flames]] by striking them with your [[dragonriding]] mount.
* Summon your Dragonriding Mount or mount Green Dragon (Optional)
* Proto-Drake struck (15)
*Meet [[Merithra]] at [[Wellspring Overlook]].

==Description==
The [[dragonflight]]s have arrived. The skies are ours to reclaim! And you shall help us tip the scales.

Mount your drake and target the enemies above. You need only swoop in and take their forces by surprise. Your drake shall handle the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18|}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
The faster we can take down Fyrakk's aerial forces, the faster we can make our way to the temple and put a stop to this madness.

==Completion==
Excellent. [[Fyrakk]]'s forces are reeling from our assault.

Let us dragons handle the rest, <name>. This is [[Emerald Dream|our Dream]], and I will not suffer these invaders any longer.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Merithra|Once more to battle, [[Vyranoth]]. May this be the last between [[Dragon|our kind]].}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|You are a dreamer, little one. Like your mother before you.}}

As with past [[dragonriding]]-required quests, the nearby Green Dragon, with the Dream Bolt extra action button, can complete the objective if necessary:

{{book|content=
<The green dragon eyes you expectantly.>

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Accessibility)}} Help me fly.}}
}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Fyrakk has retreated to the temple entrance. His Primalists are desperately trying to break the barrier.}}

On completion of both, an [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cinematic]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|RXJ6eooJCgQ}}
:''Ashendir Hartwood looks at the battlefield.''
:{{Text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|Amirdrassil will fall to flame!}}
:{{Text|say|Ashendir Hartwood|<Screaming powerfully>}}
:''Ashendir transforms into his fire hawk form and flies upwards, then descends into a group of Dream Warden fighters as a meteorite, crashing and transforming into a gigantic magma giant.''

==Progression==
{{A Dream of Fields and Fire}}
