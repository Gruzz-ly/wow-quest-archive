==Objectives==
Collect 6 Sprouted Seedlings from [[Sneaky Podling]]s.
* [[Sprouted Seedling]] (6)

==Description==
Admittedly, I do not know what to do next.

If he is to rest here... flowers would be lovely.

The [[podling]]s in this area have been hiding among the flowers. Retrieve seeds from them, Champion, and I will make them bloom.

I think [[Gracus]] will like the flowers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
There must be something more that we...

No. [[Ysera]] seems certain.

==Completion==
Encouraging new growth on an occasion such as this feels right.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ysera|That is a wonderful start, sister.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I just wish there was more that could be done.}}

Interact with [[Violet Forget-Me-Not]]s to summon a [[Sneaky Podling]]. Defeat six for their [[Sprouted Seedling]].

==Progression==
