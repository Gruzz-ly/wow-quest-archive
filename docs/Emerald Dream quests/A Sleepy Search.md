'''A Sleepy Search''' begins an optional side storyline in the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Check up with the sleeping [[druid]]s.

==Description==
In our fight against [[Fyrakk]]'s forces, a group of my fellow druids went out in search for a quiet and safe place to rest. But with Fyrakk's forces closing in on their location...

I have to start planning for another assault, I can't split my time as much as I wish.

I last saw them heading south to a cave by the shore. Please, I just need to make sure they're safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Have Fyrakk's forces attacked us?

As you can see, there is no issue with that here.

However, I do have a much bigger problem on my hands.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|[[Icarius]]|I hope they were able to find a safe place to rest...}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Icarius|Please make sure the druids are safe!}}

Head to the [[Slumbersome Shores]] and enter the cave at {{co|58.0|77.9|Emerald Dream (zone)}}:
:{{Text|say|[[Thaalean]]|Shhh! Don't wake up the other druids!}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Thaalean|I need to rest, I need my strength. But I can't sleep!}}
:{{Text|say|Thaalean|I just... need your help.}}
