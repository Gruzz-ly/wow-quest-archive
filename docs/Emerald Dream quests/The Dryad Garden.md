'''The Dryad Garden''' begins an optional storyline in the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ethidris Creekward]] in the [[Root-Bound Sanctuary]].

==Description==
<Name>, there is a situation I am personally concerned about.

A garden cared for by my kin, the [[dryad]]s, has suffered from growing pains amidst [[Amirdrassil]]'s growth.

An overwrought [[druid]] currently tends the garden, but I suspect he will need more assistance than he has requested.

Please assist him in his task on my behalf.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}

==Completion==
[[Cenarius]] himself sent you? Wonderful. We need the help.

We must find that dryad acorn!
