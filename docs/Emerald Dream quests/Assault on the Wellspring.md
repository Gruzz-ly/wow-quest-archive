==Objectives==
Spy on the [[Wellspring of Life]] with [[Buri]].
* Observe the Wellspring of Life {{co|33.6|30.6|Emerald Dream (zone)}}

==Description==
[[Terro]] gave his life to protect the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]]. Which means we must see it through.

[[Vyranoth]] should be able to handle [[Lethka]], we must find [[Suzska]].

I hope Lethka did not attack her first. We should start looking near the Wellspring. 

Meet me there so we can continue our search.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Come on, let's head to the Wellspring.

==Completion==
Buri is here?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Buri|Come on, <name>! Suzska should be closer to the Wellspring.}}
:''Buri flies off.''

Catch up with Buri and speak with him at the [[Field of Flames]]:

{{book|content=
Do you see that? I think that's Suzska!

{{gossip|quest=|{{text|rare|(Play Movie)}} <Look where Buri is indicating.>}}}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cinematic]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|IRNR00uMdNA}}
:''Druids of the Flame are channeling fire into the barrier, while Fyrakk oversees the effort.''
:{{Text|say|[[Gangshe]]|We waste precious time.}}
:{{Text|say|Gangshe|[[Fyr'alath the Dreamrender|Dream Render]] could cleave this barrier in an instant!}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|Is this simple task too much for you?}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|Once the Wellspring is filled with flames... my flames... it will set the entire realm ablaze.}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|Then through [[Amirdrassil|that tree]], all [[Azeroth]] will burn.}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|Yet you would have me squander my power to make up for your failures?}}
:{{Text|say|Gangshe|I only thought...}}
:''Gangshe kneels.''
:{{Text|say|Gangshe|Forgive me. We will bring this barrier down.}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|No. You will not.}}
:''Fyrakk obliterates Gangshe with shadowflame, killing him. The other druids and [[Igira]] watch the scene. The druids then resume working on the barrier, and Fyrakk transforms into his dragon form and flies away.''

After the cinematic:
:{{text|say|Buri|There she is. You can get closer without me drawing their attention.}}

Fly over and check in with [[Suzska]]:

{{book|content=
Fyrakk is a poor leader. His mission is doomed to fail.

{{gossip|Who are the Claws of Vyranoth?}}

By now I am sure you have heard of the Claws of Vyranoth. I was a member as well.

When we were separated, Fyrakk found me to be the most capable. He left me in charge of his troops attacking the barrier.

His mind is scattered. He cannot lead an army in his current state. 

This plan was doomed from the start.
