The '''Guardians of the Dream campaign''' covers the quests added in [[patch 10.2.0]], predominantly taking place in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]] as part of the overarching [[Dragonflight campaign]].

==Prelude: The Coalition of Flames==
The Coalition of Flames storyline was added in [[patch 10.1.7]] during the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]], and serves as a required prelude to the campaign proper.

Shandris Feathermoon summoned you to investigate a secret meeting of two Incarnates, Fyrakk and Vyranoth. You discovered that Fyrakk has allied with Druids of the Flame in his merciless endeavor to enter the Emerald Dream and seize control of what grows within.
