{{questportrait|Sickened Growth.jpg|Sickened Growth|The podlings have poked, prodded, and poisoned this mass of plants to produce a perilous opponent.}}

==Objectives==
Defeat the Sickened Growth in the [[Twisting Wood]].
*[[Sickened Growth]] slain
*Return to [[Dionaessa]] in the [[Root-Bound Sanctuary]].

==Description==
Guardian! These [[podling]]s have been poisoning the [[lasher]]s, and now they have twisted that [[mandragora]]!

If we do not stop it, it will spread the poison to the garden. This must be what had the wildlife in the garden so disturbed. They were on the verge of invasion!

Let us kill it. This is what you have prepared me for--a dire quest!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*[[Plump Dreamseed]]
*5x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]

==Completion==
Hey-ah, Guardian! I have never felt more alive than with a spear in hand!

<Dionaessa smiles in a way that bares all of her teeth.>

Thank you for your guardianship!

==Notes==
The mandragora is at {{co|58.2|72.3|Emerald Dream (zone)}}. Attack it:
:{{Text|say|Dionaessa|Let me eviscerate the next one, Guardian!}}

During the fight, it summons [[Infected Lasher]]s. After defeat:
:{{Text|say|Dionaessa|Ha! Taste defeat, plant! Now to pull out all that poison.}}
:''Dionaessa casts a rejuvenating spell.''
:{{Text|say|Dionaessa|Guh... hrmm. That was unpleasant.}}
:{{Text|say|Dionaessa|Oh. I'm feeling better already! See? Just like [[Melyrine Petalshade|Melyrine]] taught me.}}
:{{Text|say|Dionaessa|I can't wait to show her. I'll meet you back at the garden!}}
