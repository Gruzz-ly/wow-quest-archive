==Objectives==
Investigate the pool area in [[Mmarl]].
* Find the problem

==Description==
Nope, nope, nope!

Look, I'm used to dealing with the additives in our swimming hole and keeping things at "marginally safe" levels, but spiders emerging to chew us to death? That's a hard pass from me. 

This is OUR place, why are they buggin' us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|5|85}}
* 2,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We put an incense beacon in there to keep bugs out. If the goblins changed it...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|They're not in town, are they?}}
:{{text|say|Grigg|Nah, they're in the cave we used to get here. Come on, I'll show you!}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|Ugh, fine, I'm coming too I guess.}}
:''They run off.''

Catch up with the gang at the pool:
:{{text|say|Grigg|There!}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Oh my! That cave is full of bugs!}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|You shoulda smelled it when we got here. Reeked worse than a set of ogre toes! We fixed it.}}

They have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Jenni Boombuckle|Look, when we first got here there was this censer inside pumping out this horrible smell. It made all of our equipment reek!

The first thing I did was change out the scent to something nice. I got a big promotion for my quick thinking!}}
{{dialogue|title=Grigg|Try not to ingest any of the pool water. It's ULTRA-sanitary, but also kind of poisonous.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|You 'fixed' the cave? Your new smell is attracting a nest!}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|Well at least someone around here appreciates a good perfume.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|<Name>, let's give them a hand with this.}}

{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|I bet some big guns will impress Jenni and Rhubarn. Sometimes brute force speaks louder than anything else.}}

==Progression==
