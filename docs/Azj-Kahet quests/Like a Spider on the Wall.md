==Objectives==
Explore the [[Umbral Bazaar]].
* Listen to the [[Sureki Crier]] {{co|54.8|20.2|City of Threads}}
* Discover the Cuisine Stalls {{co|49.3|26.8|City of Threads}}
* Read the [[Catalogue of Cagables|Twitchery Catalogue]] {{co|43.5|16.6|City of Threads}}
* Observe the Tailorers {{co|49.7|16.9|City of Threads}}
* Attempt to Meet [[Meesk the Venomtongue|Meesk]] {{co|62.1|20.7|City of Threads}}

==Description==
Inviting [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] was a risk... but even at this moment, I feel it was worth taking. I know it was.

I will speak with her on my own. In the meantime, I'd like you to venture into city above. The pheromones Nizrek gifted you will allow access into the Umbral Bazaar. Observe the merchants, listen to the conversations, purchase their goods.

This city is as vibrant as Stormwind. And its people are as worthy of freeing from abuse as our own. Experience for yourself how similar we all are.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Enjoy yourself? And no trouble with the pheromones, I hope.

==Completion==
A vibrant people, such as any other we've encountered together over the decades.

They deserve that same peace and protection that we seek for our own.

Let us vow that, when forced to fight, it will always be against the source of strife. Never the victims of it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Go see who the nerubians really are. You'll be surprised. We'll meet up with you later.}}
:''Anduin and Alleria walk closer to Nizrek.''

Anduin also has a {{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} gossip option:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|All right Anduin. Talk.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I don't expect you to understand. But I just... in that moment with the airship?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Maybe some part of me thought that would be enough for the Light to shine on me again.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|That--that maybe if I did what my father--}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|--but the Light didn't come. I found myself here, instead.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|His actions impressed me so much that I simply had to... redirect... his prison transport.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Faerin told me I needed to get out of my head about everything. I think she was right.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Maybe the Light hasn't returned to me. But this? This is what I'm best at.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Allying with monsters?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Helping people. I'm not going to let Xal'atath ruin a civilization--no matter how monstrous it appears.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|...and you feel unworthy of the Light.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I still don't trust these nerubians. But I trust you. And that's enough for now.}}

In the center of the quest area is a [[Sureki Crier]] and seven [[Umbral Citizens]]:
:{{text|say|Sureki Crier|Though a cold, dark mark may stain our hearts in grief for our late Queen Neferess' passing...}}
:{{text|say|Sureki Crier|From our newly elevated Queen, Ansurek, beloved daughter of Neferess, a gloriously warm fire makes its home anew to comfort us.}}
:{{text|say|Sureki Crier|May her reign oversee the splendor of our children for eons to come!}}

Just southwest are the cuisine stalls:
:{{text|say|Kurth|Larva Logs! Closing early, so get your logs now!}}
:{{text|say|Umbral Citizen|WAIT! You're closing early?!}}
:{{text|say|Kurth|Have to. Won't get a good spot in the Hollows for the Queen's Ascendance Day speech.}}
:{{text|say|Umbral Citizen|Gah! Then give me three Beetle Legs, a Larva Log, and a pair of Terroroasts!}}
:{{text|say|Kurth|Order up, Yaggi! Quick fry a jumbo stick, a log, and three B-Legs all day!}}
:{{text|say|Yaggi|Hrmph...}}

At the northwest end of the quest area is the [[Little Strings]] battle pet building, and a [[Catalogue of Cagables]] in the back corner:
:{{text|say|Tyro Whalekk|As you can see, we have quite a variety. Many procured from our very own Rak-Ush Ranch to the east.}}
:{{text|say|Tyro Whalekk|Feel free to peruse the store. The little critters are friendly enough to feed yourself.}}
:{{text|say|Tyro Whalekk|I'm legally obliged to inform you that we're not liable for any lost appendages, no matter the size or number.}}

Just east is the tailoring area:
:{{text|say|Silkswooner Waree|Is that new thread ready yet?}}
:{{text|say|Ja'free|Yes, Silkswooner! Arrived from the factories in Rak-Ahat this morning!}}
:{{text|say|Silkswooner Waree|Then untangle your legs and throw it on the mill! This warping won't stay hot forever!}}
:{{text|say|Ja'free|Yes, Silkswooner! Right away, Silkswooner!}}
:{{text|say|Silkswooner Waree|Don't drop the pace! Another wave of Ascended troops are loading up for tomorrow's incursion!}}
:{{text|say|Ja'free|Yes, Silkswooner!}}
:{{text|say|Meluume|Yes, Silkswooner!}}
:{{text|say|Saaria|Yes, Silkswooner!}}

At the far east of the quest area, [[Meesk the Venomtongue]] is guarded by [[Kel'an]], [[Nana Lak'kel]], [[Kel'an]], [[Doahr]], and [[Charmy]] and [[Sweety]]. Speak with Nana Lek'kel:
{{dialogue|Nope. Outta here.

{{gossip|Me? Why?}}

You're odd. I've never seen you before.

{{gossip|I just want to look inside.}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|<Step away.>}}

Doesn't matter. Meesk doesn't allow anyone without an invitation.

Before you ask: No, you're not invited.

{{gossip|Maybe you and I could just chat?}}<br>
{{gossip|You're making it even more interesting.}}<br>
{{gossip|Can I pet your beetles?}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|<Step away.>}}

If you don't take your leave, my girls might get angry.

Angry or hungry. Same thing.

{{gossip|I get the feeling we could be friends.}}<br>
{{gossip|No! Why don't YOU leave!}}<br>
{{gossip|Tell me, Nana. Who hurt you?}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|<Step away.>}}}}

Picking any non-quest option will advance to the next stage. After getting to the "Angry or hungry" step, the three non-quest options will cause Nana Lek'kel to expel the player from the city:
:{{text|say|Nana Lek'kel|You're all out of chances, two-eyes.}}

Once done with both quests, catch up with Anduin and Alleria at the [[Royal Apothecary]] near the center of the city:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We're here to observe and learn about Ansurek. That's all.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We've observed enough.}}
