==Objectives==
Speak to [[Aromash]] and care for the stagshells in [[Rak-Ush]].
* Water Trough filled (4)
* Food Trough filled (4)

==Description==
The stagshells will require constant maintenance. Food. Water. Those sorts of things.

Loathe as I am to admit it, the [[Niffen]] are much more skilled at caring for swarmbeasts than [[Vix'aron]] or [[Kish'nal|I]].

They can enlighten you on your duties, if this was not explanation enough.

Oh, I'm sorry, did you think this was a one and done assignment? If you did, Vix'aron would gladly "show you the door", as it were.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do not return to me until you have finished your lessons with the niffen.

==Completion==
I trust that wasn't too complicated for you?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Kish'nal|One of the niffen, Aromash, can explain the process in more detail, should you require.}}

{{gossip|Can you tell me more about the stagshells?}}

Stagshells are some of the most important swarmbeasts Rak-Ush provides Anub'azal with.

They're incredibly versatile! They can haul carts of supplies, they're more armored than a tank, and they have an incredible sense of smell!

Not quite as powerful as mine, but close!

They're some of the only creatures that can sniff out Kaheti truffles.

Mind you, these aren't truffles you want to be eating! They're mighty explosive, which explains why Anub'azal wants them so badly.

Even so, these stagshells are some of the friendliest swarmbeasts at Rak-Ush.

Don't be shy!}}

The niffen have named some of the stagshells: [[Bulbophyll]], [[Durania]], [[Helioceros]], [[Rafflesian]], [[Stapellia]], and [[Titannirum]]. 

[[Revanous Glowmite]] have a chance to appear while filling food and water troughs.
