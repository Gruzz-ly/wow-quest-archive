==Objectives==
Speak with the representatives of the [[Severed Threads]], then forge your first Pact.
*Learn of the Weaver's Pact
*Learn of the General's Pact
*Learn of the Vizier's Pact
*Forge a Pact

==Description==
The Severed Threads is ready for you and your allies. You will be a lit torch to [[Ansurek]]'s webs.

The General, the Vizier, and, myself, the Weaver, each have differing methods of combating our foes... And different benefits of aiding our accomplices. You may prefer to prioritize one, or perhaps to dabble with all three instead.

Meet with our representatives, and inform yourself on our varying practices. Then you may forge your first Pact.

Don't worry, little morsel, no choice is ever permanent.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Forging a Pact]]

==Progress==
Have you considered your options?

==Completion==
May your chosen patron favor you, as you have them.

The Weave-mother says you're good at cutting queensfolk. We're gonna get along good good good.

Speak with [[Tulumun]]:

{{Dialogue|Ah. You again.

Executor Nizrek sees something in you. I do not. But I do not question the master, so I suppose you win this round.

Speak with [[Y'tekhi]] or [[Lady Vinazian]]:
{{Dialogue|Fair greetings, overcrawler.

I understand that we're to be co-conspirators. Strange days for our peoples, no?

When you need to forge a new Pact or purchase... " select" goods, come speak to me.
