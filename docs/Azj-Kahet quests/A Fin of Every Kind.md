==Objectives==
Fill up the Kobyss Innards Sack.
*Innards Sack filled (0/100%)

==Description==
Oh! My! LEGS!

You're perfect! Yes! You're a perfect, little, unassuming biped for my work.

Alchemy is my trade, and an alchemist is only as good as their ingredients. See these [[kobyss]] below? I've been camped out here for weeks observing them.

They seem tougher than average kobyss. My conclusion? They must be made of stronger stuff! And I want that stuff!

Here's a sack. Fill it up! Fill it up with their innards! As much as you can carry!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is that really as much as you can carry?

==Completion==
Brilliant! Fabulous!

A sack brimming with promise, date, and... arterial goop.

==Notes==
{{dialogue|title=Al-kubian|The Executor will surely reward me for the new branch of Kobyss-based alchemy I bring to our people.

...Even if it did originate from our sewer water.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Al'kubian|That's the only innards sack I have. Don't ask for another.}}

The sack is filled by collecting [[Mangled Kobyss Innards]], [[Chunked Kobyss Innards]], [[Uncertain Kobyss Innards]], and [[Rotting Kobyss Innards]] from [[Adolchomper]]s, [[Dead Kobyss]], [[Drooling Salamuncher]]s, and [[Gutter Scarfer]]s. One of them will drop the [[Familiar-Looking Appendage]] which starts [[That's Pretty Gross]].

==Progression==
