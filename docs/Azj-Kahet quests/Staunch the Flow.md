==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Extractors.
* Extractors destroyed (8)

==Description==
Do they even understand what they are doing?

<[[Orweyna]] bares her teeth, practically growling.>

Destroy as many of those extractors as you can. Shatter the bulbs, snap the limbs, burn the wreckage.

We cannot stop them all, not today. But a bit of destruction may temper my rage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
They have already done so much damage. The creatures that once lived here, the earth that once thrived...

If we cannot stop them, we will take vengeance for that which they've destroyed beyond repair.
