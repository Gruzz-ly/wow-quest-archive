'''Chasing the Light''' begins the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]] alongside [[Heroes Never Die]].

==Objectives==
Search for clues of [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]'s survival.
* [[Crumpled Lion Gauntlet]] {{co|29.4|44.6|Azj-Kahet}}
* [[Bleached Bones (Azj-Kahet)]] {{co|26.6|43.0|Azj-Kahet}}
* [[Scrap of Weathered Fabric]] {{co|32.5|38.8|Azj-Kahet}}
*Return to Alleria at the edge of the Ruptured Lake in Azj-Kahet.

==Description==
Anduin survived that swarm. I do not doubt that for a moment. Even so, the [[nerubian]]s are everywhere and he is just one man.

Wherever he goes, wherever he is taken, I will find him. Find me any sign that he yet lives. That is all I need to follow him to [[Azeroth]]'s end.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You've returned.

I trust you have news.

==Completion==
A shattered gauntlet and some scraps of cloth... but no corpse. That's good, at least. He's alive, and he fought back.

Still, it's not much to go on. Most [[ranger]]s would be understandably stumped.

Luckily, I am not most rangers.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|Anduin would not have given up without a fight. He has to be be down there!}}
:''Alleria, Faerin, and the Arathi Aeroknights all jump off the airship into the fray.''

Before following them, [[Kal Smoulderbrow]] starts [[The Second Front]].

The three quest objects light up on the minimap. The [[Crumpled Lion Gauntlet]] is to the south under a pile of Airship Rubble. Two [[Nerubian Ambusher]]s pop out:
*{{text|say|Nerubian Ambusher|In Ansurek's name!}}
*{{text|say|Nerubian Ambusher|We rise!}}

A pile of Well-Bleached Bones are to the southwest, and a Weathered Cloth is to the northeast, hanging from a nerubian building.

Once done with both, catch up with Faerin and Alleria on a bluff looking south:
:{{text|say|Faerin|Do you see any sign of [[Orweyna|that woman]] who saved us?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|No. But I did find tracks leading south... And there's something foul down there as well.}}

==Progression==
{{Friends in the Dark}}
