==Objectives==
Capture and return 6 Feral Stagshells to [[Rak-Ush]].
* Battleshells retrieved (6)
* [[Smoke Grenade (Azj-Kahet)]] (provided)

==Description==
There are still feral stagshells on the outskirts of Rak-Ush.

This smell grenade should be sufficient in stunning the beasts and alerting the [[niffen]] to their location.

Once they are stunned, one of the rats will take them back to their hollow.

Capture them and bring them back.

We will be waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We still require more stagshells.

==Completion==
Excellent work.

==Notes==
Use the provided smoke bomb on a friendly [[Feral Stagshell]] and one of the recruited niffen from earlier will run up, hop on, and ride off:
* {{text|say|Let's get this broom-tail home!}}
* {{text|say|This stagshell's fit to be tied!}}
* {{text|say|This stagshell's madder than a wet niffen!}}
* {{text|say|Woah there! Let's get you home!}}
* {{text|say|Get along, little beetle!}}
* {{text|say|This beetle's about to boil over!}}}
