# Azj-Kahet storyline

[[File:VZ-Azj-Kahet.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''Azj-Kahet storyline''' starts after the [[Hallowfall storyline]] in [[Azj-Kahet]], the fourth and final zone of [[Khaz Algar]] as part of [[The War Within campaign]].

==Campaign==
The three-chapter campaign is tracked in [[Azj-Kahet (achievement)]]:

===Friends in the Dark===
Upon descending into [[Azj-Kahet]], the outsiders and their allies discovered that the [[nerubian]]s had anticipated their assault. The ''[[The Reckoning (airship)|Reckoning]]'' was ensnared in massive webs, and the [[Hallowfall Arathi|Arathi]] forces were scattered across the caverns. After rescuing as many stranded soldiers as possible, [[Faerin Lothar]] directed the outsiders to investigate a mysterious figure who had aided them during the airship attack. Following her trail, the outsiders encountered [[Orweyna]], a member of the secretive [[Haranir]]. She was studying a corruptive substance known as [[Black Blood]] and asked for their assistance in containing the damage left behind by the nerubians. Yet Orweyna's attempts at diplomacy were met with hostility from her own people, who clung to their ancient traditions of secrecy and shunned cooperation with outsiders. After aiding her investigation of a ruined nerubian watchtower, Orweyna bid the group farewell, her mission incomplete. Soon after, [[Spindle|a small spider]] appeared, carrying a strange message. Following it into the shadows, the outsiders came face to face with [[Widow Arak'nai|Arak'nai]]—the Weaver—a former member of the nerubian royal court. Once a trusted voice in [[Queen Ansurek]]'s service, she now seeks to remove the [[Xal'atath|dark powers]] corrupting the throne. She offered the outsiders a dangerous bargain: aid her in striking at the forces influencing the queen, and in return, she would help them reunite with their missing allies.

===Unraveling the Trapped===
The Weaver presented the outsiders with her first bargain: investigate the unrest within [[Siegehold]], the nerubian military headquarters, and in return she would reveal the whereabouts of some of their missing allies. At [[Faerin's Advance]], the outsiders regrouped with Faerin Lothar, who was gathering refugees that had escaped from nerubian captivity. There, they reunited with [[Flynn Fairwind]], and helped him uncover vital intelligence on movements within Siegehold. While Flynn departed to deliver the findings to the Weaver, the outsiders pressed deeper into the stronghold to investigate firsthand. Within Siegehold, they encountered [[General Anub'azal]]. His position had been usurped by [[Zev'kall]], one of the “ascended”—nerubians reshaped by the void into twisted, humanoid forms. Viewing ascension as an abomination, Anub'azal struck a bargain of his own: aid him in undermining Zev'kall, and he would ensure the safe escape of the rest of the outsider's allies. The outsiders sabotaged Zev'kall's lieutenants and uncovered his most damning secret: unable to produce the pheromones that commanded loyalty, he had begun harvesting and splicing them from other nerubians to maintain control. Armed with this knowledge, the outsiders escaped Siegehold and returned to the Weaver. Pleased with their discovery, she hinted that Anub'azal could become a valuable piece in her growing web of alliances.

===Plans Within Plans===
The Weaver revealed a new thread in her web: a message from a mysterious figure known only as the Vizier, who requested the outsiders' presence in the [[City of Threads]], the nerubian capital. Using pheromones stolen from Siegehold, the outsiders infiltrated the city, passing as loyal subjects to avoid detection. There, the Vizier was revealed to be [[Executor Nizrek]], Queen Ansurek's closest advisor—or so he appeared to be. In secret, Nizrek had grown disillusioned with his queen's rule. With him was [[Anduin Wrynn]], taken into Nizrek's custody after his capture at [[Livia's Patience]]. Anduin vouched that the Executor had acted in good faith, though [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]], arriving soon after, was far less trusting of their supposed ally. Together, they were tasked with witnessing Ansurek's “Ascension Day.” Before the gathered swarm, the queen openly embraced the void's power, proclaiming her covenant with Xal'atath. As she spoke, Alleria's sharp eyes caught sight of the dark figure herself, standing beside the queen. On instinct, she loosed an arrow—but the shadow dissolved, revealing only an illusion. The deception shattered, and Ansurek's soldiers surged against the intruders. Fighting to the city's edge, the outsiders and Anduin leapt from a high ledge into the waters below. Alleria lingered, confronted by Xal'atath's whispering temptations to embrace the void. But she resisted and leapt to safety as well. The group regrouped at the Weaver's lair. Ansurek, they now knew, was beyond redemption—she had given herself willingly to Xal'atath's influence. The Weaver, however, was pleased: with the Vizier and the disaffected General both within her reach, she saw her plans nearing fruition. Thanking the outsiders for their part in binding these alliances, she promised to summon them again when the time came to draw her web tight. Meanwhile, Anduin and Alleria returned to [[Dornogal]] to rally their allies for the greater war to come.
