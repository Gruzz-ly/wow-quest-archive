==Objectives==
Meet Orweyna and [[Hannan]] outside the Salien Gutters cave.
* Meet [[Orweyna]] in the [[Salien Gutters]]

==Description==
Hannan is correct only in that my presence here is not... strictly allowed.

But this corruption echoes in my mind, like a disruptive chord in the otherwise pure song of the world. Like a cry for help.

I must heed that call. I must follow the dissonance to its source and find the heart of it, so that I may discover how to cleanse it.

Join me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Orweyna gives a concerned glance toward the cave.>

When he agreed to come with me... I was supposed to watch over him. Make sure nothing bad happened.

==Notes==
Orweyna's gossip:
{{dialogue|This place was likely beautiful, once. Now... look at it.

<Orweyna narrows her eyes in the direction of the nerubians. For a moment, you think she is preparing to pounce.>

{{Gossip|<Ask Orweyna why Black Blood is dangerous.>}}

{{dialogue-child|Black Blood exposure has the power to distort and shift one's mind into a realm beyond our eyes. The Unseeming.

As for what lurks there, if you need more incentive to help me stop this corruption, let it be the monsters the Black Blood could unleash on our world. And if you're still not convinced, find a pool of the ooze to swim in. See for yourself if you enjoy what you discover the deeper you go into the Unseeming.}}

Hannan's gossip:
{{dialogue|<Hannan tries to ignore you, but at last he squirms at your attention.>

Do not speak to me. Please.

I am here to help Orweyna. That is all. You should just... forget you ever saw us.

{{Gossip|<Ask Hannan why he's so concerned about Orweyna's mission.>}}

{{dialogue-child|<The haranir glares at you.>

This is none of your concern.}}
}}

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Something feels wrong, distorted. I need to follow this feeling. See where it leads me.}}
:{{text|say|Hannan|I will follow you. But I still don't like this.}}

Upon catching up with Orweyna and Hannan at the [[Salient Gutters]]:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|This site is abandoned. Good. <name>, we can empty this extractor.}}
:{{text|say|Hannan|Wait. These devices are dangerous, we should not touch them!}}

Orweyna has new gossip:
{{dialogue|I need to find the heart of this harvesting operation. Then I can determine how to put a stop to it.

And a little destruction along the way would not be a bad idea.}}

Upon emptying the extractor:
:{{text|say|Hannan|Vile substance, I'm covered in--monsters... They're everywhere, run!}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Hannan, wait! I... I did not mean for this... I can fix this, Hannan.}}
