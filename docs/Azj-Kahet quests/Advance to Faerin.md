==Objectives==
Speak with [[Faerin Lothar]] at [[Faerin's Advance]].

==Description==
I have a little morsel all wrapped up from a corner of my web. Shall I share it with you? It's sure to mean your doom, little <race>.

Very well... I can smell your eager impatience. I've sent that little green blob of a [[goblin]] you call [[Gazlowe]] off to the northeast. He tells me the queen and high general are marshalling their elite shock troops. No doubt they are readying to invade [[Hallowfall]].

Scurry off to your [[Lamplighter]] friend. I'm certain she will want to smash everything in sight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Weaver sent you directly? Somehow I'm now even more concerned.

==Progression==
{{All Good Things...}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
