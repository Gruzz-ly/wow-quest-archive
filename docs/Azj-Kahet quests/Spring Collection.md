==Objectives==
Collect 12 Reclaimed Catalyst, as well as 3 Luminous Strangler Sap, 3 Eyeless Petals, and 3 Cochineal Crawlers.
* [[Reclaimed Catalyst]] (12)
* [[Luminous Strangler Sap]] (3)
* [[Eyeless Petal]] (3)
* [[Cochineal Crawler (item)]] (3)

==Description==
That maggot [[Ren'khat]] wants my position, hm? He's welcome to try and take it.

All the runoff from our operation flows into the spring below [[Rak-Ahat]]. Decades of mordants, catalysts, and alchemical concoctions have coalesced into something quite... potent.

Don't fuss about the side effects. Just bring me a good variety of dyestuffs and I'll brew up colors that will have you growing extra pairs of legs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're still here?

==Completion==
I think these will do. You're not as useless as I expected.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|In this business, you learn which dyes have the most... potent effects.}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|Deliver them to me at the dyeworks. My alchemists will know how to use them.}}
:{{text|say|An'zi|The Grand Overspinner doesn't like to wait! Move!}}

Upon meeting with Grand Overspinner Antourix and Ren'kat after completing both quests:
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|Aha, my secret weapon! <Name> has already dismantled your institution, Overspinner!}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|You witless soft-shell, <name> has been working for me!}}

Upon completion of both quests:
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|You can't stop me! I'll augment the dyes and take over all of Rak-Ahat!}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|You idiot! I already augmented the dyes!}}
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|I'll augment you out of existence!}}
