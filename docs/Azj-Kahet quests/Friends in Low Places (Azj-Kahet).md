==Objectives==
Search the [[Breathing Pit]] for your mysterious protector.
* Jump into the Breathing Pit (Optional)
* Mysterious Protector Found

==Description==
When we crashed, the [[nerubian]]s were upon us in an instant. We would have lost nearly everyone we brought with us, had someone not intervened.

I do not know who--or what--stepped in on our behalf. But if there is even a shred of hope that we have allies in this place then we must seize upon it and refuse to let go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah! You survived. Excellent. You have much to do.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin|We need to regroup.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|There's no time. You find the others. I'll find [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]].}}
:''Alleria quickly Void-levitates off to the south.''
:{{text|say|Faerin|Ashes, she's gone. Whoever saved us earlier clearly isn't a friend to the nerubians. Seek her out. I'll get everyone to safety.}}

Head down the hole, where Orweyna is channeling a beam of nature magic. She interrupts the cast when the player gets close:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|So you survived the ambush. Impressive.}}

Orweyna has gossip:
{{Dialogue|I have seen many things threaten the [[great roots]], though I admit that this [[Black Blood]] seems particularly virulent.

{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Who I am is none of your concern.

I've watched you since you and yours started trekking through the depths. I think you have a good heart, and I think you'll understand the threat that this Black Blood seems to pose to our world.

For now, that will have to be enough. I'm not at liberty to say more.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|Black Blood? What is that?}}
{{Dialogue-child|It is what you see before you. Blood of [[Old God|ancient enemies]] that has coalesced deep within the earth. This Black Blood was dislodged when the world itself suffered a [[Sword of Sargeras|grievous wound]]. It has been spreading ever since... and it is dangerous.

That is all you need know.
