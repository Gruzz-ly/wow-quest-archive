==Objectives==
Continue your efforts in aiding the Vizier in Azj-Kahet.
*Complete activities in [[Azj-Kahet]]
*Purchase a map from [[Yamas the Provider]]

==Description==
The Vizier works even now to spread our conspiracy's influence amongst the well-to-do of Azj-Kahet's elite. Given his position, though, he can offer little in the way of direct support.

That is where you come in. Your growing reputation precedes you; you can move in ways that the Vizier cannot. Just take care not to get eaten, hrm?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 18,300 [[XP]]
*[[The Vizier's Capital]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
I fear that our task grows more arduous with each passing day. I hope you are not wasting time.

==Completion==
Thanks to your efforts, the Vizier is one step closer to parity with the enemy.

For that, thanks are necessary.

==Notes==
Complete world quests, quests, and loot treasures.

==Patch changes==
