==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Arax'ne.png|Arax'ne|Arax'ne followed ancient nerubian tradition and ate her husband Klaskin after their wedding. Klaskin suspected she might, and hit a note with a key on his body asking for revenge.}}

Avenge [[Klaskin]] and kill [[Arax'ne]] in the [[Umbral Bazaar]].
*[[Arax'ne]] slain

==Description==
<You find a crumpled page of journal paper wrapped around a small key.>

I always suspected Arax'ne was a traditionalist, but I didn't think she'd go this far. I don't know where I'm going, but I just have to get away from her.

To whoever finds this, it means the worst has come to pass. This key unlocks a chest that contains all my worldly possessions. They are yours.

All I ask is that you avenge me by slaying Arax'ne.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The key glints silver in the light of Azj-Kahet.

==Completion==
The contents of this chest now belong to you.

--Klaskin

==Notes==
Enter [[Klaskin's Hollow]], just around the corner, where [[Xal'in]] and [[Zalnax]] are waiting. [[Arax'ne]] climbs down her web from the ceiling.
:{{text|say|Arax'ne|Did we have unfinished business?}}
:{{text|say|Zalnax|You think you can best Arax'ne?}}
:{{text|say|Xal'in|How dare you disrespect our customs?}}
:{{text|say|Arax'ne|Consuming one's husband is a nerubian's right! You had no right to interfere!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Arax'ne|Klaskin, I did not expect to join you... so soon...}}

Open [[Klaskin's Chest]] in the back of the room to turn in.
