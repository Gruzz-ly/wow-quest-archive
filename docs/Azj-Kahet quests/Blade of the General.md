==Objectives==
Continue your efforts in aiding the General in [[Azj-Kahet]].
*Complete activities in Azj-Kahet (0/100%)
*View [[Yamas the Provider]]'s Pact items (Optional)

==Description==
Even now, [[Anub'azal|General Anub'azal]]'s forces work tirelessly to ensure the security of Azj-Kahet.

[[Ansurek]]'s reach extends to every corner of her domain. The General seeks to undermine her military authority. If we stretch her resources thin, then the palace may become vulnerable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*18,300 [[XP]]
*[[The General's War Chest]]
*[[The General's Commendation]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
Ah, you've returned. Tell me of your triumphs.

==Completion==
You have returned alive, and the enemies of Anub'azal have not.

That is cause enough for recognition!
