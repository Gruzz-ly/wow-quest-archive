==Objectives==
Offer your services to Grand Overspinner Antourix against [[Ren'khat]].
* Ingratiate yourself to [[Grand Overspinner Antourix]]

==Description==
And now the other piece to this coup.

I've been operating under Grand Overspinner Antourix's mandibles for a while now. She's entrenched in Rak-Ahat, and thinks nothing can touch her at the top. She has already refused to submit to Ren'khat.

Even she knows that if Ren'khat has the backing of the throne then it is only a matter of time. Let us expedite her attempts to oust this upstart.

See how quickly they turn on each other.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|17|55}}
* 8,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
An overcrawler? Here? In MY dominion?! Minions! Slay them!

Wait! Wait...

You might be useful...

==Completion==
Ugh. I don't have time for any of this.

==Notes==
Upon approaching Teth:
:{{Text|say|Teth|Ah! You must be here to help with the... special shipments.}}

Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Teth|Grand Overspinner Antourix is usually busy overseeing the whole of Rak-Ahat, in her office to the east.}}
:{{text|say|Teth|Ren'khat has set up behind the western warehouse... I don't know if you could call it an office, really.}}
:{{text|say|Teth|More of a sad collection of discount furniture.}}

Upon approaching [[Grand Overspinner Antourix]] in [[Rak-Ahat]]:
:{{text|say|An'zi|Wait! No one talks to the Grand Overspinner without an appointment!}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|Oh, hush. Clearly our visitors have business.}}
{{dialogue|I don't usually handle inquiries from the rabble.

{{Gossip|quest=|Ren'khat thinks he should be in charge of your operation.}}

{{Gossip|quest=|Ren'khat thinks you're an outdated old hag.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|Oh, does he now?}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|No matter. I'll show that worm how I've held onto this position so long.}}
