==Objectives==
Speak to [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] when you're ready to observe the Ascendance Day speech, and exit the city quietly after.
* Speak with Anduin
* Watch Queen Sureki's Speech
* Escape from The Burrows

==Description==
That stage in the distance is where [[Ansurek]] will give her Ascendance Day speech.

You, [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]], and I shall make our way up one of the nearby towers and observe. If we are to turn her own citizens against her, then we must also gain as much first hand experience with her tactics as we can manage.

I've already told Alleria as much, but we cannot make our presence known. If we do run into any trouble, [[Executor Nizrek|the Vizier]] has arranged for a set of getaway fliers at the edge of the [[Burrows]] where we first met.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Threadmaestro's Collar]]
* [[Swarm-Maven's Amulet]]
* [[Queensfang Choker]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|46|80}}
* 14,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Vizier has made special accommodations for us to reach the tower we'll be observing from.

Sticking to the plan will mean we all get out safely.

==Completion==
We made it. Perhaps not as quietly as intended, but alive.

==Notes==
Speak with Anduin:
{{dialogue|Over the course of time, through obedience to the Light's guidance, one becomes more sensitive to its voice... and its power.

{{gossip|quest=|Yes. I'm ready to observe the Ascendance Day speech.}}}}

This starts an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]]: The Crow's Nest:
{{#ev:youtube|rpi4PIj0caE|The Crow's Nest}}<!-- alt S__zDN4rUHI -->

''Exterior, the City of Threads. The Kaheti nerubians are all gathered to hear Queen Ansurek speak.''

{{text|bossemote|Queen Ansurek|And this I promise to you all. With our renewed strength, our kingdom shall be reborn!}}

''The gathered nerubians start chittering. From a tower overlooking the queen, Anduin and Alleria are observing.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria|I can feel the Void's influence upon her. She's Xal'atath's creature now.}}

''Anduin turns his head to look at Alleria.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin|How could you know that?}}

''Alleria tightens her grip on her bow as she remains focused on Ansurek. Anduin notices.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin|Alleria, we need to go.}}

''Anduin rises and begins walking away. Alleria sighs before getting to her feet as well.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria|Maybe you're right.}}

''As Alleria takes a few steps, she groans as she is attacked by a vision of the void. Xal'atath's eyes appear for a brief moment. Alleria then gathers herself.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria|Wait.}}

''Alleria jogs back to the ledge and spots Xal'atath walking up beside Ansurek. Alleria's eyes widen.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria|She's here.}}

{{text|bossemote|Anduin|What?}}

''This stops Anduin in his tracks as he turns around to face Alleria.}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria|Xal'atath.}}

''Alleria draws her bow. Realizing a bit too late, Anduin runs over to try to stop her.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin|No!}}

''Whether from Anduin's yell or just sensing Alleria, Xal'atath turns to look up at them with a smile on her face.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria|For [[Khadgar]].}}

''Alleria looses her shot, and it would strike true, but Xal'atath ports away instantly before it lands. As the arrow strikes the ground with a clang, Ansurek turns to look at it. Alleria looks in disbelief as Xal'atath chuckles. Roaring, Ansurek looks up at Alleria and Anduin.''

{{text|bossemote|Nerubian guard|Get the queen to safety!}}

''Anduin runs up to Alleria.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin|Move! Now!}}

''Anduin runs off, not waiting for Alleria to respond. After a beat, Alleria turns and runs too.''

{{text|bossemote|Nerubian guard|Repel the intruders!}}

''Nerubians crawl and fly to Anduin and Alleria's former position.''

After the cutscene, the Escape the Burrows! scenario begins:

===Stage 1: Treadmaestro's Blockade===
: ''Fight through the blockade of nerubian troops!''
* Defeat Threadmaestro's troops (0/100%)
* [[Threadmaestro Fothis]] slain
* Destroy the Web Wall
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The Vizier left us flyers to escape with at the end of this path!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The entire city is closing in. We'll need to fight our way there.}}
:{{text|say|Threadmaestro Fothis|Overcrawlers! They would assassinate our beloved queen!}}

Step forward and [[Heelripper]]s and [[Sureki String Leader]]s start spawning:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria, what happened back there? This isn't you.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I had to take the shot! It was my chance to make up for [[Dalaran]]--for Khadgar!}}

At 40%:
:{{text|say|Threadmaestro Fothis|Next battalion, attack! Stall them until the queen's Fang arrives!}}

Some Crawlers, more string leaders, a [[Sureki String Conductor]], and [[Al'haggro]] and [[Gahn'dante]] leap in to the fray.

At 60%:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|You blame yourself? Alleria--that wasn't your fault!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I could have stopped it all  if I'd given in to the void as I am fated to!}}

At 100%, [[Threadmaestro Fothis]] jumps in astride his spider mount, [[Kra'jhendo]]:
:{{text|say|Threadmaestro Fothis|I'll slay you myself! The Fang will arrive to your corpses.}}

Finish off the mount, then the threadmaestro:
:{{text|say|Threadmaestro Fothis|But.. I have... ascended...}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Through the webs! We are not yet safe.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I don't expect you to understand what I'm dealing with.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But I do. I know all about blaming myself for things I couldn't possibly control.}}

Run forward to the Web Blockade and interact with it to destroy it.

===Stage 2: Swarm-Maven's Flying Ensemble===
:''Avoid the bombardment! Take out Swarm-Maven Donmiss!''
*[[Swarm-Maven Donmiss]] slain 
:''Alleria and Anduin run behind the wall as a huge wave of Swarmspike fliers are carpet bombing the hall.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Let's--wait! Get back!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|<Name>! Slip through and take out the commander. We'll keep that swarm at bay for you.}}

Dodge all the swirlies to get to the Swarm-Maven, then run into her:
:{{text|say|Swarm-Maven Donmiss|No! My swarmlings! Come back!}}
:''The swarmlings all fly off, and Anduin and Alleria sprint up the hall to engage.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Finally! Now I can get a clear shot.}}

At 30%:
:{{text|say|Swarm-Maven Donmiss|Shield me! Protect me!}}

A [[Mesmerized Flyer]] flies in and uses a suicide attack in an attempt to fend off the player. After that, Donmiss goes immune until interrupted and more Swarmspikes fly in to attack. Finish Donmiss off:
:{{text|say|Swarm-Maven Donmiss|For... the Queen...}}

===Stage 3: Escape in Sight===
:''Mount the Flyers at the edge of the Burrows.''
* Vizier's Flyers reached
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The flyers are just up ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria... Are you thinking of giving up? Giving in?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I know what it's like. I can't fix things for you. But you know who you are. And I can listen, if you need me.}}

Interact with one of the [[Vizier's Getaway Flyer]]s at the edge of the platform, but it's a trap!

===Stage 4: The Fang's Ambush===
:''Kill or be killed! This Fang of the Queen will not let you leave alive.
* [[Kx]], Fang of the Queen slain
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|What is that?}}
:''A red orb lands on the player, stunning Alleria, Anduin, and the player, knocking them away from the edge of the platform, and killing the three fliers.''
:{{text|say|Kx|Taste the venom of my fangs, overcrawlers.}}

Fend Kx off:
:{{text|say|Kx|More... will... come...}}

===Final Stage: One Way Out===
:''The only option is to jump!''
* JUMP!
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|What now? Our flyers are dead!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Jump!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Have you lost your--all right. Fine. Jumping it is!}}
:''Alleria and Anduin run up to the ledge, looking down.''

Nothing left but to jump off!

===Finale===
Jump off to start another in-game cinematic, Alleria and Xal at the Waterfall:
{{#ev:youtube|GAkYpw0WLQs|Alleria and Xal at the Waterfall}}

''Exterior, City of Threads. Alleria, the adventurer, and Anduin are on the edge of the platform. The adventurer immediately runs off. Alleria looks at Anduin, and with her eyes and a glance, she gestures for Anduin to follow. Anduin nods a jumps off as well, turning to look up at her as he falls. Instead of jumping, Alleria turns around and Xal'atath starts laughing delightedly.''

''Alleria narrows her eyes as Xal'atath, leading an army of nerubians, which fills the path, blocking her escape on foot. Alleria gets into her stance and draws her bow, but with an eyeroll and a look of exasperation, Xal'atath merely flicks her wrist and a void orb knocks the bow from Alleria's hand.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Oh... please.}}

''The bow falls off the edge of the platform. Alleria turns to watch it fall.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|I've seen you, Windrunner...}}

''Xal'atath's taunt snaps Alleria out of it, and she turns back to face the harbinger, floating closer to the edge of the platform.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Always alone, pushing everyone away to embrace the hunt.}}

''Xal'atath floats around behind Alleria.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Just like the monster you pretend not to be.}}

''Alleria doesn't move, but merely follows Xal'atath with her eyes. Xal'atath finishes circling behind Alleria and floats back toward the nerubians.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|You're the only monster here.}}

''Xal'atath does not deign to turn around at this.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Am I? You've slain hundreds to find me. Was that all really for Khadgar?}}

''This taunt lands, and Alleria winces in response.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Or is it just your nature to destroy?}}

''Xal'atath finally stops floating away and turns around, closing the gap once again, bringing her face mere inches from Alleria's.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Come Alleria. Embrace who you truly are.}}

''Alleria's eyes look around Xal'atath, then she closes them. Faces of important people flash by:''

{{text|bossemote|Locus Walker|Alleria.}}

{{text|bossemote|Khadgar|Alleria.}}

{{text|bossemote|Turalyon|Alleria.}}

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria.}}

''From down the waterfall, Anduin yells out, breaking Alleria from her thoughts.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria!}}

''Anduin's yell echoes as Alleria clenches her right hand, summoning some void magic.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I know who I am.}}

''With an aggresive grunt, Alleria throws a right straight punch into Xal'atath's torso, knocking the harbinger a few yards back. As Xal'atath gathers herself, Alleria smirks. Xal'atath chuckles with amusement in response, then gestures for two nerubian skitterlings to run forward.''

''Alleria back-steps, then with another smile, backflips off the platform. Xal'atath floats forward and looks as Alleria falls.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Run all you like. I'm coming for all of you.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, the player, Alleria, and Anduin have landed in a pool of water in the [[Salien Gutters]]. Start swimming to shore:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We're alive... soaked, but alive...}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Let's get to shore.}}
