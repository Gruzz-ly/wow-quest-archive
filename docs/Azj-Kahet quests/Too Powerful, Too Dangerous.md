==Objectives==
Find dangerous artifacts scattered around in the [[Breathing Pit]] and destroy them.
* Dangerous artifacts destroyed (3)

==Description==
Some of the relics the [[nerubian]]s now possess were housed in carefully-designed [[Dalaran Vaults|containment vaults]] on [[Dalaran]]. That is how dangerous and powerful they are.

With those vaults gone, the only course of action we can take is to destroy them.

In hindsight, it seems a grave mistake to have gathered so many powerful artifacts in one place--even if that place was Dalaran.

I would trust no one else with this task, <name>. Find and destroy those artifacts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We must reclaim what we can of the Kirin Tor's legacy.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

In the future, the Kirin Tor must find better ways to study and safeguard magical artifacts.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This bomb should not have been built. [[Council of Six|Kirin Tor leadership]] is to blame. But we are all complicit and must atone for it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will dispose of the bomb. Destroy the other artifacts and meet me in the [[Tranquil Strand]].}}

Destroy the [[Scroll of Permanent Polymorph]], the [[Staff of a Thousand Meteors]], and the [[Wand of Permafrost]]. They are marked on the minimap alongside the objects for the other quest.

After interacting with all six objects, meet up with Jaina in the Tranquil Strand. She is found with [[Archmage Khadgar]], [[Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]], [[Kalecgos]], the [[Kirin Tor Survivor]]s, the [[Sunreaver Battlemage]]s, and the [[Silver Covenant Spellcaster]]s.

:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|More [[mage]]s have arrived in our absence, <name>. That is... heartening to see.}}
