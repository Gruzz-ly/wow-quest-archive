==Objectives==
Plant [[Anub'azal]]'s Standard inside the [[Siegehold]] in [[Azj-Kahet]].
* Place the General's Banner

==Description==
We have worked together for some time now, <name>. I hope you have come to respect my vision as it pertains to the art of warfare. There are, as ever, rules that must be followed. Lines that must not be crossed.

[[Zev'kall]] has to die, and I have to be the one to do it. Every day that Ascended ruffian tramples upon the ideals of war tarnishes the legacy of our kingdom.

Please, do this last thing for me. Travel to the enemy stronghold and plant this flag on its steps. We will do this the correct way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Make haste. I would see this tale end sooner rather than later.

==Completion==
Even Zev'kall would not dare to dismiss a formal challenge.

Good.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|The time has come. Zev'kall's disrespect will be the end of him.}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|You have served me well thus far, soldier. You shall bear my banner and serve as my second. Now, come. Siegehold awaits.}}

On planting the banner:
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Zev'kall! The blood of my pupil soaks your hands. In the name of the queen, I demand satisfaction.}}

:''Zev'kall exits from Siegehold.''

:{{text|say|Zev'kall|Pfeh-heh! Finally snapped, have you? I knew it was only a matter of time. So sentimental, General Anub'azal.}}
:{{text|say|Zev'kall|Fine, then. I've been looking for an excuse to lay you low, anyhow. There are no places for fossils in our new empire.}}

==Progression==
{{General's Conviction}}
