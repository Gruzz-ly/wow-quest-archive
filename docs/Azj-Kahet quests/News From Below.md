'''News From Below''' concludes the third chapter of the max-level [[The War Within (achievement)]] campaign. The storyline immediately continues with [[A Mysterious Signal]].

==Objectives==
Inform [[Widow Arak'nai]] about what was found in the [[Transformatory]]. Then, return to [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] at [[Dornogal]] on the [[Isle of Dorn]].
* Inform the Weaver
* Take the burrow to Dornogal (Optional) {{co|57.4|41.7|Azj-Kahet}}
* Report back to Alleria at the [[Coreway]] in Dornogal

==Description==
I could hear the explosions from here. That'll buy us some time. Maybe I'd even be relieved, if this had gone less poorly.

[[Y'tekhi]] is secured in the back, where they can't overhear anything. Whatever [[Xal'atath]] did... it hasn't worn off yet. The Weaver has people looking into it, but the outlook is grim.

Alleria is going to want a status report. Good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Handwraps of the Weaver]]
*[[Sash of the Weaver]]
*[[Shoulderguards of the Weaver]]
*[[Mantle of the Weaver]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|70|20}}
* 18,300 [[XP]]
*15x [[Valorstones]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Weaver (faction)|The Weaver]] or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]]

==Completion==
At the end of the day, we delayed their advance and got some good, actionable intel that everyone up here can work towards.

Was it worth it? Time will tell.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|I told her about Y'tekhi and the convoy. You can tell her about everything we found inside the lab. Good luck.}}

Speak with [[Widow Arak'nai]]:
{{dialogue|Your spymaster has such a sullen expression. Is her face always like that, or do you have more to report?

{{gossip|quest=|<Inform the Weaver of your discoveries in the Transformatory.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Neferess... my queen... lives?}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|No, as you describe it, she is but a shell of herself. It would have been better if they'd just killed her...}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|You're wrong.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Am I? One monster has sympathy for another?}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|True death is the end of the story. Anything before that is workable.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Let's go, <name>. We've got a report to give topside.}}
:''Voss drops into stealth and walks off.''

Don't forget about the Tunnel to Dornogal by the inn. Then catch up with Lilian and Alleria at the Coreway:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Report, Voss? What's down there?}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Black Blood. They're hauling it up to Hallowfall. And... you won't like this.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Those Ascended nerubians... Xal'atath can stick her fingers right into their minds. They put up a hell of a fight.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|A tactic she uses all too often... we'll have to account for that when we face her again. Thank you, Voss.}}
