==Objectives==
Meet with [[Sum'latha]] at the [[Silken Ward]].

==Description==
You looking for work or something? <[[Linny Leadfinger|Linny]] squints her eyes at you.> If you're just hanging around I've heard some whispers from [[City of Threads|the capital]]. An associate of [[Widow Arak'nai|the Weaver]] is looking into some business in the Silken Ward.

The new ward is supposed to be a fresh start for citizens of the capital but the Queen's Pale Weavelashers have been treating it like a military camp. This isn't sittin' well with the populace.

Meet with a [[nerubian]] named Sum'latha outside the ward. She can fill you in on the details.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You must be the help our "mutual friend" sent. Welcome to the Silken Ward.
