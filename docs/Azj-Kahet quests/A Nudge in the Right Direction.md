==Objectives==
Kill 10 Pale Weavelashers around the [[Silken Ward]].
* [[Pale Weavelashers]] Slain (10)
* Show off Potions (3) (Optional)

==Description==
Wonderful wonderful, now that we have recovered my Brightshade Potions I want you to go around the Silken Ward and show them off!

This will draw the ire of the Pale Weavelashers I'm sure but I want to show the populace that we don't need to live under their thumb. With a little aggressive motivation we can strike out on our own.

Yes, yes, this will do! Go around the Silken Ward and kill Pale Weavelashers. My potions will provide an extra kick the citizens with certainly love.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be wary of any side effects the potions might have so I can document them.

==Completion==
The potions work wonders don't they, eh?
