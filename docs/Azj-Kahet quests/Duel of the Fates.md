*Signal the start of the duel
*[[Vexidal]] slain
*Duel Phase Change

==Description==
I am no hapless rube, <name>. I do not expect Zev'kall to honor the nature of this challenge in even the most nominal sense.

We are in the enemy's fortress, and we are surrounded by his teeming sycophants. There will be interference.

I have two orders for you, soldier. First, you will ward off any malcontents who wish to interrupt the duel. Second and more importantly, you will bring neither sword nor spell to bear against Zev'kall himself.

He will fall by my claws.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|4|32|50}}

==Completion==
It is done.

==Notes==
On starting the duel:
:{{text|say|Zev'kall|Oh, how I've dreamed of this moment. Are you ready to die, General?}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Always.}}

On defeating Vexidal:
:''Anub'azal kills Zev'kall.''
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Raaagh!}}

==Progression==
{{General's Conviction}}
