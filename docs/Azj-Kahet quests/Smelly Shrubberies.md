==Objectives==
Collect Smellsage bush branches for [[Rhubarn]].
* [[Smellsage Branch]] (6)

==Description==
[[Jenni Boombuckle|Jenni]] here says she's got some creepers attackin' the [[goblin]]s. I haven't seen any myself, but I do smell opportunity!

We've got our own anti-creeper perfume. It's the same recipe we use for the incense around town. Rub it on, and everything stays away! I'm sure we can sell some to the goblins.

But I'm out of materials--smellsage branches, specifically. If you gather some for me, I'll cut you in on the profits!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If you smell feet, you're in the right spot.

==Completion==
I could smell 'em the moment you came in! Those will work.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Jenni. Let's say we trade some of my future perfume vials for your newest model of Debugger Hat. Assuming it performs...}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|Sure! How about eight perfume bottles per hat?}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|EIGHT?!}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|One vial, one hat! That's how it works!}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|You're overlookin' the fabulous fashionality of the hat. That makes it worth at least six.}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Well yes, it IS very sparkly... but it could smell nicer.}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Three vials. I won't pay any more!}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|Four.}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Done.}}
