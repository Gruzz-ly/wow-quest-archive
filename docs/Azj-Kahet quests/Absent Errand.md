==Objectives==
Seek out [[Anub'azal]]'s student in the Skeins of Nerub'ar.
 
*Talk to [[Selective Historian]] (4)
*Listen from behind a box

==Description==
Do you remember [[Zev'kall's Attrition Log|the logbook]] you discovered in Zev'kall's office? It contained critical information about Zev'kall's misuse of our people. I gave it to my assistant, Anub'okki, to bring to the historians in the Skeins.

But I have not heard back from Anub'okki. I suspect foul play. See if anyone in the Skeins will admit to having seen him!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}

==Completion==
Let us speak, but we must do it quietly.

==Notes==
Requires Accomplice reputation with The General.

Selective Historians will have one of the following six gossip texts:
{{Dialogue|
*How may the Histories serve you, outsider?

*Walk softly, stranger. These old walls have ears.

*We decide which stories are told.

*You appear to have a question on your weird lips. Be quick!

*Do you seek a History lesson?

*Welcome to the Skeins, strange one. Have you come to better yourself?

*{{gossip|quest=|Have you seen Anub'azal's assistant?}}

After choosing the quest bubble, one of the following will be said:
*{{text|say|Selective Historian|Anub'okki? Never heard of him. Excuse me, I have critical things to do.}}
*{{text|say|Selective Historian|I saw nothing. Nothing at ALL!}}
*{{text|say|Selective Historian|You mean the--no! No, I have no idea who you mean.}}

When hiding behind the box:
:{{text|say|Gossping Historian|Did you see that corpse get removed?}}
:{{text|say|Gossping Historian|Hush, don't speak about uit. You could be next}}
:''Ukos'via apporaches from inside the [[Skein of the Dynasty]].''
:{{text|whisper|Ukos'via|You there. I heard you seek information about Anub'okki.}}
