'''A Most Intriguing Invitation''' begins the Plans Within Plans chapter of the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]]. This questline eventually unlocks the Portal to Dornogal in the [[Weaver's Lair]] and the reverse portal in [[Dornogal]].

==Objectives==
Meet the '[[Exector Nizrek|Vizier]]' in the [[Burrows]] of [[Azj-Kahet]]'s [[City of Threads]].
* Apply Pheromones {{co|56.0|43.5|Azj-Kahet}}
* Arrive in the Burrows {{co|67.2|25.1|City of Threads||1}}
* Take [[Vizier's Personal Swarmite|The Vizier's Flyer]] (Optional) {{co|55.7|44.3|Azj-Kahet}}
* [[The Vizier's Invitation]] (provided)

==Description==
We've received an invitation. Or rather, you have, <name>.

It's a request to meet with the Vizier. That name rattles even the most wealthy and powerful figures in the City of Threads.

Gaining this individual as an ally could seal our victory against Ansurek's horrid little shadow for good.

You're to meet them in the Burrows. Use the pheromone dispenser here in my lair to mask yourself enough to enter safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It surprises me little to see that you've made allies amongst the Kaheti, <name>.

And, yes. I'm alive and well.

<A wry smile crawls across [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]'s face.>

Not too much of a shock, I hope?

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Closer. Come closer, <name>. Don't be afraid. I have a secret to share.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|A suspicious invitation, but a face-to-face meeting with the Vizier could be quite the boon for my little conspiracy.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|And of course there's the matter of your ally. Go. See what you can unravel.}}

Arak'nai provides [[The Vizier's Invitation]], which reads:
{{book|content=Greetings, <name>.

I've received word of your exploits in this fair land of ours, as well as your recent treaties with the individuals known as "The Weaver" and "The General".

I believe that it is now my turn.

Come to the Burrows in the City of Threads. I understand that you've acquired Pheromones from Anub'azal? Those should be adequate enough to provide you umbrage in said Burrows, but no where else. I'll provide you something more substantial than that should we come to a pact during our conference.

Oh. If you're still uncertain of our meeting, then just know that I've got information on your lost lordling of Stormwind. You're not likely to learn of it elsewhere.}}

Just to the east is a [[Pheromone Dispenser]]. Get close and use the extra action button:
:{{abilities|Apply Pheromones|Masking yourself with Pheromones will allow safe access in The Burrows.}}

Much like with the general's pheromones in the [[Siegehold]], this will turn ''most'' nerubians friendly, but there are truesight-capable units that will eject caught players from the city.

Should players not wish to fly over on their own, the [[Vizier's Personal Swarmite]] will ferry them over. As it lands, a [[Swarmite Handler]] walks over:
:{{text|say|Swarmite Handler|You are expected inside the first facility on your left.}}

Enter the [[Apothecary's Alcove]]:
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Ah. Welcome! I am Executor Nizrek, also known as the Vizier. Your willingness to meet humbles me.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|My friend! You made it.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Sorry for the cloak and dagger. We just couldn't risk being discovered.}}

Nizrek and Anduin have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Executor Nizrek|Your fair Anduin is quite the learned one for his age. We've whiled the time with discussion of history, economics, narrative fictions, and, of course, what
virtues our two culture have in common.

I wonder what similarities you'll observe yourself.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|I wish we could sit down and catch each other up properly...

But, as always, time is never on our side.

{{Gossip|What happened to you? How did you get here?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
When the nerubians dragged me away, I thought I was done for...

But instead of being taken to a prison, I was brought here, to Executor Nizrek.

He wished to exchange words, not blows. And in doing so, I have learned that this city and its inhabitants are in dire need of aid. These aren't monsters, <name>. They need our help.

I realize how strange this all sounds. But I speak the truth.
