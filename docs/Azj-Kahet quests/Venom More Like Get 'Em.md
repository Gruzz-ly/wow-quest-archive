'''Venom? More Like Get 'Em''' is the second in a series of grindy quests to obtain [[Siesbarg (mount)]] as a flying mount. To begin, level {{level|tww-max}} players should defeat [[Tka'ktath]], on a floating platform above the [[Salien Gutters]] in [[Azj-Kahet]], and loot a [[Vial of Tka'ktath's Blood]]. Then, collect 1,500 [[Nerubian Chitin (Khaz Algar)]] from enemies in [[Khaz Algar]] for [[Those Are Chitin Words]].

For this quest, Shalba wants 1,000 [[Nerubian Venom]], specifically from [[nerubian]] enemies. Many of the same sources from the previous quest will suffice for this quest. Rare spawns [[Rhak'ik]] and [[Khak'ik]] on patrol of the [[Silken Path]] near {{co|44|30|Azj-Kahet}} drop 10-12 venom. Enemies in the [[City of Threads (instance)|City of Threads]] dungeon are also a good source.

==Objectives==
Collect enough Nerubian Venom for [[Shalba]]'s experiment.
* [[Nerubian Venom]] (1,000)

==Description==
Now that we've acquired enough chitin samples to splice into the perfect armor, we need the perfect venom. Don't look at me like that. Our forms should always be powerful and capable of defending themselves!

I'll begin incorporating the new carapace requirements for [[Siesbarg]]'s [[Ascended nerubian|Ascension]] while you harvest what I need. Do keep in mind though, it must be [[nerubian]] venom, specifically. I'm afraid beetles and spiders simply won't do this time around. 

As for where you find it, well that's up to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Very good! This is exactly what I was looking for.

==Completion==
This will do nicely. Onto the final phase of my experiment!

==Progression==
{{Siesbarg}}
