==Objectives==
Investigate the Black Blood harvesting site.
* [[Storage Rack]]
* [[Functional Extractor]]
* [[Harmonizing Device]]

==Description==
So you're still alive.

Well. Since you've proven to be decently capable already...

The [[nerubian]]s are harvesting Black Blood nearby. It is a disturbing, horrific operation. If we allow this to persist, the corruption may spread. Which it will continue to do until it consumes everything.

I am going to take a look at the site. We must understand what they are doing if we are to put a stop to this.

You're welcome to join me. A pair of hands could be useful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These disgusting pustules, the veins of corruption... this is only the beginning of the damage this horrific operation could cause.

==Completion==
Here in the center of all of this corruption, I hear something calling to me. It pounds in my head like a drum.

I cannot just ignore it.

==Notes==
Orweyna's gossip:

Hannan's gossip:
{{dialogue|<The haranir eyes you with wary skepticism, just as he casts concerning glances toward the Arathi.>}}

Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Hannan|You're making me go where we could be discovered--again!}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Oh do not flinch, Hannan. Adventures can be good for your spine.}}

Investigate a storage rack:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Look at how much they already have, yet they're using the worms to find more... We must act quickly.}}
:{{text|say|Hannan|No, you need not act on this, Orweyna. Have you forgotten? We cannot get involved!}}

Investigate a functional extractor:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|They've built extractors, drawing the Black Blood from the earth... How many must we destroy to make a dent?}}
:{{text|say|Hannan|Destroy...? Orweyna, please. Walk away from this before anything gets worse.}}

Investigate harmonizing instrument:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Do you hear that gentle hum this device emits? It is how they're restoring themselves after exposure to the substance. How... inventive.}}
:{{text|say|Hannan|You've seen enough. We must go back.}}
