==Objectives==
Kill 8 Abductors in the [[Burrows]].
* Abductors slain (8)

==Description==
These abductors are rounding up citizens and no one in the Burrows can stop them. I think it is about time somebody did something. 

They stalk the Burrows thinking they are unseen but I can see them, we can all see them. It's just nobody here can oppose them. That is where you come in.

Hunt these abductors down and show them who is really the prey.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Hit the abductors extra hard for me.

==Completion==
I hope they squirmed in their last moments. I have no sympathy for those that turn on their own.

==Notes==
While freeing targets for [[Defense of the People]], defeat [[Izo'ratne Abudctor]]s, [[Shadeweave Abductor]]s, and [[Shadowblade Abductor]]s in the area.
