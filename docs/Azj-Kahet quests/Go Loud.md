==Objectives==
Plant 6 Commandeered Nerubian Charges at specified points across the convoy, then remotely detonate them.
*[[Repurposed Nerubian Charge|Charges planted]] (6)
*[[Dry Webbing|Fuse]] lit {{co|67.7|74.8|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
So much for keeping this operation quiet. At least now that our cover's blown, we can really mess things up.

They're hauling weapons across the south bridge. If we turn those weapons against them, they'll have to resupply their whole army. That'll buy us time, at least.

I've identified six weak spots across the convoy. Rig up bombs to all six, then get out of there and watch the fireworks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
They know we're here. May as well make the most of it.

==Completion==
Not only is the convoy in shambles, but we were able to slip away in the chaos. If there's one thing you're good at, it's making noise.

Staying quiet? Eh, we can work on it.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Those bombs should give me enough cover to drag Y'tekhi out of here.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Meet me back at the Weaver's Lair. We'll... figure out what to do with them.}}

Repurposed Nerubian Charges are marked on the minimap on the bridge, and the fuse is at the northern end.
