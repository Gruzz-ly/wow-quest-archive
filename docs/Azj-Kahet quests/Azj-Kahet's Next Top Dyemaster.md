==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ren'khat.png|Ren'khat and the Overspinner|The fued{{sic}} between Ren'khat and the Overspinner has come to blows. Finish them off!}}
Slay Ren'khat and Grand Overspinner Antourix.
* [[Ren'khat]] slain
* [[Grand Overspinner Antourix]] slain

==Description==
Ren'khat and the Overspinner are fighting pincer-and-claw. Inside the spinneret. With no witnesses.

We have a unique opportunity here. If they took one another out... well, with Antourix's favorites dispatched and the whole of [[Rak-Ahat]] in disarray, the next best authority would be the caravan coordinator. Me.

I don't love being in the spotlight, but it would be very beneficial to our secret-smuggling operation if those two didn't make it out of the dyeworks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 14,500 [[XP]]
*500x [[The Weaver (Notoriety)]]
*[[Message-Imprinted Silken Square]]
*35 [[Kej]]

==Completion==
The sheer scandal will have the record-keepers in the City of Threads busy for months.

And I'll make sure they don't look too closely at how it happened.

==Notes==
Teth's gossip:
{{dialogue|The dyeworks is the most precarious location in Rak-Ahat... but also the most glamorous. I'm not surprised this is all happening here.}}

On accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Teth|Do what you need to do. I'll go back to my shipping post and pretend I didn't see any of it.}}
:{{text|say|Teth|Afterwards, we'll see who ends up in charge of Rak-Ahat... what's left of it, anyway.}}

Upon approaching the targets who can be seen in battle with each other:
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|The Dyeworks is mine, you washed-up hag!}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|Not a chance! I've met beetles with better color sense!}}

Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|My ideas! My designs! Wasted!}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|You were all supposed to listen... to me...}}

Upon returning to Teth:
:{{text|say|Teth|Given how colorful you are, I assume the dyeworks was a success?}}
