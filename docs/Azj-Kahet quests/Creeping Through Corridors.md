==Objectives==
Investigate the western stockpile, central warehouse, and royal stores of the [[Transformatory]], using anger pheromones to distract guards and avoid detection.
* [[Canister of Vial Ooze|Eastern Stockpile]] investigated {{co|68.6|81.6|City of Threads}}
* [[Suspicious Shipping Container|Central Warehouse]] investigated {{co|61.9|89.6|City of Threads}}
* [[First Ascended's Prison]] investigated {{co|57.0|93.1|City of Threads}}

==Description==
I've identified three sites of interest to investigate. 

A stockpile on the east side of the complex, a warehouse in the center, and lastly, that big storehouse with royal [[Sureki]] flags outside it. We'll rendezvous there.

There's less chance of discovery if we move separately through the area. You may be hidden from most [[nerubian]]s, but the [[Ascended nerubian|Ascended]] will sniff you out. Chuck some of these anger pheromones at them if you get heat, it'll distract them.

Stay sharp, stay quiet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Don't let your guard down. Not here.

==Completion==
We came down here to figure out what these [[nerubian]]s were up to. I don't think I like the answer.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|If those Ascended guards get close, hit 'em with one of these vials. It'll provide a... distraction.}}
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|They don't look tough--I'm sure you'll be fine. Enjoy slinking around, I'll be walking right in.}}
:{{text|emote|Y'tekhi winks at you.}}
:''They walk off.''

Before heading out, Y'tekhi has gossip:
{{dialogue|Mm?

{{gossip|How do these aggression pheromones work?}}

They are... experimental. 

Any trueborn nerubian who catches a whiff of them will become incandescantly angry and feel compelled to attack.

You can see the utility in warfare, but also the potential for friendly fire. I'm not surprised they never saw widespread use.

{{gossip|How did you get them?}}

They fell off a rickshaw, of course. Lucky for us, mm?

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}}}

While on these quests, players have an extra action button:
:{{abilities|Vial of Aggression Pheromone|Pelt a patrolling guard with anger pheromones to temporarily distract them. {{text|red|Not available while in combat.}}|range=35|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant}}

Use it while not in combat on [[Ascended Webwarden]]s, who have truesight.

The [[Canister of Vial Ooze]] is inside a building to the east:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Yech, Black Blood. Don't touch that stuff. I'm not surprised we found some here, but I don't like that they're moving it around.}}

In the central warehouse is a [[Suspicious Shipping Container]]. Interact with it and an [[Ascension-Crazed Soldier]] pops out!
:{{text|yell|Ascension-Crazed Soldier|Blood! It's in my blood!}}

Fend it off:
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|Fresh from the Transformatory and still dripping with ichor. They're shipping these Ascended to the front before they've got their wits about them.}}

Head further southwest to the next marked building:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|This... changes the situation. I don't like the look of that huge thing.}}
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|It's an added bit of intrigue, that's for sure. Who's keeping it bound, and why?}}

Walk in and get close to the First Ascended, let it roar, then walk back to Lilian.
