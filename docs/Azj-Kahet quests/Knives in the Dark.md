==Objectives==
Slay 4 Sureki Assassins in the [[City of Threads]].
* [[Unseen Blade Zek]] slain
* [[Unseen Blade Kixaal]] slain
* [[Unseen Blade Oritex]] slain
* [[Unseen Blade Pali'zir]] slain

==Description==
No doubt you recall the assassin that sought to end me when last we met on this spot. If it weren't for your intervention, I would not be here now. Make no mistake, if my role in all of this has been compromised, that assassin will not be the last.

If I am to make my last great stand, then I will need your help in ensuring my safety until the final hour. Scour the city for more of those skulking threats, and do what you must to ensure they will not interrupt my speech.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}

==Progress==
Take care that you are thorough, friend. I would really rather not get stabbed today.

==Completion==
Preemptive violence is a tad gauche, I think. But given the circumstances, I believe the response was a proportional one.

==Progression==
{{Vizier's Resolve}}
