'''Radiant Incursion: Sureki's End''' is one of three sureki daily quests offered by [[Mylton Wyldbraun]] at the [[Flame's Radiance]] base camp at [[Morgaen's Tears]] in southwestern [[Hallowfall]]. This quest takes place at [[Arathi's End]] in northeastern [[Azj-Kahet]].

==Objectives==
Assist the [[Flame's Radiance]] and disrupt the Sureki forces at [[Arathi's End]].
* Field Elixir taken (Optional) {{co|63.0|8.0|Azj-Kahet}}
* Sureki Forces disrupted (0/100%)

==Description==
Credible intel has revealed the Sureki are regrouping for another assault. Now we take the fight to them!

The Flame's Radiance have rallied at [[Faerin's Advance]], and prepare to strike at the Sureki forces amassing in northern [[Azj-Kahet]].

Be warned, soldier. The Sureki in "Arathi's End" are greater in number and power. 

Should you require aid, our Sacredites in the field should be equipped with potions to assist you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Confiscated Cultist's Bag]]
* 55 [[Resonance Crystals]]
* 5 [[Weathered Undermine Crest]]
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
* +200 reputation with [[Flame's Radiance]] (via [[Flame's Radiance (currency)]]), +100 for [[alt]]s

==Progress==
We must not let them gather strength. Now is the time to strike!

==Completion==
Many Lamplighters and soldiers have been lost in the graveyard they call "Arathi's End".

On behalf of those lost in the dark, and those here on the front, I thank you.

==Notes==
The [[Sacred Alchemist]] at Arathi's End has this to say:
{{dialogue|A new shipment of our sacred battle elixirs have arrived from the Priory, including a more potent drought for field testing.

The Sureki gathered below are more powerful than other nerubians we've seen of late.

Care to test the elixir in your fight below?

{{gossip|quest=|<Take the elixir.>}}}}

This provides an untimed buff: {{abilities|Liquid Divination|While in Arathi's End your healing, damage, and health are all increased by 30%.}}

Rescuing Arathi Prisoners results in them saying one of the following:
*{{text|say|For Hallowfall!}}
*{{text|say|What is your name, stranger? I owe you my life.}}
*{{text|say|By the Holy Flame, I will avenge the fallen!}}
*{{text|say|I shall not forget this!}}
*{{text|say|I will sing your praises when I get back across the wall.}}
*{{text|say|Thank you, <class>. Are there other survivors?}}

The Flame's Radiance has set up a forward camp at [[Faerin's Advance]], where [[Ysabel Gleamgaard]] leads the camp. Also present are [[Amy Lychenstone]], [[Errick Ryston]], and some unnamed [[Arathi Adherent]]s, [[Arathi Aeroknight]]s, [[Arathi Cleric]]s, [[Arathi Crusader]]s, [[Arathi Knight]]s, [[Arathi Priest]]s, [[Arathi Recruit]]s, [[Arathi Sentry|Arathi Sentries]], and [[Arathi Volunteer]]s.

[[Ysabel Gleamgaard]] has gossip:
{{dialogue|Are you here to answer the call of the Flame's Radiance? 

We have no shortage of Sureki forces to the north and south east--we could use all the help you can offer.}}
