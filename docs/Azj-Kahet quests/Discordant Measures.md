==Objectives==
Acquire 50 stacks of Unseeming Shift and collect 3 samples from elite enemies lost in the [[Unseeming]].

In addition to destroying extractors, you can also acquire Unseeming Shift by standing in pools of [[Black Blood]]. However, be careful as you will gain stacks quickly by doing so.
* Acquire 50 stacks of Unseeming Shift
* [[Corrupted Heart]]
* [[Sightless Eye (quest item)]]
* [[Root Sliver]]
* Meet [[Orweyna]] at the overlook

==Description==
I cannot stand to look at this any longer. I must act.

<Name>. You have survived the Unseeming before. Now we must go there together. I must see it for myself if I am to believe this vile place truly cannot be cleansed.

We will kill what we can and search for some sliver of hope that we can still restore this land.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 14,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[Hannan]]'s concerns are not unfounded.

But I cannot simply witness this corruption and make no attempt to root it out.

==Completion==
<[[Orweyna]]'s voice is low with rage, but you see it is heartbreak shining in her eyes.>

This place is truly too far gone. There is no fixing what they have done here.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|I must venture into the Unseeming and see if there is hope to restore this place yet.}}
:''Orweyna destroys a nearby black blood extractor covering herself in black blood and entering the Unseeming.''

Orweyna's gossip:
{{dialogue|We must go deeper than this into the Unseeming to track my prey.

I see no other option beyond exposing ourselves to the Black Blood.}}

After acquiring 50 stacks of [[Unseeming Shift]], find and defeat the [[Warped Sapling]], the [[Faceless One (Azj-kahet)]], and the [[Aberrant Deepwalker]].

Upon slaying the Warped Sapling:
:{{text|say|Warped Sapling|Returned to the earth... at last...}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Roots... This abomination was once a thriving natural life, in harmony with the world.}}

Upon engaging the Faceless One in combat:
:{{text|say|Faceless One|Submit to the Unseeming!}}
:Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Faceless One|Here we are... eternal...}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|So many too far gone to find harmony once more. The Unseeming may as well be a graveyard.}}

Upon defeating the Aberrant Deepwalker:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|It is as I said. The Unseeming claims creatures, heart and mind. They have lost themselves.}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Enough. The damage to this land truly is irreconcilable. Meet me back at the overlook.}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|I thought we could restore this place. ... I thought I could.}}
:{{text|say|Hannan|I know. But we cannot always force harmony. Even you don't bear that burden, Orweyna.}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|I... Thank you for following me down here, Hannan. And you as well, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Hannan|I want to help, Orweyna. But not like this. We need to regroup.}}

One can meet Orweyn and Hannan back at [[Wildcamp Ul'ar]] who have new gossip now. Orweyna's gossip: 
{{dialogue|There's a deeper mystery to solve here.

That might make the others uncomfortable, but I intend to figure it out.}}

Hannan's gossip: 
{{dialogue|After all that, it is good to see you.}}
