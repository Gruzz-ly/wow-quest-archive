==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Grand Gluttony.jpg|Grand Gluttony|A unique specimen of the kobyss race, complete with an artificially enhanced frontal lobe. Also eight extra teeth.}}
Collect the Brain of [[Grand Gluttony]].
* [[Swollen Brain of Gluttony]]

==Description==
I require one final piece of data.

These beasts think. They organize. They coordinate. To be characteristically honest, there's nothing worse than an amphibian with an abacus.

My final task for you: Bring me the brain of the biggest beast. I need it fresh, and preferably non-liquified.

And, you know, perhaps it will slow them down as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you got it? Is it leaking?

==Completion==
Fabulous! Absolutely fabulous!

Unrelated, the samples you've brought back are disgusting. I'm utterly appalled that you were willing to go without a sack again for the latter portion of our work together.

You should really wash your hands.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Al'kubian|The elixirs I'll make from these ingredients will become legend!}}
:{{text|say|Al'kubian|I don't know what they'll be just yet... but legendary they will be!}}
