'''The Weaver's Gift''' begins the Unraveling the Trapped chapter of the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]].

==Objectives==
Find the friends [[Widow Arak'nai|the Weaver]] has revealed to you as a gift.
* Weaver's gift located

==Description==
A little weave-rat tells me that an intriguing series of events are playing out to the north. It seems there has been a remarkably coincidental waterfall of failures marring the military efforts there.

I want to know who is responsible. Look into it for me, and see if your curiously binary eyes can pluck out any potential allies.

Some of your little friends are among the escapees drawing the ire of one "[[Zev'kall]]." Do go catch up. Tell them the Weaver bids them... greetings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We thought we were well hidden.

Clearly, not as hidden as we would have liked. But I am grateful to see you, nonetheless.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|There is no gift more valuable than information, my little morsel. Now shoo.}}

Before leaving, [[Linny Leadfinger]] starts an optional quest, [[Strange Bats]].

Head north to [[Faerin's Advance]], another quest hub! [[Faerin Lothar]] and her team have moved quickly, and members of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]], [[Earthen Ring]], and [[Kirin Tor]] have tagged along.

Approach Faerin:
:{{Text|say|Faerin Lothar|<Name>, over here.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|<Name>! You weren't followed, were you?}}

Faerin has gossip:
{{dialogue|I can't let my gut lead the way every time.}}

Faerin also starts optional quests: [[Where the Wild Things Camp]], and [[Beneath the Roots]].

==Progression==
{{Unraveling the Trapped}}
