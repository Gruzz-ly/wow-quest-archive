==Objectives==
Bring Meesk the Venomtongue to meet the Weaver.
* [[Meesk the Venomtongue]] escorted

==Description==
Oh, this is exciting! A meeting with someone who commands even overcrawlers to do their bidding. I have been waiting for a moment like this.

Ah, I won't have to go too far though, will I? I am meant to host some up-and-coming [[Sureki]] socialites for dinner later tonight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* [[The Weaver's Trove]]

==Completion==
Make no mistake, <name>. I care nothing for Meesk's gratuitous proclivities. They were a convenient means of destroying him, but I am in no position to cast aspersions on matters of fickle morality.

We all scuttle about in the dark in search of that which gives us satisfaction. Meesk invoked Neferess' name for his own gain, and he put one of my weave-rats in danger. For that, he needed to suffer.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Meesk the Venomtongue|This will be just delightful. At this rate, I'll have my pockets lined with [[:kej]], courtesy of all of Azj-Kahet's most industrious schemers!}}

Upon escorting Meesk to Spindle:
:{{text|say|Meesk the Venomtongue|What in the name of... Hey! Stop that weave-rat! How did it escape?!}}
:{{text|say|Meesk the Venomtongue|Ha! I have you cornered now, you pilfering little weave-trash!}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Gracious. The little fly thinks he's a proper spider, but he cannot even tell when he's caught in a web.}}
:{{text|say|Meesk the Venomtongue|By the-- who do you think you are? I'll have you know I am one of Ansurek's most prized--}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|You seem to be laboring under the assumption that I care a wit for who you claim to be. I do not. But I WILL tell you who I am. And I will tell you what you are.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|I am the Widow Arak'nai, the stewardess of Queen Neferess' legacy and the one who weaves the threads of a free Azj-Kahet. And you, Meesk, are nothing more than a trifling supper.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Come now, my little ones. It is dinner time.}}
:{{text|say|Meesk the Venomtongue|No... stay back...! AHHHH!}}
:''Widow Arak'nai envelops Meesk in webs as weave rats swarm him, including [[Bobbin]], Bobbin (again), [[Thimble]], [[Swift (nerubian)|Swift]], and [[Treadle]].''
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|How pitiful. Come, my little morsel. Let us return to more pleasant webs. You've done well.}}

Upon complete:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|You know, little morsel, so few of us get to decide what we leave behind.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Neferess is gone. Her legacy can stand on its own, and mine will remain cosigned to the shadows. But I think that suits me well.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|I have never toiled in service of name or station. Everything I do, I do for Neferess. For the future that she pursued.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Even now, the unbound threads of her vision's tapestry remains. So I shall serve as its weaver in her stead.}}
