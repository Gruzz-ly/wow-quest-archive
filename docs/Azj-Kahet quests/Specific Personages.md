==Objectives==
Kill [[Zev'kall]]'s minions for [[Anub'azal|General Anub'azal]].
* [[Mi'thk]] slain {{co|46.7|28.6|Azj-Kahet}}
* [[Diu'mik]] slain {{co|48.9|23.8|Azj-Kahet}}
* [[Hevo'myk]] slain {{co|44.5|27.9|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
Zev'kall has recently placed his own loyal lackeys in key positions around [[Siegehold]]. Killing them will force replacements, which will cause chaos and re-training.

All of which will make Zev'kall struggle. Get rid of all three.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Shroud of the Whisperer]]
* [[Drape of the Heritage Lord]]
* [[Cloak of the Tactician]]
* [[Cape of the Favored]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
All three must be removed from office.

==Completion==
Zev'kall knows that I am involved. I wanted him to know. But he can say nothing, because he is unable to make his own pheromone marks. I have used mine for his needs, so far.

If he admits he can't, everyone would question his authority... not to mention his status as a nerubian.

It is quite a scandal.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Eliminating ZeVkall's lackeys is but the first move. Blackmail will be the death blow.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I'm gonna salvage what I can here. Throw together an explosive or two!}}
:''Gazlowe walks over to his [[Busted Shredder X-3922]].''

Gazlowe has gossip:
{{dialogue|My poor Shredder has seen better days, for sure.

{{gossip|What are you making now?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
If I can find a few specific pieces, I'll be able to form some explosives. If our friends are in cages, we'll be able to bust 'em right out!

I don't think I have enough time to whip together a flamethrower, but I'll do my best here.

Outside, move around freely, but watch out for the [[Siege Dominator]]s, which have truesight.

Mi'thk, the favorite, is to the south:
:{{text|say|Mi'thk|Attaching yourself to Anub'azal is a dead-end path!}}

At 25%, Mi'thk attempts to flee:
:{{text|say|Mi'thk|No! I can't lose like this!}}
:{{text|yell|Mi'thk|Help, HELP!!}}

Diu'mik, the tactician, is to the southeast:
:{{text|say|Diu'mik|Zev'kall is ready for insignificant pests like you.}}

Hevo'myk, the drone whisperer, is to the southwest:
:{{text|say|Hevo'myk|The drones are mine now. You are easy prey for them.}}

Kill the third:
:{{text|yell|Anub'azal|Oh no. Loyal voices silenced. Seems Zev'kall wasn't paying attention.}}
:{{text|yell|Zev'kall|I noticed you trying to defend your own obsolescence, you dusty ancient.}}
