==Objectives==
Search various containers inside the Underkeep for 8 Unidentified Tinderboxes and Aelric's Corrupted Tinderbox.
* The Underkeep entered
* [[Aelric's Corrupted Tinderbox]]
* [[Unidentified Tinderbox]] (8)

==Description==
Contained within the Underkeep lies a tinderbox, once belonging to the late Aelric Leid.

This item reeks of powerful, corruptive energy. Its close proximity has leeched out to touch many nerubians.

Your task is to retrieve that box and deliver it to me. To be safe, gather any tinderboxes you may find--we'll destroy them all, just in case.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the tinderboxes?

==Completion==
Quickly, give it to me--we should not allow it to be seen in public!

==Progression==
