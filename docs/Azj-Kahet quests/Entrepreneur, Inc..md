==Objectives==
Find [[Ripsnoodle]] in [[Mmarl]].

==Description==
Okay, color me impressed. You are officially my Coinchamp! It's like a champion, only I pay you to do things. A [[mercenary]], only with better branding.

You should meet my business partner, Ripsnoodle. He's working out some deals with his own coinchamps with the niffin over at Mmarl. He might have more work for you--though I recommend not buying anything he tries to sell you.

You can find Mmarl east of here. Just follow your nose, you can smell it from a mile away.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Weaver (faction)|The Weaver]]
* [[Disturbance Detection Device]]
*35 [[Kej]]

==Completion==
[[Skedgit Cinderbangs|Skedgit]] actually found something out there? She always did have a good nose for business.
