'''Radiant Incursion: Toxins and Pheromones''' is one of three sureki daily quests offered by [[Mylton Wyldbraun]] at the [[Flame's Radiance]] base camp at [[Morgaen's Tears]] in southwestern [[Hallowfall]]. This quest takes place in the [[Untamed Valley]] of east-central [[Azj-Kahet]].

==Objectives==
Aid the [[Flame's Radiance]] in disrupting the Sureki forces in the [[Untamed Valley]].
* Sureki forces disrupted (0/100%)

==Description==
Our allies in [[Azj-Kahet]] have identified a strategic location to strike at the Sureki.

According to reports, our enemies are gathering toxins to fuel their war machines.
 
Let's take this opportunity to cut off their supplies, and perhaps better our own understanding of their alchemy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Confiscated Cultist's Bag]]
* 55 [[Resonance Crystals]]
* 5 [[Weathered Undermine Crest]]
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
* +200 reputation with [[Flame's Radiance]] (via [[Flame's Radiance (currency)]]), +100 for [[alt]]s

==Progress==
Nerubian toxins are volatile, even for our most skill{{sic}} healers and medics.

==Completion==
Whatever it is the Sureki are gathering, we must assume it's not good.

Perhaps our Sacredites can manufacture some antidotes with the samples you found.

Your help is always appreciated, my friend. The Flame's Radiance burns brighter because of you.

==Notes==
South of the valley, [[Lamplighter Kaerter]] runs the camp, and [[Lamplighter Leif]], [[Y'tekhi]], [[Scout Wayshelm]], [[Daeyana Gleamgaard]], [[Weed Reaper Basir]], and some unnamed [[Arathi Crusader]]s, [[Arathi Recruit]]s, and [[Arathi Field Sacredite]]s are present. Several characters have gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Y'tekhi|Surprised to see me? You shouldn't be.

I'm here to keep an eye on things, and make sure this... 'Flame's Radiance...' doesn't have too much fun in its hunt for Sureki.

The Weaver approves burning away tattered threads to save the rest of the web... provided the flames don't burn out of control.

{{gossip|Who are you?}}
{{dialogue-child|A friend of the Weaver's. And an enemy of Ansurek. That's all you really need to know.<br>

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}
{{gossip|Last we spoke, you were under Xal'atath's influence!}}
{{dialogue-child|I got better. Were you worried about me? How... sweet.

{{gossip|Lilian Voss was worried.}}

<Y'tekhi's expression shifts, almost imperceptibly.>

Yes, well. We'll have to save the tearful reunion for later. For now, there's loyalists to kill.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}

{{gossip|Why are the Sureki attacking Hallowfall again?}}
{{dialogue-child|The Sureki are a desperate and vengeful sickness, ever loyal to a Queen who betrayed her empire. 

With Ansurek's death, they've turned to an enemy they believe is responsible for the demise of their queen.

Of course, we both know that is simply not the case. But it is easy to garner support to your cause when you can redirect the confused and angered to someone they've always seen as their enemy.

The Severed Threads work to maintain order in the City of Threads--but the Weaver is glad to see the head cut from this thrashing, dying snake.
