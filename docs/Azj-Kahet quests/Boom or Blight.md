==Objectives==
Cull 10 worms of the Wormlands.
* [[Jawcrawler|Worms]] of the [[Wormlands]] slain (10)

==Description==
This place is infested with [[Jawcrawler|cave borers]]. They pose a threat to the [[great roots]] that stretch through this place.

Yes, the tree provides sustenance for many living things, but this is not some small band of bugs nibbling on a leaf. This is a blight. Their numbers must be culled for the good of the whole.

By my oath I am unable to raise a hand to interfere. However... you have sworn no such oath. Will you do what must be done?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How fairs the blight?

==Completion==
You have my gratitude, stranger.

==Notes==
Enter the cave and players will automatically accept [[Heeeelllp!!!]]. While in the cave, the [[Tremorsense]] bar fills as players move, and drains as they stand still. Don't let it hit 100%.

Kill [[Wild Razormouth]]s, [[Razormouth Devourer]]s, [[Ahg'zagall]], and [[Chasm Maker]]s.

On complete of both, Na'layro has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|You have done what I am forbidden to. You have gone where I cannot and fought that which must not know I exist.

It is almost liberating to have such help. Though please, do not take it personally if I never tell my people of our meeting.

I thank you for your efforts.}}

==Progression==
# [[Strange Bats]] (optional breadcrumb)
# [[Boom or Blight]] & [[Intention vs Instinct]]
