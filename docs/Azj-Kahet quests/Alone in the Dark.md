==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Eye of Ansurek]].
* Meet [[Orweyna]] at the Eye of Ansurek{{Co|42.36|54.15|Azj-Kahet}}
* Overlook Investigated{{Co|44.3|57.23|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
[[Haranir|My people]] do not think that this [[Black Blood]] is a threat to our world. It has sat dormant for ages, after all. Why should that change now?

But the world is changing more quickly than my people realize. The [[nerubian]]s' decision to extract the Blood for their own ends is proof of that.

The nerubians hold a watchtower not far from here. The ones who survived [[Breathing Pit|the pit]] could not have gotten too far. We should give chase immediately.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|17|55}}
* 8,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The bizarre creature's eyes remain locked upon you, unwavering. It nudges something towards you--a scroll with a thick seal of violet wax.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Come with me. You need to know what you fight against.}}
:''Orweyna shifts to bat form and flies off.''

Catch up with her at the [[Eye of Ansurek]]:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|[[Alleria Windrunner|Someone]] was here first. Not a battle. A hunt.}}
:''She inspects the corpse of a dead nerubian.''
:{{text|say|Orweyna|The trail runs cold. Check the watch tower.}}
:''She runs off.''

Catch up with her again at the overlook, looking out at the [[City of Threads]]:
{{Dialogue|It would seem our trail runs cold here.

{{gossip|quest=|Where do we go from here?}}}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|The City of Threads. The heart of Azj-Kahet. Bled dry and dying.}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|None who enter leave in one piece. [[Anduin Wrynn|Your friend]] is likely dead.}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|But I know you will not accept that. So you follow your path, and I will follow mine.}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|You have survived so far. Keep doing so. I hope we meet again.}}
:''She shifts to bat form and flies off. [[Spindle]] quietly comes walking and stops some distance behind the player.''
