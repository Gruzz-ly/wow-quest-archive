'''Strange Bats''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]] in the [[Weaver's Lair]].

==Objectives==
Investigate a possible [[druid]] sighting.

==Description==
Hey. [[Widow Arak'nai|Her ladyship]] has a lead on some really strange bat that was flying around the [[Wormlands]].

The [[Spy|spies]] reported it behaving more like a person than a [[bat]]. We think we might have a druid out there, but it ain't revealin' itself to the [[nerubian]]s on purpose.

You have one of those faces that make people hesitate before punching. Head out there and take a look.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You! You are just what I need.

==Notes==
Head northwest out of the [[Weaver's Lair]] in the direction of the [[Wormlands]]. Just outside the tunnel to get into the Wormlands, catch up with [[Greenspeaker Na'layro]], who has gossip:

{{Dialogue|Walk softly here. The ground listens.

Who I am is unimportant. If anyone should ask you, especially my own people, I would consider it a kindness if you did not mention we ever spoke.

However, who you are is of great importance. You are someone unburdened by the oaths I am sworn to. You can do things I am forbidden from interfering with, no matter how much good it might bring.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Greenspeaker Na'layro|Walk softly! They can hear your footsteps.}}

==Progression==
# [[Strange Bats]] (optional breadcrumb)
# [[Boom or Blight]] & [[Intention vs Instinct]]
