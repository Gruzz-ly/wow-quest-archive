==Objectives==
Collect enough Nerubian Blood for [[Shalba]]'s experiment.
* [[Nerubian Blood]] (500)

==Description==
Excellent! The end draws near! But although we near completion, we cannot go without the most important part of this genetic equation--the blood. We need a small ocean's worth of [[nerubian]] blood.

However, to make this new form foolproof, the blood must come from the strongest nerubians to exist. Whether [[skyrazor]] or [[Ascended]], it doesn't matter. This will guarantee we have the best genetic material available.

The kind of material that [[Siesbarg]] deserves!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Our experiment nears fruition, overcrawler.

==Completion==
Brace yourself--you are about to witness perfection!

==Progression==
{{Siesbarg}}
