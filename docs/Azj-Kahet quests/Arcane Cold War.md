==Objectives==
[[File:Arcane Cold War.jpg|thumb|The aftereffects of a mana bomb in Azj-Kahet]]
Travel to Azj-Kahet and meet with Lady Jaina Proudmoore.
*[[Jaina]] found in [[Azj-Kahet]]
*[[Portal to Azj-Kahet|Portal]] taken (Optional)

==Description==
A few [[mage]]s have come but... I expected more to act on [[Aethas]]'s call to action.

But perhaps that was wishful thinking.

We need more help despite what you and [[Kalecgos]] did at [[Mourning Rise]]. Aside from [[Kel'Thuzad]]'s pendant, the [[kobold]]s' plunder was middling-powered artifacts.

Meanwhile, there have been reports of powerful magical objects filtering through Azj-Kahet, meaning the [[nerubian]]s must have scavenged [[Dalaran]]'s crash first!

We must find these artifacts before they are used against us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
We may have arrived too late, <name>. For all of us.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|<Name>, come with me. We will deal with the nerubians ourselves.}}
:''Jaina opens a [[Portal to Azj-Kahet]] and takes it.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|And as quickly as she arrived, she is gone.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Don't be so hard on her, Aethas. She is not taking this as well as it would appear.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|I know. I just was hoping to get her help with "arrangements" since she had been here when Dalaran fell.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Ah. I see. Well, maybe I can help. Have you ever heard of a [[tuskarr]] chieftain named [[Ponoliak]]?}}

Characters have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|This is a start, but there are hardly as many here as I had hoped for.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Kalecgos|We should have known. 

It was foolish to think that others wouldn't be tempted by the artifacts left behind in Dalaran's remains.

Power like that rarely goes unnoticed.}}

Take the Portal to Azj-Kahet and meet up with Jaina Proudmoore in the [[Breathing Pit]]:
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|A [[mana bomb]]. This is a worst-case scenario. And we only have ourselves to blame.}}
