==Objectives==
Choose a [[Severed Threads]] Pact.
* Choose a Pact

==Description==
Let us renew your Pact.

Remember, you may only enter a Pact with one of the Severed Threads at a time. These contracts are temporary, though, so you will have many opportunities to prove yourself to all three.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Choose your Pact wisely. Azj-Kahet can be a dangerous place.

==Completion==
May your chosen patron favor you, as you have them.

==Notes==
[[File:Forge a Pact UI.jpg|thumb|Pact choice UI]]

Speak with [[Lady Vinazian]] again:
{{dialogue|With Y'tekhi indisposed, you may come to me with your questions of rewards and deeds with the Severed Threads.

{{gossip|quest=|Choose a member of the Severed Threads to renew your Pact with.}}}}

The pact choice interface appears:

;The Weaver
:Undermine the threat of Xal'atath.
;The General
:Destroy ascended loyalists and redeem the military's honor.
;The Vizier
:Machinate policics and sabotage Sureki influence.

This is an account-wide choice for the week. Picking one will complete this quest and start [[Eyes of the Weaver]], [[Blade of the General]], or [[Hand of the Vizier]].
