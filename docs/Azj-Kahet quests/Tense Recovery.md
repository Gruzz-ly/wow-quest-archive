==Objectives==
Speak to the strangers to improve relations with the [[Arathi]].
* Speak with [[On'hiea]]
* Speak with [[Ney'leia]]

==Description==
Things with these strangers are... tense. We do appreciate being allowed to take cover here in their camp. But they only seem to tolerate us at best. We offered to share our supplies, but that offended them, somehow.

[[Daeyana Gleamgaard|My sister]] is gravely wounded. I can see herbs I could use to help her in that tent over there, but that giant snail is blocking the entrance. I can't get to them.

I asked the guard on the hill for aid, but all he did was glare. I don't know what to do! Perhaps he'll listen to you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|17|55}}
* 8,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You are not unwelcome, stranger. I am the last.

==Notes==
Ysabel Gleamgaard's gossip:
{{dialogue|My sister means everything to me, but it will be worse for her if we are kicked out of this camp for giving offense.

{{gossip|What is this place?}}

{{dialogue-child|I... scarcely know myself. It was deserted when we arrived, save for a variety of wildlife that are taking shelter here. Two of the camp's inhabitants showed up shortly after we did. They didn't ask us to leave, but didn't really speak to us either. They simply returned to their duties.

All this wild growth, this far underground... I don't understand it at all, but the area is a soothing respite from nerubian attacks, at least.

{{gossip|Thank you for the information.}}}}

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Ysabel Gleamgaard|Watch yourself. If looks could kill, I'd be worse off than my sister.}}

Go talk to [[On'hiea]]:
{{dialogue|<On'hiea steadfastly ignores your presence.>

{{gossip|quest=|It seems like things are strained between you and the Arathi. What can they do?}}

{{dialogue-child|
<On'hiea gives you a cold, steady stare, then returns his gaze to the camp below.>

{{gossip|Okay then.}}}}
}}

Go talk to [[Ney'leia]] next:
{{dialogue|Your eyes are full of questions, stranger.

{{gossip|It seems like things are strained between you and the Arathi. What can they do?}}

{{dialogue-child|Strained? Strange. We have welcomed them into our haven of safety.

It is true they do not understand us. We have ways that are private and sacred.

I suspect that is true of you as well. I cannot tell you more, but if you wish to understand us even a little, you will have to learn from another. A root ancient is not bound by the same rules as we. If you find one, perhaps they will ease your mind and offer enlightenment.

{{gossip|I'll find an ancient.}}
