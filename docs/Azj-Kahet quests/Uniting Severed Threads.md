'''Uniting Severed Threads''' concludes the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]], and thus, the level-up portion of [[The War Within campaign]]. The max-level [[The War Within (achievement)]] storyline starts at level {{level|tww-max}}.

==Objectives==
Join forces with the Weaver, the General, and the Vizier to forge the [[Severed Threads]].
*General's Shadecaster activated
*Vizier's Shadecaster activated
*Speak to the Weaver to begin the conference
*Witness the formation of the Severed Threads

==Description==
You have done well to ally Anub'azal and Nizrek to our cause. 

It is time that we solidify this triumverate relationship between us all. We will conference via shadecasters. Activate them when you're ready to begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 reputation with [[General (faction)|The General]]
* +200 reputation with [[Weaver (faction)|The Weaver]]
* +200 reputation with [[Vizier (faction)|The Vizier]] or 140x [[Kej]]
* [[Azj-Kahet (achievement)]]

==Progress==
I wonder how our three potent personalities will work together. Only time will tell, I suppose.

==Completion==
I expected far more verbal dueling than what occurred. To be so willing to work with one another must mean these times are dark indeed.

We have a long road ahead of us. I will say plainly that your help has been invaluable. It may end up being the thread that allows my people to survive.

Thank you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Activate these shadecasters. We'll use them to speak Anub'azal and Nizrek.}}

Activate the two shadecasters and speak with the Weaver again:

{{Dialogue|Shall we begin our talks?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Begin Severed Threads conference.>}}
}}

:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Our mutual agent has informed me that their allies from above will storm our realm for Xal'atath's head.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|However, disposing of Xal'atath will not be enough to save our people. It is Ansurek that is leading us to our downfall.}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Ah! You speak of insurrection.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|You don't know our queen as I know her. Our people go missing, dark forces walk the palace. Ansurek only thinks of power.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|But she is still Neferess' blood! Is there no redeeming her?}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|We've blinded our tired hearts from the truth, Widow. Ansurek is nothing like her mother.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Indeed. But we three can work together to restore Neferess' ideals instead.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|I understand. We must slay Ansurek and sever the threads that shackle our people.}}
After the conference is done:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|This gives me hope. We have a large web to spin, but I believe this first strand will hold.}}
On completion:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Let's make haste, <name>. We must notify our allies of what we've uncovered.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Spread word to your companions of we Severed Threads. They may seek shelter and respite with us when they find it necessary.}}
