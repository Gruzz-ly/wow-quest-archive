==Objectives==
Find a Tuning Crystal.
*[[Tuning Crystal]]

==Description==
The [[nerubian]]s have some artificial means of cleansing their minds after interacting with the Black Blood.

If necessary, I'll be able to resonate using my own magic. But for your sake, we should probably find out how they do it.

Unless you don't mind the threat of permanent mental corruption, of course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The nerubians must have something on them to cleanse their minds after such direct proximity to the Black Blood.

==Notes==
Orweyna has gossip:
{{Dialogue|I need to find the heart of this harvesting operation. Then I can determine how to put a stop to it.

And a little destruction along the way would not be a bad idea.

{{Gossip|<Ask Orweyna why Black Blood is dangerous.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Black Blood exposure has the power to distort and shift one's mind into a realm beyond our eyes. The [[Unseeming]].

As for what lurks there, if you need more incentive to help me stop this corruption, let it be the monsters the Black Blood could unleash on our world.

And if you're still not convinced, find a pool of the ooze to swim in. See for yourself if you enjoy what you discover the deeper you go into the Unseeming.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}
}}

==Completion==
A tuning crystal? Fascinating.

Though I cannot say I'm too impressed with the solution. They brought this problem upon themselves, after all.

==Progression==
{{Melody of Madness}}
