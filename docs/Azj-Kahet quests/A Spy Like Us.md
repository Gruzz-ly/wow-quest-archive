==Objectives==
Meet with [[Gut'usul]] in the [[Burrows]].

==Description==
Distressing news comes from the Burrows, a sinister plan is unfolding in the gutters below. Citizens of the ward have been disappearing at an alarming rate. 

[[Skeinspinner Takazj]] and [[Anub'arash]] have all the subtlety of a hammer. I doubt it is their work. This is the hand of someone more subtle.

I have a contact in the Burrows. His name is Gut'usul. Meet with him in the Burrows and find out what is going on down below.
