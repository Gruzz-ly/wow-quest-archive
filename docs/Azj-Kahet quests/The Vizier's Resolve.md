==Notes==
This quest is a criterion of [[Vizier than Ever]].

On accept:
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|The time has come. Join Tulumun in the Bazaar square. I shall meet you all there in time.}}

At the square a crowd has gathered and one can speak with the people that were invited in the previous quest:

{{Dialogue|title=Orator Tx'itk|The Vizier is infamous for his work in the lower wards, but he is known by the denizens of the High Hollows as well.

When Queen Ansurek came to power, she restricted residency in the Hollows only to those who adequately proved their loyalty. Places to nest became scarce, and many of us were in danger of being pushed out. Eventually, the Vizier caught wind and exerted his influence.

Apparently the Master of Domiciles found a severed beetle head in his web. The problem resolved itself shortly thereafter.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Ar'syn|Even a master thief like me cannot help but respect the Vizier. His schemes benefit the people, yes. But it is their artistry that I admire. I am something of an alchemist myself, but the Vizier's work is second to none.

It seems like every other day there is a new potion or poultice making the rounds in the burrows and beyond, specifically catered to the needs of Azj-Kahet's most deprived. All of that work and consideration, and not for a cent of profit?

I may not understand it, but I cannot help but admire it.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Rakva|Queen Ansurek's Ascended believe themselves entitled to everything we trueborn toil for. When they first emerged, they took and took--they would have taken the eyes out of our heads if they believed that they could do so.

The Vizier changed that. Even the Ascended did not wish to take from those who spoke his name. Eventually, piles of our stolen resources began to appear in the Bazaar square, dropped there in the dead of night.

I don't know who the Vizier is. Frankly, I don't care. Our lives would be that much harder if it weren't for him.}}

When you are ready, speak with Tulumun:
{{Dialogue|The Vizier awaits my signal. We did not wish to start without you. After all you've done, he felt it only right that you bear witness to this moment.

Are you ready?

{{Gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}
}}

A shadecaster from the balcony will begin to play.
:{{text|say|The Vizier|People of Azj-Kahet. Heed the words of your Vizier.}}
:{{text|say|The Vizier|Long have I served you from behind a mask, thinking it would secure me our future. But times have changed.}}
:{{text|say|The Vizier|No longer will I feign service to our oppressors. I will serve you not as a shadow, but as a fellow citizen.}}

Nizrek walks out from beneath the balcony.
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|I am Executor Nizrek. Today, I walk into the future unburdened. And I invite you all to walk with me.}}
