==Objectives==
Rescue the straggler in [[Rak-Zakaz]].
* Straggler found
* Talk to [[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]]

==Description==
If someone got left behind, we need to do something about that.

I hate to say it, but these people need someone to protect them here. I have to stay.

Find this straggler. And while you're at it, take a peek behind enemy lines. See if you can find anything useful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The others all made it to safety, right?

==Completion==
I definitely had everything under control.

<Flynn winces.>

But... I'll admit, this venom is dulling my otherwise lightning-quick reflexes, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Madman or no, I won't stand for a single soul being left behind. Go find him.}}

Head east into [[Rak-Zakaz]] to find [[Flynn Fairwind]] hiding behind a lightpole, envenomed, and speaking with [[Spindle]]:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Message received. Now shoo, little spider! You'll blow my cover.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|You, over here! And stay low.}}

Speak with Flynn:
{{Dialogue|
Don't draw attention. Look-- something's happening up there.

{{gossip|<Ask Flynn why he stayed behind.>}}

{{dialogue-child|
I was looking around, trying to find an antidote to being a bit stabbed with a venomous dagger, when that little spider with the bell found me. It came with a note from someone called the Weaver. The Weaver wants anything I can find...

<He winces.>

In exchange, she has the antidote to this burning venom waiting for me. I'm very... motivated. The heat is eating a hole through my shoulder. So I'm looking for something about other captives, invasion plans, weaknesses, anything.

Not to mention, they took some of my personal effects that I wasn't willing to leave without. I'm not sentimental about gifts, but Shaw knows blades. I want them back.

An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|TdakvIoiF6M|Scrappy Straggler}}

''Exterior, Rak-Zakaz, Azj-Kahet. [[Flynn Fairwind]], envenomed from a strike to his flank, and the adventurer are hiding behind a light pole, watching an ascended nerubian berate his underlings.''

{{text|bossemote|Zev'kall|My orders were clear. And yet, more overcrawlers regularly slip from our grasp.}}

{{text|bossemote|Zev'kall|Failure! Unacceptable! Not only does this shame you, it shames me.}}

''Zev'kall brings one of his left hands to one of his rights in a punch.''

{{text|bossemote|Zev'kall|Which means no one will hear of it.}}

''Zev'kall equips two one-handed swords from nowhere and performs a sweeping strike through the three nerubians with an enraged hiss, instantly killing them.''

{{text|bossemote|Zev'kall|Clean up this refuse and get it out of my sight. And if you breathe a word of this to anyone, you're next.}}

''Zev'kall walks away, not even deigning to look at his assistant, who observed the whole scene. Flynn and the adventurer are still watching from behind the pole.

Flynn has new gossip:
{{dialogue|<Flynn groans in pain from his injury.>}}

==Beta==
;Completion
I definitely had everything under control.

<Flynn winces.>

But... I'll admit, it's a relief to see you, <name>.
