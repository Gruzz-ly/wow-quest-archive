==Description==
I fear I have grown too brazen in my offerings of succor as of late. I seem to have attracted some untoward eyes.

Be on guard. A veiled threat looms.

You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you handled the interloper?

==Completion==
Thank you for your aid. I am a great mind, but my acuity for combat is less impressive.

Still, if Ansurek's assassins have found me...

No. I cannot stop now. I have too much yet to do.

==Notes==
On accept, [[Unseen Blade Kesi'zir]] appears and attacks the adventurer:
:{{text|say|Unseen Blade Kesi'zir|For the queen!}}

On defeating Unseen Blade Kesi'zir:
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|So the royal assassins have come to skulk about... I have less than I realized.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|If Ansurek's assassins have sussed me out, then my identity is at risk. It may already be compromised.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|This cannot continue. I will need to think carefully on my next move, lest I become a liability-- both to the Threads and to Azj-Kahet's citizens.}}

==Progression==
{{Vizier's Resolve}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
*Name: Ascended Assassin

;Description
I imagine my influence among the residents of the [[Burrows]] will grow because I have provided them succor in their time of need. This will not go unnoticed by [[Ansurek]] and her court.

I expect their response will be swift and deadly. Handle that for me.
