==Objectives==
Place [[Betelsnax]] to lure bomb-laden beetles into destroying Nerubian Ballistae.
* [[Nerubian Ballista]]e destroyed (5)

==Description==
If we're gonna stop this invasion, we need to take out their big guns. In this case, big guns equals [[ballista]]e.

Remember how I had ya pick up them Betelsnax? Yeah, I didn't do that for no good reason. See, the [[nerubian]]s here have their beetles haul their bombs. And those haulers love them some snacks. I mean, who doesn't?

You place the snacks next to a ballista, then a bomb beetle walks up, and BOOM!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Those ballista ain't gonna destroy themselves, ya know?!

==Completion==
Couldn't have done it better myself. Well, maybe. Actually, probably.

But still, we got the job done and at the low-low price of an over-inflated bag of processed junk that who knows what's in it?

==Notes==
Upon destroying the first Nerubian Ballistae:
