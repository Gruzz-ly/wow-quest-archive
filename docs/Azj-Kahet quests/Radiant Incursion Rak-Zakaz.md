'''Radiant Incursion: Rak-Zakaz''' is one of three sureki daily quests offered by [[Mylton Wyldbraun]] at the [[Flame's Radiance]] base camp at [[Morgaen's Tears]] in southwestern [[Hallowfall]]. This quest takes place at [[Rak-Zakaz]] in northeastern [[Azj-Kahet]].

==Objectives==
Assist the [[Flame's Radiance]] and disrupt the Sureki forces at [[Rak-Zakaz]].
* Sureki Sympathizers disrupted (0/100%)

==Description==
The nerubian allies you and [[Faerin Lothar|Lady Faerin]] made in [[Azj-Kahet]] have proven resourceful... for now.

According to their intel, Sureki sympathizers have begun to rally at Rak-Zakaz and aid their fallen queen's loyalists in their renewed assaults.

Regroup with our forces at [[Faerin's Advance]] and cut off their reinforcements!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Confiscated Cultist's Bag]]
* 55 [[Resonance Crystals]]
* 5 [[Weathered Undermine Crest]]
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
* +200 reputation with [[Flame's Radiance]] (via [[Flame's Radiance (currency)]]), +100 for [[alt]]s

==Progress==
By disrupting operations at Raz-Zakaz, we cut off their reinforcements and discourage any sympathizers to their cause.

==Completion==
We're lucky to have you down here. 

Not so long ago, we Arathi dared not delve this far into Azj-Kahet. Yet, here we are.

Your actions in Rak-Zakaz should buy us a reprieve, and hopefully delay their next assault on the Aegis Wall.

==Notes==
Fill the bar by defeating or destroying:
* War Pheromone Defuser (7-8%)
* Sureki Shadecaster (5%)
* Sureki Communications (3%)
