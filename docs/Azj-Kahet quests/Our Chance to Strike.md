'''Our Chance to Strike''' begins the [[Nerub-ar Palace]] quest chain, unlocking [[Story Mode]] for the raid. To be offered this quest by [[Webster]] in [[Dornogal]], players must have first completed the [[The War Within (achievement)]] campaign through [[Return to Dornogal]]. Alts must instead have completed the first chapter of the max-level campaign, ending with [[Urban Odyssey]].

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Executor Nizrek|the Vizier]] at the [[Royal Apothecary]].

==Description==
<The child-like spider presents you with a sealed scroll. The sealed letter bears the markings of the Vizier.>

The balance of power is shifting in [[Azj-Kahet]]. [[Queen Ansurek|The Queen]] grows more unstable by the day and I fear we must act before our opportunity to stop her slips from our grasp. 

Meet me at the Royal Apothecary when you receive this letter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I would have rather sent my personal attendant to fetch you but the situation demands the utmost discretion.

==Progression==
{{Nerub-ar intro}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
