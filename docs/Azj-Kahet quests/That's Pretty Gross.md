'''That's Pretty Gross''' starts from the [[Familiar-Looking Appendage]], which drops from creatures in the [[Salien Gutters]] while on [[A Fin of Every Kind]] for an optional chapter of the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]].

==Objectives==
Bring Familiar-Looking Appendage back to [[Al'kubian]].
*[[Familiar-Looking Appendage]] given

==Description==
<You dislodge a familiar-looking appendage from the silt.

It doesn't seem particularly [[Kobyss]], but perhaps a unique specimen will earn you an increased reward from Al'kubian.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*5,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ooooh! What is this?

==Completion==
You are what you eat.

And these kobyss are eating the strongest nerubians ever evolved.

Don't mind the marks of moisture on the ground... That's my anxiety sweat.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Al'kubian]] once ready to turn in [[A Fin of Every Kind]]:
