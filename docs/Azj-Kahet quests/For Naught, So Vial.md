==Objectives==
Destroy 8 pieces of [[nerubian]] extracting equipment throughout the [[Breathing Pit]].
* [[Nerubian Extractor]] (8)

==Description==
Truthfully, I don't care what the nerubians are plotting. They are not the first upstart people seeking power, and they certainly won't be the last. The problem is how they're going about it. I fear that tampering with this [[Black Blood]] will threaten far more than the delicate ecosystems of [[Khaz Algar]].

We must make sure that they never return to this pit again. Their equipment is still strewn throughout the pit. Destroy as much of it as you can manage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The nerubians fled when those aberrations began appearing en masse, but I imagine they will try to come back for their ill-advised treasures. We need to make sure they have nothing to come back for.

==Completion==
<Orweyna scowls.>

The nerubians are a bold people, but this seems extreme, even for them.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|The Black Blood is dangerous. Especially in nerubian hands.}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|End their efforts here. I will meet you above... if you survive again.}}
:''Orweyna shifts to bat form and flies off.''

Kill a path to the surface, destroying [[Nerubian Extractor]]s along the way. Back on the surface:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|So you made it out alive. I knew I was right about you.}}
:''Four bats arrive and shift into [[haranir]]: [[Hannan]], [[Kai'shae]], [[Ney'leia]], and [[On'hiea]].''
:{{Text|say|On'hiea|You have shown your true form? Orweyna, this is forbidden!}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|The Black Blood spreads deeper every day. We need their aid--}}
:{{Text|say|On'hiea|We need nothing from them!}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|Enough!}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|We both know our charge. They are of this world. And they too seek to defend it.}}
:{{Text|say|Ney'leia|On'hiea, she speaks with the [[Radiant Song|song of the world]]. You know it, as do I.}}
:{{Text|say|On'hiea|The others will hear of this.}}
:{{Text|say|Ney'leia|At least it will not be the first tradition we have broken.}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|Go. All of you. I will join you soon.}}
:''The haranir turn back into bats and fly off again.''
