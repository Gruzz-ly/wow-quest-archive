==Objectives==
Speak to Ysabel and clear up the misunderstanding.
* Speak to [[Ysabel Gleamgaard|Ysabel]]
* [[Baer]] moved

==Description==
You understand that others lead lives different to your own. Our ways restrict us. Our traditions are not for the ears of strangers. I have only spoken to you at all due to [[Orweyna]]'s word. But I can feel [[On'hiea]]'s disapproval from here.

It is uncomfortable to have mysteries at times. It is why so many fear the dark. It is unknown.

I know I must seem cryptic. But our ways do not mean we are offended by the [[Arathi]]. They are creating tension where it does not exist for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can't leave my sister like this.

==Completion==
I can't believe this was just a simple misunderstanding. I shouldn't have made assumptions.

Thank you for easing my mind--and for helping my sister.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Ney'leia|Go. Tell your ally they may take what they need.}}

Return to Ysabel Gleamgaard:
{{dialogue|What did they say? Is there anything we can do to fix this rift between us?

{{gossip|quest=|Ney'leia says they are not offended.}}

{{dialogue-child|Wait. What? They aren't offended?

I was so afraid of making things worse!

Well, in that case... will you ask the creature to move, and I'll take the herbs I need?

{{gossip|Of course.}}
}}
}}
:{{text|say|Ysabel Gleamgaard|Just a little longer, Dae.}}

Go to [[Baer]]:
{{dialogue|<The creature is resting, but doesn't seem deeply asleep.>

{{gossip|quest=|Gently attempt to move the creature.}}

{{gossip|quest=|Excuse me, we need some herbs behind you. Do you mind moving so we can reach them?}}

{{gossip|quest=|MOVE!}}
}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Ysabel Gleamgaard|I'll be just a moment, Dae!}}
:{{text|say|Ysabel Gleamgaard|Sister? Are you all right?}}
:{{text|say|Daeyana Gleamgaard|Ysabel. Yes.}}
:{{text|say|Ney'leia|It is good you are well.}}
:{{text|say|Daeyana Gleamgaard|Thank you, friend. Who... are you?}}
:{{text|say|Ney'leia|I am Ney'leia. One of the haranir.}}
:{{text|say|Ysabel Gleamgaard|I... well, I suppose that's a start.}}

Ysabel has new gossip after:
{{dialogue|I have a feeling things will be looking brighter. I'm glad to have Dae back.

My sister may be healed, but she still needs rest. As for the... haranir? We will continue to watch our step and offer what we can. They did not need supplies.

Perhaps use of our transports would be appreciated instead. They deserve to be properly thanked for allowing us to stay.}}
