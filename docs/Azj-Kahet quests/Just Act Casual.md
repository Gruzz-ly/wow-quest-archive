==Objectives==
Help the convoy to exit [[Siegehold]] by speaking to the gatekeeper.
* Tell [[Monte Gazlowe|Gazlowe]] you're ready
* Speak to [[Siegehold Gateminder|the Gateminder]] {{co|48.2|25.4|Azj-Kahet}}
* Meet the convoy outside

==Description==
It's time to get outta here with the prisoners and those pheromones. I've found some convincing chains, since we have such a big group. Long as everybody stays in character, our chances look good.

We've only got General Anub'azal's marker scent goop for you and I, so we'll be the drones with permission. You do all the talkin', while I mind the cart. I hope this works.

Lead us through the gate, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Smuggled Nerubian Trousers]]
* [[Smuggled Nerubian Belt]]
* [[Smuggled Nerubian Boots]]
* [[Smuggled Nerubian Cuffs]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Let's take a quick breath. We didn't lose anyone, did we?

==Notes==
Speak with Gazlowe again:
{{dialogue|The grand escape plan is in motion!

Remember to stay in character: overworked and depressed about being on prisoner duty.

{{gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}}}
:''The convoy starts moving''
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|We'd better get moving. Remember, we're prisoners.}}
:{{text|say|Meerah|We could sing a song about how miserable we are.}}
:{{text|say|Katy Stampwhistle|Maybe not just yet, Meerah.}}
:{{text|say|High Arcanist Savor|Maybe not ever, Meerah.}}

The party stops by the [[Siegehold Gateminder]]:

{{dialogue|Where are you taking this prisoner group?

I was not expecting any transfers today!

{{gossip|quest=|I have General Anub'azal's pheromone mark on me, let us pass.}}}}
:{{text|say|Siegehold Gateminder|Wait... Are your orders from Zev'kall or Anub'azal?}}
:{{text|yell|Anub'azal|Who do you think, maggot?}}
:{{text|say|Siegehold Gateminder|But they look like--never mind! Go ahead! Don't report me!}}
:{{text|emote|Meerah holds her breath.}}
:{{text|say|Meerah|Are we out? Is it safe? Can I breathe?}}
:{{text|say|Katy Stampwhistle|We're out. Its safe. You can breathe.}}
:{{text|say|High Arcanist Savor|Keep holding it. For... science.}}
:{{text|say|Meerah|We're free! I could just... scream for joy!}}
:{{text|say|High Arcanist Savor|And call all those spiders over there down on our heads.}}
:{{text|say|Meerah|I don't want legs on my head!}}
:{{text|say|Katy Stampwhistle|Savor, you're not helping!}}

Several characters have gossip at this point:
{{dialogue|title=Siegehold Gateminder|Get back to work, drone.}}
{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|We're past the hard part, now.}}

At the meeting spot, many of the characters have new gossip:
{{dialogue|title=High Arcanist Savor|At this point, I just want a good nap.}}
{{dialogue|title=Aimee|I miss my pie cart.}}
{{dialogue|title=Babagahnoosh the Grumpy|I'm not sure this is much better than the place I was in. And I was trapped with an unwashed Jepetto!}}
{{dialogue|title=Uda the Beast|If I get out of this, these nerubians are going to be sorry.}}
Meerah's is the same as in [[Dalaran's Most Distressed]], but without further dialogue options:
{{dialogue|title=Meerah|I'll try my best to not look suspicious. Some o' these other guys are lookin' a little too happy about the rescue. though.}}
