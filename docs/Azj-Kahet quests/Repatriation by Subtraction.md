==Objectives==
Loot six Pillaged Trophies from the Royal Repository.
*Inconspicuous Crate investigated
*[[Pillaged Trophy]] (6)

==Description==
Ansurek and her ilk are so short-sighted. They think that by filling our museum with trophies of their recent conquests instead of relics of our own history, we will be less inclined to remember where we came from.

Well, they are probably right--in the long term, at least. History has a habit of bending towards the voice of its teller.

But that is where we come in, <name>. Those relics that the Sureki forces stole? It's time to steal them back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, <name>? I'm sure the place is filled with a queen's ransom.

==Completion==
<Ar'syn's many eyes sparkle in the cavelight.>

Though my goals today are on the philanthropic side of things, I must profess my appreciation for a good heist well-executed. Look at all of these treasures! I do so look forward to returning them to their rightful homes.

...For a finder's fee, of course. Imagine if Azj-Kahet's legendary legerdemain became some sort of folk hero?! Ugh, the very word sours on my tongue.

==Notes==
On accept of both Educate Yourself and Repatriation by Subtraction:
:{{text|say|Ar'syn|And so the heist begins! This ought to be a great deal of fun.}}
:{{text|say|Ar'syn|Those crates in front of the entranceway should be your best bet in terms of access. I shall meet you within.}}

On interaction with the Inconspicuous crate, you will be transported inside by a [[Sureki Hauler]]. Ar'ysn will be in the shadows when you arrive:
:{{text|say|Ar'syn|Ah, there's my delivery now. Congratulations on a most excellent infiltration, <name>.}}

Ar'syn has gossip text:
{{Dialogue|
Don't get me wrong, dead, I'm not some overly saccharine do-gooder. Thievery is my passion, not just a means to an end.

It just so happens that I am ALSO a student of history. So why not do a little public service alongside my usual skullduggery?
