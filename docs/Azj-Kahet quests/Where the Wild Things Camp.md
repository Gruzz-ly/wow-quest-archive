==Objectives==
Meet [[Orweyna]] at [[Wildcamp Ul'ar]].

==Description==
Some of my people found a few [[haranir]] setting up one of their camps to the southwest. They were missing some vital supplies, so my people offered to help out. However, I worry about how they're all getting along over there.

Could you check in on them? Make sure we're being good hosts to the haranir... and that nobody has inadvertently offended anyone. Please.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You again. Curious.
