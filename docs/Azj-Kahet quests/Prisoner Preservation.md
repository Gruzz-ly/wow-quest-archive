The beasts took our people! Dragged them away when we were gettin' our first rest since our escape!

* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Survivin' ain't easy but we gotta keep pushin' on.

==Completion==
You did all you could. I am in your debt. We be honorin' Jeti's memory by dealing with da nest.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Great Hexer Ohodo|Da spored beasts are no joke. Keep on your toes and clear them out. Dat will help with our future endeavours.}}
:{{text|say|Great Hexer Ohodo|I can only hope our mission expedition members are still alive. Be swift and tink quickly. Good luck.}}

The characters are marked on the minimap. From north to south are [[Jeti Amberhoof]], [[Drog Skullbreaker]], [[Aemara]], and [[Mimbihi]]:
{{dialogue|title=Jeti Amberhoof|<The tauren's body appears to have multiple claw marks. Fungal spores cover his body.>}}
:{{text|say|Drog Skullbreaker|Ugh, my skull! You have my thanks, friend. I will meet you back at Faerin's Advance.}}
:{{text|say|Aemara|You have my thanks, friend--any longer out here and the beasts would have ripped me to shreds!}}
:{{text|say|Mimbihi|Thank ya. I be seein' ya back in camp.}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Drog Skullbreaker|As I was dragged through the Pillar-nest I caught a glimpse of fungarians inside the cave. They were riddling those beasts with spores! The same spores that cloud around them all.}}
:{{text|say|Aemara|Did anyone else see a large fungarian? There was a huge one planting spore pods around the cave. Perhaps that was their leader?}}
:{{text|say|Mimbihi|I didn't see any big fungarians, but I did see Jeti make a run for it. One of da fungal spore pods popped near him. He didn't make it...}}
:{{text|say|Great Hexer Ohodo|Fungarians... no wonder dere be all those spores afflictin' da Pillar-nest. The fungal spore pods and dat large fungarian are what we should be worryin' about.}}
