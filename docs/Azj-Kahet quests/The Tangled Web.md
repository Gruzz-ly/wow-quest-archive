'''The Tangled Web''' ends the first chapter of the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]] alongside [[A Seeming Respite]]. The next chapter begins immediately after with [[The Weaver's Gift]].

==Objectives==
Peruse the Weaver's archives.
* Learn about [[the Weaver]]
* Learn about the [[Sureki]] forces
* Learn about [[Ascended nerubian|the ascended]]
* Learn about [[Queen Ansurek|the Queen]]'s allies

==Description==
Make no mistake--I have no intention of sending you off to skitter about in the dark like a freshly-hatched beetle. It wouldn't do to have my little morsel snatched up by a starving cave borer.

You must educate yourself, my dear. Your allies have found themselves ensconced in a torrid tapestry. Only by familiarizing yourself with its erstwhile architects can you hope to reclaim them.

Luckily for you, I have made some of my personal resources available to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|17|55}}
* 8,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Haven't you finished yet? Really, the archives' design is quite elegant. Just tap and listen. Even a spindly thing like you can figure it out, I am sure.

==Completion==
Now you see how the stage has been set. You have arrived in the middle of the play, I fear--but you needn't worry! You've time yet to play a most vital role.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Widow Arak'nai]] again:

{{dialogue|Iki'tash izal, little morsel. I hope you find the accommodations here to your taste.

{{gossip|quest=|Tell me about yourself.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|I am the Widow Arak'nai. For many years, I officially served as the Royal Weaver to [[Queen Neferess]]. Unofficially, I pursued a variety of... additional interests.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|But now my beloved queen is dead, and her daughter has been led astray by a so-called "[[Xal'atath|Harbinger]]." I will not allow this creature to usurp [[Azj-Kahet (kingdom)|our great kingdom]] for her own ends... But I cannot stop her alone.}}
{{gossip|quest=|Tell me about the enemy forces.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|This Harbinger has the entirety of Azj-Kahet's military at her disposal.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Before her arrival, General [[Anub'azal]] led the kingdom's forces. Ansurek deposed him in favor of one of the Harbinger's pet Ascended, and now the army's ranks teem with those corrupted wretches.}}
{{gossip|quest=|Tell me about the Ascended.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|The Ascended are the Harbinger's gift to Ansurek. A fierce contingent of violent hunter-killers, made by the Harbinger in the darkest depths of the city's Transformatory.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|They are impossibly strong, and I have no army of my own. If I am to reach Ansurek and dispose of the Harbinger, then I will need to find a way to subvert her military might from within.}}
{{gossip|quest=|Tell me about the Queen's inner circle.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Even if we do not engage the Harbinger directly, a more subtle approach will prove equally as difficult. What I need is an ally in Ansurek's inner circle. Someone who can come and go without suspicion.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|The denizens of the Burrows speak of a 'Vizier'. Some manner of patriot who works from within the queen's walls. He would do nicely... If only I knew his identity.}}
{{gossip|Do you know where my allies are?}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Worry not, little morsel. I am well aware that you did not come down here alone. I've already sent my weave-rats to track down your compatriots.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Consider it a gesture of good faith... And, with luck, the start of a long and mutually beneficial relationship.}}
{{gossip|How did you know where to find me?}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|I specialize in little pushes, dear. Every plan is a tapestry, and I am adept at nudging and tugging just one thread at a time. You, though, are less of a tugged thread and more of a lit match.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|The Harbinger's shadowy venom has stained Ansurek's tapestry. That is why I sought you out. I require a stray ember, and you need a friend in the dark.}}

As she talks, [[Shadecaster Projection]]s appear.
