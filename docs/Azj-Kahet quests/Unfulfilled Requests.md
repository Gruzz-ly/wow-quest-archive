==Objectives==
Meet with [[Sum'latha]] at the [[Silken Ward]].

==Description==
I have heard the citizens of the Silken Ward are having trouble with a group of ascended called the [[Pale Weavelashers]].

The new ward is supposed to be a fresh start for citizens of the capital, at least that is the way the Queen tells it. In actuality it is a way for her to tighten her grip on those she doesn't trust.

Meet with my assistant Sum'latha. I sent her there ahead of time to gather information. She can fill you in on any details.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You must be the help [[Executor Nizrek|the Vizier]] sent. Welcome to the Silken Ward.

==Progression==
