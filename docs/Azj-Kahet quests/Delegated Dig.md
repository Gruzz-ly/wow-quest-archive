==Objectives==
Acquire 25 Chunks of Sivstone.
* [[Sivstone Chunk]] (25)

==Description==
Okay, I know when I'm beat. So I want to hire you as my Champion of Coin... or coinchamp.

This is all a part of my brilliant enterprising venture. See, these [[Jawcrawler|worms]] here are great at rooting out rich minerals like a [[niffen]] sniffing out high-quality mushrooms.

I'm willing to bet all of my money--and your life--that they found a vein of sivstone. Great stuff, though I doubt a <class> would know how to use it.

Tell you what, you bring me a shipment's worth and I'll go halfsies on the profits with ya!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You get the goods?

==Completion==
Nice haul! This should get us started back in [[Mmarl]] and show those goons who's who.

Here's your cut.

==Notes==
Sivstone Deposits are in the smaller caves. Each deposit contains 4-7x [[Sivstone Chunk]].
