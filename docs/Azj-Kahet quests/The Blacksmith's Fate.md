==Objectives==
Assist [[Faerin Lothar]] to uncover the fate of [[Ryton Blackholme]].
* [[Sir Ashrealm|Survivor]] found
* [[Mother Aza'na]] slain
* [[Anub'ilith]] slain
* [[Blacksmith's Breastplate]]

==Description==
While we're here, I must find out what happened to my old friend, Ryton Blackholme. He was [[Hallowfall]]'s finest [[Smith|blacksmith]]--and he was taken in a surprise [[nerubian]] attack. I could not save him.

I searched for him, but found nothing except for his bloodied helm. I'd given up hope. But recently, I heard rumor about a blacksmith from a survivor who'd been pulled down off the [[Aegis Wall]].

Could it be Ryton? Will you help me, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Thank you for your help with this, <name>.

==Completion==
I can't believe Ryton is really gone, but it means the world to finally know what happened to my dear friend.

We will honor him as soon as we've dealt with Zev'kall's monstrosity.

==Notes==
Upon accept Faerin and Gazlowe start following you:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Be on the lookout for any clues to Ryton's fate.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|We'll keep our eyes peeled.}}

Upon approaching [[Sir Ashrealm]]:
:{{text|emote|Sir Ashrealm coughs weakly.}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|Survivor over there!}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Is he still alive, <name>?}}

{{gossip|quest=|She's here with me. We are looking for the blacksmith Ryton Blackholme. Have you seen him?}}
{{dialogue-child|Blacksmith? Yes... yes. But not...

{{gossip|quest=|Is this blacksmith still alive?}}
{{dialogue-child|Long ago... either the Ascended mother... or crypt lord...

{{gossip|quest=|Sir? Sir?}}

:''Sir Ashrealm dies.''
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|No... Beledar shine upon you.}}

Depending on the order they are confronted [[Mother Aza'na]] and [[Anub'ilith]] have different dialogues. If Mother Aza'na is confronted first:
:{{text|say|Mother Aza'na|The one-armed Lamplighter. How novel.}}

:Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Mother Aza'na|Anub'ilith will be... your end...}}

:Anub'ilith:
:{{text|say|Anub'ilith|We know you, Faerin Lothar. Come, little spark. Retrieve what remains of your blacksmith if you can.}}

:Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Anub'ilith|Slain by a peasant. He did not die well, little spark...}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Damn, Ryton's tinderbox isn't here. The breastplate will have to do. Thank you, <name>.}}

If Anub'ilith is confronted first:
:{{text|say|Anub'ilith|As with so many others, we will extinguish your flame, Lamplighter.}}

:Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Anub'ilith|An ignoble death...}}

:Mother Aza'na:
:{{text|say|Mother Aza'na|You are notorious, Faerin. Come to find your friend or perhaps your own demise?}}

:Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Mother Aza'na|Take your prize and... despair, Lamplighter...}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Damn, Ryton's tinderbox isn't here. The breastplate will have to do. Thank you, <name>.}}
