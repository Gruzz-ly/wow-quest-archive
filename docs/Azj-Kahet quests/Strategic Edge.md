==Objectives==
Find [[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]]'s Blades and 3 nerubian intel from [[Kaheti]] forces in [[Rak-Zakaz]].
* [[Flynn's Blades]] {{co|66.5|31.4|Azj-Kahet}}
* Nerubian Intelligence (3)

==Description==
To add insult to injury, they disarmed me. I'm not leaving without those blades!

While we're looking, keep an eye out for any evidence of what's going on here. Anything that could give us an advantage against the nerubians.

Something strange happened that provided us the opening to escape. I have a feeling that could be something we can exploit.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of:
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Borers]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Crossbow]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Spade]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Dirk]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Lantern]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Buckler]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Mallet]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Hatchet]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Staff]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Knife]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Sword]]
* [[Kaheti Confiscated Blade]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There must be something around here of value to the Weaver...

==Completion==
This seems like enough to trade to the Weaver for that antidote. Anub'azal is a good lead to investigate. Maybe he'll barter like the Weaver did, and we'll get something even better from him.

It sounds like a good risk to me.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I need my weapons. And something for this Weaver so she'll give me an antidote. Since I like being alive.}}

Some [[Military Correspondence]] contains [[Orders From Siegehold]]:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Looks like my fellow prisoners escaping was no coincidence. And these orders came from a nerubian. Anub'azal...}}

On a higher layer, a [[Vial of Used Pheromones]] can be looted from a [[Crate of Emptied Vials]]:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Seems that Zev'kall fellow we saw is getting... pheromones sent to him? From a general. No idea what that means, though.}}

A rack of Confiscated Weapons in the closed-off area to the southeast has [[Flynn's Blades]]:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ah, I'll take those. Feeling more like myself already!}}
:''Flynn equips his swords.''

To the northeast in the closed-off area, a [[Kaheti Threadmancer]] is standing on a [[Burning Venom Flask]]:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ah, I am well acquainted with that particular bottle of venom. Unfortunately...}}

==Beta==
;Progress
There must be something around here that can give us an edge against the nerubians...

;Completion
This seems like enough to trade to the Weaver for that antidote. Anub'azal is a good lead to investigate. There's something here, I'm sure of it.
