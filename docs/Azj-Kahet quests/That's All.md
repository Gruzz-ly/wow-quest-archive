==Objectives==
Deliver the Secret-Woven Silk to [[Widow Arak'nai|the Weaver]] in [[Weaver's Lair|her lair]].
*[[Secret-Woven Silk]] (provided)

==Description==
It will be interesting to see how all this unfolds... but knowing the Weaver, I'm sure she has some strings to pull to make it go her way.

This is the secret I was trying to pass to her when things started heating up. Why don't you deliver it to her, as a sign of a job well done?

I'm sure she'll be pleased to know that she continues to have a set of eyes in [[Rak-Ahat]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Aha, I admit I hadn't expected to receive this.

<The Weaver runs her pedipalps over the secret-woven silk, delighted.>

Very interesting. I will have to keep this in mind.
