==Objectives==
"Advertise" the Debugger Hat by hitting Noth swarmites with it outside of [[Mmarl]].
* Debugger Hat Tests (15)
* [[Debugger Hat]] (provided)

==Description==
You wanna help the [[Venture Company]]? And you don't mind being disposable?

Okay, listen up. When we moved in here, there were no monsters in town. But now we're finding dead workers, chewed up. It's bad for business.

Fortunately, I've got a way to make money off this--an electrocution helmet. I call it my Debugger Hat.

Take the latest model for a test run outside town. Kill the bugs. The [[niffen]] will see you, see that Debugger Hat at work, and know its got good reviews.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It oughta just kill 'em, but who knows? You might see other results, too.

==Completion==
So it had some extra effects? Great! The hype is real! What exposure! The orders will be pouring in!

You ever consider becoming a walking advertisement? Could have a bright future in making cash for me. For now, here's your wages.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Three vials. I won't pay any more!}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|Four.}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Done.}}

While out and about, zapping bugs:
*{{text|say|Impressionable Niffen|That hat is super effective!}}
*{{text|say|Impressionable Niffen|I need one of those hats. I hope they don't sell out...}}

On complete, Grigg runs in:
:{{text|say|Grigg|Jenni! Swimmers just saw bugs at the swimming pool!}}
