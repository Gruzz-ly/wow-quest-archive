==Objectives==
Hand out 3 Arathi Rations.
* [[Arathi Rations]] distributed (3)

==Description==
We found these prisoners fleeing a nearby nerubian military base.

The circumstances of their escape are... unclear, even to them. As if someone else created the opening they needed to escape.

They need rest, but we need to find out what happened in there.

Food first. Maybe once they've regained some of their strength, they'll remember something.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We managed to throw together a simple stew of sorts. It's not the tastiest, but it has to be better than whatever they had to eat in spider prison.

==Completion==
These people have been through so much. Civilians--not even soldiers. Most of them didn't sign up for this. And yet they became prisoners of war.

If anything back at the nerubian base could give us an advantage, we have to take it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|A meal should offer some strength and comfort, after all they've been through.}}

Place down a bowl of Arathi Rations next to [[Cataloger Coralie]], [[Pathfinder Jeb]], and [[Fialla Sweetberry]], who are being tended to by [[Regald Hornfyre]]:
:{{text|say|Cataloger Coralie|The guards near us were arguing about "new orders." Then they just... walked off.}}

{{dialogue|title=Cataloger Coralie|I joined the Dragonscale Expedition for adventure. To be the first to research the flora and fauna of new lands and document as much as I could.

So being down here... it's the opportunity of a lifetime!

To think, all this time, entire civilizations existed just beneath the surface--oh, if only my camera hadn't broken!}}

To the southwest are [[Archivist Betha]], [[Coira Longrifle]], and [[Breanni]]:
:{{text|say|Archivist Betha|A solvent was knocked over and dissolved the webbing of our cages. How fortunate!}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Floid Mayslord]]|This isn't the first time the nerubians have struck civilians.

We're lucky so many were taken captive. When it comes to our people, they don't tend to take prisoners.

Which leaves me wondering, why? Why take civilians? Merchants? Scholars?}}

To the north, [[Arluelle]] of the Nightfallen is tending to [[Ol' Toomba]], [[Richard Hatstock]], and [[Earthmender Narvra]]:
:{{text|say|Richard Hatstock|One man insisted on staying behind. Finn? Frynn? Might want to get the madman before the venom does.}}

{{dialogue|title=Arluelle|A brief visit to Dalaran turned into... this.

Yet I cannot help but feel I am meant to be here, somehow. I have seen corruption, opulence, and the atrocities they wreak before.

I will do what I can to help. I must tend to the wounded and lend an understanding ear. They will get through this, as we did before.

Well... not all of us. But the survivors must press on with hope. Always.}}

Off to the west, [[Great Hexer Ohdo]] starts two optional quests: [[Infested Infestation]], [[Prisoner Preservation]].
