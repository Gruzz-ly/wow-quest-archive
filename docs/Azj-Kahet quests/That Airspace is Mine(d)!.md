==Objectives==
Fly through 5 nerubian mines while under the effects of Holy Lance.
* Nerubian Silk Baloon Mine slain (5)

==Description==
Our advantage is air superiority. The [[nerubian]]s are threatening that with their mines.

Your mount is more maneuverable than our skiffs. Get in the air and take those mines out.

I will deploy what resources I can to provide you some blessings to improve your capabilities.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Our [[priest]]s are powerful with the [[Light]] but lack the air speed you and your resources can achieve.

==Completion==
Well done. The right weapon for the right front.

==Notes==
Fly through an [[Arathi War Priest]]'s gold ring for a 10-second Holy Lance buff:
:{{abilities|Holy Lance|Can destroy nerubian mines.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Fly through the rings to temporarily gain Holy Lance.}}

Then fly through the mines, which would normally knock players out of the air if not buffed.

==Progression==
{{The Second Front}}
