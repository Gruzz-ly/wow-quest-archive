Start by talking to [[Ghos'opp]] on the cliff overlooking the [[Salien Gutters]]:
{{dialogue|The Vizier requires a certain selection of ocular organs for his most recent experiments. However, as is his habit, he has a variety of... specifications.

The eyeballs of kobyss become swollen when they emerge from teh water for extended periods. His eminence would like you to harvest eyes from freshly slain kobyss that have swollen to precisely one-and-a-quarter size.

Do not measure incorrectly. The Vizier detests incorrect measurements.

{{gossip|Understood.}}}}

The eyeballs can drop from any [[kobyss]] in the Salien Gutters.
