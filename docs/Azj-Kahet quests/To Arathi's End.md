==Objectives==
Regroup with [[Faerin]] and [[Gazlowe]] at [[Arathi's End]].

==Description==
We will regroup on the outskirts of Arathi's End to the east.

Their forces are nearly ready and there isn't much time, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You made it. Now let's see if we can make a dent in these [[nerubian]]s and save [[Hallowfall]].

I can already taste the rewards!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|There's no time to waste. See you there, <name>.}}

Faerin and Gazlowe mount up and head off:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Last one there's a poor, wet fuse!}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Hey! Wait up!}}

Upon reaching them:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Keep low! You want us to get caught before we even start?}}

==Progression==
{{All Good Things...}}
