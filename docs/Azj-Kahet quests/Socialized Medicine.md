==Objectives==
Dose Downtrodden Residents with Nizrek's potion.
* [[Downtrodden Resident]] dosed (6)
* [[Nizrek's potion]] (provided)

==Description==
It has come to my attention that the most downtrodden residents of the Burrows have fallen prey to some sort of malady.

Take this potion and dose the sick. This will strengthen the citizens and curtail further outbreak.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you aided the residents of the Burrows?

==Completion==
I will not allow their suffering.

==Notes==
Downtrodden Residents when dozed with Nizrek's potion say one of these lines:
:{{text|say|Downtrodden Resident|Is this from the Vizier? Ah, we can always count on him.}}
:{{text|say|Downtrodden Resident|Give the Vizier my thanks! The Sureki are driving up the prices of even simple cures!}}
:{{text|say|Downtrodden Resident|...Oh! I did not melt OR explode. How lucky.}}

==Progression==
{{Vizier's Resolve}}
