==Objectives==
Locate [[Albert]]'s friends in the walls.
* [[Lost Companion]] checked (5)

==Description==
Who is there? Someone? Did I imagine you?

I am Albert. I was a Pathfinder once. Now that I'm blind, I see no path. It seems wrong to call myself [[Pathfinder Henson]]. I can hear, though. I can hear them eating. They eat the fresh parts.

My eyes. My insides.

It hurts all the time. They do not want my rotten pieces. The decayed parts are all I have left. The worst of me.

I wasn't alone here, I had fellow Pathfinders. I keep hearing sobbing from the walls. Do you hear them too?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
They are dead, then...

Upon meeting back with Albert:
{{Dialogue|
It feels like my hair is tickling my neck.

But I know I don't have hair anymore.

{{gossip|You have spiders on you, Albert.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
DO I?

WHERE?!

{{Gossip|Never mind.}}
