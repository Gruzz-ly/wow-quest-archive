==Objectives==
Speak with [[Mmarl]]'s leader about recruiting swarmhands.

==Description==
You alone are no longer sufficient. We require additional help.

The jawcrawlers and threadlings also need oversight.

The [[niffen]] settlement, Mmarl, is not far. Past forced conscription attempts have failed. [[Nerubian]]s are now forbidden within the city.

We need someone to communicate in our stead.

Go and barter with the rats. Come back with able bodies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The nerubians want our help again? I'd like to hear this...

==Notes==

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
