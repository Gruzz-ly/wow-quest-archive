==Description==
<The [[nerubian]] keeps her voice low, a careful eye on the guards behind you.>

The Weaver sent you, yes? I arrived to petition the Magistrate's approval for Ascension--to infiltrate high society, of course.

But he's missing. A rather large inconvenience in the plan.

I need to ask around. You're just what I've been waiting for! You may pretend to be my... servant. Pet? Whatever makes it more palatable to you.

I so rarely get to work alongside a friend. We will have fun together, fellow [[spy]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have a few old friends who recently Ascended. Surely, one of them has heard something they would be willing to share. For old time's sake.

And if not, maybe jealousy in seeing my fashionable new pet will inspire them to offer up what they know.

==Completion==
I knew Ascension changed people, but... They were my friends. And now, they don't even want to be seen with me.

It makes me wonder... if I succeed in all this, will I even still be myself?

<Tx'itk shakes her head.>

It doesn't matter. I'll do what needs to be done.

==Notes==
Upon approaching Orator Tx'itk at the [[Magistrate's Office]]:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Ah, there you are! Our patron sent you to help me find the Magistrate, yes?}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|The Magistrate is the key to my Ascension.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|My old friends may have heard something about his disappearance. Let's ask around.}}

Meet with Tx'itk in the [[High Hollows]] who has gossip:
{{dialogue|High Elevator Etak'kaht, the Magistrate of the High Hollows, will be able to pull the necessary strings to grant me Ascension.

Assuming I can earn his favor.

<All of Tx'itk's eyes squint in mild irritation.>

... Assuming we can find him.

{{gossip|Why do I have to pretend to be your servant?}}

{{dialogue-child|The High Hollows is extremely exclusive. Truly, friend, consider yourself lucky to get to explore so freely. The Ascended who live in this district are not fond of either of us, to say the least.

Everyone here values others by measure of use. Status. Wealth. With you as my servant, I can appear intriguing. After all, I must be affluent and well-connected indeed, to have acquired such an... "exotic pet," as they will likely view you.

Try to take it as a compliment. You're a magnificent status symbol.

And as for you, it's preferable that everyone views you as my strange little servant. Alongside me, they will not view you as their own yet unclaimed bounty.

Or at least, they won't be so tactless in acting on it.}}}}

Talk to [[Profiteer Z'kaxt]]:
{{dialogue|Interesting creature. Are you for sale? How much?

{{gossip|quest=|Ask for rumors about the Magistrate.}}}}

:{{text|say|Profiteer Z'kaxt}What could you possibly have to offer me in exchange for this information, Tx'itk? I cannot help you.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Ascension has changed you, I see. Come, <name>. Let's ask someone else.}}

One can investigate the nearby [[Kobyss Puppet]]:
{{dialogue|A cruel sort of irony, to depict an aquatic creature in a state of drowning. The teeth look sharp enough to tear your skin, the gills revealing a delicate membrane.

With such careful detail and accurate textures, the cost of this vicious art display must be immense.

{{gossip|quest=|Investigate the puppet.}}}}
:{{text|say|Profiteer Z'kaxt|I paid a sum your simple mind could not fathom to get my hands on an original puppet by the Puppetmaster.}}

Next follow Tx'itk to the [[Memories of Conquest]] where they can be seen talking to [[Tok]]:
{{dialogue|I cannot be seen with the likes of you. Ix'klik is far too generous with who she allows in here.

Say what you will then get out of my sight before someone notices.

{{gossip|quest=|Ask for rumors about the Magistrate.}}}}
:{{text|say|Tox|I heard a rumor the Magistrate received an invitation to one of the Puppetmaster's shows.}}
:{{text|say|Tox|It's incredibly exclusive. The likes of you would never be permitted.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|I did not recall you being so elitist, old friend. I won't offend you with my presence again.}}

One can investigate the nearby [[Arathi Puppet]]:
{{dialogue|The desperation of the Arathi woman represented feels so authentic, surely the artist behind this display had a real life model to use as a basis.

There is such attention to detail that you'd swear you can even see the pores on the puppet's skin.

{{gossip|quest=|Investigate the puppet.}}}}
:{{text|say|Tox|The Puppetmaster's originals have become a status symbol. Everyone of import is trying to get their hands on one.}}

Next go to [[Ascended Solutions]] and talk to [[Van'atka]]:
{{dialogue|You are not welcome here.

Has the Orator pulled strings for you, overcrawler? I am shocked she has enough influence to get away with it.

{{gossip|quest=|Ask for rumors about the Puppetmaster.}}}}
:{{text|say|Van'atka|I hear even the Magistrate was put on the waitlist for an original piece by the Puppetmaster. So you shouldn't even bother.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|I'll try not to be too heartbroken that I'm not worthy of being on the waitlist for a puppet.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Come along, <name>. There's one other person we can ask.}}

One can investigate the nearby [[Earthen Puppet]]:
{{dialogue|The Earthen puppet is frozen in a state of despair, with detail work as fine as the craftsmanship behind the real Earthen you've encountered above.

The stone texture of this piece looks identical to that of real Earthen.

{{gossip|quest=|Investigate the puppet.}}}}
:{{text|say|Van'atka|A gift, I'm proud to say. The Puppetmaster is a frequent patron and wanted to express his gratitude.}}

Next go talk to [[Duelist Kahtex]]:
{{dialogue|Kahtex keeps glancing at the puppet. He seems unnerved.

{{gossip|quest=|Ask for rumors about the Puppetmaster.}}}}

:{{text|say|Duelist Kahtex|The Puppetmaster's workshop is nearby. Don't disturb him. He only bothers with things of value--those of us with station.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Indeed, I've heard he's the latest fad you all use to declare you're better than everyone else.}}

One can investigate the nearby [[Nerubian Puppet]]:
{{dialogue|An unsettling display, to see such graphic art depicting a nerubian in the throes of death in their own city.

The Ascended nearby seem mostly unbothered by the display. Mostly.

{{gossip|quest=|Investigate the puppet.}}}}
:{{text|say|Duelist Kahtex|This horrific display of twisted art is a threat. Only a matter of time before Ascended puppets start popping up.}}
