==Objectives==
Continue your efforts in aiding the Weaver in [[Azj-Kahet]].
* Purchase a map from [[Yamas the Provider]]

==Description==
The Weaver's many eyes lurk throughout the city, learning as much as they can about [[Ansurek]]'s machinations.

Still, intelligence enough will not be sufficient to turn the tide against the [[Sureki]] forces. The Weaver requires someone willing to get their hands dirty.

Lucky you, I suppose.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 18,300 [[XP]]
*[[The Weaver's Gratuity]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
Chk-chaah! You return at least{{sic}}. What news of the city do you bring me, hrm?

==Completion==
You have big talent for causing good trouble! Good good!

Take these!
