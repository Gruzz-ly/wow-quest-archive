==Objectives==
Use a Rak-Ush Stagshell to find 5 [[Kaheti]] truffles.
* Speak to [[Aromash]] (optional)
* Select a stagshell
* [[Kaheti Truffle]]s (5)

==Description==
The stagshells are of the utmost importance to [[Anub'azal]]'s war campaign.

They alone are able to seek out valuable Kaheti truffles. Even with our keen sense of smell, only the stagshells can sense the fungus.

Kaheti truffles are a key ingredient in several... explosive elixirs, as it were.

If you desire details, Aromash can inform you.

However, you are better suited for the task.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need an abundance of truffles to ensure we are properly prepared.

==Completion==
That is all that is required of you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kish'nal|Once again, Aromash can provide more detailed instructions, should this task prove too complicated for you.}}

Kaheti Truffles?

They're highly prized by Nerubians. They form the basis of several explosive elixirs.

Stagshells are one of the few creatures that can smell them.

When they're not being used as weapons, they are quite tasty. Watch out for competition from the local wildlife!

Go ahead and select one of the stagshells, and it'll follow you out into the field and sniff some up for ya.

They're quite well-trained.}}}}

Pick a beetle, then head northwest into the field and interact with [[Volatile Soil]] to have the beetle dig up a [[Volatile Kaheti Truffle]]. Be warned that looting the truffle will cause it to explode and deal ~20% health as damage!
