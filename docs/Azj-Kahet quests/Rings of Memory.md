==Objectives==
Bring Goehi's Root to [[Wild Camp Or'lay]].
* [[Goehi's Root]]

==Description==
I appreciate what you have done. Do not worry--I am not finished yet.

If you please, take this root to those who sent you. They can read the history of my life within the rings of wood therein. My life is one of many in the tapestry, but we are all intertwined.

These strangers you encountered may be reclusive--secretive even--but they understand this tapestry like no other, and guard it with their lives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the ancients?

==Completion==
Goehi sent this root, yet was still alive...

I understand. His story is safe with us.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Goehi|Your new acquaintances are worth more than you know, stranger. Take care with them.}}

==Progression==
