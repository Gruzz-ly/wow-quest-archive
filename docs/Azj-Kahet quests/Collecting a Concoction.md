==Objectives==
Collect 8 Brightshade Potions in the [[Whispering Cliffs]].
* [[Brightshade Potion]]s collected (8)

==Description==
The Pale Weavelashers did indeed throw my alchemical supply down the cliff side. The potions will give the citizens of the [[Silken Ward]] the edge they need to rise up.

I need someone to go down the Whispering Cliffs and collect any bottles that haven't broken open. I would go myself but the [[kobyss]] have made the area a hunting ground and I'm no fighter.

This would be a simple task for one such as yourself, eh?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The kobyss are beyond a nuisance. I need to get my Brightshade Potions back.

==Completion==
I hope you got my Brightshade Potions, eh? Without them I've got nothing left.

==Notes==
Look for a [[Crate of Alchemical Potions]] or eight down at water level.

==Progression==
{{Silken Ward}}
