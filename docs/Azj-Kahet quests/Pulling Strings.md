==Objectives==
Confront [[The Puppetmaster]] to rescue [[High Elevator Etak'kaht]].
*[[Meet Orator Tx'itk]] at the [[Puppetmaster's Theater]]
*Talk to Orator Tx'itk
*Listen to the Puppetmaster's greeting 
*Puppet slain (12)

==Description==
Just think of it! Overcrawlers, war prisoners, civilians, fellow [[nerubian]]s, important nobility being kidnapped and turned into puppets right under the Magistrate's nose.

It's horrific--and exactly what I needed! If we save the Magistrate from this fate, he'll owe me. Not just for saving his life, but to keep quiet about all this.

We're off to the theater, then. If you can keep The Puppetmaster occupied, I'll free High Elevator Etak'kaht from his grasp.

Hopefully he's not part of the show yet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm thrilled. There couldn't have been a more perfect opportunity to get the Magistrate's attention. And the [[Widow Arak'nai|Weaver]] will be pleased to hear we have him in our pocket indefinitely, with this blackmail situation.

Now, I suppose I'm off to the [[Transformatory]].

<Tx'itk shudders subtly.>

I... I must not let my resolve falter now. The Weaver has asked this of me. I will be her eyes.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|We have to rescue the Magistrate before he has any more of that paralytic. He won't be able to grant me Ascension if he's a puppet.}}

Go to the [[Puppet Theater]], [[Zil'kra]] the ticket attendant has gossip:
{{dialogue|So you're the one he's been waiting for.

He so loves to exaggerate, but I suppose there's something charming in seeing the beauty in mundane things.

Go on. Enjoy the show...}}

Inside the theater one can talk to the people attending:
{{dialogue|title=Undercover Art Critic|I have been impressed with the Puppetmaster's work thus far, but it will rapidly go stale. My latest review made that much clear.

What was initially a daring new depiction of the power uniquely held by the Ascended risks reduction to commonplace puppetry.

If he does not wow me soon with something fresh, his reputation will suffer for it. Your presence in his theater does not bode}}

{{dialogue|title=Theater Steward|Shoo, overcrawler!

Refreshments are only for honored guests. Certainly not for servants.}}

{{dialogue|title=Invited Guest|Ah, how lifelike! I never cease to be impressed by the Puppetmaster's work. Your movements are so fluid I almost thought you were real for a moment!}}

{{dialogue|title=Invited Guest|I heard a rumor he's debuting a new puppet in the next performance... I wonder what sort of creature it could be.}}

{{dialogue|title=Invited Guest|I have attended many of the Puppetmaster's shows, each better than the last. Only recently did he debut the nerubian puppets. While initially shocking, I must admit, I admire the boldness of such a statement.

It was too much for some. Audience members walked out of that show, I recall. Pathetic.

But if I'm being honest, I heard a rumor that he's... slipping. Desperate for attention, doing increasingly outrageous things just to stay relevant.

I've even heard he's pandering to the Magistrate now.}}

{{dialogue|title=Invited Guest|How... charming to see you here. Did I receive an invitation to a charity show by mistake?}}

{{dialogue|title=Invited Guest|I hope tonight's show is as bloody as the last.}}

{{dialogue|title=Invited Guest|How did you get in here?

If you received an invitation... well, now, I don't want to say the Puppetmaster's exclusivity is falling off, but... Surely, there must have been a mistake?}}

{{dialogue|title=Invited Guest|The Puppetmaster sources such exotic creatures for his puppets.

His work is... grotesque, in a hauntingly beautiful sort of way. Such a profound message about embracing the immense power we Ascended have been granted by our beloved queen.}}

Talk to Orator Tx'itk to start the show:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|There he is. Play along, act like part of his show!}}
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|It is my greatest pleasure to introduce the newest addition to my collection.}}
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|Dim the lights! Let's see what you can do, pet. Audition well for me.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|There's the Magistrate! I'll cut his strings. Keep the Puppetmaster occupied!}}
:{{text|yell|The Puppetmaster|Still so certain of your ability to save our esteemed Magistrate?}}

While slaying the Puppetmaster's puppets:
:{{text|yell|The Puppetmaster|Your joints will make a fine addition to my collection!}}
:{{text|yell|The Puppetmaster|Go on then, pet! The Magistrate should not be kept waiting!}}
:{{text|yell|The Puppetmaster|It is time for the grand finale. Dim the lights, clear the stage!}}

Upon defeating all the puppets, High Elevator Etak'kaht's body drops to the floor:
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|What's this? Impossible! My reputation...}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Quick, the serum!}}
:{{text|say|Invited Guest|I thought you were better than this, Puppetmaster!}}
:{{text|say|Invited Guest|Boo!}}
:{{text|say|Invited Guest|Seriously? The overcrawler wins at the end?}}
:{{text|say|Invited Guest|I'm telling my friends not to waste their time with this.}}

Upon using the serum:
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|Fine. Fine! The show must go on... but not today. A grander reprise awaits.}}
:{{text|say|High Elevator Etak'kaht|I am in your debt, Orator.}}
:{{text|say|High Elevator Etak'kaht|I entertained his twisted "art" until now. I did not expect the Puppetmaster's subjects ever to include his betters.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|This show ruined the Puppetmaster's reputation. He shouldn't be a problem for you anymore.}}
:{{text|say|High Elevator Etak'kaht|Let us return to my office. We can discuss there.}}

Upon returning to the Magistrate's Office:
:{{text|say|High Elevator Etak'kaht|... And so, given the service you have offered me, I would be happy to grant my approval for your Ascension.}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|This is a great honor, High Elevator.}}
