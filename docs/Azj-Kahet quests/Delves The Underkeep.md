==Objectives==
Find information on [[Zekvir]] within the [[Underkeep]] and complete the [[delve]] at any difficulty.
*Zekvir's origins found within the Underkeep
*The Underkeep completed on any difficulty

==Description==
Who would've thought I'd be cozying up in a [[nerubian]]'s lair!

The [[Widow Arak'nai|Weaver]] gave me a lead on how to uncover more about this [[Zekvir]].

He{{sic}} says there's a place called the Underkeep that might have records on him.

Let's check it out and see what we can find!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Companion Experience]]
*100 [[Resonance Crystals]]

==Completion==
Zekvir is an agent of [[Xal'atath]]! And he's trying to destroy any memories of [[Azeroth]] that he finds.

That makes our job of exploring more crucial than ever, <name>. We won't give up, not even with Xal'atath's toady chasing us!

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{Text|Say|Brann Bronzebeard|Ye've got a lot of interesting things here! This Underkeep might be the lead I'm looking for.}}

On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Brann Bronzebeard|This might be tough sneaking into the heart of the city, but we've got to try it to find out more about this monster Zekvir!}}

Find the research papers inside the Underkeep:

Subject: Zekvir

I thought he was a failure like the others. However, Zekvir managed to survive the process and maintain his sanity.

Disappointed to see him go, but it appears a certain powerful sponsor requested him personally. Inquiries revealed only a goal to eliminate the memories of something called... the Worldsoul?

Must press on to see if another Zekvir can be created. Was it a fluke? Force of will? Time will tell.

On completion:
:{{Text|Say|Brann Bronzebeard|I'm going to find my way back to the surface. There's a lot to think on regarding this Zekvir and the Worldsoul memories he's after.}}
:{{Text|Say|Brann Bronzebeard|Whatever is happening... it seems like it's important for us to find these memories and put a stop to this monster. Somehow.}}

==Beta==
;Description
Who would've thought I'd be cozying up in a [[nerubian]]'s lair!

There's a nasty named Zekvir threatening folks trying to explore the island. I've been asking [[Widow Arak'nai|the Weaver]] for any information she's got.

Supposedly, there's a place called the Underkeep that might have records on him. Let's check it out and see what we can find!
