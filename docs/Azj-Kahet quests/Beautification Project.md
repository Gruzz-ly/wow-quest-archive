==Objectives==
Clear the [[Stagshell Hollow]] of Overgrown Plants.
* Plants removed (8)

==Description==
A fine enough job, for one of your... kind.

If you want to keep breathing, I suggest you continue to assist us. It may prove lucrative for you, if you comply.

[[Rak-Ush]]'s former master allowed the stagshells to run feral, and abandoned the hollows to decay.

Invasive plants have infested the old stagshell hollows.

Find a way to clear them. I don't care how.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It would be unwise to return to me with an unfinished job.

==Completion==
Hm. It'll do.

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
