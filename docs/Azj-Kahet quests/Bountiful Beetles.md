==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kish'nal]] in [[Rak-Ush]].

==Description==
[[Anub'azal|General Anub'azal]] has great plans in motion for the swarmery, Rak-Ush. He intends to return it to working order, to support his war campaign.

However... I have my reservations about the two he left in charge.

Kish'nal seems to have a good head on his shoulders, but [[Vix'aron]]? Volatile is an understatement. They may require some... prodding.

Seek out Kish'nal at Rak-Ush and follow up on Anub'azal's orders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, so the general has sent out an observer?
