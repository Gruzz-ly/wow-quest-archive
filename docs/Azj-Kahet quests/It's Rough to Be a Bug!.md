'''It's Rough to Be a Bug!''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]] in [[Rak-Ush]].

==Objectives==
Clean up the barn in [[Rak-Ush]].
* Debris cleared (8)

==Description==
[[Anub'azal]] gave his orders! We are the new masters of Rak-Ush!

Yet [[Vix'aron]] decided throw a tantrum and destroy our barn instead.

We are to restore the stagshell hollows and fill them with swarmbeasts.

Since this imbecile refuses to follow orders, perhaps you will, two-leg.

Maybe then we will decide not to kill you for eavesdropping. And recompense, I suppose.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need this barn in an operational state!

==Completion==
Surprisingly, you've proven yourself useful.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Vix'aron|I refuse!}}
:{{text|say|Vix'aron|Agriculture is beneath me.}}
:{{text|say|Kish'nal|We have no other choice.}}
:{{text|say|Kish'nal|Anub'azal has assigned us to Rak-Ush. To deal with the stagshells.}}
:{{text|say|Kish'nal|It does not mean we cannot delegate.}}

{{dialogue|title=Vix'aron|Farm labor is beneath me.

{{gossip|Why does Anub'azal want Rak-Ush operational?}}

The swarmbeasts produce valuable goods. Goods that Anub'azal requires for the war effort.

Our agreement is to allow you a small portion of those resources in exchange for your labor.

The majority of the resources will go to Anub'azal.

It is for the betterment of Azj-Kahet.}}

While clearing the debris:
:{{text|say|Kish'nal|You love commanding lesser beings. Is that not satisfactory enough?}}
:{{text|say|Vix'aron|Not unless there is carnage involved.}}
:{{text|say|Vix'aron|I should be grinding bodies into dust.}}
:{{text|say|Kish'nal|Be that as it may, Anub'azal will not permit insubordination.}}
:{{text|say|Vix'aron|I refuse to participate.}}
:{{text|say|Kish'nal|That is not an option, Vix'aron.}}
:{{text|say|Kish'nal|What if you did not have to perform any agricultural duties yourself?}}
:{{text|say|Vix'aron|Perhaps. I can make no promises.}}

==Progression==
