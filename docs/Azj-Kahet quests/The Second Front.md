'''The Second Front''' starts the optional [[Azj-Kahet storyline]] chapter of the same name, immediately after crash-landing in [[Azj-Kahet]].

==Objectives==
Signal the landing zone.
* Signal a landing field

==Description==
Our reinforcements are already inbound.

[[Nerubian|These spiders]] just decided where our next wall will go. Clear a landing zone for [[General Steelstrike]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|5|85}}
* 2,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I will NOT risk the nerubians flanking us again. Their ambush is now our staging ground!

==Notes==
The [[Flare Box]] is southwest of the airship. Interact with it and skiffs will drop off balilstae, barricades, and crates of materiel. [[General Steelstrike]], [[Kal Smoulderbrow]], and more [[Arathi Aeroknight]]s all run up to defend the emplacement.

On complete, Steelstrike has gossip:

{{Dialogue|
Building a second front here will be costly. However, the enemy was kind enough to provide some of those resources.
