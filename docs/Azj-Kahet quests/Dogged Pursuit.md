==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Royal Broker Rez'kal.png|Royal Broker Rez'kal|A Sureki enforcer tasked with stripping the old histories from the Royal Preservatory.}}
Defeat Royal Broker Rez'kal.
*[[Royal Broker Rez'kal]] slain

==Description==
But of course, simply stealing the relics isn't enough. We need to teach the Queen's pet burrow-worms a lesson in futility, or they will simply start the whole process again!

That shouting buffoon near the central passage is Rez'kal, a member of [[Ansurek]]'s personal academic entourage. He's... not very bright, but he makes up for it with enough strength to send either of us through a wall.

I'm not inclined to go toe to toe with the big oaf today. Would you mind overmuch doing one last favor for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|46|80}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]
* [[The Vizier's Commendation]]
* [[The General's Commendation]]
* [[The Weaver's Commendation]]
*35 [[Kej]]

==Progress==
Be careful, <name>. What Rez'kal lacks in acuity he makes up for in scarab-headed stubbornness.

==Completion==
Ah! There you are. Fine job back there with the lummox. He may have been a buffoon, but he was a buffoon with very sharp blades on his arms.

Now, with relics in hand, it is time for me to make my grand exit. I've a great many pilfered riches to re-appropriate, after all! I've truly enjoyed our time working together, though. Perhaps, with luck, our paths will cross again soon.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ar'syn|Careful, now, dear. That hollow-headed scarab has a nasty habit of tramping people underfoot.}}

On engaging Royal Broker Rez'kal:
:{{text|say|Royal Broker Rez'kal|Our new history begins with Queen Ansurek!}}

On death:
:{{text|say|Royal Broker Rez'kal|Curse you... Was this your doing, Ar'syn...?}} 

The Surkei Guards will disappear, allowing free exit.
Ar'syn will be on a column above the area you met her.
After completion, she has additional gossip text:
{{Dialogue|
Ah, hello again! I trust your escapades proceed apace?

Do give the Weaver my regards. Should she ever require a contact for some creative repossession, I am certainly available for a little bit of contract work.
