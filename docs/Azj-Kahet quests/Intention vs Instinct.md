==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Wormcaller Iz'tikrine.jpg|Wormcaller Iz'kitrine|He is never alone.}}
Collect a Singing Stone from [[Wormcaller Iz'tikrine]].
* [[Singing Stone]]

==Description==
[[Jawcrawler|Cave borers]] are not social creatures as a rule. Seeing this many gather in one place speaks to intention.

A wormcaller of the [[nerubian]]s must be present.

Find them and recover the tool they use to call these worms here. With it we can lead them away in time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|46|80}}
* 14,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can sense more worms coming. As if they are drawn to this place.

==Completion==
What a strange gem.

The song within must be what is drawing the worms to this place.

==Notes==
Enter the cave and players will automatically accept [[Heeeelllp!!!]]. While in the cave, the [[Tremorsense]] bar fills as players move, and drains as they stand still. Don't let it hit 100%.

Head northeast in the cave area at {{co|38.95|42.23|Azj-Kahet}} to enter an enclosed cave where [[Wormcaller Iz'tikrine]] is channeling Deepsong into a [[Resonance Pylon]]. Aggro the wormcaller:
:{{text|say|Wormcaller Iz'tikrine|Invader! You dare threaten my lovelies?!}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Wormcaller Iz'tikrine|Make... sure... they eat all of me.}}

Loot the wormcaller's corpse for a [[Singing Stone]].

On complete of both, Na'layro has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|You have done what I am forbidden to. You have gone where I cannot and fought that which must not know I exist.

It is almost liberating to have such help. Though please, do not take it personally if I never tell my people of our meeting.

I thank you for your efforts.}}
