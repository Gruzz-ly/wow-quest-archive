==Objectives==
Kill 8 Kaheti forces in [[Rak-Zakaz]].
* [[Kaheti]] forces slain (8)

==Description==
Even with the general gone, it's not going to be easy getting out of here. This place is infested.

I know I'm hiding it well, but I'm not exactly feeling my best. I'm not sure I'll be much help in this state.

You're going to have to clear a path for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Say what you will, but you do meet the most interesting company while imprisoned.

==Completion==
In my defense, they disarmed me. And envenomed me. Also, does this look infected to you?

Anyway, if not for all that, I would have helped. You have my word.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I need my weapons. And something for this Weaver so she'll give me an antidote. Since I like being alive.}}

==Progression==
{{Unraveling the Trapped}}
