==Objectives==
Recover the logbook and discover what happened to [[Anub'okki]].
*[[Poisoned Dagger (War Within)]]
*[[Zev'kall's Attrition Log]]

==Description==
If it will get you out of here sooner, I will tell you what I saw.

I did not see what happened to Anub'okki. But I can tell you that corpses are dumped into [[Pillar-nest Xesh]] to be forgotten about. The cleanup crew dragged Anub'okki out of here not long ago.

If you hurry, you may be able to examine the remains before they are gone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*750 [[Kej]]

==Progress==
Did you find Anub'okki?

==Completion==
This dagger has a version of [[Zev'kall]]'s new pheromones on the handle. I know that he was involved in this. Directly killing Anub'okki is one step too far.

The assassin also did not take the logbook back. Zev'kall is showing his hand: that he thinks I am powerless, even if I have blackmail information.

This will not stand!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ukos'via|If you find anything, take it out of here. I wash my claws of all of this.}}

Ukos'via's gossip:
{{dialogue|Go find someone else to annoy. I do not want to be seen speaking to you.}}

At the site of the corpse{{co|55.0|41.2|Azj-Kahet}}, [[Kib'kur]] stands with two Corpse Relocators:
:{{text|say|Kib'kur|This corpse wont drag itself.}}
:{{text|say|Corpse Relocator|I saw sharp thing first. Hand it over!}}
:{{text|say|Corpse Relocator|My dagger. Mine!}}

Upon their deaths, Kib'kur will drop Zev'kall's Attrition Log, which appears to be the same from [[General Admission]]. The Corpse Relocators will drop the Poisoned Dagger.

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Anub'okki was a promising student and a brave warrior. His loss will be felt, not just by me, but  by the [[Heritage Force]] as a whole.}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|I will not stand for this. I cannot stand for this.}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|I must return to [[Siegehold]]. Anub'okki will be avenged, but I require time to consider how best to earn such. Return to your routine duties until then, soldier. Dismissed.}}
:''Anub'azal wanders off.''
