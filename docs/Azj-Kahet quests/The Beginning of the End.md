==Objectives==
Cause disruption in the Umbral Bazaar.
* [[Umbral Bazaar]] disrupted (0/100%)

==Description==
[[Queen Ansurek]] has been busy since [[Kaheti Hospitality|the assassination attempt]]. Her grip is tightening on [[Azj-Kahet]] and her ever loyal nobles attend to her darkest whims. 

On behest of the Queen, her two most loyal nobles [[Skeinspinner Takazj]] and [[Anub'arash]], have locked down the Umbral Bazaar. 

Takazj's insufferable propaganda machinations and Anub'arash's increased military presence have painted a clear picture, ascend or die.

I need you to go to the Umbral Bazaar and disrupt their hold.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
How disappointing that Queen Ansurek continues to lead us to darkness.

==Completion==
The Queen's grip loosens and Skeinspinner Takazj and Anub'arash look worse in her eyes. Two flies, one thread.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Disruption is the key to loosening the Queen's hold on Azj-Kahet. What better place to start than the heart of the city?}}

Kill [[Bazaar Guard]]s, [[Bazaar Sentry|Bazaar Sentries]], [[Crawling Bulwark]]s, and interact with [[Propaganda Hologram]]s. Skeinspinner Takazj's words are broadcasted through the holograms:
* {{Text|say|Bazaar Guards will find all disloyal citizens.}}
* {{Text|say|Disloyalty will not be tolerated!}}
* {{Text|say|For a new Azj-kahet. A strong Azj-kahet{{sic}} The Queen's Azj-kahet.}}
* {{Text|say|Ascension is the only path forward. Prove your loyalty to the queen.}}
* {{Text|say|We must unite under Queen Ansurek if we want to flourish!}}
* {{Text|say|The penalty for disloyalty is death!}}

On return, projections of [[Anub'arash]] and [[Skeinspinner Takazj]] are in a conversation with Nizrek:
:{{text|say|Skeinspinner Takazj|A dissident has run amok in the Umbral Bazaar and smashed my propaganda projectors! Your job, Anub'arash, is for your soldiers to keep the peace!}}
:{{text|say|Anub'arash|Bah! Don't blame me for your failings to placate the citizens, Skeinspinner. Perhaps you aren't as persuasive as you think!}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Quiet both of you! The Queen expects results not excuses. Do your jobs or we will find someone who will.}}
