<The words on the parchment appear burned, not written. A venomous tang singes your nose.>

Blind and alone, you stumble in the dark. I offer you a thread to cling to.

Follow it, should you wish to find your allies.

* [[Webweave Belt]]
* [[Webweave Stompers]]
* [[Webweave Wristguards]]
* [[Webweave Grips]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
State your business, lest I get peckish.

==Completion==
So you followed my guiding line to its terminus.

For both of our sakes, I am glad that your zeal outpaces your survival instinct.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|emote|The strange creature blinks at you placidly, waiting only a moment before scurrying into the dark.}}

Catch up with [[Spindle]] behind bushes on the [[Silken Path]]:
:{{text|emote|The spider gestures frantically towards the road, before crouching down behind a bush. It seems to want you to hide.}}

Use the extra action button:
:{{abilities|Weaver's Wile|Hide from danger with the help of your spider guide.|range=10|cd=15 sec|notes=1.3 sec cast}}
:{{text|emote|Panicked, the miniscule spider quickly envelops you in a mess of webs before scurrying off down the road.}}
:{{text|say|[[Sureki Hunter-Killer]]|Watch and lurk, drudges. There will be no interruptions on Ascension Day.}}

On the bridge, [[Sureki Leaper]]s and [[Sureki Screamer|Screamers]] ambush:
:{{text|emote|The cowering spider waits for an opening in the violence before skittering away from the predators.}}

Catch up with Spindle once more on the path up into the cliffs.
:{{text|say|[[Severed Observer]]|Scurry on, little scarab!}}
:{{text|say|Severed Observer|The Weaver bids you welcome.}}
:''Spindle runs up into the [[Weaver's Lair]].''

Catch up with Spindle beneath [[Widow Arak'nai]] in the central platform:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Ahh, there's the little morsel now. Come in, come in! You are most welcome here.}}
