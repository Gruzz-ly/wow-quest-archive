==Objectives==
Stow away into a box to be carried into [[Siegehold]].
* [[Inconspicuous Box]] {{co|62.8|31.1|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
Hm. This [[Anub'azal]] gave the orders that led to the prisoners' escape. [[Zev'kall]] here didn't seem very pleased with that.

So how about this--you sneak into Siegehold, and make best friends with Anub'azal. Easy.

I've noticed a lot of cargo being ferried over, I'm sure no one would notice if we just swapped out the contents of a particular crate.

In the meantime, I'll share our discoveries with the Weaver. I'd love to come with you, but I'd rather not tempt more Flynn stabbings today.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What an interesting "delivery" you are.

I have use for you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|We've got a plan now! Sneak into a crate and get a lift to Siegehold. Find this Anub'azal. Meanwhile, I'll get this intel to the Weaver... and get that antidote.}}
:''Flynn disappears.''

Back in the main part of [[Rak-Zakaz]] is an inconspicuous box. Hop in, and a nerubian flyer swings by to pick up the box and heads west to [[Siegehold]], and drops the box off inside a building, where [[Anub'azal]] is speaking with two [[Siegehold Armorsmith]]s:
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|What an interesting delivery...}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Everyone! Return to your duties. Now!}}
:''The armorsmiths run off.''
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Approach, intruder.}}

Before Anub'azal are the corpses of [[Monte Gazlowe]], [[Fawnia Landkeep]]<!-- Beta name: Sara Lorry, Wowhead has a screenshot of the old model-->, [[Rylen Fairfeather]], [[Nori Minesmith]], and the [[Busted Shredder X-3922]], Gazlowe's Sweet Ride in a pile of spoils.

Inspect Gazlowe's corpse:
{{Dialogue|<Gazlowe appears to be dead.>}}

Hm. This [[Anub'azal]] gave the orders that led to the prisoners' escape. [[Zev'kall]] here didn't seem very pleased with that.

So how about this--you sneak into Siegehold, and make an alliance with Anub'azal.

I've noticed a lot of cargo being ferried over, I'm sure no one would notice if we just swapped out the contents of a particular crate.

In the meantime, I'll share our discoveries with the Weaver. Hopefully that'll be enough to trade for something to help with this venom...
