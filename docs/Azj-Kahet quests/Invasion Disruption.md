==Objectives==
Disrupt the [[nerubian]] invasion efforts at [[Arathi's End]].
*[[Arathi's End]] disrupted (0/100%)

==Description==
While we cannot eliminate the nerubian threat here, we can disrupt their invasion plans.

There are any number of opportunities to accomplish our goal. Let's see what kind of damage we can do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|58|50}}
* 30,500 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The more we can accomplish here, the safer we make things for Hallowfall.

==Completion==
That's enough for now. We'll need to periodically return to weaken their forces until there's another solution.

==Notes==
Faerin's gossip:
