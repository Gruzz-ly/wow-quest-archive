==Objectives==
Overwrite 3 Shadecasters.
* Shadecasters rewritten (3)

==Description==
We called you here today because it is "Ascendance Day". [[Queen Ansurek]] has deigned declare it a day to revel in our newfound, void-infused evolution--our "Ascendance". Please note my satirical nuance.

While the streets are alive with festivity and joyous citizens, the Shadecasters planted through the Bazaar will be drowning the air with Ansurek's vile propaganda.

Take this invention of mine. use it on the heralds to overwrite them with more... illuminating information for the public.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Nizrek's Holographic Manipulator]]
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Anduin has me worried.

I've always known him to lean towards diplomacy, but does he have the conviction to draw his sword?

If he does not, he may never be able to end this war.

==Completion==
Yes. The Vizier asked the same of me in the other city districts.

I'll admit that my reluctance to trust Anduin's new ally has waned slightly. No more than a little finger's length, but even that is more than I anticipated.

==Notes==
Shadecasters, projectors of Queen Ansurek, are all over the city.

At {{co|58.2|29.0|City of Threads}} in the southeast of the quest area:
:{{text|say|Queen Ansurek|Ascension! Reserved only for the most loyal. The purest form of our evolution.}}

Interact with the Shadecaster to overwrite it, showing an Ascended:
:{{text|say|The Vizier|Purest form? Ask yourselves, do the ascended appear nerubian to you?}}
:{{text|say|Bazaar Patrol|Overcrawler! Invader!}}
:{{text|say|Umbral Citizen|Let's get out of here!}}
:{{text|say|Umbral Citizen|Patrols! Run!}}
:{{text|say|Bazaar Patrol|The queen's word shall not be silenced!}}

At {{co|60.9|18.8|City of Threads}} to the northeast, near Meesk's Guard:
:{{text|say|Queen Ansurek|The zealots have pressed our borders with their airships. We must show them the venom of Azj-Kahet!}}

Reprogram it to show a projection of the Black Empire:
:{{text|say|The Vizier|Queen Neferess boldly shielded our people against any threat we faced. Will Ansurek do the same?}}

Nearby, [[Arax'ne]] starts [[Searching the Web]], an optional quest.

To the east at {{co|53.0|16.0|City of Threads}} inside the [[Dangling Drinks]] bar:
:{{text|say|Queen Ansurek|We will wipe out the invaders from above, no matter what it takes!}}

Overwrite it to project Harbingers of the Void:
:{{text|say|The Vizier|Are the Old Ones truly gone, or do agents of the Void continue to manipulate us today?}}

Once done with both quests, catch up with Anduin and Alleria at the [[Royal Apothecary]] near the center of the city:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We're here to observe and learn about Ansurek. That's all.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We've observed enough.}}
