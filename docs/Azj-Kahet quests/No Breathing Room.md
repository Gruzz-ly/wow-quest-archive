==Objectives==
Slay Seeping creatures.
*Seeping creatures culled

==Description==
We all followed [[Orweyna]] to these surface caves because we believed in what we were doing. But this... We did not bargain for so many injuries, so much dogged searching.

For now, we just need a little breathing room. Slay the creatures out there that are harming us, and we can get the space to address the real issue.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Progress==
Our people are fierce and strong. We are accustomed to being outnumbered. But this is too much.

==Completion==
That should give us some space to retreat.

And now we must deal with the crux of the issue. That is, Orweyna's ever-lasting determination to pursue this mission, no matter the cost.

It's time we had a talk.

==Notes==
Fill the bar to 100% by killing [[Seeping Jawcrawler]]s, [[Seeping Fleshmite]]s, [[Seeping Crustbreaker]]s, & [[Bloodcrust Behemoth]]s.

==Progression==
{{Lingering Shadows}}
