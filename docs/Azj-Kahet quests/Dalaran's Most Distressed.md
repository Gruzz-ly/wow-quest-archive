==Objectives==
Free prisoners for the fake prisoner convoy.
* Free webbed prisoners {{co|47.2|26.9|Azj-Kahet}}
* Free caged prisoners {{co|43.9|24.9|Azj-Kahet}}
* Assist Gazlowe {{co|45.1|23.1|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
I don't trust [[Anub'azal|this big bug]] at all. He let me lay there ages without saying anything!

But if he wants to give us access to [[Siegehold]], let's use it. I saw some other people dragged away into other parts of the base. I don't think they're eating them. It looks more like they're transporting them somewhere.

Let's gather them up, make a prisoner convoy, and roll on out. Find me outside!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Wow... this is a LOT of people.

But they're all miserable. Fortunately, that's just the flavor we need to sell my idea.

This could work.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Acquire Zev'kall's "pheromones" for me, and I'll ensure the freedom of your allies.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|You've got a deal! Come on <name>, lets go.}}
:''Monte runs out.''

Just outside to the south, Monte has dropped a [[Gazlowe's Detonator|detonator]] outside cages containing [[Marcia Chase]], [[Jepetto Joybuzz]], [[Babagahnoosh the Grumpy]], [[Katy Stampwhistle]], and [[Bonegrim]]:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Don't worry, I threw down my lockpicks. Also known as explosives!}}

The prisoners all have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Marcia Chase|They took my fishing pole. As if it were a weapon!}}
{{dialogue|title=Jepetto Joybuzz|I have a toy or two that could help us get out of here! I just didn't know I'd need them in my pockets when Dalaran crashed.}}
{{dialogue|title=Babagahnoosh the Grumpy|<Babgahnoosh grumbles and tries to edge away from the other gnomes in the cage, but there is no room to go anywhere.>}}
{{dialogue|title=Katy Stampwhistle|I keep worryin' about if the mail is still goin' through! I can't stay here forever!}}
{{dialogue|title=Bonegrim|I'd like to "export" myself right outa this place!}}

Use the detonator:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Your rescue chariot awaits! This way, folks.}}
:{{text|say|Katy Stampwhistle|Thank goodness! If I had to listen to Babagahnoosh grind his teeth any longer...}}
:{{text|emote|Babagahnoosh grumbles.}}
:{{text|say|Katy Stampwhistle|Just kidding! Lets regroup with everyone else.}}

Further southeast is a set of four cages containing [[High Arcanist Savor]]'s [[Mirror Image]]s... Speak with any of the mirrors:
{{dialogue|<This seems to be a mirror image. It stares at you calmly.>

{{gossip|quest=|Hello?}}

I saw you earlier, <race>. Using the last of my mana, I tried to help this group, but I am exhausted. We are close by, cloaked by [[Greater Invisibility|greater invisibility]].

{{gossip|quest=|Have you seen Anduin?}}

No. Is he missing?

This isn't a safe place to talk. We should get moving. The invisibility is wearing off.

{{gossip|quest=|Meet up at the transport wagons.}}}}

[[High Arcanist Savor]], [[Naleidea Rivergleam]], [[Aimee]], and [[Uda the Beast]] drop out of invisibility:
:{{text|say|High Arcanist Savor|We're over here.}}
:{{text|say|High Arcanist Savor|We'll head to the wagons... but I hope you have a real plan in mind.}}

To the southeast, not far from where [[Mi'thk]] was, are three [[Wriggling Web]]s. Speak with the center one:

{{dialogue|Mmmhmmph, mm!

{{gossip|quest=|I'm here to rescue you. Pretend you're part of the next prisoner convoy!}}}}

[[Harold Winston]], [[Meerah]], and [[Ka'ro the Chopper]] pop out:
:{{text|say|Meerah|You got it! I'll lead the way.}}
:{{text|say|Meerah|Everybody act super sad! Pretend someone was mean to your alpaca.}}

Catch up with all the escapees, who ''all'' have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Meerah|I'll try my best to not look suspicious. Some o' these other guys are lookin' a little too happy about the rescue, though.

{{gossip|Why were you webbed, instead of in a cage?}}

I think they ran out of cages.

Also, I escaped my cage twice...

{{gossip|Who was with you?}}

Harold Wiston and Ka'ro are here with me now. Harold's been here since Dalaran, but I think Ka'ro got captured sometime afterwards.

{{gossip|Have you seen Anduin or Alleria?}}

Are they missing? I've been stuck here since Dalaran was attacked. We were kidnapped.

They've been feeding us and transporting us around since then. I don 't know why.}}

{{dialogue|title=High Arcanist Savor|I hope you know what you're doing.}}
{{dialogue|title=Naleidea Rivergleam|I'll do what I can to keep the others calm. Don't worry about me.}}
{{dialogue|title=Aimee|I'm hopeful I can return to making pies and cakes. I'm not an adventurer!}}
{{dialogue|title=Marcia Chase|I never expected Dalaran to fall...}}
{{dialogue|title=Katy Stampwhistle|This may seem like chaos, but nothin' compared to the mailroom at Dalaran, ha!

...Wait. Is the mailroom still okay?}}
{{dialogue|title=Ka'ro the Chopper|What an awful situation.}}
{{dialogue|title=Jepetto Joybuzz|I'm just glad to not be in that cramped cage anymore.}}
{{dialogue|title=Babagahnoosh the Grumpy|This rescue feels ill-planned.

I should get to ride in the wagon!}}
{{dialogue|title=Uda the Beast|I loathe this stealth approach, but we are wildly outnumbered.}}
{{dialogue|title=Bonegrim|We just gotta have everybody be confident. Confidence is most of it.}}
{{dialogue|title=Harold Winston|I had hoped to leave the Underbelly of Dalaran.

This is not what I had in mind.}}
