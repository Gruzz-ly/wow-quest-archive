Start by talking to [[Eirzay]] in the [[Crawling Chasm]]:
{{dialogue|General Anub'azal went through a great deal of trouble to commission a new collection of blades for the Heritage Forces. Naturally, Zev'kall reappropriated them the moment he found out.

I believe it is time we did a little reappropriation of our own, don't you?
