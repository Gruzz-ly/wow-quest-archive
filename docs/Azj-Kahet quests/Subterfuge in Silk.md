==Objectives==
Meet with [[Teth]] at [[Rak-Ahat]].

==Description==
I'm expecting a shipment of silk. That it hasn't arrived worries me.

Most silk in [[Azj-Kahet]], from the finest veils to the strongest warsilk, comes from Rak-Ahat. It makes the place a convenient nexus of information.

One of my agents smuggles military secrets woven into the silk itself. Recently, she has reported a power struggle emerging in Rak-Ahat... and even more recently, she has reported nothing at all.

Meet with her and ensure no more delays.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see our mutual "friend" got my message and sent you to aid.

Our production schedule is shot as our management struggles to assert itself.

I propose this chaos is fertile ground for the ambitious.
