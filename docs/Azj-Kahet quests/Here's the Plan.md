==Objectives==
Help Faerin prepare while she explains her plan.
* Speak with [[Faerin Lothar]]
* Listen to Faerin
* [[Faerin's Shield]]
* Faerin's Shield returned
* [[Bag of Betelsnax]]

==Description==
<Name>, the time has come to deal with the [[nerubian]] army. [[Zev'kall|General Zev'kall]] is massing a sizeable force to the east. He intends to breach the wall and invade [[Hallowfall]]. There isn't much time.

We do not have the strength for an all-out assault. To that end, [[Widow Arak'nai|the Weaver]] has sent [[Gazlowe]] here to assist us. I'm willing to do what it takes to save my people.

And as fate would have it, I have a personal matter to attend to while we are there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm learning not all nerubians are bad or the same. I just hope the three of us are enough.

==Completion==
I think the three of us will be enough for this. Lean and mean, right?

==Notes==
Faerin's gossip:
{{dialogue|I can't let my gut lead the way every time.

{{gossip|quest=|What's the plan?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|High General Zev'kall's forces are massing once more to the northeast.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Intel provided by Gazlowe, under the direction of the Weaver, shows their numbers are too great for our forces to confront head-on.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Excuse me, but I do my own direction... er, directing. Gah! You know what I mean.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|On a personal note, I've uncovered a lead. A dear, old friend of mine was captured by the nerubians years ago.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Rumor is he might be where we're headed. After all this time, I must know what happened to him.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|<Name>, would you mind bringing me my shield?}}

{{Gossip|quest=|<Give Faerin her shield.>}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Thank you. Gazlowe, your thoughts?}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I thought you'd never ask. Yeah, the three of us are gonna go in and hit 'em from behind.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|To that end, why don't you grab a big ol' bag of Betelsnax.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I've got an idea for how to deal with their ballistae. And by deal with them, I mean make 'em go kaboom!}}

Grab the bag of Betelsnax:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Those'll do nicely!}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|We should get going.}}
