==Objectives==
Use the Harmonizing Instrument.
*[[Hamonizing Instrument]] used

==Description==
<[[Orweyna]] looks relieved at the sight of [[Hannan]], but does not seem dissuaded from her task.>

I cannot say I am surprised at what you found in that cave. [[Nerubian]]s stuck in the [[Unseeming]], trapped in a realm of monsters and madness...

I would pity them, but they sought this out.

You, however, need to shift back before the influence of the [[Black Blood]] becomes too strong on your mind.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is a relief that the tuning crystal we found worked on this strange instrument. For once we should be grateful for the ingenuity of the nerubians.

If this device had not worked, we may have been stuck in the Unseeming forever. Like the nerubians in the cave.

==Completion==
She can't keep running off like this! The rest of us followed her here--against our better judgement I might add--but we never agreed to...

<Hannan sighs.>

No, we knew exactly what we were getting into with her. And the... consequences.

==Notes==
Hannan's gossip:
{{dialogue|I felt so paranoid in the Unseeming. So isolated. Like drowning, but it was darkness that was suffocating me, unspeakable horrors all around.

I... I am not like you two. I can't just rush headfirst into danger. I prefer using my abilities to help things grow.

But you have my thanks for pulling me out of that, stranger.

{{gossip|Ask Hannan why he's so concerned about Orweyna's mission.}}

{{dialogue-child|I'm still not supposed to--

<Hannan sighs.>

It is admirable that Orweyna is so determined to make a difference here. We are called to protect the roots, and the Black Blood poses a grave threat to them.

But I don't see how Orweyna's path can lead to the harmony she seeks.

We are forbidden from interacting with strangers, under no uncertain terms. Yet here I am, discussing this with you. It is not right.

I just want to regroup back at the Wildcamp. Be more cautious in our approach. Take our time before rushing into things with no care for who sees us.}}

:{{text|say|Orweyna|Now? Hannan, listen. The song... The dissonance. It's getting louder.}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|I must find the heart of this corruption.}}
