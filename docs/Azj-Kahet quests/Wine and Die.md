==Objectives==
Find a way to charm Meesk the Venomtongue.
* [[Wood-Worm Tonic]]
* [[Nana Lek'kel]] Convinced

==Description==
I can see it now, morsel. The pattern of our newest weave is laid bare before my mind.

Meesk is well-guarded. He believes himself to be safe. That is where his weakness lies.

Go to the city. Procure a bottle of his favorite drink and present it to him as a gift from your benefactor. Once he is sufficiently wooed by your affable charms, bring him to the High Hollows for his well-earned reward.

I trust you, <name>. And if you lay our threads out properly, I can guarantee you quite the show.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}

==Completion==
I've heard about you, overcrawler... Skittering about in our fair city and causing all sorts of trouble.

I am glad that your superiors have finally recognized the value of having an ally like me in a place like this.

==Notes==
There are ways to pass through, or via bribe of {{cost|1000||}} or via [[wood-worm tonic]] which can be found at the Terrace of the Ascended.{{co|77|52|City of Threads}}

On taking the wood-worm tonic:
:{{text|say|Ascended Socialite|Hey, overcrawler! There's a line!}}
:{{text|say|Ascended Socialite|Hold your tongue, you warped-wealed buffoon! That's one of the Weaver's pets.}}

{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
Nope. Outta here.

{{Gossip|Me? Why?}}
{{Dialogue-child|You're odd. I've never seen you before.

{{Gossip|I just want to look inside.}}

{{Dialogue-child|Doesn't matter. Meesk doesn't allow anyone without an invitation.

Before you ask: No, you're not invited.

{{Gossip|Maybe you and I could just chat?}}

{{Gossip|You're making it even more interesting.}}

{{Gossip|Can I pet your beetles?}}

{{Dialogue-child|If you don't take your leave, my girls might get angry.

Angry or hungry. Same thing.

{{Gossip|I get the feeling we could be friends.}}

{{Gossip|No! Why don't YOU leave!}}

{{Gossip|Tell me, Nana. Who hurt you?}}

{{Gossip|quest=|I'm here to see Meesk.}}

{{Dialogue-child|Heh. I bet you are. And what makes you think Meesk wants to see a runt like you?

{{Gossip|quest=|I've brought him a gift on my patron's behalf.}}

{{Gossip|quest=|I have one thousand reasons to let me in, right here.}}

On entering:
:{{text|say|Meesk the Venomtongue|Well, now! You're that overcrawler, aren't you? And you come bearing gifts... How delectable.}}
