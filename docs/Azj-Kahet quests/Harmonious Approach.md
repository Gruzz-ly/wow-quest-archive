{{questportrait|Harvest Warden Izk'tilak.png|Harvest Warden Izk'tilak|An important figure in charge of the Black Blood harvesting operation. Anything he sees down here will certainly be reported upward.}}
Kill Harvest Warden Izk'tilak.
* [[Harvest Warden Izk'tilak]] slain

==Description==
I know I cannot stop [[Orweyna]] from going down there and drawing attention to our presence.

But... perhaps we could stop word of our presence from spreading.

Find whoever is in charge of this harvest site. And... do what is needed to ensure they can't spread the word.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 14,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm not going to leave her down here alone. but we have to be cautious. We must deal with anyone who sees us.

==Completion==
I will admit, I am glad to have had you with us through all of this.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Hannan|If Orweyna is going to insist on doing this, we can at least try to... well... cover our tracks.}}

Upon engaging Izk'tilak:
:{{text|say|Harvest Warden Izk'tilak|You cannot stop what has begun!}}

Upon defeat:
