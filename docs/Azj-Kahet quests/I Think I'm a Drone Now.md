==Objectives==
Allow [[Anub'azal]] to mark you with his pheromones.
*Apply Anub'azal's mark

==Description==
There, I have extended some goodwill. You have [[Monte Gazlowe|a little goblin friend]]. I know how much your kind clings to each other for warmth.

And now you both will do things for me. First, I will provide you with my pheromone scent mark. It will keep my loyal soldiers from attacking you. It marks you as mine.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[General's Pungent Wraps]]
* [[General's Pungent Armor]]
* [[General's Pungent Legguards]]
* [[General's Pungent Mantle]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|5|85}}
* 2,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't waste my time. Are you ready to accept my mark? Step into the pheromone cloud with your goblin friend, and rub it on.

==Completion==
Your friend complains, but my mark will keep you relatively safe, except from Zev'kall's guards. They won't care about scent marks if they are already hostile to me.

So make the most of it, but take care.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Anub'azal spews pheromones onto Monte.''
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Ack!}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Ugh. Why are these pheromones so... gross?}}

Anub'azal has gossip:
{{dialogue|Pheromone marks are temporary ways that we identify groups.

You are now under my command, and those who respect that will let you be.

{{gossip|Can you explain the Pheromones more?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
This must be a{{sic}} odd concept to an outsider. It is very normal to us.

Pheromones are marks that establish relationships between nerubians. The strongest of us have the highest quality pheromones, to show ownership of others. These new 'ascended' nerubians are very strong, yet they lack the ability to make pheromones. Many of the old guard, myself included, have a harder time taking them seriously.

They have a fake, bizarre and manufactured power!

Yet we cannot ignore that they are formidable, and our queen has created potent soldiers. But at what cost? Our heritage of natural pheromones. What else follows that?

{{gossip|Okay.}}
}}}}

Step in the green circle and use the extra action button:
:{{abilities|Apply Pheromones|Masking yourself with Pheromones. Will allow limited access in Siegehold.|notes=2.6 sec cast}}

This turns many, but not all, unfriendly and hostile units in [[Siegehold]] neutral.

The title of the quest is likely a reference to the parody track by {{Wp|"Weird Al" Yankovic}}, '''I Think I'm a Clone Now''', which itself was based on {{Wp|Tiffany Darwish}}'s version of {{Wp|I Think We're Alone Now}}.
