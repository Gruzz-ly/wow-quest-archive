==Objectives==
Find 6 Niffen Arachnologists outside [[Mmarl]] to join [[Rak-Ush]].
* Niffen Arachnologist recruited (6)

==Description==
You need swarmhands, huh?

Last time the [[nerubian]]s wanted our help, they tried to force us.

They're terrible negotiators! All we wanted was a little quid pro quo.

We've got several arachnologists, but most of them are busy keeping the flyers at bay.

Maybe if you lighten their workload, they'll take up your offer.

I'm sure they won't refuse an opportunity to study some swarmbeasts up close and personal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found anyone yet?

==Completion==
See? All we wanted was a little something in exchange.

==Notes==
Arachnologists [[Anisen]], [[Aromash]], [[Limoni]], [[Papriki]], [[Patchoulisa]], and [[Saffrin]] are outside Mmarl observing [[Niffen Defender]]s fighting off [[Intrusive Nothwing]]s. When approached they say one of these lines:
*{{text|say|Hang on, I need to document this fight!}}
*{{text|say|I'm glad I'm not the one that has to handle the business end of those fangs!}}
*{{text|say|Perhaps if they use a different set of weapons... Maybe they'd be able to take them out faster?}}
*{{text|say|Aren't these scouts fascinating up close?}}
*{{text|say|Can you get it to bare its teeth again? I didn't catch it the first time.}}
*{{text|say|I'm not sure if I should just leave them before they're finished...}}
*{{text|say|Oh, I've never been this close to a live specimen before! I can't take my nose away!}}
*{{text|say|Wait! I want to see the creature's demise.}}

After fend the nothwings off, they say one of these lines:
*{{text|say|Getting up close and personal with Rak-Ush's swarmbeasts? Smells exciting!}}
*{{text|say|I'd love to study Rak-Ush's swarmbeasts!}}
*{{text|say|Smells like a great gig!}}
*{{text|say|Well, if Vetiverian says we're not needed here...}}
*{{text|say|Nerubians smell funny, but I'm in!}}
*{{text|say|Our research would be very useful in Rak-Ush.}}
