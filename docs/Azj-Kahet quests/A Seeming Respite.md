==Description==
You have endured quite the evening since your ill-fated little ship ride, haven't you? Worry not, little morsel. You will find that my friends here are most accommodating, even to someone with your predilections--as strange as they may be.

Please, take a moment to explore. Avail yourself of my many amenities. With luck, you will find some sorely-needed rest.

...Oh, but do take care not to move about too quickly. Sudden movements, I'm sure you understand.

==Rewards==

* {{Cost|17|55}}
* 8,700 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[The Weaver's Commendation]] (+2,500 [[reputation]] with [[Weaver (faction)|The Weaver]]) (first time) or 185x [[Kej]] (alts)

==Progress==
There is no need to be afraid! I am almost certain my companions will not eat you.

==Completion==
Well? Are you not impressed with my hospitality?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|You must be quite tired. Take a moment, familiarize yourself with your surroundings. And no doubt you have questions for me, as well.}}
