==Objectives==
Gather rumors about [[Meesk the Venomtongue]] from the denizens of the [[Umbral Bazaar]].
* Information gathered (4)
* [[Torin'zel]] slain

==Description==
I must thank you again for rescuing little [[Spindle]] from her predicament, my morsel. As a reward for your work, I would like to let you take loom and direct the weave of my newest tapestry.

Meesk the Venomtongue threatens my weave-rats. He slanders my Queen. And he lends creedence to Ansurek's campaign of misinformation without a single thought to the consequences.

I believe it is time that I sent Meesk and his ilk a message. Go into the city and find out as much as you can about our 'Venomtongue.'

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}

==Completion==
Kehehe... Indeed? I suppose I should not be surprised that someone as loose-tongued as Meesk holds a fondness for the underground's more banal pleasures.

He is prideful... And he is gluttonous. That should be more than enough for our purposes, I think.

==Notes and trivia==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Meesk spends most of his days drowning in the indulgences on offer in the Umbral Bazaar. No doubt you will find more valuable information on his habits there.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|No doubt there are many in the city who know of him. Why don't you ask around and see what you can learn? Perhaps we will uncover something useful.}}

Talking to [[Remkor]]:
{{Dialogue|If you've got a complaint, go talk to someone else. I'm off duty.

{{Gossip|quest=|Have you heard any rumors about Meesk the Venomtongue?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Remkor|Meesk built his empire on a mountain of corpses. He'll kill or maim anyone to get what he wants. It's why Queen Ansurek likes him so much.}}

Talking to [[Tes'ka]]:
{{Dialogue|Come and look, strange one! We've the finest silks for the fairest prices.

{{Gossip|quest=|Have you heard any rumors about Meesk the Venomtongue?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Tes'ka|Mmh... Look, you did not hear it from me, but Meesk lives by his excesses. You can get him to buy anything with enough praise and flattery. Just take care not to make him angry, or the Queensguard will make all sorts of trouble for you.}}

Talking to [[Tizkren]]:
{{Dialogue|Looking for something frivolous? Or perhaps something farcical? We've many options for the discerning hobbyist.

{{Gossip|quest=|Have you heard any rumors about Meesk the Venomtongue?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Tizkren|Ahh, the "Venomtongue." Meesk thinks trinkets and attention can buy influence, but he has no sense for true craftsmanship.}}
:{{text|say|Tizkren|He is dangerous, but also easily manipulated. I once sold him a common trifle for a queen's ransom! He insisted the article was one of a kind, and I certainly wasn't about to correct him.}}

Talking to [[Torin'zel]]:
{{Dialogue|Oh? Have you come to hear the word of Those Beyond, little worm?

{{Gossip|Quest=| Have you heard any rumors about Meesk the Venomtongue?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Torin'zel|I'm afraid all I can offer you is advice, little one. Has no one ever warned you against speaking to strangers?}}
:''Torin'zel attacks the adventurer.''

The name of the quest is likely a reference to the nursery rhyme {{Wp|Tinker, Tailor}}.
