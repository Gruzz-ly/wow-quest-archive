==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Surek'tak the Sundered.png|Surek'tak the Sundered|High General Zev'kall is about to unleash this malformed upon Hallowfall.}}
Work with [[Faerin]] and [[Gazlowe]] to take down the monstrosity known as Surek'tak the Sundered.
* [[Surek'Tak the Sundered]] slain
* Let Faerin know you're ready

==Description==
I want to honor [[Ryton Blackholme|my friend]]. But first, we need to deal the killing blow to this [[Light]]-forsaken place.

It's known that [[General Zev'kall]] has been overseeing the creation of a monstrosity... a [[void]]-corrupted, malformed [[nerubian]]. The scouting report pinpointed the location at the top of the canyon.

We're going to deprive him of his horrific pet. That should put an end to his plans to invade [[Hallowfall]]. At least for a little while longer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. The [[Hallowfall Arathi|people]] of Hallowfall are in your debt.

I have one last thing to ask if you're willing.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Let's find this corrupted nerubian abomination and finish this.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I'm with ya!}}

Upon reaching the [[Sundered's Crucible]] where [[Surek'Tak the Sundered]] can be found, Zev'kall can be heard talking on a nearby communication device:
:{{text|say|Zev'kall|The queen has such high hopes for you. Do not fail me, Surek'tak.}}
:{{text|say|Zev'kall|Soon. Soon, you will form the vanguard of our invasion.}}
:{{text|say|Zev'kall|I will have her ready on time. Husk yourselves in the name of our queen!}}

Talk to Faerin:
{{dialogue|That thing is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. You still with me on this, <name>?

{{gossip|quest=|Let's finish this!}}
}}
:{{text|say|Zev'kall|Hallowfall will burn in our wake!}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|Look out. That thing's breaking free!}}
:{{text|yell|Surek'Tak the Sundered|Smash you!}}
:{{text|yell|Zev'kall|INTERLOPERS! Destroy them, Surek'Tak!}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|<Name>, let's put an end to Zev'kall's plans. Gazlowe, get that ballista turned around!}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I'm on it. Overwhelming firepower coming right up!}}

During combat Gazlow mains a nearby ballista:
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|Ready!}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|On your mark!}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|If only I had time to add some explosives to this baby.}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|Locked and loaded!}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|Ooh, this is gonna hurt.}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|Just give the word!}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|One giant spear ready to fly!}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|This might pinch a little.}}

Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|By the Holy Flame, how did we survive that?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Let's get out of here. We'll regroup up the path to the west.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|You don't have to tell me twice.}}

Upon catching up with them:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|<Name>, over here!}}
