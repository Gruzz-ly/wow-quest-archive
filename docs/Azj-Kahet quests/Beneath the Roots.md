==Objectives==
Find the camp sheltering the [[Aeroknights]] in western [[Azj-Kahet|Azj'kahet]]{{sic}}.

==Description==
I am glad to see you are well, <name>. I have recently received word that a number of the Aeroknights have taken shelter in a camp close to where the airship was seized in mid-air. 

Would you check on them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We are doing our best with what we have. The owners of this camp have allowed us sanctuary, but there are no smiles here.
