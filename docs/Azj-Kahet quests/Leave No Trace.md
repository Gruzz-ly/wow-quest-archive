==Objectives==
Collect 10 Magic Traces into Hannan's Scythe.
* [[Magic Trace]] collected (10)
* [[Hannan's Scythe]] (provided)

==Description==
I need to go make sure she's all right. What I saw in that cave... If she's more sensitive to this...

<[[Hannan]] nearly growls.>

But she's making a mess out here, drawing attention and leaving a trail leading outsiders right to her! Right to us.

We're supposed to be subtle. Unseen. Keep to the brush, hide in our other forms as much as possible.

I hate to ask this of you, but can you use my scythe to take care of the evidence while I check on her?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's forbidden for me to talk to outsiders, but... you have been helpful.

Thank you for aiding me with this burden.

==Notes==
Upon accept:  
:{{text|say|Hannan|Use this to collect the traces of Orweyna's magic along her trail. I'll go make sure she's all right.}}

Upon reaching Hannan and Orweyna:  
:{{text|say|Hannan|Orweyna... How can I help?}}

Hannan's gossip:
{{dialogue|I hate seeing Orweyna in such distress. But I don't know how to get through to her.

She thinks she has to do everything herself. She sees that corruption out there as her responsibility. Her burden.

But we're not prepared to take this on. We're not even supposed to be here.

{{gossip|Ask Hannan why you had to cover Orweyna's tracks.}}

{{dialogue-child|We cannot allow the traces of Orweyna's magic to linger here. It could reveal our very existence.

We are forbidden from interacting with outsiders. What we are doing here... it is...

I cannot explain more. Please, try to accept that.}}

Orweyna's gossip:
{{dialogue|My head spins with the echoes of this dissonance. Such a grave threat to the roots--

<Orweyna cuts herself off with a growl.>}}
