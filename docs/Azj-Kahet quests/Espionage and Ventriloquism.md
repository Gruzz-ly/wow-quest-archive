==Objectives==<!-- Some of these likely belong to Notes. -->
Investigate The Puppetmaster's Workshop.
* Investigate the [[Puppetmaster's Workshop]]
* Web Scraps cleared (4)
* Supplies organized (3)
* [[Paralytic Draught]] 
* [[Unsettled Vermin]] slain (12)

==Description==
[[The Puppetmaster]] is our best lead for finding [[High Elevator Etak'kaht|the Magistrate]].

But is it just me, or did those puppets seem... horrifically lifelike? If this artist is behind the Magistrate's disappearance, he certainly isn't just off to see a puppet show.

We should investigate The Puppetmaster's workshop. Question him, or at least ransack his things. Just a bit. Until we find something useful.

You'll have to keep playing your rather undignified role in this charade. But it will pay off for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Orator Tx'itk lowers her voice.>

Something isn't right here. Play along just a while longer. Let's see what else we can find.

==Completion==
The Magistrate is definitely in danger. We must act quickly before I lose my chance at Ascension.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Time to intrude on an artist at work. Come along, friend! We have important intel to glean.}}

Go to the [[Puppetmaster's Workshop]]:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|I heard a rumor--}}
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|A moment. And your lovely pet can clean while we discuss.}}
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|There we are. Now, what would you ask of me?}}

Upon clearing four Web Scraps:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|I'm looking for the Magistrate. Have you seen him?}}
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|Hmm? Ah, I'm rather distracted. Your pet has magnificent bone structure.}}

Upon organizing two supplies:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Have you heard anything of the missing Magistrate?}}
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|Missing? That cannot be right. I've seen him quite recently. Mmm, your pet has the most fascinating sinews.}}

Upon organizing the third one:
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|Ah, its graceful movements seem to have lured out the vermin.}}
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|Clean up your mess, pet. That paralytic draught should help.}}

Upon picking up the Paralyzing Draught:
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|Lovely. Now, a proposal for you, dear Orator. Join me in my theater when your pet is done here. Bring it along.}}
:{{text|say|The Puppetmaster|If you can free the Magistrate, you may have him. If not... I get to take your pet.}}

Upon using the draught on the vermin:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|He's gone. Finally. And we know he has the Magistrate.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|That paralytic must be how he's turning people into puppets.}}
