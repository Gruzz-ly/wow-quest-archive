==Objectives==
Find [[Ag'thax]]'s missing key in [[Pillar-nest Xesh]].
* [[High Hollows Key]]

==Description==
Why, hello there, little <race>. You seem like you might be able to assist me.

You see, my dear mate [[Ami'thax]] fell onto a sharp dagger. Her body was taken to Pillar-nest Xesh, just below where we stand. Xesh is used to dispose of all sorts of bodies that we never speak of again.

Unfortunately, I have need to speak of Ami'thax, because she had the key to my new [[High Hollows]] burrow on her when she died. Dreadful timing, really. Would you go and fetch it?

Do beware of the spiders, I need my key.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't let the spiders eat you before you escape with my key.

==Completion==
I don't want to hear about where you found it, I have no need for the details.

I am very excited to move into my High Hollows burrow!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ag'thax says|You are not the first I have sent on this quest, but you seem more competent. Hurry back with my key!}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Ag'thax says|Hopefully your friends will not have any unfortunate accidents while they are here.}}
:{{text|say|Ag'thax says|But if they do, have a lackey to collect items you fancy from Xesh.}}

==Progression==
{{Pillar-nest of Horrors}}
