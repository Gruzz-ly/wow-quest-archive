==Notes==
[[Ykl "Bob" Zn]] and [[Zkl "Sally" Zn]], "disguised" as [[Arathi]] insurgents, join the adventurer on the skiff. Ykl says a number of lines on approach:
*{{text|say|Ykl "Bob" Zn|<Name>, where is your disguise? We came in guises of Arathi as instructed. You will ruin our carefully made cover.}}
*{{text|say|Ykl "Bob" Zn|Behold my great stick of flame and light. I am an Arathi! Can you not tell by my metal chitin and invader's smile?}}
*{{text|say|Ykl "Bob" Zn|Behold the fuzzy mustache I have acquired.}}
*{{text|say|Ykl "Bob" Zn|Greetings, my fellow Arathnid.}}

Use the skiff's abilities to kill [[Skittershaw]]s, [[Convoy Protector]]s, [[Convoy Leader]]s, [[Chitin Commander]]s, and [[Skitterling]]s.
