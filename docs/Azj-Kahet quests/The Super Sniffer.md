==Objectives==
Travel to [[Mmarl]] in [[Azj-Kahet]] in [[Khaz Algar]] and find a willing [[niffen]] to help in the [[Oasis]].
* [[Momma Nilla|Find a niffen]] who can help {{co|77.9|63.0|Azj-Kahet}}
* Convince [[Rhubarn]] to come with you

==Description==
It appears the [[slateback]]s are not secreting the correct pheromones, resulting in them not breeding. 

We believe this is a side effect of the stasis. The technology was never tested for such an extreme length of time. Until now. 

Hemet tells me there are creatures called niffen in Azeroth that have expertise in this research. Bring me one from Azj-Kahet. You can use my portal to quickly get there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm smellin' opportunity all over you!

==Completion==
Good hagglin'! Let's get this transaction underway!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Ensure that you find the best concocter of fragrance in your world. I only work with excellence.}}

Ven'ari opens a Portal to Mmarl on the other side of the pavilion, which drops players off at [{co|76.9|64.5|Azj-Kahet}} next to the flight master in town. Enter the [[Rock Bottom Inn]] and check in with [[Momma Nilla]], the innkeeper:
{{dialogue|
Welcome to my inn, weary traveler. What can I do for you?

{{gossip|quest=|Greetings. I'm looking for a master in making smells.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Momma Nilla|Oh, you'll be wanting Rhubarn then. Watch out for his haggling!}}

Find [[Rhubarn]], the Grand Sniffmaster, outside the inn to the north:
{{dialogue|
<Rhubarn sniffs the air.>

Yer comin' to me from a long ways away, traveler. What can I do's for ya?

{{gossip|quest=|I need a scent made. For a creature. On another planet.}}

Oh ho ho! Do ya now buddy?

I can't just be whipping up any old scent for ya--I gots to go sniff the merchandise! 

And if you're asking me to leave my shop, that's going to cost ya!

{{gossip|quest=|How much?}}

I have to take into account that my apprentice will take over while I'm gone, so I have to make sure he's well set up... And then taking into account my expenses...

<Rhubarn taps his finders together as though counting.>

About one thousand bug bits and mushrooms.

''Option set one: don't haggle / one bug bit.''

{{gossip|quest=|I really don't want to haggle with you.}}
{{dialogue-child|
Just a friendly bit of bartering, traveler. Nothing more!

Five hundred bug bits and mushrooms?
}}

{{gossip|quest=|One bug bit, and half a mushroom.}}
{{dialogue-child|
I like your gumption, but I may as well close up my shop I'd be making such a loss!

I'd have to let poor Gharrli go. Do you want Gharrli's potential children to have their father lose his job?

Five hundred bug bits and mushrooms?
}}

''Option set two: sigh / seven bug bits.''

{{gossip|quest=|<Sigh in a frustrated manner.>}}
{{dialogue-child|
Oh hey now--no need for that. We're all friends here!

How about one hundred bug bits and mushrooms... in total?}}

{{gossip|quest=|Seven bug bits and mushrooms, and no more than three of either.}}
{{dialogue-child|
Seven? Seven?!

I'd never be able to show my face in Mmarl again taking a price that low. People would walk past and say "There goes Rhubarn. I heard he bankrupted himself. Poor Rhubarn--alone, destitute, unloved, and unwanted by kith kind."

One hundred bug bits and mushrooms, in total. Fifty-fifty.
}}

''Option set three: move to leave / twenty and five''

{{gossip|quest=|<Move as if to leave.>}}
{{dialogue-child|
Wait. Wait!

Ok, and I'm slicing my own pie here. Fifty bug bits, and nine mushrooms?

{{gossip|quest=|Deal.}}
}}

{{gossip|quest=|Twenty bug bits and five mushrooms.}}
{{dialogue-child|
You drive a hard bargain!

Fifty bug bits, and nine mushrooms. And I'm cutting my own throat here!

{{gossip|quest=|Deal.}}
}}
}}

Pick any options, as the result doesn't change. After the quest, Rhubarn has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Sure didn't wake up expectin' to go on an adventure today!}}
