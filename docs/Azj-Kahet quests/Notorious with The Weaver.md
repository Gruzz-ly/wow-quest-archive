==Description==
Many many thanks for you from the Weave-mother. Come back to the Lair. I have good goods for you. I have webbed up and protected them, so no you worry!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[The Weaver's Trove]]
*[[The Severed Threads Commendation]]

==Completion==
Keep up the good good!

The [[Widow Arak'nai|Weaver]] also asks us to give you her "compliments," but I find no "compliments" in here.

Maybe I ate them? Apologies!
