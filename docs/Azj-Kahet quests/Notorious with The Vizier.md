==Description==
The [[Vizier]] has asked me to provide you with additional resources towards your efforts. Come to the [[Weaver's Lair]]. I'll be waiting for you with a parcel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[The Vizier's Trove]]
*[[The Severed Threads Commendation]]

==Completion==
The Vizier's compliments should be a more than sufficient gift for you...

But I suppose these goods would simply go to waste if not for his generosity. Take them. Be grateful.

And do try to remain alive, overcrawler.
