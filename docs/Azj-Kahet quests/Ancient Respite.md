==Objectives==
Kill 15 Feasting Mites for [[Goehi]].
* [[Feasting Mite]] slain (15)

==Description==
This was once a great lake. Over time the roots ruptured its floor, and drained the water away. I have lived here for all of my lifetime and witnessed it all. But now, darker changes have come.

Sometimes changes comes with death. Decay is natural.

But the mites that feed upon my people are not. They spread an odd infestation that makes my bark feel like it crawls from my body.

Destroy these mites, so that I may rest without fear of their mouths upon my sleeping form.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The sound of their gnawing fills me with dread.

==Completion==
It is quiet. Perhaps I will rest, now, with my people.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Goehi|I know not what causes the mites to feast so. Only that they are loud, and I wish to rest.}}

==Progression==
