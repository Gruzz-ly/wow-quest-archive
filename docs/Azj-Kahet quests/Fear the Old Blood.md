==Objectives==
Work to cleanse the [[Breathing Pit]].
* The Breathing Pit Cleansed (0/100%)

==Description==
This is not exactly the place for a long talk, so I will be brief.

[[Great roots|These roots]] you see are part of something much greater than you know, and it is my job to protect them.

If it isn't obvious to you already, this place is teeming with writhing [[Black Blood]]. If we do not act, it will spread deeper and further still.

You want allies? Fine. Help me cleanse this place and protect these roots, and I will at least hear you out.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of:
* [[Corrosive Blackblood Ring]]
* [[Hissing Blackblood Ring]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Between your sweat and my spellwork, we've managed to at least contain the problem to this blighted cavern.

Still, what a disaster. If this is what one cave of the stuff can do, I shudder to think what the nerubians might do with more of it.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|The Black Blood is dangerous. Especially in nerubian hands.}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|End their efforts here. I will meet you above... if you survive again.}}
:''Orweyna shifts to bat form and flies off.''

[[File:Fear the Old Blood - end.jpg|thumb|Orweyna and her fellow haranir.]]
Kill a path to the surface, destroying [[Nerubian Extractor]]s along the way. Back on the surface:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|So you made it out alive. I knew I was right about you.}}
:''Four bats arrive and shift into [[haranir]]: [[Hannan]], [[Kai'shae]], [[Ney'leia]], and [[On'hiea]].''
:{{Text|say|On'hiea|You have shown your true form? Orweyna, this is forbidden!}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|The Black Blood spreads deeper every day. We need their aid--}}
:{{Text|say|On'hiea|We need nothing from them!}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|Enough!}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|We both know our charge. They are of this world. And they too seek to defend it.}}
:{{Text|say|Ney'leia|On'hiea, she speaks with the [[Radiant Song|song of the world]]. You know it, as do I.}}
:{{Text|say|On'hiea|The others will hear of this.}}
:{{Text|say|Ney'leia|At least it will not be the first tradition we have broken.}}
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|Go. All of you. I will join you soon.}}
:''The haranir turn back into bats and fly off again.''
