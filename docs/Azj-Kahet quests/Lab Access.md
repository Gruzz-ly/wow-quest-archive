==Objectives==
Collect 6 Loyalist Secretions from [[nerubian]] loyalists in the [[Transformatory]] area.
*[[Loyalist Secretions]] (6)

==Description==
As much as I adore skulking in the shadows, the juiciest intel is going to be inside the laboratory of the [[Izo, the Grand Splicer|Grand Splicer]].

Of course you'll need the proper pheromones once you're in, but we can take care of that with a little biological forgery.

The nerubian loyalists here are surely on the invite list. Six of their secretions should be enough to disguise the three of us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
If you saw me? No you didn't.

==Completion==
Finally! I was waiting for when we'd stumble upon the real intrigue.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|If those Ascended guards get close, hit 'em with one of these vials. It'll provide a... distraction.}}
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|They don't look tough--I'm sure you'll be fine. Enjoy slinking around, I'll be walking right in.}}
:{{text|emote|Y'tekhi winks at you.}}
:''They walk off.''

Before heading out, Y'tekhi has gossip:
{{dialogue|Mm?

{{gossip|How do these aggression pheromones work?}}

They are... experimental. 

Any trueborn nerubian who catches a whiff of them will become incandescantly angry and feel compelled to attack.

You can see the utility in warfare, but also the potential for friendly fire. I'm not surprised they never saw widespread use.

{{gossip|How did you get them?}}

They fell off a rickshaw, of course. Lucky for us, mm?

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}}}

While on these quests, players have an extra action button:
:{{abilities|Vial of Aggression Pheromone|Pelt a patrolling guard with anger pheromones to temporarily distract them. {{text|red|Not available while in combat.}}|range=35|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant}}

Use it on [[Ascended Webwarden]]s while killing enemies and scouting areas. [[Loyalist Bio-smith]]s and [[Loyalist Mutagenician]]s drop [[Loyalist Secretions]].

Y'tekhi has new gossip after completing the quest:
{{dialogue|Usually I like surprises, but this is a bit much.}}
