==Objectives==
Slay 8 Dyeworks nerubians using the powers granted by Augmented Dyebaths.
* Dyeworks [[nerubian]]s slain (8)
* [[Red Dyebath]] tested
* [[Purple Dyebath]] tested
* [[Blue Dyebath]] tested
* [[Yellow Dyebath]] tested
* [[Green Dyebath]] tested

==Description==
I thought playing them against each other would give me some cover, but it's plunged all of [[Rak-Ahat]] into chaos! This could jeopardize our whole operation!

You heard what [[Grand Overspinner Antourix|Antourix]] said. She already augmented the dyebaths will all those reagents you collected. I don't know what they'll do, but if she was planning on using them against [[Ren'khat]]... there's no reason you couldn't use them to take out both of their goons.

Test out those dyebaths, and clear out the dyeworks!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wanted less squabbling interfering with my work, not more!

==Completion==
Some equipment broken, some laborers scared... but most importantly, all of their lackeys are out of the way. I'll take that as a victory.

==Notes==
Teth's gossip:
{{dialogue|The dyeworks is the most precarious location in Rak-Ahat... but also the most glamorous. I'm not surprised this is all happening here.}}

On accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Teth|Do what you need to do. I'll go back to my shipping post and pretend I didn't see any of it.}}
:{{text|say|Teth|Afterwards, we'll see who ends up in charge of Rak-Ahat... what's left of it, anyway.}}

Kill [[Spinneret Scuttler]]s, [[Violet Alchemist]]s, [[Carmine Alchemist]]s, [[Cerulean Alchemist]]s, [[Spinneret Silkbearer]]s, [[Cupric Alchemist]]s, [[Gaudy Web-Vandal]]s, and [[Ochre Alchemist]]s.

Upon returning to Teth:
:{{text|say|Teth|Given how colorful you are, I assume the dyeworks was a success?}}
