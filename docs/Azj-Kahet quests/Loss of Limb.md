==Objectives==

* Speak with [[Vi'azl]]

* Comfort Vi'azl
* Speak with Vi'azl

==Description==
;Normal description
Happy greetings! I am Mr. Sunflower, and this is my tea room and therapy space. It is safe place for everyone!

I wonder if you might be willing to help a patient of mine. Vi'azl is deathly afraid of creatures with fewer limbs. I think it has grown into a deep phobia of dismemberment. I'm trying to get to the bottom of this diagnosis.

Would you speak to him, and demonstrate that you, who does not have eight limbs, are not so terrifying after all?

;If the player has completed [[Successful Interventions]]:

Happy greetings! It is so nice to see you again, <name>. This is my new tea room and therapy space. It is a safe place for everyone!

You helped Ralph before, and I wonder if you might be willing to help another patient of mine. Vi'azl is deathly afraid of creatures with fewer limbs. I think it has grown into a deep phobia of dismemberment. I'm trying to get to the bottom of this diagnosis.

Would you be willing to speak to him, and demonstrate that you, who does not have eight limbs, are not so terrifying after all?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Vee'azel must have some terrible trauma related to creatures with fewer limbs. We must help him.

==Completion==
Oh dear. This is so much worse than I had originally diagnosed.

==Notes==
Mr. Sunflower is found in [[Unraveler's Theraputician]], also in the place one can find [[Mr. Sunflower's Patient]]s,[[Vi'azl]] and [[Carlos]] the therapy cat:

If [[Successful Interventions]] has been completed Mr. Sunflower says this upon approach:
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|<Name>! Is it you? From Zaralek Cavern. Do you remember me?}}

{{dialogue|Good morning! Isn't it a delightful day to be alive?

{{gossip|Is that a therapy cat?}}
{{dialogue-child|Yes, I am hopeful to use the creature to help Vi. I had it imported for this special use!

Though it has been a challenge to remind others that the cat is not a comfort food...

{{gossip|Thanks for the update.}}}}

Gossip option available if [[Successful Interventions]] has been completed:

{{Gossip|quest=|How is Ralph doing?}}
{{dialogue-child|Ralph had a brief relapse after his session with the group in Zaralek Caverns, but we don't ask for perfection. He is a better version of himself today, and I am very proud of him.

More importantly, I know he is proud of himself, too.

{{Gossip|That's great!}}
}}

Mr. Sunflower's patients' gossip:

{{dialogue|Oh, hello there. Are you here for Mr. Sunflower's therapy?

I am processing my social anxiety by helping greet everyone that comes in!}}

{{dialogue|I came for couples therapy, but my other half didn't show up.

Mr. Sunflower says perhaps I should move on. I think I agree.}}

{{dialogue|How can I help you? Would you like some tea? Or perhaps a massage?

Oh spindles! I have to stop doing that. Never mind! Boundaries! Very sorry.}}

{{dialogue|Nosy, aren't you? My problems with trust issues are private, overcrawler.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Wonderful! Come this way. Use your most friendly voice, if you please.}}

Talk to Vi'azl:
{{dialogue|Aghhh! No! No, no, please! Where are your limbs?

<Vi'azl seems to be very terrified of you.>

Who tore off your legs? Please, don't come any closer!

{{gossip|quest=|I'm just here to talk.}}

{{gossip|quest=|There's no need to hide.}}

{{gossip|quest=|Let's be friends.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Vi'azl|Ack! No! No, get away!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|It's all right, Vi'azl! <Name> is nice!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Oh dear, this is too much for him.}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|<Name>, drink the threat reducing potion from my tea table. Let's see if that makes you less frightening.}}

Go drink the potion which makes you tiny and talk to Vi'azl again:
{{dialogue|
<Vi'azl has all of his many eyes shut very tightly.>

{{gossip|quest=|I'm tiny now. Is this better?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Vi'azl|No! Your limbs! Where are they? No no no! Leave me alone!}}
:''Vi'azl runs away.''
:{{text|yell|Mr. Sunflower|Wait, Vi!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Goodness me, that didn't help, did it. Let's follow, and make sure he's all right!}}

Find Vi'azl and Mr. Sunflower in the [[Burrows]]:
{{dialogue|
<Vi'azl is shivering with fear.>

No no no... he'll break my legs again if I speak of this!

{{gossip|quest=|Tell us what's going on, Vi'azl.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Vi'azl|It is... my superior, Vek'kix. Ever since he Ascended, he has become brutal. If we are too slow, he breaks our limbs. Sometimes... sometimes he even pulls them off!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|I... oh dear. Oh dear.}}
