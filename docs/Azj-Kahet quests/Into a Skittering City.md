==Objectives==
Tell [[Executor Nizrek|the Vizier]] of [[Widow Arak'nai|The Weaver]]'s plan, and apply Pheromones for access to the [[Umbral Bazaar]].
* Speak with the Vizier
* Have [[Tulumun]] apply the Pheromones

==Description==
I sent these 'invitations' to you and [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]], both. I'd have bet [[Shalamayne|my father's sword]] you wouldn't let such a unique opportunity pass you by--it's what sets you apart from us all. Alleria, however...

Nevermind. She's as cautious as she is assertive. I suppose I was hoping for the latter, but it's the former that's kept her alive.

Perhaps she'll find us later on. For now, it's time you and my new acquaintance properly meet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
For being so young, I find Master Anduin is practically bursting with the grand experiences of a much more traveled sort.

Impressive. At least from the perspective of a humble Kaheti.

==Completion==
Quite the entrance. I should replicate it in the next cabinet meeting.

<Nizrek emits a cough you imagine might be a chuckle.>

Perhaps we should give them a private moment. Whilst we let them have it, would you hear out a small request of mine?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Executor Nizrek is one of Queen Ansurek's closest confidants.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Or so she surmises.}}

Speak with Nizrek:
{{Dialogue|I understand that you have not only entered into an alliance with the Weaver, but that you've also parlayed with our famed [[Anub'azal|General Anub'azal]] as
well.

If I were to commit my own resources, we three elderly nerubians would make quite the formidable triumvirate.

The players and the board are set. Now tell me, <name>, what game do they wish to play?

{{gossip|quest=|The Weaver wants to take out Xal'atath and free Queen Ansurek from her influence.}}}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Time is short. Here are pheromones that will allow you into the Bazaar. Apply them.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Xal'atath is a problem to be certain, but the Queen is not being influenced. She has made a choice she believes in.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|The Weaver will not be pleased, but Ansurek must also be eliminated.}}

Head over to [[Tulumun]] and use the extra action button:
:{{abilities|Apply Pheromones|The Vizier's Assistant, Tulumun, will adjust your Pheromone sequence to allow you access to the Umbral Bazaar.|notes=7 sec channel|id=445014|icon=inv_10_alchemy_bottle_shape1_orange}}

Once the channel finishes, Alleria runs in and starts pulls back her bow:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Back away from him, creature! Now!}}
:''Anduin runs over to place himself between Alleria and Nizrek.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Listen to me and lower your bow. He's an ally.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|An ally? Dalaran fell because of them!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria. We can end this war! But not if you loose that arrow.}}
:''She puts her bow away.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Fine. But you best have a good explanation for this.}}
