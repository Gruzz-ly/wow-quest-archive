==Objectives==
Go to the [[Widow Arak'nai]] in the [[Weaver's Lair]].

==Description==
This weave-rat carries a note upon its body. It's addressed to you, from the Widow Arak'nai.

"Dearest morsel,

Myself and the other members of our [[Severed Threads]] triumvirate request your presence. [[Azj-Kahet]] itself is on the precipice of an evolution, but we'll need your... unique methods if we're to see it through.

And, as always, the rewards to you and your cause will be quite magnificent."

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for making the trip back down to my humble lair.

<A deep chuckle rumbles out from Widow Arak'nai.>

We have got grand plans in store for you. Certainly, certainly.
