==Objectives==
Steal the pheromones and prepare to sneak them out of [[Siegehold]].
* [[Zev'kall's Pheromone Emitter]] {{co|48.4|20.2|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
These logs of [[Zev'kall]]'s... he is wasting numerous [[nerubian]] lives. Throwing them away like some rabid [[mantid]].

We must act. As I said, Zev'kall doesn't produce his own pheromone marks anymore due to this 'ascension' process. He's been forced to use mine. His alchemist is trying to concoct some for him... but once they do, what of me?

Take those false pheromones and sneak them out of Siegehold. Expose Zev'kall, use them... you're creative, aren't you? Just make it messy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|46|80}}
* 14,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What did the General ask you to do?

==Completion==
Smuggle these out? Hmm.

I bet we can use these later, but... if we need to, we'll use them to escape.

Hopefully it won't come to that.

==Notes==
To the northeast in a small room, find [[Tij'allet]], the Zev'kall enforcer, about to kill a [[Siegehold Alchemist]]:
:{{text|say|Siegehold Alchemist|Wait, please!}}
:{{text|say|Tij'allet|You've made Zev'kall's pheromones. There is no further need for you!}}

Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Tij'allet|Death to you!}}

Defeat Tij'allet:
:{{text|say|Tij'allet|The general's head will... roll..}}
:{{text|say|Siegehold Alchemist|Keep those pheromones out of Zev'kall's hands. It should buy Anub'azal more time.}}
