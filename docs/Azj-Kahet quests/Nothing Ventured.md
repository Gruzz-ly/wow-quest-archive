'''Nothing Ventured''' starts an optional chapter of the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]]. After freeing [[Monte Gazlowe]] in [[The General's Consensus]] during the main campaign, he relocates to [[Mmarl]], where he starts this quest.

==Objectives==
Learn what you can from the goblins in [[Mmarl]].
* Speak to Mmarl Goblins (3)
* Speak to the Goblin Leader

==Description==
These [[niffen]] have been down here a long time--long enough to build a village and set up trade with the [[nerubian]]s. Some of them are even able to trade in that [[City of Threads|big nerubian city]]!

The goblins, though? They're from the [[Venture Company]]. No wonder [[Anub'azal|General Anub'azal]] was skeptical of me, if he's used to dealing with them.

What are they doing all the way down here? Let's try to learn what led them to this place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Take a good look around for loose-lipped goblins.

==Completion==
At least they're willing to talk to you, even if they are rude. Maybe you can convince them working together is mutually beneficial.

Try something a little... transactional. They'll appreciate that.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|<name>, got a minute?}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|This place is crawling with Venture Company goblins.}}

Before accepting, Gazlowe has new gossip:

{{dialogue|title=[[Monte Gazlowe]]|Look, I can't get anywhere with the Venture Company. Maybe you'll have a little more luck, eh?

{{gossip|What are you doing here in Azj-Kahet, again?}}

I came down here to Azj-Kahet with a group of Pathfinders and a contingent of Horde defenders. We were intending to use a tunnel we found against the nerubians. Smart, huh? Not so much.

We got down here, they ambushed us, and we were all dragged to Siegehold. Fortunately, I was hidden inside my mech, so they didn't realize I was there--or so I thought.

Anyway, I saw a bunch of people from Dalaran. Looks like Siegehold is where they haul all their prisoners before they get moved to the main city.

When I check back in with everyone, I know they're gonna have questions about these goblins down here. I'm gonna need some answers first.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I'm gonna go listen around. They won't talk to me, but maybe I can catch them chatting with each other. Meet me at the inn when you're done.}}

Goblins are marked on the minimap.
{{Dialogue|title=[[Sammy Fizzvolt]]|I placed a bet. I'm feelin' good about it.

{{gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the goblins here?}}}}
:{{text|say|Sammy Fizzvolt|I bet Thad that we'd die in the tunnels when we dug our way into Azj-Kahet. That's the only bet I'm glad I lost!}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Murfie]]|You look like you gotta story to tell, stranger. Trust me, whatever you throw down, I guarantee I've heard worse.

So go on. Pony up to the bar and tell me all about it.

{{gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the goblins here?}}}}
:{{text|say|Murfie|We get the occasional niffen, but most of my customers are Venture Company. Every day it's another story about a bad boss--[[Jenni Boombuckle]]'s a name I hear a lot. But hey, at least they keep [[Corby Taps|Corby]] in business!}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Grigg]]|I keep the pool to a reasonable level of filthy.

{{gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the goblins here?}}}}
:{{text|say|Grigg|Pool Boys LLC is really just a subsidiary of the Venture Company. Everybody here toes the line, whether they admit it or not.}}

After speaking with all three, head to the inn:
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Oh hey, Jenni, look! Some newcomers! Hullo there!}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|Don't change the subject, Rhubarn! It's rude.}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Ruder to ignore a new friend, isn't it?}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Rhubarn]]|I don't want to be rude, but these goblins are tryin' my last whisker of patience!}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Jenni Boombuckle]]|I'm tired of troubleshootin' all these problems...

{{gossip|quest=|Are you in charge here?}}}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|Yeah, I'm the boss around here. Why, you got a problem? Too bad. I don't care.}}

{{Haggling with Mmarl}}
