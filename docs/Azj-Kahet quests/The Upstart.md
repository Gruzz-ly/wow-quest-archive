==Objectives==
Offer your services to Ren'khat against [[Grand Overspinner Antourix]].
* Ingratiate yourself to [[Ren'khat|Ren'htak]]{{sic}}

==Description==
You are the Weaver's "untethered third party?" Excellent. You are the perfect catalyst for a coup.

The [[City of Threads]] has sent an upstart here to seize control of [[Rak-Ahat]].

The arrival of Ren'khat has everything all tangled up. He postures himself as some kind of silk visionary from the city, and he challenges the authority of the Overspinner who refused to relinquish control.

Bad for the Overspinner, good for us. Speak with Ren'khat and feed his ambition. Help him against the Overspinner.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|17|55}}
* 8,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What is this? An overcrawler? Here?

==Completion==
You... you are willing to help me achieve the brilliance of my art?

And you have no ties that could be traced back to me?

Perfect!

==Notes==
Upon approaching Teth:
:{{Text|say|Teth|Ah! You must be here to help with the... special shipments.}}

Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Teth|Grand Overspinner Antourix is usually busy overseeing the whole of Rak-Ahat, in her office to the east.}}
:{{text|say|Teth|Ren'khat has set up behind the western warehouse... I don't know if you could call it an office, really.}}
:{{text|say|Teth|More of a sad collection of discount furniture.}}

Upon approaching [[Ren'khat]] in [[Rak-Ahat]]:
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|I told you not to trouble me with more logistics, can't you see I'm ideating?}}
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|Oh. You're no skitterling.}}

Ren'khat's gossip:
{{dialogue|What is it? As you can see I'm very busy with very, VERY important work.

{{Gossip|quest=|I hear you're looking to stick it to the Overspinner.}}

{{Gossip|quest=|You are much more fashionable than the Overspinner.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|Is it obvious? Just look at me! I deserve to rule this place.}}
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|That dusty old bat is so drab... it's past time for a new direction.}}
