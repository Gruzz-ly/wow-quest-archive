==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Y'tekhi void.jpg|Y'tekhi|Y'tekhi is not themselves.}}

Subdue Y'tekhi.
*[[Y'tekhi]] subdued
*Y'tekhi brought to safety

==Description==
We lost Y'tekhi.

We can worry about the how of it later. Right now, we need to worry about taking them down before they make things worse.

<[[Lilian Voss|Lilian]] snorts.>

I guess we came down here to find out what [[Xal'atath]] had up her sleeve. ...I wish we'd minded our own business.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Hard to think of how this could have gone any worse.

==Completion==
We're out of the public eye, for a moment.

Getting Y'tekhi back to the [[Widow Arak'nai|Weaver]] is my priority. Yours is dealing with the weapons.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Y'tekhi is... not themselves. We need to do something.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|You stop them. I've got your back.}}
:''Voss drops into stealth and sneaks behind Y'tekhi.''

Aggro them:
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|You? You are a worm! She will devour everything!}}

Get her to 90%:
:{{text|yell|Xal'atath|Too late!}}
:''Y'tekhi teleports away.''

[[Mesmerized Civillian]]s{{sic}} start attacking. Fend them off too!

At 50%:
:{{text|yell|Xal'atath|Haha! Ahahaha!}}

Get them to 10%:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Easy there, agent.}}
:''Voss picks up Y'tekhi and runs off.''
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Let's get them away from prying eyes. Figure out our next move.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|In all the excitement, I nearly forgot we had a weapons convoy to deal with.}}

Voss also has new gossip:
{{dialogue|We need to think. This is bad, but not that bad. Which means it could still get worse.}}
