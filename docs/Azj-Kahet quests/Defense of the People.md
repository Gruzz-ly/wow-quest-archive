==Objectives==
Free 5 citizens in the [[Burrows]].
* Burrows Residents rescued (5)

==Description==
[[Executor Nizrek|The Vizier]] no doubt filled you in on some of the details. Citizens in the Burrows are missing, that much you know. 

But whispers on the wind tell a bigger story. Our citizens are being taken to the [[Transformatory]] and never returned!

We must stop this at all costs. More have been taken but it's not too late for them yet. They are still being kept in the Burrows. Find them and free them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Act swiftly, we may not have long before they are beyond our grasp.

==Completion==
The citizens of the Burrows are in your debt. Good work.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out. Focus on Defense of the People and head to the marked location in the Burrows, the Warehouse. Inside at {{co|44.7|49.1|City of Threads||1}} is [[Mus'ten]], trapped in a web.

Far to the southwest at {{co|38.2|59.5|City of Threads||1}} is [[Srax'run]]:
:{{text|say|Srax'run|The abductors came from nowhere. I didn't think the rumors were true!}}

Inside the building immediately to the west at {{co|36.9|57.7|City of Threads||1}} is [[Gruthit]]:
:{{text|say|Gruthit|I came to the Burrows when I had nowhere else to go. Now where do I go? Nowhere is safe.}}

Finally, at the southeast end of the Burrows at {{co|44.2|68.2|City of Threads||1}} is [[Tihk'ot]]:
:{{text|say|Tihk'ot|I'm heading back to the Inn where it's safe.}}
