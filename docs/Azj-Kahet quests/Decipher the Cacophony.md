==Objectives==
Collect 10 Discordant Essence from Discordant enemies in the [[Unseeming]].
* [[Discordant Essence]] (10)

==Description==
This is far worse than I thought. It's as if they're feeding the corruption. Encouraging it. The dissonance growing louder and louder...

<Orweyna seems shaken, but not deterred.>

I can hardly hear anything else. My head is pounding. I... I need to see how far gone this land truly is.

<Name>. Bring me something from the Unseeming.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have the [[nerubian]]s done to this place?

==Completion==
This is wrong. This is all wrong.

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:  
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Just... look at all this. This place is an abomination.}}  
:{{text|say|Orweyna|I need a glimpse of what exists beyond our eyes. I need to know the extent of the damage that has already been done.}}  
:{{text|say|Hannan|When I asked how I could help, I didn't mean any of us going down there!}}

==Progression==
{{Melody of Madness}}
