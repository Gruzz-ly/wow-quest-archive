==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Abductor Arzda.png|Abductor Arzda|The leader of the Abductors who have been terrorizing the citizens of the Burrows. A non-native to Azj-Kahet who's purpose is as shrouded as their appearance.}}
Kill the Master Abductor.
* [[Abductor Arzda|Master Abductor]] slain {{co|55.6|54.8|City of Threads||1}}

==Description==
While you have been out, I've been keeping busy as well. 

Your exploits in the [[Burrows]] drew the attention of someone much higher up. A strange being wrapped in bandages, with a scent like despair.

Fortunately, this unusual monster is paying a visit all the way down in the Burrows to find out why their abductors are missing. Now is our chance to strike, and take down this whole operation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 14,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Soon the Burrows will be free.

==Completion==
The word of your exploits has reached all the way up here. A sign of a good job.

==Notes==
On approach:

:{{text|say|Nexus-Princess Ky'veza|Queen Ansurek grows more volatile by the day. We must tread carefully.}}
:{{text|say|Abductor Arzda|I will not fail, princess.}}
