==Objectives==
Find Spindle in the High Hollows.
* Find [[Spindle]] in the [[High Hollows]]

==Description==
One of my weave-rats has failed to check in for an unusually long time. I sent Spindle to retrieve information we could use against one of [[Ansurek]]'s favored wretches, but she has not returned from her assignment.

[[Meesk the Venomtongue]] is a wretch and a sycophant, but he is dangerous all the same. While I have much trust in my dear Spindle's abilities, I fear what a malefactor such as Meesk would do to one of my little ones should he find them.

Find Spindle. Make sure she is well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<All of Spindle's eyes widen with both relief and embarrassment at the sight of you.>

==Completion==
<The little spider looks at you with many pleading eyes. You get the sense that she does not want you to speak of this to anyone.>

==Notes and trivia==
