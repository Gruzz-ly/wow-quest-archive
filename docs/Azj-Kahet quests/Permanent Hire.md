==Objectives==
Speak with [[Saffrin]] in [[Rak-Ush]].

==Description==
Rak-Ush is beginning to look like a functioning swarmery.

The role of delegation has suited [[Kish'nal|me]] and [[Vix'aron]] well. You will continue to aid the [[niffen]].

In return, you may keep a portion of the wealth the swarmbeasts produce.

Saffrin has more detailed plans around the development of the swarmery.

Speak to him.

I have nothing else to say to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
These swarmbeasts aren't going to take care of themselves!

==Notes==
{{dialogue|title=Saffrin|[[Rak-Ush]] isn't going to run itself, you know!

{{gossip|What's next for Rak-Ush?}}

With the stagshells, that brings us to three hollows of swarmbeasts.

They will require constant maintenance. The [[niffen]] will be able to handle the majority of the responsibilities, however [[Kish'nal]] specifically demanded you handle certain tasks.

Rak-Ush houses a special breed of jawcrawlers called 'ploughworms' that will need to be fed and exercised.

We also posses a hollow of specialized silk-weaving threadlings. They require a special diet, as well as protection from any scavenging forces.

The beetles will also need to be fed, and truffles will need to be collected.

[[Vix'aron]] was insistent that you will be rewarded for your efforts.}}
