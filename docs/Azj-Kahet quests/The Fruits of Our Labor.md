==Objectives==
Deliver 3 Alchemical Potions to [[Silken Ward]] citizens.
* Alchemical Potions delivered (3)

==Description==
You put on quite the show, yes? The orders are already coming in. The citizens can't wait to get their mandibles on the potions.

I have one final task for you. I want you to take these latest orders and deliver them. You will accept, yes? 

The citizens are stirring, now is the time to show the [[Pale Weavelashers]] what we can do. If any try and stop you, you know what to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]
*500x The Weaver (Notoriety)
*35 [[Kej]]

==Progress==
The time is now, friend. The Pale Weavelashers aren't unstoppable.

==Completion==
Well done, friend. The citizens have all they need to overcome the Pale Weavelashers.

==Notes==
[[Priest Maro'zik]] is closest, down to the southwest:

{{dialogue|When I saw the display earlier I knew I needed one of these potions. I need that extra push to stand up to the Pale Weavelashers.

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over potion>}}}}
:{{text|say|Priest Maro'zik|Watch out, kobyss!}}
:{{text|say|Priest Maro'zik|The potion drew them here. Perhaps they acquired a taste from the potions dropped down the cliffs.}}

Further southwest is [[Teachzer Zas'rush]]:
{{dialogue|My students found the earlier display rather inspiring. If I can inspire them to stand up for themselves, I will see myself as a successful teacher.

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over potion>}}}}
:{{text|say|Pale Weavelasher Apprentice|And what kind of example are you setting to the children!}}
:{{text|say|Weaverat|I want to be just like teacher!}}
:{{text|say|Teacher Zas'rush|The young one means nothing by it. Please forgive him.}}

[[Worker Yareh'losh]] is due south:
{{dialogue|The Pale Weavelashers have been all over our spinnerets building this new ward. They respect strength and I intend to show it to them. A few potions will go a long way.

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over potion>}}}}
:{{text|say|Pale Weavelasher Overseer|What do you think you are doing? Stop slacking off!}}
:''A Pale Weavelasher Overseer runs up, and Yareh'losh slashes at it.''
:{{text|say|Worker Yareh'losh|Perhaps this is too much. I only meant to shove him...}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Alchemist Talbax|Can you feel a change in the wind? The citizens of the Silken Ward are stirring.}}
:{{text|say|Alchemist Talbax|Your work here might be done but I am only just starting. What's wrong with a little profit along with a revolution?}}
