'''Heroes Never Die''' begins the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]] alongside [[Chasing the Light]].

==Objectives==
Aid twelve Wounded Aeroknights.
* [[Wounded Aeroknight]]s rescued (12)

==Description==
Damn it all! We were too hasty, and now my people are paying the price.

We were fools to think the [[nerubian]]s wouldn't be prepared for an incursion. [[Arathi]] soldiers are made of stern stuff, but even they will struggle to walk off an airship crash.

I will keep everyone here safe. Please, go into the field and rescue as many people as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Rescued Aeroknight's Mantle]]
* [[Rescued Aeroknight's Vambraces]]
* [[Rescued Aeroknight's Gloves]]
* [[Rescued Aeroknight's Helmet]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Make haste, <class>. Time is of the essence.

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>, on behalf of those you saved. No one deserves to die alone in the dark, least of all in a place like this.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|[[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] would not have given up without a fight. He has to be be down there!}}
:''Alleria, Faerin, and the Arathi Aeroknights all jump off the airship into the fray.''

Before following them, [[Kal Smoulderbrow]] starts [[The Second Front]].

[[Wounded Aeroknight]]s light up on the minimap. Interact with them to get them on their feet:
*{{text|say|Wounded Aeroknight|I was sure I was spider-food.}}
*{{text|say|Wounded Aeroknight|[[Light]] forfend, this place is a nightmare!}}
*{{text|say|Wounded Aeroknight|Thank you, <class>. I will find the others.}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Aeroknight|Thought I was done for... thank you.}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Aeroknight|We never stood a chance. We have to regroup!}}

[[File:Chasing the Light - end.jpg|thumb|Faerin and Alleria looking south.]]
Once done with both, catch up with Faerin and Alleria on a bluff looking south:
:{{text|say|Faerin|Do you see any sign of [[Orweyna|that woman]] who saved us?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|No. But I did find tracks leading south... And there's something foul down there as well.}}

==Progression==
{{Friends in the Dark}}
