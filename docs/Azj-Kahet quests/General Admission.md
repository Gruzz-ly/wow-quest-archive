==Objectives==
Find some useful blackmail material for [[Anub'azal|the General]].
* [[Zev'kall's Attrition Log]] {{co|43.3|25.3|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
It isn't enough to inconvenience [[Zev'kall]]. He should be humiliated. I already have some information, but I need more.

He stores military logs in a room that is too tiny for me to access. See what information he's hiding. I'm sure there's potential blackmail material in there somewhere.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There should be something I can use.

==Completion==
Let me see!

This... is not blackmail material. But it is far worse.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Eliminating ZeVkall's lackeys is but the first move. Blackmail will be the death blow.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I'm gonna salvage what I can here. Throw together an explosive or two!}}
:''Gazlowe walks over to his [[Busted Shredder X-3922]].''

Gazlowe has gossip:
{{dialogue|My poor Shredder has seen better days, for sure.

{{gossip|What are you making now?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
If I can find a few specific pieces, I'll be able to form some explosives. If our friends are in cages, we'll be able to bust 'em right out!

I don't think I have enough time to whip together a flamethrower, but I'll do my best here.

Outside, move around freely, but watch out for the [[Siege Dominator]]s, which have truesight.

The Siegehold Records containing [[Zev'kall's Attrition Log]] are inside a small building to the southwest:
:{{text|say|Siegehold Fortifier|A little overcrawler with Anub'azal's scent mark? Hmph.}}
:{{text|say|Siegehold Fortifier|Get whatever you were sent for and get out of my way.}}
