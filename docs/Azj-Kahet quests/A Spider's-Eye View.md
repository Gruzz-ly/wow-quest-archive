==Objectives==
Place shadecasters to rendezvous with the [[Widow Arak'nai|Weaver]]'s [[scout]]s in the Umbral Bazaar, the Eastern Span, and the Twitching Gorge.
*[[Umbral Bazaar]] scouted {{co|49.7|20.4|City of Threads}} / {{co|48.7|72.4|Azj-Kahet}}
*[[Eastern Span]] scouted {{co|74.2|74.2|Azj-Kahet}}
*[[Twitching Gorge]] scouted {{co|78.7|41.6|City of Threads}} / {{co|58.7|79.2|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
I have eyes in every crevice of the city save for one that has... eluded me.

The [[Transformatory]] is the grounds of [[Ansurek]]'s most precocious minions and treasured pets. It is where the Ascension process was developed. I've only gotten my claws on it recently, thanks to dear [[Y'tekhi]]. Much of it remains uncomfortably shrouded.

A more legs-on approach is in order. Place shadecasters to collect intel from my scouts, then meet Y'tekhi and your own spymaster Voss in a discreet corner of the district.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I don't like the sound of those reports. Looks like whatever they're cooking is coming to a head, right in time for us to walk in.

Don't worry. I'll let you know if we get in too deep.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|The Transformatory was a blind spot for me, until Y'tekhi breached it and achieved Ascension.}}
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|Mistress, you flatter me.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Scout for troubling movement in the area. Then rendezvous and prepare to infiltrate.}}
:''Y'tekhi and Voss walk off.''

Head to the [[City of Threads]] and place the first shadecaster atop the [[Skittering Lounge]] to display a brief [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]]:
{{#ev:youtube|h1VcUVcgNMI|Umbral Bazaar}}

{{text|bossemote|Executor Nizrek|Do you see that? Nothing! Decidedly odd for the City of Threads.}}

{{text|bossemote|Executor Nizrek|The freshly Ascended are usually flitting about the Umbral Bazzaar. Where have they gone?}}

Head east to the [[Tower of Tomes]] and place another shadecaster atop the tower to start another in-engine cutscene:
{{#ev:youtube|F_9m7cyq3S0|Twitching Gorge}}

{{text|bossemote|Widow Arak'nai|Smuggling is common enough in the city, but from the [[Maddening Deep]]? Unusual and concerning.}}

{{text|bossemote|Widow Arak'nai|I need to know where they're taking that bile, why, and for whom.}}

Further east to the [[Blood Tower]] to start the third in-engine cutscene:

{{#ev:youtube|BX90ZQgEpTs|Eastern Span}}

{{text|bossemote|Anub'azal|Gathering supplies? Marching out? I've heard nothing of this!}}

{{text|bossemote|Anub'azal|Make no mistake, this is preparation for war--and none thought to inform me. This bodes ill indeed.}}

Head to the [[Transformatory]] to turn in to Voss and Y'tekhi. Amusingly, Guts, Voss's mount, is resting on a statue nearby:
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|They made it. Color me impressed.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Don't get too comfortable. We've got a long mission ahead of us.}}
