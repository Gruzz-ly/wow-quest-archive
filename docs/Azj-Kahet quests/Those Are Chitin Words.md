'''Those Are Chitin Words''' is the first of several grindy quests to obtain [[Siesbarg (mount)]] as a flying mount. To begin, level {{level|tww-max}} players should defeat [[Tka'ktath]], on a floating platform above the [[Salien Gutters]] in [[Azj-Kahet]], and loot a [[Vial of Tka'ktath's Blood]].

A good source for chitin is the [[Faithful of Zirix]] mobs outside the [[Cinderbrew Meadery]] in eastern [[Isle of Dorn]], where players can also double up on [[Crackling Shard]] drops. Additionally, repeated solo [[Follower Dungeons]] difficulty runs of [[Ara-Kara, City of Echoes]] or [[City of Threads (instance)|City of Threads]] are other options. Additionally, the invading sureki forces that the [[Flame's Radiance]] are fighting off in the [[Nightfall scenario]] also drop chitin.

Shalba is ''not'' looking for the {{g|wrath}} [[Nerubian Chitin]] crafting reagent, so don't spend a lot of gold for it on the [[Auction House]]!

==Objectives==
Collect enough Nerubian Chitin for [[Shalba]]'s experiment.
* [[Nerubian Chitin (Khaz Algar)]] (1500)

==Description==
Well now, this is certainly an interesting specimen. It seems the original creator who worked on this creature made grave errors in balancing the genetic materials. No wonder the creature you encountered was an abomination. What terrible technique!

With the right materials however, I may just be able to perfect it. [[Siesbarg]] here will be our test-subject. Perhaps his [[Ascended nerubian|Ascension]] will finally catch the attention of those in charge of administering promotions!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Chitin samples will help define the strength of Siesbarg's new form.

==Completion==
I will put this chitin to great use!

==Progression==
{{Siesbarg}}
