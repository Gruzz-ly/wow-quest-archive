==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Vek'kix.png|Vek'kix|Vek'kix is brutal to his workers.}}
Kill the [[Ascended nerubian]] who is torturing [[Vi'azl]].
* [[Vek'kix]] slain <!-- beta name: Valk'kitch -->

==Description==
Vi'azl has undergone a level of torture that I was unaware of. We cannot help Vi with his fear until Vi is actually safe.

Whenever possible, I advocate friendship, recovery, and reconciliation. I ask others to act with compassion and empathy. Everyone deserves a chance to recover. I dedicate my life to this.

But hearing and seeing what is happening to Vi'azl... I think I've changed my mind. Enough is enough. We must act.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 14,500 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[General (faction)|The General]] or 250x [[Kej]]

==Progress==
Nobody deserves this torturous treatment.

==Completion==
These Ascended nerubians have been mutated beyond empathy or community. It pains me, but I must focus on those that can be saved, like Vi'azl.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|<Name> will see to your problem, Vi. I'll stay with you. I promise you will be safe.}}

Vi'azl's gossip:
{{dialogue|My superior does not make idle threats. I saw a fellow worker's front legs torn off for being slow while packing silks!

It... it was the most horrible thing I've ever seen. The sounds she made... she was packing slowly, though...

My superior used to be my friend. He is still my friend, sometimes. Sometimes he talks to me like old times, and calls me Vi. Can someone be both things?}}

Upon entering the [[Ichor Loom]] where Vek'thix can be found supervising [[Suppressed Worker]]s:
:{{text|say|Vek'kix|It pains me to do this, but it's the only way you seem to learn your lessons.}}
:{{text|say|Suppressed Worker|Forgive us! We'll do better!}}
:{{text|say|Suppressed Worker|We're sorry! We don't want to cause you pain.}}

Some of the suppressed workers have gossip:
{{dialogue|I need to rest. Just for a minute. Please.}}
{{dialogue|What happened to Vi'azl?}}

Upon engaging Vek'kix in combat:
:{{text|say|Vek'kix|Tak'rasha'na! I will rip you limb from limb!}}
:{{text|say|Suppressed Worker|Don't hurt us!}}
:{{text|say|Suppressed Worker|No, please...}}
:''Some of the suppressed workers run away.''
:On defeat:
:{{text|say|Vek'kix|Little... legs... how?}}

The suppressed workers from before have new gossip after:
{{dialogue|What do I do now? I need direction!}}
{{dialogue|What will happen now?}}

Vi'azl's gossip upon return:
{{dialogue|Vek'kix is... gone?}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|It's over, Vi. Vek'kix can't hurt you anymore.}}
:{{text|say|Vi'azl|Is he really gone? I don't know how to feel. I... am relieved, but also... saddened?}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Take some time. Whatever you need. Come talk again when you're ready.}}
:{{text|say|Vi'azl|I will, Mr. Sunflower.}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|I am sorry I asked you to do murder, <name>. But I think it was necessary. These Ascended are no longer part of our society. I am not certain if they are even nerubian.}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|They are decidedly... unfriendly.}}

Mr. Sunflower has some new gossip back at their place:

{{Gossip|How is Vi'azl doing?}}

{{dialogue-child|We removed the immediate threat to Vi's well-being, but that Ascended nerubian had quite a hold on him. He manipulated him into thinking he deserved that treatment. I hope Vi'azl returns to talk, but it is on his own timetable to do so.

I'll be here, whenever he's ready.

{{gossip|Thanks for the update.}}}}
