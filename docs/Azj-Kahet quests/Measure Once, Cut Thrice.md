==Objectives==
Slay Webwarper Tath'rhiz, Seam Reaper Zhir'ix, and Colormancer Nirethi.
*[[Webwarper Tath'rhiz]] slain
*[[Seam Reaper Zhir'ix]] slain
*[[Colormancer Nirethi]] slain

==Description==
I was promised an important, glamorous, enviable position of power when I left the city for [[Rak-Ahat]].

This warehouse job? Neither important nor enviable. And certainly not glamorous.

[[Grand Overspinner Antourix]] has been at this for far too long. She doesn't understand my vision. All she wants are drones that do exactly what she wants, how she wants it.

Take out her most loyal workers. We'll see how tough she is on her own once I take over the dyeworks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ugh. It's impossible to work under these conditions.

==Completion==
With those sycophants out of the way, the Overspinner is nothing. I'll be running this place in no time.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|With the Overspinner's flunkies out of the way, I'll be able to move in my own elite staff.}}
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|I'll whistle for them at the dyeworks. Kill the competition, then meet me there.}}

Find and slay the targets. Seam Reaper Zhir'ix: 

:{{text|say|Seam Reaper Zhir'ix|I only need to cut once!}}
:Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Seam Reaper Zhir'ix|Reap... what you sew...}}

Colormancer Nirethi:
:{{text|say|Colormancer Nirethi|Careful, your blood will stain!}}
:Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Colormancer Nirethi|Colors... fading...}}

Webwarper Tath'rhiz:
:{{text|say|Webwarper Tath'rhiz|I'll make wefts of your sinew!}}
:Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Webwarper Tath'rhiz|My work... unravelled...}}

Upon meeting with Grand Overspinner Antourix and Ren'kat after completing both quests:
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|Aha, my secret weapon! <Name> has already dismantled your institution, Overspinner!}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|You witless soft-shell, <name> has been working for me!}}

Upon completion of both quests:
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|You can't stop me! I'll augment the dyes and take over all of Rak-Ahat!}}
:{{text|say|Grand Overspinner Antourix|You idiot! I already augmented the dyes!}}
:{{text|say|Ren'khat|I'll augment you out of existence!}}

==Progression==
