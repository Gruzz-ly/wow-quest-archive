==Description==
[[Ansurek]]... that worm, that witless, gutless little--

<[[Y'tekhi]] growls under their breath, struggling to maintain their composure.>

If this is what's become of [[Neferess]], we must free her. She is still our queen. My mistress will know what to do.

When [[Widow Arak'nai|the Weaver]] discovers what they've all done, there will not be a crevice deep enough to escape her wrath.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Remember when I said I'd let you know when we're in over our heads? This is it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|We should be careful. We don't know what that thing can do--}}
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|That thing is my queen. I will not leave her chained!}}
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|Bring me whatever bile they have lying around. I'll melt her chains myself if I have to.}}
:''Y'tekhi runs into the room.''

Various containers of Caustic Chemicals are on tables around the room. Pick up four:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|What are you doing? You're going to get us all killed.}}
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|I know exactly what I'm doing.}}

Consider speaking with Y'tekhi:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|This doesn't seem like a good idea.}}}}
:''They knock the adventurer away and free the right leg.''
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|Who's going to stop me? You? Hah!}}
:''They run over to the other side of the room.''

Speak with them again:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|Please, let's just think about this.}}}}
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|Not now!}}
:''They repeat the process with the left leg, before running over to the right arm anchor.''

Try again to speak with them:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|I won't sit by while you let that thing loose!}}}}
:{{text|say|Y'tekhi|Stay back!}}

Run up to Y'tekhi to stop the fourth and a surprise [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|ZJf2XopZcVI|The Queen's Chains}}

''Interior, First Ascended's Prison. Y'tekhi and the adventurer are at the fourth and final anchor. As the ascended works on it, Xal'atath lets out an amused chuckle as she teleports in. Her eyes start glowing as she speaks to Y'tekhi.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Your Ascension... is complete.}}

''Y'tekhi's head starts glowing between their four eyes. They turn purple as the adventurer starts stepping away backwards. Voss lands a sneak attack, then drops out of stealth.''

{{text|bossemote|Lilian Voss|Out! Now!}}

''Voss and the adventurer beat a hasty retreat out of the building as Guts, her bat mount, flies in. Xal'atath floats up to Y'tekhi, gives her a look, then teleports away as Guts flies Voss and the adventurer off.''

''Y'tekhi starts moving, leaving a light trail behind as they run in a flash after the escapees.''

{{text|bossemote|Lilian Voss|She seized Y'tekhi's mind without even blinking.}}

''As Guts keeps flying Voss and the adventurer away, Y'tekhi parkours theirself to within jumping distance.''

{{text|bossemote|Lilian Voss|If she can do that to one Ascended...}}

''Y'tekhi interrupts Voss's thinking out loud by killing Guts, sending Voss and the adventurer plummeting to the ground.''

After the cutscene, Voss walks over to the adventurer:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Still in one piece? Good. This is far from over.}}
