==Objectives==
Take [[Albert]]'s head to the Pathfinders in [[Faerin's Advance]].
* [[Albert's Head]] (provided)

==Description==
<Albert is no longer alive. All that remains is his head, still full of maggots.

Taking him back to the Pathfinders seems like the right thing to do.>

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Spider-Fang Epaulets]]
*[[Albert's Last Gloves]]
*[[Deceased Nerubian's Slippers]]
*[[Long-Forgotten Girdle]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*5,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Whose head is that?

==Completion==
This eyeless, mostly eaten, maggot-infested head is...

Albert! Oh no, what happened?!

We didn't know where his team had gone, just that they'd taken a mission near the city.  I can't imagine the trauma he endured, or what you had to do to bring his remains to us. We'll take it from here. Thank you for bringing him back.

And I hope the nightmares that could come from this don't linger for you, friend.

==Notes==
On completion:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|Thank you for bringing Pathfinder Henson--Albert--back to us. I'll bring him home, when we're done here. He deserves his rest.}}
