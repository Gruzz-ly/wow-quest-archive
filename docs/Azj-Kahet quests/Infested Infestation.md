'''Infested Infestation''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Azj-Kahet storyline]] alongside [[Prisoner Preservation]] at [[Faerin's Advance]].

==Objectives==
Kill 12 spore afflicted beasts at [[Pillar-nest Vosh]].
* Spore-afflicted beasts slain (12)

==Description==
These spore-afflicted beasts at Pillar-nest Vosh been a thorn in our side since setting up Faerin's Advance. They be spreading thick clouds of spores. I never be seeing anything like it! 

They already attacked once. Won't be long till they attack again. If we got any hope of survivin', we need to cull dere numbers.

Go to [[Pillar-nest Vosh]] and take some of those spore-afflicted beasts out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That spore-afflicted beast population of Pillar-nest Vosh gotta be deal with if we be survivin' in Azj-Kahet.

==Completion==
With de number of those spores-afflicted beast reduced, we bought more time ta think of a more permanent solution.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Great Hexer Ohodo|Da spored beasts are no joke. Keep on your toes and clear them out. Dat will help with our future endeavours.}}
:{{text|say|Great Hexer Ohodo|I can only hope our mission expedition members are still alive. Be swift and tink quickly. Good luck.}}

Valid targets at [[Pillar-nest Vosh]] are [[Spored Gnasher]]s, [[Spored Skitterer]]s, [[Spored Stinger]]s, and [[Spored Threadling]]s.

On complete of both:
:{{text|say|Drog Skullbreaker|As I was dragged through the Pillar-nest I caught a glimpse of fungarians inside the cave. They were riddling those beasts with spores! The same spores that cloud around them all.}}
:{{text|say|Aemara|Did anyone else see a large fungarian? There was a huge one planting spore pods around the cave. Perhaps that was their leader?}}
:{{text|say|Mimbihi|I didn't see any big fungarians, but I did see Jeti make a run for it. One of da fungal spore pods popped near him. He didn't make it...}}
:{{text|say|Great Hexer Ohodo|Fungarians... no wonder dere be all those spores afflictin' da Pillar-nest. The fungal spore pods and dat large fungarian are what we should be worryin' about.}}
