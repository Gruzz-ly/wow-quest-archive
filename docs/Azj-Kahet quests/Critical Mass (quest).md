==Objectives==
[[File:Critical Mass.jpg|thumb|The Malfunctioning Mana Bomb and Jaina]]
Help Lady [[Jaina Proudmoore]] disarm the [[mana bomb]] in the [[Breathing Pit]].
* Magical objects disentangled (0/100%)
* [[Malfunctioning Mana Bomb|Mana Bomb]] disarmed

==Description==
This is exactly what I had feared.

[[Thalen Songweaver]]'s notes on the mana bomb he devised to [[Attack on Theramore Isle|devastate]] [[Theramore]] were under guard in [[Dalaran]]. Few knew of this.

I argued they should be destroyed. But others argued if such a bomb was again created, we would need them to disarm it.

And now those notes are both the problem and the solution.

Thankfully, I have read these notes, <name>. I will walk you through disarming the mana bomb.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*15x [[Valorstones]]
*5x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]

==Completion==
My faith in you is never misplaced. Well done.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Distangle the bomb's power sources while I suppress it. We cannot allow the mana bomb to detonate!}}

She has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Go. Quickly. 

I cannot let what happened at Theramore happen again.}}

Fill the bar by interacting with [[Polymorphed Sheep]], [[Scroll of Permanent Polymorph]], [[Staff of a Thousand Meteors]], [[Wand of Permafrost]], [[Half-formed Meteor]], and [[Block of Ice|Blocks of Ice]]. The Polymorphed Sheep will turn into a [[Confused Nerubian]], which must be slain.

At 100%:
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Now, <name>! Realign the mana bomb's matrix!}}

Interact with it and play the line-uncrossing minigame to disarm the bomb:
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We have averted a great catastrophe, <name>.}}
