==Notes==
Start by talking to [[Eirzay]] atop a roof in the [[Silken Ward]]:
{{dialogue|Several shipments of blacksmithing tools are waiting outside the city to be transported to the Siegehold.

It would be preferable to seize them for our own use, but storing them would be far too conspicuous.

Take these jars of rustmites--insects that feast upon any metal you set them to. Break them upon the smithing tools and let them handle the rest.

Oh, and don't get them on your armor.

{{gossip|Understood.}}}}

[[Sureki Smithing Tool]]s can be found throughout the Silken Ward.
