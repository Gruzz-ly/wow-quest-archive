==Objectives==
Pull on the spider thread if the spiders are not already attacking, and kill whatever comes.
* Pull the Web Strand
* [[Scalpel of Xishirra]] slain
* [[Albert]] slain

==Description==
I don't require vengeance on my behalf, but I would like vengeance for all of my friends that were eaten. I didn't think the Horror of Xesh was real, but she is. [[Xishirra]]. A shadow of a nightmare, making a brood of monsters while she stays out of reach.

The horror is ancient, and beyond us, but we can still make her pay! Pull hard on a web strand if you need to, and deal with whatever comes. We'll escape after some justice is had!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*14,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Albert's eyes were already dark, but any spark of life has faded from the rest of him, as well.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Albert|Are you ready to fight? Keep your eye on the ceiling.}}

Upon pulling the web strand:
:{{text|say|Albert|Above us... did you look up?}}

Upon defeating the [[Scalpel of Xishirra]], Xishirra throws her poison on Albert:
:{{text|say|Albert|Help! Help! It's the HORROR OF XESH!}}
:{{text|say|Albert|She's melting me, I--!}}

==Progression==
{{Pillar-nest of Horrors}}
