==Objectives==
Inform [[Widow Arak'nai]] of what transpired.

==Description==
<[[Anub'azal]] retches roughly. Ichor spews from his disjointed maw.>

My cohort's obligation to the [[Severed Threads]] yet remains. You would do well to report what happened here to the Weaver. Vexing as she is, she will have some idea of how to proceed from here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*[[The General's Trove]]

==Completion==
So, that is what happened.

Damnable fool. What was he thinking? Still... Zev'kall's death is a mighty blow to the loyalist forces. Chitin-headed as he is, I cannot question Anub'azal's strength.

His scions will take up his work for the Threads, and he will be remembered as a fine general.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Zev'kall lies dead at my feet. The strength granted by his vile masters was no match for the true might of Azj-Kahet.}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|Tradition! Study! Discipline! If our kingdom is to survive, then those tenets must remain as its foundation.}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|That is why I did this. To remind us all of our true strength.}}
:{{text|say|Anub'azal|You are dismissed, soldier. I wish to rest a while in view of my dear city.}}

Anub'azal's corpse can be found be near the Twitching Gorge.{{co|47|57|Azj-Kahet}}
