==Objectives==
Speak with 3 Silken Ward Citizens.
* [[Silken Ward]] Citizens spoken to (3)

==Description==
As you might have heard, things haven't gone as intended for the citizens of the Silken Ward. The [[Pale Enforcers]] have been keeping a tight grasp on the citizens.

I wasn't able to find much before an ascended kicked me out for snooping around. You are a fresh face, go around the Silken Ward and speak to the citizens, see if you can find a way to help them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah so you have heard about my recent troubles, friend. You may be able to help.

==Notes==
[[Worker Yareh'losh]] is closest, across the bridge to the northeast:

{{dialogue|The Pale Weavelashers pushing us harder isn't going to make building the Silken Ward any quicker. No rest for the weary, eh?

{{gossip|quest=|What is going on in the Silken Ward?}}

The Pale Weavelashers are working us too hard. The Silken Ward was supposed to be a new home for us but things are just as strict as the capital, even more so. It feels more like a military camp than a home.

They even dumped Alchemist Talbax's potions down the gorge. Are we not even allowed to make use of our own supplies?}}

[[Teacher Zas'rush]] is to the north, teaching four [[Weaverat]]s:

{{dialogue|How can they expect me to teach the younglings whenthey change I teach at the whims of others?

THeir lack of understanding will lead us to ruin.

{{gossip|quest=|What is going on in the Silken Ward?}}

Lies. 

I came here to teach the younger generation but I can't teach them the real history. The education the Queen demands can hardly be called that. 

And they call this history?  What history is worth learning about when it must be upheld by convenient lies?}}

[[Priest Maro'zik]] is further northeast:

{{dialogue|The Pale Weavelashers hold all the power in the Silken Ward. Everything follows the whims of the Queen.

{{gossip|quest=|What is going on in the Silken Ward?}}

Things are worse in the Silken Ward than in the capital. Any practice not approved by the Queen is met with subjugation. 

Even what is considered unlawful can change day to day.

The Pale Weavelashers were fine with Alchemist Talbax setting up shop in the market one day, the next his whole supply is down the cliffs. 

And what can he do? Any resistance and you might disappear. He wouldn't be the first.}}

During the beta, the quest was named '''A Cure for All Problems'''.
