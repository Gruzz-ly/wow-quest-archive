==Objectives==
Slay Siege Marshal Tekhzok and Royal Quartermaster Ze'erik.
*[[Siege Marshal Tekhzok]] slain {{co|61.2|73.5|Azj-Kahet}}
*[[Royal Quartermaster Ze'erik]] slain {{co|66.7|69.4|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
We don't have the firepower to dismantle their whole manufacturing operation, but what we do have is two leftover vials of anger pheromones. Let's make them count.

There's a siege marshal and a quartermaster overseeing the preparations and giving everyone orders. Logistics types, but they still pack a punch. That's where those pheromones come in.

Hit them with a vial, and their own armies will turn against them. Take out both, and we watch the operation crumble.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,250 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Those aggression pheromones came in handy... let's make sure not to waste them.

==Completion==
It's only a delay, not a hard stop, but it's still a big one. It'll give the folks up top more time to prepare.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Those bombs should give me enough cover to drag Y'tekhi out of here.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Meet me back at the Weaver's Lair. We'll... figure out what to do with them.}}

While near the two named targets, players have an extra access button:
:{{abilities|Pheromone Grenade|Only a few vials of this highly-volatile fluid remain, but that should be enough to deal with Siege Marshal Tekhzok and Royal Quartermaster Ze'erik.}}

Use it on them to stun them.

Tekhzok is at the western end of the bridge:
:{{text|yell|Siege Marshal Tekhzok|This is against your marching orders!}}
:{{text|say|Siege Marshal Tekhzok|My own army... Spineless...}}

Ze'erik is to the north:
:{{text|say|Royal Quartermaster Ze'erik|Traitors! The Queen will hear about this!}}
:{{text|say|Royal Quartermaster Ze'erik|All... our... plans...}}
