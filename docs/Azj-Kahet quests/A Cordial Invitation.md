==Objectives==
Spread word of the Vizier's announcement within the [[City of Threads]].
* [[Ar'syn]] invited
* [[Orator Tx'itk]] invited
* [[Rakva]] invited

==Description==
It is clear to me now that my time as the Vizier is drawing to a close. The nature of my service to [[Azj-Kahet]] must change. To that end, I have one final task to ask of you, <name>.

You have done a great deal of work in the City of Threads since your arrival. No doubt your reputation now precedes you. Seek out our allies within the city and ask them to congregate in the Umbral Bazaar. I have a message prepared for them all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}

==Progress==
Move expeditiously, friend. We do not have much time.

==Completion==
You've gathered quite a crowd. Excellent.

==Notes and trivia==
On inviting Ar'syn:
{{Dialogue|Ah, hello again! I trust your escapades proceed apace?

Do give the Weaver my regards. Should she ever require a contact for some creative repossession, I am certainly available for a little bit of contract work.

:{{text|say|Rakva|Oho? The Vizier isn't usually one for grand statements. This should make for some some excellent gossip.}}
