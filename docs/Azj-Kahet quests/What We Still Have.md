==Objectives==
Return to the [[Weaver's Lair]].
* Report to [[Widow Arak'nai|the Weaver]]

==Description==
I went into [[City of Threads|the city]] prepared--prepared to end this war even if I was ended with it.

But I am alive. As are you. As is [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]. We have new allies and a new way forward. I realize at this moment that my vision may have been obscured by my
guilt.

Part of me feels those words are Anduin's, not mine. Perhaps he's rubbing off on me.

Let us return to your Weaver's Lair. I wish to see yours and Anduin's efforts to save these people as well as our own through.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
* {{abilities|Portal to Dornogal|Grants access to the Dornogal portal on the Isle of Dorn from the Weaver's Lair.}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]
* +2,500 [[reputation]] with [[Vizier (faction)|The Vizier]] or 185 [[Kej]]

==Progress==
I do believe my suggestion was to stay quiet while in the city, was it not?

==Completion==
How many times were my suspicions diverted from [[Executor Nizrek]]'s true identity as "the Vizier"? Perhaps I've lost my step. Me! A master of spycraft.

Hah--far more likely, it is that he's simply much better than I give him credit for.

I find myself quite stirred by the knowledge that someone's gift for subterfuge may rival my own. We shall work together quite nicely.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I need a moment more. We'll catch up with you at the Weaver's lair.}}

Speak with Alleria:
{{dialogue|Our journey down here has strained us all.

Even still, the struggle has enlightened me to Anduin's character, the obstacles he's overcome, and the ones he's still working through. I'm quite impressed by one so young.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Well, we've certainly kicked the spider's nest. Xal'atath won't wait long before striking again.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria... What happened back there?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|She invited me into the darkness. Said I was already halfway there.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|And I'd be lying if I said that wasn't partly true.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That by embracing the Void to pursue her, I had to cast aside all I care for. You, Vereesa, Turalyon, Arator, Khadgar.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Dalaran wasn't your fault.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Can you blame me for wishing I had prevented it? For wondering if the Void could have alerted me to Xal'atath?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|No. I've been... I understand that feeling, more than you know.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|For so long, I thought I had to choose between two paths: stay with my loved ones, or walk alone in the Void.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath sought to force that choice upon me. But I see now that there is only one path forward.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The Void is a part of me, as is my love for my family. I can--and must--walk with both. No matter what Xal'atath whispers in my ear.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It can be hard to find your footing in the darkness. Just remember, Alleria... we're always here to lend a hand.}}

Before flying off, just to the north, [[Al'kubian]], a mid-level alchemist, starts [[A Fin of Every Kind]].

Back at the [[Weaver's Lair]], speak with [[Widow Arak'nai]]:

{{dialogue|Quite the ruckus you all made...

{{gossip|quest=|I need to inform you of what happened in the city.}}}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|I anticipated your exodus from the city would be... boisterous. But you enjoy exceeding expectations, don't you?}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|You've brought two powerful Kaheti into our humble conspiracy and reunited with your companions. Impressive, my darling morsel.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|I shall reach out to the General and Vizier soon. As my primary agent in this delightful tangle of threads, I'll require your presence during this initial communique.}}

During the beta, the quest was named '''Beginning Anew From Rock Bottom'''.
