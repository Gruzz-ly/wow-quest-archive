==Objectives==
Find the Puppetmaster's Antiparalytic Serum.
* [[Antiparalytic Serum]]
* [[Incomplete Puppet]]s cured (4)

==Description==
It's perfect! [[The Puppetmaster]] is so interested in adding you to his collection, he literally invited us to go rescue [[High Elevator Etak'kaht|the Magistrate]].

I don't want to imply I've been using you as bait this entire time, but... Let's just say certain calculated risks have paid off.

Even such a skilled artist must have a way to correct potential errors. There has to be an antitoxin of sorts for that paralytic around here somewhere!

Find it. And perhaps we test it before we go use it on the Magistrate. Just in case.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I would worry we're taking too long, but considering how dramatic that Puppetmaster is, I can't imagine he'll start the show without us.

We should be prepared for something... rather unpleasant at that theater.

==Completion==
Just what we were looking for.

And about using you as bait... You know it's not personal in our line of work, friend.

I was open from the start of all this that you were the status symbol I needed to navigate this area and socially manipulate the Ascended.

And if there's one thing I know to bet on, it's the ability of the Ascended to covet power flaunted over others.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|We can't go to the theater unprepared. There must be an antitoxin around here somewhere...}}

Upon picking up the Antiparalytic Serum:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Just what we're looking for! Uh... Test it before we go use it on the Magistrate.}}

Go around the room and use the serum on the "Incomplete Puppet"s:
*{{text|say|Incomplete Puppet|Ah, thank you for rescuing us in time! I owe you my life.}}
*{{text|say|Incomplete Puppet|That paralytic is dangerous. Any puppets fully under his control are already gone, sorry to say.}}
*{{text|say|Incomplete Puppet|One more dose and we would've been stuck for good!}}
*{{text|say|Incomplete Puppet|I couldn't move, but I could see... and think... And now, I think I need a drink.}}

Upon using it on all four of them:
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Good, the serum works. We'll need that for the Magistrate.}}
