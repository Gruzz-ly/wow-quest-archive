==Objectives==
Retrieve Hannan from the Abandoned Harvest Site.
* [[Hannan]] followed into the [[Salien Gutters]] cave

==Description==
I did not mean for...

<Orweyna's eyes narrow.>

Fetch him, <name>. You were exposed to the Black Blood, too. But Hannan took most of it.

He has entered the Unseeming, his mind shifted to a realm beyond our eyes through exposure to the Black Blood. You may need to join him however far in he ventured to retrieve him.

I will activate the [[nerubian]] cleansing instrument for when you return.

Do not lose yourself in that altered state.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is this real? Am I imagining the monsters?

==Completion==
My head... It hurts. Everything feels so cloudy and... Help, please!

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|Find Hannan. I'll use the tuning crystal we found to fix this cleansing instrument. You two will need it.}}

Orweyna's gossip:
{{dialogue|<Frustration flashes in her eyes. At you or herself, you are not certain.>

If you are not capable of retrieving Hannan, tell me so and I will do it myself.}}

Find Hannan inside the [[Abandoned Harvest Site]]:
{{dialogue|What's happening? My head--everything hurts... I can't think, I'm seeing things...

Is this the dissonance Orweyna feels down here?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell Hannan to follow you out of the cave.>}}
