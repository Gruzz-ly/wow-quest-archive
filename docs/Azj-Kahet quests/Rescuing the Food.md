==Objectives==
Rescue 1 Captive Kaheti.
* Purchase [[Atomized Salien Slime]] (Optional)
* Rescue Captured Victims (5)

==Description==
While awaiting your innards-bestowing return, I observed some fascinating activity below. A consistent train of [[kobyss]] are dragging the limp bodies of my kin from the lake's waters and westerly into their cavern.

My conclusion? [[Nerubian]]s are being hunted and stored in the lake for consumption by these beasts.

It's not so much for research than it is for civic duty, but I would reward you might be able to save from their fate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Your efforts are appreciated, but I will be rewarding these civic tasks at a... slightly lesser pay tier than your scientific ones.

Blame my stipend.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Al'kubian|You seem a poor swimmer. I have concoctions to aid you with that... but not for free.}}

Al'kubian will sell a vial of [[Atomized Salien Slime]] for {{cost|8|88|88}}, providing water breathing and +120% swim speed for 60 sec.

==Progression==
