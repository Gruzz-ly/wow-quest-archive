==Objectives==
Burn the Pillar-nest Hearts and replace the incense in the [[Mmarl]] cave.
* [[Pillar-nest Heart]]s destroyed (4)
* Replace Niffen Protection Incense
* [[Flameflow 7000]] (provided)

==Description==
So the [[goblin]]s removed the incense the [[niffen]] used to keep those creepy pests out... because it smelled bad?

Honestly, I'm not surprised. Maybe we can show them that they need to work together. Leading by example! Here, I'll lend you a flamethrower. I know mine works, without weird... chicken-like effects.

Head in, clear out the nests, and put the right incense back in there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The cave is just up ahead.

==Completion==
Okay, that flamethrower. I need it. I guess I'll talk to Gazlowe... but don't tell anyone that I did.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|Look, if your repellent didn't smell terrible we wouldn't be in this situation.}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Would you pay more for a different scent, even if it's less effective?}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|MORE? Are you kidding me? I should get a selection of smells to choose from!}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|The smell I'm going for is barbequed.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|Fine. We'll leave it stinky for now.}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|Thank you for that violent but effective solution, friend!}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Stink! Violence! Everybody's happy.}}
:{{text|say|Grigg|I'm happy with staying alive.}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|I definitely appreciate that flamethrower.}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|...how much for that flamethrower?}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|I saw it first! Dibs!}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|The low low price is a friendly meal over at Corby's Cabana. I wanna hear more about where you're from.}}
:{{text|say|Jenni Boombuckle|You mean Undermine? Sure, I'm in.}}
:{{text|say|Rhubarn|I love Corby's!}}
:''They walk off.''

They relocate to [["Doctor" Thad Rustwhistle|Thad]]'s pavilion at the [[Grudge Grotto]] on the eastern side of town:

{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|We'll need to be careful with the Venture Company, but there's no need to fight them while we're here on other business.

Particularly when they mention Undermine in casual conversation... that warrants further chat!}}
{{dialogue|title=Jenni Boombuckle|Allies? That's a stretch. But we're working out the details.}}
{{dialogue|title=Rhubarn|I love Corby's!}}
{{dialogue|title="Doctor" Thad Rustwhistle|What you lookin' for, a tip about the next fight?

Never bet against the Venture Company. Least of all me and my killer bots!}}

==Progression==
