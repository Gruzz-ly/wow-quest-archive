==Objectives==
Learn from Merrix about the [[Council of Dornogal]].
* Speak to [[Merrix]]

==Description==
I hate to admit it, but we have been caught unprepared by the [[nerubian]]s.

Our processes focused on sustaining [[Dornogal]] and our declining population. 

Stormward [[Baelgrim]]'s stalwart pride has kept him and the [[Stormriders]] capable fighters, but they are already stretched thin, and they are not builders.

The [[Coreway]]'s damage surpasses our ability to fix it.

But... that was not always so. I suppose if you wish to understand, you must learn more about us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So much has been lost.

==Completion==
We are fractured in half. And now our purpose is being tested. Titans, give us strength...

==Notes==
Speak with Merrix again:
{{dialogue|
We must rally to restore and protect Dornogal.

{{gossip|quest=|Tell me about the Council of Dornogal.}}<br>
{{gossip|{{text|red|<Skip conversation>}} Tell me another time.}}}}

Should players not choose to skip, the images of the four wards appear in the center of the room: [[Baelgrim]] the Stormward, [[Merrix]] the Councilward, [[Eirich]] the High Speaker, and [[Adelgonn]] the Stoneward.
:{{text|say|Merrix|The titans uplifted four wards: the Councilward, the Stormward, the Stoneward, and the High Speaker...}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|...to keep the Edicts and build the Coreway and its fortress, Dornogal.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|But the titans left and the machines stopped. The Unbound abandoned the Edicts, and the High Speaker retreated to the Ringing Deeps.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|And now the Machine Speakers are cut off from us and we have no means to fix the Coreway.}}

After the vision, Baelgrim has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
The Stormriders and I have protected the Isle since our inception.

We upheld the Edicts after the Stoneward and High Speaker left.

If either of them were true earthen, they would already be here, ready to protect their home and people from further attack.

But if I alone have to keep the Coreway free and Dornogal safe, so be it.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Then it seems long past time ye stood united. We need to find this Adelgonn, rebuild ye Coreway...}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|...and take care o' the nerubians once and fer all.}}

After completion, Merrix has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
I have secretly surveilled Adelgonn and her people since her departure. It is my duty as Councilward, after all, to know all that transpires on the Isle of Dorn.

She has long retired her Stoneward title. She and the Unbound founded a settlement to the south. As to their new purpose, I'm not sure if I understand it. Many of them seek to shed their duty to the titans, but the Edicts are our identity. Are they earthen without them?

I know what Stormward Baelgrim would say.

In a way he's right. It should not be possible. Thinking beyond our coding, our directives...

The existence of Unbound is a miracle.}}

{{Rfb-section}}
Merrix's initial gossip:
{{Dialogue|
We have never seen the likes of you before. The earthen are forbidden to leave the Isle.
