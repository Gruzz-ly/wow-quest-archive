==Description==
Hello there!

I have heard of fantastic materials that can be thread and put together from some... peculiar materials.

If you are the type who enjoys travelling through the last sunny parts of Khaz-Algar, will you be kind enough to gather Kaheti Swarm Chitin and Sunless Carapace for me? I will reward you nicely if you can supply me with some samples.

* 9,250 [[XP]]
*[[Algari Skinner's Notes]]

==Progress==
I feel a certain eagerness to get my hands on these materials.

==Completion==
How peculiar. There is no saying what can be achieved with these materials. Only time would tell, titans willing.

==Notes==
*{{profquality|1}} items are needed.
