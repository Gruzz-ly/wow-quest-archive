So you are an [[alchemist]]? I see.

Tarig has her alchemist lab bench set up in the southern part of the Forgegrounds. From there, she can help you review, craft, and deliver work orders from public lists and personal contacts like friends and guildmates. If you are lucky, you might receive an order from renowned persons offering extra rewards.

I would never miss an opportunity to share my expertise--or my lab bench!
