==Objectives==
[[Biergoth]] wants you to confront Geezle Gigazap within [[Operation: Floodgate]].
* {{mob|Geezle Gigazap}} defeated

==Description==
My sources report that [[Darkfuse]] forces have infiltrated the [[Waterworks]] down in the [[Ringing Deeps]]. They have seized the power generators there and are rerouting the electricity somewhere else.

We do not know their directive, but I am not keen to find out.

Dismantle their operation and I will see that you are adequately rewarded.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

*[[Severed Threads Commendation]]
*[[The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation]]
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]]
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]

==Progress==
Have you ended the operation?

==Completion==
The Councilward will be pleased to hear that the Waterworks are back in earthen hands.

Good work, outlander.
