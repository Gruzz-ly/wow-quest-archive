'''Lorewalking''' introduces players to the [[Lorewalking]] concept, added in [[patch 11.1.7]].

==Objectives==
Find [[Lorewalker Cho]] in [[Dornogal]], [[Stormwind]], or [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
Are you curious about your world's history? Would you like to learn more?

Lorewalker Cho has been traveling and gathering stories of important events and figures across [[Azeroth]] and beyond. If you pay him a visit in your capital city, he will gladly share a tale of the past with you!

Or perhaps more than one tale. He does very much enjoy conversation!

Tell him [[Lali the Assistant|Assistant Lali]] sent you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
Oh? Lali is sending vistors my way, now?

<Lorewalker Cho laughs a deep, belly laugh.>

Of course she is!

Ah, but she is correct. The only thing I love more than gathering stories is telling them! Sit down, let me share a tale with you.

==Notes==
Find [[Lorewalker Cho]] at {{co|49.6|31.5|Dornogal}} on [[Keepers Terrace]] in [[Dornogal]], at {{co|64.2|16.1|Stormwind City}} by [[Olivia's Pond]] in [[Stormwind City]], or at {{co|54.2|56.6|Orgrimmar}} at the [[Orgrimmar Skyway]] in [[Orgrimmar]]. He has gossip:

{{dialogue|Ah, are you also taking a well-deserved break? There's nothing like catching up on some reading in the fresh air with a great view!

But I would not mind some company. Would you care to hear a story?

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Lorewalking)}} What stories can you tell me?}} ''Opens the Lorewalking interface''

{{gossip|What is Lorewalking?}}

Lorewalking can mean many things, my friend. 

For me, it is the gathering of stories. The many versions of stories... often historical deeds of the heroes of Azeroth. Stories lost to history. Stories so fragmented by time and space, they are difficult for most to piece together.

For you, it means hearing those stories. Ask me to tell you a tale and I humbly believe it will be as though you are experiencing it yourself...
