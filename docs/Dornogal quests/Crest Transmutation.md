==Objectives==
Bring 15 Carved Ethereal Crests to [[Vaskarn]] in [[Dornogal]], then trade them for a Pouch of Weathered Ethereal Crests.
* Transmute to [[Pouch of Weathered Ethereal Crests|Pouch of Weathered Harbinger Crests]]{{sic}}

==Description==
My friend, these Crests are magnificent. It looks like they can be transmuted into different tiers!

If you find yourself no longer in need of a lower-tier Crest, then I can transmute them to be more powerful. I can also transmute Crests into a weaker tier.

Let's practice the transmutation process. Here's a few Carved Ethereal Crests. Speak to me and I can transform them into Weathered Ethereal Crests for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{Cost|23|40}}
*[[Crimson Valorstone]]

==Progress==
If you lose those Carved Ethereal Crests, you can find more from powerful creatures around K'aresh. I've heard there's quite a variety of them!

==Completion==
Remarkable!

Keep in mind I can only transmute Crests into a higher tier when you have outgrown their usefulness, and it will be a costly process. Thank you for all of your help!

==Notes==
On accept, the character receives 15x [[Carved Ethereal Crest]]s.
