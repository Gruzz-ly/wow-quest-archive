'''Archives: Seeking History''' is a [[meta quest]] offered by [[High Speaker Brinthe]] in [[Dornogal]]. It ends in the [[Vault of Memory (Isle of Dorn)|Vault of Memory]], which is accessed via the Waygate inside the [[Archive]] to the west of the [[Coreway]].

==Objectives==
Collect 100 titan disc fragments.

These disc fragments can be looted from dangerous creatures and treasures across [[Khaz Algar]].
*[[Titan Disc Fragment]] (100)

==Description==
We're still processing the data in the [[Archive]] and restoring what we can. But... the discs we've recovered so far in the Archive itself are unusable.

Finding more of these discs are a priority. We must reclaim our memories.

Return what you find to Dagran. He is assisting me in rebuilding the Archive.

==Rewards==
This quest may have additional rewards:
*{{abilities|Weekly Activity|Completing this quest can reward you with a weekly [[:Fractured Spark of Starlight]]. Two Fractured Sparks can be combined into a [[:Spark of Starlight]], which is used by professions to create powerful weapons and armor. If you fall behind on these weekly sparks, completing other max-level content such as [[Delves]], [[Mythic+|Mythic Plus]], [[Raid]]s, Instanced [[PvP]], and some outdoor events may help you catch up. <{{text|uncommon|You have not received your Fractured Spark of Starlight this week.}}/{{text|red|You have already received your Fractured Spark of Starlight this week.}}>|id=1239744|icon=inv_spark_whole_green}}

You will also receive:
*[[Pinnacle Cache]]
*{{cost|46|80|}}
*18,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have ye found anythin'?

==Completion==
;Initial
:More o' them! I wonder what we'll discover this time!

;After all log entries are uncovered
:Thank ye, <name>. Though I believe we've recovered all of Archaedas's log entries, I'd like tae continue repairing the archives.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
*{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|I will see you in the Archive.}}
*{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Bit by bit, we'll get our memories back.}}
*{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Our repair efforts would not be possible without you.}}

Upon every new completion of the quest a new log entry unlocks. The first log entry can be found in the previous quest.

===Second entry===
:{{text|say|Archaedas|On Azeroth, the Pantheon sensed a powerful source of corruption. To protect the Worldsoul, they sent us, the keepers, to lead the titanforged forces into battle.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|In time, we rooted out and defeated the threat, imprisoning its last vestiges in the deep places of the world.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|Then, led by Aman'Thul himself, the titans set toward studying the soul of Azeroth to determine whether it truly was the one they sought.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|To aid the titans, we keepers were tasked with engineering the Manifold--a vast, world-spanning complex of machines, forges and installations.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|Working in tandem, they would bring order to Azeroth, and create a means by which the Pantheon could examine the Worldsoul in depth.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|That corruption the keeper's talking about... that's the Old Gods. That must be why they were here as well--for the power of the Worldsoul...}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Though I've also read that while the titans defeated the Old Gods, they tore a wound in the world. Always thought that was just a metaphor.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|It seems clear now that Azeroth must be the Prime Worldsoul.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|That would explain why the Void, the titans... the Legion... every cosmological force... have sought to control it--or destroy it--over the eons.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|What do you suppose the titans needed to study about it?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We cannot possibly understand the intricacies of the titans' reasons. But that complex Archaedas mentioned--I believe I know what that is about...}}

===Third entry===
:{{text|say|Archaedas|At the titans' command, we keepers began the Acclimation. Each installation, all linked to the Manifold, produced vast numbers of titanforged workers.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|We fired the Great Forges, to fuel the Acclimation and empower the Manifold to heal the ravaged world.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|Then began construction of the Coreway, a direct channel to the heart of Azeroth, that would allow the titans to study the Worldsoul without harming it.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|However, as we delved deeper, we encountered certain obstacles--colossal crystals which we came to realize were calcified chunks of the Worldsoul's essence.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|They are of great power, and I wonder how many yet remain undiscovered beneath the earth, all over the world.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|By word of the great Khaz'goroth, the titans' research has revealed that Azeroth's Worldsoul is indeed the Prime. Our purpose may yet be fulfilled.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Enormous powerful chunks of Worldsoul essence... do you think Beledar, in Hallowfall, could be one of them?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Potentially. But it was never within the scope of our Edicts to study the crystal.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|He mentions the titanforged making the Coreway... did you know it was built to study the Worldsoul?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We were created for the great purpose of serving the titans, and thus we built it. Its purpose was irrelevant to us.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We fulfilled our Edicts dependably, and we have strived to do so throughout the millennia, despite Khaz Algar facing many... setbacks.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Setbacks? What do you mean?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Long ago, the continents of the world split apart, and the machinery that powered our facility was damaged--cut off from the Manifold.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We were unable to repair the connection. We operated on auxiliary power for a time... but eventually it ran out, and we fell into... disarray.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|That must have been the Sundering... it's miraculous that any of this survived intact.}}

===Fourth entry===
:{{text|say|Archaedas|The great Khaz'goroth revealed to me that the corrupting influence of the imprisoned Old Gods was affecting the Worldsoul.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|To protect it, we had the earthen construct the Worldcore--a vast chamber at the heart of the world. There, the Worldsoul will slumber, with only the titans to influence it.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|I must note a disturbing development. As they worked to greater depths, some earthen began to behave erratically. This could not be countenanced.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|Most units were repaired, and continued their work. But some began to physically change, and crystallize. They named themselves "thraegar."}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|These faulty units were so greatly affected that they rebelled against us, attacking and damaging the Worldcore.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|In the course of studying them, it was determined that long exposure to the Worldsoul's energies led to the changes exhibited in their core directives.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|If we cannot prevent this from happening, it will prove catastrophic to not only the Worldcore, but to the Manifold itself. Measures must be taken.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|I... do not recall this happening. That should not be. This "Worldcore" seems as if it was a monumental undertaking.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|And the earthen malfunctioning? How would the Worldsoul's "energy" cause that? This is very confusing.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|By the way, what does he mean by "repaired?"}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Unclear... But what he said about the thraegar rebelling is most disturbing.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|The thraegar? That's what they called gran'da when he first got to Khaz Algar!}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We regard them as legendary champions, almost demigods... to learn that their directives were just... corrupted? That they were anomalies?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Was everything we believed mistaken... or even... a lie?}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Wait--you don't suppose... if the earthen were affected by the Worldsoul's "radiation," the closer they got to it...}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Could it be that it was actually trying to reach your people? Asking for help, like it did with my grand'da?}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|And undoing their directives... was it actually giving them free will?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|I... do not know.}}

===Fifth entry===
:{{text|say|Archaedas|With the danger posed by the rogue thraegar, the great Aman'Thul ordered the rebellion to be quelled and the thraegar hunted down until the threat was neutralized.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|However, the issue of earthen malfunction under the influence of the Worldsoul's energies remained, and so a new solution was devised.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|The earthen of Khaz Algar will relinquish their memories into an Archive to preserve recorded data, and purge the influence of the Worldsoul's energies.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|By initiating this protocol on a regular cadence, we will ensure the thraegar malfunction does not take hold again.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|To secure compliance, the titans have programmed Edicts into the operational earthen to regulate and enforce their discreet functions and efficiency.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|Thus, the earthen will maintain the integrity of the Coreway and the machines of Khaz Algar. Should the Edicts be broken, more permanent failsafes have been set into place.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|With these difficulties behind them, the titans have declared that the Worldsoul remains, dreaming, safely contained within the Worldcore, where no harm will come to it.}}
:{{text|say|Archaedas|I do not know why I commit this information to the Archive--why I risk its discovery in the future. Perhaps the Worldsoul's influence does not extend solely to the earthen.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|What we've learned here... It calls the entire history of Azeroth into question. What if... what if our history isn't what they said it was?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|So the keepers stole our memories, and let us believe that it was for our own good? That it was so we could continue to fulfill our purpose--no, not even our purpose!}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We built the greatest structures the world has ever seen, and they set us to become... maintenance drones, just... cogs in a machine.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|And it does seem that they did it to keep you complacent... obedient. Following their Edicts--and eliminating those of you they couldn't control.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Those Edicts... they were bonds of servitude. And we never even knew.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|And then when the Sundering happened, we were cut off from all of it--and Archaedas never returned to help us. Why didn't he return?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Our entire history--our culture--held in that Archive... I want my memories back. I want ALL our memories back. Damn the titans.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I'm starting to think there's more to the Worldsoul than the titans wanted us to know. That they had other plans for it-- and Azeroth--than we were led to believe.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|What if all of us--even Archaedas himself--have been deceived?}}

==Patch changes==
