==Objectives==
Collect 10 Gleaming Shards and deliver them to [[Nagad]] in [[Dornogal]].
*[[Gleaming Shards]] (10)

==Description==
As [[enchanter]]s, we do not merely trade in runes or wands. Our true commodity is potential. We take the power of possibility and infuse it into tangible forms.

For this, Gleaming Shards are essential. I require several to continue my work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
* 9,250 [[XP]]
*[[Algari Enchanter's Folio]]

==Progress==
Where dust offers versatility, shards confer potential.

==Completion==
Acclamation. These will power many useful enchantments.

==Patch changes==
