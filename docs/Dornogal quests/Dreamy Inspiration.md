*[[Filigree Moon Lamp]] Decor Purchased

==Description==
A crate is nothing more than a box in the dark without lighting.

Today, we go in search of the tiny suns that light our spaces.

Not just any light will suffice. As you can clearly see from my chandelier, we have many lights of varying quality already.

We seek a unique shape, a unique feel.

The crafters of Bel'ameth in the Dragon Isles are well-known for their dream-inspired designs. Travel through the Dragon Isles and you will find them at the far end of the plains.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*[[Small Val'sharah Bookcase]]

==Progress==
You never really know a cabinet until you've checked the hinges.

==Completion==
Your new magical light is quite astonishing! The accents of the finely-curved metal...

In terms of metal balls, I have seen few of its quality. I would place it on a desk or end table. I can see it now!

Though I will have no place to put my scrolls, I must provide something in return. Take my bookshelf, it has served me well.

==Notes==
Find [[Ellandrieth]] in Bel'ameth in [[Amirdrassil]] and purchase Filigree Moon Lamp for {{cost|dis=10}}.
