==Objectives==
Collect 20 Storm Dust and deliver it to [[Nagad]] in [[Dornogal]].
*[[Storm Dust]] (20)

Dust is the foundation of the art of enchantment. Where novice enchanters turn up their noses at such a common material, a master understands its versatility.

Bring me Storm Dust. No matter our expertise, we must always return to the fundamentals.

*{{Cost|27|62}}
* 9,250 [[XP]]
*[[Algari Enchanter's Folio]]

Have you collected the requisite dust?

Gratitude. It is good to see a fellow [[enchanter]] who appreciates the basics.
