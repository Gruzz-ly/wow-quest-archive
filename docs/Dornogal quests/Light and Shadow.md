==Objectives==
Gather 5 Arthor's{{sic}} Spear and 5 Orbinid for [[Akdan]] in [[Dornogal]].
* [[Arathor's Spear]] (5)
* [[Orbinid]] (2)

==Description==
There are two herbs that I am missing.

The first is Arathor's Spear, and the second, and far more rarer, would be Orbinid.

Now I know what you are thinking, these are both rare, to a point, but I am not asking for many and the pay is well worth it.

What do you think? Can I trust you for the task?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 9,250 [[XP]]
*[[Algari Herbalist's Notes]]

==Progress==
Did you get both?

==Completion==
I knew it!

You are one of the best herbal goods supplier I have known.

Here, take this. It is the least I can do.

==Notes==
The items have to be {{profquality|1}} quality.
