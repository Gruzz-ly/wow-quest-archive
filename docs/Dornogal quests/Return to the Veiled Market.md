'''Return to the Veiled Market''' unlocks the portal to [[K'aresh]] from [[Dornogal]] during the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]].

Once the first character in the warband completes the campaign through chapter three ([[The Tabiqa]]), gets their [[Reshii Wraps]], and completes the [[Phase Diving]] quests through [[The Untethered Horror]], alts can skip ahead to the same point by speaking with [[Om'en]] after landing in Tazavesh, then fly directly to [[Hashim]] at {{co|50.3|36.3|K'aresh}} to pick up their Reshii Wraps.
{{dialogue|I see that you are answering Locus-Walker's call again?

{{gossip|I have heard this tale before. {{text|red|<Skip the "The Knife's Edge" campaign up to "Shadows En Garde" chapter as well as the questline "Diving into Phase Diving".>}}}}}}

==Objectives==
Accompany Locus-Walker and [[Alleria]] to [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]].
*Follow [[Locus-Walker]]
*Take the [[Spatial Rift (Dornogal)|Spatial Rift]] to [[Tazavesh]]

==Description==
I have been retained by the [[K'aresh Trust]], a coalition of both [[broker]] and [[ethereal]] [[cartel]]s who seek to reclaim [[K'aresh]]. The Trust is in desperate need of one of your skills, <name>.

The [[Shadowguard]] assaults our city and threatens the work of the eco-dome project.

Please accompany me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Tazavesh, both of you.

We have much to discuss. Your assistance is crucial, as always.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|The [[K'aresh Trust]] has tasked me with stopping [[Dimensius]] and defending Tazavesh.}}
:''Locus-Walker and Alleria walk over to the Alliance portal to the north.''
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The [[broker]]s are from K'aresh?}}
:{{Text|say|Locus-Walker|The All-Devouring's attack left us [[refugee]]s. The [[Shadowlands]] demanded stronger containment suits than our wraps.}}
:''He opens a Spatial Rift in a nook.''

Follow Locus-Walker and Alleria to the portal and take it. An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Entering Tazavash" plays out:

:''The adventurer, Alleria, and Locus-Walker arrive at [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market]]. It is filled with the brokers but also ethereals as well''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|Time grows short. Dimensius the All-Devouring stirs.}}

:''The camera cuts to the [[Observer]] who greets the adventurer. The Adventurer bumps into a broker with four legs''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|Like the K'areshi people the All-Devouring was merely shattered and dispersed.}}
:''The camera cuts to a wide shot revealing K'aresh''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|On [[Outland|every]] [[Argus|world]] the [[Shadowguard]] assaulted they searched for fragments of their master.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|I have a new ally who revealed the Shadowguard's methods and treacheries to me.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Locus-Walker|Come. We are on the hunt.}}
