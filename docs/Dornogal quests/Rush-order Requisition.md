==Objectives==
Gather 5 Aqirite and 5 Ironclaw Ore, and deliver them to [[Tarib]] in [[Dornogal]].
* [[Aqirite]] (5)
* [[Ironclaw Ore]] (5)

==Description==
Good to see you, I've got work.

The [[Smith|blacksmiths]] just sent a last-minute requisition for rare ores. Gravel-munching hammer-heavers, would it kill them to plan ahead? Well, I'm sure you can handle it.

Looks like you'll need to track down Aqirite and Ironclaw Ore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 9,250 [[XP]]
*[[Algari Miner's Notes]]

==Progress==
Do you have them? The smiths have been chewing my ear off.

==Completion==
Excellent work. These ores will be greatly appreciated.

==Notes==
*{{profquality|1}} items are needed.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
