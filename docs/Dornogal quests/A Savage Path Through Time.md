==Objectives==
Complete 5 Timewalking dungeons.
* [[Timewalking]] [[dungeon]]s completed (5)

==Description==
Ever since your city fell out of the sky, I have learned more of this world's history and the challenges that heroes like yourself have faced.

Learning from the past is how we ensure our future. Walk through time to a past limed with hellfire to defeat those threats once more and bring those lessons forward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Cache of K'areshi Treasures]]

==Progress==
We [[Machine Speakers]] operate in the present moment, but learn much from our past. Imagining another possible past for our people... there is much I might change. 

==Completion==
You are returned and our reality has not unraveled itself, so I take it you were successful.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.2.0|note=Now rewards [[Cache of K'areshi Treasures]] (was [[Cache of Undermine Treasures]]).}}
*{{Patch 11.1.0|note=Now rewards [[Cache of Undermine Treasures]] (was [[Cache of Nerubian Treasures]]).}}
