==Objectives==
Listen to Cho to learn the story of Xal'alath in [[Ny'alotha]].
*Talk to [[Lorewalker Cho]] to learn of [[Xal'atath]]'s distant past
*Report to the Faceless General

==Description==
Many years ago, a stone tablet from [[Stormsong Valley]] made its way into my library.

It took years to break the cipher and translate the fragments of runes etched into it.

I will tell you what we have pieced together. A tale of yet more treachery...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
You are chosen, pitiful though you are. Be grateful.
