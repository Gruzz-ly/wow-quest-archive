==Objectives==
Find [[Marbb]] in the [[Forgegrounds]] and use her leatherworker's bench.
* Use the leatherworker's tool bench

==Description==
So you are a leatherworker? You should have mentioned that earlier!

Let me send you to Marbb, a leatherworker of great renown, who has her shop on the eastern side of the Forgegrounds. I will mark it on your map.

Marbb has her very own leatherworker's bench where you can review, craft, and deliver work orders from public lists and personal contacts like friends and guilds. If you are lucky, you might come across an order from a renowned person that offers some extra rewards--or so I hear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Welcome! Please make use of my bench if you need it.

==Completion==
I am glad I could help you, <class>.
