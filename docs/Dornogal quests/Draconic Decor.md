*[[Draconic Sconce]] Decor Purchased

==Description==
The chandelier I showed you? You must think it so fancy.

But here I am without the matching sconces!

What room lighting can I create without matching sconces? It will be woefully incomplete!

Head over to the Dragon Isles and see if you can find one from the vendors of Valdrakken.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*[[Valdrakken Chandelier]]

==Progress==
How do these lights stay lit? It is their nature.

==Completion==
Ah! You have located the sconces, then. I shall head over and purchase some myself at once, thank you!

Just as soon as you are not looking.

==Notes==
[[Draconic Sconce]] decor is sold by [[Unatos]] in the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]] for {{cost|dis=10}}.
