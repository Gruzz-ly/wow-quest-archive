==Objectives==
Defeat any World Boss and 5 rare creatures in Khaz Algar.
*World boss slain
*Rare creatures slain (5)

==Description==
[[Hallowfall]] is not the only land beset by enemies.

Great monsters wander all of [[Khaz Algar]]--savage beasts and intelligent fiends alike. They murder [[Arathi]], [[earthen]], and [[adventurer]]s in equal measure from innocent [[farmer]]s to great [[warrior]]s. 

I know the [[Sacred Flame]] burns in you. You are our best hope to hunt these great evils.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18}}
*15,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've seen monsters shifting in the distant darkness of Hallowfall. Things that haunt my nightmares.

==Completion==
How did you fare? Any new scars? Or new tales to tell?

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
