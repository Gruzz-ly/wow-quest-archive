==Objectives==
Defeat 20 cumulative waves of enemies in the [[Awakening Machine]].
*Awakening Machine waves defeated (20)

==Description==
The [[earthen]] tell me of this "Awakening Machine" that is part of their life cycle.

It imbues them with energy, once a gift of the [[titan]]s but now from the [[Azeroth (titan)|Worldsoul]].

<[[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] smiles faintly and nods knowingly.>

They hold it in high reverence--as we do [[Beledar]].

I will fight to defend it with the same fervor as I would defend our own star!

Aid, me <name>. We can't let them down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18|}}
* 650 [[XP]]
* (Max level) [[Pinnacle Cache]]
* (Level 70-79) [[Algari Adventurer's Cache]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
<Faerin looks curiously at a group of nearby earthen.>

I would like to know more about the earthen and their beliefs--and the Awakening Machine. Do you think it's rude to ask?

==Completion==
Wonderful! I know our earthen allies appreciate your aid.
