==Objectives==
Meet [[Bondaz]] in [[Crossroads Plaza]].

==Description==
Hello, outlander. Do you want to know about news from outside [[Dornogal|the city]]?

The Crossroads is a key place for earthen to exchange information and goods, no matter their allegiances or edicts.

My friend Bondaz unofficially maintains the square. He would be delighted to see you in person. I'm sure he has already heard a hundred different stories of how you and the outlanders made it to [[Isle of Dorn|our isle]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
...An outlander? You are real! Just like the others that have stopped by. There are so many of you!

I can't believe my eyes. I know everything about the isle, but could not have fathomed this.
