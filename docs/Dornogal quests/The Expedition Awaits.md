'''The Expedition Awaits''' is the first quest in the [[Siren Isle campaign]], added with the launch of [[Patch 11.0.7]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Skaggit]] by the [[East Gate]] of [[Dornogal]].

==Description==
Greetings, <name>! Are you here to answer the [[Siren Isle]]'s call to adventure?

Recently, a [[goblin]] salvage team discovered an isle with a strange "singing crystal" at its center.

Like the goblins, the [[Arathi]] of [[Hallowfall]] have taken a keen interest in this crystal--as have we. We've been preparing an expedition to the isle!

Most of the expedition has gone ahead, but the goblins last vessel is set to leave momentarily.

If you hurry, you can catch them before they leave and join us!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
Ah, so you're the one Dawn convinced to join us, eh?

Well, hurry up! They've been adamant about getting us a proper [[Stormrider]]-ranger-whatever escort out of the city, but it's takin' too long!

The Arathi and other earthen are already on the Isle and [[Ricket]] is probably wonderin' where the heck we are!

C'mon! I can give you the deets on the way!

==Notes==
In front of Dawn are [[Chief Officer Hammerflange]], a [[Greasemonkey Surveyor]], and a [[Zeppelin Engineer]]. She is accompanied by [[Stormranger Guide]]s, [[Saradi]], a [[Mole Machine Operator]], [[Alta]], and [[Flint]].

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Dawn|Imagine: a giant crystal that sings! We're investigating on Siren Isle. Care to join us?}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Officer Hammerflange|Finally, some excitement!}}
:{{Text|say|Zeppelin Engineer|It's about time!}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Officer Hammerflange|Well, what are you waiting for?}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Officer Hammerflange|Let's get moving!}}
:{{Text|say|Greasemonkey Surveyor|Yea, yea. We know! We know!}}
:''The goblins run out of the hall.''

{{Gossip|Are you joining the expedition to the Siren Isle?}}

<Dawn beams with excitement.>

Of course! This will be my first time departing the shores of [[Khaz Algar]]. I can think of no better way than to venture forth from my home and see the world!

I won't be accompanying you on the goblins air-vessel, however. With the support of Moira Bronzebeard's dark irons, High Speaker Brinthe has secured us an alternative route to the Siren Isle.

She called them "mole machines." I am most intrigued.

A few of the Awakened were not so keen to travel long-distance over the open waters so we will be departing from Gundargaz soon.

I hope to see you on the island, my friend!

Head to the landing site at {{Co|72.2|5.3|Dornogal}}. [[Vokgret]], [[Navigator Hatch]], [[Fergus Gearchum]] walk toward the platform and stand on the right side.

:{{Text|emote|Vokgret winks at <name> knowingly.}}

Present are [[Crewman Boltshine]], [[Earthen Stormranger]]s, [[Captain Krazz]], Hammerflange and the Surveyors and Engineers. On the zeppelin are [[Watcher Du'una]], [[Crewman Cutpipe]], [[Watcher Umjin]], [[Crewman Spinshaft]], [[Sky-Captain Cableclamp]], and [[Skaggit]]. [[Mounted Stormranger]]s are flying around.

{{Dialogue|title=Fergus Gearchum|
It's good to be serve'n under Captain Krazz again, though I will say I'm equally excited to be able to work with Sky-Captain Cableclamp! Her laid back attitude is legendary.

I'm glad she was able to find work after [[the Purple Princess]]'s [[zeppelin]] circuit from [[Brill]] to [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]] was, uh, 'decommissioned'.

{{Gossip|What do you know about the Siren Isle?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Honestly I ain't ever heard of it before now. But I haven't been in the air as long as Krazz or some of the other zeppelin [[Captain (rank)|captains]].

<Fergus shrugs.>

Seems like a perfect time for new stories to me!
}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=Captain Krazz|
Man, am I glad to be back in the air again! Well, I guess 'consulting' is more the correct term.

For a sea voyage as long this, it only makes sense they pulled a seasoned pilot like myself out of retirement! I did even fly a [[Warchief]] or two into battle after all.

I hear this island has a lotta storms or somethin'. Ah, it reminds me of my days back in the [[Second War]], ferry'n troops around...

<Captain Kazz grins widely.>

Anyway, Cableclamp is a great captain, so rest assured she'll getcha where ya need to go.

{{Gossip|What do you know about the Siren Isle?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
During my time in the Second War, I heard tale of an island so cursed that no [[Kul Tiran]] [[sailor]] worth their salt would ever venture there. I'm pretty sure this is the same isle, so hopefully this won't be a 'set out and never return' scenario.

Still it begs the question; what was so scary about this island that ingrained itself in generations of Kul Tiran sailors? Hopefully we don't find out- there's no way the hazard pay would cover somethin' like that.

<Krazz pauses.>

Actually, with [[Gazlowe]]'s new 'Hazard Pay Initiative' maybe it would. Back in my day we never would've had coverage like this!

<Krazz scrunches up his nose.>

Still, if it is in favor of new expeditions... well, I can't fault Gazlowe's deep pockets, eh?

{{Dialogue|title=Watcher Du'una|
You headin' to the Siren Isle?

<Du'una grimaces around her tusks and spits.>

I told Cableclamp dis is a bad omen. I've heard stories about de [[siren]]s. In [[zandali]], we call dem "bwon'tulak." Death Singers. Terrible creatures.

I am blessed. I never encountered dem before in all my time flyin' over de seas. But now we're headin' for a place named after dem?

<Du'una bows and shakes her head.>

May [[Shango]] guide de winds.

{{Dialogue|title=Watcher Umjin|
Feels good to be back on de open air!

Never felt right after we all went on strike with Cableclamp. Her contractors weren't payin' any of us--her included! So she brought the Princess down. Eventually we went our own separate ways for a while.

But we be back and ready to fly! Ha ha!

Except Du'una. She's afraid of de bwon'tulak, which I don't blame her.

We're sailin' right into stormy weathers, but Shango always watchin' over us in de storms!
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Sky-Captain Cableclamp|
Welcome aboard, <class>!

The [[Princess's Pride]] is nearly ready to head back to the Siren Isle! You ready to go?

{{Gossip|What do you know about the Siren Isle?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Siren Isle?

Well, I never heard of it referred to as that, but it makes sense--what with the stories of the sirens and all.

My cousin [[Captain Krooz|Krooz]] used to tell me stories of all the places she used to smuggle to.

Always told me of this one spooky place with nasty storms around it and even nastier singin' ladies!

Apparently her buddies in [[Freehold]] are scared hatless of the place--so much that she started avoidin' it outta principle. And, well, for business reasons.

Of course, I didn't clue in that this was the place until I was already in Dornogal. Go figure, huh?

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}

Approach the zeppelin:
:{{Text|say|Skaggit|Hey, welcome aboard! The [[earthen]] and the Arathi are on the island already. We gotta catch up!}}

{{Dialogue|title=Skaggit|
Heya, pal! Ready to embark on a thrilling adventure?

{{Gossip|Where are we going?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Wouldn't you and half of [[Khaz Algar]] want to know!

First the Arathi and earthen are all askin' about it, then next thing you know, they're heading off in [[Arathi airship|their airships]] and [[mole machine]]s!

Oh, if I still had my [[rocket drill]] contacts, I betcha I coulda gotten us there faster!

But fine, ya wanna know?

We're headin' to the Siren Isle. Ever heard of it?

{{Gossip|No.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Of course you haven't--no one has!

Well, unless you're from [[Boralus]], of course.

According to the Kul Tirans, this "Siren Isle" is a place of legend and myth. Lots of stories and old sea-tales, all of them real spooky like.

Some nasty storms too!

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}
{{Gossip|{{Text|rare|Kul Tiran}} Aye, I've heard of it.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<Skaggit's raises his brow a bit as he looks up at you.>

No kidding... you've heard of this place? Is it as bad as they say? Ricket said her crew was on edge the whole time!

I met a [[tidesage]] at [[Stonelight Rest]] last week. He told me that nuthin' good comes from that place.

"If the Siren's Call don't lure you to your death, the storms will," he said.

Makes ya wonder what's lurkin' around on the isle, don't it?

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}}}
{{Gossip|What do you know about the Siren Isle?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Almost nothin', unfortunately. I put my best guys on it to see what they could dig up.

They didn't find much; just a few tales from Boralus. The oldest record we could find was some Kul Tiran fable or somethin' warning us of the dangers of 'The Call', whatever that means.

Couldn't find any charts or nothin'. Seems like a place most have steered clear from, but it sounds like an opportunity if ya ask me!

Thankfully Ricket and my ground crew gave us enough data to work with so we could find our way back.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}

{{Gossip|Who are you? Where's Gazlowe?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The name's Skaggit, and I'm Galzowe's{{sic}} assistant. I lead the [[Gazlowe's Greasemonkeys|Greasemonkeys]] and am generally in charge of most ventures Monte is too busy to run.

Which is almost everything these days.

<Skaggit sighs.>

Bein' part of the [[Horde Council]] doesn't give him a lotta free time. And with his recent business in Khaz Algar lately... well, I'm here to be his eyes and ears out in the field when he can't be.

The Greasemonkeys will always get the job done! Whatever and wherever it is.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|Where is [[Lady Sena]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Eh, there's some new construction venture she's real excited about right now, so she didn't have the time to come with.

What could be more exciting than a singin' crystal? Whatever, she's missin' out.

<Skaggit shrugs and waves his hand.>
