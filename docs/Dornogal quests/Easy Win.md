*{{Cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Seems fortune favors the bold--and the skilled at cards. Our friend [[Millhouse Manastorm|Millhouse]] wasn't exactly happy to part ways with this scroll, or all of the rest of his belongings for that matter.

Take it, <race>. It's the least I can do for everything you did for the [[Dalaran]] survivors.
