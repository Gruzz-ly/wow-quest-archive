==Objectives==
Listen to Lorewalker Cho to learn the story of Xal'alath during the [[Fourth War]].
*Talk to [[Lorewalker Cho]] to learn of [[Xal'atath]]'s gambit
*Aid Xal'atath across [[Kul Tiras]] and [[Zandalar]]

==Description==
Though now only a blade of little power, Xal'atath was not idle. In the aftermath of the [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|Legion invasion]], tensions between the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]] erupted into the Fourth War.

Xal'atath took advantage of the many forces at play in the war in a gambit to restore her power...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*[[Lorewalker's Crate of Memorabilia]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]
*3x [[Weathered Undermine Crest]]

==Progress==
The Fourth War was a bitter one. After working together to defeat the Legion, many thought tensions between the Horde and the Alliance were much resolved. 

But old wounds do not heal so easily...

==Completion==
I believe the information my fellow Lorewalkers and I have found is completely new. I am unsure of its importance, but perhaps you can decide.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|After the Legion was defeated, Azeroth erupted into the Fourth War. In the midst of the chaos, Xal'atath made her next move.}}
:''Cho's story takes players to [[Atal'Gral]] in [[Zuldazar]] for Horde players or the [[Jeweled Coast]] in [[Stormsong Valley]] for Alliance players.''
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Here, Xal'atath came before the High Priest once more with promises of power.}}

Characters who did the storyline in {{g|bfa}} get bonus gossip from Cho if he is summoned:
{{Dialogue|It was you, wasn't it? You found Xal'atath and helped free her from the dagger. 

Let us keep that information between us. Some may not take so kindly to you, with that knowledge.}}

Pick up [[Every Little Death Helps (priest)]] and fill the bar by killing enemies in the area. Return to the altar to turn in, then pick up [[Unintended Consequences (priest)]]:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The High Priest journeyed to stop the followers of N'Zoth, an Old God--a dark creature who sought to corrupt our world. Let us have Mishi speed this story along, shall we?}}

The projection of [[Mishi]] will appear during the questline to skip the adventurer ahead to quest areas. At {{co|20|36|Drustvar}} at [[Falcon's Rest]] in [[Drustvar]], progress Unintended Consequences by interrupting the ritual. Turn in the quest to Xal'atath and pick up [[The Pirate's Treasure]]:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Did the High Priest foresee the consequences of their actions here? Regardless, they traveled to Freehold. Mishi can help us get there safely.}}

Take Mishi to [[Freehold]] at {{co|75|79|Tiragarde Sound}} in [[Tiragarde Sound]], finish The Pirate's Treasure, then turn it in and pick up [[The Tempest Crown]]:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Xal'atath required one final artifact from the High Priest. Shall Mishi move us along?}}

Hop on Mishi again to get to the [[Bouldered Bluffs]] at {{co|52|14|Vol'dun}} in [[Vol'dun]]. Progress, finish, and turn in the quest, then pick up [[Twist the Knife]]:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The pieces were falling into place. Only one task remained. Let us have Mishi hasten the journey.}}

Mount Mishi one final time as she flies away:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Xal'atath often whispered to the High Priest about the Old Gods and their [[Black Empire]]. We have fought countless wars against them as they seek to turn our world to Void.}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Finally, N'Zoth was the only one who remained. He was waiting, patiently, for his moment to strike.}}

Mishi drops players off in the [[Tendril of Corruption]] of the [[Crucible of Storms]]:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|In Xal'atath, N'Zoth found an unexpected collaborator.}}

Progress Twist the Knife as normal by placing the objects and watching the cutscene. As it completes, Cho returns the adventurer back to Dornogal, Stormwind, or Orgrimmar:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Xal'atath was freed from the blade and took a mortal form. Her past remained a mystery, but we Lorewalkers are never satisfied with an incomplete story.}}

Complete Twist the Knife, which has special completion text:
{{dialogue|N'zoth's gift was a dark one, indeed.}}

Then turn in The Blade's Gambit to continue.

Lorewalker Cho has new dialogue options:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Tell me more about N'Zoth, his "gift," and Ny'alotha.}}

There are those who would say that N'Zoth was the weakest of the Old Gods. A misconception, perhaps, for research would indicate that N'Zoth was responsible for many of the troubles that plagued our world.

It was N'Zoth who corrupted the black dragon Neltharion into Deathwing. N'Zoth who was responsible for twisting Queen Azshara and her Highborne into the naga. It is even said that N'Zoth helped craft the Emerald Nightmare!

For a "weak" creature, N'Zoth was still a force to be reckoned with.

{{Gossip|Tell me more about the Gift of N'Zoth.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The so-called Gift of N'Zoth allowed one to easily discern who had allied with the Old God and speak with them. Indeed, it is said that his gift granted the ability to speak the language of the Old Gods themselves...

Yet one must wonder what the cost of such a gift truly was. If you chose to embrace this gift, you accepted N'Zoth's dominion, did you not?}}

{{Gossip|Tell me more about Ny'alotha.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Ny'alotha... a home of the Old Gods and their minions. Not a place so much as a different reality--a vision in which the Black Empire had been restored and conquered our world.

N'Zoth sought to merge Azeroth with his twisted version of reality. But the heroes of our world put an end to his plans before they could succeed.}}
