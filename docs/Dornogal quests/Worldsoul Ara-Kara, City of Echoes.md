'''Worldsoul: Ara-Kara, City of Echoes''' is a [[meta quest]] that may be offered as part of the weekly [[The Call of the Worldsoul]] quest from [[Faerin Lothar]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Objectives==
Complete the [[Ara-Kara, City of Echoes]] dungeon on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> difficulty or higher.

==Description==
Information from [[Azj-Kahet]] comes more in the form of... whispers than reports. We need more information.

There's hints of a city beneath the city. [[Ara-Kara]], they call it. We don't know the details, but they are doing something with [[Black Blood]] down there.

We need to find out what's going on. Bring together your strongest companions and investigate!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18|}}
* 15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Pinnacle Cache]] (level 80)
*[[Algari Adventurer's Cache]] (level 70–79)
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You're back! I was worried. Tell me everything.

<Faerin looks you over.>

Those spiders didn't... do anything to you, did they? Didn't... plant eggs under your cloak or something?

<Faerin shivers.>
