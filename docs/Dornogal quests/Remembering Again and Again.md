==Objectives==
Report back to [[Soridormi]].

==Description==
Now that we have the hourglass calibrated to you, you can re-enter Horrific Visions whenever you like. No need for keys when traveling back in time!

That said, we do face one limitation. The hourglass is still fragile, and I must harden it week to week to support additional [[Echo of N'zoth|Echoes of N'Zoth]]. Who knew that memories of an Old God were so dangerous...?

Well, you should report back to Soridormi and get back to it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
As Augermu told you--with the help of the hourglass, you can now enter the [[Horrific Visions]] as much as you like.

One more thing--we have identified some key memories within each of the visions. Through them, you will find additional [[Corrupted Mementos|boons]] specific to that vision that allow you to remain longer and explore more.

I will add descriptions in the vision's [[Chamber of Heart|Heart Chamber]] to help you find or unlock these boons.

==Notes==
Upon completion:
:{{Text|Say|Soridormi|Continue reliving these visions, champion. The more we understand the past, the better we can face the threats of the present.}}
