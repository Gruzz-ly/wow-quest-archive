HELL COMES FOR YOU!

Now that we have your attention, please be warned that shards of brimstone have entered this world. They are warm to the touch and should not, under any circumstances, be stabbed into your head, the head of anyone else, or any other vital organ of you or anyone near you.

Please bring any shards you find IMMEDIATELY to us in Dornogal.

And if you see any tiny little minions carrying a bag of treasures, KILL THEM ON SIGHT.

We appreciate your interest in aiding us.

Shards of our timeline have made their way into your world. It is a place more grim and dark than your own, where some villains became heroes and some heroes never had the chance.

Help us locate these hellish fragments out of time and return them to their rightful place, and we will provide you with armors tempered by the fires of our world.

And should you find any [[Treasure Goblin (mob)|Treasure Goblins]] that lurk in your world, we implore you to slay the abominations.
