==Objectives==
Complete any Delve.
*Delve Completed

==Description==
My calculations need a lot more data. I've got another upgrade card nearly finished, but I'm not sure if it will integrate properly.

But if ye go back into the delve spaces and defeat more of the enemies, I can see how they react. Based on their reactions, I can put the final touches on this upgrade for yer belt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Titan Memory Card]]
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can't wait to see the data!

==Completion==
Hmm, as I suspected. Yes... I need to adjust this here... done.

The good news is that this upgrade will nae make yer belt explode! I thought there was a small chance, but no longer. Yer data proved that I set the power too high. So... good thing I had ye do tha' extra check, right?
