Complete World Quests in Undermine.
*[[World quest|World Quests]] completed in [[Undermine]] (6)

==Description==
Undermine may be a place I do not understand, but they too are in need of aid. Our conflicts inflame their situation, it would do good to help them move forward.

Go there and help them. See what you can do to bring these... [[Cartels of Undermine|cartels]] closer together, and to us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*~{{cost|50}}
*15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Pinnacle Cache]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
Undermine is very strange to me. Still, when a friend asks for help... you help them.

==Completion==
You made some extraordinary efforts on some... unique requests. Your service to Undermine is appreciated by all.
