'''A Sassy Arathi''' becomes available after completing the main [[Hallowfall storyline]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Peacekeeper Leif]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Description==
I had heard that [[Lamplighter Kaerter|an Arathi]] was making trouble in the city. It sounds like he is butting heads with the peacekeepers.

You've worked with the [[Arathi]] before, haven't you? Maybe you'd be able to smooth over any ruffled feathers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yes, how can I help you?

==Notes==
Head to [[Crossroads Plaza]] and approach a pair of [[Dornogal Citizen (Isle of Dorn)|Dornogal Citizens]]:
:{{Text|say|Dornogal Citizen (1)|Did you hear? There's an Arathi making trouble in Dornogal.}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Dornogal Citizen (2)|More Arathi showing up? Now what do they want?}}
:{{Text|say|Dornogal Citizen (1)|At least it's just the one this time. He's something called a [[Lamplighter]].}}

Head to [[Access & Amenities]] in [[Stoneshaper's Atrium]] and approach Peacekeeper Leif talking to a [[Peacekeeper Lieutenant]]:
:{{Text|say|Peacekeeper Lieutenant|Enough! [[Peacekeepers]] do not gallivant across the countryside. Now take care of this Arathi troublemaker, Leif!}}
:{{Text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|Yes sir.}}

==Progression==
