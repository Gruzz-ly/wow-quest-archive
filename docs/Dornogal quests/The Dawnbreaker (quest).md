==Objectives==
[[Biergoth]] wants you to go to [[The Dawnbreaker]] and help [[General Steelstrike]] with securing the ceremony.
*Help General Steelstrike with securing the ceremony

==Description==
I have received word from General Steelstrike of the [[Arathi]]. She asked for you to attend a ceremony aboard The Dawnbreaker.

By attending, she means she needs an extra pair of eyes--maybe two or five. Have you ever secured a ceremony before? It feels like a puddle of sticky mud down in the [[Forgegrounds]].

I'm sorry, but General Steelstrike asked, and I replied with a simple "yes." As the saying goes, not every hill is going to be exciting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[The Severed Threads Commendation]]
*[[The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation]]
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]]
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[The K'aresh Trust Commendation]]

==Progress==
I know ceremonies are not your cup of cinderbrew. They are not mine either, but our job is important.

==Completion==
I received word that the ceremony was more of a mudslide than a sticky mud puddle.

I am happy that you were there.
