==Objectives==
Use the Prismatic Codex to view the Memory Gem. Then, return the Memory Gem to the Archival Repository in The [[Archive]].
*Prismatic Codex used to view [[Earthen Memory Gem|memory gem]]
*Memory gem deposited in [[Archival Repository]]

==Description==
The memory gem you recovered is what its name suggests. It contains an [[earthen]]'s memories, directives, and a hard coding of our Edicts.

This building, the Archive, is the nexus of our civilization. Here, memories are cycled, catalogued, and stored at the end of an earthen's scheduled rotation.

With the codex I have invented, we can access one or two memories from a memory gem. Take it, and read the memory gem you found.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|4}}
*5,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The operating instructions are simple. Insert the gem into the device, and a memory will play.

==Completion==
It is... comforting that Odon will be preserved in the Archive.

==Notes==

An extra action button appears:
:{{abilities|Prismatic Codex|View a memory from an earthen's memory gem.|cd=10 sec|notes=Instant|id=446651}}
:''An image of [[Odon]] appears.''
:{{text|say|Odon|Nerubians everywhere! Look out--}}
:''Odon back-steps, but is attacked and falls over dead.''
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|It was Odon... I knew him. His memory will be preserved.}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Please deposit his memory gem into the Archives' repository.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|So, the Archive holds every earthen's memories? Can ye view them?}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Dagran, this may be a solemn ritual for them...}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|His query is valid. Yes, but the Archive has been inaccessible for thousands of years.}}

Head up the stairs and interact with the [[Archival Repository]] to deposit the gem.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Thank you. Keep the device. You may find use of it if you find more memory gems.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Dagran, this seems like a place ye'd be keen to explore. I'll be back for ye when I know it's safe.}}
:''Moira walks away.''

After completing the quest, [[Dagran Thaurissan II]] has gossip:

{{dialogue|What kind o' luck do I have? My first venture out o' [[Ironforge]] an' I find myself in a land untouched by time.

An' the first buildin' I walk into is basically a library!

Did I die in the crash? Is this heaven? Nerubians aside, it feels like it.

I'm keen to learn all I can about the earthen--especially if it'll help my ma.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Can I ask you another question, Speaker Brinthe?}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Yes, small one. My current directive is to answer your questions.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Fantastic! I'm much obliged. Hm. Where to start?}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|How long has Dornogal been here?}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Unknown. Our Archive would contain that information, but as I said, it is non-functioning.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I should be writin' this down. I'm standin' here with a livin' relic! ...no offense.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Can ye give me a rough estimate?}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|The Archive's last access date was approximately five thousand years ago.}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|But Dornogal itself has been here much longer, since before the [[Sundering]] that we believe damaged our machines.}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Unfortunately, our memories from that time have been overwritten.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Overwritten? Ye mean in the Archive? Or... your memory personally?}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|An earthen's memories are erased upon recharging. Hence, the need to upload our memory gems to the Archive with each charge cycle.}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|I am not offended. But we are unfortunately in decline. Without a way to recharge, we will eventually all enter stasis.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|When will tha happen?}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Sooner for some than others. In the next ten centuries, we will all cease to function.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I'm... sorry to hear tha'.}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Do not worry. We Machine Speakers are working hard to reinitiate the machines.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I hope it works, Speaker. Truly.}}
