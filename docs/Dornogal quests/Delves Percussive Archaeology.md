==Objectives==
Recover 30 Khaz Algar Archeological Fragments from [[Delves]] in [[Khaz Algar]].
* [[Khaz Algar Archaeological Fragments]] (30)

==Description==
I've been investigatin' all of the interesting looking pieces we've found in our travels. Many of them are critical tae [[Azeroth]]'s history! And those rotters in the delves are just smashin' them up without a care in the world!

Let's put a stop tae it and recover what we can. I bet if we went up against one of the really tough crowds, they'd have loads of fragments for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 18,300 [[XP]]
* [[Pinnacle Cache]]

==Progress==
I cannae believe that some folks don't care about history. Just makes me sad.

==Completion==
We may have just got fragments, <name>. But With fragments, ye can rebuild it. Ye can see what it once was.

Fragments are better than dust, is all I'm saying.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|I'll go ahead and pack the supplies. See ye down below!}}

Each run, regardless of tier, awards 10 fragments.
