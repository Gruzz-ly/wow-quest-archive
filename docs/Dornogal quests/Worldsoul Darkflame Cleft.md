==Objectives==
Complete the [[Darkflame Cleft]] dungeon on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> difficulty or higher.

==Description==
[[Kobold]]s! They can be vicious critters but-- oh, I can't help but feel a certain kinship with them!

Their little candles... keeping their little flames lit...

<[[Faerin]] clasps her hand to her chest with a grin.>

So brave! They would be ideal [[Lamplighter]]s, if only they would share! And... were less likely to claw your eyes out.

Reports of their activities in Darkflame Cleft have the [[earthen]] worried. Though I wish the kobolds were kinder, we can't allow them to hurt our allies. Please investigate!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18|}}
*15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])
