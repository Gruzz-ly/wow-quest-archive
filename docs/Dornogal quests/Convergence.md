'''Convergence''' concludes the Earthen Fissures chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[Group Effort]].

==Objectives==
Return to [[Foundation Hall]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Description==
We know the [[nerubian]]s are in league with [[Xal'atath]]. An' we have a fair idea why they attacked us--and [[Dalaran]].

They seem bent on destroying the [[earthen]]--even kickin' 'em when they're down.

But why? Is it because the [[Coreway]] is the key an' destroyin' it was nae enough? Maybe what we're doin' here, repairin' the Coreway, is just what they dunnae want us to do.

We should go back to Dornogal an try to piece this together.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Congealed Cinderbrew Gloves]]
* [[Congealed Cinderbrew Pauldrons]]
* [[Congealed Cinderbew Cinch]]
* [[Congealed Cinderbrew Battleboots]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+2,500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 500x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Completion==
The earthen Council is reunited. Hopefully they can put the past aside an' get the Coreway repaired.

Then hopefully they'll help us with the nerubians--an' Xal'atath.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|They're retreating! Your cinderbrew makes for quite the weapon, Wenbrandt.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Meet us at the Foundation Hall, <name>. The fight against the nerubians is far from over.}}
:''They run off.''

On return, the [[Council of Dornogal]] is back together as all four thrones have someone in them:
:{{text|say|Merrix|I am glad you're back, Adelgonn. The Council is needed here in Dornogal more than ever.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|It is time we stand as one and strike back against the nerubians.}}

This fulfills the Earthen Fissures criterion of [[The Isle of Dorn (achievement)]].

At [[Foundation Hall]] one can speak to the gathered council members and also [[Wenbrandt]]:

{{Dialogue|title=[[Merrix]]|
The future is still an unknown value, but with Adelgonn back, and Brinthe here in the High Speaker's stead, the Council is as it had been for thousands of years.

I never thought I'd witness this before I entered stasis lock.

Our next act is to clear the Coreway to assist the Machine Speakers, and our new allies as they pursue the nerubians and this "Xal'atath."
}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Baelgrim]]|
<Baelgrim is oddly quiet. His usual performative confidence is subdued. Even for an earthen, he is very still.>

Adelgonn delivered on her promise to return and help us. And so, here we are, an effective council with all our peoples back together and their interests represented.

Together, we will make sure the earthen are never taken by surprise again.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Adelgonn]]|
The nerubians have made a mess of the Coreway, but Dornogal was already in a bad state. I can tell where the cracks are and the substandard repairs that have been made. The Oathsworn needed us back more--and earlier--than they let on.

<Adelgonn chuckles. It's a stony but bright sound, like pebbles tumbling into a stream.>

It all just makes me want to work again. Even in Freywold, I wanted to build for my people. And now that we're all in Dornogal once more, I guess I will again--for all of them.

<She smiles faintly.>

Let's get started then. The Coreway's main supports are barely stable. We need to start repairs--now.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Wenbrandt|
I really hope they don't expect me to go back to my job as a Stonebound.

I'd trade the steamy stills of my brewery for the heat of the Forgegrounds any day.

Though... I'm sure if I just offered everyone cinderbrew, they'd "forget" what my job used to be...
}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Speaker Brinthe]]|
Merrix called me to the Foundation Hall so that we may deliberate on our next steps as a Council.

<Speaker Brinthe nods at Adelgonn.>

I am glad to see the Stoneward return. Adelgonn was a fair and just Stoneward. I would have liked to see a similar leader for my own people.

As standing representative of the Machine Speakers, I will represent their will as best I can.

And as the way is cleared, I will go down to the Ringing Deeps myself and ascertain the status of my people and the High Speaker.
