==Objectives==
Acquire 15 Weathered Undermine Crests by defeating unique creatures, conquering raids, completing world activities, or by looting caches. Then return to [[Vaskarn]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Description==
As you can see, upgrading your lower-level equipment is easy and only requires Valorstones.

However, Valorstones can only do so much. You'll also need Undermine Crests to develop your equipment to its peak for your upcoming adventures.

These Crests are rewarded through different activities. Undermine Crests have four tiers, and more dangerous tasks reward you with higher-tier crests.

Bring me fifteen Weathered Undermine Crests, and we can help you upgrade some gear further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* [[Crimson Valorstone]]
* [[Satchel of Carved Undermine Crests]]

==Progress==
If you're having a hard time finding Weathered Undermine Crests, you can search for hidden treasures around Khaz Algar or those underground areas, including Undermine. There's no shortage of those treasures!

==Completion==
This is wonderful. I'm excited for you to grow in power! And to advance my research, of course. But yes, your power growth!
