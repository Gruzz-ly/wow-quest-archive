'''Gathering an Upgrade''' is the first upgrade quest for the [[Durable Information Storage Container]], first made available the week of 24 June 2025. Subsequent quests will be available each week thereafter.

==Objectives==
Complete any Delve.
*[[Delve]] Completed

==Description==
Hello? Hello? You're back! Perfect!

I was studying the titan console and gathering a bunch of new information from the overcharged areas including the faulty directives that were found. This might be the key to this unexpected behavior, but I'll need more time tae know for sure.

Return to the delves and we can check the results of the faulty directives, I can use the information to create an upgrade for yer belt!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Titan Memory Card]]

{{Rfg-section|11.2.0}}
* [[Overcharged Chest]]

==Progress==
Were ye successful?

==Completion==
Here, yes... With that information I can make some final tweaks. And adding this directive...

Ah! That should do it. If you insert this into yer [[Durable Information Securing Container|durable information storage container]], it should update the effectiveness of the device's, um... effects.

==Notes==
Kill overcharged enemies in any active [[Overcharged Delve]], which will be one of:
*[[Kriegval's Rest]]
*[[Skittering Breach]]
*[[The Spiral Weave]]
*[[Nightfall Sanctum]]
*[[Fungal Folly]]
*[[Sidestreet Sluice]]

This can be done on any difficulty.

==Progression==
{{Overcharged Delves}}

==Original version==

;Objective

Acquire 4 Faulty Titan Directives and complete an Overcharged Delve.

* Complete an [[Overcharged Delve]]

;Description
You're back! Perfect!

I was studying the titan console and gathering a bunch of new information from the overcharged areas, and the forces I think are carrying faulty directives. This might be the key to this unexpected behavior, but I'll need more time tae know for sure.

I do know if ye gather some of these faulty directives, I can use the information to create an upgrade for yer belt!

;Progress
Do ye have the items?
