==Description==
<Name>, we have much to discuss. The new threat of the [[Void]] is one that puts us all at risk. But this is not our first time. There are clues in our past encounters.

So is the case for the [[Black Blood]]. In the past, [[N'Zoth]] used it to induce visions.

Perhaps we can figure out how to counter its effects by returning to these moments.

Come, help me set up the portal.
