==Objectives==
Find another Fractured Spark of Fortunes.
* [[Fractured Spark of Fortunes]]

==Description==
You came right on time, <class>.

<Custodian Khubon shows you a fractured crystal.>

This is a fractured spark of fortunes. Using a reagent like this on your gear will make the difference between great and magnificent.

However, it is somewhat useless as it is nothing but a fragment. If you chance upon another in your adventures, bring it to me. Once you show me another, I will let you have this one so you can combine them into a spark of fortunes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*2x [[Fractured Spark of Fortunes]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find a fractured spark of fortunes? Is that a yes? No?

==Completion==
Excellent! Combine the two fractured sparks of fortunes to create a powerful spark of fortunes. You can always combine more using your own crafting efforts.
