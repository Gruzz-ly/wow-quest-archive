==Objectives==
[[Biergoth]] wants you to to stop the operation taking place within [[Ara-Kara, City of Echoes|Ara-Kara]].
*Ara-Kara operation disturbed

==Description==
[[Tulumun]], an agent of a new contact known as the [[Executor Nizrek|Vizier]], has approached us.

I never expected a [[nerubian]] to come to us for help, but what they brought to our attention could threaten us all. 

I will need you to descend into [[Azj-Kahet]] and infiltrate Ara-Kara, the City of Echoes. If what Tulumun told me is true, we cannot let whatever they have woven down there escape.

Put an end to their operation. Bring me back evidence of whatever you find.  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[The Severed Threads Commendation]]
*[[The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation]]
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]]
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]

==Progress==
Move quickly. Their operation cannot be allowed to come to fruition.

==Completion==
[[Black Blood|Black blood]]? I am unsure what that is, but if a nerubian calls it vile, I will take their word for it.

Here, take this for your trouble.
