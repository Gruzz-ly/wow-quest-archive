==Objectives==
Interview Concerned Dornogal Citizens to locate the [[Lamplighter Kaerter|Arathi Lamplighter]].
* [[Concerned Dornogal Citizen]]s interviewed (3)
*Speak to Peacekeeper Leif at Stoneward's Rise in Dornogal.

==Description==
We have received reports that an eccentric [[Arathi]] is accosting our citizens. We have little experience with outsiders and my superiors are wary of a diplomatic incident.

I have been tasked with finding this "[[Lamplighter]]" and resolving his concerns. You have worked with the Arathi before - can you assist me?

I have a list of [[earthen]] who have reported the Lamplighter. You can interview half the list. Between us, we can hopefully locate the Arathi before he troubles more citizens.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
* 5,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is not quite what I was expecting.

He is certainly odd, but a troublemaker? I think not.

==Notes==
Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Lieutenant|Enough! Peacekeepers do not gallivant across the countryside. Now take care of this Arathi troublemaker, Leif!}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|Yes sir.}}

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|My superiors claim peacekeepers must stay in the city. "Leave the rest to the [[Stormriders]]," they say.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|I am no Stormrider, but I could help people in need across all of Khaz Algar! If only they would listen...}}

Interview Concerned Dornogal Citizens:
{{Dialogue|
More and more newcomers enter the city every day. Their interference has disrupted a routine I have kept for a thousand years.

<The earthen sighs.>

What is it I can do for you?

{{Gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the Arathi Lamplighter?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The Lamplighter inquired about another group of Arathi that arrived recently. That group was led by a [[Shipwright Isaebela|shipwright]] searching for raw materials to use in airship construction.

I directed her to a foreman. There are many raw materials to be had on the Isle of Dorn, but I do not deal with such trivialities.

I gave the Lamplighter the same information. He left in a hurry.
}}}}

{{Dialogue|After thousands of years, I know almost every face in Dornogal. But I do not know yours. Have a seat, friend!

{{Gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the Arathi Lamplighter?}}
{{Dialogue-child|He was an odd one! He spoke so strangely and with great haste. I could barely comprehend what he was saying!

He seemed to be in a rush to find someone. He continually stressed the importance of some mission or other. I'm not sure exactly.

I offered to instruct him in proper communication skills. He grew impatient and left! It was quite disappointing.
}}}}

{{Dialogue|Ugh, more strangers. Why are you talking to me?

{{Gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the Arathi Lamplighter?}}
{{Dialogue-child|An Arathi man came by. He kept asking about someone called a "shipwright." I had no idea what he was talking about.

He eventually left, complaining about how "nobody knows anything in this Flameforsaken city." He was terribly obnoxious. 

Just. Like. You.
}}}}

Peacekeeper Leif can then be found in [[Stoneward's Rise]], talking to [[Lamplighter Kaerter]] and a [[Dornogal Foreman]]:
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Sacred Flame, now you show up! I've been wandering this city trying to get help for days!}}
