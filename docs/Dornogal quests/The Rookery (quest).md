==Objectives==
[[Biergoth]] wants you to enter [[The Rookery]] and put an end to the [[skardyn]] threat.
*Skardyn threat removed

==Description==
My contacts around [[Dornogal]] have told me to keep this a secret, but I trust you mainly because I need someone to do the job.

We have a problem within the Rookery's walls--a skardyn outbreak.

I need someone to clear the Rookery of skardyn, find the source of the outbreak, and drop the boulder on it.

Once you complete the mission, come back to me for your reward.

And remember... this stays between us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[The Severed Threads Commendation]]
*[[The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation]]
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]]
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]

==Progress==
Back so soon? Good news, I hope?

==Completion==
Well done. You are officially my favorite hero.

At least until tomorrow.

==Patch changes==
