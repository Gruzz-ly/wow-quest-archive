{{dialogue|title=Arathi Reserve|Hello, <name>. 

Endiri sent me to speak with the earthen watching over the kobold child, Skibbles. He sees promise in her convictions, but is worried Mereldar isn't a safe enough environment for her training, especially when Beledar shifts. 

We've recently contacted a group of kobolds calling themselves the "Knights of the Brown Table" that sound promising, so we are hoping to introduce them to Skibbles.

{{dialogue|title=Linny Leadfinger|<Linny grins.> 

I don't suppose you need to guess what the Weaver's decision was, huh? Honestly, I'm pretty excited to get some help. 

Translatin' Nerubian to Common ain't easy. Seems like the kid is really excited about the idea too!

{{gossip|quest=|Thank you for the information.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Professor Neltik|Oh, hey! It's you again! Say, thanks for bringin' Threadis by the school earlier and, uh--helpin' put out the fires.  
 
Ya know, I was just chattin' with Ullna to see if we could do some sorta apprenticeship or somethin'. Honestly, Threadis already has a knack for engineering, and I'd love to see what they can do! This kid is goin' places, if you ask me.

{{gossip|quest=|Thank you for the information.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Torena|I'm impressed by the young one's resourcefulness. Unfortunately, the stormrooks have already destroyed the toy, so we are hoping she can make more. I am interested in the process of making a toy for a creature. 

In return, she seems interested in learning about how we care for the rooks. The rooks seem to have taken a liking to her already, which is promising.
