==Objectives==
Complete the [[Stonevault]] dungeon on <Normal/Heroic/Myuthic{{sic}}> difficulty or higher.

==Description==
[[Brinthe]] has been a wonderful resource for helping to reconnect the [[Arathi]] and the [[earthen]]. She's told me everything that happened recently with her people in the [[Ringing Deeps]].

I can... relate to feeling frustrated with the direction your people are taking. Fortunately, [[General Steelstrike|Steelstrike]] is a more reasonable leader than this... High Speaker.

[[High Speaker Eirich]] fled to the Stonevault to gather his forces. I know it would mean a lot to Brinthe and her people if you went after him and stopped his plans!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18}}
*15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==

==Completion==
