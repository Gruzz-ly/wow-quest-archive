Perhaps you can help me with some busy work? I have so many orders that I have miscalculated several units of Mycobloom. To be honest, a bit more than several.

Will you be kind and gather the rest for me?

You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 9,250 [[XP]]
*[[Algari Herbalist's Notes]]

==Progress==
I don't mean to rush, but I need the mycoblooms as soon as possible. Please.

==Completion==
Thank you <name>! These are wonderful samples.

Here, take this as my appreciation for your time.
