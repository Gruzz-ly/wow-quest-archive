'''Lorewalking: The Blade and the High Priest''' begins the [[Xal'atath]]-focused [[Lorewalking]] campaign. Speak with [[Lorewalker Cho]] in [[Dornogal]], [[Stormwind City]], or [[Orgrimmar]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Follow Cho's guidance to learn the story of [[Xal'atath|Xal'alath]]'s{{sic}} past.
*Talk to [[Lorewalker Cho]] to learn about the [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|Legion invasion]]
*Talk to Lorewalker Cho to learn of the High Priest's journey
*Follow the High Priest's journey and acquire Xal'atath

==Description==
Xal'atath, the Harbinger of [[Void]], is a cunning and dangerous foe. She has been careful to make her presence known only to a precious few.

We first learned of her during the Legion's third invasion of Azeroth, but whispers say she has been around since long, long before that.

This is a story of power, darkness, and deceit. Join me and I will tell you the tale of Xal'atath's mysterious past.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*[[Lorewalker's Crate of Memorabilia]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]
*3x [[Weathered Undermine Crest]]

==Progress==
Xal'atath was a mysterious creature indeed. I wonder if the High Priest ever imagined how far Xal'atath would go...

==Completion==
Xal'atath was a powerful weapon and a... talkative presence.

==Notes==
On accept, the adventurer hops on the bench next to Cho:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The most cunning foes wait until you are desperate. They offer solutions you cannot afford to refuse.}}
:''Images of Burning Legion invaders appear.''
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|When the [[Burning Legion]] returned to our world, it was a desperate situation indeed.}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The heroes of [[Azeroth]] sought to arm themselves with the greatest weapons ever forged.}}
:''The paladin, druid, and priest class champions appear and stand in a beam of light, holding [[Ashbringer (artifact)|Ashbringer]], the [[Scythe of Elune (artifact)|Scythe of Elune]], and [[:Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire]] respectively. The paladin and druid fade out, and the High Priest grows larger, holding Xal'atath high.''
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Among these was Xal'atath, the Blade of the Black Empire. A High Priest searched far and wide for the Blade.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I've heard that you are the very High Priest who took on this journey. Humor me, will you? I have not quite perfected my telling of this story yet, and I would like to keep the High Priest anonymous, for now. But I would be happy to learn more of your perspective some time.}} (''priests only'')

Speak with Lorewalker Cho:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
Did you have a question?

{{Gossip|quest=|I am ready to learn about the High Priest's journey to find Xal'atath.}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Now listen closely to my tale...}}
{{Gossip|Tell me more about the Legion invasion.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
It is a lengthy tale, but suffice it to say the Burning Legion is a horde of demons from other worlds, bent upon our utter destruction. 

They are led by the fallen [[titan]] [[Sargeras]], a cosmic creature so powerful that it is difficult to imagine. 

The Legion has invaded our world several times, but this tale focuses on their [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|third invasion]].

*{{Gossip|Play Movie=|Tell me more about the heroes of Azeroth arriving at the [[Battle for Broken Shore|Battle of the Broken Shore]].}}
:''(Plays [[Azeroth's Last Hope]], the Legion cinematic.)''

Starting the Timewalking campaign begins a scenario set in the [[Whispering Forest]] of [[Tirisfal Glades]]:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The High Priest's search brought them to Tirisfal Glades, where they met with [[Alonsus Faol]].}}

Alonsus Faol starts [[Blade in Twilight]]. Pick up and progress that quest as normal. He also hands over the [[Tirisfal Camp Scroll]], which will teleport the player back to the starting location.

Read all three tomes:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The High Priest learned the Shadow Deacon, the new leader of the [[Twilight's Hammer]], found the Black Blade.}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Xal'atath changed him. He became obsessed with the [[Black Empire]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The High Priest already knew of Xal'atath through their allies in Netherlight Temple. Moira Thaurissan had an agent infiltrate the cult.}}

Throughout the quest, ask Lorewalker Cho for additional info:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Tell more more about [[Keeper's Rest]], the Old Gods, and the [[Twilight's Hammer]].}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Keeper's Rest is another name for the Tomb of Tyr.

Once in this very location, the titan-forged keeper [[Tyr]] fought against a dark entity known as [[Zakajz the Corruptor]]. Although Tyr defeated Zakajz, he gave his life to do so. 

This is the spot where he was buried--a most sacred place. It was guarded by a secretive group that called themselves the [[Tyr's Guard]].

{{Gossip|Tell me more about the Old Gods.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The Old Gods--brr! They are terrifying entities, said to have been sent from the Void to corrupt this world. Long ago, they ruled over Azeroth. Their combined domains were known as the Black Empire. 

One of these entities, [[Y'Shaarj]], was said to have been defeated by the titan [[Aman'Thul]]. In ripping Y'Shaarj from Azeroth, Aman'Thul damaged the world. Thus, the other Old Gods were sealed away rather than removed--they did not wish to damage Azeroth further.

Over time, Azeroth's champions have defeated each of the Old Gods in turn.

{{Gossip|Tell me more about Y'Shaarj.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Ah, my friend. Of all the Old Gods, this creature chills my bones the most. Once known as the beast of seven heads, Y'Shaarj was the Old God that fell to Aman'Thul so long ago.

As the titan ripped Y'Shaarj from Azeroth, it is said that the Old God breathed out one last, terrible breath. That breath manifested the seven sha that plagued [[Pandaria]]. [[Sha of Anger|Anger]], [[Sha of Hatred|Hatred]], [[Sha of Violence|Violence]], [[Sha of Fear|Fear]], [[Sha of Doubt|Doubt]], [[Sha of Despair|Despair]], and [[Sha of Pride|Pride]]. Was there any hope for my homeland when it loomed beneath such shadow?

The answer of course, was yes. The champions of Azeroth rose to the challenge, and the last vestiges of that terrible monster were at last destroyed.
}}
{{Gossip|Tell me more about [[C'Thun]].}}
{{Dialogue-child|
C'Thun was a terrible entity of madness and chaos that was imprisoned within the city of [[Ahn'Qiraj]] in [[Silithus]]. Although dormant, he surged into action when disturbed by the night elves. 

This led to the [[War of the Shifting Sands]], in which the kaldorei and dragonkind united to fight back C'Thun's [[qiraji]] and their silithid minions. The great Scarab Wall was erected to keep the Old God contained.

Of course, the [[Gates of Ahn'Qiraj]] were opened again centuries later, but champions of this world fought and successfully [[C'Thun (tactics)|defeated]] C'Thun in the end.

{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}
}}
{{Gossip|Tell me more about [[Yogg-Saron]].}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Yogg-Saron--a most devious entity indeed. Imprisoned in the depths of [[Ulduar]] by the titans, his reach was still inescapable. His blood ran through the entire continent of [[Northrend]], crystallizing into the mineral [[saronite]].

With the blood came the Old God's whispers. Many fell to Yogg-Saron's machinations, including a warden of his prison--the keeper [[Loken]]. Yogg-Saron caused Loken to turn on his own kind, and bring down the rest of the Old God's wardens from within. 

Thankfully, champions of our world [[Yogg-Saron (tactics)|defeated]] Yogg-Saron in due time.

{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}
}}
{{Gossip|Tell me more about the Twilight's Hammer.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The Twilight's Hammer is an insidious cult that worships the Old Gods and seeks to bring about the end of the world. 

It has worn many, many faces over the years, but its purpose has never wavered. And each time we seem to root the Twilight's Hammer out, it only twists its way into another form, in another place.

Perhaps it will always exist in some form, as long as there are those consumed with the idea of [[Hour of Twilight|the apocalypse]].

Keep progressing the scenario. Starting in Stage 7, non-priests gain access to [[Mass Dispel]] in the scenario interface. Use it on the Void Tendrils in the [[Darkwalk]]. Finish off Farthing and take Xal'atath from his corpse. Use Dark Drain either via the extra action button or the scenario interface to finish the scenario.

When the channel finishes, Cho reappears on his bench:
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Thus ends the first chapter of our tale. Xal'atath was a constant, whispering presence in the High Priest's mind, yet they slew countless demons together.}}

Complete Blade in Twilight with Cho, which has new completion text:
{{dialogue|At this point, the High Priest continued their battle against the Legion, with Xal'atath at their side.}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|In the final battle, Sargeras plunged [[Sword of Sargeras|his blade]], flowing with poison, into Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Xal'atath was one of many weapons whose powers were used to nullify the sword. She was weakened... but not for long.}}

More dialogue options become available. Complete the quest to move forward.
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
{{Gossip|Tell me more about Xal'atath's whispers to the High Priest. What kinds of things did she say?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Xal'atath often spoke directly into the mind of the High Priest, whispering opinions, secrets, and memories. Fortunately, the High Priest kept a careful record of her words. 

Would you like to hear more?

{{Gossip|What did Xal'atath say while in [[Netherlight Temple]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Netherlight Temple was a grand hall where priests gathered. There, the High Priest heard these whispers in their mind...}}
:{{Text|whisper|Xal'atath|Do the [[Saa'ra|naaru]] speak of the eternal conflict? That the entire history of your world is but a fraction of the time that has passed? Of those that came before the [[draenei]]? No? <short chuckle>}}
:{{Text|whisper|Xal'atath|I know the naaru consider us horrors to be resisted. We do not share this view. They are merely beloved brethren that lost the true path. They will return to their masters... in time.}}
{{Gossip|What did Xal'atath say about the Old Gods?}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|While wandering the world, the High Priest once heard Xal'atath whisper this...}}
:{{Text|whisper|Xal'atath|It is ironic that the weakest of us may be the ultimate victor. C'Thun, Yogg-Saron, Y'Shaarj, and... well. Only [[N'Zoth|one]] would remain to consume the world, that was always meant to be.}}
{{Gossip|What did Xal'atath say about [[Mindflayer Kaahrj]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Mindflayer Kaahrj was a powerful [[n'raqi]], a servant of the Old Gods. As the High Priest defeated it in the [[Assault on Violet Hold|assault]] of [[Violet Hold]], Xal'atath whispered this...}}
:{{Text|whisper|Xal'atath|For this idiotic pustule of N'Zoth to have lived so long... it does little to refute my opinion of this world's new owners.}}
{{Gossip|What did Xal'atath say while at the [[Seat of the Pantheon]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|In one of their final battles against the Legion, Azeroth's greatest heroes fought upon the Seat of the Pantheon, the titan's very cradle of creation. When there, the High Priest heard these ominous words from Xal'atath...}}
:{{Text|whisper|Xal'atath|Long have we sought entry to this realm! To think we have a mortal to thank for giving us our foothold. Your service will be remembered!}}
{{Gossip|What did Xal'atath say about the darkened [[naaru]] [[L'ura]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|In a [[Seat of the Triumvirate|stronghold]] on [[Argus]], the destroyed home planet of the draenei, the High Priest and [[Alleria Windrunner]] encountered L'ura, a naaru fallen to the Void. Here, Xal'atath whispered...}}
:{{Text|whisper|Xal'atath|Now this is true beauty! At least one of the mortals in your midst can appreciate what it offers.}}
:{{Text|say|Lorewalker Cho|After L'ura's defeat, Alleria did something unprecedented... she absorbed the naaru's Void energy into herself. Xal'atath's whispers grew eager...}}
:{{Text|whisper|Xal'atath|The caterpillar has become the butterfly. She is all but ours now.}}
{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}
}}
{{Gossip|Tell me more about Sargeras's sword and the battle that ended the Burning Legion invasion.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The final fight against the Legion took place on Argus--the ruined homeworld of the eredar. There, heroes were able to triumph with the aid of the titanic Pantheon. 

The [[Pantheon]] was able to pull Sargeras away from Azeroth before his plans could be realized. But he still managed to strike one last terrible blow before he was ripped away, plunging his blade deep within [[Silithus: The Wound|the desert of Silithus]] and damaging the very heart of our world.

*{{Gossip|Play Movie=|Tell me more about the moment of Sargeras's defeat.}} (''plays the [[Antorus, the Burning Throne]] ending cinematic'')
*{{Gossip|Play Movie=|Tell me more about how the artifact weapons were used to cleanse the poison from the sword of Sargeras in Silithus.}} (''plays the in-engine cutscene for [[The Power in Our Hands]], with a male blood elf wearing the [[Mage Tower (Broken Shore)|Mage Tower]] version of the [[Vestments of Blind Absolution]] in place of the player'')
