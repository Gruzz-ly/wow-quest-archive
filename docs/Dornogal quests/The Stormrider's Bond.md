==Objectives==
Collect 50 Storm Spirits by slaying powerful creatures of [[Khaz Algar]].
* [[Storm Spirit]] (50)

==Description==
So, you think yourself worthy of a [[Stormriders|Stormrider]]'s armor?

We Stormriders were [[titan]]-made to fight and to ride [[stormrook]]s. Even so, we must prove our competence in battle before we gain clearance to wear Stormrider armor. I see no reason why you should not undergo the same challenges.

Go. Show me you have the power of the storm within you.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Ensemble: Deep Stormrider's Attire]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Come back only when you've proven yourself worthy.

==Completion==
Hm. Clearance granted.

This armor is generally reserved for Stormriders. But for your valor, I give you special clearance. Wear it with pride.

==Progression==
