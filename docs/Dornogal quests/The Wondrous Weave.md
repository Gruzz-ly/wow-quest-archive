* Take Destien to the Weaver's Lair {{co|55.2|44.0|Azj-Kahet}}
* Speak to Widow Arak'nai
* Take Destien to Meet the Silksingers

==Description==
<Destien looks at his feet as you approach.>

H-hello! I'm Destien. Eathen{{sic}} Matron [[Ullna]] told me about you, and said you are an adventurer! You must have seen all kinds of spooky and awesome things, right?

T-there is one thing I would like to do, but I'm worried it will scare people.

<Destien looks around nervously and lowers his voice.>

I've heard there are good nerubians and that you've met them! I've always wanted to talk to one but they scare me.

Would you come with me to meet them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Progress==
My goodness! The nerubians certainly have an interesting society. The younglings seem to be very different than the Arathi children, even though they're similar in their desire to play and get into trouble. 

<Ullna smiles fondly.>

==Completion==
My, look at Destien!  

I don't think he's ever talked so much before. The nerubians must have left a strong positive impression on him indeed.  

I can't wait to hear what he's learned by spending some time with you today. Who knows? Perhaps this is a small start to a better understanding between the two races. 

Oh! The nerubian youngling, Threadis, has been eagerly awaiting you. They don't speak yet, which is common for young nerubians, but they can still communicate using other methods.

==Notes==
Cross south into [[Azj-Kahet]] and catch up with [[Widow Arak'nai]] in the [[Weaver's Lair]]. As before, it may be necessary to dismount, dismiss Destien, exit the area, and run in on foot along the western bridge to trigger the event:
:{{text|emote|Destien gasps as Widow Arak'nai comes into view.}}
:''Destien runs to hide out of view.''
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Well, if it isn't my favorite little morsel! My weave-rats informed me of your presence in Azj-Kahet. What brings you to my abode?}}

Speak with the widow:
{{dialogue|Iki'tash izal, little morsel. I hope you find the accommodations here to your taste.

{{gossip|quest=|I have someone with me who wants to meet you. He's interested in learning about the Kaheti nerubians.}}}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Oh, is that so? Do not be afraid, little morsel. It is rare to find someone outside of Azj-Kahet that is interested in our history and ways.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Tell me, what would you like to know?}}
:{{text|say|Destien|I-I...}}
:{{text|emote|Widow Arak'nai rumbles out a deep chuckle.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|You need not be so nervous. I will not bite... much.}}
:{{text|emote|Destien whimpers softly next to you.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|I jest, little morsel. Perhaps it will be easier if I lead the conversation.}}
:{{text|emote|Widow Arak'nai pauses for a moment.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Look around you, little one. Everything you see was built and crafted by the nerubian people. Ours is an old and rich culture. Older than many of the races on Azeroth.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|We pride ourselves on our artisanal abilities, such as our woven silks. Perhaps you would like to see how they are created?}}
:{{text|emote|Destien nods carefully.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Ah, there you are, Spindle. Could you take our guests to see the Silksingers?}}
:{{text|emote|Spindle gestures for you to follow.}}
:''Spindle runs off to the southeast.''

Follow Spindle southeast to [[Silksinger Tvkass]]:
:{{text|say|Silksinger Tvkass|Ah, hello! Weaver sent word with Spindle.<br><br> You want to try to weave? It's tricky!}}
:{{text|say|Destien|I-I...}}
:{{text|say|Silksinger Tvkass|Here. Try, try!}}

Speak with Tvkass:
{{dialogue|Would you like to try weaving?

{{gossip|quest=|I would like to try weaving.<br> <Play Minigame.>}}}}

This starts the standard untangle-the-lines minigame. Complete it:
:{{text|emote|Silksinger Tvkass looks over Destien's weaving with satisfaction.}}
:{{text|say|Silksinger Tvkass|This isn't bad, overcrawler hatchling! Well done.}}
:{{text|emote|Tvkass studies the weaving you've created.}}
:{{text|say|Silksinger Tvkass|Oh, uh... this is an interesting interpretation of weaving! It is very... different.}} (non-tailors) -or- {{text|say|Good, good! You have skill with this, overcrawler! I am most impressed.}} (tailors)
:{{text|emote|Silksinger Tvkass sets Destien's piece near the silk bolts, while they set your woven piece a bit further away. He gives you what seems to be a reassuring smile.}}
:''[[Orator Tx'itk]] walks up.''
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Well hello, <name>. Who is this you've brought with you?}}
:{{text|say|Destien|H-hello, I'm Destien.}}
:{{text|emote|Destien pauses for a moment, looking unsure of himself.}}
:{{text|say|Destien|W-why do you look different than the other nerubians?}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|That... is a long story, and a painful one. I underwent a powerful change, both physically and mentally. It was a decision I made to help save the future of my people.}}
:{{text|say|Destien|Wow... That sounds scary. Did it hurt?}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|It did, but I'm sure you have had to make hard choices before. Sometimes we have to do hard things to help those around us thrive.}}
:{{text|say|Destien|Like how my parents volunteered as Lamplighters in Mereldar? Caretaker Sygfraed said they made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the city and me.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|Ah, so you are no stranger to loss, then. Your sires were very brave.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|You too are brave to travel here and overcome your fears. The world is a richer place with your curiosity in it. Do not lose sight of that spark within you, little one.}}
:{{text|say|Orator Tx'itk|I must return to my duties, but I enjoyed our talk, youngling.}}
:''Tx'itk walks away.''
:{{text|say|Destien|Th-thank you! Wow, <name> did you see that! I talked to a nerubian!}}

Return to the widow:
:{{text|say|Destien|Thank you, Miss Widow. I learned a lot about your city today! It sounds like you care a lot about the other nerubians.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|I do, just as you care for your fellow Arathi. You and I both come from rich cultures, and though they disagree with one another at times, we all strive for what we think will best serve our people in the long run.}}
:{{text|emote|Destien nods carefully.}}
:{{text|say|[[Linny Leadfinger]]|'Scuse me for cutting in, Widow Arak'nai, but I see an opportunity here! Truth be told, I could use a second set of hands translating some of this stuff. Maybe the kid could come by and help sometime? Just for non-secret-y stuff.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Mmm, an interesting proposition indeed. Perhaps there is value in this arrangement. I will reflect on it.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Destien|Miss Ullna! Guess what, guess what! I got to try weaving and even got to talk to the nerubians!}}
:{{text|say|Ullna|My, that does sound like quite the story!}}
:{{text|say|Destien|I'm going to tell Kitzy and Skibbles. They're never going to believe what I got to do!}}
