==Objectives==
Interact with the Portal to Horrific Visions to rediscover the horrors of the [[Black Blood]].
*[[Portal to Horrific Visions]] used
*Speak to the [[Image of Wrathion]]
*[[Displaced Corrupted Mementos]] (20)

==Description==
Are you prepared?

The path through the [[timeways]] has been opened to where we last entered the visions.

Expect your sanity to be tested. You probably will not last long on this first attempt.

The portal is ready for you, <name>. Journey forth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*20x [[Displaced Corrupted Mementos]]

==Progress==
We must build on our past knowledge. Did you find something new?

==Completion==
It's alright, <name>. You are back. You've done well. Remember, this was just a memory of a vision.

While we will keep you safe from the past, the danger we are all in from the [[Void]] is still very real in the present.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Soridormi|You will now witness a vision of what [[N'Zoth]] intended for our world. Be fearless, champion.}}

Interact with the [[Portal to Horrific Visions]] to queue for the [[Vision of Stormwind]] or [[Vision of Orgrimmar]], whichever is active this week.

Since upgrades from the original Horrific Visions aren't carried forward, this first run has an implicit time limit of 2:47 from Sanity drain. This is enough time to defeat the main boss, but doing so isn't required for the quest objective; the end chest always contains a minimum of 20 [[Displaced Corrupted Mementos]].

;Objective completed
:{{Text|say|Soridormi|Be calm, you are safe. But these visions can still prove lethal, even when in the past.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Soridormi|The more you bring back from the visions, the more we can improve your resistance to them.}}

==Progression==
