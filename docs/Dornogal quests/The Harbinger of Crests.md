==Objectives==
Acquire 15 Weathered Harbinger Crests by defeating unique creatures, conquering [[raid]]s, completing world activities, or by looting caches. Then return to [[Vaskarn]] in [[Dornogal]].
*[[Weathered Harbinger Crest]] (15)

==Description==
Your help is always appreciated, and now you know you can easily upgrade lower-level gear right here.

Valorstones can only go so far, as I'm sure you know. You need these... Harbinger Crests to upgrade powerful adventuring gear. Much like Valorstones, these Crests are rewarded through many different activities. Harbinger Crests have four tiers, and more dangerous tasks reward you with higher-tier crests.

Bring me fifteen Weathered Harbinger Crests, and we can help you upgrade some gear further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Valorstone]]
*[[Satchel of Carved Harbinger Crests]]

==Progress==
If you're having a hard time finding Weathered Harbinger Crests, you can search for hidden treasures around Khaz Algar or those underground areas I've heard about. There's no shortage of those treasures!

==Completion==
This is wonderful. I'm excited for you to grow in power! And to advance my research, of course. But yes, your power growth!
