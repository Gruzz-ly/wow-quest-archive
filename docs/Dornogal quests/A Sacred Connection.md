==Objectives==
Collect 500 Storm Spirits by slaying powerful creatures of [[Khaz Algar]].
* [[Storm Spirit]] (500)

==Description==
I may have granted you clearance to wear our armor, but to focus the storm's power through it as the greatest [[Stormriders]] do...

The greatest Stormriders in our order do not merely posses the power of the storm. They have mastered it. And this mastery is forged over many battles.

It is time to prove yourself as one of our best.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Ensemble: Frenzied Stormrider's Attire]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|112|36}}
* 20,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Your reward shall be properly equal to your efforts.

==Completion==
Yes. This is the mastery seen in the greatest Stormriders. Let this armor be proof of that.

Wear your armor with pride. It is not an honor to be taken lightly.

==Progression==
...
