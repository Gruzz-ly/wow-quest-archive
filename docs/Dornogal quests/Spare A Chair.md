==Objectives==
Purchase a Bolt Chair in [[Rustbolt]] in [[Mechagon]], then return to [[Second Chair Pawdo|Pawdo]] in [[Dornogal]], [[Stormwind]], or [[Orgrimmar|Orgimmar]]{{sic}}.
*Re-Localized to Mechagon (Optional)
*[[Bolt Chair]] Decor Purchased
*[[Unstable Mechagon Re-Localizatron]] (provided)

==Description==
We cannot enjoy our Decor designs without a place to enjoy them from.

Behold, the chair.

What better way to enjoy Decor than on Decor itself?

I cannot imagine something more appropriate.

Find me a chair to match this coil. The gearcrafters of Mechagon know the style.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,250 [[XP]]
*[[Gnomish Tesla Coil (decor)]]

==Progress==
There is an old riddle, "when is a chair, not a chair?".

I do not know the answer.

==Completion==
Ah, the chair that you found, it is quite appropriate indeed.

For you, this coil.

I hope that you do not shock yourself! Sometimes we must sacrifice for art.

==Notes==
[[Bolt Chair]] decor is sold by [[Stolen Royal Vendorbot]] in [[Rustbolt]] on [[Mechagon Island]] for {{costitem|10|Spare Parts}}.
