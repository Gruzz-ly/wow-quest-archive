==Objectives==
Complete 5 Timewalking dungeons.

==Description==
I have heard tales of an entire [[Burning Legion|Legion]] of threats that lurks along the paths of space and time.

Defeat them and bring me back news of their demise.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

==Progress==
Some of my people may see the arrival of the outlanders as an invasion, but I am glad it was you who landed on our shores, and not the Burning Legion.

Have you snuffed out the Burning Legion? They deserve nothing less, from what I've heard.
