'''Cinder and Storm''' requires Khaz Algar Herbalism 25/100.

==Objectives==
Gather 5 Bottled Storm and 5 Burning Cinderbee Setae, and deliver them to [[Ginnad]] in [[Dornogal]].
* [[Bottled Storm]] (5)
* [[Burning Cinderbee Setae]] (5)

==Description==
The wild creatures here have stunning properties. I wonder what might happen if I combine them?

Be on the lookout for Bottled Storm and Burning Cinderbee Setae. I'll reward you generously if you can bring me some samples. Oh, and if you gather them yourself, mind that you don't get burned. Or zapped. Or both.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 9,250 [[XP]]
*[[Algari Skinner's Notes]]

==Progress==
Who knows what could happen if we combine these materials!

==Completion==
Wonderful! I can't wait to get to work.
