'''Ratts' Race''' is part of the journey to obtain [[Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle]] as part of [[Ratts' Revenge]]. To begin, players must have the {{title|Detective}} title from the [[Azeroth's Greatest Detective]] achievement, which requires completing most of the [[Guest Relations]] quests and crates. After [[WoW's Anniversary]] concludes, [[Alyx]] relocates to Dornogal, and all eleven crates can be turned into them there, which is enough to earn the achievement and title.

==Objectives==
Track down [[Ratts]].
* [[Unfinished Note|First clue]] found {{co|69.3|93.3|Azj-Kahet}}
* [[Hastily Scrawled Note (City of Threads)|Second clue]] found {{co|31.5|20.7|City of Threads}} / {{co|42.2|72.0|Azj-Kahet}}
* [[Water-Resistant Note|Third clue]] found {{co|50.7|86.6|Hallowfall}}
* [[Ratts]] confronted
* [[Carefully Penned Note (Anniversary)]] (provided)

==Description==
I saw a [[vulpera]] acting very suspicious. She seemed... on edge. I think I saw a knife at her side and a look of dark magic in her eyes.

She noticed me staring and immediately fled. Is she a wanted criminal?

She... dropped this. Here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* [[Peculiar Gem]]

==Progress==
<Ratts seems to have dropped this gem in her haste.>

==Completion==
<What could be the purpose of this gem that Ratts left behind?>

==Notes==
Speak with the [[Dalaran Survivor]] at {{co|55.0|29.0|Dornogal}} in the [[Stoneshaper's Atrium]] of [[Dornogal]]:

{{dialogue|I... I think I witnessed a crime. Or at least a criminal.

{{gossip|You can tell me about it.}}

N-no, sorry. I would rather speak to a detective.}}

Equip the Detective title and try again:

{{dialogue|{{gossip|You can tell me, I'm a detective.}}

O-okay.

{{gossip|Go on...}}}}

The survivor then starts this quest and hands over the [[Carefully Penned Note (Anniversary)]], which reads:

{{book|content=If you're reading this, you must be after him too. Or are you after me?

Either way, the game is afoot. Are you clever enough to play?

Hurry up, I think the fairy ring has gone rotten.}}

Head to [[Deepwalker Pass]] in [[Azj-Kahet]] to find some [[Rotglow Settler]]s at {{co|69.3|93.3|Azj-Kahet}} in a ring around an [[Unfinished Note]]. It reads:

{{book|content=Think what we could accomplish together. We could finally find him.

<Another line was started and then crossed out. At the bottom of the page in small lettering are a few numbers.>

-186, 96}}

Equip the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] and head northwest to (-186, 96) or {{co|31.5|20.7|City of Threads}} in [[City of Threads]] coordinates or {{co|42.2|72.0|Azj-Kahet}} in Azj-Kahet coordinates to find the [[Hastily Scrawled Note (City of Threads)]] up high overlooking the city. It reads:

{{book|content=Hallowfall<br>
Azj-Kahet<br>
Water you waiting for}}

Head up the western path to [[Hallowfall]] from Azj-Kahet and hug the eastern wall to find a hidden pond at {{co|50.7|86.6|Hallowfall}} with the [[Water-Resistant Note]] on the bottom of the pond. It has the flavor text of "A magic seal protects this note from getting wet. It faintly smells of fel magic." and reads:

{{book|content=
You're persistent, I'll give you that. Fine. If you can find me, we can talk.

Careful, it's a long way down this dark rabbit hole.

I'll be watching.}}

The rabbit hole is a reference to the [[No Harm Ever Came From Reading A Book]] achievement that tasks players with jumping down a secret hole in [[Pillar-nest Xesh]]. For this step, instead enter [[Pillar-nest Vosh]] at {{co|55.0|19.1|Azj-Kahet}} and get to the east end of the cave. At {{co|56.4|17.4|Azj-Kahet}} do some creative jumping to get to the top of the wall and fall in.

In the bottom, Ratts is channeling:
:{{text|say|Ratts|So, you finally found me.}}
:{{text|say|Ratts|All my riddles, all my tricks, and for what?}}
:{{text|say|Ratts|Truth be told, I'm a little humbled. Finally, my work is getting recognition. Even if only by a nosy brat like you.}}
:{{text|say|Ratts|Alas, this is not the end. I have more work to do. Until we meet again, <name>.}}

If attacked:
:{{text|yell|Ratts|Savage brute! If you will not listen, I will not stand here to be assaulted.}}

She teleports away and leaves the [[Peculiar Gem]] behind at {{co|56.1|18.0|Azj-Kahet}}. Pick it up to complete the quest before leaving!

On the other side of the pond is a [[Cake of Death]], that will do as warned when eaten, and an [[Eye of the Void (Azj-Kahet)|Eye of the Void]]. Interacting with the Eye will teleport the player to any [[The Last Relic of Argus]] location to escape the hole.
