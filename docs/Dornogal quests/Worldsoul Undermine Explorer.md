'''Worldsoul: Dungeons''' is a [[meta quest]] that may be offered as part of the weekly [[The Call of the Worldsoul]] quest from [[Faerin Lothar]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Objectives==
Complete various activities in [[Undermine]].
*Take the teleporter to Undermine (Optional)
*Hold a Drift (10)
*Kick a [[Discarded Can]]
*[[Emote|/dance]] with denizens of Undermine
*/tickle [[Paks Topskimmer]]
*Get kicked out of [[The Gallagio]]

==Description==
[[Undermine]] is held together by an intricate design of innovation, hard work, allegiance, and it seems like the sheer will of the [[goblin]]s. Rather than cower in their sunless cave, the goblins have built a city that thrives on motion and activity. We can learn much from that.

After not seeing new faces for years, they bring a new light to our lands. Go help them in whatever ways seem fitting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18|}}
*15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Pinnacle Cache]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
They don't stop moving just because something doesn't work. I admire that.

==Completion==
When [[Beledar]] darkened, what would they have built if they were in [[Hallowfall Arathi|our]] place?

Your efforts continue to be of great service.

==Notes==
