==Description==
Hey! You're <name>, ain't ya? My name's Kitzy! Man am I sure glad to see you. 

Look, I really wanna go back up to the surface to the stone city. The air is so clean and the sun is so bright!

I also saw a giant blue bird fly overhead, except it had lots of legs! Ullna said it was called a...ruk? Rock? Somethin' like that.

Anyway, I wanna see one! I ain't never seen anything so pretty before. Do you think I can pet one?

<Kitzy gasps, her eyes shining in excitement.>

Do you think I could RIDE one?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Progress==
<Ullna notices you approach and beams excitedly.> 

<Name>, look at all of these people! They're here asking about the children we've been watching. I can't believe it. This is so exciting! 

Let me know when Kitzy's ready to return. We have much to discuss.

==Completion==
Kitzy did what? My goodness, I would have never thought to do something like that. Children are truly astounding. The bounds of their playfulness and creativity seem limitless.  

This has been such an eye-opening journey. I think I understand children a bit better through speaking to the other caretakers and especially through all you've done. 

I can hardly believe it, <name>. All of these people are here on behalf of Skibbles, Destien, Threadis, and now Kitzy.

==Notes==
Take the teleporter to the [[Forgegrounds]] of [[Dornogal]], then head past the instance line to the [[Rookery]] to the western edge of [[Keepers Terrace]], where [[Stormrider Torena]] is with her [[stormrook]]:

:{{text|emote|Kitzy stares in awe.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Woah, look at them! They're beautiful...}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Torena|Greetings, <name>. Who is this you have brought to the Rookery?}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Heya! My name's Kitzy and I just really wanted to meet your giant birds. They're so cool!}}
:{{text|emote|Stormrider Torena nods.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Torena|These are stormrooks. They are our companions and aid us in our directive to keep Dornogal and Khaz Algar safe.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Woooow! Can I play with one?}}
:{{text|emote|Stormrider Torena looks a bit confused.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Torena|Play?}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Yeah! Back in Undermine I play with the hyenas and rats all the time. I make toys for them! They seem to like it.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Torena|I am not sure I understand.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|It's so they don't get bored. The hyenas get a bit nippy if they don't get some of their energy out. So I make toys for them to play with. It's a lot of fun!}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Torena|I do not think we have such things for our stormrooks. They are companions, not domesticated animals.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|O-oh.}}
:{{text|emote|Kitzy looks dejected for a moment, then perks up.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Could I try making something anyway? I bet I could think of somethin'!}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Torena|I... suppose I don't see any harm in--}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Okay! Come on, <name>! I got like, a bajillion ideas! Time's a-wastin'!}}
:{{text|emote|Stormrider Torena sighs.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|It seems like the rooks can use electricity, kinda like the eels in the Blackwater Marina! I'm thinkin' if I can find a conductive material, maybe I can make somethin' that plays into that!}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|I saw a giant crystal pile earlier. Let's go there!}}

Return to the teleporter to Undermine in the Forgegrounds:
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Hmmm, no. This isn't quite right. Maybe we can ask one of the earthen? I guess they eat rocks or something. Maybe they'd know.}}

Check in with [[Belga]] to the south:
{{dialogue|Well met, <name>. Do you have a query?

{{gossip|quest=|Do you have anything that can conduct electricity?}}}}
:{{text|say|Belga|Greetings. I do have something of that nature. I just received a shipment of storm glass.<br> The better crystals are often utilized in the Stormrider armor and help dissipate the stormrook's energies, from what I've been told.}}
:{{text|say|Belga|When fractured, the crystalline shards give off a small amount of electricity that makes them pleasant for us earthen to consume. Perhaps this is what you're looking for?}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Yes! This is awesome! Thanks, lady.}}
:{{text|say|Belga|I am happy I could be of--}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Okay, now we just need a lot of force! I have the perfect thing in mind.}}
:{{text|emote|Kitzy hops back and forth excitedly.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|When Ullna was giving us a city tour earlier, I saw a giant hammer! Maybe we could ask to use it?}}

In the center of the Forgegrounds is the massive hammer, with a spot for the Storm Glass in the center.
:{{text|emote|Kitzy hops back and forth excitedly.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Excuse me! Could we use this giant hammer to smash something quick?}}
:{{text|say|[[Forge Hand]]|That would not be advisable.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Pleeeeeeeeeeeease?}}
:{{text|emote|The earthen looks at you, then back to Kitzy, and shrugs.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|YES! Okay, <name>. Put the stuff up there! What, you weren't expecting me to do it were ya? You're the adult!}}

Don't get caught by the hammer, or the [[Flat Earthen]] achievement is right around the corner. Place it, let the hammer do its thing, then collect the Storm Glass Dust:
:{{text|say|Kitzy|This dust is exactly what I was looking for! Okay, <name>. For our last step, we need some leather!}}

Head east to the Leatherworking tent to find [[Krinn]]:
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Heya! Do you have any leather that can withstand a good amount of electricity? One that's super durable!}}
:{{text|say|Krinn|Greetings, young one. I do carry such an item. The storm leather I have seems to meet the parameters you've indicated.}}

Speak with Krinn:
{{dialogue|Can I help you?

{{gossip|quest=|Could we have some storm leather please? We don't need very much.}}}}
:{{text|say|Krinn|Very well. I have some scraps left over from a previous project. I hope this will suffice.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|This is perfect! Now we have everything we need!}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|It's done! Let's go back to the Stormriders! I can't wait to see what the stormrooks think of this.}}

Return to Torena and the rooks:
:{{text|say|Stormrider Torena|You have returned, <name>. I see you have brought the child with you.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Hey, Stormrider lady! I brought something for the stormrooks to play with. Can I give it to them?}}
:{{text|emote|Stormrider Torena nods tentatively.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Heeeeey there buddy! I have something for you.}}
:{{text|emote|Kitzy sets down the ball.}}
:{{text|emote|The stormrook watches Kitzy curiously, cocking its head from side to side.}}
:{{text|emote|Kitzy watches excitedly.}}
:{{text|emote|The stormrook investigates the ball.}}
:{{text|emote|The stormrook coos happily.}}
:''One of the stormrooks picks up the ball and flies off. The other follows.''
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Awww, thanks guys! I'm glad you liked it. Maybe I can make you more sometime!}}
:{{text|emote|The stormrook coos happily.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Torena|I have not seen the stormrooks this excited in some time.}}
:{{text|emote|The stormrook grabs Kitzy by the collar and throws her on it's back.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Woah!}}
:''The saddled stormrook flies Kitzy on a low loop around the area.''
:{{text|say|Kitzy|<name>, look at me! I'm flyin'! I can't believe you get to do this all the time!}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|That was the coolest thing I've ever done in the history of ever! Thanks <name>, you're the best!}}
:{{text|emote|Kitzy sighs.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|It's getting late, <name>. I'm sure Ullna is waitin' for us.}}
:{{text|say|Kitzy|Bye, stormrooks! Bye nice Stormriders!}}
:''The two rooks who flew off with the ball return a minute later.''

Head back to the [[Stoneshaper's Atrium]] to turn in. On return, [[Professor Neltik]] is speaking with [[Threadis]], [[Linny Leadfinger]] is speaking with [[Destien]], and an [[Arathi Reserve]] is speaking with [[Skibbles]]. 

:{{text|say|Kitzy|Guys, guys! You'll never guess what I just got to do!}}

After completing the quest, [[Stormrider Torena]] shows up to speak with [[Kitzy]].
