==Objectives==
Win 4 Battleground matches.
*[[Battleground]]s won (4)

==Description==
I have heard that your people wage massive battles against one another across huge fields and in crumbling ruins.

Seems like a bit of a waste of time, fighting over flags when there's proper work to be done. However, the field of battle can test the mettle of a warrior. In that, there is value.

Bring me news of your victories! I am open to being impressed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of Honor]] x5
*175 [[Conquest]]

==Progress==
We [[Machine Speakers]] are no strangers to trial by fire. It is good for learning teamwork and testing out strategies.

==Completion==
You return with news of victories? Perhaps some losses?

Every loss is a lesson towards improvement. Celebrate your victories as well.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
