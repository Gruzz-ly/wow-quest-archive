==Objectives==
Speak with Skaggit to journey to the [[Siren Isle]].
*Talk to [[Skaggit]] to depart from [[Dornogal]]
*Rendezvous with Skaggit

==Description==
The Siren Isle is a myst'ry. A potentially profitable one.

My crew thought they hit it big when they found a deserted island with some strange, singin' crystal...

Turns out, everyone in Dornogal is interested in unclaimed "strange singin' crystals." Both the [[Arathi]] and [[earthen]] scrambled quick an' were off before we could even charter a [[zeppelin]]!

Fortunately for us, [[Ricket]] and crew have gone ahead to set up.

We're the last to depart, an' I'm itchin' to go. What're we waitin' on?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}

==Completion==
We made it safe and sound!

Ricket says the whole camp's still buzzin' about the crystal.

Seems like everyone's got different ideas on how to go about figurin' out what to do with it.

They didn't like Ricket and I's way but, you might be better at diplomacy.

You wanna get involved?

==Notes==
Speak to Skaggit:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|quest=|I am ready to embark.}}
}}
:''A cutscene plays out, the zeppelin heads out, flanked by Stormrangers.''

On the Siren Isle:
:{{Text|say|Skaggit|See? We're late to the party. Meet me below. And watch your step! Heh heh heh.}}
:''Skaggit rocket-jumps down.''

Follow suit and turn in to Skaggit.

Completing the quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].
