'''Impossible Odds''' concludes the Breaking Point chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[Hypocenter]].

==Objectives==
Speak to Thrall.
*Speak to [[Thrall]]

==Description==
By the [[titan]]s... The [[Coreway]] appears completely destroyed! It will take years, perhaps centuries, to remove the rubble and repair the damage the nerubians did to its inner structure, much less traverse to the world's core.

More than that with the Stonebound gone...

I must take a moment to decide what to do.

Your friends have safely arrived. Speak to them, and stay out of my way. 

If we need you, I will let you know.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Charred Nerubian Robes]]
* [[Charred Nerubian Leggings]]
* [[Charred Nerubian Helm]]
* [[Charred Nerubian Warplate]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+2,500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 125x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
The Council must be appraised. There will be much to do...

==Completion==
My directive does not account for you, outlander.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We brought the nerubians here...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|No. The nerubians were focused on the Coreway. The attack was another part of [[Xal'atath]]'s scheme.}}

Speak with Thrall:
{{dialogue|The fight is not over.

We will take it to Xal'atath.

{{Gossip|quest=|What is the plan?}}}}

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays out:

{{#ev:youtube|Aj_nLib6AZE|Impossible Odds}}

''Thrall and Jaina are looking at the Coreway.''

{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|So much chaos and destruction...}}

{{text|bossemote|Thrall|We have to regroup. Has anyone seen Khadgar?}}

''Thrall turns around to look at Anduin and Alleria. Anduin quickly looks at Alleria, who hangs her head in defeat.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|No...}}

{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We... will grieve him in time. But Thrall is right.}}

''Jaina walks into the center of the group. Dagran, Moira, and Magni are speaking in the background.''

{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Without reinforcements, we're at Xal'atath's mercy. But no matter what she's planning, we MUST stop her.}}

''Thrall walks up to Jaina.''

{{text|bossemote|Thrall|Jaina and I will rally the Alliance and the Horde, but it will take some time for us to sail back here.}}

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Right. In the meantime, we'll stay here and keep the survivors safe.}}

''Anduin gestures at Alleria, but she rejects him. He looks at her with surprise.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|You will. Not me.}}

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria, we need your--}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|No. You don't. I can't keep anyone safe.}}

''She turns, walking away.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|But I can hut down Xal'atath... and make her pay.}}

''Anduin moves to stop Alleria, but Jaina holds him back.''

[[File:Impossible Odds - after.jpg|thumb|[[Thrall]] and [[Jaina Proudmoore]] head back to [[Orgrimmar]] and [[Stormwind]]]]
After the cutscene, Anduin runs over to [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Magni Bronzebeard]], and [[Dagran Thaurissan II]], and Jaina opens portals to Stormwind and Orgrimmar. She and Thrall take them:
:{{text|say|Thrall|We will be back. And we will be ready.}}

Completing this quest also awards the "Breaking Point" criterion of [[The Isle of Dorn (achievement)]].
