'''Children's Week in Dornogal''' begins the [[Children's Week]] storyline in [[Dornogal]]. Find [[Ullna]] at the [[Stoneshaper's Atrium]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Speak to the orphan, [[Skibbles]].

==Description==
Oh, hello! You must be <name>. I can't thank you enough for stopping by to help with these little ones. 

Since we [[earthen]] don't have children of our own, I thought it would be fun to help some of our allies out for the week, but it turns out children are quite... energetic. I also don't have a good grasp of what children find "fun" yet. 

If you could take the [[kobold]] youngling with you that would be helpful. They seem to have somewhere they want to visit. 

Take this whistle to call them to you.

==Completion==
<Skibbles looks at you in awe, then seems to realize she's staring.>

Wow, you bigger and taller than kobold friends. Hello Big-Tall, my name Skibbles!

Me hear you are very brave, Big-Tall. Skibbles want to be just like you! Talk-Rock say you here to help Skibbles.

<Skibbles lets out a comically large gasp, her eyes going wide as if she suddenly remembered something.>

You here to take Skibbles on an adventure?? Me always want to go on adventure! Dis gonna be best day ever!
