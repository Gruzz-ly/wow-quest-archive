==Objectives==
Acquire 15 Weathered Ethereal Crests by defeating [[Rare mob|unique creatures]], conquering [[raid]]s, completing world activities, or by looting caches. Then return to [[Vaskarn]] in [[Dornogal]].
*[[Weathered Ethereal Crest]] (15)

==Description==
Wonderful. [[:Valorstones]] are capable of upgrading lower-level equipment on their own. 

That being said, Valorstones can only do so much. More powerful equipment will also require Ethereal Crests to upgrade to their full potential. These crests are rewarded through many different activities. Ethereal Crests have four tiers, and more dangerous tasks reward you with higher-tier crests.

Bring me fifteen Weathered Ethereal Crests, and we can help you upgrade some gear further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Valorstone]]

==Progress==
If you're having a hard time finding Weathered Ethereal Crests, you can search for hidden treasures around [[Khaz Algar]], [[Undermine]], or [[K'aresh]]. There's no shortage of those treasures!

==Completion==
This is wonderful. I'm excited for you to grow in power! And to advance my research, of course. But yes, your power growth!

==Notes==
*Unlike [[The Harbinger of Crests]] and [[Don't Undermine the Crests]], this quest does not reward a satchel of carved crests.
