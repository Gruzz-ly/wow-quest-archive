==Objectives==
Complete 2 nerubian Delves.
*Complete 2 [[Nerubian]] Delves

==Description==
<Name>! Come in, come in!

I've been talkin' tae everyone in [[Dornogal]], and it seems like the nerubians have been kickin' up a fuss all over [[Khaz Algar]].

What's say you and I go put on our spider kickin' boots and give them somethin' tae really fuss about?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 15,650 [[XP]]
* [[Pinnacle Cache]]

==Progress==
I better not get webs on my hat again. Took me weeks tae find all the strands from last time!

==Completion==
That'll teach those nerubians tae not be so feisty, eh?

You set them up, I knock them down! Or tae other way around. I'm not fussy.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
