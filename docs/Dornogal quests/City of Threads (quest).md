==Objectives==
[[Biergoth]] wants you to eliminate all threats within the [[City of Threads (instance)|City of Threads]].
*Eliminate the Vizier's enemies

==Description==
[[Tulumun]], our [[Nerubian]] ally, contacted us once again. He spoke of a place called the [[Transformatory]] where horrific experiments take place.

I will need you to infiltrate the city and then rendezvous with the [[Executor Nizrek|Vizier]] himself for the rest of the mission. 

Eliminate the Vizier's enemies, end the threat, and return to me for your payment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[The Severed Threads Commendation]]
*[[The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation]]
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]]
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[The K'aresh Trust Commendation]]

==Progress==
Make it quick. I do not wish for you to spend more time than you have to in a nerubian city.

==Completion==
I do not know if I trust these nerubians--not yet.

Their capability to devise sinister ploys, and these facilities to support their darkest plans... It leaves a rock at my core.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
