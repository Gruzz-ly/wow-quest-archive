==Description==
<Threadis looks up at you nervously. 

They hold up what appears to be a drawing of a goblin rocket, similar to the rocket drill going to Undermine. 

Perhaps they would like to ride the rocket drill?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Progress==
My, this place is certainly different! It's almost the complete opposite of the Weaver's Lair. Not to mention all the colors... and smells. 

It has been fun to watch the goblin children at play, though. They have more in common with the Arathi, kobold, and nerubian children than I would have imagined!  

They're certainly a handful...

==Completion==
Would you look at Threadis! I know they are very proud of that little bot they built, so I'm glad they were able to bring it to a place where their talents are appreciated. 

I'll stay here and see if I can have a chat with Professor Neltik. Why don't you take Kitzy? We'll meet you in Dornogal when you're finished!

==Notes==
Head to southeastern [[Ringing Deeps]] and bring [[Threadis]] to [[Gutterside Rocket Station]]. Or... cheat by returning to [[Dornogal]], taking the teleporter to [[Undermine]], then returning via the rocket sled.

Walk up to [[Stelliya]]:
:{{text|emote|Threadis makes an excited noise as you near the rocket drill.}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis stares in awe at the massive feat of goblin engineering.}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis chitters in unbridled delight.}}
:{{text|say|Stelliya|Hey hon, you gonna just stare at it or are you gonna show me your pass to Undermine?}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis looks at the goblin, then back at the drill longingly.}}

Check in with Stelliya:
{{dialogue|Got the proper papers for Undermine?

{{gossip|quest=|I'm here to take this orphan to Undermine, but I haven't been before.}} (''no quest progress'')
{{dialogue-child|
<Stelliya looks at Threadis and sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose.> 

Fine, fine! I can getcha in on a one week pass, but it will expire after this week. 

You're gonna have to find your own way back to Undermine after, capeesh?

{{gossip|quest=|<Board the drill to Undermine.>}}}}

{{gossip|quest=|I'm taking this orphan to Undermine. Here's my pass.<br> <Board the drill to Undermine.>}} (''with quest progress'')
}}

Pick whichever option is available, then try to walk out of [[Slam Central Station]]:
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Hey, woah. I'm gonna need to see some papers, pal.}}

Check in with [[Daznak Scratchbolt]]:
{{dialogue|class=plainlist|
Look, if you just arrived I've gotta fill out a form. 

I don't like it either but I'd prefer you don't make my job worse than it already is.

Seems like they're tryin' to make sure no more Black Blood comes into the city. 

All the letters gotta be dotted an' crossed or whatever.

*{{gossip|quest=|But I've been here before?}}
*{{Gossip|quest=|I have a one week pass.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Well, with everything that's happened lately, they have us filin' even more paperwork on who comes and goes.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|I'll fill out the paperwork, so just wait here. It'll only take a minute.}}
:{{text|emote|Daznak begins to write on his clipboard.}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis looks around, awe glittering in their eyes.}}
:{{text|emote|Daznak chuckles, still writing on his clipboard.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|This your first time in Undermine, kid?}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis nods carefully.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Well, welcome to the big city.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|That little bot you got there--you make it yourself?}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis chitters uncertainly, then nods again.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Hey, I ain't gonna take it from you. I was just thinkin' you should visit my cousin! He's a mechanic that teaches over at the school on the corner.}}
:{{text|emote|Daznak thrusts a finger over his shoulder as he continues to write. Threadis perks up and chitters excitedly.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|I bet he ain't never seen a nerubian engineer before. I imagine he'd love to nerd out about all that kind of--}}
:{{text|emote|Daznak pauses and looks down at Threadis.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Stuff.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Anyway, one signature and you're both good to go.}}

Speak with Daznak again:
{{dialogue|class=plainlist|Anyway, one signature and you're both good to go.

* {{gossip|quest=|<Write your real name.>}}
* {{gossip|quest=|<Name>, Champion of the Alliance}}
* {{gossip|quest=|<Use a fake name.>}}
* {{gossip|quest=|<Scribble some gibberish.>}}
* {{gossip|quest=|<Write today's date.>}}
}}
*{{Text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Thanks, <name>.}} (''first & second option'')
*{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Really? Really. Ya just had to make my life harder, didn't ya?}} (''gibberish'')
:{{text|emote|Daznak Scratchbolt lets out a long, drawn out sigh.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Oh, and kid--get yourself a treat. On me.}}
:{{text|emote|Daznak hands Threadis a coupon for a food stall.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|If you ain't ever been to Undermine before you oughtta try out some of the food. There're a few good vendors at the end of the tunnel here.}}
:{{text|say|Daznak Scratchbolt|Anyhow, have yerself a nice visit.}}

Head east out of Slam Central, but check in with [[Broos]] at the edge of the station:
:{{text|emote|Threadis approaches Broos's food stalls with interest.}}
:{{text|say|Broos|Hey there, lil' fella. You hungry? We got plenty of good eats.}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis holds up a coupon for the food stall.}}
:{{text|say|Broos|Oh yeah, I can do that. What sounds good, kid?}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis peers at the cart before tapping a long finger against the picture of the "Airship Dog on a Bun."}}
:{{text|say|Broos|Hey, good choice. Here ya go, kid.}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis wraps up the hotdog in silken threads, then tucks it away to save it for later. Threadis looks at you expectantly, then glances in the direction of the school.}}

Head southeast to the [[Cwik Career College]] and drop in on a presentation taking place just outside:
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Alright, next student.}}
:''The [[Nervous Student|student]]'s device starts whirring alarmingly.''
:{{text|emote|Threadis chitters in alarm.}}
:''Threadis webs the device in a silken cocoon.''
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Wowza! What happened?}}
:{{text|emote|Professor Neltik looks at the now covered device, then back to Threadis.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Woah, quick thinkin' kid! That coulda gotten outta hand quick.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Wait here a sec--I wanna chat with you. I just gotta dismiss my class first.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Alright everyone, back to work! I want a one-page paper from each'a you explainin' what safety protocols we shoulda had for this type of situation. Class dismissed!}}
:{{text|emote|The surrounding students collectively groan in dismay.}}
:''[[Exhausted Engineer|They]] disperse.''
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Ya know, I've never seen nerubian silk used to put out a fire before. That was smart! Also, this lil' bot was amazing! Is it alright if I take a look at it?}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis nods carefully.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Wow! Did you make this yourself?}}
:{{text|emote|Professor Neltik whistles.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|This is some real nice engineering for someone your age! What's your name, kid?}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis reaches a small hand and taps some scratches on the bottom of the bot.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Thre--Threadis? Wow, someone even taught you a bit of Common, huh? That's unusual as far as I understand.}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis chitters shyly.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Well, Threadis, I dunno what you're here for in Undermine--but I'd sure love to have you in my class if you're looking to learn more about engineering.}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis stands perfectly still, then lets out the most delighted chitter you've heard yet.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|Heeey, I'll take that as interest! I dunno if you have a guardian or what, but give them my card and hopefully we can work somethin' out.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Neltik|You have real talent kid! No matter what, don't stop tinkerin' okay?}}
:''Neltik walks inside.''
:{{text|emote|Threadis nods, their eyes shiny with promise.}}

Catch up with [[Ullna]] and the gang at [[Lil' Guys Orphanage]] to the east. On complete:
:{{text|emote|Threadis chitters in delight when they see Ullna.}}
:{{text|say|Ullna|Oh my! What is this you have, Threadis? Did you meet someone you'd like me to talk to?}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis nods.}}
:{{text|say|Destien|Threadis! How was Undermine? Did you get to see the big rocket drill?}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Wick-Legs! You have fun? Skibbles want to know! Tell, tell!}}
:{{text|emote|Threadis nods.}}
