Big-Tall! Nice [[Earthen|Talk-Rock]] tell Skibbles that she get to do whatever she want today! 

Well, me have big dream. One so big, me get in trouble for it. A lot. 

<Skibbles takes a deep breath.> 

Me want to be brave candle knight, like [[Arathi|shiny humans]] with [[Arathi airship|floaty boats]]!

A-and me hear there is [[Beledar|crystal]] that's brighter than any candle! 

<Skibble pauses, seemingly anticipating rejection.> 

Would...would you take Skibbles to see candle knights with [[Imperial lynx|big kitties]]?

* {{cost|2|34}}

==Progress==
Oh, hello <name>. I've had a wonderful time chatting with the orphanage patron here. After watching the children play, I am starting to see why my previous activities weren't as exciting for the younglings I am watching. 

They do not seem as interested in city tours but instead have an incredible capacity to pretend! Fascinating. 

Oh, I almost forgot--did you get a chance to take Skibbles to see the Lamplighters?

==Completion==
My goodness! I have never seen Skibbles this excited! It sounds like she made quite the impression with the Lamplighters. 

Speaking of children, I was watching the other Arathi children play and noticed that [[Destien]] seems more interested in his book than joining in.  

Perhaps you could talk to him? Surely there is something he would rather do than stay here.

==Notes==
Head to [[Hallowfall]] and take [[Skibbles]] to the western gate (not the road) of [[Mereldar]]. It may be necessary to dismiss and resummon the kobold using the [[Khaz Algar Orphan Whistle]] to trigger the event:
:{{text|emote|Skibbles lets out a comically large gasp.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Big-Tall! Do you see it?!}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Woah...this is bigger than any candle Skibbles ever saw! It's so pretty...}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|How many candles tall you think crystal is?}}

Speak with her:
{{dialogue|class=plainlist|How many candles tall you think crystal is? Guess, guess!

<Skibbles grins, eagerly awaiting your answer.>

*{{gossip|quest=|Thousands of candles tall.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|About three million Skibbles tall.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|I have no idea. More than ten candles?}}

:{{text|emote|Skibbles scrunches up her nose.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|That not sound like enough. Skibbles think it over a hundred! That a big number. Other kobolds say so!}}
:{{text|emote|Skibbles looks very sure of herself.}}
:{{text|emote|Skibbles turns toward the Arathi Reserve training grounds, her ears suddenly perking up.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|You hear that? Skibbles hears battle!}}

Head north to the training grounds and catch up with [[Endiri Dawnsurge]]:
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Woooooow, Big-Tall! Look at all of the Candlelighters!}}
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|Greetings, <name>. Who is this that you have brought with you?}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Woooooah... you real Candlelighter! Like one from stories! You a knight?}}
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|Indeed, though I am but one of the many protectors of Mereldar and the Sacred Flame. What brings you here, friends?}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Me is Skibbles! Me want to be Candlelighter, just like you! Skibbles wants to protect friends and grow up to be brave knight.}}
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|Is that so? Well, being a "knight" is not easy. It requires a lot of dedication and sacrifices. You have to be very brave.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Skibbles not afraid! Skibbles want to help. Want to protect candle and friends from dark! Skibbles been practicing.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Here, me show you what Skibbles can do!}}
:{{text|emote|Endiri nods towards the training dummy.}}
:''Skibbles walks over the the dummy and starts whacking it with her sword.''
:{{text|emote|Skibbles bends over to catch her breath looking a bit tired.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|S-see? Skibbles hit target with everything me have!}}
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|I should say I'm impressed, Skibbles. Though fighting isn't all about hitting your foe as hard as possible.}}
:''Endiri walks over and demonstrates a better form.''
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|How you attack is just as important as strength, and could easily save your life someday.}}
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|You should put more weight on your front foot when you attack so your body is weight is balanced.}}
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|Try to make your swing one solid move using your body, not just your arms.}}
:{{text|emote|Skibbles shuffles her feet trying to emulate Endiri Dawnsurge.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|O-ok! Balance feets and...swing body. Skibbles will practice. Me promise on candle!}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Thank you for helping Skibbles, Mr. Nice Candlelighter knight!}}
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|Thank you for bringing her here, <name>. She does show more promise than I was expecting. Perhaps I should speak to her guardian about an apprenticeship.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|You hear that, Big-Tall? Maybe Skibbles can train with knights!}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Okay, Big-Tall! There only one more thing Skibbles want to do.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Skibbles... would like candle. One to remember this bright place by!}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Every good Candlelighter need candle! You help find Skibbles candle?}}

Walk west to find a [[Large Holy Candle]] at Light and Flame:
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Oh look, Big-Tall! Candles!}}

Interact with the candle:
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Mmmmm this candle too big for Skibbles. Skibbles can't carry it!}}

Try the [[Melted Holy Candle]] on the other counter:
:{{text|say|Skibbles|This candle tiny! Almost no wax left. Maybe Big-Tall find bigger candle?}}

On the back counter is a [[Pristine Holy Candle]]:
:{{text|say|Skibbles|That candle! It perfect for Skibbles!}}
:{{text|emote|Skibbles holds out her hands to accept the candle gingerly, as if it were made of a precious material.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|This candle... so beautiful! Wax so white and shiny...}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Skibbles promise to treasure it always! With this, Skibbles is now Candlelighter!}}
:{{text|emote|Skibbles's ears perk up.}}
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Skibbles thinks she hears nice Talk-Rock. Big-Tall take Skibbles back to nice Talk-Rock lady?}}

Head down to the orphanage at town center to catch up with the gang. On complete:
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Hi, nice Talk-Rock lady. Guess what Skibbles do! Guess! Guess!}}
:{{text|say|Ullna|Hello, Skibbles. That's a very nice candle you have there!}}
:{{text|emote|Skibbles giggles gleefully.}}
:''Skibbles walks over to [[Kitzy]] and [[Threadis]].''
:{{text|say|Skibbles|Skibbles show friends, Wick-Legs and Smart-Ears. Wick-Legs! Smart-Ears! Look what Skibbles have!}}
:{{text|emote|Ullna chuckles with a gentle smile.}}
