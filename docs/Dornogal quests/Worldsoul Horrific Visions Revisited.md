Defeat 5 bosses inside [[Horrific Visions Revisited]].

==Description==
This [[Black Blood]] that has corrupted the [[nerubian]]s is nasty stough.{{sic}}

I hear that it is not the first time that the [[Old God]]s have used this blood.

A new visitor to [[Dornogal|Dorgogal]],{{sic}} [[Soridormi]] of the [[Bronze dragonflight|Bronze Dragons]], has found a way for you to revisit this past event. 

Seek her out to relive these Horrific Visions and learn what you can.

*[[Pinnacle Cache]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
What was it like? I hear you went back and entered someone's nightmare?

==Completion==
I am glad you made it back safe. I know if we keep looking we will find a key to ending the void's corruption.
