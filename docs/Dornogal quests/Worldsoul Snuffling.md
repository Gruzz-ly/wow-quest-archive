==Objectives==
Find Disturbed Earth piles to Snuffle and discover Worldsoul Motes by skyriding all around [[Khaz Algar]].
* [[Disturbed Earth]] dug (5)
* [[Worldsoul Mote]]s discovered during [[skyriding]] (45)

==Description==
I've wanted to be able to explore beyond [[Hallowfall]]'s caves for so long now. Of course, I hardly have time, but when I do... there's such surprises everywhere!

Treasures, friends in need, foes great and small... All so wonderful.

I'll just have to live vicariously through you. Deeds need doing! Go out and seek the surprises in every nook and cranny. I'm certain you will find things that need doing!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18}}
*15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
Oh, what have you found?! Tell me everything.

==Completion==
Our world is a wonderful place. Thank you for protecting it.
