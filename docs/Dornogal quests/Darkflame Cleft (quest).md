==Objectives==
[[Biergoth]] wants you to venture into [[Darkflame Cleft]] and face [[The Darkness]].
*Defeat The Darkness

==Description==
A new ally of ours, a [[kobold]] from the [[Ringing Deeps]] named [[Skitter]], has contacted me.

I need you to go to Darkflame Cleft and remove a certain threat--something that Skitter called The Darkness.

How can a kobold be afraid of the darkness when they spend most of their time underground? It makes no sense to me. But kobolds will be kobolds, and I will not busy myself with understanding.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*1,500 [[reputation]] with either the [[General (faction)|General]], the [[Vizier (faction)|Vizier]], or the [[Weaver (faction)|Weaver]] and also adds it to the [[Severed Threads]] (via the [[Severed Threads Commendation]])
*1,500 reputation with the [[Assembly of the Deeps]] (via the [[The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation]])
*1,500 reputation with the [[Hallowfall Arathi]] (via the [[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]])
*1,500 reputation with the [[Council of Dornogal]] (via the [[Council of Dornogal Commendation]])
*1,500 reputation with the [[Cartels of Undermine]] (via the [[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]])
*1,500 reputation with the [[K'aresh Trust]] (via the [[The K'aresh Trust Commendation]])

==Progress==
Let me know if you figure out what this darkness is all about.

==Completion==
So The Darkness is a kobold entity? And here I thought Skitter was over-exaggerating.

Here is your reward.
