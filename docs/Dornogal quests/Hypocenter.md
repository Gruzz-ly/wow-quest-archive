'''Hypocenter''' begins the Earthen Fissures chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]].

==Objectives==
Clear debris and rescue [[earthen]] on the way to the [[Archive]].
*Earthen rescued and hazards cleared (8)
*Meet [[Baelgrim]] in the Archives by the [[Coreway]].

==Description==
I have failed my people. The [[Coreway]] is impassible. [[Dornogal]]'s lifeline to the [[Ringing Deeps]] has been severed as has the path beyond.

The [[nerubian]]s will get their comeuppance. It is my edict as it is my will.

I will ascertain if [[Merrix|the Councilward]] yet functions and bring him to the Archive. [[Speaker Brinthe]] should be there, [[titan]]s willing.

But [[Oathsworn]] citizens are still in peril. If you wish to ally with us, clear the debris here and help our survivors.

I will meet you at the Archive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|4|50}}
*5,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Archive looks intact, fortunately. We must keep it that way at all costs.

==Completion==
You made it.

Good.

Is that a memory gem? You should not have disturbed our dead.

But... you have brought it to the right place.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Baelgrim|I will check on my people, the Oathsworn, while you clear the rubble. Edicts guide you.}}
:{{text|yell|Baelgrim|Begone, filth of the depths. You hold no claim here!}}
:''Baelgrim and [[Stormrider Meirand]] fly off.''
:{{Text|say|[[Magni Bronzebeard]]|Edicts, Oathsworn... it all sounds daft to me.}}
:''Baelgrim blasts lightning bolts as he flies off to the [[Archive]], obliterating attacking nerubians.''

Interact with piles of [[Coreway Rubble]] and clear out [[Tangleweb Remnants]] to rescue [[Coreway Worker]]s and recover [[Dead Earthen]]:
:{{Text|say|Coreway Worker|Who... are you? Did the titans send you?}}
:{{Text|say|Coreway Worker|Nerubians? It has been centuries since their last attack...}}
:{{Text|say|Coreway Worker|The Coreway was our link to the rest of Khaz Algar...}}

[[Dead Earthen]] may have an [[Earthen Memory Gem]] or gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Coreway Worker|<The earthen's body is split from falling debris.

A shattered gem lies within its core, too broken and embedded to be meaningfully retrieved.>
}}

Enter the Archive:
:{{Text|say|[[Merrix]]|Moss grow over us. Survivors from the beach?}}
:{{Text|say|Speaker Brinthe|If they are truly allies, perhaps all is not lost.}}

Inside, characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Dagran Thaurissan II|What kind o' luck do I have? My first venture out o' Ironforge an' I find myself in a land untouched by time.

An' the first buildin' I walk into is basically a library!

Did I die in the crash? Is this heaven? Nerubians aside, it feels like it.

I'm keen to learn all I can about the earthen--especially if it'll help my ma.}}

{{dialogue|title=Merrix|I am Councilward Metrix.

And you are an outlander, one that has come from a land far, far away...

But you have said nothing of the titans. I had thought that perhaps they and their Keepers had settled somewhere beyond where earthen could travel, but I see from the look you are giving me right now that it is not so.

Hm. There are other logical explanations for their silence, I suppose.

<A flash of sadness crosses Merrix's face, but he clasps his hands together and smiles at you slightly.>}}

{{dialogue|title=Speaker Brinthe|
I am Speaker Brinthe, a Machine Speaker here on behalf of the High Speaker.

I serve on the Council in his stead, presiding over its restoration of the Archive, the titan machine installed in Dornogal.

The destruction of the Coreway is... regrettable. I have not returned to the Ringing Deeps in centuries. My processing lingers on the fates of those I know there and how they fare.

{{gossip|What is a Machine Speaker?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
It is hard to explain to an outlander, but I will endeavor to be brief.

All earthen are hard coded by a Keeper and by extension the titans with a primary function that they must perform.

In the Isle of Dorn, every Oathsworn keeps one of two: "Build and maintain the structures and facilities of Dornogal and the Coreway," or "Protect the city of Dornogal and the Coreway."

In the Ringing Deeps, the land below the Isle of Dorn, there is a third Edict: "Maintain the titans' machines above and along the Coreway." That is my Edict and the Edict of my people.

All earthen look to us to save us from our eventual stasis and shutdown by repairing the Stonevault and the Awakening Machine. We have so far been unsuccessful.
}}}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Speaker Brinthe|A memory gem... There will be more to recover, I fear.}}

After completing the quest, Baelgrim has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
The Archives still stand.

Councilward Merrix and Speaker Brinthe are still functioning.

Thank the Edicts.}}
