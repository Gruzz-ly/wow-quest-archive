==Objectives==
Deliver the advertisement to [[Hotharn]] at the [[Contender's Gate]] in [[Dornogal]].
*[[Artisan's Consortium Pamphlet]]

==Description==
Come one, come all, straight to Dornogal!

In addition to the usual selection of powerful equipment offered at the Contender's Gate, aspiring combatants and proven gladiators can purchase heraldry tokens which can be used to craft equipment certified for use in arenas and battlegrounds!

Present this brochure to Hotharn to receive a few of these, on us!

- [[Aisha]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9 [[Astral Gladiator's Heraldry]] ([[The War Within Season 3|Season 3]])
* 9 [[Prized Gladiator's Heraldry]] ([[The War Within Season 2|Season 2]])

==Completion==
Ah, I was beginning to wonder when the eager fighters were going to show up. 

Here you go, as promised. Use these when submitting Crafting Orders or when crafting your own equipment. The result will be just as powerful as what [[Lalandi]] sells over there, but these are great when you're looking for something customized to your liking. If you need more, you know where to find me.

Questions? Take them to the [[Forgegrounds]].
