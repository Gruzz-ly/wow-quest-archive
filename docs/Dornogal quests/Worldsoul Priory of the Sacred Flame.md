==Objectives==
Complete the [[Priory of the Sacred Flame]] dungeon at <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> difficulty or higher.

==Description==
My people have always had a close bond to the [[Light]]. A faith I once thought was unshakeable. But there are some--

<[[Faerin]] pauses, momentarily lost for words.>

There are some who believe that faith should be... enforced. This has always been something the [[Arathi]] has struggled with, even back in [[Arathi Empire|the Empire]].

But things have gone to far. These... zealots have taken over the Priory of the Sacred Flame. They're hurting people!

This isn't what the Light is about, <name>. Stop them.
