'''Worldsoul: World Quests''' is one of various quests that may be available through [[The Call of the Worldsoul]], a weekly [[meta quest]] offered by [[Faerin Lothar]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Objectives==
Complete [[World quest|World Quests]] in [[Khaz Algar]].
*World Quests completed in Khaz Algar (6)

==Description==
There so much to be done and so little time to do it!

[[Brinthe]] and I have been gathering word of the people that need the most aid throughout all of Khaz Algar. There's too many to count!

Go out and help them. With your aid, will can bring all our people closer together... so we may all grow stronger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18|}}
* 15,650 [[XP]]
* (Max level) [[Pinnacle Cache]]
* (Level 70-79) [[Algari Adventurer's Cache]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
Strange, these notes that come from [[Azj-Kahet|Azj-kahet]]{{sic}}. I am.. hesitant to send any aid to the [[nerubian]]s. Not after what they've done to my people.

But between your reports and those from our scouts... perhaps we can use their... disagreements to our advantage. And perhaps some are truly in need of aid. Of kindness.

I do not want my eyes to be clouded by hate. And yet...

<Faerin sighs.>

Who knows. All I do know I won't regret a kindness.

==Completion==
Ah! I've had so many scouts and letters already! You've done so well. I hope you know you are appreciated.
