'''Group Effort''' begins The First Blow chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]].

==Objectives==
Distribute [[Merrix]]'s orders to 10 [[Unbound Worker]]s around [[Coreway|the Coreway]].
* Orders distributed (10)
* [[Work Orders (Isle of Dorn)]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Unbound]] have arrived with the equipment and resources needed to begin repairing the Coreway.

This is a momentous occasion. One for [[Archive|the Archive]]! I would not say this to [[Adelgonn]], but I see the [[titan]]s' hands in it...

And now it is time for me to exercise my directive! I have devised a plan for how to organize our workers most efficiently--and have also allocated supplies to welcome them.

Take these orders to Adelgonn's workers so that they can begin in earnest. We will meet you there shortly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must begin work at once.

==Completion==
Even with this many workers, the Coreway's repairs will take time.

We need to decide what to do in the meantime.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Merrix|Adelgonn and I will oversee the repairs. This will be no small task.}}

Use the provided [[Work Orders (Isle of Dorn)]] and ground-target [[Unbound Worker]]s around the [[Coreway]] to give them instructions:
*{{text|say|Unbound Worker|Are these numbers right? I guess if the circuitry is that delicate...}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Worker|Is it too late to go get my good hammer?}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Worker|Directive received. We'll see the task to completion.}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Worker|I can't believe the Councilward still had the Coreway's schematics. Astonishing!}}
*{{Text|say|Unbound Worker|I've been itching to build. Let's get those gears moving again!}}
<!-- above have been confirmed after release -->
*{{text|say|Unbound Worker|Let's get to it. Those gears aren't fixing themselves!}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Worker|Oh, thank goodness we had documentation.}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Worker|We'll get it done.}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|These repairs will be wasted if we're attacked again. We need to bolster our defenses.}}

==Progression==
{{The First Blow}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
