;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Magni Bronzebeard|Well, best be setting sail to [[Ironforge]]. No sense in dawdling.}}
:{{Text|Say|Moira Thaurissan|Are you sure about staying, Dagran? You could return home with us and study there...}}
:{{Text|Say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I'm sure, ma. There's still so much knowledge here yet to be discovered!}}
:{{Text|Say|Moira Thaurissan|<Laughs> And knowing you, you'll find it all.}}
:{{Text|Say|Moira Thaurissan|Keep out of trouble, and make sure [[Brinthe]] always knows where ye are.}}
:{{Text|Say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Yes, mum.}}
:''Orweyna appears and bows.''
:{{Text|Say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ach, and who's this?}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I am called Orweyna. I've been told you too have heard the voice of the goddess.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magni Bronzebeard|Goddess? You mean Azeroth? Aye- I was her speaker for many years, but she's let me go from that service.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Her voice has led me far from my home, seeking a truth I know she wishes to reveal, but my kin, they... do not understand.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magni Bronzebeard|Aye. It can be lonely, followin' a path that others can't see. But don't make the same mistake I did, puttin' it all on yourself.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magni Bronzebeard|Look for those who will walk the path with you. If I've learned anythin', it's that we'll always need each other to not lose ourselves on the journey.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|You are kind, Magni. I will consider your words carefully.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magni Bronzebeard|Best of luck to you, Orweyna. One day when you've found what you're looking for, I hope you too find your way home.}}
:''Orweyna bows and leaves.''
