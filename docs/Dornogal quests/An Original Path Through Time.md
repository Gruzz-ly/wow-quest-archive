==Objectives==
Complete 5 Timewalking dungeons.
* [[Timewalking]] [[dungeon]]s completed (5)

==Description==
Ever since [[Dalaran|your city]] fell out of the sky, I have learned more of [[Azeroth|this world]]'s history and the challenges that heroes like yourself have faced.

Learning from the past is how we ensure our future. Walk through time to the humble beginnings, defeat those threats once more, and bring those lessons forward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Cache of K'areshi Treasures]]

==Progress==
Much has happened in the greater world while we worked in this place. I hear you had a hand in quite a bit of those tales.

==Completion==
What lessons did you bring from your journeys through time?
