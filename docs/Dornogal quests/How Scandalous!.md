'''How Scandalous!''' begins the optional "Behind Closed Doors"/"Merrix and Steelvein" chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]]. This chapter is required for [[Allied Races: Earthen]] and [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].

==Objectives==
Investigate the disturbance near the [[Forgegrounds]] in [[Dornogal]].
*Disturbance investigated near the Foregrounds

==Description==
Did you see anything?

I was just at the Forgegrounds picking up a jewelry commission and all of a sudden everyone was shouting like the [[Coreway]] was under attack--again.

But it was not that...

Some peacekeepers were heading towards the depot--where crafting shipments are sent up from the Deeps. I bet it's something to do with the machine speakers!

The peacekeepers ushered everyone away before I could see what had happened. But maybe you can sneak a glimpse?

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{cost|2|80|90}}

We may actually need your assistance.

==Beta version==
;Description
It's dreadful!

I was just at the Forgegrounds picking up a jewelry commission and all of a sudden everyone started shouting! I haven't heard anything half so bad since the [[Coreway]] incident!

Some peacekeepers were heading towards the depot where crafting shipments are sent up from the [[Ringing Deeps|Deeps]]. I bet it's something to do with the [[Machine Speakers|machine speakers]]! Strange fellows.

I tried to see what was going on but they were ushering people out of the area. Maybe you can slip past and catch a glimpse?
