==Objectives==
Speak to [[Custodian Khubon]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Description==
A vision of starlight permeates your mind.

Custodian Khubon might have more information regarding the fragments of starlight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
This is a fractured spark of starlight.

Every week, one of these fragments will appear while on your adventures. In its current state it's rather useless, but combining it with another fragment will grant it power. Reagents like these are malleable, robust, and the prize for many crafters.

Combining two of these fractured fragments will create a unique crafting material that can help an item achieve expertise beyond that of mortal ability.
