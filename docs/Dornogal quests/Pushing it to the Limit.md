==Objectives==
Defeat any [[Delve]].
*Delve Completed

==Description==
I realized after ye left last time that I might have worried ye a wee bit with the whole exploding belt upgrade possibility. I'm sorry. I get a bit excited sometimes.

I do think I can get even more power out o' the belt. At least a bit more. Safely of course! In yer data, I've seen that you've encountered many enemies as ye entered many delves. That's the key, return one more time for this last upgrade for yer belt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Titan Memory Card]]

==Progress==
I cannae wait to see if I was correct!

==Completion==
The data from that last excursion provided what I needed for another upgrade. But this is the last upgrade we can do for the belt, unless we want a major meltdown. Of course a meltdown would tell us a lot about the design...

Ma always said, "Dagran! If yer gonna destroy ancient, irreplaceable artifacts, destroy yer own." So this is the last upgrade.

Here is the last upgrade card. Thank ye for yer help. I hope we get a chance to experiment more in the future!
