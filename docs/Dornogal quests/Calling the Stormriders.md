==Objectives==
Meet [[Baelgrim]] outside the [[Stormperch]], then speak with him to follow him into The Rookery.

This challenge may be completed solo or with up to 3 party members.
*Meet Baelgrim outside the Stormperch {{co|32.2|35.7|Dornogal}}
*Speak to Baelgrim to enter the Rookery
*Corruption purged from the Stormperch

==Description==
I know the [[Unbound]] can repair and unblock the [[Coreway]] expediently--but I also know the [[nerubian]]s. If they see an opportunity for an ambush, they will take it.

With our backs turned and our focus on the Coreway, we are prime targets.

I need to rally my Stormriders and form a perimeter around Dornogal in case of an attack from within or from without.

Meet me outside of the Stormperch. I will call upon my troops there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Baelgrim is right. We need to defend the Unbound while they work on the Coreway.

==Completion==
The entire Rookery?

I see.

At least the source is destroyed. I lament the loss of so many Stormriders but...

If the corruption had spread to [[Dornogal]]...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Meet me outside the Stormperch. We will rally the [[Stormriders]] and protect the Unbound.}}
:''Baelgrim walks off.''

Head north to [[Keepers Terrace]] and the instance line of the [[Rookery]], where Baelgrim awaits:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Over here, <name>. We will fly to the rookery together.}}

Before heading in, [[Rooktender Otwin]] nearby has a breadcrumb quest: [[To Rambleshire]].

Speak with him:
{{dialogue|Once the Stormriders are gathered, we will form a perimeter around the Coreway to protect the workers. The nerubians will not catch us unaware a second time.

Let me know when you are ready to go.

{{gossip|quest=|Let's go. <Queue for follower dungeon.>}}

Heading in starts a special, quest version of the Rookery. If solo while queued as DPS, Baelgrim will tank as a shaman, [[Freysworn Chalcy]] will heal as a shaman, [[Meadworker Nedam]] will DPS as a mage, and [[Hunstman Krust]] will DPS as a hunter.

Head in:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Before us stands the Stormperch, <name>. It is the command center and rookery for all Stormriders.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|This is highly irregular. Why are these stormrooks tethered here?}}
:{{text|yell|[[Stormrider Vokmar]]|Thank the [[titan]]s you are here! The Stormperch has been breached and the Stormriders...  corrupted!}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Vokmar|Hurry! If we free these stormrooks, we can fly there and try to end this madness!}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|<Name>! With me!}}

Head downstairs.

:{{text|yell|Baelgrim|[[Quartermaster Koratite|Koratite]], what are you doing? Stop this!}}
:{{text|yell|Stormrider Vokmar|What is that orb? It's radiating dark energy... And it's affecting the stormrooks.}}

Interact with the [[Dark Fragment]] to destroy it:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|What dark magic is this? How dare they defile their own stormrooks!}}
:{{text|yell|Stormrider Vokmar|While you go to the roosts, I will distract them here. We can link up later.}}

Hop on a Stormrook to fly across the chasm to Storm's Roost:
:{{text|yell|Baelgrim|Gorren, what have you done?}}
:{{text|yell|[[Stormguard Gorren]]|The title. The glory. It should have been mine, Baelgrim.}}
:{{text|yell|Stormguard Gorren|You never deserved to be Stormward!}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|I left Gorren, my second, in charge of the Stormperch when I left to investigate your [[Dalaran]]'s crash.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|What has that traitor allowed to happen in my absence?}}

Clear the room, then defeat Kyrioss, the first boss encounter.
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Rest well, Kyrioss. You deserved a better rider than Gorren.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|I will deactivate Gorren myself for this sacrilege.}}
*{{text|say|Freysworn Chalcy|I guess we should go down.}}
*{{Text|say|Freysworn Chalcy|Looks like we have to go down.}}
*{{Text|say|Freysworn Chalcy|We should jump down here.}}

Jump down on the platform with [[Stormrook Feather]]s. Use the extra action button and target the ground where Chained Stormrooks are held, working down to the bottom of the well.
*{{Text|say|Freysworn Chalcy|Take a feather to slow your fall.}}
*{{text|say|Freysworn Chalcy|Those feathers should help with our descent.}}

At the bottom:
:{{text|yell|Stormrider Vokmar|Finally! I thought I'd have to fight Gorren on my own...}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Come, <name>. We will press forward and rescue who we can.}}

Push south down the path:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Their edict has been change by some... dark influence!}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Go! Find Vokmar! He will take you to safety!}}

At the Crashing Storm Hall:
:{{text|yell|Stormguard Gorren|Come then. Face me! I will stand proud on the debris of your corpse!}}
:{{text|yell|Stormguard Gorren|The [[Voidriders]] follow me now!}}

Engage Gorren:
:{{text|yell|Stormguard Gorren|I command this rookery! By right.}}
:{{text|yell|Baelgrim|Gorren! You have betrayed your directives as an [[Oathsworn]] and a Stormrider. I will not let that stand!}}
:{{text|yell|Stormguard Gorren|Your death is my directive!}}

Defeat Gorren:
:{{text|yell|Stormguard Gorren|I deserve... this power...}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|May your memory be forever cursed by what you have wrought here!}}

Push north into the Dock Lifts:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|The same dark magic that was emanating from the Stormriders is more powerful here.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Vokmar|I do not like that it feels darker and colder as we go down. But, there are more survivors to rescue.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Vokmar|The lift is out. If we want to keep going, we will have to go down the Stormrider way. Follow me!}}
*{{text|say|Freysworn Chalcy|Another drop? Let's hope for a soft landing.}}
*{{text|say|Freysworn Chalcy|Another hole. Aim for the water.}}

Jump down into the Abandoned Mines!
:{{text|yell|Stormrider Vokmar|What... is that? What did Gorren bring here?}}
:{{text|yell|Stormrider Vokmar|We have to take it down.}}

Push clockwise around the path. Vokmar will occasionally grant the player an extra action:
:{{abilities|Storm's Vengeance|Place a beacon to call Stormrider Vokmar to assist you with an attack to electrocute your foes.|range=100|notes=Instant}}

Approach the core:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Take out the creatures channeling on that core!}}

Clear the room:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Was this an earthen once? No matter. We must destroy it!}}

Engage the Voidstone Monstrosity:
:{{text|yell|Voidstone Monstrosity|It hurts!}}
:{{text|yell|Voidstone Monstrosity|Destroy!}}
:{{text|yell|Voidstone Monstrosity|<Painful groan.>}}

Defeat the Voidstone Monstrosity:
:{{text|yell|Voidstone Monstrosity|Void... consume...}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|It is done. The corruption was been eliminated, but we were too late.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Nearly our entire order has been wiped out. The Stormriders can protect Dornogal no longer.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Let us return to the Council. I... must report to them.}}
:{{text|say|Freysworn Chalcy|You can leave now. We'll clean up here.}}

Take the Stormrook that spawned north of the boss to exit the instance, then return to the Coreway:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I've tracked the nerubians to a burrow near the meadery. They must be after the cinderbrew.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|And without the Stormriders...}}

Alleria has gossip:
{{dialogue|The nerubian commander, Zirix, spoke as though he is protecting Xal'atath's location.

I will take any opportunity to deprive her of another pawn.}}

;Description
I do not doubt the [[Unbound]] can repair and unblock the [[Coreway]] expediently--but I also know how the [[nerubian]]s conduct war. If they see an opportunity for an ambush, they will take it.

With our backs turned and our focus on the Coreway, we are prime targets.

I need my stormriders to form a perimeter around [[Dornogal]] in case of attack, within or without.

Meet me outside of Stormperch. We will rally the stormriders and defend the workers.
