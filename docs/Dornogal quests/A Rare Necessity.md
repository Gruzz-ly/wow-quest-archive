==Objectives==
Collect 1 Refulgent Crystal and deliver it to [[Nagad]] in [[Dornogal]].
*[[Refulgent Crystal]]

==Description==
Occasionally, we are called upon to provide our greatest and most powerful boons. For these, I require a Refulgent Crystal.

True, such crystals are rare, but necessary for us to reach the heights of our art. Worry not, it will not be squandered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
* 9,250 [[XP]]
*[[Algari Enchanter's Folio]]

==Progress==
Once in hand, I will ensure it is put to worthwhile purpose.

==Completion==
Beautiful, yes? I'm sure you could sense the potential this might unlock.

==Patch changes==
