Ever heard of the Luredrop? It is a rare carnivorous plant that eats insects. Now we do not have insects here, but I do wish I had a few samples. You let me know if you find any, or better, just bring them to me.

Would you look at that! These are wonderful samples.

You and I should open a business. I will sell and you will get the supplies.
