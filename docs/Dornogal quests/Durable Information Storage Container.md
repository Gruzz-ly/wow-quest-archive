'''Durable Information Storage Container''' concludes the [[Overcharged Delves]] questline in week one, awarding the [[Durable Information Securing Container]] customizable belt. Start by speaking with [[Dagran Thaurissan II]] at [[Delver's Headquarters]] in [[Dornogal]] or an [[Overcharged Titan Console]] in a delve to begin. In future weeks, players will be able to upgrade the belt's item level by completing Dagran's followup quests.

==Objectives==
Destroy 4 Overcharged Pylons and complete an Overcharged Delve to charge the device.
* [[Overcharged Pylon]]s destroyed (4)
* Complete an [[Overcharged Delve]]

==Description==
Adventurer! I've discovered a smaller titan device, the Durable Information Storage Container, which can fit on yer belt. I've deduced they'll be able tae play smaller titan discs, granting ye boons ye can use anywhere. 

Each of these devices need a jump start. If ye destroy the overcharged pylons in affected areas, it should generate a spark that the device will detect and collect. It should be enough tae power it for yer lifetime.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Durable Information Securing Container]]

{{Rfg-section|11.2.0}}
* [[Overcharged Chest]]

==Progress==
The overcharged pylons are the key.

==Completion==
;Dagran
Let me see. Yes! The device is powered on. 

Okay... If I just start the initialization sequence... and it's up. There are already two discs inside. And the menu will list areas where other miniature titan discs can be found. I'm thinkin' I can improve the device, but I need time. Find me later and see. 

Oh--before ye go. I was able to gather a few extra items that should help ye on yer future excursions.

;Titan Console
Attach the device. Yes! The device is powered on.

==Notes==
Enter any overcharged delve and damage an [[Overcharged Pylon]] to destroy it. Destroy three more and then finish off the delve. This can be completed on any difficulty.
