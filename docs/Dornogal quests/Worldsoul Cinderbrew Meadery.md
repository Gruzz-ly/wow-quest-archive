==Objectives==
Complete the [[Cinderbrew Meadery]] dungeon on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> difficulty or higher.

==Description==
Ah, Cinderbrew. It really is as stout and fiery a brew as they claim.

I can't help but imagine it's how [[Beledar]] would taste...

The [[earthen]] love it! And it's an important part of their heritage. And so we can't let their meadery fall into the wrong hands.

But... watch out for the cinderbees. I hear their stingers are... well, I won't scare you with that. But I am glad I'm leaving this to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18}}
*15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
How goes the preparations?

==Completion==
Did you get stung by any bees? Did you feel the burn? Maybe you're allergic.

<Faerin chuckles.>

What? That wasn't a funny enough joke? Then you do better!

==Patch changes==
