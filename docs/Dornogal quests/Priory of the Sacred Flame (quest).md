*Help [[Sister Etna Blayze]] fight the Priory

==Description==
Good to see you, <name>. I have a job just for you.

Sister Etna Blayze of the [[Arathi]] is convinced that something is wrong within the Sacred Flame Priory. She did not expand on the matter at hand.

Please head out to the Priory of the Sacred Flame and join the sister. A stomach pebble tells me she might be right and will need your help.

*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I am not sure if you are still here or already back.

==Completion==
Sometimes a stomach pebble is all you need to listen to.

Here, a reward for your time and effort.
