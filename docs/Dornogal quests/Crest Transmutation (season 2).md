==Objectives==
Bring 15 Carved Undermine Crests to [[Vaskarn]] in [[Dornogal]], then trade them for a Pouch of Weathered Undermine Crests.
* Transmute to Pouch of Weathered Undermine Crests

==Description==
My friend, these Crests are magnificent. Did you know you could transmute them into different tier of Crest? I have the tools here to do it... hang on... I know they're here.

Ah, yes. If you need to transmute your Crests to a lower tier, that's easy. I can do that for you. If you want to transmute them to be more powerful, you'll need to outgrow the lower tier of crest so you have no use for them anymore. I can convert them for you then, but it's costly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Valorstone]]
*[[Satchel of Carved Undermine Crests]]

==Progress==
If you lose those Carved Undermine Crests, you can find more from powerful creatures around Khaz Algar. I've heard there's quite a variety of them!

==Completion==
Remarkable, isn't it?

I'm proud of how much I've learned about crests. Just two years ago, transmutation was a dream, and now it's almost my regular job. Well, a part of my regular job. Well, a part of my regular job when you need the help. Cuzolth and I really appreciate all the help you've given us.
