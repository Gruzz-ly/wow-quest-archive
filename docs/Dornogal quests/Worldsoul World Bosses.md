'''Worldsoul: World Bosses''' is a [[meta quest]] that may be offered as part of the weekly [[The Call of the Worldsoul]] quest from [[Faerin Lothar]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Objectives==
Defeat all available [[World Boss]]es in The War Within.
*[[Khaz Algar]] world boss slain
*[[Undermine]] world boss slain
*[[K'aresh]] world boss slain

==Description==
[[Hallowfall]] is not the only land beset by enemies. 

Great monsters threaten our allies. Wherever the shadows of our war have fallen, savage beasts and cunning fiends rise up. They murder [[Arathi]], [[earthen]], and the others who stand with us. Innocent farmers to great warriors. 

I know the [[Sacred Flame]] burns in you. You are our best hope to hunt these great evils.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*~{{cost|50}}
*15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Pinnacle Cache]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
I've seen monsters shifting in the distant darkness of Hallowfall. Things that haunt my nightmares.

==Completion==
How did you fare? Any new scars? Or new tales to tell?

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.2.0|note=Now also requires the [[K'aresh]] world boss.}}
*{{Patch 11.1.0|note=Added.}}
