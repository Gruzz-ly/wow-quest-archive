Ah, [[the Catalyst]]. It's a marvel that even words struggle to capture. 

Picture this, young one. Long before [[Dornogal|our city]]'s foundations were laid, [[Titan]]s roamed this land. Masters of the innovation, they forged wonders beyond imagination. And amidst their great works, they crafted the Catalyst.

And now its very power belongs to you.
