'''Seeking Knowledge of the Past''' begins the [[Horrific Visions Revisited]] questline, part of the [[patch 11.1.5]] portion of [[The War Within campaign]]. Find [[Researcher Onermu]] in the [[Foundation Hall]] of [[Dornogal]] to begin. 

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Soridormi]] near the [[Coreway]] in [[Dornogal|Dornogol]]{{sic}} on the [[Isle of Dorn]].

==Description==
Greetings, <race>. I must seek your aid. Soridormi and our kin have journeyed to [[Khaz Algar]] to help in this fight against the [[Void]]'s [[Xal'atath|new master]].

We think that we can provide insight and valuable information about past attacks by the Void. 

Seek her out near the southern edge of the Coreway.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You are just in time as always! Let us speak of what brings me here.

==Notes==
Head to south side of the Coreway where Soridormi has set up the new [[Horrific Visions Revisited]] basecamp. Also present are several other vendors: [[Rhythferr]], [[TickTak]], and [[Chreni]], weaponsmiths, [[Torie]], the provisioner, examples of the [[Corruption of the Aspects]] and [[Wicked Swarmer]] flying mounts, the [[Scourge of the Aspects]] and [[Reek]] companions, [[Augermu]], the lead visions researcher, and the [[Hourglass of Horrific Visions]].
