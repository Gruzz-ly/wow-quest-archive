'''Recompense''' concludes The First Blow chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]], and thus, of the storyline itself. The [[The War Within campaign]] continues with [[Into the Deeps]], beginning the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Adelgonn]] to inform [[Merrix]] of [[Baelgrim]]'s fate.
* Speak to Adelgonn
* Listen to the debriefing
* Witness the [[Coreway]]'s restoration

==Description==
We heard the echo of the explosion from here.

I presume you have found victory, but your solitary arrival suggests not all is well.

What happened?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Rubble-Salvaged Slippers]]
*[[Rubble-Salvaged Grips]]
*[[Rubble-Salvaged Shoulderpads]]
*[[Rubble-Salvaged Waistguard]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+2500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 125x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Tell me what happened.

==Completion==
May we all learn from Baelgrim's valor.

He died to preserve our people--our unity. We must not let that be in vain.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Merrix|Tell me what has happened.}}
:''Wenbrandt and Adelgonn walk up.''
:{{text|say|Wenbrandt|Councilward, we...}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|We have bad news.}}

Speak with [[Adelgonn]]:
{{Dialogue|Our people must know what Baelgrim did for us.

{{gossip|quest=|Tell them what happened at the meadery.}}<br>
{{gossip|{{text|red|<Skip conversation>}} We can give them the details later.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|We have repelled the [[nerubian]]s, but... Baelgrim is gone.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|I see. So he fulfilled his Edict.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Not just that. He defended the [[earthen]]. Both the [[Oathsworn]] and the [[Unbound]].}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|More than anything, he wanted us to stand together again.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Then we will honor his memory by doing so.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|It will take time to fully repair the Coreway, but the outlanders can descend to the [[Ringing Deeps]].}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|The earthen of the Isle of Dorn will support their endeavor. No matter what the Edicts say.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|If we can bring the [[Machine Speakers]] back into the fold as well, then the Council will truly stand complete.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Thank you, Councilward. Now, let's clear the last of that rubble.}}

Speak with Merrix:
{{Dialogue|With the help of Adelgonn's workers, the major repairs on the Coreway's machinery are complete.

Once the last of the rubble is removed, it will be functional once again.

{{gossip|quest=|Let's do it.}}
}}
:''A brief cut-away showing the Coreway getting restored plays out.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Outlander, I will accompany you to the Ringing Deeps. It is my home, and it too may need defending.}}
:''Brinthe mounts up and flies down the Coreway into the Ringing Deeps.''

After completion, both Merrix and Alleria get new dialogue.

{{Dialogue|title=Merrix|We mourn the destruction of our friend, Baelgrim.

But the outlanders and their perseverance give me hope.

{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:''Merrix walks over to [[Magni]].''
:{{Text|say|Merrix|Having a [[thraegar]] here in Dornogal... It is an auspicious sign indeed!}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|A wha? Oh! Right. Me. Yes, yes, yes a thraegar of old, I am.}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|Will you be returning to your duties, then?}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Duties? I, um... can ye refresh me memory o' what those are?}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|Of course! I suppose your memory is like mine. A little dim around the edges after a few thousand years...}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|Our thraegar were the best of us. Chosen by the [[titan]]s and instilled with great power.}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|They were our heralds. Our generals--they made decisions for the [[keeper]]s in their absence.}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|Your duty is to guide and protect us. To warn us of oncoming danger--which, in a way, you have.}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|These other thraegar. They looked akin to me?}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|They were... larger perhaps. But they shone, as you do, of hard minerals.}}
:''Magni turns away from Merrix.''
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Azeroth, you fox, did ye do this on purpose? To pave the way here for us?}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|I'm sorry. My auditory functions did not catch that.}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Needn't ye mind. Had a stray thought. Thank ye for joggin' me memory.}}
:''Merrix bows and walks back to his old position.''

{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|Do not be lulled into a false sense of victory, <name>. Xal'atath yet lives.

So long as she schemes in the shadows, the safety we've secured here is fleeting... just as it was in Dalaran.

While Anduin and the earthen tend to our wounded, I will protect them the way I know best.

<Alleria clenches her fist.>

By slaughtering all who threaten us.

{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{Text|say|[[Anduin Wrynn]]|Alleria. I heard you helped corner Zirix at the Meadery. Thank you.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The nerubians took so much from us. I will not let them do the same to the earthen.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|They've been good allies... and gracious hosts.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|A welcome surprise, given that they've been living in isolation for thousands of years.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|That may not be entirely the case.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I asked about why they keep calling me "[[Arathi]]"... and apparently [[Hallowfall Arathi|an Arathi armada]] arrived on Khaz Algar a number of years ago.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|They're said to have formed [[Mereldar|a settlement]] in [[Hallowfall|the caverns]] beneath the island. It sounds impossible...}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But if it's true, I want to see it for myself. They could prove to be allies in our fight against Xal'atath.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|No. We've secured a measure of safety here. Don't abandon it to chase shadows in the dark.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Isn't that what you're doing?}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I'm doing what I must. Hunting down every last nerubian. Following their trail back to Xal'atath. And claiming vengeance for our dead.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Remain in Dornogal, Anduin. Leave the shadows to me.}}
