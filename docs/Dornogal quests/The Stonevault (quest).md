==Objectives==
[[Biergoth]] wants you to end the [[skardyn]] corruption within [[The Stonevault]].
*Skardyn Corruption Purged

==Description==
I have a job for you from [[High Speaker Brinthe]] herself.

The skardyn corruption is taking over the Stonevault. To contain the panic, High Speaker Brinthe has asked us for help. I told her she could trust us like we trust the bedrock under our feet.

Go to The Stonevault and remove the skardyn corruption. Let me know when the job is done.

You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[The Severed Threads Commendation]]
*[[The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation]]
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]]
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]

==Progress==
Any news I can report to High Speaker Brinthe?

==Completion==
You are indeed like a bedrock--solid and trustworthy.

I will let High Speaker Brinthe know of your success.
