==Objectives==
Enter the [[Emerald Dream]] and obtain the Claws of Ursoc.
* Enter the Emerald Dream
* Defeat the Forces of the Nightmare
* Obtain the [[Claws of Ursoc]]
* [[Flask of Moonwell Water (usable)]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that we have Ursol's blessing, we can safely pass the magical wards and reach the claws' resting place!

Now, we must pass into the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]]. Lay down before the [[Shrine of Ursol]] and drink of the moonwater you brought earlier and your spirit will drift off into the dream.

Be careful, the Dream can be a [[Emerald Nightmare|dangerous place]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|58|20|}}
* 22200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the Claws of Ursoc?

==Completion==
I owe you my life, <name>. If it wasn't for your actions I'd be dead or worse.

That traitor, [[Xavius]], may have taken [[Ursoc]] but at least we were able to recover the claws. Hope is not lost to us yet.
