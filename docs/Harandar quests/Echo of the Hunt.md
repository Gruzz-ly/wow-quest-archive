==Description==
Haranir are fierce and ferocious. Cunning and canny. In time, we became the most feared beasts upon the mountain.

A great many wise and powerful beasts roamed the hills of our old mountain. But in time, we came to master them all.

Today, you shall hunt as we once did.

You have proven yourself a capable hunter like our ancestors of old. But simply being the strongest did not prove succor enough for the minds of our people.
