==Objectives==
Return to Eversong Forest.
*[[Emergency Rootway]] taken

==Description==
[[Halduron Brightwing|Halduron]]'s news is dire. If the lightbloom is frenzying on the surface, then the danger has grown far more quickly than we were prepared to reckon with.

We must make for Eversong at once. I will stand against any threat to Aln'hara's creation, be it here or in the world above... And I will do it alone, if I must.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
To think that while we toiled below, the Lightbloom would spread so aggressively in Eversong.

Damn it all! Every victory we win reveals rising danger.

==Notes==
;Upon accept, Orweyna summons the Emergency Rootway.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Without the Alndust we face a grim task. Steel yourself.}}
:''Halduron Brightwing & Orweyna takes to rootway to Eversong.''

Take the emergency Rootway and it takes you to [[Lightbloom Lash'Ra]] and then meet up with Orweyna and Halduron who are speaking to [[Lieutenant Valria]].
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|I have brought what help I could.}}

Valria has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Most of the Farstriders we could spare are establishing a line of defense from the Suncrown Tree, west of here.

Halduron led a group of us here to this rootway. He said he could use it to secure reinforcements. Though I admit, I expected a bit more than one <class> and one... Whatever she is.

<Valria looks pointedly at Orweyna.>}}
