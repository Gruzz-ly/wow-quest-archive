==Progress==
You have survived the Gulf of Memories. Welcome to [[Har'mara]], friend.

==Completion==
You{{Sic}} awaken. Good. Now that you have seen our past, I have brought you to my home, to see my hope for the future.

Here in Har'mara, we live in harmony with two of the local peoples, the [[rutaani]] and the [[fungarian]]s. It is my dream that this partnership will spread to the rest of Harandar.

You should get to know them as well, and see the peace that we have created together.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|One trial yet remains. Hagar is waiting for you ahead. May Aln'hara be with you, <name>.}}

Meet up with Hargar, [[Orweyna]], and [[Halduron Brightwing]]
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|These paintings... I've never experienced a magic like this.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|It is made possible by the Alndust. One of the many reasons it is so sacred to us.}}

Orweyna has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|I am glad that you made it through the trials unscathed, <name>. I expected no less, of course.

I have come to know you as competent and dependable, which is part of why I felt that sharing our history and secrets with you was warranted.

{{gossip|Why didn't you do the trials with us?}}
{{dialogue-child|I underwent these trials years ago, when I was much younger. They are standard for all Haranir to endure when they come of age and skill.

It is a rite of passage which marks the beginning of our adulthood, and which paves the way for our futures within the tribes.

{{Gossip|I'd like to ask something else.}}
}}
}}

So too does Halduron:
{{dialogue|The history of the Haranir is fascinating. They may have been the first to ever hear the song of Azeroth, whom they call Aln'hara.

{{gossip|What did you think about the trials?}}
{{dialogue-child|There was some hardship, but nothing I could not overcome. I am glad to see you made it through as well.

I like the Haranir. They are in touch with the natural world and are custodians of it, as are the rangers.

A fascinating people, and the method of transmitting their history by way of the paintings is something I've never seen before.

Hagar said that there are additional paintings located around Haranir which tell more of their stories. I am curious to find them and experience more of their history.}}
}}

Speak with Hagar:
{{dialogue|Welcome. You will have your final trial below.

If you survive, you will be accepted by my people. Enter the Delve when you are ready to begin.}}

Proceed to the Gulf of Memories delve.
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Our ancestors traveled for weeks, finding strange peoples deep below [[Mount Hyjal]]. They thought the haranir were strange too.}}

Upon lighting 5 Oversized Candles and acquiring 10 Unusual Treasure,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|The deeper they went, the more fearsome their foes became. But they were haranir, and they would not be prey.}}

;Upon freeing the 8 [[Webbed Haranir]]
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|In the deepest places, our people faced the others. They tore at flesh and devoured minds. Many were lost. But still, the haranir followed the song.}}

Fill the bar up to 100% by slaying the remembered horrors. Upon confronting [[Mul'tha'ul]],
:{{Text|Yell|Mul'tha'ul|[Shath'Yar] Vaz sk'yahf ez ag! Mh'naus nuq vwyq uhn'agth!}}
:{{Text|Whisper|Mul'tha'ul|She belongs to us! Despair and know oblivion!}}

;Upon slaying Mul'tha'ul
:{{Text|Yell|Mul'tha'ul|[Shath'Yar] I qam lal, i, sk'yahf qi'plahf marwol wgah. Yrr uull uull agth agthu.}}

Make sure you loot the [[Fragment of Revelation]] and then go back to the Den of Echoes and speak to Orweyna.
{{Dialogue|I do not understand. All that you and Halduron have seen, I already knew. So where is this great shame that the Zur'ashar alludes to?

Now that you've acquired the key fragment, the final memory will reveal itself to us. Perhaps we will both find our answers here.

{{gossip|Why didn't you do the trials with us?}}

{{Gossip|quest=|Play Movie=|<Hand Orweyna the Fragment of Revelation.>}}

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Something In The Delves" starts playing:
:''Orweyna walks up to the mural.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Orweyna|The Zur'ashar spoke of a great tragedy and shame.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Orweyna|I have seen nothing to shame us.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|You have not yet seen the journey to its end.}}
:''Orweyna places the fragment to the mural and shows the memory of the roots appearing''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|Aln'hara's song was just an echo.}}
:''Hagar starts to walk as echoes of the Ruutani and Fungarian battling each other were shown.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|The goddess was gone when they arrived.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|Without her, the land was falling apart.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|After all the trials, and journeys, we hoped to find purpose.}}
:''The echoes of the Haranir appear.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|Instead we found discord and death.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|We blamed the missing goddess.}}
:''One of the echo turns into a bat.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|We blamed the land.}}
:''The bat slays a Fungarian and roars. And the other echo blows up a ruutani.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|We blamed each other.}}
:''The second echo turns into a grimlynx.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|The goddess' absence was not a tragedy,}}
:''The third echo turns into a grimlynx as well.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|but a trial--}}
:''The two echoes clashed Orweyna blocked from being blown but the adventurer loses his/her consciousness.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|One we failed.}}
:''The camera shows the dead ruutani and fungarian.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|When at last we found our way,}}
:''The camera zooms out showing the echoes of the Haranir looking at the corpses.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|the elders feared what would happen if we returned to the surface.}}
:''The cutscene cuts to Hagar.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|So...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|They forbade it.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Hagar|But we can't stay hidden forever.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, The adventurer has awakened in [[Har'mara]].

Walk to Hagar and turn in.
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Ah, you're awake. Welcome to Har'mara.}}
