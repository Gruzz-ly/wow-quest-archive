==Description==
We may have stemmed the malignant growth, but we have so many more questions than answers. How did this happen? How did this grow so much?

How did [[Ruia]] not understand the extent of the calamity?

Azeroth needs our help. I will not stand Idly by while she is overwhelmed.

I know you will not, either.

==Notes==
;Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The elders must hear of this. Go wit the wind!}}

Go to the Den and meet up with Orweyna and [[Halduron Brightwing]].
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|Orweyna, <name>, thank goodness! Eversong is in danger!}}

Speak with Halduron:
{{dialogue|While you were searching for answers in the Rift, I went back to Silvermoon to consult the Magisters.

We barely had time to discuss our findings before we received word from the runestones north of Farstrider Retreat. Something has whipped the Lightbloom into a frenzy. If we don't act now, all of Eversong could be lost.

I only hope Orweyna's Elders recognize the looming threat.

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "We Can Help" starts playing:
:''The Haranir are yelling and shouting to the elders and Hannan. [[Gnarla]] and [[Ter'kova]] look at each other. Orweyna speaks up.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Orweyna|Shaladrassil's roots still stand.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|[[Ran'hune]]|How?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Orweyna|The Alndust.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Orweyna|But we need more. The surface needs--}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Ter'kova|No! We will not leave our home defenseless.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Orweyna|We can gather more.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Ran'hune|We cannot risk our people for outsiders.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Ter'kova|Some branches can burn.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Ter'kova|Our calling is to protect the roots.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Orweyna|The last time I left, it was about my calling.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Orweyna|This time, it is about my friends.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Orweyna|And I will protect them with or without your aid.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, Hannan has a gossip
{{dialogue|Orweyna is too brash, too reckless. I think she would agree now, after all that she has seen outside Harandar.

Unfortunately, the elders may be too cautious.}}

Go to the portal room and meet up with Orweyna.

Halduron has a new gossip:
{{dialogue|Without the Haranir and their magicks. our options against the Lightbloom are limited.}}
