==Objectives==
Collect 8 intact saptor fronds from the [[saptor]]s of the [[Harandar]] cascades.
* [[Intact Saptor Frond]] (8)

==Description==
Okay, so I may have a DIFFERENT thing that I'm supposed to be doing in the [[Cascades]], too. It's my turn to gather saptor fronds for stew. It's such a pain. Not only are saptor fronds horribly bitter, but the saptors are barely even fun to hunt! They don't even make your blood flow that fast before they die.

But hey! You probably don't get to fight saptors as often as I do. Maybe while you're looking for skyglass, you could gather some up for me? You know. While you're in the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]
