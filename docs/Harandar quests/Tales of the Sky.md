==Objectives==
Collect 6 Fallen Skyshards in the cascades of [[Harandar]].
* [[Stray Skyshards]] (6)

==Description==
Wait a minute... You're no [[rutaani]] at all! Are you one of those 'outsiders' that [[Saku]] and [[Orkon]] keep talking about?

Oh! I just had a great idea. Did you know that the Goddess used to have a pet? Rumor has it that when the Goddess disappeared, [[Aln'sharan]] was SO sad that he flew up into the highest roots of Harandar, never to be seen again. But every so often, he goes looking for food... And his scales fall as skyglass!

I wanna gather some. It's my dream to see Aln'sharan firsthand! Will you help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]
