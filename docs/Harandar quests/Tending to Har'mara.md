==Objectives==
Complete tasks in [[Har'mara]].
*Tasks completed (0/100%)

==Description==
Har'mara has long been a refuge for those who have removed themselves from the conflicts that often arise between the rutaani and the fungarians.

Here, they learn how to live with one another. They work, play, and live together, balanced.

You have learned much about the past of the Haranir, including our deepest shame. Now you will see our current work -harmony.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Spore-Touched Baton]]
* [[Spore-Touched Shortbow]]
* [[Spore-Touched Falchion]]
* [[Spore-Touched Buckler]]
* [[Spore-Touched Staff]]
* [[Spore-Touched Dagger]]
* [[Spore-Touched Bludgeon]]
* [[Spore-Touched Mace]]
* [[Spore-Touched Saber]]

You will also receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Sometimes harmony and friendship are helped by small acts of service.

I hope that the rutaani and fungarians here have come to see you as an ally.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Most rutaani are very territorial. This is one of the few places we interact with them in peace.}}

Make sure you accept [[The Traveling Flowers]] from [[Halduron Brightwing]],
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|It is strange to see friendly rutaani.}}

Fill the bar up by calling the [[Hungry Rotling]] to dinner (10%), digging the [[Rotting Refuse]] (7%), & watering the [[Na'bala Bloom]] (7%).

Return to the hut after you're done.
:{{Text|Say|Meeka|No, this one has not seen rutaani behaving that way.}}

Upon completion,
:''[[Powercap]] appears''
:{{Text|Say|Powercap|[[Koozat]]'s gone berzerk!}}
:''Powercap runs out.''
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|The lumbering beast outside? It seemed so docile.. This reeks of foul play.}}

Orweyna has a gossip:
{{dialogue|I am glad you made it through the trials, <name>. My people are very secretive, but it was good to share our history with you, friend.}}
