==Objectives==
Speak with Orwyena{{Sic}} in [[Fairbreeze Village]].

==Description==
With the Devouring Host occupying much of our attention and time, we leave our backs exposed to other threats that wait in the wings. This lightbloom that has --or afflicted Eversong grows worse by the day. If it gets out of control, then we might find ourselves fighting a two front conflict worse, having our home consumed completely while we busy ourselves with the void.

The strange woman who you found poking about the lightbloom... You seem to be familiar with her. Seek her out. She may have answers.

==Completion==
It is good to see you again, friend.

Would that we were meeting under less fraught circumstances.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|We can't defend against both the Voidstorm and the aggression from the Lightbloom.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|[[Halduron Brightwing|Halduron]] has joined your haranir friend to aid in ending the threat. They await you in Fairbreeze.}}

Go to [[Fairbreeze Village]].
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|I have to learn more of the Lightbloom -- even with the risks of travelling to your homeland.}}

Halduron has a gossip:
{{dialogue|This is an unparalleled opportunity to see the homeland of the Haranir. They have been so secretive that not even a whisper of Harandar has come to us through the roots of the world trees.

{{gossip|Who are you?}}
{{dialogue-child|I am the Ranger General of Silvermoon, Halduron Brightwing. I lead the Farstriders, rangers whose skill is unsurpassed by any other in Azeroth. And probably beyond.

{{gossip|I'd like to ask something else.}}
}}

{{gossip|Why are you coming along?}}
{{dialogue-child|It was requested by Grand Magister Rommath that I join you and Orweyna in Harandar. My skills as a Farstrider ranger allow me to detect lightbloom.

Orweyna suspects the infection may have originated in her homeland, and I will accompany you to find this source.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|I know what the lightbloom looked like long before it was dangerous. I can help.}}
