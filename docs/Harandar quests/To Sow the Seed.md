==Objectives==
Return to the [[Den (Harandar)|Den]]
*Meet Orweyna at the Den

==Description==
[[Eonka]]'s seed from [[Rift of Aln]] is the clue we were looking for. The inhabitants and plants there seem immune to the lightbloom!

We must investigate the Rift for ourselves. Let us return to the Den and plan our next moves.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Light-Blighted Leggings]]
*[[Light-Blighted Trousers]]
*[[Light-Blighted Greaves]]
*[[Light-Blighted Legguards]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We return to where we started, but this time you have been blessed by the goddess and we have evidence that the spread of the lightbloom may be stalled!

The way forward is not yet clear, but I feel that we are closer.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|I will take this seed back to Silvermoon. Perhaps the magisters will have some insight.}}

Go to the Den and meet up with Orweyna who is with [[On'hiea]] and the Elders.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|There you are. Unfortunately our fears were well-founded.}}

On'hiea has a gossip:
{{dialogue|I learned the value of Orweyna's resolve when I left Harandar with her the first time.

I will not let her flounder on her own.

The Rift of Aln is dangerous beyond measure... but I will find a way to help.}}

==Progression==
