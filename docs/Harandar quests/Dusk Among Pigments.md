==Objectives==
Speak with [[Orn'shan]] in [[Amirdrassil Roots]]

==Description==
As [[Paintmakers]], we devote our life to protecting the harmony within the visionstone. I have studied great works, true masterpieces that stir the soul.

Then there is... whatever Orn'shan is doing. Their style is undisciplined and lacking refinement. It is all nonsensical and is disrupting the harmony we were sworn to protect--an embarrassment both for them and for anyone forced to look at it.

You must speak with them. Perhaps they will listen to an outsider before their reputation collapses entirely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]
