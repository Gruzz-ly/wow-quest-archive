==Objectives==
Survive the Lightbloom onslaught.
*Tell [[Grand Magister Rommath|Rommath]] to begin the ritual (Optional)
*Lightfrenzy onslaught survived

==Description==
With our ground forces pulled back, our position will be overwhelmed in a matter of minutes. It's time to execute our gambit.

Rommath and the Magisters have provided us a mana gem that can be used to overload Lash'ra's runestones. Take it. and infuse the stones with the mana contained therein. That will set the stage for the Magisters' ritual -- to detonate the runestones and burn the entirety of Lash'ra to the ground.

We just have to hope the Lightbloom cannot survive in an inferno.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Dissipated Ritual Bangles]]
*[[Bracers of the Suncrown]]
*[[Hardened Lash'ra Cuffs]]
*[[Light-Scorched Vambraces]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I... I cannot believe it. My kin on the surface, standing shoulder to shoulder with surface-dwellers, and wielding the magics of Aln...

<Orweyna sets her jaw and flashes you a smile.>

But we do not have time for sentiment. We must bring Ruia to justice, and end this frenzy.

==Notes==
Speak with Rommath,
{{Dialogue|By all means, take your time! It's not like we have an army of ravenous tree-people marching across the river to devour us.

{{gossip|quest=|Begin the ritual.}}

[[Lightwarden Ruia]] appears and he will summon the first wave of [[Lash'ra Thornguard]]s.

Upon wiping the first wave, Ruia summons the second wave consisting of [[Lash'ra Mistcaller]]s & a [[Lightmad Saptor]] & a [[Barkborn Petalwing]].
:{{Text|Say|[[Halduron Brightwing]]|Any time now, Rommath!}}
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|This is no simple cantrip! Keep firing and try not to die!}}

Upon wiping the second wave,
:{{Text|Say|Lightward Ruia|Pitiful Orweyna. You cannot stop the Lightbloom alone.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|They are relentless! Aln'hara, give me strength!}}

Slay the [[Lightblanched Ancient]] and a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "The Haranir Arrive for Orweyna & Friends" starts playing:
:''Halduron looks at Rommath.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Halduron Brightwing|It's now or never Rommath!}}
:''The Lightbloom Ancient interferes Rommath's ritual.
:{{Text|Bossemote|Halduron Brightwing|Rommath!}}
:''A whole swarm of Lightbloom came''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Halduron Brightwing|More? Fall back!}}
:''When all hope seems lost, rootways begin to appear. From them, the haranir led by [[Hagar]] emerge to take out the Ancient. Ruia shapeshifts into a bat and flies off.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Halduron Brightwing|For Eversong!}}

On the other side of the Cutscene, Orweyna was surprised to see Hagar here.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Elder Hagar?}}
:{{Text|Say|Elder Hagar|Help has arrived, little sprout.}}

Halduron has a new gossip:
{{dialogue|Before the Hara'ti arrived, we could only hope to mitigate the loss. The forest would have been devastated.

But with the haranir here in force, and aln-magicks at their disposal besides, we stand a chance of driving this frenzy back.}}
