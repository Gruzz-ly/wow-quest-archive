==Objectives==
Find [[Orweyna]] and the [[Shul'ka]] in the [[Vale of Mists]].
*Find [[Orweyna]] in the [[Shrine of Mists]]

==Description==
I have warned Orweyna of the dangers and madness that lay within the Rift of Aln, but she believes it is her only path forward. I envy her faith.

Someone can help her show the way. The Shul'ka. The Hunters of Shadows. They have sacrificed everything to protect the haranir from the effects of the Rift.

I will let one know that you need help. You will find him in the Vale of Mists.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have given up my connection to the Goddess to protect my people from the dangers of the Rift of Aln. I do not believe anyone should ever go there without knowing what you risk. Haranir will succumb and die without protection.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Ku'paal|If you must go, you will need the Shul'ka. How you feel about him cannot change that.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I know, but neither does it change the past.}}
:''Orweyna runs off.''

Go the the Vale of Mists and meet with Orweyna who is with Amarakk.
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|After all this time, you return and seek entry into the Rift? You have not changed at all, Orweyna.}}

Amarakk has a gossip after completion:
{{dialogue|The Goddess no longer sits in her Cradle, but her influence remains. The Rift of Aln is too dangerous a place for haranir to enter.

I severed my connection to the Goddess to be able to serve. You must respect my sacrifice and heed my words.}}

==Progression==
{{Call of the Goddess}}
