==Objectives==
Ride on the hummingbird, destroy the shields protecting 4 Lightbloom Spreaders and defeat Lightbloom creatures in the Blinding Bloom.
*Ride the [[Haranir Petalwing]]
*Lightbloom Spreader Shield destroyed (4)
*Lightbloom rutaani defeated (0/100%)

==Description==
We've gathered the haranir we have available and distributed the alndust. We have everything we need, but they need to be able to safely enter the area. Scouts have told us that the creatures spreading the Lightbloom are protected by a shield. We must stop them. We will also need to thin their numbers.

Get on the hummingbird, <name>, and let's clear the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,400 [[XP]]

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Striking at individual blooms is not enough. We'll need to take drastic action.}}

Hop on the Haranir Petalwing.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|To think that Eversong's Light would wreak such havoc in Harandar.}}

Fill the bar up by killing the [[Lightblinded Grovewarden]] (5%), [[Lightblinded Thornguard]]s (5%), [[Lightblinded Sap Spinner]]s, [[Blinding Thornmaw]]s (8%) and break the [[Lightbloom Shield]]s.

Once all of that's done, return to Orweyna.
