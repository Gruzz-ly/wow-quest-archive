==Objectives==
Go get Orweyna in the Cradle and find a way to free [[Gazlowe]].
* Speak to [[Orweyna]] in the Den
* Offer [[Handcrafted Plush]] to [[Nahuut]]
* [[Handcrafted Plush]] (Provided)

==Description==
Hey! Champ!

Look, I swear I'm glad to see ya. I'm just in a little bit of a diplomatic situation here.

Can you go get Orweyna and bring her back here? See if she'll talk this beast into letting me go?

I'm not a elekk plushie, for crying' out loud.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Never try to take something from a pangolin without asking nicely. Or offering something even better.

==Completion==
I'm pleased that Monte came this way to visit. But I can see that he is as out of his depth here as I was in [[Undermine]].

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Go get Orweyna! I'll be fine for now. Nice critter here. Nice, quill-covered, bear-like... critter.}}

;Upon petting Nahuut,
:{{Text|Emote|Nahuut refuses to move.}}

Speak with Orweyna who is meditation on the edge of the cliff,
{{Dialogue|Yes? What has happened?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Explain Gazlowe's predicament to Orweyna.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Gazlowe has come to see my home? He made it farther than I expected before running into trouble.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I will go to him. You see if [[Imhayo]] has something Nahuut would like to cuddle more than a goblin.}}

Buy the Handcrafted Plush from [[Imhayo]]. Then head to Gazlwowe and give the plush to Nahuut.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Gilded greasepans! That's a relief, thanks for the help.}}

Monte Gazlowe has a gossip
{{Dialogue|Hey. pal! I was just hanging here and hoping to see a friendly face.

<Gazlowe grins a little too widely. suggesting he is in some discomfort.>}}
