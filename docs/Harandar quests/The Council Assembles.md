==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|Orweyna has gone ahead to speak to her Elders. Let me know when you're ready, <name>.}}

Speak with Halduron:
{{dialogue|The Council is convening to judge Orweyna for the crimes they feel she has committed. We will join her when you are ready.

{{gossip|Play Movie=|Let's go.}}

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "The Haranir Council" starts playing:
:{{Text|Bossemote|The Council convenes and [[Ruia]] lists Orweyna's crimes. She says she was following the goddess' orders and we have also heard the song. We are sent to the Den of Echoes for trials.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, Orweyna kneels before The Elders consists of Hagar, [[Ran'hune]], [[Nye'rangi]], [[Ter'kova]], & [[Gnarla]].

Halduron & Ruia are present as well.

Ruia has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Orweyna has broken our laws and customs. The Den of Echoes will teach you about our ways, and challenge you to prove yourself.

If you return, it will mean Aln'hara has granted you leave to stay. I do not expect to see you again.

{{gossip|What is the Den of Echoes?}}
{{dialogue-child|A place where the memories of our people live on. A place of challenge and trial.

A place to meet Aln'hara or be destroyed by her.}}
}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Ruia|You have forgotten the value of tradition, Orweyna. Go to the Den of Echoes, and remind yourself of what it means to be haranir.}}
