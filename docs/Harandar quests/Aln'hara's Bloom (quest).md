==Objectives==
Travel to [[Veilroot Clearing]] and uncover the truth behind Aln'hara's Bloom.
*Meditate at the [[Ancient Visionstone]]
*Learn about Aln'hara's Gift

==Description==
When I was young in the path of a Zur' Ashar, I heard a tale of a gift from Aln'hara. "A sign of the goddess, felt in the stillness."

Unfortunately, all those who were there to experience the event eventually passed on before we learned the secrets of our special paint.

Would you walk the memory that surrounds the bloom and find out if this theory is true?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Avid Learner's Supply Pack]]
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
What a gentle truth you have uncovered! Aln'hara did not speak with thunder, nor return in form, but in patience, she revealed her presence.

You have given voice to the voiceless, and in doing so, restored a moment to our people.

Please, take this token as a symbol of your journey.

And should the world grow quiet once more, return. I will be listening for the next whisper.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|To stand in the stillness where her presence once stirred... That is no small honor. Go now, and listen with more than ears.}}

Head to the Veilroot Clearing and interact with the Ancient Visionstone.

===Stage One: Signs in the Living World===
:''Observe strange creatures in the wilds of Harandar and watch for discordant signs.''
*Strange wildlife observed (4)

:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|The Seekers did not cry out for the goddess's return. They listened, and waited, in the quiet places where memory clings.}}

The creatures that are available to observe are a [[Rutaani Sapling]], the [[Auralight Moth]], a [[Whispering Petalwing]], and the [[Rancidbloom Potatoad]]s.

Upon observing the Rancidbloom Potatoad,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Some creatures became consumed with gluttony, in order to fill the void created from her departure.}}

Upon observing the Whispering Petalwing,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Some creatures still sang in harmony with her.}}

Upon observing the Auralight Moth,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|The creatures remembered where she had been.}}

Upon observing the Rutaani Sapling,
:{{Text|Emote|The Rutaani does not react to your presence, it continues to sit silently.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Some creatures forgot her song and listened only to the silence that followed.}}

===Stage Two: A Fractured Song===
:''Align the ancient resonance stone by timing your actions with it's pulses.''
*Resonance stone attuned

:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|The stones echoed her song, but this one was different. Within it the song stirred, yearning to share its tune.}}

Head to the [[Resonance Stone]] and attune with it.

===Stage Three: The Echo Chase===
:''Follow an echo through the glade and anchor its memories.''
*Seeker visions uncovered (3)

:{{Text|Emote|A faint echo shimmers into view, its gentle motion urging you to follow.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|They followed not a path, but an echo of feeling.}}

Follow the Echo of Memory and uncover the first vision with the glimpse of a [[Seeker of Aln'hara]].
:{{Text|Emote|The echo begins to move again, urging you to follow.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|She was not in the light, she was the warmth it left behind.}}

Follow the Echo of Memory and uncover the second vision showing three Seekers of Aln'hara meditating.
:{{Text|Emote|The echo begins to move again, urging you to follow.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|The seekers sat in silence. Even there, we heard her song.}}

Follow the Echo of Memory into the [[Veilroot Hollow]] and uncover the last vision showing Five Seekers of Aln'hara.
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|We called out with song. She did not answer. But something she left behind did. And it was enough.}}

===Stage Four: The Bloom at the End===
:''Receive Aln'hara's Bloom.''
*[[Aln'hara's Bloom]] collected

Upon collecting Aln'hara's Bloom,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|She did not return. But something of her remained, blooming in the silence for those who remembered.}}

Head back to the [[Reliquary of the Zur'Ashari]] and turn in.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Aln'hara leaves no trace by accident. The Bloom was not a gift... it was a promise. Living, sacred and real. Thank you for revealing the truth of it's story.}}
