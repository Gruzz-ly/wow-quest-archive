==Objectives==
Fly near the flames on the roots of [[Teldrassil]] to douse them.
*Smoldering Fires doused (18)

==Description==
<name>, there is smoke rising above [[Har'mara]]. The roots are on fire--not here, but beneath the remnants of the tree!

I have seen this happen many times, but we must always respond with haste.

Take to the skies and douse them, immediately!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<name>, the smell of smoke fills me with the same dread I felt on [[War of the Thorns|that terrible day]].

There is much heat still trapped within the largest roots, and in the right circumstances, the burning begins anew.

If we have any hope of seeing the roots restored one day, we have to be vigilant against even small fires.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Go quickly, <name>--there is nothing more important to me than keeping those flames at bay!}}

Fly into [[Teldrassil Roots]] and land on the smoldering fires to extinguish them.

After putting them out, return to the [[Shrine of Ages]].
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|The flames will be back, but we must always extinguish them.}}
