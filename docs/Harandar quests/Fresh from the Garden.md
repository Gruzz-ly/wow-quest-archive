==Description==
Age has caught up with me this morning and I have pulled something.

<Yu'relen clutches his back.>

Still, our village meal must still be prepared. Otherwise, it will mean the loss of much more than just an empty stomach.

If you would gather some ingredients for the meal, your aid would not go unappreciated.
