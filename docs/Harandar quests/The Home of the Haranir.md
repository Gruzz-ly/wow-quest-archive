==Objectives==
Accompany Orweyna and Gazlowe around the Cradle and Den.
*Press the Button on Gazlowe's Shredder
*Pick Up Hand Claws
*Try the [[Tasty Mushroom Soup]]

==Description==
I am eager to show Monte my home, but I know it is very different from what he is used to.

Come with us as he meets my people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Can't say I've ever seen a place like this before. But I like it. I can see how the haranir were drawn here. How Orweyna grew up here and learned all she learned.

Bah, look at me getting sentimental. What's next?

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|There are very few descendents left of the original mountain beasts, and we honor them. Welcome to Harandar, Monte. Let's go meet my people.}}

Head to the den with Orweyna and Monte Gazlowe whoa are with [[Kuri]], [[Danul]], [[Saku]], [[Orchon]], [[Ooria]], [[Su'meera]], [[Wenalo]], [[Ilomai]], [[Shao'mal]], & [[Nayeli]]
:{{Text|Say|Su'meera|Do it!}}
:{{Text|Say|Shao'mal|Push the button!}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|All right! We're gonna push the button! Stand back!}}

Activate the Shredder and Monte takes off showing the fireworks.
:{{Text|Say|Kuri|Again!}}
:{{Text|Say|Shao'mal|Again!}}
:{{Text|Say|Su'meera|Again!}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|We will be back later! For now, Monte, I have more to show you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|That's right, kids. You'll get to wreck the structural integrity of this mech soon enough!}}
:{{Text|Say|Shao'mal|It means we get to break it!}}
:''Orweyna and Gazlowe leaves.''

Follow the duo to the [[Weapon Rack (Harandar)|Weapon Rack]] and pick up the hand claws.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|These were some of the first weapons made for me. I tried many different kinds, but the claws always felt right.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Hey, some like dynamite, some like caustics. Some prefer good ol' kinetic force.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Come, let us go down deeper into the Den.}}
:''Orweyna and Gazlowe depart.''

Head deeper into the den and taste the Tasty Mushroom Soup.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Huh, what's in this? It's spicy, but not too spicy.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|We have spent generations balancing the perfect blend of spices and herbs for the mushrooms. But be warned, it can sneak up on you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Hah, bring it! I'll have more of that later. What else do ya got to show me?}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|There is one more haranir tradition I would show you. It's this way, to the painted walls.}}
:''Orweyna and Gazlowe depart.''

Meet the duo at the wall.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|So you're saying, over thousands of years, all this was painted by lots of different people?}}

Orweyna has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|Monte showed me all around his home in [[Undermine]], where I was very different from everyone else.

Here, I want him to feel that he is welcome too. It's the least I can do.}}
