==Objectives==
Meet [[Shul'ka Seila]] outside the [[Blossoming Terrace]].

==Description==
When the haranir first arrived in Harandar, they brought with them a staff formed of the roots of a great tree. That tree has since gone away, but the roots remain.

It has been our duty to protect that staff and pass it on through the generations. But now, it has been stolen.

Your task is to find it and return it to [[Zur'Ashar Kassameh]].

Go into the mists below the Den and seek out the Shul'ka. They will guide you on your search.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|41}}
*15,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I greet you, student of the Cradle.

Aksem sent word that he'd toss someone down here to help find the missing staff. I don't often see others from the Den, other than the foolish ones who wander down.

You're not one of the foolish ones, are you?

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Aksem|Every wielder of that rootstaff has woven new life into it. It's a living record of all that have come before.}}
:{{Text|Say|Aksem|If it is gone for good, it would be a tremendous loss of history to the haranir.}}

Head to the Terrace and meet up with Seila.
:{{Text|Sat|Shul'ka Seila|There you are. You're not afraid of a few little birds, I hope. No? Good.}}
