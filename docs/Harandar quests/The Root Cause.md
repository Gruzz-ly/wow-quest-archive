==Objectives==
Take the portal and meet Orwenya{{Sic}} in Harandar.
*Talk to Orweyna.
*Take the portal to Harandar

==Description==
The rutaani who attacked Silvermoon come from my homeland, Harandar. This lightbloom infection is new, however.

The time has come for me to return to my people. I will face their judgement, and explain my actions.

If the lightbloom has spread I must warn my people of the danger. If you're willing to join me, I will take you and your insistent friend through the rootways to Harandar.

Let me know when you are ready to go.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You made it. I wasn't sure your kind could. Don't worry, that nauseous feeling will pass.

We stand in the deep roots of [[Amirdrassil]]. My home lies beyond.

Let us see what welcome awaits.

==Notes==
;Speak with Orweyna
{{dialogue|We must not delay. It is time for me to return to Harandar.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready. Let's go!}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Harandar is a dangerous place.}}
:''Orweyna starts running.''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I warn you both-- my people do not welcome outsiders. They may no longer welcome me.}}

Follow Orweyna to the tree and [[Halduron Brightwing]] follows suit. Orweyna brings up the [[Mysterious Rootway]] and she and Halduron goes into it. Take the Rootway and you're in [[Amirdrassil Roots]] in Harandar.
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|This place... It is like we've stepped back in time.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Tread carefully. You will be seen as invaders.}}

Orweyna has a gossip:
{{dialogue|It feels good to be home and to touch the roots of Harandar. I have been too long away.

{{gossip|Will your people welcome you?}}
{{dialogue-child|It is against our ways for the haranir to have contact with the outside world. I do not expect a warm welcome awaits us, but the threat of the Lightbloom does not originate on the surface world.

The time has come for my people to join the fight. Convincing them will be a challenging task - if they let us live long enough to try.}}
}}

So does Haludron:
{{dialogue|This is astonishing. An entire world at the end of the rootways. How Harandar managed to stay hidden all these hundreds of thousands of years is an incredible feat.

The lightbloom is our focus, but I admit I am intrigued to learn more of the Haranir and their world within our world.}}
