==Objectives==
Complete the Blnding{{sic}} Vale dungeon.
*Destroy [[Ziekket]] inside the [[Blinding Vale]].

==Description==
We have traced Ruia's flight through the rootways. As we suspected, he has sought refuge deep within the Blinding Vale, where the Lightbloom first took root within Harandar.

With alndust empowering our command of life, we are able to keep the lightbloom from spreading uncontrolled. But we will run out of alndust long before Ruia runs out of patience.

Ruia is wise and powerful. But his actions in Eversong prove that his conviction has grown into an uncontrollable fanaticism. He must be stopped.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|93|60}}
*24,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So it is done, then.

[[Ruia]]'s demise is a tragedy. You never knew him as such, but he was once a man of honor and conviction. To think that the light would blind him so completely to the folly of his ambitions...

In the end, he thought he was doing what was best for Harandar. I can only hope his soul finds both peace and forgiveness, as it seeks [[Aln'hara]] in death.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both '''The Blinding Vale''' from Orweyna and [[Looming Shadows]] from [[Hagar]],
:{{Text|Say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|<name>, return to the Sanctum of Light, This struggle is far from over.}}
:''Hagar starts returning to the rootway.''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Thank you <name>. You helped bring my people back into the world. The Goddess would be pleased, I think.}}
:''Orweyna departs. [[Grand Magister Rommath]] starts taking off followed by Lor'themar Theron and then [[Halduron Brightwing]].''
