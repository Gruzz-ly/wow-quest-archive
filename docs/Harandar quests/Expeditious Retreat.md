==Objectives==
Rescue 3 Beleaguered Farstriders.
*[[Swarming Shinesipper]] slain
*[[Swarming Lightsaptor]] slain
*[[Swarming Shinemaw]] slain

==Description==
I have a way to stop the Lightbloom from spreading further through the forest, but it isn't exactly a delicate touch. Normally, I'd never dream of resorting to a controlled burn in such a healthy portion of Eversong... But the frenzy is spreading too quickly, and we are running out of options.

I've sounded the retreat to my Farstriders, but some of them haven't responded. I need you to find any rangers in particularly sticky situations. and lend your aid in securing their escape.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Most of the Farstriders have retreated to our position. Those that remain are prepared to slip away once the ritual begins.

We're out of time. It's now or never.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both '''Expeditious Retreat''' & [[A Last Resort]],
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|If you detonate your runestones, your forests will burn.}}
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|We have rebuilt from ashes before. Without any Alndust, what other recourse do we have?}}
:''The Party splits up.''

Battle the Swarming Shinesipper and rescue [[Farstrider Cerath]].

Battle the Swarming Lightsaptor and rescue [[Farstrider Norella]].
:{{Text|Say|Farstrider Norella|Blasted things were set to tear me apart. I'm falling back for now.}}

Battle the Swarming Shinemaw and rescue [[Farstrider Kadira]].
:{{Text|Say|Farstrider Kadira|We are being overrun! I'll seek a safer vantage.}}

Meet back up with Halduron & Orweyna at the [[Suncrown Tree]] with [[Grand Magister Rommath]] and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|The Lightbloom has reached the river. Light of the sun preserve us. We are out of time.}}

Rommath has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Well, this is a fine mess you all have made.}}

So too does Orweyna,
{{Dialogue|The council has rejected our call. The Hara'ti do not stand against the Lightbloom.

But I do. And I will. With what Alndust I have, we will ward off what influence we can.}}
