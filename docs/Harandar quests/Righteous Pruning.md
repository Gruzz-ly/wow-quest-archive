==Objectives==
Kill 4 Lightblinded Sap Weavers in the Blinding Bloom.
*[[Lightblinded Sap Weaver]] slain

==Description==
This is a threat that could destroy all of Harandar if left unchecked. That's why we will pull this out at the root.

The ruutani{{Sic}} who did not have the time to escape this place must be fully corrupted by now. Unfortunate, but it makes our plan of attack simple. Their leaders must be spreading the lightbloom. We must strike them down.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Hazy Penumbral Treads]]
*[[Boots of Infinite Gravity]]
*[[Neverending Vortex Stompers]]
*[[Warbots of the Colossal Behemoths]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I wish we could save everyone, but...

A gruesome but necessary task.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[At the Root]], [[Our Beloved, Returned]], & '''Righteous Pruning'''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The madness has overtaken the roots. We must stop it here.}}

Across the [[Blinding Bloom]] slay 4 Lightblinded Sap Weavers.

Then return to Orweyna and turn in the quests.
