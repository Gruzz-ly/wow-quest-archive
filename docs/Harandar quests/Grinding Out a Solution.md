==Objectives==
Find 5 Alngrown Fungus in the [[Rift of Aln]].
*[[Alngrown Fungus]] (5)

==Description==
I have been pondering what [[Hagar]] could have meant from the moment [[Orweyna]] mentioned an answer to your problems.

There are no mystical fountains, no weapons. Everything in the Rift is created from the same source: alndust, the distillation of the influence of the Goddess. If we hunt a large manifestation, you will have the power of creation in its purest form.

We cannot defeat it without help. Search the Rift and look for fungi large enough to cultivate. I can use them to give us an edge.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We might have a chance with this. I'll be able to coat my weapons with this and craft a powerful poison.

==Notes==

:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|In the Rift's darkest depths, Alndust coalesces into the monstrosities before you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|The manifestations pose a grave danger -- but they are also the most plentiful source of Alndust.}}

Across the Rift, gather 5 Alngrown Fungi and then meet back with Amarakk deeper into the Rift of Aln.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|We would not have made it here without you.}}
