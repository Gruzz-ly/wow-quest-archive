==Objectives==
Burn 5 Lightfrenzy Rootways.
*Lightfrenzy Rootway destroyed (5)

==Description==
When the Farstriders first discovered the Lightbloom, we thought it to be merely an aesthetic change -- a small quirk of the Sunwell's influence. Would that we knew then what we know now.

These light-frenzied rootways must lead all the way back to Harandar. If we don't close them, it won't matter how many of these damned things I bring down. Close the rootways and we might have a fighting chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Damn it all. For every rootway you torch. two more crop up elsewhere. It's like they're self-perpetuating, spreading in the span of moments.

I don't think we can solve this with arrows and magic, even with Orweyna's help. We don't have enough Alndust, nor enough Haranir to prevent the spread of this frenzy.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting '''Stem the Tides''' from Halduron Brightwing & [[Cull and Burn]] from [[Orweyna]],
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|We used the last of the Alndust we gathered. What do you intend to do, Halduron?}}
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|Whatever I must.}}

Across [[Lightbloom Lash'Ra]], close out 5 [[Lightfrenzy Portalway]]s. Then return to Orweyna & Halduron and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|This is getting us nowhere. Send word to [[Grand Magister Rommath|Rommath]]. Have the magisters make haste to the Suncrown Tree.}}
