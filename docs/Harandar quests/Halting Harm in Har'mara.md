==Objectives==
Slay 8 Lightbloom Rutaani.
*Lightbloom Rutaani slain (8)

==Description==
Lightbloom infected rutaani are attacking the village! [[Rizam]] and [[Teetem]] both succumbed to the infection. It looks like [[Eonka]] hasn't been affected, but we must handle the others.

I will stay here and keep an eye on her. I need you to do what you can to protect Har'mara. Take out Rizam and Teetem as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Tough, but needed work. May this slow the spread until we can find a way to stop it entirely.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both '''Halting Harm in Har'mara''' & [[Culling the Spread]]

:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|If these blooms take root, Har'mara will be destroyed!}}

Throughout the village, slay the [[Lightbloom Grovewarden]]s and [[Lightbloom Sap Weaver]]s.

Return to Orweyna and Halduron.
