==Objectives==
Gather 8 clumps of Verdant Stalker Sludge.
*[[Verdant Stalker Sludge]] (8)

==Description==
If we ever want those fires to be out for good, or to see new growth, [[Teldrassil]]'s roots needs a great deal of special attention.

The source of the stream is one of the great roots. The water carries ash, which I believe still contains the tree's essence.

The stalkers in the stream carry a mixture of that ash and slime from their tendrils--a very potent mixture.

Bring me as much of it as you can carry. and I will combine it with reagents I've gathered. Then we'll be ready to apply it to the roots.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the rejuvenating mud I asked for?

==Completion==
This will do nicely, for today. One moment while I mix it with these reagents.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|My hope is we may be able to help restore what life is in the roots.}}
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Sometimes hope is all we have.}}

Slay the [[Wandering Stalker]]s and loot the Verdant Stalker Sludges. Once 8 were collected, head back to Hagar.
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Thank you for helping me in this, <name>.}}

Hagar has one additional gossip,
{{dialogue|
{{Gossip|Where were you when Teldrassil was [[War of the Thorns|attacked]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I was at the [[Den (Harandar)|Den]] with the other Rootwardens when...

<Hagar pauses before continuing.>

Others saw the smoke and sent for me. The only light at Har' mara was from the burning roots above.

They were the last to catch fire--the tree was already gone.

Hagar has yet another gossip after completion,
{{dialogue|
{{Gossip|How do you deal with your pain?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Seeing such greatness consumed by fire... was unspeakable pain. But the pain wasn't the hardest thing. And time has dulled its edge. The hardest part for me, Weshacin, was the loss of my life's purpose. As Rootwarden, I knew what I lived for, and what I was willing to die for.

With Teldrassil gone... the void of purpose and meaning was a more difficult thing than I could have imagined. I have been able to find new purpose in helping young Haronir and others, at Har'mara, and that has kept me from being overwhelmed by grief.
