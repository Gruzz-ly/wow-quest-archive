==Objectives==
Use the Alndust to combat the [[Lightbloom]] frenzy in [[Lightbloom Lash'ra]].
*Rout the Lightbloom Frenzy (0/100%)

==Description==
[[Ruia]] has always been a zealous advocate, but this behavior is beyond the pale. The lightbloom must be affecting him, driving him to these dangerous lengths.

But we do not have to be like him. This forest need not fall to the bloom like Shaladrassil did.

The Hara'ti brought enough alndust to bolster our allies against corruption, and prevent the frenzy from spreading further. Together, you and I shall spread Aln'hara's gift across the forest. This frenzy shall advance no farther.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The haranir are always mighty. But with the Goddess gift shining upon us, we are unstoppable.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting '''The Gift of Aln'hara''' from  Orweyna & [[Light Finds a Way]] from [[Halduron Brightwing]],

Fill the bar up by slaying the [[Lightfrenzy Demolisher]]s (10%), [[Lightfrenzy Devourer]]s (5%), & the [[Lightfrenzy Spore-Pod]]s (7% or 8%)

Use the ability: {{abilities|Gift of Aln'hara|id=1238438|Direct Orweyna to empower nearby allies and temper lightbloom-infested foes.|icon=spell_azerite_essence_18|range=60}}

Once the bar is filled to 100% return to Orweyna & Halduron and turn in both quests.
