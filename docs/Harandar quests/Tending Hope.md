==Objectives==
Apply Hagar's salve to 12 Withered Roots.
*Hagar's salve applied (12)

==Description==
I've used that sludge to prepare a salve for [[Teldrassil]], <name>. Now we must spread it over the roots here.

It may take years, to see a difference, if ever. But... even though I failed. I've still made oaths to her, and I can still choose to keep them. I will never stop doing what I can to... perhaps help her to grow again.

Even if I do not succeed, perhaps the next Rootwarden, or the one who comes after that, will be the one to finish this work. Even so, I shall not stop trying.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Band of the Former Rootwarden]]
* [[Ring of Hope Preserved]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, Weshacin, for your help.

Because of you, I was able to keep up my routines even with those fires.

Perhaps one day, we might see a sprout--even if it takes many years.

And I shall be ever ready to resume my duties as Rootwarden, should hope bloom.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|I do not know what losses you have experienced, or what pain you carry.}}

Across the ring, apply the salve to the [[Withered Root Segment]]s

Upon Applying the salve to 4 Withered Root Segments,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Being Rootwarden was the proudest part of my life, my greatest joy.}}

Upon Applying the salve to 8 Withered Root Segments,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|I will always wish I had known of the [[War of the Thorns|threat]] to Teldrassil, and acted differently.}}

Upon Applying the salve to 12 Withered Root Segments,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|But I will never give up hope that, through my work, it may be restored one day.}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|<name>, I cannot know if any of this may lead to the growth I hope for, or if any part Teldrassil is still alive, or could be again.}}
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|But today, you've at least helped me to keep my hope alive. And that, in itself, is meaningful.}}
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|I remain grateful for your help, <name>. I will continue my daily work here, to see what, if anything, is possible.}}

Hagar has one last gossip,
{{dialogue|
{{gossip|How do you find hope each day?}}
{{dialogue-child|There are days I feel--or even hope--Teldrassil will one day grow again, Weshacin. They are not often. Most days, I have no way to know. No reason to hope.

My only certainty is, if I give up. Teldrassil will only exist in my fading memories and dreams. I can't...

So I work for hope, even on the days I feel none.

{{gossip|1 had another question.}}
