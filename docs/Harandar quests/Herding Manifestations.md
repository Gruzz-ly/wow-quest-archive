==Objectives==
Place 3 wards around the Rift of Aln.
*[[Ward of the Shul'ka|Wards]] placed (3)

==Description==
We are preparing to fight a giant manifestation. Let me emphasize this again. We must fight just one.

If we fight two at a time, we would have no chance of survival. Place these wards around the Rift to draw the others away. They will not last long... but we will need every advantage we can gain.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That must be enough.

:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|The manifestations pose a grave danger -- but they are also the most plentiful source of Alndust.}}

Place 3 Wards in the [[Rift of Aln]] and then meet Amarakk deeper into the Rift of Aln.
