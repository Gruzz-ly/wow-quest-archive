==Objectives==
Paint your mark on the wall of the Den.
*Apply paint
*Leave paint mark

==Description==
One thing that is very important to the haranir is our past. Some may remove their ability to hear the Goddess, but we are all connected to who came before us.

You and [[Monte Gazlowe|Gazlowe]] are a part of our history now. You have earned the right to leave your mark here in the Den, for as long as the Den remains.

Go, touch the wall with your painted hand, and know that you touch the same stone as generations before you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Nahuut's Second-Favorite Chew Toy]]
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
There. Now you are part of Harandar.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Paint Bowl]] and place the mark on the wall.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Your mark is painted alongside the marks left by those who came generations before. You are now a part of Harandar.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Thanks, Orweyna. It's a real honor, truly. Thanks for letting me - letting us - in.}}

Monte Gazlowe has a gossip after completion,
{{Dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|Seeing where Orweyna comes from, a lot of things suddenly make sense. I know how it feels to want to get out of a place, and then end up right where you started from.

It means a lot to me to be here.}}
