==Objectives==
Check on Eonka.
*[[Eonka]] questioned again
*Give the seed to [[Halduron Brightwing|Halduron]]

==Description==
The situation is stabilizing, but let's make sure we're in the clear. I will see how Hagar is faring.

Check on [[Eonka]] again and be sure that she's not showing any signs of lightbloom. She is on an upper level in Hagar's Hut.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Eonka and her seeds are not effected by the lightbloom. Incredible! Could there be something about the Rift that keeps the lightbloom in check?.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The infested rutaani spread the Lightbloom! Where is Eonka?}}
:''Orweyna & Halduron Brightwing head back into the hut.''

Head to the upperfloor and ask Eonka.
{{dialogue|You have culled much foul growth. Those weeds from Har'athir feed the ground now.

This one hopes the fighting has ended.

{{gossip|quest=|Are you still feeling well?}}

{{gossip|You aren't from Har'athir?}}
{{dialogue-child|This one blossomed in the Blooming Terrace, but has been gathering seeds in the [[Rift of Aln]].

Har'athor is not near our gardens or the Rift.

{{gossip|I want to ask something else.}}

:{{Text|Say|Eonka|Kin's bloom changed. This one's did not.}}
:{{Text|Say|Eonka|Take seed. Show others. May reveal answer.}}

Go downstairs and give the egg to Halduron.
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|This seed... It's coated in--}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Alndust. Perhaps that is what shielded Eonka from the Lightbloom.}}

Halduron has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|The spread of the lightbloom was so sudden. Did your questioning of the merchants spur it? Did it feel threatened? Does it feel?

There are many questions, but I feel we are growing closer to finding the answers.}}

So does [[Hagar]]:
{{dialogue|I have had to bear so much loss. First the great tree, and now [[Koozat]] and those the merchants infected.

I am glad Orweyna has returned, at least. Though I suspect the goddess will call her away again soon.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Alndust... The Elders will not part with it easily. Still, we have to try.}}
