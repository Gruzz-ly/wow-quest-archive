==Objectives==
Collect 10 corrupted bones from Lightbloom-infested wildlife.
*[[Lightbleached Rootbone]] (10)

==Description==
Simply culling these creatures is not sufficient. If their bodies are left unattended, the light will seep from their remains and spread through the soil to the surrounding foliage.

We must take more drastic measures. Gather the bones of the creatures you slay. If we burn them, perhaps we can prevent their further spread through the roots of this forest.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Rootbone Choker]]
*[[Light-Bleached Amulet]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do not delay. The longer we wait to cull this growth, the more of this forest the Sin'dorei will lose.

==Completion==
It is a shame to see something born of Harandar to wreak such havoc on a place like this. These roots may not cradle Aln'hara, but they grow towards her all the same.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[Stem the Tides]] from [[Halduron Brightwing]] & '''Cull and Burn''' from Orweyna,
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|We used the last of the Alndust we gathered. What do you intend to do, Halduron?}}
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|Whatever I must.}}

Across [[Lightbloom Lash'Ra]], slay yhe [[Invasive Shinesipper]]s, [[Lightmad Saptor]]s, [[Lash'ra Thornguard]]s, & [[Lash'ra Mistcaller]s and loot the Lightbleached Rootbones from them. Then return to Orweyna & Halduron and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|This is getting us nowhere. Send word to [[Grand Magister Rommath|Rommath]]. Have the magisters make haste to the Suncrown Tree.}}
