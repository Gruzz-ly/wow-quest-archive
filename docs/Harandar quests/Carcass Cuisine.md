==Objectives==
Defeat the Sporeglider Bloomterror in [[Harandar]].
* [[Sporeglider Bloomterror]] slain
* [[Corpse Rind]]

==Description==
The [[Fungarian]]s are caretakers of [[decay]], transforming [[death]] into [[life]]'s renewal.

They require a [[sporeglider]] carcass to sustain their vast community. There is one--larger than most--that has taken to warding off the root drifters we need to sustain our village.

Its end will feed many, and ease our burden. Balance, in more ways than one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,200 [[XP]]
