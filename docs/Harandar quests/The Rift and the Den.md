==Objectives==
Ride [[Petalvane]] to the Den.
*[[Petalvane]] ridden (Optional)
*Follow Orweyna to the Den

==Description==
As I suspected, the Elders are quite upset with my actions. Now that I have seen the children and [[Ku'paal]] to safety, I am ready to face the Council.

I will do what I can to make them see that the Lightbloom is a threat, and to enable your ability to move freely through Harandar.

Petalvane will carry you safely to the Den. Let us make haste.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Tread carefully, <name>. The Haranir are formidable and on edge over our arrival.

The council has convened and is ready to hear Orweyna's words. Hopefully she will be able to convince them that the Lightbloom is a threat and that their help is needed.

==Notes==

After arriving at the [[Vale of Mists]], speak to Halduron and turn in.
