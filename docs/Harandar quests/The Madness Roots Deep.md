==Objectives==
{{questportrait|On'hiea.jpg|On'hiea|Perhaps On'hiea was looking for the same thing as Orweyna, but he's succumbed to the Rift of Aln.}}
Defeat On'hiea at the [[Rift of Aln]].
*[[On'hiea]] subdued

==Description==
I found you while I was in the middle of one of my duties. Someone has spent too long within the Rift and has fallen prey to the call of the Goddess. I must rescue him and send him back to where he belongs.

Help me with this task, and I will help you.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Robe of the Alndust-Addled]]
*[[On'heia's Dusty Jerkin]]
*[[Riftwalker's Cuirass]]
*[[Alndust-Coated Carapace]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Another soul saved.

This is why I do this, <name>. All my sacrifices, shutting myself from the voice of the Goddess, is worth it for each soul I rescue from the grasp of the Rift.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Yell|On'hiea|GONE. STOLEN! Where has she gone?}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|On'hiea? Please!}}

Go and find On'heia who is in the waterfall.
:{{Text|Say|On'hiea|YOU! You took her. Stole her away! I'll kill you all!!}}

Upon subduing On'hiea, Amarakk & Orweyna appear.
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|He is not fully lost. But he must be removed from the Rift immediately.}}
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|Alndust's power is of the goddess herself. If it can help your cause, Orweyna, then I will help you gather it.}}
