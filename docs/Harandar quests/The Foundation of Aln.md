==Objectives==
Collect 6 alndust from Rift creatures in the Vale of Mists.
*[[Diminished Alndust]] (6)

==Description==
The presence of the Goddess reverberates through everything in the Rift of Aln. The voice is too powerful for Haranir to resist. In mere minutes, one of our flock would be lost forever.

There are, however, ways to protect oneself for a short time. Kill the rejects that crawl up from the Rift and gather the alndust from which they are created. I can show Orweyna how to craft a short term solution for entering the Rift.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will let your young companion know what to do with the alndust.

==Completion==
My hands tingle where the aindust touches. A curious feeling... not unwelcome.

The honored [[Shul'ka]] told me how to manipulate the alndust to protect Haranir in the Rift. It seemed difficult, but with its magic swelling in me, I feel that it should be doable.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both '''Consequences of Our Duty''' & [[The Foundation of Aln]]
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|If you insist on doing this, then you need to protect your mind and spirit with the Alndust.}}
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|Find me once you are prepared. And [[Orweyna]]... Be careful.}}
:''Amarakk disappears''

Slay the [[Blighted Rift Spirit]]s and [[Rift Shade]]s to loot the Diminished Alndust.

Afterward, return to Orweyna.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I'm ready to perform the Shul'ka's ritual. It will protect us when we enter the Rift of Aln.. for a time}}
