==Objectives==
Help Orweyna create the Alndust Filter at the Vale of Mists.
*Alndust placed

==Description==
[[Amarakk]] told me how to prepare alndust to create the salve. In small doses. Alndust can strengthen the mind against madness and terror. It offers clarity and peace but only if expertly employed.

I could use your help to set an anchor to this place, <name>. The ritual is delicate, and failure could be disastrous.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|11|55}}
*6,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I cannot hear the voice of the Goddess.

I hate it.

How does Amarakk live like this?

==Notes==
Place the [[Dimisished Alndust]] and Orweyna has been affected.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Her voice is gone. I have never felt so alone. Is this Amarakk's life?}}
