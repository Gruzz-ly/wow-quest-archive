==Objectives==
Speak to Aksem in the Cradle.

==Description==
This time, I do not have a story for you.

Instead, Aksem has asked that you meet with him to help recover the next of the relics. Go to speak with him, and he will tell you more of what you must do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|41}}
*15,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Good. You return.

Something important has been stolen, and I wish for you to retrieve and return it to Kassameh. Are you ready?

==Notes==
Head into a hut and speak with Aksem.
