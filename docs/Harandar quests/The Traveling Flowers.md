==Objectives==
Talk to the visiting rutaani merchants.
*[[Rizam]] questioned
*[[Teetem]] questioned
*[[Eonka]] questioned
*[[Keem]] questioned

==Description==
Orweyna mentioned that there are rutaani who are visiting from other villages. This is an opportunity for us to get to know what they're like when they're not light-crazed.

I will stay here to speak with Meeka. You should speak with the visiting rutaani to determine whether the lightbloom has reached their homes.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|17|55}}
* 9,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So there are no signs of lightbloom yet in their villages? Meeka seems unchanged as well, and states that the rutaani never act in the manner of the light-crazed.

This is both promising and frustrating.

I am glad that it hasn't yet spread that far, but I suspect we shall find more soon.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|It is strange to see friendly rutaani.}}

Make sure you accept [[Tending to Har'mara]] from [[Hagar]].
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Most rutaani are very territorial. This is one of the few places we interact with them in peace.}}

Head to Rizam and speak with him.
{{dialogue|This one has wares, if the stranger has things to trade.

{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Rizam. This one is here from Har'alnor to trade.

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|quest=|<Ask if they have lightbloom in their village.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|This one has seen many blooms. To bloom is good, yes?

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}
}}

Head to Teetem and speak with him.
{{dialogue|Does the stranger come to trade with this one?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Ask if they have lightbloom in their village.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|No Light-bloom. This stranger should offer trade or leave.

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|This one is called Teetem, here from Har'alnor to trade.

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}
}}

Head to Eonka and speak with him.
{{dialogue|Does the stranger come to trade with this one?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Ask if they have lightbloom in their village.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|This one has not seen this light-bloom. But the Rift protects us, always.

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Eonka, grown in the [[Blooming Terrace]]. Trading seeds from the [[Rift of Aln]] is why this one is here.

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}
}}

Head to Keem who is with a sleeping [[Koozat]] and speak with him.
{{dialogue|Why does a stranger disturb this one?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Ask if they have lightbloom in their village.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|All rutaani bloom in the light. Only the spore-kin bloom in the dark.

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|This one is Keem, of the Har'alnor crop.

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|What are you doing?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The long journey has left this one a bit wilted.

Time spent admiring the petal formations on this creature is proving to be rejuvenating.

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}
}}

Return to the hut after you're done.
:{{Text|Say|Meeka|No, this one has not seen rutaani behaving that way.}}

Upon completion,
:''[[Powercap]] appears''
:{{Text|Say|Powercap|Koozat's gone berzerk!}}
:''Powercap runs out.''
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|The lumbering beast outside? It seemed so docile.. This reeks of foul play.}}

[[Orweyna]] has a gossip:
{{dialogue|I am glad you made it through the trials, <name>. My people are very secretive, but it was good to share our history with you, friend.}}
