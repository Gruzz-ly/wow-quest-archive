==Objectives==
Collect 10 samples of Strange Mycelium from the former denizens of [[Fungara Village]].
* [[Strange Mycelium]] (10)

==Description==
When I sent a request for aid from [[Har'alnor]], I did not expect them to send me an outsider. No matter.

The denizens of Fungara Village have gone quiet. Normally, I would be thrilled; they're horribly screechy. But the way they are shambling about... It is like they have forgotten that they yet live.

<Ghikal shudders.>

I tried to get close, but they attacked me on sight.

I will need samples of their flesh. Go and bring them to me, so I can see what has happened here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]
