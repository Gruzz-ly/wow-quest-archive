==Objectives==
Collect 6 Nutrient-rich soil in [[Harandar]].
* [[Nutrient Rich Soil]]

==Description==
This meal is more than tradition, it is a promise.

The [[Haranir]], [[Rutaani]], and [[Fungarian]]s share no love, but in [[Har'mara]] they share this table. To honor that pact, each must be fed in their own way. That is what this meal means.

For the Rutaani, they will need nutrient-rich soil as they draw sustenance through their roots. A few bags of it should do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
