==Objectives==
Speak to the Innkeeper, Renown Quartermaster, and the Flight Master at the Den.
*Speak to the [[Yinaa|Innkeeper]]
*Speak to the [[Naynar|Quartermaster]]
*Speak to the [[Doecha|Flight Master]]
*Speak to [[Ku'paal]]

==Description==
Finally, we have a moment to breathe. This is where we feel closest to the Goddess; we are below the Cradle where she used to rest.

The Elders will not allow us to use any of the Alndust they have gathered over the centuries. They see only what the goddess asked of us before, not what her world needs now.

Alndust is rare, but there are ways to get it. Ask around. I will check... elsewhere.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope that you will be able to rest here. You must know how to navigate this place.

==Completion==
In the end, we must figure this out for ourselves.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The Elders will not sacrifice any of the Alndust. We must find another way.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Ask around the Den. Glean what wisdom you can.}}
:''Orweyna runs off.''

Go to Yinaa and speak with him.
{{dialogue|Welcome, stranger. Find comfort here.

{{Gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the Rift of Aln?}}

:{{Text|Say|Yinaa|Our traditions exist for a reason. They protect us and this land. It is not for the young to question.}}

Go to Naynar and speak with him.
{{dialogue|I appreciate all the help you've given our people.

{{Gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the Rift of Aln?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The honored Rootwarden here can tell you more.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Ruia|You would have us spare Alndust for the sake of outsiders? Absurd!}}
:{{Text|Say|Ruia|She of all people knows the cost to gather it. If she wants to waste it, then she can brave the Rift for it herself.}}
:{{Text|Say|Naynar|Our traditions exist for a reason. They protect us and this land. It is not for the young to question.}}

Go to Doecha and speak with her.
{{dialogue|Where would you like to fly?

{{Gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the Rift of Aln?}}

:{{Text|Say|Doecha|I wish to help Orweyna, but she will not want to go where she must go.}}

Head to Orweyna who is speaking with Ku'paal
:{{Text|Say|Ku'paal|I am sorry for the trouble I caused you, Orweyna, but you understand the position I was in. Now I hear that you wish to go where no haranir is meant to go.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ku'paal|Orweyna, I beg you. You know where Alndust falls.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ku'paal|Those who walk the Rift without guidance risk being forever lost.}}

Speak with Ku'paal
{{dialogue|Hagar may no longer be a Rootwarden. but she holds wisdom beyond measure. I believe she would not lead Orweyna astray.

{{Gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the Rift of Aln?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Ku'paal|When the Goddess was torn from her Cradle, the violence left wounds that will not heal.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ku'paal|Her screams of anguish give life to formless terrors and drive those who enter mad.}}

Orweyna has a gossip after completion:
{{dialogue|I believe we are doing the right thing. We will see this through to the end, no matter the risk.}}
