Complete the third trial at the Den of Echoes.
*Third visionstone activated

==Description==
When the haranir began to grow restless, they looked to new sources of purpose. Some cast their gazes upwards, towards the stars and the moon. Others, such as the Hara'ti, heard a call from deep within the world.

The moment the the first of the Hara'ti heard the Song echoing from the roots, we knew that we had found a new purpose. We would seek out the source of the Song, and discover the truth of it for ourselves.

But it would be a difficult road. Strange stone monsters sought to block our path.

==Progress==

==Completion==
Now you know how the [[Hara'ti]] came to walk amongst the roots.

One final trial remains. The most difficult, but most important, of them all.
