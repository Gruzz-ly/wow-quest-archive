==Objectives==
Use the Greater Alndust on the [[ruutani]] at [[Har'alnor]].
*Alndust used on the afflicted rutaani.

==Description==
The ruutani have escaped their nearby villages to Har'alnor. The guards have told me that some of them have been afflicted with the lightbloom, yet have not succumbed to its effects. This may be our best opportunity to test the alndust's powers. Time is of the essence!

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The alndust may not be able to recover someone who has fully fallen to the lightbloom, but it should be able to inoculate those from further corruption.

That must be enough.

==Notes==
;Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|[[Byarc]]|This one has lost many to this light-bloom. If these ones offer hope, then this one shall listen.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|With Aln'hara's grace, the Alndust will protect these Rutaani as it did [[Eonka]].}}
:''Byarc, Orweyna, and [[Hannan]] departs.''

Go into the cave and meet up with the party who are with an [[Afflicted Rutaani]].
:{{Text|Say|Afflicted Rutaani|The Light... BURNS...}}

Go near the Rutaani and heal it,
:{{Text|Say|Afflicted Rutaani|This one awakens. This one changes no more.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|It works! At last, we have a way to fight back.}}
:''The Rutaani departs.''

==Progression==
