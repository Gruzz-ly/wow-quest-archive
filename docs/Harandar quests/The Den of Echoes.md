==Objectives==
Meet Hagar at the Den of Echoes.

==Description==
Greetings, stranger. I am Elder Hagar. You have been granted permission to stay, as long as you pass through the trials of the Den of Echoes.

Aln'hara will determine your fate, and you will learn about our people and customs.

Let us meet at the caves.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to the Den of Echoes. Within the caves beyond you will find ancient paintings which tell the story of the Harandir.{{Sic}}

Perhaps you will learn something, if you survive. May [[Aln'hara]] be on your side.

==Notes==
;Upon Accept,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|The elders have spoken. They hope that reliving the past will show you the folly of your actions.}}
:''Hagar, [[Orweyna]], and [[Halduron Brightwing]] departs for the Den of Echoes.''


Upon arriving at the Den of Echoes.
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|I understand the threat of the Lightbloom, but we need to appease the elders or you will have two enemies in Harandar.}}

Hagar has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|If you truly have heard the song of the goddess, you should do fine during the trials. Perhaps she has called you as she did with Orweyna.

{{gossip|Who are you?}}
{{dialogue-child|I am Hagar, Elder and former Rootwarden. I am here to witness your efforts in the challenge, and to report back whether or not you succeed.

{{gossip|I'd like to ask something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|You seem more open to collaborating with us than the rest of your people.}}
{{Dialogue|I was the Rootwarden for [[Teldrassil]]. My duties were terminated with the [[War of the Thorns|destruction of the great world tree]].

We haranir have lived secluded for an eternity, but we can afford no longer to think that we can remain this way.

The roots are but a part of the tree. A true warden needs to be able to protect and care for the entire tree, even if the roots are their focus.

I will always wonder if there would have been something I could have done to stop the destruction. My willingness to hear you out was born in the fires that destroyed the great tree.

{{Gossip|I'd like to ask something else.}}}}
}}

So does Halduron Brightwing:
{{Dialogue|The paintings within the cave look massive. Can it be true that they hold the memories of the Haranir people?}}

Especially Orweyna,
{{Dialogue|If you can gain the goddess' approval, it will show them that others outside of our realm can be called by her. This will hopefully make them understand that you're here to help... and that we need their help as well.

My people can no longer hide away beneath the roots. What's bad for the tree is bad for the root. We can no longer ignore the surface world.}}
