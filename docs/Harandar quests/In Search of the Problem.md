==Objectives==
Meet Orweyna at [[Har'alnor]].

==Description==
We did what Hagar asked of us to do. The next step will be to test this on something--or someone--afflicted with the lightbloom.

It may be difficult to find the lightbloom in enough quantities in Harandar, but I believe we will find what we need at Har'alnor. I will meet you there!

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We have left our homes. We will return.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Thank you [[Amarakk]]. I owe you more than I can say.}}

Go to [[Har'alnor]] and meet up with Orewyna who was speaking to [[Hannan]].
:{{Text|Say|Hannan|It came from above. Within a few days, it overtook all of [[Shaladrassil]].}}

Hannan has a gossip:
{{dialogue|I arrived at Har'alnor shortly before you. There is clearly a huge problem here. We have a lot of work to do if we are to ease the suffering of those around us.

How did it get like this?}}
