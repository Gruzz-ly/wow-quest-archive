==Objectives==
Protect the [[Shrine of Ages|shrine]] from local wildlife.
*Shrine protected (0/100%)

==Description==
At this shrine, I have worked to gather roots that seem to still have signs of life in them. They are each greatly damaged. some more than others. My hope is some might recover, with enough time and enough care. In that way, I honor the [[Teldrassil|great tree]]'s memory.

For that to be possible, though, we have to keep them safe from the hazards of Harandar.

Please be sure that nothing nearby threatens them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for helping to protect what may still live of Teldrassil.

It may be that nothing remains--some of these roots still smolder.

Yet I vowed to serve as Rootwarden, and I will not fail a second time, if there is any hope. I choose each day to believe there may be, that Teldrassil could bloom again.

Though I may only be preserving her memory.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|There are many hungry creatures that would like to feast on the exposed roots here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Keeping what remains of Teldrassil safe is the priority. Who knows which roots may be able to be saved?}}

Fill the bar by slaying the [[Foraging Potatoad]]s (6%), [[Insatiable Saptor]]s (8%), & a [[Voracious Thornmaw]] (16%).

After filling the bar to 100% turn in the quest to Hagar.

She has a two new gossips that are included with the previous ones after completion
{{dialogue|
{{gossip|Did you refer to Teldrassil as her?}}
{{dialogue-child|It may seem odd. But for ten years. Teldrassil was everything to me. And since [[War of the Thorns|the burning]], I have been haunted by her loss.

When your life is dedicated to one thing--especially something as great and full of life as Teldrassil--"it" does not seem like a sufficient word.


{{gossip|I had another question}}}}


{{gossip|What do you hope to achieve, with these roots?}}
{{dialogue-child|Everything possible, Weshacin--whatever that may be.

Perhaps some of these roots can be saved. Perhaps roots can grow again into a great tree. Such a tree might retain some essence of what I dedicated my life to.

Perhaps nothing except the freedom to die one day, knowing I tried all I could.
