==Objectives==
Investigate 5 Blooming Corpses in [[Fungara Village]].
*[[Blooming Corpse]]s investigated (5)

==Description==
It is obvious that something terrible has happened in the village. I can see the corpses of their largest specimens strewn across the southern reaches from here. But something is off about them, too. Fungarians don't usually just leave the corpses of their kin lying about.

And though I am watching from afar, I swear that some of them are... Twitching.

Investigate. Find out what you can, and report back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]
