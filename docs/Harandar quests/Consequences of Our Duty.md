==Objectives==
Heal 5 Wounded Guardians in the Vale of Mists.
*[[Wounded Defender (Harandar)|Wounded Defender]] helped (5)
*[[Salve of Aln]] (provided)

==Description==
I have warned Orweyna of the dangers and madness that lay within the Rift of Aln, but she believes it is her only path forward. I envy her faith.

Someone can help her show the way. The Shul'ka. The Hunters of Shadows. They have sacrificed everything to protect the haranir from the effects of the Rift.

I will let one know that you need help. You will find him in the Vale of Mists.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Amarakk's Woven Signet]]
*[[Band of Severed Connections]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is sobering to see the effects of the Rift on my peoples. But Amarakk's interference has given me unintended hope.

I must go into the Rift to search for Hagar's answer, and with the Shul'ka's help. I may even survive this ordeal.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both '''Consequences of Our Duty''' & [[The Foundation of Aln]]
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|If you insist on doing this, then you need to protect your mind and spirit with the Alndust.}}
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|Find me once you are prepared. And [[Orweyna]]... Be careful.}}
:''Amarakk disappears.''

Heal 5 Wounded Defenders using the Salve of Aln.

After doing that, return to Orweyna.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I'm ready to perform the Shul'ka's ritual. It will protect us when we enter the Rift of Aln.. for a time}}
