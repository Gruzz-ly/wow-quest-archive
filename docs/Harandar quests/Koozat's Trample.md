==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|Koozat is normally very calm, but can be quite dangerous when agitated. Be careful, <name>.}}
:''Orweyna and [[Halduron Brightwing]] departs.''

Head outside as Orweyna and Halduron along with [[Powdercap]] are facing a crisis against the Lightbloom.
:{{Text|Say|Powdercap|Dead! And Koozat not only one gone mad!}}

Upon completion, Orweyna has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Those merchants were either lying or didn't know they were infected with the lightbloom, and now they've gone on to spread it around the village.

We need to contain this outbreak before it spreads further!}}
