==Objectives==
Complete the first vision of the Den of Echoes.
*Talk to Hagar (Optional)
*Talk to Zur'ashar Kassameh
*Visionstone activated
*[[Iceberries]] collected (6)

==Description==
The history of the Haranir has been recorded for tens of thousands of years in the caves within. The memories of our people are painted on the stone, that we might never forget where we came from and what our purpose is.

You are the first outsiders to ever witness the Den of Echoes. When you touch the paintings, our ancestors will share our stories and struggles.

Zur'ashar Kassameh awaits you within. He will guide you and Halduron on your journeys. I wish you luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,365 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Our people have been here for tens of thousands of years, but it was not always so. Once, we lived on the surface as you do.

==Completion==
You have made it through the first of the trials. But the real test is yet to come.

{{gossip|What is the Den of Echoes?}}
{{Dialogue|The Den of Echoes is but one repository of my people's memories. It is through reliving the deeds and trials of our ancestors that we learn, grow, and ensure history does not repeat itself.

The paintings are a gateway into these memories and trials. If you survive, you will gain a greater understanding of Harandar and my people.

Touching the stone will activate the visions. May Aln'hara be with you.
