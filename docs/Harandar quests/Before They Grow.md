==Objectives==
Use Amarakk's Influence to kill 1 Aln Mites in the Rift of Aln.
*Use Amarakk's Influence on a Rift creature (Optional)
*Defeat alnscorned enemies in the Rift of Aln (0/100%)

==Description==
Within every creature within the Rift of Ain thrums a gathering of the foundation of the Goddess's influence. This alndust yearns to merge with others of its ilk. Part of my duties as the Shul'ka is to make sure to keep the number of large manifestations low so they do not overwhelm the Den.

It is easiest to do that while they are small.

Take this spear. You may use it to shatter the smaller creatures down to... trivial sizes.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well done.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[Herding Manifestations]], '''Before They Grow''', & [[Grinding Out a Solution]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|In the Rift's darkest depths, Alndust coalesces into the monstrosities before you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|The manifestations pose a grave danger -- but they are also the most plentiful source of Alndust.}}

Fill the bar up by slaying the [[Rift Shade]]s (5%), [[Decaying Essence]] (10%), & [[Aln Mite]]s (3%)

After filling the bar to 100%, meet back with Amarakk deeper into the Rift of Aln.
