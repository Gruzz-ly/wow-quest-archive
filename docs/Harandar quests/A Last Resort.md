==Objectives==
Overload 3 Phoenixfire Runestones.
*[[Palehill Runestone]]
*[[Lakegrove Runestone]]
*[[Barksnarl Runestone]]

==Description==
With our ground forces pulled back, our position will be overwhelmed in a matter of minutes. It's time to execute our gambit.

Rommath and the Magisters have provided us a mana gem that can be used to overload Lash'ra's runestones. Take it. and infuse the stones with the mana contained therein. That will set the stage for the Magisters' ritual -- to detonate the runestones and burn the entirety of Lash'ra to the ground.

We just have to hope the Lightbloom cannot survive in an inferno.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We've done all we can.

Now all that's left is to defend the Magisters, and hope that this is enough to stop the frenzy from spreading any further.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both [[Expeditious Retreat]] & '''A Last Resort''',
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|If you detonate your runestones, your forests will burn.}}
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|We have rebuilt from ashes before. Without any Alndust, what other recourse do we have?}}
:''The Party splits up.''

Head to the Southwest and activate the Palehill Runestone, head up north and activate the Lakegrove runestone. And finally Head up and activate the Barksnarl Runestone.

Meet back up with Halduron & Orweyna at the [[Suncrown Tree]] with [[Grand Magister Rommath]] and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|The Lightbloom has reached the river. Light of the sun preserve us. We are out of time.}}

Rommath has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Well, this is a fine mess you all have made.}}

So too does Orweyna,
{{Dialogue|The council has rejected our call. The Hara'ti do not stand against the Lightbloom.

But I do. And I will. With what Alndust I have, we will ward off what influence we can.}}
