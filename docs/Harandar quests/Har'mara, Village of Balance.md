==Objectives==
Return to [[Hagar]] in [[Har'kuai]].

==Description==
Ah! The outsider who saved [[Har'mara]]. Word travels fast through [[Aln'hara]]'s roots. No doubt Elder Hagar was grateful for your aid.

She would never admit it, but things have been difficult since the roots above her village burned. The [[rutaani]] and [[fungarian]]s each grow bolder in their eccentricities. And the lingering flare-ups on [[Teldrassil]]'s roots present a constant threat.

If your travels afford another trip to Har'mara, I do not doubt she would benefit from additional help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah! <Name>. Welcome back. As you can see, our hands are full as ever, here.

I assure you, I have things well in hand. But if you do wish to explore a bit further afield, I am sure some of the others could benefit from your assistance.

==Notes==
Go the Har'mara and go to [[Hagar]].
