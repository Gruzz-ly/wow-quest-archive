==Objectives==
Speak to Aksem in the Crade.

==Description==
Now that you've learned about our legends, you've earned the notice of one of our elders. He wants to meet you.

His name is Aksem, and he knows things that the rest of us have never learned. History that remains hidden, even in the paintings.

Go, introduce yourself. He's expecting you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Yes, I wanted to speak with you.

There are many truths that are hidden, even to the oldest living haranir. Continue to learn and they may be revealed.

Show respect to our history, and I will eventually tell you more.

==Notes==
Head into a hut and speak with Aksem.

Upon completion,

:{{Text|Say|Aksem|Her memories have been shared with me, and I share them only with those who understand their importance.}}
:{{Text|Say|Aksem|Continue to learn about the haranir and our history. I am interested to see if you, and perhaps another, are worthy of those memories.}}
