==Objectives==
Slay the visiting rutaani merchants and Koozat.
*[[Koozat]] slain
*[[Keem]] slain
*[[Rizam]] slain
*[[Teetem]] slain

==Description==
{{questportrait|Koozat.png|Koozat|Near mad with Lightbloom. Koozat's eyes scan for movement. He is intent on trampling any and all in his path.}}
Powdercap said that the visiting travelers were the first to show signs of the lightbloom infection. Right after you questioned them!

Sadly, it seems Koozat has also fallen to the sickness. Take out out the merchants and see to Koozat as well. He's far too dangerous a creature to be trampling around here.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Traveling Merchant's Mantle]]
* [[Light-Blanched Shoulderpads]]
* [[Light-Crazed Rutaani's Shoulderguards]]
* [[Keem's Blooming Pauldrons]]

You will also receive: 
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is done, then. I grieve that this was necessary, but the corruption needed to be pruned before it could spread further.
