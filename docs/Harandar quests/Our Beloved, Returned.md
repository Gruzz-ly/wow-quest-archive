==Objectives==
Recover 6 Haranir artifacts in the Blinding Bloom.
*[[Haranir Artifacts|Artifacts]] recovered (6)

==Description==
The haranir had a presence by the roots of [[Shaladrassil]], as a sign of goodwill with the cultures that live within our home. When the guards retreated, they left some of our treasured mementos and artifacts.

Since the spread of the lightbloom has been greater than I ever expected, I do not know when we'll be able to come back. Let's find those artifacts in the Blinding Bloom and bring them home.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It would be good to bring some of these items back in our hands.

==Completion==
These artifacts pale in importance to the lives of those involved here... but it is good to have them back.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[At the Root]], '''Our Beloved, Returned''', & [[Righteous Pruning]]
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The madness has overtaken the roots. We must stop it here.}}

Open 6 [[Haranir Heirlooms]] that are in the [[Blinding Bloom]] and loot the Haranir Artifacts.

Then return to Orweyna and turn in the quests.
