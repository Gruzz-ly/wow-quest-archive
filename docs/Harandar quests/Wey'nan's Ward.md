Return to me with the wisdom you uncover.

An incredible tale, worthy of preservation. I will set it into paint, ensuring it lives forever within the echoes of our people. Accept this memento--a token of my gratitude for your efforts.

For now, I will continue to go through our archives, seeking relics that cry out for understanding.

Return to me when the world has whispered more secrets to you.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Go. Place your hand upon the stone and offer your soul to memory. What greets you may not be kind... but it will be true.}}

Head to the [[Vale of Secrets]] and interact with the Ancient Visionstone.

===Stage One: The Great Calamity===
:''Assist the haranir as they battle against unknown attackers.''
*Zaratti forces slain (6)

:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|When the Haranir first walked this land, they met no welcome--only fangs and fury, as creatures struck with deliberate, unseen intent.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Battle was joined, tooth and claw against vine and thorn... but in that frenzy, they teetered on the abyss of madness.}}

Slay the [[Zaratti Fanatic]]s & the [[Zaratti Bloombinder]]s.

Upon observing the Rancidbloom Potatoad,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Some creatures became consumed with gluttony, in order to fill the void created from her departure.}}

Upon observing the Whispering Petalwing,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Some creatures still sang in harmony with her.}}

Upon observing the Auralight Moth,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|The creatures remembered where she had been.}}

Upon observing the Rutaani Sapling,
:{{Text|Emote|The Rutaani does not react to your presence, it continues to sit silently.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Some creatures forgot her song and listened only to the silence that followed.}}

===Stage Two: The Hunt===
:''Wey'nan has vowed to track down the creature "Zarat" that attacked his people.''
*Follow [[Wey'nan ]]'s trail.

:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Wey'nan saw the point from which his people were struck. Thus, the hunted became the hunter, drawn to the silent cave where truth lay hidden.}}

Follow Wey'nan and be careful of the [[Zaratti Scryer]]s.
:{{Text|Emote|Zaratti Scryer sniffs the air...}}
:{{Text|Emote|Zaratti Scryer looks around, sensing something is amiss..}}

Head to the [[Resonance Stone]] and attune with it.

===Stage Three: The Aftermath of Battle===
:''Wey'nan has won in his battle with Zarat, but he also has been gripped by an all-consuming fury. The scents of the mushrooms in the cavern will help him calm down.''
*[[Fragrant Mushroom Cap]]

:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|The beast lay broken alongside Wey'nan's fallen kin. Had they fallen to its claws or his own? Rage numbed him until the scent of home pulled him back from the abyss.}}

Obtain the Fragrant Mushroom Cap.

===Stage Four: Clear Your Head===
:''Calm Wey'nan down from his rage.''
*[[Wey'nan]] calmed.

Calm Wey'nan
:{{Text|Say|Wey'nan|No... The rage took hold... consumed me. I won't... can't... let it happen again.}}

===Stage Five: Collecting the Parts===
:''Wey'nan wants to create a memento of the battle--a reminder that succumbing to rage is a terrible thing.''
*[[Zarat's Head]]

:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|A lesson unmarked is a lesson soon forgotten. So Wey'nan took the remains of his foe in order to make a charm of remembrance.}}

Collect Zarat's head from [[Zarat]].

===Stage Six: Collecting the Parts===
:''Wey'nan regrets the primal rage that overtook him. He wants your help in creating a memento to remind the haranir not to give in to their rage.''
:''Wey'nan's Ward crafted
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Clutching his foe's remains, Wey'nan led his allies to a magical dust-filled cavern. There, the remnants were bound into a charm--balance held in both hand and heart.}}

Follow Wey'nan and begin creating the staff.
:{{Text|Say|Wey'nan|Help me fill these containers with just the right portions of this magical dust.

Add a little at a time to each vial till you reach the mark I put on the containers. Once you have the containers filled, let me know and I'll finish crafting the ward.

Move quickly--the dust begins to dissolve as soon as it is poured!}}

Fill the [[Powder Bottle]]s wit the Abilities:
#{{Abilities|Add a little - Left}}

Upon having the Powder Bottles are at the green tip,
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|And so the charm was made: a warning, a reminder. We must be more than instinct.}}

Head back to the [[Reliquary of the Zur'Ashari]] and turn in.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Zur'ashar Kassameh|Now I understand. You've returned to us not just the tale of a relic... but reminded us of Wey'nan's lesson. Thank you!}}
