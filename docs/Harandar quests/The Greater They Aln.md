==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lured Manifestation.jpg|Lured Manifestation|A dream that never fully coalesced, filled with the power of the Rift of Aln.}}
Defeat the Aln Manifestation and gather its components in the Rift of Aln.
*[[Lured Manifestation]] slain
*Greater Alndust gathered
*[[Greater Alndust]] (Optional)

==Description==
We have one chance at this only.

I pray we have prepared enough.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Tangle of Vibrant Vines]]
*[[Aln-Bound Essence]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The power of the Rift of Aln is beyond mortal comprehension. What we are doing is to simply borrow some of it for a brief moment.

==Completion==
I thought I would never see this with my own eyes.... and yet here we are.

Make this worth it.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|These will give us a fighting chance to take down a manifestation.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Could we not gather dust from easier prey?}}
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|Even average-sized manifestations offer very little Alndust. You would be hunting for years just to gather a thimble's worth.}}

;Upon slaying the Lured Manifestation
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|Grab the alndust now, <name>. Be swift.}}

Gather the [[Greater Alndust]] and turn in to Amarakk.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Amarakk|Alndust bolsters our people's power over nature. It should be enough to counteract the Lightbloom's rapid growth.}}

==Progression==
