==Objectives==
Give alndust to 5 haranir around [[Har'alnor]] and the [[Blinding Bloom]].
*Haranir innoculated (5)
*Talk to [[Hannan]] at the [[Blinding Bloom]]

==Description==
We can now go to the roots of [[Shaladrassil]] and stop the lightbloom spreading even further into Harandar.

We have enough alndust to innoculate any haranir who are willing to risk their lives to follow us into battle. Find them. <Name>, and give them the alndust.

You will receive one of:
*[[Rallied Haranir's Mitts]]
*[[Alndust-Touched Gloves]]
*[[Hopeful Haranir's Grasps]]
*[[Gauntlets of the Innoculated]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I know that my peoples are ready to step up to the challenge.

==Completion==
This is so much more than what the Rootwarden said. How has the lightbloom spread so much, so quickly?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Distribute the alndust to the warriors here. It will empower them to strike back against the Lightbloom.}}
:''[[Byarc]], Orweyna, and Hannan departs.''

Throughout the village, go the [[Eager Volunteer (haranir)|Eager Volunteer]]s and speak to them.
;The Eager Volunteer near the tent and the other near the entrance of the cave and the other one at the pathway
{{dialogue|I would hate to be driven from my home. like these poor rutaani. I want to help them out.

;The Eager Volunteer who is eating

{{dialogue|Orweyna has more believers in her than she thinks. I would follow her anywhere.

{{gossip|quest=|This alndust will protect you from the Lightbloom so we can fight them.}}

Once that is done go to Hannan and speak to him:
