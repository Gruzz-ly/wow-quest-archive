==Objectives==
Slay 3 Lightfrenzy Tyrannosaptors in Lightbloom Lash'ra.
*[[Lightfrenzy Tyrannosaptor]] slain (3)

==Description==
I am an expert in the fauna of Eversong. and I can say with certainty that the vast majority of the wildlife here tend to be of fairly average size.

But these Light-frenzied saptors are decidedly, unequivocally not. One bite from those thorny jaws could claim the lives of a half-dozen Farstriders, if they are caught unawares.

My rangers have their quivers full culling the chaff alongside the Haranir. See to it that those towering tyrannosaptors don't catch them unawares.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Between you and our new haranir allies, my rangers have plenty of ferocious examples to follow. I'll have to consider teaching some of your techniques at the Retreat.

==Notes and trivia==
;Upon accepting [[The Gift of Aln'hara]] from  [[Orweyna]] & '''Light Finds a Way''' from Halduron Brightwing,
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|Stop the ritual! To arms! Eversong need not burn today!}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Aln'hara's blessing empowers us. Today, we fight for all of her creation!}}

Across the [[Lightbloom Lash'Ra]] slay 3 Lightfrenzy Tyrannosaptors.

Once that is done, return to Orweyna & Halduron and turn in both quests.

The name of the quest may be a reference to the phrase: ''Life Finds a Way.'' from the movie {{Wp|Jurassic Park}}.
