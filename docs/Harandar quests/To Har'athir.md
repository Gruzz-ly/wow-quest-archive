Upon stopping near Ku'paal who is kneeling before a dead Potadpole.
:{{Text|Say|Ku'paal|Orweyna? Who are these - what have you done?}}

Speak with Ku'paal:
{{dialogue|It is forbidden to bring outsiders to Harandar! Orweyna broke our laws by going to the surface and letting your world know about us. And now this?

Who are you! Have you seen the children?

{{gossip|quest=|We are friends of Orweyna and we are here to help.}}

{{gossip|Who are you?}}
{{dialogue-child|I should ask the same of you! No outsiders have stepped foot between the deep roots in known memory.

<He narrows his eyes, then glances at Orweyna.>

I am Ku'paal. Rootwarden of the great roots of [[Amirdrassil]]. It is my duty and honor to tend to the roots of the great tree.

{{gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|That doesn't matter now. You need help.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ku'paal|Two of our young are still out here!}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|<name> will find them. We must get you to safety.}}
:''Orweyna, Halduron, and Ku'paal departed.''

;Upon approaching Oorla
:{{Text|Say|Oorla|Who - what are you? Stay back, I'm warning you!}}

{{dialogue|How did you get here, trespasser? It is forbidden for outsiders to come to Harandar!

{{gossip|quest=|Ku'paal and Orweyna sent me. It's safe to return to the village.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Oorla|Fine, but those were my kills! No taking credit.}}

;Upon approaching Danul
:{{Text|Say|Danul|Aln'hara's roots! Who are you?}}

{{dialogue|Where did you come from? I've never seen anything like you before, in all my years!

{{gossip|quest=|Ku'paal and Orweyna sent me. It's safe to return to the village.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Danul|Aw, I was just getting warmed up too.}}

Regroup with Orweyna and Halduron.
:{{Text|Say|Halduron Brightwing|Incredible. <name>, come and see.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Behold, Harandar.}}

Speak with Orweyna:
{{dialogue|Harandar lies below and beyond. The swirl of roots above is the Cradle, a most holy place related to the goddess, Aln'hara.

Below is Har'athir, the paint maker's village. Let's stop here for a moment. My eyes and heart desire to look upon my homeland. after so long away.

{{gossip||Play Movie=|<Take in the view.>}}

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "The Harandar Overlook" starts playing:
:{{Text|Bossemote|As the player arrives at the overlook, the camera pans up to showcase the landscape below}}

Speak with Halduron 
{{dialogue|To think that we are beneath the roots of the great world trees. It is breathtaking. We never knew there was an entire world here.

This is a precious opportunity that no one else in Azeroth has been granted.

I am ready to move on when you are.

{{gossip|quest=|Let's head down.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|This way, Halduron, <Name>.}}

Make your way to [[Har'athir]].
:{{Text|Say|Har'athir Guardian|A stranger! Here?}}
:{{Text|Say|Har'athir Dweller|Wha- who is that?}}

;Upon arrival
:{{Text|Say|Ruia|This so-called 'Lightbloom' is no real threat. It does not excuse your heresies.}}

Ku'paal has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Thank you for finding the children. That alone will not grant you free passage through our lands, however.

It is against our ways to have contact with the outside world. Even worse, revealing that not only we Haranir, but Harandar itself, exists is one of our most important laws.

Orweyna will have to answer for her crimes.

{{gossip|What's a Rootwarden?}}
{{dialogue-child|A Rootwarden is responsible for the care and tending of the roots of the world trees. I am the Rootwarden for Amirdrassil, and as such, am rather new to my duties.

We tend to the roots and help to maintain their health. We keep away pests and any who would do harm to the great roots.

{{gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}

{{gossip|Who's Ruia?}}
{{dialogue-child|Ruia is the Rootwarden of [[Nordrassil]], which is a short ways from here.

He has been mentoring me as I recently took up the mantle of Rootwarden to Amirdrassil.

{{gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
