==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lightwarden Ruia.jpg|Lightwarden Ruia|Once a taciturn but respected Rootwarden, Ruia has succumbed to the infectious zeal of the Lightbloom. He believes himself to be in control of his ardor, when in fact the opposite is true.}}
Confront Lightwarden Ruia.
*Lightwarden Ruia slain

==Description==
The day is nearly won. The Sin'dorei cull every new sprout that blooms, and the Hara'ti ward the surrounding wilds against the frenzy's influence. All that yet remains is to remove this lightbound serpent's misguided head.

Rootwarden Ruia has opposed our every action, shouted down our every word. But he is still a Rootwarden--and one with the power of a frenzying lightbloom host at his beck and call.

He is strong. But he does not walk with Aln'hara.

It is time to end this.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Thriving Essence Sprig]]
*[[Bark of the Guardian Tree]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is over. Though the lightbloom may never fully recede, its mastermind has been driven back into the rootway. With the frenzy quelled, and the surrounding forests warded against its advance, we can rest assured that Eversong will not suffer the lightbloom's spread any farther.

We've done it. We've won!

:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Show no fear. Ruia is powerful, but he stands alone. This ends here.}}

Join Halduron, Orweyna, & [[Hagar]] to confront Ruia.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Ruia! The will of Aln'hara stands against you! Cease this madness!}}
:{{Text|Say|Lightwarden Ruia|Presumptuous whelp. Your transgressions end here.}}

Upon bringing Ruia's health to 0,
:{{Text|Say|Lightwarden Ruia|No! Not here, not yet!}}
:''Ruia vanishes.''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I can feel him fleeing through the roots. We have to--}}
:{{Text|Say|Elder Hagar|Peace, Orweyna. Ruia will face judgment. Come, we should fall back to the Suncrown Tree.}}
:''The Party departs''

Reconvene with the party with [[Grand Magister Rommath]] and turn in.
