==Objectives==
Seek [[Ghikal]] outside of [[Fungara Village]] in [[Harandar]].

==Description==
Fungara Village has been silent for some time now.

We've largely been occupied with the [[Lightbloom]] and the threat it presents, so we haven't had time to check in on the [[fungarian]]s to the east. Usually, they are rowdy but managable... But it's rare that they go completely silent.

Ghikal, one of our [[hunter]]s, has already gone ahead to investigate. If you wish to prove yourself an ally, you would do well to offer her assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]
