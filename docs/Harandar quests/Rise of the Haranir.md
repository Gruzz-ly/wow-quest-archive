==Objectives==
Meet Orweyna and [[Halduron Brightwing|Halduron]] in the [[Gardens of Remembrance]] in [[Silvermoon City]].

==Description==
It is done. The frenzy is routed, the Rootwarden has fled, and the Sin'dorei have reclaimed control of their forests.

I can scarcely believe it, but... We succeeded, Weshacin. By Aln'hara's grace, we found a path forward.

Now Halduron's people invite us to their den. I am not fond of your surface-cities. but...

You have aided me so many times, my friend. It is time that the Hara'ti reached out hands of our own.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
For the first time in generations, the haranin walk upon the surface of Aln'hara's creation. Time will tell how her creation receives us in turn.

The fighting is far from over. The void claws at your gates and threatens your people. But know this, my friend: from this day forward, any threat that encroaches upon Aln'hara's bounty will have the Hara'ti to contend with, be it here or deep below the earth.
