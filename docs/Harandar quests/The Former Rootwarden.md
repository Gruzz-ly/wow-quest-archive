==Objectives==
Meet [[Hagar]] at the [[Shrine of Ages]].

==Description==
<name>, I was the Rootwarden of [[Teldrassil]]. For years, I watched the roots here below the surface, but I was not aware of [[War of the Thorns|what was threatening]] the tree outside of Harandar.

For just as long, I have regretted that failure, but we cannot change the past.

I wonder, however, if roots so great are truly, completely dead. Might there be something which can still be done?

I do not know, but I do hope. Will you join me at the Shrine of Ages, to tend the roots?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I lived far longer before I became Rootwarden than after.

Yet Teldrassil will always be what defines my life.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Hagar|I willl{{Sic}} meet you at the Shrine soon, <name>.}}

Head to the Shrine of Ages and speak with Hagar,
{{Dialogue|I am deeply grateful for your willingness to help Teldrassil--and myself, <name>.

{{gossip|Do you blame yourself for what happened to Teldrassil?}}
{{Dialogue-child|How could I not, <name>? I was the Rootwarden. Teldrassil was mine to watch over, my responsibility.

I've told myself, countless times, that I couldn't be expected to know the threat might be above the roots, that no one knew or expected what happened. And I know that is true, in a way.

But I also, as Rootwarden, was to devote myself to Teldrassil, entirely. The tree should not have burned, while I still had breath.

{{gossip|What's been most difficult about all of this?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The silence, Weshacin. Teldrassil did not "speak" to me. But I heard her voice, like one hears nature around them. We are speaking now, but I hear the nearby stalkers, and the rippling of the stream around us.

Teldrassil was like that, yet moreso--always woven into my thoughts. For ten years, then nothing.

{{gossip|<Continue listening.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|But worse than silence is the knowing. The certainty that silence is all I will ever experience.

It feels very like being afraid. But fear is about what could happen, what you hope does not happen. Teldrassil is gone, and I shall never...

That... "knowing" is a greater burden than I can express.
