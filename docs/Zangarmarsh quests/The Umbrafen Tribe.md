==Objectives==
[[Ikeyen]] at the [[Cenarion Refuge]] wants you to travel to [[Umbrafen Village]] and slay [[Kataru]], 8 Umbrafen Seers, 6 Umbrafen Witchdoctors and 6 Umbrafen Oracles.
*[[Kataru]] slain
*[[Umbrafen Oracle]] slain (6)
*[[Umbrafen Seer]] slain (8)
*[[Umbrafen Witchdoctor]] slain (6)

==Description==
The [[naga]] are terrible, yes. But even more terrible are the traitor [[tribe]]s of [[Broken]] and [[Lost One]]s that helped them!

The worst of all are the Lost Ones of the [[Umbrafen tribe]]; they use dark [[magic]] to trap and enslave others. They're especially cruel to escaped [[slave]]s and would slit my throat if I left the refuge even for a day.

Travel to Umbrafen Village south of here and kill them and their leader, [[Kataru]]. Until then I will fear for my life every single day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
You've returned; are Kataru and the Umbrafen [[slaver]]s dead?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I will finally sleep comfortably at night. Were I not so old and weakened I would deal with my own enemies.

Take this gold. It is not much, but your kindness cannot go unpaid.

==Notes==
*Only 4-5 Umbrafen Witchdoctors will spawn at any given time, so you will have to wait for them to respawn.
