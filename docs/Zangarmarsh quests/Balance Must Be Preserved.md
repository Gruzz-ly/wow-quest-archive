==Objectives==
[[Ysiel Windsinger]] wants you to use the [[Ironvine Seeds]] on the Steam Pump Controls at [[Serpent Lake]], [[Umbrafen Lake]], [[Marshlight Lake]] and the [[Lagoon]]. Then return to her at the [[Cenarion Refuge]] in [[Zangarmarsh]] with any leftover seeds you have.
*Umbrafen Lake Controls Disabled
*Marshlight Lake Controls Disabled
*Serpent Lake Controls Disabled 
*Lagoon Controls Disabled
*[[Ironvine Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
I cannot begin to comprehend why the [[naga]] would drain the water out of their own habitat. What I do understand is a need to put a stop to their operations.

These seeds carry with them the rage of the earth. Take them to the steam pumps operated by the naga and use them on their controls.

The vines that grow from the seeds will be as thick as your arm and as strong as iron. Go, <name>. Restore the balance that the naga have upset.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*13350 XP
*{{cost|3|10}}
* +350 reputation with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Is it done, <class>?

==Completion==
It is done, then.  The marsh has been saved for now.

Don't think for a second that this will be the last we hear of the naga.  We must remain vigilant of our enemy as we continue with our mission in [[Outland]].

==Notes==
After using the quest item on the controllers, a [[Steam Pump Overseer]] appears at each.
*{{Text|say|Steam Pump Overseer|I'll make you pay for that!}}
*{{Text|say|Steam Pump Overseer|Warlord Kalithresh will hear of this insolence!}}
*{{text|say|Steam Pump Overseer|I will show you not to cross us again!}}
