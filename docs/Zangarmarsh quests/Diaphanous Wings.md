==Objectives==
[[Haalrun]] at [[Telredor]] wants you to bring him 8 Diaphanous Wings from any of the [[firefly]] species in [[Zangarmarsh]].
*[[Diaphanous Wing]] (8)

==Description==
Living in such a remote location has taught us to make use of everything available. Of course, you have to learn to stop thinking about where some of these materials come from first.

I've found that the wings of the [[Umbraglow Stinger|umbraglow stingers]] are very helpful for waterproofing. They're strong, thin, and flexible.

<Haalrun chuckles.>

I see the look on your face. Like I said, it takes time to get used to the idea. If you're going to be out and about, would you mind bringing me some of the wings?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Did you manage to gather any diaphanous wings?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

<Haalrun smiles sympathetically.>

At least you don't have to clean them. That's the worst job of the lot, but once it's done, you'd never know they were attached to a giant insect.
