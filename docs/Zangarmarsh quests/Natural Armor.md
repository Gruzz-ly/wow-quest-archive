==Objectives==
Bring 8 Fenclaw Hides to [[Maktu]] at the [[Orebor Harborage]].
* [[Fenclaw Hide]] (8)
* [[Potion of Water Breathing]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Maktu]] can always see a [[draenei]] approaching in his shiny armor from a mile away, even in this murky swamp!

Maktu wants to laugh at them, but then he remembers that they have been kind to the [[Kurenai]] and he wants to teach them about how Kurenai make armor.

The dark, scaly hides of the [[Fenclaw Thrasher|fenclaw thrashers]] make some of the best armor Maktu has ever worn. If <name> can bring Maktu some of these hides from the fenclaw thrashers deep in [[Serpent Lake]], he'll be happy to share some of his armor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|40}}
* 10750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
Does <name> have hides for Maktu?

==Completion==
These are good hides, Maktu thinks. They will make very good armor.

Who knows? There might even be enough left over for Maktu to make some armor for the draenei.

==Notes==
Requires neutral status with the [[Kurenai]].
