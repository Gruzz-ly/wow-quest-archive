You must have 355 [[fishing]] skill to fish in Zangarmarsh.

==Objectives==
Take the Strange Engine Part to [[K. Lee Smallfry]] in [[Telredor]].
* [[Strange Engine Part]] (provided)

==Description==
This strange engine part doesn't look like it fits in a steam pump, much less anything else you've seen. Perhaps K. Lee Smallfry might know something about it.

==Rewards==
You will be rewarded with the following:
*{{cost|g=2|s=20}}
*12650 [[XP]]
*Total of {{Cost|g=9|s=79}} at Lvl 70

==Progress==
Oh goodness! What've you got there, <name>?

==Completion==
<K. Lee looks at the engine part and then stares off into the distance for a moment.>

This is somethin' real special. Difficulty to say where it's from—like it just fell out of the sky. I'm gonna hold on to this and pay you for your troubles.

Between you and me though, I think it's best if we didn't mention this to anyone.

<K. Lee puts on her most charming smile.>

==Notes==
*The part is randomly fished out of Steam Pump Flotsam nodes in Zangarmarsh.
*The item which starts the quest can be looted by [[Horde]]-players, but they will not receive any quests from it.
*The item which starts the quest, along with the quest itself and K. Lee Smallfry who the quest is turned in to, are all references to the film ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_(film) Serenity]''. The film is an extension of the series ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series) Firefly]'' which features a futuristic sci-fi/western scenario, following the adventures of the crew aboard a spaceship called "Serenity". In the movie, there is a scene where the crew mechanic, Kaywinnit Lee "Kaylee" Frye, says: "And don't fly in anything with a Capissen 38 engine; they fall RIGHT out of the sky."
