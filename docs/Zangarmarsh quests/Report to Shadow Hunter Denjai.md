==Objectives==
Bring [[Zurai's Report]] to [[Shadow Hunter Denjai]] at [[Zabra'jin]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].
*[[Zurai's Report]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Shadow Hunter Denjai]] will no doubt expect to receive a report about my progress in establishing our outpost. I've prepared a short summary of what we've accomplished here already, but with the loss of [[Scout Jyoba]], I can't spare a runner to take the report to Denjai's base of Zabra'jin to the west.

If you're headed that way, would you mind bringing this to him? Shadow Hunter Denjai can be a little intimidating at first, but once you get used to him, he's not so bad.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2550 [[XP]] (or {{cost||60|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
You don't look like one of my men. Speak your piece, <race>.

==Completion==
Why didn't you say you had a report from Zurai? I've been waiting to hear from him.

I sent him out there to give us a presence on the eastern border, not sit on his hands. Let's see what he has to say.
