* Rajis Fyashe{{co|65|40|Zangarmarsh}} slain

==Description==
A bounty is hereby declared by the [[Cenarion Expedition]] on Rajis Fyashe, leader of the [[Bloodscale tribe|Bloodscale]] [[naga]]. The naga [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] was last sighted at Serpent Lake, in the northern region of Zangarmarsh.

The Bloodscale are to be considered extremely dangerous and their leader is to be approached with extreme caution.

Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot at Cenarion Refuge.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

* +350 reputation with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
You're here to claim the bounty for Fyashe? That's the best news I've heard all day.

==Completion==
I'll bet the Bloodscale will think twice about attacking expedition scouts again.  Take this as a reward, <name>.  You've earned it.
