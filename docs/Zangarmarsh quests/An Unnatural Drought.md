==Objectives==
[[Vindicator Idaar]] at [[Telredor]] wants you to kill 12 Withered Giants. 
*[[Withered Giant]] slain (12)

==Description==
The soil sample you brought me is nearly devoid of moisture, <name>. If the soil itself is losing moisture, then the creatures that live in the [[Dead Mire]] must be suffering terribly.

I've seen what happens when the region's [[fungal giant]]s begin to wither and die. The pain drives them mad, causing them to attack anything in their path.

These creatures have no idea what's happening to them. They're beyond our ability to save, so the best we can do is to end their suffering.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Vindicator's Cinch|Fen Strider's Bracer|Explorer's Bands|Researcher's Mantle}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
It pains me to kill the creatures of the Dead Mire, but they are beyond saving. The best we can do is work to restore the area and nurture a new generation.

==Completion==
Thank you for helping with this difficult task, <name>. Our work in the Dead Mire is not yet done, but now our efforts will focus on doing what we can to restore balance to the area.
