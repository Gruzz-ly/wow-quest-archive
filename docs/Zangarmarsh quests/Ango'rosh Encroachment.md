==Objectives==
Kill 10 Ango'rosh Ogres and 5 Ango'rosh Shaman and return to [[Ikuti]] at the [[Orebor Harborage]].
*[[Ango'rosh Shaman]] slain (5)
*[[Ango'rosh Ogre]] slain (10)

==Description==
The small band of [[Broken]] you see here is a mission from a larger settlement in [[Nagrand]]. The [[Kurenai]], as we call ourselves, are Broken who desire to reunite with our [[draenei]] brothers.

My group has come here to strengthen Kurenai ties to the draenei of [[Telredor]].

If the [[Ango'rosh tribe|Ango'rosh]] [[ogre]]s have their way, this temple will not stand much longer. They have cleared the [[Hewn Bog]] of its towering mushrooms and draw ever closer to our refuge. If you would call yourself our friend, aid us in fighting this enemy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|3|10}}
* 8600 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
How goes the fight against the Ango'rosh?

==Completion==
The Ango'rosh threat is contained for the moment, but I'm certain they won't give up that easily. I've forgotten many things since the end of my life as a draenei, but the stubbornness of the ogres is an enduring memory.
