'''Fhwoor Smash!''' is an [[escort quest]] only obtainable after reaching {{reputation|friendly}} with [[Sporeggar]]. Also important, [[Fhwoor]] does not complete the quest, a nearby [[sporeling]] does.

==Objectives==
Escort Fhwoor into the area of the [[Marshlight Lake|Marshlight]] steam pump to retrieve the Ark of Ssslith. Bring Fhwoor and the ark back safely and then report back to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.
*[[The Ark of Ssslith|Ark of Ssslith]] safely returned to [[Sporeggar (town)|Sporeggar]]
*Return to [[Gzhun'tt]] at Sporeggar in [[Zangarmarsh]].

==Description==
Little [[naga]] make Fhwoor angry! Sporelings good friend to Fhwoor, so Fhwoor get naga ark.

We go into [[Bloodscale Enclave|nearby naga village]]. You help? Bring friends! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sporeggar Smasher|Hewing Axe of the Marsh|Sporeling Claw}}

You will also receive:
*13750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|25|}} at level 70)
* +350 reputation with [[Sporeggar]]

==Progress==
Is Fwhoor alright? Have you recovered the ark?

==Completion==
Fhwoor's a good giant. We saved him from the naga a while ago and he's stayed here helping us with things ever since.

We can only hope that the naga will take the hint and realize that if we can infiltrate their village and steal their most prized possession, we can do much worse. Perhaps now they will return to [[Coilfang Reservoir|their reservoir]] and leave us in peace? 

==Notes==
To save trouble, clear the islands just to the east of the pump station of naga. There are two scripted spawns, one after picking up the ark, and the other after leaving camp. The second spawn has an elite with 35,000 health and two adds.
