==Objectives==
[[Reavij]] at [[Swamprat Post]] wants you to kill 10 Marshfang Rippers. 
*[[Marshfang Ripper]] slain (10)

==Description==
Sometimes I wish [[Shadow Hunter Denjai|Denjai]] had sent a [[shaman]] with us, or at least given us a [[totem]] to keep the marshfang rippers at bay.

The whole place is crawling with the pests! It's just not right. Shouldn't something be eating these despicable things?

We've all been taking turns playing exterminator. You showed up at just the right time, <name>. Congratulations! Now get out there and mop up some marshfangs!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
I still see marshfangs, <name>. Surely you can't be done so soon.

==Completion==
Had your fill already?

<Reavij laughs.>

There's a reason why our visitors don't stay long.

If I had a choice, I'd find a more agreeable spot for the post, but I'll take marshfangs over Denjai's temper any day.
