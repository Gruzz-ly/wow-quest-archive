==Objectives==
Gather 6 Feralfen Idols and return them to [[Anchorite Ahuurn]] at [[Telredor]].
*[[Feralfen Idol]] (6)

==Description==
From what you've told me about your observations at the [[Boha'mu Ruins]], it seems [[Feralfen tribe|this tribe]] of [[Lost One]]s has reverted to the worship of [[animal]] [[Ghost|spirits]]. Before we can approach them, we must know more of their beliefs.

Return to [[Feralfen Village]] and discreetly gather some of their idols so that I may study them. Try to avoid angering them, <name>, as it may hurt our chances of making contact with them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|70}}
* 10050 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Do you have the idols?

==Completion==
These should be more than sufficient, <name>. They seem to be fixated on [[bird]]s, which is odd, because there aren't any bird species native to [[Zangarmarsh]]. What could this mean?

Could they have encountered the [[arakkoa]]? To a [[shaman]]istic people, they might seem like the embodiment of a powerful bird spirit.

==Progression==
{{Messenger to the Feralfen}}
