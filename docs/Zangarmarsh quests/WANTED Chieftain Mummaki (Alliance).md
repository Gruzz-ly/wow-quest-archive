==Objectives==
Bring [[Chieftain Mummaki]]'s Totem to [[Ikuti]] at the [[Orebor Harborage]].
*[[Chieftain Mummaki's Totem]]
*Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki - leader of the foul and degenerate [[Lost One]] tribe of the [[Daggerfen]], for his brutal attacks against the Orebor Harborage.

The chieftain and his band of [[assassin]]s are responsible for the deaths of numerous [[Kurenai]] and [[draenei]] and should only be approached by seasoned combatants.

Travelers are advised to avoid the [[Daggerfen Village]] area to the west of the Orebor Harborage.

To claim the bounty, present proof of the chietain's demise to Ikuti.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|20}}
* 10750 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
So you wish to claim the bounty on Chieftain Mummaki?

==Completion==
Remarkable! There have been others who tried to claim the bounty, but they never returned. It's not hard to figure out what happened to them.

I'm relieved that we'll no longer be troubled by Mummaki and his degenerates.
