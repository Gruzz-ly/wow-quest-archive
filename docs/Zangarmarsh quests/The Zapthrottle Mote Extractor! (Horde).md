==Objectives==
Bring 15 Steam Pump Parts to [[Mack Diver]] at [[Zabra'jin]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].
*[[Steam Pump Part]] (15)

==Description==
The swamp gas is truly amazing, and can be very useful, mon! But first, you gotta be able to suck it up, and that, my friend, requires a [[:Zapthrottle Mote Extractor]].

Now, I could just give you the schematics, but I'll need something in return first. How about some spare parts? Last time I checked, there were plenty laying around near the broken steam pump at the [[Dead Mire]], far to the northeast.

I heard that the [[Withered Giant|withered giants]] spread the pieces all over that dried-out lake bed.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You receive|Schematic: Zapthrottle Mote Extractor}}

You will also gain:
*6600 [[XP]] (or {{cost||39|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
You got those parts yet?  I've got some diving to do.

==Completion==
Alright! Now if we only had a stretchy loop, a parchment clamp, a guzzle tube and some sticky duck ribbon. Then we could really make something!

Ok, ok, I guess you've earned this, <name>.  Have fun!
