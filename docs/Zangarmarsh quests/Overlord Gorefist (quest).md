==Objectives==
[[Ikuti]] wants you to kill [[Overlord Gorefist]] and 10 [[Ango'rosh Mauler|Ango'rosh Maulers]]. Return to the [[Orebor Harborage]] once you have completed the task.
*[[Overlord Gorefist]] slain
*[[Ango'rosh Mauler]] slain (10)

==Description==
The centerpiece of any [[ogre]] [[tribe]] is its leader. Without leadership, the [[Ango'rosh]]'s [[organization]] will disappear and they'll resort to infighting to determine who will lead next.

Although we've seen the ogres out and about in this area, their true strength is concentrated in their [[Ango'rosh Stronghold]] to the northwest. It's located in a cave on a small island connected to the marsh by a fallen mushroom.

Go there and defeat Overlord Gorefist. That should provide us with a well-deserved respite.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Glowing Crystal Insignia
|Telaar Courier's Cloak
|Marsh Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|7|40|}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
Is it done? Have you dealt with Overlord Gorefist?

==Completion==
At last! You have our thanks for your help in securing our position at the Orebor Harborage. I will send word of your deeds to the [[Kurenai]] city of [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]]. There will be many more opportunities for our peoples to work together.
