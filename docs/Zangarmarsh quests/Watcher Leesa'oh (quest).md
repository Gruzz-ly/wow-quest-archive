==Objectives==
Speak with [[Watcher Leesa'oh]] at the [[Cenarion Watchpost]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].

==Description==
There's important research to be conducted into the ecology of the local creatures, especially the [[sporeling]]s and [[Fungal giant|bog lords]] of the marsh. And trust me, once you get out into the field, you'll find the work to be challenging.

Seek out Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in the western region of the marsh toward the south. Follow the path west and you will eventually find her. She can be a bit—studious—but don't let that get to you.

Oh, and watch out for [[Buddy|her cat]].

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*5250 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|89|}} at level 70)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Completion==
Oh, good... help finally!  There's just so much to do, and I need to stay here to organize it all.

I hope that you're ready to get your hands dirty.
