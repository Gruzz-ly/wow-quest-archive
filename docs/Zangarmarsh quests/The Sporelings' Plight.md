==Objectives==
[[Fahssn]] at the [[Spawning Glen]] wants you to collect 10 Mature Spore Sacs.
*[[Mature Spore Sac]] (10)

==Description==
You there! You must help us!

The [[fungal giant]]s are devouring all of our spore sacs! You must do something, or we'll lose our young!

The spore sacs start out large and become smaller as the air inside them is depleted. Look for the small, mature spore sacs and save as many of them as you can!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+750 [[reputation]] with [[Sporeggar]]

==Progress==
The spore sacs!  Did you get them? 

==Completion==
You've done it!  You have my people's thanks.

I hope you understand... this is where our young ones come from.  We can't let these beasts devour the sacs!
