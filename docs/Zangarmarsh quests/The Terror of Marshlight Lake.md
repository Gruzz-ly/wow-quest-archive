==Objectives==
Slay [[Terrorclaw]] and return to [[Puluu]] at the [[Orebor Harborage]].
*[[Terrorclaw]] slain
*[[Potion of Water Breathing]] (provided)

==Description==
Traveling through [[naga]]-infested lands has shown me the cruel truth about how my less fortunate brethren are treated. At [[Marshlight Lake]], to the southwest, I observed a particularly malicious taskmaster playing a deadly game. He orders his slaves out to the islands in Marshlight Lake when he knows that Terrorclaw, a giant [[bogstrok]], is ready to feed.

I needn't describe what results. We are too few to take on the naga directly, but we can deprive them of their amusement by killing their pet.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Swamprunner's Boots	
|Fierce Mantle
|Fearless Girdle	
|Terrorcloth Mantle
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10}}
*9990 [[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
I am ashamed that I cannot do more to help my enslaved brethren. but at least we have prevented more needless deaths.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Perhaps with the help of the [[draenei]], this marsh will one day be free of naga. I can't imagine what it must be like to be forced to serve them.

He doesn't talk about it often, but Maktu was once a slave.
