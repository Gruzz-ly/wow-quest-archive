==Objectives==
Kill [[Terrorclaw]] and return to [[Zurjaya]] at [[Zabra'jin]]. 
*[[Terrorclaw]] slain
*[[Potion of Water Breathing]] (provided)

==Description==
I've caught every kind of fish that lives in [[Zangarmarsh|the marsh]], but there's one that eludes me. Sure, I've caught [[eel]]s and [[Mudfin Frenzy|mudfin frenzies]]. But the last time I was out on one of the islands in [[Marshlight Lake]], I hooked a gigantic [[bogstrok]] that snapped my line and got away.

Terrorclaw, he's called, and I won't rest until he's dead. He's too big for any fisherman to catch, so I suppose we'll just have to kill him the old-fashioned way. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Fearless Girdle|Fierce Mantle|Swamprunner's Boots|Terrorcloth Mantle}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
I take it Terrorclaw lives no more?

==Completion==
At last! They say every great fisherman has a story of "the one that got away," but I haven't yet met a creature I couldn't beat one way or another.
