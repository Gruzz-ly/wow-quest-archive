==Objectives==
Slay [[Mragesh]] and return to [[Zurjaya]] in [[Zabra'jin]]. 
*[[Mragesh]] slain
*[[Potion of Water Breathing]] (provided)

==Description==
You've dealt with most of the little [[hydra]], but I doubt [[Mragesh]] was impressed by your display. He's a cunning, ferocious beast and he's dogged many an angler in his time.

I intend to be the last one he'll ever bother. He's bound to be hiding deep in the waters of [[Serpent Lake]], to the northeast. He's a has-been; he just doesn't know it yet.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Onslaught Elixir|Adept's Elixir}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you "retired" old Mragesh?

==Completion==
I'm sure the old boy must've seen his days coming to an end. With all these new arrivals, the old order couldn't stand. It's just as well his spirit is at rest now.
