This quest is the culmination of the ogre chain out of [[Zabra'jin]]. For many players it may be the final quest of the entire zone, together with  [[Stealing Back the Mushrooms]] (from [[Watcher Leesa'oh]]) which is best completed at the same time.

==Objectives==
Kill [[Overlord Gorefist]], 10 Ango'rosh Maulers, and 10 Ango'rosh Souleaters and report back to [[Shadow Hunter Denjai]] in [[Zabra'jin]]. 
*[[Ango'rosh Mauler]] slain (10)
*[[Ango'rosh Souleater]] slain (10)
*[[Overlord Gorefist]] slain

==Description==
In order to end the [[Ango'rosh]] threat, we must kill their leader, [[Overlord Gorefist]]. We'll do better than that, though. We'll make an example of the overlord and his followers.

Go to the [[Ango'rosh Stronghold]] and deal with our foes. The stronghold is located in a cave on a small island to the northwest of Zabra'jin. You'll see a bridge made from a fallen mushroom beyond the [[Ango'rosh Grounds|Ango'rosh Camp]].

Show no mercy, <name>. They certainly wouldn't spare any of us.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will get both of these rewards|Captain Krosh's Crash Helmet|Crimson Steer Energy Drink|q2=5}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|20|}}
*13350 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|42|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
The threat of the Ango'rosh looms over us. Have you eliminated their leader?

==Completion==
Your victory over the Ango'rosh is to be celebrated, <name>. I wonder how long it will be before those ogre brutes find themselves another bloodthirsty chieftain.

No matter, we'll be ready for them.

==Notes==
Contrary to the quest description, the Overlord as well as the Souleaters can only be found on top of the floating hill, not inside the cave below. Maulers can be found in both locations, and they also ambush characters looting any [[Box of Mushrooms]] for [[Stealing Back the Mushrooms]].
