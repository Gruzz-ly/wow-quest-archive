==Objectives==
Investigate the Spawning Glen in [[Zangarmarsh]], and then report back to [[Watcher Leesa'oh]] at the [[Cenarion Watchpost]] in [[Zangarmarsh]] with your findings. 
*Investigate the [[Spawning Glen]]

==Description==
We need to learn all that we can of the [[sporeling]]s at [[Sporeggar (town)|Sporeggar]] and their relationship to the creatures around them. One way to do that is what I'm doing; passive observation while making a note of their interactions.

I need you to head over to the Spawning Glen to the west. Investigate the whole area and then return to tell me what you saw.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Back so soon? Your observation of the [[Sporeggar]] sporelings is critical to my research. I hope you aren't the type to rush things. Show patience and make certain that you have explored the entirety of the Spawning Glen before giving me your final report.

==Completion==
What?!  The bog lords of [[Quagg Ridge]] are EATING the sporelings' pods?  This isn't good!
