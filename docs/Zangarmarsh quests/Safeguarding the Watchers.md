==Objectives==
Kill [[Lord Klaq]] and return to [[Windcaller Blackhoof]] at the [[Cenarion Refuge]]. 
*[[Lord Klaq]] slain

==Description==
In your travels, you might have encountered some of the expedition's watchers. They do the majority of the field work: documenting the unique inhabitants of the marsh, collecting samples, and making contact with sentient species.

The safety of the watchers is paramount, <class>. We've had to recall the watchers we sent to explore [[Funggor Cavern]] to the south, because of [[marshbeast]] attacks. Warden Hamoot believes that killing their leader, Lord Klaq, will bring a swift end to the attacks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you located and dealt with Lord Klaq?

==Completion==
You have my gratitude, <name>, and that of the watchers. They will be heartened to hear that they can continue their work to the south without fear of attack. 

==Notes==
Originally, it was a group quest (Suggested Players [2]).
