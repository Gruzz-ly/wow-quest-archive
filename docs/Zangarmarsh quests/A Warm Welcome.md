==Objectives==
[[Warden Hamoot]] at the [[Cenarion Refuge]] wants you to bring him 30 Naga Claws.
*[[Naga Claws]] (30)

==Description==
While the [[druid]]s from the [[Cenarion Expedition|expedition]] have made themselves busy studying plants and researching the lakes, I've made it my business to deal with the hostiles in the area.

Ever since we set foot in [[Zangarmarsh]], the [[naga]] have launched lethal attacks against us without warning. We've done our best to keep them at bay, but our resources are limited.

I want you to go to the various naga strongholds in Zangarmarsh and show them that we're not to be crossed. Bring me their claws as proof of your victories.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|3|10}}
|q=5|Volatile Healing Potion}}

*13350 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|42|}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
It's good to see you again, <name>.  How's your hunt for the naga going?

==Completion==
Good job, <name>.  You'd do well to shed any feelings of remorse you might harbor.  These naga are vicious creatures - even more so than the [[Azeroth]]ian ones.
