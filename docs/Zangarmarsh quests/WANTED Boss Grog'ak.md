== Objectives ==
Bring [[Boss Grog'ak's Head]] to [[Shadow Hunter Denjai]] in [[Zabra'jin]]. 
*[[Boss Grog'ak's Head]]

==Description==
Wanted - Dead or Alive: [[Boss Grog'ak]], overseer of the Ango'rosh mushroom-cutting operation.

This brute and his axe-wielding cronies are responsible for chopping down the mushrooms to the north of town. Unless he is stopped, he and his band will cut a path to the walls of Zabra'jin.

<He/She> who presents the head of Boss Grog'ak to Shadow Hunter Denjai shall be well-rewarded.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*13350 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|42|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
What do you have there, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. The presence of these ogres so close to our outpost does have me worried, though. It seems like they've been filtering down from the northern mountains for some time.

==Progression==
#[[WANTED: Boss Grog'ak]]
#[[Impending Attack]]
#[[Us or Them]]
