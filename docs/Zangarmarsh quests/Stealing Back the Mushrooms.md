==Objectives==
Collect 10 Boxes of Mushrooms and return them to [[Watcher Leesa'oh]] at the [[Cenarion Watchpost]] in [[Zangarmarsh]]. 
*[[Box of Mushrooms]] (10)

==Description==
<Class>, I've got an idea. I want you to head north again, this time into the heart of [[ogre]] territory!

Northwest of the [[Hewn Bog]] there is a place named [[Ango'rosh Stronghold]], which sits on a floating island across a large mushroom bridge.

The ogres must be storing the harvested mushrooms there. I bet you'll find them all over the place, and probably on the ogres themselves, too!

Bring me a sufficient number and I will try to do something about providing the [[Bog Lord|bog lords]] with a new source of nourishment.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Zangar Epaulets|Helm of Natural Purity|Marsh Survivalist's Belt|Leesa'oh's Wristbands}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|20|}}
*13350 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|42|}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
You have all of the mushrooms that we need to create a new garden for the bog lords?

==Completion==
These are perfect!  Oh, thank you, <class>!

You've been ever so careful not to disturb the natural order of things, and we've gathered so much information in such a short amount of time!

Now, let's see if our little plan to grow a new food supply for the bog lords is going to work.

==Notes==
Completing this quest starts a scripted event. Leesa'oh walks off a bit and plants the mushrooms. This grows a mushroom tree. A Hungry Bug Lord appears which tastes the tree and seems to like it. Leesa'oh observes this and congratulates you on the success. The script runs as follows:
:{{text|say|Watcher Leesa'oh|<Name>, let's go see if this plan will work. Come along, Buddy!}}
:''They walk a little ways east of her current location.''
:{{text|say|Watcher Leesa'oh|Ok, let's see about using those mushrooms you brought back to grow the bog lords a new food supply.}}
:''Leesa'oh plants a giant mushroom.''
:{{text|say|Watcher Leesa'oh|Wait and see what happens.}}
:''After a few moments a [[Hungry Bog Lord]] will appear and move towards the mushroom.''
:{{text|emote|The Hungry Bog Lord takes a piece of the mushroom tree and holds it to its 'nose'. Seemingly satisfied, it eats it!}}
:''At this point, Buddy, the saber, begins to head back to the camp.''
:{{text|say|Watcher Leesa'oh|Oh Buddy, you big baby! Look, it's working. It's really working!! Now all I need to do is grow more of these mushrooms here and the bog lords will likely leave the sporelings alone!}}
:{{text|emote|The Hungry Bog Lord uproots the rest of the mushroom tree and makes off with it.}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Leesa'oh|Oh, thank you, <name>! You've made it possible to save both the sporelings from the bog lords, and the bog lords from our wrath.}}
