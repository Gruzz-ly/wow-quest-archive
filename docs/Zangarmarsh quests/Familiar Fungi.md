==Objectives==
Collect 15 Mushroom Samples and return them to [[Watcher Leesa'oh]] at the [[Cenarion Watchpost]] in [[Zangarmarsh]]. 
*[[Mushroom Sample]] (15)

==Description==
Yes, that's it, I knew I had seen this particular phylum of mushroom elsewhere in the marsh!

To the north is a place known as the [[Hewn Bog]]. Odd name for the place if you ask me, but I've never been there. I'll need samples of those mushrooms to confirm my hypothesis.

Just be careful, <class>. I'd heard that [[ogre]]s have moved in to the area, so you'll have to get the samples from them. Could that be why the bog lords are no longer going there for their food?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Do you have those samples yet?

==Completion==
We definitely have a match here.  And the presence of the ogres and what they were doing there explains everything.  Now I get why it's called the Hewn Bog, duh!

We have to do something about this situation, but what?  We can't just wipe out all of those ogres; they have every bit as much a right to be here as any of the other creatures in the marsh!
