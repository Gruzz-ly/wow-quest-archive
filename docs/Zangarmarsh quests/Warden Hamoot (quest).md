==Objectives==
Report to [[Warden Hamoot]] at the [[Cenarion Refuge]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].

==Description==
Before you leave Cenarion Refuge, make sure you speak with Warden Hamoot. He's in charge of the [[Cenarion Expedition|expedition]]'s security.

He would never forgive me if I didn't send a seasoned [[adventurer]] like you his way.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*1100 [[XP]] (or {{cost||52|50}} at level 70)

==Completion==
Ysiel sent you?  Of course I can use someone like you!  We're always in need of a little muscle.
