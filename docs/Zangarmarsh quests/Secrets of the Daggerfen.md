==Objectives==
Bring the [[Daggerfen Poison Manual]] and a [[Daggerfen Poison Vial]] to [[Timothy Daniels]] at the [[Orebor Harborage]]. 
*[[Daggerfen Poison Manual]]
*[[Daggerfen Poison Vial]]

==Description==
Bugs, bugs, bugs! [[Zangarmarsh|The marsh]] is full of them and my companions here seem obsessed with them.

Well, I've had it with the bugs! Something far more intriguing has captured my interest. To the west, there is a [[Daggerfen Village|village]] of [[Lost One]]s who call themselves the [[Daggerfen]].

The whole [[tribe]] consists of highly specialized [[assassin]]s. I've noticed them mixing and using a particularly potent kind of poison. I'm dying to know more about the poison, but that's going to require a copy of the recipe and a sample vial.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Tim's Trusty Helmet|Crimson Steer Energy Drink}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Did your search of Daggerfen Village yield the information I need in order to get to the bottom of this poison puzzle?

==Completion==
<Timothy leafs through the manual.>

They're using [[:ragveil]] as a base for the poison? No, that can't be right. Ragveil has no toxic properties.

Including ragveil in a poison is like a [[rogue]] wielding two [[mace]]s. Sure, you can do it, but it isn't true to the essence of your calling! I just can't understand...

<Timothy clears his throat.>

I mean, thank you for fetching these for me. I'll try out the poison as soon as time permits.
