==Objectives==
[[Puluu]] at the [[Orebor Harborage]] wants you to kill 12 [[Marshfang Slicer]]s.
* [[Marshfang Slicer]] slain (12)

==Description==
One of the reasons Ikuti led us to [[Zangarmarsh]] was to help open the lines of communication between the [[draenei]] and the [[Kurenai]] home city of [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]]. In order for messengers to pass swiftly between Telaar and [[Telredor]], the roads must be secured.

On our way here, we were attacked repeatedly by marshfang slicers. We were able to fight them off, but they would pose a formidable threat to a solitary messenger. Reducing their numbers will help ensure the safety of our messengers.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ensorcelled Marshfang Blade
|Keen Marshfang Slicer
|Marshfang Blade Axe
|Keen Marshfang Shanker
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|7|40|}}
* 8600 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
Have you made progress in securing the roads?

==Completion==
That's excellent news. The way is still far from perfectly safe, but the messengers are clever and resourceful.

==Notes==
*Requires {{Rep|neutral}} status with the [[Kurenai]].
