==Objectives==
Bring 6 [[Marshlight Bleeder]] Venom to [[Puluu]] at the [[Orebor Harborage]].
* [[Marshlight Bleeder Venom]] (6)

==Description==
When I speak to [[draenei]], I often get the sense that they consider themselves removed from their environment. Many seem to pity my brethren, the [[Broken]], who they say have lost something.

We Broken may have lost our inclination toward the [[Light]], but our experiences have brought us closer to the land.

My people see opportunities where few draenei do. Take, for example, the venom of the marshlight bleeders that live to the south and west. It has a wide variety of uses from hunting to healing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|40|}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
I hope to demonstrate the uses of bleeder venom to [[Anchorite Ahuurn]] and the others at [[Telredor]]. That's going to require me to double my supply.

==Completion==
Thank you for bringing this venom, <name>. It will go a long way toward making my demonstration possible without depleting my personal stores.
