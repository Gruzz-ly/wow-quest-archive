==Objectives==
[[Zurai]] at [[Swamprat Post]] wants you to bring him 12 Thick Hydra Scales.
*[[Thick Hydra Scale]] (12)
*[[Potion of Water Breathing]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Reavij]] was wise to bring leather armor. This swamp will render my mail useless before long.

I've been replacing the scales bit by bit as I'm able. The hydra in the marsh have thick, protective scales that stand up well to the dampness of their home.

Finding suitable ones is a tedious process, though. All too often, the best scales are torn or worn too thin for use in armor. Bring me any good ones that you might get from the hydra in the larger lakes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
I see you smirking. Yes, my armor's going to look a bit odd until I've replaced all the old metal, but it's better this than unprotected.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Every little bit helps.

I've still got a long way to go, but let's face it, what else am I going to do between patrols?
