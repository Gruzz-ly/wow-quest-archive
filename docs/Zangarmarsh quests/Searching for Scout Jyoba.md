==Objectives==
Search for [[Scout Jyoba]]. 

==Description==
Now that you're familiar with the terrain, I'd like to ask your help with something else. The [[Dead Mire]], we've taken to calling the area to the northwest, is an eerie place. No one has ever reported seeing anything alive there, but they didn't stay for very long, either.

Scout Jyoba volunteered to investigate the area and report on his findings. He left the post three days ago and hasn't returned. It's not like him to be gone that long without sending some kind of report. Will you search for him, <name>? 

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Completion==
The battered corpse matches [[Zurai]]'s description perfectly. Whatever killed the scout appears to have taken him by surprise, as his weapon is sheathed and the contents of a small inkwell stain the nearby ground.
