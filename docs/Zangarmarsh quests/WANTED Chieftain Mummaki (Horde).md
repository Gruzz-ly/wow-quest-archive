==Objectives==
Bring Chieftain Mummaki's Totem to [[Shadow Hunter Denjai]].
*[[Chieftain Mummaki's Totem]]

==Description==
Wanted: [[Chieftain Mummaki]] - leader of the foul and degenerate [[Lost One]] tribe of the [[Daggerfen]], for his brutal attacks against [[Zabra'jin]] and its inhabitants.

The chieftain and his band of [[assassin]]s are responsible for the deaths of numerous [[scout]]s and messengers and should only be approached by seasoned combatants.

Travelers are advised to avoid the [[Daggerfen Village]] area to the northwest of Zabra'jin.

To claim the bounty, present proof of the chietain's demise to [[Shadow Hunter Denjai]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|20}}
*10750 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
So you wish to claim the bounty on Chieftain Mummaki?

==Completion==
You have my thanks, <name>. I was beginning to think that I was going to have to take a substantial part of the garrison up there and deal with Mummaki myself. Of course, there's no telling what might have happened to Zabra'jin then.

==Notes==
