'''Uncatalogued Species''' is the initial turning for the repeatable faction grind quest for the [[Cenarion Expedition]].

==Objectives==
Bring 10 Unidentified Plant Parts to [[Lauranna Thar'well]] at the [[Cenarion Refuge]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].
* [[Unidentified Plant Parts]] (10)

==Description==
The lakes of Zangarmarsh are slowly being drained of their water. We don't quite know why, but we do know that many plants species are in danger of becoming extinct.

As the [[Cenarion Expedition|expedition's]] cataloguer, it is my job to track and identify these plants so we can better understand what's happening to them.

If you'd like to help, bring me unidentified plant parts. They can be picked right from the ground if you're an herbalist, and the indigenous creatures of the swamp may also carry plant parts on them.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
* [[Package of Identified Plants]]
*6250 [[XP]]
*+ 250 reputation with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you find any plant parts, <name>? 

==Completion==
The decrease in native species is certainly a cause for concern. The increase in invasive species could be related to the recent disturbance in the ecosystem. I don't have enough information to make a conclusion, yet. 

<Lauranna jots down some notes on a journal as she goes through the plant parts.> 

Take these, <name>. They might be of some use to you. 

Bring me any other plant parts you find. I'll incorporate them into my statistics.

==Notes==
The [[Unidentified Plant Parts]] drop from mobs around [[Zangarmarsh]], but can also be found when harvesting herbs.
