'''Angling to Beat the Competition''' pits you up against the angler's worst nightmare: the underwater competition.

Consider performing this quest alongside [[Thick Hydra Scales]] for [[Zurai]] in [[Swamprat Post]] as the scales he needs are found on the Hydras [[Zurjaya]] wants dead.

==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Fenclaw Thrasher]]s and return to [[Zurjaya]] in [[Zabra'jin]].
*[[Potion of Water Breathing]] (provided)

==Description==
It's a relief to be in someplace with water after trekking through the wasteland of [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. I was worried there might not be any respectable fishing holes in [[Outland]].

Now I'm glad I lugged my fishing supplies along. For the most part, the fishing's been good, except for those no good fenclaw thrashers in [[Serpent Lake]].

Not only do they scare the fish away, but they're bold enough to snap the bait right off my hook. I spend more time re-baiting the hook than I do catching anything!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|10}}
* +250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Is it safe for me to fish again?

==Completion==
I can't wait to return to fishing!  Now I'll be able to return to town with some real fish in my bucket and [[Gambarinka]] won't be able to make fun of me anymore!
