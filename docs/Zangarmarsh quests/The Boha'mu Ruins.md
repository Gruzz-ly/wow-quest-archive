==Objectives==
[[Anchorite Ahuurn]] at [[Telredor]] wants you to explore the Boha'mu Ruins.
*Explore the [[Boha'mu Ruins]]{{coords|44|68|Zangarmarsh}}

==Description==
Before my people were decimated by the [[orc]]s, [[Telredor]] served as a retreat for [[draenei]] [[anchorite]]s and spiritualists. A small order of anchorites and [[vindicator]]s maintained a number of shrines in this region.

During the [[Genocide of the draenei|war]], we lost contact with the anchorites assigned to the shrines, particularly the Boha'mu temple to the southwest. I've heard reports that a [[tribe]] of [[Lost Ones]] has settled in the area and may even be using the ruins. Visit the [[Boha'mu Ruins]] and tell me of what you find there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Have you examined the Boha'mu Ruins? Can you imagine what they were like in their full splendor?

==Completion==
So, the [[Feralfen]] Lost Ones have taken over the ruins? Most intriguing. They must remember something of their heritage and the significance of the site. We must learn more, <name>. This temple could hold the key to redeeming the Lost Ones and reuniting the many threads of draenei.

==Progression==
