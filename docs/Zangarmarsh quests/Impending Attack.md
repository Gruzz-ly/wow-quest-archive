==Objectives==
Bring the [[Ango'rosh Attack Plans]] to [[Shadow Hunter Denjai]] in [[Zabra'jin]]. 
*[[Ango'rosh Attack Plans]]

==Description==
The position of the [[ogre]]s' mushroom-cutting operation can't be an accident. I can't escape the suspicion that they're preparing for an attack on [[Zabra'jin]].

I must know for certain, <name>. The ogres have another outpost to the northwest, the [[Ango'rosh Grounds|Ango'rosh Camp]]. If they're staging for an attack, there will be evidence of their plans there. Go there, <name> and search the camp for signs of their intentions. Return to me with anything that might be suspicious.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you found proof of the ogres' intentions?

==Completion==
<Shadow Hunter Denjai examines the plans.>

I knew it! The stench of ogres always carries an implicit threat. Now that we have proof of their intentions, we must act before they do.
