==Objectives==
Slay 10 Marsh Dredgers and 10 Marsh Lurkers, and then return to [[Lauranna Thar'well]] at the [[Cenarion Refuge]] in [[Zangarmarsh]]. 
*[[Marsh Lurker]] slain (10)
*[[Marsh Dredger]] slain (10)

==Description==
[[Ikeyen]]'s been telling me stories about what happened to him down in those caves and I think it's just awful!

You know, maybe we should do something to help out those poor [[sporelok]]s. Ikeyen says that they live there in the [[Funggor Cavern]], but that the [[marsh beast]]s have recently invaded.

Why don't you go down there and see if you can clear some of those marsh beasts out? It's just to the southwest.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Circle's Stalwart Helmet|Expedition Forager Leggings|Chemise of Rebirth|Scout's Hood}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]
*+15 [[reputation]] with [[Sporeggar]] for each quest kill

==Progress==
What? Back so soon? How did it go?

==Completion==
Good!  Those marsh beasts have no right to invade the home of the sporeloks!

It would be better if these creatures would learn to live in harmony, but when that's not possible, we'll be here to take care of the situation!

Here, please take one of these as thanks for your help.
