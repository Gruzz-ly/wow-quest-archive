'''The Respect of Another''' is about a boy and a girl and a gigantic wasp.

==Objectives==
Bring [[Blacksting's Stinger]] to [[Reavij]] at [[Swamprat Post]].
*[[Blacksting's Stinger]]

==Description==
[[Magasha]] is the fiercest [[troll]] in the Marsh, but she only respects mighty hunters. I tried to prove myself to her, but the one beast that could impress her is beyond my skill. Maybe you could help me out? It's the giant bog wasp known as [[Blacksting]] that roams the area south of the glowing draenei towers to the west. If you bring me its stinger maybe she'll give me a chance to join her hunters. I know it's a little sneaky, but I promise to learn under her and do ya both proud.

==Rewards==
You may choose one of the following:
{{itembox| |Blacksting Shoulders|Blacksting Gloves|Stalwart Girdle|Marshfang Boots}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70}}
* 10050 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
My luck is about to change - I can feel it. 

==Completion==
Fantastic! I'll never forget how you helped me to win her heart. In fact, you can be a guest of honor at our wedding.  

==Notes==
Blacksting spawns on the northeast side of [[Feralfen Village]] around location 50,59. It has a debuff that it uses called "Black Blood" which prevents stealth, lowers stats by 10%, and lowers damage taken by 10%. It also turns your character almost completely black.
