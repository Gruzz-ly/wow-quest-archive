==Objectives==
Kill 10 Marshfang Rippers and return to [[Noraani]] at [[Telredor]]. 
*[[Marshfang Ripper]] slain (10)

==Description==
During the [[orc]]s' [[Genocide of the draenei|war]] against my people, gatherers rarely left Telredor for fear of being attacked or captured. Now, we venture out more often, but [[Zangarmarsh|the marsh]] is no less perilous.

It seems that the [[nether ray]]s have grown bolder in recent months. I don't know if it has something to do with more competition for their normal prey, but they've been attacking our foraging parties on a regular basis. If we can thin their ranks in the area around Telredor, perhaps they would learn to leave us alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Have you been successful in your marshfang hunt?

==Completion==
Thank you for your help in clearing out some of the marshfang rippers, <name>. If they had any intelligence, perhaps they'd learn that it's best to live and let live.

<Noraani shrugs.>

Giant, overgrown bugs with intelligence. I wonder what that would be like...
