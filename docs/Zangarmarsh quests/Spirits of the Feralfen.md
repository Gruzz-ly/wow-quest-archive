==Objectives==
Bring 10 Feralfen Protection Totems to [[Seer Janidi]] at [[Zabra'jin]].
*[[Feralfen Protection Totem]] (10)

==Description==
The most powerful [[tribe]] of [[Lost Ones]] in [[Zangarmarsh|the marsh]], the [[Feralfen]], are said to possess powerful medicine. There may be no truth to such rumors, but anything that might help me channel the [[Ghost|spirits]] of [[Outland|this world]] cannot be ignored.

Find the [[Feralfen Mystic|Feralfen mystics]], [[Feralfen Hunter|hunters]] and [[Feralfen Druid|druids]], <name>, and capture their [[totem]]s. Everything I need to know should be apparent from the carvings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered those totems?

==Completion==
Hmm... They seem to be divided between images of a [[serpent]] spirit and a [[bird]] spirit. No self-respecting [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]] [[Jungle troll|troll]] engages in bird worship. Their spirits are weak, capricious, and best left to the [[Amani tribe|Amani]].

But the serpent, <name>, the serpent wields considerable power and this is the spirit I shall study.
