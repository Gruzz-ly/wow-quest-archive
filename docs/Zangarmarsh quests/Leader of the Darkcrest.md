*[[Rajah Haghazed]]{{co|65|69|Zangarmarsh}} slain

==Description==
A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajah Haghazed, leader of the [[Darkcrest tribe|Darkcrest]] [[naga]]. Haghazed was last sighted by Cenarion [[scout]]s at the Lagoon, in the central southern region of [[Zangarmarsh]].

The Darkcrest have been linked to numerous attacks against the Cenarion Expedition and their leader is considered extremely dangerous.

Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Expedition Mantle|Hearty Cenarion Cincture|Swift Cenarion Footwear|Cushy Cenarion Walkers}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|20|}}
*13350 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|42|}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
You want to talk about the bounty for Haghazed? Well, is he dead? There isn't much else to talk about!

==Completion==
I didn't like the naga in [[Azeroth]] and I like them less here.  It's a real shame our mission could not remain a peaceful one, but you won't see me shedding tears for dead naga.

Here's your reward for taking care of the Darkcrest leader, <name>.
