==Objectives==
Bring [[Blacksting's Stinger]] to [[Prospector Conall]] at [[Telredor]].
*[[Blacksting's Stinger]]

==Description==
By [[Khaz'goroth]]'s flaming navel, it's hot here! I can't blame the first party for leaving, but everyone knows 'twasn't the heat that drove them away. No, it was [[Blacksting]], although they won't admit it.

They were camped just to the south of the glowing [[draenei]] towers to the west, just north of the [[Feralfen Village]], when the giant wasp appears out of nowhere and attacks! I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when I bring the creature's stinger back to [[Ironforge]] and show it to them!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Blacksting Shoulders|Stalwart Girdle|Blacksting Gloves|Marshfang Boots}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Did you manage to get the stinger? Remember, it's useless to me if it's damaged.

==Completion==
I can't thank you enough, lad. I'm going to enjoy this...
