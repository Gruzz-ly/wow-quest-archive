Seek out Warden Moi'bff Jill and tell him you have earned my trust.

;Completion
I'm flattered that your Broken friend considers me a scholar of his people's relics, but to be honest, I haven't had much chance to study them since my arrival here. It was certainly my intent, but when I arrived, I found that there were other matters that required my attention.
