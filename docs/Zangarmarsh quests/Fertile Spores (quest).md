==Objectives==
[[Gshaff]] wants you to gather 6 [[Fertile Spores]] from the various [[Zangarmarsh]] [[Spore Bat]]s and [[Marsh Walker]]s. Return to [[Gshaff]] at [[Sporeggar (town)|Sporeggar]] when you've completed this task.
* [[Fertile Spores]] (6)

==Description==
Spore bats and marsh walkers accumulate fertile spores on their appendages from wandering around the tallstalk mushrooms in the marsh.

As you can see, we're a short people so our options for gathering these spores are limited. Seek out the spore bats and marsh walkers and gather the fertile spores. All of Sporeggar will be in your debt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Glowcap]]
* 10750 experience (or {{cost|5|16}} at level 70)
*+750 reputation with [[Sporeggar]]

==Progress==
You're back, <name>.  Did you obtain the fertile spores?

==Completion==
These are great spores, <name>!  Tallstalks are vital to rebuilding our town.  And after all the bog lord attacks we've suffered, we're in quite the short supply.
