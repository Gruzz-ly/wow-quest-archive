==Objectives==
[[Ysiel Windsinger]] wants you to use the Stormcrow Amulet to explore the major lakes in [[Zangarmarsh]]. 
*Lakes of Zangarmarsh Explored
*[[Stormcrow Amulet]] (provided)

==Description==
We must determine how widespread the [[naga]]'s activity truly is and react accordingly.

Exploring each body of water in [[Zangarmarsh]] could be a lengthy undertaking. If you allow me to, I will use my [[magic]] to mold your shape to one more suited to scouting the marsh.

Hold this amulet above the balcony near me when you're ready to begin. I will guide your way back to safety after we're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*7800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|82|}} at level 70)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Hail, <name>.

==Completion==
It is as I suspected.  The naga have set up pumping stations at all the major lakes in Zangarmarsh.

They must be stopped if the marsh is to have a future.

==Notes==
You will need to stand on the balcony where Ysiel is to use the amulet.

;When Ysiel flies you over the steam pump at [[the Lagoon]]
:{{text|whisper|Ysiel Windsinger|It's just like the structure you described at [[Umbrafen Lake]]. Does this mean the naga are pumping water out of all the lakes in Zangarmarsh?}}
:{{text|whisper|Ysiel Windsinger|The naga are even pumping the water out of their own lake!  What purpose could that possibly serve?}}
:{{text|whisper|Ysiel Windsinger|There!  Those pipes all appear to be connected to that structure.  It can't possibly fit all the water they've been stealing.  Where are they keeping it?}}
:{{text|whisper|Ysiel Windsinger|What we saw explains what happened in the [[Dead Mire]].  There was a lake here once.  If we don't stop the naga, all of the marsh will soon look like this!}}
