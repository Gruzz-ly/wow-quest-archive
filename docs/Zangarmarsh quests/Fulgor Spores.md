==Objectives==
Bring 6 Fulgor Spores to [[Ruam]] at [[Telredor]].
*[[Fulgor Spore]] (6)

==Description==
There is little in this swamp that will burn, <race>, so we must resort to other means for lighting Telredor. Many of the creatures and plants in the marsh emit a soft glow.

It's difficult and cruel to confine the glowing creatures, so we've turned to a species of mushroom for our light source.

We pick and cultivate the fulgor mushroom here, but our needs require us to gather new crops occasionally. The small green mushrooms often grow at the base of larger ones near Telredor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
From the looks of things, we'll need to replenish our spores soon.

==Completion==
These are good spores and they should keep us going for quite some time. Thank you for helping us to replenish our supplies, <name>.

==Patch changes==
