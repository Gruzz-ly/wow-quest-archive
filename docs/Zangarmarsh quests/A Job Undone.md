Reavij left '''A Job Undone''' and Magasha has to clean up after him.

==Objectives==
[[Magasha]] at [[Swamprat Post]] wants you to kill Sporewing.
*[[Sporewing]] slain

==Description==
Someone needs to find a way to make [[Reavij]] come to his senses! He's ignoring his duty and instead, he's devoting all his energy to getting my attention. I've tried ignoring him and telling him to stop. Nothing seems to work.

Until he gets over this, I'm left cleaning up after him. He was supposed to have dealt with Sporewing, but I'll bet the monster is alive and well. If you have time, would you mind going to the western part of the [[Dead Mire]] and killing the bat? I'll deal with Reavij in the meantime.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|q=5|Scroll of Agility VI
|q2=5|Scroll of Intellect VI
|q3=5|Scroll of Protection VI
|q4=5|Scroll of Versatility VI
|q5=5|Scroll of Stamina VI
|q6=5|Scroll of Strength VI
}}

You will also receive:
*10050 XP
*{{cost|2|70}}

{{Classic only-section|tbc}}
You may choose one of the following:
*5 [[Scroll of Agility V]]
*5 [[Scroll of Strength V]]
*5 [[Scroll of Intellect V]]
*5 [[Scroll of Stamina V]]
*5 [[Scroll of Spirit V]]
*5 [[Scroll of Protection V]]

==Progress==
There's no changing his mind, I swear. I think I'm going to have to ask [[Shadow Hunter Denjai]] for a transfer back to [[Zabra'jin]].

==Completion==
At least someone is pulling his weight around here. Thank you for taking care of that matter, <name>. I need to have a word with [[Zurai]] about Reavij. His scheming and daydreaming have gone on long enough.

==Notes==
Sporewing spawns to the southwest of the Dead Mire, west of the pumping equipment (location 76,45). It occasionally releases a nature-based spore cloud that lowers your armor by 15% and does periodic poison damage.
