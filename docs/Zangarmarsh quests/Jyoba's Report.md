==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Scout Jyoba's Report]] from the [[Withered Giant]]s and return it to [[Zurai]] at [[Swamprat Post]].
*[[Scout Jyoba's Report]]

==Description==
Flecks of withered fungus dot the body of [[Scout Jyoba]]. Whatever killed him must've been made of the same dying fungus as the giant wilting mushrooms of the [[Dead Mire]]. Perhaps one of the withered giants caught him by surprise as he sat writing his report.

Without the text of the report, it's nearly impossible to tell what the [[scout]] discovered. If the report can be found, it should be returned to [[Zurai]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Bog Walker's Bands|Murk-Darkened Bracers|Bog Walker's Belt|Deep Mire Cloak}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
You're back, but Jyoba's not with you. What became of him?

==Completion==
<Zurai accepts the report from you and glances over it.>

Much of this is information we already know. Everything in the area seems to be dried or wilting, but here's something new.

He says the [[fungal giant]]s seem to have gone berserk from the lack of moisture. From your description, that must be what killed him.

I'll instruct my men to avoid the area. We can't afford any more casualties.
