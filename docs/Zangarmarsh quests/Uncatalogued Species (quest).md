'''Uncatalogued Species''' is the initial turn in for the repeatable faction grind quest for the [[Cenarion Expedition]]. Found inside [[Package of Identified Plants]], but has a low drop rate.

==Objectives==
Bring the Uncatalogued Species to [[Lauranna Thar'well]] at the [[Cenarion Refuge]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].
*[[Uncatalogued Species]] (provided)

==Description==
Lauranna must've missed this particular plant. You're certain you've discovered a species not yet catalogued by Lauranna's work. You'd best show it to her to see what she makes of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*500 reputation with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
You have something to show me?

==Completion==
A new species!  Are you sure?

Nice job, <name>.  We'll have to add this one to our list.  How does "Purple Leafed <Name>rium" sound to you?  It does have a ring to it.
