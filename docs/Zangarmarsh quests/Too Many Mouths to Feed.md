==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Mire Hydra]] and return to [[Haalrun]] at [[Telredor]]. 
*[[Mire Hydra]] slain (10)
*[[Potion of Water Breathing]] (provided)

==Description==
On my last hunting trip, I caught sight of a new outpost being built by a [[Darkspear tribe|group]] of [[Jungle troll|trolls]]. No doubt they've begun hunting these lands, too.

If they establish a permanent presence out here, the competition for food will be fierce. We cannot take direct action against them without provocation, but we can remove some of the natural competition for food.

For each mire hydra you kill, that's three fewer mouths to feed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt, friend?

==Completion==
Well done. That should ease the demand on the food supply around here for the immediate future, although we're going to need to find new sources of food. Fish and mushrooms suffice, but variety can never be underestimated.
