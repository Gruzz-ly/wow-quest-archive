'''Warning the Cenarion Circle''' is a simple travel quest where the player must speak to [[Amythiel Mistwalker]] at [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. It can be picked up from [[Ysiel Windsinger]] at 78,62 in [[Zangarmarsh]].  It is completed with Amythiel Mistwalker at 16,52 in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Amythiel Mistwalker]] at [[Cenarion Post]] in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

==Description==
The [[Cenarion Expedition]] has become a large [[organization]] with a good degree of autonomy. These events are important enough that we need to warn the [[Cenarion Circle]].

Do not worry, I will not ask you to travel back to [[Moonglade]]; we have emissaries as nearby as Hellfire Peninsula.

==Rewards==
You will be rewarded with:
*{{cost|1|60}}
*4300 XP
*+75 [[reputation]] with Cenarion Expedition

==Completion==
The news you bring about the [[naga]] activity in Zangarmarsh is dire. Ysiel was wise in sending word to us. She hasn't forgotten that the Expedition cannot exist without the Circle's support. 

==Progression==
{{Failed Incursion}}

==Patch changes==
