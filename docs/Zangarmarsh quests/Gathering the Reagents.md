==Objectives==
[[Anchorite Ahuurn]] at [[Telredor]] wants you to bring him 4 Sporebat Eyes and 4 Fen Strider Tentacles.
*[[Sporebat Eye]] (4)
*[[Fen Strider Tentacle]] (4)

==Description==
I have a feeling that these [[Lost Ones]] may not respond well to a [[draenei]], but would welcome an [[arakkoa]]. I can create a potion that will allow you to take on the form of an arakkoa for a short time. It requires a couple of reagents which cannot be stored and must be used within hours of being gathered.

You will need to bring me a handful of [[Spore Bat]] Eyes and some [[Fen Strider]] Tentacles. Both species dwell in the wilderness surrounding Telredor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|70}}
* 10050 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the reagents?

==Completion==
These will do quite nicely. Allow me a moment to mix up the potion.

==Progression==
{{Messenger to the Feralfen}}
