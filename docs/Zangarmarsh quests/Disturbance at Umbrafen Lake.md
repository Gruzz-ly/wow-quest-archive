==Objectives==
Investigate the cause of the water depletion at Umbrafen Lake. Then return to [[Ysiel Windsinger]] at the [[Cenarion Refuge]] in [[Zangarmarsh]]. 
*[[Umbrafen Lake]] Investigated

==Description==
We came to [[Outland]] expecting to find small pockets of life. What we discovered in Zangarmarsh was a lush environment with a thriving ecosystem.

Our initial assessment of the area was deceiving, however. The water levels at the lakes and marshes have consistently been going down since we started taking measurements.

The impact this could have on the local animal and plant life is disastrous. Go to Umbrafen Lake, southwest of here, and look for clues related to this water depletion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you discover anything, <name>?

==Completion==
The naga are behind this!  But why?  From what you describe, that steam pump must be part of the cause for the water levels dropping in the marsh!

No matter - this explains their open hostility towards us.  Let's not waste any time, I need you to perform another task for us.
