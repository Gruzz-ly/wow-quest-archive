==Objectives==
Bring 10 Glowcaps to [[Msshi'fn]] at [[Sporeggar (town)|Sporeggar]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].
* [[Glowcap]] (10)

==Description==
I've seen your kind use shiny round pieces of metal to trade for things that you need. We're not so different from you. We use shiny round mushrooms as our currency.

Glowcap mushrooms grow everywhere in the marsh, you just have to know how to pick them from the ground without wrecking them. I'll teach you how to do it, if you promise to bring us some for our reserves. What do you say, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10750 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Sporeggar]]

==Progress==
Did you find any glowcaps, <name>?  They're literally everywhere in the marsh.

You can spot their bright glow from far away if you pay attention.

==Completion==
This will help us trade with other [[sporeling]]s for food and supplies. Sporeggar thanks you, <name>!

==Notes==
Requires neutral reputation with [[Sporeggar]].

This quest is repeatable: For the repeatable version you still need to bring 10 [[Glowcap]]s and get 750 reputation points with [[Sporeggar]].

Only repeatable up to Friendly; once Friendly, you will not even be able to see the initial turning quest.
