==Objectives==
[[Noraani]] at [[Telredor]] wants you to bring her 8 Eel Filets. 
*[[Eel Filet]] (8)
*[[Potion of Water Breathing]] (provided)

==Description==
It's good to see another fresh face here. When [[Haalrun]] and I first came to Telredor, we were the only outsiders, but that seems like a lifetime ago.

Still, we try to welcome newcomers and ensure that there's always enough food and supplies. We can never fully repay the kindness of the Telredor [[anchorite]]s, but we can follow their example and extend it to others.

If you would like to help, the nearby lakes are populated with a fish called the [[Umbrafen Eel|Umbrafen eel]], whose meat is a staple of our diet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Have you any fish to contribute to our stores?

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>. Your generosity will not be forgotten. As a token of my gratitude, I've prepared a hot drink for you.
