==Objectives==
Slay 3 Daggerfen Assassins and 15 Daggerfen Muckdwellers.
*[[Daggerfen Assassin]] slain (3)
*[[Daggerfen Muckdweller]] slain (15)

==Description==
The [[Kurenai]] and the [[draenei]] don't always see eye to eye, particularly on the issue of the [[Lost One]]s. We are content to help the Lost Ones who seek us out, but we won't pursue them. Some draenei are intent on 'redeeming' them all.

However, there are times when even the Lost Ones go too far, such as the [[Daggerfen tribe|Daggerfen]]. In [[Daggerfen Village|their village]] to the west, they dabble in poisons and deceit, arts that come unnaturally to us.

We must put an end to this before the vile Daggerfen can extend their influence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|3|10}}
* 10750 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
Have you seen what the Daggerfen have done? Now you understand why we must isolate them from the other Lost Ones.

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>. The Daggerfen are beyond redemption by anyone's standards, but I'm not certain that the draenei would've acted with the proper speed in this situation.
