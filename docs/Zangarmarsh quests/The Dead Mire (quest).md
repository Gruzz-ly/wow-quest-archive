==Objectives==
Bring a [[Dead Mire Soil Sample]] to [[Vindicator Idaar]] at [[Telredor]]. 
*[[Dead Mire Soil Sample]]

==Description==
I have lived among the [[anchorite]]s of Telredor for some time, <name>, and in that time I've come to know the marsh quite well. Recently, I've started to notice a disturbing change in the land to the northeast.

Virtually all life there has begun to wither and die, seemingly without explanation. I have a few ideas as to what might be happening, but they are little more than speculation. If you were to bring me a sample of the soil in that area, I may be able to get to the bottom of this mystery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Were you able to get a sample of the soil in the [[Dead Mire]]?

==Completion==
Hmm... The soil seems to be depleted, so it can't be the cause of the problem, as I'd thought. What's the common link here? Why is everything suddenly dying?
