# Zangarmarsh questing guide

This is a questing guide detailing the best method to obtain and complete quests in [[Zangarmarsh]].

For a list of all [[Zangarmarsh]] quests in table format (arranged by level), see [[Zangarmarsh quests]].

[[Image:Icon-warning-22x22.png|Note]] '''Note''': This guide is not meant for power-leveling purposes. Rather, it is meant to show a player the most efficient way to complete all quests available for a particular zone. If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the '''[[Talk:Zangarmarsh questing guide|talk page]]''' as to your reasoning.

=== {{Horde_Icon}} Horde Questing Guide (LVL 62-65)===

Although this guide is designed for the horde, there is a great deal of overlap. In addition, more than half the quests (including the [[Cenarion Expedition]] and [[Sporeggar]] are neutral. This guide does not point out the extremely obvious (that you should turn in as many quests as you can at a given time) and does not include messenger quests (other than ones that lead you to Zangarmarsh). All the quests are listed in order of how the chain can be completed, so as long as you complete each step in order, you shouldn't have to worry about missing pre-requisites. This guide also does not include any class or profession-specific quests. 

== Before You Leave ==
Before heading to [[Zangarmarsh]], it would be a good idea to wrap up [[Hellfire Peninsula]]. There are a few quests that lead you to Zangarmarsh which bear mentioning.


{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Arelion's Mistress]]
| {{RaceIcon|BloodElf|Female}}{{NPC|Horde|Magistrix Carinda}}
| [[Hellfire Peninsula]] - [[Falcon Watch]]
|-
| [[The Cenarion Expedition (quest)]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Amythiel Mistwalker}}
| [[Hellfire Peninsula]] - [[Cenarion Post]]
|-
| [[Report to Zurai]]
| {{RaceIcon|BloodElf|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Ranger Captain Venn'ren}}
| [[Hellfire Peninsula]] - [[Falcon Watch]]
|}
These three are easy to come by, [[quest|Arelion's Mistress]] is the only one part of a chain (beginning with [[Arelion's Journal]]). The last two are basic message drops to bring you over. 



== Getting There ==
Head directly west out of [[Hellfire Peninsula]] and you will find yourself in Zangarmarsh. You can pick up a flight path in [[Swamprat Post]] as well as the first series of quests. You'll also want to head just south to [[Cenarion Refuge]].

==Umbrafen Lake Quests==
The first main area with quests in [[Umbrafen Lake]], south-west of [[Cenarion Expedition]]. There are a number of quests available that can all be done in one run.

{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name

|-
| [[Menacing Marshfangs (Horde)]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Reavij}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Swamprat Post]]
|-
| [[There's No Explanation for Fashion]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Female}}{{NPC|Horde|Magasha}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Swamprat Post]]
|-
| [[No More Mushrooms!]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Female}}{{NPC|Horde|Magasha}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Swamprat Post]]
|-
| [[Thick Hydra Scales]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Zurai}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Swamprat Post]]
|-
| [[Disturbance at Umbrafen Lake]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Ysiel Windsinger}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[The Umbrafen Tribe]]
| {{RaceIcon|Broken|Male}}{{NPC|Neutral|Ikeyen}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[The Dying Balance]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Male}}{{NPC|Neutral|Lethyn Moonfire}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[Plants of Zangarmarsh]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Lauranna Thar'well}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[A Warm Welcome]]
| {{RaceIcon|Tauren|Male}}{{NPC|Neutral|Warden Hamoot}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|}

While you could complete all of these quests on a single run, there are a few that you can keep working on since you will run across their goals later on as well. These are: [[Thick Hydra Scales|Thick Hydra Scales]],  [[Plants of Zangarmarsh|Plants of Zangarmarsh]], [[There's No Explanation for Fashion|There's No Explanation for Fashion]] and [[A Warm Welcome]].


If you can wrap up in the Umbrafen Village, you can finish by picking up [[Escape from Umbrafen|Escape from Umbrafen]], since it takes you pretty much back to the Cenarion Expedition for unloading and turn-in.

==Back at the Cenarion Expedition==
{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[As the Crow Flies]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Ysiel Windsinger}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[Blessings of the Ancients]]
| {{RaceIcon|Tauren|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Windcaller Blackhoof}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|}

The latter requires friendly reputation with the Cenarion Expedition which you should have at this point, but both can be completed immediately and don't require you to leave town (technically you fly away, but you come back).


==The Southern Lakes and Funggor Cavern==

{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Balance Must Be Preserved]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Ysiel Windsinger}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[Leader of the Darkcrest]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Wanted Poster}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[A Damp, Dark Place]]
| {{RaceIcon|Broken|Male}}{{NPC|Neutral|Ikeyen}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[Saving the Sporeloks]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Lauranna Thar'well}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[Safeguarding the Watchers]]
| {{RaceIcon|Tauren|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Windcaller Blackhoof}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|}

This run has you going back to the steam pump at [[Umbrafen Lake]], then on to [[The Lagoon]], and finishing down in [[Funggor Cavern]]. All of these quests can be completed on one run, and should be. You will need to finish [[Thick Hydra Scales|Thick Hydra Scales]] before the next run.

==Dead Mire and Eastern Serpent Lake==

{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Searching for Scout Jyoba]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Reavij}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Swamprat Post]]
|-
| [[A Job Undone]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Female}}{{NPC|Horde|Magasha}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Swamprat Post]]
|-
| [[Leader of the Bloodscale]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Wanted Poster}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|}

This run will send you north, to the [[Dead Mire]] and the eastern side of [[Serpent Lake]]. This leg can be a little tricky- Here are some additional notes:

[[Searching for Scout Jyoba|Searching for Scout Jyoba]]: Once you've found his body, he will give you a follow-up quest, [[Jyoba's Report|Jyoba's Report]]. You must then kill [[Withered Giant]]s until his report drops (usually pretty fast). They will also drop randomly a quick quest called [[Withered Basidium (Horde)|Withered Basidium]].

[[Drain Schematics]]: If this didn't drop for you already, it will probably drop off the [[Bloodscale Overseer]]s.

==Feralfen Ridge and the West end of the Lagoon==
It's time to head towards Zubra'jin.

{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[The Respect of Another]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Reavij}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Swamprat Post]]
|-
| [[Spirits of the Feralfen]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Female}}{{NPC|Horde|Seer Janidi}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|}
These two are pretty straight forward.

==Spawning Glen and Quagg Ridge==
... and get started on those loveable little mushrooms, the [[Sporeling]]s.


{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon!]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Witch Doctor Tor'gash}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|-
| [[Observing the Sporelings]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Watcher Leesa'oh}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Quagg Ridge]]
|-
| [[The Sporelings' Plight]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Fahssn}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Spawning Glen]]
|-
| [[Natural Enemies]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Fahssn}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Spawning Glen]]
|}
The first quest, [[Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon!|Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon!]] is a gathering quest that doesn't have to be complete until you head to [[Daggerfen Village]]. The final two are repeatable if you want to get reputation with Sporeggar (which isn't too hard- just collect [[Bog Lord Tendril]]s and [[Mature Spore Sac]]s).

Once you've completed [[Observing the Sporelings|Observing the Sporelings]] then do...

{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[A Question of Gluttony]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Watcher Leesa'oh}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Quagg Ridge]]
|-
| [[A Spirit Ally?]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Female}}{{NPC|Horde|Seer Janidi}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|}

You will probably run into [["Count" Ungula]], which can give you [[The Count of the Marshes|The Count of the Marshes]], which also turns in to [[Watcher Leesa'oh]]. [[A Spirit Ally?|A Spirit Ally?]] takes you back to [[Feralfen Village]], but you can skirt along the southern edge and keep engagements to a minimum.

==Western Serpent Lake and Hewn Bog==

{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Drain Schematics (quest)]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Ysiel Windsinger}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[Angling to Beat the Competition]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Female}}{{NPC|Horde|Zurjaya}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|-
| [[Familiar Fungi]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Watcher Leesa'oh}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Quagg Ridge]]
|-
| [[WANTED: Boss Grog'ak]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Wanted Poster}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|}
You'll take a nice swim into [[Serpent Lake]], and in the center you can check out the big drain and kill some more hydras. After that, stroll over to the Ogres and finish them up.

==Optional Side Run: Back to Hellfire Peninsula==
Completing [[Drain Schematics (quest)|Drain Schematics]] means you can go back to the [[Cenarion Refuge]] in Hellfire Peninsula. You can also grab a bottle of [[Cenarion Spirits]] and wrap up [[Arelion's Mistress|Arelion's Mistress]] in [[Falcon Watch]]. Drain Schematics eventually leads to the [[Lost in Action|Lost in Action quest]], but is not a prerequisite. In [[Cenarion Refuge]] you'll get [[Return to the Marsh|Return to the Marsh]] which will send you back and get you the next step.




==Coilfang Reservoir- Slave Pens==
[[Slave Pens]] is the first [[Instance]] in Zangarmarsh, and can be run as early as level 61.  

{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Failed Incursion]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Ysiel Windsinger}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[The Biggest of Them All]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Female}}{{NPC|Horde|Zurjaya}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|}
The two quests are not actually in Slave Pens, but can be done on the way. To finish the Drain Schematic quest line you meet [[Watcher Jhang]] in [[Coilfang Reservoir]]. She gives you the [[Lost in Action|Lost in Action]] which starts in [[Slave Pens]], and is the only available quest in Slave Pens until you come back at [[|Heroic Mode|Heroic]].

==Sporeggar==
You can repeat [[The Sporelings' Plight|The Sporelings' Plight]] and [[Natural Enemies|Natural Enemies]] until you get Neutral with Sporeggar, at which point you can continue with those quests until Friendly, or include these additional quests.
{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Glowcap Mushrooms]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Msshi'fn}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Sporeggar]]
|-
| [[Fertile Spores (quest)]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Gshaff}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Sporeggar]]
|}

You can choose to skip the reputation grind with Sporeggar since the [[Sporeggar|Rewards]] are not overwhelming, but getting to friendly is not too long and opens up two more quests.


==Coilfang Reservoir- Underbog==
 
{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Lost in Action]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Watcher Jhang}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Coilfang Reservoir]]
|-
| [[Bring Me A Shrubbery!]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Gzhun'tt}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Sporeggar]]
|-
| [[Oh, It's On!]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|T'shu}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Sporeggar]]
|-
| [[Stalk the Stalker (BC Classic)]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Khn'nix}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Sporeggar]]
|}
You should have already gotten [[Lost in Action|Lost in Action]] and completed the first half in [[Slave Pens]].[[Bring Me A Shrubbery!|Bring Me A Shrubbery!]] is the only one that requires friendly reputation with [[Sporeggar]]- the other two should be available at neutral.

==Marshlight Lake and Ango'rosh Grounds==
[[Marshlight Lake]] is just east of Zabra'jin, and [[Ango'rosh Grounds]] is just north of the Lake.

{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Pursuing Terrorclaw]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Female}}{{NPC|Horde|Zurjaya}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|-
| [[Balance Must Be Preserved]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Ysiel Windsinger}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Cenarion Expedition]]
|-
| [[Stinging the Stingers]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Gambarinka}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|-
| [[Now That We're Friends...]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Gzhun'tt}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Sporeggar]]
|-
| [[Impending Attack]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Shadow Hunter Denjai}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|-
| [[Fhwoor Smash!]]
| {{NPC|Neutral|Fhwoor}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Sporeggar]]
|}

You should be able to finish [[There's No Explanation for Fashion|There's No Explanation for Fashion]] with the drops from the Stingers if you haven't already.

[[Fhwoor Smash!|Fhwoor Smash!]] requires [[Exalted]] status with Sporeggar.

Turn in at Zabra'jin and Sporeggar. This should also complete all the [[Swamprat Post]] and [[Cenarion Expedition]] quest, so you can turn in there too.

==Daggerfen Village and Ango'rosh Stronghold==


{| class="darktable" width="80%"
! Quest Name
! Quest Giver
! Zone-Subzone
|-
| [[Us or Them]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Shadow Hunter Denjai}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|-
| [[Stealing Back the Mushrooms]]
| {{RaceIcon|NightElf|Female}}{{NPC|Neutral|Watcher Leesa'oh}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Quagg Ridge]]
|-
| [[WANTED: Chieftain Mummaki (Horde)]]
| Wanted Poster
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|-
| [[Message to the Daggerfen]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Shadow Hunter Denjai}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|-
| [[The Sharpest Blades]]
| {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}{{NPC|Horde|Gambarinka}}
| [[Zangarmarsh]] - [[Zabra'jin]]
|}


[[The Sharpest Blades|The Sharpest Blades]] is actually south of Zabra'jin, unlike the rest of this leg which is far to the north. Probably the easiest is to do it on the way back to turn in Watcher Leesa'oh.

Turn in at Watcher Leesa'oh and Zabra'jin. 


Congratulations, you've done all the quest in Zangarmarsh (54 are needed to get the achievement).
