==Objectives==
Speak with [[Mokasa]] at [[Stonebreaker Hold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Description==
[[Shadow Hunter Denjai]] isn't the only one expecting a report from me. Mokasa at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar is eager to hear of our progress, especially since most of her messengers travel through here.

She asked me to send word once [[Swamprat Post]] was completed. If you wouldn't mind delivering the news, I'd be very grateful. We may be up and running, but there is still much to be done.

To get to Stonebreaker Hold, follow the road south out of [[Zangarmarsh]], into Terokkar Forest and beyond [[Tuurem]].

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2550 [[XP]] (or {{cost||60|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
It's about time he got that outpost up and running. We've lost far too many runners to [[Alliance]] [[outrider]]s.

==Notes==
*Accepting this quest will prevent accepting the other breadcrumb, [[News for Rakoria]] from [[Shadow Hunter Denjai]] in [[Zabra'jin]].

==Patch changes==
