==Objectives==
Take [[Vindicator Idaar's Letter]] to [[Andarl]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Vindicator Idaar's Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
Prophet [[Velen]]'s search for allies has emboldened those [[draenei]] remaining in [[Outland]] to begin a search of their own. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s [[Genocide of the draenei|war]] on my people drove us from our cities and temples, but they have not destroyed the traces of our civilization.

[[Tuurem]], my former home in the Terokkar Forest, was one of the first cities overrun by the [[orc]]s. It's been too long since I've received news of its status. Take this letter to Andarl in the Allerian Stronghold within Terokkar and see what you can find out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2550 [[XP]] (or {{cost||60|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
How may I help you?

==Completion==
Hmm... I remember hearing our [[scout]]s speak of the ruins of a draenei settlement in the forest's northern reaches. I don't know much about the ruins, personally, but you're welcome to talk to some of the scouts.
