==Objectives==
I could still use some more plant parts.  With the lakes losing their water, I've a feeling the number of invasive species is on the rise.  I need more numbers to back up my theory, however.
*[[Unidentified Plant Parts]] (10)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]
*[[Package of Identified Plants]]

==Completion==
Excellent.  Keep bringing me more plant parts if you find any.

<This quest is repeatable up to Honored reputation.>

==Notes==
*If you do no other quests for the Cenarion Expedition, it will take 24 turn-ins to get to Honored (22 for Humans). Therefore you never need to stockpile more than 240 [[Unidentified Plant Parts]] for any single character.
