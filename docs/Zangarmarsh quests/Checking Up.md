==Objectives==
Speak with [[Watcher Jhang]] in the [[Slave Pens]].

==Description==
These marshes are beautiful, wouldn't you agree? That is, except for the [[naga]] forces draining the water away.

I sent a small expedition to the [[Coilfang Reservoir]] to investigate the naga, and they haven't returned. I'm concerned that something has happened to them.

Would you travel to the Slave Pens underneath [[Serpent Lake]] and find Watcher Jhang?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|3400}}
*1100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What're you doing all the way down here? As you can see, it isn't exactly safe!

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.3.0|note=Added.}}
