==Objectives==
Collect 10 pieces of [[:Discarded Nutriment]] and then return to [[Watcher Leesa'oh]] at the [[Cenarion Watchpost]] in [[Zangarmarsh]]. 
*[[Discarded Nutriment]] (10)

==Description==
I was wondering why the bog lords were crossing the road to go to the [[Spawning Glen]] - they must be starving for some reason. This just will not do!

I mean, normally I wouldn't get involved, but if they continue to eat all of the sporeling pods they'll wipe them out!

Here's what we'll do: I'll stay here and you head to the [[Quagg Ridge]] to the east and look for dietary clues as to why they're raiding the [[sporeling]]s. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Be sure that you collect all of the evidence carefully, <class>!  We're fitting the pieces of a giant puzzle together here.  A mistake on your part could lead us to the wrong conclusions.

Then where would we be in our understanding of Zangarmarsh's ecology? 

==Completion==
This is what you found?  That's odd.  These husked mushroom remains are both unusual and somehow look familiar.

I have to think on this a moment.  Don't go anywhere!

==Notes==
Pickup green mushrooms, you can find them around Quagg Ridge. The whole area around them is bright green.
