'''No More Mushrooms!''' The trolls at Swamprat Post need something else to eat.

==Objectives==
Gather 8 [[Eel Filet]]s from [[Eel|Umbrafen Eel]]s and bring them to [[Magasha]] at [[Swamprat Post]].
*[[Eel Filet]] (8)
*[[Potion of Water Breathing]] (provided)

==Description==
Mushroom soup, mushroom stew, mushroom sauce!

Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom! It's all there is to eat around here. If you say you're hungry, the cook hands you an axe and tells you to go chop down your dinner!

Well, I'm tired of mushrooms. I've seen fish in the lakes around here. Sure, they look like a nasty piece of work, but they've got to be better than mushrooms!

How much will it cost me to hire you to bring me my first decent meal in weeks?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2}}
*9800 [[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Tell me you haven't come back empty-handed. <name>.

==Completion==
Finally, a break from the monotony of mushrooms! If you didn't smell like fish, I'd hug you.

Let's see how jealous the others get when they smell the meat cooking over the fire.   

==Notes==
*The eels are in [[Umbrafen Lake]] to the southwest, right next to the [[Cenarion Refuge]]. The eels have a nasty nature damage shield that does damage to anything in melee range when the eel is damaged. Some people have found that the level 61 eels have a higher drop rate than the level 60s.
*While you are in the lake, you can also get items for the following quests:
**[[Thick Hydra Scales]] from [[Zurai]] at [[Swamprat Post]]
**[[Plants of Zangarmarsh]] from [[Lauranna Thar'well]] at the [[Cenarion Refuge]]

==Patch changes==
