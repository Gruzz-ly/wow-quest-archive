==Objectives==
Take the [[Feralfen Totem]] to the foot of the stairs at the [[Boha'mu Ruins]] and plant it in the ground. Report your findings to [[Seer Janidi]] at [[Zabra'jin]]. 
*Summon [[Feralfen Serpent Spirit|Serpent Spirit]]
*[[Feralfen Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
We must find out how much power this Feralfen [[snake]] [[Ghost|spirit]] possesses and whether it can be bent to our will. Imagine what I could do with the powers of an [[Outland]] spirit at my command!

Take this [[totem]] with you and make your way to the foot of the stairs leading to the Boha'mu Ruins. Plant the totem in the ground and it should do the rest. The spirit should not be able to tell who has used the totem until it has manifested.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ancient Crystal Talisman|Serpent Spirit's Drape|Marsh Bracers}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Were you able to summon the Feralfen spirit?

==Completion==
<You tell [[Seer Janidi]] about what happened when you used the totem.>

The spirit attacked you? It must have a higher affinity for [[Feralfen tribe|those Lost Ones]] than I'd thought. There's no way to compel it to serve me without expending considerable effort. I'll have to search for a new source of power in this wretched world.
