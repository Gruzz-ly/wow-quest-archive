==Objectives==
[[Prospector Conall]] at [[Telredor]] wants you to kill Sporewing.
*[[Sporewing]] slain

==Description==
The first expedition [[Explorers' Guild|the league]] sent reported encountering a gigantic spore bat they'd taken to calling Sporewing. They had to leave in a hurry, so they didn't have the chance to kill him while they were here, so I figured I'd finish the job for them.

What's left of their report suggests that the creature can be found in the southwestern parts of the [[Dead Mire]]. I think [[Vindicator Idaar]] mentioned that it's to the northeast of Telredor. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*5x [[Scroll of Strength V]]
*5x [[Scroll of Spirit V]]
*5x [[Scroll of Stamina V]]
*5x [[Scroll of Intellect V]]
*5x [[Scroll of Agility V]]
*5x [[Scroll of Protection V]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70}}
*10050 XP
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Did you manage to track down Sporewing?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. I think you and I have managed to outshine a whole team of prospectors. When I get back to [[Ironforge]], I'm sure I'll get my choice of assignments.
