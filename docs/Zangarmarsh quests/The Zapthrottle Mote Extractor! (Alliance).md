==Objectives==
Bring 15 Steam Pump Parts to [[K. Lee Smallfry]] at [[Telredor]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].
*[[Steam Pump Part]] (15)

==Description==
Have you seen the swamp gas? Isn't it just shiny?

It takes a [[:Zapthrottle Mote Extractor]] to suck 'em dry though. I could give you the plans to make one, but I really need some spare parts to fix stuff 'round here.

Last time I checked, there were plenty of parts laying around near the steam pump at the [[Dead Mire]] to the northeast. I think the [[Withered Giant|withered giants]] broke the pump out there.

Shall we help each other out?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You receive|Schematic: Zapthrottle Mote Extractor}}

You will also receive:
*6600 [[XP]] (or {{cost||39|}} at level 80)

==Progress==
You got those parts yet?  I've got a compression coil to fix before [[Anchorite Ahuurn]] starts breathing down my neck!

==Completion==
Shiny!  And really, what engineer ever has enough spare parts just hanging around?  Ooh, maybe I could sell off the extra and buy me some of that [[Tigule's Strawberry Ice Cream]]?!  I just love strawberries!  Do you think they have any around here?

Ok, ok, I guess you've earned this, <name>.  Have fun!

==Notes==
* You need to be at least Level 58 and have [[Engineering]] 305 to pick up the quest
