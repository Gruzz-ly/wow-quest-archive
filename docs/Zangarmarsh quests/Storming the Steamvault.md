==Objectives==
Speak with [[Watcher Jhang]] in the [[Steamvault]].

==Description==
We have not as of yet been able to stop the [[naga]] in the Steamvault, where most of their pumping infrastructure is located.

Thankfully, the expedition I sent there is hard at work trying to change that fact. Will you travel to the Steamvault and offer Watcher Jhang and her crew your aid?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||42}}
*1230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank the stars you're here. We need your help!

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.3.0|note=Added.}}
