==Objectives==
Look for [[Ikeyen's Belongings]] inside a cave south of [[Umbrafen]]. Return them to [[Ikeyen]] at [[Cenarion Refuge]] in [[Zangarmarsh]].
*[[Ikeyen's Belongings]]

==Description==
Soon after I escaped the [[Umbrafen tribe]], I holed up in a cave south of their village. Little did I know that the cave was being fought over by marsh beasts and spore men!

I had to leave in a hurry and left behind a box containing my only worldly possessions.

After managing to sneak out of Umbrafen with my belongings it was terrible irony that I would lose them so soon after. If you're willing to bring them back to me I'll give you one of my very own personal items. What do you say, <name>?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ikeyen's Pauldrons|Mud Encrusted Boots|Ikeyen's Boots|Refuge Armor}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you find my belongings, <name>?  The cave is not far from Umbrafen, near the border with [[Nagrand]].

==Completion==
My things!  They're all here!

I thank you, <name>.  As promised, I'll let you pick one of the items for yourself.  I don't have much to offer, but my people have always shared what little we have.
