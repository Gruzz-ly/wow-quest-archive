==Objectives==
Assist Kerchunk in her search for 24 Salvageable Scrap
*Escort [[Recycler Kerchunk|Kerchunk]] as he searches the beach (0/100%)
*[[Salvageable Scrap]] (24)

==Description==
There's a peculiar [[Mechagon mechagnome|mechanical gnome]] scouring the beach nearby for valuable scrap metals. I am concerned for his safety but also intrigued. I just wonder what he's trying to find!

Maybe he would be willing to share anything he finds in exchange for your assistance...

Could you aid him in recovering any valuable items?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
Have you found any Salvageable Scrap? I'm looking for all I can find.

==Completion==
A strange gnome he may be, but his desire to locate, salvage, and re-purpose old items is quite commendable.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Recycler Kerchunk|<Name>, are you here to help?  There's plenty to find here!}}

*{{Text|say|Recycler Kerchunk|Quickly <name>,  Grab those items!}}
