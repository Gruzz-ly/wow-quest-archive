==Objectives==
Look for more citrines in the waters surrounding [[Siren Isle]].
* [[Singing Fragments]]
* [[Singing Fragments]]
* [[Singing Fragments]]

==Description==
That ring of yours has caused quite a stir, hasn't it? And the history behind it... [[vrykul]]? Someone named [[Cyrce]]?

I know you and [[Bargus]] unlocked more of the ring's potential by scouting the isle but... perhaps you should turn your attention to the sea?

Take your ring into the water and see what happens. Bring whatever you find back to me. I'm a bit of a novice, but I might be able to piece whatever you find back together.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Blessing of the Seadweller|Gain the passive ability to walk on the seafloor, find treasures underwater, breathe underwater, and swim much faster while in the surrounding waters of Siren Isle.|icon=spell_shadow_demonbreath|id=470197}}

You will also receive:
*[[Raw Singing Citrine]]

==Progress==
[[Kobyss]] would give anyone {{wp|thalassophobia}}. You're a brave soul looking for gems in that water.

==Completion==
<Apprentice Tanmar takes the three Singing Fragments and looks at them dubiously.>

You can tell there is power here. I... hope I can fuse them safely. Here goes nothing. Or everything. Heh.

<Apprentice Tanmar takes out a vial of viscous, golden liquid and begins piecing them together. The liquid flashes with light, and the citrine is whole again. He hands you the repaired citrine.>

Impressed? Don't be. It was fancy glue, to be honest. But hopefully this ring'll further our knowledge of the isle!
