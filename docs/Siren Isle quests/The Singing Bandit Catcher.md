==Objectives==
Catch three thieves.
*[[Spirit Scarred Cave]] Searched
*[[Salt and Shanty (Siren Isle)|Salt and Shanty]] Searched
*[[Ghoststone Diggings]] Searched

==Description==
Seems you've gotten the hang of that ring, eh? Maybe you can put it to good use for me.

Our supplies here--especially our gold and flame-blessed iron--have been disappearing!

<[[Apprentice Tanmar|Tanmar]] leans in to whisper.>

Normally I wouldn't suggest this--the [[Arathi]] are a trustworthy lot--but the number of incidents is building. and I'm wondering if there's a [[thief]] among us.

See if you can find 'em. They being pretty brazen. I'm sure you can catch 'em in the act somewhere!

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Thieves of the Siren|Cyrce's Circlet now passively illuminates invisible enemies that attempt to steal the riches on Siren Isle. They are often found trying to pilfer Flame-Blessed Iron from the strongest creatures on the isle.|icon=ability_rogue_dirtydeeds|id=470169}}

You will also receive:
*[[Raw Singing Citrine]]

==Progress==
Keep your hand on your pockets. There are thieves everywhere, it seems like.

==Completion==
That's one hell of a tall tale. Knowing all of the oddities spilling out of this isle though, I can't say I'm surprised.
