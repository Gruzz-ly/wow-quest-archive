==Objectives==
Repair 2 Mine Tracks, clear 5 Crashed Mine Carts, and collect 12 Ore Samples.
* [[Mine Track]]s repaired (2)
* [[Crasehd Ore Cart|Crashed Mine Carts]] cleared (5)
* [[Ore Sample]] (12)

==Description==
Our mining team is making great progress. All our carts have already been loaded with ore samples and sent back to camp.

There's a problem though...

None of the carts made it to camp due to trouble on the tracks!

Please repair the tracks and collect any lost ore if you can so we can get those samples to camp.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One-time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
Are the mine carts getting through now?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. I knew you would find a way to solve this problem.

==Notes==
Walk the rails and interact with the tracks and carts. Ore may also be on the ground under the rails.

The ore cannot be picked up while affected by immunity effects such as [[Divine Shield]].

This quest is a criterion of [[Siren-ity Now!]]
