==Objectives==
Find 5 Meaty Rations from the invading forces: [[Pirate]]s, [[Naga]] or [[Vrykul]].
*Gather 5 [[Meaty Ration]]s (5)

==Description==
<The snapdragon seems to recognize you as you approach, its ear fins wiggling with anticipation.

Not only has it grown bigger overnight, but its scales have changed to a seaweed-green color similar to the Kaja'cola-braised meat you fed it.

Between it's{{sic}} talons lie morsels of meaty rations it has stolen from nearby invading forces. The snapdragon looks at you expectantly.

Perhaps you can bring it more meaty rations by slaying the invading forces on the island.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The snapdragon paws the ground and then looks at you expectantly. Its eyes glitter with intelligence.>

==Completion==
<The snapdragon perks up as you approach and sniffs the air as if to check to see if you've brought it food.

The second it sees the rations in your hand it begins snapping it's{{sic}} jaws in anticipation of a tasty meal.

With a newly full belly the snapdragon runt lays down to rest but peers up at you, as if hoping you will return tomorrow.>

==Notes==
Upon turning in the quest, the snapdragon changes to [[Maturing Prismatic Snapdragon]].
