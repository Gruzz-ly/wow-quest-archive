==Objectives==
Recover 10 Crystal Fragments and 30 Crystal Chunks from the [[Naga]] forces.
* [[Crystal Chunk]] (10)
* [[Crystal Fragment]] (30)

==Description==
I swore my life to protect [[Beledar]]... and now a new star sings to us from the sea.

I know not what this means for the [[Arathi]], but I do know that letting these foul creatures of the deep snatch up pieces of it is likely to lead to ill.

Kill them with extreme prejudice and recover any pieces of the crystal in their possession.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
Have you recovered the Crystal Fragments?

==Completion==
May Beledar's kin prosper now.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Water Shell]]s around [[Stormtide Dregs]] to free the chunks. Fragments drop from naga mobs.

This quest is a criterion of [[Siren-ity Now!]]
