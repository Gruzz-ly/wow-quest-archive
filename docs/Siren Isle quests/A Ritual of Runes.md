{{questportrait|Inhyldir the Cursed.jpg|Inhyldir the Cursed|Her crimes were so grotesque that the very name of Inhyldir has been erased from all known records.}}
==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Summoning Runes and eliminate Inhyldir the Cursed.
* [[Summoning Runes]] destroyed (5)
* [[Inhyldir the Cursed]] slain

==Description==
I went to investigate a cave nearby, and I came across some [[Bloodwake]] [[vrykul]] that were conjuring something... something that activated my threat mitigation protocols.

I calculate that if they complete their ritual, it would be disastrous for [[Siren Isle|the island]].

<Name>, please assess the cave and stop their ritual before something terrible occurs!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
Did you disrupt the ritual?

==Completion==
That was a close call. We must stay alert and watch for other strange activities.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Spirit Scarred Cave]] and destroy 5 rune stones. After you destroy them, Inhylder comes down.

The quest is a criterion of [[Siren-ity Now!]].
