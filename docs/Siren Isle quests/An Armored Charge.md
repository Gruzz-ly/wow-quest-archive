==Objectives==
Collect 50 storm-flecked debris.

Debris can be looted from creatures across the [[Siren Isle]].
*[[Storm-Flecked Debris]] (50)

==Description==
;Earthen
The inorganic material of this island is peculiar. The effects of salt water and years of storm erosion have enriched the minerals of this place.

And enriched minerals are exactly the type of material an [[Ordinant]] seeks to infuse into new armaments.

Bring me a considerable amount of storm-flecked debris from the isle's myriad of creatures. I would like to see if they are suitable for my craft.

;Dwarf, Dark Iron dwarf
The inorganic material of this island is peculiar. The effects of salt water and years of storm erosion have enriched the minerals of this place.

And enriched minerals are exactly the type of material an Ordinant seeks to infuse into new armaments.

Bring me a considerable amount of storm-flecked debris from the occupants around the isle.

I will forge into<!-- sic --> something worthy of an [[earthen]]... or in your case, earthen-adjacent.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*[[Ensemble: Stonebound Earthen Regalia]]

==Progress==
Have you found any storm-flecked debris? It should be somewhat plentiful here if you're willing to look.

==Completion==
<Bargus crushes a chunk of debris in his hand and spreads it on his anvil to examine.>

Fascinating... this detritus contains slivers of crystalline material. I wonder if it is eroded fragments of the [[Siren Crystal]]...

I may have another task for you, <name>.

But first, help yourself to the armaments I've forged.
