==Objectives==
Investigate the ruins and find the source of the signal.
*Examine the [[Singing Tablet]]
*Follow the Signal through the Vault.
*[[Glittering Ancient Tablet|Ancient Tablet]] Examined (Optional)
*Runic Symbol Investigated
*Follow the signal into the Central Chamber.

==Description==
These ruins are... quite old. Well, old by most outlanders' standards.

Which begs the question: was finding this chamber the unfriendly outlanders' directive, or was it finding the tablet?

One clue is that my readings suggest energy is flowing through the tablet as a conduit rather than originating from it.

Shall we take a closer look?

Perhaps investigation will yield some answers--and the source of the energy readings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}

==Completion==
By the forge... this is...

<Bargus stares wide-eyed in wonder at the gleaming crystal, struggling to find words. After a moment, he nods.>

This is most certainly the source of the second signature, though the energies here appear to have fused with the original.

It's almost like it wanted us to find this place...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Bargus|Analyzing. This tablet's markings seem... familiar.}}
:''Bargus approaches the Singing Tablet.''

Interact with it:
{{Book|Singing Tablet|content=
<As motes of light dance around the stone altar, a strange, melodic hum seems to call you forward. The call seems to emanate from both within the crystal-dotted tablet and the rock beneath your feet.

A faint, hand-shaped divot has been worn into the stone surrounding the lowest crystal on the tablet. Above this crystal, etched words read:

The Song of Cyrce.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Place your hand in the divot around the crystal.>}}
}}

The area is filled with yellow energy and the adventurer with Bargus is teleported to the [[Forgotten Vault (Siren Isle)|Forgotten Vault]]. The adventurer has the Radiant Presence debuff.

Continue forward:
:{{Text|say|Bargus|Remarkable! The signal's energy surrounds this structure. How deep does this go?}}

On the sides are [[Forgotten Protector]]s which summon [[Crystalsworn Memory|Crystalsworn Memories]].
:{{Text|say|Bargus|Echoes of the past! This structure clearly has a history...}}
*{{Text|say|Crystalsworn Memory|They... come... Jard...}}
*{{Text|say|Crystalsworn Memory|The Heart... cries... out...}}

[[Faded Construct]] is unattackable, but it does damage with Crystalline Force on approach.

There are six [[Glittering Ancient Tablet]]s around the tomb offering extra lore.

{{Book|Glittering Ancient Tablet|content=
<A relief depicts an imposing, metal-skinned figure. There is a large ring on the gauntlet of her raised hand.>


With our Lord of Thunder silent, the mighty [[Cyrce]] led her clan from [[Storm Peaks|Sturmpyk]] and away from the [[Winterskorn clan|Winterskorn]]'s [[Winterskorn War|unquenched thirst for war]].


As we fled, the cold northern winds at iron backs, we questioned our clans purpose. Who did we stand to protect?


For without the [[Keeper]]s, who did we serve?


Our prayers were answered years after our exodus.


From beneath the earth, we heard its cry, a plea for help, an anguished call.


To Cyrce's ears, the call was our destiny, and so, she led us towards the voice.

{{Book|Glittering Ancient Tablet|content=
<A single slab of stone embedded with crystalline fragments, the ancient tablet is decorated with intricately-carved images and runic letters.


A relief depicts a stoic, metal-skinned figure. Upon her shoulder sits a majestic winged creature with sparkling, cabochon-cut crystals set as its eyes. 


The pair are staring upon a massive crystalline facet.>


As broken tools were cast aside, we found beneath the ground. For months we heard, and for months we searched.


A golden crystal, encased by stone, its glow like a torch in the dark. 


Upon its face, Cyrce's hand was pressed; a sound, a cry!


But not of pain or plea of help, but of calm, of grace. [[Hymosul]], the Luminous Heart.


Its radiance and face, as if carved by unseen hands.


Many stones, I have carved. My iron hands, my tools, but the splendor of Hymosul has opened my eyes.


New designs, patterns and structures. My mind is... clear.

{{Book|Glittering Ancient Tablet|content=
<The relief depicts a large chamber with a gathering of humanoid figures, the tallest of which holds her fist aloft; a small imbedded gold sliver glimmers from her finger.

In the center of the cavern, jutting up from the floor, sits a massive crystalline facet.> 


The cavern grew, by tools and hands, a cradle for Heart to rest, from stones, to Shrine, the Sturmvyn laid.


For Hymosul's voice, once fierce, had calmed.


Though Cyrce spoke to Heart, its voice was faint, a whisper barely heard.


And so, with iron hands, I carved, I forged.
 
A circlet, born of radiant ore, fit for the hand of Cyrce. A ring adorned with smaller shards of Heart.


Remnants, smoothed and carved, with runes of Storm, citrines lit, their faces aglow with soft song.


Through the circlet, together, Cyrce and Hymosul sang.

{{Book|Glittering Ancient Tablet|content=
<The monolith depicts a vast stone tower collapsing into an massive wave. In the shadow of the wave, a faint figure can be seen.


Beneath the tower, in an underground chamber, humanoid figures take shelter before a glittering gold facet.>


For generations passed, our purpose held, the Luminous Heart at ease.


When lands seized and heaved, the skies flashed in noxious green.

 
Our bastion cracked, as towers fell, and waters black encroached. 

In Vault beneath, we Sturmvyn prayed, Cyrce's hand upon her Heart.


But when tremors grew, its cries rang out; Hymosul's squall renewed.


When silence fell, the cries still pained, our stone-runed doors unsealed


As Cyrce strode forth, our bastion ruined, surrounded by waters new.


Upon our shores, a dark thing stood, its words in our minds, it spoke:


"The Deep One stirs, this place calls out, his right to claim is nigh


Kneel before the Old One's gifts, their powers yours combined."

{{Book|Glittering Ancient Tablet|content=
<A relief depicts a bearded, metallic figure holding a stone tablet and a chisel. 


Beneath his feet, an image of a chamber with a crystal facet. Above him stands a towering structure.


This monolith is carved in a different hand than the others.>


Noble [[Jardfyr]], with loyalty and wisdom seared into iron hide.


First Carver of the Sturmvyn, advisor to Cyrce and Protector of Hymosul.


From stone, our temple shaped, its guardians wrought with life through runes of old.


Tempered and nurtured, our bond with Hymosul grew and her call sang.


From his hand and her voice, the Sturmvyn found their call.

Few outside the Sturmvyn know the craft of runic binding, the art of stone-carving.


To bind the storms of north into the stones of earth was a craft rarely mastered.


Wrought by runes and will, his guardians of stone rose to stand vigil within.


Though few learned his secrets, many would face his creations.


Through Hymosul's song, Jardfyr's designs would flourish.

{{Book|Glittering Ancient Tablet|content=
<This tablet depicts a great battle between humanoid, metallic figures and serpentine creatures emerging from the sea.


Although the metallic figures are outnumbered, winged humanoids and stone guardians appear to fight at their side.


The largest of the metallic figures gestures with a golden sliver-embedded finger, while above her soars a winged creature.>


Its head hit sand, its black blood sprayed, Cyrce's blade shone bright.


From darkened depths, a presence stirred. Over wail and pain, she cried:


"Hear us, O'Heart! Upon this land, we Sturmvyn stand, to hold back a tide of woe.


Guide us with your song, your heart, and make your pain our own!" 


As she called, across sea and sky, they rose; a tide of scales in numbers never met.

As serpents died, and horrors fell, iron hide, with blood, was slick.


The rumbling skies cracked, [[Thrayir, Eyes of the Siren (NPC)|Thrayir]]'s fury tore through endless scales.


By hand, from earth, rose guards of stone, against the tide they crashed


On golden wings, from high above, her plea was heard; a heavens gift, they brought


And yet, the tide ensued. With numbers few, a final song rang out.


While Cyrce clashed, as Thrayir shrieked, her clanskin fell to scales.


The stone guards cracked, as rubble split, dragged to the waters deep.


From the skies they fell; the gold ones screamed, their wings and spears torn asunder.


With heavy soul, Cyrce looked upon her kin and called, "Retreat, to the Vault! Protect our Heart."


As those yet lived obeyed, Cyrce, stood upon our shores, and faced the darkness alone.

Continue following the yellow beam to the door.
:{{Text|say|Bargus|The signal is getting stronger... it's coming from that chamber...}}

On the right side is the [[Ancient Rune]]. Interact with it to open the door.

Head inside to see a bigger crystal.
:{{Text|say|Bargus|What's this? An ancient shrine... another crystal facet... and the gleam of something promising...}}
