==Objectives==
Equip [[:Cyrce's Circlet]] and fight creatures on the [[Siren Isle]] to trigger its hidden ability while in combat.
*Potential Unveiled (10)

==Description==
This ring that you and [[Bargus]] found has taken you all over the isle learning its history and finding its treasures.

The ring has aided you in your exploration--and in battle. But, we have never truly pushed the ring to find its limitations.

Perhaps some formal testing is in order. Perhaps we can unveil more of its potential if we invite a bit of danger.

Go now and test the ring against any worthy opponents you can find. Come back to me with your observations.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Cyrce's Zephyr|id=470168|While Cyrce's Circlet is equipped and you're on the Siren Isle, your spells and abilities have a chance to summon Cyrce's Zephyr which will cast every existing Singing Citrine ability over 3 sec.|icon=spell_frost_windwalkon}}

You will also receive:
*[[Raw Singing Citrine]]

==Progress==
Have you engaged in combat testing with the ring? What were your findings?

==Completion==
What fascinating results. Still, I feel there is much more to learn and process.

==Progression==
{{Cyrce's Circlet upgrade}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.7|note=Added.}}
