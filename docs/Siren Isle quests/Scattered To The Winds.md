==Description==
My goodness! [[Tattered Journal|This journal]] is missing many of its pages!

<Stellin flips through the journal, careful to not let any loose pages fall out.>

This journal doesn't look very old... and it seems to be of human origin? Could this be the key to discovering what happened to the humans that came here? What a mystery!

But less of a mystery if we could find the missing pages... Would you keep an eye out for them while you're out in the field?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found any more pages from the journal?

==Completion==
Wow, look at all these pages!

Excellent work <name>! Now, for the hardest part...

==Notes==
Scour the isle to find the letters.

==Progression==
{{Homeward Bound to Safer Shores}}
