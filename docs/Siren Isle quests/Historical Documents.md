Imagine having the chance to accompany [[Sky-Captain Elaena Lancekat]] on such a great adventure. This is the opportunity of a lifetime!

But if I'm going to write a book about this journey, I need to gather some historical information about this island.

Perhaps you could collect any notes or documents that you find? Anything might be useful and tell us about the history of this place!

==Progress==
What did you find?

==Completion==
You've gathered so much valuable information. There were so many secrets to be uncovered here!

I can't wait to start writing this book.

But I need to come up with the perfect title first...

Loot [[Interesting Notes]] throughout the isle.

The quest is a criterion of [[Siren-ity Now!]]
