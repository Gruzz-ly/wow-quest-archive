==Objectives==
Examine various Rune-Carved Tablets within the Forgotten Tomb.
*Re-enter the [[Forgotten Vault (Siren Isle)|Forgotten Tomb]]
*[[Fury of Thrayir]] examined
*[[Keys of Thrayir]] examined
*[[Cyrce and the Galeorn]] examined

==Description==
My curiosity is still not terminated, <name>. I would like to know more about these [[vrykul]] and why they came to this land.

<Bargus's wiry brows knit together and his mustache bristles as he thinks.>

The tablets you found were by far the best source of information on the vrykul and whoever this "[[Cyrce]]" is.

Perhaps there are additional tablets we missed?

I have my ordained duties here, but please examine them and report back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]]

==Progress==
Have you found the tablets yet? What did they say? Were they more relief carvings?

==Completion==
Fascinating. This "galeorn" you spoke of known as [[Thrayir, Eyes of the Siren (NPC)|Thrayir]] may be worth further investigation.

Perhaps we could uncover more about its significance along with those runekeys.

It seems my curiosity will not be terminated any time soon.

==Notes==
Just like in the intro quests, enter the cave at {{Co|46.37|19.83|Siren Isle}} and interact with the [[Singing Tablet]].

{{Book|Singing Tablet|content=
<As motes of light dance around the stone altar, a strange, melodic hum seems to call you forward. The call seems to emanate from both within the crystal-dotted tablet and the rock beneath your feet.

A faint, hand-shaped divot has been worn into the stone surrounding the lowest crystal on the tablet. Above this crystal, etched words read:

The Song of Cyrce.>

{{Gossip|<Place your hand in the divot around the crystal.>}}

The Singing Runes transport the player character to the Forgotten Vault. Visit all three chambers to read the three required tablets.

While in the central chamber, pick up [[The Tattered Journal]].

{{Book|Fury of Thrayir|content=
Few enemies of the [[Sturmvyn Clan]] would live to tell tales of Cyrce and Thrayir. 


Even among the fiercest Winterskorn, the pair were both feared and revered.


When Cyrce guided our clan south to settle the Sturmvyn upon the Cradle of Hymosul, Thrayir served as her eyes and ears.


The galeorn's loyalty was to Cyrce and to her clan, just as our bond to her extended to Thrayir.


But with loyalty came the galeorn's fury.


When the world shattered, and the darkness rose from the depths, Thrayir took to sky.

As more and more Sturmvyn fell, the galeorn mourned and the galeorn raged.


Skies split open, as his fury spent and scales burned.


Wounded, his rage flowed, and the galeorn's spark grew dim.

{{Book|Keys of Thrayir|content=
As Cyrce called for retreat, she bid me to take Thrayir. Great was his fury and terrible were his injuries, but Cyrce need not fear. I would not fail her.

Thrayir's wrath against our foes had unleashed a storm not seen since our days in the north. 

To have seen so many Sturmvyn fall must have pushed the Galeorn into such a fury that he had started to unravel. I needed to stabilize his wounds.

While [[Jardfyr]] saw to the [[Forgotten Vault (Siren Isle)|Vaults]] defenses and carved new guardians, I turned to [[Ksvir the Forgotten|Ksvir the Thundered]]. Second only to the might of Cyrce, Ksvir wielded the blessing of Storms, a rumored gift bestowed by [[Thorim]] himself.  

Anguished yet bound by oath as Cyrce command to lead her retreat, Ksvir lent me his gift. To stabilize Thrayir's wounds, we forged five runekeys to harness the tempest  that roiled above. Five keys of turbulent waters, torrential rains, thunderous lightning, cyclonic winds, and whirling waterspouts. 

Ksvir would keep one runekey, while the rest were scattered. 

Bound by five, we sealed Thrayir's tortured form in stasis. The fury of the Tempest would slowly heal his wounds and only by the wielder of the five keys, would his stasis break.

May his wounds mend and may his cries of sorrow drift away.

{{Book|Cyrce and the Galeorn|content=
<The depiction of a large avian creature sits perched upon a stormy mountain peak.>


Born amidst the clouds of Sturmpyk, the noble galeorn had long been observed by our clan from below.


Like [[Thorim]]'s [[stormwolf|stormwolves]], few have mastered the means to tame these fierce elemental creatures.


But where many Sturmvyn failed or fell to their thunderous nature, one succeeded: Cyrce.


No one knows how she triumphed, but when Cyrce descended from the highest slopes of Sturmpyk with a galeorn upon her forearm, the clan foresaw it as a sign.


All hail Cyrce, chosen of Sturmpyk and friend of Thrayir, the galeorn.
