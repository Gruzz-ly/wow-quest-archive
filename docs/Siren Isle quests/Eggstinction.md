'''Eggstinction''' is available in the storm phase of the [[Siren Isle]].

==Objectives==
Eliminate 12 Egg Tenders and 12 Spawning Clutches.
*Seafury Eggtenders (12)
*[[Spawning Cluth]] destroyed using equipment (12)
*Equipment acquired at main camp (Optional)

==Description==
We should really get outta here, but...

Do you see those eggs over there? If those monsters hatch them all, this place will be swarming with crabs when the storm clears.

Ugh, there's just too many to destroy by hand. We're gonna need some help!

Suzie's got a lot of helpful items back at the camp... or maybe my broiler will work? I dunno, champ. Grab somethin' to get rid of those eggs!

* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
Did you get rid of the eggs?

==Completion==
I knew you'd take care of thay creepy mess!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Sally Boltwrench|My broiler is not the best choice. Sally{{sic}} has much better gear to help with this problem.}}

[[Boltwrench Broiler]] becomes available. Head back to the camp for [[TR-06 Pummeler]], [[Ricket's Special Delivery]], or [[Crawler Mine]] to use against the clutches. Then kill [[Deepwater Matriarch]]s and [[Deepwater Eggtender]]s.

This quest is a criterion of [[Siren's Squall]].
