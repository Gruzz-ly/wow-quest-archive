==Objectives==
Collect 50 crystal-splintered rubble.

The crystal-splintered rubble can only be looted from creatures on the [[Siren Isle]] during the [[:Seafury Tempest]].
* [[Crystal-Splintered Rubble]] (50)

==Description==
<[[Bargus]] holds up a tiny splinter of golden crystal.>

Much like the radiant remnants found by the [[Arathi]] within [[Hallowfall]], the [[Siren Crystal]] appears to be effecting{{sic}} the surrounding geological matrix of the island.

Unlike our [[goblin]] compatriots, I don't recommend harvesting the larger shards we've seen around the isle, lest we disturb the fragile caverns beneath us or offend the Arathi.

But these tiny splinters are worth investigating.

Bring me a sizable portion. For... experimental purposes.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: 
*[[Ensemble: Awakened Earthen Regalia]]

==Progress==
Have you found more splinters of the Siren Crystal? I think I may be able to create something useful with them.

==Completion==
<Bargus spreads the rubble onto his anvil and nods firmly.>

I will begin research on this new material immediately! You have my gratitude, <name>.

You are welcome to help yourself to the newest sets of armaments I have recently forged.

They were slated for delivery to the [[Awakening Machine]], but since they seem like the perfect size for you, you are welcome to sample my work.
