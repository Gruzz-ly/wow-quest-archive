==Objectives==
Pet the goodest boy.
*Pet [[Marmaduke (NPC)|Marmaduke]]

==Description==
<Upon seeing you walk into camp this dirty, matted dog perks up. His tail wags when he sees the familiar face of the person who found his favorite toy.

The faded tag around its neck reads: "The Duke."

He seems to have been here since the Kul Tirans disappeared and has somehow survived the isle's many perils.

"The Duke" looks at you longingly and nuzzles your hand, seeking affection.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
*[[Marmaduke]]

==Progress==
<The dog looks at you with hope gleaming in its old eyes.>

==Completion==
<Marmaduke seems to want to follow you off of the island to new adventures.

He grips his favorite toy in his mouth, his tail wagging happily.

Hopefully, this is the start of a beautiful new friendship.>
