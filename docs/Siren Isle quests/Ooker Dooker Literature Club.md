==Description==
The [[hozen]] in the Bilge Rat crew are master scavengers. For years, they've been visiting [[Siren Isle|this island]], snatching up anything that might be of value.

Among their spoils are many research materials that could help unlock the history of this place.

Infiltrate their camp, board their ships, and recover whatever books, scrolls, and documents you can find.

==Progress==
Did you find anything worth reading?

==Completion==
What a fascinating collection of writings! I daresay I shall be up all night reading these.

==Notes and trivia==
Head south of the isle and find the tomes on pirate ships.

To obtain [[Ashvane Co. Survey Report]], kill [[First Mate Dat-Dat]], loot [[First Mate Dat-Dat's Key]], and unlock [[Dat-Dat's Book Stash]].

There are multiple [[Bilge Rat Trunk]]s for the diary.

The name of the quest is likely a reference to the {{Wp|Doki Doki Literature Club!}} visual novel.
