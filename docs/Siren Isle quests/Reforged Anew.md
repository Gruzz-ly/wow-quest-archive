==Objectives==
Help [[Angorla]] repair the Citrine.
*[[Cracked Citrine]] Repaired

==Description==
The cracked citrine you found seems to be a perfect fit for one of the sockets found in the ring, yet...

<As Angorla sockets the shard into the ring, the citrine wiggles loose and pops out.>

The ring appears to be rejecting the piece. If we can repair the citrine and stabilize the energy within the shard, perhaps the ring will accept it?

Since you've been so helpful with [[Bargus]], care to lend another hand?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|17|55}}
*[[Windsinger's Runed Citrine]]

==Progress==
A fractured citrine is hardly an obstacle!

==Completion==
<Angorla holds the glowing citrine in her hand before holding it out to you.>

That seemed to do the trick... I've never felt such energy radiate from such a small crystal before. 

The runes engraved on it are quite ancient and very powerful.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Angorla|The crystal you found is cracked. Let's restore it in the forge.}}

Speak with Angorla:
{{Dialogue|
<Angorla examines the cracked shard closely.>

It would appear as if there is some sort of energy signature within the inner matrix of this shard--fascinating! 

Care to assist me in examining its inner workings? Or would you prefer to document and take notes while we work?

*{{Gossip|quest=|Let's take a closer look at the shard.}}
*{{Gossip|{{Text|red|<Skip Mini Game>}} I'd prefer to observe and take notes.}}
}}

Choosing the Skip option prompts a confirmation window:
:Choosing this option will allow the earthen to repair the shard without your help, but you will be required to wait until they are finished working.

:{{Text|red|It is not required to complete this quest.}}

:Do you want to choose this option?

:Yes/No

Choosing the quest option prompts an untangling mini-game introduced in {{g|bfa}}, now called Crystal Matrix Alignment.

:{{Text|say|Angorla|While Bargus repairs the outer chassis, let us take a closer look at the destabilized matrices in this fractured crystal, shall we?}}

Complete it.

:{{Text|say|Angorla|Stabilization complete. The crystals inner matrices begin humming with power!}}
:{{Text|say|Bargus|Task complete. I can hear it singing. It's ready for the artifact.}}

This quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].
