==Objectives==
Eliminate Warlord Thresh, Extractor Silsai, and Nereu of the Silent Wave
* [[Warlord Thresh]] slain
* [[Extractor Silisai]] slain
* [[Nereu of the Silent Wave]] slain

==Description==
The reach of these creatures is truly frightening!

I have encountered them countless times in the Imperial waters. I know their strategies well, and I have a plan to deal with them.

My [[scout]]s have pinpointed the location of three of their leaders. Eliminate them, and we'll seize the advantage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One-time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
Have you eliminated their leaders?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. I could use someone of your caliber aboard my ship--should you ever be looking for work.

==Notes==
This quest is a criterion of [[Siren-ity Now!]]
