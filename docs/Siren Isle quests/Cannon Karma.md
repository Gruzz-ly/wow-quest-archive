This is gettin' serious, <name>! Those [[pirate]] goons have a [[cannon]] and are threatenin' to blow us outta the sky!

==Completion==
Couldn't have done better myself. Youse should have a [[:Kaja'Cola]] to celebrate.

==Notes==
Find the cannonballs at [[Stormtide Dregs]] {{Co|47.48|65.30|Siren Isle}}, which spawns [[Cannon Master Jin'chu]].
