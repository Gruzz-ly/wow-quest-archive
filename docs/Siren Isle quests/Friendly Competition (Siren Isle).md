==Objectives==
Seek out [[Bargus]] in the camp.

==Description==
See, [[Ricket]] offered to dig it up, but the [[Arathi]] expedition lady didn't seem too keen on that.

Gave 'er an earful. Could hear it from the airship. Yeesh.

Bargus, the earthen "[[ordinant]]"--whatever that means-- proposed scanning the crystal to help us "understand it better."

I don't need to understand it. All I need's my cut. But I'm fine layin' low and doin' what they want.

Go talk to Bargus at the earthen camp. See how they're comin' along an' if we can help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
<Bargus looks up from his anvil.>

Another new arrival. 

Here to lend a hand to our efforts?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Skaggit|The competition's hard at work. You should say hello to the neighbors. Real friendly-like.}}
:{{Text|emote|Ricket grins wickedly.}}

Approach Bargus on the other side of the camp at {{Co|67.5|41.9|Siren Isle}}.
:{{Text|say|Bargus|Are you here to lend a hand? Admirable. Perhaps we can all work together.}}

This quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].

On alts, completing this quest gives Bargus the option to skip the rest of the questline:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|I have already ventured into the Radiant Vault and recovered Cyrce's Circlet.  {{Text|red|<Skip The Song of Secrets Chapter.>}}}}
}}

Choosing this option prompts a confirmation window:
:If you choose this option, the "Song of Secrets" chapter will be completed for you and you will not be able to do it again on this character.

:Are you sure you want to continue?

:Yes/No

Choosing so automatically opens access to regular Siren Isle activities and events and gives [[Cyrce's Circlet]], [[Raw Singing Citrine]], and [[Windsinger's Runed Citrine]].

==Progression==
