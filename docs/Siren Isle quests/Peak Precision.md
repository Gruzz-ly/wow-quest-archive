==Description==
Flying? It ain't for me.

[[Sally Boltwrench]] wanted me to activate a bunch of survey machines to monitor the wind currents, but it's too rough up there and the heights give me the heebie jeebies.

An' I get sick every time I try.

Use the Go-Pack to activate the machines for me. I'll owe ya one!

==Progress==
Did you switch those machines on?

Thanks for helping out Benny. You can borrow the Go-Pack anytime ya want!

Use the pack to fly around and find the devices.
