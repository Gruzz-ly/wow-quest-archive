'''Shoreline Stand''' is available in the storm phase of the [[Siren Isle]].
{{questportrait|Tide-Champion Korval.jpg|Tide-Champion Korval|This fallen champion wanders the Forgotten Tomb, seeking answers to questions long lost in the fog of time.}}
==Objectives==
Eliminate 15 Brinebound Wraith and Tide-Champion Korval.
* [[Brinebound Wraith]] slain (15)
* [[Tide-Champion Korval]] slain
* Use the Singing Tablet to enter the [[Forgotten Vault (Siren Isle)|Forgotten Tomb]] (Optional)

==Description==
This storm will not drive me from my sacred duty. This cave must be defended at all costs!

This new crystal may still be shrouded in mystery, but we will never understand its secrets or its relation to Beledar if we allow it to fall into the grasp of these wretches who crawl from the ocean's abyss.

Stand with me, <name>. Together, we shall defend this shoreline to our final breath.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
Is the crystal safe?

==Completion==
Well fought. Your assistance was most welcome, <name>. The [[Sacred Flame]] guided our hand and steel.


But now I have the situation under control. Perhaps a few of the [[goblin]]s or [[earthen]] who yet remain may need your aid?

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Regald Hornfyre|Careful, they are gathering for another attack!}}

[[Brinebound Wraith]]s are on the coast. After killing 15, head inside the [[Sacred Hollow]] and interact with the [[Singing Tablet]] to enter the [[Forgotten Vault (Siren Isle)|Forgotten Tomb]].
:{{Text|say|Regald Hornfyre|Quick <name> into the cave! Some of these cursed have reached the Singing Tablet!}}

Head downstairs and kill [[Tide-Champion Korval]].

This quest is a criterion of [[Siren's Squall]].
