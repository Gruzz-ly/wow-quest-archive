==Objectives==
Assist Bargus by collecting the earthen prototype, the [[Arathi]]'s focus and the [[goblin]]'s power source.
*[[Earthen Prototype]]
*[[Ornate Arathi Box]]
*[[Overcharged Battery]]
*Device assembled
*[[Sturdy Toolbox]] (provided)

==Description==
In order to understand the "singing crystal" at the heart of the island, we will need some special machinery.

We have forged a device to scan its exposed facets, but the crystal's energies are far too complex to read. It has a highly unusual energy signature.

The goblins and Arathi seem keen to contribute, so let us proceed with their help.

Take my toolbox and retrieve the prototype and the components the Arathi and goblins have prepared.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
Normally, our [[technology]] is quite capable when it comes to crystals and the energies found within them. 

But the energies found here are anomalous and don't synchronize with our technology...

==Completion==
Skepticism... disengaged.

It would seem the radiant remnants from Hallowfall harmonize perfectly with the energies found here, giving us a proper signature to latch onto.

The goblins' batteries are... more than we need, but they appear to be doing the job effectively.

We're almost ready for the field test!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Bargus|We earthen are here to study the crystal. The goblins and the Arathi... we are still processing how to collaborate.}}

The adventurer has the Earthen Toolbox buff, applying an empty box on the back. As the required items are gathered, the box is filled.

To the right from [[Bargus]] is an [[Earthen Prototype]] on a tray held by a [[Helpful Haulbot]], tended to by [[Machinist Kromleg]] and [[Angorla]].

{{Dialogue|title=Machinist Kromleg|
The energy from these crystals are... extraordinary! For some reason, my device cannot tap into them though.

{{Gossip|quest=|Bargus mentioned you have a prototype. May I see it?}}
}}

No response. Click directly on the prototype on the tray instead to loot it:
:{{Text|say|Angorla|Interpreting a massive crystal's energy is a specialized process. Maybe the Arathi learned something from [[Beledar]]...}}

Over to the Arathi camp, speak with [[Apprentice Tanmar]] at {{Co|71.0|40.5|Siren Isle}}:
{{Dialogue|
I have spent most my adult years among the [[Sacredites]] studying the properties of the radiant remnants--small, crystalline fragments found in Hallowfall.

Beyond the walls of the Priory, I had seen or experienced very little.

I was nervous to embark on the [[Starchaser (airship)|Starchaser]] from the [[Isle of Dorn]], but I... I am glad I did.

For the first time in ages, I feel inspired and enlightened.

Maybe it's the rhythm of Lorandel's song, or maybe it's just the salty air...

{{Gossip|quest=|Can you help the earthen's device interpret the crystal's energies?}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Tanmar|Hmmm. My sacred crystals could help harmonize your readings, but you'll need more power...}}
:''Tanmar kneels by the [[Crate of Radiant Remnants]], takes it, and moves it under a tent.''

He doesn't return and instead stands next to a [[Expedition Shieldhand]]. New dialogues become available with Tanmar.

Head to [[Didi the Wrench]]'s station at {{Co|71.3|45.7|Siren Isle}}:
:{{Text|say|Didi the Wrench|Whaddya need? Batteries? These puppies should keep the scanner juiced up. You're good to go!}}

And take a battery near her. With all three items collected, return to [[Bargus]]:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|quest=|I have retrieved the prototype and the components.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Bargus|Task complete. Now we can use the crystal's signature to track its facets.}}

At this point, the quest is completed. Bargus has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
We earthen are no strangers to reading energy signatures from crystalline compounds. But the energy here is... different. 

We've never encountered something like this before.
}}

This quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].
