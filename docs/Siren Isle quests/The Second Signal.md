==Objectives==
Follow [[Bargus]] north.

==Description==
An unexpected development.

The energy signature appears to have a secondary source--and it is just north of herel{{sic}}.

Curiosity activated.

Judging from the estimated size of the crystal, I theorize it might be a secondary exposed facet.

Further investigation is required. Follow me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}

==Completion==
It would seem we are not alone on this island after all, <name>.

<Bargus glances down at the dead vrykul next to him and shakes his head with a frown.>

To initiate violence before diplomatic engagement... An illogical provocation that yielded unfortunate consequences.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Bargus|Intriguing. I'm detecting a secondary reading from the north. This requires more Investigation.}}
:''Bargus runs towards [[Jetsam Drift]].''

Follow suit.

This quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].
