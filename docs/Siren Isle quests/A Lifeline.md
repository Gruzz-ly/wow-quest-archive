==Objectives==
Talk to Zexel Fingersnap.
*Speak to [[Zexel Fingersnap]]
* [[Kaja'Cola-braised Meat]]

==Description==
<The snapdragon barely moves as you approach. It is clearly weak and seems much smaller than it should be.

Perhaps Zexel Fingersnap has something for sale that could help get it back up on its feet?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The small snapdragon looks wearily at you with dull eyes.>

==Completion==
<The small snapdragon voraciously tears into the morsel. It seems to be energized by both the meat and the caffeinated Kaja'Cola the meat was soaked in.

It looks up at you with gratitude in its eyes.

It will remember you.>

==Notes==
Speaking with Zexel:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have anything that could help a starving snapdragon runt?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Food, huh? Yeah I think I got-

<A{{sic}} [[Impatient Snapdragon|impatient snapdragon]] snaps its jaws at Zexel's ankle.>

Whoa, whoa! Wait ya turn buddy.

<Zexel taps on the ground in front of its snout with his stick, and the snapdragon pulls back slightly with an irritated hiss.>

Here, take this meat. My buddy [[Blinky Greasefingers|Blinky]] over there cooked it up. It's meat marinated overnight in Kaja'cola!

Not only is it tasty, but it should also help the lil' guy get some energy back. These guys seem to love it, so I'm sure yours will too.

Er, don't mind the color. It's safe to consume... mostly.
