==Objectives==
Bring the Tattered Kul Tiran Journal to the graveyard behind the [[Kul Tiran]] base in the [[Abandoned Mines]].
* [[Tattered Kul Tiran Journal]]

==Description==
<[[Stellin Verasa|Stellin]] listens as you explain what you've learned and nods gravely.>

This poor fellow was part of a crew that sailed here aboard a ship called the [[Maiden's Whisper]]. They were almost wiped out by a storm, but then even the survivors disappeared!

He was the last one and... didn't make it either in the end. Perhaps we can put his memory to rest?

I spotted a graveyard out behind the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]]'s base... perhaps setting the journal there amongst his crew's graves will bring his memory some peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Transcribed Kul Tiran Journal]]

==Progress==
<Name>, did you find the graveyard?

==Completion==
Good. I'm glad that's done... I hope he can rest in peace now with his friends and crew.

I did manage to transcribe a copy of the journal if you're interested in reading it. I thought it might come in handy.

<Stellin pauses, looking thoughtful.>

I wonder though... what happened to the crew? Why did the author end up alone?

It seems this island still has many mysteries to unravel.

==Notes==
Place the book behind [[Salt and Shanty (Siren Isle)|Salt and Shanty]] at {{Co|38.87|54.81|Siren Isle}} which briefly summons a projection of a Kul Tiran.

After turning in the quest, return to Salt and Shanty and find a [[Well Loved Squeaky Toy]] on the second floor at {{Co|39.33|54.27|Siren Isle}}. Then head to [[Ghoststone Diggings]] and find [[Marmaduke (NPC)|Marmaduke]]. Interact with him:
{{Dialogue|
<Marmaduke looks at you expectantly.>

{{Gossip|<Give Marmaduke the Well Loved Squeaky Toy.>}}
}}
:{{Text|emote|Marmaduke looks at you expectantly and runs toward camp.}}

Marmaduke returns to [[Flotsam Shoal]] to start the final quest.

==Progression==
{{Homeward Bound to Safer Shores}}
