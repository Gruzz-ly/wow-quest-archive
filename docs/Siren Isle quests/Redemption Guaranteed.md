==Objectives==
Deliver the Empty Kaja'Cola to [[Blinky Greasefingers]] at [[Flotsam Shoal]].
* [[Empty Kaja'Cola]] (provided)

==Description==
<Even an empty Kaja'Cola can still has value. Perhaps Blinky Greasefingers might want it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*150x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]]

==Completion==
I don't recycle these. I just refill them with off-brand cola.

Nobody can tell the difference, I promise!
