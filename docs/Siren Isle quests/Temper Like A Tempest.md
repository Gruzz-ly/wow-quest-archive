==Objectives==
Speak to [[Suzie Boltwrench]] to enter the [[:Seafury Tempest]] and slay creatures to obtain Storm-infused Mystery Meat.
*[[Storminfused Mystery Meat]] (5)

==Description==
<The snapdragon seems to recognize you as you approach, its ear fins wiggling with anticipation.

Not only has it grown bigger overnight, but its scales have changed color from the meat you fed it yesterday.

Between it's{{sic}} talons lie the remains of a sea creature from the last Seafury Tempest. The snapdragon looks at you expectantly.

Perhaps by venturing into the Seafury Tempest and slaying creatures there you can bring it more meat.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The snapdragon paws the ground, then looks at you expectantly. Its eyes glitter with intelligence and hunger.>

==Completion==
<Upon seeing the meat you have brought it, the snapdragon clicks its jaw hungrily. The second you set down the meat it tears into it veraciously finishing the meal in seconds.

It looks up at you with newfound respect in it's{{sic}} eyes; after all, you have slain mighty creatures to bring it this meal.>
