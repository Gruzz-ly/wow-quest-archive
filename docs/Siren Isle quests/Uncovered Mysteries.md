'''Uncovered Mysteries''' is the last step to finishing the Siren Isle introduction.

==Objectives==
Uncover hidden secrets around the [[Siren Isle]].
*Vrykul Ruins Searched
*Vrykul Ritual Site Searched
*Vrykul Gravesite Searched

==Description==
<[[Angorla]] takes your hand in hers and examines the crystal-embedded circlet closely.>

Can you feel the energy humming through it, <name>? The circlet feels... awake.

Perhaps more secrets lie around the isle, waiting for you to uncover them.

[[Dawn]] encouraged us to explore and learn about this isle, but I've got my work cut out for me here.

Why don't you see what other secrets you can find?

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Runecaster's Eye|id=472051|Gain the ability to find and unveil hidden treasures around Siren Isle. The wind will passively guide you towards them.|icon=spell_holy_healingfocus}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*[[Raw Singing Citrine]]

==Progress==
What have you found? Another treasure, perhaps?

==Completion==
Curious. Even as fragments, the pieces hum with energy. I wonder if I...

<Angorla presses the fragments together like a puzzle, squeezing them in her palm. After a moment, she opens her hand and reveals a neatly-fused shard.>

It may be less intricately-carved or ornate as the citrine you found in the vault, but there is power here, even in a small stone like this.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Dawn|Now you can discover more mysteries hidden on the island. Seek and you will find.}}
:''[[Bargus]] walks away.''

Find 3 [[Singing Fragments]] from three locations on the Siren Isle by using the extra action button Runecaster's Eye to reveal a [[Runed Storm Cache]] and loot the fragments.
*cave in [[Stormtide Dregs]] at {{Co|68.3|71.7|Siren Isle}}.
*in [[Jetsam Drift]] at {{Co|39.4|20.2|Siren Isle}}.
*in [[Deadfin Mire]] at {{Co|32.4|69.3|Siren Isle}}.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Dawn|Fascinating. We've only just begun our exploration. It's time to answer the call to adventure.}}
:''Dawn walks away.''

Completing the quest opens [[A Lifeline]] and offers one-time extra dialogue with Angorla:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Dawn|You seem fascinated with those crystals. I was watching your process earlier. What is it about them that inspires you?}}
:{{Text|say|Angorla|This morning, I heard the [[Siren Crystal]] sing to me, ringing with an intricate melody.}}
:{{Text|say|Dawn|Perhaps it was calling to the spark of the [[Azeroth (titan)|Worldsoul]] within you. We've been searching the island to learn more.}}
:{{Text|say|Angorla|Your thoughts align with mine. If we found more of the smaller crystals, I could make enduring wonderworks.}}
:{{Text|say|Dawn|It's a shame the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]] didn't hear the same song. We found the remains of their mining camp. Their culture didn't endure here.}}
:{{Text|say|Angorla|Really? I haven't left the workshop. What have you found? Journals? Letters? Schematics?}}
:{{Text|say|Dawn|More mysteries. Their culture practically vanished overnight. It's one of the Crystal's biggest enigmas.}}
:{{Text|say|Angorla|I heard they were mining [[:Azerite]]. I'm glad we have more reasonable designs.}}
:{{Text|say|Angorla|Now I have the inspiration for more intricate creations: lattices, orreries, matrices...}}
:{{Text|say|Dawn|Spoken like a true [[earthen]]. A creator should follow her heart. We'll find more of those smaller crystals for you.}}

This quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].
