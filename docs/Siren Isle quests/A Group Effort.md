==Objectives==
Ask Alta, Skitter, and Ricket if they can read [[Tattered Journal|the journal]].
*Speak to [[Alta]]
*Speak to [[Ricket]]
*Speak to [[Skitter]]

==Description==
This is, um, quite the mess you've handed me. All these pages... what order do they go in?

Aha!

This journal seems to have belonged to a [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul'Tiran]] that came here...

<Stellin looks up, her eyes shining with excitement.>

...and it might hold the key to learning about their time on the isle. 

But the pages are hard to read... perhaps we should ask around to see if anyone can read them?

Here, take a few pages. I'll keep trying to decipher the base journal while you go to camp and ask around.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Stellin adjusts her glasses with a grimace.>

This... seems like the author's signature. Had... is that a "d" or an "l"

Had... do.. k--oh! Haddock? Or maybe that's an "'e."

==Completion==
Oh! <Name> I'm glad you're here. I've had a breakthrough with the journal, but first I want to know what you've found.

Did you find anything interesting? Was anyone able to decipher the handwriting?

==Notes==
All three are in the camp.

A journal? How fascinating. Yes, I would be happy to take a look, though my knowledge of the younger races is quite... limited.

<Alta studies the pages for a long while.>

What a perplexing story. Does it not seem illogical to leave the others behind given their directive? Perhaps someone didn't want the records of this crew to be found.

And to disappear so suddenly. I can't say that I have ever heard of such a feat.

<Alta gingerly hands the worn pages back to you with a sad smile.>

I am afraid I have no answers for you--only more questions.

I hope you are able to find the answers you seek.

{{Dialogue-child|
Oh? A mystery you say? Sure, I'll take a look. Give 'em here, hon.

<Ricket gently takes the pages you collected and thumbs through them.>

Well, that's interestin'. Sound's like they lost a boat in one of the storms. I wonder if there's any treasure in the wreckage...

<Ricket hands you back the papers with a shrug.>

Honestly, I dunno. Sounds like they weren't as prepared as we were. The bit about the forest is spooky but... not as spooky as those guys just straight disappearin'.

<Ricket looks around nervously.>

Say, you don't think that will happen to us... right?

<Skitter eyes the pages warily.>

I not understand. But I smell...

<Skitter leans over the pages and sniffs them.>

Smells of... [[human]] and salt. Dirt and cave too.

<Skitter's brows furrow.>

But also smells of... death.

<Skitter shies away from the pages.>

I no like. Please take away!
