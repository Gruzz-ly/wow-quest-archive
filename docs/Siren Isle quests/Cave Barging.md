==Objectives==
Find the source of the energy signature.
*Collapsed tunnel cleared
*Cave entered

==Description==
Unless it is a convergence of coincidence, whoever these large outlanders are, they appear to also be interested in the crystal's signal--and the location of its origin.

We [[earthen]] do not often take stock in coincidences.

Engage your defense protocols, <name>.

These outlanders are not hospitable like your people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}

==Completion==
<Bargus looks around the crumbled ruins in the cave.>

The crystals on [[Singing Tablet|that tablet]]...

If those small crystals are the source of the new energy signature, then why do they give off a stronger reading than the larger facet on the surface?

There is something else here we are missing...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Bargus|The signal's coming from that cave. It's seems like we're not the only ones to take interest in it. We need to get in there.}}
:''Bargus starts following the adventurer.''

Follow the yellow beams to the collapsed entrance of the [[Sacred Hollow]]. Bargus blasts the boulders, allowing entry. Head inside.
:{{Text|say|Bargus|Fascinating. The energy is focused through that tablet...}}

This quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].
