==Description==
This vault... this crystal...

Who made this place? Who lived here? And who is this "[[Cyrce]]" we keep seeing mentioned on the tablets?

When we set off to learn about the crystal, I did not anticipate discovering the remnants of an ancient civilization far beneath the earth.

<Bargus ruffles his wiry moustache before glancing at you.>

This bears closer examination, don't you think?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}

==Progress==
It would seem we've made quite the discovery...

==Completion==
More queries and very few answers.

Fortunately, the device was able to gather some data from the energy readings.

It will take time to process, but we will soon have a better understanding of this "[[Siren Crystal]]."

In the meantime, let's take a closer look at that ring and citrine shard you found. [[Angorla]] here will be able to help.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Bargus|This bears closer examination. After you. See what you can find...}}
:''Bargus approaches the [[Skeletal Remains (Siren Isle)|Skeletal Remains]].''

Interact with the remains:
{{Dialogue|
<Skeletal remains sit slumped against the rocks. Their ribcage and legs are shattered as if crushed by something heavy.

In their outstretched hand sits a gleaming, rune-carved ring.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Take the ring.>}}
}}
:''[[Rune-Carved Ring]] is obtained.''
:{{Text|bossemote|The Vault trembles ominously as energy from the Crystal surges into the nearby rubble.}}

:{{Text|emote|Bargus looks up from the rune stone and glances around as the Vault trembles.}}
:{{Text|yell|Bargus|By the [[titan]]s! An ancient construct?}}

Vault Guardian attacks. Kill it and loot [[Cracked Citrine]].
:{{Text|say|Bargus|This is... more of an adventure than even I desired. We should get this artifact back to the workshop for examination.}}

The Skeletal Remains has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
<The skeletal remains sits slumped against the rocks. Its ribcage and legs are shattered and crushed by something heavy.

Their outstretched hand sits empty as if it once clutched something.>
}}

Talk to Bargus:
{{Dialogue|
As much as my curiosity protocol has been activated, the defenses in this structure are relentless.

We would be wise to regroup at the camp and reassess what we've found. We will return to study more of this crystal at another time.

{{Gossip|quest=|Let's get out of here.}}

:''The adventurer is surrounded by a Redeployment Module and teleported back to [[Flotsam Shoal]].''

Turn in to Bargus. [[Angorla]] next to him offers the next quest.

This quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].
