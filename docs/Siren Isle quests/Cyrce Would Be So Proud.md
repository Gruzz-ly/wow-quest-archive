==Objectives==
Fly in the Skypiercer to see if [[:Cyrce's Circlet]] can protect you from the high winds.
* Survive a ride in the [[Skypiercer]]

==Description==
It ain't no secret the winds here are terrible.

But! I don't think we've given that ring there a fair chance at fightin' 'em. I mean, that thing can let ya swim like a fish, make tornadoes outta nothin', and even shock the invisibility off of magical boxes! Surely it's got somethin' to say about a lil' nasty weather, right?

Take my balloon up and see if you can keep it stable usin' that ring of yours. Maybe we can find the trick for stayin' in the sky!

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Wings of the Siren|Cyrce's Circlet now passively allows you to control the winds, allowing you to take flight on Siren Isle.|icon=ability_racial_wingbuffet|id=470170}}

You will also receive:
*[[Raw Singing Citrine]]
*[[Cyrce's Circlet (toy)]]

==Progress==
If that ring could help us outta storms, that'd be amazin'!

==Completion==
Looks like the ring does work on high winds an' storms!

Ya wouldn't think about givin' a girl the ring as a loaner, would ya? I got some races I could win with that ring... we could be partners! Split our winnings 30/70. How about 40/60? Aw, you're killin' me. Fine, 50/50?

Still no? All right, forgettaboutit. It was a nice dream while it lasted.

==Notes==
Hop on the nearby [[The Skypiercer]]. It has three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Portside Winds|Push the winds away on the left side.|icon=misc_arrowleft|id=473842}}
#{{Abilities|Push Forward|Push the winds behind you to propel forward.|icon=misc_arrowlup|id=473844}}
#{{Abilities|Starboard Winds|Push the winds away on the right side.|icon=misc_arrowright|id=473843}}

Use them per the instructions:
*{{Text|bossemote|Fight against this tunnel of air. Push Forward!}}
*{{Text|bossemote|Gusts on our starboard. Push Right!}}
*{{Text|bossemote|Winds upon the portside. Push left!}}
