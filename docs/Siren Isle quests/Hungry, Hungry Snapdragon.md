==Objectives==
Collect 8 Mystery Meat Snacks by killing creatures around the [[Siren Isle]].
*[[Mystery Meat Snack]]s collected (8)

==Description==
<The snapdragon seems to recognize you as you approach. Its ear fins wiggle with anticipation.

It is hungry again and looks at you expectantly. It seems to want meat and doesn't seem care where it comes from.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The snapdragon stirs as you approach, its unnaturally-intelligent eyes scanning you.

Clearly it hopes you have brought it a meal.>

==Completion==
<The snapdragon barely waits for you to drop the rations before voraciously devouring them. Clearly it was hungry.

Once it finishes, it looks contented and drowsy. You realize it won't be this way for long. Perhaps you should try to feed it again tomorrow.>

==Notes==
Mystery Meat Snack drops from most mobs on the Siren Isle.
