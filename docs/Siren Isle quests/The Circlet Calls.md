'''The Circlet Calls''' unlocks the Siren Isle's main activities and events.

==Objectives==
Equip Cyrce's Circlet and socket the Windsinger's Runed Citrine into the Singing Wind Socket.

Then, remove the Windsinger's Runed Citrine from the socket.
* [[:Cyrce's Circlet]] equipped
* [[Windsinger's Runed Citrine|Singing Citrine]] socketed into the ring
*Singing Citirine{{sic}} unsocketed from the ring

==Description==
<[[Angorla]] peers at you from over her spectacles with excitement.>

Can you hear it, <name>?

This small, humble citrine is calling out to the circlet... just as the [[Siren Crystal]] called out to you and to all of us.

I am uncertain what will happen when you reunify them... but there's only one way to find out.

Place the circlet upon your finger and socket the citrine into the setting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
Have you placed the citrine into the circlet, <name>?

==Completion==
I can feel it from here... radiating. Thrumming with a long-dormant power.

Who carved these small little citrines? Why do they appear to fit perfectly into the Circlet yet... they were found separated?

Oh, how I wish I had seen what you and Bargus had found within the Vault...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Angorla|The crystal is calling to the ring...}}

Equip the ring and socket [[Windsinger's Runed Citrine]].
:{{Text|say|Angorla|Can you feel it, <name>? The artifact has awakened!}}

Then unsocket it, which completes the objectives. After turning in, be prepared for new quests related to Siren Isle's activities as well as [[Talking Head]]s regarding Excavations.

This quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].
