==Objectives==
Collect 15 Nesting Papers from the [[wyvern]] nests around [[Siren Isle|the island]].
*[[Ruffled Pages]] (15)
*Use [[Grappling Hold|grapple hold]] to scale cliffs (Optional)

==Description==
Many of the wyvern on this isle have crafted their nests from folios, scrolls, and documents they scavenge from the isle's ruins.

Because of this, their nests may hold the clues we need to understand the full history of this place.

Our [[scout]]s have secured grappling holds for you to climb to their nests, but use any means you like to recover the paper the wyverns have used as nesting material. Our knowledge of the isle's history depends on it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]
*One of:
**3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]] ([[The War Within Season 1|Season 1]])
**3x [[Weathered Ethereal Crest]] ([[The War Within Season 3|Season 3]])

One-time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
I really want to see what's on the papers the wyvern have taken!

==Completion==
A little nibbled and chewed, but I can still make out the writing on these pages. Great work, <name>!

==Notes==
Get to the high ground to find the pages in wyvern nests.

The quest is a criterion of [[Siren-ity Now!]]
