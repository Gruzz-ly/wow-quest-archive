Eliminate 2 rare enemies on the Siren Isle.
*Rare Siren Isle enemies slain (2)

==Description==
A veritable menagerie of dangerous creatures have attacked us since we set up our encampment.

While my troops can manage most threats, some of the more powerful creatures may require your expertise.

Scour the island and eliminate any powerful entities that might jeopardize our operations here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
How goes the hunt? Is our encampment safe for now?

==Completion==
Fine work, <name>. I could use someone like you in my crew. It's a shame you weren't born Arathi.

==Notes==
The quest is a criterion of [[Siren-ity Now!]]
