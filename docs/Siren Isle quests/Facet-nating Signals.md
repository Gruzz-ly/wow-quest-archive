==Objectives==
Meet Bargus by the Crystal and help him set up the pylons.
* Meet up with [[Bargus]]
* First [[Earthen Pylon]] Activated
* Second Earthen Pylon Activated
* Third Earthen Pylon Activated

==Description==
Intriguing!

These radiant remnants from the [[Arathi]] seemed to have given our device the necessary focus it needed. All that remains is to attune it properly to its size.

In order to attune to the signal, we'll need to set up some pylons around the site.

There is testing to initiate, <name>. Follow me if you would like to assist me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
Once the pylons are operational, I should be able to triangulate the signal.

==Completion==
Fascinating!

The pylons' attunement indicates this crystal is far larger than this facet would suggest.

According to the complexity of the signature, it appears to stretch for miles beneath our feet and--wait, what is this?

A second signature appears to be originating from over the hill? Curious indeed...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Bargus|I'll set some metal pylons to focus the signal. Meet me over the hill.}}
:''Bargus leaves the camp. He has the Augmented Crystal Scanner buff.'' 

Head to the [[Ghoststone Diggings]] at {{Co|48.8|44.7|Siren Isle}} to find Bargus hammering on an [[Earthen Pylon]]. [[Almyr Sunhart]] nearby watches the crystal on the ground.
:{{Text|say|Bargus|And that part... goes over there...}}
:''Bargus finishes hammering on the Earthen Pylon, then steps away.''

Use the pylon:
:{{Text|say|Almyr Sunhart|This singing crystal is remarkably like [[Beledar]]. We should treat it with reverence.}}

Interact with the second pylon at {{Co|45.4|41.7|Siren Isle}}:
:{{Text|say|Bargus|Signal augmented. One more reading should calibrate the device.}}

Interact with the third pylon at {{Co|44.9|44.1|Siren Isle}}:
:{{Text|say|Bargus|That's it! Its energies are beyond my capacity to process. The crystal extends far beneath the surface!}}

This quest is a criterion of [[A Song of Secrets]].
