==Objectives==
Free 7 Charmed Troops and slay Macabea The Sea Banshee.
*[[Macabea The Sea Banshee]] slain
*Charmed Troops dispelled (7)
*[[Sonic Scrambler]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[siren]]s... they're out there! And I wonder... was it the crystal or these creatures that the [[Kul Tiran]]s named [[Siren Isle|this isle]] after?

Whichever it may be, these sirens' call has lured many of our forces to their doom.

Our [[goblin]] [[Gazlowe's Greasemonkeys|allies]] have prepared a device to remove the control they have over our troops.

Eliminate these "sirens" and dispel the charm that holds our troops captive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 9,150 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One-time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
Have you eliminated the siren threat?

==Completion==
Excellently executed, <name>. No soul should succumb to such dreadful creatures again.

==Notes==
Use the Sonic Scrambler on [[Greaseguard Acquisitioner]]s and [[Arathor Scout]]s. Just killing the charmed mobs counts toward the objective as well.

The quest is a criterion of [[Siren-ity Now!]]
