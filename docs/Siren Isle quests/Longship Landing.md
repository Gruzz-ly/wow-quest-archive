==Objectives==
Eliminate 15 Bloodwake Vrykul.
*[[Bloodwake]] [[Vrykul]] slain (15)

==Description==
These Bloodwake vrykul have no regard for us or our research. Even when we tried to share our discoveries with them, we were attacked!

They do not care that we mean [[Siren Isle|the isle]] no harm--they want us to leave.

But we cannot leave now. There is so much more to discover! Someone must show them that we're not going to go just yet and that they should leave us alone.

We need to show them we will fight back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*3x [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]
*30x [[Valorstones]]

One time Warband bonus:
*200x [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (first time) or 100 [[Flame-Blessed Iron]] (alts)

==Progress==
Did you convince them to leave us alone yet?

==Completion==
I am not one to promote violence as a solution, but sometimes force is the only option.

==Notes==
The quest is a criterion of [[Siren-ity Now!]]
