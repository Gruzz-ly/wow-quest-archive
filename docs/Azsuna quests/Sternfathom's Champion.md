==Objectives==
Report to [[Sternfathom]] as his new pitfighter.

==Description==
Since you defeated [[Ooker Dooker]], there's a pit fighter spot open on Sternfathom's team. You should go establish yourself as his champion. That way, the [[giant]]s won't think twice about why a stranger is suddenly coming and going as <he/she> pleases. Meanwhile, I'll start to sow some chaos so that we can strike at [[Prince Oceanus]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,480 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
Hello, what can I do for you, little <race>?

Ahahaha... it's you!  I like how you came in and immediately confronted [[Boss Whalebelly|Whalebelly]]. That little [[tuskarr]]'s got it coming.

I can tell you're going to win big for me in the arena.

==Progression==
{{Against the Giants}}
