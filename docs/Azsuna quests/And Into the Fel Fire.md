==Objectives==
Survey digsites in Azsuna and find 10 missing Parts of the [[Infernal Device]] and bring them back to [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]].
* [[Part of the Infernal Device]] (10)

==Description==
I found something, <name>. Well, a couple of things actually.

First I found an ancient text talking about a [[demon]] who harnessed the power of the [[titan]] disc I've been searching for.

Then I found a device which supposedly is used to summon 'im! Only, it's missin' some pieces from what I can make out.

I'm sure if we survey around [[Azsuna]] some more, those missin' pieces are sure ta turn up.

==Progress==
From what I can make out, I think there's only seven or eight parts we need...

==Completion==
Aye, that's all of 'em, <lad/lass>. I'll just fix this up and we'll see what happens.
