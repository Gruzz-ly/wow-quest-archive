==Objectives==
Obtain 3 Hatecoil Glyptics.
* [[Hatecoil Glyptic]] (3)

==Description==
In order to find the spirits of our family, I will need materials to scry their location.

The [[naga]] carry magical trinkets imbued with [[ley line|ley]] energy that is better-attuned to this land than anything we have in [[Dalaran]]. If I had a few of those, I could do some real scrying.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
I would have brought my own spell foci if SOMEONE hadn't been rushing me...

==Completion==
Perfect. Let's get this ritual started, shall we?

==Progression==
{{Azsuna versus Azshara}}
