==Objectives==
Slay [[demon]]s in the [[Felblaze Ingress]].
*Felblaze demons slain  (10)

==Description==
The demons of Felblaze Ingress are amassing at an exponential rate.

We must cull these invaders before they have enough demons to flank our forces at [[Illidari Stand]].

Will you join us in battle?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That should stall these demons for a time. We may need to return in the future to ensure they have not regrouped.

==Progression==
# [[Felblaze Ingress (quest)]]
# [[Eye See You]]
# [[They're Doing it Wrong]] & [[Arkethrax (quest)]] & [[Quantity Over Quality]]
