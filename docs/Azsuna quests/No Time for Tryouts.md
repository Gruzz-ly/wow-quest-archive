==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ooker Dooker.jpg|Ooker Dooker|Send this guy packing so that you can take his place on Sternfathom's team.}}
Deliver a beatdown to [[Ooker Dooker]].
* Give Ooker Dooker a beatdown

==Description==
We don't have time for you to go through a lengthy set of tryouts. But, fighting in the arena is our best chance at getting you in good with the [[giant]]s.

That kind-hearted giant over there that's losing against [[Bilgerudder]] is [[Sternfathom]]. If you were to defeat his [[hozen]] champion, you'd make yourself a spot on his team.

Looks like Ooker Dooker's taking a rest between bouts. Now's the time to deliver a good ol' monkey beatdown.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|q1=|Shiny Ookin' Bauble
|q2=|Mundane Ookin' Curio
|q3=|Precious Ookin' Coin
|q4=|Polished Dookin Ring
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
*18,500 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
By giving that hozen a good beating, you'll be making a spot for yourself in the arena.

You don't have to kill him, though.

==Completion==
You made quick work of that monkey. Now there's an empty position on Sternfathom's team that you can fill.

But first, let's get me set up for what comes after your big match.

==Progression==
{{Against the Giants}}
