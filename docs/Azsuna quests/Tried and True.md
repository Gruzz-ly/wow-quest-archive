==Objectives==
Find the remaining 15 Azsunian Key Mold Pieces and return them to [[Tae'thelan]].
*[[Azsunian Key Mold Piece]] (15)

==Description==
I have realized [[Uncovering the Orb of Sciallax|through experience]] that the old methods are usually the best and for good reason. I'm done with alternate means of digging for now, and wish to focus on the right way to do things.

That being said, I believe I've found a new powerful artifact and I'll do literally anything to have it.

I've uncovered a fragment that appears to be a mold for a key. I now simply need the other pieces. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered any of the other pieces yet?

==Completion==
Yes, I believe that's all of them.

<Tae'thelan carefully reconstructs the mold.>

And now we just need to forge a new set of keys.

==Progression==
