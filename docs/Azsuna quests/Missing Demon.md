==Objectives==
Find [[Daglop]] in [[Azsuna]].

==Description==
I seem to have misplaced my [[imp]], Daglop.

If you see him, tell him to check in.

Normally I would just resummon him but I'm worried blind [[Marius Felbane|Marius]] here will kill him first and ask questions later.

No vision, that one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yeah yeah, the new master sent you. I get it. I have to deal with [[Sharazaan|my former master]] first.
