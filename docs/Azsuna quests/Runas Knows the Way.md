==Objectives==
Allow Runas to escort you.
* Follow [[Runas the Shamed|Runas]]

==Description==
I wish to make it up to you for whatever I did that made you want to kill me.

Hmm... your dragon complains about being weak. I know why. Runas can fix that, my friend.

One of my kind, [[Ael'Yith]], pulls ley energy from the very ground of [[Azsuna]]. I can take you to the location of his mana siphons.

It's not too late to undo the harm the others have done. You've done well to trust me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}} (at level 110)
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
I still don't trust him.

==Completion==
They're tapping into the [[ley line]]s?

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:Ahh, my friend. My good, dependable friend <name>.

:You wouldn't happen to have any mana crystals on you, would you?

:Listen, my friend. If you ever need anything - I stress, ANYTHING - you just come talk to your loyal friend Runas. I will make your problems go away. You can count on me.

:Of course, if I needed something, I assume you would assist me, correct? For example, if I needed a mana crystal or something similar, you would give me one?

:{{gossip|Just... just lead the way Runas.}}

;Being escorted
:''Runas mounts up on a [[Mystic Runesaber]] while with a zap, [[Senegos]] dissipates his projection.''
:{{text|say|Runas the Shamed|Very good! Off to [[Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar|Zarkhenar]], then. Off to see all my friends and family and loved ones.}}
:{{text|say|Runas the Shamed|...to kill them, of course, for harming your dragon.}}
:{{text|say|Runas the Shamed|Bunch of mana addicts, that lot, ha hah! Not me, though. My discipline is iron.}}
:{{text|say|Runas the Shamed|Ooh! Mana crystal. Just a moment.}}
:''Runas dismounts and interacts with a mana crystal to the side of the path for a moment. He then mounts back up and continues escorting the [[adventurer]].''
:{{text|say|Runas the Shamed|So... why are you here in Azsuna, friend? Just visiting, or...?}}
:''They reach the Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar and Senegos' resummons his projection beside the road.''
:{{text|say|[[Projection of Senegos]]|Does this one ever stop talking?}}
:{{text|say|Runas the Shamed|My apologies, good dragon. Ahh, look! We are here.}}
