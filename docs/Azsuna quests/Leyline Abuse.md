==Objectives==
Slay Ishkhaneth and Tyndrissen.
*[[Tyndrissen]] slain
*[[Ishkaneth]] slain

==Description==
These monsters are pulling mana directly out of the ground. This explains why not even my mana pools can dull my pain.

I worry about my [[Blue dragonflight|brood]]. Without the power of the [[ley line]]s, we are nothing. At this rate, I may not even be able to help you with your [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]].

Look for their mana siphons, and punish the cowardly [[nightfallen]] elves that are using them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}} (at level 110)
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
With each one of these cretins you slay, I grow stronger.

==Completion==
I do feel a bit stronger.

Those siphons nearly did me in, <name>.
