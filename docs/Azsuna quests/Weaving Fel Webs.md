==Notes==
*The world quest is available only during the Legion Invasions.
*The world quest starts upon entering the [[Lost Orchard]] in [[Azsuna]].
*[[Webbed Victim]]s are in slimy green cocoons; just attack until you free the [[Nar'thalas Citizen]]s. Attack Felcrawler Eggs to smash, or trample them with your mount. If you have a ranged attack, this can do both objectives without aggroing mobs nearby them.
