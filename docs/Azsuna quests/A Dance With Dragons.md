==Objectives==
Speak with [[Stellagosa]] to ride back to [[Shal'Aran]].

==Description==
I must say I am impressed, <name>.

You and your friend were able to fix a [[ley line]], and you are not even dragons!

You both seem exhausted by this ordeal. Allow me to help you get back home.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
That is quite the adventure you had. Thankfully we now have plenty of mana for the refugees. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
: ''Valtrois kneels.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|I must rest before we make our way back to Shal'Aran. That was more taxing than I expected...}}
: ''Stella heads upward toward the entrance of the cave.''
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|You have done enough, arcanist. I shall take you both to Shal'Aran. Come with me.}}

Get out of the cave. Stellagosa will be waiting for you just outside in [[blue dragon]] form.

;Speak with Stellagosa to ride back to Shal'Aran.
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Your control over such vast energies is impressive. That was no small task.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|You made an excellent assistant. Your inherent knowledge of ley lines is almost as expansive as mine.}}
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Yes, and I know the convergence of ley lines feeds great power to the [[Nightwell]]. Harnessing that much power is perilous, but if [[Elisande|she]] could...}}
: NOTE: The conversation is currently bugged and will not continue from here.
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|I know what she would be capable of. That is why we must stop her.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|You go on ahead and inform [[Thalyssra]]. I have a few questions for our friend here.}}
:''Stellagosa lands near the entrance to Shal'Aran and dismounts you.''
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Yes? What do you want to know?}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Do you actually visualize the lines, or is it more that you sense them? Is it a constant sensation, or can you turn it on and off?}}
:''Stellagosa flies away, with Valtrois still on her back.''

The name of this quest is a reference to [[wikipedia:A Dance with Dragons|the fifth novel]] in [[wikipedia:George R. R. Martin|George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[wikipedia:A Song of Ice and Fire|A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novel series.
