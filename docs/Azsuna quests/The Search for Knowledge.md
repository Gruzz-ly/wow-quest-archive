==Objectives==
Look for ancient relics on the shoreline of [[Azsuna]].

==Description==
While you were out gallivanting, did you notice any lost relics around Azsuna? My sources tell me there are treasures to be found. These rumors merit investigation!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
* 1,510 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A sodden, aged tome lies partially buried in the muck.

==Notes==
*[[Missing Shipments]] must be completed for this quest to become available, however, this is just a breadcrumb if [[A Mysterious Text]] is not taken during the Missing Shipments quest.
