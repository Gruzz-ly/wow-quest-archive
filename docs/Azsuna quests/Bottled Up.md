'''Bottled Up''' is picked up from the first [[murloc]]s you kill while doing [[Our Very Bones]].

==Objectives==
Take Okuna's Message to [[Lady Irisse]].
* [[Okuna's Message]] (provided)

==Description==
<You've found a message in a bottle on the corpse. It's a request for aid from someone named [[Okuna Longtusk]]. Okuna claims that he and his fellow shipmates are being held prisoner by [[sea giant]]s.

Maybe if you show the note to the ghost of Lady Irisse at the [[Crumbled Palace]], she can point you in the right direction?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,480 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|83|50}} at lvl 110)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
You say you found this message in a bottle?  How quaint.

Yes, I can point you in the right direction, but are you sure you want to take on the sea giant prince and his [[skrog]]s?  Just to free a bunch of unwashed sailors?

==Progression==
{{Against the Giants}}
