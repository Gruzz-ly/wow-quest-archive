==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Runas the Shamed.jpg|Runas the Shamed}}
Slay Runas the Shamed.
* [[Runas the Shamed]] slain
* Escort Runas to [[Senegos]]

==Description==
I fell so quickly, <name>. I am not as strong as I once was. We truly do need your help.

One of these disgusting creatures ran off with several of the whelplings. I heard him called by name:

Runas.

I will survive. Home is not far. You still have strength, though. Slay this Runas before he does any more damage to our brood.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nightfallen's Desperation
|Runas' Nearly Depleted Ley Crystal
|Talisman of the Lost Blue Flight
|Nightfallen Mantle
|Mana-Stalker Shoulderpads
|Whelp Protector's Mantle
|Azure Champion's Pauldrons

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
Ah, Stella. Always so quick to act. She is still young.

==Completion==
Keep your distance from that one, <name>.

Those fallen elves are all the same. As two-faced as they come.

==Notes==
Starting from where Stellagosa was and facing southwest on the map, follow the path in front of you until it splits off into three directions. Take the far left path and follow it to the cave known as [[Runas's Hovel]]. Runas will be laying on a fur rug a bit past the center of the cave. Once you have beaten him into submission, head back to the [[Projection of Senegos]].
