==Objectives==
Find a Dim Ley Crystal, then revive 10 Mana-Drained Whelplings.
*[[Dim Ley Crystal]]
*[[Mana-Drained Whelpling]]s revived (10)

==Description==
<The whelpling is alive, but unconscious. One of the withered must have already drained it of mana.>

<You've [[Their Dying Breaths|already learned]] that exposed ley crystals contain a small amount of magical energy. Perhaps you can use one to revive some of the whelps.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}} (at level 110)
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
Clever <race>. Yes, a ley crystal should bring them back to their senses.

==Completion==
I owe you a great debt, <name>.

Helping a weakened old dragon like me is valorous enough. Saving my whelplings, and securing the future of our line?

I am now firmly committed to your cause.

==Notes==
Make sure to get [[The Withered]] from [[Agapanthus]] before starting out.

Go out across the bridge and up the road to the northeast, and take out the Withered so you can get to the whelplings.  You will most likely notice [[Stellagosa]], who offers the quest [[Runas the Shamed (quest)]].

At this point you have two choices:

1. Accept her quest and continue on to get all three objectives done, then return to base to turn it.

2. In the interests of seeing story progression, '''ignore her quest''', complete the first two quests and go back to turn them in.  At this point, Senegos will offer [[Stellagosa (quest)]], leading you back to her to take her quest.
