==Objectives==
Let the Bloodstone feed on the blood of [[demon]]s.
*Bloodstone fed

==Description==
Bloodstones contain a great deal of power that can only be awakened once they are fed.

Yet this stone does not feast on fish and cakes. It hungers for blood: the more powerful, the better.

There's an infestation of demons just east of here. I need you to nourish my stone with their blood, so that I may unlock its power. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|60}}
* 15,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Has the bloodstone been sated yet?

==Completion==
The Bloodstone looks sated. Well done! Now it's time for a test...

==Notes==
Travel to [[Felblaze Ingress]] and kill the nearby demons. Slaying a [[Felguard Invader]] will fill 10 units on the Bloodstone bar, while [[Chaos Spawn]] will grant only 5 each.

Return to Kira when the bar is completely filled.
