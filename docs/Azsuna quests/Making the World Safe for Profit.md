{{questportrait|Queen Kraklaa.png|Queen Kraklaa|Slay the queen and deal with anything or anyone that gets in your way.}}
Kill 12 [[gilblin]] and/or [[makrura]] at [[Mak'rana]] and slay their leader, [[Queen Kraklaa]].
*Gilblin & Makrura slain (12)
*Deal with Queen Kraklaa

==Description==
Might I ask a small favor, my friend? These creatures in the tide pools to the east are starting to frighten me. Our efforts to trade with them have been rebuffed at every turn with aggression. This is not good; neither for running a business, nor for profit.

Sadly, I must admit the time for talk has come to an end.

Might you be willing to serve as my representative in dealing with the denizens of Mak'rura and their "queen"?

I can assure you that your efforts will be rewarded commensurately.

==Rewards==

*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
What? A [[Jailer (demon)|jailer]] [[demon]] you say? [[Oublion]]? What a ghastly name.

No wonder we couldn't become trade partners with them. Oh, if only I'd known, there wouldn't have been any need for such slaughter!

Ah well. Live and learn.
