==Rewards==
You will receive:

==Progress==
;Leyworm Tunnels covered
: {{text|say|Stellagosa|What's that?! One of the bigger worms is burrowing through! Stand ready!}}

==Completion==

== Notes ==
Triggers in Leyhollow in [[Azsuna]]. Pick up a Heavy Stone and heave it over to a tunnel opening once you've cleared your path of anything hostile; being attacked will make you drop it. Once in position, use the special action button Drop Stone to drop it at your feet.

When the first two are complete, the Ualair objective will become available.
