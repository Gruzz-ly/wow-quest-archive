==Objectives==
* [[Vintner Liastrin]] slain
* [[Grand Vintner Valiana]] slain
* Barrels of [[Arcane-aged Wine]] smashed (3)
* [[Haunted Vines]] burned (6)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Prince Farondis]]|The specters here continue to concoct a wine so foul it serves only to poison the drinker. [[Azsuna]] would be better served with them gone.}}

== Rewards ==
* +150 reputation with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|[[Prince Farondis]]|That should help to contain the spread of their corrupted... spirits. You have my thanks.}}

== Notes ==
Triggers at [[Challiane's Terrace]]/[[The Lost Orchard]] in Azsuna. The barrels can interacted with while mounted, but not the vines. This will spawn five [[Deathly Vintage]] oozes. There are often [[Lost Laborer]]s flying about while carrying a barrel, but attacking them doesn't give credit.

Also, note that there are barrels of [[Mystically Sealed Olive Oil]] that are highlighted for the quest, but these do NOT give any sort of credit.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.0|note=''[[Legion]]'' World Quests for the [[Highmountain Tribe]], [[Nightfallen (faction)|Nightfallen]], [[Army of the Light]], and [[Argussian Reach]] now reward increased reputation.}}
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
