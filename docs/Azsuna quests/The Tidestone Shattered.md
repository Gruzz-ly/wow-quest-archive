==Objectives==
Collect the 5 Tidestone Shards.
* [[Tidestone Shard]] (5)
* [[Tidestone Vault Key (usable)]] (provided)

==Description==
I suppose you can go in, then.

The shattered pieces of the [[Tidestone of Golganneth]] are contained within the [[Nar'thalas Academy|academy]]'s eastern wing. Even as curator, I cannot attest to their condition, as I have not been in to inspect them in many millennia.

Oh, young <name>? Please do not touch anything.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
<The last remaining piece of the Tidestone lies before you.>

==Completion==
<You notice the reflection of something sinister upon the core's surface...>

==Notes==
Immediately after you turn in the quest, a frostbolt freezes you inside a block of ice. [[Athissa]] and [[Warlord Parjesh]] move in.

:{{Text|say|Athissa|How perfectly convenient... the brainless <race> led us right to the Tidestone.}}
:{{Text|say|Athissa|[[Queen Azshara|Our Queen Beneath the Tides]] can reassemble the pieces.}}
:{{Text|say|Athissa|As for you... you will make an acceptable slave.}}

The screen fades to black, and you appear in the [[Hatecoil Slave Pen]], chained to a wall and guarded by two [[Hatecoil Myrmidon]]s.

:{{Text|say|Hatecoil Myrmidon|What should we do with this one?}}
:{{Text|say|Hatecoil Myrmidon|Torture? Hard labor? Kill it?}}
:{{Text|say|Hatecoil Myrmidon|I say we kill it.}}
:{{Text|say|Hatecoil Myrmidon|Good idea, let's kill it.}}

Suddenly, [[Prince Farondis]] runs in and blasts one of the guards with a fireball. The other turns to him.

:{{Text|say|Hatecoil Myrmidon|Huh?}}

Farondis kills the other guard as well, then offers the next quest, [[Save Yourself]].

If you are disconnected during the cutscene, or [[Hearthstone]] away from the Hatecoil Slave Pen before Farondis appears, you can follow the quest marker for [[Save Yourself]] on your map and pick it up from Farondis.
