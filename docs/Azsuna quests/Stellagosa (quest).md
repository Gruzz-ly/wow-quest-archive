'''Stellagosa''' is an optional breadcrumb quest only available when you turn in [[The Consumed]] and [[The Withered]], and did '''not''' take [[Stellagosa]]'s quest [[Runas the Shamed (quest)]].

Something is wrong, <name>.

I sent Stellagosa to assist you, but I can no longer sense her.

Please, go out there and find out what's happened to my granddaughter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

*1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==

Go past the [[Projection of Senegos]] and up the stairs. Take the left path and follow it until you reach a fork. Go left again and stay on that path until you reach Stellagosa.
