==Objectives==
Use the Bloodstone on an [[Imprisoned Imp]].
* Bloodstone tested
*[[Bloodstone (quest)]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that the Bloodstone has fed, I hope to use its power to bend the will of demons that would otherwise not be so easily controlled.

Of course, this is all theory. I have never witnessed the direct effect of the Bloodstone's power on a demon. This is where you come in.

I have procured a few [[imp]]s that should make suitable test subjects. Use the Bloodstone on them and report back to me with your findings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|60}}
* 15,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you tested the Bloodstone yet? I have imprisoned a few imps in the cave behind me that should make suitable test subjects.

==Completion==
The subject died during the testing process? Well that was unexpected.

Nonetheless, you've held up your end of the bargain. I suppose it's time for me to fulfill mine.
