==Objectives==
*[[Intact Murloc Eye]] (20)
*[[Egg of Gangamesh]]

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Prince Farondis]]|[[Magister Garuhod|Garuhod]] may have been onto something, but I think he got his ingredients mixed up. We should try a different combination. Maybe [[hydra]] eggs and [[murloc]] eyes?}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|Yes, these should do nicely. I'll have the court [[alchemist]] test this at once!}}

==Notes==
Triggers at [[El'dranil Shallows]] in [[Azsuna]]. The eggs are behind [[Gangamesh]] in a small cave around {{coords|51.5|32.5|Azsuna}}. There are plenty of murlocs here too.

==Progression==
{{Azsuna versus Azshara}}

==Patch changes==
