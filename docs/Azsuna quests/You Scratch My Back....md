==Objectives==
Release the whelplings on each of the Mana Collector Pylons in [[Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar|Zarkhenar]].
*Disable southern Mana Pylon {{co|56.4|15.3|Azsuna}}
*Disable central Mana Pylon {{co|56.0|14.1|Azsuna}}
*Disable northwestern Mana Pylon {{co|55.6|13.0|Azsuna}}
*Disable eastern Mana Pylon {{co|57.2|13.9|Azsuna}}

==Description==
Much better. I knew I could count on you, my friend. Allow me to return the favor.

I know how you can destroy the large mana collector pylons. We shall save your dragon yet!

The pylons only work against ground targets, yet they're defenseless from above. Send your whelplings at them, my friend. The whelplings can fly where we cannot.

Trust me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
With the pylons destroyed, [[Senegos]]' pool should now be re-energized.

==Notes==
You do not need to be close to the mana pylons in order to unleash the [[Vengeful Whelpling]]s, as the targeting reticule has a 70 yard range.  Each one has an energy field that will zap you for 5,000 arcane damage every second you're inside them.

*The quest initially ended with [[Stellagosa]]{{co|57.6|13.6|Azsuna}}.

;Completion
Whatever his motivations were, the pylons are broken now.  Grandfather's pool should be filling with mana again.

Now where did that Runas run off to?
