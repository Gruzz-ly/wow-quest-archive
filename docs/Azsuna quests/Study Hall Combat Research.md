==Description==
What's this? A new, confused student, desperately trying to win the favor of the headmistress, wandering the halls without anything to do?

Perfect! I need help with my research.

I'm writing a paper on combat. Grab me some books from the shelf over there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
I agree. Research can be grueling work.

==Completion==
My hand is beginning to tire from taking so many notes. I think it's time we took a break.

==Notes==
;Sythorne's comments
Upon quest accept:
*{{Text|say|Would you mind? I'm working on a very important paper, and it's difficult to concentrate with you neophytes shooting everything in sight.}}
*{{Text|say|I just read an interesting paper on the lowly kobold. Apparently, these creatures are more fierce than their visual affordance might suggest.}}
*{{Text|say|Fetch me a secondary reference on kobolds. I'd like to verify this hypothesis.}}
Once the Kobold Drawing is slain:
*{{Text|say|Fascinating.}}
*{{Text|say|Of course, a more pressing concern to our academy is the constant encroachment of the skrogs.}}
*{{Text|say|Unfortunately, I'm afraid that our library suffers a scarcity of information on these creatures.}}
*{{Text|say|Find me a book on skrogs. Anything will do.}}
Once the Sea Skrog Drawing is slain:
*{{Text|say|Lastly, I'd like to brush up on dragons. Blue dragons, to be precise.}}
*{{Text|say|We are currently on good terms with our northerly neighbors, but should our friendship wither, it can't hurt to know how they fight.}}

==Progression==
