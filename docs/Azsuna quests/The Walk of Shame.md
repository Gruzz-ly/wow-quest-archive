==Objectives==
Escort [[Prince Farondis]] around the edge of [[Ruins of Nar'thalas|Nar'thalas]].
* Escort Prince Farondis

==Description==
The echoes of Nar'thalas still haunt me, and I cannot bear the pain of this accursed town any longer. I may still be able to get you closer to the [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]], however.

<Farondis' eyes narrow in newfound determination.>

We will need to skirt around the edge of town. Follow me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
<The prince appears emotionally drained.>

This is the end of the road for me, <name>. I can't bear to look at them. Moreover, my mere presence puts you in danger.

Beyond this point, you must walk alone.
