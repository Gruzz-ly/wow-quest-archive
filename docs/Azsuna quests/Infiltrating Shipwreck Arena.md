==Objectives==
Infiltrate [[Shipwreck Arena]] and find [[Okuna Longtusk]].

==Description==
The [[Sea giant|giants]] at Shipwreck Arena are very fond of smashing ships that sail too close to shore.  They take the sailors prisoner and use them for their own amusement.

I suppose it will be easy for you to infiltrate the place.  It's breaking out that will be the difficult part.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
Did you get my bottle?  Are you here to help us escape?
