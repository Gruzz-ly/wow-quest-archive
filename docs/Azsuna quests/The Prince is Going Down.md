==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Prince Oceanus.jpg|Prince Oceanus|Cast the giants into disarray by killing their prince.}}
Free [[Okuna Longtusk]] and kill [[Prince Oceanus]].
*Prince Oceanus slain

==Description==
<Name>! I knew you'd come. Quick, let me out of here and we'll take this [[giant]] down.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|q1=|Leywalker Waistwrap
|q2=|Ruin-Stalker Belt
|q3=|Seaspray Belt
|q4=|Nar'thalas Girdle
|q5=|Buccaneer's Lucky Chain
}}

{{itembox|You will also receive:
|q1=|Giant Pearl Scepter
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|58|20|}}
*22,200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
With Oceanus dead, the [[skrog]]s will start fighting amongst themselves. They'll certainly be too busy to provide any further assistance to the [[naga]].

I'd say this was a job well done, despite my being captured. Good thing you came along.

I'll see you around, <name>.
