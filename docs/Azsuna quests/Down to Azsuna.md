==Objectives==
Speak with [[Archmage Khadgar]] to fly down to [[Azsuna]].
* Fly down with Khadgar

==Description==
<Name>, we must find a way to reseal the [[Tomb of Sargeras]].

I have uncovered information concerning an ancient relic, which might be the key to stopping the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

Our search begins on the ancient elven island of Azsuna. Long ago, it was where the [[Highborne]] elves of [[Suramar]] perfected their mightiest of magics. Now it is a cursed ruins.

The [[Illidari]] demon hunters have established a camp on the island. As they are the only people we know in the area, that is where we will begin.

Ready to take wing?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
It would seem that we have arrived at the crucial moment.

==Completion==
As I suspected, the Illidari are holding the line against the Burning Legion, but just barely.

We must come to their aid, <name>.
