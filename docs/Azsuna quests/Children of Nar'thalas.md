==Description==
Hi! <name>, right? The [[archmage]]s in [[Dalaran]] said we might see you down here.

[[Olothil Starlance|My brother]] and I are here on a reconnaissance mission. We're looking for our parents.

We've lived our entire lives thinking that our family was killed in [[Azsuna]] several thousand years ago, but look around! Most of the elves here are [[ghost]]s.

Olothil's been searching through books for clues as to why, but we could use some help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
This [[Prince Farondis]] opposed [[Queen Azshara]], so she got mad and blew everything up? That's awesome!

Hey Olothil, listen to this!
