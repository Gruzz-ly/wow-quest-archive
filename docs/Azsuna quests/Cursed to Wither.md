==Objectives==
Find the nightfallen that entered Leyhollow.

==Description==
So [[Cedonu]] said he saw [[nightfallen]] going into [[Leyhollow]]?

I don't like the sound of that.

[[Senegos|Grandfather]] seems to be holding his own, but the [[Archmage Khadgar|archmage]] and I will keep an eye on him. You go investigate our caves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94}}
*1,480 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
<Name>? Is that you, my friend?

<Runas coughs violently.>

==Notes==
From Stellagosa, take the path leading ahead and continue going straight when you reach the fork. The Leyhollow cavern will be on your right.

==Progression==
{{Defending Azurewing Repose}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
