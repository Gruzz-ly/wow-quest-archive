Gather 8 Barrels of Gunpowder and return them to [[Fargo Flintlocke]] in [[Azsuna]].
* [[Barrel of Gunpowder (engineering)]] (8)

==Description==
So while we've got all tha parts for tha pack again, I'm afraid I'm all outta gunpowder.

This is the worst thing ta ever happen ta me.

But there's hope. Just o'er to tha north are caves filled with crashed ships. Chances are them [[sea giant]]s crashed one or two ships with cannons. And cannons mean gunpowder, sweet gunpowder.

Search their caves fer sum powder an' bring it on back.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Schematic: Gunpack (quest reward)]]

==Progress==
Try not ta get it wet, I dunna feel like waitin' fer it ta dry out.

==Completion==
Oh aye, tha's plenty, lad. I made sum adjustments ta tha design fer tha gunpack.

You should probably hold on to 'em, seein as 'ow these inventions of Hobart keep explodin' on me.
