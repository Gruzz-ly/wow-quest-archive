==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ael'Yith.jpg|Ael'Yith|He's been pestering you from atop his ruins.  Maybe it's time to pay him a visit...}}
Slay Ael'Yith.
*[[Ael'Yith]] slain

==Description==
<Senegos is focused.>

I sense it now. In the ruined building, to the east. One of these cretins must have tapped deep into the ley line.

I suspect he will be heavily defended, <name>. Once again, the well-being of my brood is in your hands.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Leywalker Wristwraps
|Ruin-Stalker Wristwraps
|Seaspray Wristwraps
|Nar'thalas Vambraces
|Leywalker Halo
|Ruin-Stalker Headgear
|Seaspray Coif
|Nar'thalas Helmet
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|58|20}}
*22,200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
He may not be slain, but at least he is gone.

Without their leader, the mindless [[withered]] should soon scatter and die.
