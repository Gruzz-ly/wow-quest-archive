==Objectives==
* [[Illegible Writings]] (10)
* [[Oracle's Scrying Orb]]

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Prince Farondis]]|[[Magister Garuhod|Garuhod]] once mentioned that he learned most of his recipes from the priestesses here. They've since gone mad and their writing are all gibberish to me, but it seems their oracle can still understand them.}}
: {{text|say|Prince Farondis|Perhaps she possesses the key to unlocking their knowledge.}}

==Gains==
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Prince Farondis|With this scrying orb, all their writings are clear as day! This should point us in the right direction to continue Garuhod's research.}}

==Notes==
*The World Quest starts upon entering the [[Garden of Elune]] area in [[Azsuna]].
*The quest items can be looted, drop from [[Fallen Priestess (Azsuna)|Fallen Priestesses]] and [[The Oracle]].

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
