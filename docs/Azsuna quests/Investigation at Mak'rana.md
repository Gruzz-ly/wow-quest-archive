* Kill [[Oublion]]

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Prince Farondis]]|Bad enough that [[naga]] and [[demons]] invade our home... now these [[makrura]] plague our shores! We must find out what dark force is driving them to madness. Will you help?}}

== Rewards ==
* +75 reputation with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
