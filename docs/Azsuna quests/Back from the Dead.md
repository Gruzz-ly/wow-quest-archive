==Description==
<[[Olothil Starlance|Olothil]] sighs.>

My sister tries my patience sometimes.

No matter. I've identified a few locations that our parents might be. I shall search in this area with [[Kallistia Starlance|Kallistia]]. You've already helped us so much... would you help us look to the east?

You can use my scrying orb to see the locations that our ritual has uncovered.
