==Objectives==
Collect the 3 parts of the Nightrose recipe.
* [[Nightrose Recipe: Part 1, Ingredients]]
* [[Nightrose Recipe: Part 2, Preparation]]
* [[Nightrose Recipe: Part 3, Instructions]]

==Description==
Please, outsider, help me.

My recipe for Nightrose wine was to be the toast of [[Queen Azshara]] herself. But before I could make it, the vile vintners took it from me and locked me away.

Please, recover my recipe so that I might bring it to [[Lady Challiane]] and earn the queen's favor.

==Progress==
Have you found the pieces of the recipe?

==Completion==
Thank you, outsider! Thank you very much.

You have done more for me than my own people ever have.

Lady Challiane would never take the word of a lowly cellarman over her vintners.

Now I can use this recipe to earn her favor, and then the favor of our beloved queen Azshara...
