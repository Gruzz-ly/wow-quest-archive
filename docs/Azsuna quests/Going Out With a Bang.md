==Objectives==
Use the Gunshoes to skim across the water while picking up 15 pieces of Gunpack Debris.
* [[Gunpack Debris]] (15)
* [[Hobart's Prototype Gunshoes]] (provided)

==Description==
While I was, eh, testin' out this new flight pack fer [[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart]], it sorta exploded an' sent me flyin' back over 'ere.

You can see all the pieces out there in tha water.

Now, I've got these boots 'ere that Hobart gave me to test out too, but they're not quite me size.

I figure we could kill two birds with one stone and 'ave ye test 'em out while pickin' up the broken bits of the pack.

Mind tha [[Reef Ravager|sharks]] while yer out there.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Schematic: Gunshoes]]

==Progress==
I'd go meself, but eh, me feet are jes' too big for them booties.

==Completion==
Ah terrific! Nice work gettin' them parts back. I thought I was gonna have ta drain the bay by blowin' up [[Isle of the Watchers|Warden's Isle]] over there.

Them boots seemed ta suit yeh - here's the schematic fer 'em if yeh need another pair.
