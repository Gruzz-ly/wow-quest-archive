==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Azurewing Whelplands]].

==Description==
We need help.

Since the fall of [[Deathwing]], we [[dragon]]s have lost nearly all of our power. To make matters worse, we can no longer bear eggs.

My [[whelp]]lings are the last of the last.

I need you, champion. Help defend my whelplands, and I swear to you, the [[Blue dragon|blues]] will be at your side when you need them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|1|94|}} at level 110
*1,480 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
Don't you worry, small one. I am still back in [[Azurewing Repose]], resting in my pool.

It doesn't take much energy to throw a projection of myself here and there. I may be old and dying, but I AM still a blue dragon.

==Notes==
Travel north a bit and take the path on the right. Follow it east until you reach the fork, then go left. Keep going north on the road until you have reached the ruins of a small courtyard. Go left again and follow it until you have reached the Azure Whelplands. Ahead, you'll see the [[Projection of Senegos]].
