==Objectives==
Obtain Lykill's Key and free Stellagosa.
* Find [[Stellagosa]]
* [[Lykill's Key]]
* Chains unlocked (3)

==Description==
During the fighting, of all things, I saw a [[blue drake]] swoop in and attack the [[demon]]s. I couldn't believe my eyes. I'd heard that the [[Blue dragonflight|Blue Dragonflight]] had gone extinct.

The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] managed to bring the drake down, but not until after she'd killed a score of them. She was magnificent. Last I saw, they were dragging her in the direction of the southern camp.

We should see if she's still alive. A [[dragon]] could prove a powerful ally.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Cape of Azure Fury
|Stellagosa's Breath
|Young Drake's Impulse
|The Jailer's Key 
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
*20,550 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
If there's a remnant of the Blue Dragonflight nearby, we should do whatever we can to ally ourselves with them.

==Completion==
Beautiful creatures... pure, one with the world. I didn't think that I could hate the Legion more.

Thank you, <name>.
