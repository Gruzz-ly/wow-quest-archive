==Objectives==
Speak with [[Archmage Khadgar]] at the [[Azurewing Repose]].

==Description==
For now, the [[Illidari]] can hold the line against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. We will return later to help them drive the Legion from the upper reaches of [[Faronaar]]. You and I must concentrate on the [[Pillars of Creation]] if the [[Tomb of Sargeras]] is to be resealed.

Your saving of [[Stellagosa]] is fortuitous. Surely if anyone knows where a Pillar of Creation is, it will be her grandfather, [[Senegos]].

The Azurewing Repose is to the northeast. I will meet you there, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|83|50}} (at level 110)
*1,480 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
He is... he's dying! Senegos is possibly the oldest dragon alive. We cannot simply let him slip away.

There is something not quite right with the magic energy here, I can feel it.

==Notes==
Follow the road leading northwest out Illidari Stand until you reach a fork. Go right and keep following the road until you see a purplish-blue trail to your left. Take that trail and you will reach Azurewing Repose.
