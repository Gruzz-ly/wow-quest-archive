==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Nightwatcher Idri]]|The most powerful [[mages]] at this temple conspire against the [[Nightwatchers]]. Show them how we deal with our enemies!}}

==Rewards==
* +250 reputation with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Nightwatcher Idri|Well fought! The enemies of the Nightwatchers pay dearly for their treachery.}}

==Notes==
*Triggers at the [[Temple of a Thousand Lights]], but the elite mobs are in the upper area behind the main temple, and up the road leading to it on the western side.
*The mobs are mostly spread out, with a few pairs. There are also single patrols, which you'll probably want to take out first, getting credit while removing a possible nasty surprise.
*Eligible mobs are [[Timeless Spellshaper]]s, [[Timeless Frostsoul]]s, [[Timeless Pyromancer]]s, [[Timeless Flamespeaker]]s, [[Timeless Leymage]]s, [[Timeless Coldwight]]s, [[Ever-burning Familiar]]s, [[Brilliant Familiar]]s, and [[Glacial Familiar]]s.

==Patch changes==
