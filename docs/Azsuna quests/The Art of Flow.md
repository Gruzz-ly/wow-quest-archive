==Objectives==
Protect [[Arcanist Valtrois]] while she completes the ritual.
*First beacon ritual complete
*Second beacon ritual complete
*Third beacon ritual complete

==Description==
All done, <name>! We have but one more step and [[Shal'Aran]] will have all the mana it needs.

Now that I have better access to the ley line below I can break the pool so that it will flow through properly. Given the chaotic state of this [[ley line]] it will require all of my concentration to redirect the energy.

I must warn you that we will attract attention while I am doing this. You will need to protect me while I complete the process.

Speak to me when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Highly Charged Mana Clog]]
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
This ritual will shake the pool of energy loose, allowing it to flow through the ley line unimpeded.

==Completion==
It is done. Shal'Aran will have no want of mana now.

==Notes==
During the rituals, protect Valtrois and Stellagosa from incoming [[withered]]: [[Hungering Wretch]]es, [[Ley-Ruins Thirster]], and [[Hulking Wretch]].

Talk to Valtrois to start the first ritual.

:Are you ready to begin the ritual, <name>?
''{{Gossip|I am ready, Valtrois.}}''

:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|The ritual demands my full concentration. Please ensure I am not interrupted.}}
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Allow me to aid you. This form is ill-suited for fighting in such close quarters, and we are accompanied by a capable champion.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|You may help me find the ley lines, if you must. Just try not to get in my way.}}

Talk to Valtrois again to start the second ritual.

:One down, two to go. Let me know when you are ready.
''{{Gossip|I am ready, Valtrois.}}''

:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|The currents are chaotic... this will take time.}}
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Whatever you plan to do, do it quickly. I sense the approach of something... hungry!}}

Talk to Valtrois again to start the third and final ritual.

:This is the last one. One last knot to work loose, and the energy should flow freely again.
:I hope you are ready.
''{{Gossip|I am ready, Valtrois.}}''

:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Almost... there. Just need to hold out a little longer!}}
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Look out, champion! It is here!}}

Upon finishing all rituals:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|It is done! The flow has been redirected to Shal'Aran.}}
