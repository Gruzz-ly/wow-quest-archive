==Objectives==
Find [[Kor'vas Bloodthorn]] on [[Faronaar]] at [[Vanquish Point]].

==Description==
Our demon hunters, Kor'vas Bloodthorn and [[Cyana Nightglaive]] took a small force of the [[Illidari]] across to Faronaar. Their mission was to weaken the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] from within.

I haven't heard from them in a while.

It would be best if you could find and lead them to success. Agreed?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}} (at level 110)
*[[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
Oh, <name>, it's you.  Good, we've got a little problem here.

<Altruis/Kayn> didn't think that Cyana and I could handle this on our own? He might have been right this time.

==Notes==
Follow the path leading south from [[Illidari Stand]]. When you reach a large, ruined building in front of you, turn left and follow it until you reach Kor'vas.

:{{text|say|Kayn Sunfury|[[Adventurer|You]], Kor'vas, and Cyana attack the Legion from within. Then, we will wipe them out together.}}

;Approach Kor'vas
:{{text|say|Kor'vas Bloodthorn|You are no demon.  Friend or foe?}}

;Quest complete
:{{text|say|Kor'vas Bloodthorn|We will work together to destroy the Legion from within.}}

After you complete this quest, no follow-up quests will be offered immediately. Kill a few demons, and Kor'vas will offer the next two quests.

When meeting other players on the follow-up quests, their Kor'vas is shown under the [[generic name]] "Demon Hunter" with an altered appearance.
