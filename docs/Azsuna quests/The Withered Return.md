==Objectives==
* [[Mana-Starved Whelpling]] revived (8)
* [[Withered]] slain (10)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Stellagosa]]|Friend, the withered are relentless in their attacks on our whelplands. They've left our captive young starving for mana!}}
: {{text|say|Stellagosa|Take back the mana crystals the withered stole and use them to revive the whelplings. Move quickly, friend!}}

== Rewards ==
* +75 reputation with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Stellagosa|Your actions have ensured a future for the [[blue dragons]] in [[Azsuna]]. With the withered's threat subsided, you've given us the time we need to recover.}}

== Notes ==
Triggers at the [[Azurewing Whelplands]] in Azsuna. Kill the [[Withered Exile]]s or loot {{item|Stolen Ley Crystal|s}} directly from the ground (the [[Withered Mana-Rager]]s do not drop crystals).

If you need to find groups of whelplings, [[Runas's Hovel]] or the nearby night elf building the dragons are using will have them.

You'll sometimes trigger Brood of Senegos, a one minute buff that has the whelplings you saved come and attack your target.

==Progression==
