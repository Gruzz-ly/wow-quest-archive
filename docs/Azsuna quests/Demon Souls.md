==Objectives==
Trap 8 demon souls on the [[Faronaar Front]].
* [[Demon]] [[soul]]s trapped (8)
* [[Soul Gem (Legion)]] (provided)

==Description==
I need to extract information about the [[Burning Legion]] from these foul creatures. But living, the [[demon]]s are almost impossible to break.

However, like you, I wield a powerful [[artifact]] -- the [[Scythe of Souls]].

Take one of my soul gems. If you place it next to a demon's corpse, it will rip the 'soul' out. Then, we will see if the scythe can get them to talk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}} (at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
We need those demon souls, <name>.

==Completion==
Yes. Already, I can tell their souls are weaker than their flesh.

==Notes==
