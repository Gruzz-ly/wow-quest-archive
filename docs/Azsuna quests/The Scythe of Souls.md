==Objectives==
Work with Allari the Souleater to compel information from the demon souls.
* Speak with [[Allari the Souleater]]
* First demon soul released
* First demon soul compelled
* Second demon soul released
* Second demon soul compelled
* Soul Gem entered
* [[Questioner Arev'naal|Arev'naal]] compelled
* Leave soul gem (Optional)
*Meet back up with Allari

==Description==
Let's head to the other side of the stand. We will release the demon souls one by one and get the answers that we seek concerning Lord [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]].

The [[Scythe of Souls]] will ensure that we do.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Band of Demonic Guile
|Leywalker Shoes
|Ruin-Stalker Footpads
|Seaspray Chain Boots
|Nar'thalas Sabatons
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*1,750 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
I wouldn't take what Arev'naal said to heart. The [[inquisitor]] demons are masters of misinformation. You don't suspect betrayal within the ranks, do you?

<The Souleater looks thoughtful and grim.>

I fear we won't have all of our answers about Lord Illidan for a while.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|Come, <class>, we are going to compel some demon souls.}}
:''Allari runs to the other side of the camp.''

Follow Allari to the filled soul gems at [[Illidari Stand]]. To exit the final soul gem, you can either interact with the soul gem again or right-click the [[buff]] to cancel it.

;Speak with Allari
{{Dialogue|
Together, we will release the demon souls from the gems and use the scythe to compel them to talk.

Let me know when you are ready to begin.

{{gossip|I'm ready, Allari. Let's begin.}}

;First demon
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|<Name>, break the first [[Soul Gem (Azsuna)|soul gem]] and release a [[Demon Soul (Azsuna)|demon soul]].}}
:''Allari channels the power of her scythe.''
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|Tell us everything you know, foul creature!}}
:{{text|say|Demon Soul|Ahahaha! We are Legion. We know you, Allari, and you, <name>. You will be ours.}}
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|Quickly, <name>, break the next soul gem.}}

;Second demon
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|Where is the Legion keeping Illidan's body? Tell me, or your suffering will be the stuff of legend.}}
:{{text|say|Demon Soul|Our combined will is greater than your scythe. I will not tell you.}}
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|I think I understand why this is not working.}}
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|A powerful demon I have kept trapped in the gems is helping them to resist.}}
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|<Name>, you must enter the soul gem and force [[Questioner Arev'naal|Arev'naal]] to reveal Lord Illidan's location.}}

;Enter the third soul gem
:{{text|say|Questioner Arev'naal|Ah, visitors. It's been a long time since Mardum, Allari.}}

;Aggro Arev'naal
:{{text|say|Questioner Arev'naal|You'll learn nothing from me, Souleater!}}
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|You WILL talk, foul demon!}}
:{{text|say|Questioner Arev'naal|Your own [[Illidari|order]] is unraveling. Betrayed from within... a curse you'll bear for all eternity.}}
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|What's he talking about? Meet me outside the gem.}}
