==Objectives==
Find [[Kor'vas Bloodthorn]] on [[Faronaar]] at [[Vanquish Point]].

==Description==
A few of our [[demon hunter]]s, Kor'vas Bloodthorn and [[Cyana Nightglaive]], took a small force of the Illidari across to Faronaar. Their mission was to weaken the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] from within.

I haven't heard from them in a while.

It would be best if you could find and lead them to success. Agreed?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}} (at level 110)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
A friend it would seem.

Kayn did not think we could handle this? He might have been right this time.

==Notes==
Follow the path leading south from [[Illidari Stand]]. When you reach a large, ruined building in front of you, turn left and follow it until you reach Kor'vas.

;Quest accept
:{{text|say|[[Kayn Sunfury]]|I will see to it that the Legion gets no farther.}}
:{{text|say|Kayn Sunfury|[[Adventurer|You]], Kor'vas, and Cyana attack the Legion from within. Then, we will wipe them out together.}}

;Approach Kor'vas
:{{text|say|Kor'vas Bloodthorn|You are no demon.  Friend or foe?}}

;Quest complete
:{{text|say|Kor'vas Bloodthorn|We will work together to destroy the Legion from within.}}

After you complete this quest, no follow-up quests will be offered immediately. Kill a few demons, and Kor'vas will offer the next two quests.

When meeting other players on the follow-up quests, their Kor'vas is shown under the [[generic name]] "Demon Hunter" with an altered appearance.
