==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kira Iresoul]] in [[Azsuna]].

==Description==
Channeling the demonic gateway will require the assistance of someone with intimate knowledge of the [[Burning Legion]]. 

I know of such a warlock, though I imagine her blood still boils upon hearing my name. It might be best if you are the one to request her help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|66}}
* 1,550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Ritssyn Flamescowl|Ritssyn]] sent you, did he? I see my old mentor still refuses to do his own dirty work.

But of course, someone in his position can't be seen consorting with a purported member of the [[Argus Wake]]? What would the others think?

As much as I relish the idea of Ritssyn needing my help, I don't barter in kindness and favors, <name>.

My currency is power and knowledge. If you have either, then it's possible we can come to an arrangement.

==Notes==
Kira Iresoul can be found in the [[Greenway]], southwest of [[Felblaze Ingress]].
