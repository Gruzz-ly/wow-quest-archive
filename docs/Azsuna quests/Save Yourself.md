:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|I believe you know the rest of the story, <name>}}

==Notes==
On accept, the scene fades to the entrance to the Ruins of Nar'thalas, with the player in control of Farondis.
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|Guilt overcame me. I could not simply WAIT while you fought my battles.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|I resolved to follow you into the academy.}}

Upon approaching the academy, Athissa and Parjesh appear, dragging the player character down the academy steps.
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|I'd only reached the academy entrance when I saw those two naga, with you in tow.}}
:{{text|say|Athissa|Make sure that prisoner doesn't awaken, Parjesh.}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Parjesh|Yes, my mistress.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|I followed them as closely as I dared.}}

Pursue the naga.
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|I saw my chance. I would attack the naga leaders and save you from captivity.}}
:{{text|yell|Athissa|Be gone spirit! the Tidestone belongs to us now!}} 
:{{text|say|Warlord Parjesh|You deal with our guest, Athissa. I shall take the prisoner to the slave pens.}}

Parjesh drags the player character off while Farondis and Athissa battle. Eventually, Athissa withdraws.

:{{text|yell|Athissa|Curse you and your kind, elf. The queen herself will hear of this!}}
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|Athissa and the Tidestone had evaded me. Rather than pursuing her, I set off to rescue you, my champion.}} 
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|I had finally found their slave pen.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|At the entrance to the cave, however, I ran into an old acquaintance.}}

At the entrance to the cave, a large naga-shaped shadow appears.
:{{text|say|Vision of Queen Azshara|Farondis! My most loyal subject. It's been too long.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|That voice...}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Queen Azshara|I'm sorry, you must not recognize me.}}
:''The vision transforms into Azshara's elven form.''
:{{text|say|Queen Azshara|Is this better?}}
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|Queen Azshara... you... YOU lead the naga?}}
:{{text|say|Queen Azshara|Poor, deluded Farondis. Don't you remember? I quashed your rebellion ten thousand years ago. Do you remember how powerless you were to stop me?}} 
:''Azshara approaches Farondis.''
:{{text|say|Queen Azshara|And look at you now! A spectre of your former self, cursed to an eternity of undeath and ineptitude.}} 
:{{text|say|Queen Azshara|I'm giving you an opportunity to kneel before me, princeling. Maybe something can be done about that little curse...}}
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|To release my people's curse... to redeem myself and secure my legacy...}} 
:''Farondis steps away from Azshara.''
:{{text|say|Price Farondis|The people of Azsuna were-- and always will be-- too proud to kneel before your demonic allies, witch.}}
:''Farondis blasts Azshara with a fireball.''
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|And we will NEVER...}} 
:''Farondis blasts Azshara again.''
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|KNEEL...}}
:''Farondis drops a meteor swarm on Azshara.''
:{{text|say|Prince Farondis|BEFORE YOU!!!}}
:''Azshara laughs.''
:{{text|say|Queen Azshara|Ha ha ha haaa... my wrath is coming.}}
:''Azshara vanishes.''

{{dialogue|title=Golk the Rumble|You burned those naga real good, little ghost. Burned 'em right up.}}
