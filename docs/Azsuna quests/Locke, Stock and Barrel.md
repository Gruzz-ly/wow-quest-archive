==Objectives==
Return to [[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart]] in [[Dalaran]] and inform him of Flintlocke's work.

==Description==
Well that jes' about wraps up me work 'ere. I'll start packin up an'ead back ta Dalaran.

If yeh wouldn't mind, could yeh tell Hobart 'ow things went down 'ere? Maybe leave out tha bits with tha explodin', tha drownin', an' tha gettin captured an' what not.

Yer a proper friend, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Schematics: Better Headguns]]

==Completion==
So the gunshoes and pack were a success? I guess all these guns I made weren't such a waste after all.

Which reminds me, I saw the plans for those goggles Flintlocke made and I've got to say, they were rather crude in their design. "Dwarven Engineering" is a bit of an oxymoron.

I've updated the schematic to not require so many materials.
