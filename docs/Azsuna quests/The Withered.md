==Objectives==
Slay 12 withered in the [[Azurewing Whelplands]].
*Withered slain (12)

==Description==
The withered are the worst kind of pest. They capture our whelplings, knock them unconscious, and then drink whatever mana they can from the helpless babes.

Normally our drakes and keepers would fend them off. Today, it looks like we may need your help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}} (at level 110)
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Twelve withered slain? Very good.

That should be enough to keep them away for a few months.

==Notes==
Killing any [[Withered Exile]] and [[Withered Mana-Rager]] will count towards this quest.

Make sure to get [[The Consumed]] from Senegos before starting out.

Go out across the bridge and up the road to the northeast, and take out the Withered so you can get to the whelplings.  You will most likely notice [[Stellagosa]], who offers the quest [[Runas the Shamed (quest)]].

At this point you have two choices:

1. Accept her quest and continue on to get all three objectives done, then return to base to turn it.

2. In the interests of seeing story progression, '''ignore her quest''', complete the first two quests and go back to turn them in.  At this point, Senegos will offer [[Stellagosa (quest)]], leading you back to her to take her quest.

==Progression==
