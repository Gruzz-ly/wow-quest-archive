==Objectives==
Free 6 Demon Hunters from [[Soul Harvester (Azsuna)|Soul Harvesters]].
* [[Demon Hunter (NPC)|Demon Hunters]] freed (6)

==Description==
My force wiped out the [[demon]]s' forward base here. But, an [[imp mother]] and her brood took the rest of my demon hunters hostage, including [[Cyana Nightglaive]].

We need to free the [[Illidari]] and destroy the [[Burning Legion]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
If we're to defeat the Legion, we need to know exactly what they're up to.

==Completion==
I've always had my doubts about Cyana. Something was never quite right there. Looks like she cracked and joined the Legion.

Still, we are not going to let her, or this [[Cordana Felsong]], get away with it.
