==Objectives==
Place 4 Sabotaged Portal Crystals.
*Sabotaged Portal Stabilizers placed (4)

==Description==
These [[demon]] portals are terrible and sloppy. No skill or finesse in it.

This physically hurts me and I haven't felt real pain in decades.

I "fixed" some of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s precious Portal Stabilizer crystals.

I want you to take them and "modify" their main portal in the Ingress and watch the "hilarity" ensue.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
If you think the explosion was big on our side of the portal, you should see what the other side looks like. Ha!

==Progression==
# [[Felblaze Ingress (quest)]]
# [[Eye See You]]
# [[They're Doing it Wrong]] & [[Arkethrax (quest)]] & [[Quantity Over Quality]]
