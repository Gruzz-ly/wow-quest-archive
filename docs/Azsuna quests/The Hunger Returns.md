==Description==
<Runas looks antsy.>

I can help you, and I very much want to, but I'm a bit distracted. Look at all that raw, unfiltered, mouthwatering mana...

<Runas slaps his own face.>

No! NO! You must stay in control!

I simply need to clear my head. Yes, that's it. A few of my depraved brethren carry small mana jewels around with them in case they need a quick burst of energy. Find a few for me? Then I will show you how to get your ley line back.
