==Objectives==
Collect 6 Arcane-Infused Eggs.
*[[Arcane-Infused Egg]] (6)

==Description==
As you must know, I'm a connoisseur of drinks... specifically, arcane-infused spirits.  Cocktail mixing is [[alchemy]], and as everyone knows, alchemy is [[magic]].

My latest drink must be more exotic than anything I've conjured before.  I already have most of what I need. But there are a couple of items left on the list.

Notice the [[Shallows Heron|herons]] down in the lagoon?  As with many of the creatures on [[Azsuna]], the magic coursing through the island permeates them.  Their eggs will do nicely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]
*[[Recipe: Faronaar Fizz]]

==Progress==
Are we speaking again because you have my eggs?

==Completion==
Capital!  A prodigious start.

I implore you to create this marvelous mixture for yourself.  I want to share the delight of alchemical spirits with the world!

You'll need to get more eggs for yourself, though.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
