==Objectives==
Recover [[Kira Iresoul|Kira]]'s Bloodstone from [[Narashi Spitescale]].
* [[Bloodstone (quest item)]]

==Description==
Something of personal value has been taken from me, and my work here cannot continue until I get it back.

To most it would appear to be an ordinary stone, but it is so much more than a simple rock - it lives and breathes!

The nearby [[naga]] have been snatching anything with any sort of magical significance, my stone included. Fortunately, they do not know how to access its power.

Return my stone to me, and I will consider your request for help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|60}}
* 15,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered my Bloodstone yet?

==Completion==
Your're quite resourceful. I can see why [[Ritssyn Flamescowl|Ritssyn]] likes to send you on errands.

==Notes==
The quest mob is located in the southeastern area of [[Hatecoil Warcamp]].

==Progression==
