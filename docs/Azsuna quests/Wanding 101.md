==Objectives==
Practice using your wand on 10 Wand Targets.
* [[Wand Target]] (10)

==Description==
We'll start with some wand work. You have your wand with you? Good.

I've set up a number of targets around the hall. Use your wand to hit as many as you can.

And no point-blank shots! That's cheating.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
And... it looks like we're out of time for today's wand practice. Go on, then. Off to your next class!

==Notes==
*Despite the quest text stating that point-blank shots aren't allowed, there is in fact no penalty whatsoever for a point-blank shot. It will still count towards your total.

When shooting a target up close:
:{{text|yell|Instructor Nidriel|I said no point blank shots!}}

Hitting a student:
*{{text|say|Drowned Student|Hey!}}
*{{text|say|Drowned Student|I'm trying to study over here.}}
*{{text|say|Drowned Student|Ow!}}
*{{text|say|Drowned Student|Mrs. Azuremoon! <name> is wanding me!}}
*{{text|say|Drowned Student|Quit it!}}
*{{text|say|Drowned Student|Watch where you're anding!}}
*{{text|say|Drowned Student|You. Me. By the flagpole. After class.}}
*{{text|say|Drowned Student|You're gonna get in trouble if you keep doing that.}}

Hitting [[Instructor Nidriel]]:
*{{text|say|Instructor Nidriel|Don't forget to aim before you fire.}}
*{{text|say|Instructor Nidriel|Keep this up and I'll have to give you extra homework.}}
*{{text|say|Instructor Nidriel|That's it. I'm giving you a zero for the day.}}
*{{text|say|Instructor Nidriel|That's minus fifty points for shooting the teacher.}}

Hitting [[Sythorne]]:
*{{text|say|Sythorne|No horseplay in the study hall!}}
*{{text|say|Sythorne|Good gracious, mind your wand fire.}}
*{{text|say|Sythorne|We're not here to have fun, underclassman. We're here to learn.}}
