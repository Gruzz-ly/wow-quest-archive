==Objectives==
Recover the Lens of the Tide{{Sic}} from Lady Hatecoil within the [[Eye of Azshara (instance)|Eye of Azshara]] dungeon.
* [[Lens of the Tides]]
* [[Wrath of Azshara]] slain

==Description==
We have what we need to create [[Velen]]'s elixir, but in order for others to be able to witness his vision, we'll need to find something that can be used to project images from the mind.

A lens from the nearby [[naga]] should work well, but I don't think they're going to be too eager to give it up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
* 19,350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Gazing through the lens of a powerful naga will allow you to witness my vision. 

==Completion==
You've returned, and just in time it would seem.

[[Yalia Sagewhisper|Yalia]] and [[Zabra Hexx|Zabra]] have just finished crafting the elixir. This lens will allow you to see what I see when the vision begins. 

==Progression==
{{Priest artifact and class hall}}

==Patch changes==
