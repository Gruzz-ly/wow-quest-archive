Kill Nightglaive the Traitor.
* [[Nightglaive the Traitor]] slain
* Ride back to [[Illidari Stand]] (Optional)
*Meet back at Illidari Stand

==Description==
I'm not going to let this [[Cordana Felsong]] get away with this. There is no way in hell I am going to let that warden witch turn my people.

As for [[Cyana Nightglaive|Nightglaive]]... I will NOT suffer a traitor to live!

Are you with me, <name>?

==Progress==
The traitor must be killed.  It is the only way.

==Completion==
Grim news indeed. We cannot afford the loss of even one demon hunter, but you and Kor'vas were right to put an end to Nightglaive.

More importantly, you have made a good friend in Stellagosa. The remnant of the [[Blue Dragonflight]] could prove to be a powerful ally.
