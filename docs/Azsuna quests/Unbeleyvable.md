==Objectives==
Assist [[Arcanist Valtrois]] with placing ley line taps.
*[[Ley Line Tap]] placed
*Follow Valtrois

==Description==
Back to the task at hand!

Take these ley line taps. We can use the resonant energies to properly redirect the flow, but they must be placed in precise locations. I will show you where.

Your friend has agreed to... "supervise" us. Let us hope she just stays out of the way while the professionals take care of this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
This ley line energy will not move itself. We must give it encouragement.

==Completion==
That was more infuriating than it should have been. At least her natural talents mostly matched my calculations...

==Notes==
Click on each ley line tap to proceed once Valtrois and Stellagosa agree on its location.

First ley line tap:
: ''Valtrois walks further down to the central cluster of crystals, Stellagosa trailing behind.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|By placing the taps on key points of the ley line, I can direct its flow.}}
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|If you are going to poke at a ley line, at least make sure it's the right spot. Try a little bit to the right.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|I am not "poking" it, I am tapping-- Hmph. I suppose it ''could'' work there...}}

Second ley line tap:
: ''The pair walk downward to the left.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Anyway, moving along!}}
: ''They stop by a broken table.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|The next tap should go here.}}
: ''Valtrois places the tap in front of herself.''
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Are you sure about that placement? It would be better here.}}
: ''Stella places the tap in front of herself, about two paces to the left.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|I have spent millennia studying ley lines. I am certainly capable of finding one right beneath my feet!}}
: ''Indignant, Valtrois moves it back.''
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|But I can see the line and the focus of the conduit. You want to put it there.}}
: ''Insistent, Stella moves it again.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Fine! We can do it your way. But if this entire cave ends up ''exploding'' with arcane energy, it will be on your head.}}

Third ley line tap:
: ''The pair walk upward to the north.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|This final tap will allow me to steer the flow of energy, like the rudder of a ship. Right around here should do the trick.}}
: ''Valtrois places the tap. Stella sounds honestly impressed.''
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|You can do that? Perhaps you know a thing or two after all.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|My goodness. Was that a compliment?}}
