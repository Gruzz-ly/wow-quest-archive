==Description==
Your quest for the [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]]... it intrigues me. More than that, it suits my needs quite well. I have been in need of a champion for a very, very long time.

It is decided, then. I shall join you.

We will have to head east, through Nar'thalas.

Shall we depart?

You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Perhaps this was a mistake.
