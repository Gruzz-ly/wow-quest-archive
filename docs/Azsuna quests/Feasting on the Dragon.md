==Objectives==
Slay 15 withered in [[Azurewing Repose]].
*Withered slain at Azurewing Repose (15)

==Description==
You killed their [[Ael'Yith|leader]], so they came here? Understandable. These creatures crave only one thing - magic - and they can sniff it out from leagues away.

Without a leader, they will soon wither and die. Our only recourse in the meantime is to put as many as possible down before they take these dragons with them!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Leywalker Robe
|Ruin-Stalker Vest
|Seaspray Vest
|Nar'thalas Chestplate
|Leywalker Handwraps
|Ruin-Stalker Grips
|Seaspray Grips
|Nar'thalas Grips
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
That will have to do for now.

==Notes==
Killing any of the [[Withered Outcast]] and [[Withered Skulker]] in the area will count towards this quest.

==Progression==
{{Defending Azurewing Repose}}
