==Description==
I'm bein' honest here matey, I've got me own motives fer bein' here. Last time there was a bit of a debacle. Some drinkin', some gamblin', and a bit too much rum if ye catch me meanin'. Some words were said, some fists were thrown and... honestly it was quite a haze. I'm not the most welcome pirate here after that.

But they took me stuff! These lyin', dirty ol'... ahem. Could ye just take this torch and... burn their belongin's? I'd be grateful.
