==Objectives==
Repel the [[Burning Legion]] forces throughout [[Azsuna]].
* Assault slain
* Legion Points repelled (4)
* Meet [[Prince Farondis]] at [[Shackle's Den]]

==Description==
The demons strike at the heart of our existence, posing a threat to all who inhabit our lands.

Remove the threat before it is too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I'm afraid our fight has only brought us so far. We must press our attack before the Legion advances beyond their stronghold within the [[Temple of a Thousand Lights]]!

==Notes==
If this is your first [[Legion Assaults]], pick up [[Defending Broken Isles]] from [[Maiev Shadowsong]] at [[Deliverance Point]] in [[Broken Shore]]. It will reward you 1500 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]].
