==Objectives==
* {{item|Manastalker Tendril|s}} collected (50)
* {{item|Felsurge Spider Egg|s}} collected (10)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Nightwatcher Idri]]|We can brew a powerful draught of demon detection with the right pile of entrails. Collect them for me, and together we will retake [[Faronaar]]!}}

== Rewards ==
* +75 reputation with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Nightwatcher Idri|You certainly don't shy away from the dirty work. Well done.}}

== Notes ==
Try to target the very few [[Felsurge Broodmother]]s that are walking around, as the only ones that drop eggs and several at once. [[Broodmother Lizax]] also counts. Otherwise find eggs hopefully in twos and threes on the ground.
