==Objectives==
Get the Fighter Chow from [[Ooka Dooker]]
*[[Fighter Chow]] acquired

==Description==
Things may look good from where you're standing, but, we're losing. However, do not fret, my little <race> friend. You can help. Listen closely. Ooka Dooker, [[Ooker Dooker|Ooker]]'s sister, is back over yonder in the champions' cave making her world famous Fighter Chow. It'll do the trick and boost our team's morale. All you have to do is to convince her to hand it over.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,480 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]
*[[Recipe: Fighter Chow]]

==Completion==
Yes, this'll do nicely... oh no! The last of my pit fighters have been defeated.

It's just you and me now, little <race>.

==Notes==
Talk to Ooka Dooker:
{{Dialogue|Yeah? What? This fighter chow is a special family secret.

There's no ookin way you're getting any, <race>.

*{{Gossip|You'll hand over the fighter chow now if you know what's good for you.}}
*{{Gossip|Ooka, may I please have some of your delicious Fighter Chow? I hear it's the best.}}}}

Choosing the nicer second option will immediately reward the Fighter Chow:
:{{Text|say|Ooka Dooker|You've out-hozened me, wicket-lover. Here, take the chow. You earned it.}}
The chow is displayed as a buff:
:{{Abilities|Fighter Chow|id=178475|Out of combat health regeneration increased by 400%. {{Text|#00AA99|"For superior fighting and a healthier coat."}}|icon=inv_misc_food_meat_cooked_03}}

Choosing the first option will start a long dialogue of back-and-forth insults. The nice option appears again at each stage of this dialogue, allowing the player to end the dialogue and receive the Fighter Chow at any time. The following is the full dialogue if the player chooses the insulting option every time.

{{Dialogue|What did you ookin say?!

{{Gossip|I said, when I beat your brother black and blue, he dooked his pants and jumped away. Now give me the chow!}}

Flip blookin dook-sniffer. You better take that back!

{{Gossip|Hey, Ooka, your ooker is showing. That's unsavory and not the least bit sanitary.}}

Ookin Dookin blookin flookin wikket!

{{Gossip|Your mom.}}

My mom? MY MOM! You wikket licking ooker!

{{Gossip|Ookin' wikket! Walk away, just like your brother.}}

You leave my brother out of this you, blickjikity dook-manker!

{{Gossip|You know what, Ooka? You have a dook for a head!}}

My head? You're a slicky headed dook-manker!

{{Gossip|Slicky slapper! That's right, I said it. Slicky slapper.}}

Go mank a slicky, wicket. In fact, go mank two while one manks you from behind and the other manks your dooker.

{{Gossip|You've got quite the mouth on you, Ooka. Maybe I should stuff it full of your blookin mank chow.}}

Jeek on it. Jeek on this. You take that back, dooker <race>!

{{Gossip|You can mank my dook, Ooka. I'm taking the chow and there's nothing you can ookin do about it, wicket licker.

Mank you, <man/lady>. MANK YOU.

{{Gossip|Blikkety slickety ook. This mank jeeked on my dook. Face! Now hand over the Fighter Chow!}}
}}}}

The end result is the same as above, with Ooka finally handing over the chow:
:{{Text|say|Ooka Dooker|You've out-hozened me, wicket-lover. Here, take the chow. You earned it.}}
