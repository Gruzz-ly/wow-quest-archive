==Objectives==
Obtain 3 pieces of Runic Catgut.
* [[Runic Catgut]] (3)

==Description==
Let me guess... thread troubles? Mm-hm.
I suspected as much. [[Nightborne|My people]] weave sumptuous silks, but those silks can be fickle about the types of thread they'll accept.

[[Shal'dorei Silk|Shal'dorei silk]] has a bit of [[ley line|ley energy]] woven right into it. You need something that's learned to coexist with the ley energies of [[Azsuna|this land]].

I'm talking about [[owlcat]]s, my good friend! They have what you need. You'll find them amongst the ruins of [[Llothien]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
They are quite remarkable creatures, really. I used to keep one as a pet and mount... but that was a lifetime ago.

==Completion==
Perfect. Marvelous!

==Notes==
;On accept of both
:{{Text|say|Lyndras|While the Nightfallen look much like I do, they are craven, twisted ley-addicts who will stab you in the back to get a taste of your mana. I am a friendly tailor who has simply fallen on hard times. Note the difference!}}
