==Objectives==
Fulfill your part of the deal with [[Daglop]].
* [[Fistful of Feathers (Azsuna)]] (20)
* [[Shadowhorn]] (3)
* {{item|Wild Olive|Wild Olives}} collected (8)

==Description==
Per your contract you will help me gather supplies for a perfectly harmless ritual.

I need feathers, and horns. Lots of horns. See those [[Veil Shadowrunner|shadowrunners]], [[Veil Prowler|prowlers]] and [[Redcrested Heron|heron]] over there in the [[Olivian Veil]]? They should have lots of both.

Oh! And I need olives. Lots of olives. One for each finger.

Minion! Let's ride!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This land is ripe for the taking. Especially the olives. They are really ripe. And I love ripe olives.

==Completion==
Mmmm. Olives. I love these things. They are the only reason worth to come{{sic}} to this filthy world.

==Notes==
On accept, Daglop will jump on your shoulders.  Should you mount, he will jump off and despawn until you're on foot once more.  Olives are from [[Olive Sprig]]s scattered about on the ground.
