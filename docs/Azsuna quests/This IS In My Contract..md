==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Sharazaan.jpg|Sharazaan|[[Tehd Shoemaker|Tehd]]'s Master-Before-Last}}
Help [[Daglop]] complete his ritual.
*Speak with Daglop to start the ritual
*[[Sharazaan]] slain

==Description==
To perform my ritual I need to use a special cave I have prepared at [[Gloombound Barrow]].

Meet me there and I will "give" you your reward. Hee hee.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*[[Copy of Daglop's Contract]]
*[[Daglop's Precious]]

==Completion==
Great deal right? You got to kill a [[demon]], your fancy weapon got more fancy, and I get to be the master now. Everybody wins!

==Notes==
''Accept:''
: ''Daglop jumps down and runs off.''
: {{text|say|Meet me at the ritual site for your reward.}}

The cave is down at the shore.  Daglop is standing outside the entrance.
{{Dialogue|
Minion!  Glad you could make it.  The time has come to make my old master pay for violating my contract.  You ready to face him?

{{gossip|Begin your ritual.}}
