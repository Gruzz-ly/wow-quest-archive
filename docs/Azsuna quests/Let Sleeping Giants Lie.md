==Objectives==
Collect the [[Giants' Stash of Weapons]].
* [[Giants' Stash of Weapons]]

==Description==
We're going to need a diversion to get close to [[Prince Oceanus]]. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? See [[Sleepy Dhow]] over there? He's guarding all of the weapons the giants take from our shipwrecks. We can use those weapons to arm the rest of the pit fighters that are held in the caves. All you have to do is get past that giant without waking him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
As soon as I can, I'll arm the [[gladiator]]s in [[Oceanus Cove]].

==Completion==
I couldn't have snuck past him better. Now, to get these weapons into the right hands.
