==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ritssyn Flamescowl]].

==Description==
I have a few urgent matters to take care of, but soon after I will make my way to [[Dreadscar Rift]] and aid you with your summoning.

You should warn Ritssyn to keep his distance. I'll be there to repay my debt to you, not to speak to the hypocrite who chose the council over his friends.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|66}}
* 1,550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It appears [[Kira Iresoul|Kira]] travels faster than your word. She arrived moments ago, though her eyes purposely avoided mine.

In gaining her trust, you accomplished something I could not. With her help, we should be able to summon the gateway.

==Progression==
{{warlock artifact and class hall}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
