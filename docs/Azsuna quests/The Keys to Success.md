==Objectives==
Bring the mold to [[Alard Schmied]] in [[Dalaran]] and have him help you forge a new set of keys. Return to [[Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher|Tae'thelan]] when you have the finished set.
* Bring the mold to Alard Schmied
** ([[Metal Bar]])
* Melt the metal at Alard's Forge
** ([[Molten Slag (quest item)]])
* Fill the mold on Alard's Workbench
** ([[Filled Mold]])
* Cool the mold in Alard's Quenching Trough
** ([[Newly Forged Key]])

==Description==
I'd like you to take the mold to the blacksmith in Dalaran. Alard, I believe his name is.

Have him help you forge a new set of keys.

I found some writing on the back of the mold that may hold the answer to what these keys unlock. I'll stay here and try to translate the text.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Key to Nar'thalas Academy]]

==Progress==
The key is clearly tied to something here in [[Azsuna]].

==Completion==
This is not a true key, but rather a device to provide access to the [[Nar'thalas Academy]].

The academy was once a great location of knowledge for [[Night elf|night elves]] to learn the [[arcane]] magics, but has [[War of the Ancients|long since]] long{{sic}} been destroyed.

The key is useless junk. You can keep it.

==Notes==
Alard will have you perform the work yourself in order to make the new keys. Each step uses a special action button rather than needing to right-click an item or object.

''{{gossip|Alard, could you help me cast a new set of keys?}}''
:{{text|say|Alard Schmied|Sure can! Take this metal and melt it by the forge. Then pour it into the mold. When that's done, you can cool it over by the quenching trough.}}

After melting the [[Metal Bar]] at the forge, walk over to the low-lying brown table next to [[Arcanomancer Vridiel]] and pour the [[Molten Slag (quest item)]]. Go to the water trough next to cool the [[Filled Mold]] and create the [[Newly Forged Key]].
