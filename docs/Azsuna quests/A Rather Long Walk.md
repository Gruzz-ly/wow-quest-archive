==Objectives==
Find [[Elder Aldryth]]. 
* Elder Aldryth found 

==Description==
I'm concerned for Elder Aldryth.  He went out for a walk about ten thousand years ago, and he has not returned.

With these naga attacking, I fear he may be in danger!

If you dare venture out into the fray, do look out for our court elder.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
Have you seen him?

==Completion==
I can't tell you how relieved I am that Elder Aldryth has returned.

Honestly, life here in the palace hasn't been the same without him.  Everything seemed to have... lost its color.  Perhaps now we can get back to our normal lives.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
: {{text|say|[[Magister Garuhod]]|"Going for a walk."  Hah!  He's probably out visiting that little common girl he fancies so much.}}

Aldryth is down in the lake, trapped under a pillar.  Watch out for the sea skrog that patrols nearby.

: ''Aldryth comes free with a pop and he swims to the surface.''
: {{text|say|Elder Aldryth|Thank you, stranger.}}
: {{text|say|Elder Aldryth|I don't know what happened.  I heard a loud crashing noise, and then I found myself stuck beneath this beam.  Since then, I've just been waiting.}}
: ''Aldryth swims off toward the [[Crumbled Palace]] before despawning.''
: {{text|say|Elder Aldryth|Now, where did that lovely girl run off to?}}

On returning to the palace, Aldryth is standing beside [[Veridis Fallon]].

''Complete:''
: {{text|say|Lady Irisse|Aldryth.  You weren't out consorting with that servant girl, were you?}}
: {{text|say|Elder Aldryth|What?  No, of course not!}}
: {{text|say|Elder Aldryth|...}}
: {{text|say|Elder Aldryth|I was visiting a different girl.}}
