==Objectives==
Trace an arcane rune, a fire rune, and a frost rune.
* Arcane Rune drawn
* Fire Rune drawn
* Frost Rune drawn

==Description==
Still aching to get into the headmistress' study, eh? I suppose I can let you in... as long as you prove that you've been studying.

Proper [[Rune magic|rune]] formation is essential when it comes to spellcasting. If you can draw a rune, you can cast a spell.

I will provide outlines for you. You can simply use your feet to trace the runes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|80|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
Go on, then! Get those feet moving!

==Completion==
Exemplary work, young <name>. With runes like these, you'll be graduating in no time.

==Progression==
