==Objectives==
Slay Leyworms to obtain 6 Crackling Leyworm Cores, then drop them into [[Senegos]]'s pool.
*[[Crackling Leyworm Core]] (6)
*Throw crystals into Senegos's pool

==Description==
I will do what I can to stabilize him, but I will need your help.

The small amount of energy he has left is coming from the mana pool he rests in.

Follow the whelplings' lead. Dropping ley crystals into the pool gives him a bit of energy - buying him a few more breaths.

They seem to be getting the crystals from inside that cave to the north.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}} (at level 110)
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Farondis]]

==Progress==
Call me a fool. I'd always just thought that grandfather would be with us forever.

==Completion==
Thank you. Your efforts dull his pain.

<She sighs.>

==Notes==
Do not go into the cave that is north of Senegos (the one with a mailbox near its entrance). Instead, follow the path leading to the left that takes you into [[Leyhollow]], where there are [[Burrowing Leyworm]]s.
