==Objectives==
Sign [[Daglop]]'s contract.
*Daglop's Contract Signed

==Description==
Hey there!

You seem like a gullib- er... um... "intelligent" type.

I propose a deal.

I need a minion to be my muscle to help me acquire a few special... "ingredients" for a ritual.

In exchange, I'll give you [[Sharazaan|my former master]] to do with whatever you demon-slaying [[adventurer|types]] do with [[demon]]s.

If you are interested, just sign here. In blood, please.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*11,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yeah!  Yeah!  You read the contract?  I made it myself.  Really good binding clauses in there.

==Completion==
At last! A minion of my very own!

==Notes==
You can read the contract, flipping to the next page or the previous page, or sign it outright at anytime.

: The contract starts with a large, flowing, vile looking script that, with each sentence gets smaller and smaller in its lettering.  It begins:

: The lettering becomes so small at this point the words are effectively unreadable by mortal eyes.
