==Completion==
<The advisor looks down at what you're offering her and then looks around nervously, straining to give you a rictus grin. She continues in hushed tones.>

Do you know what you have here? You have kept the Alliance from getting their grubby little hands on some rather delicate information.

I will see to it personally that this is safely filed away.
