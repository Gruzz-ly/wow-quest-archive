==Objectives==
Use Tehd's [[Eye of Kilrogg (Azsuna)|Eye of Kilrogg]] to investigate [[Felblaze Ingress]].
* Eye of Kilrogg
* Main Portal scouted
* Ritual site found
* Commander found

==Description==
There is being blind, and then there is being stupid.

This eyeless wonder next to me wants to barrel into [[Felblaze Ingress]] without preparation.

Bah! I say we scout it first.

Here, I will provide you with an extra eye I picked up from a place better left unmentioned.

Enter Felblaze Ingress, investigate the area, and try not to get poked in the eye.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}

==Progress==
Don't ask where I got the eye. Worst case is I tell you and then it gets all awkward between us.

==Completion==
Why? Why would [[demon]]s, of all things, be this bad at summoning their own kind?

==Gains==
* 14,800 [[XP]]
