*[[Legion Jailer]] Slain

:{{text|say|[[Nightwatcher Idri]]|The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] has captured a clutch of [[Stellagosa]]'s azure [[whelpling]]s! Save them, so our ally's brood may grow stronger!}}

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Nightwatcher Idri|Those whelps were so small, so helpless. How despicable of the Legion to prey upon the weak!}}

==Notes==
Unlock the Legion Cages to free a whelpling. You will most likely have to kill [[Manastalker]]s and [[Legion Willbreaker]]s to get to the cages. If you can't find a Jailer patrolling about, try one of the side caves.
