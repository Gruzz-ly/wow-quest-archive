==Objectives==
Obtain a Stained Silken Robe and a set of Hatecoil Wristwraps.
* [[Stained Silken Robe]]
* [[Hatecoil Wristwraps]]

==Description==
When I worked at the tailoring guild in [[Suramar]], I would usually work off of a pattern. Something that inspired me.

Unfortunately, I've run into streak of bad luck, and I'm ashamed to say that I no longer have my patterns.

The [[naga]] [[sorceress]]es in the lagoon to the west, however, have expertly-sewn wristwraps. And the [[nightfallen]] to the north wear robes that we can use... if you can pry one from their greedy clutches.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What've you got in your hands, there?

==Completion==
You, <name>, are a person of great skill. I send you out for patterns, and you do so without question. Remarkable!

==Notes==
;On accept of both
:{{Text|say|Lyndras|While the Nightfallen look much like I do, they are craven, twisted ley-addicts who will stab you in the back to get a taste of your mana. I am a friendly tailor who has simply fallen on hard times. Note the difference!}}
