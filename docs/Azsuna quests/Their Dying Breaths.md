==Objectives==
Obtain 4 Cracked Ley Crystals, then use them to resuscitate the Mana-Drained Whelplings.
* [[Cracked Ley Crystal]] (4)
* [[Grievously Wounded Whelpling]]

==Description==
I have precious little time. As we speak, my troops are defending against an onslaught of withered elves.

These four whelplings are near death. Their lives are of the utmost importance to our [[Blue Dragonflight|flight]], as they may be some of the last whelplings [[Senegos]] can rear.

Some cracked ley crystals should bring them back to their senses.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Tranquil Azurewing Band
|Leywalker Gloves
|Ruin-Stalker Gloves
|Seaspray Gauntlets
|Nar'thalas Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive: {{cost|||}} ({{cost|9|70|}} at level 110)
* 7,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Oh no...

==Completion==
Of course they would attack now.

Those withered devils couldn't have chosen a more effective time to strike. My brood already suffers.

==Notes==
Go into the cave directly behind Agapanthus, where there is a plentiful supply of Cracked Ley Crystals. Collecting them will [[aggro]] a nearby [[Flashwyrm]], but they are trivial. Head back to where the dying whelplings are and right-click each one to revive them.

:''It appears the revival has failed.''
:{{text|say|Agapanthus|Ahh... I feared we might lose that one. He was so weak when I found him. Pick him up and take him to Senegos.}}
:''The [[adventurer]] gently lifts the whelp.''
:{{text|say|Agapanthus|My keepers are overrun. We will require aid.}}
:''Agapanthus and his [[Azurewing Keeper|group]] head out.''

;Approach Senegos
:{{text|say|Senegos|Another Nightfallen attack? Bring my child to me, young one.}}

;Quest complete
:{{text|say|Senegos|[[Stellagosa]]. Do me one last favor. Your younger brothers and sisters need your help.}}
:{{text|say|Stellagosa|Of course.}}
: ''She walks clear of the others then turns back to Senegos.''
:{{text|say|Stellagosa|Farewell, grandfather.}}
:''Stellagosa turns away and leaps into the air, changing back into her natural form and flies away.''
:{{text|say|Senegos|See you soon, starlight.}}
