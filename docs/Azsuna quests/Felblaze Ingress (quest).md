==Objectives==
Meet [[Tehd Shoemaker]] at [[Felblaze Ingress]].

==Description==
It is my mission to cover the rear guard of [[Illidari Stand]]. I have employed this [[warlock]]... thing, to assist me.

However, the two of us are insufficient for a task that needs doing.

To the east is a mass of [[demon]]s at Felblaze Ingress. These creatures have begun to open portals to summon in countless reinforcements.

Meet us at Felblaze Ingress and together we can crush this [[fel]] insurgency.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|94|}}

==Completion==
Keep your voice down unless you feel like being [[felbat]] food.
