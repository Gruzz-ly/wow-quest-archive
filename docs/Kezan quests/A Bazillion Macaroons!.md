== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Sassy Hardwrench}} at [[KTC Headquarters]] on [[Kezan (starting zone)|Kezan]].

== Description ==
You're an extremely ambitious young [[goblin]], <name>. Maybe a little too ambitious for your own good. I see a lot of myself in you when I was your age.

I have a proposition. You might have noticed that [[Mount Kajaro]] is exploding thanks to your dragon. Everyone on [[Kezan]] is going to die!

But, if you bring me a bazillion [[macaroon]]s before my yacht leaves the island, I'll make sure that you're one of the lucky few to escape.

If you want to live, you better hurry and figure out how to get me my moolah!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 30 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
A bazillion macaroons?!?! Where are we going to get that kind of moolah?

<Sassy thinks a moment.>

Um... did the {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix||Trade Prince}} say anything about letting me escape with you on his yacht?

== Notes ==
Sassy is now outside with the rest of the group. Completing this quest opens up three side quests in addition to the direct continuation. Pick them all up &mdash; they're interrelated.

;Ace
:Hey, <man/?>, are we gonna get through this okay?

;Gobber
:<Gobber acts tough, but you can tell that deep down, he's scared.>

;Izzy
:It looks like this is the end, but I'll be brave if you will, <name>.

;Candy
:Heya, hon. Um... we need to talk, but later.
:Okay?
