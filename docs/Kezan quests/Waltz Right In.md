== Objectives ==
Obtain Maldy's Falcon, The Goblin Lisa, and The Ultimate Bomb.
*[[Maldy's Falcon]]
*[[The Goblin Lisa]]
*[[The Ultimate Bomb]]

== Description ==
I heard about our money problem. There's only one way that we're going to get a bazillion macaroons: stealing from the rich!

That slime, the Trade Prince, has stolen all kinds of antiques and expensive art. It's time to take them from him and give them to the needy... mainly us!

Hobart left behind a cap he was working on. It's a disguise that'll make you look like one of his mooks. All you have to do is walk right in to [[Gallywix's Villa|his Villa]] to the west and 'procure' the items.

Just watch out for {{NPC||Keensnout Potbelly||his pigs}} who can smell through the disguise!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||75}}
*360 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
You got the goods, boss?

== Completion ==
Oh, wow! These are worth a fortune.

<Slinky eyes everything with a practiced, greed-filled eye.>

I just hope that the Trade Prince doesn't notice them when you hand them over with the rest of your wealth....

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Liberate the Kaja'mite]], [[Robbing Hoods]] and [[The Great Bank Heist]] before leaving KTC Headquarters. Getting close to Gallywix's Villa will activate [[Hobart's Ingenious Cap of Mook Foolery]]: "'''You look just like one of Trade Prince Gallywix's mooks. Slip past them to "procure" the priceless objects that you need, but beware the Keensnout Potbelly pigs!!!'''" The items are in each building in the villa.

*{{text|yell|We shall sail for distant [[Azshara]]. There, I will forge a new trade empire. One that will crush the [[Steamwheedle Cartel]]! And I shall carve my likeness upon that distant land's mountains. All will pay tribute to me!}}
