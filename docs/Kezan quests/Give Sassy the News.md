== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Sassy Hardwrench}} at [[KTC Headquarters]] on [[Kezan (starting zone)|Kezan]]

== Description ==
I'd celebrate with you, but it feels like that dragon really did a number on ol' [[Mount Kajaro]], <name>. I... uh... I think I'm gonna grab my stuff and get on the first ship leaving [[Kezan|the island]]!

Anyways, you should probably head back to headquarters and let Sassy know that you won the Footbomb title for us. I'm sure she'll also want to know about the dragon and Mount Kajaro.

Good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*25 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Completion ==
You're kidding, right?! {{NPC||Deathwing||DEATHWING}}?!!!

<Sassy looks panicked for a moment.>

Okay, this'll work out just fine. We'll throw your party and by the time it's over I'm sure that the dragon will be long gone and the ground will stop shaking.

If not, we can always charter a ship off of the island.

== Notes ==
Make sure the other quests, [[The New You]] and [[Do it Yourself]], are ready to turn in before heading back to KTC Headquarters. Back at headquarters, do the level three class quest before Candy or Chip continue the chain with [[Life of the Party]].

:{{text|say|Coach Crosscheck|You got the juice, kid. That's for sure! Too bad  that dragon had to come and ruin everything. No matter. You made us proud. Now get back to headquarters.}}

;Coach
:I got a very bad feeling about this, <name>. I think the smart play now is to get yourself off of the island any way that you can.
:I'm going see if I can get into the Trade Prince's Town-In-A-Box.
