== Objectives ==
Slay 6 Tunnel Worms.
*[[Tunneling Worm]] slain x6

== Description ==
We've got trouble in the [[Kaja'mine]] again, boss. The tunnel worms have returned and they're literally eating away at the [[Kajaro Trading Company]]'s profits!

[[Kaja'mite]] mining is down, which is negatively impacting our production of [[Kaja'Cola]]!

I tried calling the exterminator, but he's fled with the last payment we made to him.

Do you think you could had into the three mines and take care of it? I'd help but I still haven't attended the [[Bilgewater Cartel|cartel]]-mandated fighter training seminar.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Tunnel Worm Vest|KTC Executive Slippers|Tunnel Worm Chestguard}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|||55}}
*200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
I don't know, boss. I'm still getting reports of worms eating all of the Kaja'mite in the mines.

You should head back in there and take care of them.

== Completion ==
I say good riddance to those pests!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Good Help is Hard to Find]] before heading down into the Kaja'mine.
