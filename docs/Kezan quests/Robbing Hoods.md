== Objectives ==
Use your Hot Rod to run over 12 {{NPC||Hired Looter}}s, collecting 12 Stolen Loots in the process.
* [[Stolen Loot]] x12

== Description ==
We're all going to die!!!

<You slap Megs to calm her down.>

Sorry about that, <Mr./Mrs.> <name>. It won't happen again. Okay, we need to find a way to make a lot of moolah quickly.

There are already reports of the Trade Prince sending hired looters into the streets.

You could take the hot rod out there and run them down, snatching the loot that they've already illegally stolen. There wouldn't be anything wrong with that, right?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||75}}
*360 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Were you able to steal a whole bunch of stolen loot?

== Completion ==
Wow, you really did it?! Well, they had it coming, I guess.

That's an awful lot of loot. Do you think it's enough to get you a spot on the Trade Prince's yacht?

Are you going to be able to bring anyone with you? I don't make too much in marketing.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Liberate the Kaja'mite]], [[The Great Bank Heist]] and [[Waltz Right In]] before leaving KTC Headquarters.

Simply by running over the Hired Looters will players wind up with the Stolen Loot. Do this on the way [[The Great Bank Heist|to the bank]] and [[Waltz Right In|to the villa]].
