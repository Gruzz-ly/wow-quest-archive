== Objectives ==
Adjust the attitudes of 8 [[Defiant Troll]]s.
*Attitudes Adjusted (8)

== Description ==
I've failed! I tried the best I could to meet our [[>Kaja'Cola]] quotas, but you know troll slaves these days. Good help is hard to find!

I think your personal touch is called for. A shock from the battery on your [[Goblin All-In-1-Der Belt]] should do the trick. If a small number of the defiant trolls were to have their attitudes adjusted, the rest would quickly fall into line.

Kaja'Cola production must continue or the [[Trade Prince Gallywix|Trade Prince]] will have all of our heads!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||15}}
*80 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Progress ==
A good start, <sir/ma'am>, but might I suggest that you may want to make an example of a few more?

== Completion ==
I couldn't have done it better myself. In fact, I didn't.

You're an inspiration to us all, <name>. Why I'm sure that in no time at all we'll all be talking about the great and powerful, and may I add extremely wealthy, Trade <Prince/Princess> <name>!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Trouble in the Mines]] before heading down into the [[Kaja'mine]]. Simply right-click on the trolls once in range, where you'll be presented with four options to tell the trolls.

{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
This work be terrible. I'm not doin' it anymore!

*{{Gossip|Time is money! Get back to work!}}
*{{Gossip|The boss ain't happy with you. You better watch yourself.}}
*{{Gossip|Get back to it! Drinks on the house for whoever moves the most kaja'mite.}}
*{{Gossip|<Zap him with the Goblin All-In-1-Der Belt>}}
}}

To which the troll replies one of the following:
*{{text|say|Defiant Troll|Oops, break's over.}}
*{{text|say|Defiant Troll|Don't tase me, mon!}}
*{{text|say|Defiant Troll|I report you to HR!}}
*{{text|say|Defiant Troll|Work was bettah in da [[Undermine]]!}}
*{{text|say|Defiant Troll|I'm going. I'm going!}}
*{{text|say|Defiant Troll|Sorry, mon. It won't happen again.}}
*{{text|say|Defiant Troll|What I doin' wrong? Don't I get a lunch and two breaks a day, mon?}}
*{{text|say|Defiant Troll|Ouch! Dat hurt!}}
