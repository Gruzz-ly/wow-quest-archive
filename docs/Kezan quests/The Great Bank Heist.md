== Objectives ==
Crack your vault at the [[First Bank of Kezan]] to retrieve your Personal Riches.
*First Bank of Kezan Vault
*[[Personal Riches]]

== Description ==
All of your assets have been frozen and the First Bank of Kezan is out of business!

You need an awful lot of moolah, boss. I think you're going to have to go break your own money out of the bank! The different widgets in your [[Goblin All-In-1-Der Belt]] should be enough to crack the vault.

I just hope that you've been saving for a rainy day like I always told you to. You might have noticed... it's raining hot liquid magma!!!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|First Bank Knocker
|Tasseled Shoes
|Vault Cracker Gloves
|Vault Cracker Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*[[Bank Robber's Bag]]

== Progress ==
Did you get it? Did you crack the safe and get your personal riches out of the bank?

== Completion ==
Hey, you have been saving! I'm so proud of you!

<Sassy counts all of your macaroons.>

Um, boss... this isn't nearly enough.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Liberate the Kaja'mite]], [[Robbing Hoods]] and [[Waltz Right In]] before leaving KTC Headquarters.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Sassy Hardwrench|<Name>, you have to hurry and break your moolah out of the bank!}}

Head back to the bank, hopefully [[Robbing Hoods|running over a bunch of looters]] along the way, and right-click on any of the vaults. The vehicle UI appears with five actions:
# {{Abilities|Amazing G-Ray|icon=inv misc enggizmos 20|Ping the vault locking mechanism using the invasive and dangerous Amazing Grapplehammer-Ray device contained in your Goblin All-In-1-Der Belt.}}
# {{Abilities|Blastcrackers|icon=inv misc bomb 07|Open your Goblin All-In-1-Der Belt and plant the Blastcracker explosives on the vault door in order to blow it open. *No Dud Guarantee!}}
# {{Abilities|Ear-O-Scope|icon=inv misc ear nightelf 02|Extend the Ear-O-Scope artificial ear from the Goblin All-In-1-Der Belt against the vault door to listen to the lock tumblers. Real Troll ear included!}}
# {{Abilities|icon=inv misc enggizmos swissarmy|Infinifold Lockpick|Try to jimmy the vault door with one of the Infinifold Lockpicks that can be found in your Goblin All-In-1-Der Bet. Of course, with this many lockpicks, it might take a while to find the right one.}}
# {{Abilities|Kaja'mite Drill|icon=inv weapon shortblade 21|Break the Kaja'mite Drill out of your Goblin All-In-1-Der Belt to bore through the vault door's locking mechanism. Kaja'mite: accept no substitutes!}}

:{{text|bossemote|The vault will be cracked open once the {{text|red|Vault Breaking progress bar reaches 100 percent!}}<br />Doing the wrong thing at the wrong time will reduce the progress of the bar.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Good luck!}}
