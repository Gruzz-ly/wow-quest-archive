==Objectives==
Deliver Sassy's Incentive to [[Foreman Dampwick]] at [[KTC Headquarters]] on [[Kezan (starting zone)|Kezan]].
*[[Sassy's Incentive]] (provided)

==Description==
With all of the troubles down in the [[Kaja'mine]], Foreman Dampwick's been going crazy trying to find you. He said something about some '[[Defiant Troll|defiant trolls]]'.

The [[kaja'mite]] that our [[troll]]s are mining is critical ingredient in [[:Kaja'Cola]]. That bubbly stuff is making us a fortune, and it's going to get you a promotion to Trade <Prince/Princess>!

But first, we have to get production flowing again. You'll find the foreman to the east. Here, give him this as an incentive to get his act together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Um... everything's going great. Yeah.

What's that?

==Completion==
A gift from Sassy? I hope it's a bonus!

==Notes==
Sassy's gossip text:

{{Dialogue|
Hey there, boss. I trust that you're enjoying your new promotion?

We all think that you're the one who's going to finally be able to replace that stinky ol' [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] and take the title of Trade <Prince/Princess>. But you didn't hear that from me!

We have a lot to do and very little time. Hope you're ready!
