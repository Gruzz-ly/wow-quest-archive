Was that all of them? I know that I saw a lot rushing in!

Phew, that was close, boss. Unfortunately, I'm the bearer of more bad news.

Please don't shoot me...

== Notes ==
There are a large number of hostile pirates attacking the partygoers. However, they will not aggro on the player merely by walking by. There's also one or two riding around on a motorcycle.
