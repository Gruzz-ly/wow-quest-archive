==Objectives==
Collect 12 Kaja'mite Chunks.
*[[Kaja'mite Chunk]] (12)
*[[Kablooey Bombs]] (provided)

==Description==
<Sir/Ma'am>, we need tons of [[moolah]] to pay the [[Jastor Gallywix|Trade Prince]] and get off [[Kezan]]! Well, tons of it is just waiting for the taking down there in the [[Kaja'mine]]!

These are the last known deposits of [[kaja'mite]] anywhere. This is the raw stuff that made us the genius [[tinkerer]]s and [[alchemist]]s we are today. If that's not worth a bazillion macaroons, I don't know what is!

Take some of my kablooey bombs and blowup the deposits. Then, pick up the chunks.

Just watch out for the rebellious trolls!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||75}}
*355 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
How much Kaja'mite do you have?

==Completion==
Nicely done, <sir/ma'am>, nicely done! That's a fortune you have there in your bags.

With all of that, I bet the Trade Prince will let all of us come along on his yacht!

==Notes==
The bomb is a ground-targeted AoE. Use it on the big Kaja'mite deposits to blow them up in to three Kaja'mite Chunks. It's possible to use the bombs to stun the rebellious trolls, if for a second or so.
