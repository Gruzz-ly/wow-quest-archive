== Objectives ==
Beat down Bruno Flamertardant, Frankie Gearslipper, Mack the Hammer, and Sudsy Magee.
*[[Bruno Flameretardant]] beaten down
*[[Frankie Gearslipper]] beaten down
*[[Jack the Hammer]] beaten down
*[[Sudsy Magee]] beaten down

== Description ==
We need to send a message to several deadbeats. Of course, they're hiding out in [[Drudgetown]], the scum. I know how you hate going into the slums, boss-<man/lady>, but what can we do?

<Sassy rifles through some paperwork.>

I have all of the names right here.

Might I suggest a little 'personal visit'? A couple of strategic beatdowns would send a message to the other debtors AND your competition.

<Name> is not a goblin to be trifled with!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Debt Collector's Grips
|Debt Collector's Gloves
|Cracking Whip
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Is that all of them? Let's cross-check the list real quick just to be sure.

== Completion ==
A complete success if I do say so myself, <sir/ma'am>! Your debtors will think twice now about not paying up!

<Sassy taps her pencil against her lower lip for a moment, deep in thought.>

Perhaps we should increase interest rates on loans across the board?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Off to the Bank]] and [[Report for Tryouts]] before leaving headquarters. Go to Drudgetown and take out the four targets, but don't return to KTC Headquarters until getting sent back on the footbomb chain.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Sassy Hardwrench|Ace, Izzy, Gobber, you three make sure you tag along with <name> and help <him/her> take care of those deadbeats!}}
