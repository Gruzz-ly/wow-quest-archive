==Description==
My guys are all on the injured roster! Our shredders are all kaput! The ref is about to call the game!

It's down to the wire and I need you, <name>!!!

Let's get one of these shredders in working condition. There are replacement parts all over [[Bilgewater Port]]. Any green-blooded [[Kezan]]ian will gladly let you have them if there's a chance that the Buccaneers will win.

We'll show those no-good Steamwheedle Sharks how to play footbomb!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||50}}
*250 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
We're counting on you, <name>!

==Completion==
That's my <boy/girl>! Now to get one of these useless hunks of metal in working order and you into the game!

==Notes==
There's crates everywhere.

On accept:
