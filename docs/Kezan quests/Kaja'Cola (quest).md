== Objectives ==
Deliver the Six-Pack of Kaja'Cola to {{NPC||Sassy Hardwrench}} at [[KTC Headquarters]] on [[Kezan (starting zone)|Kezan]].
* [[Six-Pack of Kaja'Cola]] (provided)

== Description ==
Sassy has been riding me to supply some [[Kaja'Cola]] for the party that's being thrown in your honor later today.

Oops, was it supposed to be a surprise? You didn't hear it from me.

Anyhow, with production down these last few days, this is all I managed to get made. Would you take it to her?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||3}}
*15 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}
*[[Kaja'Cola]]

== Progress ==
<Sassy eyes the six-pack warily, as if she expects it to explode as soon as you hand it to her.>

We need more Kaja'Cola than this!

I swear I'm going to fire Dampwick if I don't kill him first!

== Completion ==
Just so you know, you'll find Kaja'Cola all over town. It's the [[Bilgewater Cartel]]'s best-selling product of all time!

Just remember, image is everything if we're going to get you promoted to Trade <Prince/Princess>! No, wait, profits are everything! Explosions are a close second! Then, image!

== Notes ==
;On accept:
:{{text|say|Foreman Dampwick|Boss, tell Sassy that I'll get her more Kaja'Cola just as soon as production resumes.}}

;On finish
:{{text|say|He'll get me more later? How are we supposed to get you promoted to Trade Prince without our number one product on the shelves?!!!}}
