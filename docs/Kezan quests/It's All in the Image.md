==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sassy Hardwrench]] to select a "marketing partner".
*Select a "marketing partner"

==Description==
Ah right, I almost forgot. So, the higher-ups in the marketing department say you need a good partner to soften your aesthetic of... you know, "murder everyone around me for gold." 

We've got two focus group approved [[goblin]]s over there ready to go, so go take your pick. Sassy will handle the paperwork. 

Oh, don't give me that look. You only gotta forever-love each other in front of the public. Once the cameras are off, no one cares. It'll be great for your reputation!

==Rewards==
You will  receive:
*{{cost|||55}}
*200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
C'mon, this ain't rocket surgery. Pick whoever you wanna pose on some magazine covers with.

==Completion==
There we go! Nice and artificial, just like all the best marketing should be.

And I just finished the paperwork for your other big image upgrade. I think you're really going like this!

==Notes==
Go to Sassy Hardwrench, who will say

:{{text|say|Ah right, I almost forgot. Megs needs you to pick a marketing partner, yeah? <br> Candy and Chip here both knocked it outta the park in the focus groups. Top scores in fashion, charm, and propensity for manufactured drama. <br/>Either of 'em will play off your murderous, no-nonsense image real nicely. Should make the average goblin feel like you're more relatable. Like you got a secret soft side, sorta like a rotten peach.<br>Anyway, which one you wanna go with?}}

Return to Megs Dreadshredder to finish the quest.
