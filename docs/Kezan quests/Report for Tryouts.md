<Name>, Coach Crosscheck, the leader of our fearless footbomb team, the [[Bilgewater Buccaneers]], is looking for you.

He says that the division title against the [[Steamwheedle Sharks]] is on the line and that you're the only one that can bring it home for us!

Head west into town. You can't miss [[Kajaro Field]]!

A footbomb star. This is going to be great for your image.
