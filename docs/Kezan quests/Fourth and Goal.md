== Objectives ==
Score the winning goal by kicking the Footbomb through the smokestacks behind the opposing goal.
*Footbomb Kicked Through Smokestacks

== Description ==
It's all up to you, kid. You demolished the Steamwheedle Sharks, so now all that's left to do is to kick the winning goal.

Now, just between you and me, I think we should do this one right. I don't want you to just kick a goal... I want you to kick it so far it sails between the two smokestacks behind the goal!

I've modified the footbomb to give you the extra power that you'll need.

Make me proud!

Uh... you did it, kid. You REALLY did it! We won the game and...

Upon kicking the ball through the smokestacks:
:''Deathwing flies into frame toward [[Mount Kajaro]]!''
:{{text|yell|Deathwing|The sun has set on this mortal world, [[Goblin|fools]]. Make peace with your end, for the [[Hour of Twilight|hour of twilight]] falls!}}
:''Deathwing attacks Mount Kajaro, setting it alight, then circles back around to the field before flying out of frame''
:{{text|bossemote|What did that dragon do to Mount Kajaro?!!!}}
:{{text|say|Ace|What was that thing, toots?}}
:{{text|say|Izzy|Why's the ground shaking, <name>?}}

== Trivia ==
In early beta-testing for the ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' expansion, the Footbomb itself triggered the volcano's eruption when it was kicked so far as to plunge directly into the crater, making the player directly responsible for the destruction of Kezan. It was later changed to make [[Deathwing|Deathwing]] the culprit, befitting his status as the ultimate enemy of the [[World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm|Cataclysm]] storyline.
