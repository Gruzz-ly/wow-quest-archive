== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix}} upstairs at the [[KTC Headquarters]] main building on [[Kezan (starting zone)|Kezan]].

== Description ==
While you were dealing with the {{NPC||Pirate Party Crasher||pirates}}, I noticed the Trade Prince slip upstairs. He's up on the balcony at the top of the stairs.

<Name>, I think he's the one that sent the pirates.

<Sassy cringes.>

You'd better get up there A.S.A.P.! You wouldn't want to keep him waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 35 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
Well, well, well, if it isn't my wayward protege, <Mr./Mrs.> <name>.

I'm hurt and disappointed. You didn't send me an invitation to your little party out there. Sorry about the crashers... you know how pirates can be.

So, shall we get down to business?

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sassy Hardwrench|You better get upstairs pronto, boss. Trade Prince Gallywix is waiting for you.}}
