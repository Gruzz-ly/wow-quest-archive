==Objectives==
Kill [[scourge]] forces around [[Light's Hope Chapel]].

==Description==
;Normal description
Normally, <name>, paladins from Light's Hope hold back the scourge in the immediate area around the chapel, but they've all been called to fight the Void.

As a result, scourge forces have greatly increased their numbers around the chapel. We've managed to hold the line so far, but only with the help of [[Darion Mograine|Darion]] and the Ebon Blade.

Give us some room to breathe defeat as many of them as you can.

;To paladins, he says
Highlord <name>! Nearly all of our paladins have been called to fight the void. I can only speculate why I was not among them.

But as a result, Scourge forces have built up quite a strong force around the chapel. Were it not for Darion's aid from Acherus, we would already be overrun, but holding the line is all they can do. 

Give us some room to breathe, Highlord--defeat as many of them as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Light's Hope Shoulders]]
* [[Light's Hope Mantle]]
* [[Light's Hope Shoulderpads]]
* [[Light's Hope Epaulets]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*13,365 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>--you've thinned their ranks enough that we'll be able to maintain the defenses, with the help we have from our... allies.

Now, [[Alonsus Faol|Faol]] has told me about your need for relics.
