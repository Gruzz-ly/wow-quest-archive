==Objectives==
Obtain the Extended Annals of Darrowshire from [[Carlin Redpath]], and obtain Davil's Libram and Redpath's Shield from the [[Marris Stead]].
*[[Extended Annals of Darrowshire]]
*[[Davil's Libram]]
*[[Redpath's Shield]]

==Description==
The heroes of [[Darrowshire]] held relics of their own, and inside of those relics lie more precious memories.

First, speak with Carlin and obtain the Extended Annals of Darrowshire. Within the tome lies the narrative that will drive our excursion through time.

Then, you will need to head west to the Marris Stead. The former owner of the Marris farmhouse collected relics from the [[battle of Darrowshire]] - for what reason, I am not certain.

Gather these relics, and return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*4,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the relics, <name>?

==Completion==
You have the relics? Good. I will get to work on resolving any temporal discontinuities.

Don't worry... that's not something you have to worry about. You just gather the reagents.

==Notes==
Talking with Carlin Redpath:

:{{gossip|Carlin, do you have the extended Annals of Darrowshire?}}
:Why yes... does Chromie need this?  I suppose she would.

:Yes, you may have it.  Feel free to leaf through the pages.  Inside you will find the history of Darrowshire, and the details of the events that led to the deaths of so very many men.

==Progression==
