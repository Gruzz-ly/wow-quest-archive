==Objectives==
Use Rayne's Seeds in the center of the three ziggurats in the [[Fungal Vale]].
*Seed planted in southeastern necropolis
*Seed planted in western necropolis
*Seed planted in northeastern necropolis
*[[Rayne's Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Scourge]] forces have made it a point to ensure that nothing survives in the Fungal Vale - all you will find are husks of rotted mushrooms and scorched grasses. The three corners of the vale are home to three large ziggurats, which they use to reanimate their dead and summon new soldiers to the battlefield.

Yet even in this evil, lifeless place, life finds a way to flourish. Take my seeds and plant them in the centers of these ziggurats. Prove to them that life will prevail. 

==Progress==
I am confident that nature will find a foothold within those ziggurats.

==Completion==
Even if the flowers died out shortly after they bloomed, they proved our point to the Scourge: they are losing, and we are winning.

Thank you for your assistance.

== Notes ==
When planted, the seed creates flower beds that spread out over about half the ziggurat's floor before dying out.
