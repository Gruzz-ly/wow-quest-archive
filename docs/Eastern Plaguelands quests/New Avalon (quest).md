==Objectives==
Use the Scarlet Insignia once you have acquired enough disguise pieces to fool the [[Scarlet Crusader]]s in [[New Avalon]] and speak with [[Inquisitor Jociphine]] again. Players with armor crafting professions can utilize recipes and plans for scarlet armor pieces obtained from hostile crusaders in [[Tyr's Hand]] and New Avalon.
* Use the Scarlet Insignia
* [[Scarlet Insignia]] (provided)

==Description==
As you've seen, New Avalon boasts a significant military presence but it also offers safety and security to civilians.

If you can cobble together a more permanent disguise, consider offering a helping hand. Ingratiating yourself with the folk there could be beneficial to our efforts to reclaim the {{Sod|Scarlet Enclave|enclave}}, to say nothing of putting you in a position to "appropriate" some of the material and resources there, enriching yourself and depriving their war machine of crucial supplies.

==Progress==
If you are having trouble acquiring the pieces you need via crafting them yourself, perhaps strike a trade with others who have the proper skills and access to suitable designs and patterns.

==Completion==
Convincing enough, I suppose.

New Avalon lost some of its master craftsmen during a caravan run to Hearthglen a few years back, but I can see some of their designs were not lost.

If you haven't honed your own tradeskills much, you may have a harder time making headway in New Avalon. However, regardless or whether you know how to work a hammer or a needle, I suspect you may want to at least pay a visit to the quartermaster in the barracks. You might also be able to rummage around their storeroom.
