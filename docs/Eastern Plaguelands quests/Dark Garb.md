==Objectives==
Obtain Death Cultist Headwear and Death Cultist Robes from cultists within [[Corin's Crossing]].
*[[Death Cultist Headwear]]
*[[Death Cultist Robes]]

==Description==
Some of my counterparts have told me that the land wants to heal, but several high-ranking undead - along with the [[Cult of the Damned]] - are not allowing it to. That means we have to stop them! I've got a plan, but first, you're going to need a cultist disguise.

Head southeast into [[Corin's Crossing]], and take the clothing from the human cultists that roam through the town. I'll contact you when you've completed this step. 

==Progress==
Everything going alright so far, <name>?

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Betinabigglezink.jpg|Betina Bigglezink|This is going to be great!}}
You've got both pieces! Good. These will help when trying to sneak into their death camp.

== Notes ==
The {{NPC||Dark Summoner (Eastern Plaguelands)||Dark Summoners}} and {{NPC||Vile Tutor}}s drop the items.
