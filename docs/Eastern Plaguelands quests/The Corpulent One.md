'''The Corpulent One''' is a quest where the player must find and slay {{NPC||Borelgore}} on behalf of {{NPC||Gamella Cracklefizz}} and the [[Argent Crusade]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Borelgore.jpg|Borelgore|You. It's what's for dinner.}}
Find {{NPC||Borelgore}} in the northern wastes of [[Eastern Plaguelands]] and destroy him.
* Borelgore slain

==Description==
North of here and west of [[Northdale]], you will find the corpulent [[maggot]] beast, Borelgore.

I've lost entire regiments to that monster.  His size knows no bounds!  The more he eats the greater his girth becomes...

While I would not suffer any emotional harm should the beast devour you, I would prefer that you were the victor.  I recommend you enlist the help of others for this mission.  Borelgore has been known to devour others who tried to hunt him.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Eastwall Gauntlets|Borelgore's Skin|Corpulent Shoulderpads}}

*You will also receive:
*{{cost||60}}
*5050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||57}} at 70)
*+325 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
Have I told you lately that I hate you?

==Completion==
Keep this up and I may have to keep you here at [[Eastwall Tower|Eastwall]], <race>.

==Notes==
Borelgore resides in a northern pit, patrolling from west to east and under a bridge.
