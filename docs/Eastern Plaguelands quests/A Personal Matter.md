==Objectives==
Meet [[Leonid Barthalomew the Revered]] just outside the service entrance gate to the east of the front gates of [[Stratholme]].

==Description==
What we spoke about at [[Light's Hope Chapel|Light's Hope]] and my history with [[Caldoran]]... It all started right here at Stratholme. You are familiar with the "[[Culling of Stratholme|culling]]" of Stratholme that occurred early on in the [[Third War]], yes?

Well, I was here, and so was Caldoran. This is where our history begins. If you would be willing, meet me just outside of Stratholme's service entrance to the east.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
I'm glad you came. I don't know if I'd be able to do what comes next alone.

==Progression==
