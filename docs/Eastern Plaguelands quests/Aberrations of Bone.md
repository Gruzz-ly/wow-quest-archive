==Objectives==
Kill Rattlegore in the [[Great Ossuary|Ossuary]] of [[Scholomance]].
*[[Rattlegore]] slain

==Description==
In life, my brothers and I fought against all the forces of the [[Scourge]], but none were so reviled as the [[necromancer]]s. It was not enough for them raise our dead comrades and send them against us; no, they created twisted golems of bone with scythes for hands.

These aberrations slew many of my brothers, and yet we could not destroy them all. I ask you, <name>, to carry on the task of the fallen. Venture into the Ossuary of Scholomance and slay the largest and most dangerous of these abominable creatures.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +2000 reputation with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
Have you carried on our fight against the remnants of the Scourge in these lands?

==Completion==
Your deeds do honor to those who fell in battle defending this hallowed ground.
