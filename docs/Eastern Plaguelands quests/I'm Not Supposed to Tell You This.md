==Objectives==
Obtain Joseph's Hunting Blade from [[The Lone Hunter]] in Eastern Plaguelands.
*[[Joseph's Hunting Blade]]

==Description==
[[Joseph Redpath|My daddy]] always kept two swords: one for fighting with men, and one for hunting the animals. I wasn't supposed to touch his swords, but I knew where he hid them.

One day, he told my mommy that he was going to fight a "lone hunter" in the hills to the east, but he brought his animal sword with him! When he came back, he didn't have his sword with him.

When daddy comes back, he'll be so happy when I give him his animal sword! Will you go and find it?

==Progress==
Daddy loved his animal sword. He seemed sad when he didn't have it anymore.

==Completion==
That's my daddy's sword! How did you find it? Did you find the bad hunter?
