==Objectives==
Free 8 Darrowshire Spirits from the bodies of [[Cannibal Ghoul]]s, then speak with them. 
*[[Darrowshire Spirit]]s Freed (8)

==Description==
The [[battle of Darrowshire]] was one of the many tragedies that we humans suffered at the hands of the [[Scourge]]. Its effects are still felt even today.

Many of the town's valiant defenders now roam again as the ghastly servants of the Scourge. We will end their misery.

Hunt cannibal ghouls here within the [[Plaguewood]]. Many of these fiends were once the good folk of [[Darrowshire]], and destroying their forms now will set their souls free.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*5300 [[XP]]
*+325 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
The poor defenders of Darrowshire cry out for freedom.

==Completion==
It is good to hear you found the tortured souls of my brethren and freed them.  I find my strength renewed, knowing at least some of the defenders of Darrowshire no longer wallow in the vile subservience of the Scourge.
