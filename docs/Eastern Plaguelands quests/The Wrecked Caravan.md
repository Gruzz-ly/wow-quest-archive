==Description==
[[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus|Lord Tyrosus]] has asked me to investigate the remnants of a Scarlet Crusade caravan in Plaguewood along the road to Stratholme.

Recent reports tell of extensive crusade movements all across the [[plaguelands]] leading up to the schism at [[Tyr's Hand]], and this caravan may be able to provide us with some indication as to their purpose.

I'll meet you there and we will investigate this together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45|}}
*6,600 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
There's definitely something strange about all of this. Did you find anything of interest?

==Completion==
So this caravan contained... [[plague]] samples taken from [[Naxxramas]]? But why? To what end? Was the Scarlet Crusade trying to study the plague to combat it?

==Notes==
Find the [[Scarlet Caravan]] with the {{Sod|Dented Chest}} and loot [[Research Notes (Season of Discovery)]] and [[Mysterious Alchemical Sample]].
