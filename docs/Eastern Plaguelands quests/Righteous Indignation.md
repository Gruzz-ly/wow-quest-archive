Obtain 30 Mossflayer Eyes from [[Mossflayer tribe|Mossflayer trolls]] in [[Zul'Mashar]].
[[Mossflayer Eye]]s (30)

==Description==
The [[Mossflayer]]s of [[Zul'Mashar]] spit in the face of [[the Light]]! They cannibalize, they criminalize, they prioritize the forces of evil over good! I advise that you remove their eyes, and give rise to the demise and the goodbyes of the unwise!

You will travel north, and you will rain down on them with righteous justice and indignation, <name>. The fury that they have wrought in the eyes of the Light shall be channeled through you. 

==Progress==
<Deacon Andaal is deep in prayer.> 

==Completion==
Oh, hallelujah, and praise, praise be to the Light, my brother!
