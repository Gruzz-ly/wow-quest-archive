==Objectives==
Speak with [[Fiona]] at [[Eastwall Tower]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
[[Maxwell Tyrosus|Tyrosus]] has given us our next task: slaying more undead in [[Northdale]]. [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]] is excited to move forward, but I think we should show a little more caution.

Let's meet up with Fiona. She should be at the next tower by now... Eastwall Tower, I think it's called. It's close by, to the northwest of [[Light's Hope Chapel|Light's Hope]]. We can rest there, and plan our attack on Northdale.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

==Completion==
Hello, <name>! Glad to see you've rejoined the caravan!

[[Tarenar Sunstrike|Tarenar]] and Gidwin arrived here before you. Tarenar's just right there, and Gidwin's... well... he's in a little bit of a mood right now. I think he's in the tower.

==Notes==
The impatient Gidwin is circling the interior of the tower:
*{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Tyrosus himself sent us to Northdale!  So why are we wasting our time with upstart [[nerubian]]s?!}}
*{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|I don't know why I put up with his nonsense.  He never takes anything seriously.}}
*{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|That useless [[blood elf]]!  We have a DUTY to perform, and he wastes our time!}}
*{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|I'll throw my hammer upside his head if he makes us wait any longer.}}

==Progression==
{{Fiona's Caravan}}
