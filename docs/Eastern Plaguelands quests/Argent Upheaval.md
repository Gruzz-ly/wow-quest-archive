==Objectives==
Report to [[Archmage Angela Dosantos]] at [[Tyr's Hand]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]]. 

==Description==
I'll say we've done enough damage to these barracks to call this a win. A commander, a huntsman, and a warlock, all slain... not to mention the relics that we've liberated. Or shall I say... YOU liberated.

The cathedral still remains, but not for long. Talk with Archmage Angela Dosantos, in the central courtyard. The fate of [[Scarlet Basilica|Tyr's Hand's cathedral]] falls in her able hands. 

==Completion==
It sounds like [[Crusade Commander Korfax|Korfax]] really cleaned house over at the barracks.  It's very much like him to show off like that. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

==Progression==
{{The Brotherhood of Light}}
