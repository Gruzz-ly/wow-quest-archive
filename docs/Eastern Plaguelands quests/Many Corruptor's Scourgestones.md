==Progress==
A Corruptor's Scourgestone was the insignia of the [[Scourge]]'s overlords. Powerful beings that once held a position of authority over the Scourge always possessed one.

I formerly exchanged valor tokens for these. While I doubt you will ever find more, please bring any others back to me immediately so I can see to their destruction.
* [[Corruptor's Scourgestone]] (5)

==Completion==
More and more [[scourgestone]]s pile up by the day, <name>, from yourself and a growing number of other [[adventurer]]s.

Fortunately, none of our soldiers have mysteriously disappeared nor have I heard more bloodcurdling screams than what is normal for this region.

I would rather not ask questions. Here is your reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 5x [[Argent Dawn Valor Token]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
