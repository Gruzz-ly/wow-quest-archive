==Objectives==
Travel to [[Terrordale]] and find [[Leonid Barthalomew the Revered]] at one of the houses there.

==Description==
It took me many years to recover from my guilt once my mind was set free from the [[Lich King]]. Once liberated by [[Sylvanas]], I rejected the Dark Lady's offer and walked into the [[plaguelands]] alone. I wandered for months aimlessly. I'm not sure why I did it but eventually I found my way back to my family's home and what I found there was... unexpected.

Travel to the haunted village now known as Terrordale, find the northernmost house and meet me there. You'll learn the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
It sickens me to see what has become of my home.

==Progression==
