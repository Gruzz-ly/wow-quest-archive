==Objectives==
Bury the Light-Touched Blades in the bodies of 10 Slain Scourge Troopers.
* Blades buried (10)
* [[Light-Touched Blades]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Noxious Glade]] is a quagmire, both literally and figuratively. There's enough [[Scourge]] up there to give us trouble for the rest of both of our lifetimes.

They can re-animate the weaker ones when they die, <name>. They will never stop coming if we don't do something.

Take these blades and drive them through the corpses of any Scourge troopers you find. The blade is simple, but its enchantment will prevent the dead bones from being reanimated. Forever.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Omarion's Gift
|Cowl of the Noxious Glade
|Light-Touched Pendant}}
You will also receive: {{cost||55}}

==Progress==
Are you still here?

==Completion==
Our duty for the day is done.

It is only a matter of time before we defeat the Scourge.  Today, we made progress.

==Notes==
[[Slain Scourge Trooper]]s are skeletons you can find on the ground at the mill, and in the Noxious Glade.  Inanimate, of course.
