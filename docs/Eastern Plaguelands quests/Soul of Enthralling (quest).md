==Objectives==
Use a Glowing Scroll of Spatial Mending on a Large Fel Rift to summon a Fel Interloper and obtain its soul.
*Use [[Glowing Scroll of Spatial Mending]] on Fel Portal
*Obtain [[Soul of Enthralling]]
*Use Soul of Enthralling

==Description==
Your next task is a much trickier one that involves those [[Fel]] portals that have been appearing around. I've heard that when mages use special scrolls, they summon powerful Fel Interlopers. The scourge in [[Plaguewood]] seem to be up to a similar trick. Use the [[demon]] they are attempting to summon in the same way for the next soul shard.

==Progress==
Is everything going well?

==Completion==
You have truly gone above and beyond, <name>. Just one more soul and the scythe will be ready for its final test.

==Notes==
Kill the [[Cursed Mage]] inside the ziggurat in the [[Plaguewood]] to obtain the [[Glowing Scroll of Spatial Mending]], then use it on the nearby [[Large Fel Rift]] to summon a [[Fel Interloper]]. Use [[Drain Soul]] on it to obtain the [[Soul of Enthralling]], then use it on the [[Depleted Scythe of Chaos (Void)]] and return to Doan.

==Progression==
{{The Depleted Scythe}}
