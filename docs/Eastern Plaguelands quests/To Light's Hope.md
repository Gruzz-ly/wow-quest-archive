==Objectives==
Meet [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]].

==Description==
The holy power in my staff has been spent. Forty years of fervent prayers drained away in a few minutes. It was for a good cause, and my staff will recover in time.

There are other relics, like my staff, that were important to paladins and priests. [[Light's Hope Chapel|Light's Hope chapel]] has many such relics stored there.

[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] trained there as well, perhaps the solution to his pain could also be found there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,710 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Light's Hope, <name>.

Most of the paladins that defended these grounds were called by the Light. I've had to reach out to the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Ebon Blade]] for support, or the [[scourge]] would have overrun this holy place.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|To Light's Hope to gather relics and inspire the [[Vanguard of the Light|Vanguard]].}}
:''Arator & Alonsus begin to leave.''
:{{Text|Say|Arator|No better place to take my mind off the problems with paladins.}}

Go to [[Light's Hope Chapel]]. Arator and Alonsus are speaking to Maxwell Tyrosus. [[Darion Mograine]], [[Sally Whitemane]], [[Thoras Trollbane]], [[Nazgrim]], [[Thassarian]], and [[Koltira Deathweaver]] are busy battling the [[Scourge Remnant]]s.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Lord Tyrosus, I had no idea things were so desperate. What can we do to help?}}

Tyrosus has a gossip:
{{dialogue|The one good, <name>, of me not being called to the Sunwell is I was able to coordinate a defense of Light's Hope.

{{gossip|You weren't called to the Sunwell?}}
{{dialogue-child|I have faithfully served the Light throughout my life, <name>--even lost an eye along the way.

Some are stronger paladins than me, but not many.

But outside of a few defenders and our squires, nearly everyone was taken to Silvermoon to stop the Void.

I can't help but wonder if I've failed the Light in some way, yet I can't see how.}}

{{gossip|How did death knights come to defend Light's Hope?}}
{{dialogue-child|There was no one else. Nearly every paladin was taken by the Light to the Sunwell.

Darion owed me a favor, in a sense, for [[The Fourth Horseman|trying to kill]] me and take [[Tirion Fordring|Tirion]]'s body to be one of his horsemen.

And he has no desire to see the Void come closer to a triumph over Azeroth.

So when I asked for help. the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Ebon Blade]] stepped up to assist us.}}
}}

So does Alonsus Faol:
{{Dialogue|
{{gossip|I didn't expect so much Scarlet activity here, <name>.

The [[Scarlet Crusade|Scarlets]] have experienced many setbacks, but they're clearly rising in strength again.}}
