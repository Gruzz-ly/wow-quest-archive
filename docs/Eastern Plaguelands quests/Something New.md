==Objectives==
Use the New Plague Samples on weakened [[Cannibal Ghoul]]s, [[Stitched Horror]]s, [[Cursed Mage]]s, [[Scourge Soldier]]s and [[Scourge Warder]]s found throughout [[Plaguewood]] and observe the effects.
*Plague Tested (8)
*[[New Plague Samples]] (provided)

==Description==
I think we need to learn more about this new plague. This seems to be targeted at... killing the [[undead]] and the living? The undead are naturally immune to the [[plague of undeath]], being of said plague to begin with. If what I suspect is true, this might be something new and terrible.

I am loathe to subject the undead here to more torment, but we must learn more before we return to [[Light's Hope Chapel|Light's Hope]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|80|}}
* 6,600 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
Being this close to [[Stratholme]] is unsettling to me after...

<Leonid Barthalomew the Revered pauses while looking in the direction of Stratholme and you notice that his hand starts to tremble slightly.>

...nevermind, it's nothing.

Let's conclude our business here quickly, <name>.

==Completion==
The effect these plagues have on the undead are profound and terrifying. If these were to be turned against the [[forsaken]] in the [[ruins of Lordaeron]], well, it could  be catastrophic.

There's one other test we need to perform.

==Notes==
Attack the Scourge mobs, get them to 50%, and use the sample on them.

==Progression==
