*Warlord Thresh'jin's Body burned
*[[Body of Warlord Thresh'jin]] ''(provided)''

==Description==
This is the last time you will see me, <name>. I am leaving the caravan.

If you want to continue fighting by my side, hang on to Thresh'jin's body. I can wait for a while longer. When you are ready to say goodbye, throw the body into the bonfire atop Zul'Mashar's ziggurat.

Thank you for your companionship, <name>. You were strong.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||60}}
*[[Strength's Supremacy]]

==Completion==
[[Vex'tul]] has passed on into the next realm. Your job here in [[Zul'Mashar]] is done.

Wait, what's this? Vex'tul must have dropped it on his way into the fire.
