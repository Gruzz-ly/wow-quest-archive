==Objectives==
Obtain Des'Altek's soul from Demon Fall Canyon and use it to finish restoring the scythe.
*Speak to [[Doan Karhan]]
*Enter {{Sod|Demon Fall Canyon}} Alone
*Summon [[Des'Altek]]
*Des'Altek slain
*Use [[Soul of Des'Altek]]

==Description==
I should reveal my true purpose now, <name>. I believe this scythe can help put a stop to Des'Altek once and for all. Meet me at Demon Fall Canyon in {{C|Ashenvale}} so that we can use him as the final soul needed to restore the scythe to full power.

==Progress==
Is everything going well?

==Completion==
Thank you for helping me, <name>. You have done well. Please keep the scythe as a token of my gratitude.

==Notes==
Doan can be found at [[Felfire Hill]] in {{C|Ashenvale}}.

{{dialogue|{{gossip|What are we doing at Demon Fall Canyon?}}

I have heard tale of another Dark Ritual Stone in Demon Fall Canyon. I believe that there are those that are trying to bring Des'Altek back. That scythe of yours should be powerful enough now to enter and allow you to call him forth. You must do this alone, as I do not trust that aid would not be beholden to him. Go and defeat him, <name>, and bring the scythe to its full power.}}

Enter the {{sod|Demon Fall Canyon}} dungeon solo and find the [[Dark Ritual Stone (Demon Fall Canyon)|Dark Ritual Stone]] on a small side path near the entrance. Use it to summon [[Des'Altek]], then kill him to obtain the [[Soul of Des'Altek]]. Use the soul on the [[Depleted Scythe of Chaos (Devouring)]] to create the [[Scythe of Chaos]].

==Progression==
{{The Depleted Scythe}}
