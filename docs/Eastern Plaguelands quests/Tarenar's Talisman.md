==Completion==
Tarenar has laid a few holy talismans inside the caravan. They appear to be unused.

They appear to be magical in nature. If Tarenar isn't using them, what's the harm in borrowing one for a while?

==Rewards==
The following spell will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Tarenar's Talisman|Grants a chance to deal extra Holy damage on successful spell attacks within Eastern Plaguelands.  The amount of damage dealt increases as more travelers join Fiona's Caravan.|id=85614|icon=inv_jewelry_necklace_16}}

==Notes==
This quest becomes available once you complete the quest [[A Gift For Fiona]] and {{NPC||Tarenar Sunstrike}} joins the caravan.
