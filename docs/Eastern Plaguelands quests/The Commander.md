==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Marjhan Undead.jpg|Scarlet Commander Marjhan|She has nothing left to lose.}}
Slay Scarlet Commander Marjhan.

*[[Scarlet Commander Marjhan]] slain

==Description==
Scarlet Commander Marjhan is cunning, shrewd, and willing to do anything to win a battle. Before all these things, however, she is loyal.

I have no doubt you'll find her in the barracks' central chamber, fighting under a crimson banner, until she either wins or dies.

Make sure it's the latter. 

==Progress==
If you get a chance before you put her down, tell her I send my regards.

==Completion==
Good, good.  These barracks are as good as fallen.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Marjhan's Stand|Helm of Misplaced Loyalties|Korfax's Signet}}

You will also receive: {{cost||55}}

== Notes ==
On aggro:

==Progression==
