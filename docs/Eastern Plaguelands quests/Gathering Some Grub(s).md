==Objectives==
Seek out the [[Carrion Grub]]s and [[Carrion Devourer|Devourers]] of the region. Slay them and harvest 15 Slabs of Carrion Worm Meat.
*[[Slab of Carrion Worm Meat]] (15)

==Description==
We have problems maintaining our food supplies here in the far east.

Around here, the only manner of beast unaffected by the ravages of the plague are the carrion worms. While rather bland in taste, the meat of the worms can easily be preserved to last for months. We will need several hundred more pounds to be fully-stocked.

While you can find carrion worms all over the Plaguelands, they can be found in particularly high density to the south of the chapel. And remember: larger worms mean more meat.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Grubby Gun
|Worm Harvester's Legguards
|Rimblat's Cloak
|Devourer's Stomach
}}

and you will also receive:
*{{cost||55|}} and [["Delicious" Worm Steak]]
*4820 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
You will grow to tolerate the taste, <race>.  I did. 

==Completion==
May the Earthmother watch over you! Bless you, young one.

==Notes==
As Rimblat says in the quest text, look to the south of the chapel for the worms.
