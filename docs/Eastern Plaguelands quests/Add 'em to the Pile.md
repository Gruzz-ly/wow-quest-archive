==Objectives==
Obtain 16 Stinking Skulls from [[Cursed Mage]]s and [[Scourge Soldier]]s in the [[Plaguewood]]. 
*[[Stinking Skull]] (16)

==Description==
I've been collecting the skulls of the skeletons I defeat. I've amassed a small pile of them.

If you come across any skulls, you are welcome to add them to my pile. The huge pile of skulls seems to keep the waves of undead at bay and... well... it also just makes me happy to look at it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|25}}
{{Itembox|you will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Cloak of Hoarding|Collector's Belt|Stinking Skull Mace|Monnions of Final Rest}}

==Progress==
You seem to have your hands full.  Are those skulls I see?

==Completion==
May my pile never stop growing.
