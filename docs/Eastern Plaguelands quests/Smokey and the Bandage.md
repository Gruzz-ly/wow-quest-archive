*[[Browman's Wrappings]]

==Description==
Hey there!  Interested in makin' a buck?

I need to get a bandage.  Well, actually, I got a friend who needs to get a bandage.  Well actually... let's just say it's complicated, but if you go get this bandage, you make money.  And so do I.  And my friend.  Possibly other people.

Stephen Browman used to own the mill to the north, now he's dead.  A [[zombie]].  The guy at the top wants to have the wrappings from Browman's body.

What's the matter, you don't like money?

==Progress==
You've been fightin' undead.  Did ya find Browman? 

==Completion==
Well well well!  Someone who goes and gets things done!  Here's your cut, chief.  I'll be seein' you around. 

== Notes ==
This may be a play on the movie title "Smokey and the Bandit".
