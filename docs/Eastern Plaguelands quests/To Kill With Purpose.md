==Objectives==
Travel to Corin's Crossing to the south and slaughter the Scourge that inhabit the town. Collect 7 pieces of [[Living Rot]]. Use the Mortar and Pestle to grind the Living Rot into Coagulated Rot.
*[[Coagulated Rot]]
*[[Mortar and Pestle]] ''(provided)''

==Description==
Greetings, stranger! You've entered the heart of the Plaguelands. I hope you brought your undead-killing gear with you.

The plague spreads more slowly these days, so the [[Cult of the Damned]] has stepped up production in order to keep the land brown and dead, as they like it. I've got a plan to stop them. Take my mortar and pestle, and use it on living rot from the undead creatures in [[Corin's Crossing]] to the southeast. We're going to make a little present for the cultists! 

==Progress==
How are things looking in [[Corin's Crossing]]?

==Completion==

Hello! It's me. Hope you don't mind a little home-brewed magic to allow me to communicate with you in the field. It'll save us both some time.

We're going to incorporate that living rot into a mixture that'll ruin their next batch of plague. That'll show them!

== Notes ==
There is a '''10 minute''' time limit on Living Rot. You have to collect 7 Living Rot from the undead and grind them into Coagulated Rot using the mortar and pestle within this time or the entire item stack will disappear from your inventory.
