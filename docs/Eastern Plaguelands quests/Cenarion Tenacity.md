==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rayne]] near the entrance to the [[Fungal Vale]].

==Description==
Those [[druid]]s never give up, I swear. I'd given up on the [[Plaguelands]] years ago, but the [[Cenarion Circle]] folks keep telling me that the land is not beyond hope.

The most recent visitor was a [[night elf]], on her way to the Fungal Vale, to the north. She told me that these lands will make a full recovery, if we try hard enough. I'm not sure I believe her.

Do you buy this drivel? Maybe you and her should talk. She should still be up there. 

==Completion==
I suppose I had better work on my stealth, if you were able to find me.

Are you interested in helping me heal the Plaguelands?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||5}}
