==Objectives==
Bring [[Master Craftsman Omarion]] 20 Arcanite Bars, 20 Obsidian-Infused Thorium Bars, 120 Truesilver Bars, 10 Huge Emeralds, and 20 Righteous Orbs.

* [[Truesilver Bar]] (120)
* [[Huge Emerald]] (10)
* [[Righteous Orb]] (20)

==Description==
In order to create this alloy, we'll need a lot of materials to experiment with. I've prepared a list and, well, I told you it might get expensive.

<Omarion hands you a list that's nearly as long as your forearm.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
Listen, creating metallurgic miracles doesn't just happen by magic. You need time, patience, and someone with deep pockets.

==Completion==
Thinking about the cost of all of this makes my eyes water a bit. Oh well, nothing ventured, nothing gained.
