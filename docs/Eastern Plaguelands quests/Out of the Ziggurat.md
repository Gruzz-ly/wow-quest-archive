Obtain the Body of Warlord Thresh'jin.
*[[Body of Warlord Thresh'jin]]

==Description==
It is time that I asked a favor of you, <name>.

Far to the north of [[Eastwall Tower]], hidden among the hills, is the [[Mossflayer]] capital city of [[Zul'Mashar]]. It was here that I was born, and here that I died.

The traitor, [[Warlord Thresh'jin|Thresh'jin]], sits atop Zul'Mashar's ziggurat. It was my every right to be there, but he took the seat from me with treachery and deceit. He is not strong. He is weak.

I will meet you in Zul'Mashar, and we will kill him. Your strength and mine. Together.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

==Progress==
I have waited long for this day.

==Completion==
My duty is not over yet. In many ways, this was the easy step.
