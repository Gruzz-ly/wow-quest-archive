==Description==
So ye see, we need tae find a suitable [[Dwarf]] corpse and do a bit o' ritual to em' to get my spirit grounded so I can be sent on me way! All perfectly normal stuff, o' course! We'll also need a bit o' Necrotic Runestone from a [[necromancer]] type, of course. I hear there's one in Stratholme. Goes by Maleki the Pallid or some such. Can't expect he'll be too willin' tae part with it willingly but there's a solve fer that!

Get me that stone and then head to the undercroft. There's a corpse there that'll do!
