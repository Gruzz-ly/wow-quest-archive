*[[Augustus' Receipt Book]]

==Description==
I'm ready for business! What do you want?

Oh wait... I can't open up shop without my receipt book. How am I to keep track of things without my receipt book?

I must have left it in town somewhere. I had a room in the inn... the book must be there.

Bring me my book. Please, bring it to me! Bring me my book and you'll see! I'll set up shop and you'll see that my prices are INSANE!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
Do you have my receipt book?  I can't wait to get back to business!

==Completion==
There it is!  And oh my!  I forgot how full it was!

This is a glorious day, <name>!  Stupendous!  Insanely good, I say!
