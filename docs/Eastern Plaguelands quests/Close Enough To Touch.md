==Objectives==
Kill [[Shadowmage (mob)|Shadowmages]] and [[Dread Weaver]]s in the [[Noxious Glade]] and search their corpses for something that can help you break the shield protecting [[Arkonos the Cursed|Arkonos]].
*[[Scourge Shadow Scalpel]]

==Description==
These vile [[necromancer]]s and their tricks, it's disgusting. We must find a way to break through the barrier protecting Arkonos to end him!

Many [[Cult of the Damned]] and [[Scourge]] spellcasters are known to carry a variety of fell implements and foci of dark magic. Perhaps some of the nearby Shadowmages or Dread Weavers may have something we could use to penetrate the shield?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6,600 [[XP]]
*{{cost|3|96}}
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*+100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
What did you find, <name>?

==Completion==
Yes! This might just do it. Let us make haste back to the slaughterhouse and put this device to the test!

==Progression==
{{Finish the Fight}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.3|note=Added.}}
