Completing this quest makes available three repeatable quests from [[Fiona's Caravan]]:  [[Fiona's Lucky Charm]], [[Gidwin's Weapon Oil]], and [[Tarenar's Talisman]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 10 samples of Plaguehound Blood.
*[[Plaguehound Blood]] (10)

==Description==
My traveling companion, [[Fiona]], runs a small vendor's shop out of her [[Fiona's Caravan|caravan]]. She and I, along with our friend [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]], are all on our way to [[Light's Hope Chapel]]. I'm sure you can join us, if you like... though Fiona might be a little mad at me.

Fiona always forgets why she's mad if you give her a gift. Kill some of the [[plaguehound]]s north of here, then bring their blood to Fiona at the caravan, down by the river. She'll love it. We'll talk again there. 

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Helm of Thoughtful Gifts|Gentling Bracers|Plaguehound Armbands|Belt of Appeasement|Caravan Sash|Plaguehound Bracers|Cinch of Good Will}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|77|70}}
*2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I should have guessed it. Tarenar made you get me a gift? That thoughtless idiot!

Umm... what was the gift, anyhow?

==Completion==
Why, this is exactly what I needed! Fine, I'll forgive Tarenar for running off.

<Name>, you're welcome to join us anytime.
