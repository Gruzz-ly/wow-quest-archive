==Objectives==
Enter [[Tyr's Hand]] in {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}} and scout out the central cathedral, as well as the [[mage tower]] and [[keep]] inside of [[New Avalon]] before returning to [[Caldoran]] at the [[Scarlet Base Camp]].

A direct incursion is possible but may be dangerous. Speak with [[Inquisitor Jociphine]] at the Scarlet Base Camp if you'd prefer a more subtle approach.
*Scout the Cathedral in Tyr's Hand
*Scout the Mage Tower in New Avalon
*Scout the Keep in New Avalon

==Description==
I am not pleased to engage you for aid. You consort with the [[heretic]] and the unclean and it is beneath me and our sacred order to entertain your presence here. However... you seem adequately capable and will prove to be a useful instrument here for our needs.

Go to Tyr's Hand and scout the cathedral there before moving deeper into New Avalon to scout the rear keep and mage tower. Return here without delay and report what you find. We need to know what we are up against.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||90}}
* 6,600 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your mission? If not, why are you standing here idly speaking with me?

==Completion==
<Caldoran grunts at you curtly when you finish delivering your report.>

The buildup of forces in New Avalon is concerning, but their numbers are not insurmountable.

It also seems that Dathrohan--or should I say, Balnazzar--is consolidating his power at the central Cathedral, and his usage of foul magics to seal the entrance confirms that he is up to something in there. That monster desecrates our holy ground and  I will see him dead by my hand. I swear it upon my life.

==Notes==
Inquisitor Jociphine is next to Caldoran:

{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Caldoran tells me you can help with a more "subtle" approach to get into Tyr's Hand and New Avalon}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Indeed.

I can cast a spell on you for a very short time that will disguise you as a New Avalon citizen. Take care however as not all personnel within the enclave will be fooled by this disguise, and it only lasts a short time. Conduct your business and return.

{{Gossip|Sounds good. I'd like to make use of your illusion.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
It is done. Now go, complete your mission.
}}}}}}
:''The player character receives the Scarlet Illusion.''

Stop by the entrance to the cathedral in Tyr's Hand at {{Co|85.2|83.8|Eastern Plaguelands (Classic)}}, then continue into New Avalon and approach the entrances to its keep {{Co|97.0|83.0|Eastern Plaguelands (Classic)}} and mage tower {{Co|98.5|88.6|Eastern Plaguelands (Classic)}}.

==Progression==
