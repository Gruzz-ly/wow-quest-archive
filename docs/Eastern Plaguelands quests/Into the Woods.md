This quest leads to [[Fiona]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]], who starts the quest line in that zone.

==Objectives==
Find a worgen woman at the [[Thondroril River]] in the [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
I saw the strangest commotion coming through town the other day. A [[horse]]-drawn cart, loaded with crates and chests, a [[worgen]] woman at the reins, a [[Tarenar Sunstrike|blood elf]] by her side, and a [[Gidwin Goldbraids|dwarf paladin]] running behind, yelling some of the most creative obscenities I've heard in quite some time.

They looked like they were heading to Eastern Plaguelands, though I'd imagine they can't be far past the Thondroril River by now. I wonder what they were up to?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||5}}

==Completion==
Yes?

== Notes ==
If you have the quest [[Hero's Call: Eastern Plaguelands!|Hero's Call: Eastern Plaguelands!]] or [[Warchief's Command: Eastern Plaguelands!|Warchief's Command: Eastern Plaguelands!]] in your quest log, you cannot pick up this quest. You may have one or the other, not both. It becomes available when reaching level 39. Like the appropriate capital city hero's call and warchief command board quests, this quest begins the Fiona's Caravan storyline.

This quest is also offered by [[Argent Officer Pureheart]] at [[Chillwind Camp]] for Alliance, and by [[Jearl Donald]] at [[The Bulwark]] for Horde.

==Progression==
{{Eastern Plaguelands storyline}}
