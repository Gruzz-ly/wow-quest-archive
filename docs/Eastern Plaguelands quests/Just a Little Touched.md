==Objectives==
Speak with [[Augustus the Touched]] in [[Terrordale]].

==Description==
I like to check in on Augustus in Terrordale every once in a while, just to make sure he's alright. Some of us [[undead]] cope with the plague better than others, I suppose.

Terrordale is west of here. Would you mind checking in on him for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6}}
*525 [[XP]]
*+13 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Completion==
You've come to the right place, <mister/lady>! No place better than Terrordale, yes siree, that's right! The jewel of [[Lordaeron]]!

==Patch changes==
