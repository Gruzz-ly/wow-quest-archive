==Objectives==
Bring the Skull of Horgus and the Shattered Sword of Marduk to Chromie at Crown Guard Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.
*[[Skull of Horgus]]
*[[Shattered Sword of Marduk]]

==Description==
The [[Annals of Darrowshire]] tells of the villains of that battle. It tells how the ghoul lord [[Horgus the Ravager]] was destroyed by Alliance forces during the battle. He was slain among the foothills north of here, and his skull remains there.

[[Marduk the Black]] was never defeated, but his fabled sword now rusts, ownerless. It can be found near the road to our southeast.

Retrieve these items, <name>. I know not why, but I am certain their fate lies with you. 

==Progress==
Did you find the skull and the sword, <name>?

==Completion==
You found them! Well done, <name>! These relics hold within them the memories of the [[Scourge]] forces at Darrowshire. We will need these if we are to save your [[Joseph Redpath]].

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Seeker's Britches|Vest of Discovery|Chromie's Mirror|Cowl of Revision}}

You will also receive: {{cost||55}}

== Notes ==
Ghosts surround the Sword of Marduk.  Picking up the sword causes the ghosts to vanish.

The skull, too, is surrounded by ghosts.  These ghosts are fighting one another.  Some of the things they say:
:{{text|say|Spectral Betrayer|Your soul is doomed!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Defender|Fight for your families!  Don't give up!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Betrayer|Hail the Lich King!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Defender|Fight!  Fight for Darrowshire!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Defender|If we fall, then Darrowshire is doomed!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Betrayer|Join us, or fall forever!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Defender|Our captain has fallen!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Betrayer|Scourge will prevail!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Defender|We must not give up!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Defender|The [[Alliance]] has abandoned us!}}
:{{text|say|Spectral Defender|Where is the [[Silver Hand]]?  We need their help!}}
Again, collecting the skull dispels the ghosts.
