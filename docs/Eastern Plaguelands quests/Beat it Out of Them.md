==Objectives==
Beat down at least 6 Scourge Siege Engineers to discover details about Gidwin's location and his captor.
*[[Scourge Siege Engineer]] beaten (6)
*Discover Gidwin's location
*Discover Gidwin's captor

==Description==
We paladins are normally taught to exercise judgment and control when dealing with foes, but this is an emergency, and I never paid too much attention to my trainers anyhow.

I'm going to head into the [[Plaguewood]] and find out what I can about [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Giddy]]. You deal with the [[Scourge]] just to our northeast, on the other side of this tower. The undead don't fear death, but if you beat them enough, their tongues might slip, and we may get some clues to Gidwin's location.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
I wish I could join you, but I'm not much for fighting. I've protected Gidwin as much as I could... he needs you to protect him now, <name>.

==Completion==
It sounds like you were successful. Hopefully this is enough information to find Gidwin.

== Notes ==
