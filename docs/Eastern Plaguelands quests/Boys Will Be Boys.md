==Objectives==
Find [[Gidwin Goldbraids]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
As soon as we arrived here at [[Light's Shield Tower]], those two lunkhead paladins ran off to [[Light's Hope Chapel]]. It's still a ways away, but if we're going to follow [[Argus Highbeacon|Argus]] along his tour of the towers, this is about as close as we're going to get.

Check in on them and make sure they're alright? I know they can handle themselves, but still, it'd make me feel better to know that you were watching over them while I'm stuck here with the [[Fiona's Caravan|caravan]]. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

==Completion==
I can't believe it. We're literally FEET away from becoming sworn members of the [[Argent Crusade]].

We'd be in there already if it weren't for [[Tarenar Sunstrike|Tarenar's]] dallying. If he doesn't quit chatting with the locals soon, I'm going to head in there myself.

==Notes==
Head to the chapel and find the pair by the statue. Tarenar is speaking with an [[Argent Sentry]].

:{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Come on already!  Let's go!}}
:{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Can we go yet, Tarenar?  I want to join the Crusade!}}
