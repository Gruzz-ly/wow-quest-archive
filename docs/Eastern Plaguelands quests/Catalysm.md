==Objectives==
Use Betina's Flasks on living elementals within [[Lake Mereldar]] to obtain 8 Active Liquid Plague Agents.

*[[Active Liquid Plague Agent]] (8)
*[[Betina's Flasks]] ''(provided)''

==Description==
Coagulated rot is potent on its own, but we need something to activate its concealed powers... a catalyst. You can find just such a catalyst to the south, in [[Lake Mereldar]].

If you look down, you'll notice that I slipped a set of flasks into your bags while you weren't looking. These flasks can be used on the water elementals in the [[Lake Mereldar|lake]]. The living, corrupted water that flows through their bodies will be the perfect catalyst!

==Progress==
We're nearly ready to strike, <name>.

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Betinabigglezink.jpg|Betina Bigglezink|Uh oh... it looks like we made the solution too strong.}}
Uh oh... it looks like we may have gathered a little too much coagulated rot. Oh well, we'll just have to improvise, then!

What could possibly go wrong?

== Notes ==
Use [[Betina's Flasks]] on a '''''living''''' Plague Ravager in the lake - you can't collect the Plague Agent from a dead one.
