'''Annals of the Silver Hand''' is a repeatable quest, offered by [[Raymond George|Lord Raymond George]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]], which requires the player to enter [[Stratholme]] and retrieve a book from the Scarlet enclave. Each turn-in rewards 2000 reputation with the [[Argent Dawn]] faction.

==Objectives==
Recover a lost volume of the Annals of the Silver Hand from Stratholme.
*[[Annals of the Silver Hand]]

==Description==
Do you know who the [[Knights of the Silver Hand]] were? They were the original paladins of the Light, and from their ranks came knights who would later join the [[Argent Dawn]] or the [[Scarlet Crusade]]. Though many have gone astray, they still possess valuable relics of the Silver Hand.

Deep in Stratholme, under the watchful eye of [[Instructor Galford]], volumes of the Annals of the Silver Hand survive. Any volumes you could recover would be a fitting addition to the rededicated Light's Hope Chapel, don't you think?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2000 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered any of the lost histories of the Silver Hand?

==Completion==
This is indeed one of the lost volumes! [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus|Tyrosus]] will be most pleased when he learns of your find.

==Notes==
Since the fall of the Lich King, the [[Argent Crusade]] has replaced the Argent Dawn in the Plaguelands of Lordaeron. So that players can continue to grind rep with the Argent Dawn, [[Raymond George]] offers this repeatable quest along with the repeatable [[Aberrations of Bone]].

Players must begin the long quest chain with [[Fiona]] by the [[Thondroril River]] in the Eastern Plaguelands. After completing [[Argent Call: The Noxious Glade]], Lord Raymond will offer the repeatable quests.

If selecting specific dungeons in the Dungeon Finder, this quest is completed in the Main Gate instance, not the Service Entrance instance. 

[[Instructor Galford]] and the book are located in the Scarlet Bastion, in the small room opposite [[Balnazzar]]. {{coords|27|75|Stratholme}}

The book may be looted multiple times without having to reset the instance, making this quest a very fast way to gain Argent Dawn rep. Simply turn in and re-take the quest, then run back through the cleared instance. It also helps to kill [[Balnazzar (tactics)|Balnazzar]] on the first run through, as Argent Crusaders will spawn after his death and keep most of the remaning mobs busy.
