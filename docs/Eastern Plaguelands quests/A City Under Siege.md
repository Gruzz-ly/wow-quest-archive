==Objectives==
Speak to [[Packmaster Stonebruiser]].

==Description==
We will never control the [[Eastern Plaguelands]] if we do not control [[Stratholme]]. Not only is it a point of incredible strategic importance, it also houses our enemies' leaders - [[Balnazzar]] and [[Lord Aurius Rivendare]]. Their Risen and Scourge armies threaten to erase all the progress we've made.

The [[Argent Crusade]] is well-suited to this task. Travel west through Stratholme's main gate and speak with [[Packmaster Stonebruiser]]. He will direct you further.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

==Completion==
What a relief it is to see an able-bodied soldier that's on our side! There's plenty for ye to do around here, <race>.
