==Objectives==
Go to a summoning circle and kill a Shadow of Doom, then return to [[Commander Thomas Helleran]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] in {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}}.
*[[Shadow of Doom]] slain

==Description==
After you bring down the defenses of the [[Scourge]] summoning circles that have appeared in the zones under attack, you will be able to confront the [[acolyte]]s who protect them.

In truth, these are not men. They are [[Shade|shadows]], some of the [[Lich King]]'s most frightening creatures. They can be revealed using the necrotic runes they carry, and then destroyed with magic or strength of arms.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Blessed Wizard Oil]] x5
*[[Consecrated Sharpening Stone]] x5
*[[Weighted Consecrated Sharpening Stone]] x5

You will also receive:
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
Have you had any luck, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. With the shadows destroyed, it can only be a matter of time before the Lich King decides to recall his necropolises and leave us in peace.

==Patch changes==
