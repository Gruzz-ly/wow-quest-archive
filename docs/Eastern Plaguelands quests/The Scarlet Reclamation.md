==Objectives==
Return to [[Commander Beatrix]] at the [[Scarlet Base Camp]] west of [[Tyr's Hand]].

==Description==
<[[Leonid Barthalomew the Revered|Leonid]]'s expression darkens when you confirm that [[Caldoran]] is present at the Scarlet Base Camp. After a moment, he regains his composure.>

Thank... thank you, <name>. For now, continue to assist Beatrix if you are willing. I will confer with [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus|Lord Tyrosus]] and develop contingencies should the [[Argent Dawn]] need to become directly involved. I pray that the situation is not as dire as we've been led to believe but if we need to step in and put an end to this, we will be ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45|}}
*3,300 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
So you will aid us? I confess I am relieved. I've seen you and your allies' capabilities first hand and I'm pleased to have you on our side in this. I had hoped the Argent Dawn would lend their aid directly, but I am grateful to have your assistance none the less.

Speak with Inquisitor Caldoran on the hill nearby. He can get you started.
