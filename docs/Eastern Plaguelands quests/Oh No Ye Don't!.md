==Objectives==
Orthas needs you to recover his missing armor from the corpse of an [[Abomination]] somewhere in [[Plaguewood]].
*[[Partially-Digested Plate Armor]]
*[[Orthas' Favorite Gold Tooth]] (provided)

==Description==
Great job with the hammer, [[paladin]]. Next up is me armor. Definitely need that back to move on to the great beyond.

Only problem is it's in the eh... innards o' one of them 'bominations. I know, I know, it's askin' a lot, but ye gotta understand I was once a mighty thane under the mountain. I simply can't move on knowin' that the ancestral armor of me clan is dissolving in the gutjuice of a giant rotting mountain o' meat!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5650 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*+100 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Whadda want?

==Completion==
Oh that's nice! A little worse for wear but that'll do. We've one last thing needs doin'. I need a wee ritual. Just something tae put me scrambled spirit back together and send me on me way. This last part might be a bit discomfortin' for ye, bein a paladin and all, but trust me, it needs doin'!

At least it probably won't be more unsavory than fishin' around for me britches in abomination soup! Gwahaha!
