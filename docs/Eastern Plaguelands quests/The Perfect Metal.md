==Objectives==
Talk to [[Omarion]] about what comes next.

==Description==
Now that we've got the materials, I need a bit of time to try a few different combinations and test my results. This is delicate work, and I wouldn't want to waste any of the materials that you so graciously brought me by testing too hastily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
I'll be fine here on my own. In the meantime, start thinking about what kind of weapon you want made. If you find yourself suddenly inspired, feel free to return here and let me know.

Oh, and thank you, <name>. As much as I hate to admit it, having something like this to dig into has done me a lot of good. I'm still not sure if I'll ever rejoin the Argent Dawn, but at least I'm not moping around in that cage anymore.

Oh, and take this. It isn't much but its a token of my appreciation.

==Notes==
Master Craftsman Omarion has new gossip after completion:
{{Dialogue|Greetings again, <name>.

{{Gossip|How goes the research?}}

{{Dialogue-child|It goes. I need a bit more time to try different metallurgic combinations, test my results, and evaluate the data. Come back again later.}}
}}

The next quest starts from a quest item dropped by [[Grand Crusader Caldoran]] in the {{sod|Scarlet Enclave}}.
