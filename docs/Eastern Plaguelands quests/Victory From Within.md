==Objectives==
Open the [[Argent Portal]]s in the [[Library_Wing_(Tyr's_Hand)|Library Wing]] and the [[Hall_of_Arms_(Tyr's_Hand)|Hall of Arms]] within the abbey in [[Tyr's Hand]].
*Open portal within Hall of Arms
*Open portal within Library Wing

==Description==
A few of our men didn't make it through portals which were supposed to open inside this very [[Tyr's Hand Abbey|abbey]]. You've already proven your elusiveness and battlehardiness... now I need you to do so again.

The abbey has two wings: a library, and a hall of arms. In each wing, you should find a portal.

Use this keystone on these portals. Doing so should force them open, allowing our remaining shock troopers to take this abbey.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55|}} 
*4,800 [[XP]]
*+325 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
One hundred soldiers is few enough.  Setbacks like this only decrease our chances of success.

==Completion==
The abbey will fall shortly.  We can soon move on, deeper into Tyr's Hand.  

==Notes==
Upon opening the portals, Argent Centurions will appear in the room for a brief time.  They will not, however, aid you in any battles.  The portal in the Hall of Arms is on the ground floor, while the one in the library is in a back room on the upper level.

==Progression==
{{The Brotherhood of Light}}
