==Objectives==
Obtain 8 vials of Crypt Bile from [[nerubian]]s in [[Terrorweb Tunnel]].
*[[Crypt Bile]] (8)

==Description==
You should have seen me fight! I must have killed six of those beasts, when...

Oh wait, you can count the bodies, can't you? OK, fine. I killed four of them, when the fifth one shot me with this web. To make things even worse... when he blasted me with web juice, my mouth was open!

I can't seem to break these webs, and I doubt you'll be able to, either. No, you'll have to get some of the stomach juice from those undead spider-things. That'll do the trick.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||50}}

==Progress==
Oh boy... [[Fiona]] is going to be madder than a wet [[harpy]]. You'd better hurry.

==Completion==
You're back?! Thank the [[Light]]!

Before you throw that acid on me, I need to ask: Are you the <guy/gal> who was here before? Or are you one of those eight-legged cowards? I need to know whether or not I should smack you on my way out.

== Notes ==
'''On completion'''
*''After melting Gidwin Goldbraids out of the cocoon, he smacks you knocking you back!''
