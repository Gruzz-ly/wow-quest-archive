==Objectives==
Find [[Master Craftsman Omarion]].
*[[Ruined Lightforged Blade]] (provided)

==Description==
<[[Master Craftsman Wilhelm|Crafter Wilhem]] seems unable to assist you but he suggested that his former master, a man called Omarion, could. Should you find him, he might know more about this material.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+9,950 [[XP]]
*{{cost|5|97}}
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
<Omarion stares past you blankly.>

==Completion==
I see how it is. No one comes looking for me unless they need something. It's fine, it's fine. I don't need rescuing anyway. I'm content to just die here in this light-forsaken place. Please, just leave me to it.

==Progression==
{{Blades of Light}}
