==Objectives==
Kill any 10 [[Scarlet Crusade]] creatures within [[Tyr's Hand]].
*Tyr's Hand Scarlet Crusader slain (10)

==Description==
We were only given one hundred men to complete this mission, and we're already down by one. Our scout was sent into the enemy stronghold to clear out some of the guards that patrol the area, and to send off a flare so we could enter with a coordinated attack. Our ninety-nine remaining men lie at the ready, waiting for that flare. I need a talented <class> like you to sneak into Tyr's Hand, take out as many of their guards as possible, and then set off that flare.

Are you up to it?  

==Progress==
Our troops lie in wait, prone to being discovered. With only one hundred men, if our attack is not coordinated, we face certain defeat.

Our success rides on your shoulders, hero.

==Completion==
The flare is fully assembled, and the matches lie unused next to the fuse.

The fallen Argent centurion got much closer to setting off this flare than you had guessed.

==Progression==
