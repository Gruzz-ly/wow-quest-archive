==Objectives==
Enter {{C|Stratholme}} and make your way through the gate leading into [[Slaughter Square]] and find [[Leonid Barthalomew the Revered]] there.

==Description==
The city behind us is a haunted place. I spent years here after my original death as a thrall of the [[Lich King]] yet even in my servitude, I maintained some amount of awareness. Countless times, I shambled by the body of [[Liliana Barthalomew|my wife]], frozen forever in the fear she felt when the end came.

Please make your way through gate leading to the area now known as Slaughter Square. I will meet you there when I find my resolve. You will need allies for this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|80}}
*6,600 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
So now you see why I despise [[Caldoran]]. He is a man of hateful zealotry. He was then, and he is now. Caldoran did not accompany [[Arthas]]'s expedition to [[Northrend]], but I dearly wish he had found his end there and this was the end of our history together.
