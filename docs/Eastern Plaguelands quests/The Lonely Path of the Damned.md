==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]]. 

You should stow the {{Sod|Corrupted Ashbringer}} in your bags, or else the members of the [[Argent Dawn]] may react with hostility upon seeing the tainted weapon.

==Description==
<[[The Will of the Ashbringer|The spirit]] standing before you shows no awareness of your presence. After a moment, you realize that Lord Maxwell Tyrosus will want to know what occurred here. You should return to Light's Hope chapel and speak with him.>

<You suspect that the Argent Crusaders may not be too excited to see you carrying the Ashbringer in its current, twisted form. You may want to keep the blade out of sight when you approach.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
<Maxwell Tyrosus sighs heavily as you finish your accounting of events at the monastery.>

It seems that Alexandros was not yet ready to find peace, and so the blade remains tainted.

The thing that truly breaks my heart is that just as you approached, I had a... feeling. It was like my old friend was here with me once again just as I remembered him. It’s foolish, I know, to hope such a thing after all that’s happened.

Go. Take the blade from here. I will not suffer its presence.
