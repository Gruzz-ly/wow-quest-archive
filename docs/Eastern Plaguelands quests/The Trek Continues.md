==Objectives==
Board [[Fiona]]'s Caravan when you are ready to move to the next tower.
*Ride in [[Fiona's Caravan]]

==Description==
I believe the horses are ready. [[Argus Highbeacon]], the gentleman who works with the [[Argent Crusade]], spoke with me earlier. I understand he will be coming with us... that's great! I'll make room for him.

I know that you are busy, so there's no hurry. Whenever you're ready, hop into the caravan, and we will proceed to the next tower.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

==Progress==
Once we get to [[Light's Shield Tower]], the boys can head over to [[Light's Hope Chapel]].  It's close enough that they can walk.

==Completion==
We've enjoyed having you ride with us, <name>. Hopefully, once Gidwin and Tarenar join the Argent Crusade, we can continue to travel together.

== Notes ==
Interact with the caravan:

'''During the caravan ride'''
:''The caravan continues its journey towards Light's Hope Chapel, with Fiona and Argus Highbeacon sitting at the front, Tarenar Sunstrike and the hero sitting at the back and Gidwin Goldbraids sitting on the caravan's roof.''
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|This hardly seems fair!!}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Why do I have to sit up top with all the stuff?!}}
:{{text|say|Fiona|Because you're the bravest, dear.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Because you're short.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Hey! I oughtta bounce one of these trunks off of your head, Tarenar.}}
:{{text|say|Fiona|I know I promised you the front seat, Giddy, but we have an elderly guest. I'm sorry.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Fiona, I must warn you: Gidwin only wants to sit in front because he wants to kiss you.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Oh, shut up you dolt. YOU probably want to kiss her a hundred times.}}
:{{text|yell|Tarenar Sunstrike|Do not!}}
:{{text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Ahem! I, ah, appreciate the ride, Madam Fiona. It's nice to get off my feet for once.}}
:{{text|say|Fiona|Do you normally walk these roads alone?}}
:{{text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Yes, I do, though it was easier when I was younger. These days, I have to be more careful.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|If you don't mind my askin', what do you do that requires walking so much?}}
:{{text|say|Argus Highbeacon|I service the five Argent towers. Mostly repairs and maintenance, and some minor magical work.}}
:{{text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Without proper upkeep, buildings within the plaguelands tend to... waste away.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Noble work.}}
:{{text|say|Argus Highbeacon|I find it satisfying. I enjoy working with my hands.}}
:{{text|say|Argus Highbeacon|By the way, if any of you need anything repaired, let me know. I am at your service.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|So you're part of the Argent Crusade, eh?}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Think you can put in the good word for us? We're looking to join the order.}}
:{{text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Certainly. I don't make it out to Light's Hope very often anymore, but when you arrive, tell [[Maxwell Tyrosus|Max Tyrosus]] that I sent you.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Whoah... he lets you call him Max?}}
:{{text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Ma'am, would you mind dropping me off at Light's Shield Tower, just up ahead? I have to stop here.}}
:{{text|say|Fiona|Of course I'm not just going to drop you off, Master Highbeacon. We'll be happy to wait for you.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|NOOOOOOO! Stopped again!}}
:{{text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Light's Hope isn't far, young paladin. Might I suggest walking?}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Walking, eh...?}}
:''The caravan disembarks at the Light's Shield Tower.''
