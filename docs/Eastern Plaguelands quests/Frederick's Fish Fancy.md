==Description==
I love the sea. Yes, it was I, [[Frederick Calston]], who introduced the sea life to that lake in the southwest. I had hoped to provide the [[Argent Crusade|Crusade]] with a source of fresh food from within the borders of the [[Plaguelands]].

However, some of the fish turned out to be predators, and they now terrorize the other animals. If we're not careful, they will kill them all!

Swim down to the bottom of the scar and save some snails, crabs, and pufferfish before it's too late. 

==Progress==
Did... did you bring the fish?

==Completion==
Hmm... they didn't survive the trip out of the water as well as I had hoped.

Oh well! Seafood salad for Frederick tonight!

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Infectis Scuttler Helm|Infectis Puffer Gloves|Infectis Incher Leggings}}

{{Itembox|You will also receive: {{cost||55}}|Infectis Puffer Sashimi}}

== Notes ==
The puffers, inchers, and crabs are all small critters at the bottom of the lake.  They are being preyed upon by very large fish (Groupers).

Gathering a puffer will give you a 20 second water breathing buff ("Puffer Breath").  You may want to space your gathering of puffers out so that you can extend your time underwater.
