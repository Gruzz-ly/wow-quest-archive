==Objectives==
Find [[Arkonos the Cursed|Arkonos]] and end him.

==Description==
I feel that I've learned so much in so short a time. I don't think anyone could ever truly be ready to face what I intend to face, but I feel as ready as I'll ever be. What say you, <name>? Shall we go and end this fight? I'm not sure where to begin, but I suspect we'll find clues somewhere in the {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}}. We should probably start in areas where the [[Cult of the Damned]] congregates.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6,600 [[XP]]
*{{cost|3|96}}
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*+100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Vengeance is near, I can feel it!

==Completion==
It seems that we've found our quarry, but he seems to be out of our reach. We must discover a way to reach him so that we may strike.

==Notes==
Use [[Dalton's Horn]] to summon [[Squire Cuthbert]] to fight alongside you. This quest will become available once he reaches level 60.

==Progression==
