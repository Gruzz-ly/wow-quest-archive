==Objectives==
Return to [[Carlin Redpath]] at [[Crown Guard Tower]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].
*[[Joseph's Hunting Blade]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm going to play with dolly, but I don't want to play with daddy's sword after all. You'd better keep it.

Even better, can you give it to my uncle Carlin? I'm not sure where he is, but sometimes I hear him crying. It sounds like he's nearby, to the north.

I hope he's not crying for me! <name>, will you find my uncle and tell him I'm alright?

If you find him say I'm waiting for him, and I want to hear the story he used to tell... the one about the [[rabbit]]s and the berry jam! That story's so funny!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 260 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any news of my Pammy?

==Completion==
You've seen Pamela? She's alive?

She's dead? No! Oh, Pamela! Why does your spirit still suffer in this world? Why are you perished, while fortune keeps me alive? In an instant I would switch places with you and wander dead Darrowshire, a ghost and alone!

Ah, but this news cannot change fate. Thank you, <name>. Now my duty, my duty to revenge, burns hot as ever.

Say, what is that sword you have there?
