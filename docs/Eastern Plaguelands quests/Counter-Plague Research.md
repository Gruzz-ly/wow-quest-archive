==Objectives==
Obtain 20 Rotberries, 5 Disembodied Arms, and 1 pile of Flesh Giant Foot Scrapings.
*[[Rotberry]] (20) 
*[[Disembodied Arm]] (5)
*[[Flesh Giant Foot Scrapings]]

==Description==
I once worked for the so-called "Banshee-Queen", [[Sylvanas]], as an apothecary. I used to admire her, but something's changed within her. She's not herself anymore.

I broke my vows with the [[Forsaken]] and joined the [[Argent Crusade|Crusade]]. Now, I use my knowledge of alchemy to seek a counter-plague agent. And the [[Plaguewood]] is the perfect place to do so.

I need to resupply a few reagents, any of which can be found within the Plaguewood. I'll pay you if you can find any of these items. 

==Progress==
You got the stuff?

==Completion==
I love the smell of fresh foot scrapings, don't you?

If we're going to find a cure to the plague, we need to get creative with our ingredients.  Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to get back to work.

==Rewards==

You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Notes==
The flesh giant foot scrapings come from a Flesh Giant Foot to the SE of the tower.  If you complete the other requirements, the location of the foot will be evident.  (Prior to that, the areas where the other items will confuse things.)
