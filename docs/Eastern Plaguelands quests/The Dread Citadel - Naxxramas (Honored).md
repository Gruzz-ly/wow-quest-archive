'''The Dread Citadel - Naxxramas''' is one of three quests that unlock access to secrets within [[Naxxramas]]. Players must have first unlocked access to [[Scholomance (Classic)|original Scholomance]] by earning the [[Memory of Scholomance]] achievement, then worked through the [[Wards of the Dread Citadel]] achievement steps including a timed run through [[Stratholme]] with a repaired [[Argent Dawn Commission]]. Alternate versions of this quest are available at other ranks with the [[Argent Dawn]], listed in the [[#Progression|progression section]].

==Objectives==
[[Archmage Angela Dosantos]] in the [[Eastern Plaguelands]] wants 5 Arcane Crystals, 6 Large Brilliant Shards, 1 Righteous Orb and 60 gold pieces. You must also be Honored with the [[Argent Dawn]].
* [[Arcane Crystal]] (5)
* [[Large Brilliant Shard]] (6)
* [[Righteous Orb]]
* Argent Dawn ({{text|honored|Honored}})
* Required money: {{cost|60}}

==Description==
Long ago, magical wards placed upon [[Naxxramas]] stymied our attempts to assault [[Kel'Thuzad]]'s forces. Though I was able to conceal our army past them, I have since learned to dispel them should the need ever arise.

I will confess my disbelief of your story. However, if you are so devoted to this investigation, I will enchant your insignia so you may breach these barriers yourself. For a price.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Empower Commission|Unlocks the ability to discover ancient secrets and acquire Corruptor's Scourgestones within Naxxramas for all characters on your account. The Argent Dawn Commission is no longer needed to loot scourgestones.|id=413424|icon=inv_jewelry_talisman_12}}

You will also receive:
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
* [[Wards of the Dread Citadel]]

==Progress==
Have you brought the necessary reagents?

==Completion==
You will feel a slight tingle, <name>. That sensation means it's working. Once complete, you should be able to see whatever it is you believe you will find.

==Progression==
{{Scourgestones}}
