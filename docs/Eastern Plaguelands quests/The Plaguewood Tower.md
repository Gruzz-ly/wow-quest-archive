==Objectives==
Bring Highbeacon's Parcel to [[Argent Apothecary Judkins]] at [[Plaguewood Tower]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].
*[[Highbeacon's Parcel]] (provided)

==Description==
With the recent, unfortunate developments involving [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]], it might not be wise for a man my age to take the dangerous trip through the [[Plaguewood]]. This is fine - I can visit the Plaguewood Tower on my next trip around the loop.

I do, however, have a delivery that I need to get to Judkins. You are younger than I, and stronger in combat. Will you take this delivery to him?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

==Progress==
Highbeacon's Parcel... is [[Argus Highbeacon|Argus]] safe?  Did something happen?

==Completion==
Whew.  Every time Argus comes plodding through that Plaguewood, I fear it to be his last.  It's good to see that he's wise enough to send a youngblood like you in his stead. 

==Progression==
