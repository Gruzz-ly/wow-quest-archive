==Objectives==
Combine the Reforged Blade of the Ashbringer, the Emblem of the Ashbringer, and the Hilt of the Ashbringer, and then speak with [[the Will of the Ashbringer]] to determine your next steps.
*[[Inert Ashbringer]]
*[[Emblem of the Ashbringer]] (provided)

==Description==
Here is the emblem. I warn you, do not touch it with your bare hand. It exudes a foul [[necromantic]] aura that could cause great harm.

I wish you the best in this endeavor, <name>. I will dare hope for your success, but I will prepare for a less favorable outcome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
The pieces are falling into place. The weapon is completely inert now, but there’s one final step needed to restore the blade’s lost power. This next part won’t require strength of arms, but it may still prove difficult.

Tell me, <class>, what do you know of [[Nordrassil]], the [[World Tree]]?

==Progression==
