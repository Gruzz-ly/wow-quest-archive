==Objectives==
Board [[Fiona]]'s Caravan at the [[Thondroril River]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].
*Ride [[Fiona's Caravan]]

==Description==
Now that the boys are back, we can head out. You headed east?

Please, join us! I insist! Yesterday, we were in the [[Menders' Stead]], and I was telling [[Tarenar Sunstrike|Tarenar]], "We have two paladins and a shopkeeper, but you know what we really need? A <class>!"

Don't look at me that way! I'm serious! Come on, hop in the cart.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

==Completion==
Hope the ride wasn't too bumpy for you.

Have a look around the tower while the horses rest. It's no Light's Hope Chapel, but I'm sure you can find some way to keep yourself busy.

== Notes ==
'''On accepting the quest'''
:{{text|say|Fiona|By the way, you're welcome to borrow any supplies you find inside the caravan... as long as you bring them back when you're done!}}

[[Fiona's Lucky Charm]], [[Gidwin's Weapon Oil]], and [[Tarenar's Talisman]] become available.

Click on the caravan wagon...
:{{gossip|Ride Fiona's Caravan to its next destination.}}

'''During the caravan ride'''
:''The caravan begins its journey towards Light's Hope Chapel, with Fiona and Tarenar Sunstrike sitting at the front, and Gidwin Goldbraids and the hero sitting at the back.''
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Shotgun!}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Hey now! Why do you get to sit in front?}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Because I won our bet. And because I called shotgun.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Who says you won the bet? We haven't compared tallies yet.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Fine. I killed five zombies. And they were huge. How many undead did you kill?}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|I'm pretty sure I killed six.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|I'm going to bet that you only killed four.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|H... how did you know that?}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|I didn't. You just told me!}}
:''Fiona laughs.''
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|So seriously, how did your undead hunting go? I want to hear stories.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Gidwin? Are you ignoring me?}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Giddy... you're mad at me, aren't you?}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Remember when we were kids, Gidwin? We would spend all day pretending to fight the trolls, or the murlocs, or the girls.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Don't do this, Tarenar.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|We had a name we called ourselves... what was it?}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|You remember damn well enough what it was.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|I'm dead serious. I've completely forgotten.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|<Sigh>... "The Paladin Pals".}}
:''Fiona laughs.''
:{{text|say|Fiona|Gidwin, you can sit in front with me next time.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Maybe now I don't want to. Maybe I like it better sitting back here with my new friend. It smells like horses up there.}}
:{{text|say|Fiona|There's a tower coming up on our left. What do you say we stop and rest a bit?}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|We just rested a few minutes ago! Let's just go to Light's Hope Chapel!}}
:{{text|say|Fiona|The roads here are rough, Gidwin. I don't want to risk losing a horse.}}
:{{text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|We won't lose a horse. Look at them! They look exactly like they did when we started.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Actually, I agree with Fiona.}}
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|The [[Argent Crusade]] can wait for us a little while longer. Besides... our guest may want to get off the caravan soon.}}
:{{text|say|Fiona|Here we are!}}
:''The caravan disembarks at the Crown Guard Tower.''

Afterward, Gidwin paces in front of the tower:
:{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Alright, Gidwin... deep breaths...}}
:{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|What's the holdup, Fiona?}}
:{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|I can't BELIEVE that we're stopping!  We've got a duty to do here!}}
:{{Text|say|Gidwin Goldbraids|Why haven't we left yet?  I'm ready to head off on my own if we don't get going.}}
