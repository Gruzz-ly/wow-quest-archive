Kill [[Rohan the Assassin]] within the abbey bell tower in [[Tyr's Hand]].
*Rohan the Assassin slain

==Description==
The fate of the [[Scarlet Crusade]] is tragic, if somewhat ironic. At one point, they led the charge of humanity against the undead. Now, they resemble those corpses that they once hunted. What caused their descent into undeath isn't certain, but it doesn't make them any less dangerous.

One of their deadliest was an assassin who went by the name of Rohan. We have intel that places him atop the bell tower in this very abbey. Find him and kill him, <name>. And try not to die on the way.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dawnbringer Legguards
|Rohan's Mask
|Emissary's Watch
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
Fight well, <name>.

==Completion==
The death of Rohan eases my spirits a bit.

I once fought beside him, you know. He was an emissary of the Scarlet Crusade; one of the few that deigned to joined us in our battle against [[Kel'thuzad]], so many years ago. How quickly things change.

==Notes==
Look carefully, because Rohan stealths behind the large platform.
