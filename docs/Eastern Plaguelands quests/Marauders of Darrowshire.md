==Objectives==
Bring 5 Resonating Skulls to [[Chromie]] at [[Crown Guard Tower]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].
*[[Resonating Skull]] (5)
*[[Mystic Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
I require a rare reagent for the powerful spell I intend to cast: skulls from the scourge who took part in the [[battle of Darrowshire]].

Take this crystal and hunt [[scourge]] champions for their skulls. The crystal is enchanted; if a champion took part in the battle, then when you pass the crystal over its skull it will resonate. Bring me those resonating skulls.

Go, <name>. You'll find scourge champions in the [[Fungal Vale]] to the north. Go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the skulls? They are critical for my spell, which will give us the chance to save [[Darrowshire]]. Maybe.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. Are you certain you haven't done this before?

==Progression==
{{Rewriting the Battle of Darrowshire}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing [[Marauders of Darrowshire (Classic)|previous version]].}}
