==Objectives==
Pass [[Vex'tul]]'s test of strength.
*[[Mossflayer Rogue]] slain (3)

==Description==
My name is Vex'tul, and I have watched you fight, <race>. You are strong.

You killed my master, [[Zaeldarr]], but this does not bother me. I value strength over any loyalty that I held for him. I value strength over anything else.

Prove to me one final time your strength, <race>. Do so, and I will lend you MY strength for whatever purpose you may desire. 

==Progress==
Honor means nothing. Strength is everything.

==Completion==
Yes, you are indeed strong... and I submit to you.

I will join you and your friend, [[Fiona|the worgen]]. My strength is yours.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Notes ==
On accepting the quest, 3 Mossflayer rogues appear and attack you automatically.  Be prepared.
