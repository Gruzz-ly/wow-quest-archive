==Objectives==
Enter the {{Sod|Scarlet Enclave}} via the mountain path and engage the [[Tyr's Hand]] defenders. Ring the bell inside of the abbey to create confusion and signal [[Beatrix]]'s forces to attack. 

Once the bell is rung, confront {{Sod|Balnazzar}} and destroy him.

==Description==
Our forces are mustered and we will move into positions to begin the forward attack while your forces sneak around to the rear of the cathedral using the mountain path.

Once inside make your way to the abbey and ring the bell to signal the attack.

You'll be in the thickest of the fighting until we arrive to relieve you, so take care.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70}}
*9,950 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
This was very nearly a complete disaster...

==Completion==
We have been betrayed! After Balnazzar fell, Beatrix assumed control of the leaderless defenders and immediately turned her newly bolstered forces on us! Casualties were heavy but we hit back hard and were able to fall back and regroup. We feared the worst for your force until our [[scout]]s reported you were here.

I don't know what Beatrix and [[Caldoran]] are playing at, but at this point I'm ready to put down anyone I see wearing red and leave the the{{sic}} light to sort them out.

==Progression==
{{The Scarlet Reclamation}}
