Quickly - find an entrance to the slaughterhouse to our south. I will meet you on the inside.

Be ready for a fight!

==Progress==
Wh... what happened?

==Completion==
You have no idea how happy I am to see you two! You're a sight for sore eyes... sore eyes that have been starin' through a [[banshee]] for far too long now.

I'm sorry for causing so much trouble. Will you take me back to the caravan?

'''Upon entering the Slaughterhouse'''
:''The camera zooms inside the slaughterhouse, showing Gidwin Goldbraids tied to a table with Baroness Anastari looking over him.''
