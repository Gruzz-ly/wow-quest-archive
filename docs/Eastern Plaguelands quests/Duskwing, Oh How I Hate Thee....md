==Objectives==
Obtain a Patch of Duskwing's Fur.
* [[Patch of Duskwing's Fur]]
* [[The Corpseburner's Flare]] (provided)

==Description==
I have seen many things in my day, <race>. The peaks of [[Mount Hyjal|Mt. Hyjal]]... the oddities of [[Outland]]... a wall of [[Scourge]] [[soldier]]s, proceeding into war. But I have never seen a [[bat]] as big, or as shockingly white, as [[Duskwing]].

How he taunts me from his roost!

This albino [[demon]] bat circles to the southwest of here, due north of [[Blackwood Lake]]. Track him down and destroy him. If he flies too high for you to reach, use my flare to get his attention.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Duskwing Handwraps
|Duskwing Boots
|Corpseburner's Mantle

You will also receive:

*5290 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope you've done away with that creature.

==Completion==
Excellent work.  I can now continue my work without the distractions of that great white beast.

I shall fashion this fur into something you can use.
