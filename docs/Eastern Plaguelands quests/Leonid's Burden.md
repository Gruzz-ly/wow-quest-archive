==Objectives==
Receive instructions from [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus]].

==Description==
I could not help but overhear your conversation with [[Leonid Barthalomew|Leonid]] about [[Baelin Caldoran|Inquisitor Caldoran]]. The scant details Leonid provided to you are the barest sliver of the history they share and the suffering Caldoran has inflicted on him. I was there when Leonid was at his lowest point and I helped him find the strength to pick himself back up.

I fear what our continued cooperation with the [[Scarlet Crusade]] will do to Leonid, particularly if it brings him closer to that man.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||23}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'll keep my good eye on things here, and you keep an eye firmly fixed on Caldoran while you are working with the [[Scarlet Reclamation|reclamation forces]]. I do not trust any of our "allies" and I trust him least of all.

Speak with Leonid again. I have a mission that I've asked him to undertake and I'd like for you to accompany him. I think it would do him some good to have a distraction away from here.
