While not part of the [[Rewriting the Battle of Darrowshire quest chain]], the quest [[Cenarion Tenacity]] is made available after completing this quest.

==Objectives==
Bring Joseph's Hunting Blade to [[Chromie]].
*[[Joseph's Hunting Blade]] (provided)

==Description==
That sword belonged to [[Joseph Redpath]], Pamela's father - though you probably already knew that. I wish Joseph could again be with his [[Pamela Redpath|daughter]], but it cannot be so. His soul was twisted by the [[Scourge]], and he became a monster.

Pamela's fate is sealed, but perhaps we can change Joseph's fate.

A strange gnome arrived here at this tower not long ago. Her name is Chromie. Take that sword to her. I have a feeling she will be able to help us. 

==Progress==
There is something timely about your visit. You're not from the future, are you?

==Completion==
What is this? A warsword? A butter knife? I'm useless when it comes to blades. Let me see...

Ah! This sword was once in the hand of a great man, but there is much tragedy in that man's past.

Are you here to help him? It's far too late for him now... but perhaps we can help him in the past!
