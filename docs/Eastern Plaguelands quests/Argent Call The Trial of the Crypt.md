==Objectives==
Enter the Crypt behind Light's Hope Chapel, read from the Argent Scroll, then complete his test.
*[[Argent Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
Behind our chapel, you will find a small crypt. Interred within are the bodies of our fallen heroes; those who gave their lives in the war against the [[Scourge]].

Their spirits are at peace, but they return intermittently to test new members of the order.

The three of you may test together. Enter the crypt, then read from this scroll. [[Lord Raymond George]] - my predecessor - will preside over your test. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|15}}

==Progress==
Your test is not yet complete.

==Completion==
Remember that your ancestors always watch over you. As a <brother/sister> of the [[Argent Crusade]], you will join a family that has a long line of such fallen ancestors. Their vigil and protection will be your strength as you press forward against the Scourge.

Congratulations [[Tarenar Sunstrike|Tarenar]], [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]], and <name>. Welcome to the Argent Crusade.

== Notes ==
Gidwin and Tarenar will occasionally cast [[Blessing of Might]] and [[Blessing of Kings]] upon you.  You will also be affected by their [[Retribution Aura]].
