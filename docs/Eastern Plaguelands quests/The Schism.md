==Objectives==
Speak with Beatrix to learn more about the situation in the {{Sod|Scarlet Enclave}} at [[Tyr's Hand]] and report back to [[Leonid Barthalomew the Revered]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] once you've learned more about what is happening.
* Speak with [[Commander Beatrix|Beatrix]]

==Description==
I'll cut straight to the chase; the Tyr's Hand enclave is no longer under our control. While we were away at {{Sod|Naxxramas}}, a force of [[Crimson legion|hostile crusaders]] came in from the city of [[Stratholme]] and took control of the stronghold. We've been barred entry and any [[Ambassador|emissaries]] we send in do not return.

I am loathe to ask for external assistance, but something is very wrong and I don't know if we can reclaim the enclave alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45}}
*3,300 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
What have you learned?

==Completion==
The developments at Tyr's Hand are... certainly interesting. [[Brigitte Abbendis|Abbendis]] likely dead, [[Balnazzar]] returned. While there is part of me that would prefer to sit back and watch the [[Scarlet Crusade]] reap what they have sown, I feel that no matter the outcome the [[Argent Dawn]] would likely be drawn into conflict. Weakened as we are following the [[Naxxramas]] campaign, [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus|Lord Tyrosus]] would prefer our involvement come on our terms rather than having our hand forced.

Also... did you say that [[Baelin Caldoran|Inquisitor Caldoran]] was there?

==Notes==
Speak with Beatrix again:
{{Dialogue|
Tyr's hand{{sic}} must be reclaimed at any cost.

{{Gossip|What do you know so far?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Not as much as I'd like, I am afraid. We had one of our [[scout]]s sneak into Tyr's Hand to get an idea of what was going on. He returned to us nearly a day later, sporting heavy wounds and near death. Before he passed he told us that he had seen none other than [[Saidan Dathrohan]] inside the Cathedral, apparently in command. My counterpart, High General Abbendis, was nowhere to be seen. I fear the worst for her...

{{Gossip|Dathrohan? Commander, I'm not sure how to tell you this but that isn't the Grand Crusader...}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Oh I am well aware of Balnazzar's grand deception. It is a mark of shame that the crusade will bear for a lifetime. Whatever game the dreadlord is playing at, it can't be good for us or Light's Hope chapel. We need to retake Tyr's Hand and put an end to Balnazzar once and for all.

{{Gossip|Very well, I will report back to Light's Hope Chapel now, but when I return I will do my best to assist.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Thank you, <class>. I know that you may not approve of the Scarlet Crusade's methods, but our cause is righteous and our aims are pure. I hope that once this is over, we may begin work on a lasting peace in the [[Plaguelands]] and can realize our shared goal to crush the [[scourge]] in this region.
