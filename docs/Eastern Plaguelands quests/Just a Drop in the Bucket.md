==Objectives==
Use your Death Cultist Disguise to enter the [[Death Cultist Base Camp]], then put [[Betina Bigglezink|Betina's]] mixture into the Mereldar Plague Cauldron.
*Disturb [[Mereldar Plague Cauldron]]
*[[Death Cultist Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
Now, mix a tiny amount of rot into the water, and mix thoroughly. There, that's it. This solution will still be very powerful, and we only need a little bit of it.

On the lake's southeastern border, you will find a plague cauldron with several cultists nearby. Put on your cultist disguise, then approach the cauldron and put in ONE DROP of the solution you made. No more, or you may risk your very life!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Light's Shield
|Breastplate of the Droplet
|Plaguefix Launcher
|Cauldron Cracker
|Cauldron Dredger
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
The [[Cult of the Damned]] still brews plague nearby! Destroy them!

==Completion==
It should take them weeks to get their operation running again. Thank you, <name>.

== Notes ==
Once you use the disguise, you can interact with the cauldron.  You get three options:
{{book|Mereldar Plague Cauldron|content=
The cauldron bubbles violently.

{{Gossip|Put in a drop of liquid, as Betina requested.}}<br>
{{Gossip|Throw in an entire flask.}}<br>
{{Gossip|Throw in all 12 flasks.}}
}}

If you put in a single drop, you get "nothing visible happens", and the option to:  do nothing, put in a full vial, or put in all 12 vials.

Putting in a single vial causes an explosion that knocks you down.  Putting in all twelve vials causes a big explosion that will knock you back (and possibly cause you falling damage).
