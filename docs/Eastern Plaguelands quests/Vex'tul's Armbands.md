==Completion==
Vex'tul has left some of his wrappings within the caravan.  Surprisingly, he was courteous enough to keep them folded and separate from everyone else's belongings.

Vex'tul values strength over everything else.  Leaning in close, you can sense some of his residual strength emanating from within these armbands.

==Rewards==
The following spell will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Vex'tul's Armbands|Grants a chance to knock enemies a short distance in the air on successful attacks.|id=85616|icon=inv_bracer_08}}

==Notes==
This quest becomes available once you complete the quest [[A Gift For Fiona]] and {{NPC||Vex'tul}} joins the caravan.
