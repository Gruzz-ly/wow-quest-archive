==Objectives==
Scout out the [[Scarlet Base Camp]] west of [[Tyr's Hand]] in {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}} and try to discern what is happening with the [[Scarlet Crusade]] forces there.

==Description==
There's been an interesting development, <name>. It seems that while the Scarlet Crusade's focus was aimed at [[Naxxramas]], there's been some sort of unrest in the ranks at Tyr's Hand. Details are spotty for now, but from what we understand, there has been some infighting amongst the crusaders.

I'd like to send you to the camp west of Tyr's Hand to assess the situation out for us. Let us know what you find as soon as possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||90}}
*6,600 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
Greetings, <name>. I'm glad to see you again. I do wish it were under better circumstances, however.

==Progression==
{{The Scarlet Reclamation}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.7|note=Added.}}
