==Objectives==
Hear the final part of [[Leonid Barthalomew|Leonid]]'s story.

==Description==
When my meandering brought me here you can imagine my surprise to find [[Percival Barthalomew|my son]] alive and well. He did not reject me as the other living did, he embraced me. He had become a healer, and was studying the undead. He was convinced that he could find a cure to not only prevent undeath, but reverse it. 

For a short time, we were together and happy. I helped my son with his research, and he gave me the hope I needed.

That is, until [[Baelin Caldoran]] rode back into our lives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||45|}}
* 3,300 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Thorium Brotherhood]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Much to my shame, I survived. Not long after this Lord Tyrosus found me and patched me up.

Not once, but twice was Baelin Caldoran responsible for the death of someone dear to me. His brand of arrogant bigotry is the very heart of the corruption that plagues the Scarlet Crusade. 

While I'll never recover from the pain, I still honor my son by sharing his hope and vision for a future where the curse of undeath can be cured. I have to hope that someday, someone will be able to finish my son's work.
