==Objectives==
Slay 13 Plaguebats along the path to [[Light's Shield Tower]].
*[[Plaguebat]] slain (13)

==Description==
The [[Argent Crusade]] built these towers to be points of light in the darkness of the Plaguelands. I walk the paths between these towers, protecting and maintaining them.

The roads have been dangerous lately. Plagued wildlife runs rampant, and bats swoop down upon unsuspecting travelers. It would make the next leg of my journey much easier if you could clear some of this wildlife out of the way for me.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Treads of Youth|Crown Guard Armbands|Plaguebat Vest|Slippers of the Lonely Road}}

You will also receive: {{cost|1|10}}

==Progress==
The road I walk is lonely, but I do so for duty.

==Completion==
Of course a young <race> like you would have no trouble taking care of a few wild animals. With the roads clear, my journey to the next tower will be much easier.

==Progression==
