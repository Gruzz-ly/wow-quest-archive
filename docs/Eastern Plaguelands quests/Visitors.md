'''Visitors''' is a level 39 bread crumb quest that navigates the players to the start of the zone's questlines.

==Objectives==
Find a [[worgen]] woman at the [[Thondroril River]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
My sources at the [[Menders' Stead]] have informed me that we will be having some visitors soon. A group of paladins - led by a worgen tradeswoman, of all things - will be arriving here shortly. I look forward to meeting them. Particularly one of them.

Would you mind stopping in and checking in on them? I can't say for sure, but by the time you get there, they should just be crossing the Thondroril River, far to the west.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5}}
*435 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yes?

==Progression==
{{Eastern Plaguelands storyline}}

==Patch changes==
