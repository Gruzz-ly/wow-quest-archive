'''Scarlet Activities''' becomes available after completing [[The Dread Citadel - Naxxramas]].

==Objectives==
Travel to the area near the [[Crusader Outpost]] northwest of The [[Bulwark]] in {{C|Tirisfal Glades}} and investigate for signs of recent [[Scarlet Crusade]] activity. Bring any information you recover back to [[Leonid Barthalomew|Leonid Bartholomew the Revered]].
*[[Orders from the High General]]

==Description==
While we play nice with the Scarlet Crusaders here, they continue to behave suspiciously elsewhere. Some of my contacts in Tirisfal tell me of a daring Scarlet Crusade incursion into the heart of the [[Undercity]] itself, and we've received reports from our [[scout]]s of large caravans moving supplies through the [[plaguelands]]. A band of elite scarlet forces has been spotted near the Crusader Outpost in Tirisfal Glades, between the [[Balnir Farmstead]] and [[Venomweb Vale]]. If you would, go and see what you can find there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|80}}
*6600 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*x20 [[Drinkable Stratholme Holy Water]]

==Progress==
How goes your mission, <name>?

==Completion==
I see. So it seems the Crusade abducted someone from the city, and someone important, at that. This is most concerning. Thank you, <name>.  For now, do nothing and speak to no one of this. Our alliance with the Scarlet Crusade is tenuous, but we need all the help we can get to deal with the threat of [[Naxxramas]] at the moment.

I will follow up on this on my own. I may call upon you in the future for more aid in this. Until then, go with the [[light]].

==Notes==
Head back to the Balnir Farmstead and find a small tent overlooking the farm. Interact with the [[Ball and chain]] which spawns a [[Scarlet Infiltrator]]. Kill her to loot [[Orders from the High General]].
