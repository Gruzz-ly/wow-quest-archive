==Objectives==
Use the New Plague Samples on the [[Dark Summoner (Eastern Plaguelands)|Dark Summoners]] and [[Necromancer (mob)|Necromancers]] found throughout {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}} and observe the effects.
*Plague Tested
*[[New Plague Samples]] (provided)

==Description==
To me, there is nothing more low than the living agents of the [[Lich King|lich king]]. I disdain and reject those with the free will to see right from wrong, yet who choose to willingly serve death. Take the plague samples once again and test them on the living [[Cult of the Damned]] members nearby.

Do not pity these monsters nor show them mercy. They've thrown in their lot with the damned, so damned they shall be.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|80}}
*6,600 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
I've been studying these research notes, and what I am seeing is terrifying.

The [[Scarlet Crusade]] developed this plague.

==Completion==
It is exactly as I expect, this plague has similar effects on both the living and the dead. This bodes ill for all, I am afraid. 

The question I have is; how were the Scarlet Crusaders able to develop such a plague? This would require a deep understanding of the original [[plague of undeath]] and research into such plagues is... challenging for the living. This is most troubling.

I suspect we've learned what we can here for now. Before we head back however... could I ask a favor of you?

==Notes==
Attack one Cultist mob, get them to 50%, and use the sample on them.
