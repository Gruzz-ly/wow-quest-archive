Slay Mataus the Wrathcaster.
*[[Mataus the Wrathcaster]] slain

==Description==
One of the more vile members of the [[Scarlet Crusade]], Mataus the Wrathcaster, lurks within the barracks' dungeon. Undeath suits his dark manner.

Were I younger and on the front lines, I'd run him through myself. As things are, I'm left behind to lead our forces from the rear. So I leave the pleasure to you. 

==Progress==
If you don't do it, I might go kill him myself, <name>.

==Completion==
You are well on your way to becoming a true champion of the Light, <name>.  Well done. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

==Notes==
*The entrance to the dungeon is easy to miss. Go the middle of the building to find the stairs going up, then check along the wall to the right, next to rack of spears.
*On aggro:
::{{text|say|Mataus the Wrathcaster|Your pain is my release.}}
*You may find a number of suffering victims on the torture racks nearby.

==Progression==
