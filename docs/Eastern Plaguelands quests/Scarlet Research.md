==Objectives==
Search for the artifact within the [[Scarlet Crusade]] stronghold at [[Tyr's Hand]] in {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}}.

==Description==
A page of the ledger catches your eye:

"Artifact - recovered near [[Sorrow Hill Crypt]]. Strong attunement to [[Light]]. Poor candidate for LW project due to warding properties and resistance to amplification enchantments. Delivered to Tyr's Hand for further study."

==Completion==
Opening the locker, you find a small box. Is this what you were looking for?

==Progression==
{{The Prize Within}}

==Notes==
The "LW project" mentioned in the ledger is likely the artifact weapon [[Light's Wrath]].
