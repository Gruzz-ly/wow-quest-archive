==Objectives==
Defeat Blackmane.
* Ask [[Sean Wilkers]] to open the [[Stratholme (pet battle)|Stratholme service entrance]].
* [[Blackmane]] Defeated.

==Description==
[[Scourge]] activity inside of [[Stratholme]] has increased dramatically in the recent days. The air is thick with the stink of necromancy, and there are screams and shrieks coming from within these walls that will send chills down your spine for weeks to come.

I haven't ventured in there yet myself, but there is definitely some new evil stirring from within. I have the keys to this entrance, and can bring you in there to see for yourself.

Let me know when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Manapoof Link: Stratholme]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* 35,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can open these gates and bring us in, but it will be up to you to get out safely.

==Completion==
They did what to Blackmane!? Who are these people? Infusing a beast with strange necromancy powers certainly sounds like an escalation of events compared to what they have done previously. What can they possibly be doing with all of this stuff they are taking? It sounds like a showdown is imminent.
