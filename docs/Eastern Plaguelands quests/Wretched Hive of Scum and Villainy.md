==Objectives==
Kill 9 [[Wretched]] at [[Quel'lithien Lodge]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].
* Quel'lithien Wretched slain (9)

==Description==
<Race>... please, I ask your help.

Something's happened to my people.  Our commander, {{NPC||Ranger Lord Hawkspear}}, came upon an item of magical energy, and my friends, my family... they succumbed to its seductive power.

They're corrupted, <race>.  All of them.

My [[Ellaria]] wouldn't want to live like that, nor would any of my brothers.  Please, put them out of their misery.  Quel'lithien Lodge is not far; it's just up the hill, to the northwest.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
You have no idea how difficult it was for me to pull myself away, <name>.  I nearly ended up one of them.

==Completion==
Do not feel sorry for me.  Those were my friends that you saw at Quel'lithien Lodge, but they were already as good as dead.

==Notes==
Killing [[Wretched Ranger]]s, [[Wretched Pathstrider]]s, and [[Wretched Woodsman]] all count towards the quest.

The quest name refers to {{wplink|Obi-Wan Kenobi}}'s description of {{wplink|Mos Eisley}} spaceport in ''{{wplink|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope}}''.
