==Objectives==
Kil Ix'lar the Underlord and 10 of his minions.
*[[Ix'lar the Underlord]] slain
*Ix'lar's minion slain (10)

==Description==
I know we're supposed to head to [[Northdale]], but that can wait, right? Besides, this lovely little [[goblin]] was just telling me about some [[Scourge]] that are even closer by.

So apparently there's this [[nerubian]] underlord named Ix'lar that has been trying to make a name for himself ever since the [[Lich King]] was slain. He's set up a camp of undead to our north.

Sure, [[Maxwell Tyrosus|Tyrosus]] wants us to kill [[banshee]]s in Northdale. We'll get to that. But let's kill this nerubian first, while we're close!

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Underlord's Mandible|Rash Gloves|Belt of Delay|Pendant of the Ill-Advised}}

You will also receive: {{cost||60}}

==Progress==
I hope Gidwin doesn't mind waiting.

==Completion==
I couldn't stop him. While you and Tarenar were out, Giddy ran north all alone!

Tarenar, you should have known better! Gidwin gets so impatient sometimes, and you only egg him on. If Giddy gets into any trouble, I'm blaming you for this.

==Notes==
*When you accept this quest, Tarenar accompanies you.  He will not, however, continue with you much past [[Ix'lar's Domain]].
*Eligible mobs are [[Scourge Guard]]s, [[Gangled Golem]]s, and [[Nerubian Sycophant]]s.
