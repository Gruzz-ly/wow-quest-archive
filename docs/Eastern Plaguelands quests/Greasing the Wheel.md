==Objectives==
Loot 10 Banshee's Bells from the shore of the [[Thondroril River]].
*[[Banshee's Bells]] (10)

==Description==
Sorry about that. I was pretty sure you were one of those [[nerubian|spider-beasts]], doing a bad <race> impression.

How do you do? [[Gidwin Goldbraids]], at your service. I'm in a bit of a hurry back to my [[Fiona's Caravan|caravan]], but I was wondering if you might do me one last favor? My pal Fiona runs a small shop, and she could probably use some of these herbs that grow along the river shore.

I'm thinking if we give her some nice herbs, she'll be MUCH less likely to murder me. That's the plan, anyway. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Giddy's Old Gloves
|Thondroril River Boots
|Treads of Banshee Bells
|Flower Picker's Gloves
|Stem-Laced Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Giddy's got you mixed up in all of this now?

==Completion==
I'll tear that pint-sized paladin to shreds before he... wait a minute are those Banshee's Bells? You brought these for me?

Oh, Gidwin asked you to get them for me! That sweet little guy. Alright. He's off the hook for now.
