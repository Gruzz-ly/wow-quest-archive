==Objectives==
Find someone at [[Crown Guard Tower]] who will join [[Fiona's Caravan|your caravan]].
*Find a traveling companion

==Description==
While we're waiting here at this tower, we might as well see if anybody else is headed to [[Light's Hope Chapel]]. The more, the merrier, I say! 

Ask around to see if anybody wants to join us on our trip. I'm sure you can find somebody who's headed to Light's Hope.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
[[Argus Highbeacon]]... that old guy on the top of the tower? Great!

A man his age must have been in the [[Argent Crusade]] for a long time. Maybe he can put in the good word for us at Light's Hope.

== Notes ==
'''Conversation with Argus Highbeacon'''
:"Yes, traveler?"
{{gossip|''Are you interested in joining our caravan? We're headed to Light's Hope Chapel.''}}
:"Well, I am headed in that direction. I've only been dallying here at Crown's Guard because of all the wildlife activity on the roads.<br/>I'll make you a deal: help me clear the roads, and yes, I'll join your group."

'''Conversation with [[Carlin Redpath]]'''
:"We have all been witness to terrible tragedies, but we must not let them drag us to despair.<br/>Instead, hold those memories close so that one day, we might find a reckoning."
{{gossip|''Are you interested in joining our caravan? We're headed to Light's Hope Chapel.''}}
:"I've spent far too long in that town. It's a wonderful place, and I enjoyed my service there, but I think I'd prefer to stay here."

'''Conversation with [[Chromie]]'''
:"Hello there, <name>. I am known as Chronormu, but you may call me Chromie. I am comfortable with such familiarity.<br/>Now - how did I know your name you ask? I am one of the [[bronze dragonflight]], forever attuned to the ebb and flow of time. You could say that we have met before. To that end, we shall also meet again."
{{gossip|''Are you interested in joining our caravan? We're headed to Light's Hope Chapel.''}}
:"No thanks! Maybe sometime in the future. Or the past. Not today."

'''Conversation with [[Janice Myers]]'''
:"Where would you like to fly to?"
{{gossip|''Are you interested in joining our caravan? We're headed to Light's Hope Chapel.''}}
:"I'm sorry, I can't. I've been tasked to watch this [[hippogryph]] post. These things might seem tame, but they really require a twenty-four hour vigil."

'''Conversation with [[Urk Gagbaz]]'''
:"How may I help you?"
{{gossip|''Are you interested in joining our caravan? We're headed to Light's Hope Chapel.''}}
:"Ugh! No, I could never. Afraid of [[horse]]s."
