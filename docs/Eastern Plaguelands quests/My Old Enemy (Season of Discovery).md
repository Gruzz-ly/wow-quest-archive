==Objectives==
Learn more about [[Baelin Caldoran]] from [[Leonid Barthalomew the Revered]].
* Speak with Leonid

==Description==
I had heard that Caldoran was present at [[Naxxramas]] and I feared that if the battle turned, I'd be forced to the front lines alongside of him.

While the [[Argent Dawn]] is in support of you providing aid to the [[Scarlet Reclamation]] forces, I must warn you in the most strenuous terms; be wary of Baelin Caldoran. My hands shake with rage even thinking about that man and the atrocities he has visited on the innocent. He is NOT to be trusted. Please, I implore you, heed my words here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||45}}
* 3,300 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
Caldoran is not to be trusted, ever.

==Completion==
That's all I will say on the matter for now. It took me years to crawl out of the pit of darkness inside my soul after what that man did to me.

We may be tentative allies now, but I will see Caldoran pay for his crimes... someday. My oath on this holds. In the meantime, be extremely careful in your dealings with him.

==Notes==
Speak with Leonid again:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Is there anything else you can tell me about Baelin Caldoran?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Caldoran is a murderous thug. His entire life, he's followed supposedly righteous causes that allow him to inflict pain and suffering unto others without facing the consequences. Ever the zealot, the ends will always justify the means to him.

{{Gossip|It sounds like you two have a long history.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Yes, we do. Caldoran cost me... everything. My home, my family, and ultimately my life.

I... cannot speak more on this. It fills me with too much pain.

{{Gossip|I'm sorry, Leonid. I won't push you further.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I thank you, <name>. All you need to know is to take heed of my warnings about that man. He is the worst kind of monster... he's the kind that truly believes that he's doing the right thing.

{{Gossip|I want to ask you about something else.}}
