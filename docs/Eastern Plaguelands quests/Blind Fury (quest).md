==Objectives==
Find [[Tarenar Sunstrike]] within the [[Plaguewood]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
Tarenar wasn't joking when he said that he didn't care about judgment and caution. He nearly took off that [[Kirkian Dawnshield|high elf]]'s head as he ran into the Plaguewood, looking for [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]]. You should go after him.

The Plaguewood is a big place, <name>. Good luck. I hope to see you <boys/three> come out of the woods in one piece.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||16}}

==Completion==
I haven't found anything but brainless undead, and plenty of them. I was just about to kill my way into [[Stratholme]] when you arrived.

Did you have any more success?
