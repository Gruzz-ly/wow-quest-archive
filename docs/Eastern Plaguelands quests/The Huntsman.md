Slay Huntsman Leopold
*[[Huntsman Leopold]] slain

==Description==
We've already lost half a dozen men to a hail of bullets and arrows coming from atop this fortress. I haven't seen the face of the enemy that's firing, but I don't need to. I know the name of the man up there.

[[Huntsman Leopold|Leopold]].

That's right, there's only one man up there, picking off my men one-by-one. And from what I can see, there's only one of you.

Sounds like a fair fight to me.

==Progress==
If it were up to me, I'd throw him off the edge of the tower.

==Completion==
One less thing to worry about.  Nice work up there. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Notes ==
On aggro:
