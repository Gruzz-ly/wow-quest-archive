==Objectives==
Search for [[Gidwin Goldbraids]] in [[Northdale]].
*[[Gidwin's Prayer Book]]

==Description==
Damn that dwarf. He's always getting me in trouble with [[Fiona]]. Look at her! She won't even TALK to me!

I'm going to stay here and try to mend my friendship with our [[worgen]] friend. Would you mind going out and making sure Gidwin is alright? I'm sure he's fine; he knows how to take care of himself. He headed north, and he can't have gone far.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||60}}

==Progress==
Northdale is home to a few ghosts and banshees. Nothing ol' Giddy can't handle.

==Completion==
You didn't see him? Where could he have gone then?

His... his prayer book? Why would he leave that behind?

Oh...

By the Light, what have I done?
