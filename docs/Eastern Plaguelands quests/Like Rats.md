==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Crusader Lord Valdelmar.jpg|Crusader Lord Valdelmar|How the mighty have fallen.}}
Slay [[Crusader Lord Valdelmar]].
*Crusader Lord Valdelmar slain

==Description==
Well, I'm glad that [[Crusade Commander Eligor Dawnbringer|Eligor]] and [[Crusade Commander Korfax|Korfax]] left some fun for me.  It was a battle unto itself to keep them from rushing headlong into the middle of this cathedral.

That's YOUR job, after all.

The [[Scarlet Basilica|cathedral]] lies ahead of us, the last real bastion of [[Scarlet Crusade|Scarlet]] power remaining.  Within it, Crusader Lord Valdelmar sits atop [[Tyr's Hand]]'s crumbling pulpit of lies.

There will be no escape; there will be no mercy.  The last simpering vestiges of the [[Scarlet Crusade]] end here.  Slay him.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Barthalomew's Belt
|Cloak of the Reverend
|Band of Zeal
}}
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|18000}} (or {{coppercost|4500}} at max level)
*7,550 [[XP]]
*+650 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Completion==
While I can't agree with their methods, I can't argue with their results.  In many ways, the Scarlet were well-intentioned, but their zeal grew too strong, and their hate blinded them to reason.

I only hope that the same doesn't happen to our [[Brotherhood of Light]].
