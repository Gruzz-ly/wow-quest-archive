==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Tarenar Sunstrike without tabard.jpg|Tarenar Sunstrike|Help me find Tarenar!}}
Find [[Tarenar Sunstrike]] at [[Death's Step]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
As soon as we stopped, they made a bet about "who could kill the most undead in five minutes."

It's been an hour, and I'm still waiting for them to come back.

I saw Tarenar run off to the southeast. Unfortunately, I can't leave the caravan here by itself. If you end up traveling in that direction, could you find him and send him back to me? 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||5}}

==Completion==
I've found them, <race>. The [[Scourge]]. How I've longed for this day.

==Progression==
{{Fiona's Caravan}}
