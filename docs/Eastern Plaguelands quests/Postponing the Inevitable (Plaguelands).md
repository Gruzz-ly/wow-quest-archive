==Objectives==
Obtain [[Plague Disseminator Control Rune|Control Runes]] from [[Dark Adept|Dark Cultists]] and [[Shadowmage (mob)|Shadowmages]], then use the Overcharged Mote on them to destroy 3 Plague Disseminators.
*[[Plague Disseminator]] destroyed (3)
*[[Overcharged Mote]] ''(provided)''

==Description==
You have a keen eye to have seen me here, hidden among the grasses.

Ahead of us lies the [[Fungal Vale]], an area that the [[Scourge]] still cling tightly to. They use floating constructs to continually re-plague the land, keeping it vile and polluted.

The devices are controlled with runes, which are held by dark adepts and shadowmages. Take the controlling runes that these cultists hold, aim them at the plague disseminators, then overcharge them with this mote. The results should be amusing. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}

==Progress==
If the [[Cenarion Circle]] is ever going to return the Fungal Vale to its original, healthy state, those plague disseminators must be the first things to go.

==Completion==
The sooner those Scourge are pushed out of the Fungal Vale, the sooner we can heal it.

Thank you, <name>.
