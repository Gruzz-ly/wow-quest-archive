==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus]] within [[Light's Hope Chapel]].

==Description==
I've always wanted to join the [[Argent Crusade|Crusade]]. It's the reason I became a [[paladin]]. Years of practice, honing my craft... I'm finally ready.

[[Tarenar Sunstrike|Tarenar]] thinks he's ready, too, but I'm not sure. He's a bit of a showboat, and he never took his lessons seriously. Still, we promised we'd do this together, and here we are.

Shall we head into the chapel now?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

==Completion==
Welcome to Light's Hope Chapel.

You wish to join the Crusade? Very well. We have plenty of tasks for new recruits.

But first, a test.

== Notes ==
Upon accepting this quest, Tarenar and Gidwin will follow you.

==Progression==
