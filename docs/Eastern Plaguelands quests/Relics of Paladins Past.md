==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|For my first lesson, learn from the revered heroes of the past and what inspired their Light.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|That's what I've been trying to do since I joined the Silver Hand.}}

[[Arator the Redeemer]] will accompany you.

;Upon entering Light's Hope
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I've known the stories of these paladins from when I was a child.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Each of them is a legend immortalized in stone. Their great deeds set an example for all paladins.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|But no matter how hard I try... I fear that I'll never live up to them.}}

;Upon obtaining Lena Stormpike's Stein
:{{Text|Say|Arator|[[General Lena Stormpike|Lena]] led an army against [[Burning Legion|the Legion]], why is her relic a book of tavern songs?}}

;Upon obtaining Vindicator Maraad's Meditation Crystal
:{{Text|Say|Arator|[[Vindicator Maraad|Maraad]] was known for his skill in combat. Yet his relic is a meditation crystal.}}

;Upon obtaining Uther's Healing Kit
:{{Text|Say|Arator|[[Uther the Lightbringer|Uther]] was the first and greatest of the Silver Hand Paladins. I'm surprised not to find his hammer but a healing kit.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I forgot that statue was here.}}

;Upon obtaining Krohm Dawnhammer's Smithing Hammer
:{{Text|Say|Arator|[[Krohm Dawnhammer|Krohm]] defended the people of Lordaeron. But the relic is a smithing hammer, not a weapon.}}

;Upon obtaining Mara Fordragon's Prayer Book
:{{Text|Say|Arator|[[Mara Fordragon|Mara]]'s heroics inspired the creation of the Silver Hand. Her relic is a book of refugee prayers though.}}

Begin to leave the sanctum.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I had expected these relics to be powerful weapons.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Instead, they were mostly simple items, unconnected to war.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Silver Hand was founded to wield the Light in battle. Is that not the measure of a paladin's accomplishments?}}

;Upon approaching Alonsus
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|The most revered paladins didn't draw their faith in the Light from warfare. They fought to preserve what they valued most.}}
