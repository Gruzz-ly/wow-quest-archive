==Description==
<Sifting through the ruins of the battle with [[Baelin Caldoran]], you find the emblem from the shattered blade of the [[Ashbringer]]. As you hold the skull-shaped icon in your hand, you can swear you hear a slight, murmuring whisper. You look around, searching for a source for the voice, but you see no obvious source of the sound. You shake your head and stow the emblem in your pack.>
