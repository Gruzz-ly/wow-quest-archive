==Objectives==
Slay 16 Scourge and 8 Cultists within [[Browman Mill]] and the [[Noxious Glade]]. Return to [[Light's Hope Chapel]] if [[Tarenar Sunstrike|Tarenar]] or [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]] is slain.
*Noxious Glade Scourge slain (16)
*Noxious Glade Cultists slain (8)

==Description==
Browman's Mill, to the north, is infested with [[undead]]. The Noxious Glade, even farther to the north, is even more heavily infested.  Despite their proximity to our chapel, we have been unable to completely remove them.

Vigilance is key.  Travel into the Noxious Vale and slay as many undead as you can find... and the cultists that roam among them.

While there, make sure to avoid [[Garginox]], the flesh giant that roams the vale.  I suspect you are not strong enough to defeat him.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|15}}

==Progress==
The three of you still have a job to do.

==Completion==
You've returned sooner then I expected.  Excellent.

We will continue our path to the north.  Next, you will be completing a similar task - this time, in [[Northdale]].

== Notes ==
Upon accept, Tarenar and Gidwin start wearing the Argent Crusade tabard.
