==Objectives==
Check your map to find an area under [[Scourge]] attack. Go there and damage a [[necropolis]] by defeating the Scourge around them. Return 10 of their Necrotic Runes to [[Commander Thomas Helleran]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] in the {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}}.
*[[Necrotic Rune]] (10)

==Description==
The floating necropolises of the Scourge plague the lands of [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]] alike. {{C|Tanaris}}, the {{C|Blasted Lands}}, {{C|Winterspring}} and the {{C|Burning Steppes}} are blanketed in the shadows of the flying fortresses.

Only through our combined efforts will they be turned away.

The necropolises are supported by magical circles at various points in the invaded areas. We have determined that destroying the mindless hordes that surround these circles will destroy their defenses.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Blessed Wizard Oil]] x2
*[[Consecrated Sharpening Stone]] x2
*[[Weighted Consecrated Sharpening Stone]] x2

You will also receive:
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
It will take time to prevail against this threat. How have you fared, <name>?

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>. Through these incremental defeats, we shall prevail against this renewed Scourge threat.

Rest and recover, but then you must head out to the front again, lest we lose the ground we have gained today.

To aid you in your further battles, we will make some of our special items available to you in trade for more necrotic runes.
