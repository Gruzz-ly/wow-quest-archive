==Objectives==
Hop in [[Fiona's Caravan]] and ride to [[Northpass Tower]].
*Ride Fiona's Caravan to Northpass Tower

==Description==
This is my fault. I... I ignored his warnings, his complaints, everything. I couldn't help myself - I saw those [[Scourge]] just beyond the tower, and I... I HAD to go kill them.

[[Argus Highbeacon|Argus]] says that [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]] was taken northwest, and that's our only lead, so that's where we'll head.

Northdale and the Argent Crusade be damned! We're getting Gidwin back from those Scourge trash.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

==Progress==
We have no time, <name>! We must press on!

==Completion==
Time is wasting, <name>. Every minute we waste gives the Scourge another chance to kill Gidwin. If he isn't dead already.

Not that I think he is. Giddy may be a stick-in-the-mud, but when it comes down to it, he can swing the Light like a champion.

== Notes ==
'''During the caravan ride'''
:''The caravan begins its journey towards Northpass Tower, with Fiona and Argus Highbeacon sitting at the front and Tarenar Sunstrike and the hero sitting at the back.''
:{{Text|yell|Tarenar Sunstrike|I can't believe I let Gidwin run off like that!}}
:{{Text|say|Fiona|It's not your fault, Tarenar.  He ran off on his own will.  None of us could stop him.}}
:{{Text|say|Argus Highbeacon|We can't be certain that he was killed.  Maybe he just ran off somewhere.}}
:{{Text|yell|Tarenar Sunstrike|No, he'd never just leave his prayer book behind!  He was always nose-deep in that book, studying.}}
:{{Text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|He was always studying, always trying to get better.}}
:{{Text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Even more reason to believe that he's still alive.}}
:{{Text|say|Argus Highbeacon|A paladin like Gidwin makes a fine death knight.  Any member of the Scourge powerful enough to defeat him would know that.}}
:{{Text|say|Argus Highbeacon|It's likely that he's being held somewhere, awaiting a death ritual.}}
:{{Text|yell|Fiona|Really?  That's great news!}}
:{{Text|say|Fiona|Well, actually, that's pretty bad news, but considering the alternatives...}}
:{{Text|say|Argus Highbeacon|If we're to find him, we're headed in the right direction.  It's likely that he was taken to Stratholme, or potentially to the Plaguewood.}}
:{{Text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Both are places of great evil.  This is the leg of my journey that I shun the most.}}
:{{Text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|I'm not sure I'm ready to go in there alone.}}
:{{Text|say|Fiona|You're not alone, Tarenar.  You've made allies along the way.  And besides, you're a skilled paladin in your own right.}}
:{{Text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Me, skilled?  No, no, Gidwin was the good paladin.  He's the one who stayed up for hours every night practicing...}}
:{{Text|say|Fiona|...yet it was you that continually kept up with him.  Without practice.}}
:{{Text|say|Fiona|I've watched both of you fight, Tarenar.  You've got natural talent - more than Gidwin ever will.}}
:{{Text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Perhaps that's why he left without you.}}
:{{Text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|What do you mean?}}
:{{Text|say|Argus Highbeacon|Perhaps he felt he needed to prove that he was as talented as you.}}
:{{Text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|This is all my fault.  I've got to go find him, to set things right.}}
:{{Text|say|Argus Highbeacon|I wouldn't say that it's your fault, Tarenar.  But don't let that stop you from saving Gidwin.}}
