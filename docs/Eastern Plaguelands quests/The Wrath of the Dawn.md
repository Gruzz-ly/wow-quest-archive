==Objectives==
Report back to Commander Beatrix at the [[Scarlet Base Camp]] in {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}} and make ready to retake the {{Sod|Scarlet Enclave}}.
*Report back to [[Beatrix]]

==Description==
Regardless of the reason that beast withdrew back to the enclave, we will not give it another chance to destroy us. It seems that our hand is forced and we must now commit the full fury of the [[Argent Dawn]] to the cause of ending the threat of the Scarlet Enclave.

Go back to the Scarlet Base Camp and meet back up with Beatrix. Let her know that she has our support... for now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||45}}
* 3,300 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
I saw smoke rising from the direction of [[Light's Hope Chapel|Light's Hope]], what has happened?

==Completion==
Some sort of beast attacked Light's Hope? That is bold of [[Balnazzar]]. Too bold, as now the Argent Dawn has committed to our cause. I won't lie to you and tell you I am not relieved to receive their assistance. I don't think we can take the enclave with the forces at our command now.

We're in the endgame now, <class>. Prepare your forces.

==Progression==
