==Objectives==
Defeat [[Blackmane]].
* Ask [[Sean Wilkers]] to open the [[Stratholme Service Entrance|Stratholme service entrance]].

==Description==
The evil presence has returned to [[Stratholme]] yet again. That's the problem with [[necromancy]] and [[scourge]], they keep reanimating themselves and coming right back!

I can bring us in there again, but I suspect all of those evil forces have returned. Are you sure you want to go back in there? That place gives me the creeps. If you really want to head back in there, I will let you back in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
They did what to Blackmane!? Who are these people? Infusing a beast with strange necromancy powers certainly sounds like an escalation of events compared to what they have done previously. What can they possibly be doing with all of this stuff they are taking? It sounds like a showdown is imminent.

==Progression==
