==Objectives==
Speak with [[Fiona]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].
*[[Gidwin's Hearthstone]] (provided)

==Description==
I've had just about enough of the funk of this place. [[Undead]] stink is bad enough, and then you add mushrooms to the mix? I hate mushrooms!

I'm going to head back to Light's Hope Chapel, <name>... and I'm taking [[Tarenar Sunstrike|Tarenar]] and Fiona with me. I think we've all earned a well-deserved break.

Let me give you this. It's my hearthstone - you can use it to travel instantly back to Light's Hope. I won't need it - I'm going to be riding in the caravan.

In the FRONT SEAT.

==Completion==
You've been more help than anyone expected of you, <name>. The doors of my caravan are always open to you.

The boys and I have even put together a little something special for you. Here, take your pick!
