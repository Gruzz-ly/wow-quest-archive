==Objectives==
Find the [[mage]]s near [[Blackwood Lake]] and have them cast spells on you until the [[felhound]] appears.
*Find Felhunter Area
*Summon Felhound
*Obtain Soul of Devouring

==Description==
This [[soul]] should be an interesting one. While you were gone I've heard that a rogue felhound has been preying on some mages near Blackwood Lake. Take this special soul shard - it should amplify the effects of [[arcane]] [[magic]] cast on you. That felhound won't be able to resist it.

==Progress==
Is everything going well?

==Completion==
The scythe is ready at last. Just one more trial, <name>.

==Notes==
Find the [[Shadowmage (mob)|Shadowmages]] southeast of [[Blackwood Lake]] and kill them until one drops a [[Shadow Carving]]. Once obtained, there is a high chance that the [[Ravenous Felhound]] will spawn while in combat with the Shadowmages. Use [[Drain Soul]] on it to obtain the [[Soul of Devouring]], then use it on the [[Depleted Scythe of Chaos (Enthralling)]]  and return to Doan.

==Progression==
{{The Depleted Scythe}}
