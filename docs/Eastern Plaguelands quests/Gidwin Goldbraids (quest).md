==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gidwin Goldbraids without tabard.jpg|Gidwin Goldbraids|Help me find Gidwin!}}
Find [[Gidwin Goldbraids]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
I love my boys, don't get me wrong. But I TOLD them that I needed FIVE MINUTES to water and brush the horses, and what did they do? They made a stupid bet with each other and ran off! I should have known better... this always happens.

Gidwin's the short one. He headed north, along the river. If you're headed that direction, would you tell him to come back? We've got to get to [[Light's Hope Chapel]], and I'm not against leaving without him.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||5}}

==Completion==
<[[Tarenar Sunstrike|Tarenar]]/[[Fiona]]>? Is that you?

Whoever you are, would you mind helping me out of this thing?
