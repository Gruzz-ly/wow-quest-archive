==Objectives==
Report to [[Archmage Angela Dosantos]] at [[Tyr's Hand]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
Can you sense it? The taint is already lifting from this building.

A holy building wants to be holy, and villains like [[Rohan the Assassin|Rohan]] and the rest of his [[Scarlet Crusade|Scarlet]] scum only hold it back.

With the abbey secure, we are a step closer to taking Tyr's Hand. Report the results of our strike to Angela. She should be leading the charge on the [[Scarlet Basilica|cathedral]] from somewhere in the center of town.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6|}} 
*480 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Completion==
Good, the abbey is ours.  I never doubted [[Crusade Commander Eligor Dawnbringer|Eligor's]] ability for a moment.

==Progression==
{{The Brotherhood of Light}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
