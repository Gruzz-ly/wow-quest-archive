==Objectives==
Bring another Heart of Doom to [[Brother Luctus]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] in {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}}.
*[[Heart of Doom]]

==Description==
Bring me any doomed souls that cross your path, <name>.

Let me rephrase that - you MUST bring them to me.<br>MY duty is to stay and guide the souls of the lost. YOUR duty is to bring them to me.

A word of advice, never handle more than one soul at a time. Trust me, your soul can only handle so much, and your mind... well... it can handle even less.

This burden is now yours. Because you can, you must.

Consider this a moral obligation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*[[Remnants of Valor]] x300

==Progress==
The [[scourge]] never rests, so we must never rest, <name>.

==Completion==
<Name>, with every heart returned, I stand humbled. Some of the souls have been from powerful warriors. Some seemed as though they were indomitable... and yet... they fell.

Scourge overrunning them, corruption seeping into their minds, or in some cases - they willingly submitted.

Such great strength - snuffed out.

And now, thanks to you, they preserve their final shred of valor.

Without you, the horrors of their deaths would outweigh the heroics of their lives.
