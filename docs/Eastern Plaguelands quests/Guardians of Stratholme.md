==Objectives==
Kill Omasum Blighthoof and Karthis Darkrune.
*[[Omasum Blighthoof]] slain
*[[Karthis Darkrune]] slain

==Description==
[[Baroness Anastari]] holds him? Here in the [[Plaguewood]]?

The Plaguewood is a big place... but we will find him. We WILL find [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]].

Immediately to our east and our west are a pair of necropoli that flank the entrance to [[Stratholme]]. Inside them, you will find a pair of [[death knight]]s - [[Baron Rivendare|Rivendare's]] lieutenants. I doubt either would have any use for a paladin hostage, but perhaps they will have some information on his location.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|30}}

==Progress==
We're getting close. I only hope it's not too late.

==Completion==
We've got to keep moving! We're getting so very close!

==Progression==
{{Fiona's Caravan}}
