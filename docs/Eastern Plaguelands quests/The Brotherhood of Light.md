==Objectives==
Report to [[Archmage Angela Dosantos]] at [[Tyr's Hand]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
The [[Brotherhood of Light]] has a history of brash, thoughtless decisions. They bridged a gap between the [[Scarlet Crusade]] and the [[Argent Dawn]]. They were among the first to plunge into [[Northrend]], while many of us lingered behind.

However, they also have a history of getting results, which I respect. They fight on two fronts now: one battle in [[Stratholme]], and another, more immediate battle to the south at Tyr's Hand.

I suggest you speak with Angela Dosantos at Tyr's Hand. You may be of service. 

==Completion==
A <class>! Just what we needed. Your arrival couldn't have been more timely.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}
