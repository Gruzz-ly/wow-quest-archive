Obtain Zaeldarr's Head from [[Zaeldarr the Outcast]].
*[[Zaeldarr's Head]]

==Description==
Can you believe that, after all the trouble we have in the [[plaguelands]]... we have to worry about [[Thief|thieves]] too? And not just normal thieves, [[troll]] thieves.

And not just normal troll thieves. Dead troll thieves!

They're led by this big, dead troll named Zaeldarr the Outcast, and they come here at night and steal bodies from our graveyards, then take them back to their evil, dead troll hideout--the [[Undercroft]] to the southwest.

Go there and take out Zaeldarr, <name>. I'm sick to death of his mischief!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55|}}
*4600 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
Did you find the hideout, <name>?  Did you take care of Zaeldarr?

==Completion==
Great, you got him!  And I hope you taught his gang a lesson too!
