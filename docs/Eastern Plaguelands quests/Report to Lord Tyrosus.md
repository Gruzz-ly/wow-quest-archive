==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] in {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}}.

==Description==
Please, <name>, a messenger just arrived. You must return to Light's Hope Chapel with all haste! We are under attack and Lord Maxwell Tyrosus has requested your presence at once.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45}}
*6,600 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
We have been attacked! Some sort of [[dragon]]-like... abomination flew in fast from the direction of the {{Sod|Scarlet Enclave}} and hit us hard. I've seen dragons before but I've never seen anything like this.

The strangest part is that the dragon just... left. It hit us with a single terrible blast and then just flew away. This is a blessing, to be sure--but is deeply unsettling. We were caught completely unaware. It could have inflicted enormous damage but it seemed to choose not to.

==Notes==
Back in the chapel, Argent mages are putting out fires all around.

==Progression==
{{The Scarlet Reclamation}}
