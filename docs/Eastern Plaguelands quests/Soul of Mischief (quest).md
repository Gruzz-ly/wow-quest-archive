*Suspicious Supplies placed (5)
*Report to Xirath
*Obtain Soul of Mischief
*Use Soul of Mischief
*[[Suspicious Supplies]] (5) (provided)

==Description==
Looking at the curious scythe you've brought in, I believe we need to provide it souls in order to restore it. Let's start with imps. I have an associate in the {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}} near [[Northdale]] that may be able to help you. Mention my name and he should be more amenable. I'll meet you in [[Light's Hope Chapel]] after you are done.

==Progress==
Is everything going well?

==Completion==
Great work, <name>, the scythe appears to be regaining power. Oh, Xirath? Pity he double-crossed us in the end. I'll have to find a new associate. Let's try increasing the potency of the soul next time.

==Notes==
Find Xirath near [[Northdale]] in the {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}}.

{{dialogue|{{gossip|Doan sent me. He said you know where to get a Soul of Mischief?}}

You know Doan? Yeah, I know a guy that can get you a Soul of Mischief. You gotta do something for me first, though.

Take these supplies and use them on those skull piles over there. I'll have what you need when you return.}}

Use the provided [[Suspicious Supplies]] on the nearby [[Skull Pile]]s; doing so will summon [[Manathirst Imp]]s. Once all the supplies have been placed, return to Xirath.

{{dialogue|{{gossip|I've placed your supplies.}}

Good, yes. Unfortunately, I have no need for you now.}}

Xirath will turn hostile; use [[Drain Soul]] on him to obtain the [[Soul of Mischief]], then kill him and use the Soul of Mischief to transform the [[Depleted Scythe of Chaos]] into [[Depleted Scythe of Chaos (Mischief)]].

Doan can be found at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] to turn in the quest.

==Progression==
{{The Depleted Scythe}}
