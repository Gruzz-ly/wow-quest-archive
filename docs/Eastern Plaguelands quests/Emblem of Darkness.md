==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] about the Emblem of the Ashbringer.
* [[Reforged Blade of the Ashbringer]]

==Description==
There is one final piece; the Emblem of the Ashbringer. In a way, the emblem is the heart of the blade. [[Alexandros Mograine|Highlord Alexandros]] himself used all his will and determination to transfigure an orb of pure void into a vessel of the [[Light]] itself.

The emblem endured when [[Caldoran]] fell and the blade shattered. [[Adventurer]]s recovered it and passed it into Lord Maxwell Tyrosus's care.

Retrieve the emblem and we'll have everything we need for the next step.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Emblem of the Ashbringer]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
<Lord Maxwell Tyrosus' eyes widen as you tell him of [[the Will of the Ashbringer]].>

That is an incredible tale, <name>. Part of me rejoices at the prospect of restoring the blade and seeing my old friend finally find the peace that was stolen from him.
However, there is a feeling that I just can't shake. I fear that this path won't lead you to the ending we'd hope for.

Regardless, if you are sure that this is the way, then I will entrust the emblem to your care and pray for a hopeful outcome.
