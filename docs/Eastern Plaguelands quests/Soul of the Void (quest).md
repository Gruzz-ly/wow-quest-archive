==Objectives==
Find the Voidwalker near [[Corin's Crossing]] in {{C|Eastern Plaguelands}} and add its [[soul]] to the scythe.
*Find Ritual Site
*Summon Voidwalker
*Obtain [[Soul of the Void (quest item)]]

==Description==
The scythe is progressing nicely. The next soul you should try adding is that of a Voidwalker. I know of a particularly powerful one that is lingering despite its master dying nearby. It should make for a good addition.

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>. Are you ready for the next stage of restoration of this scythe?

==Notes==
Enter the town hall of [[Corin's Crossing]] and find the [[Cult of the Damned Sacrifice]]. Interact with the nearby [[Shadow Ritual of Sacrifice]] to summon an [[Abandoned Voidwalker]]. This will deal a significant amount of shadow damage that must be survived. Cast [[Drain Soul]] in the Abandoned Voidwalker to obtain the [[Soul of the Void (quest item)]], then use it on the [[Depleted Scythe of Chaos (Mischief)]] and return to Doan.

==Progression==
{{The Depleted Scythe}}
