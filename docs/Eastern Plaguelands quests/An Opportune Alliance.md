==Objectives==
Check in with [[Fiona]] at [[Eastwall Tower]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].
 
==Description==
With your contributions to the food stores, my current assignment is complete.

I will be heading north, to the [[Plaguewood]], next. I understand you may be headed in the same direction.

Do you mind if I join you on the road?

I will head northwest, to Eastwall Tower. If you're interested in teaming up, you can meet up with me there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*2400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You brought us a [[shaman]]!  From the [[Earthen Ring]], no less!

I have no idea how we'll fit him in the caravan, but we'll find a way.  Welcome aboard, [[Rimblat Earthshatter]]!
