==Completion==
It looks like Beezil has already made himself comfortable, and has stuffed several peculiar gizmos into the caravan.

Most of them seem too impractical or dangerous to take with you.  One small cogwheel, however, looks to be fairly well-crafted.

==Rewards==
The following spell will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Beezil's Cog|Increase movement speed within Eastern Plaguelands by 10%.|id=85619|icon=inv_misc_enggizmos_30}}

==Notes==
This quest becomes available once you complete the quest [[A Gift For Fiona]] and {{NPC||Beezil Linkspanner}} joins the caravan.

==Patch changes==
