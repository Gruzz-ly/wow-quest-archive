This quest is part of the {{questchain|Rewriting the Battle of Darrowshire}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Find Pamela's doll. 
*[[Pamela's Doll]]

==Description==
My [[Marlene Redpath|auntie Marlene]] told me to stay here in our house because my [[Joseph Redpath|father]] had to go and fight. My father's the bravest man in the whole world!

But I've been here for a long time, and he hasn't come for me. Sometimes bad people come and whisper to me and I want my dad to make them go away, but he's not here!

And sometimes when it gets dark I want to play with my doll but I can't because I left it in town.

Will you find my doll for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4590 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find my doll?

==Completion==
You found it! You found my doll! Oh, thank you!

==Notes==
You must find the three parts of Pamela's doll:
* [[Pamela's Doll's Head]],
* [[Pamela's Doll's Left Side]]
* & [[Pamela's Doll's Right Side]]
scattered around Darrowshire, and "use" them to make the doll.  Several parts (often a complete doll's worth) can be found inside each of the buildings.

Approaching any doll part will summon a [[Ghost of the Past]].
