==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Overstuffed Golem]]s, then use the Crusader's Torch on their corpses.
*Overstuffed golem corpse burned (8)
*[[Crusader's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
You can't just kill the [[Scourge]]. They will come back. You must destroy the vile matter that makes up their being... and even then, they may come back as spectres.

Few [[undead]] use up as much mass as the lumbering [[abomination]]s. Kill them, then burn their bodies. You will find them all over the [[Plaguewood]].

Never let your rage dissipate, <race>. Remember: these abominations are sewn together from the bodies of good people. Their crime is that they exist.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*5,290 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
Hold tightly onto your rage, <race>.  Let it guide your strikes against these beasts.

==Completion==
A blessed fire cleanses even the most corrupt of flesh.

They stood no chance in the face of the [[Light]].
