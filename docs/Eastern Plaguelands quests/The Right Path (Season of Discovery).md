==Objectives==
Speak with [[Leonid Barthalomew the Revered]] at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] to receive your reward.

==Description==
Now you know the whole story. Reliving all of this was painful, but I've put off facing it for far too long. Strangely, I feel... better. I've prayed for justice for so long, but delivering that justice is not my burden to bear. I've chosen my own path and letting vengeance pull me back into darkness will not bring me peace, nor will it honor my son's wishes.

I'm heading back to deliver my report to Lord Tyrosus. I'll see you back at Light's Hope. I have something for you there.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Leonid's Charm]]
*[[Hand of Reborn Justice]]
*[[Barthalomew Family Seal]]
*[[Journal of the Revered]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|1|80|}}
* 8,300 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Caldoran's reckoning will come eventually as his brand of evil is ultimately self-defeating. I have faith in that, just as I have faith in my son's dream. 

Please, take this. This was given to me by Liliana when I was inducted into the Silver Hand and served me well as a reminder of my oaths to my family and country during my years of service. I hope it can serve as a reminder that it is always darkest before the dawn, but the dawn will always come.
