==Objectives==
Kill 5 Death's Step Miscreations at [[Death's Step]] in [[Eastern Plaguelands]].
*[[Death's Step Miscreation]] slain (5)

==Description==
I remember when I was young, I would sneak off into the [[Ghostlands]] and just beat up [[zombie]]s for hours on end. Nobody even PAID me. I just did it.

Now, look in front of you. Those are some serious zombies. I was just about to start beating them up, too. Care to join me?

== Rewards ==
You will also receive: {{cost||50}}

==Progress==
I can't wait to lay waste to these undead.  Boom!

==Completion==
Five should be good enough.

Yikes, look at the time! I need to head back to camp.

==Progression==
