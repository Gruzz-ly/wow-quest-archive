==Objectives==
Destroy the hulks of three [[Corpsebeast]]s by placing three or more Argent Lightwells next to them. You cannot place Argent Lightwells while in combat, and you may not place them within ten yards of one another.
*[[Corpsebeast]] destroyed (3)
*[[Argent Lightwell Charm]] (provided)

==Description==
To the south, gutless cultists are focused on a grim task: re-animating enormous hunks of flesh, to create giants known as corpsebeasts. Luckily for us, these giants are still lifeless and weak.

Take this charm - using it will place a font of holy energy on the ground. If you can manage to place three of them near one of the corpsebeasts that the cultists are reanimating, the holy energy should overload it, destroying its body forever.

==Progress==
This is my final task for you.  I wish you luck.

==Completion==
You are a true Champion of [[the Light]], <name>.  I wish you luck in your future endeavors, wherever they might take you.

If you need anything in the future, you can always find me here - knee-deep in the corpses of the slain.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|80}}
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Legwraps of the Slain|Corpsebeast Armbands|Overload Robes}}

==Notes==
If the lightwell is not close enough to the corpsebeast, it will just sit there ... and create a 10 yard area where no other lightwells can be placed.  If the lightwell is close enough, it will start shooting sparks into the corpsebeast.
