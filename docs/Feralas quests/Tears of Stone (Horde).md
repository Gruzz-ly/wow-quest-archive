==Objectives==
Collect 7 Stonetears.
*[[Stonetear]] (7)

==Description==
As you witnessed, the dragon [[Ysondre]] has told us that the tears of the land can seal the portal from which this corruption stems.

Weeks ago, in the glade to the west, I saw the [[mountain giant]]s distraught. They raged in frustration and wept, and their tears fell upon the stones as shining crystals.

Though the giants weep no more, these stonetears must be what Ysondre referred to; a source of nature's purity. We must gather them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
The tears are among the very rocks that the giants themselves rise from. There should be loose ones near the base of these large monoliths.

==Completion==
Thank you once again, <name>. I will prepare these for our final task.

==Progression==
