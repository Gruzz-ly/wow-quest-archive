==Objectives==
Bring the Pristine Yeti Hide to [[Pratt McGrubben]] at the [[Feathermoon Stronghold]], [[Feralas]].
*[[Pristine Yeti Hide]] (provided)

==Description==
You have found a pristine yeti hide that is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the [[yeti]] in [[Rage Scar Hold|Rage Scar]].

Considering that Pratt McGrubben at the Feathermoon Stronghold is in the market for yeti hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him.

==Progress==
What's this, <name> - you've got something special for me?

==Completion==
Incredible!  You may have found the granddaddy of all yeti hides with this!

You better believe I'll pay you for it.  I normally don't pay that much for a single hide, but I'm pretty sure I can make something special from it.  Thanks for thinking of me on this, <name>!
