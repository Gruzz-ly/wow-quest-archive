== Objectives ==
Slay {{NPC||General Skessesh}} and take his head.
*[[Head of Skessesh]]

== Description ==
The leader of these forces must fall! The naga's offensive will be broken with no one to command them.

I saw the coward retreat into one of the abandoned buildings here. Cut your way through the others and take his head! [[Shandris Feathermoon|Lady Shandris]] will want to see it for herself.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
Has the general fallen? 

== Completion ==
Good riddance to foul creatures. May the naga slither back into the sea and never return.

You've proven yourself on the battlefield, <name>. I would ask more assistance of you in defending our lands here.
