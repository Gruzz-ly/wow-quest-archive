==Description==
Whatever [[Kaldorei]] knowledge you seek will not be found among these ruins, <class>. Not anymore.

However, while the physical lies in ruin, the spiritual remains.

Seek the guardian spirits of Azshara, the Hinterlands, and Feralas. You will know them by their shrines. Prove yourself to them, and heed their words. Their wisdom will be passed on to you, so that it will not be lost to time as so much was here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4700 [[XP]]
*{{cost||75}}
*[[Rune of Efflorescence]]
*[[Seed of Renewal]]

==Progress==
Have the spirits imparted their wisdom unto you?

==Completion==
You have proven a dedicated pupil, <name>. The work of preserving ancient knowledge is often arduous, but you have taken on the duty admirably.

There are many more mysteries in this world for you to uncover. I hope these tools will aid you in that journey.
