== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Tambre}} on [[Sardor Isle]]. 

== Description ==
Our settlement on Sardor Isle was lost to the [[Hatecrest]] naga. Overwhelmed by their numbers, we fell back to the mainland. While they coveted their newly-gained sandbar, we raised New Feathermoon on the shore and amassed an even greater army.

Now, the Hatecrest will be driven back into the sea. Find our [[Ancient of War]] along the shore. He will take you to the front lines, where Tambre leads the offensive. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||20}}

== Completion ==
These foul things will be driven back into the sea. I hope you're ready. 

==Progression==
{{The Twilight Sermon}}
