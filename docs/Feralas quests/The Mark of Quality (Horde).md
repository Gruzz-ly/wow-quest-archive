==Objectives==
Collect 10 Thick Yeti Hides. 
*[[Thick Yeti Hide]] (10)

==Description==
I take pride in my leather work, and I feel it shows; quality should never be compromised. Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter would also have you believe that the earth does not keep secrets!

In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have discovered thick yeti hides. Yetis are native to [[Feralas]], often found north of here in [[Rage Scar Hold]]. I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten. If that is agreeable to you, then we are set!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Jangdor's Handcrafted Boots
|Jangdor's Handcrafted Gloves
|Jangdor's Handcrafted Greaves
|Jangdor's Handcrafted Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
*3500 [[XP]] (or {{cost||24|60}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Were you able to get a stack of ten thick yeti hides?  My leather goods are second to none, and I'll share a sampling with you should you have the hides. 

==Completion==
Ah, excellent!  These hides, when given a special treatment, are as resilient as iron I tell you!  It will take many tries in order to get the right mix down for the tanning, but I am confident they will bring my mark of quality to the next level.

As for you, <name>... your assistance has proven invaluable to me.  Please take your choice from these items I have crafted.

==Notes==
The hides come from both drops and from skinning the downed yeti; it is possible to get two hides from one yeti, one via drop and one via skinning.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing previous version.}}
