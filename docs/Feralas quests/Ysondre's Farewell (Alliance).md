== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Adella}} at [[Shadebough]]. 

== Description ==
With that, I am the only one left.

Even if I choose to remain in this world, I cannot rejoin the green flight. But this victory gives me hope. Perhaps, in time, I can find peace in a simple life among mortals.

You must return to your people. Tell them that the dragons of nightmare are gone, and will no longer threaten these lands.

== Completion ==
To be drawn into a fight between dragons...I don't know if you're blessed or cursed.

[[Shandris Feathermoon|Lady Shandris]] has heard of all you've done, and has personally sent this reward for your bravery. I'm glad you came back in one piece to receive it. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Chain of Taerar|Chain of Emeriss|Chain of Lethon}}

==Progression==
{{The Dragons of Nightmare}}

== Patch changes ==
