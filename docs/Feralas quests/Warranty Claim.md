==Objectives==
Bring [[Wirdal Wondergear]] a Charged Voidcore.
*[[Charged Voidcore]]

==Description==
I can repair that processor for you, but I need a somewhat hard-to-get item; a Charged Voidcore. [[Naga]] spell casters are known to carry these and while I can't be sure where the Naga get them or how they are made, they tend to act as powerful foci for certain types of magical rituals. They are the key component to my G-7 C.O.R.E. Processor unit. They aren't common so you may be in for a tough time finding one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Pristine G-7 C.O.R.E. Processor]]

==Progress==
I shudder to think how many Naga you had to clobber to get this thing.

==Completion==
Well here goes nothing.

I feel compelled to give you the disclaimer that I won't be held responsible for any electrical fires, electromagnetic pulse bursts, [[demon]]ic manifestations, or interdimensional vortexes that may result from the installation and usage of this processor.

==Notes==
*A [[Spent Voidcore]] drops from [[naga]] on the [[Isle of Dread]] or [[Sardor Isle]] in {{C|Feralas}}. Combine it with a [[Mote of Darkness (Season of Discovery)]] obtained from the [[Shadowy Figure (Season of Discovery)|Shadowy Figure]] to create the [[Charged Voidcore]].
