==Objectives==
Collect a Gordunni Orb from a [[Gordunni Warlock]].
* [[Gordunni Orb]]

==Description==
In addition to clearing out the Ogres...

{{NPC||Estulan}} mentioned something else about the Ogres. He said the Ogre warlocks may have some sort of orb, or other item of power{{sic}}

He was terse about it, but seemed upset...he said there was "no way they could be [[Highborne]]", so I think he wants to know just where they got them. Bring me back one of these orbs. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
* 3,710 [[Experience point|XP]] {{cost||40|}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Do you have the orb?

==Completion==
Is that it? Let me see here... 

==Progression==
{{The Gordunni Threat}}
