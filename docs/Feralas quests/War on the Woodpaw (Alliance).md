==Objectives==
Collect 10 Woodpaw Gnoll Manes.
*[[Woodpaw Gnoll Mane]] (10)

==Description==
The first of [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris's]] direct orders is to deal with the [[Woodpaw]] [[gnoll]]s here. They've been spreading too far, too fast, and are becoming a threat to both the forest and our war effort.

They know we're here. After we took this camp, we've been leading covert strikes against them. It's time to make a major blow; bring back ten of their manes, and we'll be ready for the next phase. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||45}}

==Progress==
The manes aren't just for trophies. If there's to be slaughter, we may as well not let it be a total waste. 

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. I didn't think those gnolls would give you much trouble. 

==Progression==
{{The Dragons of Nightmare}}
