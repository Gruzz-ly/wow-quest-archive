==Objectives==
Defeat Taerar.
*Defeat [[Taerar]]

==Description==
{{NPC||Emeriss}} and {{NPC||Lethon}} are gone. It's only us left now. I can hide from this no longer. All I did while a part of [[Dragons of Nightmare|that brood]]... all the suffering I've caused... must be repaid today.

I am still weak, <name>. I cannot assume my true form even if I dare try. But I will still stand beside you in battle.

If you are prepared, I will call {{NPC||Taerar}} to us. He will be unable to resist the temptation of revisiting corruption upon me. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 4,370 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is done.

[[Feralas|This land]] that has suffered so much can rest now. 

==Notes==
After accepting the quest, Ysondre summons Taerar and they have the following dialogue:
:{{text|yell|[[Ysondre]]|Come forth, Taerar! I stand before you!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Taerar]]|I knew you'd return, Ysondre... It was only a matter of time...}}
:{{text|say|Ysondre|I've returned only to end this, Taerar. This land will finally have peace.}}
:{{text|say|Taerar|Peace? PEACE?}}
:{{text|yell|Taerar|Peace is but a fleeting dream! Let the [[Emerald Nightmare|NIGHTMARE]] reign!}}

After Taerar is defeated:
:{{text|yell|Taerar|My essence... will... persist...}}

==Progression==
{{The Dragons of Nightmare}}
