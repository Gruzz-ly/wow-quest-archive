==Objectives==
Collect 20 Zukk'ash Carapaces.
*[[Zukk'ash Carapace]] (20)

==Description==
With the [[gnoll]]s out of the way, we're ready to take care of other foes. Our [[scout]]s have discovered what appears to be a hive nearby, extending deep beneath the ground.

The insects of the hive are large and ferocious, and most likely pose an even greater threat than the gnolls. I want you to proceed to the hive with caution. Cut down a good portion of the bugs and bring back their carapaces for further study.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45|}}
*3900 [[Experience point|XP]] (or {{cost||23|40}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
How goes the hunt, <name>?  Are you here to report your success?

==Completion==
These are [[silithid]] after all...I wasn't sure, having never seen one in person. Gilneas had its problems, but at least we didn't have these monstrosities running around!

==Progression==
{{The Dragons of Nightmare}}
