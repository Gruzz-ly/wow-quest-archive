== Objectives ==
Kill 6 Northspring Harpies and 6 Northspring Windcallers.
*[[Northspring Harpy]] slain (6)
*[[Northspring Windcaller]] slain (6)

== Description ==
In my day, I was a seasoned hunter. There wasn't any creature around that I feared. Until...

I was out in the forest, sharpening my blade after a tough battle, when I was ambushed. Harpies surrounded me, and I barely managed to drag myself to safety.

Even now, I can still hear their cries echoing...

I was never the same after that. But the hate boils inside of me -- I must get even, after all these years.

The Northspring harpies can be found to the west of here. <name>, get my revenge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
The wings of the Northspring harpies are black as the night; do not take your eyes off of them, lest they disappear into darkness.

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>. You have put an old tauren's mind at peace.

==Progression==
