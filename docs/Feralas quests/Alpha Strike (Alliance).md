==Objectives==
Kill 5 Woodpaw Alphas.
*[[Woodpaw Alpha]] slain (5)

==Description==
Never underestimate a threat. These [[gnoll]]s may seem like simple brutes, but there's animal cunning even among them.

The gnolls run as a pack, and every pack has Alphas: The biggest, strongest, and most ruthless members that claw their way to dominance. They're the ones giving orders, so they're the ones we're going to slay now.

They reside mostly around the [[Woodpaw Den]], pushing the others around. Get out there and push harder.

==Rewards==
You will receive
*{{cost||90}}
* 5,150 [[Experience point|XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
Perfect. Any gnolls left will be simple prey, lost in the woods.

Heh...here, soldier, take your reward before I get distracted. We've got other threats to deal with.

==Progression==
{{The Dragons of Nightmare}}
