== Objectives ==

Borrow a hippogryph from {{NPC||Dyslix Silvergrub}} and speak with {{NPC||Caryssia Moonhunter}} at [[New Thalanaar]] in [[Feralas]].
*Hippogryph to [[New Thalanaar]]

*Hippogryph to New Thalanaar

== Description ==
;Thyssiana:
We are staging a relief effort at New Thalanaar for all of [[Thousand Needles]]. The [[goblin]], Dyslix Silvergrub, will lend you my [[hippogryph]] to safely get you there. Speak with Caryssia Moonhunter when you land.

You must go quickly if lives are to be saved!

;Thyssiana:
{{NPC||Thyssiana}} sent you? Good! We need your help, now!

;Falfindel:
Falfindel Waywarder sent you? Good! We need your help, now! 

== Notes ==
This starts the [[Thousand Needles storyline]] from [[Mudsprocket]] in [[Dustwallow Marsh]] for the Alliance. Exit town to the north and turn right to reach Dyslix, the flight master, who has a new gossip option:

{{gossip|''Dyslix, I need to get to New Thalanaar!''}}

The hippogryph will fly up the new pass from Dustwallow to Thousand Needles, which is under water! It skims the surface crossing the zone, catching a glimpse of new [[Twilight's Hammer]] encampments on the southern rise. Finally reaching the border of Feralas, New Thalanaar has come under attack by {{NPC||Grimtotem Marauder}}s! Speak to Caryssia, who is immediately in front of the player.

If you are already in Feralas, a virtually identical quest can be picked up from {{npc||Falfindel Waywarder}}, who is in [[Shadebough]]. The hippogryph is provided by {{npc||Seyala Nightwisp}}{{coords|77.3|56.8|Feralas}} in that case.
