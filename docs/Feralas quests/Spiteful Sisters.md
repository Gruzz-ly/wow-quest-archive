==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Corrupted Dryad]]s.
*Corrupted Dryad slain (8)

==Description==
Something truly disturbing has occured{{sic}}. While on patrol, several of my scouts were ambushed by [[dryad]]s.

The dryads are close allies of the [[night elf|night elves]] and guardians of the forest. I assumed they were just frightened by the sight of [[worgen]], but the sentinels I sent out afterwards were also attacked.

Whatever is going on, I don't like it. I want you to go investigate as well. If even the dryads have been corrupted...put them to the sword.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50}}
*4,370 [[Experience point|XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
I didn't want to scare you, but this is a grave situation. If the portal at [[Dream Bough]] was sealed, and the corruption is still spreading...

==Notes==
After completing the quest, an image of [[Ysondre]] appears.
:{{text|say|Ysondre|[[Taerar]] has not fled Feralas. He acts as a conduit to the [[Emerald Nightmare|nightmare]] through his own form.}}
:{{text|say|Ysondre|I will run no longer. Seek me atop the [[Emerald Summit|peak]] to the east.}}
:''Ysondre disappears.''
