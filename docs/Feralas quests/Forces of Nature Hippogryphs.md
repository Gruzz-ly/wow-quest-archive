==Objectives==
Use [[Tessina's Whistle]] to rally 10 [[Frayfeather Hippogryph]]s.
*[[Hippogryph]]s Rallied (10)
*[[Tessina's Hippogryph Call]] (provided)

==Description==
Hippogryphs are majestic creatures. Some say they were created by [[Cenarius]] himself as a gift for the night elves. They're wary of other races, but they're intelligent enough to recognize a friend of a friend.

I need more hippogryphs here so we can begin training some of our newer archers to ride them. Take the whistle again and rally the Frayfeather hippogyphs{{sic}} in the grove just south of the [[Tower of Estulan]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3710 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
A properly trained squadron of [[hippogryph rider]]s can take on nearly any opposing force. [[Feathermoon Stronghold]] will be much safer with these noble beasts on our side.
