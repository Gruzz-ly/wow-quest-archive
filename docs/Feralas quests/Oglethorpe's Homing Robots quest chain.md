'''Oglethorpe's Homing Robots''' is not so much a chain of quests, as a series of prerequisites enabling a concluding quest.

In each of 3 zones, an OOX homing robot (which looks like a robotic chicken) has been lost and needs rescuing.

By hunting in each of these zones (for Tanaris, also in [[Zul'Farrak]]), you will eventually run across the corresponding homing beacon.

The easiest way to obtain the drop for the Tanaris escort quest is by doing [[Zul'Farrak]], however, if the object drops only one person can have it, so make sure you tell your group you need it before you enter the instance.

The object for the escort quest in The Hinterlands has the highest drop chance in [[Jintha'Alor]].

The object for the escort quest in Feralas is a random drop from any mob in that zone, so the best thing is just to do quests there.

Each homing beacon offers a quest to find the corresponding homing robot. Once you have found the robot, you are offered a quest to rescue it. These rescues involve following the robot to a point where it can take off on its own:
* In [[Feralas]], you follow the robot from inside the cave in [[Feral Scar Vale]] to the dock along the [[Forgotten Coast]].
* In the [[Hinterlands]], you follow the robot from just northeast of [[Agol'watha]] to the shore beyond the [[Overlook Cliffs]].
* In [[Tanaris]], you follow it from just east of the [[Gaping Chasm]] to [[Steamwheedle Port]].

Each time, the robot will be attacked twice or three times by groups of 3 or 4 (depending on the particular ambush) mobs.  Also, the robot will attract the attention of any wandering mobs along the way.

Complete all 3 escort and beacon missions, and [[Oglethorpe Obnoticus]] will reward you with a [[Mechanical Chicken|scale model]] of the OOX robot... With the combat and homing mechanisms disabled, of course.  Wouldn't want it pecking someone's eye out...
