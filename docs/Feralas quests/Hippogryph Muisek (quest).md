==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Frayfeather Hippogryph]]s of any type, then use the Hippogryph Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture them.
*[[Hippogryph Muisek]] (10)
*[[Hippogryph Muisek Vessel]] (provided)

==Description==
The next step is [[hippogryph]]s.

As [[Witch Doctor Uzer'i|Master Uzer'i]] always said, hippogryphs have been loyal companions to the [[night elf|night elves]] for many years, an' their spirits are loyal and steadfast.

I don't think they'll miss a few, and I don't care if they do. We need the muisek of 10 [[Frayfeather Hippogryph|frayfeather hippogryphs]] in the wilderness to the south.

==Progress==
Were you able to capture the hippogryphs?

==Completion==
Master always said "after killing an animal, if we allowed the [[muisek]] to escape, it may take the form of an even greater creature." This is dangerous stuff. Thanks for helping me with my studies.

==Notes==
You should be able to get a Muisek from any of the [[hippogryph]]s in Feralas. After you kill them, target the corpse and right-click on the [[Hippogryph Muisek Vessel]] in your inventory. Make sure you loot the corpse first because it will disappear once the vessel is used. There is a short cooldown on the vessel, so you it is recommended that you use it as you go rather than waiting until slaying multiple hippogryphs.
