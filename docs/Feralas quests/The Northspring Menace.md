==Objectives==
Kill 6 Northspring Harpies and 6 Northspring Windcallers.
*[[Northspring Harpy]] slain (6)
*[[Northspring Windcaller]] slain (6)

==Description==
My duty here is to watch over [[Telaron Windflight|Telaron]]. Even without his meditation leaving him vulnerable, there's enough threats in this forest to keep both of us on our toes.

That's why it maddens me so much that I don't have the opportunity to leave camp. More harpies than I've ever seen infest the northwest...foul creatures, spreading their filth across the ancient ruins uncaringly.

They're a threat to this camp, and have no place in these lands. I'll pay you well if you get rid of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*4350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. That's one less distraction for me.
