==Objectives==
Kill 7 Corrupted Cliff Giants.
*[[Corrupted Cliff Giant]] slain (7)

==Description==
The cliff giants of [[Feralas]] are extensions of the earth itself, <name>. When nature thrives, they are benevolent protectors and peaceful guardians.

But as the forest is tainted, so too are they.

If the corruption has spread to them, they will lash out at the wildlife and their own kind, causing great destruction. You must destroy any corrupted giants you come across.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Do not shy from the task, <class>. The giants are part of the great cycle as we all are, and they do not deserve this anguish.

==Completion==
The spirits of these guardians will return in time, <name>. You've freed them to move on in nature's cycle.

Now it falls to us to make sure that cycle is free of corruption and needless suffering.

==Progression==
{{Camp Ataya}}
