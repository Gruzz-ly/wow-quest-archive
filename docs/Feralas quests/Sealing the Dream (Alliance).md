==Objectives==
Use Ysondre's Tear to seal the portal at Dream Bough.
*Portal Sealed
*[[Ysondre's Tear]] (provided)

==Description==
It is ready. Take this, <name>; a beacon of natural essence, blessed by the will of [[Ysondre]].

To the north, on the other side of the flowing brook, is Dream Bough. There stands the Great Tree, the tallest in Feralas, a sapling of the very World Tree. A portal to the heart of the Emerald Dream sits in its trunk, and it is this portal you must seal.

The portal will be guarded, but you must be brave. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dream Bough Robes
|Belt of Natural Essence
|Chain of Natural Essence
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5|55|}}
*2,600 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Your bravery has seen us through! The Emerald Nightmare has been shut out from this land.

The fate of the dragon Taerar worries me...but there is much work still to be done. I cannot afford to dwell on it.
