==Objectives==
Kill 7 [[Mountain Giant (Feralas)|Mountain Giants]]. Use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture the fallen Mountain Giants. 
*[[Mountain Giant Muisek]] (7)
*[[Mountain Giant Muisek Vessel]] (provided)

==Description==
The mountain giants left the mountains to aid the [[Night elf|night elves]] when the [[Burning Legion]] appeared in [[Azeroth|the world]]. You will know them by their massive size and the way the ground begins to shake as you travel along their rocky terrain.

I am eager to harness power of that size. Kill 7 mountain giants, then use the muisek vessel to capture their powerful muisek.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3710 [[XP]] (or {{cost||28|20}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Were you able to capture the mountain giants? 

==Completion==
Just imagine the possibilities of what we now possess, <name>. Along with the materials that you have collected, I will be able to forever trap the [[muisek]] of these creatures into whatever I wish.

==Notes==
*In ''[[World of Warcraft: Classic|Classic]]'', the giants are [[elite]]. However, if [[Zapped Giants]] is taken alongside this quest, they can be turned into non-elites.

==Progression==
{{Weapons of Spirit}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Objective and description slightly updated. Line removed: "The last task I will require of you is to travel to the northwest and find the final enemy.".}}
