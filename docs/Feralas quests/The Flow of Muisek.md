==Objectives==
Deliver the Muisek Vessel to [[Witch Doctor Uzer'i]] at [[Camp Mojache]] in [[Feralas]].
*[[Hippogryph Muisek Vessel (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
I've done all I can for you. Muisek stronger than the hippogryph just isn't within my power to work with yet, so I won't make you deal with the disaster that could bring.

But while you've been busy, I've fully readied the hippogryph muisek. Take it to my master, Witch Doctor Uzer'i in Camp Mojache. He can create powerful weapons with it, and hopefully he'll be impressed by what I've done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20}}
*1850 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
I sense something familiar in your presence...

==Completion==
Well done indeed... I'd expect nothing less from my own daughter. She'll make a fine witch doctor someday.

==Progression==
{{Weapons of Spirit}}
