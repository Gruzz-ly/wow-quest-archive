==Objective==
Kill [[Bigfist]].
* Bigfist slain

==Description==
You may have seen this with your own eyes, but my longrunners have reported something disturbing to me. The [[Gordunni tribe|gordunni]] in the hills have captured an enormous sasquatch from the wilds.

I don't know how long it's been held, but [[ogre]]s are not ones for hobbies. I fear they plan to unleash the tortured beast on [[Camp Mojache]].

Return to the deepest corner of the Gordunni Outpost and slay the sasquatch, <name>. 

==Completion==
I will be able to rest easy now, <name>. You've saved our camp from a terrible menace
