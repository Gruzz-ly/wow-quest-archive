==Objectives==
Bring 20 Grimtotem Horns to [[Krueg Skullsplitter]] in [[Camp Mojache]].
* [[Grimtotem Horn]] (20)

==Description==
The [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem clan]]! Those gutless traitors are still lurking around here, eh...

You have to go back, <class>. Go back and bring me their horns... piles of them if you can. The Grimtotem are not to be trifled with or underestimated. Go back and slay them; let the rivers in [[Feralas]] run red with their dark blood.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45}}
* 6,420 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Take my words seriously, <class>, the Grimtotem clan is evil. If you've found their whereabouts, then it's up to you to return and strike the first blow against their clan... before they can come into our own lands and raze our own villages, or pilfer our lands.

==Completion==
Traitors to the [[Horde]] and traitors to their [[tauren|own people]]...

I guess they're not all bad. They'll make fine drinking flasks.
