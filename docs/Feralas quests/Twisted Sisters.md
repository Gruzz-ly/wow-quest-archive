== Objectives ==
Kill 7 Corrupted Dryads.
*[[Corrupted Dryad]] slain (7)

== Description ==
I have heard of your battle against the corrupted dragons, <name>, and I thank you for your courage... but I have disturbing news.

The [[dryad]]s of the forest, though allies of the Night Elves, have always passed us by in peace. But they have become cruel and twisted, attacking any who wander the eastern wilds.

I fear for the safety of the refugees here, <name>. Please, put a stop to these twisted dryads.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50}}
*4370 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
...

== Completion ==
I thank you, <name>, but the tale of your hunt troubles me. There should not be so many.

The sickness is still spreading...

== Trivia ==
*This Horde quest may have been intended to play a scripted event upon completion: The subsequent quest in this chain refers to an appearance by [[Ysondre]], and the Alliance equivalent [[Spiteful Sisters]] does indeed end with a vision of Ysondre summoning the adventurer.
*This quest's name may be a reference to the band {{wp|Twisted Sister}}.

== Progression ==
{{Weapons of Spirit}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
