==Objectives==
Find help in [[Razorfen Downs]]. 

==Description==
The [[Scourge]] are a direct affront to nature. They have managed to corrupt the [[Quilboar]] in Razorfen Downs and now threaten to spread further into [[Thousand Needles]] and eventually, I fear, west into [[Feralas]]. You must go there and do anything you can to confine them. Perhaps you can find someone in the area to help you? The winds whisper of a powerful presence in the area. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||27|75}}
* 260 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You seem an able warrior. Perhaps you can help me put an end to the terrible evil here.

==Patch changes==
