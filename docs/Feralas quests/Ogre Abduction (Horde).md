==Objectives==
Use the Modified Soulstone to capture a [[Gordok]] [[ogre]].
*[[Gordok Ogre-Mage|Gordok Ogre Mage]] Captured
*[[Modified Soul Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
There's no way the [[Gordunni]] made these. They're being supplied. Someone is giving them gifts of power, and we need to find out who.

The upper-class Gordok that guard [[Dire Maul]] will know more about this. [[Orhan Ogreblade|Orhan]] is no doubt having you thin their numbers, but I'll need one alive.

Take the orb back. It's similar to a [[:Soulstone]], so I've made some...adjustments. Hold it up in front of a weakened Gordok Ogre, and once you've captured him, bring it back here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Soulstealer's Bracers#Horde
|Shoulder of the Ogre-Nabber#Horde
|Abductor's Coverings#Horde
|Modified Spell Shield#Horde
|Spaulders of the Ogre-Nabber#Horde
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
Ahh, I can feel the whelp in there. Let's get him out and ask him some questions...

==Notes==
*At level 80 and higher can use the [[Soft Foam Sword]] to wound the ogre enough to capture it.
