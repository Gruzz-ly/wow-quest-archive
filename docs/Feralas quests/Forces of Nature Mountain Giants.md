==Objectives==
Use Jesana's Giant Call to rally 5 Mountain Giants.
*[[Mountain Giant (Feralas)|Mountain Giants]] Rallied (5)
*[[Jesana's Giant Call]] (provided)

==Description==
The mountain giants are our most powerful allies of the forest. They're carved from the land itself.

Not many of our enemies are willing to fight off a walking hillside. It only takes a few of these to turn the tide of a battle completely.

The mountain giants here have been afflicted by some illness lately, but I've seen a healthy group of them to the southwest.

==Completion==
Excellent!

<name>, you've helped bolster our forces here, and you've saved many of these forest creatures from the Horde as well. With our army now ready, [[Feathermoon Stronghold|Feathermoon]] will stand against all threats, Horde or otherwise!

On behalf of [[Shandris Feathermoon|Lady Feathermoon]], I'd like to award you with this weapon, fit for a [[Sentinel]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|20}}
