==Objectives==
Bring 20 Zukk'ash Carapaces to [[Hadoken Swiftstrider]] at [[Camp Mojache]], [[Feralas]].
* [[Zukk'ash Carapace]] (20)

==Description==
From what scouting we have managed to muster, we believe that the foe south of the gnolls is an insect-like race. Frankly, it is irrelevant whether or not if they're sentient. If they are driving the gnolls to frenzy against us, then they are as big of a threat - if not more - than the gnolls.

Drive deep into where these Zukk'ash insects dwell; it is known as the Writhing Deep. Thin their numbers and report back to me what you find, bringing back their carapaces as evidence of your handiwork.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45|}}
*3900 [[Experience point|XP]] (or {{cost||23|40}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt, <name>? Are you here to report your success?

==Completion==
Well done, <class>. Though the extensiveness of the Zukk'ash presence will not be thwarted with anything less than a full-scale invasion, you have bought us some time so we can devise a proper strategy.

I will be sure to have these carapaces analyzed; we'll need to learn everything about them before we deal with what has unfortunately turned into a much larger issue than we had anticipated.
