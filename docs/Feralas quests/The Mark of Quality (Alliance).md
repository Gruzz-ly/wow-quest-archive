==Objectives==
Bring 10 Thick Yeti Hides to [[Pratt McGrubben]] in [[Feathermoon Stronghold]]. 
*[[Thick Yeti Hide]] (10)

==Description==
My philosophy on [[leatherworking]] is that the work must be the best quality possible - no compromises. Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter is trying to sell you ocean-front property in [[Dun Morogh]]!

In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have run across thick yeti hides. The Yeti are native to [[Feralas]], with many found in [[Rage Scar Hold]] to the northeast. I want some, and I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten. If that sounds fair, then we're in business.  

==Reward==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pratt's Handcrafted Boots
|Pratt's Handcrafted Gloves
|Pratt's Handcrafted Greaves
|Pratt's Handcrafted Gauntlets
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*6,010 [[XP]] (or {{cost||24|60}} at max level)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
A stack of ten thick yeti hides will net you a choice of one of my crafted items.  Because I care about quality, I am able to ensure you'll get a good item!  

==Completion==
Did you stop and examine the texture of these hides?  Properly treated, these hides could very well be stronger than [[iron]].  Not many people know about these hides, and that in combination with the vast treating solutions I know will allow me to potentially make items with a true mark of quality... thanks to you, of course!

And now, please choose from what I am able to offer you for your service! 

==Notes==
These are a drop from the yetis, as well as being obtained while skinning (with what appears to be a 100% result for skinning), meaning a yeti kill can yield 2 hide's for a skinner.
