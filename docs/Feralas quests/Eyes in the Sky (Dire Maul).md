==Objectives==
Speak to the [[Druid of the Talon (Dire Maul)|Druid of the Talon]].

==Description==
The most dire, and most organized, threat to us in [[Feralas]] are the Gordok ogres in the northern wing of [[Dire Maul]]. I requested a [[druid of the talon]] to go there and scout it out. If he still lives, speak with him and he will act as your commander to stop the Gordok before they decide to attack.

That's an order, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||7|}}

==Completion==
Speak softly, <name>. The Gordok may not be intelligent, but they are still dangerous warriors.
