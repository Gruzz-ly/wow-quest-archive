==Objectives==
Speak to the [[Stonemaul Ogre (Dire Maul)|Stonemaul Ogre]]. 

==Description==
The most dire, and most organized, threat to us in Feralas are the [[Gordok]] ogres in the northern wing of [[Dire Maul]]. If we eradicate them and take [[Dire Maul]] for the [[Horde]], we will possess a heavily fortified seat of power in this region with numerous artifacts to sweeten the deal. I sent in a small army of [[Stonemaul clan|Stonemaul Ogres]] inside earlier - if any have survived, speak with them and finish the job.

That's an order, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||7|}}

==Completion==
These ogres no pushovers. I need you help me finish Orhan's task, <race>.
