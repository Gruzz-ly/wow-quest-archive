==Objectives==
Use the Modified Soulstone to capture a Gordok ogre.
* Gordok Ogre-Mage Captured
* [[Modified Soul Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
This is neither a crude [[Ogre]] trinket, nor an ancient relic made by my kind. Its specific construction is new to me...and this fact disturbs me greatly.

The [[Silvia|wolf-girl]] will be sending you to [[Dire Maul]] soon, to fight the [[Gordok]] elite. They are the leaders of the Gordunni, and would know who is supplying these.

Take the orb back, I've cast a few enchantments on it. Hold it up in front of a weakened Gordok ogre, and once you've captured him, bring it back here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Soulstealer's Bracers
|Shoulder of the Ogre-Nabber
|Abductor's Coverings
|Modified Spell Shield
|Spaulders of the Ogre-Nabber
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
Ah, you've brought him. Now I merely have to suffer the fate of speaking to him. 

==Notes==
*At level 80 and higher can use the [[Soft Foam Sword]] to wound the ogre enough to capture it.
