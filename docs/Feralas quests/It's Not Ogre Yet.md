==Objectives==
Kill 5 Gordunni Hillguards.
*[[Gordunni Hillguard]] slain (5)

==Description==
We dealt the Gordunni ogres a large blow at [[Dire Maul]], but we haven't quite finished the job. My scouts have reported a group of them amassed in the hills to the north, gathering for some reason.

It's possible they're interested in the [[Horde]] [[Stonemaul Hold|settlement]] nearby, but I don't want to take any chances. Scout the area, kill any ogres you come across, and report back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||45}}
*4,140 [[Experience point|XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
It's good to see you back. We've learned more about the ogre situation.

==Progression==
{{The Dragons of Nightmare}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
