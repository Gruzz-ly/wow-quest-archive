==Objectives==
Kill 5 Woodpaw Alphas.
* [[Woodpaw Alpha]] slain (5)

==Description==
Gnolls are unfortunately as resilient as they are brutish and stupid. I have driven back the gnolls time after time from our camp, and it is only our chieftain's mercy that prevents them from being wiped out entirely.

Over the years, it has fallen into a dance of strength and dominance. When their numbers surge and they threaten the camp, the alphas, the strongest gnolls, must be slain.

This will drive them back into the forest, and leave us is peace until they forget their lessons. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45}}
* 4,900 [[Experience point|XP]]
* 150 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Completion==
You've done as I have asked, and for that I salute you. Take this small reward as compensation for your efforts, &lt;name&gt;.
With their numbers thinned and their leaders slain, the gnolls will think twice about storming the camp. This doesn't conclude the issue at hand, however...

There must be some reason why the gnolls have been whipped into such a frenzied state. Before they have a chance to regroup though, I want to find out what is causing it.
