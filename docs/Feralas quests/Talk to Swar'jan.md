==Objectives==
Deliver the Gordunni Orb to [[Swar'jan]] in [[Stonemaul Hold]].
*[[Gordunni Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
We're lucky and unlucky here, grunt. Lucky that I had you bother to bring this back, and unlucky that my suspicions turned out to hold water. This thing's full of corrupted stench.

It's far too new to be something fished out of the ruins, either. Someone is supplying these ogres, and we need to know who before this becomes a situation.

Get that filthy thing upstairs to Swar'jan, the warlock on top of the guard tower. He's good for a few ideas; I'd listen to his suggestions, if I were you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20}}
* 1,850 [[Experience point|XP]] {{cost||40|}}

==Completion==
What've you got for me here? You said the Gordunni had this?

Disgusting...

==Progression==
{{The Gordunni Threat}}
