==Objectives==
Bring the Darkmist Amulet to [[Vestia Moonspear]] at the [[Tower of Estulan]].
*[[Darkmist Amulet]] (provided)

==Description== 
The soft glow from the pedestal brightens, and you can see a simple chain left behind. Is this what the apprentice was searching for?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4,600 [[Experience point|XP]] {{cost||80|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
You're back... and without him...

==Completion==
How horrible... for someone so young and full of promise to fall to demons!

I beg your forgiveness for sending you into danger as well, <name>. I hope you don't cross paths with that demoness again...

==Progression==
{{Freed}}
