==Objectives==
Collect 10 Water Elemental Cores from the [[Sea Elemental]]s and [[Sea Spray]]s.
*[[Water Elemental Core]] (10)

==Description==
If I bet against my own better judgment and stay to run an engineering shop along the Forgotten Coast, I will need to deal with these pesky elementals. Curse the powers of elementalism unchecked, I say!

Fortunately for me, and now for you my hopeful agent provocateur, the elementals represent an ideal source of raw power for my Ultra-Shrinker refinement - give them the what-for I say! When doing this though, be sure to save me the water elemental cores!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*[[Zorbin's Water Resistant Hat]]

==Progress==
While I could bore you with the technical details of the utility behind elemental cores, I will instead tempt you to completion of this important task by offering valuable coin and prizes for doing so.  Yon verily, are you finished?

==Completion==
Scrumdillyriffic!  These cores will keep me working for some time.  Add to that the benefit of there now being fewer elementals along the coast, and I might no longer cry myself to sleep at the prospect of having set up shop in perhaps the worst place imaginable!

Thank you, <name>, for your efforts on my behalf.  While it certainly straps me financially to do this, allow me to show you some gratitude you may understand and appreciate... loot!
