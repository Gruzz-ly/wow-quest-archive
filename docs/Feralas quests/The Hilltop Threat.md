==Objectives==
Kill 5 Gordunni Hillguards.
*[[Gordunni Hillguard]] slain (5)

==Description==
I am proud of [[Camp Mojache|Mojache]]'s reputation as a safe haven in the wilds of [[Feralas]], but the camp faces many threats. The [[Gordunni]] ogres gather nearby in the northern foothills, claiming their territory and despoiling the wildlife.

With the arrival of our brothers and sisters seeking shelter, I cannot let them linger any more. Go north and drive the ogres out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45}}
*4140 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>, but there is more work to be done to keep the camp safe. Listen further.
