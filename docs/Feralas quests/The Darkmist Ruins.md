== Objectives ==
Search the [[Darkmist Ruins]] for the amulet {{NPC||Sage Palerunner}} described. 

== Description ==
I have been beset by visions, <class>. Visions of an icon of great power falling into sinister hands. I see an amulet, held by the ancient elves...sitting forgotten while its surroundings turn to ruins, until it is captured by [[demon]]s through treachery and malice.

Every night, these sights flow through my dreams. The spirits are warning us. I am too old, and the camp's [[brave]]s too occupied with guarding us. I must beseech you to follow my visions to the south, to the Darkmist Ruins, and seek out the amulet.

== Completion ==
<As you reach towards the pedestal, you find it empty. A chill fills the room, and you hear a faint voice...>
