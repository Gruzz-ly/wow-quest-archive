==Objectives==
Look for the Lost Apprentice in the [[Darkmist Ruins]].

==Description==
If you have a moment, <class>...

One of the students I was teaching has gone to explore the [[Darkmist Ruins]] to the south by himself. I warned him that it was too dangerous, but he was too excited to listen. I had spoken with him earlier about an amulet that is concealed within those ruins. Now, I fear that he may have run off in search of it, because of me...

{{NPC||Estulan}} has forbidden us to pursue him. If you go there, could you please look for him?

<The apprentice's body is cold. He has been dead for a while.>

* 3,710 [[Experience point|XP]]
