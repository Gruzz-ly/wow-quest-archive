==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ysondre]] at the [[Emerald Summit]] in the [[Lower Wilds]].

==Description==
The dragons of nature... Heed her call, <name>. Do not linger here. Her request for your aid is both a great honor and an omen of terrible danger.

The place she spoke of is called the Emerald Summit. A path off the main road through the Lower Wilds leads up one of the high stone plateaus; you will find a small shrine at the top.

All of [[Feralas]] may rest upon your shoulders. May the [[Earth Mother]] watch over you.

==Completion==
You've come.

I am ashamed to ask this of you, <class>, but I've ran from him long enough. [[Taerar]] must be stopped.

==Progression==
{{Weapons of Spirit}}
