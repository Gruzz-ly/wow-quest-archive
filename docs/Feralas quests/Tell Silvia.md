==Objectives==
Talk to {{NPC||Silvia}} at the [[Tower of Estulan]]. 

==Description==
It seems we've found an infestation far worse than the one we expected. Cho'gall is no doubt trying to use the Gordok to gain access to the remnants of Eldre'thalas within [[Dire Maul]], full of the forbidden powers that brought the downfall of the [[Shen'dralar]]...

I am rambling. Leave me, <name>. Tell Silvia of what you've learned. Whatever is occuring in Dire Maul must be stopped. 

==Completion==
You're back. What did Estulan say?
