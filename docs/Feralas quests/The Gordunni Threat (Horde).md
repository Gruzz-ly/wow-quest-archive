==Objective==
Kill 16 [[Gordunni tribe|Gordunni]] [[Ogre]]s in the [[High Wilderness]].
* Gordunni Ogre Slain (16)

==Description==
Within the High Wilderness to the south lay countless ancient ruins. It's there that the ancestors of the [[Night elf|night elves]] fooled about with [[arcane]] magic, and it's there that the Gordunni ogres wander, searching for leftover scraps.

You'll notice the forest is completely destroyed in that area; the ogres leave only useless muck in their wake, depriving the [[Horde]] of valuable resources.

Go and slay the Gordunni there, <name>. Secure the area for the Horde, and only for the Horde! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
The ruins are right to the south, <name>. Don't dwindle.

==Completion==
You have proven yourself to be a trustworthy and dependable ally, <name>. 

==Progression==
{{The Gordunni Threat}}
