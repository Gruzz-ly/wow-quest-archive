I've discovered a brood of dragon whelps gathered off the road to the north with a similar affliction.Green dragons are sacred custodians of nature. The fact that this disease is capable of spreading to them is cause for great alarm.

:''[[Ysondre]] appears in front of Telaron.''
:{{text|say|Ysondre|Your sincerity is moving, druid.}}
