==Objectives==
Use [[Tessina's Whistle]] to rally 6 [[Wandering Forest Walker]]s.
*[[Treant]]s Rallied (6)
*[[Tessina's Treant Call]] (provided)

==Description==
Some people think treants are good for little more than fetching drinks in a war. Most of them haven't seen an entire defensive line scattered by what they thought was cover.

And have you ever seen a peon try to chop one down and get surprised? I was in tears...

At any rate, they're immensely valuable allies. You'll find some wandering just outside the [[Tower of Estulan]] and more in forest to the east, just southeast of [[Dire Maul]]. Be on the lookout for the [[Horde]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3710 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
They may not look it, but some treants grow to be ancient protectors. We could use a few more of those around here...
