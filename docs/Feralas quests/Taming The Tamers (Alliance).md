==Objectives==
Kill 6 Gordunni Tamers.
*[[Gordunni Tamer]] slain (6)

==Description==
The sasquatch may be a larger threat, but we also need to wipe out the [[ogre]]s. The [[Gordunni tribe|Gordunni]] have been a nuisance to us for too long, and [[Shandris Feathermoon|Lady Shandris]] wants them completely gone. Let's hope these are the last ones.

Kill the Gordunni tamers that keep the beast chained, and make sure they know the price of their meddling.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||45}}
*4,140 [[Experience point|XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Good work, and good riddance. I hope we never have to see another ogre here again!

==Progression==
{{The Dragons of Nightmare}}
