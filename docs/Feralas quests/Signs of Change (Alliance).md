==Objectives==
Collect 8 Infected Stag Antlers.
*[[Infected Stag Antler]] (8)

==Description==
A severe illness has fallen over the creatures of this forest. While at first I hoped it was part of nature's course, it has refused to pass.

The forest stags, normally strong and serene, have suffered the worst. Some waste away in weakness; others froth and rage dangerously. If I am to consult the spirits to learn more of this sickness, I will need the stags' antlers.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progress==
This is a sad task, <name>, but necessary. 

==Completion==
At the very least, these creatures' suffering has ended. Let us hope their sacrifice will bring a stop to further pain.

==Progression==
{{Dreamer's Rest}}
