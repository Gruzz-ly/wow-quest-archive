== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Edana Hatetalon.jpg|Edana Hatetalon|Search for the Hatetalon stones, then blast the horn. She will come.}}
[[Talo Thornhoof]] in [[Camp Ataya]] wants [[Edana Hatetalon]]'s Dark Heart.
* [[Edana's Dark Heart]]

== Description ==
Edana Hatetalon is the queen of the [[Northspring]] harpies that reside in the ruins to the west. She is pure evil; I have heard that her heart is one of crystal. She is void of any emotion aside from the hate she feels towards all others. You must face Edana and bring me back her dark heart.

I have heard of a horn that [[harpy|harpies]] carry—blowing it by the Hatetalon stones, in the northern part of the ruins, will summon the queen.

Imagine her surprise when it is not her kin calling her, but her death.

==Rewards==
[[Image:Hatetalon Stones.jpg|thumb|Hatetalon Stones]]
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dark Crystal Waistband
|Bracers of the Captured Heart
|Captured Heart Bindings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

== Progress ==
The hate that Edana spreads across the land must be stopped.

== Completion ==
Now I know that Edana is truly dead. This heart; I will keep it in memory of what did here for me, <name>. Thank you.

==Notes==
You kill harpies in northwest [[Feralas]] until they drop the [[Horn of Hatetalon]]. The horn must be used near the Hatetalon stones, which are in the north-western edge of the ruins. They are two tall conical stones with a path running between them, and lanterns lining the path. The stones don't show a name when you hover over them.{{co|40|9|Feralas (Classic)}}
