==Objectives==
Bring 10 Iridescent Sprite Darter Wings to [[Krueg Skullsplitter]] in [[Camp Mojache]].
* [[Iridescent Sprite Darter Wing]] (10)

==Description==
Well met, <class>. I've traveled with my companions down to [[Feralas]] on a mission for our [[Orgrimmar]] masters.

My life-mate [[Korrin]] finds great pleasure in new clothing, so I aim to make her a new cloak adorned with the gossamer wings of [[faerie dragon]]s. Would you be able to help me? [[Sprite Darter|Sprite darter]]s with the gorgeous wings I want are west of Camp Mojache.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45|}}
*6,420 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
The sprite darters can be dangerous critters when provoked. Be careful when dealing with them, <class>. And be even more careful of any [[Night elf|night elves]] in the area. The pestering fools tend to hold up in the forests also.

When you've gotten enough of the wings, let me know, I'll be sure to reward you well!

==Completion==
Wonderful, <class>! These will do nicely. There are enough here to make a cloak for Korrin, and possibly even more! Thank you.

I hope the trip wasn't too dangerous? The area of Feralas is not known for being forgiving, but you've obviously done well enough.

Thank you again, <class>.
