==Objectives== 
Kill 6 Gordok Enforcers and 6 Gordok Ogre-Mages.
* [[Gordok Enforcer]] slain (6)
* [[Gordok Ogre-Mage]] slain (6)

==Description==
With the nearby [[ogre]]s dealt with, we should take the offensive and press our attack into their territory.

The [[Gordok]] ogres are the head of the [[Gordunni clan]], ruling them from the ruins now called [[Dire Maul]]. They are stronger than the lesser Gordunni, but I have no doubt you can handle them, <name>. They won't know what hit them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||40}}
* 25406 [[Experience point|XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Pressing our attack to Dire Maul is vital. [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] herself taught me how to coordinate an attack...

==Completion==
Wonderful! Everything's going according to plan. Lady Shandris will be pleased.

==Progression==
{{The Gordunni Threat}}

==Patch changes==
