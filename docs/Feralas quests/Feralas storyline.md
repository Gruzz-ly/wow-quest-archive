# Feralas storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Feralas.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

'''[[Feralas]]''' is a level 15 - 30 zone in southwestern [[Kalimdor]] for both the [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]]. It follows pretty much the same story for both sides, with the Alliance starting at [[Dreamer's Rest]] and the Horde going to [[Camp Ataya]]. From there, they go to [[Feathermoon Stronghold]] and [[Stonemaul Hold]], respectively. For the Horde, they go to their last hub in the zone, [[Camp Mojache]], while the Alliance stops at The [[Tower of Estulan]] before meeting up with [[Adella]] in [[Shadebough]].

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Feralas Quests]].
