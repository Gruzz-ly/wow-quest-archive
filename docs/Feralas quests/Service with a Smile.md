==Objectives==
Sell Invincible's Reins to [[Gott Weedlespan]] for [[Johnny Awesome]].

* Invincible's Reins sold {{co|70.8|73.1|Feralas}}
* [[Bulging Sack of Gold (quest item)]]
* [[Invincible's Reins (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Oh, simple <race>. Simple, simple <race>.

I did not 'forget' to sweep up those reins from that foolish cakewalk of a [[knight]] they call the [[Lich King]]. I simply did not bother, as I already received the mighty steed during my [[raid]] last week.

<Johnny motions to [[Spooky|the horse]] on his left.>

Since you're here and clearly intrigued by my sweltering greatness, won't you take that superfluous stallion to the assistant resort director in town? My coffers could use a bit of extra lining.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do not tarry, <class>. The longer you take, the longer until you may dote on me as one of my many admirers.

==Completion==
<Johnny raises his arm exaggeratedly, glancing at his naked wrist.>

My, my, quite the LETHARGIC [[adventurer]], aren't you? That just might cover my repair bills from the many [[dungeon]]s I've plundered.

==Notes==
Being hostile with [[Gadgetzan]] won't allow you obtain the quest item required for this quest.

;Interacting with Gott
:<Gott sneers contemptuously at you.>
:Can you possibly work any slower? I'm surrounded by useless idiots!
:{{Gossip|I... have to sell this horse to you.}}
: Woah, man, are you sure? This ain't some sort of prank?
:{{Gossip|Unfortunately, yes.}}
