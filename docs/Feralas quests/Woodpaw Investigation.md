==Objectives==
Find the [[gnoll]] battle plans somewhere in the gnoll camps to the south of [[Camp Mojache]].

==Description==
Gnolls aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, but they will no doubt have some sort of documented strategy on their recent activity. If we were to find those plans, then we'd have a clearer idea of what is making them so worked up.

I want you to head back to the [[Woodpaw]] and find anything that might resemble their battle plans. They have to have something; their attacks have been too coordinated to be done without them. Find them, and return to me when you have them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Examining the map reveals it to be the battle plans that [[Hadoken Swiftstrider]] wants.  Numerous arrows that perhaps represent troop movements are drawn on the map, though most seem to be headed toward the south rather than to the north where Camp Mojache lies.

Another section of the map has a picture of what you think is a large insect of some kind, with various tick marks under it.  From the looks of the gnolls, it perhaps represents their losses against the unknown bugs...
