==Objectives==
Disrupt [[Cho'Gall]]'s Twilight Sermon.
*Sermon disrupted

==Description==
So the [[Twilight's Hammer]] thinks it can just raise its own army of ogres here? In the middle of Horde territory?

We'll see about that.

Ogres only respect one thing: strength. I want you to lead the assault on Cho'gall's sermon, <name>. Throw wide the doors of Dire Maul, leap into the arena, and cut down his attendants.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sermon-Halter Gloves
|Ogre's Coif
|Stonemaul Slinger
|Ogre's Visage
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
We've done it! Cho'gall himself has been utterly humiliated by you. His minions are dead, the Gordok are scattered, and now all will know the might of the Horde! Lok'tar, <name>. You've more than earned your reward.

==Notes==
;Approach the arena
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|The sun of life will set forever, as light gives away to eternal night. (Oblivion looms, it calls!)}}
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|The Twilight's Hammer is the instrument of this grand destruction, the method of glorious annihilation! (Tear aside the veil! Open your mind to emptiness!) Through us will you find true power.}}
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Join us (Join us!) and be granted strength beyond strength! (Strength! His STRENGTH! His MIGHT!)}}

Cho'gall is accompanied by [[Durk the Earthmauler]], [[Moltar the Burning]], [[Glak the Quenched]], and [[Braz the Windreaver]]. A group of [[Gordunni Onlooker]]s are watching A [[Glacial Exile]], [[Thundering Windfury]], [[Burning Exile (Feralas)|Burning Exile]], and [[Rumbling Betrayer]] attacking the projected glove of Azeroth.

;Jumped into the arena

:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Prove yourselves, my ogres! Slay this insect! (Blood for the master! Blood and suffering!)}}

;Both ogres slain
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Enough! I'll stain my hands with your blood! (Hyehahahaha! Murder, MURDER!)}}
:''Cho'gall and two more of his disciples jump down into the arena and freezes the adventurer. He begins to cast a powerful spell, but is interrupted.''

:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Enjoy your hollow victory, insects. (The darkness comes...) May it console you as your world rots.}}
:''Cho'gall teleports away. Orhan and her Stonemaul forces walk towards the exit of the Maul and despawn.''
