==Objectives== 
Kill 16 Gordunni ogres in the High Wilderness.
* [[Gordunni]] [[Ogre]] slain  (16)

==Description==
{{NPC||Estulan}}, the [[Highborne]] up in the [[Tower of Estulan|tower]], is reclusive. I haven't been able to speak to him very much. He has, however, told me that the ruins of the [[High Wilderness]] to the south are full of Gordunni ogres.

The ogres are not only a threat, they're destroying any forest and wildlife nearby. Estulan has also warned me of what might happen if they discover any artifacts of Highborne power among the ruins...

Head south, <name>, and slay any Gordunni you find!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||80}}
* 4,600 [[Experience point|XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
If we do this, Estulan's mages will be able to help the Sentinels.

==Completion==
It sounds like there were more than we thought! Thank you for your brave work, <name>.
