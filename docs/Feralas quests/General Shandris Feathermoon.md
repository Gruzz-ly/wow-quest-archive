== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Shandris Feathermoon}} at [[Feathermoon Stronghold]] in [[Feralas]]. 

== Description ==
We druids do not keep very close company with the Sentinel army, but we are always willing to work together to defend our lands. Now that you have assisted me, I would be remiss in not requesting you assist them as well.

Shandris Feathermoon, general of the [[Sentinels]], commands the war effort for all of Kalimdor from the newly built Feathermoon Stronghold to the south. Tell her I sent you; I am sure she will have need of your skills.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Telaron Windflight||Telaron}} has already sent word of you, <name>. I'm interested in seeing if you're half as skilled as he claims.

I am fighting a war on multiple fronts, while keeping our currently held areas properly defended, as well as overseeing the instruction of our youngest sentinels. If you're a decent fighter, there will be plenty for you to do.

==Notes==

After completing the quest, [[Adella]], [[Silvia]] and [[Tambre]] will spawn, walk to Shandris and kneel in front of her.
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Your training has progressed well, sisters. It won't be long before you lead your [[Moonclaw Warrior|own people]], with no further need of my teaching.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|It is time for you to show me that leadership. Tambre, you will spearhead the offensive on Sardor Isle. Your ferocity will be needed there.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Silvia, I'm sending you to the Tower of Estulan to drive out the Gordunni ogres. Your diplomacy and strategy will both be put to the test.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Adella, you will strike out far to the east. Our forces must retake the eastern wilds, and observe the Horde unseen. May your judgment be as keen as your marksmanship.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I expect much of you. Do not fail me. Dismissed!}}

The three new [[Sentinels]] will then stand up and run away to their tasks.
