== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Chief Spirithorn}} in [[Camp Mojache]]. 

== Description ==
With that, I am the only one left.

Even if I choose to remain in this world, I cannot rejoin the green flight. But this victory gives me hope. Perhaps, in time, I can find peace in a simple life among mortals.

You must return to your people. Tell them that the dragons of nightmare are gone, and will no longer threaten these lands.

== Completion ==
You are truly blessed by the [[Earth Mother]], <name>, to have the honor of fighting with the guardians of nature, and to also survive it.

Know that you have kept safe every living soul in this camp, and possibly this entire forest. Take these gifts with my deepest thanks. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1}}
