==Objectives==
Speak to [[Furgus Warpwood]].

==Description==
Just inside the eastern wing of [[Dire Maul]] one of the warpwood ancients, [[Furgus Warpwood]], still lives uncorrupted. You must travel there and help him drive out the terrible creatures that have taken it as their own. Taking [[Dire Maul]] would be a major step in reclaiming [[Feralas]] for our people.

You can find [[Dire Maul]] to the southeast of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||5|}}

==Completion==
Have you been in contact with a [[druid of the talon]] recently, <class>? I can feel the lingering presence of one.
