==Objectives==
Find someone who can repair the Corroded G-7 C.O.R.E Processor.
*[[Corroded G-7 C.O.R.E. Processor]] (provided)

==Description==
This C.O.R.E. unit definitely fits the description that Ziri gave you, but it's badly damaged and covered in gunk. You can barely make out a faded sticker with what appears to be contact information for some sort of warranty. Only a few letters are visible. "Limi... arranty... claims contac.... Wi..... nde...ar"

==Progress==
When someone builds a tower and workshop on top of a giant spire in the middle of nowhere, it's almost like they don't want unexpected visitors. Who'd have thought?

==Completion==
<Wirdal's magnifying goggles make a low mechanical buzzing noise as they focus on the Corroded G-7 C.O.R.E. Processor in your hand> Indeed, that's one of mine.

I strongly suggest that you throw that thing into the ocean and never think of it again.

==Notes==
*In order to complete this quest, you must first speak to [[Ziri "The Wrench" Littlesprocket]] in [[Gnomeregan (Season of Discovery)|Gnomeregan]], and then complete [[Scooty]]'s quest [[Quadrangulation]] in [[Booty Bay]] to teleport to Wirdal's hideout.

Dialogue:
{{dialogue|
Why are you sitting here talking to me? <Ziri makes a shooting motion with her hands>

You got a job to do, last I checked.

{{gossip|I found this G-7 Unit, will this do?}}

Uh, no. This thing looks like it's about to turn to dust in your hand. I need a PRISTINE G-7 C.O.R.E Processor

{{gossip|It looks like there's an inscription on it, but I can't make it out. <Show Ziri the text on the unit>}}

It's tough to make out, but I don't need to be able to read it to tell you that this was made by [[Wirdal Wondergear]]. Everyone knows Wirdal. He's probably the most well-known computational engineer in Gnomeregan. Real hardcore dude.

{{gossip|Do you think he could fix this? Where is he now?}}

Well if anyone could fix this, it would be him. As for where he is, no clue. I know that when things started going pear-shaped in here he was able to make it out with some other refugees. Last I heard he was staying in [[Booty Bay]]. I heard that there was a [[Scooty|goblin engineer]] there working on a new type of teleporter pad. I'm sure that would have caught Wirdal's interest, he was a bit of a pioneer in teleportation tech. Maybe he's still there, or one of the goblins will know where he ended up.}}
