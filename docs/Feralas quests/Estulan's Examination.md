==Objectives==
Deliver the Gordunni Orb to [[Estulan]].
*[[Gordunni Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
He's right. I haven't been among the Night elves long, but I can tell these markings are completely unlike any kaldorei decorations...

Estulan needs to see this. Take this up the tower to him. He may be surly, but don't be dissuaded; once he sees the orb, he'll realize it's an important issue.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||20}}

==Progress==
What is that you're holding?

==Completion==
Ahh, the orb I mentioned before. A decent reason to disturb me.

==Progression==
{{The Gordunni Threat}}
