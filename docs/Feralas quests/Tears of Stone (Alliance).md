==Objectives==
Collect 7 Stonetears.
*[[Stonetear]] (7)

==Description==
As you witnessed, the [[dragon]] [[Ysondre]] has told us that the tears of the land can seal the portal from which this corruption stems.

Her words ring true; in the glade to the west, I have seen the mountain giants distraught. They raged in frustration and wept, and their tears fell upon the stones as shining crystals.

Though the giants weep no more, these stonetears must be what Ysondre referred to. We must gather them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
The tears are among the very rocks that the giants themselves rise from. There should be loose ones near the base of these large monoliths.

==Completion==
The mountain giants are precious allies of our race. We must stop this corruption before it claims any more creatures of the forest.

==Progression==
