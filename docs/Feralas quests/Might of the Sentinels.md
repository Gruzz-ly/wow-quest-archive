==Objectives==
Disrupt Cho'Gall's Twilight Sermon.
* Sermon disrupted

==Description==
The [[Twilight's Hammer clan|Twilight's Hammer]]? Here?

This is far more serious than I expected. We've got to put a stop to this. I don't know if I'm ready to lead such an offensive, but I'm not about to let my fears get in the way of what needs to be done!

I will rally our forces from [[Feathermoon Stronghold]]. Head to [[Dire Maul]], make your way to the arena, and disrupt [[Cho'gall]]'s activities; we will launch our attack during the confusion. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sermon-Halter Gloves
|Sentinel's Headpiece
|Shadowleaf Bow
|Sentinel's Headgear
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Hurry, <name>! Cho'gall may not be there much longer!

==Completion==
Welcome back from the battle! The [[Twilight's Hammer]] have been disgraced in the eyes of the [[Gordunni]], and driven from [[Feralas]].

We've shown the glory of the [[Alliance]] in full force today! Be proud!
