This quest is the culmination of a couple different quest lines from [[Witch Doctor Uzer'i]]. Completion of [[Natural Materials]] and the Muisek chain allow you to receive this quest and your choice of one of four rare weapons.

==Objectives==
Witch Doctor Uzer'i wants you to wait for a moment while he prepares the weapons.

==Description==
Imbuing the muisek into the weapons is a difficult process. Now that I have all of the required materials and the muisek of the creatures that you captured, I may begin. Please wait; I will return in a moment.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Power of the Hippogryph
|Power of the Mountain Giant
|Power of the Faerie Dragon
|Power of the Treant
|Power of the Forest
}}

You will also receive:
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Did you get it yet?

==Completion==
As promised, you have your choice, <name>. The muisek of the creatures has been forever sealed into the power of these weapons.

You may now wield their energy as your own. Use it well.
