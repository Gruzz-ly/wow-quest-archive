==Objectives==
Speak with [[Chief Spirithorn]] in [[Camp Mojache]].

==Description==
You've done a hell of a job here, <name>. With the [[Twilight's Hammer]] shamed and the [[Gordunni]] left bleeding and broken, we'll be able to set our sights on the true battle with the [[Alliance]] here.

It'll take time to build our forces enough to match the night elves infesting this place. I'm sending you ahead to Camp Mojache to the east; they've got problems of their own, and we can't let any Horde territory fall here.

Lok'tar!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*2900 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Completion==
I am thankful you've come, <class>. Our camp is beset by many perils, and yet we must tend to those fleeing the devastation of the [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]].

If there is to be any refuge here, you must help us.
