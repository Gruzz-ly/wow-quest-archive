==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ysondre]] atop the [[Emerald Summit]] in the [[Lower Wilds]].

==Description==
A dragon of the [[emerald dream]]... what have you gotten yourself involved in, <name>?

I wouldn't keep her waiting if I were you. The place she spoke of is what we call the Emerald Summit. A path off the main road through the Lower Wilds leads up one of the high stone plateaus; there's a small shrine at the top.

Good luck, <name>. I hope to see you back safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,150 [[Experience point|XP]]

==Completion==
You've come.

I am ashamed to ask this of you, <class>, but I've ran from him long enough. Taerar must be stopped.

==Progression==
{{The Dragons of Nightmare}}

==Patch changes==
