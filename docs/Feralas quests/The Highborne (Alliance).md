==Objectives==
Speak to [[Estulan]].

==Description==
[[Estulan]], a powerful and uncorrupt [[Highborne]], has managed to enter the western wing of [[Dire Maul]] and has asked for assistance in cleansing it. Regardless of your personal convictions of the [[Highborne]], it is an effort I must support for the good of [[Feralas]]. May the wind carry your spirit there with great swiftness.

You will find [[Dire Maul]] to the southeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

==Completion==
I sensed your coming all the way from [[Dreamer's Rest]]. Your assistance would be most welcome.
