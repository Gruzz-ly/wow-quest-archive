==Objectives==
Kill Stinglasher in the [[Writhing Deep]].
*[[Stinglasher]] slain

==Description==
Most of the insects we've seen wandering the hive have been enormous enough, but my scouts reported an especially huge one. It's supposedly a massive wasp, and it seemed to be directing the workers on the surface.

I don't know much about these things, but if they're starting to wander beyond that pit in the ground, we need to put a stop to it. Kill this giant wasp and return to me. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*[[Secretion-Coated Carapace]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! You're proving very valuable to securing this area for the [[Alliance]]. 

==Progression==
{{The Dragons of Nightmare}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
