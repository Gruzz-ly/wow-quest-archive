==Objectives==
Collect 6 piles of Glowing Soil.
*[[Glowing Soil]] (6)

==Description==
I am chained to this place...it takes so much effort just to speak to you. I can barely maintain this shape.

I could help you, but please, help me pull myself together first. Once I'm more focused on this plane, I should be able to do it...

If I could just leave this tomb, the soil itself outside is full of ancient arcane deposits, laying forgotten for centuries. Could you bring me some?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3710 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the soil? I'm having trouble staying together...hurry...

==Completion==
Thank you! Thank you...

I feel much better. With just a bit more...

==Progression==
{{Freed}}
