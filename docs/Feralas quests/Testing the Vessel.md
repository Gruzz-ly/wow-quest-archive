== Objective ==
Kill 10 [[Ironfur Bear]]s or [[Longtooth Runner]]s, and use the Beast Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture the fallen beasts.
*[[Beast Muisek]] (10)
*[[Beast Muisek Vessel]] (Provided)

== Description ==
{{NPC||Witch Doctor Uzer'i||Master Uzer'i's}} taught me in the ways of making spirit weapons of great power. I'll help you set on the path to make some, and you'll give me the chance to practice my craft.

This vessel can shrink and trap a defeated creature inside of it. We'll need the muisek of beasts first; ironfur bears and longtooth wolves. Kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them before their spirits can escape. 

== Progress ==
Did you get the beast muisek? 

== Completion ==
As my master told me...

Upon a violent death, the muisek of a creature may escape and seek revenge. Shrinking the creatures, as you did, <name>, prevents the muisek from escaping. Now we may use it as we please!
