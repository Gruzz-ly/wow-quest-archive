== Objectives ==
Defeat Verinias the Twisted.
*[[Verinias the Twisted]] slain
*[[Mournful Essence]] (provided)

== Description ==
The other spirits and I are bound here by a cruel demon named Verinias. He is our captor, a twisted, mindless beast who devours our souls over milennia.

The lure of the souls and arcane magic you've brought me should let you draw him out. Take this condensed essence to the dead tree at the far north of the ruins. Use it to lure Verinias and slay him, that I may finally be free...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Twisted Leggings
|Luring Footpads
|Condensed Essence Bracers
|Sensiria's Shroud
|Luring Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
You must free me from Verinias's grasp!  I can grant the amulet to you if you do...

== Completion ==
I'm free...finally! Oh, it feels so good to be free...

Oh, you saw, didn't you? 

== Notes ==
Upon slaying Verinias the Twisted, the night elf spirits of Sensiria and Verinias appear:

{{text|say|Verinias|I love you, Sensiria, but I must leave here.}}<br/>
{{text|say|Verinias|I will leave to follow {{NPC||Dath'remar Sunstrider||Dath'remar}} and the others. The [[Shen'dralar]] have gone too far. To traffic with demons...we're giving ourselves over to corruption.}}<br/>
{{text|say|Sensiria|Oh, Verinias. You poor fool. You should have left earlier.}}<br/>
{{text|say|Sensiria|It's too late to stop them. Let me show you their glory...}}<br/>
''Sensiria channels a dark spell into Verinias.''<br/>
{{text|say|Verinias|No! NO!}}<br/>
''Verinias is transformed into a demon.''

Upon turning in the quest, Sensiria transforms into a succubus:

{{text|say|Sensiria|You've been so nice, <name>. I've been trapped here so long thanks to Verinias. That young elf was the first soul I've tasted in ages.}}<br/>
{{text|say|Sensiria|Even after I gifted him with that form, he insisted on keeping me trapped. He even hoarded all the souls just so I couldn't have any...so stubborn.}}<br/>
{{text|say|Sensiria|I owe you a favor, darling...someday I'll be back to repay it.}}<br/>
''Sensiria teleports away.''

==Progression==
{{Freed}}
