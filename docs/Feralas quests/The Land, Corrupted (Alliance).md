==Objectives==
Kill 6 Corrupted Cliff Giants.
*[[Corrupted Cliff Giant]] slain (6)

==Description==
The cliff giants of [[Feralas]] are extensions of the earth itself, <name>. When nature thrives, they are benevolent protectors and peaceful guardians.

But as the forest is tainted, so too are they.

Should they be corrupted by this malady, they will lash out in violence against trees, wildlife, and the very boulders they were shaped from.

Be wary in your tasks. Should you find any corrupted giants, destroy them, for the sake of those still spared.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
The spirits of these guardians will return in time, <name>. You've freed them to move on in nature's cycle.

Now it falls to us to make sure that cycle is free of corruption and needless suffering.
