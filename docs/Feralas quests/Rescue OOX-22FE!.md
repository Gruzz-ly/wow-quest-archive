'''Rescue OOX-22/FE!''' is a quest to escort the [[Homing Robot OOX-22/FE]] from [[Feral Scar Vale]] to [[The Forgotten Coast]].  This is part of the set of
{{questchain|Oglethorpe's Homing Robots}},
and is a prerequisite for [[An OOX of Your Own]].

== Objectives ==
Escort OOX-22/FE to the dock along the [[Forgotten Coast]], then report to [[Oglethorpe Obnoticus]] in [[Booty Bay]].

==Description==
The gnome's voice crackles once again from the robot:

"I need to move OOX-22/FE to an open, safe place so it can begin
a lengthy take-off procedure. It has built-in cloaking, but I need
time on my end to make it operational again. Escort the robot from
its current location to, let's say, the dock along the Forgotten
Coast! That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get
things online!"

"Escort it safely to the dock, and then come talk to me in Booty
Bay! Oglethorpe Obnoticus - out!"

== Completion ==
Oh, YOU'RE the great savior of OOX-22/FE! I cannot even begin
to express my thanks for your assistance! My homing robot series
needs more development, but your recovery has saved me countless
hours of extra rebuilding time, as well as many gold pieces in
manufacture costs!

Please, take your choice of any of these items I have. Thank you
again for your generous assistance <name>, my robots and I are in
your debt!

== Notes ==
As you are escorting the robot chicken to its destination, you
will encounter three group spawns of mobs that occur due to the quest.

*The first spawn consists of three yetis (about level 48), and you shall encounter them just north of the cave you found the robot in.
*The second spawn consists of three gorillas (about level 43), and you will encounter them just after turning north on the main path.
*You will encounter a third group consisting of four or five gnolls (about level 46-48) where the road forks to the west, after you cross a stone bridge near a waterfall.

The chicken will not stop, if it does not see you in combat, or get in combat itself.  If you get aggro via a ranged attack before the chicken has aggroed the ambushers, the chicken and the ambushers will pass each other without stopping.  If this happens, simply run up alongside the chicken with the mobs chasing you.  The chicken will figure it out in short order. (If the chicken gets too ahead of you you will fail the quest)

There have been reports of the quest being marked "complete" in one's quest log
but Oglethorpe not allowing completion.  GM responses have been "drop the quest and try again".

While this quest is not impossible to solo at the given level, it is advised to have a friend along.

== Reward ==
You will be allowed to choose one of the following:
*[[Failed Flying Experiment]]
*[[Chain Link Towel]]
