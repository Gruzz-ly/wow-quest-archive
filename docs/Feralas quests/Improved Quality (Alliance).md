==Objectives==
Collect 10 Feral Scar Yeti Hides.
*[[Feral Scar Yeti Hide]] (10)

==Description==
It's funny how things change. The northern yetis used to yield the best hides, but these...there's been a decline in quality, it seems. Maybe something nearby is making them sick.

Luckily, the [[Feral Scar]] [[yeti]]s to the southeast have flourished. I bet their hides are even better than they used to be!

I would reward you handsomely for a stack of ten of their hides; bring them to me here, and we'll finish our business.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pratt's Handcrafted Vest
|Pratt's Handmade Hauberk
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
These hides may not be as resilient as [[thorium]], but they're nice and supple.  

==Completion==
Excellent, excellent!  These are going to work out incredibly well - I can already tell that they're going to be much harder when properly cured.

Thanks again for your help <name>.  Here - please take one of my latest creations.

==Notes==
*An additional Rage Scar Yeti Hide can be obtained by [[Skinning]] the yetis, even when they already dropped one.

==Progression==
{{The Twilight Sermon}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Pratt's Handmade Hauberk]] added as a reward.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing the previous version.}}
