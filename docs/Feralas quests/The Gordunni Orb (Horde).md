==Objectives==
Collect a Gordunni Orb from a Gordunni Warlock.
* [[Gordunni Orb]]

==Description==
While you're down there cracking skulls...

I've gotten reports that make me think these Ogres may be more than the usual lumbering threat. The Warlocks among them have been seen carrying orbs, possibly items of empowerment.

It would be easy to dismiss them as crude trinkets, but I need to make sure we're not surprised. Bring me back one of these 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
* 3,500 [[Experience point|XP]] {{cost||40|}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Do you have the orb?

==Completion==
Well done. Let me have a look at this. 

==Progression==
