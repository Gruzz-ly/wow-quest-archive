==Objectives==
Collect 8 Infected Stag Antlers.
*[[Infected Stag Antler]] (8)

==Description==
A severe illness has fallen over the creatures of this forest. While at first I hoped it was part of nature's course, it has refused to pass.

The forest stags, normally strong and serene, have suffered the worst. Some waste away in weakness; others froth and rage dangerously. If I am to consult the spirits to learn more of this sickness, I will need the stags' antlers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
This is a sad task, <name>, but necessary. 

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. I will study the horns, but the situation has become even more dire since you left.

==Progression==
{{Camp Ataya}}
