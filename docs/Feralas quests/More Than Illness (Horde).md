==Objectives==
Kill 10 Noxious Whelps.
*[[Noxious Whelp]] slain (10)

==Description==
We've found a brood of dragon whelps gathered off the road to the north, and they show the same illness as the stags.

Green dragons are not simple beasts of nature, but the very guardians of the wild. They are magical creatures, and to see them ill as well implies this is a dangerous threat.

We must stop this from spreading further through any means. Slay the infected whelps, <name>, and return to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Emerald Veil#Horde
|Green Whelp Shoulderguard#Horde
|Konu's Platemail
|Runetotem Staff
|Green Whelp Spaulders#Horde
|Runetotem Slicer
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|77|50}}
*2,100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
The task may seem cruel, <name>, but it must be done. We must preserve balance.

==Completion==
These events disturb me greatly. My study of the antlers while you were gone has revealed little.

We must find some way to fix this...

==Notes==
After completing the quest, the following exchange occurs:
:{{text|say|Konu Runetotem|I am at a loss. Perhaps only the Earth Mother herself knows the cause of this. But we must do something before this continues...}}
:''[[Ysondre]] appears in front of Konu.''
:{{text|say|Ysondre|Your sincerity is moving, druid.}}
:{{text|say|Konu Runetotem|You are no night elf...this is the guise of a green dragon! By the Earth mother, I...}}
:''Konu Runetotem kneels before Ysondre''
:{{text|say|Ysondre|I deserve no such respect or reverence, druid. I have betrayed my own kind. The illness of this land is my fault.}}
:{{text|say|Ysondre|The sickness is born of the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]] within the [[Emerald Dream]], and the dragon [[Taerar]] spreads it. He is but a crazed shade of his former self, but will see this land devoured.}}
:{{text|say|Ysondre|I cannot face him myself. To even approach him would risk letting the same corruption overtake me once more.}}
:{{text|say|Konu Runetotem|What must we do?}}
:{{text|say|Ysondre|The earth itself weeps in its suffering. Gather its tears, and use them to seal the portal at the [[Great Tree]]. The connection to the Dream must be cut.}}
:{{text|say|Ysondre|Be brave, heroes.}}
:''Ysondre disappears.''
