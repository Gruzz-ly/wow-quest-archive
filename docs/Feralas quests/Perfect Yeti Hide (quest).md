==Objective==
Bring the Perfect Yeti Hide to [[Jangdor Swiftstrider]] at [[Stonemaul Hold]] in [[Feralas]].
*[[Perfect Yeti Hide]] (provided)

==Description==
You have found what may very well be a perfect yeti hide. You easily note that it is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the yeti in [[Rage Scar]].

Considering that Jangdor Swiftstrider at Stonemaul Hold is in the market for [[yeti]] hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*4600 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
What's this, <name> - you've got something special for me?

==Completion==
This is an incredible find!  I believe this is the finest yeti hide specimen I have ever seen!

Indeed, this is certainly worthy of an appropriate bounty.  I normally don't pay that much for a single hide, but I'm confident I can make something special from it.  Thanks for thinking of me on this, <name>!

==Notes==
You must have completed [[The Mark of Quality (Horde)]] to loot the [[Perfect Yeti Hide]] that starts this quest. This quest can be repeated but the hide itself is [[unique]]. The [[Alliance]] have an identical quest, [[Pristine Yeti Hide (quest)]]

==Patch changes==
