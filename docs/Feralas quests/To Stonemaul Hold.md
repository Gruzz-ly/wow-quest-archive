==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Orhan Ogreblade}} in [[Stonemaul Hold]]. 

==Description==
You must send word of what has happened here, <name>. To the south is Stonemaul Hold. There, our allies have gathered the few [[ogre]]s of the [[horde]] to fight against [[Gordunni|those]] despoiling these forests.

Speak with Orhan Ogreblade. She leads the [[Stonemaul clan]] here, and will need to know of all that has occured{{sic}}. And be wary, lest some of this corruption remain...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|38|75}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
You've been tussling with [[drake]]s, eh?

I like it. We need someone who can pull their own weight around here. Are you ready to fight for the Horde?

==Progression==
{{Camp Ataya}}
