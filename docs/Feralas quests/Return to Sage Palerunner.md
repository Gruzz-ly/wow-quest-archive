==Objectives==
Bring the Darkmist Amulet to [[Sage Palerunner]].
*[[Darkmist Amulet]] (provided)

==Description==
The soft glow from the pedestal brightens, and you can see a simple chain left behind. This must be the amulet Sage Palerunner sent you here for...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*4600 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
You've returned. What have you found?

==Completion==
I am a fool...I was misled. This is nothing more than a rusted trinket, and my visions have no doubt been fulfilled.

Forgive me, <name>. But should you meet this demoness again, I pray you will triumph over her as you did [[Verinias the Twisted|Verinias]].
