==Objectives==
Obtain keys from the [[Violetsail]] [[pirate]]s along the west coast of the [[Eye of Azshara]]. Then set the captured pets free.
*Pets freed (6)

==Description==
While [[Speedy IV]] was collecting supplies, [[Stringfellowe]] was scouting the rest of the Eye of Azshara.

Turns out there is a whole mess of pirates to the west. That must be where the pets are at.

Head over there and rescue the pets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found them, <name>?

==Completion==
Nice work freeing the pets, <name>.

But still no sign of Gurgl.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Zantini|Stringfellowe keep searching the area. See if you can find any more of these Violetsails.}}

Kill the pirates to loot [[Violetsail Pet Cage Key]], then click on [[Pet Cage (Eye of Azshara)|Pet Cages]]. The captured pets are: [[Kooks]], [[Sil'kee]], [[Roles]], [[Alameda]], [[Sparkz]], [[Baeb]], [[Anya (rabbit)|Anya]], [[Junky Moe]], [[Dinky, Jr.]], and [[Slipster]].
