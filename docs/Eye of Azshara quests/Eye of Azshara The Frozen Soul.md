==Objectives==
Retrieve the Frozen Soul Pendant from the [[Wrath of Azshara]].
* [[Frozen Soul Pendant]]

==Description==
Ah, Deathlord. It is good to see you. I happen to have a fascinating task for you, should you be in the mood for adventure.

I recently came across an obscure reference to an ancient amulet that was created by [[Queen Azshara]] herself! It is called the Frozen Soul Pendant and it offers tremendous power to those who channel the power of frost.

I have reason to believe that it may be found somewhere within the [[Eye of Azshara (instance)|Eye of Azshara]].

Retrieve the pendant for me, and it will prove most useful in my studies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the pendant?

==Completion==
So this is the legendary Frozen Soul Pendant! I sense a great power in this item...

I will begin my study of it at once. You have my gratitude, Deathlord.
