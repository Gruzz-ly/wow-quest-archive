==Objectives==
Fill a vial with arcane water from the [[Wrath of Azshara]].
* [[Vial of Arcane Water]]
* [[Khadgar's Vial]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Archmage Vargoth]]'s betrayal is an unimaginable loss to our cause, <name>. We will have to deal with him, but first [[Meryl Felstorm|Meryl]]'s condition has become dire.

Unfortunately it is not an illness at all, but a magical attack of [[fel]] origin. It may be his old nemesis [[Kathra'natir]] is behind it. We need to buy him time.

The [[Eye of Azshara (instance)|Eye of Azshara]] contains a vast store of arcane energy from [[Queen Azshara]] herself. If we could obtain a vial of water from the Wrath of Azshara's body, that will sustain him for a while.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained a vial of arcane water yet?

==Completion==
Good -- you're back just in time! This will sustain Meryl while we search for his attacker.

==Progression==
{{mage artifact and class hall}}
