==Objectives==
Gather pet supplies along the shores of [[Eye of Azshara]] with Speedy IV.
*Ask [[Speedy IV]] for help
*Pet Supplies (10)

==Description==
I was on the last leg of a supply run when we were shot down! They took the pets, but the supplies are scattered over this stretch of beach.

I don't know what they're planning, but I know we gotta get our supplies. You an' me, we ain't subtle.... But Speedy IV... He won't cause all them [[pirate]]s to go into hiding. He can get the supplies while [[Stringfellowe]] surveils the area from the air.

Speedy's fond of you, so chat him up and let's try to recover the smoldering supplies before they all burn up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Supplies are always in need.

==Completion==
We got our pet supplies back. Now we gotta get our pets.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Zantini|Alright guys, we got jobs to do. Stringfellowe, search the area, find where these guys took the pets.}}
:''Stringfellowe flies away.''
:{{Text|say|Zantini|Speedy IV, time to be fast!}}

;Speaking with Speedy IV
:<Speedy IV looks up at you ready to help.>

:{{Gossip|Let's get some pet supplies.}}

The player now controls Speedy IV with three abilities:
#Spin 'N Stun
#Dart
#Heal

Find [[:Pet Supplies]] to loot:
*[[Delicious Pet Cookie]]
*[[Wizard Pet Hat]]
*[[Stylish Pet Collar]]
*[[Bone Chew]]
*[[Lovely Pet Caller]]
*[[Pet Plushy]]

Try timing the abilities to stun the enemies and quickly grab the loot, since he is level 1 and will be one shot. Alternatively, use the player character to kill mobs near the bags, then use Speedy to collect them.

Initially, the Pet Supplies objects required level 60 to be interacted with.
