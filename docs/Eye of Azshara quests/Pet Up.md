==Description==
It sounds like some group of pet poachers are up to no good in the Eye of Azshara. My supply manager's flight path takes him right over that area!

Zantini and his pets, Strigfellow{{sic}} and Speedy IV, were bringing back a [[Gurgl|rare murloc pet]], along with some other pets and supplies.

<Name>, please find Zantini and his pets. Help them out. Then we can try to recover the pets and the supplies.

You will receive:
*[[Money]]

Thanks for the rescue, pal. Stringfellowe, Speedy IV and me appreciate it.
