==Objectives==
Go to the [[Eye of Azshara (instance)|Eye of Azshara]] and obtain [[Warlord Parjesh]]'s Hauberk.
* [[Warlord Parjesh's Hauberk]]
* [[Wrath of Azshara]] slain

==Description==
When we first met, I spoke of the [[naga]], and the armor they're able to craft. No grander armor is worn, however, than by their top warlords.

One in particular resides within the Eye of Azshara itself. His name is Warlord Parjesh, and the hauberk he wears is one of legend.

Repel his forces, and obtain his armor. Do this, and I will teach you more of the Azsunian way of leatherworking.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Recipe: Battlebound Warhelm (Rank 2)]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|60|}}
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
He will not just hand it over, <name>. You're in for a rough fight.

==Completion==
You've taken down a mighty adversary, <name>. The naga no doubt will be on the hunt for you.

Before they get to you though, allow me to show you a few things...
