==Description==
I'm so glad you're here, <name>!

I've been expecting a delivery of pet supplies and some new pets. But my distribution manager, [[Zantini]] has not reported in. I suspect foul play.

There's been some shady people eyeballing [[Magical Menagerie|my store]] for a while now. But I haven't been able to leave the store and track them down. You can.

Take my pet cat, Fiona, and find these well hidden spies.

What have you learned, <name>?

==Completion==
So there is a group of violet, pet fanatics in the [[Eye of Azshara]]?

Go to the well between One More Glass and [[Tanks for Everything]].

;Fiona summoned
:''Fiona runs towards the well.''
:{{Text|emote|The cat motions to the revealed spy.}}
:{{Text|say|Suspcious Onlooker|What!?! How?}}

Once revealed, speak with the Suspicious Onlooker.
:Hey! I don't want any trouble, <class>.

:{{Gossip|The cat's out of the bag. Why are you spying on the shop?}}

::I was told to watch for more supply shipments by some group...

::The "[[Violetsail|Violet something or others]]"...

::But messing with you isn't worth the silver they paid me.

::I saw someone else watching Breanni's shop. Might be on their payroll too.

::They were lurking around southeastern Dalaran.

::{{Gossip|Other spies in southeastern Dalaran, you say?}}

:::{{Text|say|Suspcious Onlooker|Speed of the cheetah, GO!}}

Go in front of the tunnel that leads to the Violet Hold section.

:{{Text|say|Precocious Onlooker|Oh, hi there kitty!}}

Speak with the Precocious Onlooker.
:Oh! Hi there, Mr. <Class>. You startled me...

:{{Gossip|What are you doing, young lady?}}

::I was just looking at the pet store, honest. I want a pet piglet soooo. bad.

::But I heard people are stealing pets and pet supplies and I was going to catch them!

::I did hear some bad man talk about watching for trouble at the edge of the city.

::But I'm afraid of heights so no way am I going there.

::{{Gossip|Edge of Dalaran? I'll check it out. You stay safe.}}

:::{{Text|say|Precocious Onlooker|I need to warn the pets!}}

:Uh oh.

:{{Gossip|Yeah, this isn't suspicious. What are you spying on?}}

::Hey, no law about watchin' what's goin' on in the Eye of Azshara.

::But I ain't about to tangle with you.

::{{Gossip|Eye of Azshara?}}
:::{{Text|say|Farsighted Onlooker|See ya 'round, chump!}}
