;Speaking with Iris
:The folks living up in Dalaran, they pamper these pets. But we let these pets live a life that is more rugged, more natural. We show them love, but sometimes it's tough love and you know what? The pets respect us for it.

:Pets thrive when they run with the Violetsail.

:So how about you leave us alone, return our stolen goods and pets and let these pets thrive?
