==Objectives==
Collect the Scepter of Storms from [[Lady Hatecoil]] in the [[Eye of Azshara (instance)|Eye of Azshara]] dungeon.
* [[Scepter of Storms]]
* [[Wrath of Azshara]] slain

==Description==
The [[Air elemental|element of air]] can be difficult to contain. We will need a way to magically anchor it to the pillar.

Air, no matter how capricious, cannot resist a good storm.

In the Eye of Azshara, the [[naga]] [[sorceress]] known as Lady Hatecoil possesses a powerful relic known as the Scepter of Storms.

Retrieve the scepter, and we will use it to bind the elements of air to the [[Maelstrom Pillar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 15,480 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope it was easy to convince Lady Hatecoil to part with her scepter.

==Completion==
Yes, this is it! With this, I will be able to bind the element of air nicely. And, maybe do some impressive tricks at future festivities.

==Progression==
{{Shaman artifact and class hall}}
