==Description==
The [[naga]] in the Eye of Azshara summon terrible storms that ravage the coastline of [[Azsuna]] - storms far beyond the abilities of even their best [[naga siren|siren]]s.

It can only be the [[:Heart of Zin-Azshari]].

Prior to the [[Great Sundering|Sundering]], [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s chosen used the Heart to greatly magnify their power - it is said to have been key in their dominance of the [[Well of Eternity]].

If you can journey to their domain and retrieve it, <name>, we will put its power to far better use than those foul creatures.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|40}}

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the Heart?

==Completion==
The Heart will require a great deal of work to properly hone the destructive energies within its depths, but I have faith that you will prevail.

==Notes==

The Heart is near [[Channeler Varisz]].  It will not appear if a [[Mythic Keystone]] is used.

''Complete:''
: ''The Heart is placed in the center of the magic circle and gives off a potent pulse of lighting.  [[Kalecgos]] is amazed.''
: {{text|say|Archmage Kalec|By the Lifebinder... I thought the Heart was just another legend.}}
