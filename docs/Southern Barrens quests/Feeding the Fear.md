==Objectives==
Kill 5 [[Tower Warden]]s. Use the [[Coiled Rope|ropes]] beside [[Holgom]] to quickly move in and out of [[Honor's Stand]].
* [[Tower Warden]] slain (5)

==Description==
Our resources are limited, <class>, but that doesn't mean we can't make some trouble down below. Use the [[Coiled Rope|ropes]] here to sneak down the hillside, then slay the [[human]] prison wardens.

Killing a couple scrawny guards won't turn the tide of battle, but imagine the fear and chaos we'll reap as the humans discover the mutilated bodies...

<Holgom grins a yellowed grin, his eyes glinting.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Tell me about the guards. Chaos? Fear? Panic? Hm?

==Completion==
Good, good. It'll take them many sleepless nights to figure out where we came from and where we disappeared to after the kills...

==Progression==
