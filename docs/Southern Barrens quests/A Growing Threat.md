==Objectives==
Kill 13 Razormane Quilboar.  
*[[Razormane tribe|Razormane]] [[Quilboar]] Slain (13)
 
==Description==
A moment there, <class>.

We've got more problems here than just [[Cataclysm (event)|the end]] of [[Azeroth|the world]] as we know it. Our vigil here's threatened by the quilboar. We've been content to leave them be when they stay in the [[Razorfen Kraul|Kraul]], sure, but every day they press further and further out towards our camp.

[[Mahka]], bless her green heart, wouldn't ever forgive me if I went out bashing heads in myself, but if you could help drive back those that're wandering near the camp, I'd appreciate it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are ye sure enough 've been dealt with? They're dangerous due to numbers, y'know.

==Completion==
You've my thanks, if not that of the entire [[Earthen Ring]].

Maybe someday we'll find a way to talk it out with these [[pig]]s, but we can't heal the land if we're dead in our sleep.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Razormane Pathfinder]]s, [[Razormane Seer]]s, or [[Razormane Warfrenzy|Razormane Warfrenzies]].

==Progression==
{{Firestone Point}}
