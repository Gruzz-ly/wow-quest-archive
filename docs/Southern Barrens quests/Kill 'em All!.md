==Objectives==
Kill 10 Frazzlecraz Miners at the [[Frazzlecraz Motherlode]] in [[Southern Barrens]].
*[[Frazzlecraz Miner]] slain (10)

==Description==
I want to see some dead [[goblin]]s, <name>! Just west of here you'll find a whole warren of those little insects burrowing into the mountain.

Let's see to it that they're digging their grave.

Destroy them. Lay waste to their whole grubby operation. They've sown their own demise in [[Bael'dun]], <class>, and it is time to meet the reaper.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Do you have a bodycount for me, <name>?

==Completion==
Dead? Good.

Let word of this deed spread, and with it, terror.

The [[Horde]] will feel the consequences of their attack on Bael'dun, and they'll rue the day they ever crossed us, <name>.
