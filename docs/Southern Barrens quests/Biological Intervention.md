==Objectives==
Kill 5 Deviate Terrortooths and 5 Deviate Plainstriders.
*[[Deviate Terrortooth]] slain (5) 
*[[Deviate Plainstrider]] slain (5)

==Description==
The energies unleashed here have surged through the wildlife, twisting them into powerful and unstable forms. If allowed to spread beyond this grove, [[Deviate creature|these deviates]] will wreak havoc on the existing ecosystem, devouring local prey and driving out the weaker natural creatures.

You must go and cull the population of the [[overgrowth]]. Return when this task is done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is a necessary task, <name>, and I ask that you ensure enough are slain to prevent their spread.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I'm pleased to see you return intact; the viciousness I've been seeing among these creatures is startling.

==Progression==
{{The Overgrowth}}
