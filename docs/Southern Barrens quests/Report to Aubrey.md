==Objectives==
Report to [[Admiral Aubrey]] in [[Northwatch Hold]]. 

==Description==
You there! Fresh off the boat? Welcome to [[Kalimdor]], a land hellbent to kill you or die tryin'.

There's trouble at the hold - as I'm sure you noticed on your way in. Admiral Aubrey needs all hands on deck if we're to make it through this. Consider yourself drafted, <class>!

Follow the road up the hill and you'll find Aubrey in the tower, topside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|}}
* 710 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Hm? What unit are you with, <class>?

No matter, we need all hands. My fleet is in tatters and they've broken into the hold. You armed? That's good enough for me.
