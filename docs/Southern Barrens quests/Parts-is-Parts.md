==Objectives==
Use Calder's Bonesaw on corpses within the [[Battlescar]] and collect 15 Severed Extremities.
*[[Severed Extremity]] (15)
*[[Calder's Bonesaw]] (Provided)

==Description==
I've always wanted to try making an abomination. It looks simple enough, but you know how it is when you learn things from a book. There's no substitute for doing!

First, I'm going to need parts. Lots of parts. And you're going to get them for me.

No need to be picky: [[human]], [[orc]]... it doesn't matter. Parts is parts.

Just be sure the corpses you harvest come from the Battlescar, so I know they're fresh.

<Calder presses a rusted, gore-covered bonesaw into your hands and smiles disarmingly.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Did you get my parts? Let me see them!

==Completion==
<Calder peers into the sack of extremities and licks his lips with a dry, black tongue.>

Oh my. This is exciting.

Aren't you excited, <name>?
