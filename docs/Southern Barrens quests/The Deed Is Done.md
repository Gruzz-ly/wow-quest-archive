==Objectives==
Return to [[General Twinbraid]] at [[Twinbraid's Patrol]] in [[Southern Barrens]]. 

==Description==
<You shield your eyes from the blast and the debris as the [[Frazzlecraz Motherlode|mine]] implodes onto itself.>

<General Twinbraid will be pleased, but somehow you doubt it'll be enough to quench his thirst for vengeance.>

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Twinbraid Shoulders
|Goblin Miner's Helm
|Frazzlecraz Necklace
|Goblin Miner's Hardhat
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 360 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Completion==
<Twinbraid nods as you describe the destruction of the mine, but his eyes still burn with rage.>

Very nice work, <name>. I suppose there's some strategic value in depriving the Horde of those minerals, but I'd have done it anyway just to crush those little green monstrosities.
