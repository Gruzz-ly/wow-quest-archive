==Objectives==
Slay Kona Thunderwalk on the border between [[Stonetalon]] and [[Southern Barrens]].
*[[Kona Thunderwalk]] slain

==Description==
<Name>, I certainly don't want to deliver my report to [[Commander Singleton]] without at least a little bit of good news. We've got to wrestle control of these roads back from these [[Horde]] holdouts.

From what we can gather, Kona Thunderwalk is the name of the ringleader. He's got a camp just north of here. A Stonetalon native, he knows these roads better than his own hide. If we can wipe him out, resistance from the west might vanish.

Find and kill Kona Thunderwalk, then report to Commander Singleton!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gloves of Honor's Stand
|Singleton Sash
|Singleton Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Hello, <class>. What news do you have from Stonetalon?

==Completion==
So our supplies aren't getting through? Hmmm. [[Honor's Stand]] just gets more and more isolated.

Still, the defeat of Thunderwalk should send a signal to our foes that we mean to stay. Thank you, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Honor's Stand}}
