==Objectives==
Defeat a [[Sapper Specialist]] near the [[Battlescar]] and acquire a Keg of Blast-O Powder.
*[[Keg of Blast-O Powder]]

==Description==
Our shipments of saltpeter from [[Dustwallow Marsh|Dustwallow]] have been held up, which means we can't manufacture our own gunpowder here.

But I can retrofit our armaments to use [[goblin]] Blast-O powder. It's unstable, dangerous, toxic to the skin, and harmful if swallowed... but I think I can make it work!

Get me a keg of the stuff by attacking one of those goblin sapper specialists who've been storming our walls.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
Do you have a keg of Blast-O powder yet?

When you get one ... don't shake it.

==Completion==
Great! Set the keg down right here. I'll measure out some charges once I've donned my full-body protective gear.

==Progression==
