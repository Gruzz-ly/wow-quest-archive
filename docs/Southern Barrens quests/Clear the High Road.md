==Objectives==
Slay 3 High Road Scouts. 
*[[High Road Scout]] slain (3)

==Description==
This way, <class>! I see you've discovered the [[High Road|high road]].

The [[Alliance]] hopes to sever our ties with [[Stonetalon Mountains|Stonetalon]], but they forget that we [[tauren]] have hunted across these lands for generations. We know every hillside switchback and game trail from here to [[Thousand Needles]].

But for these paths to stay open, we must stop the [[human]]s from mapping them out.

Patrol the trail east and kill any high road scouts you find along the way, then speak to [[Tunawa Stillwind]] just up the path. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||10|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Hail, <class>. Did Nura send you?

==Completion==
Patrolling the high road is grave business, but it must be done. These narrow mountain trails are, for the time being, one of our only lifelines into Stonetalon. They must be preserved.

Thank you.
