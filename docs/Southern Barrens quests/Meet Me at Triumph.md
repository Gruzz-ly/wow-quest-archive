==Objectives==
Report to [[Commander Roberts]] at [[Fort Triumph]] in [[Southern Barrens]].

==Description==
Thanks in part to your efforts, we've stabilized the situation here. We need to turn our attention south, to Fort Triumph.

Fort Triumph is the keystone of our operation in the Barrens - the vital land-link between Northwatch and Theramore.

I'll pack up and head out separately. Report to Commander Roberts at the fortress and I will see you there soon. Together, we will secure the frontier!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 710 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Have you heard? [[General Hawthorne|The General]] never made it!

Killed in the field, like some kind of dog!

==Notes==
Lore-wise, during this quest another one is taking [[The Butcher of Taurajo|place]]. When arriving at the Fort the guards and the [[Triumph Messenger]] will inform you of the deed.
:{{text|say|Triumph Messenger|<Name>! You're alive! Have you heard?}}
:{{text|say|Triumph Messenger|They killed him! General Hawthorne - he was ambushed on the road by [[Horde]] [[assassin]]s.}}
:{{text|say|Triumph Messenger|His body was found strung up from a tree. Those animals... Those filthy animals!}}

[[Commander Roberts]] and [[Barton Trask]] will confirm it.
:{{text|say|Barton Trask|Were he still alive to avenge himself, General Hawthorne would have no doubt ordered a retaliatory massacre of biblical proportions.}}
:{{text|say|Commander Roberts|You are quite right, Trask.}}

Inside the tower behind them is the body of the General, as well as his wife now widow [[Clarice Hawthorne]].
