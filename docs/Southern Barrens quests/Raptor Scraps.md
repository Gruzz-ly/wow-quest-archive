==Objectives==
Gather 8 [[Terrortooth Hide]]s from [[Terrortooth Runner]]s and [[Terrortooth Scytheclaw]]s.
* [[Terrortooth Hide]] (8)

==Description==
We are besieged here, <class>, and between [[Great Divide|that chasm]] and the harassment of the [[Alliance]] we are short on supplies. But we make do with what's at hand, as we [[tauren]] always have.

In the absence of a forge, a skilled leatherworker can strengthen and patch up our damaged armor with good quality hides.

Down below is the hunting ground of the Terrortooth [[Raptor]]s. They are not so easy to kill, in part due to the ruggedness of their thick skin. Hunt them, <name>, and bring their hides to me!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Steel-Patched Belt
|Terrortooth Hide Bracers
|Raptor Scrap Cloak
|Steel-Patched Armbands
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Terrortooth raptors hunt in packs and surround their prey. We hunt them, yes; but we also respect them.

==Completion==
<Onatay looks over the fresh hides, nodding her head slowly.>

Yes <name>, I can work with these. You work fast!

These hides will help us hold out for reinforcements longer. Thank you.
