==Objectives==
Rescue Ambassador Gaines from the [[quilboar]] in the [[Overgrowth]].
*[[Ambassador Gaines]] Rescued

==Description==
I told him he was a fool, but Ambassador Gaines insisted he could negotiate an alliance with the quilboar against the [[Horde]]. Even if he succeeded, I for one wouldn't want to fight with those ... [[pig]]-men at my side.

Well, Gaines hasn't returned, and [[General Hawthorne]] will hold me accountable if I lose one of our best negotiators to these squealing savages.

Locate the Ambassador in this steaming mess of a jungle and rescue him if he's still alive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Gaines once told me he'd learned a little of the quilboar tongue. Then he... squealed... at me.

I think [[Kalimdor|this continent]] is getting to him.

==Completion==
Good work. Gaines passed through here not long ago on his way to Northwatch and a warm bath.

The mission wasn't a total loss, though. We've learned a good deal about these quilboar and their leadership structure.

Now we can handle things ... MY way.
