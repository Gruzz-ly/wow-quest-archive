Mankrik has returned with a vengeance. He will not stop until every quilboar lies dead. You will aid him in his plight.

==Objectives==
Kill 13 Razormane Quilboar 
*[[Razormane tribe|Razormane]] [[Quilboar]] slain (13)

==Description==
For a moment, I thought my hatred had stilled. [[Olgra|My wife]] laid to rest, a final offering of the blood of her murderers to quell her tortured spirit. I thought perhaps peace would appeal to me.

I was wrong.

I will not rest now until every single filthy, squealing, murderous quilboar lays dead and broken! I cannot kill them fast enough with my own two hands. Go and slay more for me, <race>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*3100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
More!  Kill more of them!  MORE!

==Completion==
Good. Take your reward; this is only a prelude

==Notes==
*Just head a bit to the NW and kill [[Razormane Pathfinder]]s, [[Razormane Warfrenzy|Razormane Warfrenzies]], and [[Razormane Seer]]s.

==Progression==
{{Firestone Point}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
