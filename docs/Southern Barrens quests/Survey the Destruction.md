==Objectives==
Speak with [[Nibb Spindlegear]] at [[Honor's Stand]] to survey the [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]]'s destruction.
*Survey Complete
*Report your findings to [[Horton Gimbleheart]] at [[Northwatch Hold]] in [[Southern Barrens]].

==Description==
I had heard of enormous seismic anomalies here in [[Kalimdor]], but I had no inkling that the geological chaos would be so profound!

I need an up-to-date survey of the destruction while I stay here to study the seismographic readings. Could you gather some data via my automated survey craft? I'll take care of all the flying.

When the survey is complete, present the data to my colleague Horton Gimbleheart in Northwatch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||15|}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
What, what?! The [[Horde]] is pounding over the fortress walls, this had better be important!

==Completion==
What, what!? Can't you see we're under attack here!

<Gimbleheart snatches the readouts from the survey craft, then stuffs them haphazardly into a duffel bag.>

Yes sure of course I'll give Nibb's findings careful study. Later. From the safety of the [[Eastern Kingdoms]], if I have any say about it!

==Notes==
;Speaking with Nibb
:The gyros are all spun up. Are you ready to fly my survey?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready to fly.}}
:The adventurer hops on [[Spindlegear's Survey Craft]].

;Flying over the Southern Barrens
:{{Text|say|Spindlegear's Radio|Interesting. Even this far from the epicenter, Azeroth's crust is completely torn asunder.}}
:{{Text|say|Spindlegear's Radio|What's all this? This jungle wasn't here during last week's survey. What is happening to the Barrens?}}
:{{Text|say|Spindlegear's Radio|That's seawater. It's breached the ocean. Do you think the fissure is growing?}}
:{{Text|say|Spindlegear's Radio|Hold everything - the walls of Northwatch have been breached! We're under attack!}}

The player is dropped near Horton.
