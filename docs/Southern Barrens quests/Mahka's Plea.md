Return to Mankrik and talk to him again:
;If his quests haven't been completed prior<!-- Probably. -->
:You again... I hope you didn't put too much faith in your actions settling my spirit. I've realized there will be no peace without [[Olgra|her]], not anymore.
:I will see their very homes razed. Are you ready to slay more of these disgusting murderers?
:{{Gossip|Mahka wants you to come see her, Mankrik.}}
:{{Text|say|Mankrik|Mahka wishes to see me? ...very well. Return to her, I will follow.}}

Return to Firestone Point, where the following event will play out:
:{{text|say|Mahka|Come, Mankrik. Sit beside me and rest.}}
:{{text|emote|Mankrik grunts.}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|Look at this land, Mankrik. The Horde and Alliance tear the earth apart just to claw at each other in spite.}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|Such hatred is only bringing us destruction. I can see it in you as you fight the quilboar...your anger does nothing but wear you away.}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|You're destroying yourself, Mankrik.}}
:{{text|say|Mankrik|There is nothing left for me. I seek a warrior's death. Is that wrong?}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|You seek escape, not glory. It's suicide.}}
:{{text|say|Mankrik| So what if it is? Why do you even care?}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|Because...}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|Because despite what you think, there may be people in this world who would mourn your passing.}}
:{{text|say|Mankrik|Mahka...}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|Please, Mankrik. Let go. Set down your blade.}}
:{{text|say|Mankrik|This hatred has burned in me for years, Mahka. Your words cannot lift it from me so easily.}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|Then...you do not need to bear it alone. Just sit next to me and forget your troubles, if only for a while.}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|Come see me whenever you are weary.}}
:{{text|emote|Mankrik nods.}}
:{{text|say|Mankrik|...thank you, Mahka.}}
