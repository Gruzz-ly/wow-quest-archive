<You discover a cargo manifest on the body, detailing a long list of sundries urgently needed on the front.>

<A bloody trail in the dirt indicates bodies were dragged south of here, toward the raptor dens.>

<The raptors may have dragged away the supplies, as well. Retrieving those supplies for Corporal Teegan could help salvage this disaster!>

==Progress==
What? My supply caravan was sacked by those cold-blooded scissor-paw things?

==Completion==
My supplies! Well, that showed some real initiative, <class>. Those rap-saws or whatever they're called have torn lesser men to ribbons. Thank you!
