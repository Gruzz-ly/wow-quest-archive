==Objectives==
Kill any combination of 5 [[Plains Prowler]]s or [[Plains Pridemane]]s.
*[[Southern Barrens|Barrens]] [[Lion]] Slain (5)

==Description==
Respect the lion, <name>! A ferocious killer. You gotta admire the elegance of the beast... Muscle and claws... Running down its food... So primal...

I'm sorry, my mind wandered. As I was saying, I respect these lions, but they're just murder on our patrols. I mean that literally. The men are afraid to go to the bathroom alone at night. Can you help make our camp a little safer?

Barrens lions like to linger under trees.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Beautiful beasts, aren't they?

==Completion==
Nice work! How was it? Did you enjoy the hunt?

Did you run through tall grasses, the scent of your prey urging you forward, until you leapt at its throat, adrenaline surging as your slavering fangs... Well, something like that.
