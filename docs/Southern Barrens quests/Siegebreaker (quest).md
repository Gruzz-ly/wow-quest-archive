==Objectives==
Destroy 4 Northwatch Siege Engines at the Mulgore Gates.
* [[Goblin Stickybombs]] (provided)
* [[Northwatch Siege Engine|Siege Engine]] Destroyed (4)

== Description ==
<Name>, you've proven yourself on the Fields of Blood. But the Alliance still threatens our tauren friends.

The siege machinery outside the gates of Mulgore is like a spear aimed at our heart. I want you to go to the gates, south of here, and remove those siege vehicles from play.

Here, use these stickybombs. They're courtesy of our new goblin allies. It looks as though they stuffed explosive powder into ... what looks like ... grease-covered socks. But they'll do. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bloodhilt Gloves
|Grease-Covered Boots
|Groady Goblin Wand
|Pewter Slab
|Grease-Covered Footguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Why did [[Gar'dul]] allow the Alliance to create such a buildup of heavy siege vehicles? Why wasn't a strike ordered until I got here? Gar'dul will have to answer for this...

==Completion==
Very good. Now, should they storm the gates, they will have to do so with infantry.

Do you think they have the stomach for that?
