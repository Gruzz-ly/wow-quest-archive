==Objectives==
Help [[Naralex]] seal the Nightmare Scar.
*[[Nightmare Scar]] Sealed

==Description==
This confirms it. The overgrowth here is not being caused by a mere overabundance of energy.

Do you understand? This is beyond what happened at the Wailing Caverns now. A rift into the Nightmare must have torn open in the middle of the very land we're standing on! And to think it's my fault...

I'm done picking at the edges of this wound. Go to the west, to the center of the overgrowth, and meet me again there. We will dive into the heart of this corruption and force it shut!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wailing Ring
|Vest of the Nightmare Rift
|Naralex's Slippers
|Tunic of the Nightmare Rift
|Scepter of Naralex
|Cudgel of Naralex
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must not allow the nightmare to spread further into our world.

==Completion==
We've done it! The nightmare's connection to this place has been severed. The rest of the land is safe from this intrusion now, and in time, the abberations{{sic}} here will be subsumed by the balance of nature.

I cannot thank you enough, <name>. By helping to restore order here, you've let me make amends for my foolish actions.

==Notes==
Find Naralex at the Nightmare Scar and speak with him.

:This is it. I can sense that this was once the site of great tragedy; mortal suffering still echoes through it. No doubt this is what the horrors beyond have seized onto.

:To fully seal this intrusion into our world, I must first fully open it. I will need your strength to hold back whatever may attempt to come through.

:Are you prepared?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready, Naralex.}}
:{{Text|say|Naralex|I will attempt to seal the scar, <name>. Make sure nothing from the other side makes its way through!}}
:''Naralex starts casting a spell into the vortex.''

The first wave of three [[Nightmare Horror (Southern Barrens)|Nightmare Horror]]s attack, followed by a second wave of two [[Nightmare Stalker]]s, and finally a [[Nightmare Mass]]. Kill it.

;Gossip after reaching the objective
:The scar is sealed! Thank [[Cenarius]]...
