{{questportrait|Sabersnout.jpg|Sabersnout|Blow the Horn of Challenge to engage Sabersnout.}}
==Objectives==
Blow the Horn of Challenge in the [[Bristleback Challenge Ring]], and defeat Sabersnout in single combat.
* [[Sabersnout]] slain
* [[Horn of Challenge]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[quilboar]] are attacking because they perceive weakness. Strength is the only language they understand. So we will show them strength. 

<Makaba withdraws a large horn from his satchel.>

This is admittedly crude work but it'll do. [[Bristleback tribe|Bristleback]] leaders use horns like these to challenge one another for dominance.

<Name>, I want you to challenge the Bristleback champion, Sabersnout, to single combat. Defeat him in front of his followers. Blow the horn at the Bristleback challenge ring due south of here. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sabersnout's Cloak|Boarpocalypse Boots|Bristleback Challenge Ring (item)#Horde|Bristleback Challenge Treads#Horde}}

You will also receive: {{cost||30}}

==Progress==
Have you taken the Bristlebacks down a peg or two?

==Completion==
What? He attacked you with a dozen boars? I guess quilboar have their own ideas of what "single combat" means.

Still, the Bristleback will be left reeling after the blow you've delivered. It will not be long before a new champion rises amongst them to stir up trouble... but at least this buys us some time to get these refugees relocated safely.

Thank you, <name>. The survivors owe you a great debt.

==Notes==
On using the horn in the ring, Sabersnout and [[Bristleback Onlooker]]s appears: 
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|What is this? <Gurgle> <Snort> The <race> has come? To challenge mighty Sabersnout <Snort>?}}
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|I will make example of <race> <Snort>! Prepare yourself <Gurgle> soft-for-face.}}
:{{text|emote|Sabersnout laughs.}}
:''Sabersnout fights until he is low health.''
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|You, <Snort> you are strong <Gurgle>. But...}}
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|Strong enough for THE BOARPOCALYPSE?}}
:''He summons several [[Bristleback Assault Boar|hostile boars]]. After the boards are killed:''
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|You ... survive the boars? <Snort> So many boars! So sad! <Gurgle>}}
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|I must break you now.}}

On death:
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|<Snort>? <Gurgle>!}}
:''The onlookers are Feared and run away.''
