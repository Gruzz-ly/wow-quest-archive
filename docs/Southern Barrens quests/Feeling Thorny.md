'''Feeling Thorny''' wants you to go to speak with [[Auld Stonespire]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Auld Stonespire]].

The [[quilboar]] in [[Razorfen Kraul]] are far more ruthless and full of hatred than Mankrik could ever imagine.

You should travel south there and speak with my old friend Auld Stonespire. He works to put an end to their rampage before the land suffers more in its already weak condition.

You will receive
*{{cost||2}}
*180 [[XP]]

Only a veteran like you could brave the dangers lurking here.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
