==Objectives==
Collect 6 Blood Shard Trinkets from [[Razormane tribe|Razormane]] [[Quilboar]].
*[[Blood Shard Trinket]] (6)
*[[Carved Boar Idol]] (provided)

==Description==
This bright red stone, found clutched in the grasp of a quilboar, has been carefully carved into the likeness of a great [[boar]], with thorny vines sprouting from its back. Its surface is smooth and worn with care.

Did the quilboar make this? If you find others, maybe one of the [[shaman]] at [[Firestone Point]] could tell you more about them.

==Rewards==
*{{cost||35}}
*3,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
These are [[Blood Shard|blood shards]]. They used to be found all over the [[Barrens]].

It's said they were formed from the blood of [[Agamaggan]], the great [[demigod]] that the quilboar sprang from. I knew the quilboar prized them, but nobody would think they'd take the time and care to carve them like this one...

There may be more to learn here.
