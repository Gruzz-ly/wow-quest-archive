==Objectives==
Acquire a [[:Humming Electrogizard]] from a [[Thunderhead]] in [[Southern Barrens]].
*[[Humming Electrogizard]]

==Description==
Okay! Using the spare parts you've found for me, I've got a framework roughed out for my versatile new assault vehicle. All I need now is a compact power supply.

I've noticed that the indigenous wildlife here packs quite the punch, electrostatically speaking. Can you hunt down Thunderheads near the base here and get me an intact electrogizard? It might take a few kills to find a usable gland.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Far-a-Day Mesh
|Thunderhead Kid Gloves
|Mizzy's Dungarees
|Pistonhammer Gun
|Mizzy's Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
It must be an enormous evolutionary advantage to be able to shoot lightning. From your face.

==Completion==
<The gizard shocks Mizzy as you hand it over, blasting her to the ground.>

Oh, OH! That's nasty! I love it!

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{Text|say|Mizzy Pistonhammer|Thank you, <name>! Now I can begin my final assembly...}}
:''Mizzy builds a [[Mizzy's Microtank|microtank]], and a [[Siege Tank Engineer]] approaches her.''
:{{Text|say|Mizzy Pistonhammer|Okay... structure? Check. Power? Check. Danger? Double-check. Let's fire up my masterpiece!}}
:{{Text|say|Siege Tank Engineer|Hmmmm... aye. But it's a wee bit - uh - wee, innit?}}
:{{Text|say|Mizzy Pistonhammer|Nonsense! Miniaturization is the future of warfare.}}
:''The engineer hops in the tank, but crashes it into a nearby scaffolding, killing three [[Peasant Laborer]]s as the tank explodes. The engineer is Dizzy and despawns.''
:{{Text|say|Mizzy Pistonhammer|I should mention I reversed the gearbox to accommodate the smaller form-factor.}}
