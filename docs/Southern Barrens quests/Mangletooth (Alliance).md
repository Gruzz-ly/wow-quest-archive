==Objectives==
Kill [[Mangletooth]].
*[[Mangletooth]] slain

==Description==
Una here used to spend time in Camp Taurajo. She's told me about a quilboar that used to be captured there, named Mangletooth. Quite the clever one, for a quilboar.

I've been tryin' to think what got these quilboar riled up so much recently, and it might be that Mangletooth escaped Taurajo alive. If he has, he's certainly calling the shots.

There's a large hut up in the hills to the northwest. If you find Mangletooth there, cut 'im down.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dorn's Amulet
|Quilboar Fur Bracers
|Redearth Staff
|Mangled Tooth
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find him?

==Completion==
That's a relief. Maybe the rest of 'em will keep to their own devices now. The less fighting around here, the better.

==Progression==
