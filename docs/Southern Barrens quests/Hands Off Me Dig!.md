==Objectives==
Kill 8 Excavation Raiders, rescue 5 Bael'modan Artifacts, and acquire Twinbraid's Tools in the Bael'modan Digsite.
*[[Excavation Raider]] slain (8)
*[[Bael Modan Artifact]] (5)
*[[Twinbraid's Tools]]

==Description==
Look at the chaos down there, <name>! I've instructed the foremen to save what artifacts they can. Who knows what treasures these [[tauren]] animals are like to make off with.

Can you help get a handle on things? Kill the raiders and save what artifacts you can.

While you're at it, look for my missing tools. A few quick repairs and I can get this [[flying machine]] up and running again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
How's the situation down there?

When the raid started I popped a bullet into their ringleader, [[Gann Stonespire|Stonespire]], but they just kept right on coming.

==Completion==
[[Twinbraid|My father]] would be proud of you, <name>.

Now, to get this flying machine up and about again...
