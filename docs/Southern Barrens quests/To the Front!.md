==Objectives==
Locate [[Ambassador Gaines]] at [[Forward Command]] in [[Southern Barrens]].

==Description==
I'd love to keep you here behind the lines, but it looks like you've been summoned to the front. Ambassador Gaines - remember him? - has relocated to Forward Command and in his latest missive he's requested you, personally, to assist him.

You'll find our Forward Command operation south of here, in what's become known as the "[[Fields of Blood]]."

Be careful, <name>. The [[Horde]] has taken to ambushing some of our officers en route.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 710 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Ah, <name>! I've been talking you up to the General here. Thank you again for saving my life.

==Progression==
{{Forward Command}}
