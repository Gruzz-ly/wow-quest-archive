==Objectives==
Kill [[Terrortooth Runner]]s and [[Terrortooth Scytheclaw]]s to collect 8 [[Terrortooth Hide]]s.
*[[Terrortooth Hide]] (8)

==Description==
Hey, <class>!

Are you headed to support Corporal Teegan? He's in charge of keeping the supply routes open.

He's got two of the most ornery dwarves I've ever met in charge of sundries. If you want to make an impression on those two crotchety hunters, you're going to need to show that you can hold your own against the predators around here.

The raptors west of the hold here are especially vicious. Bring Goucho some fresh hides and you'll make an impression while supplying the troops in one swoop.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
What is it, <class>? This here camp ain't fit for sight-seein'.

==Completion==
Hey, you're tougher than you look. These terrortooth hides reflect arrows and turn axe-blades - they don't go down easy, but their hides are worth their weight in silver in these light-forsaken Barrens. Nice work.

==Progression==
{{Teegan's Expedition}}
