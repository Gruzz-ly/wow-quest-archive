{{questportrait|Sabersnout.jpg|Sabersnout|Blow the Horn of Challenge to engage Sabersnout.}}
==Objectives==
Take the Horn of Challenge to the [[Bristleback Challenge Ring]] in [[Southern Barrens]]. Blow the horn to challenge Sabersnout and kill him.
*[[Sabersnout]] slain
*[[Horn of Challenge]] (provided)

==Description==
I have not forgotten my brush with death at the hands of the [[quilboar]] in that filthy jungle. [[General Hawthorne|The General]] here has ordered some tactical strikes, but he stops short of genocide. I have no such qualms.

Take this horn that I 'borrowed' during my negotiations. Blow the horn within the Bristleback challenge ring west of our position - you can't miss it. I want you to challenge the [[Champion (rank)|champion]] of the [[Bristleback]], Sabersnout, to single combat. His death in front of his followers will leave them in utter chaos.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Boarpocalypse Boots
|Sabersnout's Cloak
|Bristleback Challenge Ring (item)
|Bristleback Challenge Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Sabersnout! Is he dead? What's the news?

==Completion==
A "Boarpocalypse," you say? These animals certainly have a unique idea of "Single combat!"

No matter, you've done well. With the quilboar in chaos I should have no trouble convincing the field commanders to execute any strays they find scurrying about. The General need not know we've stepped up the campaign... it's for the better.

==Notes==
On using the horn in the ring, Sabersnout and [[Bristleback Onlooker]]s appears: 
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|What is this? <Gurgle> <Snort> The <race> has come? To challenge mighty Sabersnout <Snort>?}}
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|I will make example of <race> <Snort>! Prepare yourself <Gurgle> soft-for-face.}}
:{{text|emote|Sabersnout laughs.}}
:''Sabersnout fights until he is low health.''
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|You, <Snort> you are strong <Gurgle>. But...}}
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|Strong enough for THE BOARPOCALYPSE?}}
:''He summons several [[Bristleback Assault Boar|hostile boars]]. After the boards are killed:''
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|You ... survive the boars? <Snort> So many boars! So sad! <Gurgle>}}
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|I must break you now.}}

On death:
:{{text|say|Sabersnout|<Snort>? <Gurgle>!}}
:''The onlookers are Feared and run away.''
