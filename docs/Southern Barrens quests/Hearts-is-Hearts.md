==Objectives==
Slay a [[Landquaker Bull]] south of the [[Battlescar]] and collect an Enormous Kodo Heart. 
*[[Enormous Kodo Heart]]

==Description==
These parts - so lovely! Muscle and sinew and fingers and toes ... I am SO hungry right now.

But work must come first. Once I stitch this pile of parts together I'm going to need a heart strong enough to pump sludge through this rat's nest of veins. I would use my own heart, but it's a shriveled up husk resembling a turnip.

No, I need some real power. Get me a [[kodo]] heart from one of those giant landquaker bulls to the south of the Battlescar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
You've gotta have heart, <name>. All you really need is heart. 

==Completion==
<[[Calder Gray|Calder]] grasps the gigantic heart in both hands, squeezing it and listening to the valves slurp and squish.>

<His pale mask of a face splits open into an enormous, childlike grin.>

It is so very important to love one's work, wouldn't you agree, <name>? 

==Notes==
The progress text is a quote from the song "Heart" from the musical [[wikipedia:Damn_Yankees|Damn Yankees]].
