==Objectives==
Kill 6 [[Hecklefang Scavenger]]s.

==Description==
Not everyone who fled [[Camp Taurajo|Taurajo]] was able to make it to [[Camp Una'fe|Una'fe]], <name>. Some died of wounds along the way. Others were jumped by opportunistic [[quilboar]].

I'll take care of the grim task of finding and gathering the bodies. But there is something you can do for me.

Hecklefang scavengers prowl the lands south of here and are savaging the corpses, tearing at their bowels and dragging away the limbs of the dead. Please, thin their numbers so that I can perform the proper funerary rites. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Thank you for helping me with this grim business, <name>.

==Completion==
So it is done.

Normally these scavengers are part of the [[Earthmother]]'s cycle of life. But on the heels of the devastation wracked by both the [[Alliance]] and the [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]], their numbers grow overwhelming. It is good to thin them out.
