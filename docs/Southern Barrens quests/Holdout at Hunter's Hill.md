==Objectives==
Speak with [[Onatay]] at [[Hunter's Hill]] in [[Southern Barrens]].

==Description==
[[Honor's Stand]] may have been lost, but its spirit was never crushed. Even now survivors are holding out at a point called "Hunter's Hill."

Continue following the [[High Road|high road]] and you will find our camp just up ahead. Speak with Onatay when you get there and let her know the trail is, for the moment, still clear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 180 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Completion==
So the [[Alliance]] is probing the twists and turns of the high road?

Even if they were to map it out, they couldn't attack these hills in numbers. This is our land, <name>. And they will pay dearly for presuming otherwise.

==Progression==
