==Objectives==
Gather 10 Stonetalon Supply crates from the ruins west of [[Honor's Stand]].
*[[Stonetalon Supplies]] (10)

==Description==
[[Horde]] [[scout]]s hiding in the ruins up ahead ambushed my supply train. Only [[Walpole's Bodyguard|two of my bodyguards]] made it out of there alive. And me? I used to have hair!

The supplies I was delivering are scattered through the ruins up ahead. Gather them up and take them to [[Janice Mattingly]] at [[Honor's Stand]]. If they can't make it to [[Stonetalon Mountains|Stonetalon]], at least we can keep them out of Horde hands...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
What's the story out there?

==Completion==
What ... our supplies? These were meant for Stonetalon.

No matter, at the rate we're going, we need them more here. Honor's Stand has been cut off from the coast, <name>. Commander Singleton is at his wit's end.
