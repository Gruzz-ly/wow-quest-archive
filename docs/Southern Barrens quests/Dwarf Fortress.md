==Objectives==
Acquire the Bael'Dun Fortress Schematics.
*[[Bael'Dun Fortress Schematics]]

==Description==
I don't know if you noticed on your way in, but this whole fortress is erected around a giant [[cannon]]. If we can just find the ammunition magazine, we could blow this place sky-high as easy as kiss-my-hand!

But to figure it out I'm going to need the fortress schematics, and I haven't been able to steal them yet.

Look for the plans on the lowest floor, right down these stairs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20|}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Give me the plans, quickly! Our time grows short.

Mostly because I've been eating my disguise.

==Completion==
Let's see, let's see.

It looks like the artillery shells are prepped here, then loaded into the secure magazine...

<Weezil rubs his hands together.>

<Name>, are you ready to blow some stuff up?
