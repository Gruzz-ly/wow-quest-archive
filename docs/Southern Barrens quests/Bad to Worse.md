==Objectives==
Rescue 5 caged Taurajo Refugees, and kill any combination of 8 [[Bristleback Thornweaver]]s or [[Bristleback Bladewarden|Bladewardens]].
*[[Taurajo Refugee]] Released from Cage (5)
*[[Bristleback]] [[Quilboar]] Slain (8)

==Description==
When the [[refugee]]s fled north from [[Camp Taurajo|Taurajo]], some were separated as darkness closed in. Many were taken [[prisoner]] by the Bristleback quilboar who set up camp west and southwest of here.

I am not certain what the quilboar hoped to get from us by capturing our refugees; all they have earned is my ire. And all they'll get in return is vengeance.

Rescue my trapped brothers and sisters, and kill their captors to send a message to the quilboar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
How do things look in the quilboar camps, <class>?

==Completion==
It's bad enough to have one's village sacked... but to spend the following night in a quilboar cage? I'm glad you were there to help, <name>. 

==Notes==
[[Deviate Thornweaver]]s also count.

==Progression==
{{Camp Una'fe}}
