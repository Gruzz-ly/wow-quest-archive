==Objectives==
Collect 8 Siege Engine Scrap pieces from the [[Battlescar]] in [[Southern Barrens]].
*[[Siege Engine Scrap (Southern Barrens)]] (8)

==Description==
These bulky [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[siege engine]]s aren't cut out for the close-quarters fighting of the Battlescar.

I've got some new designs I'd like to try out, but first I'm going to need some spare parts. There's plenty of wreckage sitting in the Battlescar. All I need is an enterprising <class> to haul it back for me.

That's you, <name>. I'm talking about you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
What have you got for me?

==Completion==
Oohh look! A mostly complete exhaust manifold, a reciprocating junction box, a working counterweight slip differential ... you sure know your junk, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Fort Triumph}}

==Patch changes==
