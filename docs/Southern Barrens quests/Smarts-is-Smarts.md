==Objectives==
Kill a Triumph Officer on the far side of the Battlescar and acquire a Fresh Brain.
* [[Fresh Brain]]

==Description==
My monstrosity is taking shape! All that's left is to stuff his skull with something useful.

I'm talking about brains, <name>. And here I'm going to be picky. The abomification process causes significant brain damage so it's best to start with someone smart.

One of the Alliance officers should do nicely. Seek out one of the Captains on the far side of the Battlescar and try not to damage the goods while you kill him.  

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Brain-Splattered Leggings
|Vest of Abomification
|Neurosurgeon's Tool
|Chestguard of Abomification
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Brraaaaaaiiinnnnss...

==Completion==
<Calder holds the brains in an outstretched hand while withdrawing a gore-caked multi-tool from his belt.>

Wonderful work! Now the secret here is to leave the reptilian nervous systems intact while removing the higher cognitive functions. We can't have our new friend developing a conscience or remembering he's Alliance...

<Calder digs and snips at the brain, removing large chunks.>

And... we're finished! How lovely.

==Notes==
After the quest is completed, Calder will cast '''Summon Gray's Abomination''' to create [[Gray's Abomination]].
:{{text|say|Calder Grey|It's alive, <name>. It's alive!}}
:{{text|say|Calder Grey|Go forth, my beautiful angel! Ah, it is so very sad when one's children leave the nest, isn't it?}}

[[Gray's Abomination]] will stomp off towards the [[Battlescar]] and [[Fort Triumph]], engaging in combat with Alliance mobs as it goes. If it survives, it will then patrol a small area just outside [[Fort Triumph]]{{coords|46|67|Southern Barrens}}.
