==Objectives==
Go to the [[Battlescar]]. Scout out the flag marker and kill 10 Desolation Raiders.

Capturing the flag will give all [[Alliance]] players in the scar a combat advantage.
*[[Desolation Raider]] slain (10)
*[[Battlescar Flag]] Scouted

==Description==
The [[Horde]] has fought us to a standstill from [[Desolation Hold|their stronghold]] west of here. The fighting continues, even as the land breaks open under our feet.

Someone's got to break the stalemate! I need you to venture into the Battlescar and help my men crush the Horde opposition there.

In the center of the scar you will find a flag marker designating who controls the area. Scout out the flag. It'll be worth your while to claim the scar for the Alliance if someone hasn't already done so.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I'm getting nothing but casualty reports from the front. What's going on in there?

==Completion==
Incredible work, <name>! My men report a breakthrough. Their stronghold won't survive much longer...

==Progression==
{{Fort Triumph}}
