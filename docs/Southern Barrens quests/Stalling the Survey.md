'''Stalling the Survey''' is a Horde quest from [[Hunter's Hill]] in the [[Southern Barrens]]. It requires the death of [[Henry Zykes]], a surveyor, to disrupt Alliance plans to build a highway from [[Theramore]] into the heart of Kalimdor.

Zykes walks north and south alongside the road just below Hunter's Hill, accompanied by two [[Survey Assistant]]s. The quest objective incorrectly marks the objective on the map within an area of [[Honor's Stand]] guarded by [[PvP]]-enabled alliance soldiers; his actually location is well to the south.

==Objectives==
Find and kill the surveyor [[Henry Zykes]].
* [[Henry Zykes]] slain

==Description==
These maps have all been drawn by the same steady hand. I've seen a human surveyor heading up and down the road between the hold and the jungle to the east.

We can set their plans back by making an example out of this surveyor, <name>.

<Kilrok points to the signature at the bottom of the maps.>

What do you think that says? "Zykes?" Even human names sound thin and weak. Kill him.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Surveying Gloves
|Zykes' Belt
|Surveying Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of things?

==Completion==
Good, good. We've got to keep [[Honor's Stand]] isolated.

Alone ... afraid ... <name>, if we keep up the pressure, maybe someday they'll simply surrender the pass.

==Progression==
{{Hunter's Hill}}
