==Objectives==
Locate [[Marley Twinbraid]] outside the [[Bael Modan Excavation]] in [[Southern Barrens]].

==Description==
The patrol's been quiet today. And that's got me worried, <name>.

Ever since the [[Alliance]] sacked [[Taurajo]], none of our positions are secure. You look like you can handle yourself - can you scout around for me?

Check in with my son Marley outside the Bael Modan excavation, southeast of here. The site's exposed and susceptible to raids, and my son's too proud to signal for help if he needs it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 360 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Completion==
Father sent you? He worries too much. There's nothing here I can't handle...

But I'd still appreciate the help.
