==Objectives==
Collect 4 Disturbed Earth Fragments from [[Disturbed Earth Elemental]]s.
*[[Disturbed Earth Fragment]] (4)

==Description==
We are here to monitor the scars of the land, and watch for further signs of instability. While we haven't seen any yet, a cataclysmic aftershock could devastate the [[Barrens]] even further.

To the northeast, near the chasm, [[earth elemental]]s rampage out of control. To soothe the earth, these need to occasionally be destroyed, and their essence returned in a ritual. If you help us do this, <class>, I would be happy to reward you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The elements must be carefully balanced, so returning the essence is key.  I hope you've been collecting it...

==Completion==
Thank you, friend. It's important we try to calm this earth in every way we can. 

==Progression==
