==Objectives==
Deliver Crawgol's Silithid Field Guide to [[Tauna Skychaser]] at [[Firestone Point]] in [[Southern Barrens]].
*[[Crawgol's Silithid Field Guide]] (provided)

==Description==
I've been on top of this [[silithid]] situation for almost a month, which makes me the local expert. Just last week the [[Earthen Ring]] was visiting, and wanted me to write down everything I know.

<[[Crawgol]] hands you a tattered book.>

I'm not much of a writer. Or a reader, for that matter. But this book is probably the most definitive thing ever written about this foe.

Deliver it to Tauna Skychaser down in Firestone Point. It's south of here, just west of the main road.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 360 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Earthen Ring]]

==Progress==
Ah, do you bring news from up north?

==Completion==
Is this from Crawgol? Wonderful! Despite all the turmoil in [[Azeroth|the world]], we can't turn our back on the silithid threat. It is important to have people like Crawgol studying our enemy closely and learning its secrets for the fight ahead!

<Tauna opens the book and glances over the first page. Her face falls.>

Oh. Well. I suppose it's something, at least.
