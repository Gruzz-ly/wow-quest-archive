==Objectives==
Speak to [[Winnoa Pineforest]] at [[Vendetta Point]] in [[Southern Barrens]]. 

==Description==
While we've accomplished much here, it would be a tragedy if part of this corruption has escaped our notice. The corridors of the [[Wailing Cavern]] stretch throughout the entire [[Barrens]], and if another spot of wild energy has made its way to the surface...

You've done enough for me, though. I would simply ask that you let a fellow [[druid]] of mine know of what's happened here. You will find Winnoa Pineforest at Vendetta Point, southwest of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||10}}
* 710 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I could feel what occured{{sic}} from here, <class>. It bristled every hair I have.

I'm overjoyed to hear you succeeded in pushing those horrors back, and I'll be sure to scour the area for any stray deviate creatures.

==Progresion==
{{Vendetta Point}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
