==Objectives==
Speak to the Taurajo Looters in the [[Ruins of Taurajo|Taurajo Ruins]] and place them under arrest. Use the Northwatch Manacles to subdue 5 wounded looters.
*[[Taurajo Looter]]s Arrested (5)
*[[Northwatch Manacles]] (provided)

==Description==
Our policy of conscripting non-violent criminals from the [[Stormwind Stockade]]s has come back to haunt us, <name>. Some of my less-scrupulous [[soldier]]s broke ranks after our victory in Taurajo and are looting the remains of the city.

This is a breakdown in discipline. Worse, the desecration of their homes only spurs the enemy to fight harder when our ultimate goal should be peace.

Take these manacles and bring the Taurajo looters to justice. Speak to them first, but you may need force to subdue them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Is the Taurajo situation under control?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Several of the looters have already crawled back, requesting clemency. I'll let them stew for a bit in the [[Northwatch]] brig.

Thank you for helping maintain discipline in the ranks. It is important for our army to be perceived as soldiers, not common [[bandit]]s.
