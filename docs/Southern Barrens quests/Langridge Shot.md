==Objectives==
Gather 15 pieces of Langridge Shot.
*[[Langridge Shot (item)]] (15)

==Description==
<Class>! Thank the [[light]] - they've practically driven us back to the docks. The courtyard is overrun!

We're out of canister shot and the [[orc]]s are getting ready for an assault up the hill. We need to improvise some scatter-shot, and fast.

Hurry, run into the broken tower here and grab whatever sharp, pointy bits of scrap metal you can lay your hands on. Knives, forks, nails - anything! Load the cannon when you've got an armful!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Paxton has already loaded a charge into the [[cannon]]. All it needs is the ammunition you improvised.

==Completion==
The [[Horde]] is massing at the base of the hill. Breathlessly, you stuff the debris you collected into the muzzle of the cannon, step back, cover one ear, and tug on the igniter cord...

==Notes==
Enter the nearest tower and open the objects.
