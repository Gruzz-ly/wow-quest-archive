==Objectives==
Kill [[Northwatch Recon]] patrols and collect 10 Theramore Merit Badges.
*[[Theramore Merit Badge]] (10)

==Description==
Our defense of the Barrens hasn't gone well under Gar'dul's command, <name>. Garrosh has sent Warlord Bloodhilt here to take control of the situation. He's here in camp, and if you want to make a good impression, you'll demonstrate some initiative.

Head east into the Fields of Blood and seek out Northwatch recon units. Bringing the new Warlord a stack of their merit badges will help you make a name for yourself!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
You look like the type of <class> who gets things done. What news do you have from the field?

==Completion==
<Bloodhilt looks at the badges, then allows them to spill from his hands onto the sands below. His lips curl open into a toothy grin.>

Now THIS is what I like to see, <class>! What is your name again?

You will go far here.
