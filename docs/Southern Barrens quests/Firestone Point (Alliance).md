==Objectives==
Seek out [[Dorn Redearth]] at [[Firestone Point]] in [[Southern Barrens]].

==Description==
Can you do me a huge favor, <name>? My sister-in-law's uncle is in the [[Earthen Ring]], and he's here in the [[Southern Barrens|Barrens]] studying the impact of the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]], down at Firestone Point. He says their camp is surrounded by [[quilboar]] and I worry that they might get overrun.

Can you check in on Dorn Redearth for me? I'd hate for anything to happen to him, what with the close family bond and all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 360 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
What? Little [[Logan Talonstrike|Logan]] thinks I might need protection?

It's me doing the protectin'!

The quilboar here are poised to rampage. They've choked off the entire south, and we're the only thing standing in their way.
