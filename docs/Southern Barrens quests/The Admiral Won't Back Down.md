==Objectives==
Report to [[Admiral Aubrey]] at [[Northwatch Hold]] in [[Southern Barrens]].

==Description==
What? You want to stay here to fight? Typical <class>, wanting to stay and fight off the [[Horde]] while there's still a chance to run for it.

Look, if you really want to save Northwatch, you should report to Admiral Aubrey in the [[tower]] behind me. He's keeping his [[ship]]s here to fight, instead of ferrying us all away like I begged him to.

Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to finish packing!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*180 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You've ventured all the way here from [[Honor's Stand]]? Excellent, we could use your experience here.

They may have breached the walls, but Northwatch isn't going down without a fight.
