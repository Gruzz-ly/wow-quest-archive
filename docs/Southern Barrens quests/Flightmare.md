==Objectives==
Use Tomusa's Hook on [[Triumph War Gryphon]]s to dismount and kill 5 Wildhammer Mercenaries.
* [[Wildhammer Mercenary]] slain (5)
* [[Tomusa's Hook]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Alliance]] has hired in [[Wildhammer dwarf|Wildhammer]] mercenaries to control the skies over the [[Battlescar]]. I believe these same [[Gryphon rider|gryphon-riders]] were the ones to firebomb [[Taurajo]] during the attack.

I want our skies scoured clean.

The wildhammer dwarves fly low enough for a sharp-eyed <class> to hook them. Take this. Target their [[gryphon]]s and dismount the [[rider]]s - once grounded, show them no mercy. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tomusa's Sword
|Earthbound Leggings
|Flightmare Mantle
|Earthbound Trousers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
The Wildhammer are fierce fighters, in the air or on the ground. How goes the battle?

==Completion==
<Tomusa snorts as he takes back his hook.>

Vengeance feels hollow. Still. I could not allow them to go unpunished.
