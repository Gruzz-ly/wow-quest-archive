==Objectives==
Use the Bucket of Burning Pitch on the [[silithid]] mounds outside of [[Fort Triumph]] to flush out and kill 10 [[Silithid Swarmer]]s.
*[[Silithid Swarmer]] slain (10)
*[[Bucket of Burning Pitch]] (provided)

==Description==
Why [[High Command#Alliance High Command|high command]] decided that a silithid mound was the ideal place to build a fortress, I'll never know. Them lil' buggers are tunneling under our fortifications and setting back our timetables. We need to scorch 'em out!

Take this here bucket of burning pitch and dump it on the silithid mounds right outside the main gate. They look like big piles of sand. Kill anything that comes out, but be careful, <name> - them nasties are likely to swarm you when you light those mounds up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
How goes the fight, <name>? 

==Completion==
That oughta take care of our bug problem for a while - they'll be hard-pressed to tunnel their way outta that! 

==Progression==
{{Fort Triumph}}
