==Objectives==
Collect 4 Fresh Stormsnout Steaks by killing [[Stormsnout]]s in [[Southern Barrens]]. 
* [[Fresh Stormsnout Steak]] (4)

==Description==
It's true what they say: An army marches on its stomach. And we've been marching a long way.

I'm thinking if we barbecue up a few of those giant lumbering stormsnouts, we'll have enough meat to feed us for weeks.

Stormsnouts are big and slow, so they should be easy to kill. Except... Hey you're not carrying any metal on you are you? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Trawley's Gloves
|Stormsnout Hide Boots
|Pot Stirrer
|Pewter Slab
|Stormsnout Stompers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
<Trawley licks his lips, barely able to constrain his drool.>

You get my steaks yet? Nice and bloody?

==Completion==
<Sam's eyes bug out of his head as you slam the huge slabs of meat before him.>

Oh yeah... oh ... YES! I'll have mine raw. I suppose I can grill some up for the others... How would you like yours?
