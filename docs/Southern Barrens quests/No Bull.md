==Objectives==
Kill 4 Landquaker Kodos and 1 Landquaker Bull in [[Southern Barrens]].
* [[Landquaker Kodo]] slain (4)
* [[Landquaker Bull]] slain

==Description==
[[Twinbraid]]'s patrols always throw us right into the thick of danger. If it's not [[Horde]] ambushes, it's a [[quilboar]] hit-and-run.

The problem is them lousy landquaker [[kodo]]s. Big walkin' walls of fur, shakin' the ground... We can't see or hear an ambush creepin' up on our backside.

Go scare 'em off from our patrol, here. Killing a few should drive the herd south and out of what's left of me hair.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Stonesthrow Sword
|Landquaker Leggings

* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Good to see you're not squished.

==Completion==
I thought you might be responsible for them clouds of dust I saw to the east. Nice work! Them bulls ain't sissies.
