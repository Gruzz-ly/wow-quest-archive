==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Hunter Hill Scout]]s.
*[[Hunter Hill Scout]] slain (8)

==Description==
Look around you, <class>. We've had no luck dislodging the [[Horde]] from the hidden trails that overlook this valley. They appear out of nowhere to ambush our supply caravans and then disappear into the hills!

I need you to run the gauntlet to Honor's Stand and let them know the roads still aren't safe. Talk to Mattingly, the supplies officer by the gate.

And kill a few of these brutes along the way!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
A fresh face from [[Stonetalon Mountains|Stonetalon]]! Do you have any news from the campaign out west?

==Completion==
They're ambushing the roads to Stonetalon, too? We just can't get a break here. Where are they coming from, anyways?

==Progression==
{{Honor's Stand}}
