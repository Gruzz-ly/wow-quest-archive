==Objectives==
Search [[Bael'dun Keep]] for a Mug of Ol' Barkerstout and bring it to [[Marley Twinbraid]] at the entrance.
* [[Mug of Ol' Barkerstout]]

==Description==
<Marley grasps the side of your head with a shaking, bloody hand.>

Ale... Must... have ale...

Ol' Barkerstout from inside. <He coughs.> That should ... do the trick.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
<Marley's breathing is ragged, coming and going in shuddering gasps.>

<His eyes look at you imploringly.>

==Completion==
<Marley's eyes sparkle as you rush toward him with the ale. He grasps the mug in both of his shaking hands and upends it, white foam spilling out over his blood-caked beard.>

Ah... that's the stuff. Ol' Barkerstout... Thank you, friend.

That'll make this... a little easier.

<Coughing one final time, he slumps over the shattered control console, the half-empty mug crashing to the ground and spilling its contents into the sand. His eyes glaze over.>

<Marley Twinbraid is dead.>
