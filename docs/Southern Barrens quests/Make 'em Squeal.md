==Objectives==
Kill any combination of 8 [[Bristleback Bladewarden]]s or [[Deviate Thornweaver]]s, and collect a Bramblestaff from one of the Thornweavers.
*Bristleback Quilboar Slain (8)
*[[Bramblestaff (quest item)]]

==Description==
One of the native species in Kalimdor is the 'quilboar.' Prickly little buggers. Reason enough to hate this continent.

The raids started shortly after we established our forward camps. Worse, those spiny fiends seem to thrive in this thorny hell of a jungle. I need you to help beat them back so we can re-establish contact with Forward Command.

While you're out there, acquire one of those twisted branches their casters seem to be using to manipulate the jungle growth...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I should mention, you're probably going to need a machete to hack through this mess.

This jungle came out of nowhere!

==Completion==
<Corporal Teegan nods as you deliver your report, then grasps the Bramblestaff with both hands.>

So, this is what the quilboar are using against us? Do you think they used these to create this jungle?

==Notes==
[[Bristleback Thornweaver]]s also count.

:Teegan uses the staff and accidentally summons a [[Ferocious Jungle Vine]] that grabs [[Ol' Durty Pete]].
