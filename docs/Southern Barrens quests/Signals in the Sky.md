==Objectives==
Travel to [[Camp Una'fe]] in the [[Overgrowth]] of [[Southern Barrens]] and speak with [[Makaba Flathoof]].

==Description==
Turn your eyes to the southeast. Do you see the campfire smoke from Camp Una'fe?

Not ten minutes ago I saw great puffs of white smoke roll up into the sky from the center of camp. It was an old signal used by my village to coordinate the hunt over great distances, but this time, it was a distress signal.

<Name>, my brother Makaba had gone into that unnatural jungle. Please go there and make sure he's not in any trouble.

There are few paths: look for tents within the wilderness.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

==Completion==
So my sister recognized the old signals? Her hunter's eyes are as sharp as ever.

<Name>, when we first set up this camp we were at the edge of this jungle. Now look at it!

Something is amiss.
