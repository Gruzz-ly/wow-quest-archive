==Objectives==
Talk to [[Warlord Bloodhilt]], then ride into [[Desolation Hold]] and inform Gar'dul that Warlord Bloodhilt is on his way.
* [[Gar'dul]] notified 

==Description==
Thanks to you, the immediate threat is over. But my work here in the [[Barrens]] is only beginning.

[[Honor's Stand]] was captured and [[Taurajo]] was sacked while Warlord Gar'dul was in charge of the region. [[Garrosh Hellscream|The Warchief]] has sent me here to clean up his mess.

I would like you to ride into Desolation Hold to the south in advance of me and let Gar'dul know that it is time for a reckoning.

Talk to me when you are ready to leave and I will assemble my vanguard to accompany you. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
What is this about? Why are you creating such a commotion in my camp?

==Completion==
<Gar'dul breaks into a sweat.>

Look - ah - let's not discuss this here, in front of the men.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Bloodhilt
:Are you ready to ride to Desolation Hold as my Vanguard, <name>?

:Gar'dul may try to give you the runaround. Let him know his judgment is coming.

:{{Gossip|I am ready to ride, Warlord!}}

The player is mounted on [[Bloodhilt's Riding Wolf]] and rides to the Hold and becomes accompanied by a [[Bloodhilt's Rearguard]]. Hostile mobs become unfriendly and won't attack.

;Speaking with Gar'dul
:{{gossip|I'm here on behalf of Warlord Bloodhilt, who wants you to know he will be arriving shortly.}}

::Warlord Bloodhilt? Garrosh's pet?

::There's no need for him to be here, as you can see, ah, tell him I have the situation well in hand.

::{{gossip|I'll be sure to tell the Taurajo survivors that. Those that lived.}}

:::But, ah, supplies have been tight. I've got, ah, a manpower shortage. Tell Bloodhilt that, ah -

:::{{gossip|Tell him yourself. He's almost here!}}
