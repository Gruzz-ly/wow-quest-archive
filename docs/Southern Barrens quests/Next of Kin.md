'''Next of Kin''' concludes the [[Horde]] quest chain involving [[Gann Stonespire]] at [[Bael Modan]]. It also acts as a breadcrumb quest to direct players to [[Dustwallow Marsh]].

==Objectives==
Take the Dwarven Slug to [[Alto Stonespire]] at [[Brackenwall Village]] in [[Dustwallow Marsh]].
* [[Dwarven Slug]] (provided)

==Description==
<Nato pulls you aside and speaks in a whisper.>

<Name>, I have removed the bullet from [[Gann Stonespire|Gann]]'s chest, but the bubbles in his blood tell me all I need to know. His lungs are punctured, and the wound grows septic. He is not long for this world.

Take this. It's the bullet that killed him. His family will want to know what became of their youngest [[warrior]].

Seek out Alto Stonespire. He is posted in Dustwallow Marsh. Go northeast, and follow the roads to Brackenwall Village.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|8|15}}
* 1,550 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Hello, <class>. You look to be caked in dust instead of mud. I take it you've ventured here from the [[Southern Barrens|Barrens]]?

==Completion==
<Alto clenches the bullet in his palm as you tell your story.>

Gann? Dead? I ... I should've known. His temper... his recklessness. I knew someday it would get the better of him.

But it sounds as though you've already gifted him with vengeance. Thank you, <name>.

Turn your attention now to [[Dustwallow Marsh|Dustwallow]]. If the [[Alliance]] finishes their cursed road though here, all your victories in the Barrens may have been for nothing.
