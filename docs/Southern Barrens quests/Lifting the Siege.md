==Objectives==
Use Paxton's Torch to burn 3 Rageroar Catapults and 1 Rageroar Blade Thrower.
*[[Rageroar Catapult]]s Burned (3)
*[[Rageroar Blade Thrower]] Burned
*[[Paxton's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
We'll never be able to re-secure the fortress walls so long as [[Karga Rageroar|Rageroar]] and his [[Rageroar clan|goons]] have access to artillery. I need you to fight your way across that chasm and take out his big guns.

[[Orc]]s season their heavy machinery with [[:coal]] tar, which makes them flammable. Take my torch and burn any [[catapult]]s you see north of [[Northwatch Hold|Northwatch]].

Then, torch those big [[Blade thrower|blade-throwers]] in Rageroar's base camp! Those things have killed enough of our men.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Burn it all, <Class>. Burn it to cinders!

==Completion==
Good! Without heavy equipment, the [[Horde]] will have to pull back to regroup. We've bought ourselves some time to re-secure the fortress. Well done!

==Progression==
{{Northwatch Hold}}
