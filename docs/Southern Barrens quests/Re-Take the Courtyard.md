==Objectives==
Kill 10 Rageroar Grunts.
* [[Rageroar Grunt]] slain (10)

==Description==
That's one way to clear a hill. Those corpses are impaled with knives and forks!

The [[Rageroar clan]] has breached the walls, but we can still turn this fight around. Go down the hill and help our men hold on to the courtyard below...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Paxton's Belt

|Seized Rageroar Belt

You will also receive:

* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
How goes the fight?

==Completion==
Great work! We've knocked them on their heels, maybe long enough to shore up our defenses.

Provided we find a way to take out their artillery...
