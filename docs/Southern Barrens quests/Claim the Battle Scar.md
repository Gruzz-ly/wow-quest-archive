==Objectives==
Go to the [[Battlescar]]. Scout out the flag marker and kill 10 Triumph Vanguard [[soldier]]s.

Capturing the flag will give all [[Horde]] players in the scar a combat advantage.
*[[Triumph Vanguard]] slain (10)
*[[Battlescar Flag]] Scouted

==Description==
We have fought the [[Alliance]] to a standstill here, even as the land beneath our feet falls apart. To the east you will find the Battlescar, a wide swath of decimated terrain. It is little more than a line in the sand, but it must be OUR line.

In the center of the scar you will find a flag marker designating who controls it. Scout out the flag.

If it's not already ours, capture it for the Horde - it will swing the battle in our favor. Investigate the scar and kill anyone you find in there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you pushed them all the way back to their gates?

==Completion==
Excellent! You're my kind of <class>, <name>.

With your help, we will throw these invaders back into the sea.
