==Objectives==
Kill 10 Desolation Grunts at the [[Fields of Blood]] in [[Southern Barrens]].
*[[Desolation Grunt]] slain (10)

==Description==
The [[Horde]] has taken to calling this region the "Fields of Blood." It's an apt name: these reeds run red with the blood of some of my best men.

I've sent out recon patrols to crush the [[quilboar]] and report on the Horde troop movements, but not all of them return. They could use your support out there.

Patrol the fields and seek out the Desolation Grunts that are causing us so much grief. Do not expect them to surrender; [[Garrosh Hellscream|their Warchief]] has instructed them to fight to the death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
How goes the skirmish?

==Completion==
Very good. We may never drive the Horde completely from these lands, but with a strong presence we can undermine their will to fight.

==Progression==
{{Forward Command}}
