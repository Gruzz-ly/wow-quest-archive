==Objectives==
Speak to [[Admiral Aubrey]] to fly to the [[Blackpool]] and kill 6 Rageroar Sea Dogs.
*[[Rageroar Sea Dog]] slain (6)

==Description==
<Name>, the sea is our only lifeline, and right now most of my fleet is either steaming back to [[Theramore]] for repairs or rusting at the bottom of this bay. Only the Blackpool remains afloat to defend our harbor.

But she's just signaled that she's being boarded!

Speak to me when you're ready, I'll have one of our naval [[gryphon]]s deposit you right on the deck. Slaughter the rageroar sea dogs who dare assault my precious ship and report to Captain Fisher for further orders. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Blood! All over my freshly polished brass.

==Completion==
You make a hell of a [[marine]], <name>.

We'll mop up the others. But it looks like the [[Horde]] fleet is disengaging - maybe to land more troops ashore?

Admiral Aubrey will know what to do. Talk to me when you're ready to fly back! 

==Notes==
;Speaking with the admiral
:We must hold fast. If Northwatch falls, there is nothing to our backs but the sea!

:{{Text|say|[[Nathan Blaine]]|Aye aye sir! Immediately, sir!}}
:''The adventurer hops on a [[Northwatch Gryphon]] and is transported and dropped onto the Blackpool in the [[Merchant Coast]].''

Fisher can be asked to leave at any point.
:All hands topside! Run 'em through!

:{{Gossip|Captain, I need a ride back to Northwatch Hold.}}
