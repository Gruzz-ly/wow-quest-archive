==Objectives==
Capture a neutral hill in the [[Fields of Blood]] and defend it against a [[Horde]] counter-attack.
* Point [[Field Banner|Captured]]
* Point Defended

==Description==
Strategically, control of a region requires constant observation. See here on this map - I've identified a number of strategic hills, similar to this one, that the [[Alliance]] must acquire if we are to keep the enemy under our thumb.

My [[scout]]s have already marked their location on the field. What I need is someone to spearhead their capture, and you're the <man/woman> for the job.

Seek out neutral grey flags on hills to the north, east, and south of the [[Ruins of Taurajo|Taurajo Ruins]]. Capture one and defend it!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Taurajo Leggings
|Robes of the Bloody Field
|Hawthorne's Shield
|Taurajo Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
How goes the fight? Every inch of territory our valor earns today grants us continued security tomorrow.

==Completion==
Your report, <class>?

Incredible, <name>! You're a real asset to the Alliance. I'll see to it that my men follow your example!

==Notes==
Upon clicking a [[Field Banner]], creating Alliance Field Banner and receiving the buff Defending a Point, four [[Alliance Field Defender]]s appear and start constructing [[Alliance Field Barricade Wall]]s.
