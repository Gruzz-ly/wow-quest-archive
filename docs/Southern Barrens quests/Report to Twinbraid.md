==Objectives==
Deliver the Frontline Report to [[General Twinbraid]], who is on patrol in [[Southern Barrens]].
*[[Frontline Report]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Alliance]] owes a debt to the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Bael Modan]], who built some of our earliest fortifications in the [[Barrens]].

Their [[Commander (rank)|commander]], [[General Twinbraid]], is a real stalwart. One of our best. He's on patrol south of here, keeping the [[Horde]] on their toes.

I definitely want to keep him appraised of the situation here so we can coordinate our next move. Can you deliver this frontline report to him in the field?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 710 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Hrm, news from the fortress? Well. Spit it out!

==Completion==
<The General reads over the report, nodding in approval as he reads about the [[Battlescar]].>

Quite a name you're earning for yourself here in the Barrens, <name>. But [[Commander Roberts|Roberts]] isn't going far enough. What we need is a decisive victory...
