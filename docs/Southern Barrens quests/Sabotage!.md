==Objectives==
Sabotage a Dwarven Artillery Shell and then flee from [[Bael'dun Keep|Bael'dun]] before it explodes.
*[[Dwarven Artillery Shell|Artillery Shell]] Sabotaged
*Get Out of There!

==Description==
These dwarven artillery shells have a built-in airburst timer. This is easy! Just sabotage one of the artillery shells in the loading bay and then hoist it up into the magazine. Boom, baby. BOOM!

You'll find the shells in one of two loading bays behind the main garage on this level. It's right around the corner.

Once you've rigged the artillery shell... Run! Run like the wind, <name>! Then report to [[Gann Stonespire|Gann]] back at camp. I'll be right behind you. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Stonespire Shoulders
|Spearhead Helm
|Airburst Amulet
|Spearhead Faceguard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
<Gann only opens his eyes after you prod him. His breathing is little more than a series of shallow gasps.

==Completion==
Bael'dun? Destroyed?

<Wincing in pain, Gann twists his head to peer behind him, where plumes of smoke darken the skyline.>

<Name>, my friend. you have avenged [[Camp Taurajo|Taurajo]] and avenged the Tauren people. The invaders will not soon recover from that blow. Thank you.

<Gann closes his eyes, his head tipping forward as his breath gives way to a series of ragged coughs.>

==Notes==
After sabotaging the artillery shell, the player will get the Run for It! debuff and a warning:
:{{text|bossemote|This whole place is gonna blow. Get to the exit!}}

Then there is a cut scene of the player running out of the building just before it explodes, with a flying machine also crashing. When the scene ends, the player is standing at [[Spearhead]]{{coords|49|82|Southern Barrens}}.

If you return to the burning building, it appears [[Weezil Slipshadow|Weezil]] did not make it out in time.
