==Objectives==
Collect 3 Polished Boar Skulls.
*[[Polished Boar Skull]] (3)

==Description==
I think the [[quilboar]] are being driven by more than just crude desire. Would you help me look into this further?

To the west, scattered among the quilboar's [[settlement]]s and camps, I've noticed [[boar]] skulls. They gleam from a distance, polished smooth...distinct from the remains littered in their waste piles. I think these may be objects of worship.

Bring me several of these to examine, <name>. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the skulls? 

==Completion==
Yes, these are clearly symbols of [[Agamaggan]]. But if the quilboar are still devoted to their dead [[god]], what is the source of their vicious agression{{sic}}?  It is said Agamaggan was noble, and even gave his life fighting the [[Burning Legion]]...

A moment, <name>. We must confer with the spirits.

==Notes==
After completing the quest [[Mahka]] summons a [[Vision of Charlga]]:
:{{text|say|Mahka|Aid me, friends. Let us call upon the spirits for vision!}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Charlga|[[Agamaggan]] will not rise again without BLOOD! His body demands sacrifice!}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Charlga|Go! Go and take our land! When all belongs to the quillboar, we will be delivered, and Agamaggan will rise again!}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Charlga|This he has spoken to me...go, and KILL!}}
:{{text|say|Mahka|I see...she's using him to manipulate them all..}}

==Progression==
