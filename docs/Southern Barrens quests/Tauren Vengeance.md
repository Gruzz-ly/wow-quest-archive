==Objectives==
Seek out [[Gann Stonespire]] at [[Spearhead]] in [[Southern Barrens]].

==Description==
My people are not wrathful by nature, but sometimes a thirst for justice causes us to take up arms in anger.

My old friend Gann Stonespire, on learning of the butchery in [[Taurajo]], flew into a fury. Tribal elders could no longer hold his rage in check.

Now he has all but parted ways with the Horde. He's gone rogue, <name>, and seeks to lash out at the Alliance with a small band of like-minded partisans.

If you, too, seek vengeance, you will find him southeast of here, at the foot of [[Bael Modan]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,300 [[XP]] 
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]] 

==Completion==
So the Alliance is probing the twists and turns of the high road?

Even if they were to map it out, they couldn't attack these hills in numbers. This is our land, <name>. And they will pay dearly for presuming otherwise.

==Progression==
{{Bael'dun Keep}}
