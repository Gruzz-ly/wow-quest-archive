==Objectives==
Gather ten Unusual Flower Buds from [[Budding Flower]]s in the [[Overgrowth]].
*[[Unusual Flower Bud]] (10)

==Description==
The great [[archdruid]] [[Naralex]] recently appeared here in the [[Barrens]]. He's either behind this mess or trying to fix it. Either way, you should talk with him before this jungle engulfs [[Azeroth|the whole world]]! He's in a [[Overgrown Camp|small tauren camp]] to the southeast.

Along the way, it would be helpful for you to gather plant samples for him to study. The newest flower buds will tell him a great deal about the most recent changes in the jungle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
I am extremely busy, <class>.

==Completion==
Ah, samples from different parts of the overgrowth? These will be immensely helpful, yes. Thank you, <class>.

==Progression==
{{The Overgrowth}}
