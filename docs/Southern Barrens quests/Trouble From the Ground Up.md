==Objectives==
Gather 10 Unusual Flower Buds from [[Budding Flower]]s in the [[overgrowth]].
* [[Unusual Flower Bud]] (10)

==Description==
[[Corporal Teegan|Teegan]]'s a fool to think the [[quilboar]] caused this sudden overgrowth. Look around you. I've been watching these plants bloom and sprout daily - each generation is more mutated than the last. This isn't tribal [[magic]] - it's something primal. And dangerous.

The day before last a great [[druid]] passed through our camp. Seek out [[Naralex]], somewhere in the midst of this jungle. He'll know what to do.

And bring him some plant samples from around the overgrowth to help his studies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
I am very busy, <class>. This uncontrolled growth threatens to engulf the continent. Do you have any news?

==Completion==
Ah, samples from different parts of the overgrowth? These will be immensely helpful, yes. Thank you, <class>.

==Progression==
{{The Overgrowth}}
