==Objectives==
Use Soothing Seeds on 6 [[Deviate Terrortooth]]s or [[Deviate Plainstrider]]s and observe the results.  
*Results Observed (6) 
*[[Soothing Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
Based on what you've brought me, I think we may have a solution. I've imbued the lashvine seeds with healing energies.

Simple contact with these should imbue the creatures here with enough energy to force out the corrupted influence.

Go and attempt to heal the mutated raptors and plainstriders by sprinkling the seeds on them, and report the results back to me. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did it work?

==Completion==
Oh dear. It seems the forces at work here are a bit difficult to control...

Please, don't bother Naralex with this. It will only upset him.

==Trivia==
[[File:Taming Campfire pet.jpg|thumb|The Campfire pet]]
*Known as the "Exploded Raptor" or the "Campfire" pet, Hunters were able to tame the [[Deviate Terrortooth|raptor]] or [[Deviate Plainstrider|plainstrider]] as fire. The hunter would need a friend who has yet to complete this quest to use the seeds on a raptor or plainstrider that the hunter is taming in order to get the fire model instead of the beast model. This was clearly a bug and Blizzard later hotfixed and made the tamed pets no longer burning flames.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_xYuM3GROA?t=448 Kargoz on YouTube]</ref>
