==Objectives==
Deliver the [[Roadway Plans]] to [[Kilrok Gorehammer]] at [[Hunter's Hill]] in [[Southern Barrens]].
* [[Roadway Plans]] (Provided)

== Description ==
This bundle of papers was found in a leather satchel hidden under the officer's clothes.

Battle maps of the region depict [[Honor's Stand]], connected to what appears to be a large unfinished roadway crossing the [[Barrens]] all the way from [[Theramore]]. It looks like the [[Alliance]] plans to build a road from the coast straight into the heart of [[Kalimdor]]!

[[Kilrok Gorehammer]] will want to see this.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||22}}

== Progress ==
Ah, you say you found something on one of the bodies?

== Completion ==
<Kilrok pages through the plans you discovered.>

This explains much, <name>. No wonder our foes are so hellbent on taking the southern Barrens. It's at the center of their plans for the continent!

But they didn't account for us, did they <class>?

==Progression==
{{Hunter's Hill}}
