==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Honor's Stand Footman|Honor's Stand Footmen]] and 1 [[Honor's Stand Officer]].
* [[Honor's Stand Officer]] slain
* [[Honor's Stand Footman]] slain (8)

==Description==
Do you see the trail below us, <name>? That is MY trail. And if the [[Alliance]] dogs choose to use my trail, they'd best be looking over their shoulder.

It's time to collect my toll! Slay the footsoldiers from [[Honor's Stand]] and see if we can't send them scurrying back to their walls.

Be sure to take out at least one of their officers patrolling the road. They need to realize that nobody is safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
I take great pleasure in striking the Alliance and disappearing into these hills. They must think they are facing far greater numbers.

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>. It will be some time before we can assault the hold proper, but until then, we must teach them to fear the [[Barrens]].

==Notes==
The officers drop {{item|Roadway Plans}}, which start the next quest in the chain.

==Progression==
{{Hunter's Hill}}
