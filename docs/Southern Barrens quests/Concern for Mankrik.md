'''Concern for Mankrik''' is a quest which leads players to [[Mankrik]] in the [[Southern Barrens]].

==Objectives==
Bring [[Mahka]]'s Gift to [[Mankrik]], south of [[Firestone Point]].
* [[Mahka's Gift]] (provided)

==Description==
I would ask a favor of you, <class>.

A [[warrior]] named Mankrik passed through our camp not long ago, on a lonely journey. [[Olgra|His wife]] was killed by the [[quilboar]], long ago, and he still seeks revenge. I cannot forget his eyes...burning with inconsolable hatred, every waking moment.

We did not talk long, but I cannot bear to think of him out there alone. Please, bring this to Mankrik, and tell him it is from me... 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||2|}}
* 180 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Mankrik snarls.>

What is it!? I'm busy!

==Completion==
Mahka sent you?

<Mankrik's fury quells for a moment.>

It is a small comfort. But nothing can console me until I am done here.

==Notes==
Mankrik is a little way to the south, at {{coords|44.6|88.0|Southern Barrens}}, west of the road. He carries a Horde banner and a [[Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade]] banner and is surrounded by dead [[quilboar]].

==Progression==
{{Firestone Point}}
