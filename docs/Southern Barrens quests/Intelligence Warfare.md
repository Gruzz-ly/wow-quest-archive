==Objectives==
Kill a [[Barrens Operative]] and retrieve the [[SI:7]] Briefings.  
*[[SI:7 Briefings]] 

==Description==
I am convinced the [[Alliance]] is using [[Spy|spies]] to scout the field and pass along information. They knew to strike at [[Taurajo]] while the hunters were afield. And they countered every one of [[Gar'dul]]'s moves like he was an open book.

Well <name>, I for one will not be outplayed. Not here. We will win the battle for intelligence.

Even now I hear reports of Alliance operatives slinking around in the shadows, especially here, outside these very walls. Kill them and bring me back something of use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Watch your back, <class>. They could be anywhere.

==Completion==
Hah! The fool didn't destroy these orders.

Let's see what we can learn...

==Notes==
You can either confront the [[Awkward Gangly Orc]] or fight a [[Barrens Operative]] found outside the walls of [[Desolation Hold]].

==Progression==
{{Desolation Hold}}
