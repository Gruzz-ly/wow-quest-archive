==Objectives==
Capture a neutral hill in the [[Fields of Blood]] and defend it against an [[Alliance]] counterattack.
* Point Captured
* Point Defended

==Description==
The Alliance scorches a trail of murder across the [[Barrens]]. We must stop them here or there is nothing left for us.

Across the Fields of Blood there are a number of strategic hills, marked by wooden [[tower]]s and neutral gray [[banner]]s. We must take and hold these hills if we hope to slow the Alliance advance!

Look for the towers to the north, east, and south of [[Ruins of Taurajo|what's left of Taurajo]]. Claim a neutral flag and defend the hill against counterattack! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sternhorn's Shield

You will also receive:

* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Is the Alliance putting up a fight? How goes the battle for the Barrens?

==Completion==
So you held your ground! With tenacity like yours we may yet drive the Alliance from our lands.

==Notes==
Upon clicking a [[Field Banner]], creating Horde Field Banner and receiving the buff Defending the Point, four [[Horde Field Defender]]s appear and start constructing [[Horde Field Barricade Wall]]s.
