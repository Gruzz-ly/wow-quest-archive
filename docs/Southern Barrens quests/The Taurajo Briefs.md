==Objectives==
Search the [[Ruins of Taurajo]] for 3 pieces of Taurajo Intelligence.
*[[Taurajo Intelligence]] (3)

==Description==
[[General Hawthorne|The General]] is too preoccupied with the [[Taurajo Looter|looters]] in Taurajo. Too soft! We ought to be focused on our next move against the [[Horde]].

There's valuable intelligence that might be compromised if we allow the ruins of Taurajo to continue to burn. While you're running the General's errand, dig around for any maps or notes you can find. I can speak a little of the [[Orcish (language)|orcish tongue]] - I'll be able to make sense of what you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Have you searched the ruins yet?

==Completion==
What have you dug up for me? Hmm. Interesting. This notice from [[Orgrimmar]] indicates a change in Horde leadership is underway - I guess heads are going to roll after what we did to Taurajo.

What's this? A death warrant for the General here! This is good to know... Very good to know...
