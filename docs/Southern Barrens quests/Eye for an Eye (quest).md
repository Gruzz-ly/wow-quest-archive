==Objectives==
Slay [[Captain Peake]] and deliver his eyes to [[Oltarg]].
*[[Captain Peake's Eyeballs]] (2)

== Description ==
Who goes there? Your footsteps are not the lazy stride of a [[guard]].

A <class>, you say? Still brave and free? There's no hope for me, friend. I have lost my eyesight and am no longer fit for battle.

I dared speak up while Captain Peake savagely beat one of the [[prisoner]]s. In return he kicked me in the head. And kept kicking. He kicked me blind, <race>.

You'll find Captain Peake at the top of this tower. If you seek justice, bring me his eyes.

If he does not part with them willingly... so be it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Peake is a monster. If his superiors knew, they would thank the [[Horde]] for ending him.

==Completion==
You have them? I'll take your word for it. Hearing Peake scream like one of his victims is reward enough for me.

Now leave me be, <name>. I do not wish to be a burden to my [[clan]]. 

==Notes==
The captain is found on top of the tower where [[Oltarg]] is.

==Progression==
{{Hunter's Hill}}
