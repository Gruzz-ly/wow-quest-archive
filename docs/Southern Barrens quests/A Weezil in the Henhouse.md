==Objectives==
Head into the [[Bael'dun Keep|Bael'Dun Keep]] and kill 10 Bael'Dun Dwarves ([[Bael'dun Rifleman|Riflemen]], [[Bael'dun Soldier|Soldiers]], and [[Bael'dun Officer|Officers]].) Then find [[Weezil Slipshadow]], who should be hiding within.
*Bael'dun Dwarves Slain (10)

==Description==
<Gann grasps you with a blood-caked hand.>

My wounds are great but I will not rest until the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Bael Modan]] pay for their crimes. <Wheeze> We smuggled a man inside their fortress during our last raid. A [[goblin]] saboteur: Weezil Slipshadow.

Create a disruption at the gates - kill who you can - then slip inside the fortress of Bael'dun to the south and find Weezil.

That stronghold <cough> can only be destroyed from within, and Weezil can't do it alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Quite, you big plodding brute! Keep your voice down.

If they spot us talking, pretend I'm just ordinary cheese.

==Completion==
You do good work, <class>. That riot you caused at the fortress entrance has these dwarves running around with their heads cut off.

==Progression==
