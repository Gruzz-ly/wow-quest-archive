{{questportrait|Three-Tooth.jpg|Three-Tooth|Use the Bramblestaff to turn her magic against her.}}
==Objectives==
Use the Bramblestaff on Three-Tooth and kill her 2 Deviate Crones in the [[Overgrowth]].
* [[Three-Tooth]] Dealt With
* [[Deviate Crone]] slain (2)
* [[Bramblestaff]] (provided)

==Description==
According to [[Ambassador Gaines|Gaines]], "Three-Tooth" is what the [[quilboar]] call their matriarch. She's been twisting the thorns of this crazy jungle to her own ends, and it was her orders that Gaines be "torn apart and fed to the overgrowth." Nice lady.

Let's give her a taste of her own. Take the Bramblestaff you recovered, and use it on Three-Tooth to take her out of the picture. Then kill the crones she's been training, to ensure nobody else can take her place. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Three-Tooth Bracers
|Quilboar Crone Gloves
|Three-Tooth Armguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I can see why the [[Horde]] hates these little nuisances. Have you taken on Three-Tooth yet?

==Completion==
...Torn limb from limb!? Well, I'd almost feel bad but the burning hatred gets in the way. She got what she deserved.

<Corporal Teegan takes the Bramblestaff and snaps it over his knee.>

Problem solved.

==Notes and trivia==
Using Bramblestaff on Three-Tooth summons a [[Merciless Jungle Vine]] that kills her and stuns the crones.

She used to say several lines, but as of {{Expac|Shadowlands}}, they are broken and do not display or display as empty say lines.

The name of the quest is a play on "You picked a fine time to leave me," which is a tagline from the Kenny Rogers song, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_(Kenny_Rogers_song) Lucille].
