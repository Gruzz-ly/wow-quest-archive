==Objectives==
Arm 6 Frazzlecraz Explosives in the [[Frazzlecraz Motherlode]] [[Goblin Mine|mine]].
*[[Frazzlecraz Explosives]] Armed (6)

==Description==
It's not enough to kill 'em - after [[Bael'dun Keep|Bael'dun]], I want to give those [[goblin]]s a taste of their own.

Go into [[Fenton Frazzlecraz|Frazzlecraz]]'s mine and arm a pile of the explosives inside.

At the entrance to the mine you should see some sort of switch or [[Big Nasty Plunger|plunger]]. Once the explosives are armed, use the plunger to blow that place sky-high. Put the fear in 'em, <class>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,750 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
<The plunger has a number of jury-rigged wires leading into the mine.

==Completion==
<The explosives are armed and ready!>
