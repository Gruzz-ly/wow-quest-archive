==Objectives==
Kill 5 Outgrowths and find a Squirming Heart.  
*[[Outgrowth]] slain (5) 
*[[Squirming Heart]] 

==Description==
If I have truly sown chaos, it is time for reaping.

The lumbering outgrowths of plant life shamble through the imbued stream here, <name>. They are a direct manifestation of the unstable forces mutating this area. Slay as many as you can, and we might be able to slow the spread of the overgrowth further.

And while you're at it...be on the lookout for parts of them that appear especially corrupted. Bring any such pieces to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Cutting down the outgrowth will merely buy us some time. Have you found any suspicious pieces?

==Completion==
<Naralex slowly takes the squirming heart from you, visibly disturbed.>

I've been a fool. The one truth I did not want to accept has been staring me in the face this entire time...this foul thing is proof of that.

You and I have much work to do.
