==Objectives==
Kill 8 Taurajo Looters in the [[Ruins of Taurajo|ruins of Taurajo]].
*[[Taurajo Looter]] slain (8)

==Description==
Outstanding work at the [[Great Gate|gates]], <name>! The main body of the [[Alliance]] force is in general retreat. But I'm not satisfied.

They sacked [[Camp Taurajo|Taurajo]], which was little more than a hunters' camp. This 'Alliance' is unmasked at last for what it really is: A renegade band of butchers.

Even now a group of [[human]]s linger behind to pick at the bones of smouldering Taurajo.

<Bloodhilt hurls an axe into the dirt.>

Make them suffer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you cleared out Taurajo?

Killing those vultures is but a taste of the vengeance I plan to reap on these [[Theramore]] scum.

==Completion==
Excellent. I'll have their bodies strung up along the [[Gold Road|gold road]] as a message to the Alliance.
