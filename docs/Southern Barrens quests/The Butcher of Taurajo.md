==Objectives==
Speak with [[Karthog]], then lure out and assassinate General Hawthorne.
*[[General Hawthorne]] slain

==Description==
This operative had orders to secure the roadways between the Alliance command and Fort Triumph. General Hawthorne is on the move.

<Bloodhilt crumples the documents in his fist.>

It's HIM, <name>! Hawthorne - I spit the name - he is the one who ordered the assault on Taurajo! Now we know when and where to strike him down. Quickly, follow the road north of the Battlescar and meet up with my assassin Karthog. CRUSH Hawthorne and string his body up along the road!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Battlescar Monnion
|Cloak of Harvested Fear
|Taurajo Butcher's Blade
|Battlescar Amice
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
<Bloodhilt orars impatiently.>

Is the deed done? Tell me! What news?

==Completion==
<Upon hearing the news, Bloodhilt snorts. His eyes gleam. He tips his head back and bellows a wet, cackling laugher that echoes between the blackened walls of Desolation hold and reverberates throughout the hills beyond.>

So it is done! The Butcher of Taurajo is felled at last. Cut down in the streets like a dog. Fitting.

You have done well, <name>. You've sowed fear into our enemies, and soon we will reap the harvest!

==Notes==
;Interacting with Karthog
:{{text|whisper|Karthog|Psssstt - <name>! Over here! By the tree.}}

:Slow down, friend. You say the General is coming?

:Now THERE'S a trophy for my wall! I'll distract the bodyguards, but it will be up to you to kill General Hawthorne himself. Are you ready to strike?

:{{Gossip|I am ready, Karthog. For the Horde!}}

:{{text|say|Karthog|Blood and thunder!}}
:{{text|say|Karthog|They come! Everyone, get ready...}}

Karthog and a [[Horde Field Defender]] attack the general and his two [[Triumph Captain]]s. Kill them.

:{{text|yell|Karthog|He's ours! The Butcher of Taurajo is dead!}}
:{{text|say|Karthog|We'll string his body from the trees and leave him swinging in the wind for the Alliance to discover. Go back and tell Warlord Bloodhilt the news!}}
