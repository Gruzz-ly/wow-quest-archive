==Objectives==
Slay 4 Rageroar Lieutenants and acquire Rageroar's Helm by killing [[Karga Rageroar]].
* [[Rageroar's Helm]]
* [[Rageroar Lieutenant]] (4)

==Description==
I have encountered the [[Rageroar clan]] before, <name>. They are led not by an orc, but by a monster - a war-gorged fiend without a shred of decency or compassion. He and his lieutenants must be killed, not just to save Northwatch, but for the good of all of Azeroth.

Karga Rageroar wears a helm. Execute him, <class>, and bring the helm to me. It is of ... particular importance.

Rageroar has made his camp across the chasm, east of here. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Boots of the Fallen Brother|Rageroar Trophy}}

You will also receive: {{cost||60}}

==Progress==
Is he dead? Do you have his ... helm?

==Completion==
<Tolliver grasps the helmet reverently with quivering hands.>

Rageroar's battleships intercepted our vessel as we fled from Gilneas. We were to be carried here as trophies to the Warchief. As we neared the shore, some of us fought back. Rageroar - he began killing indiscriminately - howling with laughter. Our ship capsized and he ordered his men to fire at us as we drowned. Few of us made it to land.

Afterwards, I learned that he wore my brother's scalp as... as a trophy.
