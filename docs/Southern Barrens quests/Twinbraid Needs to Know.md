What... WHAT!?

Bael'dun in ruins? Corpses everywhere - no. No!

<You describe the evidence you found at the scene.>

The Bilgewater goblins, was it? They want a fight do they? We'll show 'em what it means to be a part of the Horde, we will. I'll fill the Battlescar with their corpses. I'll redden the dirt with their blood.
