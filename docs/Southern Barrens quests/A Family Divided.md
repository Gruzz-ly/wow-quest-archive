==Objectives==
Find [[Kirge Sternhorn]] at [[Vendetta Point]] in [[Southern Barrens]].

==Description==
The [[child]]ren you see here were all rescued from [[Camp Taurajo|Taurajo]] when the fighting started. I'm trying to track down their parents.

One of the [[refugee]]s you rescued from the [[quilboar]] recognized the strongest child as belonging to Kirge and [[Mawre Sternhorn]]. Moreover, he said Kirge was camped at the [[Fields of Blood]], just north of the Taurajo massacre site.

<Name>, please go there and tell Kirge Sternhorn that his child is alive and well!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||15}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Completion==
<Kirge listens intently and then falls to one knee.>

Alive! My boy still lives! Praise to the [[earthmother]], I still have a son.

<Kirge composes himself.>

<Class>, my boy's mother didn't make it out of Taurajo alive. I will avenge her death, even if it means my son grows up without either of his parents.
