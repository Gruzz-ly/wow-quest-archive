==Objectives==
Kill Feegly the Exiled in the [[Bael Modan Digsite]].
* [[Feegly the Exiled]] slain

==Description==
Saddest story I ever heard told, <name>. Feegly was one of our fastest diggers, until he got a hold of that - thing. "The [[:Tear of the Moons]]" we called it. It changed him. Remade him. I wish it had stayed buried.

Feegly was banished from [[Bael Modan]] but I've heard reports he's come sniffing around the dig site again. He's suffered enough, the wretched thing. If you find him down there, put ol' Feegly out of his misery.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bael Modan Monnion
|Feegly's Shroud
|Misery's End (sword)
|Bael Modan Amice
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Feegly is scaring the other diggers. The Horde is bad enough - to be haunted by one of our own is intolerable.

==Completion==
<Marley nods grimly.>

Aye, it's for the best I suppose.
