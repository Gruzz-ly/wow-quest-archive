==Objectives==
Kill any combination of 5 [[Plains Prowler]]s or [[Plains Pridemane]]s.
*[[Barrens]] [[Lion]]s Slain (5)

==Description==
If you seek vengeance on our [[Alliance]] invaders, you would do well to observe the fiercest of predators in the [[Barrens]].

The [[lion]]s that stalk amongst the tall grass do so with cunning, stealth, and power. Learn from their example and you will understand the kind of war we need to fight.

Hunt the plains prowlers and pridemanes, then return to me to discuss what you have learned. You will often find them in the shade of large trees.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
The Barrens is a harsh land, but I have come to love it. How are you faring?

==Completion==
Ah yes... I see a cunning in your eyes that was not present before. Well done, <class>.

==Progression==
{{Vendetta Point}}
