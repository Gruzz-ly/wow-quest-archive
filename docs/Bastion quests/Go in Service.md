==Objectives==
Meet [[Kleia]] at Hero's Rest.
* Take the Gateway to [[Hero's Rest]] {{co|56.0|52.8|Bastion}}

==Description==
We cannot waste any more time. We must get an audience with the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]], before this next attack happens!

We need to find a way to get you to Elysian Hold... and quickly!

Hero's Rest is a place of respite for the aspirants of Bastion. You can see it floating above from across the fields.

Meet me there when you can. I have a plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|38|70}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Polemarch? He is the right hand of the Archon!

She truly believes us. We still have a chance!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kleia|We must get this information to the Archon. Meet me at Hero's Rest, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I will prepare Centurions for an attack!}}

Head north and northeast along the road to reach a gateway that leads up [[Hero's Rest]]:
:{{text|say|[[Katrina]]|Welcome, mortal. This gateway will take you above.}}

Before taking the gateway, [[Pelodis]] offers an optional breadcrumb to a side quest chain: [[A Friendly Rivalry]]:
:{{text|say|Nemea|Your ways lack finesse, Pelodis. Your phalynx do whatever you command. There's no cultivation, no give and take.}}
:{{text|say|Pelodis|And yours lack efficiency, Nemea! You spend your days building relationships, while I spend mine taking action and making a difference!}}

Take the gateway:
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|I understand, Kleia. We must call the Polemarch. He can present you to the Archon.}}

==Progression==
{{By the Archon's Will}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
Take the gateway:
:{{text|say|Kleia|[DEPRECATED] You must understand. The Mawsworn are already within our ranks! Another attack is imminent.}}
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|[DEPRECATED] With this new information, perhaps the Archon will feel differently about your previous report.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|[DEPRECATED] Unfortunately, the signal device is currently broken. You will need help to fix it.}}
