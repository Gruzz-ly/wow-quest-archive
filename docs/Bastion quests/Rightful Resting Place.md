Enshrine the Spear of [[Kalliope]] in its rightful place at [[Elysian Hold]]/[[Hero's Rest]].
* [[Spear of Kalliope]] (provided)

==Description==
You have truly proven yourself a hero in the eyes of those who are its absolute judge.

I thank you for giving me the honor of holding it, even for this briefest moment. However, it is only proper that you be the one to enshrine the spear at it's{{sic}} rightful resting place.

Let us meet at Elysian Hold/Hero's Rest where you can do the honors.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|65|25}}
* 3,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The resting place of the spear lies before you.>

==Completion==
<Place the Spear of Kalliope in its rightful place knowing that only a true hero can do so.>

==Notes==
If the player is not a part of the [[Kyrian Covenant]], the spear is instead enshrined at [[Hero's Rest]].
