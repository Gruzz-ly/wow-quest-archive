==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Mnemonic Locus]].

==Description==
The attack on the [[Temple of Purity]] is unprecedented in [[Bastion]]. At least, to my knowledge.

We need to know more. The fragment that the Paragon captured may contain the answers we seek.

There is a place nearby called the Mnemonic Locus. There, aspirants and [[ascended]] alike can call forth their memories and store them away. If we can look through this fragment's memories, perhaps we can learn more about the so-called [[Forsworn]] and, with luck, uncover their plan.

I will meet you there. Go in service.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|38|70}}
* 870 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Mikanikos gestures irritably toward the Forsworn behind him.>

Are you here to help fix THIS?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kleia|The Forsworn may attack again. We need to warn Hero's Rest.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos| I will warn them while you finish your mission, but Kleia... please come back to me.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Always.}}

On the way, an event is available at [[Sophia's Aria]], Vesper Repair. Three players must interact with the Ancient Incense at the same time to complete the objective.

Head north to the [[Mnemonic Locus]]:
:{{text|say|Image of Locus-Keeper Mnemis|Access to the Locus is currently restricted.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I MADE you! I am the Forgelite PRIME!}}
:''The mnemis unit teleports away.''
:{{text|say|Kleia|Oh no... we may be too late.}}

Kleia has new gossip once she arrives at the Mnemonic Locus:
{{book|content=The Forsworn have overtaken this place, too... is all of Bastion under their sway?

I hope Pelagos got the word out in time, but we must focus on our task here. We must learn who is behind these attacks!

Speak with Mikanikos to pick up the next quests:
{{book|content= Look what they have done to my Centurions! To the Locus!

<Mikanikos gestures angrily at, well, everything.>
