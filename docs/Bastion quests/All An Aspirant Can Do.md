==Objectives==
Return to [[Aspirant's Rest]].

==Description==
I think we can agree that such a reply feels... somewhat hollow.

I choose to take faith that we have done all we can. All of us. I do not know what comes next, but perhaps the path will reveal itself. In the meantime, [[Pelagos]] and [[Kleia|I]] will return to Aspirant's Rest for a moment of respite.

We will meet you there, though there is no need to hurry.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|36|35}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Kleia smiles warmly at you.>

Does this mean you intend to stay?

==Notes==
:{{text|say|Pelagos|The Archon said nothing of kyrian serving the Maw?}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Perhaps she does not believe it. We have but the word of a single aspirant.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Though one would think that would be enough.}}

Return to Aspirant's Rest. There, Kleia and Pelagos are speaking with [[Disciple Kosmas]]:
:{{text|say|Kleia|We will help however we can.}}

This concludes the "The Aspirant's Crucible" chapter of the [[Bastion storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[The Temple of Purity (quest)]].

I think we can agree that such a reply feels... somewhat hollow.

I choose to take faith that we have done all we can. Both of us. I do not know what you intend to do now that you have delivered your message. Should you remain in [[Bastion]], I am certain there will be more opportunities to aid the [[kyrian]].

We could certainly use the help, if I am honest.

The choice is yours. [[Pelagos]] and I will return to Aspirant's Rest for a moment of respite.
