==Objectives==
Turn these notes in to [[Inkiep]] in [[Hero's Rest]].

==Description==
<You have stumbled upon some messy notes. Some of the lines seem incomprehensible while others seem melodic.>

Like wind and rain, discord storms my mind, tossing and blowing.<br>
...
I must find the golden skies.<br>
...
Remember, walk on, heart full of hope, and you'll never walk alone.

<It seems as though an aspirant cannot find their way home. You should inform someone at Hero's Rest.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|47|73|60}}
* 10,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, these wise words are certainly Eurgon's. I'm happy to report he made it home.

== Trivia ==
This quest is a reference to the famous Liverpool F.C. chant You'll Never Walk Alone and Eurgon is a reference to Jürgen Klopp, Liverpool's Football Manager at the time.
