==Notes==
;Upon approach (from Stranger reputation level)
:{{text|say|Sika|Maw Walker need something too? Add to my list.}}

Or if at 'Buddy' reputation level
:{{text|say|Sika|<Name> needs something? I put at top of my list!}}

;Upon accept
:{{text|say|Sika|Very sad. Ember Court fun. Maybe next time...}}

;Talk to [[Aspirant Ikaran]]
:{{text|say|Aspirant Ikaran|Oh yes! Of course I'll help. This is a wonderful opportunity to help the Forgelite Sophone and perhaps learn from her at the same time.}}

;Talk to [[Forgelite Sophone]]
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Sika is so sweet and works so hard. I can be better about keeping the forge clean to reduce her worries.}}

;Talk to [[Aspirant Leda]]
:{{text|say|Aspirant Leda|Oh. I had spoken to Sika about reorganizing the library and she seemed so happy to do it. I had no idea she was so busy. I will take care of it!}}

;Approaching [[Adonas]]
:{{text|say|Adonas|Please, Maw Walker... I am in need of... healing...}}
:{{text|emote|Adonas grimaces in pain as he holds his side.}}

;After bandaging Adonas
:{{text|say|Adonas|It will be sore for awhile but I think I can fly again. Thank you.}}

;After asking to help [[Sika]]
:{{text|say|Adonas|It would be an honor to assist Sika. I can ensure that her upcoming supply shipments arrive intact and without delays.}}

;Upon handing in the quest
:{{text|say|Sika|Notes not new work... notes offer help?}}

;Asprant Ikaran, Adonas, Forgelite Sophone and Aspirant Leda approach
:{{text|say|Aspirant Ikaran|Yes, Sika. We had no idea you were feeling so overwhelmed.}}
:{{text|say|Adonas|You do so much for us. Let us help you this time.}}
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Go relax and enjoy the Ember Court with <name>. We'll take care of everything while you're away.}}
:{{text|emote|Sika looks unsure for a moment, before a big smile crosses her face.}}
:{{text|say|Sika|Sika... have kind friends. Sika... go party!}}
:{{text|say|Aspirant Leda|You earned it, Sika. Have fun.}}

;Gossip after completion
:Master Mikanikos is very busy. Sika makes sure Forgelite has what she needs, yes!
