'''Imminent Danger''' begins the "The Temple of Courage" chapter of the [[Bastion storyline]].

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Thanikos]] at [[Xandria's Vigil]].
* Fly to the [[Temple of Courage]] {{co|51.0|49.0|Elysian Hold}}

==Description==
The Temple of Courage must not fall!

All [[kyrian]] learn to fight in its hallowed halls. Not only to protect [[Bastion]], but to ensure their own safety when retrieving [[soul]]s from across the veil.

Travel there at once. Seek out Thanikos, the [[Xandria|Paragon of Courage]]'s loyal hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|41|}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Not quite the army I hoped would come, but I welcome your blade by my side.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|[[Cassius]] will provide you with a [[larion]]. Go, quickly!}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Yes, Polemarch! Archon watch over us all.}}

Speak with Cassius:
:Where would you like to fly to?
:{{gossip|I need to go to the Temple of Courage.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|The Forsworn who destroyed the ward... he was the one from Lysonia's memories...}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|It seemed that their pact with the Maw was kept secret from him. I wonder... are the other Forsworn also unaware of it?}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|If that is the case, then perhaps--By the Archon... Kleia, look!}}

A cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Lysonia|The ward has been sabotaged, as we agreed.}}
:{{text|say|[[Helya]]|Good. Our allies are eager to strike.}}
:{{text|say|Mawsworn Champion|The kyrian temples will fall, and the Archon's reign shall be ended!}}

On the other side of the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|I am glad to see I am not yet alone. The Maldraxxi attacked without warning!}}
