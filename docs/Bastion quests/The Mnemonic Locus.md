==Objectives==
Use the [[Anima Conduit]]s to restore the Mnemonic Locus.
* [[Mnemonic Locus]] activated

==Description==
<[[Mikanikos]] examines the scroll you retrieved for him.>

Right, right.

Soul mirrors and Locus are tied together. If we restore anima to mirrors, it should repair the Locus back to full functionality. Thankfully, the cores you brought should be sufficient.

All I need to do is enable conduits. Simple!

Well? Go on. You know how to use these, yes?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Reverberating Silver Band]]
* {{cost|11|93|40}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wait to hear the hum of anima, yes.

==Completion==
I love the hum of anima. It has been a long time since I have heard it in such abundance.

==Notes==
The seven [[Anima Conduit]]s in the area light up. Upon accept
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|The conduits are active. Supply them with the anima I gave you.}}

Stand in the circle and use the extra button:
*Empower Extractor - Use the anima collected from the Forsworn to empower the Mnemonic Locus.

:{{text|say|Kleia|Mikanikos, can the Locus extract memories from this as well?}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|And that is...?}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|A fragment of essence from one of the Forsworn. It may hold the secret of their origin.}}
:''Mikanikos and Kleia move to the fourth, and she places the [[Fragment of Lysonia]] upon it.''
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Intriguing...}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Ah! The Locus is functional once more.}}

==Progression==
