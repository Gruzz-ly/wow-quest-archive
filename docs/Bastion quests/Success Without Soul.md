==Objectives==
Talk to [[Pelodis]] at [[Forgefire Outpost]].

==Description==
The [[larion]]s seem to truly enjoy your company, [[Andira]] most of all.

I hope you've come to understand and appreciate the nuance of working with a beast with free will.

Now you must spend time with Pelodis, down the hill. His [[phalynx]] may be effective, but working with them only brings hollow satisfaction.

I am sure working with the phalynx will only strengthen your appreciation of larions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Completion==
I understand you met with Nemea first.

Take solace in the fact that you will not be working with crazed beasts here.

==Notes==
This quest is only available if you haven't done Pelodis' questline. Otherwise, [[Pride or Unit]] is next.

==Progression==
{{Pride or Unit}}
