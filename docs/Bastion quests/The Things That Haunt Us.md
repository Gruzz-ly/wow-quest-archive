==Objectives==
Slay 12 memories.
* [[Memory|Memories]] slain (12)

==Description==
As you will soon learn, a ritual cleansing can be a... painful process.

In most cases, the upwelling of emotion is harmless. It can even generate [[anima]] under the right circumstances.

However... sometimes the result is far less pleasant. Negative memories can take a form of their own and manifest in a violent fashion.

I fear [[Pelagos]]' attempt at cleansing has brought forth such monsters. You must destroy them, and quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
The things that bind us can be violent. The insight we gain is no reason to let them run rampant.

==Notes==
Accept both of Kleia's quests:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Pelagos may soon succumb to doubt and fear. Make haste.}}

[[Klystere]], the [[stable master]], offers a side quest nearby: [[The Old Ways]]. Pick it up, or not, then head into the tunnel to the northeast of Kleia, killing [[Clinging Memory|Clinging Memories]] and [[Bitter Memory|Bitter Memories]] along the way to the far west end of the cave to reach [[Pelagos]]. Take advantage of the Resolved Trauma buff, which turns all memories neutral, to quickly exit the cave.

This completes the "Eternity's Call" chapter of the [[Bastion storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[The Aspirant's Crucible]].
