==Objectives==
Gain entrance into the Vault of the Archon.
* Gain entry to the [[Vault of the Archon]]
* Follow [[Mikanikos]] {{co|57.9|68.6|Bastion}}
* Help [[Kleia]] {{co|57.9|66.8|Bastion}}
* Enter the Inner Vault {{co|56.2|67.6|Bastion}}

==Description==
Behind me is the entrance to the Vault of the Archon. As you can see, it is warded against all unauthorized intrusion.

To make yourself an authorized entrant, place the offerings you collected before the guardians. You may then browse the contents of the vault at your leisure.

Do consider that such access is coveted among the Forsworn and is the sole focus of their efforts here. I advise preparing for combat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|86|80}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am very pleased to meet you. The Vault has not received visitors in some time.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|Simply place the offerings before the guardians and the way will open.}}

Interact with the two [[Vault Guardian (Bastion)|Vault Guardians]]:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I admit. I mostly wanted to get in here to prove that I could. This is neat.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Stay focused. We have a purpose here.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|What? Another barrier?}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|Ah, you meant to access the INNER Vault? I am afraid that is another protocol entirely.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|You did not think to mention that earlier? Bah. Never mind. I will fix this.}}

Speak with Mikanikos:
:<Mikanikos seems very intent upon the runes before him.>
{{gossip|What do we do now?}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Mortal! I could use your help out here!}}

Defend Kleia from the waves of [[Umbral Phalynx]], [[Forsworn Researcher]]s, and [[Dark Vault-Seeker]]s. Once five have been defeated:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|The barrier is down! Get down there and do what you came to do!}}

Ignore Kleia and run to the east:
:{{text|say|Vault-Keeper Mnemis|Welcome to the Vault of the Archon. Please state your purpose for our records.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Just how many of these did you build?}}

==Progression==
