==Objectives==
Collect 6 Adrima's Lily.
* [[Adrima's Lily]] (6)

==Description==
For forge to light, need more [[anima]]. Always more. Never too much, for forge!

<Sika consults her scroll and nods vigorously as she reads.>

Out in fields, there is a glowy flower. The round thing inside. Bulb? It glows. So, has anima. From the ground, we think.

According to scrolls, it is called Adrima's Lily. We do not know who [[Adrima]] is. But the lily is good.

Get flowers, too. Not just bulbs. Petals make stewards happy, too. 

Thank you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have flower bulb things?

==Completion==
Oh. They smell nice. And they glow lots.

This is good. Yes.

==Notes==
Pick up all three quests, then head northwest.

[[Adrima's Lily]], [[Languishing Etherwyrm]]s and [[Starved Etherwyrm]]s are found northwest of [[Aspirant's Crucible]], just past the [[Anima Extractor]].

==Progression==
