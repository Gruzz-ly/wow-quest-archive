A scene plays:
:{{text|say|Devos|This is dire news, Vesiphone. But the Archon has turned a deaf ear to such tidings in the past.}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|The circumstances have changed.}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Tell me of these Forsworn.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|Most have merely lost faith and may yet be redeemed.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|But some have fallen so far as to wield the power of the Maw itself.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|It is true. This mortal has fought against ascended who are in service of the Jailer. Lysonia is not the only one.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|We do not know when or where the Forsworn will strike next. But strike, they will.}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|What you speak of is unthinkable. But we must remain vigilant, nonetheless.}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Paragons, return to your temples. Adrestes, monitor the wards.}}
:{{text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|It appears you have a part to play in all of this, mortal. Let us see what comes of it. Go in service.}}
