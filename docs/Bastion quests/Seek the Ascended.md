'''Seek the Ascended''' concludes the [[Oribos]] portion of the [[Shadowlands intro experience]]. Up next is the [[Bastion storyline]]!

==Objectives==
Journey to Bastion to inquire about the [[Mawsworn|Maw kyrian]].
*Speak to Roh-Avonavi to Travel to Bastion
* Travel to [[Bastion]] {{co|55.7|51.6|Oribos|1}}

==Description==
When you arrive in [[Bastion]], seek out one of the [[kyrian]]. Explain that you require an audience with the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]]. Like the Arbiter, she is one of the [[Eternal Ones]] who rule over the [[Shadowlands]].

If anyone can guide you to the truth, it is the Archon. Perhaps she will even know a way to end this [[anima]] drought.

Once you find the answers you seek, you are welcome to return to Oribos.

Purpose guide your path, mortal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The way is open again! Archon be praised!

==Notes==
Speak with Roh-Avonavi again to head to Bastion.
:The ways are re-opening. Has the Purpose sent you to us for this I wonder?

:{{Gossip|I am ready. Send me to Bastion.}}

On the other side, at the [[Vestibule of Eternity]] of [[Bastion]], [[Kleia]] is shocked by the presence of a traveler:
:{{text|say|Kleia|By the Archon... the way is open?}}

==Progression==
{{Stranger in an Even Stranger Land}}
