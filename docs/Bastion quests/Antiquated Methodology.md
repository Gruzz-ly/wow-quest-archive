==Objectives==
Talk to [[Nemea]] at [[Nemea's Retreat]].

==Description==
You possess the correct mindset for retraining a [[phalynx]]. I believe you could find great success here.

Before you commit, I implore you to go across the hill and introduce yourself to my rival, [[Nemea]]. She believes that her unreasonable, free-willed [[larion]]s are better partners than my perfect phalynx.

Experience her lifestyle so that you may know how much greater my work is.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Completion==
Pelodis sent you, did he?

Sure his phalynx follow orders, but where is their depth?

==Notes==
This quest is only available if you haven't done Nemea's questline. Otherwise, [[Pride or Unit]] is next.

==Progression==
{{Pride or Unit}}
