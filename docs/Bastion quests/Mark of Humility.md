==Objectives==
Obtain the Mark of Humility from within the [[First Chamber of Kalliope]].
* [[Mark of Humility (item)]]
*Meet Artificer Ligiea in front of the Third Chamber of Kalliope at Kalliope's Rest.

==Description==
Quartermaster, you've arrived.

Those fools over there still haven't gotten past the first barrier. We need to get into that cave to have any chance at recovering the [[:Spear of Kalliope]].

Our research discovered the phrase, "Only the humble find their way. Even heroes kneel before virtue." But those fools have been working on that clue for ages.

Go figure out the problem and get inside that cave. We need its mark to open the final vault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|65|25}}
* 3,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you acquired the mark?

==Completion==
Well done, quartermaster. Well done. The Spear of Kalliope is almost within my grasp!

==Notes==
;On accept of both
:{{Text|say|Artificer Ligiea|There have been so many disappointments in the search for the spear.}}
:{{Text|say|Artificer Ligiea|See to it you do not add your name to the list.}}

Upon approaching a [[Forsworn Relic Hunter]], they say
:{{text|say|Forsworn Relic Hunter|I used to wander these halls. How am I no longer worthy?}}
:{{text|say|Forsworn Relic Hunter|The text says, "Only the humble find their way. Even heroes kneel before virtue.}}
This provides the hint that one must kneel to bypass the ward. Click on the extra action Kneel button or type /kneel.
:{{Text|say|Forsworn Relic Hunter|How did you do that?}}
:{{Text|say|Forsworn Relic Hunter|What?}}

In the chamber, the [[Servant of Kalliope]] (a [[Centurion]] Goliath) says:
:{{text|say|Servant of Kalliope|The Mark of Humility. Symbolizing one's resilience against arrogance and pride.}}
:{{text|say|Servant of Kalliope|Humility is not only about the self. It can take many forms.}}
:{{text|say|Servant of Kalliope|There will come a time when you will seek the aid of someone you branded as an enemy. I pray humility allows you to see the path.}}

Loot [[Kalliope's Cache]] for the Mark.
