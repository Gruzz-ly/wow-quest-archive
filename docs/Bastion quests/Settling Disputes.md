==Objectives==
Meet with [[Pelodis]] at [[Forgefire Outpost]] or [[Nemea]] at [[Nemea's Retreat]].

==Description==
In my search to find [[kyrian]] that would fit our purposes here, I have landed on two in particular -- Pelodis and Nemea.

However, the two are involved in quite the rivalry, and struggle to focus their attention elsewhere. I propose that you aid them in settling their dispute so that they may focus on the task at hand.

I doubt they shall work together, however, so you will need to pick one to aid us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|38|70}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, you come to aid in my dispute. Allow me to show you my ways.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
