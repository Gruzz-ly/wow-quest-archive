==Description==
Ah, [[Athanos]]. It remains undefeated, as intended.

Still, you have exceeded any expectation I might have had. You are stronger than many that have come before you.

You have come here for a purpose, and Kleia has illuminated a path that she believes you can walk. I agree. I have opened the way to the Crucible's final rite.

Kleia will instruct you further. Go in service, <name>.

Gather yourself. This is how you will find your way before the Archon. I am certain of it.
