==Objectives==
Kill 15 Void forces.
* [[Void]] forces slain (15)

==Description==
These Void invaders are wiping our forces from existence!

My disciples fall, returning their [[anima]] to the lands.

If we fail to drive them from our lands, more than [[kyrian]] will be lost. First [[Bastion]], then the [[Shadowlands]] as a whole.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
The Void's hunger is relentless. We must push them back before they devour us all.

==Completion==
Wherever you step, you leave a wake of vanquished Void forces in your path.

You give your peers time to breathe.

==Notes==
Objectives are [[Seething Voidripper]]s, [[Vile Oozeling]]s, [[Corrupted Cloudfeather]]s, [[Voidbound Commander]]s, [[Voidguard Invader]]s, [[Void Lasher]]s, and [[Twisted Voidcaller]]s.

You can pick up [[Agthian Spear]]s for extra damage.

==Progression==
{{In Agthia's Memory}}
