{{Stub-section|Needs transcript of Voitha's gossip text.}}
Dialogue when you restore the first ancient instructor:
:{{text|say|Ancient Instructor|Steel yourself against the temptation to judge. All souls will go before the Arbiter, and all souls will reap what they have sown.}}
:{{text|say|Ancient Instructor|The last moments of another's life are yours only to decide if their time among the mortal realms is finished.}}
:{{text|say|Ancient Instructor|Leave all else to the Arbiter and the Eternal Path. This is our charge.}}

Dialogue when you restore the second ancient instructor:
:{{text|say|Ancient Instructor|Only when you remove yourself from the experiences of others can you see their truth.}}
:{{text|say|Ancient Instructor|Know that to peer into the life of another is to understand them as an individual, to see their true selves without judgment or reservation.}}
:{{text|say|Ancient Instructor|Bear not your person into their lives-for their existence is their own.}}

After restoring the ancient instructors, speak with Voitha who has this to say:
{{book|content= The Forsworn are relentless in their pursuit of our knowledge. Even as we speak, they seek the ancient scrolls compiling all of the Paragon's considerable wisdom.

I do not know for what purpose, but I think it is safe to assume it is not to learn.

Please, retrieve these scrolls. My disciple will bear you to them.

{{gossip|I will retrieve the scrolls.}}
}}

After speaking with Voitha, a [[Disciple of Humility (Bastion)|Disciple of Humility]] carries the player to collect the text.
