==Objectives==
Aid [[Bastion]] by completing Side Quests, Bonus Objectives, World Quests, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in Bastion dungeons.
*Aid the [[Kyrian]]

==Description==
You are no aspirant, but I welcome any aid that [[Oribos]] might bring us in these dire times.

Please, aid our people in any way you can. With [[anima]] in low supply and the insidious [[Forsworn]] encroaching from all sides, there is no shortage of trials to overcome.

Do this for us, and I will see to it myself that our almighty [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]] hears of your deeds in service of the kyrian. Mark well my words, and follow the path.

==Rewards==
{{stub-section}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Honortoll Gavel
|Honortoll Spear
|Memoria Glaive
|Memoria Greatblade
|Memoria Spellblade
|Requiem Chime
|Requiem Handscythes
}}

You will also receive:
*61,700 [[XP]]
*{{cost|374|40}}
*[[Plume of the Archon]]

==Progress==
How goes your time in the Archon's realm?

==Completion==
Word has spread across Bastion of your deeds since your arrival here.

You have proven yourself a worthy ally of the kyrian. Take this gift in thanks, and go in service.

May we cross paths again soon.

==Notes==
*For [[Kyrian Covenant]] members, [[Kalisthene]] is in the [[Elysian Hold]]. For all other players, she's at [[Hero's Rest]].
*The Beasts of Bastion—[[Aethon]], [[Cloudtail]], [[Nemaeus]], and [[Sigilback]]—can be used to quickly gain a chunk of progress on this quest. Each beast gives 4% progress, for a total of 16% if you summon and kill all four.<!-- Does killing them additional times after other players summon them still work? -->

==Progression==
{{The Threads of Fate}}
