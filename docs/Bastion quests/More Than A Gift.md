==Objectives==
Acquire 1 Cultivated Windblossom.
*[[Cultivated Windblossom]]

==Description==
You have no idea what you just delivered, do you?

<She opens the parcel to reveal a wreath of [[Larion]] plumage.>

I will explain, but first... I wish to return the favor.

[[Klystere]] and I frequent a resting place to the north of here, along the path to the [[Temple of Courage]]. We planted a flower for our enjoyment, as we spend so much of our free time there.

Bring me this bloom, if you would be so kind. Then I will tell you about the significance of this gift.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 8,850 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Did you find the place I mentioned? And the flower?

==Completion==
This is perfect. I appreciate your efforts on my behalf.
