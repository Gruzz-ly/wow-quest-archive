==Objectives==
Disguise yourself as a member of [[House Iremoore]] and steal the [[House Briarbane]] mascot.
* [[House Iremoore Disguise]]
* House Iremoore Disguise worn
* [[Balthazar]] stolen while disguised
* Balthazar delivered

==Description==
The [[Prince Renathal|Prince]] wishes to host court? Well, that should be interesting...

I am sure you understand that one musn't{{sic}} give without receiving something of value in return. It sets a terrible precedent, provides unrealistic expectations, and encourages beggars.

So you shall do something for me.

House Briarbane are very proud of their new mascot. They have been flaunting it in the streets and irritating the other houses.

Steal it for me, but incriminate one of the other houses in the act.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[The Countess]]

==Progress==
It would be a shame to waste such a fine mascot on such an unworthy house.

==Completion==
Lovely. That should keep the houses distracted while I attend the Prince's soiree.

*This quest becomes available after using the [[Guest List Page#Fourth guest]] rewarded by [[Discerning Taste]].
