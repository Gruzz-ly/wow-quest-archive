==Objectives==
Find Gatamatos in the [[Golden Pasture]] and return him to his pedestal in [[Forgefire Outpost]].
* [[Gatamatos]] found
* Gatamatos returned

==Description==
As part of their training, I order my [[phalynx]] units to march the fields, keeping an eye on the wildlife and any goings-on.

Unfortunately, last time they returned they were one fewer in number.

Please search the Golden Pasture and search for the missing unit, then return it here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
My phalynx units require occasional repairs to keep them operational. If one is overlooked, it may malfunction.

==Completion==
This unit seems to be malfunctioning. We will have to perform some repairs.

==Notes==
The following messages may occur after finding Gatamatos:
*{{Text|emote|Gatamatos malfunctions, attacking a nearby creature!}}
*{{Text|emote|Gatamatos is malfunctioning! Reactivate him.}}

==Progression==
{{Pride or Unit}}

==Patch changes==
