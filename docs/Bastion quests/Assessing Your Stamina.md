==Objectives==
Participate in 8 combat meditations.
* [[Sparring Aspirant|Combat meditations]] completed (8)

==Description==
The trial ahead will test you on many levels. I, like [[Kleia]], wish to assess your willingness to endure.

Look around you. All the aspirants here train for the very trial you are to attempt. Some have been here, honing their skills, for centuries. Ages. Some grow quickly, some do not.

Your task is to engage them in friendly, armed combat. Among the [[kyrian]] this is known as a combat meditation.

Help them find focus, and they shall help you do the same.

Return to me when you feel ready to continue.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Trust in the process, <name>.

==Completion==
To fight so many, in so short a time, is truly a feat of stamina.

I am tired just looking at you.

<Pelagos laughs.>

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out. [[Sparring Aspirant]]s are all over the area, and the three named quest targets are marked on the map.
