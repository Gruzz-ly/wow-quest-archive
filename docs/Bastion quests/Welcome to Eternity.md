'''Welcome to Eternity''' begins the [[Bastion storyline]].

==Objectives==
Speak with Kleia.
* Speak to [[Kleia]] {{co|37.5|76.4|Bastion}}
* Follow Kleia {{co|42.1|78.3|Bastion}}

==Description==
Forgive my reaction. You see, the way from [[Oribos]] has been closed for quite some time. We did not know if it would ever open again.

I welcome you, noble soul, to [[Bastion]]. Your deeds in life have earned you a most glorious fate! You are to become a [[kyrian]], a winged bearer of the dead.

My name is Kleia. It would be an honor to introduce you to our beautiful realm. There is much you must learn before your journey can begin.

Gather yourself. When you are ready, we will venture on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|81|70}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The [[Greeter Mnemis|Greeter]] will soon answer all of your questions. That is its purpose, after all.

<Kleia smiles at you.>

I hope you are excited. I certainly am!

==Notes==
Players arrive at [[Vestibule of Eternity]] of [[Bastion]], where [[Kleia]] is resting, lost in thought. She is shocked by the presence of a traveler:
:{{text|say|Kleia|By the Archon... the way is open?}}

Accept the quest, then speak with Kleia again:
:You likely have many questions. Do not worry! All will be explained in good time.

:Are you ready to begin the next chapter of your existence?

:{{gossip|Lead on, Kleia.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|It is my pleasure to welcome you to Bastion! Though... you are like no soul I have ever seen before. No matter.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|You are to become one of the kyrian! It is our sacred charge to bring mortal souls before [[the Arbiter]] for judgment.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|It has been an age since we last welcomed a new arrival. [[Greeter Mnemis|The Greeter]] will tell you more... as soon as we awaken it.}}

;Demo description
Greetings, new arrival!

I am Aspirant Pelagos. It is my honor and pleasure to welcome you to [[Bastion]]!

I am certain you have many questions. Please rest assured that all will be answered, in time. We feel the best way to acclimate to an eternity in Bastion is 
to simply press on.

Down this hill you will find a resting place. There, my friend and mentor Kleia will help you begin your journey.

Welcome again. and do take your time. This is forever, after all!

;Demo completion
Ah, you must be one of the new arrivals that Pelagos spoke of. It is good to meet you.

;Alpha description
Forgive my reaction. You see, the way from [[Oribos]] has been closed for quite some time. That it is open once more is surely a sign that all is well once more!

Now you are here. You have arrived in [[Bastion]], oh noble soul. Your deeds in life have earned you a most glorious fate.

Before we begin your next journey, please tell me. What news from Oribos?
