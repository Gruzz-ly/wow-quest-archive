==Objectives==
Collect memories of the [[Forsworn]] from the [[Fragment of Lysonia]].
* Speak to [[Mikanikos]] {{co|57.5|61.8|Bastion}}
* [[Memory of the Forsworn]] (10)
* Imbue the Fragment of Lysonia {{co|57.6|61.7|Bastion}}

==Description==
It may be possible to extract memories from fragment, but I worry they will not be useful. This is not whole kyrian, but a tiny piece! A weird, broken piece. It cannot even speak!

We will apply extractor and see what comes out. Extractor might explode. It might not. For this? Worth the risk, I think.

Do not know what will emerge. Could be memories. Could be nothing. Could be something else. May try to fight you! Stay on your guard, yes? Collect all that look Forsworn.

Speak when ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|86|80}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you think we will get the information we need, <name>?

==Completion==
We did it. With any luck, her memories are within our grasp.

==Notes==
Speak with Mikanikos again:
:No idea what will happen, trying to extract memories from fragment like this.
:Remember: looking for Forsworn memories. Take anything that is purple and has wings. Or maybe is centurion...
:I honestly do not know what we are looking for, but if it is in there, extractor will pull it out!
:Give the word and I will activate extractor.
{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:''The screen fades to white as [[Memory Fragment]]s walk from the mirrors to the locus.''
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Oh, good, Locus did not explode.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Lysonia's memories of the Forsworn are scattered among the rest.}}<!-- Didn't show up, needs double-checking. -->
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Simple enough to collect Forsworn memories. Others can go into the archives.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Should not explode. Probably.}}

Fragments of many forms walk from the mirrors to the locus. Most are friendly kyrian or various forms of wildlife, but a few are Forsworn kyrian. Kill [[Forsworn Memory Fragment]]s and collect the quest items. After collecting 10:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Fragment is ready! Take it to soul mirrors to view memories.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|I leave it to you, <name>. You have faced Lysonia before.}}

Click on the [[Fragment of Lysonia]] and the scene fades to white for a moment. Players are debuffed with Essence of Lysonia - Carrying the Essence of Lysonia, allowing the bearer to witness her memories.

Turn in to Kleia.

;Objectives

*[[Forsworn]] memories collected (0/100%)
* Absorb the [[Essence of Lysonia|Essence]] {{co|57.6|61.7|Bastion}}

;Description
It may be possible to extract memories from this fragment, but I worry they will not give you the information you need.

It is highly unusual to use the [[Mnemonic Locus|Locus]] in this way, but perhaps we can distill the pieces you want. In a manner of speaking, of course. Extracting memories is more of an art than a science.

I will explain what to do. Speak to me when you are ready to begin.

;Speaking with Mikanikos
:I have no idea what may happen, trying to extract memories from a fragment like this.

:But if this is what you need, it's the least I can do to repay you for your help in restoring the Locus.

:When you are ready, we can begin.

Originally, it was required to stand between the memory and the locus to collect the memory. Occasionally, hostile [[Volatile Memory|Volatile Memories]] spawned.
