==Objectives==
Meet [[Overseer Kah-Sher|Kah-Sher]] in the [[Ring of Transference]] in [[Oribos]].
* [[Transport Portal]] used

==Description==
We will all suffer if [[Bastion]] and [[Maldraxxus]] fall into war.

We have not heard from the [[Necrolord Covenant|Necrolords]] as of late. You must travel to their realm and seek the truth of their incursion.

Though our [[anima]] reserves remain low, they will be enough to open the way for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|41|}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This slot shall suffice.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|The way to Maldraxxus must be opened. Gather Kah-Delen and see it done.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|At once, honored Voice.}}
:''Kah-Sher moves to the center ring to confer with Kah-Delen.''
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|Kah-Delen, a most solemn task has been placed upon us.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Delen|Word of the attack spreads quickly. I will join you.}}
:''They take the transport pad upstairs.''

Follow them, then head northeast to reach the future location of the Maldraxxus portal:
:{{text|say|Overseer Kah-Sher|I hope this endeavor is successful. There is still little anima available.}}
