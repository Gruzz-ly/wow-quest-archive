==Objectives==
Ride Theonara to [[Aspirant's Crucible]].
* Ride [[Theonara]] {{co|48.0|74.1|Bastion}}
*Speak to Forgelite Sophone.

==Description==
I have given [[Kalisthene]]'s words some thought.

If you are to learn our ways, we should proceed as if you were an aspirant yourself. The next step is to journey through the Aspirant's Crucible.

It is a place of reflection, training, and cleansing. For an aspirant, it is where they prepare for the long journey ahead. For you... I hope you will learn how you might help us in this time of crisis.

Word of your arrival has likely spread. We will not keep them waiting.

Take my steed, and go in service.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|36|35}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The Forgelite studies you for a moment, then nods.>

Welcome. You are not what we expected, but we are glad to have you nonetheless.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Go on ahead. Pelagos and I will make our way over on foot.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Must we walk? I am fairly fatigued after my trial.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Consider it part of your training, my friend.}}

At the [[Aspirant's Crucible]], find [[Forgelite Sophone]]:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|So the rumors were true. Come. Let me look at you.}}
