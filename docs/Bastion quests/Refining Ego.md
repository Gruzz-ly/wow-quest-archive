==Objectives==
Collect 8 Purified Metal by collecting [[Tainted Centurion Component]]s from [[centurion]] units and smelting them down at the [[Eternal Forge]].
* [[Purified Metal]] (8)

==Description==
I will locate [[Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons|Phaestus]]. In the meantime, task for you!

The [[Forsworn]] use my forge to make their centurion army. Their vile intentions warp the metals we use!

Destroy their centurions, take their parts. Smelt them down in the forge to purify the metals, then return to me.

I need much metal for my plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I keep my resources here. The Forsworn stole from me! I cannot let this stand.

==Completion==
We shall use this metal for many purposes. For the Crest, and for my goliath!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I will locate Phaestus. You collect metals! No scratches, no imperfections!}}

Pick up the other two quests before heading out.

Kill mechanical units, not humanoids, for the metal. They drop a [[Tainted Centurion Component]] on occasion. Once enough has been gathered, head to the forge in the center of the area and use the quest items to turn them into [[Purified Metal]].

On return:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|And another thing! Have you seen what they have done to my forge? The surrounding stairs are covered in soot, and the flame is precisely 3.5 degrees too hot!}}

==Progression==
