==Objectives==
Retrieve "The Infinite Treatises", "Worlds Beyond Counting", and "Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code."
* [[The Infinite Treatises]]
* [[Worlds Beyond Counting]]
* [[Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code]]

==Description==
Greetings. You must be the new aspirant everyone is talking about.

I thought you might like to learn more about us. There are three tomes that would serve you well as a starting point, but they are not currently in the library.

[[Aspirant Leda]] was the last to hold "Worlds Beyond Counting." Aspirant Ikaran has yet to return "The Infinite Treatises."

It seems "Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code" went missing some time ago. I would search the village.

Once returned, you can read them at your leisure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|58|83}}
*8,850 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Did you find the scrolls I suggested?

==Completion==
I will see that they are returned to their proper places for everyone to enjoy.

I appreciate your help in retrieving them, and I hope they were informative.

==Notes==
;Aspirant Ikaran
:I wonder if the [[Forgelite Sophone|Forgelite]] will teach me how she made her weapon...

:Oh, can I help you with something?
:{{Gossip|Do you have "The Infinite Treatises?"}}
:{{text|say|Aspirant Ikaran|The crafters of [[Bastion]] have had eternities to perfect this compendium... do take good care of it. It is itself a work of art.}}

:{{Gossip|Do you know where I can find "Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code"?}}
::No, but I heard whoever held that scroll got attacked by etherwyrms!

::That could just be a rumor, though...

::{{Gossip|I see.}}

;Aspirant Leda
:Ah! You are the new arrival everyone has been talking about.

:I heard you are from a world called '[[Azeroth]].' I hope to visit it one day!

:Did you need something?
:{{Gossip|Do you have "Worlds Beyond Counting?"}}
:{{text|say|Aspirant Leda|Some day I will visit all the many worlds out there. Maybe even yours!}}

:{{Gossip|Do you know where I can find "Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code"?}}
::Not with any certainty, no.

::Have you checked the trees in the village outskirts? I had seen aspirants reading there, before the etherwyrms moved in.

::{{Gossip|I see.}}

[[Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code]] drops from [[Languishing Etherwyrm]]s.

==Progression==
{{The Aspirant's Crucible}}

==Demo version==
{{Rfa-section}}
It was started by [[Scrollminder Vasi]].

;Description
Greetings!

This one is Vasi, keeper of scrolls. She prescribes readings so you may learn our ways.

<Vasi references her ledger.>

According to our records, you will need some basic texts that are no longer in our library.

[[Aspirant Leda]] was the last to hold "Worlds Beyond Counting," [[Aspirant Ikaran]] has yet to return "The Infinite Treatises," and [[Aspirant Thete]] must still be absorbed in "Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code."

We advise you to retrieve these so your study can begin.

;Aspirant Thete
<She seems to be meditating>
:{{Gossip|Do you have "Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code?"}}
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thete|Are you interested in becoming a Watcher as well? I might recommend the thirty-third verse for its particular importance.}}

;Completion
This one will put these back in their proper places. Then you may read at your leisure!
