==Objectives==
Introduce yourself to 5 Tamed Larions.
* [[Tamed Larion]] met (5)

==Description==
[[Pelodis]] insists that [[phalynx]] are superior to all autonomous beings, taking orders without fail.

But where is the nuance? Where is the reward for your effort?

[[Larion]]s make fantastic companions, but you must build a relationship with them. Introduce yourself to my pride. You will see that each has a personality of their own.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Larions are free-thinking beings. They will decide whether you are accepted within the pride.

==Completion==
My pride is generally wary of newcomers, but they seem to accept your presence.
