==Objectives==
Recover the Anima Conflux, Eternity Plating, and Archonic Resonator.
* [[Anima Conflux]] {{co|40.8|52.2|Bastion}}
* [[Eternity Plating]] {{co|39.7|52.7|Bastion}}
* [[Archonic Resonator (2)]] {{co|39.5|48.9|Bastion}}

==Description==
I can rebuild this [[Centurion|colossus]]' core systems, but a few things are beyond repair. Thankfully there were enough centurions present here I believe we can improvise.

Replacements are in order!

I require an Anima Conflux to charge its systems, some Eternity Plating to protect its core, and an Archonic Resonator to make it go boom!

I'll take care of the rest. Quickly, now!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the parts?

==Completion==
That was fast! Well done, well done indeed!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|The sooner you find those parts the sooner this colossus can help clear their flyers!}}

Conflux:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Anima powers all things in Bastion, even the mighty colossi. This will help it retain its charge.}}

Plating:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Nalthor is truly powerful if his magic penetrated this plating. He will not go down easily.}}

Resonator:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|This is one of Mikanikos' finest creations. It channels anima directly into blasts of energy.}}

==Progression==
