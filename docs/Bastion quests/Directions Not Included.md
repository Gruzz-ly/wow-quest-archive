==Objectives==
Find the Locus Manual among discarded scrolls in the [[Mnemonic Locus]].
*[[Locus Manual]]
*Meet Mikanikos near the Locus.

==Description==
Look at this place! What a mess. The Locus is inactive and these "[[Forsworn]]" have taken over.

We need to restore the Locus, but I do not know how. This place was built long, long before my time.

Luckily for us, the [[First Forgelite|Forgelite Prime before me]] was a prolific soul. She recorded everything. If we can find her designs for this place, I am certain I can work out the rest. Even without my Mnemis' help.

Look around. There are plenty of scrolls strewn about. Meet me near the Locus when you find it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|86|80}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the scroll?

==Completion==
You found it! And many other interesting tomes besides. I will see them properly catalogued when we are finished here.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Was that... a Mnemis unit?}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Do not want to talk about it. But yes.}}

Defeat [[Converted Praetor]]s and [[Dark Goliath]]s for their cores and to clear a path to scrolls in various states of damage.

Loot the Locus Manual:
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|I advise you to return those scrolls to their proper places. Only Forsworn are authorized to browse the collection.}}

Before finding the correct scroll, players may find any of the following: [[Memories and Miracles: An Exploration]], [[Soul Mirrors And You]], [[In Memorium]], [[Crumpled Ledger]], [[Stewards are the Archon's Gift to Bastion: A Treatise]], [[Getting Past Your Burdens]] and [[Hand-Bell Sheet Music]].

==Progression==
