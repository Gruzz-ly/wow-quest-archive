* [[Forsworn Researcher]] questioned
* Chamber Brazier lit (2)
* [[Mark of Knowledge (item)]]
*Meet Artificer Ligiea in front of the Third Chamber of Kalliope at Kalliope's Rest.

==Description==
There is another matter for which I need your assistance. My researchers and interrogators have been tirelessly working on the second chamber. So far they don't have any leads.

I need you to speak to them and see if they've made any progress. Tell them, if they have nothing to show, then they will soon find themselves at the end of my sword.

Get me that mark, quartermaster!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|65|25}}
* 3,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the mark? If not, then why are we speaking?

==Completion==
One step closer to my goal.

==Notes==
;On accept of both
:{{Text|say|Artificer Ligiea|There have been so many disappointments in the search for the spear.}}

;Speaking with a Forsworn Researcher
:Yes, Quartermaster?

:{{Gossip|Ligiea demands progress! Tell me what you know of the Mark of Knowledge!}}
:{{Text|say|Forsworn Researcher|I'm sorry Quartermaster, we've read every scroll! However, the only thing we've discovered is that it somehow involves that brazier in front of the statue of Kalliope.}}

To enter the room, the player must take the fire from the [[Brazier (Bastion)|Brazier]] in front of the statue of Kalliope to both [[Chamber Brazier|unlit braziers]] in front of the room.

There, a [[Servant of Kalliope]] will say:
:{{text|say|Servant of Kalliope|The Mark of Wisdom. A beacon against ignorance and fear}}
:{{text|say|Servant of Kalliope|Knowledge without wisdom's guidance has led to the folly of many.}}
:{{text|say|Servant of Kalliope|Take heed. The trials before Bastion will require you to seek a path. When that day comes, choose wisely.}}

Loot [[Kalliope's Cache]] for the Mark.
