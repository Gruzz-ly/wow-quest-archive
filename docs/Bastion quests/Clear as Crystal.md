==Objectives==
Drain [[Necrotic Extractor]]s to empower the Anima Conflux.
* [[Anima Conflux]] empowered
*Meet Mikanikos at the Shattered Span.

==Description==
This Anima Conflux is completely drained of [[anima]]! Just a heavy hunk of metal!

Not your fault, of course. Not at all. But we need to charge it!

The [[Maldraxxus|Maldraxxi]] have extractors. Big green crystals, can't miss them. They're using it to drain anima from fallen [[kyrian]]. Very bad!

We can use them to charge the conflux, then our colossus here will be functional again!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Not fully charged, but close enough! May have to disable a few safety features...

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|We shall all meet at the Shattered Span below once our work is done.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Loud and clear! I will just... move the colossus... somehow...}}

On the completion of both quest objectives:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Our forces have gathered at the Shattered Span. I shall meet you there.}}

Head to the Shattered Span:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Your forces are already pushed back. You have lost.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|The colossus needs to finish charging. Buy me time!}}
