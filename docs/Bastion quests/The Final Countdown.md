==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|image=Marrowmaw.jpg|name=Marrowmaw|text=Prized offspring of Amarth's mount, Bonefang.}}
Delay Amarth the Harvester until the Colossus is fully charged.
* Speak to [[Thanikos]]
* [[Amarth]] delayed
* Blockade cleared

==Description==
If the [[Amarth|necromancer]]'s brood descends upon us fully before the colossus is charged, we will perish. There is no question.

We must keep his attention until [[Mikanikos]]'s work is complete.

He believes that the day is already won -- that we are pawns to be toyed with. We can use his hubris to our advantage to buy precious seconds.

May it be enough.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Waylight Shoulderpads
|Waylight Epaulets
|Waylight Shoulderguards
|Waylight Pauldrons
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|48|20|40}}
* 8,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Our only move now is forward, outsider.

==Notes==
Speak with Thanikos again:
:If we fall, at least we will fall fighting.
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Call down your beasts. They will perish just like the rest!}}
:{{text|say|Amarth|Fool. My army is all around you.}}

A small wave spawns. Defeat all of them:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Is that all you have? I expected more!}}
:{{text|say|Amarth|We are unending. Piece by piece, you will fall.}}

A larger wave spawns. Clear out the group:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|It is nearly at full power! Just a bit longer!}}
:{{text|say|Amarth|That is enough. Bonefang's spawn could use a treat.}}

[[Marrowmaw]] spawns. Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Amarth|Come, kyrian, if you are so bold. Fulfill your destiny.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|The colossus is ready! Come! Come!}}

Hop in the [[Centurion Colossus]].
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Fire when ready!}}

It has one ability:
:{{Abilities|Anima Barrage|Fires a torrent of concentrated anima blasts at all nearby enemies.|notes=3 sec cast|id=325940|icon=ability_socererking_arcanereplication}}

Use it:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|FIRE!!!}}
:''The centurion clears out the sky.''
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Now that is how you take care of business!}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|He has gone towards the paragon!}}

==Progression==
{{The Temple of Courage}}
