==Objectives==
Answer Kleia's question.
* Speak to [[Kleia]]
* Let Kleia handle this

==Description==
I have given your presence here some thought, <name>.

It is clear to me that you are no ordinary arrival from [[Oribos]]. I do not know why you are here, nor what you hope to achieve. That alone is simply unprecedented.

You must understand... individuals do not merely come to [[Bastion]] on a whim. This fate is earned, and those that are chosen for it are uniquely suited to this existence.

So... I ask you... why are you here, truly?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|81|70}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Kalisthene peers down at you.>

We have heard you, mortal.

==Notes==
Speak with Kleia:
:Why is it you have come here, <name>?

:{{gossip|<Tell Kleia what you saw in the [[Maw]].>}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|[[Kyrian]]... in service of the Maw? That cannot be!}}
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|What is the meaning of this?}}
:''Kalisthene and [[Ascended Champion]]s arrive.''
:{{text|say|Kleia|They must have sensed that I enabled the Greeter. I will handle this, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|Why is this Mnemis unit active? We can ill afford this anima expenditure.}}
:{{text|say|Greeter Mnemis|Goodbye.}}
:''Kalisthene casts a spell on the greeter.''
:{{text|say|Kleia|Ascended one, this newcomer brings troubling news of kyrian in the Maw. We must inform [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|the Archon]]!}}
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|A grim fate. But if the [[Arbiter]] judged them deserving of it, then the matter is not our concern.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|These were not prisoners, but willing servants. Surely this merits an audience!}}
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|There is but one way to earn an audience with the Archon: to walk the path and prove worthy of ascension.}}
