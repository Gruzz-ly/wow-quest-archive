Assist [[Eridia]] in cleansing [[Nikolon|Disciple Nikolon]].
*Assist Eridia {{co|60.2|78.1|Bastion}}
*Speak to Fallen Disciple Nikolon {{co|60.0|77.9|Bastion}}
*Speak to Eridia

==Description==
This disciple... such emotion...

<Eridia stares at Nikolon for a long moment.>

Rarely do ascended require such rigorous cleansing, but I cannot deny what is readily apparent. This disciple will fall if I do not intervene.

There is no time to lose. Come. I will instruct you.

... I only hope we are not too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|47|26|80}}
*8,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Eridia grips her hammer with pale knuckles.>

How... how are they so numerous?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eridia|Pelagos, mind the stewards. <Name>, come with me. We will put this disciple's pain to rest.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|Thank you. Thank you!}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|We will begin when you are ready, <name>.}}

Follow Eridia and Nikolon outside, then speak with Eridia again:
:Such an intensive cleansing may require your martial expertise.
:Are you prepared to aid me?
*{{gossip|Yes, Eridia.}}
*{{gossip|Why is Pelagos excluded like this?}}

Pelagos:
:He is... more fragile than most, when it comes to cleansing. I would not want him to lose his way. What we are about to do can be very unpleasant to witness.
:You... I very much get the sense that you can handle the occasional dramatic event.
{{gossip|I see.}}

Say 'Yes, Eridia':
:{{text|say|Eridia|You know the ritual, disciple. Open your mind. Let the vesper cleanse it.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|I will. I... why does it hurt?!}}

Five [[Nikolon's Uncertainty|Nikolon's Uncertainties]] appear. Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Eridia|Remain calm. Trust in the process.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|It is the process that grinds our aspirants into dust. How can I trust it?}}

Three [[Nikolon's Distrust]]s appear. Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Eridia|There is only one path for you, disciple. That is forward, through this pain!}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|How can you endure this? How can you watch them suffer, unmoved?!}}

Two [[Nikolon's Doubt]]s appear. Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Eridia|Our faith binds us all! This is the path we were chosen to walk!}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|We will all fall. All of us. That is where the path leads!}}

[[Nikolon's Despair]] appears. Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|... I cannot save them... I cannot even... save... myself.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|Nikolon...}}

Speak with Fallen Disciple Nikolon:
:<The disciple breathes heavily.>
:This is... I am...
:{{gossip|Are you well?}}
:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|If this is truly the only way, then I will find another.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|I cannot help you now. Perhaps... the Temple of Loyalty can.}}
:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|It is already too late. They are coming. And I will stand among them.}}

Speak to Eridia again:
:I do not understand. Stand among...
:<Eridia's eyes widen.>
:No. That is impossible.
{{gossip|What is it? What is wrong?}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|Nothing, I--}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Eridia! The wards! They've--}}

A cutscene plays. Forsworn kyrian drop out of the skies, incapacitating kyrian and stealing their anima. On the other side of the cutscene, the Temple of Purity has been besieged by the Forsworn:
:{{text|say|Lysonia|Forsworn! The Temple is ours.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|I know that voice! No... no, this cannot be!}}

;Description
You have seen what happens when Aspirants exude their burdens.

They can be excised, removed, with some efficiency. But the process, if not undertaken carefully, can leave scars. It can cause a buildup of resentment and fear of that pain.

I fear Nikolon has allowed his scars to fester. He now harbors doubt of the process,  doubt which can be very dangerous.

Come, I need your aid. Let us see if we can set him back on the path.
