==Objectives==
Help [[Forgelite Sophone]].
* Carry raw materials {{co|52.8|83.5|Bastion}}
* Clear the [[Anima Forge Vent|vents]] (2)
* Tidy Up (5)

==Description==
I think we have the materials I will need to light the forge, at long last.

I am afraid the place is in a state of disrepair. Between failed attempts at working without anima and simple neglect, I cannot hope to work the forge as it currently stands.

I would very much appreciate your help to get the place in order while I coax the forge to life once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am deeply grateful for your help. Now I can practice my craft again!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sika|Fix forge! Fix forge!}}
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Stewards exist exclusively to be of aid to us. They become rather depressed when they cannot perform their duties.}}
:{{text|say|Sika|We help good.}}

Pick up the crate of [[Raw Materials (Bastion)|Raw Materials]] between Sika and Sophone before following them. Place it just into the [[Basin]] to the left of Sophone:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|If you could tidy up a bit, I will have this forge lit in short order.}}

The two vents are on either side of the forge. Interact with both of them, then interact with the other broken items in the area: [[Broken Barrel (Bastion)|Broken Barrels]], piles of [[Broken Glass]], [[Unfinished Shield]]s, and [[Unfinished Weapon]]s.

After cleaning up enough:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|There we are.}}
