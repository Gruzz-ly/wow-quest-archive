Collect an Umbral Plume from [[Darkwing (Bastion)|Darkwing]] in [[Greatwing Roost]] for [[Eumelia]].

==Description==
The [[Cloudfeather]] matriarch, Darkwing, has fallen to a great and terrible sickness. She has grown aggressive, dominating her children and driving them to violence.

Darkwing must be slain if her flock is to ever return to the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]]'s grace.

Please use the attached whistle to call her to her nest. I shall consider one of her crown feathers sufficient proof of the deed.

--Eumelia, Stable Master
