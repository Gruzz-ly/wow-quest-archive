==Notes==
As players enter the area, [[Stanikos]], the Maw Walker's biggest fan, will run up:
:{{text|say|Stanikos|Hi!}}

He then chimes in on occasion after combat:
*{{text|say|Stanikos|Exciting!}}
*{{text|say|Stanikos|I clap my hands for you!}}
*{{text|say|Stanikos|So impressive!}}
*{{text|say|Stanikos|Victory!}}
*{{text|say|Stanikos|We are in awe!}}
*{{text|say|Stanikos|Win please!}}
*{{text|say|Stanikos|Wooooow!}}
*{{text|say|Stanikos|Yay!}}
*{{text|say|Stanikos|You are best!}}

When the first three centurions are defeated, Kalisthene's Challenge (Athanos) becomes available.
:{{Text|say|Kalisthene|Your strength has grown since your first spar. Let us offer you a more fitting challenge.}}
:{{text|say|Stanikos|Good luck! He is very strong.}}

As Athanos finishes the player off, Stanikos runs back up to heal the Maw Walker before leaving:
:{{text|say|Stanikos|Bye now!}}
