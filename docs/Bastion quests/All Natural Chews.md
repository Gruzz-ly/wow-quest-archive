==Objectives==
Collect 5 Cloudstrider Antlers from [[Gilded Cloudstrider]]s in the [[Golden Pasture]].
* [[Cloudstrider Antler]] (5)

==Description==
A huge part of [[larion]] care is providing for them and keeping them happy.

Larions need to keep their teeth sharp and healthy, and for that they need to chew. If you do not give them proper things to chew on, they can get destructive.

One of their favorite chew toys are the antlers from the [[cloudstrider]]s in the nearby field. Please, collect some antlers for the pride to enjoy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Antlers are great for keeping my pack's teeth sharp and clean.

==Completion==
The larions will be ecstatic to have more antlers to chew on!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Nemea|Due to the anima drought, the cloudstriders no longer shed their antlers... you will have to collect them off of their bodies. I implore you to not be wasteful, and to use as many parts of the cloudstriders as you can.}}
