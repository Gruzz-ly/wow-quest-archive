==Objectives==
Stand before a [[Soul Mirror (object)|Soul Mirror]] and witness memories from [[Lysonia]]'s past.
* First memory witnessed {{co|58.1|64.5|Bastion}}
* Second memory witnessed {{co|59.0|62.7|Bastion}}
* Third memory witnessed {{co|59.6|59.6|Bastion}}
* Final memory witnessed {{co|57.2|54.3|Bastion}}
*Speak to Mikanikos in the Vault of Memory.

==Description==
If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I do not know that I would believe such a thing is possible.

You carry a significant piece of Lysonia within you, now. Go to the Soul Mirrors and open yourself to them. With luck, they will draw from her essence to draw forth a memory of the [[Forsworn]].

If this works, we may know what they are planning within minutes!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|86|80}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Mikanikos fumes silently.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|I am inclined to eject you from the Locus, if you insist on meddling.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I am going to reprogram her if it is the LAST thing I do.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Go on ahead, <name>. I need to protect the Forgelite Prime.}}

Head south to the [[Walk of Recollection]], where a bonus objective starts: [[Hostile Recollection]] &ndash; Repel the Forsworn threat.

All hostile mobs in the area count for objective credit. Don't grind kills now. There will be plenty of time on the next few quests.

Interact with the first mirror:
:{{text|say|[[Devos|Shrouded Figure]]|Trust in the process, aspirant. All will become clear in time.}}
:{{text|say|[[Image of Lysonia]]|I feel more of myself slip away with every moment. How long ago did you endure this?}}
:{{text|say|Shrouded Figure|Long enough that I remember that there was pain, but not so recently that I feel it. This, too, shall pass.}}

Downhill to the northeast for the second mirror:
:{{text|say|Shrouded Figure|I tried to warn them. Such reckless insistence on the path at all costs... it will destroy us, in the end.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Lysonia|What would you have me do?}}
:{{text|say|Shrouded Figure|Follow me. Together, we will set the kyrian on a new path. Together, we will make right what the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]] has made so wrong.}}

Further northeast for the third mirror:
:{{text|say|Image of Lysonia|Hear me, Forsworn!}}
:{{text|say|Image of Lysonia|Too long have we given up the things that make us who we are. The things that gave us strength!}}
:{{text|say|Image of Lysonia|We will claim the [[Temple of Purity]] in our name, and we will destroy all who stand in our way.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|I think I know where to find another Soul Mirror. Head to the cavern to the north. We will meet you there.}}

In the [[Vault of Memory]], find the final mirror:
:{{text|say|Shrouded Figure|[[Uther]], deliver unto Bastion the reckoning that are the Forsworn.}}
:{{text|say|Shrouded Figure|Lysonia, there is more I must share--}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|Hm. I do not believe you are authorized to view this memory.}}
