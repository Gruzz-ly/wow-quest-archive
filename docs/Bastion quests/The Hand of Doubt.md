==Objectives==
Defeat [[Lysonia]], Hand of Doubt.
* Speak to [[Disciple Kosmas]] {{co|64.2|71.5|Bastion}}
* Defeat Lysonia {{co|64.5|71.2|Bastion}}
* Witness Lysonia's fate

==Description==
Quickly! We have no time to lose. Lysonia has weakened [[Eridia]] to the point that she may fall. Our Paragon will do what she can, but we must intervene.

We will challenge Lysonia, and perhaps buy Eridia more time. 

This so-called Hand of Doubt will make no easy foe. Stand ready, <name>.

|Skytone Quickblade

You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|63|40}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That you should join us now, on the precipice of this treachery, is curious.

<The Paragon of Purity studies you with a piercing gaze.>

You have done well. The [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]] will know of your contributions this day.

==Notes==
Speak with Kosmas again:
:Lysonia is weakened, but I am still not certain of you and I will be able to overcome her terrible strength.
:All the same, we must try. Are you with me?
:{{gossip|I will stand with you.}}

Lysonia is at 15% health. Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Lysonia|The Paragon must die! You will not interfere!}}

10%:
:{{text|say|Lysonia|Our realm lies in ruins. The Forsworn will set us free!}}

5%:
:{{text|yell|Lysonia|Maw take all of you!}}
:''The player and Kosmas are stunned by Lysonia's Touch of the Maw.''
:{{text|say|Lysonia|Now to finish this matter.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|That power... it cannot be!}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|You were foolish to test a Paragon's might.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|I will know your truth!}}
:{{text|yell|Lysonia|Your day will come. This is just the beginning!}}
:''Lysonia flies off, but a [[Fragment of Lysonia]] is left behind.''
:{{text|say|Eridia|What... what is that?}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|It is an echo of her deepest held memories. It will reveal the truth behind her treachery.}}

;Objective
:Rescue Lysonia from [[Vesiphone]], Paragon of Purity.
:* Confront [[Lysonia]]
:* Lysonia subdued

;Description:
:My Paragon, Vesiphone, is of a singular mind. Her purpose is to cleanse the [[kyrian]].
:I know, in the depths of my soul, that Lysonia cannot be cleansed of the malaise that holds her mind.
:She will die, if we do nothing.
:I am weak from our battle, but I will do what I can to stop the Paragon. You must intervene. You must find a way to save my [[Soulbind]].
:Please. You cannot possibly know how dear she is to me.
