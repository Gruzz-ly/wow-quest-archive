==Description==
Greetings, mortal!

Are you here to learn about the legacy of [[Agthia]], Paragon of Courage?

I welcome you to walk the grounds of this ancient battleground to learn of the battle that occurred here, and the heroic Paragon who saved all of [[Bastion]] and the [[Shadowlands]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Agthia did not only live a life of courage, but one of service to all of the Shadowlands.

==Completion==
It is an eternal tug of war between the [[magic|cosmic forces]] of existence.

They constantly vie for power over each other but if one fell, all worlds would fall into chaos.

==Notes==

;First scroll
:{{Text|say|[[Contemplative Student]]|Eons ago, the powers of the Void launched a massive attack against the Shadowlands, trying to shift the balance of the cosmos. The attack blindsided the kyrian, and embroiled all of Bastion into chaos.}}

;Second scroll
:{{Text|say|Contemplative Student|Across all of Bastion, centurions and kyrian alike launched into battle. Ascended fell from the sky as the powers of the Void overwhelmed them.}}

;Third scroll
:{{Text|say|Contemplative Student|The Paragon of Courage at the time, Agthia, took charge of the forces at this very site. Bastion was on the path to surely fall, but she would not let that happen.}}
