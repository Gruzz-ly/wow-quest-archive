==Objectives==
Witness memories of your past life.
* Commune with [[the Eternal Flame]]
* Relive acts of service (3)

==Description==
Curious. You are unlike any aspirant that has come before, that much is certain.

You will notice that we have an audience. It has been a long time indeed since we welcomed another to the path. We are all eager to see what deeds brought you to us.

Simply approach the dais before you and gaze into the flame. The Watcher will pull forth your memories of those you served in life, and you will be transported back to those moments to aid them once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Band of Chronicled Deeds]]
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Such a display is certain to raise our spirits.

==Completion==
I confess... I was hoping for a small spectacle to lift the spirits of the aspirants in my care.

I was not expecting to have my own lifted, as well. Thank you for that.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|When you are ready, approach the flame and follow the Watcher's instructions.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|This should prove exciting.}}

Approach the Eternal Watcher and the Eternal Flame:
:{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|Open your mind to me, mortal. We will see what memories reveal themselves.}}

Interact with the flame and the scene fades to black. Three events will happen at random, of any of the following:
*4x [[Living Wound]] (Azerite elementals):
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> bravely stood against the forces tearing their world asunder!}}
*5x [[Champion of the Alliance (Bastion)|Champion of the Alliance]] / [[Champion of the Horde (Bastion)|Champion of the Horde]] (one of):
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> served their people in a grand war that threatened the lives and homes of many.}}
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> served the noble <Horde/Alliance> in combat against the <Alliance/Horde>!}}
*3x [[Champion of the Zandalar]] / [[Champion of Kul Tiras]]:
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> lent their aid to the denizens of Kul Tiras/Zandalar in a bloody conflict.}}
*2x [[Eternal Jailor]]:
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> has faced the forces of the Maw itself!}}
*7x [[Endless Scourge]] ([[abomination]], [[geist]], [[ghoul]], [[skeletal hound]]):
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> did not falter in the face of swarms of undead that threatened to overtake their world!}}
*5x [[Iron Horde Assailant]]:
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> stood beside the draenei of Draenor to face the cruel industry of the Iron Horde!}}
*5x [[Legion Invader (Bastion)|Legion Invader]] ([[felhound]], [[felstalker]], [[imp]]):
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> gathered mighty allies to repel the Burning Legion!}}
*8x [[Legion Invader (Bastion)|Legion Invader]] ([[felhound]], [[felstalker]], [[imp]]):
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> traveled to another world to aid those who faced the Burning Legion!}}
*3x [[Servant of the Lich King]] (mounted death knight):
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<name> remained unbent in the face of the power of Death itself.}}
*1x [[Spawn of Deathwing]]:
**{{text|say|Eternal Watcher|<Name> stood steadfast against the machinations of twisted monsters, bent on destroying their world!}}

;Next vision
:{{Text|say|Eternal Watcher|Let your memories pour forth, <name>. Gaze into the flame once more.}}

After three waves, the scene fades to black once more:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Fascinating. To have seen so much, in so little time...}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Did I not tell you? This one bears promise.}}

It's possible the enemies aren't entirely random, but what categories you have the most achievement points in.
