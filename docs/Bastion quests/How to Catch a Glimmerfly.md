==Objectives==
Capture 5 [[Starving Glimmerfly|Starving Glimmerflies]] in the [[Shimmering Pools]], then return to [[Kowalskos]].
* Glimmerflies captured (5)
* [[Animyllis Bloom#How to Catch a Glimmerfly]] (provided)

==Description==
Yes! Proper tools collected. Now to catch [[Glimmerfly|glimmerflies]]!

[[Anima]] drought more severe in northern pools. Many [[Starving Glimmerfly|Starving Glimmerflies]], most eager to drink from our animyllis blooms.

Place blooms, then while glimmerflies are drinking attach to filaments! Then return to me.

You will also receive:

==Progress==
Glimmerflies will surely help me fly!

==Completion==
<Kowalskos gets very excited>

Wow! It worked! I hope they hold me up, too!
