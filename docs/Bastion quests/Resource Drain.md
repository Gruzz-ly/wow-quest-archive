==Objectives==
Drain anima from [[Gilded Cloudstrider]] 5 times.
* Cloudstrider [[anima]] drained (5)
* [[Anima Drainer]] (provided)

==Description==
Usually repairs easy. Anima everywhere!

Except drought means we can't just pull it from air. Other sources needed!

Take this. Drain anima from [[cloudstrider]]s. Not ideal, but desperate times.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Drought has big effects. Feel bad for cloudstriders.

==Completion==
This is enough to repair [[Gatamatos]], and then some!

==Notes==
