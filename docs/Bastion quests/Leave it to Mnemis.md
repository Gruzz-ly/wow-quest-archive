==Objectives==
Use the Transport Pad in the [[Vault of the Archon]].
* Use the [[Anima Gateway]] {{co|57.7|67.2|Bastion}}

==Description==
I have deduced by the urgency in your collective voices that you wish to leave.

I will expedite your exit. There is a transport pad in the antechamber. I will ensure that the chamber is sealed once again on your exit.

Please accompany me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|93|40}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We must hurry. The Archon must know what transpired here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Vault-Keeper Mnemis|Right this way.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|We must gain an audience with the Archon.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Easy to say. Not easy to do.}}

The group moves ''slowly'' up the ramp. No need to wait, just interact with the Transport Pad. However, should the players stick around:
:{{text|say|Vault-Keeper Mnemis|Hello, Locus-Keeper.}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|And greetings to you, Vault-Keeper.}}

The pad will send the player to a corresponding pad on the surface near the main road, west of the [[Mnemonic Locus]].

This concludes the "Chasing a Memory" chapter of the [[Bastion storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[Go in Service]].
