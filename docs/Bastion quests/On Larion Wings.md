==Objectives==
Mount Andira, then complete the flight course.
* [[Andira]] mounted
*Fly through the [[Flight Training Ring|rings]]

==Description==
As a flightless being, you will unfortunately never feel the joy of flying alongside your companion.

However... you could still fly with Andira.

It seems you have earned Andira's trust more than I've seen her with anybody else. Would you like to try a flight course?

Take wing with Andira, then fly through the rings. Don't stray off course or take too much time to get between rings or she will leave you behind!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pure Aspirant's Leggings
|Courageous Aspirant's Breeches
|Humble Aspirant's Leggings
|Judicious Aspirant's Legguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
I set up the flight course to train the larions to listen to aerial commands. They know where to go!

==Completion==
The feeling of soaring through the air, the gentle flap of your larion's wings...

Even though I have my own wings, there's no feeling quite like it.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{Text|Say|Nemea|I hope bonding with Andira softened you to my way of life. Larions are more than just companions. Never have I felt a bond with anybody else, kyrian or otherwise, that could be more rewarding than my relationships with my pride.}}

==Progression==
{{Pride or Unit}}
