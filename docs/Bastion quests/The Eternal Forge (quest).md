==Objectives==
Meet [[Mikanikos]] at the [[Eternal Forge]].

==Description==
The Forgelite Prime has taken up the mantle of building our new [[Crest of Ascension]].

No ordinary tools or materials will do. He will require [[:Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons]], Hammer of the First Forgelite. It sits at the shrine to the [[First Forgelite]] in the Eternal Forge.

The [[Forsworn]] have taken over this forge to create their own endless [[centurion]] army. You must meet Mikanikos at the forge, push back the Forsworn, and retrieve Phaestus for our own uses.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>! Can you believe what the Forsworn have done to my forge?

Must find Phaestus and halt their operation!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Come, <name>! Who knows how the Forsworn abuse my forge. They must not harm my sacred Phaestus too!}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Retrieving Phaestus is of utmost importance. Go with haste.}}

Head to the northern part of the zone - the nearest flight path is at [[Sagehaven]]. At the [[Eternal Forge]], [[Mikanikos]] and [[Sika]] are looking at an [[Unfinished Goliath]]:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Sika, I left you in charge! Where are my forgehands?}}
:{{text|say|Sika|The Forsworn overran us. Took them away! Could only save your goliath.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|We shall have words later. We must get the hammer back now.}}

==Progression==
{{Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons}}
