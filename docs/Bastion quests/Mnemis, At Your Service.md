==Objectives==
Locate two offerings within the [[Walk of Recollection]], then proceed to the [[Vault of the Archon]].
* Locate the [[Cache of the Paragons|first offering]] {{co|59.9|58.2|Bastion}}
* Obtain the [[Ceremonial Offering|first offering]]
* Locate the [[Cache of the Archons|second offering]] {{co|60.6|61.9|Bastion}}
* Obtain the [[Carved Kyrian Idol|second offering]]
*Speak to Locus-Keeper Mnemis at the Vault of the Archon.

==Description==
Greetings, I am [[Locus-Keeper Mnemis]] and I would be delighted to assist you.

I recall that you are trying to access a particular memory. Due to the contents, that memory can only be viewed within the Vault of the Archon.

In order to gain access to the Vault, you must collect offerings for the two guardians who watch over it. I have hidden these offerings from the [[Forsworn]], as they are not authorized to enter.

The [[Mikanikos|Forgelite Prime]] is the only one among you who can grant authorization. How convenient!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|86|80}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the offerings of which I spoke?

==Completion==
Your search was fruitful. I am delighted to see you remain intact.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Well? Are you going to tell us where to find the offerings?}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|I am forbidden from providing the locations of the required offerings. Only approximate directions.}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|For example: Head due south.}}

At the crosswalk:
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|You will find the first cache along this path. Good luck!}}

Mnemis will play hot-and-cold with the player:
*{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|You are moving in the correct direction.}}
*{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|You are very close to your destination.}}<!-- Got this several times, but not the other two. -->
*{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|You are heading away from your destination.}}

;Directions
*{{Text|say|[[Image of Locus-Keeper Mnemis]]|The cache you seek is not nearby. Please proceed in this direction to locate it.}}
*{{Text|say|Image of Locus-Keeper Mnemis|You will find what you seek if you continue along this path.}}

Head east, then bear just north of the platform where the third mirror was to head down to the river. Follow the river path to spot a small building:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Stop! I sense a ward nearby.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|The Forsworn abound. Be on your guard.}}

Defeat the spawned [[Forsworn Researcher]] to reveal a [[Cache of the Paragons]]. Loot the [[Ceremonial Offering]]:
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|You should now proceed to the south once more.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|She is being so pleasant about this.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I know. This is how Mnemis is INTENDED to behave.}}

Head south, cross the river, then take a left to reach another building.
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|There! Protect me, yes?}}

Keep the spawned mob off Mikanikos and loot the [[Carved Kyrian Idol]] from the [[Cache of the Archons]]:
:{{text|say|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|I will await you at the entrance to the Vault of the Archon. It is again south of your current location.}}
