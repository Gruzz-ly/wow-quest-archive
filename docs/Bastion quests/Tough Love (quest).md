{{questportrait|Kala.png|Kala|We need to be stern but gentle. Maybe her slobber ball will provide the proper distraction.}}
==Objectives==
Retrieve Korinna's Allaying Crook from Kala inside her den.
* [[Kala]] slain
* [[Korinna's Allaying Crook]]
*Return to Zosime near the entrance to the Garden of Respite.

==Description==
Heavens! Kala has flown off with Korinna's Allaying Crook!

I saw her fly into her den to the west. I must warn you, she can become very protective when she's in there. Please be careful but do not be afraid to give her some tough love. She is exceptionally resilient.

Here, take her slobber ball. It's her favorite and may help to distract her.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pure Aspirant's Gloves
|Courageous Aspirant's Gloves
|Humble Aspirant's Gauntlets
|Judicious Aspirant's Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|71|60|40}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Do you have the crook?

==Completion==
With the crook and Korinna's guidance, I can begin to bring this place and its creatures back to their former state of respite. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Go to [[Kala's Den]] in [[Bastion]]. Beat Kala to about 50%, using the Throw Slobber Ball extra button as a distraction. Kala will drop the crook and fly off.

;Description
Heavens! Kala has flown off with the staff!

I expect that she may have taken it to her den to the west. I must warn you, she can become very protective when she is in her den. Please be careful retrieving the staff.

Do not be afraid to give her some tough love. She is exceptionally resilient.

Oh, and take some of her toys. They may help distract her.

;Completion
With this I can begin to bring this place back to its former glory. Thank you, <name>.
