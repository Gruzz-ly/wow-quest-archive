==Objectives==
[[File:Ta Repository.jpg|thumb|[[Ta Repository]].]]
Retrieve the Prototype Aquilon.
*Export party found {{co|37.0|31.6|Bastion}}
*[[Prototype Aquilon]] subdued {{co|37.4|30.0|Bastion}}
*Prototype Aquilon returned

==Description==
[[Ta'nla the Identifier|Ta'nla]] requested something very... specific... on behalf of a client.

The [[kyrian]] have been working on a new type of [[centurion]] they call an [[aquilon]]. I sent some of our trade specialists to retrieve the prototype in question, but they have yet to return. 

Until I have the item, there is obviously no way I can ship it to Ta'nla. Perhaps we can help one another.

If you can locate the aquilon and bring it here, I will help you reach [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Have you acquired the... item?

==Completion==
Perfect! This will put us back on schedule.

==Notes==
Head southeast to the [[Ta Repository]] and enter it:
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|It seems we may have to use force. I am excited to see you in action.}}

The corpses of several [[Export Specialist]]s litter the ground... No matter, fight the [[Prototype Aquilon]], then hop on:
:{{text|yell|Al'dalil|It can fly!?}}
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|I acquired some blueprints from one of the smugglers. Let me see...}}

Players have access to three abilities in the vehicle interface:
#{{abilities|Press Button|Push a random button on the Aquilon.|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant|id=353088}}
#{{abilities|Pull Lever|Pull a random lever on the aquilon.|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant|id=353090}}
#{{abilities|Bonk Head|Give the head of the aquilon a good whack.|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant|id=353092}}

Follow the prompts:
;Buttons
*{{text|say|Al'dalil|Start pressing buttons!}}
*{{text|say|Al'dalil|Buttons! Quickly, the buttons!}}
;Lever
*{{text|say|Al'dalil|Pull on one of the levers!}}
*{{text|say|Al'dalil|Use the lever, Maw Walker!}}
;Bonk head
*{{text|say|Al'dalil|There are no operating instructions! Try hitting it!}}
*{{text|say|Al'dalil|A sharp strike to the head always works!}}
;Incorrect
*{{text|say|Al'dalil|That is not what I said!}}
*{{text|say|Al'dalil|Why did you do that?!}}

Eventually the aquilon will have had enough and will return to Ta'oku.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|Perhaps now would be a good time for me to mention that I may not be quite welcome in Tazavesh.}}
:{{text|say|Al'dalil|But fear not! I have a way I can travel beside you unrecognized. We will meet aboard the ferry.}}
