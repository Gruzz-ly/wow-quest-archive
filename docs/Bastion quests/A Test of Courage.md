==Objectives==
Help [[Zosime]] retrieve Korinna's Allaying Crook.
* [[Vesper of Remembrance|Bell of Remembrance]] rung (Optional)
* [[Korinna's Allaying Crook]]

==Description==
I'm still new and haven't passed all of my Aspirant tests. But, I have an idea.

There is an artifact called Korinna's Allaying Crook. [[Korinna]] was a powerful [[Ascended]] who tamed the creatures of [[Bastion]] eons ago. Her staff has the power to prevent more creatures from succumbing to a savage, [[anima]]-starved state.

However, the artifact is protected and only one with great courage can retrieve it. I bet you could, <name>.

Go on ahead. The staff is in the reliquary to the north. I'll join you there shortly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*  {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Were you able to retrieve the crook?

==Completion==
I told you she can be quite the troublemaker. Ugh, Kala!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Zosime|When you get in there, ring the vesper... the bell. Hopefully, Korinna will appear and tell us what next to do.}}
:{{Text|say|Zosime|You go ahead. I need to calm Kala down. Now she's too excited because she HAS her playthings.}}

Go north to [[Korinna's Reliquary]] and activate the [[Vesper of Remembrance]].

;Activating the vesper
:{{Text|say|Memory of Korinna|Courage calls. Ah, Zosime. You come to retrieve the crook.}}
:{{Text|say|Zosime|Ascended Korinna! I am glad you are here. What must we do?}}
:{{Text|say|Memory of Korinna|Channel all of your anima into the staff, child. This is a test of your courage and hope.}}
:{{Text|say|Zosime|Okay, I can do this, but it could attract many of the remaining anima-starved out there. Prepare yourself, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Memory of Korinna|When you find success within, I will return.}}

''Two [[Anima-Starved Wyrm]]s fly into the chamber''

''Once dealt with, they're followed by three [[Anima-Starved Cloudfeather]]s.''

''Finally [[Vyrm the Ravenous]] enters the reliquary.''

''As the barrier is brought low, [[Kala]] swoops in and grabs the crook, only to fly off.''
:{{Text|Say|Zosime|Kala! No! Drop it!}}
:{{Text|Say|Zosime|She must think it's her chewing stick!}}

==Progression==

*Name: '''Fetch the Staff'''.
;Description
If we are to remedy this situation I am going to need assistance.

There is an artifact held here which will prevent more creatures succumbing to this savage state.

My plan is to retrieve the artifact and restore peace to this small corner of [[Bastion]]. However, I will need your help.

Go on ahead, the artifact rests in a small cavern directly north of here. I'll join you shortly.

;Progress
Did you retrieve it?

;Notes
[[Chamber Incense Burner]] was there.
:{{Text|Say|Zosime|I am glad you are here. This barrier must be brought down, but I will have to channel enough [[anima]] to do so.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zosime|This could attract lots of attention from the local wildlife. Prepare yourself.}}
