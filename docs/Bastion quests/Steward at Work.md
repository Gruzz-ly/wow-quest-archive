Kalisthene has vouched for you by allowing usage of the beacon. For that reason, you have my attention.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|I have other duties to attend to. Your steward can repair the beacon at your request.}}

Use the zone ability to summon the selected steward:
:Hi! Can help? I can provide each service once a day. Will stay around for a bit too!
*{{gossip|(Quest) I need you to fix the Beacon of Invocation.}}
*{{gossip|Thank you. See you later!}}
:{{text|say|Steward|I'm on it!}}
:{{text|say|Steward|All done! Working good!}}

Interact with the beacon:
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|For what purpose do you light the beacon, aspirants?}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Polemarch. We have urgent news for the Archon.}}
