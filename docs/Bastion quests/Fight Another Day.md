==Objectives==
Save 6 captured [[kyrian]].
* [[Disciple of Courage|Ascended]] freed (6)

==Description==
Some of our brethren are still alive in there!

While many were lost in the initial assault, they seem keen on taking any survivors [[prisoner]]. I know not what they intend, but given their mastery of corpses we must assume the worst.

Some have already been taken to their necropolis above, but others remain in [[cage]]s on the ground. Free all you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ascended Defender's Crest]]
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The kyrian leave none behind on the field of battle.

==Completion==
You are a true ally, outsider. Thank you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Disciple Apolon|Save every kyrian that you can!}}

The kyrian are all in bonewrought cages.

==Progression==
