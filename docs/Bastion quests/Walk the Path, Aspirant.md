==Objectives==
Travel with Kleia.
* Travel with [[Kleia]] {{co|46.3|79.0|Bastion}}
* See [[Bastion]] through Kleia's eyes {{co|46.3|79.0|Bastion}}
* Travel to [[Aspirant's Rest]] {{co|48.2|72.6|Bastion}}

==Description==
If you wish to stand before the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]], there is a path you must walk. Thankfully, it is well worn and serviceable even in these dire times.

Though you are not destined to become [[kyrian]], our ways may be of interest to you. Learn well, learn fast, and perhaps the Archon will take notice and grant you this audience you seek.

Aspirant Kleia will show you the way. Archon's eyes upon you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|36|35}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Your journey is just beginning, <name>. I hope you can help us, and I hope we can help you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|You know the path better than most, aspirant. Archon's eyes upon you.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Follow the path. As if we have--we should be on our way.}}

On the way:
:{{text|say|Kleia|I had nearly passed my final trial when the drought began. None have ascended since.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Our realm must appear pristine to you. Words cannot express what was lost.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Wait... let me show you.}}

On the ground near Kleia is a blue circle. Standing in it will grant the player a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Kleia's Perspective|See Bastion through Kleia's eyes.|icon=ability_bastion_druid|id=331259}}

Use the ability, and Kleia shows a memory. Countless dead walk the path to Aspirant's Rest and anima flows through the skies like rivers.
:{{text|say|Kleia|We are in the midst of an unspeakable tragedy, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Come. We will seek out my [[Soulbind]], [[Pelagos]], at Aspirant's Rest.}}

Keep heading north to [[Aspirant's Rest]]. Don't forget to pick up the flight path on the way.
:{{text|say|Kleia|We have arrived. Pelagos will be eager to meet you.}}
:{{text|say|[[Aspirant Defender]]|Kleia! Thank the Archon... Pelagos began the ritual without you!}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|What?! That fool... we have little time!}}

==Progression==

;Description
[[Kalisthene]] is a devoted caretaker to the aspirants. Times have been hard of late. I imagine it wears on her.

I think I know how to earn an audience with the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]]. It will require that you learn our ways, and achieve some things that would ordinarily take years. I am hopeful that we can expedite the process together.

First we must find my Soulbind, [[Pelagos]]. I last saw them at Aspirant's Rest to the east. We will journey there together.
