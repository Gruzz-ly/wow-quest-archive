==Objectives==
Confront [[Lysonia]] and cleanse the great Vespers.
* Follow [[Eridia]] {{co|63.7|72.2|Bastion}}
* Speak to [[Disciple Kosmas|Kosmas]] {{co|63.5|72.1|Bastion}}
* [[Purity Vesper|Vespers]] cleansed (3)
*Speak to Disciple Kosmas atop Purity's Pinnacle.

==Description==
My heart is filled with dread. If it truly is Lysonia who leads them now...

No. What is important is that we restore the great vespers. So long as their mighty voices are corrupted, all who hear them will suffer as this temple does. It is only a matter of time before all of [[Bastion]] succumbs.

They will no doubt try to stop you. I will hold their leader's attention as long as I can.

If I do not survive... my disciple will see you safely from this place. Go in service.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Our fight is not yet over, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eridia|Stand aside! I would have words with your leader.}}
:{{text|say|[[Forsworn Herald]]|We will allow you to pass unharmed. For now.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|Kleia! Take the others to safety. Go!}}

Follow Eridia up to [[Purity's Pinnacle]], where she faces down [[Lysonia]]:
:{{text|say|Eridia|I would know you anywhere, Hand of Loyalty.}}
:{{text|say|Lysonia|We have taken your temple. Your Paragon will soon meet her end.}}
:{{text|say|Lysonia|Join me, and we may fly together once more.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|Never.}}
:{{text|say|Lysonia|So be it. The Forsworn will prevail.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|<Name>, to me.}}

Dismount, then speak with Kosmas:
:We need to act swiftly, if we are to intervene.
:Are you ready to fly?
{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|I have an idea. Hold on, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|We are outnumbered. The vespers' corrupted voices empower them.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|I cannot fight them all, but perhaps we can restore the vespers while they are preoccupied.}}

Kosmas grabs the player and flies to the vespers floating high above.
:{{text|say|Lysonia|I do not wish to kill you, my Soulbind, but I will if I must.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|Why are you doing this?}}
:{{text|say|Lysonia|You know why. You need only accept the truth that lies before you.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|I will keep the Forsworn at bay. Use my hammer to purify the bells! Let their mighty voices ring true once more!}}

Use the vehicle ability Hurl Kyrian Hammer on the southeast vesper:
:{{text|say|Eridia|What truth could possibly justify this slaughter?}}
:{{text|say|Lysonia|We all suffered a thousand little deaths at the hands of your temple, Eridia.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|The process of purification is not meant to be easy. But we are better for it. You were better for it.}}

Use the ability again on the northwest vesper:
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|Only one left. Stay focused.}}
:{{text|say|Lysonia|And yet I cannot remember my past life. My family!}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|We must forget in order to ferry souls without judgment. You know this!}}
:{{text|say|Lysonia|The path is broken, yet you follow it blindly. I will force your eyes open!}}

Use the ability on the central vesper:
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|You can yet be saved, Lysonia. Let this end.}}
:{{text|say|Lysonia|We are not finished!}}
:''Versiphone channels a spell into Lysonia, then the two disappear.''
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|Hold on.}}
:{{text|say|Lysonia|Try to save her all you like. She has seen the truth!}}
:''Kosmas lands atop Purity's Pinnacle.''

;Description
I have my suspicions about the leader of the [[Forsworn]]. If it is who I suspect...

I must confront her. You and my disciple will be responsible for cleansing the bells. I will keep her might focused upon me while you do so.
