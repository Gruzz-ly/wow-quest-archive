==Objectives==
Confront Amarth the Harvester with Thanikos.
* Speak to [[Thanikos]]
* [[Amarth]] confronted {{co|34.2|55.2|Bastion}}
* Escape the [[Necrotic Wake]] {{co|34.6|55.1|Bastion}}

==Description==
I know not what awaits us across the chasm, outsider. By the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]]'s grace I hope that my Paragon yet lives, but I fear the worst.

We will face this great unknown together, as we have the rest of [[Maldraxxus]]'s horrors. To be [[kyrian]] is to follow the path, no matter how dire the circumstances.

Whatever happens, know that you have earned my undying respect this day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|48|20|40}}
* 8,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thanikos... is gone... isn't he.

==Notes==
Speak with Thanikos again:
:He will not escape.
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|The Paragon of Courage was at the heart of the temple when the attack came.}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|If she yet draws breath, we must lend her our aid.}}
:''A scene starts.''
:{{text|say|Xandria|You cannot win this battle, necromancer! Our courage never falters!}}
:{{text|say|Amarth|It will take more than courage to save you now.}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|My paragon, you do not stand alone!}}
:{{text|say|Amarth|Ah, just the vessel I require.}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|For the Archon! For Bastion!}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|What... are you... doing to me?!}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|No! No! NO!}}
:{{text|say|Xandria|Thanikos!}}
:{{text|say|Amarth|I have perfected you. Now serve me by destroying our enemies!}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Y-yes... master...}}

Run forward and start fighting Thanikos alongside Xandria:
:{{text|say|Thanikos Spinerender|I must... obey...}}
:{{text|say|Xandria|Monster! What has driven you to this madness?!}}
:{{text|say|Amarth|You kyrian are complicit in a broken cycle. Bastion is a waste of anima. We shall seize it all.}}
:{{text|say|Xandria|Not while I stand against you.}}
:{{text|say|Amarth|Then you will be the next to fall.}}

Defeat Thanikos:
:{{text|say|Thanikos Spinerender|My paragon... I... failed you...}}
:{{text|say|Xandria|You will suffer for this, necromancer!}}
:{{text|say|Amarth|Come then, if you dare.}}
:{{text|say|Nalthor the Rimebinder|Rain death upon them! Ensure they do not interfere.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Apolon|Outsider, we need to get out of here!}}

[[Disciple Apolon]] and [[Disciple Artemede]] show up. Talk with Apolon to escape back to Xandria's Vigil:
:{{text|say|Disciple Artemede|The paragon can stand on her own until you gather reinforcements.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Apolon|Artemede will report to the Archon. We must return to Oribos and inform them of Maldraxxus's treachery!}}

This completes the "The Temple of Courage" chapter of the [[Bastion storyline]]. The [[Maldraxxus storyline]] begins with [[Follow the Path]]. Additionally, [[Disciple Artemede]] begins the [[Necrotic Wake]] breadcrumb quest: [[Necrotic Wake: A Paragon's Plight]].
