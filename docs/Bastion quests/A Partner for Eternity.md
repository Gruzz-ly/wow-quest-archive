==Objectives==
Help Mikanikos finish his finest creation.
* Speak with [[Mikanikos]]
* Reinforced armor applied (4)
* Mikanikos supported

==Description==
Before returning to [[Elysian Hold|the Hold]], one more thing to do.

Defeat the [[Forsworn]] and their [[centurion]] army!

This goliath here can help with just that. My finest creation yet!

I need an extra pair of hands. Yours will do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Progress==
Trust he is no ordinary goliath. An extension of my hand itself!

==Completion==
A partner that embodies my inner strength.

A worthy centurion indeed!

==Notes==
Speak with Mikanikos again:
:I understand what the Forsworn do not.
:Perfection is necessary for success! You must take care of your tools and resources.
:{{gossip|I am ready to aid you.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I built this goliath with a special core. Now with Phaestus, I can bind my soul to him!}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Sika, keep watch. <Name>, apply the reinforced armor!}}
:{{text|say|Sika|Yes, Forgelite!}}

The [[Reinforced Gauntlet]]s, [[Reinforced Neckplate|Neckplate]], and [[Reinforced Breastplate|Breastplate]] light up around the Unfinished Goliath. Interact with them all.
:{{text|say|Sika|Too much! Mikanikos, you hurt yourself!}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Need... more... anima! <Name>, help me!}}

Interact with Mikanikos to infuse him with some anima.
:{{text|say|Unfinished Goliath|I awaken.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I feel his power within me! I name him... Bron.}}

On complete, a cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Magnificent. Bron's strength is my strength. Our strength!}}
:''The earth shakes.''
:{{text|say|Sika|What was that?}}
:''Lysonia flies in.''
:{{text|say|Lysonia|Centurions! Advance! Destroy the intruders!}}
:{{text|say|Sika|Centurions will overwhelm us!}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Not to worry! I know what to do.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Everyone, hop on!}}
