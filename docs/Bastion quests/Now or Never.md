==Objectives==
Reclaim Xandria's Vigil.
* Speak to [[Thanikos]] {{co|41.8|55.2|Bastion}}
* [[Xandria's Vigil]] reclaimed
*Speak with Thanikos in Xandria's Vigil.

==Description==
In a fair fight our [[warrior]]s could stand against countless swarms of these [[Maldraxxus|Maldraxxi]].

This was no fair fight, outsider.

They came without warning. Without cause. We were caught unprepared.

They must not be allowed to encroach any further. This stops here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We will not go down without a fight.

==Completion==
We have bought a staging ground, but much remains to be done.

==Notes==
Speak with Thanikos again:
:The day is not lost yet.
:{{gossip|I am with you.}}

:{{text|say|Thanikos|You betray your ancient oath to Maldraxxus, lich! Justice will be done!}}
:{{text|say|Nalthor the Rimebinder|I betray nothing. My master bids that Bastion be destroyed and the kyrian corpses harvested for our armies.}}
:{{text|say|Nalthor the Rimebinder|You and your kin shall be the first. But not the last.}}
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Sacrilege! Mortal, push forward and secure the temple!}}

Kill everything that moves, but let the NPCs tank. Eligible mobs are [[Skeletal Vanguard]]s, [[Putrid Shambler]]s, [[Necromancer Warcaster]]s, and [[Rot Flinger]]s.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Friends! I bring aid!}}

==Progression==
{{The Temple of Courage}}
