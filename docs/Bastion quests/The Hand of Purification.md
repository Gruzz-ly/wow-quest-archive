==Objectives==
"Cleanse" the [[Temple of Purity]] by slaying enemies.
* Temple "cleansed" (0/100%)

==Description==
[[Nikolon]] was not alone.

<[[Eridia]] stares grimly out over the temple grounds.>

Long have I toiled over the aspirants in my care. Long have I tended to this temple under my Paragon. To know that so many have fallen, alone, is a blow.

But this... wanton destruction! It will not stand.

You will be my hand, <name>. Go forth. End them. All of them.

My duty demands that I tend to those that remain. I will find you near the bridge when the way is clear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
By the Archon's will, the temple will be reclaimed.

==Completion==
Some stains must be scoured away.

==Notes==
Eridia's gossip before accepting the quest:
{{Dialogue|
All those vulnerable aspirants... all the ascended we sent to the Temple of Loyalty... is this what became of them? They must have been driven mad, to attack this temple! We are not their enemy! We were only...

<Eridia falls silent as she stares out over the temple. A single tear drips down her cheek.>

Pick up both quests, then head out, killing a path north. Don't make a beeline north, as due west of Eridia is [[Acolyte Galistos]], who offers an optional side quest: [[An Inspired Moral Inventory]].

Up near the [[Vesper of Purity]], be on the lookout for a [[:Dark Sermon]] scroll, which starts [[Dangerous Discourse]], a mandatory quest in the campaign.

The following actions will fill the progress bar:
* [[Terrified Steward]] rescued (5%)
* [[Forsworn Ascended]] slain (5%)
* [[Rising Despair]] slain (4%)
* [[Forsworn Acolyte]] slain (3%)
* [[Forsworn Recruit]] slain (2%)
* [[Congealed Anger]]/Bitterness/Doubt/Loneliness/Loss/Pain/Sorrow/Worry slain (3%)

Stewards:
*{{text|say|Terrified Steward|Why they hurt friends?!}}
*{{text|say|Terrified Steward|Help! Scary!}}
*{{text|say|Terrified Steward|You! Yes! Good!}}
*{{text|say|Terrified Steward|You strong. Please protect?}}
*{{text|say|Terrified Steward|Good now. Bye!}}
*{{text|say|Terrified Steward|Thank you! Thank you much!}}
*{{text|say|Terrified Steward|Friend! Help please!}}
*{{text|say|Terrified Steward|Waaahhhh! Help!}}
*{{text|say|Terrified Steward|Yay! Help is here!}}
