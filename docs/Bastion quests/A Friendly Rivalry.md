==Objectives==
Meet with [[Pelodis]] at [[Forgefire Outpost]] or [[Nemea]] at [[Nemea's Retreat]].

==Description==
Ah, a fresh soul! Your perspective may prove useful to us.

Nemea and I have opposing viewpoints. She lauds her [[larion]], creatures native to [[Bastion]] whom she raises and trains as her companions.

However, I find that [[phalynx]] are the superior beings. They are efficient, obedient, and easy to work with.

Please, come learn both of our ways. Perhaps you can decide which of our ways of life is superior.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|38|70}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am honored that you came to me first. Allow me to show you my ways.

==Notes==
Pasing through the area for [[Go in Service]], [[Nemea]] and [[Pelodis]] are having a conversation:
:{{text|say|Nemea|Your ways lack finesse, Pelodis. Your phalynx do whatever you command. There's no cultivation, no give and take.}}
:{{text|say|Pelodis|And yours lack efficiency, Nemea! You spend your days building relationships, while I spend mine taking action and making a difference!}}

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Pelodis|I look forward to your input, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Nemea|As do I. Come, Lentios.}}
