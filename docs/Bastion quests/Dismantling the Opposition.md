==Objectives==
Ride Bron, then defeat 30 Forsworn forces and dismantle 2 Colossus in the [[Eternal Forge]].
* [[Bron (goliath)|Bron]] mounted {{co|50.0|20.5|Bastion}}
* [[Forsworn]] forces slain (30)
* [[Forsworn Colossus]] slain (2)

==Description==
The Forsworn mobilize!

We cannot allow them to march.

Attune to Bron, share your power with him.

Between the three of us, we shall destroy this new [[centurion]] army!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Bron was not meant as a tool of destruction, but will excel at it with you!

==Completion==
Exhilarating! Bron grows stronger with your power.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Lend Bron your power! Your bond will strengthen him.}}

Hop on Bron:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Good opportunity to measure combat prowess. Onward!}}

In the vehicle interface, players have three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Strongarm Punch|Bron punches the enemies in front of him, dealing Physical damage.|range=10|cd=1.5 sec|id=313795|icon=inv_glove_plate_bastion_d_01|notes=Instant}}
#{{Abilities|Crackdown|Bron smashes the ground in front of him, dealing Physical damage to all enemies in a cone.|range=25|cd=10 sec|id=313790|icon=spell_shaman_thunderstorm|notes=2 sec cast}}
#{{Abilities|Toss Stewards|Bron tosses Mikanikos's forgehands at the targeted Forsworn Colossus to dismantle it.|range=40|cd=10 sec|id=313757|icon=ability_eyeoftheowl|notes=1 sec cast}}

The '''Crackdown''' ability is the skill of choice. Though the spell description says "cone", it's more of a 10-yard wide line in front of the caster. It does enough damage to one-shot most enemies. 

Forsworn forces include: [[Converted Clawguard]]s, [[Forsworn Punisher]]s, [[Forsworn Overseer]]s, [[Praetorian Artificer]]s, and [[Darksworn Forgehand]]s.

Get within range of a colossus:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Take down that colossus!}}

Toss Stewards off cooldown:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Forgehands ready for launch!}}

Objective complete:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Forsworn thoroughly routed! Let us return.}}
:''Bron teleports back to the quest start area.''
