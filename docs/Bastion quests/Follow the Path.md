==Objectives==
Inform Tal-Inara in Oribos of Maldraxxus's attack on [[Bastion]].
*[[Navarros|Fly]] to [[Oribos]] (Optional)
*Inform [[Tal-Inara]] of [[Maldraxxus]]'s attack
*Speak to Tal-Inara in Oribos.

==Description==
[[Maldraxxus]] must answer for their crimes against [[Bastion]]. There shall be justice!

Let us go to Oribos and speak with the Tal-Inara, the Honored Voice. We will tell her what has transpired this day. Tell her that the kyrian will not stand idle against this aggression.

[[Disciple Artemede|Artemede]] will inform the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]]. My brothers and sisters will surely prepare for war.

That must not come to pass.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|41|}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You looked troubled, outsider. What ails your mortal frame?

==Completion==
I know why you have come. This kyrian has explained much.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Disciple Apolon|We must travel to Oribos at once.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Apolon|My people will surely prepare our armies for retaliation once Artemede delivers word.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Apolon|I will meet you there. Stay safe.}}

Get back to [[Oribos]] by any means and return to the [[Enclave]]. Speak with Tal-Inara:
:Your Purpose and ours are entwined it seems.
:{{gossip|Maldraxxus has attacked Bastion.}}

:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|This is most dire news. We must not let war ravage this plane and unravel all that we have done.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|The Necrolords are masters of warfare, it is true, but they have always used their power to defend the Shadowlands. Not attack it.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Mortal, you must learn their motives for striking at the kyrian. Do whatever it takes to stop this conflict before it escalates further.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Without the might of Maldraxxus on our side, I fear we have little hope of stopping the Banished One.}}
