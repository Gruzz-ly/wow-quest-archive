==Objectives==
Collect anima from nearby centurions.
*Pick up an [[Anima Canister]] {{co|42.5|78.4|Bastion}}
*[[Anima]] recovered (0/100%)

==Description==
Ah yes, [[Greeter Mnemis|the Greeter]].

It seems this Mnemis unit has been deactivated. Anima has been so scarce of late, and with no new souls entering our gates... I suppose it was a prudent measure. Anima is our most precious resource, after all.

There are some [[centurion]]s nearby. A portion of their anima could serve our needs.

Ah! One of our most helpful [[steward]]s is here to lend her aid. She will guide you in the collection effort.

Return when you have sufficient anima and we will power the Greeter once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|81|70}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The centurion is unresponsive.>

==Completion==
<The centurion emits a soft chime.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Sika, can we spare any anima for the Greeter?}}
:{{text|say|Sika|Yes! Take my barrel. Centurions will share!}}

Gossip from Kleia:
{{book|content=
﻿You should be able to claim some anima from these centurions. There is precious little to go around, but I believe we can make do with what we have.
}}

Gossip from Sika:
{{book|content=
Master Mikanikos, Forgelite Prime, asked Sika to tend to centurions. With little anima, we choose who gets some! Now you here! Anima needed for Greeter!

Good thing Sika made centurions share!
}}

Pick up the [[Anima Canister]] next to [[Sika]]:
:{{text|say|Sika|Hold tight now! No anima must fall!}}

The [[Centurion Colossus]] is worth 50% of the bar:
:{{text|say|Kyrian Steward|Big ones have soooo much anima! This one... almost empty, though.}}

The full-health [[Centurion Goliath]] is worth 30%:
:{{text|say|Depleted Goliath|My anima... for Bastion...}}
:{{text|say|Kyrian Steward|Thank you, friend.}}

The near-dead goliath is worth 20%:
:{{text|say|Kyrian Steward|No worry. He come back, when anima returns.}}

After gathering enough:
:{{text|say|Sika|Have enough! We wake Greeter now.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Greeter Mnemis|Anima reserves now nominal. Initializing.}}

==Progression==
{{Eternity's Call}}

;Description
Right, the Greeter.

It seems it was turned off. Anima has been so scarce of late, and so few have come to our gates... I suppose it makes sense.

There are some [[Centurion]]s nearby that could be put to other uses.

Ah! And one of our most helpful [[steward]]s is also here to lend her aid. She will guide you on the collection effort.
