==Objectives==
Activate the [[Portal|gateway]] to [[Maldraxxus]].
* [[Gate to Maldraxxus|Maldraxxus Gateway]] opened {{co|59.7|36.4|Oribos}}

==Description==
It is imperative that you identify the cause of the attack on [[Bastion]].

We will require your aid to open the gateway. Once the focus is sufficiently powered, we will call upon the gate to Maldraxxus and direct it into position.

From there, the fate of this war must rest upon your shoulders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[The Path to Ascension]]
* {{cost|12|5|10}}
* 3,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Time is precious, now more than ever.

==Completion==
The way is open. The eternal battlefields of Maldraxxus await you.

==Notes==
The [[Ancient Focus]] appears between [[Overseer Kah-Sher]] and [[Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi]] on accept. Interact with it:

This concludes the final chapter of the [[Bastion storyline]], awarding the [[The Path to Ascension]] achievement. The [[Maldraxxus storyline]] begins with [[If You Want Peace...]]
