==Objectives==
Assist [[Mikanikos]] by gathering potentially perfect parts so he can finish his construction and attend the [[Ember Court]].
* [[Potentially Perfect Part]] (150)

==Description==
Ember Court sounds interesting ... but very busy right now! [[Forsworn]] got into my supplies. Now everything jumbled and disorganized. Can't work in these conditions. My workshop isn't right!

Help me! Get parts. Most will be damaged and you don't know how to tell about flaws. Bring me many to examine. I will find perfect part.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Mikanikos]]
