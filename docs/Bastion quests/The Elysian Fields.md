==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kalisthene]] at <[[Hero's Rest]]/[[Elysian Hold]]> in [[Bastion]].

==Description==
You must travel to Bastion, eternal home of the winged [[kyrian]].

Do not be fooled by their golden fields and shining spires--the kyrian have been weakened by the great [[anima]] drought, and face the brink of civil war against their own fallen brethren.

They will benefit greatly from your aid. Seek one known as Kalisthene in <the crossroads called Hero's Rest/your new sanctum, Elysian Hold>. She will direct you further.

[[Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi]] in the [[Ring of Transference]] above can provide transport.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Why have you come to our realm, mortal?

==Progression==
{{The Threads of Fate}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
