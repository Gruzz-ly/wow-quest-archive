==Objectives==
Slay [[Etherwyrm]]s to collect 25 Glowing Viscera.
* [[Glowing Viscera]] (25)

==Description==
Forge is cold, yes? Need LOTS of [[anima]] to light.

<Sika references her scroll.>

Times before now, anima is everywhere, yes? Now it hides. Small bits, weird places.

We know that etherwyrms -- flappy scale-things that are blue -- eat anima. They are not dead, so they are finding anima to eat still, yes?

Maybe if we take what they have eaten, we can use it to light the forge. This will probably kill them.

Sad, yes. But! We will not take too much. Just a little.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|63|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find anima? Small pieces, even?

==Completion==
<Sika pokes the squishy substance.>

It glows. This means anima. Forgelite will be pleased.

==Notes==
Pick up all three quests, then head northwest.

[[Adrima's Lily]], [[Languishing Etherwyrm]]s, and [[Starved Etherwyrm]]s are found northwest of [[Aspirant's Crucible]], just past the [[Anima Extractor]].

;Description
I have much to teach you, but first I must ask a favor.

In times past, there was ample [[anima]] to power our forges. Ever since the skies emptied of it, we have struggled to find alternative sources.

It so happens that the gut of an etherwyrm is a natural font of anima.

These creatures once dined exclusively on the now-defunct flows above us. They have descended in great enough numbers that we may harvest them for our purposes.

Bring me the contents of their guts so we may refine it.
