==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Quartermaster Taelica.jpg|Quartermaster Taelica|He has the insignia you need to complete your disguise.}}
Collect 3 Forsworn Uniform Pieces and a Quartermaster's Insignia from within [[Kalliope's Rest]].
* [[Forsworn Uniform Piece]] (3)
* [[Quartermaster's Insignia]]

==Description==
The [[Forsworn]] have taken control of Kalliope's Rest and are looting its antiquities. They must be looking for the [[:Spear of Kalliope]], a relic of great power.

Their numbers are far too great and we are no match. Perhaps there is another way?

A small group of aspirants is removing artifacts from the shrine. If you gather uniform pieces and an insignia from them, we can get you inside the shrine unnoticed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|61|}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Do you have everything we need to make a disguise?

==Completion==
What did you do to this armor? You are a savage, yet effective, fighter it seems.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Haetio|You... you there. You look like a hero to me. Come here, friend.}}
