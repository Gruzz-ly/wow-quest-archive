==Objectives==
Kill 5 Cloudfeather Greatwing in [[Greatwing Roost]].
* [[Cloudfeather Greatwing]] slain (5)
* [[Nemea's Javelin]] (provided)

==Description==
Say what you want about [[phalynx]], but [[Larion]] will always have one major advantage.

Wings!

A bonded larion will hunt alongside you whether you are on the ground or in the air.

Take my javelin and [[Andira]] then go out into the fields to hunt the [[cloudfeather]]s there. You'll feel the boon of larion companionship firsthand!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
In my opinion, there is no better hunting partner than a larion.

Not even another [[kyrian]]!

==Completion==
It is such a satisfying experience to see your larion take wing to help take down your prey.

==Progression==
{{Pride or Unit}}
