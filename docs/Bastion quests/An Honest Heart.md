==Objectives==
Travel to [[Agthia's Repose]] in [[Bastion]].

==Description==
If we are to defeat [[Vorath]], we need to amplify the power of the ranseur. But we will not cut corners or impose our will to do it. That lesson has been learned.

However, the [[kyrian]] of Bastion are masters of ushering [[soul]]s to their proper places. Perhaps they would lend a fragment of their power to our cause.

Go to Bastion, and find a way to empower the ranseur.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
I suppose if one happened to die, this wouldn't be such a bad place to end up.

This kyrian says he will help us.

==Notes==
