==Objectives==
Slay 3 Forsworn ascended.
* [[Forsworn Ascended]] slain (3)

==Description==
<Name>! You are well! I am glad of it.

Many of the [[ascended]] who once served this place have betrayed us. To turn so wholly against all that the [[kyrian]] stand for is... unimaginable.

<The acolyte places a heavy spear in your hands.>

This is a tool that has seen little use before today. Its sole purpose is to inspire a moment of reflection in those it touches. It will show them the error of their ways.

If they remain unrepentant, then there is no hope for them. They must die.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|58|83}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
They betrayed us.

==Completion==
I saw them perish. It is more than they deserved.

==Notes==
This is an optional side quest available while on [[The Hand of Purification]] and [[A Once Sweet Sound]].

:{{text|say|Acolyte Galistos|We will find Eridia. Stay safe, and go in service.}}
