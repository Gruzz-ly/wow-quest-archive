==Objectives==
Fly with Vesiphone to [[Purity's Reflection]].
* Fly with [[Vesiphone]]

==Description==
Do you feel it, <name>?

That cold hand that grips your throat? That chill settled in the pit of your stomach? That is the touch of the [[Maw]], as certain as the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]]'s will.

I do not know how [[Lysonia]] came to possess this power, but we must act quickly.

I will inform the Archon of what transpired here. You will act where my Hand could not. I will explain as we fly.

Speak to me when you are prepared to leave the temple.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We will see not a moment's rest today, will we?

<Kleia eyes the fragment warily.>

==Notes==
Speak with Vesiphone:
:I can carry you from this place, if that is your wish. We are in need of some haste.
:{{gossip|I will fly with you.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|My Hand, you must stay here until you have recovered. I will return for you.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|Yes, my Paragon.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|Lysonia's essence has been twisted by the Maw. We must learn how this came to pass.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|Bring this fragment to the Mnemonic Locus, where we collect the memories of all kyrian.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|If fate is kind, Lysonia's memories will lead us to the answers we seek.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|I will inform the Archon of what transpired here... and seek restitution for those we lost.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Archon be praised... <name> is whole!}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|Kleia, accompany this one to the archives. I must fly to Elysian Hold.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|My disciples are needed here, and I must inform the Archon at once. Go in service, and swiftly at that!}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|It will be done, Paragon.}}
