==Objectives==
Take the portal at the [[Night Market]] and speak with [[Bounty Hunter Ta'oku|Ta'oku]].
*Portal to Transfer Station Ta taken {{co|51.0|81.9|Revendreth}}

==Description==
[[File:Bounty Hunter Ta'oku.png|thumb|upright|[[Bounty Hunter Ta'oku]]]]
While I indeed know the location of [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|the Veiled Market]], I fear I can do little in terms of providing you with transportation to it.

In return for your assistance with a task, I can send you to someone who can assist us both. There is a bounty hunter at [[Transfer Station Ta]], a [[broker]] enclave in [[Bastion]]. He is better suited to help you... and he owes me a shipment.

Meet with Ta'oku and tell him that [[Ta'nla the Identifier|Ta'nla]] sent you.

For your convenience, I can offer use of a portal. After all, we are partners, yes?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
Need something hunted down?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ta'nla the Identifier|Your help is most appreciated. I am quite overwhelmed at the moment, as you can see.}}

Take the portal just to the north to make it to [[Transfer Station Ta]] in [[Bastion]].
