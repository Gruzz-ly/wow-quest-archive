{{questportrait|Athanos.jpg|Athanos|The Goliaths of Bastion are a heartier, stronger variety of centurion. This one is designed to be a substantial challenge for any looking to hone their skills.}}
==Objectives==
Challenge Athanos.
* [[Athanos]] challenged {{co|51.3|80.5|Bastion}}

==Description==
It is clear to all that you are indeed a skilled combatant.

There is one challenge here that continues to test even the strongest among us. I would have you attempt to best a well-known [[centurion]], beloved by all aspirants. It is called Athanos.

Consider this a test of your spirit.

If you can withstand this trial, then I will deem you ready for what lies ahead.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Sparring Trainer's Handwraps

|Sparring Trainer's Gloves

}}

You will also receive:

* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Kleia watches you impassively.>

==Completion==
This is always a painful lesson. We do not think less of you for it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Hold back nothing, mortal.}}
[[Athanos]], the overtuned sparring assistant, stands ready in the center of the arena. Normally friendly and unattackable, only players on this quest will be able to damage this boss-level mob with nearly 300 times as much health as the normal aspirants in the area. Should be straightforward enough, right?

Start the fight:
:{{text|say|Athanos|Initiating humility sequence.}}

Humility? That's not what this about, right?

As far as abilities go, Athanos has a standard frontal cone punch ('''Power Swing'''), and a telegraphed circular area of effect attack ('''Smash'''). Nothing too unusual so far. Except for the instant-cast 300% of max-health ability it casts out of nowhere. Oops:
*{{Abilities|Anima Overwhelming|A focused bolt of anima meant to challenge even the heartiest of foes.|id=309908|icon=ability_druid_cresentburn|notes=Instant. Unlimited range. Does 300% of the player's max health in damage. Pierces immunity effects.}}

When Athanos wins, it gloats from a selection of:
*{{text|say|Athanos|You have been weighed. You have been measured.}}
*{{text|say|Athanos|You require more training.}}
*{{text|say|Athanos|Your efforts are insufficient, Aspirant.}}

Thankfully this one-shot does not result in a trip to the graveyard, as players will not go beneath 1 HP. Pelagos heals the player back to full health:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|That never gets easier to watch.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|A necessary lesson in humility.}}
