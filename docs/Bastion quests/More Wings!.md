==Objectives==
Collect 10 Animyllis Blooms.
* [[Animyllis Bloom]] (10)

==Description==
Idea! Maybe I am too heavy. Maybe need more wings!

[[Glimmerfly|Glimmerflies]] have lovely wings. With correct bait and strong rope, perhaps we can catch.

Please bring Animyllis Blooms. Their nectar is delicious for glimmerflies, and makes them drowsy!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|95|75}}
* 9,200 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Animyllis Bloom nectar is a glimmerfly's favorite sleepytime treat!

==Completion==
I enjoy these blooms. Such a unique odor, yes?
