==Objectives==
Collect [[Kala]]'s playthings.
* [[Kala's Slobber Ball]]
* [[Mister Mikanikos]]
* [[Comfy Comfort Pillow]]

==Description==
When the animals became aggravated, we left in a hurry. However, all of Kala's toys are still inside the garden.

Since you are going to be there, would you please collect them? Kala may be very large, but she is still young. She can be a bit of a troublemaker as well.

Hopefully the return of her toys will help keep her distracted.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Do you have her playthings? She's becoming quite the handful!

==Completion==
Kala! Look! <Name> brought back your favorite things!
