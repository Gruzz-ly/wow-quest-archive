==Objectives==
Reveal the final memory.
* Final Memory Revealed

==Description==
<The Vault-Keeper examines you.>

You appear to carry a signature unique to one of the Paragons. If you know which Paragon, simply peer into their Soul Mirror to examine the memory of your choice.

If you require anything else, you need only speak.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|47|73|60}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the memory you seek?

==Completion==
I hope your experience was satisfactory.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Vault-Keeper Mnemis|Please present archived memories to the corresponding eye to view them.}}

Five mirrors light up, clockwise from the left: Purity, Humility, Loyalty, Wisdom, and Courage. There's also an [[Eye of Agthia]] that is not accessible... Interacting with an Eye reveals the corresponding Paragon:

*[[Eye of Purity]]: [[Vesiphone]]
:{{Text|say|Vesiphone|No burden is forever.}}

*[[Eye of Humility]]: [[Chyrus]]
:{{Text|say|Chyrus|We are stronger together!}}

*[[Eye of Loyalty]]: [[Devos]]
:{{Text|say|Devos|My charge is sacred.}}

*[[Eye of Wisdom]]: [[Thenios]]
:{{Text|say|Thenios|Learn from the past, but do not linger in it.}}

*[[Eye of Courage]]: [[Xandria]]
:{{Text|say|Xandria|Serve with courage.}}

Interact with the Eye of the Archon:
:''An [[Image of Lysonia]], a Shrouded Figure, and a [[Mawsworn Champion]] appear.''
:{{text|say|Image of Lysonia|Why did you send the vengeful one away?}}
:{{text|say|Shrouded Figure|His gaze is too narrow, yet, for what I now offer you.}}
:{{text|say|Shrouded Figure|There is another power at play. We do not fight for Bastion alone.}}
:{{text|say|Shrouded Figure|Once you have taken Purity, we will make our move. Together, we will achieve great things.}}
:{{text|say|Shrouded Figure|If we take another...}}
:{{text|say|Image of Lysonia|I understand. It will be done.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|So it is true... The [[Forsworn]] are in league with the [[Maw]]!}}
