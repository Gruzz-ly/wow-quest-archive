==Description==
Too long have my hands been idle!

<Forgelite Sophone smiles warmly at you.>

You cannot know what this means to me, but I might be able to show you. For your aid in restoring my forge, please allow me to craft you a piece of armor.

It will not be an extravagant affair, but through good works we grow to know ourselves better.

I will need your aid once more. Sika and I will guide you on the specifics. All you need to do is listen and do as instructed.

What do you say?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Waylight Vestment
|Waylight Breastplate
|Waylight Chainmail
|Waylight Tunic
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is no greater pleasure than creating something from nothing.

==Completion==
I hope you like it. It is far from my finest work, but it will serve you well while you are here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Sika will show you how to operate the forge.}}

Speak to Sika:
:We help Forgelite, yes? 

:Big forge, need heat. Not too much. Just some.

:I show?

:{{gossip|Show me what to do, Sika.}}
:{{text|say|Sika|Put bright things in forge. Is fuel. Try!}}

The [[Raw Materials (Bastion)|Raw Materials]] from before light up. Above the forge is a progress bar, with the middle third highlighted. The goal is to keep the heat indicator in the middle third. As time passes, the heat indicator moves back to the left as the forge cools.

Put in five:
:{{text|say|Sika|Too hot? Vents make it better. Open one, please.}}

Interact with either [[Anima Forge Vent]]:
:{{text|say|Sika|Now... keep juuuust right. Not too hot, not too cold. Yes? Go!}}

The vent will quickly drain the heat. Now the minigame starts. The forge could be too cold:
:{{text|say|Sika|More fuel! More!}}

Occasionally, a surge will happen and the forge rapidly heats up for several seconds:
:{{text|say|Sika|AH! Surge! Open vents!}}

The forge could also cool abnormally quickly for several seconds:
:{{text|say|Sika|Cold! Help! Cold!}}

If the temperature is acceptable:
:{{text|say|Sika|This good. Just like that, please.}}

Eventually, the progress will reach 100%:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Come, I have need of your hands.}}
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Hold the armor steady, now.}}

Interact with the [[Incomplete Armor]]:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|This is the most delicate part of the process. Precision is key.}}

This starts a long channel. Don't move until it completes:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Ahhhh. It is finished!}}

;Objectives
Assist Forgelite Sophone.
*Speak to [[Forgehand Demikos]]
*Stoke the forge
*Hold the armor steady

;Description
We have the materials, and we have the [[anima]] to power the forge.

It is time to create something magnificent.

I have dedicated my existence here to learning the ways of the forge. Over thousands of your years I have improved my process and the result is armor unlike any other.

I would be glad to give you a glimpse into my methods. All you need to do is listen and do exactly as I say.

How does that sound?

;Completion
This armor has your mark on it, <name>. Cherish it, and know that it is the best it can be for where you are now.

In the future, you will find ways to grow.

;Notes
;Accepting the quest
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Just as my hammer will know the material, your hands will know this forge. Demikos will give your first task.}}
{{text|say|Forgehand Demikos|Follow, please, <name>.}}
:''Sophone and Demikos go inside the nearest building''

;Talking with Demikos
Are you ready to begin the armor forging process?
:{{gossip|Let's make some armor.}}

{{text|say|Forgehand Demikos|We need to add anima cores. See them there?}}
{{text|say|Forgehand Demikos|Add them slowly! Too fast, and the anima will escape.}}
{{text|say|Forgehand Demikos|Too slow, and the forge will cool. So. Do as I say, yes?}}

:''When you have to click on [[Pile of Anima Cores]]''
{{text|say|Forgehand Demikos|More cores! More!}}

:''When you have to click on [[Animaforge Vent]]s.''
{{text|say|Forgehand Demikos|AH! A surge! Open the vents! All of them!}}

;Completing the armor
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Come, I have need of your hands.}}
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Hold the armor steady, now.}}
:''Click on [[Incomplete Armor]].''
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|This is the most delicated part.}}
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|I will infuse the armor with anima purified in the heart of the forge.}}
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|If I move too swifty, it will not bind with the material.}}
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Too slowly, and the strands will cool...}}
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Precision is key.}}
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Ahhhh. Here we are.}}

;Completing the quest
{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|[[Aspirant Akimos]] should be ready for you, now. Treat your armor well and it will protect you from the trials to come.}}

There is also a Hold the heat steady NPC visible.
