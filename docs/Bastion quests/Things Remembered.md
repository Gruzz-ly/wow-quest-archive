==Notes==
Every odd scroll collected on the [[Walk of Recollection]], one character will tell part of their story. There are eight characters in all, and hearing all eight of their stories will award the achievement [[What Bastion Remembered]]:
;[[Chyrus]]
:{{text|say|Chyrus|I find myself in need of reflection and my good friend Thenios bade me come here. Will you, dear parchment, relieve me of this burden I now carry?}}
:{{text|say|Chyrus|I lost an Aspirant today. I am not so vain as to think their fate was firmly within my control, but even so, the loss was sudden... and painful.}}
:{{text|say|Chyrus|She was nearing the end of her trials. My temple was the last that stood between her and Ascension, and yet it was not pride that caused her to falter.}}
:{{text|say|Chyrus|She spoke of an incalculable loss. Of a life she no longer recognized save in records and writings. The path, she said, erased who she was!}}
:{{text|say|Chyrus|I tried to remind her of all that she had gained, but in the end... I find myself asking if this was the only way. I have only questions, dear scroll, and no answers.}}
;[[Eridia]]
:{{text|say|Eridia|I met a most fascinating aspirant, recently. Her name is Lysonia and we bonded over a mutual affinity for music.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|She played the harp, I played the flute. We serenaded one another for hours before parting ways. We agreed that we would like to train together at the next available opportunity.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|When we met at the sparring arena, it was if I had entered into a dance. Our movements were so in sync. I nearly forgot that we were supposed to be training!}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|After, we found a quiet spot to peer out toward Elysian Hold and we shared our dreams for the future. She hopes to join Devos in the Temple of Loyalty, while I look to Purity for my destiny.}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|I feel as if I have known her for eons. Do you think... she will agree to be my Soulbind?}}
;[[Kalisthene]]
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|I wish to recount what has become the most consquential day in our long history.}}
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|It was a day like any other. Aspirants went about their journeys. Stewards tended to them. The Ascended came and went from Oribos in the usual way.}}
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|I recall so clearly... the steady stream of souls from Oribos to our realm simply... stopped. One moment we were greeting the newest arrivals, the next moment there were none.}}
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|At first we felt it merely a pause. After all, noble souls worthy of Bastion are not so common! But then a day passed. Then two. Then ten.}}
:{{text|say|Kalisthene|Our decline is a slow one. Marked with catious but baseless optimism. This has never happened before. But in the end... I must ask... Who are we without new aspirants to train?}}
;[[Kleia]]
:{{text|say|Kleia|I asked again, today, when I can attempt my final rite. Again, no answers. This place has taught me patience, certainly, but still I find it tested.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|I see the frustration of my fellow Aspirants. I feel it most acutely myself, but I must not show it. They look up to me! Pelagos looks up to me...}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|When will this drought end? What caused it in the first place? Do the Ascended know, or are they just as lost as we are? How I wish I had answers.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|I must remember my training. Center myself. Find peace in the things I can control.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Do it for Pelagos, Kleia... Do it for him.}}
;[[Mikanikos]]
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|As is tradition among the Forgelite Primes before me, I invented something new!}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|We have many centurions, all with different purposes. Big strong ones. Fast ones that fly. Quick ones that you can ride, yes.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I thought--what do centurions not do? They speak, but they are not smart. They do not know things. Why not?}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|I am Forgelite Prime, so I made one. I took a Praetor and gave it a mind core. It repeats things too many times, but it answers questions! Very... very simple questions.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Think of possibilities! All the knowledge we can store! I shall call it... a Mnemis. Yes. Genius!}}
;[[Pelagos]]
:{{text|say|Pelagos|I am told that writing things down grants one the ability to reflect and distance themselves from their problems. Let me see...}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Today, I again attempted the Rite of Purity. My Soulbind reassured me that I was ready. I felt strong, at first! But then I succumbed, as I always do.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Why am I so terrible at this? It all makes perfect sense when [[Kleia]] explains it, but when it comes time to act, I seem to forget all that I have learned.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|I worry I will never ascend. I will be sent back to [[Oribos]], and the [[Arbiter]] will peer at my soul and--}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Wait. I am not alone in this. I have Kleia, after all! Like she says, I get a little better each time. Some day, I will overcome! Some day...}}
;[[Forgelite Sophone]]
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|I was meditating on my life before and I recalled something most important. This recording shall serve as a reminder, in the eons to come.}}
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|I was not a maker before I came to Bastion. In fact, beyond the art of war I had no skill of great value. I served my people, yes, but at what cost?}}
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|As I neared the end of my life, I realized I would depart having only taken from my world. The only gift I gave was death.}}
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|My soul woke in Bastion. I learned to work a forge. That drive I felt in life took a new form. I could create, instead of destroy.}}
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|I see it now, this path that I have always walked. I will not forget it.}}
;[[Uther]]
:{{text|say|Uther|All around me, the Ascended speak of the Path. The trials by which each soul must find its peace, its eternity, after a lifetime of flawed mortality.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|I have tried to forget. I have tried to forgive. Yet... He lingers in every waking thought. Down every path.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|This anger is foreign to me. Unrecognizable. I must cleanse it. That is my path. My Paragon said it should be so, and it WILL be so.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|The Light has damned your soul, Arthas. May it rot in the Maw!}}
:{{text|say|Uther|Will his fate ever bring me peace? Will I ever be free of him? Perhaps... in time. Perhaps.}}
