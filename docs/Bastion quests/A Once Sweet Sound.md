==Objectives==
Cleanse the Vesper of Purity and the Vesper of Harmony.
* [[Vesper of Purity]] cleansed {{co|57.3|71.1|Bastion}}
* [[Vesper of Harmony]] cleansed {{co|60.2|73.5|Bastion}}

==Description==
The bells! That sound!

Their song has been twisted! If their dire toll continues, we will all succumb.

<Eridia presses her hammer into your hands.>

Find the great vespers within the temple and strike them with my hammer. May the mallet's tonal purity restore their true voices!

I will listen for their clarion call and meet you near the bridge. Go swiftly!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chime of Melodic Reflection
|Melody Defender's Bulwark
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Such a bitter sound!

==Completion==
I can hear their song once more. It is a boon on my mind, but the loudest voice remains. We must silence it before it destroys all that we hold dear.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests, then head out, killing a path north. Don't make a beeline north, as due west of Eridia is [[Acolyte Galistos]], who offers an optional side quest: [[An Inspired Moral Inventory]].

Up near the [[Vesper of Purity]], be on the lookout for a [[:Dark Sermon]] scroll, which starts [[Dangerous Discourse]], a mandatory quest in the campaign.

==Progression==
{{The Temple of Purity}}
