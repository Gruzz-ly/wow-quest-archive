{{questportrait|Locus-Keeper Mnemis.png|Locus-Keeper Mnemis|Mnemis units are usually helpful. This one is not. Mikanikos believes some manual recalibration is in order.}}
==Objectives==
Help Mikanikos reset Locus-Keeper Mnemis.
* Speak to [[Mikanikos]]
* [[Locus-Keeper Mnemis]] defeated {{co|57.2|55.0|Bastion}}
*Speak to Locus-Keeper Mnemis

==Description==
I have had it with this insolence!

I have an idea to reset this Mnemis's personality, but you will need to keep it busy.

It will try to fight you, through whatever means it posseses. I suggest you try not to perish. Kleia can hold her own, so hide behind her if so inclined.

Hop to it!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pure Aspirant's Hood
|Courageous Aspirant's Helm
|Humble Aspirant's Helm
|Judicious Aspirant's Helm
}}

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|86|80}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hope you will forgive my behavior. I was not feeling quite like myself.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Keep the Mnemis occupied! I will fix!}}

Kleia has new gossip:
{{book|content=I have never seen a Mnemis unit behave this way. It is... disturbing.}}

Speak with Mikanikos again:
{{book|content=
Just give the word and I will get started.

{{gossip|I am ready.}}
