==Objectives==
Investigate the temple wards in [[Elysian Hold]].
* [[Ward of Purity]] checked {{co|52.0|78.9|Elysian Hold}}
* [[Ward of Humility]] checked {{co|58.5|88.6|Elysian Hold}}
* [[Ward of Wisdom]] checked {{co|59.1|89.4|Elysian Hold}}
* [[Ward of Loyalty]] checked {{co|54.1|75.4|Elysian Hold}}
* [[Ward of Courage]] checked {{co|61.2|85.7|Elysian Hold}}

==Description==
Each temple of [[Bastion]] is protected by a ward here in Elysian Hold. As long as the wards hold, no malevolent force can launch an assault.

It is concerning that the [[Forsworn]] were able to attack Purity in such force...

Your orders are to examine the wards. As long as they hold, Bastion stands strong.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|93|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The wards each protect one of the temples of Bastion. If a ward is not active, that temple stands vulnerable.

==Completion==
It seems the Forsworn are in our very midst, even in the Spires.

We must send aid to the [[Temple of Courage]] posthaste.

==Notes==
Head southeast. The first two wards are Purity and Loyalty:

:{{text|say|Kleia|Peculiar... the Ward of Purity is disabled. This is surely what allowed the Forsworn to invade in such force.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Good, the [[Temple of Loyalty]]'s ward is active. The kyrian meditating on their duty to Bastion and the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]] are safe.}}

Further southeast and Pelagos notices something:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|How strange... why are those praetors deactivated?}}

Near the southeast end are the Humility, Wisdom, and Courage wards:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|[[Temple of Humility|Humility's]] ward stands strong. However, perhaps it would do the Forsworn service to relearn the lessons taught there.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|The past memories of all kyrian are stored at the [[Temple of Wisdom]]. I am quite relieved to see its ward holding.}}

Interact with the Ward of Courage:
:{{text|say|Kleia|The Ward of Courage holds. That is quite the relief.}}
:{{text|say|[[Uther]]|Fools! The Forsworn will triumph over the Archon.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Quickly, we must alert the Polemarch!}}

This concludes the "By the Archon's Will" chapter of the [[Bastion storyline]]. The campaign concludes with [[Imminent Danger]].
