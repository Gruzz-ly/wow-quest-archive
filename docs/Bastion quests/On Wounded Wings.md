==Objectives==
Heal 5 Wounded Defenders.
* [[Wounded Defender (Bastion)|Wounded Kyrian]] healed (5)

==Description==
I see my peers fall in pain, their wounds from the [[Void]] overtaking them.

We cannot allow ourselves, or each other, to give up hope.

Share your anima with our wounded brothers and sisters. Help them stand tall for another fight!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Our strength comes in our devotion to each other.

==Completion==
My disciples resolve, standing to fight another day.

I will not take that in vain.

==Notes==
Infuse any [[Wounded Defender (Bastion)|Wounded Kyrian]] you come across with [[anima]] and they will aid you in combat as [[Agthian Defender]]s for a while.
