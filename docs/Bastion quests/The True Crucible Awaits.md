==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kleia]] and [[Pelagos]] in [[Aspirant's Crucible]].

==Description==
I confess, <name>. I had little hope when you first arrived.

Kleia is convinced that your presence here is a sign of things finally improving in [[Bastion]]. I was... skeptical.

<The Forgelite gestures to her forge.>

What you have done for me will not soon be forgotten. There is a path beyond the Crucible. To walk it, you must overcome a trial. It will be difficult. Such a thing takes eons for most.

You are not most.

Kleia and Pelagos will tell you more. They await you near the sparring grounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|36|35}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Forgelite's gratitude goes deeper than you know.

Now. You must turn your attention back to our purpose here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Kleia may be right to place her faith in you. Go in service.}}
:{{text|say|Sika|Bye! Come back soon!}}

Find Kleia and Pelagos:
:{{text|say|Kleia|I see you have earned the forgelite's favor. Good.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Time to put your new armor to the test.}}
