==Objectives==
Collect 6 Dark Sermons.
* [[Dark Sermon]] (Provided) (6)

==Description==
<The scroll's runes shift and change as you attempt to read it. At first glance, it appears illegible.

Similar scrolls have appeared all over the [[Temple of Purity]].

[[Eridia]] will be interested in these.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must defend the temple, <name>.

==Completion==
These words... this voice...

How do I know this voice?

==Notes==
This quest is started by the Dark Sermon object up near the [[Vesper of Purity]]. Interact with it, then look around for more scrolls:
#{{text|say|Lysonia|My fellow Kyrian! Hear me now: Too long have we struggled under the tyranny of erasure.}}
#{{text|say|Lysonia|Over and over again we are told that we must give all we are, to serve a greater purpose.}}
#{{text|say|Lysonia|The Forsworn would have you keep your memories, your attachments!}}
#{{text|say|Lysonia|We are here to liberate you. To offer another path.}}
#{{text|say|Lysonia|Join us, and be embraced! Resist, and you will be swept aside.}}
#{{text|say|Lysonia|A new order has come. We must all decide where we stand.}}

==Progression==
{{The Temple of Purity}}

==Alpha version==

;Description
I found this scroll while you were cleansing the temple.

These are dire words, and I suspect it only gets worse. Collect more of these scrolls so I can determine just what these so-called [[Forsworn]] want.
