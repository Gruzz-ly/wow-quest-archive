==Objectives==
Seek the assistance of the Paragon of Humility.
*Paragon of Humility found
*Situation explained
*[[Polemarch Adrestes]] convinced

==Description==
I must politely decline your [[Prince Renathal|Prince]]'s offer.

My skills are needed here, and I am not particularly well-suited to the social demands of attending court.

Perhaps the Paragon of Humility would be a better representative for [[Bastion]].

You may find him at the [[Temple of Humility]], east of here.

Please express my sincere regrets that I will be unable to attend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*9,450 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Polemarch Adrestes]]

==Progress==
My answer has not changed.

==Completion==
Thank you for the reminder that sometimes duty calls me to do things that I find uncomfortable.

<Polemarch Adrestes salutes you.>

==Notes==
This quest becomes available after using the [[Guest List Page#Third guest]] rewarded by [[Court Influencer]].

;Upon approach
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Hail, Maw Walker.}}

;Upon accept
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|I serve as needed, and I am needed here}}

The Polemarch rejects the offer and directs you to the Paragon of Humility. You attempt to give him the invitation.
:{{text|say|Chyrus|Oh, there is some mistake? This is addressed to Polemarch Adrestes?}}

Chyrus gossip:
:Why are you not delivering this missive to Polemarch Adrestes?

*He declined and suggested that you are a better choice to represent Bastion.
*He said his skills are needed here and he cannot leave.
*He was displeased with the idea of attending court when I spoke with him.

Regardless of the choice, he replies,
:{{text|say|Chyrus|I would be honored to attend. Yet, Polemarch Adrestes is the intended guest.}}
:{{text|yell|Chyrus|Polemarch Adrestes, attend me please.}}
:{{text|say|Chyrus|You should understand that the Polemarch will never happily embrace changes to his routine. All the same, it would be good for him. Let me sort this out.}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Oh, hello again, <name>. Why do I suspect this isn't good news?}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|I have been summoned. How may I aid you, Paragon?}}
:{{text|say|Chyrus|Ah, Adrestes. I hear you are too important to accept the invitation of Prince Renathal? Or have I misunderstood your concerns?}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|No, of course not. But surely there are others better suited to these frivolities?}}
:{{text|say|Chyrus|Very likely. I am glad you have this opportunity to improve yourself as you serve the Archon's will.}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|As you say, Paragon. I will overcome my discomfort.}}

;Upon completion
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Please give Prince Renathal my thanks for the invitation. I will be sure to attend the Ember Court.}}

;Gossip upon completion at 'Stranger' reputation level
:What brings you to Hero's Rest, Maw Walker?

:If you require military assistance, the sentries and I stand ready to serve.

:Or perhaps you bring news from Sinfall? I can pass it up the chain of command.

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Description
My duty here is far more important than [[Prince Renathal]]'s [[Ember Court|party]]. Perhaps the Paragon of Humility would be a better choice and able to represent [[Bastion]].

Please express my regrets that I will be unable to attend.
