;Speaking with Thetes
:You there! You look... familiar. Have we met before? No, there is no time. I need your help.

:There is a text here that is sacred to devotees of the Temple of Courage. It tells the tale of one of our greatest heroes.

:I worry that these beasts have destroyed it already, but I cannot leave until I know for sure. Will you accompany on this mission?

:{{Gossip|I will accompany you.}}

:{{Text|say|Aspirant Thetes|Come, we must retrieve the scroll before these monsters can destroy it!}}
:{{Text|say|Aspirant Thetes|There it is! Archon be praised, the text is unharmed.}}
:{{Text|say|Aspirant Thetes|Hold a moment while I secure it for travel...}}
:{{Text|say|Aspirant Thetes|There. Let us make haste!}}
:{{Text|say|Aspirant Thetes|I know we are not meant to dwell on our past attachments, but this whole endeavor reminds me of my wife. At any rate, thank you. I will return to the temple now.}}
