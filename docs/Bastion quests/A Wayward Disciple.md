==Objectives==
Locate Disciple Nikolon.
* Find the missing disciple {{co|59.9|69.1|Bastion}}
* Escort [[Disciple Nikolon]] to [[Eridia]]

==Description==
While you are here and as yet unaffected by this-- rash of doubt, we shall call it-- there is one other errand I would ask of you.

I sent one of the disciples to investigate reports of the fallen fleeing our temple. For their own safety, they must be taken to the [[Temple of Loyalty]].

Disciple Nikolon has yet to return. If he is to be found nearby, it will be near the border of our temple to the north.

Please, seek him out and ensure that he is not injured or in peril.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Cord of Uncertain Devotion
|Belt of Uncertain Devotion
|Cinch of Uncertain Devotion
|Cincture of Uncertain Devotion
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you located Disciple Nikolon?

==Completion==
Thank you for bringing him to me, <name>. He is in a worse state than any of us might have guessed.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eridia|Please seek out Nikolon and ensure his well-being. It is unlike him to tarry.}}

Head north along the edge of the map to find Nikolon and a Mawsworn kyrian... [[Uther]]!?
:{{text|say|Uther|The choice is yours. You know how to find us.}}
:''Uther flies off.''

Speak with Nikolon:
:<The disciple appears to be deep in thought. He does not look at you.>
:You had better seek another disciple, aspirant. I cannot help you.
{{gossip|Eridia asked me to find you.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|Come. I would have words with Eridia.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|What you just saw... I am not alone in my malcontent.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|Just look at the state of this temple. All these aspirants... their anguish.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|I cannot bear the sight of this suffering. I--}}

Nikolon stops as two [[Congealed Bitterness]]es and a [[Congealed Fear]] appear.<!-- Not sure on the numbers. --> Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|Even my own doubts grow... I must report to the Temple of Loyalty!}}
:''Nikolon runs in the direction of the Temple of Loyalty, before eventually stopping short, then turning back in the direction of Eridia.''
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|No... I am still needed here. I must endure!}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|Eridia... she can help me. She will not let me fall!}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|What is this... feeling... No!}}

Nikolon stops again as his [[Rising Hatred]] appears. Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Disciple Nikolon|She can save me. She can save me!}}
:{{text|say|Eridia|Disciple? What is wrong?}}

Before turning in, Eridia has a special gossip text:
:You bear witness to the most unusual circumstances, mortal. Please do not let it trouble you. We have need of all those of sound mind in these dark times.
{{gossip|I saw Uther speaking to Disciple Nikolon.}}
:Uther? That name does seem familiar.
:Perhaps the aspirant that Devos took under her wing? How curious that you recognized him. It must be notable because he is from [[Azeroth|your world]].

;If you wander
:{{Text|say|Disciple Nikolon|Please, let us not delay.}}
