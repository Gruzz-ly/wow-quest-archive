==Objectives==
Run an honest race with Vandellor.
*Speak with [[Vandellor]] to begin race
*Race Against Vandellor run

==Description==
A [[soul]] that refuses to cross the [[veil]] is a problem we [[kyrian]] are familiar with. I can help you.

But before I grant your weapon this power, I must know that you will not abuse it, and that your heart is true.

Let us run a race. Along the course, ring the bells. If your heart is pure, they will aid your speed. You must have at least five bells recently rung in order to complete the race.

Do not be distracted by shortcuts. And do not try to cheat to get ahead, it will not work.

Are you ready?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Be patient.

==Completion==
Such a stubborn young knight. She... almost seems to dredge up a memory of long ago.

Here, accept this gift of power. I wish you victory over your foe.
