==Description==
This situation may feel familiar, <name>.

When you found [[Pelagos]], he was undergoing a similar rite. As you saw, it can end in violence.

This will be the first time you are asked to draw out the burdens that held you to a mortal life. It may be a painful process. It is for many.

For you, this is the path you must walk to attain your goals. To earn the right to stand among us, to be heard. So we may carry your message to the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]] herself.

Center yourself. When you are prepared, we will begin.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Footguards of Self-Reflection
|Sandals of Soul's Clarity
|Contemplative Striders
|Boots of Inner Calm
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|63|40}}
*7,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is a moment worthy of celebration, <name>.

<Kleia smiles broadly at you.>

You have done it. They have come.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kleia|I have readied some items in the next chamber. They will help you prepare.}}

Kleia has some gossip text at this point:
:This is a moment of total focus, <name>. Do not let your thoughts wander from the task at hand.

Just to the northeast, the Crate of Ritual Vestments has some clean clothes, the pool can be bathed in, and the vespers can be rung.

Return to Kleia:
:I would only continue if you are absolutely certain you are ready, <name>. A cleansing of this kind can be dangerous, and I will not be able to aid you beyond words.

:Are you certain you are ready?

:{{gossip|I am ready to begin.}}
:''Kleia starts walking downstairs.''
:{{text|say|Kleia|In the chamber below, you will confront and subdue your deepest memories.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Few aspirants advance to this trial so quickly. If you succeed, you will have proven yourself to the ascended.}}

There are three soul mirrors in this chamber. Pick one and interact with it:
:{{text|say|Kleia|You must delve deeper, <name>. Try again.}}

An [[Adventurer's Malignant Reflection|<name>'s Malignant Reflection]] appears. Defeat it.

Interact with the second mirror:
:{{text|say|Kleia|There is still more you must pull from yourself. Open yourself to it.}}

Two reflections appear this time. Defeat them both.

Interact with the last mirror:
:{{text|say|Kleia|There. This is the moment you must overcome.}}

The screen goes white and an [[Anguished Memory]] spawns in the center of the chamber. Defeat it and the screen goes black:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Rest now. It is finished.}}

Players wake in the chamber with the pool, vestments, and vespers. Head outside.

Are you certain you are ready?
