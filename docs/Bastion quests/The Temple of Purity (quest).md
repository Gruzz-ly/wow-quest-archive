==Objectives==
Meet the [[Eridia|Hand of Purity]] at the [[Temple of Purity]].

==Description==
Greetings.

I am Kosmas, Disciple to the Temple of Purity.

The temple is a place of cleansing. Its sole purpose is to free aspirants of the burdens they carry with them from life. It is a place of quiet reflection even for those who have shed their burdens.

Of late, those who look to us for purification have grown numerous. My fellow disciples are stretched terribly thin. I have come to ask the aid of all able-minded aspirants.

Your help is needed. Please report to the Hand of Purity at once.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|36|35}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for volunteering.

==Notes==
On accept:

;Description
Greetings, Aspirant.

I am Disciple Helene and I have come to lay eyes on the newest arrivals in [[Bastion]].

You represent the multitude of Aspirants who have yet to undergo the purification rituals that my kin oversee. Your insight is more valuable than you could possibly know.

Eridia, the Hand of Purity, has requested a meeting. You will find her east of here, at the entrance of out temple.

Please, do not delay.

;Completion
I see it in your eyes. I feel it in your spirit. You have the vigor we need in this moment.
