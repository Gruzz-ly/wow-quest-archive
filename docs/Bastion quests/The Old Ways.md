'''The Old Ways''' is an optional side quest, offered by the stable master [[Klystere]] when players first arrive at [[Aspirant's Rest]] for [[Walk the Path, Aspirant]] during the [[Bastion storyline]].

==Objectives==
Collect an Elysian Thread, 4 Cloudstrider Pelts, and 12 Larion Plumes.
* [[Elysian Thread]] {{co|48.1|73.0|Bastion}}
* [[Cloudstrider Pelt]] (4)
* [[Larion Plume]] (12)

==Description==
You there! Might I ask your help?

I must confess, with the lack of new [[soul]]s arriving, our supplies have dwindled. We lack the means to clothe arrivals in proper [[kyrian]] attire.

Before the forging of the [[centurion]]s, aspirants trained against the native wildlife. Perhaps there is another way these beasts can prove useful.

If you collect materials from the [[cloudstrider]]s and [[larion]]s nearby, we can use them to ensure our new arrivals look the part.

Oh, and some thread from [[Caretaker Mirene|Mirene]], if you would!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Larion-Tooth Necklace
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|70|90|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt?

==Completion==
These are perfect! Go in service, always.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Klystere|Keep your eyes on the sky. Larions spend much of their lives airborne!}}

Purchase one [[Elysian Thread]] for {{cost|5}} from [[Caretaker Mirene]], the innkeeper nearby:
:{{Text|Say|Caretaker Mirene|Follow the path, outsider.}}

Plenty of wildlife to kill in the area.

==Progression==
{{Eternity's Call}}

==Alpha version==

The quest was named '''An Act of Service'''.

;Description
Oh, an outsider! Could you aid me with something?

We weren't sure if new [[soul]]s would ever arrive again. We lack the materials to even clothe arrivals in proper [[kyrian]] attire!

Before the creation of the [[Centurion]]s we would train against the beasts of [[Bastion]], but they can still prove useful.

If you could collect materials from the [[Cloudstrider|lighthoofs]] and [[larion]]s nearby, this humble aspirant would like to ensure our new brethren look the part.

Oh, and some new thread from [[Caretaker Mirene|Mirene]] if you don't mind!
