==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sika]].

==Description==
I have seen firsthand that you are a most capable [[soul]].

[[Kleia]] has told me of your purpose here. She has spoken of the hopes she places in you. I am not yet certain if I am ready to do the same.

There is one small task that I would set before you, however. My forge has grown cold without anima to keep it burning bright. I long to practice my craft again.

My helper, whom you have met before, can elaborate on our needs.

You will find Sika near the forge. I will follow shortly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|36|35}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hello again! This one is glad to see you!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Pelagos]]|Do you think they will truly be able to help us?}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|That is up to them. First, let them see.}}

Find Sika to the southwest:
:{{text|say|Sika|Oh! Hoo! Hello again!}}
:{{text|say|[[Forgelite Sophone]]|Did you make a list, Sika?}}
:{{text|say|Sika|Have it! Yes!}}
:{{text|say|Forgelite Sophone|Good. I found you some help.}}
