==Objectives==
Deliver Klystere's Gift to [[Acolyte Amalthina]] in the [[Temple of Purity]].
*[[Klystere's Gift]] (provided)

==Description==
The materials you supplied were more than sufficient for my purposes. For that, you have my gratitude.

I think I know how to make the best use of the excess.

A dear friend of mine recently achieved the role of [[Acolyte]] in service to the Temple of Purity. You are new here, so I will spare you the details, but it is an honor to serve a temple before one reaches ascension.

I want to celebrate her success with a gift. Will you take this parcel to Acolyte Amalthina?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|36|35}}
* 990 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Welcome to the Temple of Purity. How may I be of service?

==Completion==
What is this?

<She opens the parcel. A soft smile spreads over her face.>

This is wonderful. Thank you.

==Progression==
