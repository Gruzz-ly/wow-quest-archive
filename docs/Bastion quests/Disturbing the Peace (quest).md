==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Anima]]-Starved creatures.
* Anima-Starved creatures slain (10)

==Description==
This anima drought isn't hard on just the [[kyrian]]. The wildlife of Bastion are suffering too!

Many creatures are becoming aggressive and menacing, [[Etherwyrm|wyrms]] and [[cloudfeather]]s especially. They are hurting the other wildlife and long beyond saving.

If someone doesn't clear this garden of these starved creatures, we can no longer meditate here. And if we can no longer meditate, that will make the anima shortage even worse!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
We must deal with the anima-starved creatures so this place can return to a state of tranquility.

==Completion==
We can now better fulfill our duties here. I look forward to resuming my meditations. Thank you.

==Notes==
Kill 10 [[Anima-Starved Cloudfeather]], [[Anima-Starved Wyrm]]s, or [[Enraged Cloudfeather]]s.

==Progression==
{{In The Garden's Respite}}
