==Objectives==
Destroy 3 [[Void]] [[Portal]]s.
* [[Void Portal (Bastion)|Void Portal]] destroyed (3)

==Description==
The forces of the Void are infinite.

They travel through the [[Great Dark Beyond|Great Beyond]] by creating portals, twisting gateways between our [[plane]]s.

Quickly, move to close these portals. Cripple the swell of their forces for as long as we can hold.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
New portals shall open, but we can prevent the swell for a time.

==Completion==
Do not revel in our victory. More shall break through.

We must use this opportunity to strike.

==Progression==
{{In Agthia's Memory}}
