==Objectives==
Defeat the 3 Praetorian Sparring Assistants.
* [[Archilon]] defeated {{co|50.5|82.2|Bastion}}
* [[Epilon]] defeated {{co|50.5|78.8|Bastion}}
* [[Straticus]] defeated {{co|50.1|80.5|Bastion}}

==Description==
The trial to come will test you in ways you can likely only imagine.

I can see both from your past and from your demeanor that you are no stranger to combat. I would like to know where your strengths lie so we may address any weaknesses we find before your trial.

You will find three [[Centurion#Praetor|praetorian]] [[soldier]]s created for this purpose, each stronger than the last.

Defeat them all and I will consider your strength sufficient to continue at this time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How fares the combat?

==Completion==
Impressive. I see I have little enough to teach you.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out. [[Sparring Aspirant]]s are all over the area, and the three named quest targets are marked on the map.

To the south is Archilon:
:{{text|say|Archilon|Challenge Accepted. I will use level one training protocol.}}

Don't stand in bad:
:{{text|say|Archilon|Training protocol is completed. This combat sequence ends.}}

Epilon is to the northwest, past Straticus:
:{{text|say|Epilon|Challenge Accepted. I will use level two training protocol.}}

Don't stand in the more obvious telegraphed area of effect on the ground:
:{{text|say|Epilon|Training protocol is completed. This combat sequence ends.}}

Straticus is halfway between Archilon and Epilon:
:{{text|say|Straticus|Challenge Accepted. I will use level three training protocol.}}

An even bigger, bluer area of effect to be dodged this go around:
:{{text|say|Straticus|Training protocol is completed. This combat sequence ends.}}

==Progression==
