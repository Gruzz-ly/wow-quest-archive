==Objectives==
Free Curator Lano, Librarian Eratus, and Historian Tyrana.    
*[[Curator Lano]] freed
*[[Librarian Eratus]] freed
*[[Historian Tyrana]] freed

==Description==
These [[Forsworn]] are looting the artifacts contained in [[Kalliope's Rest]]. What is worse is they have captured many of the shrine's [[scholar]]s.

I fear they will interrogate these aspirants for knowledge about the artifacts held within the inner chamber of the shrine.

Most escaped with me, but Lano, Eratus, and Tyrana have not returned yet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|95|75}}
* 9,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Have you freed them?

==Completion==
We've already treated some of the kyrian you freed. Thank you for your aid, <class>.
