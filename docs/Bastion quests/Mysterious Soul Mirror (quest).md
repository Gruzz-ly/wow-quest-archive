==Objectives==
Bring the Mysterious Soul Mirror to [[Thenios]] at the temple in the [[Eonian Archives]].
* [[Mysterious Soul Mirror]] (provided)

==Description==
<A shimmering soul mirror draws your attention on [[Devos]]'s corpse.

Peculiar that she would keep one on her person. Perhaps Thenios will want to see this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How can I be of service?

==Completion==
<Thenios studies the mirror closely.>

I see.

==Notes==
The [[Mysterious Soul Mirror]] drops for Kyrian Covenant-aligned players who kill [[Devos (tactics)|Devos]] the first time, generally on the quest [[The Spires of Ascension]].

The nearest flight path is at the [[Eonian Archives]] off to the west or [[Sagehaven]] just to the south. Use the two transport pads to reach the center platform, where [[Thenios]], the Paragon of Widsom stands watch.

On complete:
