==Objectives==
Collect a Condensed Anima Mote from the Anima Extractor.
* Activate the [[Anima Extractor]] {{co|55.0|79.3|Bastion}}
* [[Ravenous Etherwyrm|Defend]] the Anima Extractor
* [[Condensed Anima Mote]]

==Description==
In days past, keeping a forge burning was a trivial task. The [[anima]] [[extractor]]s could run constantly without ever running dry.

Now, even turning an extractor on is a risk. [[Etherwyrm]]s, without the anima streams to feed on, are attracted to any source of anima. They are a frequent nuisance.

I am going to ask that you risk their attentions. Activate the extractor and guard it until it can accumulate what little anima remains.

Bring me the product it collects. Let us hope it is enough.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|63|40}}
*8,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is the extractor functional? How much were you able to acquire?

==Completion==
That is... somehow more and less than I expected. It will have to do.

==Notes==
Pick up all three quests, then head northwest.

Get to the [[Anima Extractor]] and interact with it to spawn the [[Ravenous Etherwyrm]]. Defeat it, then interact with the extractor again to loot the [[Condensed Anima Mote]].

==Progression==
{{The Aspirant's Crucible}}

;Objectives
Slay the [[Gorged Etherwyrm]].

;Description
Hello! You! Yes! You!

Demikos would ask a favor. Would you help a humble [[Steward]]?

We suspect the [[anima]] collector has attracted the affections of an etherwyrm. This happens often, now. Not before.

How do we know? The screaming. Yes. Stewards do not like it when this happens.

Please kill it.

;Completion
The screaming stopped. Good.

Demikos is grateful to you.
