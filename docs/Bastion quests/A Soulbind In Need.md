==Objectives==
Rescue Pelagos.
* Find [[Pelagos]] {{co|25.0|58.3|Bastion}}
* [[Excruciating Memory]] slain {{co|17.0|60.1|Bastion}}

==Description==
Pelagos is my [[Soulbind]]. He is my brother, my closest friend, my mentor, and my student. He knows me completely, and I him. It is a bond stronger than any other.

That he now struggles is a torment to me, but I am forbidden from intervening. An aspirant must succeed or fail on their own merits, or the trial is forfeit.

I am bound by this law... but you are not.

Please bring Pelagos back to me. This will not be his last trial. Not when he may finally have a chance.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Pure Aspirant's Leggings
|Courageous Aspirant's Breeches
|Humble Aspirant's Leggings
|Judicious Aspirant's Legguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I owe you a great debt, <name>.

==Notes==
Accept both of Kleia's quests:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Pelagos may soon succumb to doubt and fear. Make haste.}}

[[Klystere]], the [[stable master]], offers a side quest nearby: [[The Old Ways]]. Pick it up, or not, then head into the [[Aspirant's Quarters]] to the northeast of Kleia, killing [[Clinging Memory|Clinging Memories]] and [[Bitter Memory|Bitter Memories]] along the way.
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|I'm so sorry...}}
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|So many... trails...}}
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|I was never good enough!}}
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|This is impossible!}}
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|Kleia... help me!}}
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|Alone... all alone...}}
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|I will never ascend.}}
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|Did I... fail?}}
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|No!}}
*{{text|say|Bitter Memory|Ahh...}}

At the far western end of the quarters, [[Pelagos]] is being held aloft by an [[Excruciating Memory]]:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|H-elp... me...}}

Aggro the memory:
:{{text|say|Excruciating Memory|You are weak. Ascension will never be yours.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|I am... weak... I will... fail...}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Excruciating Memory|Your failure... is a stain... on your soul...}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|No. No! I must not give in!}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Huh, that was too close for comfort. Thank you. I feel much better now.}}

Pelagos returns to [[Aspirant's Rest]]. Take advantage of the Resolved Trauma buff, which turns all memories neutral, to quickly exit the cave:
:{{text|say|Kleia|That was reckless, Pelagos. You would have fallen if not for that mortal!}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|I thought I could succeed on my own. But I was wrong...}}

This completes the "Eternity's Call" chapter of the [[Bastion storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[The Aspirant's Crucible]].
