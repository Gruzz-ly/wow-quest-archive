At the [[Temple of Humility]], click on the [[Return to Life]] and [[Pass to Shadowlands]] bell objects to choose an answer. Multiple souls are possible:

;[[Prancing Protector]] ([[dryad]])
:{{text|say|Prancing Protector|The grove is in danger! The little ones won't make it to safety without me!}}
:;Return to Life (wrong)
:{{text|say|[[Watcher Jacintha]]|Though some souls tied closely with nature do return after resting in [[Ardenweald]], others spend eternity within its boughs.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|As a nature spirit, she was sent to Ardenweald to further aid those with need, such was her destiny.}}

;[[Briny Brawler]] ([[Kul Tiran]] [[pirate]])
:{{text|say|Briny Brawler|I was dueling my hothead of a brother and I... I couldn't bear to lose the louse! I drew me sword slow and paid the price.}}
:;Return to Life (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Self-sacrifice for family is noble, but no cause to return to the land of the living.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|No matter how tragic, it was her time to go to [[Oribos]] and her eternity.}}

;[[Unyielding Sentinel]] ([[night elf]])
:{{text|say|Unyielding Sentinel|The [[Teldrassil|tree]] is burning! I... can't breathe...}}
:;Return to Life (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|This was a troubling death, but it is not our duty to decide the morality of her fate.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|It was her time. Unfortunately, the only eternity waiting for her was the [[Maw]]. Such matters are not our duty to decide, but the [[Arbiter]]'s.}}

;[[Fallen Knight]] ([[death knight]])
:{{text|say|Fallen Knight|The [[Lich King]] calls to me. I must serve him once more!}}
:;Return to Life (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Though she bears the [[Domination|magic]] of the [[Shadowlands]], its pull originates from the world of the living. She had to return.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|It must be so. Though she had died once before, her master's call had to be answered before she could return to us.}}

;[[Molten Champion]] ([[flamewaker]])
:{{text|say|Molten Champion|Invaders threaten the [[Firelands]]! I must return to my kin at once!}}
:;Return to Life (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Good! Creatures of another [[plane]] must return there upon death. The Shadowlands are not their destiny.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|As this being is of Firelands magic, it cannot be sent to [[Oribos]] for judgment.}}

;[[Desiccated Lich]] ([[lich]])
:{{text|say|Desiccated Lich|I have been at this [[veil|crossroads]] countless times. I wish to be bound no longer! Grant me the peace of death!}}
:;Return to Life (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|That is right. No matter the soul's pleas, we must not change their fate.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|So long as the lich's [[phylactery]] remains intact, we must send him back.}}

;[[Battered Farmer]] ([[human]])
:{{text|say|Battered Farmer|Bandits ambushed my wagon and took my life. My family is doomed without me! They won't survive a month.}}
:;Return to Life (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|This soul has done nothing to make him a worthy candidate to return to life. Without him, his family learned to fend for themselves, and grew stronger because of it.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|You are correct. In life, this soul held his family back. He was overbearing, overprotective, and without him they have flourished and learned to fend for themselves. His death was timely.}}

;[[Valiant Sentry]] ([[human]])
:{{text|say|Valiant Sentry|I hear the dreaded call of the val'kyr. Please! Let me rest in peace! I beg of you!}}
:;Return to Life (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Well done. This soul came to us in time. Even the [[undead]] cannot escape death forever.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Though the [[val'kyr]] are not our true kin, their call back to the mortal plane must be honored.}}

;[[Battlescarred Grunt]] ([[orc]])
:{{Text|say|Battlescarred Grunt|Battle rages in my city. I must return to protect the little ones before the beasts reach them!}}
:;Return to Life (wrong)
:{{Text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Unfortunately not. Though others indeed died without him, he fulfilled his destiny in the mortal plane.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (correct)
:{{Text|say|Watcher Jacintha|That is right--he earned his warrior's death. He died honorably, and went on to much glory in [[Maldraxxus]].}}

;[[Brave Companion]] ([[corgi]])
:{{text|say|Brave Companion|Woof! Bark! Bark! Bark! Grrrr...}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Jacinthat|Allow me to translate. This creature fell protecting its master from a pack of wolves, and wishes to return to ensure they are safe.}}
:;Return to Life (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|It might be painful, but we cannot keep this creature away from their eternity.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Indeed, this creature had died a noble death and earned themselves a place in the [[Shadowlands]].}}

;[[Distraught Child]] ([[draenei]])
:{{text|say|Distraugt Child|I'm just a kid! I got sick and it just got worse and worse. Let me go back to my mommy!}}
:;Return to Life (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|I understand why you chose to return the child, but unfortunately we cannot allow every child to return to life. They may not have much [[anima]] built up yet, but all children being immune to death causes much bigger problems.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|You are correct. Sometimes we nudge children back to life so they can accumulate more anima, but unfortunately even children cannot be immune to death.}}

;[[Smoldering Sapper]] ([[goblin]])
:{{text|say|Smoldering Sapper|My Explodinator 5000 just, eh, explodinated the dam above my lab! All my experiments--I mean dear sweet pets--are in grave danger!}}
:;Return to Life (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Though many would indeed die in the flood that followed, it is not our duty to intervene in mortal affairs.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Correct. Though her town's fate may have been altered had she returned, it was her time.}}

;[[Ancient Naaru]] ([[naaru]])
:{{text|say|<The creature emits a cacophony of sounds.>}}
:;Return to Life (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Correct. Souls with sufficiently strong ties to other cosmic forces must be allowed to return.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|This is incorrect. We must not ferry souls who bear ties to other forces.}}

;[[Mantid Warrior]] ([[mantid]])
:{{text|say|Mantid Warrior|I am a commander of a battalion. A necromancer has wreaked havoc in my home, raising my soldiers to fight each other. I must have my revenge, but I fell in battle due to my foolishness.}}
:;Return to Life (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|This warrior was allowed to return to life, and he ended up defeating and killing the [[necromancer]]. If we had taken this warrior to [[Oribos]], the necromancer would have continued disrupting the balance of [[life]] and [[death]] in that world. }}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Some soldiers may die to their foolishness, but not this one. We allowed him to return and he killed the necromancer, who was upsetting the balance of life and death.}}

;[[Vile Fatedancer]] ([[shivarra]])
:{{text|say|Vile Fatedancer|Mmm! I haven't felt the sting of a blade like that in a while.}}
:;Return to Life (correct)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Correct. [[Demon]]s must return to the [[Twisting Nether]] from whence they came.}}
:;Pass to Shadowlands (wrong)
:{{text|say|Watcher Jacintha|Demons have no place in the Shadowlands, save for the occasional combatant in [[Maldraxxus]].}}
