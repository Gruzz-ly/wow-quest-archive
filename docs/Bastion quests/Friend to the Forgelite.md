==Objectives==
Return to [[Polemarch Adrestes]] in [[Elysian Hold]].

==Description==
With [[Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons|Phaestus]] in hand, we can start building [[Crest of Ascension|Crest]].

Let us return to Elysian Hold. Triumphant!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Mikanikos returned not long ago with his new centurion. Quite the unique unit.

Of course, the return of Phaestus to kyrian hands is good news indeed. The Archon will be pleased.
