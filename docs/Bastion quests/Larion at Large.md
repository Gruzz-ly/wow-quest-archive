==Objectives==
Find Andira in the [[Golden Pasture]] and return her to [[Nemea's Retreat]].
* [[Andira]] retrieved
* Andira returned

==Description==
Some [[larion]]s are more particular about the people they bond with than others.

[[Lentios]] is my companion, the larion I trust most with my life. I love the others as well, but he is a part of my [[soul]].

One of my pride, Andira, has posed a struggle for me to bond with. She ran off into the pastures once again, and I fear she's gotten into something she shouldn't have.

Would you mind finding her and bringing her home?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Andira and I do not see eye to eye. I know she will be a loyal companion... but perhaps to somebody else.

==Completion==
Incredible! It seems Andira has taken a liking to you. Perhaps you would be interested in bonding with her further?

==Notes==
*Once approached, she will run away in fear a few times. Get close and remove the thorn from her paw to get her to follow you.
*Andira's [[generic name]] is Tamed Larion.

;On return
:{{Text|Say|Nemea|<Name>, you return! Andira seems happy. I think she's taken a liking to you!}}

==Progression==
{{Pride or Unit}}
