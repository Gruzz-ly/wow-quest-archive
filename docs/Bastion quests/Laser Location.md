Bring [[Gatamatos]] to the [[Hall of Beasts]], then direct him to locate 6 Training Gems.

[[Phalynx]] have precise detection mechanisms that allow for excellent scouting.

In the cave below we have scattered gems that our units are trained to locate. Escort Gatamatos to run some drills and recalibrate his training.
