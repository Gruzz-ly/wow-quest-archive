==Progress==
Have you completed your meditation yet?

==Completion==
I always find meditation so relaxing and rewarding. Don't you? Now we are better prepared for our journey.

;Upon approach (at 'Stranger' reputation level)
:{{text|say|Pelagos|I wonder where the Maw Walker is headed...}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|He will tell us if he wants us to know.}}
;Upon approach (at 'Buddy' reputation level)
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Stay safe out there, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Wherever <name> is, is the safest place in the Shadowlands.}}
;On accept
:{{text|say|Kleia|I am glad you are going to join us, <name>. Race you, Pelagos!}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Wait! Kleia, how is this even fair? You have wings.}}

;In the [[Chamber of First Reflection]]'s main room
:{{text|say|Kleia|Pelagos wins! Wings are not great in a footrace, after all, <name>. Take the mirror to the right, and we will meet you in the recovery chamber afterwards.}}
Interact with the Soul Mirror on the south side of the room to begin. You'll gain the {{abilities|Mirror Gazing|id=335751}} buff and find yourself outside of your body. [[Kleia]] and [[Pelagos]] can no longer be seen; instead, [[Excruciating Memory (RSVP: Kleia and Pelagos)|Excruciating Memories]] fill the room.

;Five memories defeated
:''Your vision fades out, then you wake up in the recovery chamber.''
:{{text|say|Pelagos|I wish I felt like I was getting better at this, Kleia.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|I know it might not feel that way, but I can see that you are facing these memories more easily. You're doing well, Pelagos.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|If you say so. I believe you. I do. It just doesn't feel fast enough.}}
:{{text|say|Kelia|I know.}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Kleia|<Name>, we will see you again soon at the Ember Court.}}

;Gossip after completion at 'Buddy' reputation level
;Pelagos
I had no idea that courts could be so compelling, <name>. Truly, the Ember Court is an incredible endeavour on your part.
Uniting the Shadowlands, one teacup at a time!
Obviously, it;s much more than that. But still... who would've thought?

;Kleia
It's good to see you again here among the souls of Bastion, <name>.
Your Ember Courts have reassured me that you have dedicated yourself to the Shadowlands, even if you chose the venthyr as your primary tool to do so.

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2020-12-03|note=The quest "RSVP: Kleia and Pelagos" will now allow the player to use the soul mirror again and face their memories if they were defeated in a previous attempt.}}
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
