==Objectives==
Slay House of Constructs forces.
*[[House of Constructs]] forces slain (0/100%)

==Description==
We will show these Maldraxxi insurgents the price for their betrayal.

The northern grounds have been taken by the House of Constructs, home to [[Maldraxxus]]' most resilient [[warrior]]s.

They have earned no mercy this day, and we will give them none. We will carve through them side by side until this sacred ground is cleansed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is what must be done.

==Completion==
You fight with the poise of a true kyrian, outsider.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Keep your wits about you. Our enemy has no honor.}}

Pick up the other two quests before working on killing.

Eligible mobs are [[Rotting Discard]]s, [[Skullboar Spinebreaker]]s, [[Decrepit Bilespawn]], [[Bonewrought Thrasher]]s, [[Hulking Warflesh]], and [[Frail Spotter]]s.

Occasionally, Thanikos provides anima for healing
:{{Text|say|Thanikos|I have sheared off a portion of their anima! It will heal your wounds if you approach it.}}
