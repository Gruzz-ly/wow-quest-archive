==Objectives==
Use the Archonic Resonator to sunder 12 House of Rituals soldiers' corpses.
* [[House of Rituals]] [[corpse]]s sundered (12)
*[[Archonic Resonator]] (provided)
*Meet Thanikos at the Shattered Span.

==Description==
The House of Rituals occupies the southern half of the temple. Unlike the constructs, their key advantage in battle is their endless army of risen fighters.

Thankfully, the Archonic Resonator we recovered will take care of it.

As we carve our way through their forces, blast their corpses with the resonator. Its energy will sunder their [[soul]]s, preventing them from being raised to fight again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must ensure our foe stays dead, or our efforts will be futile.

==Completion==
The Resonator is working at full capacity and our foes are dispatched. Excellent.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|We shall all meet at the Shattered Span below once our work is done.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Loud and clear! I will just... move the colossus... somehow...}}

Kill hostiles and use the quest item on their corpses to get credit:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Do not forget to use the resonator, lest they rise against us once more.}}

[[Keeneye Bowman|Keeneye Bowmen]], [[War Wraith]]s, [[Undying Soldier]]s, and [[Dauntless Champion]]s all count. Upon using the item, they get the Sundered Soul debuff.

On the completion of both quest objectives:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Our forces have gathered at the Shattered Span. I shall meet you there.}}

Head to the Shattered Span:
:{{text|say|Thanikos|Your forces are already pushed back. You have lost.}}

==Progression==
