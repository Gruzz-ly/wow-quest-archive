==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Artificer Ligiea.png|Artificer Ligiea|While wearing your disguise, find her.}}
Find [[Artificer Ligiea]] farther into [[Kalliope's Rest]].

==Description==
With this disguise you will blend right in. I... know a [[Forsworn]] [[artificer]] on the inside who should prove useful. You need to remain convincing, however.

The most important thing is to get to [[Kalliope]]'s spear before the Forsworn manage to do so. The shrine has many defenses, but it's only a matter of time before they find it.

I am somewhat ashamed. Many of the aspirants here used to be friends. So much has been lost.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|65|25}}
* 3,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What is it? Don't just mill about.

Oh, it's you...

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Haetio|With a quick adjustment... there! You will look just like a Forsworn! Only wear it when you're here or in Kalliope's Rest, otherwise the kyrian might mistake you for an enemy.}}

The extra action button becomes available: {{Abilities|Forsworn Disguise|id=310616|icon=inv_epicguildtabard}}
