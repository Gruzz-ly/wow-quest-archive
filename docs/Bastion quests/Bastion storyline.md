The '''Bastion storyline''' comprises the seven level-up chapters of the Bastion campaign, first of the four zone storylines in the [[Shadowlands campaign]], tracked in the achievement [[The Path to Ascension]].

The storyline itself is linear, but there are a number of optional side quests and chains in the zone as well.

==Campaign==
===Eternity's Call===
Players land in Bastion and surprise [[Kleia]] with their arrival. After getting told to "follow the path" as if an aspirant, despite the news about the mawsworn kyrian, players save [[Pelagos]], Kleia's soulbind, from a meditation gone wrong.

The malcontents have formed a group, the [[Forsworn]], that launched a surprise attack on the temple. Players fight off the leader of the attack, [[Lysonia]] alongside the [[Paragon of Purity]] and obtained a fragment of Lysonia's essence.
