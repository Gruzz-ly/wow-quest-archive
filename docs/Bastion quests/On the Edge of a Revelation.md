==Objectives==
Inspire 11 [[Vulnerable Aspirant]]s to action.
*Aspirants inspired to action (11)
*Speak to Eridia within the Temple of Purity.

==Description==
Ah! Good. You answered the call.

As you can see, there are many aspirants who require our aid. Myself and the other disciples are hard pressed to deal with all of them. Some are in greater need than others.

Aspirants are most at risk when they are on the precipice of a revelation. It is a critical moment that we cannot allow to pass without intervention.

You must push them, one way or another.

Find the most vulnerable among your peers and do what you can to help them find the path forward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|63|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My disciples will be grateful for your aid, <name>.

==Completion==
Your service is noted. Thank you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|A word of encouragement may be what these aspirants need.}}

[[Vulnerable Aspirant]]s can be found all over. There are three varieties, of which each has five possible gossip texts:

Anima Drought:
*Even if I fall, they will not return me to Oribos. We are all doomed to remain here forever. There is no hope, not any longer.
*Even if I overcome this trial, there will be no more ascended. I am doomed to waste away in this temple until the end of time.
*Nothing I do here matters. None of us will ever see Elysian Hold. The Archon is silent. Without anima, we are trapped here.
*Soon there will be no anima for the bells. Soon there will be nothing to stop all of us from failing. And yet, we persist. <The aspirant heaves a deep, weary sigh.>
*This was hard before the anima faded away. Now, it is impossible. <The Aspirant stares wistfully upward.> Impossible.
*{{gossip|We will get through this together!}}
*{{gossip|I agree. Your world is ending.}}
*{{gossip|I am certain this drought will end... eventually.}}

Ascended:
*I can feel myself slipping away. All I want to do is hold on, but they say I must continue. Can they not see what this is doing to us? Are they blind?
*The Ascended watch me, waiting. Waiting. Am I failing them? Are they disappointed in me?
*<The Aspirant seems visible angry.> There has to be a way to pass this rite! There must be!
*There is a hole where my past used to be. Is this truly how it must be?
*They say I must give up who I am to become Kyrian. I like who I am... is it really true? Must I give everything?
*{{gossip|This is all part of the process. You will recover.}}
*{{gossip|Trust in your teachings. They have not led you astray before.}}
*{{gossip|Right! Who do these so-called "Ascended" think they are?!}}

Self doubt:
*Every day I meditate before the bells. Every day, my burdens fall from me. Every day, I come back and do it again. Am I ever going to leave this place? Will it ever be finished?
*I cannot do this. It is too hard. I will surely fall before I can complete this rite!
*I have been here so long. How am I still struggling with this?
*It just keeps coming back... the same memory... over and over and over again!
*<The Aspirant appears to have been crying recently.>
*{{gossip|You are probably right. Just give up.}}
*{{gossip|Everyone around you is going through the same thing. You will get through this.}}
*{{gossip|You can do this. I believe in you.}}

Pick a safe answer:
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|I needed to hear that. Thank you.}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|I lost sight of my goals. Thank you.}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|Of course, you are right. Thank you for reminding me.}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|I must not let the process overwhelm me. Thank you.}}

Pick an unsafe answer and 2-3 several congealed negative emotion mobs spawn:
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|Everything... hurts...}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|No! I-- Ahhh!}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|You don't know what this is like!}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|I can't do this! I can't do this!}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|That's what they always say!}}

Defeat them:
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|Oh! I feel... so much lighter.}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|Thank you, I think that was meant to happen.}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|Thank you... I think.}}

Pick a hostile answer and the aspirant turns hostile. Defeat it:
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|They will take me to the Temple of Loyalty... so be it.}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|I need to get out of here.}}
*{{text|say|Vulnerable Aspirant|I was tested, and I failed. I no longer walk the path.}}

;Disciples of Purity
*{{text|say|Disciple of Purity|Please, do not let them hurt themselves or anyone else. I must report this immediately!}}
*{{text|say|Disciple of Purity|Oh no! I must inform the Paragon!}}
*{{text|say|Disciple of Purity|I lost them... I must report this to the Paragon.}}
