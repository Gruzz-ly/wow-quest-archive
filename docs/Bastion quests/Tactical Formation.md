==Objectives==
Aid Gatamatos in taking the correct position in three formations.
*[[Gatamatos]] retrieved
* Line formation complete
* V formation complete
* Cross formation complete
* Gatamatos returned

==Description==
The principal step of our training regiment for our [[phalynx]] is formational drills. They must recall standard [[kyrian]] battle formations, and how to flow from one to the next.

Formational training is the final piece of information that Gatamatos is still missing. Please aid in retraining him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|35|80|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
A good soldier marches in order.

==Completion==
And with that, I believe that Gatamatos is once again functioning at standard.

Thank you for your aid.
