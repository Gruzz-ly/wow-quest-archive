==Objectives==
Collect 12 Centurion Cores.
*[[Centurion Core]] (12)
*Meet [[Mikanikos]] near the [[Mnemonic Locus|Locus]].

==Description==
All [[centurion]] are made to serve the [[kyrian]].

That they now work against ME, the Forgelite PRIME, is an insult to all centurions in [[Bastion]]. Look at them! Praetors! Goliaths! All... [[Forsworn|PURPLE]]!

I hereby give you permission and expressly order you to extract their cores. I will repurpose them in a fitting manner. I will reclaim their [[anima]] to power the Locus.

I can build more. Do not pity.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|86|80}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You have the cores?

==Completion==
Excellent. Their anima will be put to better use.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Was that... a Mnemis unit?}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Do not want to talk about it. But yes.}}

Defeat [[Converted Praetor]]s and [[Dark Goliath]]s for their cores and to clear a path to scrolls in various states of damage.

==Progression==
{{Chasing a Memory}}
