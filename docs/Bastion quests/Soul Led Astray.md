==Objectives==
Use the Soul Mirror at the [[Eonian Archives]] to view Uther's arrival in [[Bastion]].
* [[Uther]]'s memory viewed {{co|40.2|20.3|Bastion}}

==Description==
Uther was a being of justice on [[Azeroth|your world]]. I am sure it was quite surprising for you to see his fate here, following a leader who embodies what he stood against in life.

I believe you should witness this memory firsthand. Take it to my soul mirror, view the memories within.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Sometimes the hard truths are the most important to witness.

==Completion==
I hope that this memory helps you to understand Uther's path.

==Notes==
A few yards away is a Soul Mirror. Interact with it and [[Afterlives]] - Bastion plays:

:''On a dusty, forsworn field, a warhammer drops on the ground as Uther falls to his knees, breathing raspily. He looks up at Arthas, drawing [[Frostmourne]] from it's sheath. Uther closes his eyes as Arthas runs him through.
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|Light... save my soul.}}
:''Elysian Hold comes into view as Devos flies toward it with Uther in hand.''
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Uther...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|Where... Where am I?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Welcome... to Bastion.}}
:''On the ground, Uther looks up at Devos from his knees.''
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|You led a truly selfless life, and for that, you have been chosen.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|Chosen?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|To shed your mortal burdens and join the ranks of the ascended, serving to ferry the souls of the dead unto the Shadowlands.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|I serve the Light. And my work is not done. There is an evil that must be s--}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|There is no evil here. The darkness was sealed within the Maw long ago.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|You're wrong. He destroyed my home, murdered my people and my king. He must be punished.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|You are an Aspirant now. You must accept your new purpose, and purge yourself of this desire for vengeance.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|What I desire... is justice.}}
:''Devos looks at Uther, who is lost in thought, meditating in a field. Thenios approaches Devos from the rear.''
:{{text|bossemote|Thenios|Devos, why are you training this soul? It is beneath your station as a Paragon.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|He cannot let go. He continues to demand retribution for his death.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Thenios|And this concerns you? Many souls take eons to ascend.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Yes, but this one seems... broken, Thenios, unlike any soul I have seen. I have begun to wonder whether he was deemed worthy of Bastion... by mistake.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Thenios|Be careful, Devos. I would not let the Archon hear such a thought. In time, he will forget. Trust our ways. Trust the path.}}
:''Some time later.''
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|Devos... how long must we train?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Until you are ready to ascend.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|And what is keeping me from ascension?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Nothing but the memory of your mortal life.}}
:''Uther clutches his shirt above his heart.''
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|How can I forget when I can still feel his blade?}}
:''Devos reaches to Uther and moves his shirt, showing a wound above his heart on his chest.''
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|(GASPS) Your soul... is wounded? Who did this to you?}}
:''Tears well up in Uther's eyes.''
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|He was my student. He betrayed us all.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Show me.}}
:''Devos touches Uther's wound and she sees the moment Arthas ran him through, his soul splitting into two. Devos pulls back her hand in shock.''
:''At Elysian Hold, Devos is pleading her case before the Archon and the Paragons.''
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|The runes on his blade were unmistakable! This dark agent runs free on a mortal world with the power of the Maw itself in hand! Our realm is imperiled!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Thenios|Impossible! The Maw is inescapable. You must return to the path.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|If he had purged his life, we never would have known of this calamity! The path is flawed!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archon|Enough! The order of the Shadowlands depends on the execution of our eternal charge. You will abandon this course.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|As you command... my Archon.}}
:''Devos walks away, intent in her eyes. She returns to Uther, out in the fields.''
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Uther! The time of your ascension has come.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|I... thought I was not ready.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Do you wish to see him punished?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|I do.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Then prepare yourself.}}
:''Devos grants Uther his wings.''
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|The moment he falls... we will claim him.}}
:''Atop [[Icecrown Citadel]], Arthas lies supine on the ground, looking skyward at Devos, who is reaching down to him.''
:{{text|bossemote|Arthas|I see... only darkness... before me.}}
:''The pattern in Arthas' eyes is reflected in the redness of the Maw. Uther is holding Arthas by his neck.''
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Now, cast him into the Maw! Return him to the darkness he served! His eternal suffering awaits.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|He was... my student.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Devos|Remember what he did and take your vengeance.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Uther|Not vengeance. Justice.}}
:''Uther releases Arthas, dropping him into the Maw.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Thenios|Devos meant well... meant to right a perceived wrong... but Uther was not ready for the trials of ascension.}}
:{{text|say|Thenios|Straying from the path as the embodiment of loyalty itself set Devos's course irrevocably towards doubt, violence.}}
:{{text|say|Thenios|Her hand, Lysonia, quickly joined Uther in following her. As our anima stores waned, their numbers grew.}}
:{{text|say|Thenios|With Devos gone, Lysonia will surely taker her place leading the Forsworn. I pray we find peace before their campaign starts anew.}}
