==Description==
<Eridia peers down at you.>

Your face is new to me.

<Eridia frowns.>

I regret that this shall be your introduction to our temple. As my disciple has informed you, we seek the aid of all available aspirants to tend to those in our care.

Do not trouble yourself over the specifics of the work that is needed. Those devoted to this temple will guide you. Seek out the disciples within.

You may find me within the temple when you have given your aid.

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|63|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have proven yourself adept at this task. You have my gratitude.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eridia|Kleia, assist the paragon. Pelagos, you and our new aspirant will aid the disciples. Go in service.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Yes, ascended one.}}

Cross into the Temple of Purity proper:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|The Paragon is there, across the temple... and so many awaiting their rites.}}

Just inside, [[Disciple Kosmas]] is speaking to a few [[Cleansing Aspirant]]s:
:{{text|say|Disciple Kosmas|Those who fall will find respite in the Temple of Loyalty, until they can return to the path.}}

He offers a mandatory quest: [[On the Edge of a Revelation]]. Pick it up before moving onward.

===Disciple Fotima===
To the northwest, [[Disciple Fotima]] is overseeing [[Acolyte Danysia]]:
:You there! Did the Hand of Purity send you to me?
:I have need of one who can subdue the manifestations that may arise as part of this cleansing. Can you lend me your aid?
:{{gossip|I will help you.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Fotima|We must act quickly.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Fotima|Let the vesper's song fill your mind!}}
:{{text|say|Acolyte Danysia|It.... hurts...}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Fotima|Let it go. It will pass.}}

[[Danysia's Burden]] appears, taking the form of a male human, killing a female human with rogue abilities.
:{{text|say|Disciple Fotima|Her burden reveals itself. As with many, it is a memory of the one she could not save in life.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Fotima|Dispatch this remnant, so she may be purified.}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Disciple Fotima|It is done. How do you feel, acolyte?}}
:{{text|say|Acolyte Danysia|Lighter... and clearer.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Fotima|You are one step closer to your ascension, sister.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Fotima|You have my thanks, <name>.}}

Exit the area and Pelagos chimes in:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|That went well. Certainly better than my last cleansing.}}

===Disciple Helene===
To the southwest, [[Disciple Helene]] is working with [[Acolyte Galistos]]:
:Are you here to help us?
:I am in the midst of assisting this acolyte. He has chosen this day to meditate upon the pleasant things.
:Perhaps I can teach you a little about the cleansing process as we work. What say you?
:{{gossip|Tell me how I can help.}}

:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Thank you, <name>. I think you will find this exercise enlightening as well.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|As you will see, not all the memories that bind us are violent.}}
:''Tauren appear nearby.''
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Ah, I see. Bonds of kinship are strong indeed.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|A light touch will dismiss these images, <name>.}}

Interact with them to dispel them:
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Stronger still are bonds forged in war. This acolyte fought alongside his people in a great conflict.}}

Dispel these images as well:
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Closest to many are the bonds of family. They will not be easy to forget.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Just a little deeper... Oh!}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Wrestle control back, acolyte!}}
:{{text|say|Acolyte Galistos|I can't! AHHHH!}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Quickly, <name>, dismiss these memories!}}

Dispel the last:
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Calm... calm... we will try again another time.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Are you still with us?}}
:{{text|say|Acolyte Galistos|I think so. Yes.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Helene|Rest, for now. That was a difficult thing you just endured.}}

Leave the area:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|I remember my family, doubtful they would recognize me now! I hope when I must forget, it goes... not like that.}}

===Disciple Lykaste===
To the northeast are [[Disciple Lykaste]] and [[Acolyte Erisne]]:
:Ahhh, help at last!
:One of my acolytes is struggling to cleanse a truly horrific memory.
:I dare not release it without your consent. Will you help her defeat it?
:{{gossip|Begin the cleansing. I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Lykaste|Steel yourself. Your burden is buried deep.}}
:{{text|say|Acolyte Erisne|I am prepared.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Lykaste|This Vesper's mighty song will draw it forth!}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Lykaste|This is the moment! Fight it!}}

The [[Erisne's Burden|image of an eredar]] appears:
:{{text|say|Erisne's Burden|You were powerless before me. You are powerless now.}}
:{{text|say|Acolyte Erisne|I am... powerless...}}
:{{text|say|Erisne's Burden|You know the path forward. Let me in.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Lykaste|No! You must resist!}}

The memory enters Erisne and she falls:
:{{text|say|Fallen Acolyte Erisne|Long have I toiled in this temple. And for what?}}
:{{text|say|Fallen Acolyte Erisne|No more. I will walk this path no longer!}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Lykaste|Acolyte! No!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Disciple Lykaste|Erisne... why? Why did you not fight?}}
:{{text|say|Fallen Acolyte Erisne|Look around you, disciple. We are all destined to fall, eventually.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Lykaste|I refuse to believe that to be true. Go. Loyalty awaits you, acolyte.}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Lykaste|I must inform the Paragon. To lose an acolyte, at the end of their trials, no less...}}
:{{text|say|Disciple Lykaste|Thank you. And I am sorry.}}

Leaving the area, Pelagos chimes in:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Many have fallen recently. The Temple of Loyalty is trying their best to bring them back to the path.}}

===Finale===
Head southeast to find Eridia in her chamber:
:{{text|say|Eridia|It seems our new aspirant has done much to bolster you, Pelagos.}}
