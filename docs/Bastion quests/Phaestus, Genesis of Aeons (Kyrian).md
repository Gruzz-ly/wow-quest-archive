Collect Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons from [[Overseer Atticus]].
* [[Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons]] {{co|49.0|15.5|Bastion}}

==Description==
[[Sika]] reports the [[Forsworn]] are widespread. They not only took over production, but the rise as well!

They organize their armies from the cliffs, send word back to their leaders.

They've ransacked our shrine to the [[First Forgelite]] and took her hammer. My hammer!

Defeat their commander, retrieve Phaestus. You must go now!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Selfless Watcher's Wristwraps
|Selfless Bearer's Wrists
|Selfless Forgelite's Wristwraps
|Selfless Collector's Wristguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 11,800 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Progress==
Without Phaestus, we cannot work on the Crest.

==Completion==
Phaestus returns! Glorious day.

Many thanks, friend. This hammer has been passed down for eons! It belongs in my masterful hands.

==Notes==
Up the stairs to the northwest. Atticus is guarded by two [[Forsworn Overseer]]s, but they can be pulled separately.

Aggro:
