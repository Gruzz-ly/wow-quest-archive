==Description==
Now, let us see this next to my arm...

Look! There many long feathers along the edges of the Larion's wing!

And none on mine. This is why I can not fly!

Hmm. It will take lots of flight feathers to give me wings.

You help?

* 9,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Feathers... So many feathers...

==Completion==
Yes, these are enough feathers to make my arms into wings!

==Notes==
The feathers drop from any larions in Bastion.
