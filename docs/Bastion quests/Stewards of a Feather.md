==Objectives==
Free 5 Captured Forgehands.
* [[Captured Forgehand]]s rescued (5)

==Description==
You! [[Maw Walker]]!

The forge was bustling. Many forgehands, on task!

Then [[Forsworn]] came. Some followed their demands, turned to their side.

But not all! Yes, rescue forgehands so they can aid us. Work to be done!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I tried to save, but am no hero. Can only try to organize chaos.

==Completion==
You did it! Many forgehands return today. Maybe one day the rest return too?

We will help.

==Notes==
Pick up the other two quests before heading out.

Captured Forgehands are being held by [[Forsworn Overseer]]s or [[Praetorian Artificer]]s. Kill the hostiles and interact with the forgehand to free it. Neutral [[Darksworn Forgehand]]s are lost and cannot be redeemed.

On return:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|And another thing! Have you seen what they have done to my forge? The surrounding stairs are covered in soot, and the flame is precisely 3.5 degrees too hot!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|The forgehands return! Get operations up and running, there's work to do!}}

==Progression==
{{Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons}}
