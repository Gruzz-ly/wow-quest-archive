Complete the Crest of Ascension.

==Description==
The Crest is almost complete.

I give you the honor of the final touch.

You have done much. Please, take Phaestus and give the final blow!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Phalynx of Courage]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]
* {{cost|12|87|}}

==Progress==
Please care. Phaestus is older than you could dream!

==Completion==
Perfection!

It is beautiful, yes? Not done yet, but much work led to great reward.

==Notes==
Speak with Mikanikos again:
:You prepared for such honor? Wielding Phaestus is no small feat.
:{{gossip|I will take Phaestus.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Single blow. Use all the power you hold!}}

Run forward and interact with the Crest of Ascension to cast the final strike.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|On this day, we take a major step toward repairing the way of the kyrian.}}
:{{text|say|Xandria|This new Crest will make ascended even stronger than before!}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|We may need them. My watchers tell me Thenios's suspicions of Lysonia leading the Forsworn have come to pass.}}
:{{text|say|Vesiphone|And Uther as well, I am afraid.}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|I shall inform the Archon. Rest until we decide our next steps.}}
:{{text|say|Mikanikos|Come, Bron. We enjoy fruits of labor!}}
