[[File:Past Glory.jpg|thumb|[[Faerin Lothar]] and [[Danath Trollbane]] again staring at [[Thoradin's Wall]]]]

'''Past Glory''' concludes the [[Rise of the Red Dawn]] storyline as part of the [[Legacy of Arathor campaign]] added in [[patch 11.1.7]].

==Objectives==
Speak to Faerin at [[High Perch]].
* Speak to [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]]
* Listen to Faerin and [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]]

==Description==
[[Marran Trollbane|Marran's]] "[[Red Dawn]]" has left the city and peace has returned to [[Stromgarde]]. 

At least for now.

Faerin left for the countryside. She said she wanted to check on [[Newstead]] and [[Refuge Point]], but I think she wanted to get out of Stromgarde.

She came here with such enthusiasm. I should not have tempered it so harshly. And in the end, I feel in the end it was I who needed to learn a lesson.

We should check in on her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Lamplighter's Pauldrons]]
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* [[Rise of the Red Dawn (achievement)]]

==Progress==
<Faerin looks lost in thought as she again gazes at Thoradin's Wall.>

==Completion==
Danath is right. Legends are just legends. We shouldn't try to live in them, blinded by pride.

Instead, those legends should inspire us to make the world as we hope it should be.

Light willing, we will remember the past but work for a better future. For all of us.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|Go on ahead, <name>. Eitrigg and I have some diplomatic red tape to clean up, I'm sure.}}
:''They walk off.''

Find [[Faerin Lothar]] atop the [[High Perch]] watch tower staring at [[Thoradin's Wall]]:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|This is not how I expected my first visit outside [[Khaz Algar]] to go.}}

Speak with her:
{{dialogue|Perhaps I was too naive. This place isn't the shining testament to the history of my people as I thought it might be. It's the same as everywhere else--people struggling to survive.

Maybe Danath was right. Maybe there's nothing in those old stories but myth and superstition.

{{gossip|quest=|<Listen to Faerin.>}}}}
:''Danath walks up the stairs and sits on the ledge next to Faerin.''
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|I'm sorry Stromgarde was not what you expected.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|You were right. I was... naive.}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|No, Faerin. I was wrong.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Wrong? How?}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|I said Thoradin's Wall was just a wall.}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|But what it represents does exist--in you.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|I don't see...}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|You have been a guiding light.}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|Saving my life. Bringing us together. Reminding me of my true mission.}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|You look to the past. But you are our future. And I am glad of that.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Perhaps... perhaps the new dawn is not what Marran wanted...}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|But us, returning here for our people.}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|Hmm. I hope you are right.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|My mage can send you back to Dornogal. But... you'll always be welcome in Stromgarde, <name>.}}
:''A [[Stromgarde Mage]] opens a Portal to Dornogal.''

Faerin has gossip:
{{dialogue|I think I'll stay for a bit. Help Danath and Eitrigg clean up Marran's mess.

You'll be alright without me for a while, won't you?}}
