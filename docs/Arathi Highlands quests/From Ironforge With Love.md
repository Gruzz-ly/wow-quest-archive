==Objectives==
Collect 20 Stolen [[Ironforge]] Supplies from [[Red Dawn]] troops within [[Ar'gorok]].
* [[Stolen Ironforge Supplies]] (20)

==Description==
This "Red Dawn" is occupying the fortress of Ar'gorok. Bandits of all types and bands have taken refuge here under their banner.

And I'm sure they've brought their spoils with them.

It may help calm tensions if we recover the goods they've stolen and return them to their rightful owners in the [[Arathi Highlands]].

See if they are carrying anything with them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
More supplies? Good.

Hm. Looks like these were on their way from Ironforge to [[Stromgarde]].

From what [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] has told me, the Stromic will be very pleased that we found them.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both quests
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|[[Defias]], [[Syndicate]], [[Scarlet Crusade]], All human factions long thought destroyed or disbanded.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Overlord Geya'rah]]|Then it's past time we finished the job and put down the "Red Dawn."}}
:''The orcs head to [[Ar'gorok]]''

[[Stolen Ironforge Supplies]] include [[Bundle of Heavy Silk Bandages]], [[Cans of Loch Frenzy]], [[Pack of Heavy Armor Kits]], [[Packages of Blood Sausage]], and [[Skins of Dwarven Stout]].

Head to the Ar'gorok prison beneath the Barracks and meet up with Eitrigg and Overlord Geya'rah to turn in both quests as they found Danath in his cell.
:{{Text|Say|Danath Trollbane|Just...smash it open, Eitrigg!}}
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|If an orc prison couldn't withstand an orc, it wouldn't be worth much now would it, Danath?}}

Upon completing both quests, the [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] "Eitrigg Rescues Danath" plays:
:''Eitrigg walks to the cell door and begins to unlock it.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|They wouldn't kill me. Left me to rot. Cowards.}}
:''[[Eitrigg]] opens the cell door.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|How did you find me?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|The Red Dawn left orc weapons at the ambush to fool your people.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|But they did not fool us. We knew  the weapons came from [[Ar'gorok]].}}
:''Danath walks towards his sword and picks it up.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Geya'rah, Eitrigg--your honor humbles me. You didn't...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|No time to get sappy on us, Danath. We've seen what's coming.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|Faerin went to warn your people.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Then she is in grave danger!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Only someone in Stromgarde,... someone close to me... could have orchestrated the ambush.}}
:''Eitrigg grabs his axe.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|Then we must go to her aid.}}
