==Objectives==
Collect the Sigil of Arathor from [[Lieutenant Valorcall]].
* [[Sigil of Arathor]]

==Description==
I entrusted the sigil of [[Arathor]] to Lieutenant Valorcall, leader of my cavalry. He barely escaped with his life when it was taken.

It is unlikely he will do so again. Valorcall patrols the road between [[Stromgarde Keep]] and [[Refuge Point]]. Find him, and take the sigil from him once more.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||22}}

==Progress==
Have you the sigil?

==Completion==
Valorcall was loyal to me in life. His death will not be something I bear lightly.

But bear it I must. I am Forsaken. My old existence means nothing.

The sigils are ours; Trol'kalar awaits.

==Progression==
