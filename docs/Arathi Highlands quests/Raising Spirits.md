==Objectives==
Collect 10 Highland Raptor Eyes from [[Highland Strider]]s or [[Highland Thrasher]]s.
*[[Highland Raptor Eye]] (10)

==Description==
Our race's gift of [[shaman]]ism stirred me from a years-long lethargy. Now I provide for all here, crafting the same boons that gave me newfound strength.

The Highland raptors are cunning and fierce beasts. Their spirits can grant our warriors great strength. Bring me raptor eyes, so I may make the amulets as Tor'gan taught me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|2500}} (or {{coppercost|2040}} at max level)
*3400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|2040}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Orgrimmar}}

==Progress==
The fierceness in the eyes of the raptors will be matched by those of our warriors.

==Completion==
The lethargy that overcame me even after the camps fell was so strong, I refused this gift when it was first given to me.

Now, I am proud to do my part in the name of the Horde.
