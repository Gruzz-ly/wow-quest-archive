==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Shards of Myzrael]].

==Description==
Ancient stones are strewn across this land. The elements flock to them, surrounding them protectively.

These are sites of great power, and the largest is just west of [[Hammerfall]]. Not a soul trespasses, but if you go there alone, you can hear whispers from the earth itself.

I have not visited there in a long while... but our [[grunt]]s have told me the whispers have started again. Would you look for me? Will you see if the stones still speak?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The shards pulse softly, and a whisper slowly echoes through your head.>

Help...

==Progression==
{{The Princess Trapped}}
