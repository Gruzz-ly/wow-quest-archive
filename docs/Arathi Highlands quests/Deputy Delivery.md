==Objectives==
Deliver [[Captain Roderick Brewston|Brewston]]'s request writs to people in [[Stromgarde Keep|Stromgarde]].
* Brewston's requests delivered (5)

==Description==
Trade in Stromgarde has broken down. We're short on goods and workers because of the attacks.

[[Veronica Nials|Nials]] was too busy, so I took it upon myself to write official requests for aid.

Most are simple and straightforward--writs for supplies and such for the Stromic army.

The desist writ for [[Joseph the Awakened|Joseph]] is different. He is loudly blaming everyone not human for our woes. Someone needs to officially tell him to shut his yap before he starts a riot.

As my deputies, would you enforce my requests for aid?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I know some won't be happy with what we're requesting of them, but it's what's best for Stromgarde and its people.

==Completion==
You have my thanks and the thanks of Stromgarde.

I'm sorry you got an earful from Joseph--at least he left peacefully!

Despite how it may seem, the city is still loyal to Lord Trollbane. Mostly.

Lady Marran's followers are just louder. And angrier.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Alliance}} {{text|say|Captain Roderick Brewston|Obliged for your help. But keep your eyes open. There are... agitators about.}}
:{{Horde}} {{text|say|Captain Roderick Brewston|A word of warning: you may be deputized, but for some people here, the Horde is unwelcome.}}
:{{text|say|[[Danath Trollbane]]|Apologies for putting you to work. We will speak again after I have briefed Nials and Brewston.}}
:''Danath, Nials, and Brewston head inside of [[Stromgarde Keep]].''

[[Faerin Lothar]] joins the party. The player character has Brewston's Deputies buff.

Find [[Balinda Darkstone]] at {{co|20.6|62.6|Arathi Highlands||1}} by just inside the forge:
:{{Text|Say|Balinda Darkstone|Maybe it's time to pack up and leave Stromgarde.}}

Speak with her:
{{Alliance}}{{Dialogue|Those Marran flunkies... They're makin' it harder an' harder for anyone who isn't human to live here in Stromgarde.

Did ye see how they were crowdin' around me an [[Godrey Redbeard|Godrey]]? Shameless. An' nae respect for the law at all.

But that's nae your problem. 

I see the shiny deputy badges ye both got there. What, Nials and Brewston too busy takin' a nap tae come an' help us or ask for a favor?

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's writ for armor repairs.>}}
}}
{{Horde}}{{Dialogue|<Balinda's eyes go wide as you approach and flash your deputy badge.>

Well, I'm more than surprised tae see anyone Horde 'round here. Much less an officially-sanctioned <race>!

It's gettin' more hostile for those of us who aren't human, Horde or not. Many have left Stromgarde. 

There's been vandalism and even attacks. Ye saw how those Marran flunkies were lookin' at Godrey an' me.

Why, just last week one o' the elven herbalists left. Someone poisoned 'er peacebloom garden!

Stromgarde is barely hanging on an' our neighbors think we're the problem. An' they've got you out here tryin' to solve it, aye?

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's writ for armor repairs.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Balinda Darkstone|Our last shipment o' iron was stolen by bandits, but I'll do what I can.}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|We could try to recover those shipments. I will speak to Danath.}}

She has new gossip after:
{{dialogue|I need tae get started on those repairs.}}

[[Joseph the Enlightened]] is at {{co|22.0|65.1|Arathi Highlands||1}} on the steps of the altar to in the southeast speaking to a group of [[Marran Sympathizer]]s:
:{{Text|say|Joseph the Enlightened|Marran, true heir of the Trollbanes, will deliver us from the Horde. She will be Stromgarde's salvation!}}

Speak with him:
{{Alliance}}{{Dialogue|<Joseph points to you and addresses the crowd.>

Hark! Look at the creatures Danath allows into your city! A traitorous <race>! They are here to steal your resources to fund their imperialism!

These so called friends of the treacherous Alliance travel to exploit newfound lands while we suffer and starve! They send our grain to gnomes, elves, and draenei! 

And when we need help, where are they? What have they done for Stromgarde?

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's writ to desist his inflammatory speech under penalty of arrest.>}}
}}
{{Race|Human}}{{Race|Worgen}}{{Race|Kul Tiran}}{{Dialogue|<Joseph speaks to you and the crowd at the same time.>

Fellow traveler, fellow human, join us! Stand together with us and proclaim Lady Marran Trollbane as the rightful ruler of Stromgarde, the birthplace of Arathor!

Before her unjust imprisonment, we prospered under Marran's rule! The starving were fed. Our defenses were strong! We nearly drove the orcs from our lands--but then Lord Danath Trollbane returned, taking our troops and kneeling before the Alliance.

He betrayed us!

Free Marran so she may lead the human race to glory once again. A new dawn is approaching! A new dawn for all humans!

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's writ to desist his inflammatory speech under penalty of arrest.>}}
}}

{{Horde}}{{Dialogue|<Joseph points to you and addresses the crowd.>

And lo, what slouches towards us? Look at the creatures Lord Danath Trollbane allows into your city! A filthy <race>! They are a sign. A sign of the doom of the Arathi dynasty. Of Stromgarde!

These barbarians of the Horde--tauren, trolls, the undead! They exist only to kill and conquer! 

The orcs are the worst of all! They are not even of this world yet claim territories on it. Territories they have waged war on us to keep! They have destroyed our kingdoms, and they will again--from Ar'gorok to Hammerfall, where our "Lord" lets them perch like vultures, waiting for us to be weak. They hope to take your homeland, humanity's homeland, for themselves!

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's writ to desist his inflammatory speech under penalty of arrest.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Yell|Joseph the Enlightened|What's this? Danath Trollbane's minions threatening me for speaking the truth? Is this justice? Is this righteous?}}
:{{Text|Yell|Joseph the Enlightened|I will comply--for now. But a new dawn is approaching for all humanity! Be ready my friends!}}
:''Joseph takes his leave.''

[[Bertram Barleybeard]], the dwarven Alliance ambassador, is at {{co|19.9|66.5|Arathi Highlands||1}} inside the town hall:
:{{Text|Say|Bertram Barleybeard|That's three caravans to date that have nae made it to Stromgarde.}}

Speak with him:
{{Alliance}}{{Dialogue|The Alliance has heard the requests from Stromgarde, an' we are doin' what we can. We've been sendin' caravans of food and supplies from [[Khaz Modan]], but they keep gettin' attacked en route.

We cannae spare more troops to protect the convoys. We need what we have in [[Khaz Algar]]. We're still tied up tryin' tae find an' defeat [[Xal'atath]], not to mention aidin' the survivors of [[Dalaran]] an' our new allies.

I wish we could do more, but we're stretched thin as it is!

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's request for aid from the Alliance.>}}
}}
{{Horde}}{{Dialogue|<Bertram is taken aback by your presence, then narrows his eyes suspiciously at your deputy badge specifically.>

Times must be desperate indeed if Brewston has a <race> workin' for him. Is the Horde responsible for the destruction of my caravans then? No? 

Well, what do ye want from me?

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's request for aid from the Alliance.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Bertram Barleybeard|Tell Brewston we're already doin' everythin' we can to help.}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|Confronting Xal'atath left no one to protect Stromgarde. No wonder these people feel neglected.}}

Afterwards, he has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Please excuse me. I have work to do.}}

[[Luma Noss]], who runs Food and Drink, is at {{co|14.4|70.1|Arathi Highlands||1}} in the tavern to the southwest:
:{{Text|Say|Luma Noss|If this keeps up, we're going to have to start rationing.}}

Speak with her:
{{Alliance}}{{Dialogue|Are you here with a delivery? 

With the poor harvest, and all the thieving, basic foodstuffs have been hard to come by. We haven't received any outside aid either.

If we don't get help soon, we're going to starve. Why doesn't the Alliance help us?

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's request for army rations.>}}
}}
{{Horde}}{{Dialogue|<Luma rubs her eyes as if she can't believe what she's seeing: a <race> with a deputy badge.>

Are you here to deliver food? Please say you are. Because at this point I don't care if I have to join the Horde, as long as I know I'll have a good meal.

With all the thieving and a bad harvest to boot, proper vittles are hard to come by here.

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's request for army rations.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Luma Noss|I should have known! You just want to take and take and leave the rest of us nothing.}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|Brewston would not ask if he were not desperate. Please, whatever you can part with.}}

Afterwards:
{{dialogue|If Brewston wants food, tell him he can walk all the way to Stormwind to get it!}}

[[Amy Hardy]] is outside to the northwest {{co|12.0|68.0|Arathi Highlands||1}} running the Tailoring Supplies tent:

:{{Text|Say|Amy Hardy|People keep saying the attacks are just bandits. But I think the Horde is behind it.}}

Speak with her:
{{Alliance}}{{Dialogue|You're not from here...

Are you from the Alliance? Are you here to help us with these orcs?

<Amy sees your deputy badges and rolls her eyes.>

Ugh, Brewston... He's got the spine of a water elemental. Sending his deputies to do his lord and master's bidding!

What does that useless man want now?

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's request for bandages.>}}
}}
{{Horde}}{{Dialogue|<Amy's eyes grow wide when she spots you. When you flash your deputy badge, she recoils in disgust.>

What do you want, you filthy <race?> I've got my eye on you!

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over Brewston's request for bandages.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Amy Hardy|Bandages? If Lord Danath would stop talking to orcs and start killing them, we wouldn't need bandages!}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|The orcs are not your enemy. Lord Trollbane is doing what he can to keep you safe.}}

Afterwards:
{{dialogue|Get out of my sight! The dawn is coming!}}

Head to the Stromgarde Barracks to turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|The people are scared of Marran's gangs. If we reassigned...}}
:{{Text|Say|Colonel Veronica Nials|No, Captain. You know we don't have the manpower for that.}}

They both new have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Colonel Veronica Nials|[[Faerin Lothar]]. I never expected to meet a Lothar after Sir [[Anduin Lothar]] fell at [[Blackrock Spire]].

The Lothar bloodline is descended from [[King Thoradin]] himself, founder of the Empire of Arathor.

Faerin may not think much of her surname, but to people on this side of the world she could be considered royalty.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Captain Roderick Brewston|The city is a powder keg waiting to go off.

Lady Marran's supporters are growing day by day because of the attacks in the Highlands... Her people harass not just the commonfolk who follow Lord Danath, but also anyone who isn't human. And now these "Red Dawn" people Lord Danath just told us about...

Between our deployment to Khaz Algar, combat losses, desertion, and attacks in the Highlands, we just don't have the resources to police the city right now.}}
