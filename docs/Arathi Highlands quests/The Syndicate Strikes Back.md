==Objectives==
Meet [[Overlord Geya'rah]] at [[Hammerfall]].

==Description==
This human is claiming the [[Syndicate]] scum are going to attack Hammerfall! Another day I would not be concerned. But with the outriders dealing with [[Witherbark tribe|the Witherbark]] and searching for [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]], Hammerfall is undefended!

Let's go <name>. We must defend our home!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I should have been here. I could have done something.

<White-hot fury and rage emanate from Geya'rah's tense posture and tightly-closed fists.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Overlord Geya'rah|You've proven truthful, [[Barclay|human]]. Now, out of our way. We must warn Hammerfall.}}
:''Overlord Geya'rah and [[Faerin Lothar]] get on their mounts''
:{{Text|Say|Barclay|You don't have to tell us twice!}}
:''Faerin and Geya'rah head to Hammerfall as Barclay, [[Perry]], [[Holt]], and [[Crestor]] flee. The [[Hammerfall Outrider]]s follow Faerin and Geya'rah.''

Head to Hammerfall where [[Eitrigg]] is rallying defenders.
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|Geya'rah! <Name>! Faerin! Then Hammerfall is not lost. We will retake it ourselves!}}
