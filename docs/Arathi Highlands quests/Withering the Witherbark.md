==Objectives==
Slay 15 [[Witherbark tribe|Witherbark trolls]] at [[Witherbark Village]].
* Witherbark troll slain (15)

==Description==
The Witherbark have always been an annoyance since I have been here. But now?

Something has stoked their ire. They are attacking human settlements. Perhaps the [[Red Dawn]] is again to blame.

[[Eitrigg]] has ordered us to try to help the humans they attack. We have stepped up our patrols and welcomed refugees. 

But we need someone to go to their village and bloody the Witherbark's noses. They're overconfident. They think they can get away with attacking our outriders!

Make them think twice about that.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
They might outnumber us, but the Mag'har are worth four of them in battle!

==Completion==
Feh.

That will surely cow them. I'd be surprised if I saw any of them stray from their village any time soon.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Text|Say|[[Faerin Lothar]]|The Witherbark? As in the Amani Witherbark? The Arathi's ancient foe...}}
:''Faerin mounts on her horse.''
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|Come, <name>. I will need your help.}}
:''Faerin rides off.''

Head southeast to [[Witherbark Village]] and slay [[Witherbark Axe Thrower|Witherbark axe throwers]], [[Witherbark Bonebreaker|bonebreakers]], [[Witherbark Fisher|fishers]], [[Witherbark Headhunter|headhunters]], [[Witherbark Raider|raiders]], [[Witherbark Shadow Hunter|shadow hunters]], and [[Witherbark Witch Doctor|witch doctors]].

Return to [[Go'Shek Farm]], where Overlord Geya'rah is threatening Barclay. The other Syndicate members have returned as well:
:{{Text|Say|Overlord Geya'rah|If you are lying to me, human... this day will be your last!}}
:{{Text|Say|Barclay|I'm not, I'm--I swear! The Syndicate is on their way to attack Hammerfall--for the Red Dawn!}}

==Progression==
{{Rise of the Red Dawn}}
