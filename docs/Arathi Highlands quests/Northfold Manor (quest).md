==Objectives==
Kill 10 Syndicate members at [[Northfold Manor]].
* [[Syndicate Mercenary]] slain (10)

==Description==
We are fighting a war for [[Stromgarde (kingdom)|Stromgarde]], and we are losing. The [[ogre]]s, the [[Syndicate]] and we have divided our once great city, and each faction battles the other into a bloody stalemate.

But our forces dwindle while our enemy grows.

Though [[Southshore]] has fallen, we must not let any further ground be yielded to our enemies.

Go to the Syndicate base in [[Northfold Manor]] and slay them. We must reclaim the land for ourselves before the Horde has a chance to creep further.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||20}}

==Progress==
This is vital to the survival of Stromgarde, <name>.  Do not waste time.

==Completion==
Very good, <name>.  The last thing we need with the undead looming is a gang of common thieves distracting us.

==Notes==
[[Syndicate Highwayman|Syndicate Highwaymen]] and [[Syndicate Pathstalker]]s also count.

==Progression==
{{Refuge Pointe}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing the previous version.}}
