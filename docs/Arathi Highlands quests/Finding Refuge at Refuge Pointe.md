==Objectives==
Look for [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] at [[Refuge Pointe]] in the [[Arathi Highlands]].
* Meet Faerin at Refuge Pointe {{co|38.0|52.2|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* [[Familiar Emblem|Search the body for clues]]
* Follow Faerin up the hill {{co|40.8|53.6|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* Speak to Karga

==Description==
If you want to find Lord Trollbane and tell him your theory about [[Marran Trollbane|Lady Marran]], the missive called him to [[Hammerfall]], far to the east of here.

He may have stopped at Refuge Pointe on the way--it's a Stromic encampment about halfway to the [[orc]] town. Because of the frequent [[bandit]] attacks in the area, I believe he meant to stop and check in with our people there.

You might catch up with him there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's good to see [[human]]s and orcs banding together to help one another.

If only the Arathi here could have seen what I did at [[Khaz Algar]].

==Completion==
Another bandit attack? And they carry the same emblem as the bandits at [[Newstead]]?

If this is connected to the [[Red Dawn]] and Marran...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Captain Roderick Brewston]]|If you leave now, you might catch up with Lord Trollbane at Refuge Point. But... watch out for bandits!}}
:''Faerin salutes and runs off.''

Head to [[Refuge Point]] in the middle of the zone. Catch up with Faerin at the south entrance, where she is kneeling over the corpse of an [[Unknown Soldier (Arathi Highlands)|Unknown Soldier]]. Two dead [[Refuge Pointe Defender]]s and a [[Refuge Point Civilian]] lie just downhill.
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Over here, <name>! Come look.}}

Interact with the Unknown Soldier:
{{dialogue|<The bandit is wearing red and white, but their garments do not resemble any of Stromgarde's military uniforms.

A quick search of the uniform's pockets reveals a familiar-looking emblem. This is the same emblem you collected from the Defias at [[Newstead|Newstead Farm]].

Around the body are several sets of tracks that head eastward. One set of footprints is bigger and bulkier than the others.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Collect the emblem.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Whomever they attacked got away but may need help... Let's follow their tracks!}}

The soldier's corpse has new gossip after:
{{dialogue|<The bandit is wearing red and white, but their garments do not resemble any of Stromgarde's military uniforms.

Around the body are several sets of tracks that head eastward. One set of footprints is bigger and bulkier than the others.>}}

Follow Faerin uphill to the east, where she is in a surrender position before [[Karga Bloodfury]]. [[Vikki Lonsav]], the innkeeper is in position behind the cart with a shotgun at the ready. Another dead Unknown Soldier is on the ground nearby.
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|We mean you no harm.}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|You expect me to take your word?}}

Speak with Karga:
{{Alliance}}{{dialogue|If you wish to earn my trust, <race>, you will explain yourself--quickly.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain the situation and ask what happened here.>}}}}
{{Horde}}{{dialogue|Strength and honor, friend. I did not expect to see anyone else from the [[Horde]] this far into the Highlands.

Why have you come?

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain the situation and ask what happened here.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|Hm. Refuge Point was attacked as well. I saw it burning and rode in to help.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Red Dawn emblems here and at Newstead...  I wonder if they were at Refuge Point as well?}}

Characters have new gossip after:
{{dialogue|title=Karga Bloodfist|Horde outposts--like Hammerfall--have suffered attacks from both bandits and trolls in recent weeks. 

Our outriders are on constant patrol. But now that I know the Alliance has been targeted as well...

You have confirmed what I already suspected.

Something bigger is coming. Perhaps it is related to this "Red Dawn."}}

{{dialogue|title=Vikki Lonsav|I've heard stories about the orcs helping out human farmers but didn't believe them until now.

We've heard so much from Stromgarde about how the Horde are to blame for many of our problems.

<Vikki looks at Karga with a mix of fear and wonder before turning back to you.>

We may have had our share of conflict in the past, but the Horde isn't the problem today.}}

{{dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|Brewston warned us about how rough it was out here, but I didn't expect things to be so bad.

These bandits are attacking in force, overwhelming the few defenders these places have, and completely destroying these people's lives.

{{Dialogue|
{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:''Faerin walks over the corpse of an Unknown Soldier and kneels down to inspect it.''

:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Karga, do you know much about the [[Scarlet Crusade]]?}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|Only what I have heard from the elders in Hammerfall.}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|I know they have no love for the Horde--or the [[Alliance]].}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|The Scarlet Crusade holds twisted beliefs. They want to eradicate our allies, the undead.}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|But they also believe that the Alliance has failed to protect humanity.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The belief in human superiority seems... prevalent here.}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|Feh. This is the Arathi Highlands. Where have you been? Under a rock?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|You could say that, yes.}}
