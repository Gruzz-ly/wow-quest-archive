==Objectives==
Bring Otto's Head and Falconcrest's Head to [[Captain Nials]] at Refuge Pointe. 
*[[Otto's Head]]
*[[Falconcrest's Head]]

==Description==
The [[Stromgarde Militia]] has placed bounties on the heads of Lord Falconcrest, and his bodyguard Otto. Falconcrest heads the [[Syndicate]]'s efforts in the [[Arathi Highlands]], and his death would cause a major disruption in those efforts.

His bodyguard Otto, although not a strategic target, is a fierce opponent and has killed dozens of our defenders.

Their bounties may be collected from Captain Nials.

==Progress==
Hello.  Do you have a report to submit? 

==Completion==
Falconcrest and Otto?  Wonderful!

Here is your reward, <name>.  I am happy to pay it. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stromgarde Badges]] from [[Captain Nials]] and [[Wanted! Marez Cowl]] off the Wanted Board before leaving camp. 

Otto and Falconcrest are inside the Keep at the back of Stromgarde, straight down the road from Stromgarde's entrance. They are on the upper floor. Kill Syndicate members along the way and collect badges. To get to Marez Cowl, go into Stromgarde from the entrance and take the first left. Go to the back and around to the right, killing the Syndicate members and looting badges if any are still needed. Marez Cowl is behind the building at the dead end, not inside.
