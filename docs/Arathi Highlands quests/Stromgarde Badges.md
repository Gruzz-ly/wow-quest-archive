==Objectives==
Collect 7 Stromgarde Badges from [[Syndicate]] enemies in [[Stromgarde Keep]]. 
*[[Stromgarde Badge]] (7)

==Description==
The [[Syndicate]] in [[Stromgarde Keep|Stromgarde]] do battle with our contingent of [[Stromgarde Militia|militia]] there. In order to urge the rabble to fight our more disciplined troops, the Syndicate leaders have placed a bounty on our soldiers, awarding gold for each Stromgarde Badge gathered off killed militiamen.

We want those badges retrieved - we cannot allow the cutthroats to take trophies from our brave fallen!

Enter the Syndicate-controlled area of Stromgarde and hunt them for our badges. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Slippers of Sorrowful Tidings
|Yellow Ribbon Armbands
|Griefstricken Gloves
|Heartsick Breastplate
|Bindings of Longing
|Grips of the Weary
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved any Stromgarde Badges, <name>?  The Syndicate must learn they cannot profit from our dead. 

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.  We will inform the families of these fallen soldiers that they were killed in battle.

It will be grim news to bear, but it is better than the uncertainty of a missing loved one. 

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Wanted! Otto and Falconcrest]] and [[Wanted! Marez Cowl]] off the Wanted Board before leaving camp. 

To get to Marez Cowl, go into Stromgarde and take the first left. Go to the back and around to the right, killing the Syndicate members and looting badges. Marez Cowl is behind the building at the dead end, not inside. Otto and Falconcrest are inside the Keep at the back of Stromgarde, straight down the road from Stromgarde's entrance. They are on the upper floor. Kill Syndicate members along the way and collect badges if any are still needed.
