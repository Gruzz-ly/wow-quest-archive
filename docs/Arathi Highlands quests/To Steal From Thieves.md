{{questportrait|Kenata Dabyrie.jpg|Kenata Dabyrie|She will pay with her head!}}
==Objectives==
Take the heads of [[Kenata Dabyrie]], [[Fardel Dabyrie]], and [[Marcel Dabyrie]]. 
*[[Kenata's Head]]
*[[Fardel's Head]]
*[[Marcel's Head]]

==Description==
The harlot! The swine! Kenata still lives; her family healthy and prospering while I suffer. [[Forsaken]] indeed!

My family is gone, taken by the plague. Our estate also forfeit; looted and burned during the war. And after all that, she and her lousy children had the audacity to steal the only precious belongings I had left.

I don't care about the things they stole any more. What I want now are their heads!

Kill them for me! Go to the [[Dabyrie's Farmstead|Dabyrie Farmstead]] in [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]], northeast of [[Refuge Point]]. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Craig's Steel
|Grim Mace
|Genavie's Leggings
|Adulterous Belt
|Treads of Unforgotten Pain
|Cheater's Cinch
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

{{Classic only-section|patch=4.0.3a}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Grim Pauldrons
|Gallan Cuffs
}}

==Progress==
Kill them all and bring me their heads! 

==Completion==
You stand before me as a figure of vengeance, and I bow down before you in thanks.

With that cow's death, and knowing that their seed will no longer spread over the face of [[Azeroth]], I can put my energy into something more lucrative. I hope you looted their farmstead after you finished them off.
