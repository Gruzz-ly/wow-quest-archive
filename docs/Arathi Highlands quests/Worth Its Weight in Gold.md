==Description==
[[Archmage Malin]] sent me here to collect reagents for him. I was at a loss as to how I was going to collect the items, but now that you're here, I think my problem's solved.

I need Witherbark tusks and Witherbark medicine pouches.

Could you find those for me? The Witherbark live to the southeast of [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]].
