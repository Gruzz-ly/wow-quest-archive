==Objectives==
Collect 4 Supply Crates from [[Refuge Pointe]].
* Supply Crates collected (4)

==Description==
[[Stromgarde]]'s troops are in [[Khaz Algar]] and it cannot protect its outlying settlements. 

[[Hammerfall]] does what it can to help, but we too fight in Khaz Algar.

We've taken many injured Stromic refugees to Hammerfall, but feeding them all has strained our resources.

But there may be a way to help more people.

[[Vikki Lonsav|Vikki]] told me Refuge Pointe is a supply depot for nearby settlements. If we can get our hands on some supplies, we can care for more refugees in Hammerfall.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Contrary to what some in Stromgarde says, the [[Mag'har Clans|Mag'har]] are not here to conquer.

We simply want peace and a place to call home.

==Completion==
Good, <name>. 

I hope Stromgarde does not mind us "borrowing" these supplies for their refugees.

Heh.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|These [[bandit]]s... did they call themselves "[[Defias]]?" Did they mention the "[[Red Dawn]]?"}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|I did not give any time to speak. They killed everyone not human and took all but who I could drag away.}}

Supply Crates are all over the valley of Refuge Pointe, guarded by [[Scarlet Confessor (Arathi Highlands)|Scarlet confessors]], [[Scarlet Dawnbringer|dawnbringers]], [[Scarlet Houndmaster|houndmaster]]s, and [[Scarlet Warhound|warhound]]s.

Collect four crates, finish off [[Joseph the Enlightened]], then check back in. On return:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|You're saying Danath was never called to Hammerfall?}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|On my life, Geya'rah said nothing of it.}}

==Progression==
{{Rise of the Red Dawn}}
