==Objectives==
Bring the Unfamiliar Emblem to [[Danath Trollbane]] at [[Newstead]] Farm.
*[[Unfamiliar Emblem]] (provided)

==Description==
<This [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] [[bandit]] was carrying a badge with an unfamiliar emblem.

The emblem looks like a rising sun with long rays emanating from it. The sun and rays are colored red.

Perhaps Danath can identify it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I don't recognize this emblem. And a Defias had it on their person?

Hm. Curious.

<Danath turns it over in his battle-scarred hand, frowning.>

I wonder what it means?

==Notes==
While in the area for [[Torches and Tar]] and [[Finding Family]], loot the Unfamiliar Emblem from any Defias enemy in the area.

Once done with the other quests, turn it over to Danath.
