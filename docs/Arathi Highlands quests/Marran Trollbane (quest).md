==Objectives==
Observe the meeting between [[Faerin Lothar]] and [[Marran Trollbane]] in the barracks of [[Stromgarde Keep]].
*Follow Colonel Nials downstairs
*Speak to [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] {{co|17.7|60.2|Arathi Highlands||1}}
*Listen to the conversation

==Description==
I am Colonel Veronica Nials, and I am in command of Stromgarde in [[Danath Trollbane|Lord Trollbane]]'s absence.

I'm sure while aiding our people you've heard the name "Marran" in Stromgarde. Lady Marran Trollbane is Danath's niece. She was briefly regent while Lord Danath Trollbane campaigned for troops for [[Khaz Algar]].

Her actions during his absence led him to imprison her when he returned.

That said, Lord Trollbane felt Faerin should speak to her. Perhaps to get... perspective. I can take you to her if you wish.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Marran may be in prison now, but her supporters continue to spread her rhetoric across the Highlands.

Whatever she may say, I do not believe that she is the leader of this "Red Dawn" that you both are speaking of.

I see who comes and goes. She receives no outside visitors.

==Notes==
On accept, follow Nials and Faerin downstairs:
:{{Text|Say|Colonel Veronica Nials|He would have introduced Marran himself, but [[Geya'rah]] summoned him urgently to [[Hammerfall]]. Come with me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|Strange that Danath would leave without us... and want us to talk to his estranged niece.}}

Marran has gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Marran smirks at you.>

Ah, a <race>. I would say "welcome to Stromgarde" but I am fairly certain my people do not appreciate your presence.

Your kind is not welcome here, <race>. Best to return from whence you came before an unexpected misfortune befalls you. 

We would hate to see that, wouldn't we?}}

To human characters she says:
{{Dialogue|Welcome to Stromgarde. I am Marran Trollbane.

Forgive me--I would extend my hospitality, but...

<She motions to the bars of her cell.>

As you've no doubt seen, Danath is destroying Stromgarde. I made preparations to save my country, but my foolish uncle... disagreed with my views.

But the people understand. Once they demand my freedom and I am released, I will expel the bandits, protect the people, and return Stromgarde to the glory that is our birthright!

You are welcome to join me friend.}}

Speak with Faerin:
{{Dialogue|So this is Marran, the root of so many of Stromgarde's troubles.

But what would Danath want us to learn from her?

I suppose he wants to see what she sees. How the ideal of the Arathi has been corrupted.

But surely he knows I am aware of how fervor--for anything--has a dark side.

<Faerin furrows her brow.>

Something seems wrong here.

:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|You are a prisoner. Why does Colonel Nials defer to you?}}
:{{Text|Say|Marran Trollbane|You should know names carry weight, Faerin Lothar.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marran Trollbane|Despite your... elven blood, a great Arathi warrior returning gives us hope.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marran Trollbane|That those dissatisfied with Lord Danath Trollbane's rule...}}
:{{Text|Say|Marran Trollbane|With our old Stromic ways forgotten, with famine, unrest, and orcs on our lands, and dwarves and elves in our cities.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marran Trollbane|All will rise up and embrace a "new dawn."}}
:{{Text|Say|Marran Trollbane|And that when they do, I hope you'll be a part of it, Faerin.}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|I would like to see Stromgarde as it was. But your promises are empty. And I would never betray Danath.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marran Trollbane|You say that now. But you'll see it my way. In time.}}
:''Faerin and Nials return upstairs.''

Follow them back upstairs:
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|Colonel, she all but told me she was involved with the Red Dawn!}}

Faerin has gossip:
{{Dialogue|The legendary Strom, the glorious capital of the Empire of Arathor, and the birthplace of my people.

<Faerin shakes her head.>

This is not at all what I imagined. There are no shining towers or glorious citadels.

There are just poor and desperate people who need help. Our help.}}

Upon completion, [[Captain Roderick Brewston]] has gossip:
{{Dialogue|The city is a powder keg waiting to go off.

Lady Marran's supporters are growing day by day because of the attacks in the Highlands... Her people harass not just the commonfolk who follow Lord Danath, but also anyone who isn't human. And now these "Red Dawn" people Lord Danath just told us about...

Between our deployment to Khaz Algar, combat losses, desertion, and attacks in the Highlands, we just don't have the resources to police the city right now.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}

:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|The people who attacked [[Newstead]] called themselves "[[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]]." Who are they?}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|Defias? Hm. I... haven't heard that name in awhile. Their story is a little sad, actually.}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|What do you mean? What happened?}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|After the [[Second War]], [[Stormwind]] was heavily damaged.}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|The [[Stonemasons Guild|Stonemason's Guild]] was contracted to rebuild it, but Stormwind's corrupt [[House of Nobles]] denied them payment.}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|They rioted. And in the riot, [[Tiffin Ellerian Wrynn|the queen]] was accidentally struck and killed.}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|They were driven from the city and became [[bandit]]s. The VanCleef family became their leaders.}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|I had thought that the Defias were dead along with the VanCleefs, but.... that may have been wishful thinking.}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|I don't condone banditry... but I can understand their frustration.}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|I suppose. If they'd been paid, they wouldn't have become bandits.}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|But you can't just throw away law and order if you don't get your way--like Marran's supporters are doing now.}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|That... is a good point. Hmm. Thank you, Captain.}}
