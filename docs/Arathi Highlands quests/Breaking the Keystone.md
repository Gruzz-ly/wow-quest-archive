==Objectives==
Obtain the Rod of Order from [[Fozruk]].
*[[Rod of Order]]

==Description==
Opening the Stones of Binding loosened much of my confinement, but a lock still holds me chained. It is the [[Keystone (Arathi Highlands)|Keystone]] you see among this circle of stones. And the key is held by one of my captors, the stone watcher Fozruk.

You must obtain that key, which the [[stone watcher]]s call the Rod of Order, from Fozruk and use it to open the Keystone.

<Name>, you have done so much to aid me. Just a little more...and my gratitude will shake the very foundations of the earth!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Keystone is charged with tremendous geomantic energy.

==Completion==
You place the rod in the keystone.  And a shudder is felt beneath you...

==Notes==
Turning in this quest spawns a level 29 creature named [[Thenan]]. Make sure to clear the area of enemies before turning it in.
