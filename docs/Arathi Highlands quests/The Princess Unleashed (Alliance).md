==Objectives==
Summon and defeat [[Myzrael]] at the [[Shards of Myzrael]].
*[[Eldritch Shackles]]
*Suggested players: 2
*[[Scroll of Myzrael]] (provided)

==Description==
Myzrael's no innocent princess. She's a terribly dangerous force, and the giants had every reason to chain her down there. I'm afraid you've been had.

According to [[Gerrig Bonegrip|Gerrig]], you have to summon her at the Shards of Myzrael where you first spoke with her. Defeat her and gather her Eldritch Shackles, then bind them to the Shards.

Here's the scroll you'll need. Be careful with it; I risked a few teeth to get it. Good luck, <name>. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wrap of Open Menace
|Eldritch Gloves
|Earthbound Mantle
|Shackling Gloves
|Mantle of the Bound
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Shards of Myzrael are now strangely quiet. 

==Completion==
As the eldritch shackles are placed around the Shards, an unhuman wail is heard from far below.  The scream is followed by a roar.

The Shards of Myzrael no longer invoke feelings of warmth and security as they once did.  Now they pulse with an open menace... as if the thing beneath them holds ill will toward the surface. 

==Progression==
{{The Princess Trapped}}
