==Objectives==
Meet [[Eitrigg]] at [[Ar'gorok]].

==Description==
If [[Danath Trollbane|Danath's]] kidnappers want to keep him from prying eyes, Ar'gorok is the perfect place. 

It's been abandoned for years, but its buildings still stand. All the "[[Red Dawn]]" could be there and no one would be the wiser.

We must find Danath quickly, <name>. [[Hammerfall]] is vulnerable and tensions are high. A missing leader is just the excuse [[Marran Trollbane|Marran]] needs to start a war.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I believe we've found where the Red Dawn were hiding.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|I will inform [[Stromgarde]] and ask for their help in the search. With luck, I can forestall any aggression.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|We will head to [[Ar'gorok]]. If Danath is there, then this conflict ends before it starts.}}
:''They mount up and take off.''

Head to [[Ar'gorok]] where Eitrigg is waiting.
:{{Text|Say|Looks like we're in the right place.}}

{{Rise of the Red Dawn}}
