==Objectives==
Report to Foreman Tully, Lumbering Leo, and Grayson Bell.
* Check on [[Foreman Tully]] {{co|27.5|57.0|Arathi Highlands}}
* Check on [[Lumbering Leo]] {{co|12.0|52.1|Arathi Highlands}}
* View the battleground with [[Grayson Bell]] {{co|18.3|67.9|Arathi Highlands}}

==Description==
The [[Horde]] haven't attacked for a while now. Neither have we, honestly. It should be safe to head on out and do some scouting.

Check in with our foremen at the mine and the lumber mill. It'd be good to know that they haven't off and gotten themselves killed, and the trip should give you a bit of a lay of the land.

Speaking of which, you might also talk to Grayson Bell, the [[flight master]], who can give you a quick look at our enemy's base. "[[Ar'gorok]]," or some other such orcish nonsense.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Cheers!

==Completion==
Nobody's been slaughtered by the Horde, then? Excellent.

Glad you could make it back safely too, <name>.

==Notes==
Don't forget that flying is possible in [[Arathi Highlands]]!

Tully is in [[Galson's Lode]], outside to the northeast:
{{Dialogue|
<Name>, was it? Tully.

<Foreman Tully extends a calloused hand.>

Nothing to report here. The Horde continue to be a thorn in our side, and the [[kobold]]s continue to be... annoying, but it's nothing we can't handle.

{{gossip|Thank you.}}
}}

Leo is far to the west at the [[Highlands Mill]]:
{{Dialogue|
Welcome to Highlands Mill, the source of all of Stromgarde's lumber.

The forests have been quiet today. One of the peasants had a bit of a tussle with a bear, but that's nothing new. You know how it is with peasants.

{{gossip|Thank you.}}

Grayson Bell:
{{Dialogue|
Hello.

{{gossip|[[Captain Roderick Brewston|Captain Brewston]] said you could give me a tour of the area.}}

:{{text|say|Grayson Bell|Don't worry, we aren't going far. I just want to point out some of the spots where we've been dealing with Horde attacks. In case we need you to, you know, kill 'em.}}
:{{text|say|Grayson Bell|Over there to the east, that's the Circle of Elements. They've got big stone totems, giant fire elementals, and huge circles on the ground. Shamans love it.}}
:{{text|say|Grayson Bell|Over there? That's Newstead. Farm and pasture land. Pretty standard fare.}}
:{{text|say|Grayson Bell|Straight ahead, you'll see High Perch, and then beyond it? That's Ar'gorok, my <boy / girl>. The enemy. The place we need to take over.}}
:{{text|say|Grayson Bell|Alright, that's enough. Let's bring her on down.}}
