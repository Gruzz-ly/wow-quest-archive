==Objectives==
Gather 12 Motes of Myzrael from [[Drywhisker]] [[Kobold]]s.
*[[Mote of Myzrael]] (12)

==Description==
My name is [[Myzrael]]. I am a princess of the earth, and my captors, the [[giant]]s, have trapped me deep beneath the [[Arathi Highlands]]. These crystal shards are the only way I can speak with the surface world.

Please help me. Allies of the giants, the Drywhisker kobolds, have a shard like this one in their [[Drywhisker Gorge]], to the east. To power the cluster, you must gather motes of Myzrael from the kobolds and apply them to it.

I beg you, <name>, aid me! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
*3700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||22|20}} at 70)

==Progress==
This cluster of shards looks much like the [[Shards of Myzrael]].  But the same feeling of security does not pulse through them.

==Completion==
Ah!  You activated these shards.  Already I feel more myself!

But alas, I am still far from free...
