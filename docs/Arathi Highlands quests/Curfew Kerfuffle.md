==Objectives==
Deal with 15 Marran Supporters in [[Stromgarde]].
* [[Marran Supporter]]s sent home (15)

==Description==
I'm glad for your help. Between deployments to [[Khaz Algar]], responding to threats in the [[Arathi Highlands|Highlands]], and desertion, we simply don't have enough soldiers to enforce order.

[[Marran Trollbane|Marran]]'s supporters are causing trouble throughout the city. They're stealing supplies, harassing people--you name it. We've enacted a curfew, but Marran's supporters are openly defying it.

As my deputies, go around and tell the troublemakers to go home. If they get rowdy, you have my permission to teach them a lesson.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I understand that curfews are unpopular, but we really need one right now.

==Completion==
It's despicable really. They try to intimidate loyal citizens and make them leave just because they aren't human. They also shout down anyone that doesn't agree with them.

Many around here just try to avoid them, but it seems like they hang out where it's hard to do that.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Alliance}} {{text|say|Captain Roderick Brewston|Obliged for your help. But keep your eyes open. There are... agitators about.}}
:{{Horde}} {{text|say|Captain Roderick Brewston|A word of warning: you may be deputized, but for some people here, the Horde is unwelcome.}}
:{{text|say|[[Danath Trollbane]]|Apologies for putting you to work. We will speak again after I have briefed Nials and Brewston.}}
:''Danath, Nials, and Brewston head inside of [[Stromgarde Keep]].''

The player character has Brewston's Deputies buff. All over Stromgarde Keep, unfriendly [[Marran Supporter]]s are standing around in various places. Upon approach by an alliance character, some will automatically attack and say:
*{{Text|say|You came to the wrong place, <race>!}}
*{{Text|say|No one wants you here, <race>!}}
*{{Text|say|Strom will rise again!}}

Upon approach by a Horde character, they will always attack and say:
*{{Text|say|A <race>! Get them!}}
*{{Text|say|Your people should be wiped from Azeroth!}}
*{{Text|say|Death to the Horde!}}
*{{Text|say|Humanity first!}}

Upon defeat:
*{{Text|say|You won't get away with this!}}
*{{Text|say|I'll get more friends--you just wait!}}
*{{Text|say|Take it easy, I was just joking!}}
*{{Text|say|I'm sorry! I'm sorry!}}
*{{Text|say|You win this round!}}
*{{Text|say|Fine, I'll go!}}
*{{Text|say|Stupid curfew!}}

If they do not automatically attack, they will say to non-human characters:
*You people are what's wrong with the Alliance!
*A <race>? We should never have trusted you!
*Strom will rise again!
*Humanity first!
*A <race>! You are all traitors!
*Go back to where you come from, <race>!
*No one wants you here, <race>!

:{{gossip|quest=|<Show your deputy badge and tell them to go home.>}}

Upon being asked to leave, they will do so peacefully and say:
*{{Text|say|You think that badge will protect you?}}
*{{Text|say|The dawn is coming!}}
*{{Text|say|You don't belong here, friend.}}
*{{Text|say|Marran is the leader Stromgarde needs!}}
*{{Text|say|You better watch your back in this city.}}
*{{Text|say|Hmph, fine.}}
*{{Text|say|We'll comply. For now.}}

Human and Worgen characters will not be attacked and have unique dialogue when speaking to the supporters:
*Hey you! Want a brighter future for humanity?
*Welcome to Stromgarde friend.
*Are you here to support Marran?
*Always good to see a fellow human.
*Join us friend! All humans welcome
*Us humans need to stick together.
*Whose side are you on stranger?
*Have you heard the good word of Joseph?

:{{gossip|quest=|<Show your deputy badge and tell them to go home.>}}

Head to the Stromgarde Barracks to turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Captain Roderick Brewston|The people are scared of Marran's gangs. If we reassigned...}}
:{{Text|Say|Colonel Veronica Nials|No, Captain. You know we don't have the manpower for that.}}

They both have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Colonel Veronica Nials|[[Faerin Lothar]]. I never expected to meet a Lothar after Sir [[Anduin Lothar]] fell at [[Blackrock Spire]].

The Lothar bloodline is descended from [[King Thoradin]] himself, founder of the Empire of Arathor.

Faerin may not think much of her surname, but to people on this side of the world she could be considered royalty.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Captain Roderick Brewston|The city is a powder keg waiting to go off.

Lady Marran's supporters are growing day by day because of the attacks in the Highlands... Her people harass not just the commonfolk who follow Lord Danath, but also anyone who isn't human. And now these "Red Dawn" people Lord Danath just told us about...

Between our deployment to Khaz Algar, combat losses, desertion, and attacks in the Highlands, we just don't have the resources to police the city right now.}}
