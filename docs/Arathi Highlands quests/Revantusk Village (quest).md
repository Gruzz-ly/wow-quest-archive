==Objectives==
Travel to [[Revantusk Village]] in [[The Hinterlands]] and speak with [[Elder Torntusk]].

==Description==
Not all [[forest troll]]s are foul nuisances like the [[Witherbark tribe|Witherbark]]. North of here in the Hinterlands is Revantusk Village, home to the only forest troll tribe still allied with the [[Horde]].

Even they cannot escape the cruelty of their bretheren. The [[Vilebranch tribe]] wars with them, distracting them from our battle with the Alliance.

You have fought well here. Speak with [[Urda]] if you wish to fly to Revantusk. Their village will have use of your strength.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|2200}} (or {{coppercost|1140}} at max level)
*1900 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|1140}} at max level)

==Completion==
Welcome to Revantusk, <class>. I hope fighting the Witherbark hasn't exhausted you; the Vilebranch are even worse.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
