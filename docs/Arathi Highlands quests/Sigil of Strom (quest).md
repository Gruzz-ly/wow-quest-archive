==Objectives==
Collect the Sigil of Strom from [[Syndicate]] members in [[Stromgarde Keep]].
* [[Sigil of Strom]]

==Description==
In ancient times, [[Ignaeus Trollbane|Lord Ignaeus]] of [[Strom]], named Trollbane, led the first human civilization of [[Arathor]] in war against the trolls. His blade was [[Trol'kalar]]--troll slayer, in their ancient tongue.

I was one of the last of his line, sworn with guarding Trol'kalar...a duty in which I failed. But now, we will obtain it once more, for my new master.

The sword is bound by three sigils. The first is held by the Syndicate traitors that lurk the ruins of Stromgarde. Slay them, and return the sigil to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||22}}

==Progress==
Only the Syndicate agents in Stromgarde will have the sigil. Spilling blood outside the fortress's walls will be a waste of your time.

==Completion==
I hated the Syndicate in life as much as I do in death. To see the sigil again is a small comfort.

But we have much more work to do... for Sylvanas.

==Progression==
