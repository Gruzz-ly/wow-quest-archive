==Notes==
;Upon accepting both '''A Humble Servant''' & [[Resupplying our Suppliers]]
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|<Name>, if you could help with cleanup and deliveries. Arator can help me with some work that needs another pair of hands.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Alonsus Faol]]|If you'll all excuse me, I must find [[Eitrigg]]. There are some things I need to arrange.}}

Speak with Sunwalker Dezco:
{{Dialogue|Thank you for aiding Hammerfall, <Name>.

{{gossip|quest=|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Is this what it means to be a [[Sunwalkers|Sunwalker]]?}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|For some. Others are content to smite the wicked with a giant hammer.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|But allowing the innocent to suffer... that is the worst evil.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|This isn't the type of thing the [[Knights of the Silver Hand|Silver Hand]] gets involved in, is it?}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|Alonsus has told me how he always intended for the Silver Hand to focus on this kind of service.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|But war changed what his paladins were called to do.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|Alonsus tells me stories of his first students. The legendary [[Uther the Lightbringer|Uther]] was apparently quite the nurse.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|I would have liked to meet the man during that time.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|[[Turalyon|My father]] was one of those students. He's never mentioned any of this to me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|I don't know the High Exarch well. I do know he's been to other worlds, far from here. Fighting for an unimaginable amount of time.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|We're shaped by the events in our lives. But we can choose how we live going forward.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|What type of paladin do you want to be, Arator? What type of person?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I... want to come back here and help you, once this war has ended. I think this is as much my calling as facing down the horrors of the Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|I'm glad to hear it. Now help me brace this beam before it slips.}}

Fill up the bar by cleaning up the [[Trash Pile (Arathi Highlands)|Trash]] (6%), eliminating the [[Charred Rubble|Rubble]] (8%) & kill the [[Hungry Rat]]s (3%) and [[Disgusting Cockroach]]es (3%) & heal the [[Injured Peon|Peons]] (8%)

Speak with Sunwalker Malu:
{{dialogue|There is much to do for the people of Hammerfall, <name>.

You honor [[An'she]] by your assistance for those in need.

{{gossip|You don't feel like you have better things to do?}}
{{dialogue-child|Dezco has taught me much out here. Just as no ray of sunlight is insignificant in the open wilderness, no small amount of work we do is unworthy.

Besides--it is not for us to deem what work is worthy and unworthy of carrying out in the light of An'she.

Working alongside him here. I've found that helping those in need is the most rewarding work I do.}}
}}

Speak with Sunwalker Nadura:
{{dialogue|Need something, <Name>?

{{gossip|Taking a break?}}
{{dialogue-child|I am! A well-deserved break. I've been working hard here with Dezco and Malu for... longer than I would like.

Though Dezco and Malu seem satisfied and content to be laborers. I am not. I did not walk the path of the Sun to haul rubble and rebuild structures.

I am a Sunwalker. My faith in An'she and my hammer are my tools to wield, not a mallet and shovel. In a world besieged by darkness, we are not the rays of sunlight we were meant to be.

This is not where I'd like to be right now.}}
}}

Meet up with Sunwalker Dezco and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|I understand, Faol. I'll gather the others and wait for your arrival.}}
