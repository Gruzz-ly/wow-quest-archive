==Objectives==
Meet your allies at [[Stromgarde Keep]].

==Description==
While feigning sleep, I heard the guards brag about the [[Red Dawn]]'s plans for Stromgarde.

My kidnapping was just the start.

[[Veronica Nials|Colonel Nials]]--after all these years! She will be the one to turn the key and free [[Marran Trollbane|Marran]], my niece, to do as she wishes and start a coup!

Marran will lead Stromgarde's army and the Red Dawn to [[Hammerfall]] to secure [[Arathi Highlands|the Highlands]] for "Strom."

<Danath's face is red with fury, but his eyes water with tears.>

We must gather our allies... and confront these traitors!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Marran has made her move. The coup has started.

Faerin and Brewston have rallied the Stromgarde loyalists, but there are many Marran supporters.

This will be a bloody civil war.

==Notes==

:{{Text|Say|Danath Trollbane|This was clearly Marran's handiwork. There's no telling what she'll do when Faerin returns.}}
