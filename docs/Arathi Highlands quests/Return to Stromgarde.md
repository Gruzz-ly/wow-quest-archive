==Objectives==
Return to [[Stromgarde]] and enlist [[Veronica Nials|Colonel Nials's]] aid in finding [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]].
* Speak with Nials in the Stromgarde barracks {{co|17.5|59.8|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* Await rescue

==Description==
[[Eitrigg]] was right. The [[Red Dawn]] are trying to start a conflict between the Horde and the Alliance.

We need to get back to Stromgarde and tell Colonel Nials that Danath has been kidnapped. She will surely commit all her resources to a search!

Come, <name>. There's no time to waste!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Brewston leans in close to you and speaks just above a whisper.>

I'm glad I found you. I need all the allies I can get.

You're very lucky they left you alive.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|I will inform [[Stromgarde]] and ask for their help in the search. With luck, I can forestall any aggression.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|We will head to [[Ar'gorok]]. If Danath is there, then this conflict ends before it starts.}}
:''They mount up and take off.''

Head to [[Stromgarde Keep]]'s [[Barracks (Stromgarde Keep)|Barracks]] where Faerin is reporting to [[Veronica Nials]].
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|We must widen the search!}}

They have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|I just finished explaining the situation to Colonel Nials. We should be heading out shortly to help Eitrigg find Danath!}}

{{dialogue|title=Colonel Veronica Nials|<Colonel Nials's face is scrunched up in concern. She looks uncomfortable. perhaps even regretful.>

An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] "Marran's Coup over Stromgarde" plays:
{{#ev:youtube|jYprdQGXFE8 |Marran's Coup}}
:''Interior, the barracks of Stromgarde Keep. The adventurer and Faerin are facing Nials. The footmen in the room turn to listen.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Colonel Veronica Nials|Hmm. We do not have the resources for a manhunt, Faerin.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|To rescue the Lord of Stromgarde? I though you were in charge here?}}
:''From offscreen, [[Marran Trollbane]] speaks as she walks up to Nials.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Marran Trollbane|Aha. I think we can drop this charade now, Veronica.}}
:''Faerin and the adventurer turn their heads to the voice as Nials turns and gives a smart salute.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|You. You're behind this. The Red Dawn. Danath's disappearance.}}
:''The footmen in the background silently close in.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Marran Trollbane|Yes, and now that my uncle is gone, I'm free to do what I wish.}}
:''Realizing, the adventurer turns around and draws their weapon.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Marran Trollbane|Footmen!}}
:''The footmen close in.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Stop this madness! You're all Arathi!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Marran Trollbane|Huh. And I thought you were once. Now you'll suffer for not joining our cause.}}
:''A Stromgarde footman brings her hammer down in an overhand strike on the adventuer.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the adventurer wakes up in a cell downstairs:
:''[[Captain Roderick Brewston]] comes down to free the adventurer.''
:{{text|say|Captain Roderick Brewston|It's you! Listen, I'm going to need your help. We have to stop Marran--and Nials!}}
:''He unlocks the door.''

Brewston has gossip:
{{dialogue|<You bring Brewston up to speed with what you know.>

I never would have thought Marran capable of such treachery. Does she really believe this is the way to help Stromgarde?

<Brewston scowls.>

Let's hope your orc friends are able to find Danath before it's too late. We have our hands full here.}}
