==Objectives==
Place 4 Supply Crates next to Arathi Refugees taking shelter in [[Hammerfall]].
* Supply Crates placed (4)

==Description==
[[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] is not here. 

[[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] says he journeyed to [[Hammerfall]] because we requested a meeting. I sent no such message to him nor anyone else. 

I will dispatch outriders immediately to search for him. 

While we wait for their return... You and [[Karga Bloodfury|Karga's]] quick thinking may have saved our human refugees. We had just run out of food to give them.

Distribute the crates directly to them. I'm sure they will be grateful for the food inside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I never realized how much my people have in common with the orcs. We are both far from home, we are both self-sufficient, we are both peoples born into war...

And most of all, their sense of duty and honor rivals ours.

I feel... even more at home here than in Stromgarde.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Dispatch all available outriders to search for Danath.}}
:''The Mag'har Guard takes off.''
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Geya'rah has told me much about you, Faerin. You are welcome here in Hammerfall.}}
:''Eitrigg and Faerin walk in.''

Drop off Supply Crates at the marked locations. Just inside under a tent:
:{{text|say|Arathi Refugee|Marauders burned down my farmstead. The orcs drove them off and brought me here for shelter.}}

North under the platform:
:{{text|say|Arathi Refugee|Is there spiced bread in there? Orcish food is hard on my teeth.}}
:{{text|say|Slagg|If our food's so tough, human, then don't eat it!}}

Atop the platform:
:{{text|say|[[Drum Fel]]|Not so long ago these humans wanted to kill us. Why is Eitrigg helping them? Better to leave them to their fate.}}

Further north:
:{{text|say|Arathi Refugee|It looks like the outriders have all gone.}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Refugee|Finally!}}

Check in with Faerin and Eitrigg inside the inn:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|If orcs have long warred against the humans, why help them?}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Long ago, [[Tirion Fordring|a human]] showed me great kindness. I strive to honor his memory by protecting the weak and defenseless.}}

A few characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Innkeeper Adegwa|My apologies friend. We do not have room in the inn at the moment.

We are sheltering more people than expected due to the recent troubles in the Highlands.}}
{{dialogue|title=Eitrigg|Every human I have ever met has admitted feeling fear in the presence of an orc at one point in their lives. We have warred with the humans for generations.  It's almost instinctual.

Or so I thought. To see and speak to a human with no grudges from the past and no judgement in their eyes--it is not an honor I expected in my lifetime.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Seeing Hammerfall and talking to your people has been an eye-opening experience, Eitrigg.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Harboring refugees no matter their creed... my people would do the same.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|I do not doubt that. Both of our peoples have suffered through dark times.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|We may live here in peace now, but this site was once witness to unspeakable horrors.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|The [[Alliance of Lordaeron|Alliance]] imprisoned many orcs here in an [[internment camp]].}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|We [[Liberation of the internment camps|liberated]] and claimed it, naming it after our fallen warchief, [[Orgrim Doomhammer]].}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The Alliance held your people here? In an internment camp? And yet you harbor human refugees?}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|And yet. Lamplighter, there have been far worse crimes committed against my people. Such is war.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|But our teachings say if we are wronged, we can cause more suffering, or end it. We now choose to end the cycle.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|I think that my people could learn a great deal from yours, Eitrigg. Thank you for welcoming me here.}}
