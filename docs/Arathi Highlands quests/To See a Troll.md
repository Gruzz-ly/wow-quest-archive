[[File:To See a Troll.jpg|thumb|[[Faerin Lothar]], [[Overlord Geya'rah]], [[Barclay]], and two [[Hammerfall Outrider]]s at [[Go'Shek Farm]]]]

==Objectives==
Meet [[Overlord Geya'rah]] at [[Go'Shek Farm]].

==Description==
There's no word from the outriders yet, but [[Eitrigg]] has not told Geya'rah of [[Danath Trollbane|Danath's]] disappearance. 

I have told him we would go and give her the news.

She's at Go'Shek Farm dealing with a [[Witherbark tribe|Witherbark troll]] attack. Eitrigg says they've become increasingly aggressive recently. 

I can't help but think of the history there--of the [[Troll Wars]] and Arathi battles. But I admit I see them differently now after learning more about the Horde.

Let's go. We can look for Danath while we're out there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Faerin has informed me of Danath's disappearance. While that is... troubling... We can't return to Hammerfall just yet.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|We'll tell Geya'rah of Danath's disappearance. Hopefully, he will arrive here before we return.}}
:''Faerin walks out.''

Head southeast to [[Go'Shek Farm]]. Check in at the south entrance to find Faerin and [[Overlord Geya'rah]] speaking with [[Barclay]]. Two [[Hammerfall Outrider]]s are keeping watch.
:{{text|say|Barclay|Wait! I have information abo--about the Red Dawn. Help me, and I'll tell you what I know!}}

They have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|The [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]], the [[Scarlet Crusade]], and now this "[[Syndicate]]." I've been told these aren't just bandit groups, but once powerful organizations in their own right.

Many are wondering why they are gathering in the [[Arathi Highlands]]. It seems they each once had their own spheres of influence, but have amassed here for an unknown reason.

Does the [[Red Dawn]] have something to do with this? None of the people I talked to have ever heard of that group before...}}

{{dialogue|title=Barclay|My brothers and I have served in the Syndicate for years. We are true patriots of the Kingdom of Alterac!

But now there have been some changes in leadership, and we're not sure if this is the same Syndicate anymore. 

I think we were sent on this mission so the new leader could get rid of us. Fine! We'll start our own Syndicate!

As for the information I have... The new leader is planning something--something big. And it'll happen soon.}}

{{dialogue|title=Overlord Geya'rah|Faerin told me that Danath is missing. I don't know who was responsible, but it certainly wasn't the Mag'har.

We've heard rumblings that Stromgarde is blaming us once again for their troubles. Tensions are starting to boil over. We need Danath so cooler heads can prevail.

But as much as I want to search for the old man, we have to deal with business here first.}}
