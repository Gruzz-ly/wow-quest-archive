==Objectives==
Collect 20 Articles of Proof from [[Red Dawn]] troops within [[Stromgarde]].
* [[Articles of Proof]] (20)

==Description==
[[Marran Trollbane|Marran]] tried to declare herself the new ruler of Stromgarde. While some in the army are complicit in her coup, there are still a lot of us who are loyal to [[Danath Trollbane|Lord Danath Trollbane]].

But when we broke ranks, Marran was ready for us. She has an army of soldiers I've never seen before. They call themselves the Red Dawn, but I think they're just the bandits wearing uniforms they took from our supplies!

Help us take out her goons and collect any evidence that shows what they really are!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Some of this stuff must be at least twenty years old...

==Completion==
I knew it! Her army is made up of members of the Defias, Scarlet Crusade, and Syndicate. In other words--bandits, zealots, and traitors!

This evidence should help convince others that Marran is not to be trusted!

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Captain Roderick Brewston|I need to rally more loyal troops. You see if you can find Faerin. We need all the help we can get!}}
:''He runs up the stairs.''

Outside [[Danath Loyalist]]s are fighting off [[Red Dawn Confessor]]s, [[Red Dawn Enforcer]]s, [[Red Dawn Firebrand]]s, [[Red Dawn Houndmaster]]s, [[Red Dawn Firebrand]]s, [[Red Dawn Recruit]]s, [[Red Dawn Warhound]]s, and [[Stromgarde Traitor]]s.

Hostiles will drop any of a [[Defias Bandana]], [[Orange Bandana]], [[Scarlet Crusade Tabard]], [[Stromgarde Tabard (quest item)]], or a [[Syndicate Emblem (quest item)]], which collectively count as [[Articles of Proof]].

After gathering all 20 Articles of Proof and finding Faerin, follow her to the front gate, where she, Brewston, and [[Overlord Geya'rah]] have arrived:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Sacred Flame, I'm glad you're here. You found Danath?}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|He ran ahead with Eitrigg to confront Marran. We will join the fight soon!}}

==Progression==
{{Rise of the Red Dawn}}
