==Objectives==
Return to [[Zaruk]] at [[Hammerfall]] in [[Arathi Highlands]].

==Description==
As the stone goes quiet, you're left with a vague sense of unease. Something isn't right.

Perhaps you should tell Zaruk of what you've done so far.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1100}}
*1100 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|660}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Orgrimmar}}

==Completion==
I know, <name>. I should not have sent you.

Forgive me... the whispers of the past are sometimes too strong.
