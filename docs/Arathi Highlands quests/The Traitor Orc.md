==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Marez Cowl]]'s Bloodstone Orb and bring it to [[Tor'gan]] in [[Hammerfall]].
* [[Befouled Bloodstone Orb]]

==Description==
There is no doubt in my mind that a powerful warlock resides within the walls of [[Stromgarde Keep|Stromgarde]]. From time to time, using an arcane magical relic, this warlock has summoned forth terrible demons in large numbers. We must remove the source of her energy.

Find the warlock and kill her. Bring me whatever magical object you find on her person, and I will take steps to destroy it and see that its power is not used to taint this land any longer.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bloodstone-Studded Cloak
|Drakeskin Leggings
|Radiant Silver Armguards
|Highland Chain Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The burning in my blood... it grows by the day. The warlock must be stopped. 

==Completion==
My restless nights will turn to peaceful slumber when I have destroyed this orb. Thank you, <name>. It is a chilling reminder of the terrible power the demons held over the orcs before [[Grom Hellscream|Hellscream]] released them from their curse.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Arathi Highlands!}}
