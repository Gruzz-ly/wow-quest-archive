==Objectives==
Kill 7 Boulderfist Shaman and 3 Boulderfist Lords in Stromgarde.
* [[Boulderfist Shaman]] (7)
* [[Boulderfist Lord]] (3)

==Description==
Our next strike against the [[ogre]]s will bring you further east to [[Stromgarde Keep|Stromgarde]]. The living consider these gutted ruins worth clinging to. Their sentimentality is disgusting!

All that Stromgarde holds for us is a foul den of more ogres, waiting to be struck down. Travel there and slay their shamans and lords, and ensure what passes for leadership among the ogres is snuffed out.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ramshackle Bracers
|Extra Credit Boots
|Lurking Belt
|Belt of Gutted Ruin
|Gold Star Boots
|Chain of Ogre Ruin
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
The ogres lurk in the corner of the ruins, away from the humans. Don't forget I'm only rewarding you for slaughtering ogres this time, <class>. You can do what you want for fun, but don't expect extra credit.

==Completion==
Cleared out properly? Good. I doubt we'll even bother to lurk in Stromgarde. That ramshackle hold needs to be razed into dust.

The land would make a decent spot for a new Undercity in its place.

==Progression==
{{Clearing the Highlands}}
