==Description==
The [[Syndicate]] has put Hammerfall to torch!

And the cowards are using pyromancers to feed the flames.

But we can save our huts if we get to them quickly.

Fight through the Syndicate bandits to a building and then blow this horn. A Hammerfall shaman will come to put out the fire!

==Rewards==
You will receive:

* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
They will not destroy Hammerfall on my watch!

==Completion==
Hah! Built [[orc]] strong!

Just like us!

==Notes==
Accept all three quests:
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Forward! Hammerfall will be ours once more!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Lok-tar ogar! For the Horde!}}
:''The defenders run in!''

Head to marked locations in Hammerfall to gain the Hammerfall Horn as an extra action button:
:{{abilities|Hammerfall Horn|Blow this horn at the entrance to a Hammerfall building to call a shaman to put out the flames.}}

After finishing all three quests, head to Eitrigg, Geya'rah, and Faerin at the rear gate.
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|An ambushed Stromic caravan?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|It could be [[Danath]]'s. We must go and investigate!}}
