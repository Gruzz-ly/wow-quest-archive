==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Joseph the Enlightened.jpg|Joseph the Enlightened|Joseph the Enlightened seems to be the leader of this Syndicate attack.}}

Defeat Joseph the Enlightened in [[Hammerfall]].
* [[Joseph the Enlightened]] defeated {{co|69.5|32.7|Arathi Highlands||1}}

==Description==
I caught a glimpse of who was leading the attack.

It looks like Joseph the Enlightened may be less full of hot air than we thought he was.

Is he now part of the [[Syndicate]]? I thought he was part of the "[[Scarlet Crusade|Crusade]]." I suppose it doesn't matter. If we want to stop the attack, we'll have to take him out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I fully expect him to run away again like the coward he is.

==Completion==
Joseph escaped again, and this time his warning was much more foreboding. He has darkness in his mind... and his soul.

I am... confused how he can profess to follow the [[Light]].

==Notes==
Accept all three quests:
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Forward! Hammerfall will be ours once more!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Lok-tar ogar! For the Horde!}}
:''The defenders run in!''

Confront Joseph inside the Great Hall after putting out the fire.
:{{Text|say|Joseph the Enlightened|Ha ha ha! You again! I will not go easy on you this time!}}

Get him below 50% and he'll [[Bubble Hearth]] again:
:{{Text|say|Joseph the Enlightened|You are fortunate I changed my mind and spared you! Next time I will not be so forgiving!}}
:''Joseph hearths away.''

After finishing all three quests, head to Eitrigg, Geya'rah, and Faerin at the rear gate.
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|An ambushed Stromic caravan?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|It could be [[Danath]]'s. We must go and investigate!}}
