==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Joseph the Enlightened.jpg|Joseph the Enlightened|Joseph the Enlightened is a leader of the Red Dawn and Marran's right hand man.}}
Defeat Joseph the Enlightened and help Danath and Eitrigg.
* [[Joseph the Enlightened]] slain {{co|19.4|64.9|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] and [[Eitrigg]] found

==Description==
Danath and Eitrigg ran ahead to confront [[Marran Trollbane|Marran]]. They hope if they stop her, they can end the coup--and the bloodshed.

But after seeing Joseph the Enlightened's handiwork first hand... 

Despite how unorthodox he may be, he's still a danger. And I hate to say it, but I would relish the chance to finally take that underhanded cretin down.

He's blocking our path up ahead at city hall. Let's take him down and then help Danath and Eitrigg end this war.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Stromgarde Tabard]] {{Alliance}}
* [[Hammerfall Tabard]] {{Horde}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 18,300 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Alliance turns the quest in to Danath:

:Marran was given mercy.

:I'm still not sure she deserved it.

:But there is little she can do now without her name and title. After failing twice, the Stromic will not follow her. And without the power her name and title wielded, she's useless to the bandits.

:Mercy or not, I thank the Light that the conflict has been ended.

:You have my thanks as well, <name>.

Horde turns the quest in to Eitrigg:

:Was granting mercy the right decision?

:I do not know. And it was not my decision to make.

:Danath says there is little Marran can do now without her name and title. If she persists, she will be nothing more than a common bandit.

:Let us hope her exile was enough to end this conflict.

:Thank you for your aid, <name>.

At the Altar, Danath, Eitrigg and some loyalists are fighting off Red Dawn Recruits, and [[Marran Trollbane]] is standing ready. Run up and an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] plays, "Faerin Inspires Danath":
{{#ev:youtube|FXvToh3lYwY|Faerin and Marran}}
:''Exterior. The altar at the southeast end of [[Stromgarde Keep]]. Faerin, Geya'rah, and the adventurer run up to join the melee. Faerin uses her pike to block an overhead slash from Marran.''
:{{text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Ah! Stop this! Danath fought to save all of Azeroth!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Marran Trollbane|He sold us out so the Alliance and Horde could wage war in Khaz Algar!}}
:''Marran pushes Faerin away.''
:{{text|bossemote|Marran Trollbane|You'll never understand.}}
:''Marran raises her sword and shouts.''
:{{text|bossemote|Marran Trollbane|For Arathor!}}
:''Marran charges in to attack, but Faerin uses her shield to knock the traitor on to her back. Marran's sword clatters away, out of reach. As it slides to a stop, Marran is on one knee as Faerin closes the gap. Marran appears to pull something out of her pocket.''
:{{text|bossemote|Marran Trolllbane|The Red Dawn will rise again!}}
:''Faerin stops, plants her feet, and prepares to run Marran through with her pike, but Danath quickly places himself between the two women.''
:{{text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|No. Do not make her a martyr.}}
:''He turns around to address Marran.''
:{{text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Our history will read: Faerin, true daughter of the Arathi--}}
:''Marran gets to her feet with a grimace. In the background, more Red Dawn members appear in the background.''
:{{text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|--allowed Marran to live without her title and name. The Red Dawn vanished from the Highlands. Forever.}}
:''Veronica Nials walks up behind Marran.''
:{{text|bossemote|Marran Trollbane|This. This is not over.}}
:''They turn and leave. Eitrigg and the adventurer walk up to Danath and Faerin as they all watch.''
