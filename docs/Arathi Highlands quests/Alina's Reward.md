==Objectives==
Speak to [[Dark Ranger Alina]].

==Description==
The tale of [[Trol'kalar]] ends here, then. It will be a weapon to bring death to the living, in the name of the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]].

Leave me now, <name>. My job is once again to guard the blade. Tell Alina of your victory, I'm sure she will have a reward for you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sandals of Satisfaction
|Bracers of Sensations
|Alina's Gloves
|Lordaeron-Made Breastplate
|Cuffs of Feeling
|Grips of the Forsaken
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,850 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
The news of your victory satisfies me, <class>... a rare sensation. The Dark Lady herself has mused that our conquest of [[Lordaeron]] may be the only way the [[Forsaken]] can find true satisfaction, and pehaps even relief.

But it matters not. Our victory is inevitable. For your loyal service to the Forsaken, I award you in the name of Sylvanas.
