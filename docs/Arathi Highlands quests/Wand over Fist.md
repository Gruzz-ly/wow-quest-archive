==Objectives==
Find [[:Trelane's Wand of Invocation]] and return it to [[Skuerto]] at Refuge Pointe.
* [[Trelane's Wand of Invocation]]

==Description==
Hey, <name>. Sorry to be so short with ye earlier... and no, that ain't a pun.

I figured out where Trelane's first item ended up: Kor'gresh has it in Boulderfist Hall. An' by the way he was throwing down blasts of ice at his kin to keep them in line, he must be close to figurin' out how to use all of its powers.

Boulderfist Hall's south of here an' then east of Thandol Span. Find the ogre an' get back that wand.

While you're gone, I'll figure out what we're gonna do about Stromgarde.
:''(Kor'gresh Coldrage: Once we have the wand, we can move forward with our plan.)''

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Our goal is the wand, <name>. Focus on that for now.

==Completion==
Brilliant, <name>. One item down an' three more to go, based on my list. The other three items are all in Stromgarde.

Take a rest an' get your strength back—the next phase of my plan'll require a little more time an' effort. Come back to me after you've gotten a warm meal an' some rest.

==Notes==
This quest is a bit of a non sequitur after cataclysm, as [[Archmage Trelane]] has not been introduced yet.

==Trivia==
This quest is a possible reference to the song "Hand over Fist" from the album {{wp|Presto (album)|Presto}} by the Canadian rock band {{wp|Rush (band)|Rush}}. The album's cover art and multiple songs deal with forms of magic.
