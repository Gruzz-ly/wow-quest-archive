You're all right, <name>. It's not every day you come across a so-called hero that has a clue what they're doing once they get this far from home, so I'll let you in on some more work.

I've a friend by the name of Shakes O'Breen. He's the captain of a crew of pirates, the [[Blackwater Raiders]]; good men, respectable as pirates go. They dock at Faldir's Cove, hidden along the southern shore.

I'm sure O'Breen will have lucrative jobs for you if you're interested.

*+350 [[reputation]] with {{F|Stormwind}}

==Completion==
Ahoy, <class>.  Any friend of [[Skuerto]] is a friend of mine.

You'll find plenty of work needs doin' around here.  We're not sittin' in this cove twiddlin' our thumbs by choice.
