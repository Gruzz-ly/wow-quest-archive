==Objectives==
Travel to [[Arathi Highlands]] and speak with {{NPC||Captain Nials}} in [[Refuge Pointe]]. 

==Description==
You should go on ahead and warn the other side of the span about this, <name>.

Over the bridge to the north you'll find Refuge Pointe, the stronghold of the [[Alliance]] in Arathi. Tell Captain Nials to keep an eye out for these [[Twilight's Hammer]] curs.

==Completion==
I suppose I owe [[Thargas Anvilmar|Thargas]] a favor for sending such a bold hero my way.

Or perhaps he just wanted to keep all the clean-up for himself. Regardless, you'll find much to do here for the Alliance.
