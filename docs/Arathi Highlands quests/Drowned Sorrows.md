==Objectives==
[[Captain Steelgut]] in [[Faldir's Cove]] wants you to kill 10 Daggerspine Raiders and 3 Daggerspine Sorceresses.
* [[Daggerspine Raider]] (10)
* [[Daggerspine Sorceress]] (3)

==Description==
Argh, 'tis a horrible life. I should be in a watery grave right now, not sittin' here by the fire, breathin' fresh air.

The crew tried so hard to save my beautiful [[Maiden's Folly]]. Bless the boys, bless their hearts.

[[Shakes O'Breen|O'Breen]] made it to shore safely but we weren't so lucky. The seas just sank on us, I swear.

One second we're afloat and the next water is rushin' in. And those beasts! Killed all the survivors. Horrible [[naga]] scum. I went black and ended up here, saved.

I want those beasts dead.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Folly's Spar
|Steelgut Vest
|Maiden's Tattered Sail
|Steelgut's Undermail
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]

Reputation gains:
* +250 [[Booty Bay]]
* +125 [[Gadgetzan]]
* +125 [[Ratchet]]
* +125 [[Everlook]]

==Progress==
Bah, maybe I should go kill those naga scum myself. It's obvious you're not goin' to do it.

Maybe I can find some knitting needles so you can keep yourself busy.

==Completion==
Nice work out there, <name>.

Those scum deserved what they got. While nothin' will ever bring me the ship or me crew back, the death of those naga gives me some solace.

Accepting this quest grants you the buff "Blackwater Boon", that provides both water breathing and a substantial increase to your swimming speed.
