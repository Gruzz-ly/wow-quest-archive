==Objectives==
Bring Marez's head to [[Captain Nials]] at [[Refuge Pointe]]. 
*[[Marez's Head]]

==Description==
A bounty has been placed on the head of Marez Cowl, a high-level advisor and operative of the [[Syndicate]]. She was last seen within the Syndicate controlled territory of [[Stromgarde Keep|Stromgarde]].

Bounty may be collected from Captain Nials.

Be warned: Marez is a skilled and cunning [[warlock]], known for her trafficking with [[demon]]s. Extreme caution is advised when hunting her.

==Progress==
Greetings, <class>.  You have a report to make? 

==Completion==
You took down [[Marez Cowl]]?  Well done, <name>.  Well done indeed!

Marez menaced our [[Stromgarde Militia|Stromgarde defenders]], and it is rumored she was an emissary between the Syndicate and some other, darker power.  We are glad to see that she'll no longer ply her powers against us. 

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Stromgarde Badges]] from [[Captain Nials]] and [[Wanted! Otto and Falconcrest]] off the Wanted Board before leaving camp. 

To get to Marez Cowl, go into Stromgarde and take the first left. Go to the back and around to the right, killing the Syndicate members and looting badges. Marez Cowl is behind the building at the dead end, not inside. Otto and Falconcrest are inside the Keep at the back of Stromgarde, straight down the road from Stromgarde's entrance. They are on the upper floor. Kill Syndicate members along the way and collect badges if any are still needed.
