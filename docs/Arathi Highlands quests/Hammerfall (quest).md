==Objectives==
Report to [[Gor'mul]] at [[Hammerfall]] in [[Arathi Basin]].

==Description==
You have served us well here, <name>. Now that we've made our mark, the next phase of our conquest will occur over months rather than minutes.

There is much work yet to be done, and I will spare you the tedium of waiting for our fortifications to trickle in. Travel to the east, to Hammerfall. The orcs there will no doubt have use of your aid.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||11}}

==Completion==
Throm'ka, <class>. If your deeds for the undead are as great as you claim, I am honored to help you serve the Horde.

==Progression==
