==Objectives==
Protect [[Kinelory]] until she returns to [[Quae]].

==Description==
Al right, <name>.  I'm ready if you are.

Shall we?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

==Progress==
You'd best keep with Kinelory. I trust you, but if something happens to her, I won't be accountable for my actions.

==Completion==
You've done a great service for us, <name>.  Thank you.

I hope Kin wasn't too much of a handful down there.  She's very friendly, but can be just as deadly when you're her enemy.

==Notes==
Follow Kinelory to [[Apothecary Jorell]]'s house and kill him.

When she's attacked, Kinelory will say "Attack me if you will, but you won't stop me from getting back to Quae".

==Progression==
{{Quae and Kinelory}}
