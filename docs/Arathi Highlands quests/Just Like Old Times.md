* [[Sealed Folder]]

==Description==
{{Questportrait|image=Forsaken Courier.jpg|name=Forsaken Courier|text=Find her on the road.}}
It's funny. [[Kinelory|Kin]] and I have been through so much together, and here we find ourselves back in [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]], like so many years ago.

[[Hints of a New Plague? (2)|We broke up a plot]] to create a new plague right here, her and I. It doesn't look like the Horde learned their lesson, because they're all over this farm yet again.

Their undead courier is shuffling around as obvious as daylight. If you want to help, find the courier and bring back whatever they're carrying.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

==Progress==
We appreciate your help in looking for that courier, <name>.

While you were gone, Kin saw an apothecary come out of that same house to the south of here.  I'm confident that they're up to no good -- I just need proof of it before we go off and do something rash.

Have you had any luck yet?

==Completion==
Apothecaries yet again. you think they'd get the message.  let's see what it is this time...
