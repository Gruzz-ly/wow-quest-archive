==Objectives==
Escort [[Professor Phizzlethorpe]] to the cave and back.
*Defend Professor Phizzlethorpe

==Description==
Now that we are full-fledged [[Blackwater Raiders]] it is our job to help [[Shakes O'Breen|Mr. O'Breen]] locate the lost elven treasure.

It is next to impossible to find the gems in the dark sea without aid. [[Doctor Draxlegauge|The doctor]] has constructed some goggles that will help. He needs the goggles charged with the energy derived from the [[Charging Stone|enchanted stone]] in the cave just up the hill.

But the cave is cursed! When we get close, we get ambushed. Defend me and I can harness the energy from the stone into the goggles.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

Reputation gains:
*+250 [[Booty Bay]]
*+125 [[Gadgetzan]]
*+125 [[Ratchet]]
*+125 [[Everlook]]

==Progress==
This is no time to talk! The goggles need to be charged with the power of the stone!

==Completion==
The goggles work perfectly now! Well done, <name>.
