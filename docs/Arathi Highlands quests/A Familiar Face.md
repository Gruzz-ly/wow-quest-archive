==Objectives==
Defeat the leader of the attack on [[Refuge Pointe]].
* [[Joseph the Enlightened|Enemy leader defeated]] {{co|40.4|46.3|Arathi Highlands||1}}

==Description==
Early on, these attacks on our settlements seemed to be pockets of [[bandit]]s competing for resources.

Now they are better coordinated. As if they are working together as a group.

That's bad news for everyone.

But rivals don't come together without a strong leader. And without them, they will fall.

If you're willing, find the leader of this attack on Refuge Pointe and eliminate them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Go. I will protect these people until your return.

==Completion==
He escaped?

<Karga spits on the ground.>

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|These bandits... did they call themselves "[[Defias]]?" Did they mention the "[[Red Dawn]]?"}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|I did not give any time to speak. They killed everyone not human and took all but who I could drag away.}}

Head in. As expected, the leader is [[Joseph the Enlightened]]:
:{{text|say|Joseph the Enlightened|You dare think you can stop what's coming? You dare think you can stop the Red Dawn?}}

Get him below 50% and he'll [[Bubble Hearth]]:
:{{text|say|Joseph the Enlightened|Hnng! No matter. Our job here is done. You will never defeat all of us!}}

Collect four crates, then check back in. On return:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|You're saying [[Danath]] was never called to [[Hammerfall]]?}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|On my life, [[Geya'rah]] said nothing of it.}}

==Progression==
{{Rise of the Red Dawn}}
