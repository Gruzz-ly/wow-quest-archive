==Objectives==
Gather the [[:Burning Key]], the [[:Cresting Key]] and the [[:Thundering Key]] from the [[Stone of West Binding]], the [[Stone of East Binding]] and the [[Stone of Outer Binding]].
*[[Burning Key]]
*[[Cresting Key]]
*[[Thundering Key]]

==Description==
Four Stones of Binding are scattered throughout [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]]. These stones keep me pinned beneath the earth.

To unlock them you must unlock the strongest: the [[Stone of Inner Binding]]. And to do that, you must gather keys from the other three.

These stones are watched by guardians, but if you are clever, or lucky, you may find ways to banish them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3900 [[XP]] (or {{cost||23|40}} at level 70)

==Progress==
This is the Stone of Inner Binding.  It is the strongest of the binding stones and must be unlocked for the others to open.

==Completion==
<[[Myzrael]] speaks through the stone.>

You have done it!  You opened the Stones of Binding!  I can feel the shackles about me loosen, and freedom draws ever closer.

You are a noble <class>, <name>.  My rescuer!
