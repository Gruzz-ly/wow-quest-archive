==Objectives==
Speak with [[Galen Trollbane]].

==Description==
Once, there was a foolish troll named [[Zengu]]. He was tasked to find the sword [[Trol'kalar]], the legendary blade of the human [[Trollbane]] line. He succeeded, and thinking his task done, went to leave [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]] by himself. There he was cut down by the humans, and the sword simply reclaimed.

We will not be so foolish. Our apothecaries have given us the perfect guide to reobtain Trol'kalar: the prince who once held it.

He stands ready to guide you, <name>. Speak with him.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||2|25}}

==Completion==
Yes... I was once Prince of the fallen kingdom of [[Stromgarde (kingdom)|Stromgarde]]. I was cut down by the one seeking Trol'kalar.

I rue my foolish life now. I serve...only [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]].
