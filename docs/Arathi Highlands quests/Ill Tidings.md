[[File:Ill Tidings.jpg|thumb|[[Veronica Nials|Colonel Veronica Nials]], [[Captain Roderick Brewston]], [[Danath Trollbane]], and [[Faerin Lothar]] outside [[Stromgarde Keep]]]]

==Objectives==
Meet [[Danath Trollbane]] at the gates of [[Stromgarde Keep]].

==Description==
A [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] attack. The theft of tar and torches. A group called the [[Red Dawn]] recruiting here in the heart of [[Arathi Highlands|the Highlands]]...

Stromgarde was right to send a missive asking for my return. What is going on here?

I placed [[Veronica Nials|Colonel Nials]] in charge after [[Marran Trollbane|Marran's]] foolishness led to her imprisonment. I must head to Stromgarde and speak with Nials immediately.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is much worse than I thought. With the attacks disrupting supply lines, the people are angry, hungry, and looking for someone to blame. The easy choice is blaming our neighbors at Hammerfall.

We cannot let this unrest continue. I must speak to Nials and my advisors.

I see Faerin has volunteered the both of you to help the people of Stromgarde. I do not like putting either of you to work on what is a diplomatic mission, but helping Brewston while I speak to Nials would put my mind at ease.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Overlord Geya'rah]]|The Red Dawn? I will go to [[Hammerfall]] and see what they know of this.}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|We must continue on to Stromgarde. Unless, [[Faerin]]...}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Danath, I am a soldier and an [[Arathi]]--just like you. I would not abandon you now.}}

Head to Stromgarde Keep, where Danath and Faerin are speaking with Nials and [[Captain Roderick Brewston]].
:{{Text|say|Colonel Veronica Nials|Unrest in [[Newstead]]? We don't have the hands to quell the unrest here!}}
:{{Text|say|Faerin Lothar|If more hands are needed to keep Stromgarde safe... the champion and I are ready to help.}}

Several characters have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Colonel Veronica Nials|Lord Danath has granted you entry into Stromgarde, but be warned--the populace is on edge and acts of violence are becoming more common. Especially against non-humans.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Captain Roderick Brewston|If Danath vouches for you, I trust you.

And trust is in low supply here in Stromgarde.

After Lady Marran was put in her place, I thought Stromgarde would go back to normal. And it did. For a time.

But now there's tension here so thick I'm afraid to breathe around some people.

Citizens are acting out. I don't know what's gotten into everyone. Fighting, stealing, backstabbing...

If you're willing, I could use your help.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|Strom, or Stromgarde as it is known now, was once the capital of the Empire of Arathor. King Thoradin founded the city after uniting the human tribes under his rule.

He built this fortress long ago to protect the humans from the Amani trolls. Think of it--this castle is older than my entire nation.}}

After completion, so does Danath:
{{Dialogue|Despite her imprisonment, it seems Marran's words have struck a chord with many in Stromgarde. I should never have appointed her regent in my absence.}}
