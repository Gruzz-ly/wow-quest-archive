==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Burning Steppes]] and meet with the [[Sons of Lothar]].
*Let Alonsus know you are ready
*Head to the Burning Steppes to meet with the Sons of Lothar.

==Description==
<Name>, I've asked the [[Sons of Lothar]] to meet us in the [[Burning Steppes]] near [[Blackrock Mountain]]. There's one more Item we must recover there.

We can depart as soon as you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It seems we have more to do here than just finding a relic.

This area is overrun with a group that calls themselves the "[[Dark Horde]]." and we are going to put a stop to their activities.

==Notes and trivia==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|I must now steal [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] and <Name> away. Arrangements have been made to find one last relic.}}
:''Arator stops forging as he walks off and Alonsus mounted up.''
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Thank you, [[Sunwalker Dezco|Dezco]]. I really admire what you're doing here. I'll be sure to return.}}
:''Arator also mounted up.''

Speak with Alonsus,
{{dialogue|This has been quite a journey so far, <Name>. Ready for the next leg?

{{gossip|quest=|Let's fly to Blackrock.}}
}}

Upon arrival at the [[Black Tooth Hovel]], [[Danath Trollbane]], [[Eitrigg]], & [[Kurdran Wildhammer]] are standing as Alonsus and Arator walk up to them.
:{{Text|Say|Kurdran Wildhammer|There you are! Faol, why'd you bring us back to this desolate place?}}

Eitrigg has a gossip
{{dialogue|<Name>, we're surrounded by Dark Horde interlopers. They have no place here. Honor demands we drive them out.

{{Gossip|How did an orc get involved with the Sons of Lothar?}}

{{dialogue-child|I fought here with [[Orgrim Doomhammer|Doomhammer]]. against [[Anduin Lothar|Lothar]]'s army, all those years ago.

It's quite strange to be working with those who bear his name...strange to be working with humans at all.

But it was a human's strangeness that changed things for me. [[Tirion Fordring]]. All I knew of humans was that they hated my people for the war we brought to their lands.

But where others saw nothing more than an animal to be hunted, Fordring saw something else. He showed me kindness and compassion, even after we tried to kill each other during our first encounter.

Through Tirion I saw humans are no different than orcs. Some have honor; many do not. Over time, I've seen that the Sons of Lothar are among those that do.

And I think Tirion would agree.}}
