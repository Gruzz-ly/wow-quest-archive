==Objectives==
Meet [[Faerin Lothar]] at [[Hammerfall]] in the [[Arathi Highlands]].

==Description==
First an attack on [[Newstead|Newstead Farm]] by [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]], now an attack on [[Refuge Pointe]] by these [[Scarlet Crusade]]rs.

Different groups of bandits, but both speak of this "Red Dawn" and carry the same emblem. 

Also, [[Joseph the Enlightened|Joseph]] is directly involved.

This all seems connected... and it leads back to Marran.

[[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] needs to know what's going on. If he's not here, he should already be at Hammerfall. 

We should head there as soon as possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
If Danath is not here... Where is he?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|If Danath did not come here, and Geya'rah did not call him to Hammerfall, then... gah.}}
:{{text|say|Karga Bloodfury|Go to Hammerfall. If your lord is not there, Geya'rah and Eitrigg can help you.}}
:''Faerin mounts up and takes off.''

Follow her northeast to Hammerfall. Faerin is at the south entrance speaking with [[Eitrigg]]:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Danath never arrived? Then... where is he?}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Ah, I do not know. But you have my word we will find him.}}

They have gossip after:
{{dialogue|title=Eitrigg|[[Overlord Geya'rah]] arrived earlier and informed us of the events at [[Newstead|Newstead Farm]]. She left to deal with a situation at [[Go'Shek Farm]].

The bandits are not the only problem on this side of [[Arathi Highlands|the Highlands]]. The [[Witherbark tribe|Witherbark trolls]] have stepped up their attacks as well.}}

{{dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|The orcs have been honorable so far. Karga even defended the refugees from a bandit attack.

They wouldn't have done something to Danath... would they?}}

==Progression==
