==Objectives==
Retrieve Trol'kalar from Trollbane's tomb in Stromgarde Keep.
* [[Sheathed Trol'kalar]]
* [[Sigil of Trollbane]] (provided)

==Description==
The last sigil is mine...and with it, the four combine to the Sigil of Trollbane, key to the tomb. We are ready.

Trol'kalar lies sealed with its master's remains, within Trollbane's tomb in the catacombs of Stromgarde. It will be defended heavily...but my presence before you is proof enough that the defenders can be overcome.

Enter the tomb, retrieve Trol'kalar, and bring it here.

==Progress==
Have you Trol'kalar?

==Completion==
Trol'kalar, my father's blade... it seems like it's been an eternity since I saw it.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Arathi Highlands!}}
