==Objectives==
Collect 12 Raptor Hearts from [[Highland Fleshstalker]]s.
*[[Raptor Heart]] (12)

==Description==
The highland fleshstalkers to the south are even fiercer than the others of their kind. They possess not just strength, but true cunning.

When I was trapped by lethargy, even the amulets of strength failed to move me. But [[Tor'gan]] used the hearts of the fleshstalkers to imbue me with spirits that conquered my doubt, freeing me.

Our soldiers deserve the guile of the raptor. Collect the fleshstalker hearts for me, <Name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Hammerfall Ring
|Hammerfall Gloves
|Hammerfall Mace
|Hammerfall Band
|Hammerfall Gauntlets
|Hammerfall Cudgel
|Hammerfall Gavel
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
My preparations are made, all I need are the raptor hearts. 

==Completion==
As Tor'gan taught me, I transfer the power and the spirit of the raptors into this orb. It will imbue our warriors with the fiery strength and intelligence of the raptor.

The guile of the raptor is yours now as well, <class>. Take it with pride, for the Horde!
