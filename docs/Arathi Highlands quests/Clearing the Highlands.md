==Objectives==
Kill 8 Boulderfist Ogres and 10 Boulderfist Enforcers.
* [[Boulderfist Ogre]] (8)
* [[Boulderfist Enforcer]] (10)

==Description==
No threat here will go overlooked. If we are to secure these lands under the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]]'s rule, we will tear from them everything living, inch by inch, piece by piece.

To the northeast, not a stone's throw away from this camp is an [[ogre mound]]. The [[Boulderfist]] ogres that dwell in it must be eradicated, <class>.

They are in the way. Show no mercy or hesitation.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||22}}
*3300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You'll learn not to bother a [[Deathstalkers|Deathstalker]] unless you have news of success in time. Until then, try to keep your mouth shut in general.

==Completion==
Excellent. The march of the Forsaken continues.

==Progression==
{{Clearing the Highlands}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Renamed from [[The Hammer May Fall]], updated.}}
