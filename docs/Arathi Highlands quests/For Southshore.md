==Objectives==
Return to [[Commander Amaren]] at [[Refuge Pointe]].

==Description==
I've seen [[Kinelory]] look way worse after a night in the tavern than she does now. You obviously did a good job protecting her.

Refuge Pointe will want to know of our success. I'm going to stay here with Kin and let her catch her breath. Go on ahead without us. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Stromgarde Surcoat
|Stromgarde Leggings
|Stromgarde Bracers
|Stromgarde Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,850 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
I admit I'm impressed, <class>. It's a small comfort amidst all that's happened here.

You have fought the undead, struck back against the Horde, and honored the memory of the victims of [[Southshore]]. On behalf of the kingdom of [[Stromgarde (kingdom)|Stromgarde]], I present you with an official commendation, and this reward.

==Progression==
{{Quae and Kinelory}}
