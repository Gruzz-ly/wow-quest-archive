==Objectives==
Take the Elven Gems to [[Shakes O'Breen|Captain O'Breen]] at [[Faldir's Cove]] in [[Arathi Highlands]].
* [[Elven Gems]] (provided)

==Description==
Let's not leave Captain O'Breen waiting. He'll want to see these gems first hand. After all, that's why we're here!

And after a few weeks of consorting with these pirates, the professor and I have realized the last thing that's good for our health is to be caught hanging on to their treasure.

Here, <name>, take these to O'Breen.

==Progress==
Ahoy, <class>. What brings you to the bridge?

==Completion==
So the little gnomes proved their worth after all? I knew we kept those ankle biters around for a reason!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|50}}.
