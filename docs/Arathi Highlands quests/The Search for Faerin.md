==Objectives==
Search the structures in Stromgarde for [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] and information on the [[Red Dawn]].
* [[Red Dawn Propaganda|Army tent]] searched {{co|15.2|61.9|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* [[Red Dawn Oaths of Loyalty|Inn basement]] searched {{co|14.5|65.0|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* Tavern searched {{co|14.2|69.3|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* Home searched {{co|16.3|68.9|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* Mage tower searched {{co|11.0|70.4|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* Faerin freed

==Description==
I saw Faerin being taken away, but couldn't follow without them seeing me. She's probably being held in another building.

Go find her. Hopefully, she's still alive...

And see if you can find any more information on the [[Red Dawn]]. There's no way we should have been overwhelmed so quickly. [[Veronica Nials|Colonel Nials]] and [[Marran Trollbane|Lady Trollbane]] must have installed their cronies everywhere.

The more information we have, the more we can use against them when we fight back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Have you found Faerin?

==Completion==
I'm glad Faerin is all right. 

And this information you've found...

<Brewston's shoulders slump.>

When people are desperate, they'll believe in any promise of a better life no matter whom it's from.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Captain Roderick Brewston|I need to rally more loyal troops. You see if you can find Faerin. We need all the help we can get!}}
:''He runs up the stairs.''

While fighting off turncoats and traitors, head west to the army tent to find a book of [[Red Dawn Propaganda]]. It reads:

{{dialogue|<This is a piece of [[Red Dawn]] propaganda.>

Many years ago, the [[Alterac (kingdom)|Alteraci]] were one of the first to set out from [[Strom]] and build a nation away from [[Arathor]].

The kingdoms of Alterac and Stromgarde have quarreled over the years, but now we must remember our shared history.

It is now time for our people to unite once more. We are not enemies, but cousins. I will take the first step in offering peace and reconciliation.

I invite the remnants of Alterac, known as the [[Syndicate]], to join the Red Dawn.

We are a faction that will fight for all humans, no matter their kingdom or creed. Let us return humanity to the glory it once had.

[[Veronica Nials]]

[[File:Red Dawn Oaths of Loyalty.jpg|thumb|[[Red Dawn Oaths of Loyalty]]]]
Just southwest on the other side of the wall is the inn. Down in the basement is a crate of [[Red Dawn Oaths of Loyalty]] scrolls. They read:
{{dialogue|<Written on these scrolls is an oath of loyalty to the Red Dawn.>

I henceforth renounce all allegiances and swear my loyalty to the Red Dawn and its leader, [[Marran Trollbane]].

I vow to serve, protect, and defend the cause of humanity to the exclusion of all else.

I promise to unite the people of Arathor once more and see them take their place as the greatest nation of [[Azeroth]].

Another book of Red Dawn Propaganda is in the tavern:
{{dialogue|<This is a piece of Red Dawn propaganda.>

The [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] have been failed by their leadership--first by the [[Edwin VanCleef|Van Cleefs]], and now by [[Duncon Ratsbon|Ratsbon]]. These charlatans have been satisfied with banditry and petty thievery. They suffer from a lack of imagination.

The Defias were founded to remove the [[House of Nobles|corrupt nobles]] of [[Stormwind]]. We were to bring justice, honesty, and integrity back to our rulers. We lost sight of that in a quest for revenge.

No longer! Now we have found a new cause and leader. One who will not only cleanse the corruption from Stormwind, but from all human kingdoms!

Rise up, my Defias brothers and sisters! Rise up like the morning sun and join the Red Dawn! Rise up and follow Lady Marran Trollbane!

{{gossip|quest=|<Collect the materials.>}}}}

A third book is in the house between the inn and the tavern:
{{dialogue|<This is a piece of Red Dawn propaganda.>

Brothers and sisters of the [[Scarlet Crusade]]! Long have we fought to eliminate the [[Scourge|scourge of undeath]] from our land! Long have we suffered defeat after defeat at their hands!

It is time for a change! We must seek out allies to help us in our glorious crusade! But more than that, we must lend our aid to those with even grander aspirations!

Let us not only save this world from the [[undead]], but make it a paradise for humans everywhere! That is what the Red Dawn stands for! That is what Marran Trollbane fights for! 

A new dawn for all humanity!

[[Joseph the Enlightened]]

[[File:The Search for Faerin.jpg|thumb|[[Faerin Lothar]] bound in the mage tower]]
Head to the mage tower in the southwest corner of the keep and run upstairs to find [[Faerin Lothar]] tied to a pillar:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|<Name>! You're alive! Help me out of these bindings.}}

Speak with her:
{{dialogue|I knew she was involved, but I can't believe Marran was the leader of the Red Dawn. 

Marran put her own people in harm's way just to create the conditions to justify her coup!

She's not fit to rule Stromgarde!

{{gossip|quest=|<Free Faerin.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|While captive, I heard Marran's plan to amass her troops at the gates. We must stop her!}}
:''Faerin runs out.''

After gathering all 20 Articles of Proof and finding Faerin, follow her to the front gate, where she, Brewston, and [[Overlord Geya'rah]] have arrived:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Sacred Flame, I'm glad you're here. You found Danath?}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|He ran ahead with Eitrigg to confront Marran. We will join the fight soon!}}
