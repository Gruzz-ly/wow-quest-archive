==Objectives==
Meet with [[Sunwalker Dezco]] in [[Hammerfall]].
*Tell Alonsus you're ready to depart.
*Speak with Sunwalker Dezco in Hammerfall

==Description==
I think I have failed [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]. In my attempt to steady him after the [[Past Redemption|incident]] with [[Turalyon|his father]], I may have shattered his faith with uncomfortable truths of the Light.

I would like to consult with the wisest person I know. [[Sunwalker Dezco]]. I did not see him with the Vanguard. [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus|Tyrosus]] told me he may be in [[Hammerfall]] providing aid to the displaced.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|11|70}}
*12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[An'she]] has guided you to us, <name>. Care to join us in our work?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|I spoke to you of finding a different path, Arator. I think it's time we started on it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|All right... But if this lesson is anything like the others--}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Oh, don't worry. This one won't be imparted by me.}}

Speak to Alonsus Faol:
{{dialogue|<Name>, your help has been invaluable to the Sunwell. But there is more we must do to help Arator.

Would you come with us to visit a friend in Hammerfall?

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell Faol you are ready to go to Hammerfall.>}}
}}

Alonsus Faol uses the [[Grimoire of Teleportation]] to open the portal.

Use the portal to go to Hammerfall.

Meet up with Arator and Alonsus.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Hammerfall? Is this about the [[Red Dawn]]?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Quite the opposite. We're going to see someone who is doing something wonderful. Something I failed to accomplish.}}

;Upon walking to Sunwalker Dezco
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|One moment, this post is being stubborn.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|Faol! What brings you and your friends to Hammerfall? Please tell me the world isn't ending again.}}

Dezco has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Thank you for aiding Hammerfall, <name>.}}
