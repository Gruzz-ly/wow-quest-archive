==Objectives==
Eliminate [[Syndicate]] soldiers and save trapped civilians in [[Hammerfall]].
* Retake Hammerfall (0/100%)

==Description==
<[[Eitrigg]] growls in frustration.>

I was such a fool!

I should not have sent away those outriders. Without them, the Syndicate have overrun Hammerfall.

And were it not for my fool heart... The "refugees" turned out to be Syndicate spies, curse their greasy hides...

But now you're here. Now, we can force the Syndicate out. Eliminate their soldiers and save any trapped civilians. 

Those spies have had enough of my open hand. Now they'll suffer my fists!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The Syndicate...

I haven't seen them in this number in many years.

==Completion==
There are still Syndicate stragglers about, but Hammerfall once again belongs to the Horde!

==Notes==
Accept all three quests:

Civilians are marked on the minimap, in or the burning buildings:

After finishing all three quests, head to Eitrigg, Geya'rah, and Faerin at the rear gate.
