==Objectives==
Find Trelane's Phylactery, Trelane's Orb, and Trelane's Ember Agate, and return them to [[Skuerto]] at [[Refuge Pointe]].
* [[Trelane's Phylactery]]
* [[Trelane's Orb]]
* [[Trelane's Ember Agate]]

==Description==
Here's what your lookin' for: Trelane's phylactery, Trelane's orb, an' Trelane's ember agate.

All three should be in chests within the tower.  You shouldn't have a problem opening the chests on your own; you just have to be careful of the ogres.

You'll need to have your weapons at the ready. Those ogres find out you're there and stealing from them, and they'll be sure to put the hurt on you.

Be careful, and good luck.

==Completion==
Malin couldn't've asked a worthier person to come here an' aid us, <name>. You've done a grand job!
