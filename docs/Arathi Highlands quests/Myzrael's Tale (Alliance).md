==Objectives==
Return to [[Skuerto]] at [[Refuge Pointe]] in [[Arathi Highlands]].

==Description==
As the stone goes quiet, you're left with a vague sense of unease. Something isn't right.

Perhaps you should tell Skuerto of what you've done so far.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1100}} (or {{coppercost|660}} at max level)

==Completion==
Say no more, <name>. I followed up with an... "old friend" while you were gone. I should've known better than to send you to those shards.

We've both made a grave mistake in involving ourselves in this. Luckily, I "persuaded" my boy Gerrig to tell me what to do if this happened. 

==Gains==
You will receive:
*1100 XP (or {{coppercost|660}} at max level)
*75 reputation with [[Ironforge]]

==Progression==
{{The Princess Trapped}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
