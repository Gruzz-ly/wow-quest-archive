==Objectives==
Gather 4 Fallen Longswords and 4 Forgotten Skullcleavers.
*[[Fallen Longsword]] (4)
*[[Forgotten Skullcleaver]] (4)

==Description==
<Name>, now that [[Hammerfall]] can expect peace with [[Stromgarde]], there's a lot more use in being able to farm and craft than in fighting.

So we've been gathering old weapons from past skirmishes to make into tools for the people of Hammerfall.

Would you and [[Arator]] be willing to give me a hand?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The weapons we gather will help reforge Hammerfall's future, <name>.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. We'll get these reforged into tools, and distribute them to the people.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|The discarded weapons of past wars litter the fields and complicate farming.}}
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|<Name>, if you would gather what you can, [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] and I will prepare the forge.}}

Around the area near Hammerfall, collect the 4 [[Fallen Longsword]]s & the 4 [[Forgotten Skullcleaver]]s and return to Hammerfall.
:{{Text|Say|Sunwalker Dezco|The fields are cleared of scrap metal, we'll make something useful of this refuse.}}
