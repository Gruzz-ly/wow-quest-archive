==Objectives==
Meet [[Overlord Geya'rah]] at the [[Arathi Highlands]] crossroads.

==Description==
My [[outrider]]s discovered a destroyed [[caravan]] on the road.

Around it were the bodies of [[Stromgarde (kingdom)|Stromic]] soldiers.

It could be [[Danath Trollbane|Danath's]] escort. Or it could be another hapless group.

Either way, we must investigate. Let us hope Danath is not among the dead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This wasn't a battle. It was an ambush and a massacre.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|The [[Syndicate]] is in retreat.}}
:{{text|say|[[Eitrigg]]|Good. Now let's find Danath and punish those behind his disappearance.}}
:''Eitrigg, Geya'rah, and [[Faerin]] hop on their mounts and leave Hammerfall.''

Head to the central crossroads where the trio are investigating an attack. Numerous dead [[Stromgarde Footman|Stromgarde footmen]] and [[Stromgarde Horse|their horses]] litter the ground. Bloodstains, arrows, and orcish axes show how the ambush played out.
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|These look like orc weapons. Why would your people attack Danath?}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|No, they would not. Something is wrong here.}}
