==Objectives==
Doctor Draxlegauge in Faldir's Cove wants you to collect 10 Elven Gems and return the Goggles of Gem Hunting once you are done.
* [[Elven Gem]] (10)
* [[Goggles of Gem Hunting]] (provided)

==Description==
The treasure has been on the sea floor so long that the gems have calcified into thick stone. But the power harnessed in these goggles will allow you to locate them easily.

A little gnomish ingenuity goes a long way!

So borrow the Goggles of Gem Hunting, <name>, and see if you can collect some of the lost treasure for [[Shakes O'Breen|Captain O'Breen]].

I'd swim down there myself but...um...well, I have important scientific business to tend to up on the safe, dry land....er, yeah.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Draxlegauge Ring
|Bottom Waders
|Decalcified Elven Spear
|Chain Weighted Shoes
|Waterlogged Elven Spear
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]

Reputation gains:
* +350 [[Booty Bay]]
* +175 [[Gadgetzan]]
* +175 [[Ratchet]]
* +175 [[Everlook]]
* -350 [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]

==Progress==
How did the goggles work? Did everything function properly? Adjustments can be made if necessary.

Oh, and I'll need those goggles back when you're done. I am sure Captain O'Breen will have many uses for them later on.

==Completion==
Most superb, <name>! The Captain will be very pleased! And just wait until word gets back to [[Fleetmaster Seahorn]]!

== Notes ==
Accepting this quest grants you the half-hour buff "Blackwater Boon" that provides water breathing and increases swim speed.
