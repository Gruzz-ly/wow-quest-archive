==Objectives==
Summon and defeat [[Myzrael]] at the [[Shards of Myzrael]].
*[[Eldritch Shackles]]
*Suggested players: 2
*[[Scroll of Myzrael]] (provided)

==Description==
Myzrael is a deceiver. She is an ancient force sealed long ago, and must be kept that way.

You must confront her at the Shards of Myzrael where you first spoke with her. Summon her with this scroll, and when she has been fully brought to the surface, defeat her. Then take the Eldritch Shackles from her body and place them on the Shards to keep her fully bound once more.

Good luck, <name>... may my past trouble you no more. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wrap of Open Menace
|Eldritch Gloves
|Earthbound Mantle
|Shackling Gloves
|Mantle of the Bound
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Shards of Myzrael are now strangely quiet. 

==Completion==
As the eldritch shackles are placed around the Shards, an unhuman wail is heard from far below.  The scream is followed by a roar.

The Shards of Myzrael no longer invoke feelings of warmth and security as they once did.  Now they pulse with an open menace... as if the thing beneath them holds ill will toward the surface.
