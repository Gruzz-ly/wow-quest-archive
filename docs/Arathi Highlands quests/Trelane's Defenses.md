==Objectives==
Find an Azure Agate and bring it to [[Apprentice Kryten]] at [[Stromgarde Keep]].
*[[Azure Agate]]

==Description==
All rested?

Here's our next step: there're ogres all around the Tower of Arathor in Stromgarde. We're gonna need to ward you against the tower's defenses. To do that, we're gonna need some gems the Boulderfist shaman have taken a liking to. They took 'em from the tower, but they're not gonna stay in their possession for long.

Get one of them gems an' bring 'em to [[Apprentice Kryten|Kryten]]--he knows the spell to enchant it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3300 [[XP]] 
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
<Name>, hello again. Have you found an azure agate yet? 

==Completion==
You amaze me, <name>. Well done again.

Give me a moment to cast the proper spell to enchant the gem, an' you'll be ready. 

==Notes==
Azure Agates drop from [[Boulderfist Shaman]] in [[Arathi Highlands]].
