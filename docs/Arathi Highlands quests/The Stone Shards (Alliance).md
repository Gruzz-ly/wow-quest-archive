==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Shards of Myzrael]].

==Description==
I've scouted all over these highlands, <name>, and there's one thing I've found I haven't been able to explain.

To the northeast of here, there's a circle of stones, like the others you'll find everywhere in [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]]... but the largest and most imposing of them, built into the mountainside itself.

Just between you and me, I heard voices while I was there. Whispers of the earth. If you're the curious type, you could go see for yourself...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The shards pulse softly, and a whisper slowly echoes through your head.>

Help...

==Progression==
{{The Princess Trapped}}
