==Objectives==
Investigate the area for clues as to [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]]'s disappearance.
* [[Orcish Axe]] investigated
* [[Dead Horse (Arathi Highlands)|Dead Horse]] investigated
* [[Suspicious Dirt]] investigated
* Speak to [[Overlord Geya'rah]]
* Listen to the conversation

==Description==
This was not done by simple bandits. This spot was chosen specifically for an ambush. And these troops were taken down quickly and efficiently.

If Danath was heading to [[Hammerfall]], this road is the most direct route. That makes it predictable.

<Geya'rah grimaces.>

We must search for Danath among the dead and find out what happened here. Leave no stone left unturned.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
It is decided then.

If we are to prevent war, we must alert the Alliance to the situation and rescue Danath as quickly as possible.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Overlord Geya'rah|This was no random attack. Whoever did this knew exactly where and how to strike.}}

Interact with the axe near [[Eitrigg]] at the east end:
{{Dialogue|<This axe appears orcish in origin but is otherwise unfamiliar. It is not in the same style as the ones used by the orcs of Hammerfall. It has also not been well maintained. In fact, it does not look fit to be used in combat.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell the others what you've discovered.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|That axe was forged at [[Ar'gorok]]. We abandoned many like it with the fortress at the end of the [[Fourth War|last war]].}}

Interact with the dead horse near [[Overlord Geya'rah]] in the middle:
{{Dialogue|<This horse was killed swiftly and suddenly. It appears the rider fell but recovered quickly. They seem to have fought off several enemies before being overwhelmed.

However, there is no body here. Given its position in the column, perhaps it was [[Danath]]'s horse?>

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell the others what you've discovered.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Overlord Geya'rah|Danath is not among the dead. He was overwhelmed and abducted. No easy feat--for his opponent.}}

Interact with the Suspicious Dirt near [[Faerin Lothar]] to the west:
{{Dialogue|<You spot a small object half-buried in the dirt. When you brush the dirt off. you recognize a [[Red Dawn]] emblem--Just like the ones you saw before. It seems someone lost this amidst the chaos of the ambush.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell the others what you've discovered.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|We've seen that emblem twice before. Was this the work of the Red Dawn?}}

Return to Geya'rah and speak with her:
{{Dialogue|There are clearly signs of battle, but something is wrong here...

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask the others what they think.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Overlord Geya'rah|If we had taken Danath, we would not have left our axes behind.}}
:''Eitrigg and Faerin walk towards Geya'rah.''
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|The Syndicate brothers must have taken them from Ar'gorok and planted them for the Red Dawn. But why?}}
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|To start a war that would destroy both [[Stromgarde]] and [[Hammerfall]]. And leave them in power.}}
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|Then we must search for Danath--starting at Ar'gorok. And alert Stromgarde of what we've found.}}
