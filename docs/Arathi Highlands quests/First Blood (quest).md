==Objectives==
Collect 10 Bloodstone Amulets from [[Syndicate Mercenary|Syndicate Mercenaries]].
* [[Bloodstone Amulet]] (10)

==Description==
Be prepared, <Name>. You will cast the first blood upon this land for us.

The [[Syndicate]], as they call themselves, are cowardly humans who betray even their own kind. Their isolation will make them easy prey.

Travel north, slay any Syndicate mercenaries you find, and claim [[Northfold Manor]] in the name of the [[Forsaken]]. Bring me the Bloodstone Amulets they wear as proof of your conquest. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||22}}

==Progress==
I won't be swayed by empty claims. Have you proof of your loyalty?

==Completion==
This is but a prelude to the slaughter we will visit upon these lands. All will know our name.

You have done well, <name>. Victory for Sylvanas!

==Progression==
