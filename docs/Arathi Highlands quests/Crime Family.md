[[File:Crime Family.jpg|thumb|[[Perry]] about to be sacrificed at [[Witherbark Village]]]]

==Objectives==
Save Crestor, Holt, and Perry from the [[Witherbark tribe|Witherbark trolls]] in [[Witherbark Village]].
* [[Perry]] saved {{co|63.9|72.6|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* [[Holt]] saved {{co|68.2|67.5|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* [[Crestor]] saved {{co|66.5|61.3|Arathi Highlands||1}}

==Description==
[[Barclay|This Syndicate human]] came to us hoping to trade information for a rescue mission. The [[Syndicate]] is a recent thorn in our side, so I had half a mind to cut him down where he stood. 

But he claims to have vital information, and with this news of [[Danath Trollbane|Danath's]] disappearance... it might be worth the risk to do as he asks.

He has three brothers being held captive inside Witherbark Village. Go in, find them, and if they're alive, extract them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Valorstones]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You'd better move quickly. Witherbark don't keep prisoners for long.

==Completion==
Barclay is lucky you reached his brothers in time.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Text|Say|[[Faerin Lothar]]|The [[Witherbark tribe|Witherbark]]? As in the [[Amani]] Witherbark? The Arathi's ancient foe...}}
:''Faerin mounts on her horse.''
:{{Text|Say|Faerin Lothar|Come, <name>. I will need your help.}}
:''Faerin rides off.''

Head southeast to [[Witherbark Village]]. While clearing trolls, find [[Perry]] strapped to an altar south of the lake:
:{{Text|Say|Perry|Help! This troll is draining my soul!}}

Speak with him:
{{Dialogue|I don't want to live in some cramped soul shard all my life!

{{gossip|<Press the prisoner for information.>}}
{{dialogue-child|Look, I was just doing my job! We were told we had to attack the Witherbark and plant evidence that the Horde was responsible!

Something about drawing away [[Hammerfall]]'s defenders! Now please let me go!

{{gossip|quest=|<Free the Syndicate prisoner.>}}
}}
{{gossip|quest=|<Free the Syndicate prisoner.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Perry|I won't plant evidence against the Horde ever again! I promise!}}

[[Holt]] is east of the lake taking a comfortable bath in the cauldron to the northeast:
:{{Text|Say|Holt|I'm being cooked! Help me!}}

Speak with him:
{{Dialogue|HELP ME OUT OF THIS POT!

<The water isn't even boiling, just a little warm.>

{{gossip|<Press the prisoner for information.>}}
{{dialogue-child|I told them us Syndicate folks joining that [[Red Dawn]] group was a bad idea!

Working with bandits like the [[Defias]] and lunatics like the [[Scarlet Crusade]]--the Syndicate are more respectable than that!

{{gossip|quest=|<Free the Syndicate prisoner.>}}
}}
{{gossip|quest=|<Free the Syndicate prisoner.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Holt|That's it! No more Syndicate, no more Red Dawn!}}

[[Crestor]] is north of the lake, tied up on the gong with a number of thrown axes on the ground near him:
:{{Text|Say|Crestor|Please help! They're using me for target practice!}}

Speak with him:
{{Dialogue|It's awful! They've been throwing axes at this gong all day! I HATE gongs!

{{gossip|<Press the prisoner for information.>}}
{{dialogue-child|I told my brothers we picked the wrong assignment!

I wanted to infiltrate Hammerfall and spy on the orcs like the others! But no. my brothers thought that was too dangerous!

{{gossip|quest=|<Free the Syndicate prisoner.>}}
}}
{{gossip|quest=|<Free the Syndicate prisoner.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Crestor|I should have agreed to pretend to be a refugee!}}

Return to [[Go'Shek Farm]], where Overlord Geya'rah is threatening Barclay. The other Syndicate members have returned as well:
:{{Text|Say|Overlord Geya'rah|If you are lying to me, human... this day will be your last!}}
:{{Text|Say|Barclay|I'm not, I'm--I swear! The Syndicate is on their way to attack Hammerfall--for the Red Dawn!}}

==Progression==
{{Rise of the Red Dawn}}
