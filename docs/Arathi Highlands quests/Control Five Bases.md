==Objectives==
Control 5 bases in [[Arathi Basin]] at the same time, then return to [[Field Marshal Oslight]] at [[Refuge Pointe]].
*Take Five Bases.

==Description==
<Name>, battling for the resources of Arathi Basin is a bloody undertaking. Your services to the [[League of Arathor]] are needed as they are appreciated.

And we have one more task for you.

The League wishes to make one strong push against the [[Defilers]]' occupation of Arathi Basin. We want them driven out of every strategic point on the battlefield!

It will not be easy, but if anyone can get it done, it is you.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You receive|Arathor Battle Tabard}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70}}

==Progress==
You have not yet completed your mission, <name>.  It is difficult, but my faith in you is strong.

==Completion==
You did it!  You took all of the bases!  Well done, <name>!

There were those who doubted your chances, but I knew you could do it.  Thank you, and know that the League of Arathor holds you in high regard, just as the Defilers of the [[Forsaken]] must fear the very mention of your name!
