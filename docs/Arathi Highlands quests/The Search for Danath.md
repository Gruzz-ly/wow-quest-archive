==Objectives==
Search the structures in [[Ar'gorok]] for [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] and information on the [[Red Dawn]].
* Altar of Storms searched
* Workshop searched
* Great Hall searched
* Armory searched
* Barracks searched

==Description==
Using Ar'gorok as a base was clever. Very clever.

It looks like the bulk of their forces are here. If Danath is alive, I'm certain they would keep him here.

Search the buildings for him. And look for any information on this Red Dawn that you can. Anything might be helpful in taking them down. 

Let's hope Danath is alive. If he isn't, a long and bloody conflict is ahead of us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You found a key?

Just what I need.

The [[Red Dawn Oaths of Loyalty]] is found in the [[Altar of Storms]].
{{dialogue|<Written on these scrolls is an oath of loyalty to the Red Dawn.>

I henceforth renounce all allegiances and swear my loyalty to the Red Dawn and its leader. Marran Trollbane.

I vow to serve, protect, and defend the cause of humanity to the exclusion of all else.

I promise to unite the people of Arathor once more and see them take their place as the greatest nation of Azeroth.

The [[Red Dawn Propaganda]] is found in the [[Great Hall]]
{{dialogue|<This is a piece of Red Dawn propaganda.>

Brothers and sisters of the [[Scarlet Crusade]]! Long have we fought to eliminate the scourge of undeath from our land! Long have we suffered defeat after defeat at their hands!

It is time for a change! We must seek out allies to help us in our glorious crusade! But more than that, we must lend our aid to those with even grander aspirations!

Let us not only save this world from the undead, but make it a paradise for humans everywhere! That is what the Red Dawn stands for! That is what [[Marran Trollbane]] fights for!

A new dawn for all humanity!

Another of the Red Dawn Propaganda is found at the Armory,
{{dialogue|<This is a piece of Red Dawn propaganda.>

Many years ago, the Alteraci were one of the first to set out from Strom and build a nation away from Arathor.

The kingdoms of Alterac and Stromgarde have quarreled over the years, but now we must remember our shared history.

It is now time for our people to unite once more. We are not enemies, but cousins. I will take the first step in offering peace and reconciliation.

I invite the remnants of [[Alterac (kingdom)|Alterac]], known as the Syndicate, to join the Red Dawn.

We are a faction that will fight for all humans, no matter their kingdom or creed. Let us return humanity to the glory it once had.

The third Red Dawn Propaganda is at the Workshop.
{{dialogue|<This is a piece of Red Dawn propaganda.>

The Defias have been failed by their leadership--first by the Van Cleefs, and now by [[Duncon Ratsbon|Ratsbon]]. These charlatans have been satisfied with banditry and petty thievery. They suffer from a lack of Imagination.

The Defias were founded to remove the corrupt nobles of Stormwind. We were to bring justice, honesty, and integrity back to our rulers. We lost sight of that in a quest for revenge.

No longer! Now we have found a new cause and leader. One who will not only cleanse the corruption from Stormwind, but from all human kingdoms!

Rise up, my Defias brothers and sisters! Rise up like the morning sun and join the Red Dawn! Rise up and follow Lady Marran Trollbane!

Head to the Ar'gorok prison beneath the Barracks and meet up with Eitrigg and Overlord Geya'rah to turn in both quests as they found Danath in his cell.
:{{Text|Say|Danath Trollbane|Just...smash it open, Eitrigg!}}
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|If an orc prison couldn't withstand an orc, it wouldn't be worth much now would it, Danath?}}

Upon completing both quests, the [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] "Eitrigg Rescues Danath" plays:
:''Eitrigg walks to the cell door and begins to unlock it.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|They wouldn't kill me. Left me to rot. Cowards.}}
:''[[Eitrigg]] opens the cell door.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|How did you find me?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|The Red Dawn left orc weapons at the ambush to fool your people.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|But they did not fool us. We knew  the weapons came from [[Ar'gorok]].}}
:''Danath walks towards his sword and picks it up.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Geya'rah, Eitrigg--your honor humbles me. You didn't...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|No time to get sappy on us, Danath. We've seen what's coming.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|Faerin went to warn your people.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Then she is in grave danger!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Only someone in Stromgarde,... someone close to me... could have orchestrated the ambush.}}
:''Eitrigg grabs his axe.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Eitrigg|Then we must go to her aid.}}
