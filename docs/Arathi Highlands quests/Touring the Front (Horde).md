==Objectives==
Report to Foreman Drogg, Graul, and Flightgineer Krazzle.
* Check on [[Foreman Drogg]]
* Check on [[Graul]]
* View the battleground with [[Flightgineer Krazzle]]

==Description==
The [[Alliance]] haven't attacked for a while now. Neither have we, actually. It should be safe to head on out and do some scouting.

Check in with our foremen at the [[mine]] and the [[lumber mill]]. It'd be good to know that they haven't gone and gotten themselves killed, and the trip should give you a bit of a lay of the land.

Speaking of which, you might also talk to Flightgineer Krazzle. He can give you a quick look at [[Stromgarde]], so you can see what we're up against.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hey hey.

==Completion==
You're back from your tour? And nobody's been slaughtered by the Alliance? Nice.

Glad you could make it back safely too, <name>.
