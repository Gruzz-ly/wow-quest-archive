==Objectives==
Collect 5 Sigil Fragments from Stromgarde defenders in [[Stromgarde Keep]].
* [[Sigil Fragment]] (5)

==Description==
In life, I divided the sigil of [[Thoradin]] into five pieces to protect it, spreading it among my most loyal men. This too failed, but my successor will have done the same.

The [[Stromgarde Militia|defenders of Stromgarde]] hold the pieces of the sigil yet again. Slay them, and bring the shards to me; I will reassemble them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||22}}

==Progress==
All five pieces are needed to restore the sigil...

==Completion==
Thoradin was the founder of [[Arathor]]. Just as I join these fragments together, he joined the scattered tribes of humans into their first great nation.

But I'm sure you're not interested in such drivel. Forgive me. Old memories are often hard to bury.
