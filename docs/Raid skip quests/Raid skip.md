# Raid skip

'''Raid skips''' allow [[guild]]s or [[player]]s who are farming the end [[boss]] in a [[raid]] to be able to skip closer to that boss after completing some tasks over a multiple-week period. Skips are [[warband]]-wide once unlocked, though nearly all skip quests are per-[[character]]. Raid skips were introduced in {{g|wod}}. Starting in [[patch 11.1.0]], new raid skips moved to a [[Renown]]-based system.

==Raids with skips==
;{{g|mists}}
*[[Siege of Orgrimmar (instance)|Siege of Orgrimmar]]: Defeat [[Garrosh Hellscream (tactics)|Garrosh Hellscream]] once on Mythic difficulty, and [[Scroll of Past Deeds|a scroll]] will appear behind [[Lorewalker Cho]] at the entrance for subsequent runs to teleport directly to him. This was added 10 years after the raid in [[patch 10.1.5]]
