'''The Emerald Nightmare: Piercing the Veil''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Emerald Nightmare (instance)|Emerald Nightmare]]. Defeat [[Cenarius (tactics)|Cenarius]] four times to unlock a skip directly to Cenarius after defeating [[Nythendra]].

As with other raid skip quests, completing this quest on a higher difficulty automatically unlocks the lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Essences of Clarity from [[Cenarius (tactics)|Cenarius]] in [[Emerald Nightmare (instance)|The Emerald Nightmare]] on <Mythic / Heroic / Normal> difficulty.
* [[Essence of Clarity]] (4)

==Description==
The darkness of the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]] is like a heavy shroud, warping reality and altering the perception of all living things. As areas of the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]] are cleansed, [[Xavius]]'s hold weakens, and the way to the heart of the Nightmare will be revealed. But there might be a more direct way... my teacher once spoke of a pure power that could illuminate the darkness of the Nightmare, and allow all paths to become clear. But alas, [[Cenarius]] is lost....

==Rewards==
You will learn: Waking Dream

You will also receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If only Cenarius were with us, we could confront Xavius at once.

==Completion==
Incredible... where did you find these? With these Essences, I will be able to open the way directly to the heart of the Nightmare. Let us make haste!

==Patch changes==
