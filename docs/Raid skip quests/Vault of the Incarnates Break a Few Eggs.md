'''Vault of the Incarnates: Break a Few Eggs''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Vault of the Incarnates]]. Defeat [[Broodkeeper Diurna]] three times to unlock a skip to Diurna after defeating [[Eranog]].

As with other raid skip quests, completing this on a higher difficulty will automatically unlock the lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 3 Shards of the Greatstaff from [[Broodkeeper Diurna]] within the [[Vault of the Incarnates]] on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> Difficulty.
* [[Shard of the Greatstaff]] (3)

==Description==
Broodkeeper Diurna is somewhere within this fortress, no doubt watching over the vault from her chamber. If you can claim pieces of her greatstaff, it should allow us to assault her lair directly.

Three should be enough. Four seems excessive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The power contained in these shards will allow us to quickly access The [[Clutchwarren]].

==Completion==
These should allow us to ascend to Diurna's chamber more readily.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
