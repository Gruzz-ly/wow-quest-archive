'''The Nighthold: Talisman of the Shal'dorei''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for the [[Nighthold (instance)|Nighthold]]. Defeat [[Grand Magistrix Elisande (tactics)|Grand Magistrix Elisande]] four times to open a teleporter immediately after zoning into the raid to skip directly to her.

As with other raid skip quests, completing a higher-difficulty version of this quest automatically unlocks the lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Echoes of Time from Elisande in [[Nighthold (instance)|The Nighthold]] on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> Difficulty.
* [[Echo of Time]] (4)

==Description==
When the [[Nighthold]] was built, my people forged a talisman that allowed access to these halls. With the talisman's power, one could traverse the palace unhindered, taking the fight directly to the [[Elisande|magistrix]]. Using fragments of the [[Nightwell]]'s power, we could locate the talisman and end this foolish war...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{Versions/RaidLoot|Talisman of the Shal'dorei|no-rf=|m=1}}
*{{cost|40|44}}
*7,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Without the talisman we must fight through the city proper.

==Completion==
The power these fragments hold will allow me to call the talisman to us. Well done!

==Patch changes==
