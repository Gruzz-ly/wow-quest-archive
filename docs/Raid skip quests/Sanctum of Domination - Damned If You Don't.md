'''Sanctum of Domination - Damned If You Don't''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Sanctum of Domination]]. Defeat [[Kel'Thuzad (Sanctum of Domination tactics)|Kel'Thuzad]] four times in the same difficulty to unlock a shortcut to Kel'Thuzad again in future resets. There are three versions of this quest, one for each non-Raid Finder difficulty, and they all track progress separately. However, should players skip ahead and kill four times on Mythic, they will unlock the shortcuts on Normal and Heroic.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Phylactery Shards from Kel'Thuzad within the [[Sanctum of Domination]] on <Normal / Heroic / Mythic> Difficulty.
* [[Phylactery Shard]] (4)

==Description==
I feel [[Kel'Thuzad]]'s presence in these halls. Claim shards from his phylactery and I'll be able to open a new pathway into his chambers. Four shards should be enough. We wouldn't want him coming back again would we?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Four shards should allow us to access his chamber.

==Completion==
This should help us gain access to his chamber more readily.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
