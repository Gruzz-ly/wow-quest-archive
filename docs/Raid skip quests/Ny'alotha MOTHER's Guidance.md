'''Ny'alotha: MOTHER's Guidance''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Ny'alotha, the Waking City]]. Defeat the three wing bosses four times to open the blocked path between [[Wrathion, the Black Emperor]] and the [[Carapace of N'Zoth]]. By virtue of Wrathion only offering this quest at the Carapace encounter, this quest will take five weeks to complete.

As with other raid skip quests, completing higher-difficulty versions of this quest will automatically unlock lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Titan Cores from [[Ra-den the Despoiled|Ra-Den]],{{sic}} 4 Dragon Hearts from [[Vexiona (tactics)|Vexiona]] and 4 Prophetic Eyes from [[Il'gynoth, Corruption Reborn|Il'gynoth]] within [[Ny'alotha, the Waking City]] on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> Difficulty.
* [[Titan Core]] (4)
* [[Prophetic Eye]] (4)
* [[Dragon Heart]] (4)

==Description==
Ny'alotha does not obey the rules of space and [[time]], and we may be able to use this to our advantage.

[[MOTHER]] theorizes that if we obtain specific objects from [[N'Zoth]]'s chosen, we can utilize them to bend space and expedite our passage here in the future. Though, it is doubtful they will relinquish these items willingly. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Without the items MOTHER cannot guarantee safe passage.

==Completion==
With these items, MOTHER can guarantee safe access to this area.

==Notes==
This quest is obtained from [[Wrathion]] upon reaching the [[Carapace of N'Zoth]]. Unlike most skip quests, it can only be obtained after killing the bosses it requires.

===PTR version===

;Objectives
Collect 4 Corrupted Flesh Samples from the [[Carapace of N'Zoth]] in [[Ny'alotha, the Waking City]] on <Normal / Heroic> Difficulty.
*[[Corrupted Flesh Samples]] (4)

;Description
We stand before this monstrosity.

[[MOTHER]] says she is almost ready with calculations to allow us expedient passage here in the future but we need samples taken from [[N'Zoth]]'s flesh.

;Progress
Without the samples MOTHER cannot guarantee safe passage.
