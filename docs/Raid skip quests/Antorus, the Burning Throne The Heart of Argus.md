'''Antorus, the Burning Throne: The Heart of Argus''' is the second of two [[raid skip]] quests for [[Antorus, the Burning Throne]] after [[Antorus, the Burning Throne: Dark Passage]]. Defeat [[Aggramar (tactics)|Aggramar]] four times to unlock the teleporter after the [[Garothi Worldbreaker]] to skip directly to him.

As with other raid skip quests, completing higher-difficulty versions of this quest automatically unlocks lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Sigils of the Dark Titan from [[Aggramar]] in [[Antorus, the Burning Throne]] on <Normal / Heroic / Mythic> Difficulty.
* [[Sigil of the Dark Titan]] (4)

==Description==
[[Hatuun]] tells me that after [[Argus]] fell, [[Sargeras]] ordered a temple of darkness to be built deep within the planet's core. Little is known of it, for only the [[titan]]'s most devoted acolytes are given sigils that permit entrance.

If we lay claim to these sigils, they could be infused into the [[Vindicaar]]. This would allow our forces to stage a direct assault upon the fetid heart of Argus.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you located the sigils?

==Completion==
With these sigils, the Vindicaar can bypass the Burning Throne's defenses.

The time has come to press our advantage and end this war.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.3.2|note=Added.}}
