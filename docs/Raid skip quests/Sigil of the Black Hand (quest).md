'''Sigil of the Black Hand''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Blackrock Foundry]]. Find [[Goraluk Anvilcrack (alternate universe)|Goraluk Anvilcrack]] in the [[Dread Grotto]] after defeating the [[Iron Maidens]]. By virtue of having to kill the Iron Maidens to access him, this quest would normally take five weeks. This raid skip quest is warband-wide, so multiple alts can complete the quest in one lockout if they all complete the raid.

Once complete, players can interact with an object immediately after zoning in to open the gate directly to [[Blackhand (tactics)|Blackhand]]. Completing the quest on a higher difficulty will automatically grant the skip on lower difficulties as well.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Embers of the Mountain, 4 Hearts of Stone, and 4 Shards of Iron from the final bosses of each wing of the [[Blackrock Foundry]] on Normal/Heroic/Mythic difficulty.
* [[Ember of the Mountain]] (4)
* [[Heart of Stone]] (4)
* [[Sliver of Iron]] (4)

==Description==
<Goraluk sighs with... relief? ...or perhaps regret?>

Once I walked these halls with pride, holding my head high as an orc of the Blackrock clan. But this is a wrong path. Our hammers were meant to craft axes, swords... not these machines from [[Garrosh Hellscream|the stranger's]] whispers.

The Warlord will not be swayed, but by force. If you can retrieve essences from the Foundry's most powerful guardians, I can craft for you a sigil that will permit direct access to Blackhand's Crucible.

==Rewards==
The following spell will be cast on you: [[Sigil of the Black Hand]]

You will also receive: {{cost|61|60}}

==Progress==
I will require essences from each of the Foundry's guardians if this is to work.

==Completion==
You have done it!

<Goraluk takes the items from your hands, and turns his back for a few moments>

Now, I will touch this Sigil to your hand, and the entrance to the Crucible will open at your touch. Good luck.

== Notes ==
[[Goraluk Anvilcrack (alternate universe)|Goraluk Anvilcrack]] can only be reached once the [[Iron Maidens]] have been defeated.

The quest items drop from the last boss in each wing:
* [[Ember of the Mountain]] from [[The Blast Furnace]]
* [[Heart of Stone]] from [[Kromog]]
* [[Sliver of Iron]] from the [[Iron Maidens]]
