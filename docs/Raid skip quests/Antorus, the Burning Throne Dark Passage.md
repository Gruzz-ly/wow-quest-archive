'''Antorus, the Burning Throne: Dark Passage''' is the first of two [[raid skip]] quests for [[Antorus, the Burning Throne]]. Defeat [[Imonar the Soulhunter]] four times to open the teleporter to Imonar after defeating the [[Garothi Worldbreaker]]. The raid also has [[Antorus, the Burning Throne: The Heart of Argus]], requiring four [[Aggramar]] kills.

As with other raid skip quests, completing higher-difficulty versions of this quest automatically unlocks the lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Runes of Passage from [[Imonar the Soulhunter]] in [[Antorus, the Burning Throne]] on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> Difficulty. 
* [[Rune of Passage]] (4)

==Description==
Despite the dangerous energies pulsing out from the heart of [[Argus]], the Soulhunter travels unhindered through the Burning Throne. Our scouts report that his vessel harnesses the power of demonic runes to safely reach the [[Hallowed Felworks]].

If we obtain those runes, it would allow the [[Vindicaar]] to follow the same route. This could save our forces valuable time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Without the runes, we must face Sargeras' army head on.

==Completion==
Magnificent work!

Once these runes are integrated into our shielding matrix, the [[Vindicaar]] will be able to bypass the Burning Throne's defenses and strike directly at the felworks.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.3.0|note=Added.}}
