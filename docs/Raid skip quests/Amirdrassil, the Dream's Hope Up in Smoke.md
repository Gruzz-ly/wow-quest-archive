'''Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope: Up in Smoke''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]]. Defeat [[Smolderon (tactics)|Smolderon]] in [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]] three times on the same difficulty to be able to skip directly to Smolderon from [[Igira the Cruel]].

As with other raid skip quests, completing this on higher difficulties will automatically unlock lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 3 Fragments of Emberscar from [[Smolderon (tactics)|Smolderon]] within [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]] on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> difficulty.

{{Versions/RaidLoot|Fragment of Emberscar|m=1|no-rf=}}

==Description==
Smolderon appears to be aiding [[Fyrakk the Blazing|Fyrakk's]] assault on [[Emerald Dream (zone)|the Dream]]! If you collect some fragments of [[Emberscar]], his legendary weapon, we may be able to attune with his energy and assault his throne directly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The energy found within these fragments will allow us to quickly access the Throne of the Firelord.

==Completion==
These should grant us access to Smolderon's throne more easily.

==Progression==
{{A Dream of Fields and Fire}}

==Patch changes==
