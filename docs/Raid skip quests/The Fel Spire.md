'''The Fel Spire''' is the second of two [[raid skip]] quests in {{au|Hellfire Citadel}}. After first defeating [[Gorefiend]] four times for [[Well of Souls (quest)]], Khadgar will turn around and offer this quest, requiring four more weeks of Mannoroth killing. Once done, a second portal will appear after zoning in to the raid.

As in Well of Souls, completing higher-difficulty versions of this quest automatically unlocks the skip on lower difficulties.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Fel Essences from [[Mannoroth (tactics)|Mannoroth]] in {{Au|Hellfire Citadel}} on <Normal / Heroic / Mythic> difficulty.
* [[Fel Essence]] (4)

==Description==
This would all be so much simpler if we could just teleport directly to the top of the Citadel, where {{Au|Gul'dan}} works his [[Fel|dark magic]], wouldn't it? But while [[demon]]ic power fills the halls, my [[magic]] cannot penetrate to such heights.

If only I had powerful Fel Essences to work with, I could attune my magic to their defenses and bypass them. But the only place you might find such concentrated fel energy would be atop the Citadel itself. What a conundrum....

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Fel Conduit]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|30|80}}
* 3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you been to the top of the Citadel so that I can send you to the top of the Citadel?

==Completion==
You did it!

Strange, these Fel Essences bear the unique signature of the [[pit lord]] [[Mannoroth]].... How in the world did you manage to... It's almost like you've been here before!

<[[Khadgar]] peers at you curiously.>

No matter! With this power, I can send you and your companions straight to the top of the Citadel!
