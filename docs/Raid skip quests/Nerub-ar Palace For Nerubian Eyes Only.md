'''Nerub-ar Palace: For Nerubian Eyes Only''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Nerub-ar Palace]]. Defeat the [[Silken Court]] three times to skip to their encounter after defeating [[Ulgrax the Devourer]] and [[The Bloodbound Horror]].

As with other raid skip quests, completing this on higher difficulties automatically unlocks the lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 3 Signets of the Thousand Scars and 3 Signets of the Skeinspiner within [[Nerub-ar Palace]] on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> difficulty.
* [[Signet of the Thousand Scars]] (3)
* [[Signet of the Skeinspiner]] (3)

==Description==
Our tunnels were not built for your kind... too difficult and treacherous to navigate alone.

Fetch me signets from The [[Silken Court]], [[Scarab Lord Anub'arash]] and [[Skeinspinner Takazj]], and I will grant you hidden passage to the palace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Safe passage has its price.

==Completion==
Do not stray into the shadows, <name>--I cannot guarantee your safety.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
