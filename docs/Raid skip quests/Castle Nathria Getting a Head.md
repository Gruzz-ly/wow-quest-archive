'''Castle Nathria: Getting a Head''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Castle Nathria]]. Defeat [[Sludgefist]] four times in the same difficulty to unlock a shortcut to Sludgefist again in future resets. There are three versions of this quest, one for each non-Raid Finder difficulty, and they all track progress separately. However, should players skip ahead and kill four times on Mythic, they will unlock the shortcuts on Normal and Heroic.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Sludgefist's Head from [[Sludgefist]] within [[Castle Nathria]] on <Normal / Heroic / Mythic> Difficulty.
* [[Sludgefist's Head]] (4)

==Description==
We need to show [[Denathrius]] that we mean business. His [[dredger]]... pet... should do the trick.

Bring me his head. Four times should do it. Dredgers are curious creatures.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I need the heads or we cannot make a profound statement. 

==Completion==
With these I'm certain we'll catch the attention of Sire Denathrius. 

==Notes==
Kill Sludgefist on four separate resets, then turn in to Draven. Afterwards, Draven will allow you to immediately summon [[Sludgefist]] after killing [[Shriekwing]] in order to more quickly reach the final two bosses of the raid.

==Patch changes==
