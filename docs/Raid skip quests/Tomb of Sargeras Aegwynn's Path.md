'''Tomb of Sargeras: Aegwynn's Path''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Tomb of Sargeras (instance)|Tomb of Sargeras]]. Defeat the [[Maiden of Vigilance]] four times to have [[Aegwynn]] open the path directly to her after defeating [[Goroth]].

As with other raid skips, completing higher-difficulty versions of this quest will automatically unlock the lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Fragment of the Guardian's Seal from the [[Maiden of Vigilance]] in the [[Tomb of Sargeras (instance)|Tomb of Sargeras]] on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> Difficulty.
* [[Fragment of the Guardian's Seal]] (4)

==Description==
As we sealed the tomb, I entrusted the final piece of [[Sargeras]]' prison to the Maiden of Vigilance. If you had it you could move freely throughout the tomb, but I know not what became of the keeper and fear the worst.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Without the power of the seal we cannot bypass my wards.

==Completion==
With the remnants of this seal, we can dispel the wards and enter my sanctum.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.2.5|note=Added.}}
