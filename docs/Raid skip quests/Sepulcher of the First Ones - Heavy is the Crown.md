'''Sepulcher of the First Ones - Heavy is the Crown''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Sepulcher of the First Ones]]. Defeat [[Anduin Wrynn (tactics)|Anduin Wrynn]] four times to unlock a skip from the [[Vigilant Guardian]] to Anduin.

As with other raid skip quests, completing this task on higher difficulties will automatically unlock the lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Sword Fragments from [[Anduin Wrynn (tactics)|Anduin]] within the [[Sepulcher of the First Ones]] on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> Difficulty.
*[[Mourne Fragment]] (4)

==Description==
[[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]'s [[Mourneblade|blade]] is a powerful conduit for [[The Jailer]]. If we claim fragments of this weapon, I'll be able to open a pathway directly to the boy king.

Four fragments should be enough. With these, we can break the Jailer's hold on Anduin for good.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Four Sword Fragments should allow us to access his chamber.

==Completion==
This should help us travel directly to Anduin.
