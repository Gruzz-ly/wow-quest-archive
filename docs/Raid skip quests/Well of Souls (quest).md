'''Well of Souls''' is the first of two [[raid skip]] quests in {{au|Hellfire Citadel}}. Defeat [[Gorefiend]] four times to open a portal immediately after zoning in that will allow the raid to teleport directly to him.

Once this quest is complete, Khadgar next starts [[The Fel Spire]], asking for four more weeks of defeating [[Mannoroth (tactics)|Mannoroth]] to skip to the pit lord.

Completing this quest on a higher difficulty will automatically open the raid skip on lower difficulties.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 Soul Remnants from [[Gorefiend]] in {{Au|Hellfire Citadel}} on <Normal / Heroic / Mythic> difficulty.
* [[Soul Remnant]] (4)

==Description==
As you defeat {{Au|Gul'dan}}'s minions, his hold over this [[fel]] citadel weakens, allowing me to teleport you and your allies deeper into the dark halls. If I only I had some Soul Remnants - four of them, let's say - none of this would be necessary, and I could harness that power to send you directly into the upper reaches of the Citadel.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Soul Conduit (Hellfire Citadel)]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|30|80}}
* 3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you manage to find any of those Soul Remnants I mentioned?

==Completion==
A-ha! Soul Remnants!

<[[Khadgar]] cradles the Remnants briefly and focuses intently upon them.>

There, now you and your companions may access the upper level of the Citadel directly.

==Patch changes==
