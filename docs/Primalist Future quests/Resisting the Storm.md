'''Resisting the Storm''' requires players to complete the [[Storm's Fury]] event (via the [[The Storm's Fury (world quest)]] world quest) in the [[Primalist Future]] of [[Thaldraszus]].

==Objectives==
Stock up on any necessary supplies and complete "[[Storm's Fury|The Storm's Fury]]" event in the [[Primalist Future]].
*[[Field Deployable Heat Source]] (optional) {{co|60.7|46.5|Primalist Future}}
*The Storm's Fury completed

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] are growing in strength in this future timeline, despite our best efforts. If they overrun this valley and threaten the [[Temporal Conflux]], they may become a problem for the rest of the [[timeway]]s.

We are already protecting the timeways from enough threats.

Push back on them, <name>. We need to keep this peril in check. Speak to [[Tarnormu]] to gather any supplies you might need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 5x [[Field Deployable Heat Source]]
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We cannot let the Primalists become a threat to other periods in our history.

==Completion==
You have been an inspiration to the few forces that still remain, <class>. 

The threat may be pushed back a little for now, but we must continue our vigil here so that the rest of the timeways are not in yet more dangers than before.

==Notes==
This quest requires the world quest to be up &mdash; it spawns every five hours, so players may need to wait.

[[Tarnormu]] spawns next to [[Brendormi]] when the [[The Storm's Fury (world quest)]] event starts. Pick up a [[Field Deployable Heat Source]] for {{cost|50}} if desired, else piggyback off other players' purchases or the NPC campfires to keep warm. See the [[Storm's Fury]] article for more information on the event, which runs every five hours.

==Progression==
#[[Storm Warning]]
#[[Resisting the Storm]]
