==Objectives==
Heal resistance fighters in the [[Primalist Future]].
*[[Injured Resistance Fighter]]s healed (10)
*[[Bandages (Dragonflight)]] (provided)

==Description==
The temporal ripples have caused trouble for the people here. Enemies appear where they were not, or are far stronger than they should be. These changes are small, but they are disastrous.

I ask you to help the resistance fighters here. Heal their wounds so that they may fight once more. Set their timeline back on its correct course, as if it had never interacted with our own. It is not much, but it is what we can do for them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you assisted the resistance?

==Completion==
These brave fighters will be able to bolster their forces once more.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|If you need help, call on me and I will be there!}}
:''Zera waves.''

Pick up [[Making Time]] from the [[Possible Future You]] before heading out.

Zera has unique gossip here:
:How can I help, <name>?

:{{gossip|<Ask about the storms.>}}
::The storms are fascinating, aren't they? Scary, but fascinating!

::I've been asked by you to help... you... when dealing with the wild energies that empower all manners of [[Primalists|Primalist]] forces out in the wild.

::With me at your side, the storms should be a little less deadly. Just be careful if I'm not around to help you though!

While on these quests, players are buffed with '''Call for Zera''', granting the [[Extra Action Button]]:
:{{Abilities|Accompanied by Zera|Call for Siaszerathel to assist you.|cd=20 sec|notes=Instant|id=372444|icon=inv_dracthyrhead06}}

Players can Dragonride freely in the quest area, but don't head out of temporal bounds, else they will get teleported back to the Temporal Conflux.

[[Injured Resistance Fighter]]s are all over the quest area. Use the provided [[Bandages (Dragonflight)]] to heal them.
*{{text|say|Injured Resistance Fighter|I can't believe they almost got me.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Resistance Fighter|Thank you. Watch out for the really big ones.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Resistance Fighter|<Name>? What- Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Injured Resistance Fighter|Thank you. Stay safe.}}
