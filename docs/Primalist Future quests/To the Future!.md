==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Primalist Future]].
*Portal to Future Taken {{co|59.8|82.2|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
I have tracked [[Chronormu]] and [[Eternus]] to a potential future. I know not what you will find there, only that it is dark and chaotic.

[[Soridormi]] has taken some of our [[timewalkers]] ahead to that future in order to hold our connection to that time stable. Her considerable power will be needed to keep the portal open, so she must rely on your talents.

Soridormi will be able to direct you further once you meet her there.

Hurry, <name>. Find Chronormu.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We need to find Chromie and Eternus before more damage can be done to this time.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Temporal Tuning]] before taking the Portal to the Primalist Future. The player lands in the [[Primalist Future]], an alternate version of [[Thaldraszus]] centered on the bronze area.

On the other side of the loading screen:
:{{text|say|Soridormi|<Name>, I sense that Chromie is nearby. We must act quickly!}}

While on these quests, players are buffed with '''Call for Zera''', granting the [[Extra Action Button]]:
:{{Abilities|Accompanied by Zera|Call for Siaszerathel to assist you.|cd=20 sec|notes=Instant|id=372444|icon=inv_dracthyrhead06}}

Turn in to Soridormi. She and a [[Possible Future You]] offer the next quests.
