==Objectives==
Find [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] at [[Emperor's Reach]]. Speak to [[Fennie Hornswaggle]] at [[Lion's Landing]] for transportation.
*Find Anduin at Emperor's Reach

==Description==
[[Horde]] forces are amassing in huge numbers at the Emperor's Reach, high up in the mountains of [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

The area is an [[Mogu'shan Vaults|ancient mogu palace]], and certainly a source of untold power.

This can only mean one thing. [[Garrosh]] is going to use the [[Divine Bell]], and Anduin... and the [[Harmonic Mallet]]... are both missing.

I have no doubt that the fool boy went north by himself.

I don't have time to gather an elite force to detain him. You must go and stop Anduin.

Fennie can take you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>! Just the <class> I was hoping to see. You couldn't have arrived at a better time.

==Notes==
Take Fennie's kite ride one last time.

:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|It's about time ye showed up.  Doomsday is a comin'.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Garrosh is amassing his troops on the northern side of Kun-Lai Summit.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|He's going to use the Divine Bell, and Light help us if we can't stop 'im in time.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Anduin went on ahead.  That cheeky, light-spoutin', clod-brained fool!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Boy's naive enough ta think he can change the Horde 'an save the world... but... he's still just a child.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Ye've either got to stop the boy or help him... one o' the two!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|We're amassin' an army to head Garrosh off, but that will take time, and the Prince may already be in danger.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Oh, why can't this dang kite go faster?}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Quick - they haven't spotted us yet.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I'll go back fer reinforcements.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Whatever ye do today, hero, ye're doin' fer all the Alliance.}}

On the main platform itself, where the [[Gara'jal the Spiritbinder]] encounter would take place in the instanced version of [[Mogu'shan Vaults]], [[Garrosh Hellscream]], [[Ishi]], the [[Divine Bell]], and squads of [[Kor'kron Reaver (Kun-Lai Summit)|Kor'kron Reavers]] are all there. The platform is covered in sha energy and two superior sha are standing by--one on top of Ishi and another a few yards to his side.

Anduin is hiding behind a pillar to the south of the main platform where Fennie drops the adventurer off. Speak with him.
