==Objectives==
Slay 8 [[Knucklethump Smasher]]s or [[Knucklethump Jibstabber|Jibstabbers]] at [[Knucklethump Hole]].
*Knucklethump Hozen slain (8)

==Description==
The Knucklethump hozen have new chief, [[the Ook of Dook]].

He sees [[Sha of Fear|fear]] in the west, [[Sha of Anger|anger]] in the south, [[Sha of Hatred|hatred]] in the north, and [[yaungol]]s in the east.

And so he sets his [[hozen]] to ravage, gathering food and supplies for coming famine.

They are many Knucklethumps and dangerous.

Please, Luckydo, can you defeat their fighters?

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is sad so many hozen must die.

==Completion==
You are a true luckydo.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Snackrifice]] and [[Hozen Love Their Keys]] before heading out.

Head north to [[Knucklethump Hole]], start killing hozen and freeing grummles. Grummles hanging from ropes can be freed by simply doing damage to the ropes. In the very back of the cave is [[Cho Cho the Wicked]]. Make sure The Snackrifice and Thumping Knucklethump are both complete at this point. Kill him to loot the key, then use it on the ball and chain behind [[Old Poot Poot]]. Poot will snag the player then run out of the cave, killing knuckethump victims along the way. Poot will drop adventurers off back at the Burlap Waystation, so turn in all three quests then.
