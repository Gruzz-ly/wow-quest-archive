==Objectives==
Kill 5 Terracotta Guardians.
*[[Korune Guardian]] slain (5)

==Description==
Before the [[mogu]] overwhelmed our scouting party, we found relics scattered amongst the ruins to the north.

I would like to collect some samples, but the mogu's terracotta watchdogs are too much for us to handle.

If you could clear the area of their presence, we will be able to resume our work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Progress==
I am quite keen to understand the mogu's magic.

==Completion==
Ah! Well done! With the guardians gone, we should be able to excavate these ruins safely.

==Progression==
{{Horde Pandaren campaign}}
