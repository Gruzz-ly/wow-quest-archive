[[File:General Sho Lien.jpg|thumb|[[General Sho Lien]].]]
Search the Abandoned Wreckage for supplies.
*Search the [[Abandoned Wreckage]] for supplies {{co|50.1|49.2|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[General Sho Lien]] slain

==Description==
Did you have to throw our supplies at them?! Why not use your weapon? Maybe fancy spells or kicks? Why the supplies?!

Now we don't have enough to last us, especially with [[Nephew Bentnail]] here. His appetite is like a yeti's!

You threw it, you get us more. There is wreckage down the path. Maybe you will find supplies there.

*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nephew Bentnail has already eaten two days worth of food. I hope you found us more!

==Completion==
You were attacked by a [[Mogu]]? That sounds terrible!

I hate to ask, but did you manage to pick up any supplies while you were fighting for your life?

No?! This is very bad luck.

==Notes==
Head down the path to the southeast roughly 100 yards to find the Abandoned Wreckage. Interact with it, and {{NPC||General Sho Lien}} appears from downhill:
:{{text|yell|General Sho Lien|You survive the mountain pass only to die here!}}
:{{text|yell|General Sho Lien|Awaken my pets! Feast on their flesh!}}
:''The four [[quilen]] statues nearby awaken.''
{{NPC||Stone Guardian (Kun-Lai Summit)||Stone Guardians}} are level 87 quilen with 64,496 health. Kill them.
:{{text|yell|General Sho Lien|I will see to your demise myself!}}
General Sho Lien is a level 87 mogu with 322,000 health and the following abilities:
