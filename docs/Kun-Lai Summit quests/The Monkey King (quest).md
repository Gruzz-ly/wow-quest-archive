==Description==
Ever since the [[Horde]] captured the [[Divine Bell]] I have been searching for a means to counter its power.

==Completion==
You come asking for the Monkey King?

Let us see how well you ookin' sing.

Who are you, so tiny and boring?

Your cause is silly! You leave me snoring.

Three riddles I will ask,

These riddles are a task,

Finish each without pause,

And we shall see if I help your cause.

==Notes==
:Garrosh is going to try to use the Divine bell to wreak havoc on the land.  We must find a way to stop him.
:{{gossip|''Anduin, why are we here?''}}
:''Anduin starts running in to the [[Tomb of Conquerors]], dodging traps along the way.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|According to my research, the pandaren long ago made a special mallet that was intended for the Divine Bell.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|When using the mallet on the Divine Bell, the pandaren monks were able to create pure harmony.}}
:''Anduin takes a left into a newly-opened portion of the crypt, filled with [[hozen]], [[mogu]], and [[quilen]] converted to jade.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But then the Monkey King one day decided to steal the mallet and hide it as a prank.  There is no record of the mallet after that.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|What I did find, however, was the final resting place of the infamous "Monkey King."}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The tricky part is, he was frozen in jade while dueling a mogu that history names "The Jade Warlord."}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I found an incantation to release these two from their prison.  But it will release both of them.  Once I cast this, defeat the Jade Warlord before he can get his bearings.}}

Anduin stops in the middle of the room in front of a mogu and hozen frozen in jade.  Speak with Anduin again:
:{{gossip|''I'm ready.  Release the Monkey King.''}}
:''Anduin starts casting a spell to release the hozen and mogu.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Here goes nothing.  My research did not have nice things to say about this Jade Warlord.  Be ready for battle.}}
:''The jade is released and the Monkey King jumps from on top of the Jade Warlord's blade to a position a few yards from Anduin.''
:{{text|say|The Monkey King|Iiiiiiii'm back Wikkets!}}
[[The Jade Warlord]] is a level 90 elite mogu with 2 million health. Finish him off, then speak to the Monkey King to turn in.

:{{Text|say|The Jade Warlord|The... Empire... will rise again.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|The Monkey King|Woo hoo!  Son of an Ook!  Pins and needles, pins and needles.  Legs are asleep.  Hands are asleep.  Nibs are asleep.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Ah... your grace?}}
:{{text|say|The Monkey King|Ooo?  Grace?  I am not an emperor, little thing.  You stand before the Monkey King!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|My apologies.  My name is Anduin Wrynn.  This champion and I need your help.}}
:{{text|say|The Monkey King|Help?  You saved me from eternity trapped in jade!  I'm gonna throw you the biggest party ever made!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Thank you, but this is hardly the time for a party.  A dangerous war leader named Garrosh has found the Divine Bell.  We need the Harmonic Mallet to counter it.}}
:{{text|say|The Monkey King|Oh... the missing Harmonic Mallet, eh?  Such a silly name.  So you come find the King because he is to blame?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Well, my research said you were the last one to-}}
:{{text|say|The Monkey King|Ah ya ta ta!  Don't worry, you in the right place.  But let's first see if I like what comes out of your face.}}

:Free!  Free at last after ten thousand years!  This a happy day!  Gonna need biggest party ever!  With nibs!  And dibs!  And brews!  And jungle hozen!  And mountain hozen!  And sky hozen!
