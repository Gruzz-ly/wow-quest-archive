==Objectives==
Kill 8 Broketooth Chargers and 6 Broketooth Tossers.
*[[Broketooth Charger]] slain (8)
*[[Broketooth Tosser]] slain (6)

==Description==
[[Hozen]] only ravage when they think their supplies are too few for their number of mouths.

Problem is, hozen always have more mouths than food.

We have very few [[grummle]]s these days.

It is a hard thing to ask, but can you be a friend to grummles, and destroy some of the [[Broketooth tribe|Broketooth hozen]] south of here? It is the only way to prevent them from destroying the landscape.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60|}} (or {{cost|10|62|}} at max level)
*162,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is not vengeance or fortune, it is survival.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>! Hopefully that will slow the Broketooth ravage.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
