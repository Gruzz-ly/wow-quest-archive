==Objectives==
Weaken and capture Shan Kien at the [[Tomb of Shadows]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].
*[[Shan Kien]] weakened

==Description==
It is time to make our move. Go to the Tomb of Shadows, weaken him, and take him captive.

I will stay here in case Garrosh arrives. He must be delayed so that we can take our prize before he destroys it in his anger.

Hurry!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Progress==
Move, <name>!

==Completion==
We managed to capture our quarry.

In truth, though, I am not sure what our next move should be. I will contact the leaders of our allies and see if they have ideas - I don't know that our [[arcane]] talents are going to pry the secrets of our mogu captive.

;Shan Kien defeated
:{{Text|yell|Shan Kien|Fools! I control what makes you fight... Fear, anger, doubt... these are MY weapons!}}
:''[[Garrosh Hellscream]] and [[Fanlyr Silverthorn]] kill [[Korune Mutilator]]s and [[Korune Sha-weaver]]s and enter the [[Tomb of Shadows]]. Shan Kien uses Sha Grasp to strangulate the player, Orestes, and Aenea. Garrosh throws [[Gorehowl]] at Shan Kien, stunning him.''
:{{Text|yell|Shan Kien|AUGH!}}
:{{Text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Pathetic! You and your mogu are nothing to the might of the [[Horde]]!}}
:{{Text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Now... if you value your life, scum, you'll tell me what I need to know.}}
:{{Text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Where is the [[:Divine Bell]]?!}}
:{{Text|say|Shan Kien|Ha... <cough>... you young races... so impatient, petulant. [[Orc]]... you cannot even control yourself... your own rage, your own fear.}}
:{{Text|say|Shan Kien|How could you hope... <cough>... to control the Bell?}}
:{{Text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Graaagh!}}
:{{Text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Fine. You've made your choice, mogu. Now, you die...}}
:''Fanlyr teleports Shan Kien away.''
:{{Text|yell|Fanlyr Silverthorn|Garrosh! Stay your hand!}}
:{{Text|say|Fanlyr Silverthorn|He is our only way to find the bell. We WILL make him talk. Give us time.}}
:{{Text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|...Very well. He is yours, Blood Elf.}}
:{{Text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|But, elf...}}
:{{Text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Disrespect me again, and I'll have your head on a pike outside the gates of [[Orgrimmar]].}}
:{{Text|say|Fanlyr Silverthorn|Well... that was interesting. Let's go meet with Lor'themar back outside.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Alright everyone. Make preparations to take the prisoner back to the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]]. We'll be handing him over to Hellscream once he's had some time to cool off.}}

Friend-

What you been hearing? [[Baine Bloodhoof]] wrote to say that Garrosh is capturing mogu and using some sort of energy the [[Pandaren]] call "[[sha]]." There ain't no power he won't abuse.

Baine says he going to stay close to him. Garrosh probably don't trust the tauren chieftain, but he trusts. Keep Baine out of trouble for me. We going to need him.
