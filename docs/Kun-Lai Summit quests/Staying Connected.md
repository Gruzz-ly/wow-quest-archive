==Objectives==
Use the Tongue of Ba-Shon in the [[Valley of Emperors]].
*Use the Tongue of Ba-Shon in the Valley of Emperors {{co|57.9|49.0|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] (provided)

==Description==
The Tongue of Ba-Shon should allow us to communicate from long distances, <name>.

If the relic works the way I think it will, I should be able to stay here and continue my meditations while you do some scouting in the Valley of Emperors.

[[Mishi]] will take you to the edge of the valley so that we can test my theory. I would hate for you to be in the tombs with no way to contact me. That would be horrible!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 XP

==Completion==
Very good! The relic works!

It appears there is more going on in the Valley of Emperors than I had anticipated. It is crucial we figure out why the Mogu are opening the tombs.

==Notes==
Speak with Mishi:
:<Mishi looks at you inquisitively.>
:{{gossip|I'm ready to leave.}}
:''Mishi switches to full-size and takes the adventurer to the far side of the [[Valley of Emperors]].''
Once landed, use [[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] to summon an [[Image of Lorewalker Cho]]. Turn in to the image.
