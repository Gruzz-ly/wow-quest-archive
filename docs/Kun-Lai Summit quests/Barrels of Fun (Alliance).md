==Objectives==
Use Explosive Barrels found in [[Fire Camp Ordo]] to destroy the West, South, and East Oil Rigs.
*Eastern Oil Rig destroyed {{co|51.0|79.5|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Southern Oil Rig destroyed {{co|49.6|81.0|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
Oh, well now, let's have us some fun, <boyo/girly>!

Those Ordo yaungol to the northwest have saved us the trouble o' havin' to make some bombs. They already have them there.

Let's put their explosive barrels to good use and destroy their [[Oil platform|oil-pumpin' machines]], shall we?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Explosive Barrel}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm a wee bit surprised by the lack o' explosions I've seen so far.

Are you well?

==Completion==
Ho ho, that were a fine sight to see. I knew I should have gone up there with ya, <name>!

==Notes==
Pick up [[In Tents Channeling (Alliance)]] and [[Pandaren Prisoners (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Start freeing pandaren and looting barrels. The barrels are unique, so pick one up, run it to a oil rig, place it, and run away and repeat. The four lieutenants are found in tents marked by fire lines exiting their central poles. When the fourth lieutenant is dead, In Tents will complete automatically. Turn it in and pick up [[The Ordo Warbringer (Alliance)]], then go kill [[Ordo Warbringer]] before heading back.
