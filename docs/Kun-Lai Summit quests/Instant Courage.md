== Objectives ==
[[File:Experienced Guide.jpg|thumb|[[Experienced Guide]].]]
Inspire 3 Hiding Guides in [[Howlingwind Cavern]] to help you.
*[[Hiding Guide]] Inspired x3
*[[Fire Lotus Incense]] (provided)

==Description==
It is most bad fortune to travel mountain paths without good guide. We [[grummle]]s make best guides, but many have run away. They fear the mountain pass now. Many good grummles disappear up there.

Grummles good at many things, but not very brave. Maybe with fire lotus incense you can make them brave. Then they will show you the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 XP

==Progress==
Did you find hiding grummles?

==Completion==
Incense works like a charm! Effects will not last long, so you must hurry!

==Notes==
Pick up [[They Stole My Luck!]] and [[Resupplying One Keg]] before heading out.

Head north out of [[One Keg]] past the flight master, [[Little Cleankite]], up the path with a view of the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] to reach the [[Howlingwind Cavern]]. [[Mischievous Snow Sprite]]s have the four "luckydos" of [[Ji-Lu the Lucky]]. Stolen Supplies are all over the cave system, generally near bigger piles of supplies. [[Hiding Guide]]s are, well, hiding in big pots. Speak with them:
*I'm a little basked filled with grain...
*Nothin' to see here... move along!
*I'm just a little grummle in a scary world.
*I won't go back!
:{{gossip|Are you sure you don't want to come with me?}}
:Nope! Grummle is safe here.
:{{gossip|Well, you can't just stay in here! You leave me no choice!<br /><Use the Fire Lotus Incense.>}}
:''Out pops an Experienced Guide.''
The guides do help fight.

Gather up all of the quest objectives and then head back.
