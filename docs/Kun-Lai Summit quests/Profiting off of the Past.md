==Objectives==
[[File:Mogu Relic.jpg|thumb|Mogu Relic]]
Collect 12 Mogu Relics.
*[[Mogu Relic]] (12)

==Description==
Let me guess, you're here to deal with the mogu statues that are being reanimated. What a coincidence, I'm here to, um... conduct research on the mogu.

I tell you what, if you bring me as many of the mogu relics in there that you can carry, I'll give you a cut. Of the research... funding.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where am I going to be able to put all of the relics?

==Completion==
Wow! I mean, wow! Thank you, <name>!

<Bao Jian's eyes widen with anticipation of the proceeds from the relics.>

Now that you've softened them up, I'm thinking that I might head in. Just a few more relics from around the outskirts. Nothing dangerous.

==Notes==
Before accept:
:{{text|say|Bao Jian|Hello, friend! Can I interest you in the deal of a lifetime?}}
Up at [[Mogujia]] for [[Mogu?! Oh No-gu!]] and [[Deanimate the Reanimated]], [[Bao Jian]] at the southeast side of the ruins offers this quest. Pick it up before killing too many of the constructs. Relics litter the ground and are held by the [[Terracotta Warrior]]s and [[Terracotta Guardian|Guardian]]s.

On return to Bao Jian before collecting all 12:
:{{text|say|Bao Jian|How goes the relic retrieval, <name>? I hope those mogu statues aren't giving you too much trouble.}}
:After collecting all 12:
:{{text|say|Bao Jian|That's a lot of mogu relics. We're going to be rich!}}
