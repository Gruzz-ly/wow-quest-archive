==Objectives==
Meet Magni Bronzebeard outside [[Mogu'shan Vaults]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].
* Meet with [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]]
* Speak to the [[Mogu Warrior]]
* [[Mantid]] ambush defeated

==Description==
The last I heard, Mogu'shan Vaults was still abandoned.

We shouldn't have too tough of a time reachin' the engine, since we've already defeated the mogu guardians in that place.

Well, what are ye waitin' for? Let's get that engine turned on!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's never easy, is it?

==Completion==
That amber barrier looks nigh impassible.

It looks like we've hit a dead end...

==Notes==
On accept, Magni teleports away:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I'll meet ye at the entrance tae the Vaults, champion!}}

He doesn't provide an option to tag along, however. Consider finding a portal to the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] from a mage, or the portals to [[Jade Forest]] in [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] and [[Orgrimmar]].

When you reach Magni, he's standing in the middle of many corpses. Friendly [[Mogu Warrior (NPC)|Mogu Warriors]] and hostile [[Zara'thik Depthspeaker]]s and [[Vil'thik Quickblade]]s.

;On approach
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Careful, hero! One of these mogu is still kickin'!}}
:{{text|say|Mogu Warrior|Honored Speaker... I... would have words with you...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ye... what? Well... that's peculiar.}}

Speak with him:
:You... are allies of the Speaker?

:We must... stop the mantid. They cannot have... the vaults.

:I must take you to... my people...

:{{Gossip|Lead the way.}}
:{{text|say|Mogu Warrior|We must... make haste... the mantid--}}
:''The mogu is interupted as [[Amber-shaper Gokilak]] swoops down from the sky, along with two [[Vil'thik Quickblade]]s.''
:{{text|yell|Amber-shaper Gokilak|Foolish mogu! These vaults now belong to the [[Grand Empress Shek'zara|Empress]]!}}
:{{text|yell|Amber-shaper Gokilak|Your allies will die with you!}}

Defeat the Amber-shaper and his two minions.
:{{text|say|Amber-shaper Gokilak|Our swarms... are endless...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ach, what are we gonna do now?}}
:{{text|say|Mogu Warrior|Find... my clan...}}

The corpse of the slain [[Mogu Warrior]] offers the next quest, [[The Mysterious Sigil]].
