==Objectives==
Find [[Sarannha Skyglaive]] at the [[Ruins of Korune]]. Speak to [[Fennie Hornswaggle]] at [[Lion's Landing]] for transportation.
*Find Sarannha Skyglaive at the Ruins of Korune

==Description==
It's time for our boldest move yet, <name>.

Since you acquired intel on the location of the [[:Divine Bell]], we've amassed a top team to excavate the artifact without delay.

Commander Sarannha Skyglaive leads the expedition into the northern-most reaches of [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

Join them at once, and use whatever skills you need to make the endeavor a success.

Good luck, <class>. I don't need to tell you how important this mission is to the Alliance.

Speak to Fennie. She'll get you there quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]
*+10 reputation with [[Alliance]]

==Completion==
We blasted the doors open moments ago, <class>. You arrived just in time to join us for the excavation.

==Notes==
Taylor will offer this quest at 7500/21000 {{rep|revered}} with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]. Speak with Fennie again:
:{{gossip|Take me to the Ruins of Korune.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|We ain't got no time ta lose.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|We've been lookin' all over Kun-Lai Summit fer a place that matches what ye saw in that mogu's memory, and we finally found the Korune's hidin' place.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|If we don't get to that Divine Bell first, that lizard-livered nut-brain Garrosh will. I don't much fancy fightin' a Horde that commands the power o' the bleepin' sha.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Commander Skyglaive is already workin' with a team of Explorer's League archaeologists at the dig site.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|We're sendin' out our best, and that means you.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Here we are. There's no time to waste.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Good luck!}}

Fennie drops the adventurer off at the entrance to the [[Ruins of Korune]], where [[Sarannha Skyglaive]], [[Brann Bronzebeard]], [[Hilda Hornswaggle]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], [[Shieldwall Explorer]]s, [[Skyglaive Sentinel]]s, [[Skyglaive Archer]]s, and [[Nightsaber (Kun-Lai Summit)|Nightsabers]] have all found themselves.
