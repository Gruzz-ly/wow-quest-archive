==Objectives==
Rescue the Brother Rabbitsfoot from the [[Broketooth Outpost]].
*Rescue the [[Brother Rabbitsfoot]] {{co|49.1|70.5|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
The Broketooth hozen stole our Rabbitsfoot! He was the [[grummle]] with the biggest luckydo.

This is very bad fortune indeed. Please, <race>, we need our Rabbitsfoot back. We need his good fortune back.

Can you search the Broketooth Outpost for him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Look what Brooketooths and Knucklethumps did to grummle waystation. Hardly a luckydo to be found.

Grummles had deal with hozen. We give them food, they not ravage. Whenever they think to ravage, Shado-Pan remind them not to ravage.

All of Shado-Pan away defending wall now though. And hozen want more food than grummles have.

==Notes==
Head out to the west up the [[Burlap Trail]]. On the south side of the trail is the [[Broketooth Outpost]], where [[Brother Rabbitsfoot]] is hanging from a tree upside down. Interact with him:
:{{text|say|Brother Rabitsfoot|Many thanks for rescue of most good fortune.}}

He offers [[The Broketooth Ravage]]. Accept it and Rabbitsfoot will take off to the northeast:
:{{text|say|Brother Rabbitsfoot|Thank you for the rescue! Meet me at [[Burlap Waystation]].}}
Collect his Luckydo from [[Mo Mo]] in the back of the outpost, then follow him to the northeast.
