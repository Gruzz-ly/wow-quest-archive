Following [[Chen Stormstout]]'s suspicions that an old seer may be able to help during the [[Darkspear Rebellion]], the player and the seer must walk '''The Path of the Last Emperor''' to gain insight to what is happening to Pandaria, and what will [[Siege of Orgrimmar|follow...]]

==Objectives==
Escort [[Seer Hao Pham Roo]] to [[Seeker's Point]]. Attach his Climbing Rope to each Rope Anchor along the path to help him scale the mountain.
*First Anchor {{co|44.9|49.1|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Second Anchor {{co|44.0|47.9|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Third Anchor {{co|43.3|49.6|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Fourth Anchor {{co|44.5|50.6|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Final Anchor {{co|43.3|51.9|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
In his time of uncertainty, the [[Shaohao|last emperor]] walked a lonely path up [[Mount Neverest|this mountain]], until he had at last found his answers.

I am here to walk the same path, and it seems you have questions of your own to be answered. Perhaps you will join me, and we can both be satisfied?

Oh, but I am getting old, and this blizzard is proving too much for my bones. Could you climb ahead and anchor this rope? I can hoist myself along from there.

Together we shall walk the path of the last emperor.

==Rewards==

You will receive {{cost|24|72}} and one of: {{itembox|Item level 502 boots|Treads of Reticence|Unpretentious Boots|Treads of Respect|Boots of Boundless Patience|Sabatons of the Humble|Modest Sandals|Subservient Greatboots|Unassuming Slippers|Self-Effacing Boots}}

==Progress==
Surely you would not leave an old man to fend for himself in a storm such as this?

==Completion==
We made it, <class>! Thank you so much. Please, help yourself to some of my old knick-knacks.

But... I am afraid I have not been completely honest with you...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|Seer Hao Pham Roo hands you the end of his climbing rope.  Tie it to the next Rope Anchor and help him up the mountain!}}
:{{text|say|Seer Hao Pham Roo|Heh, do not get angry with the elements.  [[Sha of Violence|Violence]] is their nature.  I conquered my own [[Sha of Anger|anger]] long, long ago.}}

[[Summit Guster]]s wander the path between anchors. Kill any elementals in the way, run up and interact with the Rope Anchor, then run back down to the seer and escort him up. Killing the first Guster will buff players with Zephyr, announced by a boss emote:
:{{text|bossemote|Zehphyr increases your movement speed - share this effect with Seer Hao Pham Roo by walking beside him.}}

On reaching the first tie-off:
:{{text|say|Seer Hao Pham Roo|My, you are strong!  When I was young, I might have [[Sha of Doubt|doubted]] that we could do this. But now, I have no doubts at all.}}

Repeat the process to reach subsequent tie offs. Upon reaching the second:
:{{text|say|Seer Hao Pham Roo|Such wind!  Such cold!  Once, it would have filled these old bones with [[Sha of Despair|despair]].  But on this day, I am filled with hope.}}

Upon reaching the third:
:{{text|say|Seer Hao Pham Roo|Such a patient one!  When I was young, I would have [[Sha of Hatred|hated]] this task.  Nowadays, I am filled with love.}}

Upon reaching the fourth:
:{{text|say|Seer Hao Pham Roo|Do not fear the heights, as I did when I was young. [[Sha of Fear|Fear]] can drive us to terrible deeds.  Ah, but I see that like me, you have learned the lessons of courage!}}

And finally, upon reaching the final tie off at [[Seeker's Point]]:
:{{text|say|Seer Hao Pham Roo|Ah, here we are.  Oh - oh, these old bones are tired.  More than you can imagine.}}
:{{text|say|Seer Hao Pham Roo|You surprised me.  I expected a hero such as yourself to balk at the task of carrying an old man up a mountain.  Most are too [[Sha of Pride|proud]].}} 

Speak with him to complete the quest, which fulfills "The Path of the Last Emperor" requirement of [[Darkspear Revolutionary]] / [[Hordebreaker]], but the seer has more to say once the quest is complete:

[[File:Emperor Shaohao at Seeker's Point.jpg|thumb|Emperor Shaohao at Seeker's Point]]

:{{text|say|Seer Hao Pham Roo|I was going to teach you a lesson but instead, it is you who have taught me.  You see, when I was young... when I was young... when I was young...}}
:{{text|say|Seer Hao Pham Roo|I was EMPEROR.}}
:''The seer's voice deepens and a flash of green light surrounds him as he grows in size and rises into the air to reveal his true form: the spirit of Emperor Shaohao!''
:{{text|say|[[Emperor Shaohao]]|The realm you see all around you was mine to command.}}
:{{text|say|Emperor Shaohao|I conquered my doubts, my fears, my anger... I buried all of it within the land.}}
:{{text|say|Emperor Shaohao|But I held on to one vice.  The one sha I never conquered.  PRIDE.}}
:{{text|say|Emperor Shaohao|My pride cloaked this land in mists!  I thought we were better than the rest of the world.}}
:{{text|say|Emperor Shaohao|I thought we could solve our own problems.  But for ten thousand years, we stagnated, our doubts and fears buried in the land, rising up to fester whenever we allowed them.}}
:{{text|say|Emperor Shaohao|Pride.  It is the most insidious of sha.  It is good until it is bad.  And then it is more dangerous than all the others combined.}}
:{{text|say|Emperor Shaohao|Beware of pride! Be humble! The world is plunging into chaos. Old enemies must work together. Proud races must admit they need help.}}
:{{text|say|Emperor Shaohao|Things are going to get worse before they get better.  Only by working together can we overcome the darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Emperor Shaohao|All that stands in our way... is pride.}}
:''The emperor breathes his last words into the winds as he bows and fades away.''
