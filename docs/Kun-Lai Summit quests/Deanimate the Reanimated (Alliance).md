==Objectives==
Destroy any 14 Terracotta Warriors or Terracotta Guardians.
*[[Terracotta Warrior]]s or [[Terracotta Guardian]]s destroyed (14)

==Description==
[[Taylor|The admiral]]'s asked me to take care of a big problem, but my specialty's in healing, not fighting!

We've got a problem just to the northeast at [[Mogujia]]. Something's causing the statues there to animate, and the [[Pandaren]] here in camp are freaking out about it.

Will you help me out, <name>? We can't afford to have a fight with an army of statues right now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please tell me that you have the Mogujia situation under control. Please?

==Completion==
Alright! Looks like we won't have a bunch of statues to worry about any more. Good work, <name>!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Round 'Em Up (Alliance)]], [[Blue Dwarf Needs Food Badly]], [[Mogu?! Oh No-gu! (Alliance)]], and [[Trouble on the Farmstead (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Head northeast and start killing beasts to reach [[Mogujia]]. Before killing the constructs, however, circle around to the southeast to find [[Bao Jian]], who offers [[Profiting off of the Past]]. That quest in hand,  start killing to the northeast of the camp and head up the mountain to find the [[Mogujia Soul-Caller]]. Kill him, then keep killing out of the mogu territory to hit quota. Then search for yaks and head south to the [[Chow Farmstead]], killing beasts all along the way. Do their quests, then head back to Westwind.
