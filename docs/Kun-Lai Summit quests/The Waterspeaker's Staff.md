==Objectives==
Recover [[Waterspeaker Gorai]]'s Stolen Inkgill Ritual Staff from [[Orachi]] in [[Inkgill Mere]].
*[[Stolen Inkgill Ritual Staff]]

==Description==
There is great dissent in Inkgill, <race>. Elder Shai Hu drank the sha-corrupted waters of the mere, and forced the others to do the same. When I protested, Orachi of the town guard confiscated my ritual staff and banished me.

Now, I am not only an exile, I am unable to speak with the waters that once gave me guidance!

I am not a fighter. But if you are, perhaps you can recover my staff from Orachi? He is in town to our north.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
*161,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the staff?

==Completion==
Good. Now we have some hope of redeeming this situation.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|Please, accept the ancestors blessing. It is not much, but it is all I can give without my staff, and will help you traverse the Mere.}}

The player receives the Blessing of the Inkgill buff.

Pick up [[Repossession]], [[My Son...]], [[Enraged Vengeance]], and [[Free the Dissenters]] before heading out.

Cross to the north over the mere to the far side of the village and start hunting for goods and jinyu. Orachi is on the northern shore, and Wu-Peng is on the north side of the north shore hiding behind a big shell. Feel free to instantly turn in My Son... and pick up [[Father and Child Reunion]] from him, as it is not an escort.
