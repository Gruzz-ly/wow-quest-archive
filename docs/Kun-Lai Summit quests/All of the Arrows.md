==Objectives==
Collect 12 Arrows for [[Commander Hsieh]].
*[[Arrow for Commander Hsieh]] (12)

==Description==
As soon as their reinforcements arrive, the [[yaungol]] are going to overrun our position [[Kun-Lai Pass|here]]. If they do that, [[Binan Village|the village]] will be lost.

Would you be willing to retrieve as many arrows off the battlefield as you can carry? I have a plan that just might save us with your help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How many arrows do you have?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You've saved our defensive line here.

This next attack wouldn't have been possible without you.

==Notes==
Entering the [[Kun-Lai Pass]] from [[Binan Village]] on [[Call Out Their Leader]] and [[Hit Medicine]], Hsieh offers this quest. Pick it up before getting started killing and healing.

:{{text|say|Commander Hsieh|Looks like you got more than enough.  Quick, <name>, I think I can see the yaungol reinforcements massing on the horizon.}}

Kill any humanoid yaungol—the yaks don't count. Look specifically for units called "Injured Binan Warrior" to heal. Arrows litter the ground. Once enough regular yaungol are dead, the Fire-Warrior will start spawning on a giant battleyak on the main path. Find him and take him out.
