:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|<Name>, over here.}}

Taylor and Nazgrim are glaring at each other from opposite sides of the room, saying any of the following:
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|You... you escaped me in [[Vashj'ir]]. You won't be so lucky here.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|These people shall not be enslaved by your cruel Horde. I won't allow it!}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Your kind shall never build a foothold here. This is destined to be Horde land.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Soon, you and your Alliance will only be found in Azeroth's history books.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|I'll wait until you're healed to finish you, Nazgrim. Let it not be said that the Alliance has no honor.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Kun-Lai Summit is where you're going to die, orc. I'm going to bury you.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|I hope you have the courage to die bravely, human. I'm in the mood for a good fight.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Only three Horde rats left. Shouldn't be much of a problem to finish you off once and for all.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|[[Rivett Clutchpop|Goblin]], find my axe!  I'll separate this fool human's head from his neck!}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|How many innocents have died at your hand, orc?  Your Horde has no honor...}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|As soon as I can get up, human, I'm going to crush you!}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|My axe will soon feast on your blood, human.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|These pandaren are a wise enough people.  Sooner or later, they will side with the Horde.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Look at the peaceful, kind people of this land. They were born to belong to the Alliance.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|I grow weary of these Horde cowards.  There must be someplace else in this village to rest.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|We must gain a foothold here.. away from these Horde dogs.}}
