==Objectives==
[[File:Path of Conquerors entrance.jpg|thumb|[[Path of Conquerors]] entrance.]]
[[File:Path of Conquerors exit on Whispercloud Rise.jpg|thumb|Path of Conquerors exit to [[Whispercloud Rise]].]]
[[File:Shin and his balloon on Whispercloud Rise.jpg|thumb|[[Shin Whispercloud]] and his balloon on Whispercloud Rise.]]
Speak with [[Mishi]] to travel to the [[Path of Conquerors]]. From there find [[Shin Whispercloud]] at [[Whispercloud Rise]].
*Speak to Mishi outside of [[Tomb of Conquerors|Lei Shen's Tomb]] {{co|53.0|46.4|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Speak to Shin Whispercloud to access [[Zouchin Province]] {{co|63.3|40.2|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] (provided)

==Description==
The villagers of Zouchin know the coast better than anyone in [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]]. If the [[Zandalar]]i are hiding on one of the islands, they will know.

Mishi will take you as far as Emperor's Path. I will go ahead to speak with the village elders.

Follow the path to Whispercloud Rise. Shin Whispercloud will help you reach the village.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 XP

==Progress==
The Zandalari are nearby, <name>.  We must hurry!

==Completion==
The elders have agreed to help us figure out where the Zandalari have hidden the Thunder King's remains.

They have a few conditions, though...

==Notes==
Head upstairs and out. Immediately outside (and not at her previous location) is [[Mishi]]. Speak with her:
:<Mishi looks at you inquisitively.>
:{{gossip|I'm ready to leave.}}

:''She switches to full-size form and flies to the southeast, turning north before passing the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] and drops players off in a shallow circular pool.''
Keep travelling north through the [[Path of Conquerors]] and down the steps. It opens up to [[Whispercloud Rise]]. Speak with [[Lin Whispercloud]] for more background information or find [[Shin Whispercloud]] next to the balloon. Speak with him:
:Seeing scenery this beautiful really puts things into perspective.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to leave.}}

:''The adventurer hops in the hot air balloon with [[Shomi]], who narrates'':
:{{text|say|Shomi|I hope you don't mind sharing the balloon with me. [[Steelbender Doshu|My father]] always told me not to talk to strangers, but you seem friendly.}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|Isn't [[Zouchin Province]] beautiful? I've lived here my whole life.}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|My father thinks it's too dangerous beyond Zouchin's walls for a lady. He only lets me leave when we need supplies from [[One Keg]].}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|The way I see it is, I'm not very good at being a lady, so maybe I'd make a better adventurer like you.}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|[[Zandalari Vanguard|Those ruins]] creep me out. They're so old...}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|Wait... what's that?! Where did all of those huts come from?!}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|Look at those boats! Where are they coming from?!}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|Oh no! Look at [[Zouchin Strand|those huts]]! Why are they attacking defenseless villagers?}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|[[Zouchin Village|My village]] is under attack! I hope my family is alright.}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|It looks like my father was wrong. Even Zouchin can be dangerous!}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|I have to check on my family. Please help us!}}
:''She runs down the path from the hot air balloon landing south toward the village.''

Follow her. Make sure to pick up the flight path! Cho is inside the inn, the [[North Wind Tavern]], along with two of the village elders, [[Elder Chi|Chi]] and [[Elder Hou|Hou]]. They are having a heated conversation...
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I assure you <name> is the best fighter I've ever seen.  <He/She> will be able to better prepare your village.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Hou|Promises, promises!  There is nothing you can do to save us.  The Zandalari are ruthless!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Chi|So negative all the time Hou!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Chi|What is it you plan to do to help us Lorewalker?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|For starters, your villagers need rest.  We can offer you protection long enough to allow them a break.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|<Name> can also teach your villagers to defend themselves.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Hou|Even if we could defend ourselves they outnumber us!  There is no way we will win!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Chi|That may not be true Hou.  The Lorewalker seems confident.  What will your protection cost us?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|All we ask is help in finding Prophet Khar'zul.  You know the surrounding islands better than we do.  Your knowledge would be invaluable.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Chi|Very well.  If you help us fend off the Zandalari, we will help you find the Prophet.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Thank you Elders. We will not dissapoint{{sic}} you.}}
