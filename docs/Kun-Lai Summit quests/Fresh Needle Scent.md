==Objectives==
Gather 100 Pungent Sprite Needles.
*[[Pungent Sprite Needles]] (100)

==Description==
Say, if you really are here to help, I could use me some needles off them [[sprite]]s in [[Pranksters' Hollow]].

The [[grummle]]s don't believe in luck they can't smell. They'll pay better for yaks that have that fresh needle scent.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Mmm. Nothing like the fresh scent of needle.

==Completion==
You just earned me a handsome bonus. Getting those needles is a pain in the paw but worth it when we take our yaks to market. Here, for your troubles.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Missing Muskpaw]] before heading out.

The sprites are found in groups of three outside the cave to the southwest as well as inside, and drop 3 needles each on average. Make sure to hit quota for Fresh Needle Scent before turning in to {{NPC||Muskpaw Jr.}} at the bottom of [[Pranksters' Hollow]]. A sprite is on Junior's head, so kill it before talking to him.

==Progression==
{{Lao & Son's Yakwash}}
