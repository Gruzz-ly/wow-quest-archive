{{Dialogue|
Vol'jin was a friend of mine, once upon a time. It has been many years since our paths crossed.

{{Gossip|What happened to Vol'jin?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Vol'jin's body was found in a well a few days ago.

A poison flows through his veins that is halting his regeneration. This was designed to kill a troll.

If I had to guess, I would say this wound was made by an assassin's hand. And one who is not from Pandaria.

{{Gossip|I want to ask something else.}}}}}}

;Vol'jin
{{Dialogue|
<Vol'jin lays on the floor unconscious and barely breathing.>
