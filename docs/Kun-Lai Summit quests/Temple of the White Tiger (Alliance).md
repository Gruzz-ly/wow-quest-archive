This quest is an optional breadcrumb to the opening of the [[Gate of the August Celestials]] quest chain. In [[Patch 5.4.0]], its text was changed significantly to reflect the corruption of the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Anduin Wrynn}} at the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

== Description ==
Have you heard the news, traveller? There's been at attack at one of our most sacred places, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms!

Even now, there's a human prince within the White Tiger Temple arguing that you and the other races from beyond the mists should be allowed within.

The temple is in the northeast of Kun-Lai. Maybe you can convince the White Tiger to allow you inside?

I only hope the Vale has not been utterly destroyed... 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|70}}
*97,000 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
<Class>, I'm glad you're here! The "Vale of Eternal Blossoms" is legendary among the Pandaren. It's a place of great healing, if the locals are to be believed.

But the Horde Warchief has done something to the Vale - something terrible.

We need to get in there!

==Notes==
Inside the main temple building as the player arrives, {{NPC||Xuen}} is holding court with {{NPC||Taran Zhu}}, {{NPC||Zhi the Harmonious}}, {{NPC||Anduin Wrynn}} and {{NPC||Sunwalker Dezco}} in attendance.
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Half of the Vale lies in ruin! These outsiders have been more destructive than the mantid and mogu combined!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Give us a chance to put things right.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Great Tiger, the strangers from beyond the mists, they cannot be trusted. The wreckage in the Jade Forest can attest to this.}}

When talked to, Anduin has this to say:
:Oh, hello, <name>.
:Your timing couldn't be better.

==Original version==
{{Rfg-section|5.4.0}}
This quest and associated dialogue were reworded after [[Garrosh Hellscream]] caused the corruption of much of the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] in [[patch 5.4.0]]. Formerly, it focused on the historic nature of the opening of the gates for the first time in many years. The NPCs discussed incursions by the [[Mogu]] instead of the attack by Hellscream, although [[Taran Zhu]]'s objections to the Horde and Alliance remained the same.

;Description
:Have you heard the news, traveller? After thousands of years, the [[Golden Lotus]] has petitioned the [[August Celestial|celestials]] to open the gates to the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]]!

:Even now, there's a human prince within the White Tiger Temple arguing that you and the other races from beyond the mists should be allowed within.

:The Temple is in the northeast of Kun-Lai. Maybe you can convince the White Tiger to allow you inside?

:This is a truly historic moment...

;Completion
:<Class>, I'm glad you're here! The Pandaren tell of a legendary place, the "[[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]]." It's a place of great healing, if the locals are to be believed.

:Between the destruction of the [[Shattering|Cataclysm]], and the horrors of this light-forsaken war, the Vale may be our best hope for healing the wounds of the world.

:We need to get in there!

;NPC dialogue
:{{text|say|Zhi the Harmonious|...I've seen them with my own eyes: [[Mogu]] legions, storming the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]] in force. We are not trained for mass combat!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The [[Alliance]] - and even the [[Horde]] - we can help you.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Great Tiger, the strangers from beyond the mists, they cannot be trusted. The wreckage in the Jade Forest can attest to this.}}
