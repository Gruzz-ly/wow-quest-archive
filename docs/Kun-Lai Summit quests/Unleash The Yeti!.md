==Objectives==
Kill 4 Cagemasters.
*[[Cagemaster]] slain (4)

==Description==
Your yeti ride gave me an idea. [[The Ook of Dook]] has a pet yeti he named [[Chomp Chomp]].

He uses this yeti to scare other hozen in to making him the leader hozen. We need to get rid of that yeti.

Go to [[Dooker Dome]] northwest of here and defeat some of the Cagemasters so Chomp Chomp is not tied up as much.

[[Brother Yakshoe|Yakshoe]] and I will meet you there with lots of incense and a dirty yak.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 XP

==Progress==
We found a yak. Did you take out some hozen?

==Completion==
Ready for the yeti?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Rabbitsfoot|Meet us at Dooker Dome. We need to find some incense and a dirty yak.}}
Pick up [[Grummle! Grummle! Grummle!]] before heading out.

Go northwest past [[Knucklethump Hole]] to reach the [[Dooker Dome]]. Five [[Packless Packer]]s will join the party. Look for Grummlepacks on the ground in the half of the dooker dome camp closer to the burlap trail. Once five have been found, move further in to camp. Plenty of Cagemasters are stationed on the outside of the big cage holding [[Chomp Chomp]]. Kill four. Both grummles have relocated right next to the entrance of the cage, so turn in there instead back at the waystation.

==Progression==
