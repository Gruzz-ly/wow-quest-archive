==Description==
The yaungol of [[Fire Camp Ordo]] are a dire threat. I need you to head northwest and take out their leader.

Unfortunately, his four subordinates are maintaining a fire barrier that prevents us from getting to him in the adjoining cave.

Take them out and the shield will come down. You'll find them in their tents, channeling.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
* 161000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The Ordo lieutenants are dead. The shield is down.>

<nowiki><Time to take out the Ordo leader!></nowiki>

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Admiral Taylor|Ordo Ragemesa is right on our border, <name>. I need you to bring that shield down now or we're lost.}}

Pick up [[Barrels of Fun (Alliance)]] and [[Pandaren Prisoners (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Start freeing pandaren and looting barrels. The barrels are unique, so pick one up, run it to a oil rig, place it, and run away and repeat. The four yaungol are found in tents marked by fire lines exiting their central poles. When the fourth yaungol is dead, In Tents will complete automatically. Turn it in and pick up [[The Ordo Warbringer (Alliance)]], then go kill [[Ordo Warbringer]] before heading back.
