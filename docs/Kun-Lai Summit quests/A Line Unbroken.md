*[[Shado-Master Zhiyao]] Released From his Oath {{co|30.3|60.1|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[Liu of the Thousand Blows]] Released From his Oath {{co|30.2|62.5|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[Shiya Boldblade]] Released From her Oath {{co|30.0|64.4|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
When we regrouped after their initial attack, we numbered three less. You can fight, and we must plan our defense should these cursed [[yaungol]] attack again.

If you would help us, grant our fallen comrades their last rites, and recover their armor. You will find their bodies to the west, near the gate.

And try to keep the birds off them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Our comrades, are they at rest?

==Completion==
Good. I will see to it that the armor is returned to their pupils.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Honor, Even in Death]] before heading out.

Head down the hill past the battlefield refreshment device and then back up the halfway-cut stairs to find Zhiyao surrounded by a ring of yaungol corpses. Start killing vultures. Then head all the way down toward the gate. On the right side of the path ~100 yards from the gate is Liu, not far from the bonfire. Shiya is right next to the gate on its left side.

The phase changes on completion of both quests - the battlefield has been taken by the Osul, who have planted several catapults! Lin offers the next quest.
