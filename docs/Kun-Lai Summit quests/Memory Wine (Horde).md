;Scene
:{{Text|say|Shan Kien|Are the preparations complete?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Dreadweaver Avartu]]|Yes, Warlord. The traps are set. The [[:Divine Bell]] will be safe within this crypt, ready for the day that the [[Lei Shen|Thunder King]] returns.}}
:{{Text|say|Dreadweaver Avartu|We have but to evacuate the workers and the rest of our [[warrior]]s.}}
:{{Text|say|Shan Kien|There is no time. The [[Shado-Pan]] [[tracker]]s are too close. They cannot learn the location of the Bell.}}
:{{Text|say|Dreadweaver Avartu|Very well, then. May the [[ghost]]s of our brothers guard this place for all eternity.}}
:{{Text|say|Shan Kien|Their sacrifice will not be in vain.}}
:{{Text|say|Shan Kien|And neither, Avartu, will yours.}}
:''Shan Kien kicks Avartu back into the tomb and uses sha power to collapse the entrance.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|You have seen where this Divine Bell is hidden? Very good. [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] will be pleased. We will try to locate the site you describe, and will contact you as soon as we find it.}}

[[Vol'jin]] sends the player this [[mail]]:

{{book|The Divine Bell|content=Friend-

[[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] be looking for "[[Divine Bell|The Divine Bell]]." The [[Shado-Pan]] heard of it. Say it never been found. Tell me it should stay that way.

But the [[Alliance]] come here just this morning. Asking questions. Looking for the same bell. What can we do, <name>? I rather see it in [[Horde]] hands.

Still too weak to move. You going to have to handle this one.
