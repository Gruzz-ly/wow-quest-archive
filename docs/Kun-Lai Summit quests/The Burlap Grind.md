==Objectives==
Feed the Flask of Kafa to [[Kota Kon]] at [[Kota Basecamp]], then kill 100 [[Hozen]] along The [[Burlap Trail]].
*Burlap Trail Hozen Slain (100)
*[[Flask of Kafa]] (provided)

==Description==
Okayyy... well, she's not eating anybody. That's a good start.

She must want more kafa, but we gotta give her somethin' to do with all the extra energy...

I got it! The Burlap Trail! She can smash hozen out there all day!

<Burrberry turns to the massive beast.>

What do you think, pretty girl? Wanna smash hozens?!

I think so. Here, feed her my emergency flask of kafa. She likes you.

==Progress==
Don't push our luck... we promised her hozens-smashies.

==Completion==
Wow! That was VIOLENT!

Not sure what I was expecting...

Thanks to you, I think we may have just formed a mutually beneficial relationship with the Terror of Kota Peak.

==Notes==
Talk to [[Kota Kon]]:

Players hop on her back, where she has 1,969,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Leap Smash|range=30-60|Kota Kon leaps to the target location, annihilating nearby enemies when she lands. Clears the cooldown on Hozen Snack.|notes=Instant.|cd=10 sec}}
*{{abilities|Headbutt|range=25|Kota Kon lashes out with her horns, dealing damage and knocking back enemies in a cone in front of her.|notes=Instant.|cd=3 sec}}

Out in the field to the east are [[Broketooth Leaper]]s, [[Broketooth Ravager]]s, [[Ookin Marauder]]s, [[Ookin Shaman]], [[Silverback Piker]]s, and [[Silverback Smasher]]s. They are all level 88 hozen with 271,000 health. Go nuts.

This completes the "Kota Peak" portion of [[Slum It in the Summit]].
