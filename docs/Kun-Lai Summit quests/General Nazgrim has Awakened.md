==Notes==
On approaching Nazgrim:
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|<Name>, over here.}}
Taylor and Nazgrim are glaring at each other from opposite sides of the room, saying any of the following:
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|You escaped me in [[Vashj'ir]]. You won't be so lucky here.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|These people shall not be enslaved by your cruel Horde. I won't allow it!}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|We must gain a foothold here... away from these Horde dogs.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Your kind shall never build a foothold here. This is destined to be Horde land.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Soon, you and your Alliance will only be found in Azeroth's history books.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|I'll wait until you're healed to finish you, Nazgrim. Let it not be said that the Alliance has no honor.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Kun-Lai Summit is where you're going to die, orc. I'm going to bury you.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|I hope you have the courage to die bravely, human. I'm in the mood for a good fight.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Only three Horde rats left. Shouldn't be much of a problem to finish you filth off once and for all.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|As soon as I can get up, human, I'm going to crush you!}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|My axe will soon feast on your blood, human.}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Look at the peaceful, kind people of this land. They were born to belong to the Alliance.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|These pandaren are a wise enough people. Sooner or later, they will side with the Horde.}}
*{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Goblin, find my axe! I'll separate this fool human's head from his neck!}}
*{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|I grow weary of these Horde cowards. There must be someplace else in this village to rest.}}
