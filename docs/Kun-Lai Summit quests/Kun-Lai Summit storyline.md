[[File:VZ-Kun-Lai Summit.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Kun-Lai Summit]] storyline''' takes place after the [[Valley of the Four Winds storyline|Valley of the Four Winds]] and [[Krasarang Wilds storyline]]s during the [[Mists of Pandaria campaign]]. {{NPC||Messenger Grummle}}s show up at [[Stoneplow]], [[Halfhill]], and the [[Grassy Cline]] offering a message from {{NPC||Lorewalker Cho}} in the form of the breadcrumb [[The Road to Kun-Lai]]. The summit can be accessed via the [[Veiled Stair]], which begins at the [[Grassy Cline]] in the northeast part of [[Valley of the Four Winds]]. ''[[The Spring Drifter]]'' offers a free boat ride through the level {{level|mop-max}}-infested [[Ancient Passage]], dropping adventurers off at [[Binan Village]] in the southeast corner of the summit zone.

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Slum It in the Summit]].

Near the end of the [[Shado-Pan Monastery]] quest chain, adventurers have [[My Husband...]] in their quest logs, which is a breadcrumb to the [[Townlong Steppes storyline]].

At [[Binan Village]], the [[yaungol]] are attacking. {{NPC||Lorewalker Cho}} was able to save {{NPC||Taylor||Admiral Taylor}} and {{NPC||General Nazgrim}}, along with a few other members of either faction's forces. Looking to get the pandaren to ally with them, not the opposite faction, the adventurer's faction commander instructs the adventurer to help evacuees from [[Eastwind Rest]] or [[Westwind Rest]].

{{The Road to Kun-Lai}}

A veritable Christmas tree of breadcrumbs light up upon completion: [[Cho's Missive]], [[Muskpaw Ranch (quest)]], [[The Missing Merchant]], and [[The Shado-Pan]]. Additionally, if adventurers have already reached level 88, they can choose to skip directly to the [[Townlong Steppes storyline]] with [[Beyond the Wall]].

Adventurers first run across the [[Shado-Pan]] at the [[Shado-Pan Fallback]], near the [[Firebough Nook]] in the southwest corner of the zone. From there, adventurers travel up to [[Winter's Blossom]], overlooking the [[Ox Gate]], where yaungol are invading. After fending off the attack, {{NPC||Ban Bearheart}} takes adventurers to the [[Shado-Pan Monastery]] in his hot air balloon demanding answers as to why nobody has been able to get any reinforcements of late...

Northeast of [[Westwind Rest|Westwind]] and [[Eastwind Rest|Eastwind]] is [[Lao & Son's Yakwash]]. The yaungol have taken over the [[Muskpaw Ranch]] and the {{NPC||Needle Sprite||needle sprites}} have stolen {{NPC||Lao Muskpaw||Lao Muskpaw's}} son, {{NPC||Muskpaw Jr.}}
