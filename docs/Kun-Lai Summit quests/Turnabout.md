==Objectives==
Collect 5 Blind Rage Essences from [[Blind Rage]]s in [[Firebough Nook]].
*[[Blind Rage Essence]] (5)

==Description==
Our true enemies are the [[sha]], not the [[Yaungol|yungol]].

The sha are emotion manifest. Destructive, yes. But undisciplined. Undisciplined force cannot last. The flood, in dispersion, loses its force. The wildfire burns its fuel.

And, discipline and wisdom can turn their destructive energy against themselves.

Bring me the essences of the sha in the village, and I will explain further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Have you harvested their essences?

==Completion==
Good. Now you will see how to defeat unbridled rage.

I will craft these into a trap for [[Kobai]], the leader of the yaungol. Though he will be snared, and we will defeat him, he is not our ultimate target...

==Notes==
[[Holed Up]] can be completed in parallel with this quest.
