==Objectives==
[[File:Packless Packer.jpg|thumb|[[Packless Packer]].]]
Lead 5 Packless Grummles to Supply Crates near the [[Dooker Dome]].
*[[Packless Packer|Packers]] Packed (5)

==Description==
Now that grummles are rescued, we need to rescue our supplies.

[[The Ook of Dook]] is only chief because he has supplies.

Go to the Dooker Dome area north west of here. Take some grummles with you. Keep them safe and get them near supply crates.

Grummles know what to do from there.

[[Brother Rabbitsfoot|Rabbitsfoot]] and I will meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Grummles are good at carrying things.

==Completion==
Now that hozen king is going to learn why it is bad fortune to cheat grummles.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Unleash The Yeti!]] before heading out.

Go northwest past [[Knucklethump Hole]] to reach the [[Dooker Dome]]. Five [[Packless Packer]]s will join the party.

*{{Text|say|Packless Packer|Bad fortune to be here.}}

Look for [[Grummle Gear]]s on the ground in the half of the dooker dome camp closer to the burlap trail. Once they pick up the pack, they become [[Packed Packer]]s.

*{{Text|say|Packless Packer|Ah! A grummlepack. Most good.}}

Once five have been found, move further in to camp. Plenty of Cagemasters are stationed on the outside of the big cage holding [[Chomp Chomp]]. Kill four. Both grummles have relocated right next to the entrance of the cage, so turn in there instead back at the waystation.

==Progression==
