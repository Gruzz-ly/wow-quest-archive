==Objectives==
Kill 12 Kafa-Crazed Mountain Goats on [[Kota Peak]].
*[[Kafa-Crazed Mountain Goat]] slain (12)

==Description==
I mussed up. Bad.

It's hard work cutting seeds out of kafa berries! But I noticed [[goat|goots]] eat the berries up and give back the seeds... in a day or so.

I fed everything I had to the goots on Kota Peak and now they're nuts! Chargin' everything that moves.

Kota used to be safe for Grummles to gather kafa. Not anymore. Not with them goots. Will you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I shoulda never feed them goots.

==Completion==
Thank you, friend. Let this be a lesson to you: never feed the goots.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Kota Blend]], [[Trouble Brewing]], and [[Gourmet Kafa]] before heading out.

Keenbean will provide one [[Kafa'kota Berry]] on accept, so feel free to sample it.

The path up the mountain starts inside the basecamp to the southwest, marked by waving red flags. Start killing goats, marking "deposits", snagging berry bushes (in bunches of 6-11), and moving further uphill. Keep an eye out for the cave and start killing yeti. Bunches of berries are all over the cave, so don't panic if not many are found outside. Kota Blend will complete automatically as soon as at least 100 berries are in adventurers' bags at one time. Don't turn in the followup, [[A Fair Trade]], until the other three quests are done, as A Fair Trade will drop players off at the base of the mountain on complete.
