==Objectives==
Slay [[mogu]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].
* (0-100%)

==Description==
I think this is what my friends would call a "'target rich environment." As a nicer way of saying "we're surrounded and probably doomed."

You know what this means. We have to kill as many of these mogu as possible! It doesn't matter how you do it, just take them out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How many mogu did you get? A lot? Please say a lot.

==Completion==
That's a lot of mogu down. Hopefully that will thin their ranks enough for us to get out of here.

==Notes==
*Kill: [[Baruk Stoneshaper]]s, [[Baruk Bladeward]]s, [[Saurok Laborer]]s, [[Dokani Bloodbinder]]s, [[Dokani Shadowblade]]s, [[Dokani Warframe]]s, [[Zan-Tien Conjurer]]s, [[Zan-Tien Pikeman]]s, and [[Zan-tien Quilen]], and revive [[Drained Yak]]s. Try to focus on the mogu themselves and the yaks, as they're worth the most, at 4% each.
* [[Ti-Qiang the Bulwark]], [[Huo the Lightning-Fist]], and [[Rui of the Sharpened Blade]] for [[Cut Off the Heads]] are worth 6%.
