==Objectives==
Free 8 Pandaren Prisoners.
*[[Pandaren Prisoner]]s rescued (8)

==Description==
Look, I know the Horde needs recruits, and there's just not enough of us here right now to make a fighting presence of this town.

But I know that the [[yaungol]] over at [[Fire Camp Ordo]], to the northwest, have taken many of my people as prisoners. And I also know that if you would be willing to rescue them from their captivity, they'd more than likely be willing to join the Horde.

What do you say, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please, they need your help! Go, rescue them.

==Completion==
Well, it looks like we've got ourselves a little army, here, thanks to you.

They may not look like much yet, but a little Horde discipline and we'll have them in fighting shape in no time.

By the way, <name>... good work.

==Notes==
Pick up [[In Tents Channeling (Horde)]] and [[Barrels of Fun (Horde)]] before heading out.

Start freeing pandaren and looting barrels. The barrels are unique, so pick one up, run it to a [[Oil platform|oil rig]], place it, and run away and repeat. The four yaungol are found in tents marked by fire lines exiting their central poles. When the fourth yaungol is dead, In Tents will complete automatically. Turn it in and pick up [[The Ordo Warbringer (Horde)]], then go kill [[Ordo Warbringer]] before heading back.

;Upon completion
