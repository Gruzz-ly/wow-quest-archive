==Objectives==
[[File:Stolen Supplies.jpg|thumb|Stolen Supplies.]]
Recover 12 Stolen Supplies from [[Howlingwind Cavern]].
*[[Stolen Supplies]] (8)

==Description==
If you're looking for the best supplies in [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]] you've come to the right place! Oh sure, it looks a bit empty. Don't let appearances deceive you...

Oh, who am I kidding?! Between the [[hozen]] attacks, and the [[sprite]]s pillaging what few supplies we do get, my stock has dwindled to a dangerous level.

If you could help me recover some of my supplies I should have enough to contribute to your journey.

You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you manage to get some of my supplies back?

==Completion==
Oh thank you, <name>! If I just cut off the nibbled pieces and repair the minor damage, I may still be able to sell these.

Once your cart is ready to go I'll have the supplies I promised loaded up!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Instant Courage]] and [[They Stole My Luck!]] before heading out.

Head north out of [[One Keg]] past the flight master, [[Little Cleankite]], up the path with a view of the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] to reach the [[Howlingwind Cavern]]. [[Mischievous Snow Sprite]]s have the four "luckydos" of [[Ji-Lu the Lucky]]. Stolen Supplies are all over the cave system, generally near bigger piles of supplies. [[Hiding Guide]]s are, well, hiding in big pots. Speak with them:
*I'm a little basked filled with grain...
*Nothin' to see here... move along!
*I'm just a little grummle in a scary world.
:{{gossip|Are you sure you don't want to come with me?}}
:Nope! Grummle is safe here.
:{{gossip|Well, you can't just stay in here! You leave me no choice!<br /><Use the Fire Lotus Incense.>}}
:''Out pops an Experienced Guide.''
The guides do help fight.

Gather up all of the quest objectives and then head back.
