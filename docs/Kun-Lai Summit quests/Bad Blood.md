==Objectives==
[[File:Dominance Mage.jpg|thumb|[[Dominance Mage]].]]
[[File:Dominance Knight.jpg|thumb|[[Dominance Knight]].]]
Collect 5 Korune Artifacts from [[Silvermoon Runeseeker]]s, [[Dominance Mage]]s, or [[Dominance Knight]]s.
*[[Korune Artifact]] (5)

==Description==
The [[Explorers' League]] is here to excavate the ruins, and it's my job to protect them.

When we arrived, we found this place crawling with [[Reliquary|blood elves]]. Apparently, the Horde are just as interested in the mogu as we are.

This gives quite an opportunity to thin our enemies' numbers, and steal their findings, too.

Slay any blood elves you find in the ruins, and bring back whatever they are digging up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Progress==
What are those blood elves after?

==Completion==
Well done, <class>. I knew that you could get the job done.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Source of Korune Power]] before heading out.

Head in to [[Mogujia]] proper and start killing [[Dominance Knight]]s, [[Dominance Mage]]s, and [[Silvermoon Runeseeker]]s until five Korune Artifacts drop. Then, head up into the hills and kill the [[Korune Spellweaver]] and loot the Sha-Touched Claw from him.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Sarannha Skyglaive|Good work, <class>. These blood elves are actively researching the mogu. It's clear that Garrosh is searching for artifacts of power, but we won't let him succeed.}}

{{rfptr-section}}
:{{text|say|Sarannha Skyglaive|Not bad, <class>. Our work here is finished for today, but stay sharp. I wouldn't be surprised if your next orders came from Lion's Landing in a few days' time.}}

This quest and [[The Source of Korune Power]] complete "The Korune" portion of [[Operation: Shieldwall (achievement)]].

==Progression==
{{Alliance Pandaren campaign}}
