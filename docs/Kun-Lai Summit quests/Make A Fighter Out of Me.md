==Objectives==
Kill 4 Amani Skirmishers, 4 Gurubashi Hexxers, and 3 Drakkari Frost-Weavers in Zouchin Province.
*[[Amani Skirmisher]] slain (4)
*[[Gurubashi Hexxer (Zandalar Invaders)|Gurubashi Hexxer]] slain (4)
*[[Drakkari Frost-Weaver]] slain (3)

==Description==
Shhh! Don't speak so loudly! My father might hear you.

<[[Shomi]] gestures to [[Steelbender Doshu]].>

My father is delusional! He thinks I should be studying my tea pouring while our village is under attack. It's ridiculous! I have just as much courage as any man. I just don't know how to fight... yet.

That's where you come in. Let me travel with you! I'm a fast learner and I won't get in the way I promise!

Pleaseeeeee!

If we get separated I'll meet you back in the village.

==Progress==
I'll show my father he's wrong about me!

==Completion==
I told you I was a fast learner! I will head back to the village to start training others. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept, [[Shomi]] joins the party as she says:
:{{text|say|Shomi|Alright! Let's get down to business!}}
Pick up [[It Takes A Village]], [[Checking In]], [[Handle With Care (Kun-Lai Summit)]], and [[What's Yours Is Mine]] before heading out.

Skirmishers are in town attacking the defenders, whereas the other two are out at the Vanguard.

First up, talk to [[Exhausted Defender]]s around the village border:
:{{gossip|I'll cover your post. Go rest and be with your family.}}
*{{text|say|I was starting to wonder how long I would be out here.}}
*{{text|say|Those Zandalari will regret attacking Zouchin!}}
*{{text|say|I'm grateful to you, friend.}}
*{{text|say|My poor old bones were starting to get stiff out here.}}
While making the rounds, keep an eye out for [[Volatile Blooms]]. They gather in handfuls of 7-11. Once the defenders have been relieved, go east down the path toward the [[Zandalari Vanguard]]. Kill trolls for blood-stained blades and so Shomi can see what it takes.

Once those four quests are done (feel free to turn them in), head northwest to the [[Zouchin Strand]]. [[Sage Liao]] is on his stomach in the sand.

Aggroing a mob or randomly in combat:
*{{text|yell|Shomi|That'll teach you to mess with my village!}}
*{{text|yell|Shomi|So I stick it with the pointy end, right?}}
*{{text|yell|Shomi|I can't be a figher{{sic}}! I can't be a fighter!}}<br />{{text|yell|Shomi|Ok. Now I can fight!}}
*{{text|yell|Shomi|Revenge is a dish served best by ME!}}
*{{text|yell|Shomi|AHHH! It looked at me!}}
Random lines outside of combat:
*{{text|say|Shomi|An adventurer like you has probably won many battles!}}
*{{text|say|Shomi|If fighting is like dancing I'm in trouble. I'm bad at dancing.}}
*{{text|say|Shomi|I'll show my father I have what it takes to be a great fighter.}}

;In Zouchin Strand
*{{Text|say|Shomi|This beach used to be such a peaceful place. Now it's polluted with these barbarians!}}

On entering the [[Zandalari Vanguard]]
:{{text|say|Shomi|These ruins are supposedly haunted. I don't believe in ghosts, though. Then again, I didn't believe in Zandalari, either.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|ShomI|Thank you for your training, <name>! I hope to one day be as good a fighter as you!}}

Back at town, Shomi has gathered up a handful of Zouchin Villagers and is trying to teach them the basics:
*{{text|say|Shomi|Your enemy will not show you mercy. Give him the same courtesy.}}
*{{text|say|Shomi|Good form is the key to defeating your enemies. Don't swing wildly with your weapon. Be disciplined with your attacks.}}
*{{text|say|Shomi|Do not expose your weaknesses.}}
*{{text|say|Shomi|Confidence in your abilities will go a long way. Overconfidence will quickly get you killed.}}
