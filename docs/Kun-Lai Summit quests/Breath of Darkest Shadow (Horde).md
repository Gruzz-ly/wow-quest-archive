==Objectives==
Witness the ringing of the [[:Divine Bell]].
*Defeat Blademaster [[Ishi]]
*Defeat [[Anduin Wrynn]]

==Description==
It is time, <name>. We have traveled a long path to reach this moment.

Today, our Warchief, [[Garrosh Hellscream]], will change the course of our people's history forever.

Today, we witness the birth of Garrosh's Horde!

Do not let anything interfere with the ceremony!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|34|20}}
*353000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Horde]]
*[[Grand Wyvern]]

==Progress==
We cannot rely on fate or destiny. We must carve out our own future... the future that WE deserve!

==Completion==
They may have destroyed the Divine Bell, but I have taken the life of the Alliance's prodigal son!

It is nothing less than [[Grommash Hellscream|my own father]] would have expected of me.

This victory may have come at a high cost, but it is of little consequence.

I will find other ways to destroy my enemies, and bring glory to the Horde!

==Notes== 
Head up to the platform and an event begins:
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|We are the HORDE. We are slaves to nothing and no one!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|With the Divine Bell, I will burn away any remnants of weakness within us. Fear... despair... hatred... doubt. The lesser races are buried beneath their weight. But WE will control their power.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Together, we will destroy the Alliance and claim what is rightfully ours. Let our song of victory begin.}}
:''Garrosh strikes the bell and the [[Kor'kron Reaver (Kun-Lai Summit)|Kor'kron Reavers]] closest to the bell are transformed into sha. They must all be killed before the script event continues.

While they're still alive, Garrosh will say any of the following at random:
*{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Our victory is all but assured. With the power of the bell on our side, we will be unstoppable.}}
*{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|If our enemies should choose to push us, we will drive them into the ground!}}
*{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|This is but a test of our strength. We will pass this trial, just as we have passed others!}}
*{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Yes! Feel the power within you. Fight your fears. Conquer your hatred!}}

Once the last juggernaut is slain, Anduin will run up:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Stop, Garrosh! You do not know what that bell is capable of!!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Ahahahaha... so in the end, it is not Varian, but his whelp who comes to face me. You run bravely to your death, young one.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I will not let you do this. I swear to it!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Stop me then, human.}}
:''Garrosh strikes the bell again, this time turning Ishi!''
:{{text|say|Ishi|Auugh... Auuuuuugggghhhhh! This pain! I cannot control it!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Fight the sha - master it! Use it!}}

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Ishi|Do you speak the truth, Garrosh? Can the Horde truly survive another war?}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellsceram|Doubt is for the weak! Do not question your strength, Ishi. We will survive because we must! The Horde will prevail!}}

At 75%:
:{{text|say|Ishi|We have lost so much, Warchief. Our families, dead. Our friends, lost. Our homeland, gone. How much more must our people suffer?}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Our suffering is at an end. When this war is won, our people will see prosperity at last.}}

At 50%:
:{{text|say|Ishi|Why should be be slaves to honor, when we could slaughter the children of our enemies while they sleep? My blade thirsts for Alliance blood!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Control your hatred, Ishi. There is killing, and then there is murder. Direct your rage to our enemies.}}

At 25%:
:{{text|say|Ishi|At night, I see the faces of all those I have slain. Where do our spirits go after our bodies lay cold? I fear... death.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Use your fear, Ishi! Turn it on your foes. When death arrives, will you stand and face it or kneel in defeat?}}

Finish Ishi off:
:{{text|say|Ishi|Warchief! I... I have failed you.}}
:''Garrosh walks away from the bell and stands in the center of the platform.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Yes, Ishi. You have.}}
:''Garrosh turns to face Anduin.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Your interference has cost me a great warrior, young prince. You'll pay with your life.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|That is where you are wrong, Garrosh.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The mogu made the Divine Bell to create chaos, but the pandaren created a special mallet to turn the echoes of that chaos into perfect harmony. That mallet was hidden for thousands of years, until now.}}
:''Anduin leaps upward and performs an overhand strike on the Divine Bell, stunning Garrosh and causing the bell to crack violently.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Die, whelp!!}}
:''Garrosh pulls himself together, closes the gap, and strikes at Anduin, but hits the Divine Bell, shattering it. The bell crumples in a heap onto Anduin, who has been crushed within an inch of his life!''

;Upon completion
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|There is much I do not know about this artifact. The weak-willed cannot control this sha energy, but I WILL master it.}}
:''Garrosh turns to face the adventurer.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|At least the human prince is dead. King Wrynn now knows the price of his continued defiance.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Leave me. I have much to think about.}}
:''Garrosh mounts his wyvern and takes off.''
