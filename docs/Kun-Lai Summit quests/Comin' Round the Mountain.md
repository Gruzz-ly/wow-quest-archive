==Objectives==
Escort the cart and guides safely up [[Neverest Mountain]].
*Jump in [[Ji-Lu's Cart]] {{co|57.3|61.6|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Survive the Mountain Pass

==Description==
The mountain path is very dangerous. You need much luck to survive. [[Nephew Bentnail]] will show you the way.

Perhaps today is lucky day to travel though. Wind blows from the east, this is good sign. [[Grummle]]s always travel best when east wind blows.

Climb in the cart when you are ready to leave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|60}}
* 162000 XP

==Progress==
You must be very lucky to survive the pass!

==Completion==
You've arrived just in time, <class>! I was starting to think I would die up here!

==Notes==
Hop in the cart when ready to go.

*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|We can never rest until we get to the top! Heh? Get it?}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Are we there, yeti?}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|This is your first trip up Neverest? It's mine too!}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|I hope this yak knows the way up the mountain because I sure don't!}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Hmmm, maybe I should have taken the cart in for its tune-up after all.}}

The cart has two abilities:
*{{abilities|Spiced Punch|Throws a fistful of spices at the attacker! Feel the burn!|notes=Melee range}}
*{{abilities|Supply Barrage|range=60|Throw anything but the cart at the attackers!}}

Weak [[Knucklethump Attacker]]s stream out of nowhere to attack the cart. Keep them away from the cart, or kill them when they get in the cart.
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Throw a Spiced Punch to knock hozen off the cart!}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Throw a Spiced Punch on hozen who jump on the cart!}}

;Halfway
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|They're gone! Whew! Looks like the trail is clear.}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Looks like we did it! We're in the clear!}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Wheh! Everything should be smooth sailing from here on out!}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|We did it! The trail should be clear from here on.}}

Halfway up the mountain, an elite [[Rampaging Yeti]] will start attacking. Spam the ranged attack to finish it off.
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Auuughh! Yeti on the trail!}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Auuughh! Yeti on the trail! Looks like we aren't in the clear yet!}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Oh great luckydos! What is THAT!?}}
*{{Text|say|Nephew Bentnail|Oh most unluckiest of days! What is THAT!?}}

The cart drops off at [[Neverest Basecamp]]. Speak to [[Lucky Bluestring]] to continue.
