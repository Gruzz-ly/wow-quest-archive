==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kite Master Len]] at [[Winter's Blossom]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]] to take a kite up to the [[Ox Gate]]. Once there, speak to [[Suna Silentstrike]].
*Speak to Kite-Master Len to Take a Kite to the Wall {{co|34.5|59.1|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
They are attacking again!

<[[Lin Silentstrike|Lin]] looks to the Ox Gate.>

Archers... on the wall!

I need you to get up there. My wife Suna went to scout the wall with that fool [[Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Lao-Chen]]{{sic}}. Perhaps if he had spent more time preparing defenses and less building that ridiculous ale lift contraption...

It matters not.  Get a kite from Len, to the west, and then get up there and find my wife. She'll know what to do next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|6}}
*16200 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Lin sent you for me?  How sweet.

==Completion==
Wow, that was quite a bit of kite-flying there. Good job getting up here and not dying.

It's good you're here, too. Lao-chen's{{sic}} got an idea he's working on, but in the meantime we've got [[yaungol]] to deal with.

==Notes==
Head a few yards west to speak with Len:
:I heard from the others... you need a kite to the wall?
:{{gossip|I need a kite to get up to the wall!}}
The kite takes players up to the north tower of the [[Ox Gate]], dropping them in front of [[Suna Silentstrike]] and [[Lao-Chin the Iron Belly]].
