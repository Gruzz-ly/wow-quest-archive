==Objectives==
[[File:Brokendice and Ji-Lu.jpg|thumb|Brokendice and Ji-Lu]]
Return [[Ji-Lu the Lucky]]'s Lucky Virmen's Foot, Yak Shoe, Four Winds Clover, and Gold Coin.
*[[Lucky Virmen's Foot]]
*[[Lucky Yak Shoe]]
*[[Lucky Four Winds Clover]]
*[[Lucky "Gold" Coin]]

==Description==
My journeys through [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]] have taught me two things. First, never sneak up on a sleeping [[yak]]. Second, having luck on your side is both necessary and hard to come by.

The [[grummle]]s believe in carrying a lucky trinket at all times. In my mind if one trinket can sometimes bring luck, then many trinkets would guarantee it!

After arriving in [[One Keg]] my lucky trinkets were stolen by those little menace [[sprite]]s. I'd be truly grateful if you could retrieve them for me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find my lucky trinkets? One can never have too much good luck.

==Completion==
Thank you! It appears my trinkets were lucky for you too, <class>. While you were gone I did not gamble and lose my cart.

I would be happy to lend it to you for your journey. Besides, I have some goods to win back from this [[Brother Brokendice|shady grummle]]!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Instant Courage]] and [[Resupplying One Keg]] before heading out.

Head north out of [[One Keg]] past the flight master, [Little Cleankite]], up the path with a view of the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] to reach the [[Howlingwind Cavern]]. [[Mischievous Snow Sprite]]s have the four "luckydos" of [[Ji-Lu the Lucky]]. Stolen Supplies are all over the cave system, generally near bigger piles of supplies. [[Hiding Guide]]s are, well, hiding in big pots. Speak with them:
*I'm a little basked filled with grain...
*Nothin' to see here... move along!
*I'm just a little grummle in a scary world.
:{{gossip|Are you sure you don't want to come with me?}}
:Nope! Grummle is safe here.
:{{gossip|Well, you can't just stay in here! You leave me no choice!<br /><Use the Fire Lotus Incense.>}}
:''Out pops an Experienced Guide.''
The guides do help fight.

Gather up all of the quest objectives and then head back.
