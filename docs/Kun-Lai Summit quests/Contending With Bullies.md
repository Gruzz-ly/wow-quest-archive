==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Shonuf.jpg|Shonuf|The "Master" of Fireweaving.}}
Defeat Shonuf.
*[[Shonuf]] slain

==Description==
We honor strength here, not brutality. It is unfortunate but there are some who come to my doorstep oblivious to this distinction.

I have turned away one such challenger. In retaliation, he sacked the village of [[Yinying Village|Yinying]].

Go to Yinying Village southeast of [[Temple of the White Tiger|the temple]], and face this "Shonuf." Give him a lesson in true strength.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
It is a fine line between proving one's strength, and bullying.

==Completion==
I commend your victory and thank you for dealing with that ruffian.

==Notes==
Head down to [[Yinying Village]], in the shadow of the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] to the southeast.

==Progression==
