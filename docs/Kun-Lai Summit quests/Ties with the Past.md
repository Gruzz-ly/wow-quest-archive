==Objectives==
Recover the Spirit Essence of [[Varatus the Conqueror|Varatus]].
*[[Spirit Essence of Varatus]]

==Description==
While I was in the Vale, I came across an ancient [[pandaren]] recipe for [[:Memory Wine]]. I believe this brew can coax some helpful information out of [[Shan Kien]].

I am needed here, so I have no choice but to ask you to recover the essential ingredient for me. We need the spirit essence of a [[mogu]] that lived in the time of the memory we wish to see.

You should be able to find just such a [[ghost|spirit]] inside the Path of Conquerors, to the northeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Progress==
You never know what you will find in a book. Especially an ancient pandaren one.

I'm eager to see how this Memory Wine works.

==Completion==
Ah, very good. This is the last thing we needed.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Well done. Now I will just add a hair from our prisoner, Shan Kien, and combine the ingredients.}}

==Progression==
