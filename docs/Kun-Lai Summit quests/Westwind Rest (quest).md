==Description==
<[[Taylor|Admiral Taylor]] winces in pain.>

[[Jade Forest]] was a disaster.

[[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]'s gone. We lost some good people. We didn't stop the [[Horde]] from advancing into the [[Pandaria|continent]].

But I think I've found a way to get the locals on our side. You just helped fight off some of these "[[yaungol]]", no?

I hear yaungol sacked [[Westwind Rest]], a local village. We've been told that two groups of survivors have camped out along the road west out of town.

We help them out, maybe they'll consider siding with the [[Alliance]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 XP

==Progress==
I will not rest until our people are returned and this village rebuilt.

==Completion==
Well... we are alive, and that is better than we could have hoped for without your help.

But, if this is truly to become a base of operations for you, and if we are to join your [[Alliance]], there is one more thing you must do to guarantee our security.

==Notes==
Exit Binan and pass through the battleground of [[Kun-Lai Pass]]. Follow the road until it reaches the fork. Alongside a handful of unfriendly evacuees is [[Farmhand Bo]]:
:The... the yaungol!
:They attacked my farm, and the nearby village, Westwind Rest... killed some of us, and the ones they didn't kill they chased off!
:I managed to gather some of us here. Any word on help coming from Binan?
''{{gossip|I'm from the Alliance. We're here to save you and rebuild your village.}}''
:{{text|say|Farmhand Bo|I don't know about this "Alliance", but you look trustworthy. I'll gather everyone up and meet you when we're ready to rebuild!}}

Turn left, heading southwest. At the next fork is Elder Tsulan:
:As dark as things seem, I must not give up hope. We must not be cowed by the violence of the Yaungol.
:You... have come to help us?
''{{gossip|I'm from the Alliance. We're here to save you and rebuild your village.}}''
:{{text|say|Elder Tsulan|Someone has come to save us? Perhaps all is not lost...}}

Speak with him again.
