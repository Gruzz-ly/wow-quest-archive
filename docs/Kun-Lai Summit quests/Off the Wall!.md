==Objectives==
[[File:Osul Veteran Archer.jpg|thumb|[[Osul Veteran Archer]].]]
[[File:Osul Fire-Warrior.jpg|thumb|[[Osul Fire-Warrior]].]]
Kill 12 [[Osul Veteran Archer]]s or [[Osul Fire-Warrior]]s.
*Osul Yaungol slain (12)

==Description==
The [[yaungol]] on the wall here are providing covering fire for the ones below. I don't know what [[Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Lao-chen]]{{sic}} is thinking, but I want you to deal with these archers.

The good news is, up here we've got the spirit of the Ox helping us. When they're weakened, the ox spirit will stun them and you can use it to knock 'em off the wall.

You'll find archers just out that door.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Come on, come on.

==Completion==
Ha! I could see them flying. Good work.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|Crush these invaders, and hurl them from the wall!}}

Pick up [[A Terrible Sacrifice]] before heading out.

Step outside to the northwest and get killing. These mobs do not drop any loot, so feel free to have some fun and kick the yaungol off the wall once they drop below 30%.
