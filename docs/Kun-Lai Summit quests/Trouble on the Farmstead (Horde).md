==Objectives==
Speak with [[Farmer Chow]] at the [[Chow Farmstead]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

==Description==
I... I escaped from Farmer Chow's, to the southeast of here. It's been taken over by [[yaungol]], but the old man and his wife just won't give it up!

Please, go there and help him out. Maybe if you do, he'll be willing to send some folks back here and help you guys farm up some food for the new town?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're a sight for sore eyes, <class>.

I'll be glad to help you [[Horde]] fellas out. First though, you need to help me get my farm back.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Round 'Em Up (Horde)]], [[Best Meals Anywhere!]], [[Deanimate the Reanimated (Horde)]], and [[Mogu?! Oh No-gu! (Horde)]] before heading out. Down to the southeast to the farm.
