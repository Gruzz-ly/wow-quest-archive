*Garrosh distracted {{co|58.6|83.8|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[Weathered Journal]] {{co|58.2|84.2|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[Grummle Disguise Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
I've noticed Garrosh and that [[Reliquary]] [[blood elf]] carrying around some sort of journal.

The journal is never more than a stone's throw away.  It must be important!

If you can cause enough of a distraction, you may be able to swipe the journal off the table.

These yaks might just do the trick.  Give one of 'em a tap and they'll do the rest.

Just be ready to move fast!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Progress==
What did you find?

==Completion==
Phew!  That was a close one!  I never doubted you for a minute though.

Now let me take a look at that journal...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bugging Out]] before heading in to camp. And put on the [[Grummle Disguise Kit]]!

Walk in to camp from the east entrance, near the three [[Shaggy Longhorn]]s. Wait until Nero moves south toward the pile of supplies and the southern entrance before moving in. Interact with one longhorn to spook it. Garrosh will run down to the bonfire and yell:
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Get those mangy beasts under control!}}

Then interact with the other two! Keep moving west and duck inside the big tent between the shaghorns and Garrosh's (former) location to bug it. On the table Garrosh was standing at is the [[Weathered Journal]]. Further west is the small tent bug location. Wait there until Garrosh moves back to the table. Finally, head south to interact with the statue on the pile of supplies. Exit to the south and circle around back to Goottooth.

Every three minutes, Garrosh will start an interesting conversation with Reliquary member [[Delia Sunseeker]], who is examining the smoldering remains of the [[yaungol]] totem.  If you stand on the ridge above Delia, you'll be close enough to see it and not even have to wear the disguise.

: {{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Keep looking, Reliquary.  We will find it.  The bell is meant to ensure Horde victory.  I feel it in my bones.}}
: ''Delia Sunseeker stands and turns around to address Garrosh.''
: {{text|say|Delia Sunseeker|We've been searching for days.  All we have found are dusty scrolls and broken statues.}}
: {{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|We're close!  These documents all mention the bell and [[Kun-Lai Summit]].  It must be here.}}
: {{text|say|Delia Sunseeker|What if the Divine Bell is in disrepair too?  Are you certain you can use it even if we do find it?}}
: {{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|I will concern myself with how it works once I have it in my possessions{{Sic}}, Blood Elf.}}
: {{text|say|Delia Sunseeker|Perhaps the [[mogu]] hid the bell for a reason, Warchief.}}
: {{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|The Divine Bell is a weapon of unquestionable power.  It belongs in horde{{Sic}} hands.  It belongs to me!}}
: ''Delia returns to her examination.''

{{book|Weathered Journal|content=In the one-hundred-and-seventieth year of the Thunder King's reign, the [[Korune Spellweaver|Korune spellweavers]] came to [[Lei Shen]] with their greatest creation.

A bell cast from the makers' flesh, shaped by stars' fire, and bound by the breath of darkest shadow.  This bell, when rung, could shake the world and call to the heavens.

Taken to war, the bell's cacophonous tones stirred the hearts of Lei Shen's warriors.  It fueled their hatred and anger, lending them strength on the field of battle.  The bell's screaming voice struck fear and doubt into the hearts of the Emperor's enemies, sending them fleeing in his path.

Awed by its power, the Thunder King described the instrument as "the voice of the gods," and named it [[Divine Bell|Shenqing, the Divine Bell]].}}


Turning in He Won't Even Miss It completes the "The Voice of the Gods" portion of [[Operation: Shieldwall Campaign]]. On completion of both:
:{{text|say|Cousin Goottooth|So Garrosh is looking for something called the Divine Bell? Whatever that is, it can't be good. I'll get this information back to headquarters.}}
:{{text|say|Cousin Goottooth|Excellent work! I'll be in touch soon.}}
