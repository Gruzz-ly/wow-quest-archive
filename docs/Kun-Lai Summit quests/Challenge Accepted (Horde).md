{{questportrait|Ur-Bataar.jpg||Ur-Bataar, Champion of the Yaungol}}
== Objectives ==
Set the [[Yaungol Banner]] ablaze to summon and defeat Ur-Bataar.
*[[Ur-Bataar]] slain

== Description ==
The yaungol have always been a difficult, proud people, but never this violent or aggressive. 

I do not know what has prompted this change in their behavior, but we don't have time to find out, now. We fear for our lives and livelihoods as long as Ur-Bataar, leader of the Bataari yaungol, lives.

Go, set the banner in his camp ablaze to challenge him, and then defeat him in battle. Only then will we be secure.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 161000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
As long as Ur-Bataar lives, we cannot have peace.

==Completion==
You did it! At the very least, we have justice, and safety, though in the process we have lost so much.

Regardless, it has been decided. We will join the Horde, and with your help, rebuild this village.

==Notes==
Head due east from the quest giver to reach [[Fire Camp Bataar]]. The banner is on the north side of the encampment. Kill all of the {{NPC||Bataari Banner Guard}}s before interacting with the banner, as they will ''all'' aggro if they're not dead. Set it ablaze and {{NPC||Ur-Bataar}} will jump in from the southwest:
:{{Text|say|Bataari Banner Guard|Intruder!}}
:{{text|yell|Ur-Bataar|Fool! I will crush you!}}
He is a level 87 yaungol with 429,000 health and acts as a warrior with [[Bloodthirst]], [[Cleave]], and [[Enrage]].

Kill him:
:{{text|say|Ur-bataar|No! Kun-Lai was ours....}}
Head back to Eastwind, which is still ablaze.

On complete, a cutscene:
:''The pandaren run in and start putting out fires. Shortly after, General Nazgrim runs in with the rest of the Horde forces, plants a banner, and sets up camp.''
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Good work, friend. Speak with Kiryn and Rivett while I assess our new surroundings.}}
Lots of quests offered: [[Round 'Em Up (Horde)]] from Nazgrim, [[Best Meals Anywhere!]] from Rivett, [[Mogu?! Oh No-gu! (Horde)]] from Shiao, [[Deanimate the Reanimated (Horde)]] from Kiryn, [[Trouble on the Farmstead (Horde)]] from Farmer Ko.

This completes the "Eastwind Rest" portion of [[Slum It in the Summit]].

==Progression==
{{The Road to Kun-Lai}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Description
The deeply resonant howl of challenge issues forth from a place to the southwest known as the [[Yaungol Tug]]. This is where the [[yaungol]] have laid their claim upon [[Kun-Lai Summit]] as is their tradition.
 
You know that if you do not go there and defeat their champion, the [[Horde]] will not be able to hold [[Easterly Rest]] for long.
