==Objectives==
Ride Mobi with Chen and [[Li Li Stormstout|Li Li]] to the Gate of August Celestials.
* Speak to [[Chen Stormstout|Chen]] to ride [[Mobi]]
* Ride Mobi to the [[Gate of the August Celestials]]

==Description==
It is most fortuitous that you found this brew, and a [[yak]] to carry it on!

But we cannot remain here. Li Li has healed me up enough to travel. We can ride the yak back to the gate and hope that the [[mogu]] do not notice our passing.

Let me know when you are ready to leave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We got through! Now, what are we going to do about all those mogu?

==Notes==
;Speak to Chen to ride Mobi
: Well, this is a fine mess. But not one that has to doom us.

{{gossip|I'm ready to ride.}}

: ''With Li Li on Mobi's head and the player behind the head, Mobi takes off down the road back to the Gate of the August Celestials. Chen is in the saddle, but backwards to examine the kegs.''

:{{text|say|Li Li Stormstout|We're in the middle of a mogu invasion, and you're thinking about brew?!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I'm always thinking about brew! Especially when things look grim. Now, let's see...}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|We have a Goldendraft... Five Blossom Sour, ooh ooh!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li Stormstout|Uncle, this really isn't a good time...}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|A Traveling Lager from the Wanderbrew! Oh, that's a rare one.}}
: ''Li Li expresses some exasperation.''
:{{text|say|Li Li Stormstout|Uncle Chen!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Look, this one's a Stormstout! The Brew of the Four Winds. I'll just take a little sip.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Oh. Are we there already?}}
