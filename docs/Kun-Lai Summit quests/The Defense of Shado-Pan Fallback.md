==Objectives==
Kill 15 Sha-Infested Yaungol.
*[[Sha-Infested Yaungol]] slain (15)

==Description==
I sent for reinforcements from the [[Shado-Pan Monastery]], but have heard nothing back. We have already lost [[Firebough Nook|the town]].

A few lucky villagers may have survived, but we are pinned down here.

We do not have time to entertain strangers. If you can fight, help my men defend this tower. If not, leave, for you will not survive long here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Have you dealt with the yaungol yet?

==Completion==
You have bought us some time to breathe. We must not despair - instead, we must act.

==Notes==
Yaungol continually spawn and attack the Shado-Pan Guards near the doors. Quest credit is awarded even for yaungol that the player only lands a few hits on before the guards finish off.

After the fifteenth kill:
:{{text|say|Shado-Pan Guard|Thank you, <name>. You fight well for one not of our order. I can handle the rest from here.}}

==Progression==
{{Firebough Nook}}
