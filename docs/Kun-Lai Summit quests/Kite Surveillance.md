==Objectives==
Ride [[Chen Stormstout|Chen's]] Kite to scout the [[Mogu]] armies.
* [[Chen's Kite]] mounted
* [[Mogu]] Armies surveyed

==Description==
We heard for ourselves that there were mogu attacking, but I had no idea it would be this many!

There must be a way to stop them before they completely overrun the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]]. Quickly, let us fly over and scout out their numbers.

We just so happen to have a [[kite]] that can carry three people. Usually it's more, but I had a big lunch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh no, we went down hard. Uncle Chen can't get up! And there are mogu everywhere!

It's okay. It's fine. We'll think of something.

:{{Text|Say|Chen Stormstout|Wait, down there! An abandoned brew [[caravan]]!}}
: ''As the kite continues east toward [[Eastwind Rest]], two of the mogus' cannons fire balls of lightning at the kite.''
:{{Text|Say|Li Li Stormstout|Uncle, look out!}}
: ''Chen immediately swerves to the north, but the kite's tail is hit and set on fire.''
:{{Text|Say|Chen Stormstout|I cannot steer! Hold on!}}
: ''Two more balls of lightning strike the kite just before it reaches [[Mogujia]] and the screen briefly goes black. The player is parachuted to safety at {{Coords|60.38|76.34|Kun-Lai Summit}}. Up ahead in the ruins, Li Li is standing beside an injured Chen laying on the ground, and what's left of the kite is a big ball of flames.''
