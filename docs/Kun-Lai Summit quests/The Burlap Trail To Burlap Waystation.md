==Objectives==
Protect a group of [[grummle]]s to the [[Burlap Waystation]]. At least one grummle must survive.

If you lose your grummles, you can search the [[Burlap Trail]] or return to [[One Keg]] and wait for the next group to leave.
*Escort grummles to the Burlap Waystation

==Description==
Bad fortune for grummles today. [[Hozen]] have begun to ravage! They attack our supply line to the [[Serpent's Spine]].

Can you help? We are not fighters. We are grummles. Good fortune to those who help grummles.

Go with a group of grummles to the Burlap Waystation. Keep them safe. Make sure at least one grummle survives.

Grummles shall reward. Grummles always reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Burlap Ritual Bag]] and {{cost|10|60}} (or {{cost|13|62}} if completed at level 90)
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Good fortune to friends of grummles.

==Completion==
Many thanks and fortune to you, friend of grummles. But the journey to the Serpent's Spine is not safe yet.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Lintpocket|I show you on your map where grummles are now. Find them or wait here for the next wave of grummles.}}
