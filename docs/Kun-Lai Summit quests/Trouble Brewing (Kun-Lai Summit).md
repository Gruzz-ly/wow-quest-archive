==Objectives==
Kill 5 Kafa-Crazed Yetis in the caves on [[Kota Peak]].
*[[Kafa-Crazed Yeti]] slain (5)

==Description==
Lots of [[yeti]]s in Kota, yup. Usually not too dangerous. Usually just eat [[goat|goots]].

Then they ate [[Kafa-Crazed Mountain Goat|the goots full of kafa]]...

<[[Uncle Keenbean|Keenbean]] shoots [[Cousin Gootfur|Gootfur]] a mean glance.>

Now they're moody, cranky, sleep a lot but never seem rested. Typical [[kafa]] addicts.

Gonna come outta those caves soon, I'm sure. Come lookin' for more kafa.

Then we all in trouble.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]
*10x [[Cup of Kafa]]

==Progress==
Don't wanna fight yetis? Can't say I blame you.

==Completion==
You made it!

Yetis are tough enough on their own - can't imagine what a cranky kafa-addict yeti must be like. You brave. Or lucky. Or dumb.

Maybe all three.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Kota Blend]], [[Shut it Down]], and [[Gourmet Kafa]] before heading out.

The path up the mountain starts inside the basecamp to the southwest, marked by waving red flags. Start killing [[Kafa-Crazed Mountain Goat]]s, marking [[Kafa'goot "Deposit"|Kafa'goot "Deposits"]], snagging [[Kafa'kota Bush]]es (each containing 6-11 [[Kafa'kota Berry|Kafa'kota Berries]]), and moving further uphill. Keep an eye out for the cave and start killing yeti. Bunches of berries are all over the cave, so don't panic if not many are found outside. Kota Blend will complete automatically as soon as at least 100 berries are in adventurers' bags at one time. Don't turn in the followup, [[A Fair Trade]], until the other three quests are done, as A Fair Trade will drop players off at the base of the mountain on complete.
