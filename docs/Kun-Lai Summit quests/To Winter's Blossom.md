==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lin Silentstrike]] at [[Winter's Blossom]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

==Description==
The battle against the [[Sha]] is eternal - we can not leave this place.

But I am troubled by the absence of reinforcements from the [[Shado-Pan Monastery|Monastery]] given that we sent for them days ago.

You have performed admirably, perhaps you could travel to Winter's Blossom, our base camp on the way to the Shado-Pan Monastery. Speak with Lin Silentstrike once you arrive - he should know what is happening. To get there, travel north of the village and follow the road through [[Shado-Li Basin]] to Winter's Blossom.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|6}}
*16200 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
[[Shado-Master Chong]] sent you, hmm?

Yes, we received his request for reinforcements.

We are in no position to grant it, however. We've just concluded a battle of our own, and the monastery's been locked up tight. We can't even get reinforcements here, and we're just down the hill!

==Notes==
Follow the path northwest up the mountain. Before reaching Winter's Blossom, though, is the [[Kota Basecamp]], a [[grummle]] camp. Pick up the flight path from [[Uncle Eastwind]]! They offer quests, starting with [[Kota Blend]], [[Trouble Brewing]], [[Shut it Down]], [[Gourmet Kafa]], and [[The Rabbitsfoot]]. Do the grummle quests or not, then keep heading up the path through the [[Shado-Li Basin]] to the northwest to reach [[Winter's Blossom]]. Pick up the flight path from [[Kite Master Len]]!

Both Lin and [[Ban Bearheart]] offer the next quests.
