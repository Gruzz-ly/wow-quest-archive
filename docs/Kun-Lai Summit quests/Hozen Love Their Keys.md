==Objectives==
[[File:Old Poot Poot.jpg|thumb|[[Old Poot Poot]].]]
Get the Yeti Shackle Key from [[Cho Cho the Wicked]] and release Old Poot Poot.
*[[Yeti Shackle Key]] {{co|32.4|14.4|Knucklethump Hole}} / {{co|48.8|59.0|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Release [[Old Poot Poot]] {{co|38.7|23.1|Knucklethump Hole}}/ {{co|48.9|59.1|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
The [[hozen]] have a [[yeti]]! They call it Old Poot Poot and keep it at the back of their cave.

Hozen are normally scared of yeti, but now they feed it grummles.

They have a Hunter Chief, Cho Cho the Wicked. Can you see if he has a key on him to the yeti shackles?

Bad fortune for hozen if a yeti is loose in their fort.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A luckydo would be wise never to travel near a yeti on a dirty yak.

==Completion==
Oh wow that looked like one wild ride!

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Snackrifice]] and [[Thumping Knucklethump]] and Hozen Love Their Keys before heading out.

Head north to [[Knucklethump Hole]], start killing hozen and freeing grummles. Grummles hanging from ropes can be freed by simply doing damage to the ropes. In the very back of the cave is [[Cho Cho the Wicked]]. Make sure The Snackrifice and Thumping Knucklethump are both complete at this point. Kill him to loot the key, then use it on the ball and chain behind [[Old Poot Poot]]. Poot will snag the player then run out of the cave, killing Knuckethump victims along the way. Poot will drop adventurers off back at the Burlap Waystation, so turn in all three quests then.

On return to Rabbitsfoot:
