Collect a Sha-Touched Claw from the [[Korune Spellweaver]].
*[[Sha-Touched Claw]] {{co|58.1|71.0|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
Why hullo there! Have ya ever seen tha like o' these statues? Fascinatin'!

I was scouting up along the ruins earlier, and I spotted somethin' innerestin' up on the highest rise.

I couldn't get close enough, but I think it might be one o' these mogu statues, 'cept it was movin'!

I can't get through all those [[Reliquary|nasty blood elves]], but you look like you could.

Would you mind going up there and bringing me back anything of interest?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Progress==
Did ya find anything up there?

==Completion==
Oh my, look at this thing!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bad Blood]] before heading out.

Head in to [[Mogujia]] proper and start killing [[Dominance Knight]]s, [[Dominance Mage]]s, and [[Silvermoon Runeseeker]]s until five Korune Artifacts drop. Then, head up into the hills and kill the [[Korune Spellweaver]] and loot the Sha-Touched Claw from him.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Hilda Hornswaggle|Oh! Brann, jus' look at this claw! I have a creepin' suspicion that these mogu are meddlin' with some dark magic.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|I hear you, Hilda. Mogu mixin' up with sha? I don't like that one bit! We'd better bring this evidence back to the King. <Name>, thanks fer yer help today, but we'll take it from here!}}
