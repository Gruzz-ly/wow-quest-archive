Defeat 8 [[Fire Camp Ruqin]] [[Yaungol]]s.
*Ruqin Yaungols slain (8)

==Description==
Yaungols are attacking our [[Burlap Trail]]. This is most bad fortune for [[grummle]]s.

We use that trail to carry supplies to the [[Serpent's Spine]]. Without supplies, the defenders of the wall are in danger.

Grummles are packers and explorers, not fighters. Could you be a luckydo for us and stop the yaungol blockade?

*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A luckydon't travels a trail during a yaungol raid. A luckydo hires a big fighter-type to help.

==Completion==
It is good fortune that a <race> comes to help grummles. Good fortune to friend of grummles.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Grummle's Luck]] and [[Oil Stop]] before heading out.

Head southwest up the hill back to the [[Fire Camp Ruqin]]. [[Ruqin Elder|Elders]], [[Ruqin Infantry|infantry]], and [[Ruqin Outrider|outriders]] all count. Luckydo bags are all over the camp. Check inside tents and on the back of catapults. The oil derricks are the big windmills in the center of camp. Interact with the oil barrels in the back of the derrick to fill the vial.
