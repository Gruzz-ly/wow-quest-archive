==Objectives==

[[File:Bugging Out - supplies.jpg|thumb|Supplies.]]

Plant the Cleverly Disguised Bugs in the large tent, near the small tents, and in the supplies.
*Large Tent bugged {{co|58.3|84.0|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Small Tents bugged {{co|58.1|84.5|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Supplies bugged {{co|58.2|84.9|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[Grummle Disguise Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
I've managed to plant a few bugs around the camp, but there could always be more.

I disguised the bugs to look like statues. They blend in perfectly with the other artifacts lying around.

Your disguise should allow you to move freely around the camp. Just don't go near the dog and don't linger around Garrosh! Nero and Garrosh will see through your disguise.

If you get caught I can't help you. I can't compromise the mission!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 XP
* +400 reputation with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Progress==
How'd it go?

==Completion==
Well done! Everyone always underestimates the little guys and it is always a grave mistake!

==Notes==
Pick up [[He Won't Even Miss It]] before heading in to camp. And put on the [[Grummle Disguise Kit]]!

Walk in to camp from the east entrance, near the three [[Shaggy Longhorn]]s. Wait until Nero moves south toward the pile of supplies and the southern entrance before moving in. Interact with one longhorn to spook it. Garrosh will run down to the bonfire and yell:
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Get those mangy beasts under control!}}
Then interact with the other two! Keep moving west and duck inside the big tent between the shaghorns and Garrosh's (former) location to bug it. On the table Garrosh was standing at is the [[Weathered Journal]]. Further west is the small tent bug location. Wait there until Garrosh moves back to the table. Finally, head south to interact with the statue on the pile of supplies. Exit to the south and circle around back to Goottooth.

Turning in He Won't Even Miss It completes the "The Voice of the Gods" portion of [[Operation: Shieldwall (achievement)]]. On completion of both:
:{{text|say|Cousin Goottooth|So Garrosh is looking for something called the Divine Bell? Whatever that is, it can't be good. I'll get this information back to headquarters.}}
:{{text|say|Cousin Goottooth|Excellent work! I'll be in touch soon.}}
