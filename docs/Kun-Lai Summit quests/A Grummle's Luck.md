==Objectives==
Find 8 Stolen Luckydos.
*[[Stolen Luckydos]] (8)

==Description==
The [[yaungol]]s stole our luckydos! Mean riders with spears took them from our caravan of brothers coming down the [[Burlap Trail]].

This is very bad fortune. If the yaungol discover the secrets of luckydos all [[grummle]]s will be in big trouble.

Recover our luckydos from [[Fire Camp Ruqin]] south of here and we will pay many fortunes to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A luckydo is a thing of much good fortune. Yaungol know nothing of how to use luckydos... yet.

==Completion==
Hurray! Our Luckydos. Many thanks and fortune to friend of grummles!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Traffic Issues]] and [[Oil Stop]] before heading out.

Head southwest up the hill back to the [[Fire Camp Ruqin]]. [[Ruqin Elder|Elders]], [[Ruqin Infantry|infantry]], and [[Ruqin Outrider|outriders]] all count. Luckydo bags are all over the camp. Check inside tents and on the back of catapults. The oil derricks are the big windmills in the center of camp. Interact with the oil barrels in the back of the derrick to fill the vial.
