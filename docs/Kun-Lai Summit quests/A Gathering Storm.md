== Objectives ==
Confront 8 Sha-Touched Grunts.
*[[Sha-Touched Grunt]]s saved (6)

== Description ==
If [[General Nazgrim]] sent you, then I trust you are capable of discretion.

When I arrived here, I found [[Garrosh]]... experimenting... with some ancient power that he found in the mountains to the north.

He believes that this "[[sha]]" can strengthen our soldiers.

Unfortunately, so far the results have been quite the opposite.

Our troops are erupting into random violence. Go and interrogate them. If they threaten you, be prepared to defend yourself.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]
* +500 reputation with [[Horde]]

==Progress==
There is great power here... Why is it that so many fear it?

== Completion ==
You bested my defenders? Finally, one who can control his hatred and violence!

I need more men like you. 

==Notes==
Upon completion, the following dialogue happens:
:{{text|say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|Garrosh, you do truly believe the sha can be controlled? Have you seen what it's done to our men?}}
:{{text|say|[[Ishi]]|Hold your tongue, blood elf! You dare question our Warchief's judgment?}}
:{{text|say|[[Garrosh Hellscream]]|Calm yourself, Ishi. The Lord Regent may speak his mind.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|The sha can be a powerful tool. The mogu may have once harnessed its power into the Divine Bell, and look at the glorious empire they built in its wake.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|But their empire fell. Perhaps to the sha, perhaps to the pandaren, or perhaps... to their own pride.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Did the Scourge beat all the courage from your people, blood elf? We are the HORDE. Where there is power, we SEIZE it. My Horde has no place for the weak!}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|As you say... Warchief.}}
:''Lor'themar bows.''

==Progression==
