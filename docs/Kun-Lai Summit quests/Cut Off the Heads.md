==Objectives==
Slay [[mogu]] [[Commander (rank)|commanders]].
* [[Ti-Qiang the Bulwark]] slain
* [[Rui of the Sharpened Blade]] slain
* [[Huo the Lightning-Fist]] slain
* [[Pai the Lifedrainer]] slain

==Description==
Okay. We're stuck in the middle of three mogu armies, and [[Chen Stormstout|Uncle Chen]] is too hurt to move yet.

It's not hopeless though. We have the chance to take out the leaders of these armies. Maybe that will slow them down or distract them long enough for us to get back to the gate!

See if you can get out there and take down the biggest, baddest mogu you can find. Those will be the commanders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We've got to get rid of those commanders!

==Completion==
Good job. The mogu are not as strong without their leaders.

== Notes ==
* Ti-Qiang the Bulwark: [[Mogujia]]
* Rui of the Sharpened Blade: [[Westwind Rest]]
* Huo the Lightning-Fist: [[Eastwind Rest]]
* Pai the Lifedrainer: [[Chow Farmstead]], draining [[Mobi]]

Go kill Ti-Qiang the Bulwark as he's the closest, then focus on [[No Brew Left Behind]] so that you can get [[Yak of All Trades]], as you'll have to go through Pai the Lifedrainer for that quest anyway.

:{{text|say|Li Li Stormstout|Okay. Okay. I have the perfect plan.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li Stormstout|You just need to kill their commanders. And that'll stop the rest of the army. Somehow. I hope.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|That is definitely... a plan.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li Stormstout|Hey! We've had worse plans, and they've worked out just fine!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Heh.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li Stormstout|I'll stay here to heal and protect Uncle Chen. You get out there and take down those mogu!}}
