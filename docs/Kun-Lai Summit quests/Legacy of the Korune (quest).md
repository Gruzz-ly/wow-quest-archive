==Objectives==
Find the document Legacy of the Korune in the [[Valley of Emperors|Valley of the Emperors]], and collect the Sealed Korune Artifact and Korune Orders from Korune Mogu.
*[[Korune Orders]]
*[[Legacy of the Korune]]
*[[Sealed Korune Artifact]]

==Description==
I'm not prepared to throw away more of our people fighting against an enemy we don't know or understand. 

See if you can find any clues in the area as to who exactly these "Korune" mogu are. A contingency in case this operation doesn't go as planned.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Progress==
Have you found anything on the mogu? 

==Completion==
Good. There's quite a bit to pore through here...

I will have the [[Reliquary]] investigate these. Surely we can use them to discern more of the secrets of these Korune mogu. 

==Progression==
{{Horde Pandaren campaign}}
