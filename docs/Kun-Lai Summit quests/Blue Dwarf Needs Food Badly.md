==Notes==
This is a background quest while working on other quests from [[Westwind Rest]], the [[Chow Farmstead]], and [[Fire Camp Ordo]]. Any beast-classified mob in the general area, including [[Northwind Hawk]]s, [[Summit Bonestripper]]s, [[Highlands Calf|Highlands Calves]], and [[Highlands Mushan]]s drop Kun-Lai Meaty Bits, on average of 11 at a time. Just keep killing beasts when moving between quest areas.

This quest is a reference to Gauntlet: Dark Legacy when a hero "Needs Food Badly".
