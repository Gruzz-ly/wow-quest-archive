==Objectives==
[[File:Escaped Yak.jpg|thumb|[[Escaped Yak]].]]
Bring 6 Escaped Yaks to the Wash Entrance at [[Lao & Son's Yakwash]].
*[[Escaped Yak]] Washed (6)

==Description==
Look, my father is crazy. I love him, but he's crazy.

These [[yaungol]] managed to completely obliterate our [[ranch]] and scattered our yaks every which way.

If I know my father though, he's going to try to go head to head with the yaungol to get the yaks back.

Can you help us round up some of the yaks so my father doesn't do anything stupid?

Just ride them over to the Yak Wash so we can clean them up and sell them to the grummles.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The grummles always insist they have better luck with cleaned yaks.

As long as they pay more I'm not going to argue. We need the gold. Now more than ever.

==Completion==
Well done, stranger. Hopefully we'll be able to cash these in and recoup some of the damages the yaungol inflicted.

==Notes==
Before accepting this quest, make sure to hit quota on [[Fresh Needle Scent]].

On accept:
:{{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|Thank you for rescuing me, stranger! I will see you at the Yakwash.}}
:''Junior hops on [[Floof]] and takes off.''
Follow suit on [[Tuffi]]. It will quickly run back to the yakwash and run through it for quest credit. Find five more [[Escaped Yak]]s out in the field, which can be mounted as vehicles.

Nearing [[Muskpaw Ranch]], [[Yakity Yak]] auto-accepts. Kill the [[Burilgi Despoiler]]s terrorizing the yaks. Any of the despoilers will drop [[Muskpaw's Keepsake]], which starts [[The Late Mrs. Muskpaw]]. Turn that quest in when bringing a yak back to pick up [[The Fearmaster (quest)]], killing the epynonymous yaungol.

On sending a yak through the wash:
*{{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|Oh, the grummle are going to love that one.}}
*{{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|Oh, I've been looking all over for that one.  He's a handful.}}
*{{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|I hope that one doesn't have to go through twice.}}
*{{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|What did the yaungol do to that poor thing?}}
*{{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|Whew... that one was ripe.}}
*{{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|That's great, <name>. We'll take it from here.}}
*{{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|Hmm. I think that one is going to need some extra perfuming.}}
*{{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|Wow.  That's a filthy one.  Sure you don't want to go through the wash too?}}
