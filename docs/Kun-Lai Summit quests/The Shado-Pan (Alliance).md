==Objectives==
Speak to [[Shado-Master Chong]] at [[Shado-Pan Fallback]] in [[Firebough Nook]].

==Description==
Our new recruits have spoken in hushed tones about a group of Pandaren they call the "[[Shado-Pan]]". They are apparently very strong, and secretive.

That's where you come in. Rumor is they have a base of operations to the southeast, near Firebough Nook. You should travel there as an envoy of the Alliance. Give them any help they require.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Who are you? Can you fight? If so, we can use your help.

==Notes==
This is an ''optional'' breadcrumb to the Shado-Pan quest chain, starting at [[Firebough Nook]].
