==Objectives==
Check in with [[Sage Liao]] at the [[Zouchin Strand]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

==Description==
When the trolls came, they brought their mercenary... friends with them. I saw them go past us, to the fishing camp in the northwest. My cousin, a healer, lives there - can you check in with him and make sure he and his village are well?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*64000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ahh... My cousin is wise to be worried. I am not well...

==Notes==
Pick up [[It Takes A Village]], [[Handle With Care (Kun-Lai Summit)]], [[What's Yours Is Mine]], and [[Make A Fighter Out of Me]] before heading out.

Feel free to do the other four quests first or not, then head northwest to [[Zouchin Strand]]. Sage Liao is on his stomach
