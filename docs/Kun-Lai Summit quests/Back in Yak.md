==Objectives==
Bring the [[Clean Yak]]s to [[Lucky Eightcoins]] at the [[Grummle Bazaar]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]]. Return to [[Muskpaw Jr.]] if you lose your yaks.
*Bring Yak Herd to Lucky Eightcoins

==Description==
I wasn't lying about your reward.  Here, take these washed yaks to the [[grummle]] caravan master Eightcoins.

You can find him at the Grummle Bazaar west of here.  He'll credit us and give you a delivery fee.

He may be short, but he is our biggest customer.

Return to me if you lose the yaks.  More often than not they just come right back here anyway.  Once they've been cleaned that is.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 414 trinkets|Coin of Blessings
|Coin of Serendipity 	
|Coin of Luck 		
|Coin of Good Fortune 	
|Luckydo Coin}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
And what have we here?

==Completion==
Ah!  I can smell the luck from here.  The Muskpaws always have good yaks for sale.

==Notes==
Head northeast up the path, taking a left before reaching the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] to enter the [[Grummle Bazaar]].

To get the yaks back, just choose the gossip option:
: {{gossip|''I lost my yaks.''}}

: {{text|say|Muskpaw Jr.|Not to worry.  The little fellas seem to have found their way back here.  Here you go.}}

Nearing the yak pen:
:{{text|say|Lucky Eightcoins|Ooo, I can smell the luck of your yaks from here.  Come <class>, and I will give you much fortune in return.}}

On approaching Eightcoins:
:{{text|say|Lucky Eightcoins|Welcome, friend, to the Grummle Bazaar!}}

A handful of quests are available at the [[Grummle Bazaar]], starting with [[A Grummle's Luck]], [[Traffic Issues]], and [[Oil Stop]].

This completes "The Yak Wash" portion of [[Slum It in the Summit]].
