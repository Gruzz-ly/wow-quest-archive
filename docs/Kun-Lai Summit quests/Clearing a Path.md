==Objectives==
Kill 10 Korune Mogu.
*[[Korune]] [[Mogu]] slain (10)

==Description==
First thing's first. If we're going to take the leader captive, we'll need to thin the numbers of his agents.

Be careful. These mogu are particularly dangerous - they appear to be manipulating the sha in ways we haven't seen before.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Progress==
We can't take the leader with all of his agents still out here!

==Completion==
Good. We should be ready to make our move.

==Progression==
{{Horde Pandaren campaign}}
