'''Practice Makes Perfect: Master Cheng''' is the first of several daily "sparring" quests unlocked by {{class|monk}} players after completing the associated '''Begin/Continue Your Training''' class quest. Upon completion of this and other '''Practice Makes Perfect''' quests, {{NPC||Master Hight}} rewards the player with the [[Enlightenment (spell)]] buff, increasing XP gained by 50% for one hour. This buff has proven to be a great boon to players creating monk characters since the release of [[Mists of Pandaria]], immensely expediting the leveling process.

==Objectives==
Speak with Master Cheng in the [[Peak of Serenity]] and spar with him.
