==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Master Kistane|Once you have learned to control your own actions, you must learn to control your opponent to gain the upper hand.  An opponent may expose a weakness when trying to heal themselves, allowing you an opportunity to interrupt them.  This can mean the difference between a victory and defeat.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Kistane|Bow to me and we shall begin.}}

/bow to her and defeat her.

During the fight, Master Kistane will attempt to heal:
:{{Text|bossemote|Master Kistane is running away to heal at a nearby Jade Serpent Statue. Slow her and defeat her before she can heal herself!}}

;If she is healed full, she will return to her previous position
