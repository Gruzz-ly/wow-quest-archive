==Objectives==
Kill 12 Kun-Lai Scavengers.
*[[Kun-Lai Corpsepicker]] slain (12)

==Description==
Hmm... If [[Shado-Master Chong]] trusted you, perhaps you can help us.

The [[yaungol]] are our enemies.

Still, we must prove we are better than they. We will show them honor in death.

As after most battles, the [[carrion bird]]s have begun gathering. Thin their numbers, so the bodies of our foes will not be desecrated. They've gathered at the battlefield to the west.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Killing those birds may not soothe my anger, but at least it proves we are better than our enemies. They would not do such a thing.

==Completion==
Good. After what they have done, I would not show the yaungol kindness in life. But neither will I allow their bodies to be eaten by the birds.

''On completion, the area is rocked by an impact and large spears begin flying toward the camp.''

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Line Unbroken]] before heading out.

Head down the hill past the battlefield refreshment device and then back up the halfway-cut stairs to find Zhiyao surrounded by a ring of yaungol corpses. Start killing vultures. Then head all the way down toward the gate. On the right side of the path ~100 yards from the gate is Liu, not far from the bonfire. Shiya is right next to the gate on its left side.

The phase changes on completion of both quests - the battlefield has been taken by the Osul, who have planted several catapults! Lin offers the next quest.
