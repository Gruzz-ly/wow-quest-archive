==Objectives==
[[File:Curious Text.jpg|thumb|Curious Text.]]
[[File:Mogu Fleshrender.jpg|thumb|[[Imperial Antiquator]].]]
Tear a page from the [[Curious Text|open book]] to give to [[Lorewalker Cho]].
*[[Torn Page]]
*[[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] (provided)

==Description==
A ritual took place here, and from the looks of it wasn't successful.

Among the abandoned items a book lies open. The text on the pages is foreign to you.

Carrying the whole book may be difficult, but a single page might be enough. If you can get the page to Lorewalker Cho he may be able to tell you what it says.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 XP

==Progress==
What have you found, <name>?

==Completion==
This text is curious indeed, <name>...

It appears to have been written in the Meng dynasty, but some of the symbols are wrong. it don't think the [[Mogu]] wrote this, although it is oddly close.

It will take me some time to translate. Keep moving and see if you can find anything else.

==Notes==
Killing [[Tormented Spirit (Kun-Lai Summit)|Tormented Spirits]] for [[An End to Everything]], note an [[Imperial Antiquator]] standing at the central table. Kill him and interact with the [[Curious Text]], starting this quest. Interact with the book again to tear a page out of it, then use [[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] to summon the [[Image of Lorewalker Cho]] to turn in.

==Progression==
