Attend the funeral and light the Incense of Life.
*Light the [[Incense of Life]] {{co|67.0|33.3|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
As I said, I will gather the town - we will be at the funeral.

As the one who has done so much to honor our friends, we feel it is only right that you will be the one to light the Incense of Life and usher their spirits to the [[Shadowlands|life beyond]].

==Progress==
You must light the incense to honor the dead.

==Completion==
Good. Let us begin the funeral.

==Notes==
Head south out of town and take the first left before the hot air balloon platform to travel just north of east. To the right of the path above the valley leading down is the graveyard. Light the incense of life, then speak with Sage Liao, right next to it.
