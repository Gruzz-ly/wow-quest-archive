Rescue 5 Imprisoned Grummles by cutting them down or releasing them from cages.
*Rescue [[Imprisoned Grummle]] (5)

==Description==
They took my grummles! Hozen don't eat grummles, but yeti do. And the Knucklethumps have a yeti.

==Progress==
Other grummles say I not have good luck. The{{sic}} call me "Luckydon't".

But now I have friend <race> who is a big luckydo! We'll show them.

==Completion==
Today is a day of many good and bad fortunes. Bad fortune that hozen stole my grummles. Good fortune that my <race> saves my grummles. Bad fortune that so many hozen must die to learn lesson. Good fortune that <race>s are luckydos and know how to fight.

Grummles are not fighters. We carry, we explore, and we are content.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Yakshoe|If you have a ragned weapon, use it to shoot down ropes that hold grummles up.}}
Pick up [[Thumping Knucklethump]] and [[Hozen Love Their Keys]] before heading out.

Head north to [[Knucklethump Hole]], start killing hozen and freeing grummles. Grummles hanging from ropes can be freed by simply doing damage to the ropes.

*{{Text|say|Imprisoned Grummle‎|Ah! Good fortune to one who times a rescue well.}}
*{{Text|say|Imprisoned Grummle‎|Cage stink of bad fortune. Hozen stink of more bad fortune.}}
*{{Text|say|Imprisoned Grummle‎|I need a better luckydo to make sure this not happen again.}}
*{{Text|say|Imprisoned Grummle‎|Many thanks!}}
*{{Text|say|Imprisoned Grummle‎|Maybe I call myself <name>sfoot from now on.}}

In the very back of the cave is [[Cho Cho the Wicked]]. Make sure The Snackrifice and Thumping Knucklethump are both complete at this point. Kill him to loot the key, then use it on the ball and chain behind [[Old Poot Poot]]. Poot will snag the player then run out of the cave, killing knuckethump victims along the way. Poot will drop adventurers off back at the Burlap Waystation, so turn in all three quests then.
