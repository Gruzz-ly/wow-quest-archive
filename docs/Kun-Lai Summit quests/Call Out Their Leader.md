==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Bataari Fire-Warrior.jpg|Bataari Fire-Warrior|Slay 10 of the Bataari Tribe Members to anger him into appearing. Then kill him!}}
Slay 10 [[yaungol]] in the [[Kun-Lai Pass]] until the Yaungol [[War Leader]] appears. Then kill him.
*Bataari Tribe Members slain (10)
*[[Bataari Fire-Warrior]] slain

==Description==
Clearly, you are a hero come to aid us.

Slay the yaungol in the Kun-Lai Pass to the northwest until their war leader is angered enough to apear. Dispatch him.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
*161000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If the war leader of the yaungol is slain, surely [[Binan Village|our village]] will be saved and the refugees will be able to return to their farms.

==Completion==
We are delivered! I was right about you, <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hit Medicine]] before heading out. Exiting the village and entering the battlefield, [[Commander Hsieh]] offers [[All of the Arrows]]. Pick it up too.

Kill any humanoid yaungol—the yaks don't count. Look specifically for units called "Injured Binan Warrior" to heal. Arrows litter the ground. Once enough regular yaungol are dead, the Fire-Warrior will start spawning on a giant battleyak on the main path. Find him and take him out.
