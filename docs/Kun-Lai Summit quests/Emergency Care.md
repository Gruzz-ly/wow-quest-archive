==Objectives==
Heal [[Sage Liao]] to get him back on his feet.
*Heal Sage Liao with Spells or the Draught in his Hut {{co|61.0|21.5|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
I... am alive... but barely. They killed the rest. My friends... and family...

I must return to [[Zouchin Village|the village]]... But, I do not have long, and cannot move on my own... are you a healer? I... have a healing potion in my hut... search my belongings. You can use your magic, if you have it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|10}}
*64000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The... village... dead...

==Completion==
Thank you. I suppose... I'll need to ask you to do a bit more before I can return to the village. I cannot leave the bodies of my friends and family here.

==Notes==
Enter the hut right behind him, turn left, and loot the chest on the table. It has a [[Pandaren Healing Draught]]. Head back out and use it on him.

Alternatively, any [[bandage]] created with [[First Aid]] will serve.
