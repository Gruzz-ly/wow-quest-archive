[[File:Zandalari Behemoth.jpg|thumb|[[Amani Behemoth]].]]
[[File:Zandalari Bloodrider.jpg|thumb|[[Gurubashi Bloodrider]].]]
Defeat 10 Zandalari Berserkers, 5 Zandalari Behemoths, and 3 Zandalari Bloodriders.
*[[Amani Berserker (Kun-Lai Summit)|Amani Berserker]] slain (10)
*[[Amani Behemoth]] slain (5) {{co|61.2|29.1|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[Gurubashi Bloodrider]] slain (3) {{co|64.4|29.0|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
The Zandalari have begun their attack!  You must help defend the village!

If we can't push them back, we will never find the [[Thunder King|Thunder King's]] remains!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*161000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The village must be saved!

==Completion==
The Zandalari have started to retreat, <name>.  This victory will mean a great deal to the villagers.

In the chaos I was able to capture one of the fighters. Perhaps we can get some information from him.

==Notes==
On accept, the phase changes:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Hurry, elders! You must hide!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Hou|We're doomed!}}
The Zandalari are attacking in force! [[Amani Berserker (Kun-Lai Summit)|Amani Berserkers]] have passed the defense line and are being fielded by [[Zouchin Defender]]s and [[Zouchin Archer]]s inside town. [[Amani Behemoth]]s are charging the barricades on the northwest path down to the beach. [[Elder Shu]] is standing guard and has prepared some [[Blasting Barrel]]s:
:{{text|say|Elder Shu|Hurry, <name>! Use the barrels to defeat those monstrositites!}}
Interact with a barrel to instantly kill the behemoths being fielded by the defenders at the barricade. Another handful will come up the path, so repeat the process. After that, cut through town to the northeast path, where Shomi is leading the guards.
:{{text|yell|Shomi|Riders approach!}}
:{{text|say|Shomi|Wait for it...}}
:{{text|yell|Shomi|Now!}}
Help the guards take out the [[Gurubashi Bloodrider]]s.

Finally, return to Cho in the inn.

==Progression==
