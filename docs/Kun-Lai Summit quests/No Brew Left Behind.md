==Objectives==
Locate the abandoned brew barrels in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

==Description==
My head is... hurting. There can be only one solution.

We flew over an abandoned brew [[caravan]]. You must go find it, and save that brew! That should help bring me back to full strength.

Plus, it would do wonders for the morale of those fighting in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]], if we can recover it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<These must be the brew barrels [[Chen Stormstout|Chen]] spotted when flying over.

They are too heavy to carry on your own.>

==Progression==
{{Mogu at the Gates}}
