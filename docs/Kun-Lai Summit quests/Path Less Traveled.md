==Objectives==
Speak to [[Uncle Cloverleaf]] in [[One Keg]].

==Description==
The toughest roads often have the most to teach us, <class>. I will no doubt learn a great deal from following the path of [[Shaohao]].

Many years ago Shaohao traveled to the [[Mount Neverest|highest peak]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]] to seek the guidance of the [[Jade Serpent]]. I too will travel to [[Seeker's Point]] in search of wisdom.

Perhaps you would be interested in a journey such as this? If so speak with Uncle Cloverleaf. He will help you prepare.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|30}}
*81000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Travel to Seeker's Point will require much good fortune, <class>. Hopefully you have many lucky trinkets!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I hope our paths cross again, <name>! Until then, may your journey be safe and meaningful.}}
:''Cho and [[Lucky Bluestring]] start walking up the path.''
Several quests open up on completion: [[Instant Courage]], [[They Stole My Luck!]], and [[Resupplying One Keg]].

==Progression==
{{Raising the Thunder King}}
