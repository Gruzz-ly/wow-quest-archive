==Objectives==
Collect 8 Stolen Supplies.
*[[Stolen Supplies (Repossession)]] (8)

==Description==
Of course, the first priority is finding my son. But, if we save ourselves only to starve, then what have we accomplished, in the end?

Please, I need you to recover some of the supplies that the [[Jinyu]] took from our [[caravan]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20|}} (or {{cost|10|85|}} if completed at level 90)
*129,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the supplies?

==Completion==
Thank you... we will eat now, at least.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[My Son...]], [[Enraged Vengeance]], [[The Waterspeaker's Staff]], and [[Free the Dissenters]] before heading out.

Cross to the north over the mere to the far side of the village and start hunting for goods and jinyu. Orachi is on the northern shore, and Wu-Peng is on the north side of the north shore hiding behind a big shell. Feel free to instantly turn in My Son... and pick up [[Father and Child Reunion]] from him, as it is not an escort.

==Progress==
{{Inkgill Mere}}
