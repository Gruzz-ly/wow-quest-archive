Light 8 Lucky Burlap Incense sticks along the road to [[One Keg]].
*[[Lucky Burlap Incense]] Lit (8)

==Description==
A luckydo remembers to bring incense on a journey in to the mountains. The smellier the luck the better.

Can you journey up the road to One Keg and light the incense you find along the way?

This will give good fortune to grummles that must travel the road.

[[Brother Lintpocket]] can give you many rewards. Speak to him when you arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]
*[[Silversage Incense]]

==Progress==
The pungent smell of lucky burning burlap in the morning is a big Luckydo.

==Completion==
Welcome to One Keg! Gateway to [[Burlap Trail]] and [[Mount Neverest]].

==Notes==
Follow the path to the southeast past [[Fire Camp Ruqin]] up to [[One Keg]]. Incense sticks are on both sides of the road, starting merely yards away from the bazaar. Both he and [[Lorewalker Cho]] offer quests: [[The Burlap Trail: To Burlap Waystation]], and [[Path Less Traveled]], respectively.
