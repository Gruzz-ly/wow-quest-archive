==Objectives==
Return to [[Farmhand Ko]] at [[Eastwind Rest]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

==Description==
Well, far as I figure, we've got quite a lot of rebuildin' to do.

I'm not one for joining any big causes, but my farmhands aren't gonna have much to do 'round here, to be honest. And, since you helped them out, they want to join your "Horde". So, who am I to stop 'em?

Bring 'em with you, back to Farmhand Ko. I'll miss 'em, but they're better off with you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
*161000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You did good, bringing these guys back. We'll have 'em farming you up some food in no time!

==Notes==
Back to Eastwind, farmhands in tow.

Reaching Ko:
