== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Ban Bearheart}} outside the [[Shado-Pan Monastery]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].
*Tell Ban You are Ready to Leave {{co|31.3|61.5|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Ride Ban's Balloon to the Shado-Pan Monastery {{co|34.0|58.6|Kun-Lai Summit}}

== Description ==
This has simply gone too far. I cannot ignore our abandonment any longer.

After all that's happened here, and all you've been through in [[Firebough Nook|Firebough]], we must travel to the monastery.

Whatever they are doing in there can wait! We can take my balloon up the mountain to the Monastery. It's anchored back by the camp, to the northeast.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|6}}
* 16200 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

== Progress ==
Here we are, then.

== Completion ==
Here we are, and now you know why we cannot let our brothers sit idly by.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[My Husband...]], which is a breadcrumb to the [[Townlong Steppes]], before speaking with Ban again. However, focus on this chain for the time being.

Speak with him again:
:Something feels... different up here.  I don't know what, but I expect we shall find out soon enough.

:{{gossip|I'm ready to leave. Let's go!}}
:''Ban mounts up and runs back to Winter's Blossom, stopping by his balloon.''

Follow him there and speak with him again:
:{{gossip|Alright, let's go up to the monastery.}}

A cutscene:
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|As a stranger to these lands, you may not be familiar with the [[Shado-Pan]].}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Our charge is an ancient one, dating back to the time of {{NPC||Shaohao}}, our founder and the last emperor of [[Pandaria]].}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Dark energies embrace this land. {{NPC||Sha of Anger||Anger}}, {{NPC||Sha of Hatred||Hatred}}, {{NPC||Sha of Fear||Fear}}, {{NPC||Sha of Doubt||Doubt}}...}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|These negative emotions can manifest in physical form. We call this dark energy "Sha."}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|It is our sacred duty to monitor and imprison the Sha. To defeat it wherever it darkens the hearts of our people.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|In all my years, I have never seen the Sha so active as when your soldiers landed on our shores.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Pandaria does not have a standing army. We, the [[Shado-Pan]], are its first - and only - line of defense.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|{{NPC||Taran Zhu}} leads the Shado-Pan, as his father did before him. But he has elected to close our [[Shado-Pan Monastery|Monastery]] gates - why?}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|We must find out. Without the Shado-Pan, Pandaria will surely be engulfed in darkness...}}

The balloon drops Ban and the player off outside the monastery near a small grummle camp. Speak with him again to continue.
