== Objectives ==
[[File:Tomb of Elements - Thunder King.jpg|thumb|Guess who?]]
Read the Tablet of Thunder in the Tomb of Conquerors.
*Read the Tablet of Thunder {{co|34.1|61.5|Tomb of Conquerors}} / {{co|48.8|47.3|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] (provided)

== Description ==
The [[Thunder King]] was a vicious Emperor and with the [[Zandalar tribe|Zandalari]] at his side he was unstoppable. His return would surely return this land to turmoil and misery.

You must locate his remains and take them somewhere safe. The Tablet of Thunder should help you figure out how to access his tomb.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
* 162000 XP

== Progress ==
Have you read the tablet?

== Completion ==
They will need to move the remains to a secure location. We must go after them!

== Notes ==
Interact with the tablet again. A cutscene occurs. Cho starts speaking as the camera pulls back and returns to the center room, then banks left. The doors open, showing a corpse on an altar. It backs out to the center room again and pans right, focusing on the stairs as a large number of [[Zandalari troll]]s come running down. {{NPC||Prophet Khar'zul}}, the leader, makes a statement and starts laughing.
