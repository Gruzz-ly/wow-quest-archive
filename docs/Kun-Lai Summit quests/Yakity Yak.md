==Objectives==
Kill 9 Burilgi Despoilers at the [[Muskpaw Ranch]].
*[[Burilgi Despoiler]] slain (9)

==Description==
For now, the [[yaungol]] invaders seem content to steal yaks. Surveying the area, however, you notice they could easily move on the [[Lao & Son's Yakwash|Yak Wash]] at any moment.

Thinning their numbers may help show the yaungol that this area is protected.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Them yak stealing, ranch smashing, bad breath yaungols gotta learn a thing or two about attacking decent folk.

==Completion==
Well then, I am mighty grateful for you culling some of those yaungols for us.

Hopefully your little display of authority will be enough to discourage them from coming over here.

==Notes==
While recovering yaks at the [[Muskpaw Ranch]] for [[At the Yak Wash]], this quest will automatically accept. Go nuts. A despoiler will drop [[Muskpaw's Keepsake]], which starts [[The Late Mrs. Muskpaw]], a fedex back to the yakwash. Turn that quest in when bringing a yak back to pick up [[The Fearmaster (quest)]], killing the epynonymous yaungol.

==Progression==
{{Lao & Son's Yakwash}}
