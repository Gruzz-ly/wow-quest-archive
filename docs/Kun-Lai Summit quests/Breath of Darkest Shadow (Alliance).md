*[[Ishi]] slain {{co|55.8|32.0|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Destroy the [[Divine Bell]] {{co|56.0|31.9|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
[[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] is right over there, and he's going to ring that bell at any moment.

We don't have time to wait for [[Varian Wrynn|my father's]] army. This is our only chance to stop him!

I'll attempt to appeal to his senses before resorting to using the [[Harmonic Mallet]].

Charge in whenever you're ready, <name>. I'll be right behind you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|34|20}}
*353000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Anduin looks like a crumpled doll. He lays as still as a stone, and the only movement comes from the frigid air, ruffling his fair, golden hair.>

<You sit quietly for a while, until the cold settles into your bones. The bell is destroyed, but the silence is deafening.>

<Out of the corner of your eye, you see the slightest flicker from the boy's hand. You lean in close. He breathes - but just barely! Anduin is alive!>

==Notes==
Head up to the platform and a script event begins:
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|We are the HORDE. We are slaves to nothing and no one!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|With the Divine Bell, I will burn away any remnants of weakness within us. Fear... despair... hatred... doubt. The lesser races are buried beneath their weight. But WE will control their power.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Together, we will destroy the Alliance and claim what is rightfully ours. Let our song of victory begin.}}
:''Garrosh strikes the bell and the [[Kor'kron Reaver (Kun-Lai Summit)|Kor'kron Reavers]] closest to the bell are transformed into sha. They must all be killed before the script event continues.

While they're still alive, Garrosh will say any of the following at random:
*{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Our victory is all but assured. With the power of the bell on our side, we will be unstoppable.}}
*{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|If our enemies should choose to push us, we will drive them into the ground!}}
*{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|This is but a test of our strength. We will pass this trial, just as we have passed others!}}
*{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Yes! Feel the power within you. Fight your fears. Conquer your hatred!}}

Once the last reaver is slain, Anduin will run up:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Stop, Garrosh! You do not know what that bell is capable of!!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Ahahahaha... so in the end, it is not Varian, but his whelp who comes to face me. You run bravely to your death, young one!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I will not let you do this. I swear to it!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Stop me then, human.}}
:''Garrosh strikes the bell again, this time turning Ishi!''
:{{text|say|Ishi|Auugh... Auuuuuugggghhhhh! This pain! I cannot control it!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Fight the sha - master it! Use it!}}

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Ishi|Do you speak the truth, Garrosh? Can the Horde truly survive another war?}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellsceram|Doubt is for the weak! Do not question your strength, Ishi. We will survive because we must! The Horde will prevail!}}

At 75%:
:{{text|say|Ishi|We have lost so much, Warchief. Our families, dead. Our friends, lost. Our homeland, gone. How much more must our people suffer?}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Our suffering is at an end. When this war is won, our people will see prosperity at last.}}

At 50%:
:{{text|say|Ishi|Why should we be slaves to honor, when we could slaughter the children of our enemies while they sleep? My blade thirsts for Alliance blood!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Control your hatred, Ishi. There is killing, and then there is murder. Direct your rage to our enemies.}}

At 25%:
:{{text|say|Ishi|At night, I see the faces of all those I have slain. Where do our spirits go after our bodies lay cold? I fear... death.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Use your fear, Ishi! Turn it on your foes. When death arrives, will you stand and face it or kneel in defeat?}}

Finish Ishi off:
:{{text|say|Ishi|Warchief! I... I have failed you.}}
:''Garrosh walks away from the bell and stands in the center of the platform.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Yes, Ishi. You have.}}
:''Garrosh turns to face Anduin.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Your interference has cost me a great warrior, young prince. You'll pay with your life.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|That is where you are wrong, Garrosh.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The mogu made the Divine Bell to create chaos, but the pandaren created a special mallet to turn the echoes of that chaos into perfect harmony. That mallet was hidden for thousands of years, until now.}}
:''Anduin leaps upward and performs an overhand strike on the Divine Bell, stunning Garrosh and causing the bell to crack violently.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Die, whelp!!}}
:''Garrosh pulls himself together, closes the gap, and strikes at Anduin, but hits the Divine Bell, shattering it. The bell crumples in a heap onto Anduin, who has been crushed within an inch of his life!''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Your Alliance must be at its end if you're sending your children against me.}}
:''Garrosh turns to face the adventurer.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|I will let you live so that you can tell your King of the price for his continued defiance!}}
:''Garrosh mounts his wyvern and takes off, laughing.''
Speak to Anduin.
