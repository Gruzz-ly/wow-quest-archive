Enrage Chomp Chomp and then defeat the Ook of Dook.
*Enrage [[Chomp Chomp]] {{co|46.0|63.3|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[The Ook of Dook]] slain {{co|46.0|63.3|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
The time has come to face the Ook of Dook.  We beat him, and the hozen won't have someone telling them to ravage.

Here is the plan: [[Brother Yakshoe|Yakshoe]] will lead [[Tassle]] in to arena and scare away Chomp Chomp.

Then, you sneak in and fight the Ook of Dook while his hozen are distracted by the yeti rampaging through their home.

We'll meet you back at [[Kota Basecamp]] with a big reward.  Good fortune to you, friend of grummles.

:''Rabbitsfoot takes off as Yakshoe leads Tassle in to the cage. He stops her not far from Chomp Chomp and lights the incense.
:{{Text|yell|Brother Yakshoe|Good fortune to you!}}
:{{text|emote|Tassle sniffs the air.}}
:''Realzing where she is, Tassle takes off, circling the arena once before exiting. Chomp Chomp follows her out.''
Shortly thereafter, the giant statue overlooking the arena starts eyebeaming the ground:
*{{abilities|Burning Stare of the Angry Monkey!|notes=Instant|Hits for 37603 Fire.}}
Then, [[The Ook of Dook]] jumps in.
:{{text|yell|The Ook of Dook|No! Wikkets stole my Chomp Chomp!}}
The Ook of Dook is an elite hozen with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Angry Monkey!|Increases movement speed by 0% for 3 sec.|note=1 sec cast. Self buff.}}

Kite him through the eye beam - careful to not run through it yourself, and avoid the bananas he throws.
