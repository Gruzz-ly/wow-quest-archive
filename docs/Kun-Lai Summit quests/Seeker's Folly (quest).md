==Description==
I'm sure your [[pandaren]] friend has some ideas about what the [[mogu]] are after.

He headed up the mountain a few days ago without a guide, and asked that only you be sent up after him. He was very specific:

"The <class> must endure the trek alone, with only <his/her> thoughts. <He/She> will honor each shrine before meeting me at the top."

The path is just northwest of the camp, marked by flags. Please be careful! Seeker's Folly is a dangerous trek even on a lucky day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There are two shrines on the path below us, and one more just behind us.

==Completion==
Ah, you made it, and you honored the shrines.

I knew you could handle it.

==Notes==
Head to the northwest, then turn west up the hill following the red flags. Snow Boulders are falling down the mountain marked by arcane runes on the ground a few seconds before they hit for 37,000 Frost damage and slowing movement speed by 50% for 5 sec.

The first shrine is the Shrine of the Seeker's Body.
:{{text|bossemote|Each bodily injury is a lesson learned. Each defeat, an opportunity to grow.}}

Past the first shrine on the way to the second are blue tornadoes moving up and down the path inflicting Freezing Winds, which ticks for 10,000 Frost and slows movement speed by 50% for 2 sec. Interact with the Shrine of the Seeker's Breath, dodging the tornadoes.
:{{text|bossemote|Finding peace within will allow you to see obstacles with reason.}}

Further up the mountain, but before reaching [[Seeker's Point]], is the Shrine of the Seeker's Heart. Interact with it.
:{{text|bossemote|Wisdom can only penetrate a heart that is truly open to it.}}

Finally, keep heading uphill to reach Seeker's Point, where Lorewalker Cho and [[Mishi]] can be found. Turn in to Cho.

==Progression==
