== Objectives ==
[[File:Kafa'kota Berries.jpg|thumb|Kafa'kota Berries]]
Collect 100 Kafa'kota Berries from Kota Peak. They can be found in bushes growing on the mountainside or piled up in the yeti caves.
*[[Kafa'kota Berry]] x100

== Description ==
[[Kota Peak]] is famous for its [[kafa]] bushes - no other can survive at this elevation.

[[Grummle]]s make very good living selling Kafa'kota Blend, but it's dangerous now thanks to [[Cousin Gootfur|my cousin]] here. He's got the wildlife up there hooked on kafa with his scheming.

Kafa'kota is more scarce than ever with goots gobblin' it up and yetis hoarding it in their caves.

I pay you good for any berries you bring down from Kota.

Here, take a sample. Eat it. See for yourself the power of kafa.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
* 162000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
<This should be more than enough berries to satisfy Uncle Keenbean.>

== Completion ==
<As you bundle the berries together, you hear a mighty roar echo across the mountain, followed by the squeal of a terrified grummle.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Trouble Brewing (Kun-Lai Summit)]], [[Shut it Down]], and [[Gourmet Kafa]] before heading out.

Keenbean will provide one [[Kafa'kota Berry]] on accept, so feel free to sample it.

The path up the mountain starts inside the basecamp to the southwest, marked by waving red flags. Start killing [[Kafa-Crazed Mountain Goat]]s, marking [[Kafa'goot "Deposit"|Kafa'goot "Deposits"]], snagging [[Kafa'kota Bush]]es (each containing 6-11 berries), and moving further uphill. Keep an eye out for the cave and start killing yeti. Bunches of berries are all over the cave, so don't panic if not many are found outside. Kota Blend will complete automatically as soon as at least 100 berries are in adventurers' bags at one time. Don't turn in the followup, [[A Fair Trade]], until the other three quests are done, as A Fair Trade will drop players off at the base of the mountain on complete.
