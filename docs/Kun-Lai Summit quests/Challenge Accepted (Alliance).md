==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ur-Bataar.jpg||Ur-Bataar, Champion of the Yaungol}}
Set the [[Yaungol Banner]] ablaze to summon Ur-Bataar, and then defeat him in combat.
*[[Ur-Bataar]] slain {{co|58.2|84.1|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
The [[yaungol]] have always been a difficult, proud people, but never this violent or aggressive.

I do not know what has prompted this change in their behavior, but we don't have time to find out, now. We fear for our lives and livelihoods as long as Ur-Bataar, leader of the Bataari yaungol, lives.

Go, set the banner in his camp ablaze to challenge him, and then defeat him in battle.  Only then will we be secure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
*161000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
As long as Ur-Bataar lives, we cannot have peace.

==Completion==
You did it! At the very least, we have justice, and safety, though in the process we have lost so much.

Regardless, it has been decided. We will join the Alliance, and with your help, rebuild this village.

==Notes==
Head due east from the quest giver to reach [[Fire Camp Bataar]]. The banner is on the north side of the encampment. Kill all of the [[Bataari Banner Guard]]s before interacting with the banner, as they will ''all'' aggro if they're not dead. Set it ablaze and [[Ur-Bataar]] will jump in from the southwest:
:{{Text|say|Bataari Banner Guard|Intruder!}}
:{{text|yell|Ur-Bataar|Fool! I will crush you!}}
He is a yaungol who acts as a warrior with [[Bloodthirst]], [[Cleave]], and [[Enrage]].

Kill him:
:{{text|say|Ur-bataar|No! Kun-Lai was ours....}}
Head back to Westwind, which is still ablaze.

On complete, a cutscene:
:''The pandaren run in and start putting out fires. Shortly after, Admiral Taylor runs in with the rest of the Alliance forces, plants a banner, and sets up camp.''
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Another job well done, friend. You should see if Mishka and Sully need you?}}
Lots of quests offered: [[Round 'Em Up (Alliance)]] from Taylor, [[Blue Dwarf Needs Food Badly]] from Sully, [[Mogu?! Oh No-gu! (Alliance)]] from Tsulan, [[Deanimate the Reanimated (Alliance)]] from Mishka, [[Trouble on the Farmstead (Alliance)]] from Farmer Bo.
