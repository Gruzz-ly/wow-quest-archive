== Objectives ==
Carry the Torch of Strength to the gates of the Temple of the White Tiger without it extinguishing.
*The Strong Brazier Lit

== Description ==
Xuen has this challenge he says helps "refine strength." I am starting to think the word "strength" means something different to him than the rest of us.

Here, take this torch to the top of the gates of the temple. If you can get it there without the torch being extinguished, you pass the challenge.

Whatever you do, do not try carrying the torch on a mount. It will blow out if you do. Trust me on that one.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}

== Completion ==
Wow! You made it. Usually I get stopped by one of those gusts of wind.

== Gains ==
* 236000 XP
* +250 reputation with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

== Notes ==
As the quest mentions, do this on foot. After accepting the quest from Lin's position, exit either side of the building she's in and start heading up toward the main temple.

==Progression==
{{Tiger Temple trials}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
