==Objectives==
Find [[Muskpaw Jr.]] in [[Pranksters' Hollow]].

==Description==
What the heck are you supposed to be? A <class>? Never heard of one of them. You here to help or to steal my yaks?

Look, if yer' insistin' on helpin' out, go find my boy. He got himself grabbed by a bunch of [[sprite]]s and probably doesn't even know we lost the [[ranch]].

They dragged him off to Pranksters' Hollow south east of here. Go rescue him an' I'll see about giving you a reward of some sort.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for the save, stranger!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fresh Needle Scent]] before heading out.

The sprites are found in groups of three outside the cave to the southwest as well as inside, and drop 3 needles each on average. Make sure to hit quota for Fresh Needle Scent before turning in to [[Muskpaw Jr.]] at the bottom of [[Pranksters' Hollow]]. A sprite is on Junior's head, so kill it before talking to him.
