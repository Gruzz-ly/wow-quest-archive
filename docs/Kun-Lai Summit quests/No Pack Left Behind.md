== Objectives ==
Recover 8 Grummlepacks from [[Camp Broketooth]] or [[Deeper|The Deeper]].
*[[Grummlepack (quest item)]] x8

== Description ==
The Broketooth hozen south of here killed all of my grummles. What is worse, their packages are undelivered.

Fortune frowns on a grummlepack undelivered.

Please, give my grummles peace on the great trail of beyond and bring their grummlepacks to me.

I will see they are delivered.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|10|60}}
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Grummlepack}}
* 162000 XP

== Progress ==
Grummles are a simple people. We are made to explore and deliver.

== Completion ==
You are good fortune for grummles.

When we are back at a proper camp I must buy you the smelliest, luckiest incense I can find.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Monkey Idol]] and [[Breaking Brooketooth]] before heading out.

Due south is the mouth of the [[Deeper]] cave system. Start killing hozen and looking for grummle corpses. Just outside of the Deeper is {{NPC||Hateful Ko Ko}} and his altar. Kill him and loot the [[Corpse of Ko Ko]], then place it on his altar. Enter the Deeper to find {{NPC||Dak Dak}}. Loot the [[Corpse of Dak Dak]] and place it on his altar in the center of the big room on the lower level. Exit the cave system and head east to reach [[Camp Broketooth]]. {{NPC||Tak Tak}} is out on the surface at the back of the camp to the southeast. Put the [[Corpse of Tak Tak]] on his altar, then wrap up the other quests before heading back.
