[[File:Shado-Pan Sentinel.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Shado-Pan Sentinel}}]]
Speak to the {{NPC||Shado-Pan Sentinel}} to gain entrance to the [[Shado-Pan Monastery]].
*Gain access to the Monastery {{co|36.7|47.7|Kun-Lai Summit}}

I simply refuse to believe the guards will not grant us entry to the monastery should we impress upon them the seriousness of the situation.

Friend, go east, to the sentinel in front of the Monastery, and demand admittance.  I will come with you.

== Progress ==
Unbelievable!

== Completion ==
No... this is worse than I could have possibly imagined. The monastery itself has been compromised...

== Notes ==
Ban will join the party on accept, buffing the player with 10 stacks of Earth Shield. Head east past all of the waiting [[grummle]]s to reach the eastern entrance of the Shado-Pan Monastery. At the door is a {{NPC||Shado-Pan Sentinel}}.

: By the order of the lord {{NPC||Taran Zhu}}, none shall pass.
''{{gossip|I am here with Ban Bearheart, and we demand an audience with Taran Zhu!}}''

: {{text|yell|Shado-Pan Sentinel|Who are YOU to make demands of the SHADO-PAN?}}
: ''The sentinel turns hostile and is possessed by rage!''
