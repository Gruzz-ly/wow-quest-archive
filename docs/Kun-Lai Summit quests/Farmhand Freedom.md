==Objectives==
Free 12 Farmstead Slaves by killing Ordo Overseers.
*[[Farmstead Slave]]s freed (12)

==Description==
Those Ordo [[yaungol]] are working my farmhands to death! It just ain't right.

Please, <class>, save them before it's too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Look, <mister/lady>, I don't mean to be telling you your business, but I can still see a lot of my farmhands still out there.

==Completion==
Now ain't you just the thing?

Though, I guess it's not fair to force these here workers to stay with us, now that we don't have much work for 'em...

==Notes==
Pick up [[... and the Pot, Too!]] before heading out.

Each overseer kill frees three slaves, and there are plenty of root vegetables on the ground. Should the [[Wascally Wirmen]] show up, kill it for six vegetables! The Cast Iron Pot is guarded by [[Cookie McYaungol]] inside the burned-out farmhouse near the middle of the farm.

On completion, three [[Freed Farmhand]]s appear next to Farmer Chow.
