==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lao-Chin the Iron Belly]] at [[Winter's Blossom]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].
*Talk with Suna Silentstrike to Take a Kite to Lao-Chin {{co|29.3|62.3|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
Alright. Thanks to you, we have the wall under control. Good job.

I'll stay up here for a little while and make sure no more [[yaungol]] get up onto the wall.

You, though, should go back down and see what Lao-Chin has cooked up. I hate to say it, but maybe he had a good idea after all...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|6}}
*16200 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Ah, hello again.  As sad as I am to have to do this, I'm glad I came up with something.

==Completion==
Good to see you made it back in one piece. Thanks to your help with the barrels, I've managed to brew up a good surprise for our yaungol friends at the front.

==Notes==
The kite drops players off at the business end of the battlefield refreshment device below Winter's Blossom.

: You ready?
''{{gossip|Alright, I'm ready to get back to the front.}}''
