==Objectives==
Find [[Wu-Peng]] in the [[Inkgill Mere]].

==Description==
My son - can you find my son?

When the [[Jinyu]] attacked, he ran off in the confusion. I don't know if they've done anything with him, or if he's still alive, even.

Nothing else matters if I can't find him.

I'd ask [[Swordmistress Mei|Mei]]... but something's wrong with her. She seems too... impulsive since the attack. I just can't trust that she'd bring him back safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|10}}
*64000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So horrible... When I saw the killing, I just ran. My father, Mei... are they alive?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Repossession]], [[Enraged Vengeance]], [[The Waterspeaker's Staff]], and [[Free the Dissenters]] before heading out.

Cross to the north over the mere to the far side of the village and start hunting for goods and jinyu. Orachi is on the northern shore, and Wu-Peng is on the north side of the north shore hiding behind a big shell. Feel free to instantly turn in My Son... and pick up [[Father and Child Reunion]] from him, as it is not an escort.
