== Description ==
Ah, I can still remember running fights out of a muddy hole in the ground back in Nagrand. We've come a long way, eh, Wodin?

I tell you, there's nothing more these Tiger monks like than a good scrap. So much so that they've paid good coin for me to set up shop here and help draw the strongest fighters from all around!

So how about it? You and a couple friends up for a few rounds in the Arena of Annihilation...? Big money, big prizes!
