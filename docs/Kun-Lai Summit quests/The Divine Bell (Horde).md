==Objectives==
Kill Sarannha Skyglaive.
*[[Sarannha Skyglaive]] slain

==Description==
If the [[Alliance]] thought they could steal the [[:Divine Bell]] from us, they were wrong!

Even now, we have them trapped in the crypts beneath us.

Death will be the price they pay for defying us.

Come, <class>. Let us show them the error of their ways.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]
*+350 reputation with [[Horde]]

==Completion==
[[Darnassus]], is it?

The Alliance believes they have won the day. Now, when their arrogance is at its greatest, is our opportunity to pluck the prize from their fingers.
