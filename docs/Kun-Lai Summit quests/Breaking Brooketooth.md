==Objectives==
[[File:Broketooth Charger.jpg|thumb|[[Broketooth Charger]].]]
[[File:Broketooth Tosser.jpg|thumb|[[Broketooth Tosser]].]]
Kill 8 Broketooth Chargers and 6 Broketooth Tossers.
*[[Broketooth Charger]] slain (8)
*[[Broketooth Tosser]] slain (6)

==Description==
Hozen only ravage when they think their supplies are too few for their number of mouths.

Problem is, hozen always have more mouths than food.

We have very few grummles these days.

It is a hard thing to ask, but can you be a friend to grummles, and destroy some of the Broketooth hozen south of here? It is the only way to prevent them from destroying the landscape.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is not vengeance or fortune, it is survival.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Hopefully that will slow the Broketooth ravage.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Monkey Idol]] and [[No Pack Left Behind]] before heading out.

Due south is the mouth of the [[Deeper]] cave system. Start killing hozen and looking for grummle corpses. Just outside of the Deeper is [[Hateful Ko Ko]] and his altar. Kill him and loot the [[Corpse of Ko Ko]], then place it on his altar. Enter the Deeper to find [[Dak Dak]]. Loot the [[Corpse of Dak Dak]] and place it on his altar in the center of the big room on the lower level. Exit the cave system and head east to reach [[Camp Broketooth]]. [[Tak Tak]] is out on the surface at the back of the camp to the southeast. Put the [[Corpse of Tak Tak]] on his altar, then wrap up the other quests before heading back.
