==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Captain Ripflesh.jpg|Captain Ripflesh|The commander of the Blackmane Mercenaries.}}
Kill Captain Ripflesh and 6 Blackmane Mercenaries.
*[[Captain Ripflesh]] slain {{co|62.1|23.3|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*Blackmane Mercenaries slain (6)

==Description==
After the mercenaries robbed us, most left.

But one of them... after the others took all we had, he ran the rest of us through. For sport!

Get justice for the fallen. Perhaps news of their death will raise my spirits enough to go on.

You'll find them just west of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are they dead? Have you dealt with them?

==Completion==
Ahh... they are dead. Already, I can feel my spirits lifting. Soon I will have the strength to return to the village.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Scent of Life]] and [[By the Falls, For the Fallen]] before heading out.

Exit the village to the south and circle to the northeast. Start killing [[Azure Prickly Crawler]]s for the shell, [[Blackmane Brigand]]s, [[Blackmane Tracker]]s, and [[Blackmane Pillager]]s for Justice and a chance at the spices. [[South Sea Booty Barrel]]s are all over the area near pirates. Then find [[Captain Ripflesh]] in the depression south of the pirate camp. He is a [[gnoll]] who acts as a hunter with Concussive Shot, Black Arrow, and Explosive Shot. He also has:
*{{abilities|Smoke Bomb!|Casts a smoke bomb, stunning nearby enemies for until cancelled.|notes=Instant. Cast at 50%. Also knocks players up in the air.}}
At 50% health:
:''Ripflesh casts Smoke Bomb, knocking all players in the air, then disappears.''

:''Ripflesh is hiding in one of the four barrels, and [[Gnoll Decoy]]s are sitting on the other three.''
Break one of the decoys:

Focus on him and finish him off:

He drops the [[Crumpled Bill of Sale]]:

Head to the southwest to find waterfalls, with [[Lightfooted Snapclaw]]s striding the water. Polished stones can be found underneath the waterfalls—several of which can be found uphill near the village.
