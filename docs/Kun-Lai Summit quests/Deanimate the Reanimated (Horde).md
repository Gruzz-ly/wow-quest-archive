== Objectives ==
Destroy any 14 [[Terracotta Warrior]]s or [[Terracotta Guardian]]s.

== Description ==
I've got much to do here, <name>. I could use your help.

There's a place to the northwest. The pandaren here call it Mogujia. Something's causing the statues there to animate, and our pandaren friends here are pretty spooked about it.

If they're not dealt with soon, we might have a serious problem. We just moved in. It's not like we can afford to fight a war with an army of statues right now.

==Progress==
Weren't you going to destroy all of those mogu statues so that we don't, you know, get overrun by them?

==Completion==
Oh, you dealt with the statues? Good work. Here's something for your trouble.

== Gains ==
You will receive: {{cost|10|20|}} (or {{cost|10|85|}} if completed at level 90)

Upon completion of this quest you will also gain:	
*129,000 [[XP]]

==Progression==
{{The Road to Kun-Lai}}

==Patch changes==
