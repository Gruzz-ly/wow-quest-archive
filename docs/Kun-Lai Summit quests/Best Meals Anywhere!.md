==Objectives==
Collect 160 Kun-Lai Meaty Bits.
*[[Kun-Lai Meaty Bits]] (160)

==Description==
Yeah, yeah. Everyone knows us goblins do tinkering. And explosives. And... well, ya' know, the less reputable stuff. But what nobody knows is that I'm really a great chef! It's a hobby of mine. Gather us up some meaty bits from the creatures around here, and I'll cook us up the best meals ANYWHERE! And I promise, I'll only use three or four percent rocket fuel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20|}} (or {{cost|10|85|}} if completed at level 90)
*129,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The meaty bits, <name>? We need 'em!

==Completion==
You know what they say about cooking - GTL. Garnish, taste... and... laundry?

==Notes and trivia==
;On approach
*{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Heya, <name>. Nice work here, chief.}}
*{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|You're helpin' those farmers out, right, ace? We're countin' on you to get us some grub.}}
*{{Text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|What gives? You gotta get to that farm. Did Kiryn send you to do her work? She's so lazy!}}

This quest references two different goblin NPC quotes: "I got the best deals anywhere!" and "GTL, friend: Gambling, tinkering, laundry."
