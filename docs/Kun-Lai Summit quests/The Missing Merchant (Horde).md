==Objectives==
Speak with [[Merchant Shi]] at [[Inkgill Mere]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

==Description==
Usually, Merchant Shi comes through Kun-Lai Summit to trade with the [[jinyu]] and [[grummle]]. We've heard word that he hadn't been seen at [[Binan Village|Binan]], and we haven't seen him here... I'm worried something has happened to him. Can you go to the Inkgill Mere and see if he's there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My son! They took my son... Can you help me?

==Notes==
This is an ''optional'' breadcrumb to the Inkgill Mere quest chain. Fly back to Binan Village to save some time.
