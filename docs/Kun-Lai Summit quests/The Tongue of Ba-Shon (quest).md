Assist [[Lorewalker Cho]] in performing the Binding of Ba-Shon.
*Tongue of Ba-Shon Bound

==Description==
Thank you for coming, <name>. I am sorry to have been so cryptic, but I could not risk alerting the [[mogu]] to my work here.

They're out in force, as I'm sure you've noticed. Plundering the tombs of their old kings for relics of power.

I could not observe them long before having to flee, but I did manage to recover a relic of my own.

The Tongue of Ba-Shon will let us communicate securely over long distances, but only after I have bound it to myself.

I think I'm ready to begin, if you are.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 XP

==Progress==
I'll need to bind my essence to the Tongue, then you can use it to speak with me from anywhere.

==Completion==
This must be a very powerful relic for Zuan to want it back so badly.

It frightens me to think of what else they may find in the tombs...

==Notes==
Speak with him again.
:Alright, we're ready to get started.
:{{gossip|Go ahead with the binding, Cho.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The binding should only take a moment, but I'll be completely entranced.}}
:''Cho walks over to the circular rug and sits.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Watch my back - I trust you can handle any interruptions.}}
:{{text|yell|Reclaimer Zuan|LOREWALKER! You have something of mine.}}
:{{text|say|Reclaimer Zuan|Clever, hiding out up here - using the elements to shield your tracks. But my quilen hounds could sense the Tongue even here.}}
:{{text|say|Reclaimer Zuan|Yachi! Yao! Rip these fools to shreds!}}

[[Reclaimer Zuan]] is a mogu with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Reclaim Strength|range=40|Inflicts 18 Shadow damage and transfers 5% of the target's power to the Reclaimer per sec.|notes=Instant. Ticks for 4611 Shadow. Stacks.}}
*{{abilities|Enrage|Increases damage dealt by 20%.|notes=Instant. Self-buff. Stacks. Cast on each quilen's death.}}

He also has two [[quilen]], [[Yachi]] and [[Yao]]. All three attack at the same time. He will enrage for +20% damage on each quilen's death, so make the decision on whether or not to take them down before focusing on him.
*{{text|say|Reclaimer Zuan|My precious Yachi! You'll pay for that!}}
*{{text|say|Reclaimer Zuan|My precious Yao! You'll pay for that!}}

Either way, finish him off.
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|All done. Did I miss anything?}}

==Progression==
