{{questportrait|Mogujia Soul-Caller.jpg|Mogujia Soul-Caller|The real source of the problems at Mogujia...}}
Kill the Mogujia Soul-Caller.
*[[Mogujia Soul-Caller]] slain {{co|58.1|70.9|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
I know your friends are worried about the animating statues over at [[Mogujia]], but I'll tell you what you should be really worried about.

Where there are animated statues, there are [[Mogu]]. I don't know if you've seen one before, but if you haven't...

Well, let's just say Mogu are bad, bad, news.

While you're dealing with whatever else you're doing, you need to get the Mogu behind the trouble!

==Rewards==

|Serenity Headcover
|Mindbender Cowl
|Silentleaf Helm
|Yak Herder Helm

You will also receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
*161000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find him? Is he dead? No? Oh, man. Don't make me worried!

==Completion==
Oh, thank goodness! You've saved all of our skins, believe me.

You have no idea how much trouble those guys can stir up.

Err, or, I guess you do, now. Kind of. Almost.

Imagine that, but a lot worse, and for a couple thousand years.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Round 'Em Up (Horde)]], [[Best Meals Anywhere!]], [[Deanimate the Reanimated (Horde)]], and [[Trouble on the Farmstead (Horde)]] before heading out.

Head northeast and start killing beasts to reach [[Mogujia]]. Before killing the constructs, however, circle around to the southeast to find [[Bao Jian]], who offers [[Profiting off of the Past]]. That quest in hand,  start killing to the northeast of the camp and head up the mountain to find the [[Mogujia Soul-Caller]]. Kill him, then keep killing out of the mogu territory to hit quota. Then search for yaks and head south to the [[Chow Farmstead]], killing beasts all along the way. Do their quests, then head back to Eastwind.
