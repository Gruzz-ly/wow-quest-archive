== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Shado-Master Chong}} at [[Shado-Pan Fallback]] in [[Firebough Nook]].

== Description ==
Our new recruits have spoken in hushed tones about a group of pandaren they call the "Shado-Pan". They are apparently very strong, and secretive. It's clear that, no matter what happens here in Kun-Lai, making an alliance with these Shado-Pan will be critical to our foothold in Pandaria.

That's where you come in. Rumor is they have a base of operations to the southeast, near Firebough Nook. You will go there, and curry there favor. For the Horde!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|2}}

== Completion ==
Who are you? Can you fight? If so, we can use your help.

== Gains ==
* 12900 XP

== Notes ==
This is an ''optional'' breadcrumb to the Shado-Pan quest chain, starting at [[Firebough Nook]].

==Progression==
{{Firebough Nook}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
