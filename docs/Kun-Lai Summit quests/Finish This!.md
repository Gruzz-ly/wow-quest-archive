==Objectives==
[[File:Gong Da.jpg|thumb|[[Gong Da]].]]
Finish the battle for the [[Ox Gate]].
*Battle for The Ox Gate completed {{co|31.2|61.7|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
We've heard back from [[Suna Silentstrike|Suna]], on the wall. Something's going on...

It looks like they are preparing for their final push. It's time to finish this, friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|21|20}}
*203000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Lin is captured... we must break [[Taran Zhu]] from his complacence!

==Completion==
Well, their lieutenant is dead. I think we have finally pushed them out of [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]].

But at what cost? So many dead, [[Lin Silentstrike|Lin]] captured... I will not allow Taran Zhu to continue to ignore his charge.

==Notes==
On accept, a cutscene:
:''The yaungol, blown to smithereens by the keg bombs, turn tail and run. Lin quickly follows them. Suddenly, Gong Da appears from the top of the [[Ox Gate]] and jumps down.''
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin|The yaungol warlord shows his face! Come, let's finish this!}}
[[Ban Bearheart]], [[Suna Silentstrike]], and [[Lao-Chin the Iron Belly]] are all on the path as [[Gong Da]] appears! He is a level 88 elite yaungol with 2,171,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Thundering Stomp|Inflicts 12 Physical damage every .5 secs for 4 sec.|notes=Channeled, ticks for 2360 Physical every half-second in a ~10-yard-radius area of effect.}}
*{{abilities|Backhand|range=Melee|Inflicts 110% weapon damage and knocks the target back.}}
The three NPCs will tank him, so just unload.

On complete:
:''Lao-Chin breaks down in tears.''
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Lao-Chin! We have won the day. Why are you weeping?}}
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|All those barrels... some of my finest brew. At least it went out in a blaze of glory!}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|Wait - where is [[Lin Silentstrike|Lin]]?}}
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|I thought he was with you?}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|Where is my husband!?}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|He must have pursued the fleeing yaungol while we intercepted their leader.}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|I'm going ahead.  I will see you on the other side... I hope.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Patience, Suna! If we march into [[Townlong Steppes|Townlong]] alone, we compound our problems. We must focus on the Monastery and get reinforcements.}}
