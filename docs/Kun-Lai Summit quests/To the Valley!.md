==Objectives==
Find your "Friend from Silvermoon" at the Valley of Emperors. Speak to [[Tak-Tak]] at [[Domination Point]] for transportation.
*Find Your "Friend From Silvermoon"
*[[Sealed Note]] (provided)

==Description==
This sealed communication was sent for you, along with urgent orders to travel to the [[Valley of Emperors]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]]. This looks serious. I'd not delay if I were you.

Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Completion==
Ah, good. You have come.

Again, I apologize for the cryptic note - but [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] is increasingly distrustful of us. I do not want this operation disturbed by hasty action on his part.

==Notes==
[[Tak-Tak]] offers a ride on [[Tak-Tak's Kite|his kite]]:
:{{Gossip|Take me to Mogujia.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Ooh, big stuff's shakin'.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|I heard some pretty elfs got slap-slapped up at Mogujia.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Say, wasn't you there? Did you see it?}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|The blood elves weren't prepared to fight the Korune mogu. Lotta blood elves died, but I heard you saved many survivors.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Anyway, big elf leader, Lor'them-somethin'... he's real mad!}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|He's still loyal to your Warchief, but he wants to do things differently.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Garrosh all about strength! Lor'themar all about strategy.}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Even a simple hozen like Tak-Tak can see that!}}
:{{text|say|Tak-Tak|Oh look, we are here. Later!}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Orestes! Aenea! You are to accompany <name> on his mission.}}
:{{text|say|[[Aenea]]|Yes, my lord.}}
:{{text|say|[[Ranger Orestes]]|Another mission with Aenea? If I must.}}
