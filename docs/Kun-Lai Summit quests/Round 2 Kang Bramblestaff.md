== Description ==
Your next challenger is a Bramblestaff. Strength is in their blood. I remember a full century of only Bramblestaff champions.

No pressure, little <race>.

Go to the eastern arena north of here and face this young challenger. See first hand if strength is earned or inherited.

== Progress ==
I was once defeated in a match by a Bramblestaff. In my defense, he distracted me with a ball of yarn.

== Completion ==
Ah. The Bramblestaff family have long held the championship generation after generation. I am sure this one will take the title sooner or later as well.
