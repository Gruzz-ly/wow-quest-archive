:{{text|bossemote|Use the Kor'kron Disguise, then search for intel in the middle of Garrosh'ar Advance.}}

USE THE DISGUISE, then head in to camp. Get close to Garrosh, Baine, Ishi, and Shan Kien to begin a short script event:
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|I am losing patience, Shan Kien. Tell me where I can find the Divine Bell!}}
:{{text|say|Shan Kien|Kill me if you must, but I owe no allegiance to you or your Horde. The only master I serve is the Thunder King.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Ishi, draw your blade. A few carefully delivered cuts will change his mind.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Garrosh, please. There may be another way. One that requires no bloodshed.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Speak, then!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Let us use persuasion, not force. I have here a cask of pandaren Memory Wine. It will allow us to see into Shan Kien's past.}}
The Memory Wine is between Baine and Shan Kien next to the bonfire, so use it.

A cutscene begins:
:''On the northern coast of Kun-Lai, the camera tracks east before panning south to show the entrance of the [[Ruins of Korune]]. [[Shan Kien]] stands outside as [[Dreadweaver Avartu]] runs up from the path leading into the ruins.''
:{{text|say|Shan Kien|Are the preparations complete?}}
:{{text|say|Dreadweaver Avartu|Yes, Warlord.  The traps are set.  The Divine Bell will be safe within this crypt, ready for the day that the [[Thunder King]] returns.}}
:{{text|say|Dreadweaver Avartu|We have but to evacuate the workers and the rest of our warriors.}}
:{{text|say|Shan Kien|There is no time.  The [[Shado-Pan]] trackers are too close.  They cannot learn the location of the Bell.}}
:{{text|say|Dreadweaver Avartu|Very well, then.  May the ghosts of our brothers guard this place for all eternity.}}
:{{text|say|Shan Kien|Their sacrifice will not be in vain.}}
:{{text|say|Shan Kien|And neither, Avartu, will yours.}}
:''Shan Kien roundhouse kicks Avartu back into the crypt and calls lightning, bringing down a rockfall to block off the entrance.''

Cutscene complete, head back to the [[Grummle Bazaar]] and turn in to [[Agent Connelly]]. This completes the "Secrets of the Past" portion of [[Operation: Shieldwall Campaign]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Agent Connelly|WHAT?!  You saw where the mogu hid the Divine Bell?  I'll alert [[Lion's Landing]] immediately.  We gotta get this thing before Garrosh.  We'll contact you as soon as we find it!}}

Connelly will also send a letter via the in-game mail system as well:
{{book|Finding the Divine Bell|content=Agent <name>!

Bang-up job infiltrating the [[Garrosh'ar Advance]].  We have an advantage over the Horde: our [[Explorer's League]] is miles ahead when it comes to finding historical sites here.  And [[Anduin Wrynn|Prince Anduin]] has made some friends with the [[Lorewalkers]].

I have no doubt we'll find the Divine Bell before [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh's]] goons.  A crack [[night elf|night elven]] squad is already assembling to secure the artifact when we find it.  You should be there too.  Keep your ears open and be ready to move out as soon{{sic}}!
