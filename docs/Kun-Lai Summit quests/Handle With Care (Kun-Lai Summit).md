==Objectives==
Bring {{NPC||Elder Shu}} 50 Volatile Blooms.
*[[Handful of Volatile Blooms]] (50)

==Description==
I've seen the numbers these invaders have brought with them, this will not be an easy victory. I do know of one thing that may help us gain an advantage.

There is a plant that grows around the village that can be used to make a rather effective explosive liquid. If you can gather enough I can begin brewing the mixture.

The plant you are looking for is appropriately named volatile bloom. Handle it with care, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find a suitable amount of volatile blooms?

==Completion==
These are perfect! Now, I would go wash your hands a few times, <class>.

I would also continue to avoid open flames for a few days...

==Notes==
Pick up [[It Takes A Village]], [[Checking In]], [[What's Yours Is Mine]], and [[Make A Fighter Out of Me]] before heading out.

First up, talk to [[Exhausted Defender]]s around the village border:
:{{gossip|I'll cover your post. Go rest and be with your family.}}
*{{text|say|I was starting to wonder how long I would be out here.}}
*{{text|say|Those Zandalari will regret attacking Zouchin!}}
*{{text|say|I'm grateful to you, friend.}}
*{{text|say|My poor old bones were starting to get stiff out here.}}
*{{Text|say|You do us a great service friend.}}

While making the rounds, keep an eye out for [[Volatile Blooms]]. They gather in handfuls of 7-11. Once the defenders have been relieved, go east down the path toward the [[Zandalari Vanguard]]. Kill trolls for blood-stained blades and so Shomi can see what it takes.

Once those four quests are done (feel free to turn them in), head northwest to the [[Zouchin Strand]]. [[Sage Liao]] is on his stomach in the sand.
