==Objectives==
Round up 3 Wild Plains Yaks and return them to [[Westwind Rest]].
*[[Wild Plains Yak|Yaks rounded up]] (3)

==Description==
Mobility is going to be key to maintaining our foothold in this new land. Problem is, there's no way to maintain mobility without mounts, and... well, we don't have many of those here, now do we?

The local [[yak]]s seem to make good mounts. At least, the local [[Pandaren]] say they do. Why don't you go round up some for us?

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's going to take more yaks than that to get this place back into fightin' condition, <name>, yes it is.

==Completion==
These yaks will do the trick nicely. Good work, <name>. I'm feeling better about this whole situation already.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Deanimate the Reanimated (Alliance)]], [[Blue Dwarf Needs Food Badly]], [[Mogu?! Oh No-gu! (Alliance)]] and [[Trouble on the Farmstead (Alliance)]] before heading about. While out and about killing mogu constructs and beasts, keep an eye out for yaks. Click on three of them, then head back to [[Westwind Rest]] to drop them off for Taylor.
