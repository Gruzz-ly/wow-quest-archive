==Objectives==
Free 6 [[Silvermoon Runeseeker|Domination Mages]] by killing [[Korune Warden]]s.
*[[Blood elf|Blood Elves]] saved (6)

==Description==
We managed to fend off the [[mogu]] wardens and their [[Quilen|dogs]], but many of the blood elves from the scouting party were not as lucky.

Many of my people are trapped inside the ruins to the north. We are devising a solution to break them out, but I believe there may be a more straightforward approach.

Go to the ruins and kill the wardens guarding each prisoner. If my intuition is correct, this will free our comrades.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|8|60}}
* 12,320 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Progress==
These mogu are not to be underestimated.

==Completion==
We blood elves have served the Horde faithfully. Lately, I wonder what we have to gain from Garrosh's leadership.

==Notes==
Kill [[Korune Warden]] to free [[Dominance Mage]]s.
