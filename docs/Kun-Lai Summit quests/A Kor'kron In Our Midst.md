*[[Kor'kron Disguise]]

==Description==
[[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] is hell-bent on finding that Divine Bell. I wouldn't be surprised if he tore [[Kun-Lai Summit]] apart to find that artifact.

The Warchief's called a gathering at [[Garrosh'ar Advance]], just to our north.

I need to stay here to monitor troop movements, so you'll have to infiltrate their camp and overhear their discussion.

Go to Garrosh'ar Advance and steal some Kor'kron Armor from [[Kor'kron Reaver (Kun-Lai Summit)|Reavers]], [[Kor'kron Honor Guard (Kun-Lai Summit)|Honor Guards]], and [[Kor'kron Scout (Kun-Lai Summit)|Scouts]].

Take this radio earpiece. Don't contact me... I'll contact you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Progress==
Just as you look at the assembled Kor'kron disguise, your radio earpiece crackles.

==Completion==
<Agent Connelly's voice comes over the radio.>

Ey, you're good! I knew those Kor'kron wouldn't be a problem fer ya. Couldn't've done much better meself.

==Notes==
Head northwest out of the bazaar and follow the path until it makes a hard turn to the south at {{co|63|60|Kun-Lai Summit}}, marked by a short length of fence and a sleeping [[Summit Prowler]]. Keep heading northwest to reach the [[Garrosh'ar Advance]], a Horde camp, hastily-constructed after the Landfall.

The [[Kor'kron Helmet]] drops from [[Kor'kron Reaver (Kun-Lai Summit)|Kor'kron Reaver]]s, the [[Kor'kron Armor]] drops from [[Kor'kron Honor Guard (Kun-Lai Summit)|Kor'kron Honor Guard]]s, and the [[Kor'kron Boots]] drops from [[Kor'kron Scout (Kun-Lai Summit)|Kor'kron Scout]]s. Kill some of each until the quest items drop, then combine the three into the [[Kor'kron Disguise]]. The quest will complete automatically once the Disguise has been created.

==Progression==
{{Alliance Pandaren campaign}}
