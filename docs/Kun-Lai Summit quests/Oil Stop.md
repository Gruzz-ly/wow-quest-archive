==Objectives==
Fill the Empty Oil Vial at a Yaungol Oil Derrick.
*[[Filled Oil Vial]]
*[[Empty Oil Vial]] (provided)

==Description==
When the [[yaungol]]s came, they began to dig up oil. What is this "[[oil]]", I wonder? Perhaps it is thing of much undiscovered luck. This I must know.

Here, take this vial, and fill it with yaungol oil from one of their [[Oil platform|windmills]]. I will give you many fortunes if you bring me some.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yaungols are scary. Yaungols with a luckydo like this "oil" are more scary.

==Completion==
Happy day! Your reward. May these coins bring you good fortune.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Grummle's Luck]] and [[Traffic Issues]] before heading out.

Head southwest up the hill back to the [[Fire Camp Ruqin]]. [[Ruqin Elder|Elders]], [[Ruqin Infantry|infantry]], and [[Ruqin Outrider|outriders]] all count. Luckydo bags are all over the camp. Check inside tents and on the back of catapults. The oil derricks are the big windmills in the center of camp. Interact with the oil barrels in the back of the derrick to fill the vial.
