== Objectives ==
Free 8 Pandaren Prisoners.
*{{NPC||Pandaren Prisoner}}s rescued x8

== Description ==
Look, I know the Alliance needs recruits, and there's just not enough of us here right now to make a fighting presence of this town.

But I know that the [[yaungol]] over at [[Fire Camp Ordo]], to the northwest, have taken many of my people as prisoners. And I also know that if you would be willing to rescue them from their captivity, they'd more than likely be willing to join the Alliance.

What do you say, <name>?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
You haven't rescued them all... otherwise they'd have come back here!

== Completion ==
Well, if it isn't our hero, <name>.

I really wasn't sure we stood a fighting chance out here, you know?

These guys may be a little rough around the edges, but we'll be able to whip 'em into shape. And when we do, we'll have a real fighting chance at holding our own here in Kun-Lai.

Good work.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[In Tents Channeling (Alliance)]] and [[Barrels of Fun (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Start freeing pandaren and looting barrels. The barrels are unique, so pick one up, run it to an oil rig, place it, and run away and repeat. The four yaungol are found in tents marked by fire lines exiting their central poles. When the fourth yaungol is dead, In Tents will complete automatically. Turn it in and pick up [[The Ordo Warbringer (Alliance)]], then go kill {{NPC||Ordo Warbringer}} before heading back.

On complete:

:{{text|yell|Alliance Trainee|For the Alliance!}} (x lots)
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|You've done great work. We should be able to maintain our base of operations here now without too much trouble.}}
