This quest is an optional breadcrumb to the opening of the [[Gate of the August Celestials]] quest chain. In [[Patch 5.4.0]], its text was changed significantly to reflect the corruption of the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Sunwalker Dezco||Dezco}} at the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

== Description ==
Have you heard the news, traveler? There's been an attack at one of our most sacred places, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms!

Even now, there's a human prince within the White Tiger Temple arguing that you and the other races from beyond the mists should be allowed within.

The temple is in the northeast of Kun-Lai. Maybe you can convince the White Tiger to allow you inside?

I only hope the Vale has not been utterly destroyed...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|70}}
* 97,000 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
Welcome, <class>! We have been granted an audience with the White Tiger. The Vale of Eternal Blossoms was recently [[Heart of Y'Shaarj|savaged]] by our [[Garrosh Hellscream|Warchief]], and we are arguing that both the [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] should be permitted back inside to repair the damage.

The Vale is a sacred place. I believe my wife [[Leza Dawnchaser|Leza]] saw it in a vision - it's what brought my people here to Pandaria. We must save it!

Do you think we will be allowed inside?

==Notes==
Inside the main temple building as the player arrives, {{NPC||Xuen}} is holding court with {{NPC||Taran Zhu}}, {{NPC||Zhi the Harmonious}}, {{NPC||Anduin Wrynn}} and {{NPC||Sunwalker Dezco}} in attendance.
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Half of the Vale lies in ruin! These outsiders have been more destructive than the mantid and mogu combined!}}
:{{text|say|[[Anduin Wrynn]]|Give us a chance to put things right.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Great Tiger, the strangers from beyond the mists, they cannot be trusted. The wreckage in the [[Jade Forest]] can attest to this.}}

When talked to, Dezco has this to say:
:[[Light]] be with you, <race>.
:{{Gossip|The Prince of [[Stormwind (kingdom)|Stormwind]] is unguarded! Why don't we capture him for the Horde?}}
:Hah! Spoken like a true disciple of Garrosh Hellscream. Our "Warchief" would be proud.
:But MY horde{{Sic}} does not fight unarmed children. Nor would I dare bring our war to this sacred chamber, in the presence of an [[August Celestial]] himself.
:Besides, this little one has earned the friendship and trust of High Chieftain [[Baine Bloodhoof]]. For that reason, consider him under my protection.
:For now.

==Original version==
{{Rfg-section|5.4.0}}
This quest and associated dialogue were reworded after [[Garrosh Hellscream]] caused the corruption of much of the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] in [[patch 5.4.0]]. Formerly, it focused on the historic nature of the opening of the gates for the first time in many years. The NPCs discussed incursions by the [[Mogu]] instead of the attack by Hellscream, although [[Taran Zhu]]'s objections to the Horde and Alliance remained the same.

;Description
:Have you heard the news, traveller? After thousands of years, the [[Golden Lotus]] has petitioned the [[August Celestial|celestials]] to open the gates to the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]]!

:Even now, there's a human prince within the White Tiger Temple arguing that you and the other races from beyond the mists should be allowed within.

:The Temple is in the northeast of Kun-Lai. Maybe you can convince the White Tiger to allow you inside?

:This is a truly historic moment...

;Completion
:Hello, <class>! The human prince from Stormwind has been granted an audience with the White Tiger. He seeks to gain admittance into the Vale of Eternal Blossoms... for both the Alliance and the Horde.

:The Vale is a sacred place. I believe my wife Leza saw it in a vision - it's what brought my people to Pandaria. Perhaps we will find shelter there.

:Do you think we will be allowed inside?

;NPC dialogue
:{{text|say|Zhi the Harmonious|...I've seen them with my own eyes: [[Mogu]] legions, storming the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]] in force. We are not trained for mass combat!}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|...}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Great Tiger, the strangers from beyond the mists, they cannot be trusted. The wreckage in the [[Jade Forest]] can attest to this.}}
