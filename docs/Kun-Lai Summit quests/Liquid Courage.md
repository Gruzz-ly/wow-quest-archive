==Objectives==
Mount Mobi and defeat the mogu armies with the power of brew.
* Mount [[Mobi]]
* [[Mogu]] [[Soldier]]s defeated (80)

==Description==
We have to do something about all these mogu. At least to thin their ranks before they invade the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]]!

As much as [[Chen Stormstout|Uncle Chen]] loves his brew, I think we can put it to better use. Let's hop onto that [[yak]] and give the mogu something to fear!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Something must be done about all these mogu, or we will lose the Vale.

==Completion==
All that lovely brew... gone.

But let us look on the bright side. There are fewer mogu to contend with now. It is time for us to report back.

==Notes==
*Kill: [[Baruk Stoneshaper]]s, [[Baruk Bladeward]]s, [[Dokani Bloodbinder]]s, [[Dokani Shadowblade]]s, [[Dokani Warframe]]s, [[Saurok Laborer]]s, [[Zan-Tien Conjurer]]s, [[Zan-Tien Pikeman]], and [[Zan-tien Quilen]].

You'll get a vehicle action bar that has:
#{{Abilities|Head Butt|id=305961|Butt heads with the Mogu.|icon=ability_mount_yakmount}}
#{{Abilities|Trample|id=306601|Charge forward 30 yards, knocking back enemies and damaging them.|icon=ability_warstomp}}
#{{Abilities|Smash Brew|id=306599|Smash brew kegs straight down on top of mogu.|icon=inv_cask_04}}
#{{Abilities|Healing Brew|id=305959|Heal Mobi.|icon=inv_firstaid_healingsalve}}

Using Headbutt while on the run appears to do more damage than standing still. Smash Brew is an AOE.

;Smash Brew
* {{text|say|Chen Stormstout|And there goes the Goldendraft...}}
* {{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Was that really necessary?}}
* {{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Not the Traveling Lager! What a shame...}}
* {{text|say|Chen Stormstout|If you could just... perhaps save a little of that?}}
* {{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Stormstout brew is not a weapon!}}

At the end of your run, return to the gate to auto dismount. To Chen's melancholy, all the kegs on Mobi have indeed been used up.

==Progression==
{{Mogu at the Gates}}

==Patch changes==
