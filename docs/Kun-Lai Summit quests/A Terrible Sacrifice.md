==Objectives==
Gather 6 Barrels of Yaungol Fire Oil.
*[[Yaungol Oil Barrel]] (6)

==Description==
I have an idea, and... am prepared to make a terrible sacrifice.

As much as I know that we need my stout brew, to fortify our defenders for the long-term security of the Ox Gate...

It is too painful to discuss details now, but please - while you are up here defending the wall, gather the barrels of oil they are using to light their arrows. We will need them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Do you have the oil?

==Completion==
Alright. I am off to prepare our next move. Good luck, friend.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Off the Wall!]] before heading out.

Step outside to the northwest and get killing. These mobs do not drop any loot, so feel free to have some fun and kick the yaungol off the wall once they drop below 30%.
