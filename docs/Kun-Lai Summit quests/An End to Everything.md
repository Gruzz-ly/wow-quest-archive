==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Tormented Spirits.
*[[Tormented Spirit (Kun-Lai Summit)|Tormented Spirit]] slain x5
*[[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] (provided)

==Description==
These spirits must have been released when the tombs were opened...

Death was not final for the [[Mogu]]. Instead, death was merely a stop over on the path to a new body. Spiritbinders used a foul magic to transfer spirits from one shell to the next.

Years of being trapped in the tombs has left them confused. They need to be destroyed before their confusion turns to anger or worse, they find a new shell.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
* 162000 XP

==Progress==
Have you disposed of the spirits yet?

==Completion==
You have done them a great service, <name>. It is a cruel fate to be stuck between the living world and the afterlife.

==Notes==
[[File:Curious Text.jpg|thumb|Curious Text.]]
