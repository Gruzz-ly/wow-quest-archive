==Objectives==
Use the Dit Da Jow or your own healing to aid 8 Injured Binan Warriors.
*[[Injured Binan Warrior]]s healed x8
*[[Dit Da Jow]] (provided)

==Description==
Our warriors are fighting to keep the [[yaungol]] at bay in the [[Kun-Lai Pass]] to the northwest.

Take this liniment. It is a powerful medicine that has been passed down in my family over the generations.

Use the dit da jow to heal the injured warriors if you do not have healing powers of your own to use on them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 XP

==Progress==
There are yet more injured warriors in need of aid, <class>.

==Completion==
You have my thanks, <name>. You have shown great honor through your actions.

I hope that my family's dit da jow was of some use to you.

==Notes==
On getting close to Cheng:
:{{text|say|Apothecary Cheng|Greetings, <class>. Your people are inside. But first, may I ask a favor?}}
Pick up [[Call Out Their Leader]] before heading out. Exiting the village and entering the battlefield, [[Commander Hsieh]] offers [[All of the Arrows]]. Pick it up too.

Kill any humanoid yaungol—the yaks don't count. Look specifically for units called "Injured Binan Warrior" to heal. Can be healed while mounted. Arrows litter the ground. Once enough regular yaungol are dead, the Fire-Warrior will start spawning on a giant battleyak on the main path. Find him and take him out.
