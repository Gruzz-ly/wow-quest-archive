==Objectives==
Find the Blood-Revealed Map on a [[Zandalari Warrior (Kun-Lai Summit)|Zandalari Warrior]].
*[[Blood-Revealed Map]]
*[[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] (provided)

==Description==
We need to figure out where they are taking the [[Thunder King]]'s remains. It won't be possible for them to resurrect him in the [[Valley of Emperors|Valley of the Emperors]]. They would need to be somewhere remote and secure.

It appears that getting out of here may also prove to be a challenge....

Fight your way out and look for information concerning location of the remains.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 414 trinkets
|Lorewalker's Mark
|Lorewalker's Emblem
|Lorewalker's Sigil
|Lorewalker's Medallion
|Lorewalker's Insignia}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 XP

==Progress==
Were you able to find any information on their location?

==Completion==
This is dark Zandalari [[blood magic]]. Once we're done with the map it should be burned.

The map indicates they have headed for the coast just outside a tiny fishing village called [[Zouchin Village|Zouchin]]. The villagers there may be able to help us find the Zandalari. We just have to hope the village is still standing...

==Notes==
In the central room are level 87 [[Zandalari Warrior (Kun-Lai Summit)|Zandalari Warriors]] with 214,000 health. Kill them until the map drops, then use [[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] to summon the [[Image of Lorewalker Cho]] again.

==Progression==
