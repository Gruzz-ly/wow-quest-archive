==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Brewmaster Chani.jpg|Brewmaster Chani|New to her status as a Brewmaster, her brews are painfully bitter.}}
Defeat Brewmaster Chani.
*Defeat [[Brewmaster Chani]] {{co|70.9|51.8|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
Welcome, Challenger, to my tournament of champions! Today we test the strengths of Pandaria's most dedicated heroes.

Your first opponent awaits you under the eastern gazebo. Defeat her, and you may proceed to the next round.

Fight with strength, fight with honor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Without conflict, there can be no growth.

The need to change, to persevere, to improve, these are the traits that bring champions to my doorstep.

==Completion==
Well done, challenger.

==Notes==
Fly northeast. Xuen has somehow gotten there instantly, but Chani is underneath the gazebo, drinking. She is a level 90 pandaren with 1,181,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Bitter Brew|A keg of bitter beer is being tossed.|range=40|notes=2 sec cast. A shadow appears where the projectile will land in a few seconds. Dodge it.}}
*{{abilities|The Steamer|A cone of steaming bitter brew deals 12,016 to 12,025 Nature damage every 0.5 sec to anyone in front of the caster. Lasts for 2 sec.|notes=1 sec cast. Frontal cone.}}
Speak with her:
:One sip of my brews and you will see how unworthy you really are.
:{{gossip|I challenge you.}}
:{{text|yell|Xuen|3... 2... 1... FIGHT!}}
:{{text|say\Brewmaster Chani|This is going to be easier than a drinking contest with a [[grummle]].}}
Chani generally uses her two ranged abilities, keeping her conveniently rooted on the ground. Either kite her around, using the four corner pillars that block line-of-sight, or just dodge the keg bombs and get behind her when she casts the steamer.

Victory:
:{{text|say|Brewmaster Chani|I surrender! You win.}}
:{{text|yell|Xuen|VICTORY!}}
Head just to the northwest of the gazebo to turn in to Xuen.
