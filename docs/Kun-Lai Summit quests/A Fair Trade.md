==Objectives==
Bring the Bundle of Kafa'kota Berries to the Lair of Kota Kon, near the top of [[Kota Peak]].
*[[Bundle of Kafa'kota Berries]] (provided)

==Description==
<The roar bellows out again, louder and more fierce than any of the yetis you've encountered so far. Again, a grummle voice replies...>

Eep! Please, great [[Kota Kon]], forgive grummle. Let me go, I'll bring lots of kafa right away! Promise!

<The beast called Kota Kon answers with another meaty roar.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Kota Kon wants more kafa, but I already fed her all I have! Then I tried giving her a nice bow, but she's not satisfied!

<The terrified grummle gulps and leans in close to whisper.>

I think she can smell the kafa I drank for breakfast...

==Completion==
You brought kafa?!

You...

Magnificent...

Luckydo...

Hurry, let's give it to her! Maybe she won't have us both for snack...

==Notes==
[[File:Nephew Burrberry.jpg|thumb|[[Nephew Burrberry]].]]
After looting 100 kota berries, [[Kota Blend]] completes automatically, and this quest is offered.

Head to the previously-empty cave higher up the mountain. Don't turn in unless all other quests are done, as this quest will drop players off back at the Kota Basecamp down at the base of the mountain.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Nephew Burrberry|Look, pretty girl, look! The nice <race> brought some kafa treats for you!}}
:''Kota Kon grabs the bundle and munches on it.''
:{{text|say|Nephew Burrberry|I think it's working...}}
:''She then grabs the grummle and the adventurer and starts leaping down the hill!''
:{{text|say|Nephew Burrberry|AAAAGHHHHH!!!!}}
:''She safely drops the grummle and the player just outside the base camp and sits down in the middle.''
:{{text|say|Newphew Burrberry|We're... we're alive!}}

==Progression==
{{Kota Basecamp}}
