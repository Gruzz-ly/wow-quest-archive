==Objectives==
Speak with Farmhand Ko and Elder Shiao in [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun Lai Summit]].
*Speak with [[Farmhand Ko]]
*Speak with [[Elder Shiao]]

==Description==
I am injured, but we can't stop here.

The [[hozen]] were... unreliable. The pandaren would be much better allies.

You have seen the refugees in this village, and heard of the yaungol invasion, no?

Well, we've heard from the locals that [[Eastwind Rest]], a nearby village, was destroyed by the [[Yaungol]].

Apparently some survivors have gathered along the road out of town.

Go. Take the road west. Gather the survivors.

We'll help them rebuild. Then, they will see the advantage of joining the Horde!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 12900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will not rest until our people are returned and this village rebuilt.

==Completion==
Well... we are alive, and that is better than we could have hoped for without your help.

But, if this is truly to become a base of operations for you, and if we are to join your Horde, there is one more thing you must do to guarantee our security.

==Notes==
Exit Binan and pass through the battleground of [[Kun-Lai Pass]]. Follow the road until it reaches the fork. Alongside a handful of evacuees is [[Farmhand Ko]]:
:The... the yaungol!

:They attacked my farm, and the nearby village, Eastwind Rest... killed some of us, and the ones they didn't kill they chased off!

:I managed to gather some of us here. Any word on help coming from Binan?

:{{gossip|I'm from the Horde. We're here to save you and rebuild your village.}}
:{{text|say|Farmhand Ko|I don't know about this "Horde", but you look trustworthy. I'll gather everyone up and meet you when we're ready to rebuild!}}

Continue along the way. At the next fork is Elder Shiao:
:As dark as things seem, I must not give up hope. We must not be cowed by the violence of the Yaungol.
:You... have come to help us?

:{{gossip|I'm from the Horde. We're here to save you and rebuild your village.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Tsulan|Someone has come to save us? Perhaps all is not lost...}}

Speak with him again.
