== Description ==
Before, grummles keep hozen from ravaging by bribing with food.

But now the Broketooth hozen south of here have their big magic idols. [[The Ook of Dook]] has trained them to use their idols to get power from sacrifices.

They are using them to kill grummles!

You must destroy these idols!

For every idol, there is a chief. Kill the chief and throw corpse on their altar.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Hozen Idol]]
*{{cost|10|60}}
* 162000 XP

== Progress ==
Hozen are learning that it is most bad fortune to get sacrificed on one's own altar.

== Completion ==
A confident hozen is a dangerous hozen.

Thank you for your help, friend of grummles.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Rabbitsfoot|Look for idols south of here at the Deeper and Camp Broketooth.}}
Pick up [[No Pack Left Behind]] and [[Breaking Brooketooth]] before heading out.

Due south is the mouth of the [[Deeper]] cave system. Start killing hozen and looking for grummle corpses. Just outside of the Deeper is {{NPC||Hateful Ko Ko}} and his altar. Kill him and loot the [[Corpse of Ko Ko]], then place it on his altar. Enter the Deeper to find {{NPC||Dak Dak}}. Loot the [[Corpse of Dak Dak]] and place it on his altar in the center of the big room on the lower level. Exit the cave system and head east to reach [[Camp Broketooth]]. {{NPC||Tak Tak}} is out on the surface at the back of the camp to the southeast. Put the [[Corpse of Tak Tak]] on his altar, then wrap up the other quests before heading back.

On return:
:{{text|say|Brother Rabbitsfoot|Ha ha! Here comes the luckydo! I saw the idols explode from here.}}
