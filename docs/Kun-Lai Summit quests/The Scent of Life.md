==Objectives==
[[File:The Scent of Life - Booty Barrel.jpg|thumb|South Seas Booty Barrel]]
Gather an Opalescent Blue Crab Shell and 8 Stolen Pandaren Spices.
*[[Opalescent Blue Crab Shell]]
*[[Stolen Pandaren Spices]] (8)

==Description==
Many have perished here. We will need to honor them properly, which means gathering the makings of incense of life.

It doesn't just smell nice - it has restorative properties, and can even help plants grow. Maybe I can get a whiff of the ingredients to get me back on my feet.

The materials can be found on creatures around here - except for the spices, which were stolen by the mercenaries who pillaged the village.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are those the ingredients for Incense of Life I smell on you? Or... perhaps you haven't bathed recently.

==Completion==
Beautiful, beautiful. Better to not need to bury our friends, but if we must, it is good they will have a fitting ceremony.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Justice (quest)]] and [[By the Falls, For the Fallen]] before heading out.

Exit the village to the south and circle to the northeast. Start killing [[Azure Prickly Crawler]]s for the shell, [[Blackmane Brigand]]s, [[Blackmane Tracker]]s, and [[Blackmane Pillager]]s for Justice and a chance at the spices. [[South Sea Booty Barrel]]s are all over the area near pirates. Then find [[Captain Ripflesh]] in the depression south of the pirate camp. He is a [[gnoll]] who acts as a hunter with Concussive Shot, Black Arrow, and Explosive Shot. He also has:

At 50% health:

:''Ripflesh is hiding in one of the four barrels, and {{NPC||Gnoll Decoy}}s are sitting on the other three.''
Break one of the decoys:

Focus on him and finish him off:

He drops the [[Crumpled Bill of Sale]]:

Head to the southwest to find waterfalls, with [[Lightfooted Snapclaw]]s striding the water. Polished stones can be found underneath the waterfalls—several of which can be found uphill near the village.
