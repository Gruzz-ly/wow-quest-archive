==Objectives==
Rescue Brother Yakshoe.
*Rescue the [[Brother Yakshoe]] {{co|50.5|64.2|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
While you were gone, I saw a group of grummles coming down the Burlap Trail. It was led by my Brother Yakshoe.

But then the Silverbacks attacked. They took my brother and his grummles north.

Please, <name>! Save my brother. He always has bad fortune and no luck, but he is my brother. Look for him at the altar in front of [[Knucklethump Hole]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10x [[Grummlecake]] and {{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good fortune for me to be saved by a luckydo like you.

And Brother Rabbitsfoot always say I not have good fortune. Bah!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Rabbitsfoot|Hurry north! Find my Brother Yakshoe before the hozen do something bad to him.}}
Head north to Knucklethump Hole. Mok Mok is holding Yakshoe over his head, about to place him on the altar in front of him.
