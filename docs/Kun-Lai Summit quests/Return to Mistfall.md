==Objectives==
Return to [[Stormspeaker Qian]] in the [[Silent Sanctuary]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

==Description==
We have done all we can here. We know how much the mogu are a clear threat.

The forge is in great danger of falling into their hands if we lose our hold on the Vale.

Let us return to [[Mistfall Village|Mistfall]] and report to the [[Rajani]]. They will want to know what we are up against.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +1,000 reputation with [[Rajani]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (1,500 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
So the other clans seek to invade the Vale with their armies?

We will show them what true might looks like.
