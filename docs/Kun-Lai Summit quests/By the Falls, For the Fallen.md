==Objectives==
[[File:Waterfall-Polished Stone.jpg|thumb|Waterfall-Polished Stone]]
Gather 3 Waterfall-polished Stones.
*[[Waterfall-Polished Stone]] (3)

==Description==
I do not wish to dishonor my friends and leave them in unmarked graves.

Yet, we have never needed to bury so many at once, and I am in no condition to gather materials.

Please, visit the lakes that hug the mountains edge along the road to the south. Underneath the waterfalls there, you will find stones that have been polished to a sheen by the falling water. They will make suitable headstones.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The stones - have you brought them?

==Completion==
Good. Thank you. After this, I cannot imagine leaving my fellows to less than a proper burial.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Justice (quest)]] and [[The Scent of Life]] before heading out.

Exit the village to the south and circle to the northeast. Start killing [[Azure Prickly Crawler]]s for the shell, [[Blackmane Brigand]]s, [[Blackmane Tracker]]s, and [[Blackmane Pillager]]s for Justice and a chance at the spices. [[South Sea Booty Barrel]]s are all over the area near pirates. Then find [[Captain Ripflesh]] in the depression south of the pirate camp. He is a [[gnoll]] who acts as a hunter with Concussive Shot, Black Arrow, and Explosive Shot. He also has:

At 50% health:

:''Ripflesh is hiding in one of the four barrels, and [[Gnoll Decoy]]s are sitting on the other three.''
Break one of the decoys:

Focus on him and finish him off:

He drops the [[Crumpled Bill of Sale]]:

Head to the southwest to find waterfalls, with [[Lightfooted Snapclaw]]s striding the water. Polished stones can be found underneath the waterfalls—several of which can be found uphill near the village.
