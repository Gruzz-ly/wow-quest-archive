==Objectives==
Defeat the Echo of Warlord Zaela at the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun Lai Summit]].
*[[Echo of Warlord Zaela]] slain

==Description==
[[Warlord Zaela]]... another name that stains the tongue just to speak it...

She was instrumental in freeing [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] during his trial when she and her [[Dragonmaw clan]] attacked the Temple of the White Tiger.

I am ashamed to say that the dragon [[Kairozdormu]] was also involved. We will speak of this no more.

The temple in Kun Lai Summit is our next destination.

==Progress==
Some of my kin invite shame upon our name.

==Completion==
Let us leave this place before it arouses my anger.

==Notes==
Travel to the Temple of the White Tiger where Anachronos is waiting in the main chamber by the [[Time Rift (Kun-Lai Summit)|Time Rift]]:
