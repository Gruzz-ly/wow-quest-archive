*Zandalari forces slain (12)

==Description==
Prophet Khar'zul is a powerful caster, but he is also underestimating your abilities.

==Progress==
Is Khar'zul dead?

==Completion==
These events should be learned from, <name>.

It is most important that we learn from our history. Had we paid attention to the histories, we may have been able to head this off before it got this far.

Everything that has happened was already foretold, we just didn't know how to read it.

==Notes==
[[Mishi]], immediately outside the doorway from Lorewalker Cho, offers a free ride to the island:
:<Mishi is puzzled by your actions.>
:{{gossip|I'm ready to leave.}}

Mishi will drop adventurers off at the southern end of the Isle of Reckoning.{{co|76.5|19.4|Kun-Lai Summit}} Aside from the numerous troll enemies, there are three Zandalari Voodoo Cauldrons on the island with quite different effects, each bathed in columns of colored light.

*The blue cauldron - on the east side of the island, a ways north from Mishi's landing point - grants Voodoo Brew, a buff that turns the trolls neutral to the player for 5 minutes. It does not break in combat, or when shapeshifting, mounted, or nearly any other activity, so players may leave it on for the remainder of the quest. It can be refreshed if necessary. If a player /dances with a Gurubashi Witch Doctor, the mob will dance too, and reply:
::{{text|say|Gurubashi Witch Doctor|I be jammon wit' you, <name>!}}
* The red cauldron immediately northwest of the landing site increases mastery by 100 for one hour.
* The pink cauldron in the center of the island spawns a number of short-lived maggot critters under players, as well as debuffing them with Maggot Slurry, turning them purple and causing retching for 2 minutes.
* The green cauldron to the northwest of the island grants your attacks a chance to hex your target,

All cauldron effects disappear once a character reaches the top of the steps to Prophet Khar'zul, or otherwise leaves the Isle of Reckoning [[subzone]].

{{NPC||Prophet Khar'zul}} is still situated behind the altar at the isle's northern end, [[Thunder's Call]]. He is a level 87 [[Zandalari troll]] with 1,075,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Shadow Fog|range=40|Inflicts Shadow damage.|notes=Instant. Purple area of affect on the ground surrounding the altar.}}
*{{abilities|Spirit Assault|range=40|Assaults the spirit of target enemy, inflicting Shadow damage.|notes=2 sec cast. Hits for 5582 Shadow.}}
*{{abilities|Crow Storm|range=40|Channels a tumultuous storm of crows to surround his enemy!|notes=Channeled. 15 sec duration. Interruptible. Triggers every sec...}}
**{{abilities|Crow Storm|range=40|Inflicts Shadow damage.|notes=Instant. Hits for 15,919 Shadow.}}

When combat begins:
:{{text|say|Prophet Khar'zul|Da Thunder King lives! Our empires be united once more...}}

He will immediately turn on the Shadow Fog, which is telegraphed by a boss emote:
:{{text|bossemote|Stand on an elevated surface to avoid the Shadow Fog!}}

Standing on the altar in front of him will avoid the fog, but cause him to wind up a Crow Storm.
:{{text|say|Prophet Khar'zul|Feed you to da crows!}}

This turns off the Shadow Fog, so players can move out of the area. When he finishes Crow Storm, the Shadow Fog turns back on, he will chain cast Spirit Assault for a while, then repeat the cycle until killed.

At 50%:
:{{text|say|Prophet Khar'zul|We NEED dis land! Da cataclysm destroyed our home!}}

At 10%:
:{{text|say|Prophet Khar'zul|Dis only just begun... we ain't gonna jes... roll over and die...}}

Mishi relocates to the base of the steps once the Prophet is dead, and offers a lift back to [[North Wind Tavern]] in [[Zouchin Village]]:
:<Mishi looks at you with concern.>
