==Objectives==
Bring the Muskpaw Keepsake to [[Lao Muskpaw]].
*[[Muskpaw's Keepsake]] (provided)

==Description==
This well worn trinket has several markings on it confessing love and adoration from the late Mrs. Muskpaw.

Perhaps Lao would like his wife's trinket back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Oh, and what have you there?

==Completion==
Ya never know how much you can lose until you've lost it. My wife passed a few seasons ago, but I can tell you this is a day when I could use her smile the most.

At least she doesn't have to see what these yaungol did to [[Muskpaw Ranch|her beloved ranch]].

==Notes==
Killing [[yaungol]] for [[Yakity Yak]], a [[Burilgi Despoiler]] will drop [[Muskpaw's Keepsake]], starting this quest. Quickly turn it in when bringing a yak back for [[At the Yak Wash]], to pick up [[The Fearmaster (quest)]], killing the epynonymous yaungol.
