==Objectives==
Return to Merchant Shi and Wu-Peng at the southeastern shore of [[Inkgill Mere]].
*Reunite [[Wu-Peng]] and [[Merchant Shi]]

==Description==
They survived? My father is alive!

I thought we would all die here in this horrible mere, at the hands of these insane [[Jinyu]].

I will find my way back - meet me back at camp.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My boy! He is alive!

==Completion==
You found him! This is all I have to give, but in finding my son, you have more than earned it.

==Notes==
Up on the north side of the [[Inkgill Mere]] for [[Repossession]], [[Enraged Vengeance]], [[The Waterspeaker's Staff]], [[Free the Dissenters]], and [[My Son...]], find Wu-Peng hiding behind some clams on the northern end of the village.
