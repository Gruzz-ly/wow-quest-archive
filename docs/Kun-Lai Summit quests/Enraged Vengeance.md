==Objectives==
Kill 15 Enraged Inkgill Jinyu.
*Enraged Jinyu slain (15)

==Description==
<The Swordmistress does not look well. There's a darkness to her eyes uncharacteristic of the pandaren.>

I don't think I've ever been as... as furious as now. What betrayal!

I fought them off when they attacked, killed a few here, but [[Merchant Shi]] is too much of a coward to let me go and finish the job!

You, do it for me. Kill them. Kill them all.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are they dead?

==Completion==
It is satisfying to hear that our enemies are dead. Perhaps you can use one of my bodyguard's weapons.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Repossession]], [[My Son...]], [[The Waterspeaker's Staff]], and [[Free the Dissenters]] before heading out.

Cross to the north over the mere to the far side of the village and start hunting for goods and jinyu. Orachi is on the northern shore, and Wu-Peng is on the north side of the north shore hiding behind a big shell. Feel free to instantly turn in My Son... and pick up [[Father and Child Reunion]] from him, as it is not an escort.
