==Objectives==
Find [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] at the [[Tomb of Conquerors]]. Speak to [[Fennie Hornswaggle]] at [[Lion's Landing]] for transportation.
*Find Anduin at the Tomb of Conquerors

==Description==
<Name>! Prince Anduin has somehow slipped his guards again. His control over the light is greatly increasing.

He was last seen heading to [[Kun-Lai Summit]]. He gave our mages the slip around the [[Valley of Emperors]].

Can you find him? He insists on searching for what he claims is a counter to the Divine Bell. Perhaps you can talk some sense into him before he seizes control of your mind and has you dance your way back here.

Talk to Fennie for a ride into the mountains.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
I am glad you made it, my friend. I could really use your help with what is to come. My father would prefer I remain in the safe custody of his legion.

But if there is one thing Pandaria has taught me, is that a few people in the right place at the right time can make a bigger difference than the greatest of armies.

==Notes==
More story time on the kite ride:
:{{gossip|''Take me to the Valley of Emperors.''}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Hey, Admiral Taylor asked me to hitch you a ride up to the Valley o' Emperors.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Lucky fer you, I'm Prince Anduin's best gal.  We're friends, but don't go tellin' Agent Connelly.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|That man's bound ta get all jealous, an I don't want him poppin' a cap inta the royal son.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Anyway, I know right where the Prince is hidin', so I'll take you right to 'im.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Can't say I approve o' the boy roamin' round by himself, but I can understand his thinkin'.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I still cannae believe the Horde stole the Divine Bell, after everything we did to keep it safe in Darnassus.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I heard that Lady Jaina's still in shock about what happened.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|She was ready ta forgive the Horde fer the destruction o' Theramore.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|She was ready to forge a new future for the Kirin Tor, one where the Horde-allied Sunreavers and the Alliance-sided Silver Covenant could work together in peace.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I heard her say it meself - that Dalaran would be a shining example of peace 'tween Alliance an' Horde fer the rest o' the world.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Then the Sunreavers betray her trust and open portals straight ta the Bell from her own city!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Course she's goin' ta feel upset.  Course she's got a right to throw those nasty Sunreavers out o' Dalaran.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Still, I can't help but get an uneasy feelin' that the Horde ain't goin' to take that quietly.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|And now, Garrosh has the Divine Bell.  He could attack us any day!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I hope Anduin's got some plan up his sleeve.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Good luck.}}

Fennie drops the adventurer off just outside the entrance to the [[Tomb of Conquerors]] in the [[Valley of Emperors]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].  Anduin is standing a few yards away.
