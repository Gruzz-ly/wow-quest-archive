==Objectives==
Stop the Spiritbinding Ritual in the [[Tomb of Secrets]].
*Interrupted the Spiritbinding Ritual {{co|53.0|51.4|Kun-Lai Summit}}
*[[The Tongue of Ba-Shon]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Mogu]] have been scattered and sparse in number for many years. The [[Zandalar tribe|Zandalari]] have not arrived with an army either. Their purpose in the valley makes sense now.

With this many restless spirits they can build themselves an army using the guardians buried in each tomb.

The Tomb of Secrets houses elite warriors called the Emperor's Shield. They must not be resurrected! You'll find the tomb on the highest rise to the southwest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*162000 XP

==Progress==
Have you gone to the Tomb of Secrets yet?

==Completion==
The Mogu and the Zandalari intend to resurrect the [[Thunder King]]?!

We cannot let this happen, <name>! The Thunder King will rain destruction on this land with his return.

==Notes==
Exit the [[Tomb of Shadows]] to the southwest and keep running up the stairs to the west. At the top of the stairs, turn left, to the southwest, to enter the [[Tomb of Secrets]]. Inside is [[Nakk'rakas]], a level 88 zandalar troll with 217,000 health.

Interact with him and the encounter begins. He will toss up an immunity shield, then summon three [[Imperial Guard]]s:
:{{text|yell|Nakk'rakas|You can't stop what has begun!}}
:{{text|yell|Nakk'rakas|Can you feel it? Da Thunder is getting closer...}}
:{{text|yell|Nakk'rakas|These guardians are just da beginning!}}
:{{text|yell|Nakk'rakas|Enough! I'll handle you myself!}}
Kill the guards, then his shield drops. Finish him off.
:{{text|yell|Nakk'rakas|My death will not stop da storm that is coming! Da Thunder King will rise!}}

==Progression==
{{Raising the Thunder King}}
