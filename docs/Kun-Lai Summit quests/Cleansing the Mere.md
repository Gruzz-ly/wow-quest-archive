==Objectives==
Point out Pools of Corruption in [[Inkgill Mere]] to [[Waterspeaker Gorai]] to let him know you are ready to defend him while he completes the cleansing ritual.
*[[Pool of Corruption|Pools of Corruption]] Cleansed (6)

==Description==
Pools of the same murky substance that came out of [[Swordmistress Mei|Mei]] emerged in the lake recently.

I will travel into the Mere with you. Point out the pools of corruption that you are ready for me to cleanse.

You will need to deal with whatever comes out and protect me as I complete the ritual.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is the lake cleansed?

==Completion==
The Mere... I can feel the corruption clearing. At least now, this corruption will not spread.

But, there is one more thing we must do.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|Point out the pools of corruption, and I will use my staff to cleanse them. You'll need to defeat the creatures that emerge!}}

Head out on the lake and interact with [[Pool of Corruption|Pools of Corruption]].
*{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|I will begin the ritual. Prepare yourself!}}
*{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|Hopefully this one will not be worse than the last...}}
*{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|Now, friend.  Prepare yourself to defeat whatever emerges!}}

A [[Boiling Rage]], a level 87 sha with 214,000 health, appears. Kill it and move on to the next pool. As Gorai is following the player around, turn in the instant it completes.
