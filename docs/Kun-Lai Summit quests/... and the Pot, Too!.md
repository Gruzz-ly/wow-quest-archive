==Objectives==
Collect 12 Root Vegetables and 1 Cast Iron Pot.
*[[Root Vegetable]] (12)
*[[Cast Iron Pot]] {{co|60.0|88.4|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
Sure, I'm willing to help you guys out. But we need to eat, too! I don't even have a pot to cook in! Let alone ingredients to put in it!

Here's a list of the things that I need. Now get!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Root Veggie Stew]]
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have everything from the list?!

==Completion==
Well there you go. We should be plenty good, now.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Farmhand Freedom]] before heading out.

Each overseer kill frees three slaves, and there are plenty of root vegetables on the ground. Should the [[Wascally Wirmen]] show up, kill it for six vegetables! The Cast Iron Pot is guarded by [[Cookie McYaungol]] inside the burned-out farmhouse near the middle of the farm.
