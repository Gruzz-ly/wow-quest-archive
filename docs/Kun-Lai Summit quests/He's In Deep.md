==Objectives==
[[File:Cousin Goottooth.jpg|thumb|[[Cousin Goottooth]].]]
Meet Connelly in [[Kun-Lai Summit]]. Speak to [[Fennie Hornswaggle]] at [[Lion's Landing]] for transportation.
*Find Connelly in Kun-Lai Summit
*[[Grummle Disguise Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
Agent Connelly has managed to infiltrate Garrosh's camp in Kun-Lai! He's been following their every move.

Connelly requested you specifically to assist him in gathering some vital intelligence.

He sent along a disguise for you. Make sure you put it on before approaching the camp! It will no doubt be heavily guarded.

He insists you will know him when you see him. Something about your keen eye for details...

Go talk to Fennie over there for a drop-off.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|98|50}}
* 23600 XP
* +150 reputation with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
You've arrived just in time. From the intel I've gathered, Garrosh is hot on the trail of some sort of ancient mogu artifact of power.

If we can figure out what he's after, we can stop him from getting it!

We have to act fast to gather as much information as possible.

==Notes==
Taylor will offer this quest upon completion of [[Stirred, Not Shaken]] and reaching 4900/6000 {{rep|friendly}} with [[Operation: Shieldwall]].

Head southwest 50 yards to speak with [[Fennie Hornswaggle]] near the flight master:
:{{gossip|''Take me to Fire Camp Bataar.''}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Oh my. Ye must be the hero that everyone's been tellin' me about.}}
:''The kite nearly drops out of the sky!''
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Oops, how do ye fly one o' these things? Fer light's sake! Ye crummy piece o' whackery, WORK!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Sorry, I'm still gettin' the hang o' things 'round here.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|My older sister, Hilda, told me to expect ye.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|She won't let me go down to the excavation, so I've become somethin' o' a personal assistant and chauffeur.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Anyway, I met that SI:7 agent you brought back outta retirement.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Agent Connelly, ain't it? That man's got some charm... and some nerve! His sweet words made me blush ten ways out of Ironforge!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|He's out in the field now, and waitin' fer ya special.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I'm takin' you close ta a Horde encampment though, so you'd best be on yer guard.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Let Connelly know that Fennie's askin' about him!}}
Fennie's kite drops the adventurer off just outside of [[Fire Camp Bataar]], which has been taken by the Horde! [[Garrosh Hellscream]] is in camp, alongside [[Delia Sunseeker]], a [[Reliquary]] [[blood elf]], a dozen-or-so elite [[Kor'kron Guard (Kun-Lai Summit)|Kor'kron Guards]], [[Nero]], a wolf with truesight, and [[Uncle Greenlint]], a [[grummle]]. Another grummle, [[Cousin Goottooth]], and a yak, [[Reckless Millie]], are looking at the camp from the southeast, right where the kite lands. Get close to the grummle:
:{{text|say|Cousin Goottooth|Pssssst! Hey, over here, it's me, Agent Connelly! Don't blow our disguise!}}
Speak with Goottooth.
