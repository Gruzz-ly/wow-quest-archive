[[File:Tiger Temple Monk.jpg|thumb|[[Tiger Temple Monk]].]]
Hold back at least 10 [[Tiger Temple Monk]]s using the Ten Foot Pole.
*Tiger Temple Monk Repelled (10)

==Description==
Here is a challenge for you: stand in the center of the room and hold off waves of monks using only a ten foot pole.

My record is ten. Can you beat that?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
If there is one thing I've learned here it is that there is always more to learn.

==Completion==
Alright. You win this one. But next time I am sure I will do better.

==Notes==
On accept, a Ten Foot Pole spawns next to Lin. Interact with it. The rest of the NPCs all phase out as the adventurer is rooted to the center of the room. Monks will slowly start spawning at the steps walking toward the center. Merely click on them to repel them once they cross the blue dotted line, which is a 10-foot radius circle centered on the player. Any monks crossing the red dotted line (a 5-foot radius circle centered on the player) will attack and end the trial.
