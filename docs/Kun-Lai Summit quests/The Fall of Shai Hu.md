==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Shai Hu.jpg|Shai Hu|The corrupter of the Inkgill Jinyu. He must die if they are to be redeemed.}}
Defeat Shai Hu. He can be found at the [[Waterspeaker's Sanctuary]], the island in the center of [[Inkgill Mere]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].
*[[Shai Hu]] slain {{co|71.2|82.5|Kun-Lai Summit}}

==Description==
I can hear the voice of the Mere - it has been purified.

But, this chapter in my people's history will never be closed - not until we defeat Shai Hu.

He has retreated to the central island in the Mere, corrupting our holiest of sites.

Beware - he is strong. But, after all we have done, I am confident we will be stronger.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You have assured that this corruption will not spread, and that my people - those who have not been corrupted - will be able to live on and found a new village.

Our history will live on. You have done more for us than we ever could have hoped.

Thank you, friend.

==Notes==
[[Shai Hu]] is in the middle of the island, but the Explosive Hatred on the outside edge of the island respawn nearly instantly. Pull one, run through it, then stop at the stone ring surrounding Shai Hu, finish it off, then aggro the named when ready:
:{{text|yell|Shai Hu|YOUR RAGE! I FEED ON YOUR RAGE!}}

Shai Hu is an elite jinyu with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Sha Eruption|range=45|Summons latent Sha energies from the ground, dealing Shadow damage and knocking enemies high into the air.|notes=5 sec cast. Triggers...}}
**{{abilities|Sha Eruption|Sha energy erupts beneath the target, dealing Shadodw damage and knocking them high into the air.|notes=1 sec cast. Hits for 40,000 Shadow. Cast by the void zone.}}
*{{abilities|Bathed in Rage|Shai Hu is shielded by Sha-Tainted water and immune to damage. The release of an Explosive Hatred's energy removes the shield.|notes=Instant.}}

Littering the area are [[Explosive Hatred]]s, sha with the following ability:
*{{abilities|Exploding Hatred|range=10|Unleashes dark energy, inflicting Shadow damage to all enemies within 8 yards.|notes=Instant.}}

Shai Hu can be damaged normally, up until he pops an immunity shield at 50% health.
:{{text|yell|Shai Hu|YOUR FEEBLE ATTACKS MEAN NOTHING!}}
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|The death of an Explosive Hatred should destroy his shield! Quickly!}}

Kill one to pop the shield:
:{{text|yell|Shai Hu|WHAT IS THIS!? THEIR RAGE... IT BURNS ME...}}

At 25%:
:{{text|yell|Shai Hu|NO! IT CANNOT BE! YOU CANNOT STOP ME!}}

Kill him:
:{{text|say|Shai Hu|I... feel something. Is it... peace?}}
:{{text|yell|Waterspeaker Gorai|He is dead! You have done it!}}
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|Friend, I will return to the refugees. Meet us there, so we can thank you properly.}}

''Complete:''
:{{text|yell|Waterspeaker Gorai|My people, here <he/she> is! The one who gave the Inkgill new life, <name>!}}
:{{text|yell|Inkgill Refugee|All hail, <name>!}} (''7x'')
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|Thank you again, friend. We will remember your name in our people's history.}}
