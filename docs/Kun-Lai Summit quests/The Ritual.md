== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Waterspeaker Gorai}}, and then complete the Ritual.
*Speak to Waterspeaker Gorai to Begin the Ritual
*Dead Inkgill Laid to Rest
*Ritual Complete

== Description ==
From the moment I first rose from the river, I knew I was destined to be Waterspeaker.

I was taught many rituals, and have performed all of them, save one.

There was one, an extremely ancient one, that we were told to call upon if our people ever turned against us.

This must have happened in our people's distant past, because we haven't needed to use it in our village's memory.

I suppose now is the time to do so.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
That... was not what I expected.

== Completion ==
I see now that this ritual rips whatever was controlling the minds of these creatures from them. I now know what we must do.

== Notes ==
Talk to him again:
:As Waterspeaker, I performed many rituals. There is one, though, that I have never performed - to purify mental corruption.
:It is an ancient ritual, one which we have not needed since days of legend, when {{NPC||Shaohao}} walked Pandaria.
:I fear we need it now...
:{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready. Begin the ritual.}}

:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|I've never performed this ritual. I don't know what will happen, exactly.}}
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|It's been passed down from ancient times, but none of our people have needed to use it since then.}}
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|Let us see if this is sufficient to cleanse the corruption from my people's souls.}}
:''Gorai starts channeling a spell over the corpses of the jinyu, but Mei was caught in the area of effect!''
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|It worked! It wo-}}
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|Wh... what is happening? Why is the ritual affecting her?}}
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|What is that?!}}
:''An {{NPC||Explosive Hatred}} appears out of {{NPC||Swordmistress Mei}}.
Kill it.
:{{text|say|Swordmistress Mei|I feel so much calmer. What happened?}}
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|A beast emerged from you when I began the ritual. <Name> slew it!}}
:{{text|say|Swordmistress Mei|I felt a presence, a burning pain and rage in my mind...}}
:{{text|say|Waterspeaker Gorai|That... thing must be what was controlling the villagers. I now know what we must do.}}
