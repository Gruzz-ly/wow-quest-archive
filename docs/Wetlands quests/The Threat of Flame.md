==Objectives==
Kill 8 Rampant Fire Elementals.
*[[Rampant Fire Elemental]] slain (8)

==Description==
Flame has threatened me for far too long... far too long... but it is no longer the little ones, no longer mere gnats...

The fields burn! The hills and highlands scream, <race>, they scream. The elementals brought here consume all life in their wake.

They cannot stand, they cannot stand. Stop them. STOP THEM! Destroy the bringers of flame...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
*2,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
They still consume!  They must be stopped!

==Completion==
Yes... the flames die.  there is peace now.  Peace for the land.

==Notes==
Pick up [[For Peat's Sake]] before leaving the outpost. You can use the Floodlily on [[Rampant Fire Elemental]]s, which turns them into [[Dowsed Fire Elemental]]s.  However, if you do so, they no longer count for kills towards completing [[The Threat of Flame]].
