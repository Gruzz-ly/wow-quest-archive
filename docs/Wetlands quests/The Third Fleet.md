'''The Third Fleet''' is the first quest in [[The Third Fleet quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Obtain Fitzsimmons' Mead from the cellar of the [[Deepwater Tavern|inn]] in [[Menethil Harbor]].
*[[Fitzsimmons' Mead]]

==Description==
I was once First Mate on the [[Wave Mistress]], ship-of-the-line in the [[Kul Tiras]] [[Third Fleet]]. The Doomed Fleet. Doomed, for on its last voyage the fleet was attacked by [[red dragon]]s. Dragons controlled by [[orc]]s!

We didn't stand a chance against that dragonfire...and our fleet was burned and sunk off this here coast. I'm the sole survivor of those poor vessels...

...Bring me my mead, <class>.  It's down in the cellar of the inn.  As far away as I put it from me, I can't go without it in the end.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||7}}
*870 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Oh, I'm so very thirsty!  Won't you buy a drink for this poor, pathetic fool?

==Completion==
Ah! That hits the spot, and loosens the tongue. Thanks, mate!

==Progression==
{{Menethil Harbor}}

==Patch changes==
