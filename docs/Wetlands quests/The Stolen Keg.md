== Objectives ==
Retrieve the Mountaineer's Ale from [[Dun Algaz]].
*[[Mountaineer's Ale]]

== Description ==
You've got to help us, <lad/lass>. We were tasked with escorting a precious cargo to our fellow [[Dwarf|dwarves]]...a keg full of the finest ale you can get out here!

Unfortunately, [[Mountaineer Grugelm|bird-brain]] over here fell asleep on the job! Those blasted [[orc]]s took our keg, and hauled it up into Dun Algaz where they're hiding.

This can't stand! Now, while I stay here and try to convince this idiot that it was his fault, I'd like you to go in there and get our keg back. For [[Khaz Modan]]! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||12}}

== Progress ==
Do you have it? Is the poor thing intact?

== Completion ==
Thank the Makers! It's downright pristine. Those orcs couldn't figure out the tap-lock, it seems...and couldn't hack through the mastercraft work of [[Ironforge]]'s keg-crafters with their crude weapons!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Cleaning Hovel]] to do at the same time.
