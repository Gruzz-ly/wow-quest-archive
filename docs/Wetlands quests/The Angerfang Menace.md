== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Gorfax Angerfang.jpg|Gorfax Angerfang|[[Chieftain|Chief]] of the Angerfang Dragonmaw.}}
Slay Gorfax Angerfang and 16 Dragonmaw Orcs in the [[Angerfang Encampment]].
* [[Gorfax Angerfang]] slain
* [[Angerfang]] Dragonmaw slain (16)

== Description ==
When we hauled up here to get away from the [[raptor]]s, we put ourselves right next to a whole slew of [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] [[orc]]s!

I've heard the stories in [[Menethil Harbor|Menethil]], how the Dragonmaw are even cruder barbarians than other orcs, how they strangle [[black dragon]]s with their bare hands... I don't know how much of it's true, but I know we can't just let 'em sit up here in the hills.

You've got the chops for it, <name>. Head east to the Angerfang Encampment, take care of those orcs, and make sure you get their leader!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

== Progress ==
I'd love to help, <lad/lass> but I'm a [[scholar]], not a fighter.  Killin' raptors is more than enough risk for me!

== Completion ==
Good to see you back in one piece, <name>!  You're quite a piece of work.

I'll be tellin' [[Captain Stoutfist]] how you took care of those orcs!

== Notes ==
Gorfax Angerfang is at the far southeastern side of the encampment.
