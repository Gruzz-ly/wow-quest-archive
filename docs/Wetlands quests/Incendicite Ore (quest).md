==Objectives==
Collect 8 pieces of Incendicite Ore.
*[[Incendicite Ore]] (8)
*[[Spark-Proof Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Thelgen Rock]] over yonder is something of a natural wonder. It's the only known source of Incendicite in the world!

The stuff's rare, highly sought, and ridiculously explosive. Hit it with a steel mining pick and you'll set off a fireworks show that'll put a room full of goblins to shame.

Luckily, I've developed a spark-proof pick for such tasks. I'll loan it to you if you bring me back some incendicite ore, and I'll split you in on the profits, of course. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Stabilized Incendicite Legguards
|Sparkproof Gloves
|Marblebeard's Shrug
|Sparkproof Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Well, you look like you're in one piece.

==Completion==
Glorious! Beautiful stuff, this ore.

Good on you for not droppin' your pick. Last person I sent out let the butt end hit the floor, and that part's not sparkproof.

==Notes==
Before leaving camp, pick up [[Down In Thelgen Rock]] and [[Get Out Of Here, Stalkers]] to do at the same time. Thelgen's Rock is the cave to the northwest with spiders all around the outside. Kill the Leech Stalkers outside. Inside the cave are the Cave Stalkers and Incendicite Ore. Go to the very back of the cave where there is a large pool to find the seismograph.
