==Objectives==
Defend yourself against [[Riosustrasz]]!
*Defend Yourself Against Riosustrasz

==Description==
With that, I fear that you've outlived your usefulness. Don't worry though, I'd not dream of letting your service go unrewarded, so I'm going to bestow the honor of being devoured by me in my true form. It's really quite the honor, warrior.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Please, warrior. Accept my apologies for this mistreatment. You've done us a great service. Not only have you dealt a crushing blow against the black dragonflight, but you've recovered a dangerous weapon that could have been used to dominate all dragonkind.

I assure you, unlike my wayward brother, I pay the debts that are owed to my flight.

==Notes==
As you start the quest, Riosus assumes his true form, [[Riosustrasz]]! He then grabs you and flies up to the top of gates of Grim Batol.

Upon the brink of defeat, Riosustrasz attempts one last gambit and flings both himself and the warrior off the gates. The warrior survives the fall, while the dragon does not.

Korialstrasz flies down a moment later, then turns into Krasus:
