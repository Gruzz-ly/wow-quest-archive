This quest is part of the [[The Third Fleet quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Kill 5 Cursed Sailors and 5 Cursed Marines in The [[Lost Fleet]].
* [[Cursed Sailor]] slain (5)
* [[Cursed Marine]] slain (5)

==Description==
The [[sailor]]s of the [[Lost Fleet|Third Fleet]] are damned, forever cursed to wander these shores in agony.  Fitzsimmons' anguish is tied to us:  so long as we suffer, there can be no rest for him, either.

You must end the suffering of my crewmates' spirits.  Purge their ghosts from this plane, and return to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Curse Lifter's Gloves
|Snellig's Vest
|Gloves of Anguished Cries
|Third Fleet Cloak
|Snellig's Chain Shirt
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||14}}
*1750
* +250 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Be thorough in your task, lest the curse take hold of ye as well.

==Completion==
The cries of the anguished have been stifled... but the source of the curse still lurks.

==Notes==
This quest takes place in and near the two boats off the north-east coast of the Wetlands. Killing the Marines and Sailors should be easy enough, since they populate both boats.
