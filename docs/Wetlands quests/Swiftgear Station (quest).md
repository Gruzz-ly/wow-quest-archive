== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Shilah Slabchisel]] at [[Swiftgear Station]], north of [[Menethil Harbor]].

== Description ==
You've done good work here, <name>.  Askin' you to haul sandbags would be a waste, to be honest:  I'd rather send you along where your skills are needed.

We've got a small outpost up north in the marsh.  [[Fradd Swiftgear|Swiftgear's]] the gnome that built it, but you'll want to talk to [[Shilah Slabchisel]] and help her with [[Ironforge]] matters.

I'll admit, she's a looker... but I wouldn't make the mistake of getting fresh with her!  They don't call their family Slabchisel for nothing.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||8}}

== Completion ==
[[Captain Stoutfist|Stoutfist]] sent you, eh?  He's a good captain, runs his men well.  Just wish he'd stop staring' at my midriff.

Don't let me catch you doin' it either.  We've work to take care of here!
