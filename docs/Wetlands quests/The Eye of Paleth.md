==Objectives==
Bring the Cursed Eye of Paleth to [[Glorin Steelbrow]] at [[Menethil Harbor]] in [[Wetlands]]. 
*[[Cursed Eye of Paleth]] (provided)

==Description==
Opening the chest reveals a blackened orb, pulsing with an eerie light. This must be the foul [[:Eye of Paleth]] that damned these sailors' souls.

Such corruption should be purged.  Perhaps a priest in [[Menethil Harbor]] could help you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Haunted Pauldrons
|Fitzsimmons' Belt
|Steelbrow's Old Robe
|Fitzsimmons' Cinch
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||15}}
*1850 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
How can I help you, <lad/lass>?

==Completion==
The Eye of Paleth?  You say [[First Mate Fitzsimmons|Fitzsimmons]] sent you out?

By the light... not again.  Fitzsimmons is dead, lad.  You're not the first to come to me like this, either.

==Notes==
Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Glorin Steelbrow|The Eye of Paleth was retrieved and cleansed a long time ago, <class>.  We thought the curse lifted.}}
:{{text|say|Glorin Steelbrow|Not a year ago, poor old Fitzsimmons passed away, his body ruined by drink.}}
:{{text|say|Glorin Steelbrow|Ever since, now and then, people claim he's spoken to them and told them to get the eye...}}
:{{text|say|Glorin Steelbrow|Cursed to roam the earth forever... not even poor Fitzsimmons could escape.}}
:{{text|say|Glorin Steelbrow|Don't ask what you actually brought me, <class>.  You're better off forgetting this ever happened.}}

This is largely a reference to the pre-Cataclysm quest chain, wherein the player character DOES bring the cursed eye in [[Cleansing the Eye|to get it cleansed]].
