== Objectives ==
Travel to the Wetlands and speak to Mountaineer Rharen near Dun Algaz.

== Description ==
I'm sure you've seen just how bad the damage to the Loch is by now. The damage spreads further than that, I'm afraid; all that water had to go somewhere, and it went down into the Wetlands.

There's a lot of fine dwarves down there trying to help out, and they need supplies. That's why I sent two of my mountaineers ahead with a cask of ale along the path into the Wetlands.

I haven't heard back from them since they set off down the road to Dun Algaz. Would you mind checking up on them? 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Completion ==
Ah, well met, <class>.

Stormpike sent you? About the keg? Hoo boy...
