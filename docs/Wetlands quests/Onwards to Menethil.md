== Objectives ==
Deliver the Slabchisel Report to [[Captain Stoutfist]] in [[Menethil Harbor]].
*[[Slabchisel Report]] (provided)

== Description ==
This news needs to get to Menethil as soon as possible. I'll send you along on my fastest ram, <name>.

He knows the way, just make sure you're steady in the saddle and hold on tight.

Don't dawdle around the camp. We've got to send word quickly! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Progress ==
Welcome to Menethil, stranger. I hope you've got good news or a stiff drink with you.

== Completion ==
Let's take a look here.

Oh, this is lovely. "Significant geological instabilities"? "Threat of sudden, massive topological destabilization"?

Nice to hear that somethin' bad might happen around here. I guess we'll just pick up our flooded town and fly it off somewhere safe!

Bah!

== Notes ==
When you accept the quest, [[Brisket]] (the ram by the entrance to the camp) becomes rideable.  Once you've mounted Brisket, he will take you (at quite incredible speed) to the bridge leading to Menethil Harbor.
