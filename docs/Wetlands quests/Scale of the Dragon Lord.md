==Objectives==
Speak with [[Riosus]] and form a plan for how to dispose of the [[:Simulacrum of the Dragon Soul]].
*[[Flawless Black Dragonscale]]
*Bathe the Dragonscale in [[Shadowflame]]
*[[Dragontooth Blade]] (provided)

==Description==
<Riosus listens as you recount your tale>

Yes, [[Garek]] had the right of it, this is not the true [[Dragon Soul]]... and thank the [[titan]]s for that. I'd feel no more comfortable with a dimwitted mortal like yourself wielding an artifact that powerful than I would the [[Nefarian|Lord of Blackrock]] himself. Regardless, this is still dangerous and we should see to its disposal. The original Dragon Soul was not easy to destroy. Come, let us speak of options for the disposal of this lesser simulacrum.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
...<!--This is actually what he says, not a placeholder.-->

==Completion==
Good work, <class>. Well, for a mortal in any case. Now, give me the dragon scale. With this we have the tools we need to unlock the simulacrum's secrets and, should it be again turned against us, destroy it.

Oh, you look surprised. Did you think that we'd rush to destroy this gift without fully understanding what its capable of, or how it could be used against our enemies? Fool.

==Notes==
{{stub-section}}
Speak to Riosus about destroying the simulacrum:
{{dialogue|
<Riosus glowers at you.>

{{gossip|How should we go about destroying this artifact?}}}}

Enter {{sod|Blackwing Lair}} and battle {{sod|Nefarian}}. Once his health is below 20%, use the Dragontooth Blade to get the scale, then get hit by Nefarian's Shadowflame Breath.

==Progression==
