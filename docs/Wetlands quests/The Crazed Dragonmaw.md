==Objectives==
Kill 12 Dragonmaw Whelpstealers.
* [[Dragonmaw Whelpstealer]] slain (12)

==Description==
The [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw orcs]] nearby are fast becoming a nuisance. Their suicidal attacks on the grove are merely annoying, though they provide my sentinels with some needed practice.

My scouts, however, have seen them rounding up black dragon whelps in nets. The last thing these lands need is a crude revival of dragon-taming. Strike out to the east, <class>, and cut down the whelpstealers; make sure their folly does not come back to haunt us later. 
 
== Rewards ==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|
| Ring of Bravery | Greenwarden's Gift | Iczelia's Band }}
You will also receive {{cost||18}}

==Progress==
There's many orcs out there, and you haven't been gone long.  Be brave, now.  This world holds far greater dangers you'll have to face someday.

==Completion==
The orcs will know better than to press further west now.  Well done.

==Progression==
{{Greenwarden's Grove and Dun Modr}}
