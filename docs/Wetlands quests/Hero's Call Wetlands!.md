==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Mountaineer Rharen}} at [[Dun Algaz]].

==Description==
By order of his royal highness, {{NPC||King Varian Wrynn}}, all able-bodied citizens of the [[Alliance]] are to report to Mountaineer Rharen at Dun Algaz.

In the wake of [[Shattering|the cataclysm's]] destruction, [[Wetlands]] has become overrun with wild beasts, [[orc]]ish raiders, and savage [[gnoll]]s! To reach the Wetlands, you must travel north from [[Loch Modan]] through the dwarven hold of Dun Algaz.

For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 

==Notes==
