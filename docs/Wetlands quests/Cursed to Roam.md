This quest is part of the [[The Third Fleet quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Talk to the [[ghost]] of [[First Mate Snellig]].

==Description==
<Bolstered, Fitzsimmons continues his tale...>

I am the sole survivor of the ill-fated [[Lost Fleet|Third Fleet]] of [[Kul Tiras]], wrecked off the coast to the north.  On one of our ships was hidden a great, and terrible treasure, and the eerie power of it keeps the souls of my brothers trapped within the ships' rotting hulls.

I'm haunted by them day and night.  First Mate Snellig calls for me!  He's supposed to be dead!  Please, <name>, look for him near the shipwrecks and just... tell him to leave me alone!

==Completion==
Fitzsimmons sent you, didn't he?  It's been so long...
