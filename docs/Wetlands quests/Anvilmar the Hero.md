== Objectives ==
Talk to {{NPC||Thargas Anvilmar}}. 

== Description ==
You don't want to waste your time talking to me right now, <lad/lass>. Thargas Anvilmar himself is just on the other side of these wagons.

Surely you've heard of him? He fought to defend the [[Thandol Span]] from the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] alongside the [[Varian Wrynn|King of Stormwind]]! He's one of the finest heroes of [[Ironforge]].

Right now though, he's in the thick of it! Go out there and let him know you're ready to help. Just keep a good distance, he swings wide. 

== Completion ==
Well met! If you've got a weapon on you, I'll take any help I can get clearing out these crazed fools! 

==Progression==
