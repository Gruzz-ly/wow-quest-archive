==Objectives==
Speak with Krasus to destroy the [[Simulacrum of the Dragon Soul]] and receive your reward.
*Simulacrum of the Dragon Soul destroyed

==Description==
You've done much to defend our brood, warrior. It seems fitting that we repay you with a gift that you may use to continue to defend others. Speak with me when you are ready and we'll destroy this false Dragon Soul together. I believe that I can harness some of the energy released as the simulacrum's magic dissipates along with a bit of my own magic to create something special for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Suzerain, Defender of the Dragonflights]]

==Progress==
...<!--The actual progress text, not a placeholder-->

==Completion==
I can't say I've ever used magic to craft a shield before but the results are rather impressive, if I could be so vainglorious as to say so myself.

With this, our business is concluded and I must be on my way. Use this well in the defense of those most in need of your protection.

Farewell, mortal.

==Notes==
Talk to Krasus to destroy the simulacrum:
{{dialogue|
You've been of great aid to the red dragonflight, warrior. Thank you.

{{gossip|Let's end this, Krasus.}}}}

:{{text|say|Krasus|Much like the original Dragon Soul, this simulacrum is attuned closely to its creator. We should be able to utilize the scale you retrieved from Nefarian to fracture the talisman and utterly unmake it.}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|Stand back now, as the energies released could be harmful...}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|Ahh, it is done! In much the same way that my apprentice Ronin was able to redirect the release of energy to restore the stolen essence of the dragon aspects when he destroyed the true Dragon Soul, I was able to focus the energy released here into the scale itself.}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|Behold! Suzerain, Defender of the Dragonflights. Use it well, hero!}}
