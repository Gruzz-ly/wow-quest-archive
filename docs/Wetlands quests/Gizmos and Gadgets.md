== Objectives ==
Find 7 Swiftgear Gizmos.
* [[Swiftgear Gizmo]] x7

== Description ==
I've been coming up short on parts recently for my engineering projects, and the other day I finally saw why:  the [[Mosshide Gnoll|Mosshide gnolls]] have been making off with them!

I don't have any idea what they could possibly want them for, but I need those gizmos back.  They're probably strewn all over the marsh by now, but if you see any, could you gather them and bring them back?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

== Progress ==
Did you find them?

== Completion ==
Oh, wonderful!  I'll be able to start reassembling these right away.  Thank you so much!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Mosshide Job]] before leaving camp. Head east. Kill gnolls while picking up the sparkly gizmos lying about.

==Progression==
{{Swiftgear Station}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
