== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Meaty Crawler Claws from Harbor Crawlers.
*[[Meaty Crawler Claw]] (5)

== Description ==
There's a lot to do here, <class>, but we need to keep an eye out for the gifts of fate.

When the flood rolled in, right over our houses, it swept a good number of ocean dwellers with it. Menethil Bay's full of crabs now, large and ripe for the picking.

When life gives you crabs, go crab fishing, I say. Bring me back the largest, meatiest claws you can find and I'll pay you. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||14}}

== Progress ==
Don't bother with the smaller claws, they're more work to shell than the meat's worth.

== Completion ==
A hearty seafood dinner will lift everyone's spirits and help us get the town back in shape again. Thanks for the help, <name>.

== Notes ==
The quest [[A Mother's Worries]] can easily be done at the same time. There are many sharks and crabs in a small space in [[Menethil Bay]], the body of water directly east outside of town.

==Progression==
{{Menethil Harbor}}

== Patch changes ==
