==Objectives==
Take [[Ferilon Leafborn|Ferilon's]] Care Package to [[Longbraid the Grim]] at [[Dun Modr]].
* [[Ferilon's Care Package]] (provided)

==Description==
The dwarves of Dun Modr fight day and night against the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] that have invaded their old home. While we cannot yet send our [[sentinel]]s to risk their lives for them, we do send much needed supplies that they may sustain their vigil.

If you would, bring this package to Longbraid the Grim, north of here. His men must certainly need its contents.

==Reward==
You will receive: {{cost||9}}

== Progress ==
Aye, what've ye got for me?

==Completion==
Supplies from Ferilon?  Bless his heart.

We're good on food, but we're runnin' out of bullets!

==Progression==
{{Greenwarden's Grove and Dun Modr}}
