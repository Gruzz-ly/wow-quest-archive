== Objectives ==
Retrieve the Thelgen Seismic Record from [[Thelgen Rock]].
*[[Thelgen Seismic Record]]

== Description ==
I'm feeling slightly less wobbly now, so I'm going to start setting up the level for my final measurements here. There's one last thing I need from you.

There's a seismograph set up deep within Thelgen Rock to record any movements in the earth. If things have been continuing to shift since the Cataclysm, this'll tell us.

The seismograph's at the very bottom of the cave; find it and bring the record it's created back to me. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||13}}

== Progress ==
Let's see what we've got, aye?

== Completion ==
Wonderful, <lad/lass>. This should be all we need. Let's have a look.

== Notes ==
Before leaving camp, pick up [[Get Out Of Here, Stalkers]] and [[Incendicite Ore]] to do at the same time. Thelgen's Rock is the cave to the northwest with spiders all around the outside. Kill the Leech Stalkers outside. Inside the cave are the Cave Stalkers and Incendicite Ore. Go to the very back of the cave where there is a large pool to find the seismograph.

When you open up the seismograph and take the record, a huge elemental ([[Torrention]]) appears.  He drops a [[Floodsurge Core]], which starts a bonus quest, [[The Floodsurge Core]].

== Trivia ==
The quest's name is likely a reference to the theme song "Down At Fraggle Rock", of Jim Henson's ''Fraggle Rock'' tv show.
