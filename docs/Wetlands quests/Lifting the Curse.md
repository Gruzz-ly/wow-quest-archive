==Objectives==
Get the Intrepid Strongbox Key from [[Captain Halyndor]].

Use the key to open the [[Intrepid's Locked Strongbox]].
* [[Intrepid Strongbox Key]]

==Description==
To break the curse, there must be a reckoning.  Captain Halyndor damned us all to covet a forbidden artifact: the [[:Eye of Paleth]].  His spirit still covets it, standing guard over the strongbox of his old ship, the [[Intrepid]].

Vanquish the soul of the one who cursed us so, <class>.  Defeat the Captain, claim his key, and spirit the Eye of Paleth far from this place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
This chest is securely locked.

==Completion==
The key is rusted but it fits the lock neatly.

==Notes==
This quest takes place in the two wrecked ships off the north-east coast of the Wetlands. The Captain of the Intrepid, who has the key you need, is on the deck of the more northern of the two boats. You can get on the deck without going through the rest of the boat. Once you kill and loot the Captain, if you jump off the west side of the boat and go straight down, you'll see a hole in the hull of the boat. The chest is just inside that hole. Clear the area of Cursed Sailors and Cursed Marines and pick up the loot.

You may suffer the "Curse of the Eye", which increases physical damage taken, but also gives you a ghost costume and allows you to breath underwater.
