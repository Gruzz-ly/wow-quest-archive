==Objectives==
Kill 10 Mouldering Mirebeasts.
*[[Mouldering Mirebeast]] slain (10)

==Description==
The mirebeasts to the west are not my brethren... they are symptoms of the earth's disturbance, a foulness of rot given form.

You would not understand... they take the shape of my kind, infested within with decaying spores, forcing out flourished life in the swamp. They take all and leave only rot. Nothing left, nothing left!

Soothe my mind, <race>. Slay the mirebeasts, cleanse the land, and perhaps my mind will settle. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
*2,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
They aren't gone... I can still FEEL them...

==Completion==
Ahhh... yes.  The swamp suffers less now.

More threats, though.  More lurk.  I can see them!

==Progression==
