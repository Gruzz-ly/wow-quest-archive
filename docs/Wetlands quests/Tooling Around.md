== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Archaeologist's Tools
* [[Archaeologist's Tools]] (6)

== Description ==
I'm in charge of supplying this dig.  It's not that bad, but having to pick up and move out so fast wasn't exactly ideal!

Archaeologists need tools, you know.  You can't run around pulling up priceless antiquities with your bare hands.  If you're going back to the dig site, can you bring back the tools that got left behind?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Antique Breastplate
|Unbared Leggings
|Rockweaver Leggings
|Reconstructed Sword
|Unbared Greaves
|Fresh-Haft Axe
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

== Progress ==
Are they all here?  We left a lot back there.

== Completion ==
That's a relief!  Maybe we can dig our way out of the hole we're still in, eh?

No, nevermind, just a bad joke.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[When Archaeology Attacks]] and [[Strike the Earth!]] before leaving camp. Exit west down the path and make a left at the bottom to enter the excavation site. Kill earth elementals and kill and loot living fossils while collecting sparkly toolboxes off the ground.

==Progression==
{{Swiftgear Station}}
