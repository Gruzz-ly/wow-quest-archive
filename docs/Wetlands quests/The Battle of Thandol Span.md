== Objectives ==
Defeat Calamoth Ashbeard at the [[Thandol Span]].
*{{NPC||Calamoth Ashbeard}} slain

== Description ==
I've defended the Thandol Span from being destroyed before, against the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] themselves. And so did my father, and his father before him...

The only Dark Iron that managed to give me the slip ran straight for the bridge. Something's amiss, and I'm betting when we get there we'll be waltzing right into an ugly trap.

I could use your help, <name>, for Ironforge. Are you with me? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Khaz Modan Pauldrons
|Khaz Modan Spaulders
|Khaz Modan Shoulderguards
|Khaz Modan Mantle
|Khaz Modan Monnions
|Khaz Modan Pauldrons (mail)
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

== Progress ==
There's no time to waste!  Hurry to the Thandol Span!

== Completion ==
And good riddance!

Thandol Span's safe thanks to you, <name>, and hopefully Calamoth is down for good this time. 

== Notes ==
This fight is a denouement of the [[Wetlands]] zone, reprising all of the villains you slew and many of the NPCs you aided.

:When you arrive at the Thandol Span, a blue cloud of flame appears, blocking your path.  Shortly, Calamoth Ashbeard, arrives in another cloud of blue smoke, accompanied by [[Yorla Darksnare]], [[Horghast Flarecrazed]], [[Drungeld Glowerglare]] and [[Balgaras the Foul]].
