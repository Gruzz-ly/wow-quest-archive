== Objectives ==
Search for the [[:Menethil Statuette]]. 

== Description ==
You thoroughly search this cluster of [[Murloc]] hovels, and find no trace of the Menethil Statuette.

Perhaps one of the two nearby hovels to the north and northeast will have more clues. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* {{cost||7|}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
* 10 [[Dwarven Mild]]

== Completion ==
This barrel is largely untouched.  Prying it open...

...you are assaulted by the pungent odor of cheese.  It's a little wet, but still tasty! 

==Progression==
{{Menethil Harbor}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=New version of quest for Cataclysm.}}
