== Objectives ==
Collect 20 Fossilized Bones from [[Living Fossil]]s.
* [[Fossilized Bone]] (20)

== Description ==
Listen, <lad/lass>, any good archaeologists know the risks that come with the job.  If you don't unearth an ancient evil or get cursed by wicked spirits at least once in your career, you're not digging up anything worthwhile!

No, the real archaeologists know that a little thing like fossilized bones reanimating into skeletal creatures is no reason to stop working.

I still need those fossil bones.  Collect 'em from the fossil monsters roaming around and bring them back to me, and I'll reward you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

== Progress ==
Don't be coy about it, now!  Bring back a good armful of 'em!

== Completion ==
See?  Not bad, eh?  Why, I almost wish all my finds decided to dig themselves up for me.  It'd make my job a lot easier!

Of course, you made it easier too, <name>.  Much obliged.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Tooling Around]] and [[Strike the Earth!]] before leaving camp. Exit west down the path and make a left at the bottom to enter the excavation site. Kill earth elementals and kill and loot living fossils while collecting sparkly toolboxes off the ground.
