== Objectives ==
Kill [[Drungeld Glowerglare]] and take his beard.
*[[Glowerglare's Beard]]

== Description ==
The [[Dark Iron clan]] is up to no good out here. And if that surprises you, you're thicker than the addled blotters over in that tent. [[Muradin Bronzebeard|Muradin]] may pay lip service to those sooty cretins back in [[Ironforge]], but out here all bets are off.

We had a raid against the camp last night, and one raid is too many. Their leader's a stout fellow by the name of Glowerglare, and he's hiding in the cave on the south bank of the river.

Bring me Glowerglare's beard as proof he's no longer a threat to us and Ironforge. 

("Drungeld Glowerglare:  Get his beard.  That's right, his beard.")
