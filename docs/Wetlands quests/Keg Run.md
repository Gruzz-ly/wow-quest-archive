== Objectives ==
Deliver the Mountaineer's Ale to [[Forba Slabchisel]] at [[Slabchisel's Survey]].
*[[Mountaineer's Ale]] ''(provided)''

== Description ==
Alright. We need to get this ale to where it's going right away!

[[Ironforge]] has sent out an expedition of surveyors to check the damage done to the [[wetlands]] when the [[Stonewrought Dam|dam]] burst. Forba Slabchisel's the one leading it...and believe me, you don't want to get on her bad side!

Showing up with an armful of ale will help with that. Go and take this ahead to her, and she might even ask you to stick around for some work. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Progress ==
Aye? What've you got for me there?

== Completion ==
Hah! Nice to see those addlebrained mountaineers knew to hand the ale off to a real <man/woman> to get the job done.

Welcome to my survey. If you're of the mind to help Ironforge by takin' over the jobs of some useless, lazy sods that call themselves dwarves, you're in the right place!
