== Objectives ==
Obtain [[Trapper's Key]]s from [[Dark Iron Trapper]]s and use them to free 6 Gnolls from the [[Gnoll Cage]]s.
* Gnolls Freed (6)

== Description ==
I know we were just attacking the gnolls ourselves, but I'm not about to let the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] capture them as slaves. For one, we found the thieves and took back what was missing, so justice is served; for another, whatever work the Dark Iron will be putting them to isn't something I want to allow.

Either way, the gnolls need to be freed. The trappers should have keys on them, so use those to open the cages. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

== Progress ==
Be sure you free enough.  I want to make sure a wrench gets thrown in the Dark Iron's plan.

== Completion ==
That should do it!  The more gnolls those fools have to chase after, the easier it'll be to keep them in line.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dark Iron Trappers]] before leaving camp. Due east from [[Swiftgear Station]] you will run across a camp of Mosshide gnolls battling Dark Iron Trappers.  If you go further east, you will find camps that have the [[Gnoll Cage]]s (in sets of 3), and Dark Iron Trappers without gnolls battling them.  You may prefer to fight the trappers without the accompanying gnolls, as the gnolls will turn on you once the trapper they are battling is dead.
