==Objectives==
Collect Gobbler's Head from [[Gobbler]] and slay 12 Bluegill [[Murloc]]s of any kind.
*[[Bluegill Murloc]] slain (12)
*[[Gobbler's Head]]

==Description==
{{Questportrait|image=Gobbler.jpg|name=Gobbler|text=He'll trouble us no more.}}
Murlocs are crawling out from the deep waters and building their villages on the coastline.  They are harassing our fishers and merchants and must be stopped.

One of these murlocs, Gobbler, skulks with the other [[Bluegill tribe|bluegill murlocs]] and harries merchants along the road, always then retreating to the safety of the nearby murloc hovels.  Our merchants are in jeopardy, and we will pay to secure them.

Gobbler prowls the river inlet north of here.  Find him, slay his kin, and bring me his head.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Merchant Marine Pauldrons

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Our merchants will not be safe until we are rid of Gobbler and those Murlocs.

==Completion==
Ah, well done <name>.

Accept this payment for fullfillment of your contract with the [[Merchant Marines]].
