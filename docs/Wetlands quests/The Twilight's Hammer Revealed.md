== Objectives ==
Kill 12 [[Twilight's Hammer]] members in [[Dun Modr]]. 
*{{NPC||Twilight Convert}} slain (12)

== Description ==
I and everyone else thought these fools were just [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] up to no good, but these nutters are fullblown cultists!

The Twilight's Hammer wants nothing short of the destruction of the entire world. They've thrown their lot in with [[Deathwing]] and [[Ragnaros]], and they've got a history with the Dark Iron.

But it doesn't matter who they are, what matters is they're in Dun Modr and they need to get out! I'll not let any past here. You get in there and crack some skulls!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

== Progress ==
I've got to hold the line here, <lad/lass>.  As much as I want to get in there and tear them up, I'm dead set on making sure not a one of the slimy curs escapes!

== Completion ==
Good show, <lad/lass>, but we've no time to celebrate. [[Thandol Span]]'s in danger!

==Progression==
{{Greenwarden's Grove and Dun Modr}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
