== Objectives ==
Search the crates and barrels at the coastal Murloc camps.
 
== Description ==
Not long ago a merchant vessel, the [[Blind Princess]], was raided by Murlocs. Although the ship escaped intact, much of its cargo was dragged overboard by the creatures, including a very valuable statuette of [[Terenas Menethil]]. We want that statuette recovered.

Search the coastal Murloc hovels for crates, barrels and other evidence of lost cargo. Find the [[Menethil Statuette]] and return it to me.
 
== Rewards ==
* [[Healing Potion]] x5

== Completion ==
This crate is covered with clawed scratches, and the marks of water damage. &nbsp;Prying it open reveals soggy and rotted straw, as if something of value was stored in the crate. &nbsp;You search through the straw...

...and find an armload of red-colored bottles. 

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Claws from the Deep]] before leaving. The murlocs can be killed while hunting down the statuette.
