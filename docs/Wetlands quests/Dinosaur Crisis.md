== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Highland Raptors of any kind.
* Highland Raptors slain (8)

== Description ==
We've been getting more and more reports of raptor attacks in the area.  I'm seeing to it that this place is safe enough for more settlement to start occurring, so I've put a bounty on the buggers.

A lot have been cleared out already, but the Highland Raptors to the north have been growing in number.  That won't be true for long, now will it?

Clear out a good deal of Highland raptors, and I'll have a nice reward for you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Swiftgear Belt
|Highland Shoulderguards
|Shilah's Bracers
|Highland Chain Shoulders
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

== Progress ==
Don't be shy with those now.  They're dastardly things.

== Completion ==
A job well done.  Consider this reward not from me, but from [[Ironforge]]:  the preservation of [[Khaz Modan]] is a matter that concerns every dwarf.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Crocolisk Hides]] and [[I'll Call Him Bitey]] before leaving camp. Head northeast. Kill raptors and find eggs in the raptor nests while killing and looting crocolisks along the way.

==Progression==
{{Swiftgear Station}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Highland Chain Shoulders]] added as a reward.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
