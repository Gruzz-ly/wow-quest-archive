== Objectives ==
Slay [[Horrorjaw]] and collect Horrorjaw's Hide.
* [[Horrorjaw's Hide]]

== Description ==
I've been tempted to go after the big kill... the largest crocolisk out there, [[Horrorjaw]].  His hide alone would be enough to get my family out of this hole.

But I'm no fool.  One mistake and I could lose a leg, or my life, and then where would my wife and kids be?  Still homeless and without a father to care for them.

It's not my proudest moment, but I'll pick my family's safety over pride any day.  Please, <class>... hunt Horrorjaw for me.  You'll find him in his shady pool to the north, lurking.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||8}}

== Progress ==
Did you get it?  Do you have Horrorjaw's hide?

== Completion ==
Amazing!  You're a true hero, <name>.  I'll never forget what you've done for me and my family.

I know it's not much, but please, take this with my blessing.
