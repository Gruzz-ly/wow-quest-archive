== Objectives ==
Kill 10 [[Dark Iron Trapper]]s.
* Dark Iron trapper slain (10)

== Description ==
You may have seen them while you were out, but the [[Dark Iron clan]] has been spotted in this area.  They're never up to any good, and it looks like they've kidnapped the [[Mosshide Gnoll|Mosshide gnolls]] for some reason.

I don't know what their game is, but we're putting a stop to this before more foul play occurs.  Go and stop them.

And if you're worried about fairness, try askin' them politely first and see how far that gets you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

== Progress ==
I don't think you've been out there long enough.  I can still hear that ruckus from the camp!

== Completion ==
I don't suppose they agreed to come along quietly?  Didn't think so.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Gnoll Escape]] before leaving camp. Due east from [[Swiftgear Station]] you will run across a camp of Mosshide gnolls battling Dark Iron Trappers.  If you go further east, you will find camps that have the [[Gnoll Cage]]s (in sets of 3), and Dark Iron Trappers without gnolls battling them.  You may prefer to fight the trappers without the accompanying gnolls, as the gnolls will turn on you once the trapper they are battling is dead.
