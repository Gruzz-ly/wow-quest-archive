# Wetlands storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Wetlands.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Wetlands]] storyline''' takes place after the [[Loch Modan storyline]] for level 20-25 Alliance players, typically dwarves and gnomes. It begins in [[Dun Algaz]] near the border with [[Dun Morogh]] and proceeds to [[Slabchisel's Survey]] where [[Forba Slabchisel]] will provide transportation all the way to [[Menethil Harbor]]. From there the quests progress to the newly upgraded [[Swiftgear Station]] along the coast to [[Whelgar's Retreat]], [[Greenwarden's Grove]] and finally [[Dun Modr]] along the [[Thandol Span]]. The last quests in the zone bring the player into the [[Arathi Highlands]].

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Wetlands Quests]].

After the Wetlands comes the [[Arathi Highlands storyline]].
