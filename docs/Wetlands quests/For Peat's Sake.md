==Objectives==
Use the [[:Blessed Floodlily]] to extinguish 7 Marsh Fires.
* [[Marsh Fire]] Extinguished (7)
* [[Blessed Floodlily]] (provided)

==Description==
The elementals rampaging across [[Direforge Hill]] are setting the very land beneath them ablaze. In a marsh such as this, fire can find many places to smoulder through the deep moss and peat.

You must quench the fires before they spread further. Take this flower... blessed by nature's rain, it will let you douse the fires.

The blossom may also prove useful against the elementals themselves. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Marsh Fire Legguards
|Deep Moss Bracers
|Soothing Hands
|Floodlily Robes
|Deep Moss Bindings
|Soothing Wraps
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
It is vital you extinguish as many fires as you can, <name>.

==Completion==
In sparing the land further suffering you've also helped us soothe the greenwarden.

Many thanks, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Threat of Flame]] before leaving the outpost. You can use the Floodlily on [[Rampant Fire Elemental]]s, which turns them into [[Dowsed Fire Elemental]]s.  However, if you do so, they no longer count for kills towards completing [[The Threat of Flame]].

==Progression==
{{Greenwarden's Grove and Dun Modr}}
