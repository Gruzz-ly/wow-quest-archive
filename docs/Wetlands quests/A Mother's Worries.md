== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Harbor Shredfins.
*[[Harbor Shredfin]] slain (10)

== Description ==
My son Gimlok's the light of my life. It warms my heart to see him playin' with the other children.

I can't help but worry, though. There's sharks not but a few feet away in the bay. If it's deep enough for one to swim its way here...

I can't bear it! Please, you're clearly one <race> that's seen tougher situations than us townsfolk. Would you get rid of those nasty sharks for me? At least a few? 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||14}}

== Progress ==
Oh goodness... the sharks...

== Completion ==
Oh, bless your heart, to do such a thing for a married woman like me. You're too kind.

== Notes ==
The quest [[When Life Gives You Crabs]] can easily be done at the same time. There are many sharks and crabs in a small space in [[Menethil Bay]], the body of water directly east outside of town.

==Progression==
{{Menethil Harbor}}
