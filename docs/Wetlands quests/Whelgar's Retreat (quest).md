== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Prospector Whelgar]] at [[Whelgar's Retreat]], southeast of [[Swiftgear Station]].

== Description ==
Prospector Whelgar's been leading an excavation in the mountains southeast of here for quite some time.  He had some [[Ormer's Revenge|raptor problems]] back in the day, but things were going better recently.

Just the other day, we got word he had to evacuate the entire digsite again.  I'm not sure what's going on there, but I can't imagine the [[Shattering|cataclysm]] making a quarry any safer than it was before.

There's good [[dwarf|dwarves]] working there, <name>.  Would you go see what's wrong there, and maybe lend a hand?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Completion ==
Well met, <class>.  We've got raptor problems for sure... sort of.

More like the entire dig site deciding to attack us.  I've never seen rocks and fossils get so upset.

==Progression==
{{Swiftgear Station}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
