==Objectives==
Collect 8 Flood Sediment Samples.
*[[Flood Sediment Sample]] (8)

==Description==
The destruction of the [[Stonewrought Dam]] was no small thing, <lad/lass>. We're here to find out just how bad the damage is. A mighty load of water's rampaged through here, and if it's disturbed the earth too far, we could be in for worse later on.

We can tell a lot from studying the sediment of the flooded area. I need as many soil samples as I can get, so if you could head out there and collect some more, I'd much appreciate it. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Drunkard's Belt
|Topsoil Bracers
|Discolored Bracers
|Topsoil Binders
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Let's see the sediment, then.

==Completion==
Ah, well. The good news is, these will do perfectly. The bad news is I can tell they're the wrong color for topsoil here, even drunk as I am.

That means things aren't looking good for the area, <name>. But we've got more tests to run before we hang up the towel.

==Notes==
Before leaving camp, pick up [[Fight the Flood]] and [[Thresh Out of Luck]] to do at the same time. Go into the water east and north of camp. Kill elementals and threshers while looking for sparkly piles of sediment.
