==Objectives==
Slay Yorla Darksnare.
*[[Yorla Darksnare]] slain

==Description==
{{Questportrait|image=Yorla Darksnare.jpg|name=Yorla Darksnare|text=Go an' get her!}}
I've found out who's pulling the strings on this operation here. Yorla Darksnare is directing the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] from a camp to the east, and it might've been orders to have the [[gnoll]]s steal [[Ironforge Ingot|Ironforge's gold]] in the first place.

What's more, she's a wanted criminal... she's been inciting rebellion and attacks against [[Ironforge]] since [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]] was still alive.

She can't slip through our fingers this time, <name>.  Go and get her!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Old Guard's Hammer
|Shilah's Blade
|Old Guard's Greataxe
|Darksnare Dagger
|Old Guard's Poleaxe
|Old Guard's Bow
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Don't underestimate Yorla.  She's survived this long on wits and skill, and she won't go down without a fight, I'm sure.

==Completion==
A job well done!  You've brought one of Ironforge's most wanted to justice today, <name>.  I'd say you've earned a mighty fine reward.

==Progression==
{{Swiftgear Station}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.3.5|note=[[Old Guard's Bow]] and [[Old Guard's Poleaxe]] added as rewards.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
