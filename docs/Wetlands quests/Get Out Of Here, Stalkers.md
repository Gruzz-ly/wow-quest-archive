== Objectives ==
Kill 7 Cave Stalkers and 7 Leech Stalkers.
*[[Leech Stalker]] slain (7)
*[[Cave Stalker]] slain (7)

== Description ==
[[Thelgen Rock]]'s an important site here. We need to use it to study the bedrock formations an' such.

Of course, it can't be that easy, so Thelgen Rock's also full of giant cave stalkers. Big as a dwarf and twice as hungry. Like I said, these fancy-lads are researchers, not warriors, so if I want them to get anything done you're gonna have to help me clear the filthy bugs out.

Kill as many of the blighters as you can and I'll make it worth your while, <name>. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||13}}

== Progress ==
I can still see the bloody things skitterin' around from over here. Are you plannin' on havin' a picnic with them? Get back out there and kill more!

== Completion ==
Good job. I wouldn't be surprised if the horrid things had eggs in there somewhere, but it'll do for now.

==Notes and trivia==
Before leaving camp, pick up [[Down In Thelgen Rock]] and [[Incendicite Ore (quest)]] to do at the same time. Thelgen's Rock is the cave to the northwest with spiders all around the outside. Kill the Leech Stalkers outside. Inside the cave are the Cave Stalkers and Incendicite Ore. Go to the very back of the cave where there is a large pool to find the seismograph.

The name of the quest is a reference to the game ''{{wplink|S.T.A.L.K.E.R.}}'' and its infamous "Get Out Of Here, Stalker" quote.
