== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Threshadon Chunks from Displaced Threshadons.
*[[Threshadon Chunk]] (8)

== Description ==
The local wildlife's all messed up from the flood, it seems. This fen used to be full of [[crocolisk]]s, but I haven't spotted a single one.

What I have spotted are [[threshadon]]s. Never used to be any here, so the flood must've swept them all right out of [[Loch Modan]].

Lucky for us, because they're tastier than crocolisks, and I'm running low on provisions. Bring me back some Threshadon meat for the camp, and I'll gladly pay you for it. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||12}}

== Progress ==
Are they meaty ones? Let's have a look.

== Notes ==
Before leaving camp, pick up [[Fight the Flood]] and [[Sedimentary, My Dear]] to do at the same time. Go into the water east and north of camp. Kill elementals and threshers while looking for sparkly piles of sediment.

== Completion ==
Lovely. These'll fry up nice, and the camp'll be spared a week of mushroom biscuits.

==Progression==
