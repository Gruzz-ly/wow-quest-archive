==Objectives==
Recover 8 Ironforge Ingots from [[Mosshide tribe|Mosshide Gnolls]].
* [[Ironforge Ingot]] (8)

==Description==
You seem trustworthy enough to help me out with my real problem, <name>. I was sent here by [[Ironforge]] to recover a shipment of gold ingots.

The ingots are part of the [[Ironforge Royal Treasury]], stamped with the royal seal... only an idiot would steal them for profit, far to easy to trace. Oddly enough, this area  is full of idiots: Mosshide gnolls.

I don't know how many gnolls you've fought before, but they're foul and brutal beasts, and dangerous. I need you to slay them and recover the missing ingots.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ingot-Handler Gloves
|Royal Treasury Courier's Shield
|Accountant's Lantern
|Ingot-Handler Grips
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
There should be about eight ingots stolen.

==Completion==
Well done! The [[Ironforge Guard]] appreciates this, <name>. You've done our city a fine favor.

But something new has come up...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Gizmos and Gadgets]] before leaving camp. Head east. Kill gnolls while picking up the sparkly gizmos lying about.

==Progression==
