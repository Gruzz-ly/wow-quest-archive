== Objectives ==
Kill 7 Paleolithic Elementals
* [[Paleolithic Elemental]] slain (7)

== Description ==
In case you didn't notice, the land here in the [[Wetlands]] is pretty messed up.  Floods, earthquakes... and on top of it all, even the ground's got a wild hair now.

I never thought we'd be attacked by our own dig site, but sure enough, big chunks of it are now rampaging around trying to flatten any dwarf they see.

You look like a strong, strapping young <race>... mind going down there and slapping some sense into the clods?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

== Progress ==
What's next, a volcano?

== Completion ==
That's showin' em what for!  Good on you.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Tooling Around]] and [[When Archaeology Attacks]] before leaving camp. Exit west down the path and make a left at the bottom to enter the excavation site. Kill earth elementals and kill and loot living fossils while collecting sparkly toolboxes off the ground.

==Trivia==
This quest's name is a reference to the tagline of the game [http://bay12games.com/dwarves/ Dwarf Fortress].

==Progression==
