==Objectives==
Kill 10 Flood Elementals.
*[[Flood Elemental]] slain (10)

==Description==
I'm here because [[Muradin Bronzebeard|Muradin]] himself knew that this survey needed someone to keep these buffoons on their toes. They're all too scared of the wildlife to do a thing! If I'm to get them off their duffs, I'm going to need some cleanup done.

We've got an [[elemental]] problem, first off. The flood did such a number here that the water itself's gone hysterical.

I bet you've never slapped the sense into an entire lake before, but I'm askin' it of you now. Whallop those elementals but good for me.  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||12}}
*160-1,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Roll up your sleeves, $lad:lass:{{Sic}}, you're gonna have to do better than standin' around gawking if you want a nod around here.

==Completion==
Well I'll be. There's someone around here that isn't a disgrace to [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]], bless his poor gravelly heart.

Just for that, you get first crack at the ale, <lad/lass>. But don't let it get to your bloody head! We've got more gorram work to do, and I won't tolerate you lettin' up early!

==Notes==
Before leaving camp, pick up [[Sedimentary, My Dear]] and [[Thresh Out of Luck]] to do at the same time. Go into the water east and north of camp. Kill elementals and threshers while looking for sparkly piles of sediment.

==Trivia==
"Gorram" is an expletive first used on (and likely invented for) the television series ''[[wikipedia:Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''.
