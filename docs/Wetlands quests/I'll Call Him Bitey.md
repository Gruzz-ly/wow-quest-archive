== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Wobbling Raptor Eggs
* [[Wobbling Raptor Egg]] x6

== Description ==
Have you heard some raptors are intelligent enough to be domesticated?  It's true!  I've seen hunters tame them.

It gets quite lonely out here, you know, even with [[Wenna Silkbeard|Wenna]] to keep me company... a pet's just what I need to brighten my spirits.  A little baby raptor would be the best!

If you're out there slaughtering the adults, would you mind bringing me back some mature eggs?  You can tell if they're ready to hatch by the wobbling.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

== Progress ==
Do you have enough eggs?  I can't take any chances with only one.  Statistics, you know.

== Completion ==
Wonderful!  These should be ready to hatch within the day...

Now I just need to cobble up a raptor pen before they all hatch nigh-simultaneously.  What could go wrong?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dinosaur Crisis]] and [[Crocolisk Hides]] before leaving camp. Head northeast. Kill raptors and find eggs in the raptor nests while killing and looting crocolisks along the way.

==Progression==
