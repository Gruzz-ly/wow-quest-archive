== Objectives ==
Deliver the Floodsurge Core to [[Forba Slabchisel]].
*[[Floodsurge Core]] (provided)

== Description ==
This is all that's left of the [[Torrention|huge elemental]] that attacked you: a frothing orb of water that continues to fight your grip.

[[Forba Slabchisel|Forba]] might appreciate seeing proof that you helped stop another threat to the camp. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Slabchisel Boots
|Waterproof Leggings

|Waterproof Britches
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

== Progress ==
Eh? What's that you've got there?

== Completion ==
The thing's still got some fight in it! Amazing!

You're a tough one, <name>. It's much appreciated. I'd say a reward is in order before you head out.

Keep doin' your best for [[Ironforge]], you hear? And if you ever see [[Shilah Slabchisel|my sister]], say hello for me.

== Notes ==
[[Torrention]] spawns when you open up the seismograph for [[Down In Thelgen Rock]].
