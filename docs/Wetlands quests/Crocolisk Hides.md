== Objectives ==
Collect 10 Marshy Crocolisk Hides from [[Wetlands Crocolisk]]s.
* [[Marshy Crocolisk Hide]] x10

== Description ==
I've skinned croc in the wetlands for years, <class>.  Things have changed though.

You see, not to bore you with a sob story, but when the [[cataclysm]] flooded [[Menethil Harbor]], our home went with it.  My wife and kids don't have a place to stay, and I need to make as much money as I can to get us under a roof again.

I've been skinning crocs 'til I was too tired to move, but I still need more skins to sell.  If you bring me some croc hides, I'll pay you a bit for them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

== Progress ==
Got any croc hides for me?

== Completion ==
I'm much obliged, <class>.  This'll go a ways towards getting my family back on their feet.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dinosaur Crisis]] and [[I'll Call Him Bitey]] before leaving camp. Head northeast. Kill raptors and find eggs in the raptor nests while killing and looting crocolisks along the way.

==Progression==
