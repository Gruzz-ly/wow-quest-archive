==Objectives==
Obtain a Dumpy Level from a [[Silty Oozeling|Silty Ooze]].
*[[Dumpy Level]]

==Description==
Alright, I need you to help me find my dumpy level.

What's that look for? That's right! I said my dumpy level! It's a piece of significant surveying equipment!

I didn't name the bloody thing, alright? Go look it up! All I did was leave it on a rock long enough for one of those horrible oozes to swallow it up. The place is crawling with 'em, but one of them should still have it inside. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||12}}

==Progress==
Did you find the dumpy?

==Completion==
Oh good, it's undamaged! Thanks a lot.

You ah, you might want to wipe yourself off a bit there.

==Trivia==
[[wikipedia:Dumpy level|Dumpy level]] really is the name of the tool.  Also known as an 'automatic level', it is used in surveying to check points in the same horizontal level.
