==Objectives==
Slay 15 [[Southsea Freebooters|Southsea]] pirates at the [[Southsea Holdfast]].
*Southsea pirates slain (15)

==Description==
It's time for a little payback, I think. Can you blame me? After they locked me down in [[Submerged Outhouse|that outhouse]] and left me to drown?!

I'll make it worth your while if you head up to the Southsea Holdfast on the eastern bluffs and exact my revenge.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Paper Roll Bracers|Drag Master's Boots|Outhouse Boots|Payback Band}}

==Progress==
Maybe you could extract just a little more payback on those no-good Southsea pirates?

==Completion==
That'll teach those scurvy dogs! You have my thanks, <name>.

==Notes==
Before heading out, search the ship and pick up all of [[Quiet the Cannons (Alliance)]], [[Where's Wizzle?]], [[Negotiations (Alliance)]] and [[Special Delivery for Brivelthwerp (Alliance)]]. Hop on the river boat and head northeast to the Southsea Holdfast, then start killing pirates to get up top. On the plateau, simply interact with the cannons to take them out. Keep an eye out for Wizzle, who is locked in a cage at {{co|91.6|78.5|Thousand Needles}} north of the middle bunker.

==Progression==
