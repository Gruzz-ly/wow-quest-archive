== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Pao'ka Swiftmountain}} at [[Highperch]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

== Description ==
Thank you for your help, <name>. You should speak with Pao'ka Swiftmountain at Highperch to the southwest.

Perhaps he will know the whereabouts of the {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem||Elder Crone}}?

== Completion ==
I know nothing of the Elder Crone, Magatha. What I do know is that the [[Twilight's Hammer]] is destroying Highperch.

Will you help me to stop them, <class>?

== Notes ==
Get down to the water one way or another, hop on the river boat, and head southwest to reach Highperch. Pao'ka is standing at the entrance.

==Progression==
{{Magatha rising}}
