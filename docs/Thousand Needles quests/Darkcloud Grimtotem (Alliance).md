==Objectives==
Slay 20 [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem tauren]] at [[Darkcloud Pinnacle]].
*Grimtotem on Darkcloud Pinnacle slain (20)

==Description==
There's no way around it. If you want to win a battle, you have to spill some blood. In this case... a lot of it.

You know what we have to do.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Blood Waders|Goddess-Blessed Wristlets|Grimtotem Spaulders|Amulet of Spilling Blood}}

You will also receive: {{cost||55}}

==Progress==
Let's take care of a few more of them while we're here, <name>.

==Completion==
That put a dent in their numbers! Can't say that they didn't deserve it.

==Notes==
Pick up [[No Weapons For You! (Alliance)]] and [[Grimtotem Chiefs: Isha Gloomaxe (Alliance)]] before heading out. Then start killing. The sentinel can more than hold her own, which is great, as the hostiles often come in groups. Immediately outside of Isha's tent is [[The Rattle of Bones]]. Pick it up to start its' eponymous quest, [[The Rattle of Bones (Alliance)]].

Don't focus on killing Grimtotem to the detriment of anything else. There's going to be plenty of time.
