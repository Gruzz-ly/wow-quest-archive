==Notes==
;Approaching Fizzle and Pozzik
:{{Text|Say|Fizzle Brassbolts|This always happens! I look the other way for one minute, and your goons have stolen our explosives!}}
:{{Text|Say|Pozzik|Hey, easy there, bub. I only swiped your bombs because you and your munchkin squad swiped ours first!}}
:{{Text|Say|Fizzle Brassbolts|<Gasp!> I can't believe you would resort to name-calling. On BOAT DAY, of all days.}}

;Approaching Tu-Luak
:{{Text|Say|Tu-Luak|The thoughtless partying of the other races has a drastic effect on this land's environment.}}
:{{Text|Say|Tu-Luak|All of their litter collects in this corner of the lagoon. We cannot abide this affront to nature.}}
:{{Text|Say|Tu-Luak|<Sigh>... I was hoping to play some volleyball, too...}}

;Approaching Theldurin the Lost
:{{Text|Say|Theldurin the Lost|ACH! I can't believe it!}}
:{{Text|Say|Theldurin the Lost|We come all this way to celebrate Boat Day, and ye forgot the dang-blasted ALE!}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Martek the Exiled]]|Sorry.}}
:{{Text|Say|Theldurin the Lost|Hmm... I'll bet those pirates over yonder have some ale on 'em...}}

;Approaching Ilthine
:{{Text|Say|Ilthine Sunsong|Ahoy down there! You sailors want to party?}}
