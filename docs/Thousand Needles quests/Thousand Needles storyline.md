# Thousand Needles storyline

[[File:WorldMap-ThousandNeedles.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

'''[[Thousand Needles]]''' is a level 40-45 zone for both Alliance and Horde in [[Southern Kalimdor]]. Breadcrumbs to the zone come from both [[Feralas]] and [[Dustwallow Marsh]].

The chain starts out with a surprise attack by the [[Grimtotem tribe]]. However, the Grimtotem will have to wait as all of Thousand Needles is underwater after the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]]! Fizzle and Pozzik have hastily had a [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge|speedbarge]] crafted to ride out the flood and are now acting as the center of the rescue effort. Not that much rescuing is happening with the [[Southsea Freebooters]] laying siege, a surprise attack by [[silithid]] and new, untapped resources being made available in [[centaur]] lands...

Once everyone is settled in, or exploited, or killed and resurrected, players are sent to [[Freewind Post]] to reclaim it from the Grimtotem. A strange [[wind serpent]] keeps appearing, though...

After Freewind has been retaken, players are off to find {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem}} herself, who has been captured by the [[Twilight's Hammer]]! A few twists and turns await as players unravel the situation to free Magatha.

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Thousand Needles Quests]].
