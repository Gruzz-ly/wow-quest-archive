== Objectives ==
Slay 20 [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem tauren]] at [[Darkcloud Pinnacle]].
*Grimtotem on Darkcloud Pinnacle slain x20

== Description ==
There is no alternative: if you intend to win a battle, you must spill the enemy's blood. In this case, unfortunately, a lot of it.

You know what we have to do.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Progress ==
Let's take care of a few more of them while we're here, <name>.

== Completion ==
While the [[Earth Mother]] does not condone such violence, we had no choice. The Grimtotem have ignored Her teachings for too long and are reaping what they have sown. 

== Rewards ==
{{cost||55}} and {{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Blood Waders|Bracers of Reluctant Violence|Pauldrons of the Teachings|Reaper's Amulet}}

== Notes ==
Pick up [[No Weapons For You!]] and [[Grimtotem Chiefs: Isha Gloomaxe]] before heading out. Then start killing. The brave can more than hold his own, which is great, as the hostiles often come in groups. Immediately outside of Isha's tent is The Rattle of Bones. Pick it up to start its' eponymous quest, [[The Rattle of Bones]].

Don't focus on killing Grimtotem to the detriment of anything else. There's going to be plenty of time.
