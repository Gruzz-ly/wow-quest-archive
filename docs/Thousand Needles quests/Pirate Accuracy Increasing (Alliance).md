==Objectives==
Get a River Boat from [[Mazzer Stripscrew]] and then use the Frost Cannon to extinguish 15 fires.
*Get boat from Mazzer
*Fires extinguished (15)

==Description==
I don't know if you've noticed, but the cannonballs are hitting us. I'd say the [[Southsea Freebooters|Southsea]] pirates are getting more accurate... the ship is on fire!

You've got a river boat now. Go talk to Mazzer Stripscrew.

Put those fires out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50}}
*440 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Completion==
One problem down. Now to deal with the greater threat!

==Notes==
On accept, the phase changes... the ship is on fire! Run out and find Mazzer where the player first landed in [[Two If By Boat]] at {{co|78.9|75.7|Thousand Needles}} on the southeast corner of the speedbarge.

His gossip text:
:Oh gosh! Oh golly! Yo're gonna put out the fires and stop those pirates from getting on the Speedbarge, right?
{{gossip|''Get me into my boat, Mazzer.''}}

The River Boat has one ability:
*{{Abilities|Frost Cannon|range=200|Target the fires on Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge. Collateral damage is unfortunate, but likely unavoidable.}}

Position the camera so that it's looking down at the speedbarge, then hit 1 and aim the ground-targeted AoE at something burning. The collateral damage the spell mentions is freezing the crewmembers in their tracks if they get hit by the spell.

Put out fifteen fires to complete the quest automatically and get [[Circle the Wagons... er, Boats]] next.

==Progression==
{{Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
