{{questportrait|Whrrrl.jpg|Whrrrl|Blow the horn and then slay Whrrrl.}}
== Objectives ==
Slay Whrrrl.
*Blow the horn
*[[Whrrrl]] slain

== Description ==
That old, bitter centaur, {{NPC||Skycaller Vrakthris}}, mentioned a great air spirit that the centaur worship. To secure the [[Splithoof Heights|Heights]], the last step is for us to deal with this thing.

I've seen them blow the giant horn at the top of the hill there and an air elemental came down. It gave them orders and then dissipated.

Go blow that horn, <name>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|15}}
*600-6,000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Progress ==
It's simple really... you blow the horn, their elemental leader shows up, and you kill it.

== Completion ==
Well then, let's see them get any kind of magical hocus pocus air support now when we take over!

== Notes ==
The horn is on the rise at {{co|89.5|47.0|Thousand Needles}} toward the north end of camp. Blow it to summon Whrrrl. 1321 health, level 42 air elemental.

On aggro:
:{{text|yell|Whrrrl|You dare upon call a lord of [[Skywall]], <name>? I will destroy you and cast your carcass back down into the pit of slime from whence you crawled!}}

==Progression==
{{Splithoof Heights}}
