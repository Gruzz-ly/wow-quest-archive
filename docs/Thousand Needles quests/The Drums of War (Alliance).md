== Objectives ==
Collect the Drums of War.
*[[The Drums of War]]

== Description ==
Whatever the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] are doing with these Drums of War, we don't want them to have them.

Don't worry, <name>, we'll figure it all out. But first, we need to gather all of the pieces of the puzzle.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Progress ==
The tauren love their drums. I can only imagine the Drums of War will be somehow different from the others.

== Completion ==
Surely that was the voice of the Elder Crone!

We must be very careful, <name>. Great danger lies ahead if {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem}} has taken notice of you.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Writ of History]] before starting the search. The drums can be found on the bluff with Grundig Darkcloud, at {{co|34.0|37.1|Thousand Needles}} in the building just south of the bridge leading north. Loot it and Arikara appears yet again:
:Well done, <class>! You can follow simple clues.
:Now, hurry along, little <name>. I've one more challenge to see if you're worthy of the honor.
:Oh, and do be a dear and kill {{NPC||Arnak Grimtotem||Arnak}} for me along the way. He's become something of an embarassment to the family.
:''Arikara flys off to the northeast bluff.''
