==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Freewind Brave]] at [[Darkcloud Pinnacle]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

==Description==
We saw to it that the brave was healed and re-equipped. I already sent him back into the field.

Head back up and go to Darkcloud Pinnacle. He'll meet you there.

==Completion==
I am honored by your presence, <name>. Let us put the fear of the [[Earth Mother]] into the Grimtotem.

==Notes==
Cross the first two bridges then head up the hill. Step onto the bridge to Darkcloud and the brave will join the player:
:{{text|say|Freewind Brave|Hello again, <class>.}}
