==Objectives==
Defend the Oil Drilling Rig
*Oil Drilling Rig defended
*[[Oil Drilling Rig]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm not leaving here empty-handed! Are you?

I'll bet you were wondering what's in the giant crate. Well, wait no longer. I want you to take up one of our drilling rigs to the oil pools and pump us some crude.

Of course, you should expect the centaur to attack. Just defend the drill long enough for us to get a barrel or two out of the ground.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*460-4,590 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
How much oil did you get?

==Completion==
[[Oil]]! Black gold! Tanaris Tea!

We're rich! We just have to clear out the remaining pesky [[centaur]]. I'm sure with all the money we're going to make, we can relocate them to some other bluff.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eminent Domain]] before going slaughtering. Find an empty pool and drop the oil rig. The rig has 2200 health and must be defended for two minutes. There are three scripted spawns, one every 30 sec. The centaur spawn with aggro on the rig, so quickly peel them off before they do much damage to it.

First is one Wrangler:
:{{text|yell|Galak Wrangler|To arms, brothers and sisters! They are destroying this land!}}
Next is two stormers:
:{{text|yell|Galak Stormer|There Will Be Blood!}}
Finally, one mauler and one wrangler:
:{{text|yell|Galak Mauler|You're polluting our new home!}}
