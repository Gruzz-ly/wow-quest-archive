==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Feralas Sentinel]] at [[Darkcloud Pinnacle]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

==Description==
We saw to it that the [[sentinels|sentinel]] was healed and re-equipped. I already sent her back into the field.

Head back up and go to Darkcloud Pinnacle. She'll meet you there.

==Completion==
Good to see you again, <name>. Let us put the fear of the [[Elune|Goddess]] into the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]].

==Notes==
Cross the first two bridges then head up the hill. Step onto the bridge to Darkcloud and the sentinel will join the player:
:{{text|say|Feralas Sentinel|Hello again, <class>.}}

==Progression==
