== Objectives ==
Deliver the List of Parts to {{NPC||Jinky Twizzlefixxit}} at [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge]] in [[Thousand Needles]].
*[[List of Parts]] (provided)

== Description ==
Hello there. Pleased to meet you! I'm {{NPC||Fizzle Brassbolts}}. Welcome to my Speedbarge.

I share your concerns about helping all of Thousand Needles. It's my firm belief that the Speedbarge is the best hope for the entire region.

Perhaps you could help us out a little bit here? I'm sure that you're equipped with what you need to tackle everything else.

As to that, if you could just run this list of parts over to Jinky Twizzlefixxit in her shop, you'll be well on your way.

== Progress ==
Is that the list of parts, finally? I've been waiting all day for that!

== Completion ==
<Jinky eyes the list of parts and spits!>

I don't have even half of that stuff!

== Notes ==
Exit the captain's quarters and take the first left to enter Jinky's shop. The parts list calls for "Everything, INCLUDING the kitchen sink!"

==Progression==
