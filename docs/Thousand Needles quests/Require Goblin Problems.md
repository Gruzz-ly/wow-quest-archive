==Objective==
Bring [[Fizzbizz Coppercoil]] a Thunderstomp Stegodon Horn
*[[Thunderstomp Stegodon Horn]]

==Description==
Can you hear the explosions on the racetrack? No seriously, can you? Most of my hearing is gone. Anyways... Magnets! By carefully placing magnets all along the racetrack and adding the reverse polarity to the bottom of our vehicle, we shall simply float above the mines! Take that [[Goblin]]s! The last piece of the puzzle, we need something that can hold an electrical charge to manage the complicated electrical paneling. Head to Southwest Un'goro and bring me a Thunderstomp Stegodon Horn!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4}}
* 14000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Thunderstomp Stegodon Horn is the perfect organic compound to manage the electrical fields needed to make these magnets work. Or I hope so at least, I'm not exactly sure how they work.

==Completion==
This will do nicely! Its{{sic}} still crackling with energy! If I had any hair left it would shooting in all directions!
