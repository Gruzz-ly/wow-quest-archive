Collect Longhorn's Horn.
*[[Longhorn's Horn]]

==Description==
Here lies the broken body of the [[Freewind Post]] lorekeeper, [[Montarr]]. The aged tauren's body is broken, lying in a pool of his own blood.

A trail of droplets leads back to the inn....

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|1|20}}|Horn of the Traitor}}

==Progress==
What's this, <class>? 

==Completion==
A traitor amongst the [[tauren]]?

I've never heard of such a thing. Clan rivalries and warfare are one thing, but killing your own in cold blood.

<Quentin shakes his head in disbelief.>

*350 reputation with [[Darnassus]]
