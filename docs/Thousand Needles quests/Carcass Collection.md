These organs be a good start, mon, but we still be needin' lotsa other tings. Normally, we'd be gettin' stuff from family now, but dats only me and my sistah's boy, and Tony ain't worth it!

So, we be substitutin' some stuff. Lotsa carcasses, in fact!

Deep down in the Shimmering Deep, there's tons of dem from when the water came rushin' in. Killed all of dem creatures. Go down there and bring me up some.

== Completion ==
Oh, that's disgustin'!

We almost there, mon. Just need ta do one more ting!

== Notes ==
It's a journey back to pre-''Cataclysm'' [[Shimmering Flats]]! All of the land-based old-world mobs &mdash; saltstone basilisks, crystalhides and gazers, scorpid reavers and terrors, sparkleshell snappers and tortoises &mdash; are all still on the flats where they used to be, at the level they were at before the water came. The [[silithid]] are still alive and hostile, though. Don't try to collect them.
