Collect 8 Sunken Treasure Chests.
*[[Sunken Treasure Chest]] (8)

==Description==
The key to this cage is held by [[Tony Two-Tusk]], the pirate admiral, and he's guarded by [[ogre]]s that you'll never be able to kill!

<[[Wizzle Brassbolts|Wizzle]] cries some more and then looks up, an idea forming in his brain.>

I've got it! What do all pirates want more than anything else? No, not grog. Something even better... treasure!

They had a ship full of treasure that was sunk by a giant [[Whale Shark (Thousand Needles)|whale shark]]. The treasure is scattered all over down in the [[Mirage Abyss]] to the northwest.

Go get it!
