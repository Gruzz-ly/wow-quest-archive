== Objectives ==
Disable Magatha's Bonds Controller.
*Controller disabled
*[[Bulwark Disguise]] (provided)

== Description ==
You have the code. Now all you have to do is head to the eastern section of the [[Twilight Bulwark|Bulwark]] and free the {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem||Elder Crone}}.

Good luck, <name>. Thank you for all you've done.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|30}}

== Completion ==
You've freed the Elder Crone. Time to follow the path east and meet her at the [[Twilight Withering]].

The final confrontation with the [[Twilight's Hammer]] is upon you!

== Notes ==
Make sure to put the [[Bulwark Disguise]] back on before leaving Lakota to save some pointless fighting. Then head down to the southeast. At {{co|35.9|60.7|Thousand Needles}} on the east side of the Bulwark is Magatha's Bonds Controller, a dozen yards in front of Magatha Grimtotem. Interact with it to free her and complete the quest automatically.

:{{text|say|Magatha Grimtotem|I'm surprised that you made it this far.}}
:{{text|say|Magatha Grimtotem|I suppose I should thank you for freeing me. We'll soon see if you think that was a wise decision.}}
