== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem}} at the [[Twilight Withering]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

== Description ==
According to Magatha, she'll meet you just outside of the Twilight Withering to the east.

== Completion ==
It took you long enough. Do you think that we are playing games here?

== Notes ==
Alas, the cover was blown by freeing Magatha... the cultists at the bulwark are hostile again. Get past them and run east down the ridge past the wildlife to find Magatha and {{NPC||Arikara}} just outside the camp proper. Pay attention to her gossip text:
{{Dialogue|
Do you want to see the utter destruction of what's left of Thousand Needles?

No?

Then do exactly as I command.
