== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Pozzik}} on [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

== Description ==

And <name>, if we ever cross paths again, you will die.

== Rewards ==

You will also receive:

*825 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
Wow, she's evil! But what does it mean, <name>? Is {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem||Magatha}} going to destroy us? Is she in charge of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] now?

Watever happens, you've delivered us from our enemies. Please allow me to show you our gratitude.

== Notes ==
The quickest path to the water is just to the northwest. Jump down, get on the boat and run!
