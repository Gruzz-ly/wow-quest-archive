==Objectives==
While many inhabitants of {{C|Thousand Needles}} are our enemies, we can't stand by and watch them get washed away. The note was clear, they plan to raise an [[undead]] army in the aftermath, which potentially threatens us all.

We are ill equipped to deal with this, but I've heard of a [[shaman]] on the [[Eastern Kingdoms]] who's proficient in the elemental imbuement of weapons, they might be capable of helping.

Find this shaman and plead for their aid.

==Description==
I've heard of [[Hirzek]], and the barbaric lengths they have gone to manipulate the elements.

<Rau's eyes wander as he ponders the note, speaking to himself aloud.>

The storm will rage, the ground will rumble, and the tide will rise...

<Rau's eyes focus you and widen as he comes to the realization.>

They must be using some cruel sorcery they learned from Hirzek. They plan to flood the canyon and raise us all into [[undeath]].

To achieve their goal, I fear they require devastating [[elemental]] powers.

==Completion==
<You hand the note to Bath'rah who reads it over and gives a half hearted chuckle.>

Ah so it be true mon... I too have sensed much unrest in the [[elemental plane]] and dis must be one of the causes.

To flood all da Thousand Needles would take a great storm and many lives be lost.

I t'ink I got just da t'ing for ya, but it won't come easy.
