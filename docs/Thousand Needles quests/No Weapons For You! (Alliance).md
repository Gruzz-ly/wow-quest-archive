==Objectives==
Burn 8 Grimtotem Weapon Racks.
*[[Grimtotem Weapon Rack|Weapon racks]] burned (8)

==Description==
Alright, these cowards want to fight? Let's see how well they do without any weapons.

I'm sure you must have a torch, or something. Burn their weapon racks.

Burn them all!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*480-4,820 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We'll need to destroy more of their weapon racks if we're going to put a dent in their ability to fight.

==Completion==
Let's see them wage their war now!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Darkcloud Grimtotem]] and [[Grimtotem Chiefs: Isha Gloomaxe]] before heading out. Then start killing. The sentinel can more than hold her own, which is great, as the hostiles often come in groups. Immediately outside of Isha's tent is The Rattle of Bones. Pick it up to start its' eponymous quest, [[The Rattle of Bones]].

Don't focus on burning weapon racks to the detriment of anything else. There's going to be plenty of time.
