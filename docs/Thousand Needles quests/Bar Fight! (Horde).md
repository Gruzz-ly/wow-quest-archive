== Objectives ==
Start a bar fight!
*Bar Fight started!

== Description ==
Those pint-sized, goober-looking, no-explosion [[gnome]]s have got it coming!

I want you to go into the [[Speedbarge Bar]], order a bottle of grog, and hit one over the head with it!

Show them that we're not going to take any more of their insolence, <name>!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50}}
*440 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
What? Are you deaf?

You need to go start that bar fight... now!

== Completion ==
Yes! You're a real credit to the Horde!

You know, you can go back in there and do that anytime you feel like it. I highly encourage you to do so! 

== Notes ==
After first landing on the Speedbarge, this side quest opens up from Zamek out on deck. Head to the stern of the ship, southwest, but before going up the ramp upstairs, take a left and enter the bar. {{NPC||Daisy}}, the bartender, is serving plenty of {{NPC||Gnome Bar Patron||gnomish}} and {{NPC||Goblin Bar Patron||goblin}} bar patrons.

A [[Bottle of Grog]] costs {{cost||20}}, so buy one and smash it over the head of a nearby gnome!

On starting the fight:
:{{text|yell|Gnome Bar patron|<Name>!}}
:{{text|bossemote|BAR FIGHT!}}
:''Daisy lets the fight go on for a minute or so as the Brute Squad is called in!''
:{{text|yell|Daisy|Break it up! The Brute Squad is coming!}}

==Progression==
{{Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge}}
