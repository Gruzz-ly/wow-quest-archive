==Objectives==
Assassinate Codemaster Deethuk, Commander Fastfuse, and Elementalist Starion.
*[[Codemaster Deethuk]] assassinated
*[[Commander Fastfuse]] assassinated
*[[Elementalist Starion]] assassinated
*[[Bulwark Disguise]]

==Description==
The three leaders of the [[Twilight Bulwark|Bulwark]] are powerful and not to be underestimated, <name>. Fortunately for us, you now have a disguise to make you look like one of the [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight cultists]].

You should put the disguise on and speak with Codemaster Deethuk, Commander Fastfuse, and Elementalist Starion each alone. Get them to turn their backs on you, and when they do, strike quickly!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Starion's Slippers
|Codemaster's Cuffs
|Fastfuse Gloves
|Bulwark of Leaders}}
You will also receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
You'll have to deal with all three of them if the Twilight Bulwark is to be neutralized.

==Completion==
Now that those three are dealt with, the combined forces from [[Freewind Post]] should be able to handle the rest of the cultists here.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Codemaster's Code]] and put on the Bulwark Disguise before heading out. All of the Twilight cultists are now friendly, so talk to them. They have some interesting gossip text:
*The end days are nigh!
*Isn't it weird that we're keeping [[Magatha Grimtotem]] captive here? Good thing all of her totems were destroyed. ''(Fact: they were destroyed by [[Baine]] after retaking [[Thunder Bluff]].)''
*I even heard that she poisoned [[Cairne Bloodhoof]]. Wish she were on our side.
*There's a little blood on your armor there. Are you okay?
*Do I know you? No? Welcome to the Twilight's Hammer.
*Hey, you haven't seen [[Grom-Grom]] have you? Orc, about this tall. No?
*Hmm. No one's seen him for a while. Probably went a.w.o.l.
*New recruit? Have you reported to the commander yet?
*Keep your eyes peeled. They say that freak that was attacking people earlier might still be around.
*Something big's brewing at the [[Twilight Withering|Withering]] to the east.
*Whatever it is, I hope that it'll be over soon and we get restationed somewhere nicer.
