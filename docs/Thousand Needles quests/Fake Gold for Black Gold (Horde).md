Deliver the Pallet of "Gold" to {{NPC||Khan Blizh}} at the [[Splithoof Heights]] in [[Thousand Needles]].
*[[Pallet of "Gold"]] (provided)

== Description ==
Now that the "gold" is ready, I want you to take it up to Khan Blizh. He'll be so overwhelmed, I bet he'll offer to help us setup the drilling rigs. We could use the horsepower.

Haha, get it? Horsepower?
 
== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||5}}

== Progress ==
What's this? That is a lot of gold you have there.

== Completion ==
Just put it on the ground, <race>.

== Notes ==
Back to the same tent where Koalbeard is.

On complete:
