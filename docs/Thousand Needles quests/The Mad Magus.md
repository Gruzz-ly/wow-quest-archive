==Notes==
Take the portal to [[Tirth's Haunt]] to save another annoying run across the length of the Holdfast. There, at {{co|85.1|91.8|Thousand Needles}} is Tirth, who is tormenting [["Plucky" Johnson]] by throwing various spells at him and the chickens following him around, along with some taunts:
*I know what I'm having for dinner tonight and it rhymes with "Sucky"!
*I could have stopped the sea if not for your incessant clucking!
*Stand still you worthless chicken!
Kill him and take through the portal back to her camp north of the holdfast.

On complete:
:{{text|yell|Tony Two-Tusk|I LIVE!}}
:{{text|yell|Tony Two-Tusk|Thanks, mon. You've been true to your word and I can respect that.}}
:{{text|yell|Tony Two-Tusk|I need to get back. I'm sure we'll cross paths again. Next time, I'll get to return the favor.}}
:{{text|yell|Tony Two-Tusk|Bye, hon. See you later tonight.}}
:{{text|say|Ajamon Ghostcaller|No you won't, Tony. Go away, I'm busy summoning up a date for later!}}

This concludes Tony's chain. Finish up [[Quiet the Cannons]] and [[A Little Payback]], then either head back to the speedbarge to turn those two quests in, or head elsewhere. [[Splithoof Heights]], to the north at {{co|91.4|57.8|Thousand Needles}} for [[Negotiations]] is closest.

==Progression==
{{Southsea Holdfast}}
