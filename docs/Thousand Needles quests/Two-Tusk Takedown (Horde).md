==Objectives==
Obtain the Rusted Cage Key.
*[[Rusted Cage Key]]
*[[Fake Treasure]] (provided)

==Description==
This treasure's all fake, but it's not like those [[Den Whomper|den whompers]] are going to know the difference. Stupid [[ogre]]s!

Here's the plan... you head into the [[Admiral's Den]] and spread all of this "treasure" around to any ogres that get in your way. Then all you have to do is confront [[Tony Two-Tusk]].

You'll have the key to the cage in no-time!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Buoyant Shoulderpads|Synge's Wristbands|Den Whomper Boots|Drinker's Bracers}}

You will receive:
*{{cost|1|15}}
*600-6000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
What's going on? You gonna get me out of here?

==Completion==
Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'm sure that your little adventure into the cave was very interesting.

How about we talk about it over drinks back on the Speedbarge once you get me out of this cage?

==Notes==
Head south to the cave. The [[Den Whomper]]s are level elite ogres, and are not meant to be taken on alone. Use the fake treasure to bribe them from 20 yards away. They will turn friendly and disappear.

Take the first left and follow the outer cage wall around to the north, then east to find Tony Two-Tusk at {{co|95.2|79.5|Thousand Needles}}, a troll with five treasure chests behind him. Engage him and he will jump into the treasure chest behind him and disappear!
:{{text|say|Tony Two-Tusk|We gonna show you why treasure be a pirate's best friend!}}

This is a five-phase fight. First up, Tony and three [[Southsea Burnmaster]]s:
:{{text|say|Tony Two-Tusk|Burn dem all ta cinders!}}
:{{text|say|Southsea Burnmaster|Aye aye!}} x3
The Burnmasters have a Flamethrower attack as their one ability:
*{{abilities|Flamethrower|Deals Fire damage to all enemies in a cone in front of the caster for until cancelled.|notes=Channeled}}
Take out the burnmasters closest to Tony, then wail on him until he closes the chests. 

Up next is Tony and two [[Southsea Grenadier]]s:
:{{text|say|Tony Two-Tusk|Light da fuses, boys!}}
:{{text|say|Southsea Grenadier|Blowin 'em to bits, boss!}} x2
The grenadiers only throw dynamite:
*{{Abilities|Burning Blaze|id=86087|Deals Fire damage to all enemies within the blaze.  Lasts 15 sec.|icon=inv_summerfest_firespirit}}
*{{Abilities|Throw Dynamite|id=86088|Hurls a stick of dynamite at an enemy, inflicting Fire damage and creating a burning blaze beneath the target's feet.|icon=inv_misc_bomb_03}}

Same as before, take them out then turn back to Tony. He next brings in a huge group of [[Southsea Parrot]]s:
:{{text|say|Tony Two-Tusk|Peck 'dere eyes out!}}
Roughly seven parrots emerge. A single [[Area of Effect]] move is all that is necessary to kill all of them, but they only hit for a few points of damage each.

The fourth phase has tony bringing out a [[Southsea Engineer]]:
:{{text|say|Tony Two-Tusk|Hit dem wit da most powaful 'ting you got!}}
:{{text|say|Southsea Engineer|Powering up a high-powered shot!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Kill the engineer before she can get a shot off!}}
Her ability:
*{{Abilities|High-Powered Shot|id=86090|Aims a precise shot at an enemy, inflicting significant damage.|icon=inv_spear_07}}
As the boss warning indicates, this can one-shot players, so kill her quickly!

The fifth phase introduces a friendly [[Confused Murloc]]!
:{{text|say|Confused Murloc|Mrrglrglrgl?}}
:{{text|say|Confused Murloc|Mrrglrgl, mmrglrlglrrrglrggl!}}
The murloc and all of the [[Baby Murloc (Thousand Needles)|Baby Murloc]]s are friendly, so take this opportunity to unload on Tony.

If, after all five phases, Tony isn't dead, he will repeat the process as long as it takes for players to kill him - except when the murloc would appear, instead Tony will appear in each one of the chests in an attempt to confuse.
:{{text|say|Tony Two-Tusk|Ah, but which one is da real one?}}

When he finally does bite the dust, he will jump out of whatever chest he is in and return to his spawn position before perishing.

:{{text|say|Tony Two-Tusk|No... da world... is mine...}}
Loot him and exit the cave, remembering to bribe the ogres on the way out.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Wizzle Brassbolts|Oh no! The key broke in the lock! I'll never get out of this cage!}}
Suddenly, the {{NPC||Spirit of Tony Two-Tusk}} appears, haunting the player, offering the next quest!
