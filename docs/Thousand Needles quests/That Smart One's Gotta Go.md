{{questportrait|Hive Controller.jpg|Hive Controller|Slay it for the future prosperity of the Ice Cream Empire!}}
== Objectives ==
Slay the Hive Controller.
*[[Hive Controller]] slain

== Description ==
There's some kind of smart brain bug in the back of the cave. It's in charge of all of the [[silithid]] down there.

My ice cream is melting! How am I supposed to launch my ice cream empire, and save my inventory, if that thing's in there?!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ice Cream Churner
|Hive Controller Mantle
|Really Cold Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|15}}

== Progress ==
<Name>!  Get down there and kill that thing!

== Completion ==
Outstanding! Nothing can stop us from being the greatest purveyors of ice cream in all of [[Azeroth]]!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Freezing the Pipes]] before jumping in. After freezing the four pipes, continue to the southwest to take out the Hive Controller, a level 42 silithid with 2642 health.

This concludes the chain. Head back to the Speedbarge or up to the other areas &mdash; the [[Southsea Holdfast]] and the [[Splithoof Heights]].
