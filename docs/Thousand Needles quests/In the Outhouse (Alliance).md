== Objectives ==
Obtain a Pirate's Crowbar and use it to pry open the [[Submerged Outhouse]] door.
*Use the crowbar on the outhouse

== Description ==
Hello? Hello! HELP!

I'm almost out of air! You have to get me out of here!

<The voice inside gags.>

One of those {{NPC||Southsea Treasure Hunter||Southsea treasure hunters}} has got to have a crowbar!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||50}}

== Progress ==
Oh, for the love of the [[Light]], do you have that crowbar yet? Drowning here!

== Completion ==
Thank goodness! Now, just a little shove...

== Notes ==
On [[Down in the Deeps]], this quest opens up just beneath the speedbarge. Start it before killing pirates. One of them will drop the [[Pirate's Crowbar]]. Return to the outhouse and use it.

On complete:
