==Objectives==
Slay Grundig Darkcloud.
*[[Grundig Darkcloud]] slain

==Description==
One of the most accomplished [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] leaders of the [[Stonetalon Mountains]] has returned home.

We must make the most of this chance and put an end to his campaign of terror once and for all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|15}}
*600-6000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to find and slay Grundig Darkcloud, <name>.

==Completion==
<The brave gives you an appraising look.>

There is something special about you, <name>. That much is certain.

==Notes==
Keep heading northwest. On the next bluff, Grundig can be found at {{co|34.0|40.1|Thousand Needles}} in the longhouse on the southern side. A 42 elite, he has 9906 health. Given the opportunity, he will stack Rage of the Darkcloud, which increases damage dealt and reduces the time between attacks as often as he can, at 10% a stack.

Aggro:
:I knew you were on your way. I don't care what they're saying about you or your connection to Arikara. This ends here!
Death:
:After everything, this is how it ends? Here on Darkcloud Pinnacle?
