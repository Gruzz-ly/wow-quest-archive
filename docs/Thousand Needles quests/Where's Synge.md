==Objectives==
Find [[Synge]] at the [[Southsea Holdfast]] in [[Thousand Needles]]. 

==Description==
Hey, <name>, you haven't seen our gunsmith, Synge, have you?

I just know that the pirates captured him! He said that he was going to try to sell them some rifles, or something.

Would you please look for him up at the Southsea Holdfast to the east? I'll bet that no-good gnome he's always traveling with, [[Wizzle Brassbolts]], got him into trouble!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*4,600 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Completion==
Hey! Get me out of here!
