==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Holdfast Cannons.
*[[Holdfast Cannon]]s destroyed (8)

==Description==
Now it's time to do something about those darn cannons up on the bluffs to the east!

If you'd be so kind, hop into your boat and cruise on over to the [[Southsea Holdfast]]. Up top you'll see a bunch of cannons firing down on us.

[[Southsea Freebooters|Those pirates]] don't know squat about [[engineering]]. It shouldn't be too difficult for you to clog 'em up and make them explode.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*460-4,590 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Oh, I don't know, you might want to destroy a few more of those cannons at the pirate holdfast.

What do you think?

==Completion==
They're still shooting, but not nearly as much! Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaah!

==Notes==
Before heading out, search the ship and pick up all of [[Where's Synge?]], [[A Little Payback (Horde)]], [[Negotiations (Horde)]] and [[Special Delivery for Brivelthwerp (Horde)]]. Hop on the river boat and head northeast to the Southsea Holdfast, then start killing pirates to get up top. On the plateau, simply interact with the cannons to take them out. Keep an eye out for Synge, who is locked in a cage at {{co|91.6|79.2|Thousand Needles}} north of the middle bunker.

==Progression==
