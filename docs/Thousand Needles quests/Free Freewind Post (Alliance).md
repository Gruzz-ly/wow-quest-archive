== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Quentin}} at [[Freewind Post]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

== Description ==
Alas, it's time for you to leave. How quickly the chicks fall from the next. Or, something.

Anyway, you've done solid work here, my friend, but Quentin and the [[night elf|night elves]] have been crying that they urgently need your help with the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] at Freewind Post to the northwest.

If you ask me, it's a lost cause, but who knows... maybe with your help they'll actually succeed?

== Completion ==
I'm glad that Fizzle finally sent you here. We're helping the tauren to retake Freewind Post and push back the Grimtotem.

== Notes ==
Head to the northwest. At {{co|46.4|57.9|Thousand Needles}} on the south side of the needle south of Freewind is Quentin, Thalia and a neutral repair vendor.

==Progression==
