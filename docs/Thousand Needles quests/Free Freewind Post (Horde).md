== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Thalia Amberhide}} at [[Freewind Post]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

== Description ==
Well, it looks like it's time for us to part ways, at least for a while. To the northwest, the [[tauren]] of Freewind Post are in desperate need of your assistance in pushing back the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem clan]]!

You know, you've been such a great help around here, I bet you're going to be their <hero/heroine> in no-time!

== Completion ==
I am honored that you have come to help, <class>. It was kind of Pozzik to send you.

== Notes ==
Head to the northwest. At {{co|46.4|57.9|Thousand Needles}} on the south side of the needle south of Freewind is Quentin, Thalia and a neutral repair vendor.
