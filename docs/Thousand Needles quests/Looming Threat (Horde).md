==Objectives==
Find help in [[Razorfen Downs]]. 

==Description==
The [[Quilboar]] in Razorfen Downs seem to have allied with the [[Scourge]]. This is dark news for us, <class>. We have dire enough problems dealing with these [[Grimtotem]], we won't be able to handle an attack by the Scourge. Venture into Razorfen Downs, east of here, and see if you can find anyone that may be able to help you stop them before they decide to attack here. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||27|75}}
* 260 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You seem an able warrior. Perhaps you can help me put an end to the terrible evil here. 

==Patch changes==
