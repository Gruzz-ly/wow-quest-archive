== Objectives ==
Slay 7 Grimtotem Marauders.
*[[Grimtotem Marauder]] slain x7

== Description ==
This is going to take a while, but I'm sure we'll beat them back.

You're more good to [[Thousand Needles]] elsewhere. We have reports that the [[gnome]]s and [[goblin]]s out on the flooded [[Shimmering Flats|salt flats]] somehow survived on a [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge|giant barge]]! Rendow is on the dock. She'll get you a boat to go there.

Mind helping us out a little on your way to her?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||50}}

== Progress ==
Think you could take care a few more of the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] for us first, friend?

== Completion ==
A boat? Yes, you can have this last one.

== Notes ==
Head northeast toward the dock overlooking old [[Thalanaar]]. There is but one boat not on fire.

==Progression==
{{Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
