==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Kelsey Steelspark}} at [[Gadgetzan]] in [[Tanaris]].

==Description==
Heya, , Kelsey Steelspark down in Tanaris left a message for you. He says that the gnomes down there in Gadgetzan heard about what you've been doing up here.

Anyway, the Cataclysm hit them hard, too. Not as hard as us, but I'm certain they could use your help.

==Completion==
Greetings and salutations, friend. Welcome to Tanaris!
