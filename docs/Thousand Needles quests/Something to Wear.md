== Objectives ==
Collect 10 pieces of [[Twilight's Hammer]] Armor.
*[[Twilight's Hammer Armor]] x10

== Description ==
I've got an idea for how you can get close to their leaders without getting killed. But first, you're going to need to find something to wear.

My suggestion is that you head up there and get their armor from them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Lakota's Mace
|Well Hammered Shield
|Bloodstained Twilight Belt
|Lakota's Gavel
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
How much of that armor have you collected?

You're going to want to be well-disguised for the next thing that you're going to have to do.

== Completion ==
<Lakota looks worried at the condition of the armor, especially the bloodstains.>

You don't fool around, do you, <name>? Well, it'll have to do.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Break Them Out]] before heading out. Defenders, jailers, magi all drop armor.

==Progression==
{{Magatha rising}}
