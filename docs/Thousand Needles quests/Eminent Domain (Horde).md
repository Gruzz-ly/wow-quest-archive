==Objectives==
Slay 15 [[Splithoof Heights]] centaur.
*Splithoof Heights centaur slain (15)

==Description==
It is our destiny to take this oil. Unfortunate that the [[centaur]] retreated to here when the sea rushed in.

Unfortunate for them, that is.

They've spit in our faces, <name>. We made them a generous offer and they made the mistake of not accepting. Now we... you, will show them the error of their ways.

Clear the centaur off of the Splithoof Heights. The oil must flow!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*460-4,590 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
We'll never take over the Heights unless you kill those centaur!

==Completion==
That'll teach them. You've softened the Splithoof up enough that we should be able to govern them now with a minimal guard presence from the Speedbarge.

That is, once we've dealt with their supposed [[air elemental]] leader.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Defend the Drill]] before going slaughtering. Make sure to leave five centaur for the Defend the Drill script event.
