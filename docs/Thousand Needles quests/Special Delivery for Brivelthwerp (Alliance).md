==Objectives==
Deliver the I-Scream Cryocannon to [[Brivelthwerp]] at the [[Sunken Dig Site]] in [[Thousand Needles]].
*[[I-Scream Cryocannon]] (provided)

==Description==
I have a new business partner, my best buddy, Brivelthwerp. Even as we speak, he's building up the infrastructure for our new ice cream empire!

He took our coolant tug, inventory, and employees southwest to the Sunken Dig Site. Unfortunately, I don't currently have a way to deliver something to him... something extremely important: our super-secret I-Scream Cryocannon!

You don't mind taking it to him, do you, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*45 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That's not what I think it is? Is it?!

==Completion==
That must be the new I-Scream Cryocannon! Ain't she a beauty?!

<Brivelthwerp eyes you shrewdly.>

I'm going to let you in on a secrew, my good <man/lady>: the groundwork for a vast mercantile empire is being laid right here!

Tell me... how do you feel about ice cream?

==Notes==
Before heading out, search the ship and pick up all of [[Quiet the Cannons (Alliance)]], [[Where's Wizzle?]], [[A Little Payback (Alliance)]] and [[Negotiations (Alliance)]]. All of those quests are separate to the ice cream storyline, however.

Brivelthwerp can be found on the surface at {{co|69.9|85.2|Thousand Needles}} above the Sunken Dig Site.

The cryocannon does not despawn upon leaving Thousand Needles! Some players choose not to turn in this quest, so they can run through the world with the cryocannon on their back, whenever they choose.
