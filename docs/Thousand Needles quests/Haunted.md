== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Ajamon Ghostcaller}} at the [[Southsea Holdfast]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

== Description ==
You think I'm going to just let you go after you killed me [[Two-Tusk Takedown|like that]], mon? No way! I didn't create a [[Pirate|piratical]] [[Merchant|mercantile]] empire out of nothing just to see you bring me down.

You're going to help me get back to life. Find my ex-wife, Ajamon, on the north side of the Holdfast. Just follow your nose. She'll be wherever the stinky brewing cauldron is.

== Completion ==
What ya be wantin'? Oh no you don't. I can see ya got Tony's spirit with ya, and I want nothin' to do with it!

== Notes ==
Run north to the edge of the plateau and turn east to find Ajamon's little camp.

Along the way, Tony has some lines:
*{{text|say|You know, if you'd just been reasonable about the whole thing, I might have simply sold the key to you. Not that it would have done you any good. Broke off in the lock. Muahahahahahahaha!}}
*{{text|say|This afterlife thing isn't all that bad. I can see lots of business opportunities here. Plenty of spirits that are waiting for the right deal to come along.}}
*{{text|say|Didn't take me long to build a pirate empire out of almost nothing. Ah, the [[Barrens]]. Now those were the days. Hey, did anyone ever find out what happened with [[Olgra|Mankrik's wife]]?}}
*{{text|say|You are just the kind of scum that I'm looking for in my organization. You know, we're an independently run franchise of the [[Southsea Freebooters]]. We have pretty good benefits, vacation, and full medical, dental, and vision. Maybe we should talk after you bring me back to life.}}
*{{text|say|What's the weather like? I can't tell... it's all grey and dark, swirling clouds here.}}
*{{text|say|You don't like me following you around? Too bad! Maybe next time you go murdering someone just to get a key, you'll thing twice!}}
*{{text|say|Sorry about having to deal with [[Ajamon Ghostcaller|my wife]], mon. She's crazy, but I still love her, you know?}}
*{{text|say|They say I have a bad reputation as a pirate, but you don't see me sailing around indiscriminately killing people just to make a profit. Oh, wait...}}
*{{text|say|You want to know why women are no-good? Because you think that all they're doing is calling upon the spirits of the dead. But then, you catch them doing a little more than talking! I mean, how does that even work with a ghost?}}
*{{text|say|You know, the attacks on the [[Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge|Speedbarge]] are just a business misunderstanding. When you get me rezzed, I'll consider negotiating with [[Fizzle Brassbolts|Fizzle]] and [[Pozzik]].}}
*{{text|say|First and foremost, I'm a businessman. Bring me back to life and I'll stop haunting you. There may even be a reward in it for you.}}
*{{text|say|That whole thing with [[Ajamon Ghostcaller|Ajamon's]] sister was a big misunderstanding. I didn't do it. I swear! I think it was [[Seadog Fajardo]]. The little brat kinda looks like him.}}
*{{text|say|Oh, mon. I had an itch when I died and now it won't go away. Please tell me it doesn't last for eternity?! You gotta get me rezzed!!!}}
*{{text|say|When I get back into my body, I'm going to kill you, mon! Er... no, what I meant to say is that I'm going to hug you. Yeah, that's right, I'm going to hug you and give you a big reward. Nevermind what I said about the killing.}}
*{{text|say|You got something to eat? I'm hungry!}}
*{{text|say|Ajamon took her maiden name again. Despite everything, I kinda miss her, you know?}}
