==Objectives==
Venture into the eye of the storm and confront the [[quilboar]]s.
*[[Eye of the Tempest]]
*[[Squall-breakers Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
We found an unusual amount of storm activity isolated in the bluffs to the northeast near [[Razorfen]] territory.

The wind was too powerful for the riders to get close and the density of the rain made it impossible to see what's waiting for you inside the eye. But maybe with that potion you can break on through to the other side.

Speak with [[Nyse]], Wind Rider Master, when you are ready. She will provide a [[wyvern]] to ride into the storm.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Stormchaser's Bindings]]
*[[Lightningcaller's Bindings]]
*[[Tidecaller's Bindings]]

==Progress==
What did you find?

==Completion==
The rumbling ground fell silent and in my heart I knew you had saved us. You have our gratitude, <name>.

Please accept one of these gifts as a token of our appreciation.

==Notes==
After accepting this quest, drink the potion and then speak with flight master [[Nyse]] to fly to be taken to a ledge above [[Windbreak Canyon]]. Kill the [[Ravaging Tempest]] there to loot the Eye of the Tempest.

==Progression==
{{Tattered Note}}

==Patch changes==
