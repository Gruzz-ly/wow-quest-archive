== Objectives ==
Rescue 5 Bulwark Prisoners from the {{NPC||Twilight Jailer}}s.
*{{NPC||Bulwark Prisoner}} freed x5

== Description ==
{{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem||Magatha}}'s not the only one that the [[Twilight's Hammer]] have taken prisoner.

While you're up there to the south, you should break out as may of them as you can.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

== Progress ==
There are still more prisoners, <name>.

== Completion ==
You give so much of yourself without requiring anything in return.

The people of [[Thousand Needles]] are grateful, as am I.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Something to Wear]] before heading out. Kill Jailers to free prisoners.
*They were going to sacrifice me to summon more of their elementals!
*Are you here for the Elder Crone, Magatha Grimtotem? They're holding her to the east.
*I overheard them talking. They're getting ready to summon up something big at their base to the east!
*There's been too much death. Too much destruction. Put an end to them!
*Thank you. I will not forget.
*Get some vengeance for me.
