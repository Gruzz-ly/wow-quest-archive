==Objectives==
Free 12 Highperch Pridelings.
*[[Highperch Prideling|Prideling]] freed x12

==Description==
The [[Twilight Trapper|trappers]] are rounding up all of the young [[wind rider]]s. <Name>, will you go out there and free the pridelings?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
<Name>, would you please free more of the pridelings? I'd hate to see them enslaved to the [[Twilight's Hammer]], or worse.

==Completion==
They're precious. One day they'll grow strong, but until then, they must be protected.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Death to all Trappers!]] before heading out. The pridelings are all trapped. Freeing them will temporarily make them the player's pet. Collect 12 to see them form a semicircle behind the player.

==Progression==
