== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Needles Pyrite Ore Chunks.
*[[Needles Pyrite Ore Chunk]] (8)

== Description ==
We definitely DO NOT have the kind of gold that the [[Alliance]] is offering. <Name>, we have to do something or we're not going to be able to get those drilling rights!

Wait a minute! There was this report from an underwater survey that we did right after the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]] struck. Something about some gold-looking ore that was pushed up from underground. That's it!

Head west to the old stomping grounds of the [[centaur]], [[Splithoof Crag]] and [[Splithoof Hold]], and dig some up.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*480-4,820 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Progress ==
Once you return with enough of that pyrite, we'll give it a once over with a paint brush, pile it all up on a pallet, and send you back up with it to the chieftain.

== Completion ==
Genius! Now, where's that gold paint? I know it's around here somewhere.

== Notes ==
Make sure to pick up [[The Ancient Brazier]] before heading west. Then, head back down to the water's surface and use the boat to go west, as the old centaur camp is now under water. Not really accessible from up top as the upper level stops being a working path halfway there. It's also full of hostile wildlife.

At Splithoof Crag, pyrite deposits litter the ground, so go collecting. Make sure to finish The Ancient Brazier before returning to the surface and using the river boat to get back to Splithoof Heights.
