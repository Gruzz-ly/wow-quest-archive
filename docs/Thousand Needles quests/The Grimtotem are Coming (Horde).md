== Objectives ==
Slay 7 Grimtotem Pillagers.
*[[Grimtotem Pillager]] slain x7

== Description ==
The cowardly [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] have attacked us by surprise when we were least prepared!

You will be of most help to [[Thousand Needles]] elsewhere, <class>. We have heard rumors that the goblins and gnomes somehow survived in a [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge|giant barge]] out on the salt flats.

{{npc||Motega Firemane}} is at the base of the summit. He can get you a canoe to take you there.

Do you mind helping us fight off the Grimtotem on your way to him?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||50}}

== Progress ==
Think you could take care a few more of the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] for us first, friend?

== Completion ==
You want a canoe to go out to the salt flats? But, surely the race track has been destroyed?!

Nonetheless, for your bravery, you will have the last one!

== Notes ==
Head northeast toward the dock overlooking [[Westreach Summit]]. There is but one boat not on fire.

==Progression==
{{Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge}}

== Patch changes ==
