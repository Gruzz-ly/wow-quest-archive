== Objectives ==
Collect 10 Rocket Car Parts.
*[[Rocket Car Parts]] x10

== Description ==
<{{NPC||Jinky Twizzlefixxit||Jinky}} rolls up her sleeves and slicks back her hair while eyeing you up and down.>

Fine, if {{NPC||Fizzle Brassbolts||Fizzle}} wants you to have your own boat, the first thing we'll need is parts. Guess who gets to get them?

<Jinky smiles as she points downward then grabs you a spare diving helm and some flippers.>

That's right, <brother/sister>. You get to go down into the deeps and salvage what [[rocket car]] parts you can find at the [[Raceway Ruins]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||50}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Twizzlefixxit's Vest|Driver's Armbands|Wet Suit Leggings|Raceway Boots}}

== Progress ==
I'm not punching the timecard on this one until you get me everything that's on that parts list.

== Completion ==
This'll do for a start.

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest, players are buffed with "Speedbarge Diving Helm &mdash; You have access to a Speedbarge Diving Helm anytime that you're underwater in Thousand Needles. Also includes new and improved Thermohydratic Flippers!"

Before jumping in... a few side quests have opened up. Down on deck is {{NPC||Rizzle Brassbolts}}, offering [[Bar Fight! (Alliance)]] Also, down on the sea floor is a [[Submerged Outhouse]], which offers [[In the Outhouse]]. Start it before killing pirates to better the odds of finding the crowbar.

On the seafloor, there are plenty of odds and ends of parts everywhere.

==Progression==
