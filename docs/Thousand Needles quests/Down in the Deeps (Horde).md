==Objectives==
Collect 10 Rocket Car Parts.
*[[Rocket Car Parts]] (10)

==Description==
Well friend, if [[Pozzik]] wants you to have your own boat, the first thing we'll need is parts. Guess who gets to get them?

<[[Razzeric]] smiles as he points downward then grabs you a spare diving helm and some flippers.>

I'm afraid so, <name>. You get to go down into the deeps and salvage what [[rocket car]] parts you can find at the [[Raceway Ruins]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Razzeric's Vest|Driver's Armbands|Wet Suit Leggings|Raceway Boots}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||50}}
* 440-4,370 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
We can get started as soon as you get everything that's on the list.

==Completion==
This is a great start!

==Notes==
Accepting the quest, players are buffed with "Speedbarge Diving Helm &mdash; You have access to a Speedbarge Diving Helm anytime that you're underwater in Thousand Needles. Also includes new and improved Thermohydratic Flippers!"

Before jumping in... a few side quests have opened up. Down on deck is [[Zamek]], offering [[Bar Fight! (Horde)]] Also, down on the sea floor is a [[Submerged Outhouse]], which offers [[In the Outhouse]]. Start it before killing pirates to better the odds of finding the crowbar.

On the seafloor, there are plenty of odds and ends of parts everywhere.
