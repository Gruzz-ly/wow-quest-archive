== Objectives ==
Collect the Writ of History.
*[[The Writ of History]]

== Description ==
The Rattle of Bones is a part of [[shu'halo]] ancient myth. It is always connected with the Writ of History and the Drums of War. They are supposed to be powerful tauren artifacts; gifts from the Earth Mother if the tales are to be believed. I cannot imagine Her being connected with the drums, though.

We must be vigilant if we are to find the other two. The writ will look like a pictographic scroll if memory serves. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Progress ==
We'll need the actual writ, not just any tauren scroll hanging.

== Completion ==
This is very exciting and also worrisome, <name>. What are these artifacts doing here? Are they being used as a weapons against us by the Grimtotem?

The wind serpent flew northwest to that next bluff. Maybe that's where the drums are? 

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Drums of War]] too before starting the search. The Writ can be found on {{NPC||Elder Stormhoof}}'s bluff. Arikara again appears when it is looted:
