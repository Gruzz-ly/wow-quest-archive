== Objectives ==
Unbind the Bound Fury and the Bound Vortex.
*[[Bound Fury]] unbound
*[[Bound Vortex]] unbound

== Description ==
There are two very powerful [[elemental]]s that the [[Twilight's Hammer]] have bound. They are using the bound Fury and Vortex to infuse {{NPC||Animus}} with a great deal of power.

When Animus has absorbed enough of their power, he will explode. The rest of [[Thousand Needles]] and much of the surrounding lands will be obliterated.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*550 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Both the Fury and the Vortex must be unbound! Do you want to be responsible for the deaths of thousands?!

I do not suffer fools gladly, <name>. Complete this simple task!

== Completion ==
A simple task for a simple <boy/girl>. Let's see if you have what it takes to finish the job.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Four Twilight Elements]] before heading out. Find the Bound Fury at {{Co|53.3|59.2|Thousand Needles}} and the Bound Vortex at {{Co|57.4|61.0|Thousand Needles}}.

==Progression==
