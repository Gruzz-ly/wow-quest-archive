== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Scoops of Silithid Goo.
*[[Scoop of Silithid Goo]] x8

== Description ==
Below us is a cave. It's huge! The perfect location for our new refrigerated vault. It's big enough to hold all of our inventory with room to grow.

Unfortunately, when we were almost done equipping all of the pipes, bugs burrowed up out of nowhere and killed all of my employees!

How was I supposed to know?

But it gave me a great idea: [[silithid]]-flavored ice cream. We'll make a killing!

All I need now are the ingredients.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Progress ==
You got enough bug goo for the first batch?

== Completion ==
Oh yeah! This is going to be the greatest flavor in the world!

Look out, [[Tigule]]!!!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[We All Scream for Ice Cream... and then Die!]] before jumping in. Kill the ravagers on the surface, not the hive drones in the hive.

==Progression==
{{Ice Scream}}
