==Objectives==
Slay Elder Stormhoof.
*[[Elder Stormhoof]] slain

==Description==
Elder Stormhoof is a [[shaman]] of immense power. Supposedly, he is a direct disciple of [[Magatha Grimtotem]], the Elder Crone, leader of the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem clan]].

We know that he's here and that he's been training their geomancers. We have to kill him, <class>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Hands of the Chosen|Darkcloud Mask|Spaulders of the Disciple|Legguards of the Pinnacle}}

You will also receive: {{cost|1|15}}

==Progress==
Elder Stormhoof's not dead yet. Let's fix that.

==Completion==
That's two of them. Two more to go.

I wonder what he meant about being "chosen"?

==Notes==
Cross the bridge to the northwest to find him on the next bluff all by himself. He is a level 42 elite with 13210 health and channeling something into the Writ of History. This is a four-phase fight: He starts out with basic melee and gains abilities every 25% health lost. At each phase transition he will Stomp, stunning all units for ten seconds. He first gains Lava Burst at 75%, which is uninterruptable and hits for ~150 Fire. At 50% he gains Chain Lightning, and at 25% he will gain the form of a cliff giant, increasing his damage by 50% and reducing the time between attacks by 100%.

Make sure collect the Writ of History, and to turn this quest in quickly to pick up the next one, Grundig Darkcloud.

Aggro:
:Chosen of the Elder Crone! You don't realize yet, do you? I'll put an end to you first! You and your friend!
75%:
:Spirits of the Firelands, fill me with your rage!
50%:
:Spirits of Skywall, hear my call!
25%:
:Spirits of Deepholm, grant me your strength!
Death:
:Why would she choose.. an outsider?
