==Objectives==
Use the I-Scream Cryocannon to freeze the four pipes inside the cave.
*First pipe frozen
*Second pipe frozen
*Third pipe frozen
*Fourth pipe frozen
*[[I-Scream Cryocannon (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
It's time to break out the I-Scream Cryocannon!

We lifted the tech from the frost cannons on the river boats. If it's one thing that we [[gnome]]s are good at, it's miniaturization by way of making everything else that much bigger!

I need you to take the cannon down there into the cave and freeze the pipes we setup in the walls. That'll jumpstart them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

==Progress==
There are four main pipes already setup in the cave. I need you to freeze each of them so that the refrigerant can start flowing.

==Completion==
Do you hear that, <name>? That's the sweet hum of the refrigeration kicking in.

We'll be able to store our inventory down there in no time. Thank you!

==Notes==
Pick up [[That Smart One's Gotta Go]] before jumping in.
*66.0|86.5|Ping|First pipe
*65.3|87.0|Ping|Second pipe
*65.0|84.5|Ping|Third pipe
*64.9|85.7|Ping|Fourth pipe

This concludes the chain. Head back to the Speedbarge or up to the other areas &mdash; the [[Southsea Holdfast]] and the [[Splithoof Heights]].
