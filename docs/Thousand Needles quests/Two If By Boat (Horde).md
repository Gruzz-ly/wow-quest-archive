Heya, kid, I'll be right with ya. Just gotta shut this {{npc||Fizzle Brassbolts||gnome twerp}} up first. 

== Notes ==
On accept, the player and a brave hop in the last boat and race down the length of the zone. A buff is displayed: Water Traveler &mdash; The Water Traveler is taking you out to the former location of the Mirage Raceway. Who knows what you will find?

The salt flats are under 100 feet of water... and there's a corpse of a {{NPC||Whale Shark (Thousand Needles)||Whale Shark}} in the [[Mirage Abyss]]! Southsea pirates are firing on the speedbarge from [[Southsea Holdfast|their holdfast]] to the southeast. The boat docks on the southeast side of the ship. Head to the stern of the ship, its southwest side. The captain's quarters is up top. Fizzle and Pozzik are in an agitated discussion, as usual.
