== Objectives ==
Collect the Drums of War.
*[[The Drums of War]]

== Description ==
Whatever it is that the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] are doing with these Drums of War, we do not want them to keep them.

Do not worry, <name>, we will figure out what is going on here. But first, we need to gather all of the artifacts. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Progress ==
War is not an activity to engage in for those who are faithful to the Earth Mother's teachings. 

== Completion ==
Surely that was the voice of the Elder Crone!

We must be very careful, <name>. Great danger lies ahead if {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem}} has taken notice of you.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Writ of History]] before starting the search. The drums can be found on the bluff with Grundig Darkcloud, at {{co|34.0|37.1|Thousand Needles}} in the building just south of the bridge leading north. Loot it and Arikara appears yet again:
:Well done, <class>! You can follow simple clues.
:Now, hurry along, little <name>. I've one more challenge to see if you're worthy of the honor.
:Oh, and do be a dear and kill {{NPC||Arnak Grimtotem||Arnak}} for me along the way. He's become something of an embarassment to the family.
:''Arikara flys off to the northeast bluff.''
