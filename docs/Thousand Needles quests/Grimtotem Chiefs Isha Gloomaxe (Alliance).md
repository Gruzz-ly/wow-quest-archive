==Objectives==
Slay Isha Gloomaxe.
*[[Isha Gloomaxe]] slain

==Description==
[[Sentinel]] training 101: take out their leaders and your enemy's forces will soon fall apart. We're going to do just that, <class>.

Isha Gloomaxe is the closest of the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] chiefs. Let's see if we can't take her measure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|15}}
*600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Isha Gloomaxe must meet her end, <name>!

==Completion==
She was tougher than I thought. We worked well together, but we're going to have to make sure not to underestimate the other Grimtotem chiefs.

==Notes==
Pick up [[No Weapons For You! (Alliance)]] and [[Darkcloud Grimtotem (Alliance)]] before heading out. Then start killing. The sentinel can more than hold her own, which is great, as the hostiles often come in groups. Immediately outside of Isha's tent is [[The Rattle of Bones]]. Pick it up to start its' epynonymous quest, [[The Rattle of Bones (Alliance)]].

Isha is a level 42 elite with 8255 health found at {{co|43.8|43.8|Thousand Needles}} on the east side of the pinnacle. The sentinel can hold her own, but will not be able to kill her unassisted, as Isha will enrage after a while and whittle the sentinel's health down.
