== Notes ==
The quest chain in [[Thousand Needles]] begins at [[Westreach Summit]], which is somewhat difficult to reach. This quest is an optional breadcrumb that gives the player a free flight there from either [[Mudsprocket]] in [[Dustwallow Marsh]] (begins with {{npc||Nyse}}) or [[Camp Mojache]] in [[Feralas]] (beings with {{npc||Jawn  Highmesa}}). After you accept the quest, simply talk to the nearby flightmaster ({{npc||Dyslix Silvergrub}}{{co|42.8|72.4|Dustwallow Marsh}} or {{npc||Shyn}}{{co|75.4|44.3|Feralas}} and accept the free flight. (Do not accept a flight from the normal flight map; accept the {{gossip|''Dyslix/Shyn, I need to get to Westreach Summit!''}} option instead.) You will be flown Westreach Summit and dropped off a few yards from {{npc||Kanati Greycloud}}, who will be fighting. Simply ignore the hostile Grimtotem and complete the quest as normal.
