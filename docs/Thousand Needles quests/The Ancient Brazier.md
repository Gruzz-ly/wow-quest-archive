==Objectives==
Reignite the Ancient Brazier and obtain the Sacred Flame.
* The Ancient Brazier reignited
* [[The Sacred Flame]]
* [[Splithoof Brand]] (provided)

==Description==
What do we have here? A <race>? Come to steal our land with your honeyed tongue and promises?

You do not fool me. I have lived a long time, and I know what dealing with your kind means. But the khans do not listen to their elders like they used to.

Since you are here, I will put you to use. When the waters rushed in, the great water spirit, [[Aquarian]], doused the Ancient Brazier deep inside of [[Splithoof Hold]].

Use this brand to reignite the brazier. Aquarian is sure to come. Bring me the Sacred Flame.

("Aquarian: Slay Aquarian to get the Sacred Flame.")

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shroud of Contempt
|Belt of False Promises
|Greaves of the Sacred Flame}}
You will also receive: {{cost||55}}

==Progress==
You have the Sacred Flame? Do not speak to me unless you do, <race>!

==Completion==
You did this favor to ingratiate yourself with me, but I will not sing your praises.

I know what is to come. Where the sea failed, the great air spirit will strike you and your people down for your many transgressions against the [[elements]].

Begone from my sight!

==Notes==
While up on the [[Splithoof Heights]] after [[Negotiations]], Skycaller Vrakthris offers this quest. Splithoof Hold is all the way to the west near [[Razorfen Downs]]. So, before heading west, make sure to complete [[Get Zherin!]] and pick up [[Fool's Gold (quest)]] to save a (rather long) trip! Then, head back down to the water's surface and use the boat to go west, as the old centaur camp is now under water. Not really accessible from up top as the upper level stops being a working path halfway there. It's also full of hostile wildlife.

Splithoof Hold is nestled inside the north face of the valley, with its mouth at {{co|44.0|37.3|Thousand Needles}} north-northwest of [[Freewind Post]]. Take the first left then follow the outside wall of the cave around to the north. At the very back of the cave at {{co|42.0|31.5|Thousand Needles}} is the Ancient Brazier. Use the brand to ignite it. Aquarian, a level 42 water bound water elemental with 3302 health, spawns:
:{{text|yell|Aquarian|I know who you are, <name>! I'll not surrender the Sacred Flame to a filthy meatbag such as yourself!}}
So, kill him. Make sure to loot enough pyrite to complete Fool's Gold before getting back to the surface and using the river boat to get back to Splithoof Heights.
