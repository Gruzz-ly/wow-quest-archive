==Objectives==
Deliver the I-Scream Cryocannon to [[Brivelthwerp]] at the [[Sunken Dig Site]] in [[Thousand Needles]].
*[[I-Scream Cryocannon]] (provided)

==Description==
I recently came into possession of something that needs to be delivered to a gnome that goes by the name, Brivelthwerp. It's more like Briveltwerp if you ask me.

I want you to take it to him in the southwest, down at the Sunken Dig Site. He's up to something and there's moolah involved... I can smell it!

Keep an eye on what he's doing, <name>, and see if you can't get a cut of his profits. A big cut! 

==Progress==
That's not what I think it is? Is it?! 

==Completion==
<Brivelthwerp eyes you up and down, but becomes overjoyed at the site of the special delivery.>

Welcome, friend, welcome! I'm going to give you the chance to get involved at the ground level of a once-in-a-lifetime opportuntity{{sic}}.

The entrepreneurial spirit knows nothing of the differences between the Alliance and the Horde!

Tell me... how do you feel about ice cream? 

==Progression==
