==Objective==
Go to [[Hearthglen]] and find a Box of Scarlet Dye.
*[[Box of Scarlet Dye]]

==Description==
The time for defense is over! We won't win unless we sabotage the competition! Their fuel! Lets see. Firebloom and Rum? THIS IS WHAT [[Gnome|GNOMISH]] INGENUITY IS LOSING TO? STEEPED ALCOHOL? We need to find a way to sabotage the enemy fuel without them noticing. There is a flower of incredible red color, the compounds of the petals are unstable when the smallest amount of heat is applied. The [[Scarlet Crusade]] uses this flower in their dyes. Go to Hearthglen and find me some.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4}}
* 14000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Scarlet Crusade are the only ones who know of the flowers whereabouts! The compounds are strong enough that it should be concentrated enough in their dyes.

==Completion==
You found it! Yes, simply slipping this into the enemies gas tank should cause quite the spectacle! An explosion? No worse! They will be operating at only 76% capacity! And they won't even know it!

==Progression==
