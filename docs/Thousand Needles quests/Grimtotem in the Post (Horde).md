==Objectives==
Slay 10 Grimtotem Invaders.
*[[Grimtotem Invader]] slain (10)

==Description==
You must do away with the [[Grimtotem Invader|Grimtotem invaders]] at [[Freewind Post]]. They brought it on themselves, the cowards!

We can't take the fight to their territory with our back to them. Please help us take back our home, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

==Completion==
It's a good start. Normally, I wouldn't wish harm on any of the Earth Mother's creatures.

But attacking us at our most vulnerable moment?! They deserve to die!

==Notes==
Run up the path to find [[Rau Cliffrunner]] locked in combat with [[Brienna Starglow]]. He offers [[The Brave and the Bold]], so pick it up before heading out. Cross the first two bridges, then circle around back to the east to head to Freewind's upper level to save the brave. Jump down to the water and head back to the southeast to avoid some fighting if desired. Rau offers the follow-up, [[Together Again]].

==Progression==
