==Objectives==
Warn the denizens of {{C|Thousand Needles}} of what you have discovered.

==Description==
<You unfold a torn piece of parchment that reads:>

The tunnels have reached the bluffs above Thousand Needles and our preparations have gone unseen, but we must act swiftly. Send your [[shaman]]; with all that [[Hirzek]] has accomplished we are ready to begin.

The storm will rage, the ground will rumble and the tide shall rise, leaving only carcasses to animate in our wake. Their bones will blaze a trail into...

<The note ends abruptly at the bottom of the torn page.>

==Completion==
<Hmmph... the large [[tauren]] snorts as he reads the parchment.>

One things certain... whoever this note is from is right about their preparations going unseen. We've been too busy dealing with the [[centaur]] and [[Harpy|harpies]] to send out [[wind rider]]s to patrol the canyon and bluffs.

You have our gratitude for alerting us to this threat, but we might still need further assistance.
