==Objectives==
Obtain the Alliance's Proposal.
*[[Alliance's Proposal]]

==Description==
If we're going to get those oil drilling rights, we need to know what the [[Alliance]] is offering. How can we win if we can't do them one better?!

Their negotiator, [[Kravel Koalbeard]], is up there talking with one of their khans right now. Why don't you head up and persuade him to hand over the Alliance's proposal?

You don't have to kill him... we're not savages! Just rough him up a bit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*4,590 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
Do you have the Alliance's proposal? What are they offering for the drilling rights?

==Completion==
What?! How'd they get that much gold to offer?

We don't have that kind of money!
