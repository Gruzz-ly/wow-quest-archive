== Objectives ==
Collect the Writ of History.
*[[The Writ of History]]

== Description ==
In [[shu'halo]] myth, the Rattle of Bones is connected with the Writ of History and the Drums of War. They are supposed to be powerful tauren artifacts.

We must keep our eyes peeled if we're to find the other two. The writ will most likely look like some kind of pictographic scroll if the stories are believed.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Progress ==
We'll need the actual writ, not just any tauren scroll hanging.

== Completion ==
I'm fairly certain that's it. This is very intriguing, <name>. What are they doing here? Are they being used as a weapon?

The wind serpent flew northwest to that next bluff. Maybe that's where the drums are?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Drums of War]] too before starting the search. The Writ can be found on {{NPC||Elder Stormhoof}}'s bluff. Arikara again appears when it is looted:
