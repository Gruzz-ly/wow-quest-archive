== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Fizzle Brassbolts}} at [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

== Description ==
Are you ready to go, <class>? One of the sentinels will take you out to the [[Mirage Raceway]].

If there's anyone left alive out there, please help them.

[[Elune|Goddess]] watch over you!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mirage Amulet
|Maloof's Spare Boots
|Floating Belt
|Bracers of Desperate Need
|Maloof's Spare Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* 530 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

== Completion ==
YES?! Do you see me interrupting your fascinating argument?

No... no, please, go ahead. I'm sure that your interruption is about something very important. More important than dealing with the survival of everyone here, in fact.

<Fizzle taps his foot impatiently.>

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Mirage Amulet|Maloof's Spare Boots|Floating Belt|Bracers of Desperate Need}}

== Notes ==
On accept, the player and a sentinel hop in the last boat and race down the length of the zone. A buff is displayed: Water Traveler &mdash; The Water Traveler is taking you out to the former location of the Mirage Raceway. Who knows what you will find?

The salt flats are under 100 feet of water... and there's a corpse of a {{NPC||Whale Shark (Thousand Needles)||Whale Shark}} in the [[Mirage Abyss]]! Southsea pirates are firing on the speedbarge from [[Southsea Holdfast|their holdfast]] to the southeast. The boat docks on the southeast side of the ship. Head to the stern of the ship, its southwest side. The captain's quarters is up top. Fizzle and Pozzik are in an agitated discussion, as usual.
