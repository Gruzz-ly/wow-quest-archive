== Objectives ==
Deliver the List of Parts to {{NPC||Razzeric}} at [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge]] in [[Thousand Needles]].
*[[List of Parts]] (provided)

== Description ==
Hey there, <name>. I'm {{npc||Pozzik}}, world-renowned rocket car pilot. Welcome to my Speedbarge.

I share your concerns about helping all of Thousand Needles. It's my firm belief that the Speedbarge is the best hope for the entire region.

Perhaps you could help us out a little bit here? I'll make sure that you're equipped with what you need to tackle everything else.

As to that, if you could just run this list of parts over to Razzeric in his shop, you'll be well on your way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 110-1,090 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Is that my list of parts from Pozzik? 

== Completion ==
Heya, pal, mind if I take a look at that list?

<Razzeric nearly spits!>

What's Pozzik thinking? He knows that I don't have even half of that stuff!
== Notes ==
Exit the captain's quarters and take the first left <!--Need direction--> to enter Razzeric's shop. The parts list calls for "Everything, INCLUDING the kitchen sink!"
