==Objectives==
Slay Arnak Grimtotem.
*[[Arnak Grimtotem]] slain

==Description==
And now the time has come to take out the leader of all of the [[Darkcloud Pinnacle]] Grimtotem: Arnak Grimtotem.

It is said that he's the disgraced nephew of [[Magatha Grimtotem]], the Elder Crone and matriarch of the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem clan]]. Supposedly, his indiscretions have left him in a state of disfavor with her.

But none of that matters right now. All that matters is that we kill him. For good this time.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|20}} and {{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Lasting Peace|Hood of Disgrace|Legguards of Disfavor}}

==Progress==
We have to kill Arnak, <name>, if we are able to win the battle for the tauren of [[Freewind Post]].

==Completion==
For some reason they all think that you've been sent by Magatha Grimtotem. I know it must have something to do with that [[wind serpent]] that's been hanging around.

Doesn't matter. Their leader is dead. It's only a matter of time before the tauren of Freewind Post regain their home.

If I were them, I'd push back a little to teach the Grimtotem a lesson, but they probably won't. They're tauren.

==Notes==
Make sure to loot the Drums of War from the building south of the bridge heading north before leaving. Head north, take a right, then a left to reach the north cliff face. Arnak can be found at {{co|37.8|26.6|Thousand Needles}} out on the surface (and not in the cave). He is a level 43 elite with 8850 health. Don't let the health be a deception... he will cast [[Commanding Shout]] and summon assistance with each 25% of health lost. First, two stompers, then two reavers and finally two geomancers.

Aggro:
:You're the one my aunt sent? A test, no doubt. I'll kill you quickly and prove myself to her once again.
75%:
:Stompers, defend your Chieftain!
50%:
:Reavers, at my side!
25%:
:Geomancers, bury them in stone and flame!
Death:
:NO! Magatha, forgive me! Bring me back!

==Progression==
