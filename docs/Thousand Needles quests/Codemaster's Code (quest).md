== Objectives ==
Obtain the Codemaster's Code.
*[[Codemaster's Code]]

== Description ==
<Name>, the bonds holding {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem||Magatha}} are specially encoded. She can only be released if we get those codes.

There's a device near {{NPC||Codemaster Deethuk}} in the [[Twilight Bulwark|Bulwark]] to the southeast. It contains the codes.

Please obtain them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

== Progress ==
Do you have the codes to the Elder Crone's bonds?

== Completion ==
Good. Now there's only one thing left to do.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Behind You!]] before heading out to acquire the [[Bulwark Disguise]], which will make this much easier. The code device is at {{co|31.2|59.8|Thousand Needles}} to the southwest of the ramp heading up, but before reaching the bigger camp to the southwest.

His code is the [[wikipedia:Fibonacci sequence|Fibonacci sequence]]...

==Progression==
{{Magatha rising}}
