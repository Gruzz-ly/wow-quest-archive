==Objectives==
Sink 15 Southsea Rowboats.
*[[Southsea Rowboat|Rowboats]] sunk (15)

==Description==
The fires are dealt with, but there are still [[Southsea Freebooters|Southsea pirate]]s getting ready to board [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge|the Speedbarge]].

Time to switch to the other side cannon and sink them before it's too late!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

}}

==Completion==
You saved my Speedbarge!

<Razzeric embraces you in a manly hug!>

I can't begin to tell you how relieved I am, Captain <name>!

==Notes==
Turn the camera around so it's facing away from the speedbarge this time and start taking out the rowboats with the Fire Cannon's sole ability:
*{{abilities|Fire Cannon|range=100|Fire the cannon at the Southsea boarder's rowboats.}}
After sinking 15, get off the river boat and head back to the speedbarge. Exiting the boat will launch players back to the barge, dropping them off on deck. Return to Razzeric to turn in.
