*[[Twilight Skymaster Richtofen]] dealt with

==Description==
Twilight Skymaster Richtofen is at the Twilight Aerie up above and to the southeast. No matter what we do down here, if he's not dealt with, all hope is lost for [[Highperch]].

While Heartrazor is too injured to help you with the fight, he can fly you there. The rest is up to you, <name>.

Good luck.

==Progress==
<Name>, you must take care of Twilight Skymaster Richtofen!

==Completion==
The pridelings did what? They must love you deeply for freeing them.

Thank you, <name>. You've saved Highperch!

==Notes==
Hop on Heartrazor, who will fly players to the southeast. Dropped off at {{co|16.1|45.6|Thousand Needles}} southwest of the Twilight Aerie proper, head along the ridge to the southeast to find Richtofen at {{co|19.5|48.8|Thousand Needles}} in the center of camp. He is a level 44 human with 3137 health.

:{{text|yell|Twilight Skymaster Richtofen|It will be a pleasure shooting you down!}}
''Take him down to fifty percent health and the wind rider shakes him off and flies away!''
:{{text|yell|Twilight Skymaster Richtofen|Useless wind rider! I don't need you anyway!}}
:''Take him down below 10% health and... the Pridelings will come in to finish him off!
:{{text|yell|Twilight Skymaster Richtofen|What's this? Shoo!}}
:{{text|yell|Twilight Skymaster Richtofen|No! Get away! Get off of me!}}
:''Richtofen starts running to shake them, to no avail. Enough of the pridelings get enough of a hold to lift him off of the ground, headed in the direction of the cliff!''
:{{text|yell|Twilight Skymaster Richtofen|NOOOOO!}}
:''Reaching open air, the pridelings drop him!''
:{{text|yell|Twilight Skymaster Richtofen|Aaaaaiiiiiiiiii......!}}
:''They come back to where they player fought Richtofen to celebrate, before flying back in the direction of Heartrazor. Use Heartrazor for the free ride back to Pao'ka.
