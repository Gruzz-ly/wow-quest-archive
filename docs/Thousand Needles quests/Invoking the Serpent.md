==Objectives==
Defeat Arikara.
*[[Arikara]] defeated
*[[Shu'halo Artifacts]] (provided)

==Description==
I am familiar with these artifacts. I believe that they were brought here by {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem}} herself. But she's not amongst the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] on [[Darkcloud Pinnacle]]. She disappeared right after she arrived, and no one knows where she is now.

Maybe we can find out.

Take the rattle, the writ, and the drum out to [[Arikara's Needle]]. If my guess is correct, the [[wind serpent]] will appear again. You'll have to defeat it to gain knowledge of where Magatha is hiding.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Windsong Rifle
|Mantle of Invocation
|Wind Serpent Bracers
|Ring of the Subduer
|Windserpent Fang
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|20}} 
*625 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with {{Alliance}} [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]] / {{Horde}} [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Only by subduing Arikara will you discover where Magatha Grimtotem is hiding.

==Completion==
So, she's been taken prisoner by the [[Twilight's Hammer]]. I can't say that I feel sorry for her, but she might prove even more dangerous in their hands.

==Notes==
Exit the cave, cross the bridge, take a left. At {{co|38.1|35.3|Thousand Needles}} in the center of Arikara's Needle, use the artifacts. She is a level 43 elite wind serpent with 10984 health. Her primary ability is Lightning Bolt, which hits for ~140 Nature. Every 20% or so, a Grimtotem Spirit will spawn, applying Ancestral Fortitude to Arikara, shielding it for 100% of damage taken. Kill it to drop the shield, then keep working Arikara down.
Aggro:
:{{text|yell|Arikara|Thank you for the gifts. Let us see if you are worthy, <class>!}}
First shield:
:{{text|say|Feralas Sentinel|The creature is gaining power from the ancestral Grimtotem! We must put them to rest if we are to defeat the beast!}}
:{{text|say|Freewind Brave|The creature is gaining power from the ancestral Grimtotem! We must put them to rest if we are to defeat the beast!}}
:Victory:
:{{text|yell|Arikara|Stop! You have bested my wind serpent.}}
:{{text|yell|Arikara|I have been taken prisoner by the [[Twilight's Hammer]].}}
:{{text|yell|Arikara|I'm not certain where. Start with their western base overlooking [[Highperch]].}}
On complete:
:{{text|say|Feralas Sentinel|Farewell for now.}}
:{{text|say|Freewind Brave|Farewell for now.}}

==Progression==
{{Freeing Freewind}}

Completion of this quest then gives you the next quest in the series, [[Trouble at Highperch]].
