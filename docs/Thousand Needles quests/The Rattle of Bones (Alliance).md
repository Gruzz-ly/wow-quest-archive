== Objectives ==
Give the Rattle of Bones to the {{NPC||Feralas Sentinel}} at [[Darkcloud Pinnacle]] in [[Thousand Needles]].
*[[The Rattle of Bones]] (provided)

== Description ==
A [[tauren]] rattle lays here, exuding supernatural power. It's keepers slain, the artifact is undefended.

Perhaps the sentinel will have some insight into its significance?

("Perhaps the sentinel will have information concerning the Rattle of Bones?")

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Progress ==
That's the fabled Rattle of Bones, <name>!

== Completion ==
It's true then! What is it doing here, though? And if it's here, that must mean that the writ and the drums are also nearby!

Maybe there's some link between it and the [[wind serpent]] that just appeared? I think that I've an idea what that creature is as well.

== Notes ==
On Accept, Arikara, an elite wind serpent spawns and hovers over the player and the sentinel for a few seconds before flying away to the northwest.
