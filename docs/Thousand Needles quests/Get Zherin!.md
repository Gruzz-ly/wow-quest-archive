== Objectives ==
Obtain the Horde's Proposal.
*[[Horde's Proposal]]

== Description ==
If we're going to get those oil drilling rights, we need to know what the [[Horde]] is offering. How can we win if we don't do them one better?!

Their negotiatior, {{NPC||Trackmaster Zherin}}, is up there talking to one of their khans right now. Why don't you head up and persuade him to hand over the Horde's proposal?

You don't have to kill him... we're not savages! Just rough him up a bit.

("Trackmaster Zherin: Get the Horde's proposal from him!")

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Progress ==
Do you have the Horde's proposal? What are they offering for the drilling rights?

== Completion ==
What?! How'd they get that much gold to offer?

We don't have that kind of money!

== Notes ==
Up top, {{NPC||Skycaller Vrakthris}} can be found at {{co|90.1|53.0|Thousand Needles}} by a bonfire in the clearing offering [[The Ancient Brazier]]. Just to the east of Vrakthris is Trackmaster Zherin, inside a tent, at {{co|91.1|53.7|Thousand Needles}} speaking with {{NPC||Khan Ablinh}}. Take him down to 1 health and...
:{{text|bossemote|Trackmaster Zherin is stunned. Steal the Horde's Proposal now!}}
Loot him and get out!
