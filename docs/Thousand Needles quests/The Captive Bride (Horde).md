== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Lakota Windsong}} at [[Darkcloud Pinnacle]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

== Description ==
Lakota Windsong! Why did I not think of this before?

{{NPC||Arnak Grimtotem||Arnak}} kidnapped Lakota years ago and tried to force her to be his bride. With help, she was able to escape, but in the chaos of the recent attack on [[Freewind Post]], he took her again.

She must be near. She has become quite the shaman in recent years. I am sure that she will understand the significance of the rattle, the writ, and the drums.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||60}}

== Completion ==
It is embarrassing to have been kidnapped by Arnak again. I heard the fighting outside. Did you kill him?

<The [[shaman]] looks sad for just a moment.>

I am happy to be free once more. Now, how can I help you, <class>?

== Notes ==
Now head in the cave.
