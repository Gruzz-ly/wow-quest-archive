==Objectives==
Slay Isha Gloomaxe.
*[[Isha Gloomaxe]] slain

==Description==
Basic [[brave]] philosophy dictates that if you kill the leaders and your enemy's forces, they will soon fall into disarray. We are going to do just that, <class>.

Isha Gloomaxe is the closest of the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] chiefs. We will test her and her axe, and she will be found wanting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|15}}
*600-6,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Isha Gloomaxe must meet her end, <name>!

==Completion==
She was more formidable than her reputation suggested. Although we worked well together, we must make certain not to underestimate the other Grimtotem chiefs.

==Notes==
Pick up [[No Weapons For You! (Horde)]] and [[Darkcloud Grimtotem (Horde)]] before heading out. Then start killing. The brave can more than hold his own, which is great, as the hostiles often come in groups. Immediately outside of Isha's tent is [[The Rattle of Bones]]. Pick it up to start its' eponymous quest, [[The Rattle of Bones (Horde)]].

Isha is a level 42 elite with 8255 health found at {{co|43.8|43.8|Thousand Needles}} on the east side of the pinnacle. The brave can hold his own, but will not be able to kill her unassisted, as Isha will enrage after a while and whittle the brave's health down.
