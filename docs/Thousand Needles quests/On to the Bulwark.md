== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Lakota Windsong}} at the [[Twilight Bulwark]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

== Description ==
<Name>, while you and the pridelings were taking care of {{NPC||Twilight Skymaster Richtofen||the skymaster}}, Lakota Windsong came by. She told me to tell you to meet her east at the Twilight Bulwark.

That must be where they're holding {{NPC||Magatha Grimtotem}}.

== Completion ==
I'm glad that you made it.

Don't mind my new clothes. It seemed prudent to blend in.

== Notes ==
Run out, hop on the river boat, and head southeast to reach [[Freewind Post]]. Due south of Freewind is a Cataclysm-induced rockslide that took out some of the southern cliff and now serves as a path from water level up to the Twilight Bulwark. Lakota is there, just above the water.
