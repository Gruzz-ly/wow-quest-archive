==Objectives==
Speak with [[Riznek]] at the [[Splithoof Heights]] in [[Thousand Needles]].

==Description==
<Name>, great job defending the [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge|Speedbarge]]! I've got something else that I need you to help out with.

I've sent Crazzle Sprysprocket and [[Trackmaster Zherin]] to negotiate with the [[centaur]] survivors! Their Splithoof Heights is dripping with oil!

I figure those smelly half horses won't know what they've got and we'll get the rights to pump up that black gold for a song, but I'd feel better if you took charge of the talks.

What do you say?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*110-1,140 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Completion==
<Riznek gets a gleam in his eye.>

I've got Trackmaster Zherin up there talking to one of their chiefs, but now that you're here, we'll have the rights to pump up their oil in no time!

==Notes==
Before heading out, search the ship and pick up all of [[Quiet the Cannons (Horde)]], [[Where's Synge?]], [[A Little Payback (Horde)]] and [[Special Delivery for Brivelthwerp (Horde)]]. Before or after completing the [[Southsea Holdfast]] chains, head northeast to the Splithoof Heights. A river boat can be found anchored just off-shore, and there's both a gnomish and goblin camp up the hill. Riznek can be found at {{co|88.6|54.8|Thousand Needles}} all the way to the east.
