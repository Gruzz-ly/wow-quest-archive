== Objectives ==
Rescue the Feralas Sentinel.
*{{NPC||Captured Feralas Sentinel}} freed

== Description ==
<{{NPC||Brienna Starglow||Brienna}} waves a note around with [[Taur-ahe]] markings on it.>

[[Grimtotem tribe|Those monsters]] have captured one of our sentinels! They're threatening to kill her if we don't pull back!

We don't negotiate with cowardly beasts! Please, if you can, rescue her before it's too late, <class>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||55}}

== Progress ==
Where's the sentinel? Is she still alive?

== Completion ==
Thank you for freeing her, <name>. Those Grimtotem monsters would have killed her in cold blood.

== Notes ==
Running up the path to start killing Grimtotem for [[Grimtotem in the Post]], Brienna offers this quest. Head in to the post, killing invaders along the way. After crossing the second bridge, loop back to the upper level of Freewind Post to find and free the sentinel. She can be found at {{co|45.2|50.2|Thousand Needles}} in the center of the needle. Interact with her to take the chains from her wrists.
:{{text|say|Feralas Sentinel|Ishnu-alah, <class>. Good fortune to you.}}
:{{text|say|Feralas Sentinel|I will rejoin you soon. We will teach these Grimtotem savages the meaning of honor.}}
Return to the southwest (jump down into the water!) to turn in.
