==Objectives==
Burn 8 Grimtotem Weapon Racks.
*[[Grimtotem Weapon Rack|Weapon racks]] burned (8)

==Description==
The [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] want to fight? Let us see how well they do without their weapons.

I'm sure you must have something that burns. Set their weapon racks ablaze, my <class> friend.

Let nature take its course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*480-4,820 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We'll need to destroy more of their weapon racks if we're going to put a dent in their ability to fight.

==Completion==
Let us see how well they fight without their weapons.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Darkcloud Grimtotem]] and [[Grimtotem Chiefs: Isha Gloomaxe]] before heading out. Then start killing. The brave can more than hold his own, which is great, as the hostiles often come in groups. Immediately outside of Isha's tent is The Rattle of Bones. Pick it up to start its' eponymous quest, [[The Rattle of Bones]].

Don't focus on burning weapon racks to the detriment of anything else. There's going to be plenty of time.
