== Description ==
Now that the "gold" is ready, I want you to take it up to Khan Ablinh. He'll be so overwhelmed, I bet he'll offer to help us setup the drilling rigs. We could use the horsepower.

Haha, get it? Horsepower?

What's this? That is a lot of gold you have there.

== Completion ==
Just put it on the ground, <race>.
