==Notes==
Elder Skyseer is found in [[Freewind Post]], at {{co|46.3|51|Thousand Needles}}, a short way from the bridge to the lifts. This Elder, like all of the others, is illuminated by a shaft of light from the sky. This Elder gives locations for [[Elder Dreamseer]], [[Elder Morningdew]], [[Elder Runetotem]], and [[Elder Wildmane]].
