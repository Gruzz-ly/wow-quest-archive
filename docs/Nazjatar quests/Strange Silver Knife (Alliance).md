==Objectives==
Ask the [[Ankoan]] about the knife.
* [[Silver Knife]] (provided)

==Description==
<This silver knife is small and lightly decorated, you found it inside of a [[chest]]. 

It was more likely used for eating or preparing [[food]] than combat. What would the [[naga]] need with such a thing?

One of the Ankoan may know more...>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
What do you have there?

Ah, yes, you found this within one of the chests? We have found similar things inside of them -- finery, decorative platters, and the like. Perhaps they do not belong to the naga? It is a mystery.
