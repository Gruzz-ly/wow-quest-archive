==Objectives==
Enjoy [[Neri's Spot]].

==Description==
Since the waterwall appeared, so much has changed here. 

There is a little spot I found, where you can feel the sea spray on your face. 

Sometimes I just ride over there and relax.

I will show it to you, if you'd like.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
