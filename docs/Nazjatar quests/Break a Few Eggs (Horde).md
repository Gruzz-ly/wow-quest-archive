Destroy 10 Deepcoil Eggs.
* [[Deepcoil Egg]] destroyed (10)

==Description==
This chamber is lovely and terrifying. 

What is born here will ruin the lives of so many. 

We cannot hurt the pods, but we can destroy the eggs of the serpents that guard them.

Take out the eggs, every little bit helps.

Poor eggs...

==Rewards==

* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Completion==
The fewer creepy flying snakes we have guarding the [[naga]], the better.
