==Objectives==
Collect Chitterspine Roe and feed it to Savage Snapdragons.
* [[Savage Snapdragon]]s fed (8)
* [[Chitterspine Roe]] (999)

==Description==
It's time for the [[snapdragon]]s to feed, but it's a job best left to someone a little more expendable.

The beasts will eat anything, including your arm if you don't move it away quickly enough.

Luckily for you, they've developed a taste for Chitterspine Roe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
Don't come back here until you've finished your task.

==Completion==
I'm surprised they didn't make a meal out of you.
