==Objectives==
Loot the Mystic Chest.
* [[Mystic Chest]] looted

==Description==
The [[naga]] have stashed away treasures all over [[Nazjatar]].

Not long ago, I noticed an ornately crafted treasure chest hidden in plain view. The area is heavily fortified, but such minor inconveniences have not stopped us yet.

We should head back there and liberate the contents of the cache.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
