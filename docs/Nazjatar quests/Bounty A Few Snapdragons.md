==Objectives==
Kill 10 snapdragons.
* [[Snapdragon]]s slain  (10)

==Description==
Snapdragons are one of the most dangerous species on [[Nazjatar]]. The [[naga]] breed them for the viciousness and their ability as [[tracker]]s.

If we hope to keep our positions hidden from the naga, we must take out these groups of snapdragons immediately.

After you are done, report to the quartermaster to claim your reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
