==Objectives==
Visit [[Atolia Seapearl]], in [[Newhome]], for your gift.

==Description==
It has been so long since we have been able to trust anyone not in our little pack of survivors.

I forgot how good it feels.

Thank you for reminding me.

Atolia should have the rest of your gift together by now. We should go check in with her!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Unshackled Commendation Crate

==Completion==
You know, if everyone on the land is as great as you, maybe we should visit once we are all free.

It isn't much, but I hope you find something useful here!
