==Objectives==
Seal <5 / 6 / 7> Unstable Geysers and slay the Disturbed Algan.
* [[Unstable Geyser]] sealed (5)
* [[Disturbed Algan]] slain
*[[Benthic Sealant]] (provided)

==Description==
;1
The geysers are dangerously unstable and will be erupting any moment now.

I fear that [[Queen Azshara|Azshara's]] misuse of the [[Tidestone|Tidestone]] is causing irreparable damage to the elements within [[Nazjatar]].

We have to do what we can to prevent any further destruction.

Take this sealant and use it to stave off the next round of eruptions. In the meantime, I will do what I can to stabilize the elements.

;2
There are several geysers nearby that will be erupting soon.

Unfortunately, the elements in this area are not stable enough to handle the force of the eruptions.

I need someone to plug the geysers while I use the elements to redirect the pressure to a safer area of Nazjatar.

Take this sealant and use it to plug the geysers while I work to restore the elemental balance.

;3
The elements are becoming increasingly unstable due to Azshara's abuse of the Tidestone.

Geysers will be erupting nearby at any moment. Each eruption threatens to destroy the delicate balance of life on the surface.

Take this sealant and use it to plug the geysers while I work to restore the elemental balance and redistribute the explosive underground pressure to a safer location.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*2x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]
*100x [[Nazjatar Ally - Farseer Ori]]

==Progress==
Have the geysers been sealed?

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. Thanks to your help sealing the geysers, I've been able to stabilize the elements and redirect the pressure to a safer location.
