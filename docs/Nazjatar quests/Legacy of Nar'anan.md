==Objectives==
Activate the [[Memory Pylon]]s in [[Nar'anan]] and witness what happened.
* Memories witnessed (3)

==Description==
Hey there, <race>. Mind helping me out?

You see, I found these pylons here and it seems they contain memories from a notable [[Highborne]] who lived here long ago.

I can't get any closer to the rest of em' because of the [[snapdragon]]s. Especially the terrormaws...

Can you go and activate the pylons for me? We [[Tortollan]]s love old things, and this is a potential goldmine!

Oh, and be sure to write down what you see!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
What did you learn?

==Completion==
Let me see what you got. 

<Collector Kojo reads your notes... slowly>

I think we may have just found the origin of Snapdragons! Let's see what else we can learn.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|Come on... blasted thing.}}
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|This one is on the fritz... I can't hear a thing. Stupid elven trinkets...}}

;On accept of both
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|I can't wait to hear about your findings!}}
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|Some ancient records I found elsewhere seemed to point towards a [[wolf]] population here. I wonder what happened to them...}}
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|No matter, they probably all drowned when the city went shell-down.}}

;First pylon activated
:''A vision of [[Professor Elryna]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Professor Elryna|Azshara has requested that I formulate new... creations.}}
:{{Text|say|Professor Elryna|The wolves to the north may prove to be suitable hosts...}}
:{{Text|say|Professor Elryna|Although, I worry about creations we cannot control.}}

;Second pylon activated
:''A vision of [[Novice Magus|Novice Magi]] and Professor Elryna appears.''
:{{Text|say|Professor Elryna|Students, round up as many of the local wolves as you can at once!}}
:{{Text|say|Professor Elryna|Azshara's advisor will be visiting soon. Make haste or she will have our heads!}}

;Third pylon activated
:''A vision of [[General Huxzar]] and Professor Elryna appears.''
:{{Text|say|Professor Elryna|Nice to meet you, General Huxzar.}}
:{{Text|say|General Huxzar|Silence, mage! I am here for results... not pleasantries.}}
:{{Text|say|General Huxzar|Now, I was told you had created something called a... snapdragon. Azshara has shown keen interest in this development. Show me at once!}}
:{{Text|say|Professor Elryna|Erm... of course. Right this way...}}
