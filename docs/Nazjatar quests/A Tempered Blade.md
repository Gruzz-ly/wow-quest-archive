==Objectives==
Slay 15 naga with [[Bladesman Inowari]].
* [[Naga]] forces slain  (15)
* Return to [[Mezzamere]]

==Description==
These blades that I wield are newly forged. The time has come to temper them in the blood of my enemies.

I have heard that you are skilled in the ways of battle. I too am proficient in the business of death and I would be honored to fight at your side.

Accompany me, <class>, and together we will spill the blood of our enemies.

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{Abilities|World Quests|id=304905|icon=inv_tabard_ankoan}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
A blade is not worthy of a warrior until it is tempered in the blood of the enemy.

==Completion==
It was an honor to fight by your side, <name>. If you should have need of me in the future, you need only ask.
