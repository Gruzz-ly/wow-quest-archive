Kill 10 [[Makrura]].
* [[Kil'karrok]] slain  (10)

==Description==
We [[Ankoan]] are a small [[tribe]]. There are not that many of us remaining.

This place was once overrun with makrura, before [[Utama]]. They tried to hide here, from the naga, but found the makrura. They fell, in battle, to the Kil'karrok.

If you wish to show your dedication to the Ankoan, become a force of vengeance in Utama's memory. Destroy the makrura.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
We remember Utama. And honor their memory here.

==Completion==
You do Utama great honor by killing his foes.

==Notes==
