==Objectives==
Rescue Fenn, Kono, and Esma from the clutches of mind-leeching [[Lesser Zoatroid|Zoatroids]].
* [[Fenn]] rescued
* [[Kono Kelpcurl|Kono]] rescued
* [[Esma Lostfin|Esma]] rescued

==Description==
The [[Gilgoblin|kelfin]] are no strangers to [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s cruelty.

She commands creatures of darkness that entrap my kind and warp their minds. They eat away at their memories until nothing's left but an empty husk.

If you can get to them soon, perhaps they'll still be in a state worth saving.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
I thought I'd die in that cave. Sometimes, I wished it.

Thank you for getting me out of there, <name>.

==Notes==
*Rescue [[Mind-Shackled Kelfin]]s in the [[Deepsea Slave Pen]].
