==Objectives==
Collect 10 Fathom Flesh.
* [[Fathom Flesh]] (10)
* [[Fathom Hook]] (provided)

==Description==
I am grateful for the help that your [[Alliance]] has given my people, but we are desperately short on food and supplies.

If we do not gather enough supplies to take care of both the Alliance and [[Waveblade Ankoan|my clan]], we will run out of food within the week.

Thankfully, there appears to be an abundance of [[fathom ray]]s in the area, but I will need help hunting them in order to gather enough food for our camp.

Take this fathom hook and use it to pull down the fathom rays from above.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*2x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]
*100x [[Nazjatar Ally - Hunter Akana]]

==Progress==
Have you returned from the hunt?

==Completion==
You have brought back a hefty supply of fathom meat. I will make sure that it gets hauled back to camp. Thank you for your service, <class>.

;Objectives
Collect fathom ray meat from the nearby field.

*[[Moist Fathom Flesh]]

;Description
When we're doing our job right, we always have more mouths to feed!

If you could help with my stock, we could care for even more.

Big, strong friends are what this revolution needs!
