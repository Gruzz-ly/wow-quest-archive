==Objectives==
Collect 3 Poisonous Spiral Leaf.
* [[Poisonous Spiral Leaf]] (3)

==Description==
We are dangerously low on our medicine stores. If you find any Spiral Leaf, please leave your stores with the quartermaster.

I should warn you, Spiral Leaf is immensely poisonous. Make sure to handle it with care. Some symptoms of spiral leaf poisoning include bouts of rage, immense bursts of strength, and murderous impulses. If you are exposed, find some [[naga]] and use your murderous energy for good.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
