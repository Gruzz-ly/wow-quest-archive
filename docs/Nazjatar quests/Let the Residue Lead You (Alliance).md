==Objectives==
Follow the residue trail to locate the Azerite Weapons Cache.
* [[Azerite Weapons Cache]] located
* [[Residue Detector]] (provided)

==Description==
I have fashioned a device that will emit bioluminescent light when toggled on, allowing you to see any [[:Azerite]] residue that lingers.

It should give you a clear trail to the weapons cache.

Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
<Although tightly sealed, the radiating energy and weight suggest that the crate contains Azerite weapons.>
