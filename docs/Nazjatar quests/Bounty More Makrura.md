==Objectives==
Kill 15 makrura.
* [[Makrura]] slain (15)

==Description==
The [[makrura]] have been a thorn in our side for too long. They are aggressive towards almost all species in [[Nazjatar]] and are very dangerous in groups. Less of them in our waters would certainly benefit our cause.

Once you are done, report to the quartermaster to claim your reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|q1=103|Azerite
|q2=25|War Resources
|q3=3|Prismatic Manapearl
|q4=111|Azerite
}}

==Progress==
I know it is dirty work, but someone must do it.

==Completion==
This will ease our efforts in Nazjatar.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Alga the Eyeless]], [[Allseer Oma'kil]], [[Broken Deepshell]]s, [[Deepshell Captive]]s, [[Elder Unu]], [[Kil'karrok Commander]]s, [[Kil'karrok Hammerclaw]]s, [[Kil'karrok Hunter]]s, [[Kil'karrok Makrura]], [[Kil'karrok Scavenger]]s, [[Kil'karrok Seer]]s, [[Kil'karrok Seers]], and [[Kil'karrok Tidal Shaman]].
