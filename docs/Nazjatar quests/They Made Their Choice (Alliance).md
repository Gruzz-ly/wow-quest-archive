==Objectives==
Aid [[Shandris Feathermoon]].
*[[Abyssal Commander Sivara]] confronted
*Speak with [[Janius]]

==Description==
It wasn't enough for [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] to break the [[Azeroth|world]]. She had to doom the rest of our people here as well!

Those who didn't choose to become [[naga]] were stuck in this horrifying half death, left to haunt these drowned ruins.

I am almost afraid of what we will find if we do find my friend.

Wait, did you hear something?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
Thrice damned Azshara. Her evil knows no bounds.

==Completion==
I cannot thank you enough for helping me say farewell to my friend, <name>. I am in your debt.

==Notes==
:''The [[Image of Queen Azshara]] appears again, with [[Janius]] at her side. A huge [[naga centaur]] rushes forward to stand in front of Janius.''
{{text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|But I digress. You hoped to be reunited with a lost loved one. Allow me to grant your wish.}}
:''Confront [[Abyssal Commander Sivara]]:''
{{text|yell|Abyssal Commander Sivara|For Queen Azshara!}}
:''In case the player dies:''
:{{Text|yell|Abyssal Commander Sivara|Worthless scum. You are unfit to grovel before my queen.}}
:''After a few moments:''
{{text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|Enough, Sivara. My subjects cannot grovel if they are dead. I will allow them one final chance to kneel before my throne.}}
:''Sivara backs down and returns the way she came, and Azshara's image fades once again, leaving Janius alone. Shandris runs to him.''
{{text|yell|Shandris Feathermoon|Janius!}}

:''Speak with Janius:''
I got lost. They brought me here. I... I think that was a long time ago.

I lost my friend Shandris. I was supposed to watch her but we got separated. I can't leave until I find her.

{{gossip|Shandris is alive and here. Be at peace.}}
:''Janius transforms into a [[wisp]] and goes upwards.''
{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Be at peace, my dear friend.}}

==Progression==
