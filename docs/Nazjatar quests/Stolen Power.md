==Objectives==
Collect 8 Scrolls of Shirakess.
* [[Scroll of Shirakess]] (8)

==Description==
From the [[void]] these [[naga]] pull their strength.

Each scroll they record, shared knowledge -- that knowledge is power.

It stands to reason, if we take away their knowledge, we steal their power.

My logic may be flawed, but let's do it anyway!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Did you get all of the scrolls?

==Completion==
Take away a little magic, get a little weaker.

If nothing else, we will win this war through erosion.
