==Objectives==
Show the Mottled Hydra Scale to Artisan Itanu in Mezzamere in Nazjatar.
* [[Mottled Hydra Scale (item)]]

==Description==
<The scale of a recently-defeated [[hydra]] hatchling, it appears to be a mixture of several colors.

There appears to be a battle for dominance between the hydra of the region, one of your new allies may know more.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Ah, a hydra scale, we do have a fair bit of them around here.

They have three matriarchs leading their packs. Each one has attempted to gain dominance over the area for years, yet they always fail.

The [[naga]] amuse themselves by sending [[slave]]s into the area to be devoured.

They are friends of none, we had best leave them be.

==Progression==
