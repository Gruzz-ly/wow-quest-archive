==Objectives==
Disrupt all activities in the [[Shirakess Repository]].
*Shirakess Disruption

==Description==
This place is the source of all of our corruption. 

The [[kelfin]] are taken and broken here. 

Hit them where it hurts. Break their power, kill every [[naga]] you see, wreak havoc!

Every little crack we make, weakens their foundation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*2x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]
*100x [[Nazjatar Ally - Vim Brineheart]]

==Progress==
{{Stub-section}}

==Completion==
It's going to take them a while to clean that up, <name>!

I love watching them scurry.

==Notes==
Objectives are:
* [[Void Orb]] dispersed
* [[Shirakess Subjugator]]
* [[Shirakess Voidreaver]]
* [[Shirakess Enthraller]]
* [[Void Power Core|Power Core disrupted]]
* [[Shirakess Apprentice]]
* [[Shirakess Overseer]]
* [[Hand of Darkness]]
* [[Broken Blackfin]]
*[[Shirakess Voidreaver]]s and [[Shirakess Enthraller]]s also give credit.
