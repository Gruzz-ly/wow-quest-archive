==Objectives==
Show the Pearlescent Shell to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Mezzamere]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Pearlescent Shell (item)]]

==Description==
<A large, hardened shell of a vanquished [[hermit crab]].

The shell itself was much larger than the [[crab]], and shines in different colors when you look at it at different angles.

Surely someone back at Mezzamere would be interested in this beautiful shell.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Ah, a hermit crab shell. The crabs here are not easy to hunt, nor are they worthwhile. The size of the crab is so small, barely makes for a single meal.

The shells themselves are quite useful. We use them in making spear tips, shields, even cookware and pots. They are quite versatile and do not lose their durability with time.

I shall add this one to the supplies, with our thanks.

==Progression==
