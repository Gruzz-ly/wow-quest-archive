==Objectives==
Jump off the falls.
* Leap off the waterfall

==Description==
We've lost the bulk of our forces already; any more and we won't have enough to make a stand.

This wreckage won't keep the [[naga]] at bay, so we must find safety elsewhere.

You will have to trust me here, <name>. Leap off the falls and you will descend safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Never give up.

==Completion==
Thank you for giving me your trust.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:''[[Shandris Feathermoon]] runs up to [[Genn Greymane]] and Jaina Proudmoore.''
