==Objectives==
Loot the Lambent Lockbox.
* [[Lambent Lockbox]] looted

==Description==
There are many treasures hidden throughout [[Nazjatar]].

Recently, I spotted an object glinting from within a cave not far from here. It appeared to be some sort of lockbox.

I suggest we head back and investigate. There may be valuable items inside that will help us in our battle against the [[naga]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
