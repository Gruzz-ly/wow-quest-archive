Loot the Mystic Chest.
* [[Mystic Chest]] looted

==Description==
The [[naga]] have hidden many useful treasures throughout [[Nazjatar]].

I have heard tell that there is a treasure hoard not far from here. It will be dangerous, but it may be worth investigating.

There may be untold valuables inside the cache that could aid us in our fight against the naga.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
