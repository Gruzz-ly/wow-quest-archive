==Objectives==
Rescue 7 captive soldiers in [[Spears of Azshara]].
* [[Honorbound Captive]]s rescued (7)

==Description==
<Name>, I am glad to see that you survived the wreck. Many were not as fortunate...

I am capable of stalling the enemy here for now, but this position is not defensible long term.

We need to find somewhere safe for our forces.

Once we have taken measure of the wounded we will push on. In the meantime, find as many survivors as you can.

[[Nazjatar]] will claim no more [[Horde]] lives today!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Save as many as you can. We are sorely outnumbered here.

==Completion==
So few.... It will have to suffice. Without you, we would be even fewer.

==Notes==
;Once [[Fortunate Souls (Horde)]], [[Disruption of Power (Horde)]] and [[Dark Tides (Horde)]] have been accepted
:{{Text|Say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Return quickly. I can only hold this barrier for so long.}}

;Returning to Thalyssra and Lor'themar
