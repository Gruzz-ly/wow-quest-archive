==Objectives==
Show the Opaline Conch to [[Finder Palta]] in [[Newhome]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Opaline Conch (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<The conch slumps following your assault -- the battle appears to be over.

It doesn't move. You bend over and pick it up, instinctively turning it over, wary of any attack.

It appears to be dead, but intact. You consider bringing the entire conch back to your allies in Newhome.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Oh, hey, that's a giant conch, right? Let me see that.

<Palta flips the conch over and pulls the innards out by the antennae.>

That's the stuff. Look at it! Full-slime, all scales, this one is going to be great.

I'll prepare this for the meal tonight, that should lift some spirits. Nothing like a slice of spireshell to remind you of home.

Thanks for bringing this.

<Palta nods at you.>
