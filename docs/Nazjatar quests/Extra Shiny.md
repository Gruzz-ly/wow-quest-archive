==Objectives==
Collect 10 Imbued Pearls.
* [[Imbued Pearl]] (10)

==Description==
In the pools below are some small, lovely pearls.

They were tossed in during some [[Azsh'ari]] ritual.

Do they mean something? I have no idea. But I would like to have some of them.

Be a lovely heavyfoot and go grab some for me, please!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Did you find all of the pearls?

==Completion==
I can feel them glowing! They tingle through my hand and into the ocean floor.

Very lovely.
