* [[Mottled Hydra Scale (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<The scale of a recently-defeated [[hydra]] hatchling, it appears to be a mixture of several colors.

There appears to be a battle for dominance between the hydra of the region, one of your new allies may know more.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You'd like to know a little about the hydra of the area? Not much to tell, truth be told.

There are three matriarchs, they've been battling for dominance of the area for generations.

Sometimes, the [[naga]] throw [[slave]]s to them, for their amusement.

They don't serve anyone, just themselves. The depths aren't aligned against you, newcomer. They're just... hostile to outsiders.
