==Objectives==
Put 8 Tortured [[Soul]]s to rest.
* [[Tortured Soul]] slain (8)

==Description==
Countless lives were lost in the [[Great Sundering]] when [[Zin-Azshari|this great city]] was plunged into the depths of the abyss.

The fortunate among us died quickly in the explosion, but some survived only to cling onto dear life as the cold, unforgiving ocean waves crashed down upon them.

Those poor, unfortunate souls suffer a fate worse than death to this day. They drown endlessly, forced to relive the torture of their death.

Put them to rest so that they may have peace at last.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
I hear them as we speak... crying out for help. Yet, I am powerless to save them...

==Completion==
They will never gain back the lives they lost that day so long ago, but at least they will suffer no longer.
