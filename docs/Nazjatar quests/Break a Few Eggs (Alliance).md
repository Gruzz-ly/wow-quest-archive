==Objectives==
Destroy 10 Deepcoil Eggs.
* [[Deepcoil Egg]] destroyed (10)

==Description==
The [[naga]] are using these caverns as a hatchery for their deadly [[Deepcoil Serpent|deepcoil serpent]]s.

These deepcoil serpents are especially dangerous because they have been infused with dark [[void]] [[magic]].

We must put a stop to this operation before it is too late. The naga forces are already quite powerful. I do not wish to imagine what would happen if [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] also had an army of these deepcoil serpents as well.

Our only hope is to destroy the deepcoil eggs before they hatch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Have you destroyed the deepcoil eggs?

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>. We cannot allow the naga to amass an army of these mutated deepcoil serpents. We will need to keep a close eye on this place...

==Patch changes==
