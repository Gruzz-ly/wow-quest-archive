# Just A Friend

{{Questbox
 | id = 56803
 | name = Just A Friend
 | category = Nazjatar
 | faction = Horde
 | level = {{level|Nazjatar}}
 | levelreq = {{level|Nazjatar}}
 | start = [[Vim Brineheart]]

}}

==Objectives==
Visit [[Atolia Seapearl]] in [[Newhome]].

==Description==
Look, mudfoot, I need to make sure a slight current isn't going to knock you over.

I asked Atolia to see if she could pull together some things to make you a little less useless here.

After what I saw in that last fight, we should probably head back sooner rather than later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Nazjatar Survival Pack
}}

==Completion==
As an observation, that you're still putting up with that grump is laudable.

I will see what else I can find, in case you guys are still working together later.

I'm rooting for you.

==Notes==
The quest becomes available when Vim Brineheart reaches rank 2.

==Patch changes==
