'''Wild Tame''' becomes available after leveling [[Hunter Akana]] to Rank 20.

==Objectives==
Accept a gift from your companion.

==Description==
In our time together, I have learned much. Both about my own abilities, and about your people.

You are selfless in the face of challenge, much like our own. I consider us kin.

For some time, I have been training a [[snapdragon]] I found as a pup. He is a worthy [[mount]], and I have been waiting for a worthy hunter to ride him. I believe I have found that hunter.

Here, he is yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Deepcoral Snapdragon]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with the [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Take care when feeding him, the poison is no less lethal to a friend.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
