==Objectives==
Solve [[Mad Mardivas|Mardivas]]' [[arcane]] puzzle to unlock the enchanted lock.
* [[Arcane Device|Match 3 purple runes]] to unlock the lock

==Description==
<The lock appears to be secured by a [[magic]]al mechanism.

It is clearly one of Mardivas', and from what you can surmise from reading the journals, it is likely locked via an arcane puzzle.

You look around the room, and see something odd in the water.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with {{Alliance}} [[Waveblade Ankoan]] / {{Horde}} [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
<The lock hums.>

==Completion==
<With the puzzle complete, the lock springs open with a satisfying click.

It seems that Mardivas' devised a series of similar such puzzles with which to secure his belongings.>

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Arcane Device (Nazjatar)|Arcane Device]] found on the ground near the lock.

==Progression==
{{Mardivas' Puzzles}}
