==Objectives==
Show the Leathery Venom Gland to [[Finder Palta]] in [[Newhome]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Leathery Venom Gland (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<You pry a leathery gland from the [[snapdragon]] corpse. Drops of venom spill from an opening on one end and sizzle as they touch the ground, leaving small holes behind.

This toxin appears to be very potent. It would be best to bring it back to Newhome.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Is that a venom gland in your pocket or... why is that in your pocket? You know how potent those things are, right?

Yeah, the snapdragons have been a pain in our side for a long time. The [[naga]] can easily sway them with their mind-bending tricks, or even just meat, they're not very smart creatures. A few good meals and they're as good as tamed.

I've heard of a naga [[Commander (rank)|commander]] that can handle the venom in combat. Rumor has it she even eats the stuff.

Hope I never meet her!
