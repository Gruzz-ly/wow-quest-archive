==Objectives==
Locate Arylina's diary.
* [[Arylina's Diary]]

==Description==
Have we met before? I'm sorry... but I don't remember your name.

My name is... Arylina... I think. My memory has been so foggy since the [[Great Sundering|great explosion]] happened that sent us underwater.

Oh! But look! I can see the [[sun]] and the stars again... I wonder what happened?

I used to keep a diary, but I can't find it anywhere. If I just had my diary back, I'm sure I could remember more.

Will you help me find it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
Where did I put that diary?

==Completion==
Oh... I remember now. This all happened so long ago. I think it's time for me to rest...

==Trivia==
*During early PTR, this quest was named '''Recovered Memories'''.
