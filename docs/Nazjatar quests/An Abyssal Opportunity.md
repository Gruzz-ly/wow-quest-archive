==Objectives==
Acquire 15 Abyssal Shards from <[[Artisan Okata]] / [[Finder Pruc]]>.
* [[Abyssal Shard (item)]] (15)

==Description==
I believe, <name>, we can use this thing to make our armor stronger. By redirecting its power, we can take the strength of our crafts to a new level.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves. The first thing we need to do is repair this device.

It'll require some powerful materials to fix it, and those are usually carried by the stronger creatures of this region.

However, <Artisan Okata  / Finder Pruc> is great at collecting materials like the ones we need. I'd check with him to see what he's got.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Abyssal Focus]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]] / [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt for the materials?

==Completion==
This should be plenty, <name>. I'll get started on repairing it right away.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Rolm|I bet if I just line this up here... and a those over there... yea! Got it!}}

==Progression==
