==Objectives==
Assault the [[naga]] camp and seize control of the [[:Tidestone of Golganneth]].
*Sound the advance
*Assault the [[Gorgonian Overlook]]
*[[Commander Kresh]] slain
*Throw the Javelin of Suramar
*[[Lady Zharessa]] slain

==Description==
We are out of time. We must gain control the Tidestone of Golganneth and the [[Javelins of Suramar|Javelin]] is our best shot at piercing the barrier surrounding it.

The guardian is formidable, but must be defeated if we are to take the fight to Azshara. What forces we have will be arrayed below, just outside their encampment.

I would trust you with the Javelin of Suramar, <name>. We will need your strength in the coming battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
*25x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]

==Completion==
Quickly, the Tidestone!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Very well. Genn will gather our troops. We will meet you near the Tidestone.}}

;Arriving at the destination
The Alliance group include [[Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Genn Greymane]], [[Blademaster Okani]], and [[Alliance Skirmisher]]s. Horde group consists of Lor'themar, Thalyssra, [[Atolia Seapearl]], and [[Horde Skirmisher]]s.
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Ah, <name>, you've arrived. Perfect timing...}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|We plan to secure the Tidestone. I advise you to stay out of our way.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This is our best opportunity to seize the Tidestone from Azshara's grasp.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Their champion holds the Javelin of Suramar. We should hear what they have to say.}}

;Speaking with Jaina
So few, but we are strong. We must prevail.

Are you ready to begin the assault?

{{Gossip|I am ready. Sound the advance!}}

:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Jaina, our troops stand no chance against the Tidestone's guardian. Lor'themar and I will deal with the rest of the naga while you confront her.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Our champion bears the Javelin. We must ensure it strikes true. First Arcanist, if you shield me while I attack, we stand a better chance of succeeding.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|A sound plan. We face a formidable foe.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Coordination between our forces is the best strategy. But know that any duplicity will be met with retribution.}}
:''The group marches towards the Gorgonian Overlook.''

;Entering Gorgonian Overlook
:''The player is joined by Genn and Lor'themar.''
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Champion, with me. I would have you by my side when we take the camp.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|As you wish, Greymane. Your champion does not frighten me.}}

To fill up the bar, kill [[Zanj'ir Defender]]s, [[Zanj'ir Bulwark]]s, [[Azsh'ari Stormwitch]]es and interact with [[Barricade (Nazjatar)|Barricades]] and [[Scroll of Aquatic Abjuration|Scrolls of Aquatic Abjuration]].

*{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Impressive, Greymane. A pity we never had the honor of facing one another on the battlefield.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|How fortunate that we never did. It would have been a waste to kill you.}}

*{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Hmph. You fight well... for an elf.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|And you fight well for a wolf.}}

;Bar filled
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Our forces will deal with the remaining naga. Let us take the fight to their leader.}}

;Kresh attacked and killed
:{{Text|say|Commander Kresh|Perish, landwalker!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Now, champion! Hurl the Javelin!}}

Use the extra button to throw the javelin. A scene plays out.

Jaina and Thalyssra are no longer under a protective barrier but attacked Zharessa.

:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|Merely glimpsing my queen's visage would strike you blind.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|Impudent wretches! You shall all drown!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|Nazjatar will be your grave!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|No! I... cannot fail... my queen....}}

;Upon completion
:''A scene plays out. Lor'themar, Jaina, Thalyssra, and Genn walk towards the Tidestone.''
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Azshara's forces are routed. We have broken her hold on the Tidestone.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Our way into the palace remains blocked.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The Tidestone's power could be used to shatter the barrier...}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|But I cannot control its energies on my own.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Perhaps we could... together.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|So be it.}}
:''Jaina and Thalyssra channel a spell through the Tidestone and shatter the barrier.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|It is done. The way is open.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Azshara's reign must end.}}
