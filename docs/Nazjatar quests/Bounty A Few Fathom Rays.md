==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[fathom ray]]s.
* Fathom Rays slain  (10)

==Description==
The fathom ray population is eating all of the coral buds to the east. If we do not cull their numbers, we may have an environmental catastrophe on our hands.

Once you have finished, report to the quartermaster to claim your reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
