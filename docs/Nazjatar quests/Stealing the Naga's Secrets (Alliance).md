==Objectives==
Steal the [[:Azerite]] weaponry and fight your way out of [[Zanj'ir Terrace]]!
* [[Azerite Trident]]
* [[Zanj'ir]] forces slain (15)

==Description==
<Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the blades have been forged from Azerite.

Weapons of this power should never be in the hands of the [[naga]].>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
I recognize the craftsmanship. This is [[Priscilla Ashvane]]'s work.  

She must have taught the naga how to forge Azerite weaponry, but why?

==Completion==
We cannot expect to succeed in any battle where our enemies are using Azerite weaponry.

No, we must find a way to even the playing field.

==Notes==
Upon accept, you gain the Azerite Weaponry buff.

Eligible mobs are [[Zanj'ir Trapper]]s, [[Azsh'ari Wavebreaker]]s, [[Azsh'ari Invoker]]s, [[Savage Snapdragon]]s, [[Zanj'ir Punisher]]s, [[Zanj'ir Brawler]]s, [[Scaleguard Commander]]s, [[Zanj'ir Scaleguard]]s, [[Zanj'ir Centurion]]s, [[Zanj'ir Tidelord]]s, [[Mind-Shackled Kelfin]]s, and [[Zanj'ir Myrmidon]]s.

:{{Text|say|Zanj'ir Myrmidon|Drop that weapon, landwalker!}}
:{{Text|say|Bladesman Inowari|We must fight our way out.}}

On return, [[Jaina Proudmoore]] and [[Blademaster Okani]] are in the cave.
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|<Name>! Adaru told me of your task. What were you able to find?}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It's safe to assume that the naga are keeping a stockpile of these weapons somewhere nearby.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|If we can locate their cache, we can strip them of their arsenal and arm our own forces.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Blademaster Okani has offered to aid us. Let's ensure the ankoans have whatever they require.}}
