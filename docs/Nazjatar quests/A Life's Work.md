==Description==
<A voice whispers to you from beyond the veil of death.>

I spent more than one-thousand years researching the mysteries of the arcane before the [[Great Sundering]] tore [[Azeroth|our world]] apart.

I perished amidst the destruction and my work was lost.

Search the area for my ancient writings and put my [[Ghost|spirit]] to rest...

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
The bookcase appears empty...

==Completion==
With the arcane tomes and ancient scrolls restored to the bookcase, it feels as though a long held weight has been lifted from your shoulders.
