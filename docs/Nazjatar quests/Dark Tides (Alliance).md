==Objectives==
Slay Tidemistress Ethendriss.
*[[Tidemistress Ethendriss]] slain

==Description==
A tidemistress leads some nefarious ritual above a pool.

Do not look in the pool when we approach it, or you will be rewarded with a view of our drowned allies.

We must put a stop to this ritual. The tidemistress is key.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|7th Legionnaire's Claymore
|7th Legionnaire's Dagger
|7th Legionnaire's Greathammer
|7th Legionnaire's Halberd

}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
We must not underestimate this tidemistress.

==Completion==
The ritual ceased as soon as we killed the tidemistress.

==Notes==
Once [[Dark Tides (Alliance)]], [[Disruption of Power (Alliance)]] and [[Fortunate Souls (Alliance)]] have been accepted, a few [[naga]] will rush the survivors.
