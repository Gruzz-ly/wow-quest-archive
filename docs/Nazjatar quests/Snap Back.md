==Objectives==
Use the Scroll of Busting Power on [[Snapdragon Terrormaw]]s and slay snapdragons in [[Nar'anan]].
* [[Scroll of Bursting Power]] tested (3)
* [[Snapdragon]]s slain (10)

==Description==
I have a favor to ask of you, if you would be so kind.

[[Scrollsage Nola]] gave me this scroll to protect me on my adventures here in [[Nazjatar]]. She is a kind soul, but her scroll-work isn't always the most...accurate.

You look like a brave [[adventurer]] who's seen a thing or two. Could you test out the scroll for me? While you're there you may as well cull their numbers a tad.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Did you test out the scroll for me?

==Completion==
Wow! That powerful huh? 

I will be sure to keep this with me then!

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|Come on... blasted thing.}}
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|This one is on the fritz... I can't hear a thing. Stupid elven trinkets...}}

;On accept of both
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|I can't wait to hear about your findings!}}
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|Some ancient records I found elsewhere seemed to point towards a [[wolf]] population here. I wonder what happened to them...}}
:{{Text|say|Collector Kojo|No matter, they probably all drowned when the city went shell-down.}}
