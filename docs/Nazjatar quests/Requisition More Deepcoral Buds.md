==Objectives==
Collect 5 Deepcoral Buds.
* [[Deepcoral Bud]] (5)

==Description==
Many species feed on the deepcoral buds from the tall columns that grow in the east. [[Fathom ray]]s feed on these buds especially. We use the buds as lures for fathom rays to use as [[mount]]s. But with our stores so low, we will not be able to provide the air support we need across [[Nazjatar]].

If you could gather more Deepcoral Buds and return them to the quartermaster, you will surely be rewarded.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
