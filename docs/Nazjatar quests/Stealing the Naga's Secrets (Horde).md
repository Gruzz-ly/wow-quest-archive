==Objectives==
Steal the [[:Azerite]] weaponry and fight your way out of [[Zanj'ir Terrace]]!
* [[Azerite Trident]]
* [[Zanj'ir]] forces slain (15)

==Description==
<Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the blades have been forged from Azerite.

Weapons of this power should never be in the hands of the [[naga]].>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
I recognize the craftsmanship. This is [[Priscilla Ashvane]]'s work.

She must have taught the naga how to forge Azerite weaponry, but why?

==Completion==
We cannot expect to succeed in any battle where our enemies are using Azerite weaponry.

No, we must find a way to even the playing field.

==Notes==
;Loot the trident
:{{Text|say|Zanj'ir Myrmidon|Drop that weapon, landwalker!}}
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Looks like we get to fight our way out of here!}}

*The Azerite Weaponry buff is applied. Eligible mobs are [[Zanj'ir Scaleguard]]s, [[Zanj'ir Trapper]]s, [[Azsh'ari Wavebreaker]]s, [[Azsh'ari Invoker]]s, [[Zanj'ir Myrmidon]]s, [[Savage Snapdragon]]s, [[Zanj'ir Punisher]]s, [[Zanj'ir Brawler]]s, [[Scaleguard Commander]]s, [[Zanj'ir Centurion]]s, [[Zanj'ir Tidelord]]s, and [[Mind-Shackled Kelfin]]s.

;Approaching Lor'themar
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|<Name>! Fenn informed me of your incursion into the naga camp. What have you found?}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|It is safe to assume that the naga are maintaining an arsenal of these weapons.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|If we can determine where they are being stored, we can seize them for ourselves and arm [[Unshackled|our allies]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Oculeth]] has devised a method to detect trace amounts of Azerite. Provide him with whatever he needs to do so.}}
