==Objectives==
Ask [[Rolm]] about the [[tentacle]]s of the [[Zin'anthid]].
* [[Zin'anthid Tentacle#Horde]]

==Description==
<Having handled zin'anthid for a while now, you pluck one of its tentacles from the main body. As you do, the tentacle retracts, spiraling in on itself preventing you from getting to the blooms that reside along it. Perhaps Rolm will have more insight on how to keep this herb from defending itself.>

==Rewards==
You will also learn: [[Herbalism Technique: Zin'anthid (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
Zin'anthids are no mere plant, <name>. They are living beings and as such, know when a predator is trying to harvest them. And yes, even in death they defend themselves.
If you wish to harvest all they have to offer, you must lure them into a false sense of security. Here, let me show you a technique I know.
