==Objectives==
Meet [[First Arcanist Thalyssra|Thalyssra]] and [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]] in [[Nazjatar]].

I can keep this barrier up here for a time after our departure, but we cannot remain here.

These soldiers will not be safe for long.

We must go deeper into this place to seek a more defensible position.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Careful! Don't draw attention.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Our forces are vastly outnumbered. We cannot hold this position.}}
:{{Text|Say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We must move quickly.}}

Upon completion, a horn is sounded in the distance...
