==Objectives==
Ask [[Instructor Ulooaka]] about the Osmenite Dust.
* [[Osmenite Dust]] (provided)

==Description==
<Picking away at the ore, you notice that much of it seems to turn to dust and fall to the floor at your feet. Enough even, that had it held its shape, would be enough to craft something with.

It may be worth talking to Instructor Ulooaka to see if there's a way to prevent this loss from happening.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining Technique: Osmenite Seam (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
The seams that osmenite flows through are structurally different than that of their mere deposits.

If you want to harvest the full amount of osmenite from a seam, you'll have to ignore the ore all together and go for the rock surrounding it.

It's a bit counter to how you normally mine, but trust me, you'll be pleasantly surprised with the results.
