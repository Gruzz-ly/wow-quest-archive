==Objectives==
Show the Molted Spineshell to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Mezzamere]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Molted Spineshell (item)]]

==Description==
<The molted shell of a defeated [[spine crab]], a vicious species of [[crab]] first encountered in Nazjatar.

The spines that stick out from it are quite sharp.

Artisan Itanu may have some use for this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
That is quite a pretty shell, we find them around when the spine crabs molt.

Spine crabs lurk in the deep trenches, waiting on large [[fish]] to spear and devour. The [[beast]]s of our waters are not as kind as yours.

The shells themselves are not useful to us -- they become flimsy and brittle over time.

Once, the [[child]]ren would fill them with sand and hang them on the coral as decorations.

That was long ago.

<Itanu tosses the shell into the sand with a deep sigh.>
