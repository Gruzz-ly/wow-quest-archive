==Objectives==
Collect 10 Neptulian Clams.
* [[Neptulian Clam]] (10)
*[[Rift Diver]] (provided)

==Description==
This pool is filled with creepy [[fish]].

It is also the home of some of the most delicious clams you will ever eat. Fresh water somehow mixes into the ocean water in this one part of [[Nazjatar]], and that gives the meat a totally new flavor.

Every now and then, we come down here and collect them for our friends in [[Newhome]].

We could sure use some help with all these extra mouths to feed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Did you find enough?

==Completion==
Everyone is going to be so happy!

Thank you!
