==Objectives==
Rescue 7 captive [[soldier]]s in [[Spears of Azshara]].
* [[7th Legion Captive (Nazjatar)|7th Legion Captives]] rescued (7)

==Description==
You and I survived the attack and have thus far evaded capture by the enemy.

Not all were as fortunate.

There are many of our allies now under the control of the [[naga]]. We must free them before they are killed or suffer an even worse fate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
We are outnumbered, but we are not outclassed.

==Completion==
Our army was devastated, but we will rebuild.

==Notes==
Once [[Dark Tides (Alliance)]], [[Disruption of Power (Alliance)]] and [[Fortunate Souls (Alliance)]] have been accepted, a few [[naga]] will rush the survivors.
