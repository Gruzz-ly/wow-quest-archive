==Objectives==
Ask [[Rolm]] about the shriveled leather hide.
* [[Shriveled Leather Hide#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
<Having skinned countless creatures, you can't help but notice how much usable leather is lost when the skin is dried and tanned. The [[Unshackled]] seem to have a solid understanding of using the material, perhaps Rolm could share some of his insights.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Skinning Technique: Dredged Leather (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
Ah, yeah, sorry about that. We are so used to working with these materials, I forgot to explain how to prevent that. See, these [[beast]]s are usually underwater all the time, and the air dries them unevenly. When you skin the beast, roll the skin as you harvest it. That'll rehydrate it enough to prevent waste.
