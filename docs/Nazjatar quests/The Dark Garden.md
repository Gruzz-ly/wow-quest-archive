==Objectives==
Kill [[naga]] and release the poor tortured creatures held in the Imperial Garden.
*Clean up the [[Imperial Gardens]].

==Description==
Look, <name>, I know we have bigger battles ahead, but these gardens are horrific.

Innocent creatures captured and imprisoned for the naga's amusement.

They bring them out, torture them, change them, break them... you get the idea.

Help me free those the naga have taken, and punish them for their hubris!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I'm pretty sure I heard an [[otter]] giggle as it ran past. 

Your fighting skills were most rad.

==Notes==
*To fill up the bar,
**kill [[Imperial Shaper]]s, [[Zanj'ir Myrmidon]]s, [[Zanj'ir Brute]]s, [[Imperial Cultivator]]s, [[High Cultivator Zareth]], 
**interact with [[Petrified Reefwalker]]s and [[Water Prison]]s.

==Patch changes==
