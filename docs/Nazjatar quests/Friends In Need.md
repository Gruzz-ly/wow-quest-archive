==Objectives==
Support your [[Combat allies|allies]] in [[Nazjatar]] by gaining 3000{{sic}} experience combined between [[Farseer Ori]], [[Hunter Akana]], and [[Bladesman Inowari]].
* Gain 2400 combined experience for your [[Ankoan]] allies
* Return to [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] in Nazjatar.

==Description==
I doubt that will be the last we've seen of [[Priscilla Ashvane|Priscilla]], but at least she is no longer one of our immediate concerns.

We must think carefully before making our next move. In the meantime we should continue to build upon our relationship with our new allies, the Ankoan. Work with them to secure the area and hone their skills, we're not out of the woods yet.

I fear the biggest battle is still to come. Let's show them that together we can take on [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s forces and succeed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
*[[Pearl of Manifest Ambitions]]

==Progress==
Have you lent your aid to our allies?

==Completion==
Good work, while you were gone [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] and I have been talking and I think she's found a promising lead for us to focus our efforts.

==Notes==
;Completion
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Elune-Adore, hero. Our new allies have proven to be quite resourceful. With their help, we have formed a new plan of action.}}

Originally, the objective was 3,000 experience.

==Progression==
