==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Mgglurky]]'s Mugglrgl from [[Bloodfin Village]].
* [[Mgglurky's Mugglrgl (item)]]

==Description==
My [[cook]], Mgglurky, lost his mugglrgl and he's refusing to work until he gets it back.

I've got a bar full of hungry [[murloc]]s and nothing to feed them until Mgglurky starts cooking. If Mgglurky doesn't find his mugglrgl soon, we're going to have a riot on our hands!

I don't know about you, but I definitely don't want to be the main course tonight.

There were some [[Bloodfin tribe|Bloodfins]] lurking around earlier. Search Bloodfin Village for the mugglrgl and bring it back to me once you find it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
If Mgglurky doesn't find his mugglrgl soon, we're going to have a riot on our hands!

==Completion==
You've found it! So this is a mugglrgl? For some reason I thought it would be bigger. Mgglurky will be happy you returned it!
