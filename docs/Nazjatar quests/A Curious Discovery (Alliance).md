==Objectives==
Bring the Enchanting Crystal to [[Instructor Okanu]] in [[Mezzamere]].
*[[Enchanting Crystal (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<This crystal shines with a mesmerizing light that you find difficult to avert your gaze from.

Perhaps the [[Ankoan]] would be able to tell you more about it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
*[[Prismatic Crystal (item)]]

==Completion==
I've seen these crystals in a couple of places, often with a strange [[Ooze|slime]] nearby. Clearly there is a link between the two but I have yet to discover it. 

At any rate, the only use of these crystals I have found is to hypnotize tiny creatures for a while.

Sorry, that does not help you much but you can have your crystal back. Let me know if you figure anything else out.
