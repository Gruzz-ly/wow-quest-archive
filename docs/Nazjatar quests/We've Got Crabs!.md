==Objectives==
Collect 12 Crackleclaw Crabs.
*[[Crackleclaw Crab (item)]] (12)

==Description==
<Name>, you're just in time. Everything's ready for the [[crab]] hunt!

Okay, okay... I know what you're thinking. A founding member of [[D.E.H.T.A.]] that condones hunting?

I'm going to level with you, <name>. I've got a bar full of hungry [[murloc]]s that only eat three things: crabs, [[fish]], and people.

If that's not reason enough, crabs are overpopulated in this region and they're decimating the local grub worm population!

How many innocent grub worms need to die before we do something, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
How many innocent grub worms need to die before we do something, <name>?

==Completion==
That's quite the case of crabs you've got there, <name>. Well done! Please set it down behind the bar and I'll take care of the rest.

==Notes==
With flying, you can hover above the crabs and click on them.
