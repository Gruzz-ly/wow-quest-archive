This [[Fourth War|war]] has cost us dearly, but victory will soon be in our grasp.

What remains of the [[Horde]] fleet has departed [[Zuldazar]] and our spies say that the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]]'s hand sails at their helm.

This is our chance, <name>! With one strike we can eliminate what remains of their fleet and rid [[Azeroth]] of [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Blightcaller]]'s filth once and for all!

The fleet is preparing to depart, report to the Harbormaster when you are ready to set sail.

You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
Never could I have expected this...

==Notes==
Speak to [[Cyrus Crestfall]]:
:We just finished loading supplies onto the last ship. You can tell Greymane the fleet's ready to depart at any time.
:{{Gossip|Greymane is waiting, I'm ready to set sail.}}

Once you tell him you're ready, a cinematic plays:
<vplayer />
:{{#vlink:SszpZF8KCN8|Rise of Azshara cinematic (Alliance)}}

:''On the Horde's ship, Nathanos, wielding [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire]] and Lor'themar Theron are staring out at the docks. The camera shifts up revealing the Alliance fleet are after them.''
:'''Genn Greymane''': {{Text|Bossemote|Keep on them! We cannot let them escape!}}
:''The Aerial shot of the Alliance fleet chasing the Horde Fleet then zooms down into a shot of The Eternal Palace. Inside, The Naga Centuar reports to Queen Azshara who's staring at her reflection at the waterfall''.
:'''Naga Centuar''': {{Text|Bossemote|My queen...they have arrived.}}
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|Wonderful! Set the tidestone, won't you?}}
:''The Naga Centaur leaves. Azshara looks back seeing the shadowy tendrils''
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|Feeling Anxious, are we?}}
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|How frustrating it must be for you...still locked away.}}
:''The shadowy tendrils comes closer''
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|so powerless For now. Do not worry.}}
:''She turns to see the shadowy tendrils''
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|We've both waited so long...but at last...You're about to see what I do best.}}}
:''The sequence shifts to the Naga Centuar placing the [[Tidestone of Golganneth]] on the pedestal. It begins to glow creating a beam up top.''
:''The beam comes out of the sea. Nathanos smiled seeing this.''
:''Genn Greymane and the Alliance soldier reacted in horror as a massive rift in the ocean is created.''
:''The Alliance ship heads towards the rift''
:'''Alliance Soldier''': {{Text|Bossemote|She's not responding!}}
:'''Genn Greymane''': {{Text|Bossemote|Set the sails! Set the sails!}}
:''The Sails are pulled up but it was effortless''
:'''Alliance Soldier''': {{Text|Bossemote|We can't escape!}}
:''Genn Greymane hangs on but the Alliance ship fell and crashed. He then wakes up and he sees his fleet fell into the area as Queen Azshara laughs.''
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|Welcome to Nazjatar. I've been waiting for you.}}

After the loading screen:
:''You wake up at [[Tide's Fall]]. In front of you, Genn is attacked by a [[Zanj'ir Myrmidon]] and an [[Azsh'ari Siegemistress]]. He switches to [[worgen]] form and makes quick work of them.''
:{{Text|Say|Genn Greymane|You should have stayed in the water, snake!}}
:''He changes back, but sounds disheartened.''
:{{Text|Say|Genn Greymane|So many dead.}}
