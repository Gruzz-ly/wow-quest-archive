==Objectives==
Loot the Mysterious Cache.
* [[Mysterious Cache]] looted

==Description==
There are many treasures to be found throughout the [[naga]] stronghold of [[Nazjatar]].

Some time ago, I noticed a mysterious looking [[chest]]. The area was heavily fortified with naga troops, so whatever it contains must be valuable.

We should go back and investigate the chest. Whatever is inside is better used in our hands than the hands of the enemy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
