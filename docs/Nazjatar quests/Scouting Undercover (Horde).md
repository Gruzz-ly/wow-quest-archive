==Objectives==
Scout [[Zanj'ir Terrace]] while pretending to be mind-shackled.
* [[Zoatroid (Nazjatar)|Disguise]] obtained

==Description==
Entering the stronghold alone would be a death wish.

The [[Zanj'ir]] slaughter outsiders on sight.

The only way to get in without being killed is to appear to be under the effects of a [[Merciless one|zoatroid]].

Even then, the mind-shackled are put to work.

You must obey all commands, or they will know your mind is still your own.

Once the Zanj'ir believe you are mind-shackled, it should be easier to navigate their domain and uncover their secret.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
What use are you to us if you're not working?
