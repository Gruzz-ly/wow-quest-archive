==Objectives==
Activate the Elemental Essence Amalgamator in [[Mardivas's Laboratory]].
* [[Elemental Essence Amalgamator]] activated
* Elemental Creation Killed

==Description==
<Several pages are devoted to notes on an experiment, a hastily written journal entry follows.>

At last, my research into the base elements has begun to bear fruit!

With careful application of the right base reagents and some [[arcane]] power I've managed to combine the essence of the elements in such a way as to create [[life]]!

Further investigation will be needed to determine what the various mixes of the elements will yield.

<The writing ends here.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* +500 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* +500 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
*5x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]

==Progress==
<The remaining pages are filled with gibberish and strange doodies.>

==Completion==
<The magic of the system appears to have been drained. Perhaps after some time has passed it can be used again.>
