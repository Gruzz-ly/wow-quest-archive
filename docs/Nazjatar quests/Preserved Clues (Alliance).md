==Objectives==
Search in [[Zin-Azshari]] for information about the strange [[Arcane Chest|arcane chests]].

==Description==
We have found similar [[chest]]s, as you describe. We believe they were left behind by one that came before the [[naga]].

Some are even locked by odd [[arcane]] [[rune]]s, the naga seem most interested in those.

I know little about them, save that we find them most often in the city ruins.

If you seek to decipher their history, I would begin there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
<A simple tome with a small series of runes inscribed along the spine, it appears remarkably well-maintained amongst the ruins.

Upon further inspection, it appears to be a diary of one of the [[Commoner|citizens]] of the city. No doubt the magic that preserves it was intended to allot for the lengthy lifetimes of the elves.>
