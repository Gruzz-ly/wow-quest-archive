==Objectives==
Show the Molted Spineshell to [[Finder Palta]] in [[Newhome]] in [[Nazjatar]].
*[[Molted Spineshell (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<The molted shell of a defeated [[spine crab]], a vicious species of [[crab]] first encountered in Nazjatar.

The spines that stick out from it are quite sharp.

Finder Palta may have some use for this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with the [[Unshackled]]

==Completion==
A spine crab shell? We find them around, though I try to stay away from the dark places myself.

That's where they live, you see? The spine crabs lurk in the darkness, waiting for fish to spear. Once I saw a group of them skewer a [[whale shark]]! 

When they devour prey, they make a chittering noise -- I hate it.

The shells themselves aren't very useful -- they get brittle and shatter easily.

Watch!

<Palta flings the shell against a nearby rock, shattering it to pieces.>

Woo-ha!
