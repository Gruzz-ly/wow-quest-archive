==Objectives==
Collect 10 Neptulian Clams.
* [[Neptulian Clam]] (10)
*[[Rift Diver]] (provided)

==Description==
Neptulian clams are an important part of the [[ankoan]] diet.

Many forget how important proper nutrition is during a time of war. A [[warrior]] can be armed with the finest weapons and training, but if she is not healthy and well-nourished she will be ineffective in battle.

Now that [[Mezzamere]] is home to your [[Alliance]], we must work hard to gather enough food to feed our [[soldier]]s.

Gather as many Neptulian clams as you can find and I will see that they make it back to camp safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Have you gathered the Neptulian clams?

==Completion==
These will serve us well.

Thank you, <class>.
