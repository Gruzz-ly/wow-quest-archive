==Objectives==
Locate Apprentice Odari at [[Dragon's Teeth Basin]].
* [[Apprentice Odari]] found

==Description==
Pardon me, <class>. I am in need of your assistance.

Our [[shaman]], [[Farseer Ori]], left the camp some days ago to investigate a nearby disturbance in the [[Elemental|elements]]. He took his apprentice with him, a young initiate named Odari. Neither have returned.

I am leading an expedition to find them and return them here safely. [[Nazjatar]] is full of dangers. The skills of an accomplished <class> like yourself could prove most useful.

Will you help me return the lost shaman to safety?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
It is good you are here. We must speak quickly. I fear for the safety of my master...
