==Objectives==
Find the special weaponry within [[Zanj'ir Terrace]].

==Description==
For a squid head, you sure are making my life easier.

I guess you get to live long enough to complete another task.

Our new weapons are forged from some [[Azerite|foreign material]] that I don't quite trust.

You won't catch me sharpening any blades, but the work still needs to get done.

Get to it!

You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
<The weapons on the rack radiate with a familiar energy.>

==Progression==
{{Secrets in the Sea Horde}}

==Patch changes==
