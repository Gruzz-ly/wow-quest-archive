==Objectives==
Escort Shandris Feathermoon through the [[Drowned Market]].
* Speak with [[Shandris Feathermoon]]
* Escort Shandris Feathermoon

==Description==
Stay close, Champion. I have some [[magic]]al items that might help us defend briefly against magic attacks, but [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] was the greatest [[mage]] our kind has ever known.

I do not feel confident that these trinkets will hold back her power for long, or even be usable afterward.

Speak with me when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
The flood has stopped for now. That is good because I do not think I have enough charge left in these items to shield us from another wave like that.

==Notes==
:''Speak with Shandris:''
For ages, I wondered what would have happened to me had I chosen to flee to Zin-Azshari, or to Suramar, instead of with Tyrande.

Now I see I might have found my family, right before I would have lost them to Azshara's madness.

{{gossip|Ready when you are.}}

:''Shandris will make her way down a street to the east, against a stream of [[Fleeing Civilian|fleeing night elf spirits]]. You'll be stunned if one touches you.''
:''Periodically, a wave of water will rush toward you:''

:''Shandris will surround herself with a magical barrier; get inside it to avoid the wave.''
:''At the end of the street, the [[Image of Queen Azshara]] briefly reappears:''
{{text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|I can abide by the ignorance of [[adventurer|your companions]], but you should know better than to defy your rightful queen.}}
:''Continue east until Shandris stops and allows you to turn in the quest.''
