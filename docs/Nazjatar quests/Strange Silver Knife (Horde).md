==Objectives==
Ask the [[Unshackled]] about the knife.
* [[Silver Knife]]

==Description==
<This silver knife is small and lightly decorated, you found it inside of a [[chest]].

It was more likely used for eating or preparing [[food]] than combat. What would the [[naga]] need with such a thing?

One of the Unshackled may know more...>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Ay, what's that?

Ah yeah, lots of nice things to be found in those chests out there. Don't seem to be naga things, mind you, and that's kind of strange. Someone else left those here.

Happy to take that off of your hands, though.
