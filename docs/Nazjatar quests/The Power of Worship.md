==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Arcane Energy Transmuters.
* [[Arcane Energy Transmuter]] destroyed (3)

==Description==
I was once like them, stuck in a loop and waiting for [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] to come and save me. Our [[Ghost|spirits]] are locked to this place.

There are [[naga]] in the other parts of these ruins. They have these [[magic]]al orbs... I think they are using us to fuel their [[arcane]] experiments. They draw power from our spirits and our worship of Azshara. This keeps us weakened and unable to break free.

Destroy the orbs. Breaking the connection will allow us to gain strength and move on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
Have you found them all?

==Completion==
Without the draw of energy, I believe that the other spirits will eventually be able to break out of their loop. They will be able to move on.

==Progression==
{{Turning the Tide Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
