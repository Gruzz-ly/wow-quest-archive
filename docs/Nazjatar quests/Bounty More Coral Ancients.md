==Objectives==
Kill 7 [[coral ancient]]s.
* Coral Ancient slain (7)

==Description==
Coral ancients are beginning to awaken from their long slumber. I warn you, these are very dangerous creatures of immense size and power. If more of them begin to awaken, our forces will be in great danger.

Once you have defeated some of these ancients, report to the [[quartermaster]] to claim your reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
This will ease our efforts in [[Nazjatar]].
