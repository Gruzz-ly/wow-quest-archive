==Objectives==
Bring the Enchanting Crystal to [[Narv]] in [[Newhome]].
*[[Enchanting Crystal (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<This crystal shines with a mesmerizing light that you find difficult to avert your gaze from.

Perhaps the [[Unshackled]] would be able to tell you more about it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*850 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with the [[Unshackled]]
*[[Prismatic Crystal (item)]]

==Completion==
I've seen these crystals in a couple of places, often with a weird looking slime nearby. There has to be some sort of link but I've yet to discover it. 

At any rate the only use of these crystals I've found is to get tiny creatures to follow me around for a while.

Sorry, that doesn't help you much but you can have your crystal back. Let me know if you figure anything else out.
