==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Eye of the Corruptor.jpg|Eye of the Corruptor|This seems to be the source of the maddening whispers coming from Zin-Azshari.}}
Defeat 10 corrupted creatures and the source of the corruption.
* Corrupted creatures slain (10)
* [[Eye of the Corruptor]] slain
* Find the [[Communication Crystal|communication crystal]]

==Description==
[[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] knows we are here. Still, we must press on.

Be careful, though. There is a... wrongness coming from the water. It is unlike the [[magic]] of old, but more ancient and terrible.

Traverse the canals and find the source of corruption. If we are to search [[Zin-Azshari]], we cannot let any relics fall into the hands of even darker powers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
His influence is spreading...
