==Objectives==
Use collected venom to weaken and kill a [[Snapdragon Terrormaw]] for their fangs.
* [[Poison Globule]]
* [[Envenomed Fangs (quest item)]]

==Description==
There are many uses for the poison of the [[snapdragon]]s.

Immediate use would be to create antivenin for healing, or harvesting poison for attacking the [[naga]].

Let's get to the root of the issue, literally.

Use some collected venom against a Terrormaw to weaken it. Kill one and bring me their fangs.

I think we can come up with something handy from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
*2x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]
*100x [[Nazjatar Ally - Neri Sharpfin]]

==Progress==
Did you get the fangs?

==Completion==
Need to be careful not to scratch myself with these.

With a little learning, we should be able to create an antidote... and maybe a weapon of our own!

==Progression==
