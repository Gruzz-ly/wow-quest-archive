==Objectives==
Collect 8 Enchanted Pearls.
* [[Enchanted Pearl (quest item)]] (8)

==Description==
Thousands of years ago, when the [[Well of Eternity]] was destroyed and this land [[Great Sundering|plummeted]] to the depths of the [[Great Sea|ocean]], a great storm of [[magic]]al energy was unleashed.

Remnants of this magical energy still exist today.

Gather the pearls from the ancient [[mana]]-infused clams. These enchanted pearls may be powerful weapons in our fight against the [[naga]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
We must make use of every advantage in our fight against the naga.

==Completion==
You have done well. I can sense a powerful energy from emanating from within these pearls.
