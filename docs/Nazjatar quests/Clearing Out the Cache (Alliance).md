==Objectives==
Deal with Priscilla Ashvane and her minions.
* [[Priscilla Ashvane|Ashvane]]'s forces defeated

==Description==
<While inspecting the crate, a commotion can be heard within the cavern. A familiar voice, shouting orders.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* 600x [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
What have you discovered?

==Completion==
It seems Azshara's influence reaches even further than we thought.

Ashvane may have escaped, but at least we have secured the weapons.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|yell|Priscilla Ashvane|I must say, you naga excel at taking orders. These weapons are among the most powerful I have ever created.}}

You can loot an [[Azerite]] weapon ([[Azerite Spear]], [[Azerite Mace]], [[:Azerite Trident]], [[Azerite Sword]], or [[Azerite Staff]]) to gain the Azerite Weaponry buff. Kill [[Zanj'ir Weaponsmith]]s and [[Zanj'ir Forgetender]]s.

The unattackable Priscilla is accompanied by [[Shirakess Subjugator]]s, [[Shirakess Overseer]], and [[Azsh'ari Stormsurger]]. The Shirakess units jump to attack you.

:{{Text|yell|Priscilla Ashvane|This won't end well for you, I'm afraid.}}
:{{Text|yell|Priscilla Ashvane|You face far greater forces than you know.}}

The Azsh'ari unit jumps to attack you.

:{{Text|yell|Priscilla Ashvane|This is your last warning! I can still offer you mercy.}}
:{{Text|yell|Priscilla Ashvane|Leave now and I will call off the assault.}}

;Azsh'ari Stormsurger dies
:{{Text|yell|Priscilla Ashvane|Azshara!}}
:{{Text|yell|Priscilla Ashvane|AZSHARA!}}
:{{Text|yell|Priscilla Ashvane|You cannot leave me here to die! We had a deal!}}
:{{Text|say|Queen Azshara|Contain yourself, human. Show faith in your queen.}}
:{{Text|say|Queen Azshara|I would not let them take you. Not before you have fulfilled your destiny.}}
:''Priscilla is teleported.''
