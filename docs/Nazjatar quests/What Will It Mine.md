==Objectives==
Complete the [[Brinestone Cove]] event.
* Brinestone Shards collected (5)
* Brinestone Shards placed (5)
* [[Brinestone Core]]
*Take the Brinestone Core to an Ancient Relics vendor.
* [[Brinestone Pickaxe (starter)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Although worn from repeated use, the pickaxe still seems salvageable. Perhaps there's something nearby that can be mined?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you brought me?

==Completion==
Ah, what do we have here? A rare find, indeed! 

Brinestone is quite volatile and should only be mined with special equipment. 

Even then, its collection frequently disturbs the elements, so mine with caution.

==Notes==
Mine [[Brinestone Deposit]]s to obtain:
* [[Violet Brinestone Shard (quest item)]]
* [[Fiery Brinestone Shard (quest item)]]
* [[Jade Brinestone Shard (quest item)]]
* [[Azure Brinestone Shard (quest item)]]
* [[Amber Brinestone Shard (quest item)]]

Then place them on the same named objects to make the Brinestone Core appear.
