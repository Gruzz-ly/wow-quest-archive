==Objectives==
Search in [[Zin-Azshari]] for information about the strange [[Arcane Chest|arcane chests]].

==Description==
If you find anything else in those [[chest]]s that you don't need, you feel free to bring it on over my way.

Found a few of them myself. Don't look like they belong to the [[naga]], probably someone that lived in the city.

Some are locked tight by [[arcane]] [[magic]], seen the naga taking those back with them. Probably got the good stuff in there.

I don't know much more than that. If you want a history lesson, I'd snoop around the city ruins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
<A simple tome with a small series of [[rune]]s inscribed along the spine, it appears remarkably well-maintained amongst the ruins.

Upon further inspection, it appears to be a diary of one of the [[Commoner|citizens]] of the city. No doubt the magic that preserves it was intended to allot for the lengthy lifetimes of the [[Elf|elves]].>
