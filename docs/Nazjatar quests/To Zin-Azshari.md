==Objectives==
Meet [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]] in the ruins of [[Zin-Azshari]].

==Description==
We need something to deal with the guardian of the [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]], <name>.

Our new allies here say that there is a [[naga]] enclave located in the ruins of Zin-Azshari. If there is anything potent enough to counter [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s sorcery, it will be in the ruins of her capital city.

The First Arcanist will accompany you, champion. She will be best equipped to assist you in matters both historical and [[magic]]al while you search.

Good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Is that what I think it is?
