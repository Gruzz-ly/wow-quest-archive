==Objectives==
Show the Eel Jelly to [[Finder Palta]] in [[Newhome]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Eel Jelly (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<You examine the corpse of the abyssal [[eel]], only to find it bathed in a strange slime.

The slime coats your hands and arms, and seems quite difficult to remove.

One of your deep sea allies may know more about it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
You are really covered in slime, there. Mind if I take some?

Eel jelly is incredibly useful to us. Not a whole lot of things can be used to make things slippery underwater, you know. Eel jelly is just great at it.

Here, let me show you.

<Palta rubs some jelly on your arms and legs.>

Your skin is looking better already! Slimier. Much better.
