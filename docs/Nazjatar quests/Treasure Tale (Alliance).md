==Objectives==
Return to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Nazjatar]].

==Description==
<You discovered the history of [[Mad Mardivas|Mardivas]], a [[sorcerer]] that once lived in the [[Zin-Azshari|city]] and the crafter of the [[Arcane Chest|arcane chests]] scattered around Nazjatar.

From the sounds of it, he was not well-liked, which worked out for him, as he did not much like others.

You also found and unlocked one of his "unsolvable" [[arcane]] locks. This knowledge may prove useful on your journey.

Artisan Itanu will surely enjoy hearing the end of this tale.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Curios of Nazjatar]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Ah, how nice to see a proper end to the tale, thank you.

I had always wondered why one would lock up one's dinnerware. If one does not much like or trust others, it becomes more obvious.

Despite all of his efforts, they will end up in your hands, in the end. How droll.
