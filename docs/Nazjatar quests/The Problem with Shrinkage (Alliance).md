==Objectives==
Ask [[Instructor Ulooaka]] about the shriveled leather hide.
* [[Shriveled Leather Hide]] (provided)

==Description==
<Having skinned countless creatures, you can't help but notice how much usable leather is lost when the skin is dried and tanned. The [[Ankoan]] seem to have mastered using the material, perhaps Instructor Ulooaka could share some of his insights.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Skinning Technique: Dredged Leather (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
Apologies. We are so used to working with these materials, I forgot to explain how to prevent that. These [[beast]]s are usually underwater all the time, and the air dries them unevenly. When you skin the beast, roll the skin as you harvest it. This will rehydrate it enough to prevent waste.
