==Objectives==
Free 6 [[Makrura]] [[Slave]]s.
* [[Makrura Slave|Makrura slaves]] freed (6)

==Description==
The [[naga]] have enslaved a [[tribe]] of makrura and sent them to labor as mindless thralls.

The naga forces may be more in number, but the makrura have an innate advantage in both size and strength.

If we break the makrura from their chains, they will surely overwhelm their naga overseers and put a dent in [[Queen Azshara]]'s plans.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*2x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]
*100x [[Nazjatar Ally - Hunter Akana]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
The naga will be no match for the makrura [[prisoner]]s that we have freed.

==Notes==
*Free the slaves with [[Nazjatar Shackle Key]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
