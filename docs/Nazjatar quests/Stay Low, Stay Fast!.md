==Objectives==
Follow Neri Sharpfin.
* Move ahead with [[Neri Sharpfin|Neri]]
* Go to [[Newhome]]

==Description==
It's a straight shot home. We just need to be careful.

Neri's rule of survival number six: always be prepared!

Let's go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +225 [[reputation]] with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Finally, some small relief. But we must not rest easy; [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] surely has more in store for us than she lets on.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We are strangers here. Why did you help us?}}
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|We've had our eye on you since this chaos started. Walls of water rising, ships crashing everywhere... then the [[naga]] swarmed all over you!}}
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Any enemy of the queen is a friend of ours. We know the bad guys pretty well, and you're not one of them.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|There are some who would beg to differ.}}

;First objective
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Tell me, what "queen" do you speak of?}}
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|What queen?! Are you telling me you don't know where you are?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Of course! By the stars, I should have realized! Lor'themar, this place is--}}
:''A cutscene plays here. A projection of Queen Azshara appears.''
:{{Text|say|Queen Azshara|Ah, good. Our guests have arrived.}}
:{{Text|say|Queen Azshara|I must say, that was a delightfully dramatic entrance.}}
:{{Text|say|Queen Azshara|Behold the wonders of [[Nazjatar]].}}
:{{Text|say|Queen Azshara|The finest sight your eyes will ever behold... and the last.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Can you get us to safety?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|She is... preventing [[teleportation]]...}}
:{{Text|say|Queen Azshara|Please, do stay. Explore all the comforts [[Nazjatar Empire|my kingdom]] has to offer.}}
:{{Text|say|Queen Azshara|I will hold the waters at bay... so long as I remain entertained.}}

Cutscene ends.

:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Phew! I knew Azshara didn't like us, but she reaaaaaally hates you. That got personal!}}
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Let's go... before something else comes along to spoil the fun.}}
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Never forget Neri's survival rule number one: Don't get killed!}}

;Arriving at Newhome
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Okay, folks. Here we are! It's not much, but it's home.}}
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Tell your troops to make themselves comfortable. I have a few things to discuss with my people.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We are in your debt, Neri.}}
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Don't sweat it. If you wanna show your appreciation, you can lend a helping hand.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|We must remain alert, <name>. I doubt that Azshara set this trap merely to toy with us.}}
