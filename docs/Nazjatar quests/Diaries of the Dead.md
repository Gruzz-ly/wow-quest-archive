==Objectives==
Search [[Zin-Azshari]] in [[Nazjatar]] for additional diaries.
* Find [[Preserved Journal|another journal]] in the city ruins.
* Continue searching the city ruins.

==Description==
<The enchantments preserving this journal are intact, but fading. It appears to be the diary of a [[Commoner|citizen]] of the city. You turn to a random page...>

Of course, he was bitten on the leg by a lesser summon, and...

<It continues -- not useful, but you surmise there may be more such tomes.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with {{Alliance}} [[Waveblade Ankoan]] / {{Horde}} [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
<A preserved tome.>

==Completion==
<You see a glowing lock, and Mardivas' journal is next to it. You glance at the final pages.>

The rune locks have been stabilized, and organized in such a way that only one with my level of logical acumen would be able to decipher.

Oh, to see the faces of the would-be [[Thief|thieves]], thwarted! 

Yes, yes, yes that is it! I shall work on a ward that allows me to view the thieves in the act! Genius, genius, I am.

I simply need a bit more time...
