==Objectives==
Accept a gift from your companion.

==Description==
Hi, friend. I just wanted you to know that traveling with you has been the best ever!

I never thought I could learn so much about fighting, but now I feel like I can actually hold my own.

I will protect all of the wee ones that can't protect themselves!

<Poen produces a [[crab]] from somewhere, it has a bright shell.>

Like this little one. I found him a while back, while we were out. He looked so scared.

Hey, why don't you take him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Lustrous Glimmershell
}}

==Completion==
I've never seen one with a shell this brightly-colored, must make him a target.

Without you, we could have both been doomed.

Here, take him, it's because of you that we're all a lot safer now.

I have more friends to protect!
