Outside is dangerous.

It is safe in the [[Kelfin Pocket]]. 

We find the lost [[crab]]s, and [[Sea slug|slugs]], and other friends.

Here they get a new name and a new home.

Find friends like these, and bring them home.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Did you bring us friends?

They are already my friends. Now they are safe.

Thank you, <name>.
