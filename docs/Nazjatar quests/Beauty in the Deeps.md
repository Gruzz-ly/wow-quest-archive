==Objectives==
Accept a gift from your companion.

==Description==
We have slain many enemies, spilled much blood on the sand. My skills have improved tenfold fighting at your side. Yet let us not forget that once, this was a place of peace. Once, my people walked amongst the caverns and reefs undisturbed. There is beauty, here, in the depths, all around us. Take a moment, sit, and enjoy your serene surroundings. Look here, a crab with a shell of brilliant colors. You see? There is beauty here, even now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Brilliant Glimmershell

==Completion==
Take this crab, may it be a symbol of the beauty that once reigned in this place.

With your help, it will again.
