==Objectives==
Collect 15 Fresh Unagi.
* [[Fresh Unagi]] (15)

==Description==
[[Poen Gillbrack|Poen]] is always helping us take care of every rescue we find.

Can you collect some [[meat]] from the [[eel]]s south of here?

I like to make his favorite dish every now and then, to repay him.

It also has a great effect on the ones recovering.

The power of deliciousness, I tell you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Did you get enough meat?

==Completion==
This really is a special treat for all of us.

Thank you!
