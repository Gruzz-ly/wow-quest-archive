==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Ghost|spirits]] who wander around the [[Highborne Estates]].
* [[Highborne Echo]] released (3)

==Description==
These spirits... they are the [[Highborne]]. They were those [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] held close. Azshara often played favorites, but these people... they were her favorites.

I do not know why their spirits are here. We should investigate further. See if you can communicate with them and find out why their spirits cling to these ruins.

How could she abandon them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
What have you discovered, <name>?

==Completion==
I feel such sadness for these spirits. Eternally locked to this place, reliving the worst day of their lives.

==Progression==
{{Turning the Tide Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
