==Objectives==
Show the Crackling Mandible to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Mezzamere]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Crackling Mandible (item)]]

==Description==
<The mandible of a [[tidal guardian]], still crackling with electricity.

One of your new allies might have a use for this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Oh, let me handle that with care, I do not want another shock.

You have met the tidal guardians, then? They have lived in the [[naga]] caves for as long as I can recall, serving their masters faithfully. I have not seen one while hunting in the wild in my lifetime.

We can make many things with their mandibles, from spearheads to electrified traps. I will put this to good use.
