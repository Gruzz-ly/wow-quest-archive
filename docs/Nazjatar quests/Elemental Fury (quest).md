==Objectives==
Pacify 8 Tide Surgers.
* [[Tide Surger]]s pacified (8)
* [[Stone of Elements]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[naga]] have angered the [[Elemental|elements]] and disrupted the natural order. We must restore the balance before it is too late.

A [[Farseer]] maintains a deep connection with the elements. When the naga forces imprisoned my master, the natural balance was disturbed.

Take the Stone of Elements and use it to pacify the enraged [[water elemental]]s throughout [[Dragon's Teeth Basin]].

Ultimately, our only solution is to rescue [[Farseer Ori]] and bring him back alive, but the Tidestone could buy us precious time...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
We must restore the balance before it is too late!

==Completion==
You have done well. I can sense that the elemental balance is close to being restored to its natural state.

==Progression==
{{Secrets in the Sea Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
