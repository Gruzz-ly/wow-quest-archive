==Objectives==
Accept a gift from your companion.

==Description==
We've been fighting side by side for a while now. I didn't think an old salt like me could get any better at killing [[naga]], but here we are.

I have something to show you...

<Vim produces a book from his pack.>

Worst thing we can do is forget.

So many names I've written in this book, each and every one of them an [[Unshackled]]. All of them gone, now.

I will never forget their names.

I want you to have it. Tell people. Tell them who they were, and what we have done here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Book of the Unshackled
}}

==Completion==
This book contains the names of brave creatures of all kinds that helped us, fought for us, and died for us.

Help me remember them.

==Progression==
