==Objectives==
Aid [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]].
* [[Abyssal Commander Sivara]] confronted

==Description==
It wasn't enough for [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] to break the [[Azeroth|world]]. She had to doom the rest of [[Night elf|our people]] here as well!

Those who didn't choose to become [[naga]] were stuck in this horrifying half death, left to haunt these drowned ruins.

I am almost afraid to find Sivara.

Wait, did you hear something?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
Thrice damned Azshara. Her evil knows no bounds.

==Completion==
Sivara could have defeated us at any time. Why are they toying with us?

At any rate, champion, again I find myself in your debt. Thank you for helping me, even if the answers we found were more horrifying than I could have anticipated.
