Upgrade a piece of Benthic armor through [[Voidbinder Zorlan]].
*Identify a piece of Benthic Armor (Optional)
* Upgrade a piece of Benthic Armor

==Description==
For something that has been sitting on the ocean floor, there is still power to be found in this item.

Take your piece of Benthic armor to Voidbinder Zorlan. He has been eyeing it with great curiosity.

Go ahead and humor the [[ethereal]] and let him have a look.

Maybe he has something to offer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
Everything taken care of?

==Completion==
Ancient elven magic and the ocean infusing things with her own power...

I would like to say I'm surprised, but I'm really not.

It's a good thing you brought those shiny fellows to help sort it all out.
