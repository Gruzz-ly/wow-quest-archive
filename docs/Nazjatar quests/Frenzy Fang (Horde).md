==Objectives==
Show the Frenzy Fang to [[Finder Palta]] in [[Newhome]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Frenzy Fang (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<You remove a fully-grown fang from the fallen [[frenzy]].

You have heard of some seafaring groups that made weapons or decorations out of fangs found in the deeps, perhaps your new allies could find a use for this?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
<Palta pokes the tip of the fang.>

Frenzy fang, huh? Those things... we don't joke about them.

<Palta looks up at the open air.>

You're lucky, they can't come here anymore.

I remember, one time, we had gone out looking for supplies. I was the only one to make it back. I can still hear the screams of the devoured. They came out of nowhere, by the hundreds. It was all clouds of red.

The deep places of the [[Azeroth|world]] are dangerous, friend. Avoid them if you can.
