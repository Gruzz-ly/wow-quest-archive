==Objectives==
Collect 8 Bioluminescent Ooze from [[Luminescent Slug|Luminescent Sea Slug]]s within [[Bloodfin Village]].
* [[Bioluminescent Ooze]] (8)

==Description==
My brief studies have shown that the refinement process creates a byproduct that is invisible to the naked eye, but is easily seen with refracted bioluminescent light.

The sea floor is littered with creatures that produce just what we need to track down this weapons cache.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
Do you have the ooze?

==Completion==
The substance is stickier than expected, but should still work.

==Progression==
{{Secrets in the Sea Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
