* [[Strange Organ (quest item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<You find a strange organ in the corpse of the mindbender. Upon picking it up, your head begins to throb.

The [[octopus]]-like [[Merciless one|creatures]] have long been one of [[Azeroth]]'s mysteries, this organ may shed some light on them.

Someone in Newhome may know more.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Mindbender brain-organ? Great, thanks, I have a use for this.

They use this organ to attack our thoughts. Or, at least, it's a part of the process.

Here, watch.

<Palta points the organ at you and pokes it. You hear a deafening psychic scream in your mind.>

It's like they were made just to service the [[Old God]]s and drive people insane.

Anyway, thanks. I'm going to save this for when my friend comes over to talk about her gardening.
