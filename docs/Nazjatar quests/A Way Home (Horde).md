==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|Oculeth, I am relieved you made it here. [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] is blocking my [[teleportation]] spells. We need to find a crack in her defenses.}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|I know just the thing, Thalyssra. Come along, <name>. You will serve as my assistant!}}
:''Oculeth walks towards the future place of the portal.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|If we combine our powers, we should be able to open a gateway to Zuldazar without Azshara noticing.}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Here we are. With the merest touch of the Heart of Azeroth, the pathway will be stabilized.}}

Use the Heart of Azeroth extra button.

:''[[Magni Bronzebeard]] suddenly teleports in.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Elementary! Well, [[arcane]], if one is to be technical about it. I must beg your pardon. We are all a bit out of our depth right now.}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|At any rate, I suppose you have work to do. Good luck!}}
