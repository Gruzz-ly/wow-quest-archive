==Objectives==
Move deeper into [[Nazjatar]] with Jaina and Genn.

*Inspect the [[Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides (Nazjatar)|scepter]]

==Description==
We must move quickly if we are to find safety for our people.

This cave is barely defensible, and much of our army is in an even more precarious position.

Let's search deeper.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Money]]
* [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
We have been watching you. Your people seem quite capable.

==Notes==
;Heading deeper into the region
:''A loud and deep blaring horn, like a whale call, is heard.''
:{{Text|Say|Genn Greymane|Do you hear that?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Stay on your guard. We don't know how many more naga are out there.}}

;After the first objective
:''A scene plays out, showind a naga army and [[Priscilla Ashvane]].''
:{{Text|Say|Priscilla Ashvane|What are you waiting for? We have the enemy in our sights!}}
:{{Text|Say|Priscilla Ashvane|Fire!}}
: ''Various catapults are fired at the heroes location.''
:{{Text|Say|Genn Greymane|They've spotted us! We need to go!}}

;Moving deeper still
:''A [[Crashing Waveguard]] and a [[Wave Surger]] attack.''

;Moving on
:''[[Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides (Nazjatar)|Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides]] is seen in a ruin.''
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|There is a source of great power up ahead.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Be wary. Things are not as they seem.}}

;Interacting with the Scepter
:{{Text|Say|Genn Greymane|Another naga ambush!}}
:''A [[Voltscale Guardian]] bursts forth from the ground, only to be struck down an instant later by [[Blademaster Okani]].''
:{{Text|Say|Blademaster Okani|No. I am Okani, leader of the [[Waveblade clan]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Blademaster Okani|We share a common foe. Come, we will lead you to safety.}}
:{{Text|Say|Genn Greymane|And why would we trust you?}}
:{{Text|Say|Blademaster Okani|We are departing for our shelter in the reef. Come, or do not. But decide quickly.}}
:{{Text|Say|Genn Greymane|It could be a trap. What say you, Jaina?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They seem to be our best chance. My instincts tell me to trust them--at least for now.}}
:{{Text|Say|Genn Greymane|Very well. Okani, we will come with you.}}
