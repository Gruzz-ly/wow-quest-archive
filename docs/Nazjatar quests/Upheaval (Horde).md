==Objectives==
Speak with [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] at the top of the waterfall.

==Description==
We're surrounded by the dead, dying, and other detritus.

Feels like war, does it not?

Oculeth and others have gone ahead to see to the soldiers.

Perhaps you ought to see to them as well?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Not to worry, <name>. It's not as if I'd magic you into the middle of the ocean without notice! Well, I suppose that is where we are, is it not?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Nathanos Blightcaller|I suppose you will want to find safe haven for our wounded. Oculeth will assist you. I have a mission to complete.}}

;Sliding to the telemancer
:''Chief Telemancer Oculeth places you in a Telemancer Trap, a protective bubble.''
:{{Text|Say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Not so fast!}}
