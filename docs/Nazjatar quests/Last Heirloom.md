==Objectives==
Accept a gift from your companion.

==Description==
We have encountered many foes together, and emerged victorious every time. I have you to thank for our safety this day, and my prowess in combat.

I will be honest with you, friend. I did not think I would live this long.

My people had families, once. Traditions. We would carve symbols into our talismans and pass them down from generation to generation of deep sea hunters. Charms for luck, or prowess, each family had their own.

This is mine. I have none to pass it on to. I would like you to have it{{sic}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Carved Ankoan Charm
}}

==Completion==
This charm is one of luck, it was passed down through many years of my people.

It has brought me little luck, until now, until it brought you to me.

It is only fitting that you take it from here.
