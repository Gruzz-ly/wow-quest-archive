==Description==
You there, I require some help.

Everyone where I once called home lost their lives to the flood. I still don't know what became of my father, Corin.

It pains me to return to the estates, and there are vengeful spirits who haunt the once pristine grounds. Will you help me find out what happened to my father?

* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
<name>, Corin is being tormented by that [[naga]] [[shadowcaster]]. 

We have to do something!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|The denizens of the estates are cursed... forced to live in a state of purgatory for [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s own glory.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|I hope my father does not suffer the same fate.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|Let's check the bakery. Corin always loved their cakes...}}

;Near the [[Ruined Mixing Stand]]
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|I remember this place! The scent of fresh baked bread and sweets fills my mind.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|But that was then. Now there is just rubble...}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|Look! The old mixing stand is still there.}}

After interacting with the stand, [[Varel Pansong]] appears
:{{Text|say|Varel Pansong|I need that to prepare cakes for the Queen's arrival! Pay with your life!}}
:{{Text|say|Varel Pansong|Azshara... will come.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|It's worse than I thought. They are blinded by Azshara's will. The curse has driven them mad...}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|No sign of Corin. Let's go to the old inn. He used to hang around there chatting up the locals for hours.}}

;At the inn
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|Ah.. the inn. This place used to be full of life.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|Corin loved it here. Look, there's his old stein!}}

;[[Corin's Mug]]
:{{Text|say|[[Eranor Birtris]]|Outsider! We only accommodate those who serve the Queen!}}
:{{Text|say|Eranor Birtris|Azshara... forgive me.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|Eranor?! You deserved a better fate than this. Rest easy, friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|Still no Corin. My last hope is the gardens by our former home. Please be there...}}

;At the gardens
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|He's not here. Wait... do you feel that?}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|Down here.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelya Moonfall|Father! <name>, we must do something!}}
