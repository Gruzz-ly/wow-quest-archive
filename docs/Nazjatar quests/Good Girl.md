'''Good Girl''' becomes available after leveling [[Neri Sharpfin]] to Rank 20.

==Objectives==
Accept a gift from your companion.

==Description==
I have learned so much by your side, I can't believe how many [[naga]] we've taken down!

When you first arrived, I was skeptical that you'd make a difference. We've been down here, fighting, for so long. I had almost lost hope.

But now, we see a way out of the darkness of the depths, finally!

I took in a [[snapdragon]] pup when we formed [[Newhome]], been training her ever since. I think... I think I'd like you to have her.

She'll make a great mount... and loyal friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Snapdragon Kelpstalker]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Take good care of her, ok? She means a lot to me.

She likes [[fathom ray]] eggs best, so remember that.

Goodbye, little one! Neri loves you!
