==Objectives==
Commune with the [[Memory of the Pact]].
* Vision witnessed

==Description==
We are standing in the center of some very powerful [[magic]]s. An echo of something [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] did long ago.

If you are feeling brave enough to commune with this echo, I will stand guard as you do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
Be ready for anything.

==Completion==
We long suspected Azshara's choice. The question becomes, why is she showing us this? What game is she playing this time?

==Notes==
Upon interacting with the memory, [[Warbringers|Azshara's Warbringer cinematic]] plays out.
