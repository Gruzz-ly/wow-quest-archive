==Objectives==
Collect 10 Snapdragon Claws.
* [[Snapdragon Claw]] (10)

==Description==
[[Snapdragon]]s are savage creatures that hunt in packs. Their presence in [[Nazjatar]] requires us to stay vigilant at all times.

They are crafty [[beast]]s, preferring to ambush their prey when it is weak or wounded. We will need to reduce the number of snapdragons in the area.

The last thing we need after a battle with the [[naga]] is to be finished off by a pack of blood-thirsty snapdragons!

Hunt down any nearby snapdragons and bring me a claw from each kill so that I may keep track of their numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
The snapdragon threat cannot be underestimated.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. The fewer snapdragons in Nazjatar, the better.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
