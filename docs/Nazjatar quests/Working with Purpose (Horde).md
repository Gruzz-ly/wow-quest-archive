==Objectives==
Collect 6 Iridescent Pearls from [[Chittershell Clam]]s.
* [[Iridescent Pearl (quest item)]] (6)

==Description==
It seems the [[Shirakess]] are never satisfied with the number of [[pearl]]s we source for them. They're always demanding more.

Before you came along, it was my job to crawl around the cavern, cracking open clams.

So you see, you have some purpose, other than being a mindless sack of flesh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
Do you have them all?

==Completion==
Eager to please, aren't you?

==Progression==
{{Secrets in the Sea Horde}}

==Patch changes==
