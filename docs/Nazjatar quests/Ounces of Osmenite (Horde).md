==Objectives==
Ask [[Rolm]] about the Osmenite Shards.
* [[Osmenite Shards#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
<Picking away at the ore, you pick up some shards that have fallen to the ground. There ought to be a way to mine these deposits without wasting any of it. Perhaps Rolm knows of still a better way to mine this ore.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining Technique: Osmenite Deposit (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
Ah yes, that's due to the fragile nature of the ore. You need to adjust your style a bit.

Instead of heavy, powerful swings, try picking away at the edge of where the ore meets the rock.

Like peeling the skin off a fruit. Here, let me show you what I mean...
