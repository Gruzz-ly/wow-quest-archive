==Objectives==
Move deeper into Nazjatar with [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]] and [[First Arcanist Thalyssra|Thalyssra]].
*Investigate the noise
*Move ahead with Thalyssra and Lor'themar
*Inspect the [[Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides (Nazjatar)|scepter]]

==Description==
I don't like the sound of that... It sounds like an army!

We need to investigate.

Try not to draw too much attention as we take a look. If there's an army down there, we'll need to move quickly to find refuge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These [[naga]] move with a single purpose!

==Completion==
These naga wear out their welcome quickly.

==Notes==
;After the first objective
:''A scene plays out, showing a naga army and [[Priscilla Ashvane]].''
:{{Text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|What are you waiting for? We have the enemy in our sights!}}
:{{Text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Fire!}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I knew Ashvane could not be trusted. Damn her treachery!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|This makes no sense. Why would the naga accept a [[human]] as an ally?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Questions will have to wait. We must find shelter for our people.}}

;After the second objective
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Once we find refuge, will you be able to send word to [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Oculeth]]?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Yes, assuming there is any safe ground to find. This place is unsettling, yet... familiar.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|The [[Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides|Scepter of Tides]]... here?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|An illusion!}}

;After the third objective
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Careful. Something stirs beyond this wall of water.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Look out!}}
:''The [[Blackwater Behemoth]] appears and stuns the heroes with Bioelectrify. [[Neri Sharpfin]] and [[Kelfin Scout]]s ride in and force the creature out.''
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Chew on this, monster! [[Atolia Seapearl|Atolia]], free them from the beast's grip!}}
:{{Text|say|Neri Sharpfin|Okay, everyone. Let's get moving before the creature regains its wits! We have a safe place where you can regroup.}}
:''The gilgoblins ride away.''
