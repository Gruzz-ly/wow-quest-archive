==Objectives==
Collect a Deepsea Crystal from [[Hoarder Moarrgl]].
* [[Deepsea Crystal]]

==Description==
Locating the weapons cache shouldn't be a problem once we have the proper tools. A little light and a lot of bioluminescent fluid is all we need!

It all seems rather simple, doesn't it? But the key is in the Deepsea Crystal used to refract the light.

I am told that the [[Bloodfin tribe]] covets these crystals, so it shouldn't be too much trouble to get your hands on one.

(Hoarder Moarrgl: Known collector of Deepsea Crystals.)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
*5x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]

==Progress==
Have you found the crystal?

==Completion==
The clarity on this gem is rather remarkable, wouldn't you say? I think it'll do nicely.

==Notes==
*Hoarder Moarrgl is in a small cave.

==Progression==
{{Secrets in the Sea Horde}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
