==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{Text|say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|The [[Horde]]'s [[Adventurer|champions]] will drive every last [[naga]] from the palace. Azshara will pay for what she's done.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]|Alliance heroes will dethrone the would-be queen. We won't seek a fight with you, Lor'themar, but we will not abide interference.}}
:''The [[Image of Queen Azshara]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|What have we here? Bitter rivals standing united around my [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]]. I really do possess a gift for bringing my subjects together.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You can't stop us, Azshara. We are coming to end your reign.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|Stop you? My dear child, why would I want to stop you?}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|Consider this a formal invitation. My palace has been made ready. Your presence is eagerly anticipated.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|So many wonders lie in store. Such... magnificence.}}
:''The image disappears.''

;Quest completion
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Our victory rings hollow. Azshara's master will rise. Nothing can stop that now.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|For all her lies, [[Priscilla Ashvane]] spoke one truth. The war between the Alliance and Horde has kept us distracted. Divided, we have no hope against [[N'Zoth]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|We may have found common cause here in [[Nazjatar]], but the battle still rages beyond these waters. So long as [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] holds [[Orgrimmar]], there can be no lasting peace.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|[[Fourth War|The war]] needs to end, Lor'themar. You know this to be true.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I had hoped that reason would prevail. But the time has come to finish this.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I will tell my people what transpired here. Of how Azshara fell because we stood together. Of the threat rising from the depths, and all that is at stake if we should fail.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Then I will take my place beside Saurfang and Thrall, and pray that the [[sin'dorei]] stand with me.}}
