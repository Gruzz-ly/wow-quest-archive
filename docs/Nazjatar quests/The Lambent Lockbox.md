Loot the Lambent Lockbox.
* [[Lambent Lockbox]] looted

==Description==
There are many treasures to find throughout these ancient ruins.

Sometime ago, I noticed a strange looking [[chest]] in a cave not far from here.

There may be valuable items inside that can help us in our fight against [[Queen Azshara]].

We should go back and investigate the chest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
