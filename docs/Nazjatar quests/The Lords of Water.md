;Hydraxis
Greetings mortal. The naga have committed a grand crime against the power of my master, Neptulon.

The [[magic]] of the [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]] is the magic of [[titan]]s. Even now, that ancient power holds him at bay just as it holds back the sea. However, it cannot hold back his justice.

Will you join me in quelling these naga for their defiance of the great Neptulon?

{{Gossip|I am ready.}}

#{{Abilities|Gift of the Tides|id=302642|Heals the caster for 15% of maximum health every 1 for 5 sec.|icon=spell_nature_giftofthewaterspirit}}

;Aquaclease
Mortal! I have been sent by the great Neptulon to bring ruin and judgment upon these current befouling fools that would destroy [[Azeroth|our world]].

The power of the Tidestone holds the great Neptulon back, but together, you with your [[Heart of Azeroth|Heart of Azerite]], and I with the full might of the undercurrent, can join forces and deliver justice upon these villains.

Join me in battle, and together we shall crush them beneath the very water they breath.

{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
