==Objectives==
Kill the [[Handmaiden]] of [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]].
* [[Lady Silazsi]] slain
* [[Javelin of Suramar]]

==Description==
These [[Ghost|spirits]] keep speaking of the [[Javelins of Azshara]]. At first, I believed it to be referring to the handmaidens, who are currently holed up in [[Elun'alor Temple|Elun'alor]].

But -- now I think they are referring to the [[Javelins of Suramar]]. They were powerful weapons -- long thought lost. Azshara does like to claim things as her own.

We need to defeat her handmaiden in Elun'alor regardless. Seizing the Javelins would be an amazing stroke of fortune.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Killing her handmaidens will drive the naga back and out of [[Zin-Azshari]].

==Completion==
Killing a handmaiden alone would have been an amazing victory. Retrieving the Javelins of Suramar as well? Today is the turning point. Today, we have created the path to victory.

==Progression==
{{Turning the Tide Alliance}}
