==Objectives==
Speak to [[Neri Sharpfin|Neri]] to learn more about the [[naga]] within [[Nazjatar]].

==Description==
There's no telling what awaits us within this land. We cannot press forward without first knowing exactly what we're up against.

Although our [[Unshackled|new allies]] have suffered greatly at the hands of the naga, their hardships will not be in vain.

The [[Gilgoblin|kelfin]] should have invaluable knowledge of [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s forces.

With their help, we might be able to learn more about how our enemies operate.

Speak with Neri and see what insight she can provide.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
You want some insight into the naga?

I can tell you what I know, but the kelfin who are still being held captive can give you a firsthand account.
