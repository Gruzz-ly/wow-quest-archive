==Objectives==
Confront the spirits about [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]].
* [[Ghost]]s of [[Elun'alor Temple|Elun'alor]] confronted

==Description==
The information you have gleaned concerns me, <name>. These spirits cling to this place because they still, even now, believe in Azshara and her reign. She sold their lives to the [[void]] and they still believe in her.

I know we have concerns that outweigh this, but I cannot leave them here like this.

Show them. Confront them and tell them of Azshara's betrayal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
Have the spirits been put to rest?

==Completion==
Many of the spirits who haunt [[Zin-Azshari]] do not know they are dead. They will not admit it to themselves.

We might be able to help them. If you are willing to help me.

==Notes==
;In the cave, find a [[Highborne Arcanist]] and speak with him.

Our Queen will save us! Do not lose faith!

{{Gossip|Queen Azshara will not come for you.}}
:No! You are mistaken. Our Queen will save us.

:{{Gossip|She has already abandoned you and the city.}}
:Queen Azshara will do what she must to save her people. She must have her reasons.

:{{Gossip|You died in the Sundering. You are all spirits.}}
:It cannot be.

{{Gossip|She has already abandoned you and the city.}}
:You lie!

:{{Gossip|You died in the Sundering. You are all spirits.}}
:It cannot be.

:{{Gossip|Queen Azshara serves only herself and her old god master.}}
:Queen Azshara will do what she must to save her people. She must have her reasons.

;Ghosts of Elun'alor confronted
:{{text|say|[[Riathia Silverstar]]|They won't listen. I know you mean well <class>. But like many of the spirits here, they refuse to admit the truth.}}
:{{text|say|Riathia Silverstar|Admitting that Azshara's pride and vanity destroyed them, when they worshipped her... They would lose everything, if they admitted she allowed them to die.}}
:{{text|say|Riathia Silverstar|I might know a way to free them, if you would be willing to help me.}}
