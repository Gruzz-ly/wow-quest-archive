'''A Way Home''' is the final quest in the [[Nazjatar]] intro questline. This quest is a prerequisite for unlocking the [[Heart Forge]].

==Objectives==
Help Jaina open a portal to [[Boralus]].
* Assist [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]]

==Description==
We are only alive thanks to the [[ankoan]] and [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s desire to toy with us.

We will learn more of [[Blademaster Okani|Okani]]'s people in the times ahead, I am sure.

For now, we must establish a portal home. While Azshara is blocking our traditional methods of [[magic]]al travel, I can sense a powerful convergence of energies nearby.

I believe we can use it to open a way home.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

{{Stub-section|Mail pieces.}}
You will be able to choose from:
*[[7th Legionnaire's Robes]]
*[[7th Legionnaire's Hood]]
*[[7th Legionnaire's Amice]]
*[[7th Legionnaire's Vest]]
*[[7th Legionnaire's Visage]]
*[[7th Legionnaire's Leather Mantle]]
*[[7th Legionnaire's Chestguard]]
*[[7th Legionnaire's Headpiece]]
*[[7th Legionnaire's Shoulderplates]]

==Progress==
I fear it will be quite some time before we can let down our guard.

==Completion==
We are exceptionally lucky to have met the ankoan. Perhaps things are not as dire as they seem.

:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This land was once the heart of the night elves' empire. I can sense ley lines of magical energy converging below ground.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We can tap into this latent power to forge a connection to [[Boralus]]. So long as we're careful, we can keep Azshara from noticing it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The [[:Heart of Azeroth]] holds potent magic, <name>. If you use it to help me focus the ley lines, we can open the way together.}}
: ''She runs over to a teleportation pad, like the ones used by [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] in [[Suramar]], and starts casting.''

;After using the Heart of Azeroth
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Perfect. The Heart will allow you to use the portal safely.}}
: ''She runs back to the building.''
