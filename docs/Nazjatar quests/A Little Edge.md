==Objectives==
Collect 12 Chitterspine Spines.
* [[Chitterspine Spine]] (12)

==Description==
In the darkest cavern. Below the [[naga]] [[city]]. You will find them.

Creepy little [[crab]]s with sharp and pointy spines.

I think we can find a way to use them. Projectiles didn't work so well in water, but now...

Harvest some for us!

Be careful, some of them are much sneakier than they have any right to be.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Did you gather the spines?

==Completion==
Ouch! These might just do the trick!

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
