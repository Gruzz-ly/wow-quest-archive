==Objectives==
Speak with Lady [[Jaina Proudmoore]] above the waterfall.

==Description==
So many lives lost... And the attacks from the [[naga]] are relentless!

I apologize, <name>. This attitude is unbecoming of a king.

We have no time to lose musing of our own plight.

Let us meet with Jaina and descend from this perilous place into the unknown.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
Finally, some good news. Our champion awakens from the chaos.
