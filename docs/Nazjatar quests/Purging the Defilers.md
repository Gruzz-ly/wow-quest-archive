==Objectives==
Purge the [[naga]] from [[Elun'alor Temple|Elun'alor]].
*Purge the Defilement of Elun'alor

==Description==
[[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] always did need everything to be about her. Everything had to have her name on it. Everything was for her glory. She forgot our people's connection to [[Elune]]. Or perhaps she believed it did not matter?

Azshara and her minions have too long defiled this place with their [[Heretic|heresy]].

Let us show them Elune's vengeance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
Zin-Azshari is proof of Azshara's iniquity.

==Completion==
Elune's vengeance is swift and fierce. Well done, <name>.

==Notes==
*To fill up the bar, destroy [[Icon of Azshara|Icons of Azshara]] and kill [[Azsh'ari Oracle]]s, [[Azsh'ari Invoker]]s, and [[Azsh'ari Elementalist]]s.

==Progression==
{{Turning the Tide Alliance}}
