==Objectives==
Support your [[Combat allies|allies]] in [[Nazjatar]] by getting one to rank 3.

==Description==
We have much to do <name>. However our troops are weary and need rest. Decisions made when tired are often the wrong ones.

These "[[Unshackled]]" have offered to aid us with what forces they have. If we hope to survive down here against [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s forces, we will need to support our new allies.

Join one of their [[hunter]]s and aid them in their tasks, we will remain here and discuss our next move.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
*[[Pearl of Lucid Dreams]]

==Progress==
We have much to consider.

==Completion==
Excellent work. Your efforts have helped us rebuild our supplies and gained our friends some much-needed combat experience.

They have entrusted us with this item, which appears to be quite [[magic]]al. I cannot harness the power, but perhaps your [[:Heart of Azeroth]] can. Take it, may it do us some good in this strange place.

==Progression==
{{Secrets in the Sea Horde}}
