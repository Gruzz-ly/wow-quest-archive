==Objectives==
Loot the Mysterious Cache.
* [[Mysterious Cache]] looted

==Description==
We have located many treasure hoards while exploring [[Nazjatar]]. I believe that I have found yet another cache for us to liberate.

Some time ago, I noticed a mysterious looking [[chest]]. It is held in an extremely dangerous area, so whatever it contains must be valuable.

We should embark on a mission to liberate the contents of the cache. Whatever is inside is better used in our hands than the hands of the enemy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
