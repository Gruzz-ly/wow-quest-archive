==Objectives==
Ask [[Instructor Ulooaka]] about the deteriorating cragscales.
* [[Deteriorating Cragscales]] (provided)

==Description==
<As you peel the hide from the creature's body, you notice numerous scales break off the skin, tearing holes that render portions of the hide useless. The [[Ankoan]] seem to have mastered using the material, perhaps Instructor Ulooaka could share some of his insights.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Skinning Technique: Cragscale (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
I have seen this many times. The scales of these [[beast]]s are not just part of the skin, but connected by tough muscle and sinew. This allows the creature to move through the crushing depths easier. When you are ready to remove the hide, do it in two passes. The first to cut these sinuous fibers, the second to flay it. You will find more of the hide will be usable.
