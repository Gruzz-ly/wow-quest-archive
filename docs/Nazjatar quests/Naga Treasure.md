==Objectives==
Loot the Mysterious Cache.
* [[Mysterious Cache]] looted

==Description==
The [[naga]] have stashed away the spoils of their wars throughout [[Nazjatar]].

Earlier while we were adventuring, I noticed a mysterious looking cache. The [[chest]] is located deep within naga territory, so I imagine that whatever is inside is most likely extremely valuable.

We should retrieve the contents of the cache. Whatever is inside is better used in our hands than the hands of the enemy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Mysterious Azshari Chest

==Completion==
<The reinforced latches on the chest open with a loud thud, revealing the contents within.>

==Notes==
The chest is located in [[Frostbrine Cave]].{{Co|56|8|Nazjatar}}
