==Objectives==
Investigate [[Oculeth]]'s old workshop.
* Trap Bypassed
* [[Oculeth's Notes]]

==Description==
The [[nightborne]] are no strangers to this place. It was once our capital too, long ago.

Before the [[Great Sundering|Sundering]] and erecting the shield over [[Suramar City|Suramar]] we used to travel freely to [[Zin-Azshari]]. Oculeth had a workshop in these estates. 

Perhaps it might contain some secrets or [[magic]] that went undisturbed by the survivors.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
Have you found the workshop yet?

==Completion==
Why am I not surprised. Still, these notes may prove useful.

==Notes==
...

==Progression==
{{Turning the Tide Horde}}
