==Objectives==
Collect 8 Tomes of Binding.
* [[Tome of Binding]] (8)

==Description==
The [[naga]] use dark, forbidden rituals to subjugate the elements to their will.

But such rituals threaten to destroy the elemental balance that binds [[Azeroth|this world]] together. The rituals must be stopped.

Fortunately, the rituals the naga use are too elaborate to commit to memory. The ritual instructions are contained within ancient texts.

If we destroy the ancient tomes that contain the rituals, the knowledge will be lost to the naga forever.

Retrieve the tomes and I will see that they are destroyed{{sic}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*2x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]
*100x [[Nazjatar Ally - Farseer Ori]]

==Progress==
Do you have the tomes?

==Completion==
I will see to it that the tomes of binding are destroyed at once. May [[Neptulon]] guide your journey, <class>.

==Progression==
