==Objectives==
Visit [[Vim's Round]].

==Description==
You may have noticed by now that me and the [[sea giant]]s get along great.

They mostly just want to be left alone. They want to laugh, and they want to tell you stories that make no sense.

A simple life.

We do share one interest, aside from killing [[naga]], that is sampling interesting brews.

[[Maedin]] recently brought in a lovely new keg, I hid it away. When it is ready to be opened, that round will be on me!

Come, take a look!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

"The best brews are the ones shared with friends.">
