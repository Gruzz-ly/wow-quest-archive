==Objectives==
Ask [[Rolm]] about the deteriorating cragscales.
* [[Deteriorating Cragscales#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
<As you peel the hide from the creature's body, you notice numerous scales break off the skin, tearing holes that render portions of the hide useless. The [[Unshackled]] seem to have mastered using the material, perhaps Rolm could share some of his insights.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Skinning Technique: Cragscale (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
I've seen THIS before. See, the scales of these [[beast]]s are not just part of the skin, but are connected with muscle and sinew. This allows the creature to move through the crushing depths easier. When you are ready to remove the hide, do it in two passes. The first to free the scales, the second to actually skin it. That way more of the hide will be usable.
