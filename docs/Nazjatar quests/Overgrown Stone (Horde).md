==Objectives==
Show the Overgrown Stone to Finder Palta in Newhome in Nazjatar.
* [[Overgrown Stone (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<A stone taken from the [[Algan|earthy elemental]] you recently defeated, covered in kelp and various other underwater plants.

You have not seen many such creatures in the deeps. Perhaps there is a story to them.

One of your new undersea allies may know more.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Hey, what's that? Really fuzzy rock you've got there.

It's from one of those earthy elementals? Oh, neat, yeah I can use that. Things grow on them like crazy, I just need to plant it in the garden and the next crop will be great.

Not sure where the elementals came from. We don't see many of them around, they're quite rare.

Anyway, thanks! Think I'm going to make my own kelp garden with this one.
