==Objectives==
Speak with Lady [[Jaina Proudmoore]] to observe the scouting party.
* Vision witnessed

==Description==
We cannot hide here forever, <name>. [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] must be dealt with.

It would be an act of folly to assault [[Eternal Palace|her palace]] without knowing what defenses she has in place. I dispatched a scouting team while you were gone, but they have not reported back.

I'm getting concerned, <name>. Let me know when you're ready and I'll perform a ritual to see what has happened to our [[scout]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 20x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]
* 26,800 [[XP]]

You will be able to choose from:
*[[Benthic Leggings]]
*[[Benthic Treads]]
*[[Benthic Gauntlets]]

==Progress==
Are you ready?

==Completion==
The [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]]! Of course...

==Notes==
;Vision witnessed
{{gossip|Jaina, can you show us the area around the palace?}}

A cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Lady Zharessa|Queen Azshara, more landwalkers approach.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|They seek the Tidestone... but I will not leave it unguarded as they so foolishly did.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|You are bound to the Tidestone's might, Zharessa. Use it to wash away this unsightly intrusion.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Zharessa|At once, my queen!}}

After the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|The Tidestone of Golganneth! That must be how she was able to part the sea!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|So long as Azshara controls that artifact, we are all in grave danger. She could flood Nazjatar in an instant.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|We cannot allow that to happen. We must find a way to break the barrier and secure the Tidestone.}}
