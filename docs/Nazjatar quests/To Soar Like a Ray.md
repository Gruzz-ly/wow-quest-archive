==Objectives==
Bring back 7 [[fathom ray]] [[egg]]s.
* [[Fathom Ray Egg]] (7)
*[[Swim Jet]] (provided)

==Description==
I like to find the eggs of the fathom rays before they hatch so we can form a bond with them.

At least, when we can't swim, we can fly!

Bring me a few more eggs to start a new thing - we'll call them Rayriders!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Did you find many eggs?

==Completion==
Ah! Perfect! Soon we will feel the wind!
