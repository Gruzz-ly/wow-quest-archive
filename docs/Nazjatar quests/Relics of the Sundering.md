==Objectives==
Collect 10 Highborne Relics.
* [[Highborne Relic (Nazjatar)]] (10)

==Description==
It's not every day that you encounter the remnants of a lost civilization beneath the ocean!

I never would have imagined that I'd have the opportunity to explore the lost city of [[Nazjatar]]... and on solid ground at that!

There are many secrets here to uncover. If you come across any ancient [[highborne]] artifacts, please bring them to me. These relics could provide us with valuable clues regarding the mysteries of the [[Great Sundering]].

I feel as though we are barely scratching the surface so far...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Whatever mysteries were hidden here beneath the ocean are now waiting to be revealed!

==Completion==
Excellent work! Look at all of these highborne relics you've found! I will begin examining them at once.
