==Objectives==
Help [[Shandris Feathermoon]] search the [[Drowned Market]].
* [[Weeping Sanya]] found
* [[Swiftfingered Tynala]] found
* [[Merchant Renrotta]] found

==Description==
Champion, I have a personal favor to ask of you that I do not feel I can ask of any of my [[sentinels]].

This... this is not on behalf of the [[Alliance]], or the [[Fourth War|war]], or even our battle against [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]. This is a favor for me.

When I was a little girl, [[Ara-Hinam|my city]] was attacked by the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. Many of the survivors fled here only to drown or worse. I must know their fate.

Will you help me search for signs?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
He... he may be here. [[Janius]]... no.

:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I knew many of these people. They were my friends... my loved ones... all of them are gone...}}

;Sanya
:{{text|yell|Janius! Where are you?!}}
:{{text|say|Janius, no! I couldn't... save you...}}

;Tynala
I didn't want to steal the pudding, but I needed the food.

{{gossip|Have you seen Janius?}}
:Janius? Oh yeah!
:He's nice but sad. Always looking for [[Shandris Feathermoon|his friend]]. He never told on me when he saw me stealing from someone's cart. Said he was from a small town like Ara... [[Ara-Hinam|Ara-something]].
:He said he was going to try to see the Queen. Didn't you hear? Queen Azshara is right down the street! Maybe I'll get to see her if I get away from these nasty guards.

;Renrotta
:{{Text|yell|Where is Janius? What have you done with him?!}}
:{{Text|yell|He is just a boy. Please, take Janius away from this madness before it is too late.}}
