==Objectives==
Loot the Lambent Lockbox.
* [[Lambent Lockbox]] looted

==Description==
The [[naga]] have filled [[Nazjatar]] with the ill-gotten spoils of war. We should reclaim whatever we come across in our effort to put an end to their tyranny once and for all.

I noticed a strange looking [[chest]] in a cave nearby. It appeared to be of naga make.

We should claim the contents of the cache. There may be valuable items inside that will help us in our battle against the naga.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Faintly Glowing Supplies

==Completion==
<The lid of the softly glowing lockbox opens without a sound.>

==Notes==
The chest is located in the [[Void Chamber]].{{Co|38|43|Nazmir}}
