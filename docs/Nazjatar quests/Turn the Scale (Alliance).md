==Objectives==
Collect 20 Hydra Scales.
* [[Hydra Scale]] (20)

==Description==
I am in need of your help, <class>. I have been hunting the nearby [[hydra]]s for their scales, but my weapon was broken in the melee.

The scales of the hydra make durable and resilient armor for our warriors. [[Waveblade Ankoan|Our clan]] requires the scales to craft and repair our armor.

If we do not resupply soon, we will be ill-equipped in our fight against the [[naga]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Have you completed the hunt?

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. These scales will help us greatly in our war against the naga.
