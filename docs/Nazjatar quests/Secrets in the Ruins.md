==Objectives==
Search for items of power.
* [[Highborne Text|Texts]] found (3)
* [[Ghost|Spirits]] questioned (3)

==Description==
This was once a place of great power. The [[highborne]] who lived here would host lavish parties, living in splendor.

[[Zin-Azshari]] was once on the shores of the [[Well of Eternity]] and drew powerful [[mage]]s from all over the [[Kaldorei Empire|empire]] to study here. I suspect, despite the many years at the bottom of the sea, there are still treasures and powerful artifacts hidden away here.

Speak with the spirits that remain and see what you can find. There must be something to help us overcome the Guardian of the Tidestone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
What have you discovered, <name>?

==Completion==
The Javelins of Azshara? I've never heard of such an item. Unless they mean the [[Javelins of Suramar]]? That would be a wondrous find!

==Notes==
;Speak with [[Gregarious Aristocrat]]s
{{Gossip|I wondered if you knew anything about magical artifacts here in Zin'Azshari.}}

Zin-Azshari is the home of many noble estates, most of whom collect objects of great power. Only after our Queen has no use for them of course.

{{Gossip|What a beautiful city. How long have you lived here?}}

I lived here my entire life. I am proud to be Highborne.

:{{Gossip|Are there any Handmaiders on Azshara nearby?}}
:The Handmaidens serve their Queen at the Temple of Elun'alor.

:{{Gossip|Are you aware you're dead?}}
:''They attack.''
