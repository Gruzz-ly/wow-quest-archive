==Objectives==
Follow the residue trail to locate the Azerite Weapons Cache.
* [[Azerite Weapons Cache]] located
* [[Residue Detector]] (provided)

==Description==
I've fashioned a device that will emit bioluminescent light when toggled on, allowing you to see any [[:Azerite]] residue that lingers.

It should give you a clear trail to the weapons cache.

Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
<Although tightly sealed, the radiating energy and weight suggest that the crate contains Azerite weapons.>

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I will lead our allies back to safety. Be careful, <name>. The [[naga]] will not part with their armaments easily.}}

Using the quest item provides you with the Bioluminescent Light buff. Follow the blue path to the cache.
