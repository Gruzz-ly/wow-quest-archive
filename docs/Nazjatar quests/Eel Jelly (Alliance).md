==Objectives==
Show the Eel Jelly to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Mezzamere]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Eel Jelly (item)]]

==Description==
<You examine the corpse of the abyssal [[eel]], only to find it bathed in a strange slime.

The slime coats your hands and arms, and seems quite difficult to remove.

One of your deep sea allies may know more about it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Eel jelly? What have you gotten yourself into? Eels, I would guess.

Here, let me remove it from you. We have many uses for it, if you can believe it. Few other things can make things slick, here beneath the waves. You may find it useful as well.

<Itanu rubs some jelly on your arms and legs.>

You will slide between coral like the tides now, friend.

==Progression==
...
