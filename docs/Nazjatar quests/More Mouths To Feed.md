==Objectives==
Collect 30 Snapshell Flesh.
* [[Snapshell Flesh]] (30)
* [[Hunting Knife]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[naga]] attack us relentlessly, so there is precious little time to hunt for food and supplies.

You have brought many [[soldier]]s to our camp, so we must hunt while we have the chance or we will soon run out of food.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
The meat from this hunt shall nourish our bones.

==Completion==
There is nothing like fresh meat to strengthen the bones and lift the spirits of weary soldiers!

==Notes==
;Approach
:{{text|say|[[Tracker Onu]]|[[Hunter Akana|Akana]], over here! It is good that you have arrived.}}
:{{text|say|Hunter Akana|Greetings, Onu. How goes the hunt?}}

;Accept
:{{text|say|Hunter Akana|Let us aid Onu with the hunt. Now that we have joined forces with your [[Alliance]], there are many mouths to feed.}}

Beside Onu are samples of what you're going after: [[Snapshell Tortoise]]s. [[Snapshell Hatchling]]s also count. Once you've killed a mob make sure to use the knife on the corpse to collect your quest items.
