==Objectives==
Question the [[Ghost|spirits]] in the [[Highborne Estates]] to discover something useful.
* First clue gathered
* Second clue gathered
* Third clue gathered

==Description==
So many [[soul]]s perished beneath the waves. Too many sacrificed for her ambition.

It is strange that the spirits here have not departed. I wonder if they even know they are dead?

Still, their knowledge might be useful to us. If you could question the spirits, they might be able to point us in the right direction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
I hope they can find some sort of peace once this is all over.

==Completion==
The [[Javelins of Suramar|Javelins]]? I thought them lost!

==Notes==
{{Gossip|What do you know of the Tidestone?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Highborne Noble]]|The [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]]? Truly a potent relic, capable of controlling the seas. It is capable of producing a powerful barrier that only the strongest of our [[magic]] can pierce. If you would like to study it, you may appeal to the [[scholar]]s of [[Nar'thalas Academy]], where it is located.}}

{{Gossip|What is the strongest magic left in Zin-Azshari?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Highborne Magus]]|Our glorious queen is the most powerful [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] to have ever lived. There is nothing she cannot accomplish! Why, the Javelins alone could pierce nearly any ward, maybe even one she made. It is a good thing they are in her position then, is it not?}}

{{Gossip|What do you know of the Javelins?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Highborne Guardian]]|Ah yes, they are quite the sight! A gift from our sister city, they possess power worthy to be bestowed to our queen. Nevertheless, she has no need for such paltry items. I believe she has bestowed them on Lady Silaszi, one of her current favored handmaidens.}}

Sometimes, the ghosts will turn into [[banshee]]s or [[spectre]]s.

*{{Text|say|Enraged Specter|You conspire against our queen?!}}
