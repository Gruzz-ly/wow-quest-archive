==Objectives==
Show the Pearlescent Shell to [[Finder Palta]] in [[Newhome]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Pearlescent Shell (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<A large, hardened shell of a vanquished [[hermit crab]].

The shell itself was much larger than the [[crab]], and shines in different colors when you look at it at different angles.

Surely someone back at Newhome would be interested in this beautiful shell.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
That's a big shell! Like the sheen on it, too. Really catches the light, especially now that we can see the sun directly.

You know what I haven't made in a while? With all this fighting and barely surviving? Jewelry. I miss it! We used to find all kinds of things to wear dropped by your ships.

<Palta smashes the shell into many pieces and holds two irregular shards up to her ears.>

Well, how do I look?

<Do you answer?>
