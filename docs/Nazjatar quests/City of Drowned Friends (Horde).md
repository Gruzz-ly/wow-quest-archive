==Objectives==
Help [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]] search the [[Drowned Market]].
* [[Weeping Sanya]] found
* Speak with [[Swiftfingered Tynala]]
* [[Merchant Renrotta]] found

==Description==
Champion, I have a personal favor to ask of you. This is not on behalf of the [[Horde]] or the [[Fourth War|war]] effort.

It has been over ten thousand years since I last walked these streets. I knew many of these people, even trained some of them.

Will you walk with me as I learn their fates? The road is dangerous, and I do not trust myself to maintain calm as I try to resurface old grief.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
[[Abyssal Commander Sivara‎|Sivara]]. Oh Sivara. She was the finest pupil I ever taught. I must find her and ensure she is not locked in eternal torment like these others.

==Notes==
;Sanya
:{{Text|yell|Weeping Sanya|Hurry, Sivara! The city is flooding!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Sivara... my most gifted student. It was on my recommendation that she enrolled in the Royal Academy.}}

;Tynala
I didn't want to steal the pudding, but I needed the food.

{{Gossip|Have you seen Arcanist Sivara?}}

You know Arcanist Sivara? I just saw her! She has such pretty hair.

I heard she was trained by First Arcanist Thalyssra. She is super fancy.

Anyway, I saw Arcanist Sivara walk by just a few minutes ago. I think she is going to see the Queen. Didn't you hear? Queen Azshara is right down the street! Maybe I'll get to see her if I get away from these nasty guards.

;Renrotta
:{{Text|yell|Merchant Renrotta|Thalyssra! Vile witch! You were the one who convinced my sister to serve at the palace.}}
:{{Text|yell|Merchant Renrotta|Sivara... never... should... have listened to... you... Thalyssra.}}

:''Thalyssra runs to see an [[Image of Queen Azshara]].''
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|You would presume to challenge my [[magic]], Thalyssra? Allow me to demonstrate why you never ascended to Grand Magistrix.}}

==Progression==
