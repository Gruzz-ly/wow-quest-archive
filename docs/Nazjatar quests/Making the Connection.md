==Objectives==
Search the ruins of [[Kal'methir]] for [[magic]]al relics.
* [[Arcane Scroll]]
* [[Discarded Staff]]
* [[Cracked Sphere]]
* Return to [[Thalyssra]]

==Description==
A communication crystal! Have they survived this long?

We used to use these to communicate. They allowed us to project [[Projection|images]] of ourselves to other nearby crystals to see and speak with those on the other end.

<Thalyssra examines the crystal for a few moments.>

The magic has long since depleted from the crystal. We will need a power source, preferably something just as old as this.

Check our surroundings, but be careful. It is too quiet out here....

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
Have you found anything to power the crystal?

==Completion==
This should work if they have sufficient power....

==Notes==
Upon looting the items, a [[Zanj'ir Stalker]], two [[Prowling Snapdragon]]s, and two [[Enraged Specter]]s will appear.

;Upon return
:''An [[Image of Azshara]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|How quaint of you to restore these remnants of a simpler age.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Azshara! She has found us!}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|This is my realm, child. Not so much as a single [[spell]] can be cast in [[Nazjatar]] without my knowledge.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I am First Arcanist Thalyssra of [[Suramar]], and you are not my [[queen]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|I know who you are, rude little Thalyssra. You presume to refer to yourself as "First Arcanist"? How... ambitious.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|[[Zin-Azshari]] is wondrous to behold, but do be careful. It would be a pity for you to suffer harm before I can grant you a proper audience.}}
:''The image teleports.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We should move forward, <name>. Azshara's preening must not distract us from our goal.}}
