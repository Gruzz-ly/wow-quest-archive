==Objectives==
Kill the Eye of the Corruptor.
* [[Eye of the Corruptor]] slain

==Description==
The [[Ankoan]] must contend with threats from not only the [[naga]], but also the horrors of [[N'Zoth]]. We learned early that if we allow his infection even the smallest purchase, he will grow and corrupt everything.

There is a great evil who is lingering near the waterway that flows through this place. It must be dealt with.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
It is much like tending a garden. The weeds must be cleared regularly.

==Completion==
Another will take it's{{sic}} place, eventually. Like clearing weeds from a garden, it's a constant battle against invasion.

==Progression==
{{Turning the Tide Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
