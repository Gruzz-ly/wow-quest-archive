==Objectives==
Visit [[Atolia Seapearl]] in [[Newhome]].

==Description==
Hmm. I am not admitting to anything, but there is a very small chance that I could have possibly, but not definitely, been mistaken about your whole... thing.

On the off chance we were still tolerating each other, Atolia mentioned she had another delivery for you.

We should swing through Newhome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Unshackled Commendation Crate
}}

==Completion==
We [[Unshackled]] help each other.

This has helped us grow. This has kept us strong... maybe not charming, but strong.

Vim is a good friend, especially once you get past his crustacean act.
