==Objectives==
Speak with [[Spiritwalker Ussoh]] to observe the scouting party.
* Vision witnessed

==Description==
We cannot hide here forever, <name>. We have to deal with [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]].

We will need to assault her [[Eternal Palace|palace]] but we do not know what defenses she has in place. I dispatched a scouting team while you were gone and they have not reported back.

I cannot afford to lose any more people. Speak with Spiritwalker Ussoh. His abilities will let us see where the [[scout]]s are.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 26,800 [[XP]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|q1=20|Prismatic Manapearl
}}

You will be able to choose from:
*[[Benthic Leggings]]
*[[Benthic Treads]]
*[[Benthic Gauntlets]]

==Progress==
Have you spoken with Ussoh yet?

==Completion==
The [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]]! Of course....

==Notes==
;Interact with Ussoh
{{Gossip|Spiritwalker Ussoh, can you show us the area around the palace?}}

:''A scene plays out.''
:{{Text|say|[[Lady Zharessa]]|Queen Azshara, more landwalkers approach.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Image of Queen Azshara]]|They seek the Tidestone... but I will not leave it unguarded as they so foolishly did.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|You are bound to the Tidestone's might, Zharessa. Use it to wash away this unsightly intrusion.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|At once, my queen!}}
:''Zharessa ends the scene.''

:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Azshara has the Tidestone of Golganneth? The recent invasions must have been a diversion!}}
:{{Text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|As long as she holds the Tidestone, she has the power to bring back the sea and drown us all at any moment.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Then it is imperative that we take control of it ourselves. We must find a way to break that barrier!}}
