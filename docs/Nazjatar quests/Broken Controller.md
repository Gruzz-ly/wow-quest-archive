==Objectives==
Free the slaves and destroy the Merciless Controller.

*Tell Nevin Tideheart in Newhome of your success.

==Description==
It is too late for me, my friends.

The Controllers work us and work us and we have no rest.

We have lost so many.

Please, free the others! Don't let them share my fate!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*100 [[Nazjatar Ally - Neri Sharpfin]]
*2 [[Prismatic Manapearl]]

==Progress==
Did we get them all?

==Completion==
Every kelfin we set free, makes the [[naga]] a little weaker.

I heal who I can.
