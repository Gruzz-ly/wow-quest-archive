==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lady Silazsi.png|Lady Silazsi|One of Queen Azshara's personal handmaidens, she has been trusted with one of the powerful Javelins of Suramar.}}
Retrieve the Javelin of Suramar.
* [[Javelin of Suramar]]

==Description==
The [[Javelins of Suramar]]!

Wielded by [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] herself, they contain immense [[magic]]al power. She has always had a fondness for bestowing favors on her favorites, but I never suspected she would give one something so valuable as one of her Javelins. This foe must be formidable indeed.

Nevertheless, <name>, we cannot let this opportunity pass us. Defeat the [[handmaiden]] and retrieve the relic!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
We cannot let her get away.

==Completion==
This just might work.

:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Here to admire the [[Highborne]]'s handiwork, Thalyssra? To look upon all that your hubris has wrought?}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Thalyssra|[[Suramar]] rebelled against Azshara. Were it not for our courage, the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s forces would have overwhelmed [[Azeroth]].}}

:''The [[Image of Queen Azshara]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|It breaks a queen's heart to watch her subjects squabble. Such a futile argument. In the end, you will all be mine again--one way or another.}}

:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|You see? We have found common ground already. Dear children, it is only a matter of time until you kneel before my throne. As a willing subject... or a broken corpse.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Thalyssra|Shandris. We sealed off [[Suramar City|Suramar]] to keep the [[Pillars of Creation]] free from Azshara's grasp. The power she holds with just the [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]]...}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I know. So long as it remains in her clutches, we have little hope of victory.}}
:''Shandris leaves.''
:{{Text|say|Image of Thalyssra|[[Zin-Azshari]] was once the center of all [[magic]]al knowledge. The key to wresting control of the Tidestone must lie amidst the ruins.}}

[[Lady Silazsi]] is located in the [[Elun'alor Temple]].
