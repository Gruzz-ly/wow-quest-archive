==Objectives==
Show the Frenzy Fang to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Mezzamere]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Frenzy Fang (item)]]

==Description==
<You remove a fully-grown fang from the fallen [[frenzy]].

You have heard of some seafaring groups that made weapons or decorations out of fangs found in the deeps, perhaps your new allies could find use for this?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
<Itanu holds the tooth between his fingers.>

The frenzies serve none but themselves.

You do not know of them.

<Itanu looks at the open sky.>

They cannot come here, now. Once they were a force that even the [[naga]] feared. Even their most powerful champions feared them.

What little light we would have would be doused, when the frenzies would come. Their numbers would blot out the sun. Their teeth would find all unhidden flesh.

You will never know the terror of the deeps, dry one.
