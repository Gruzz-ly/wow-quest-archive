==Objectives==
Meet with allies in the Cleft of Shadows.
* [[Nathanos]] in [[Nazjatar]] informed of [[Lor'themar]]'s plan ''(pro-Sylvanas)''
* Meet allies in the [[Cleft of Shadow]]s

==Description==
;Pro-Sylvanas
[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] was my [[Ranger-General]]. I have respected her for millennia. Making this choice is something I have been wrestling with for some time. [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]]'s death will tear the [[Horde]] apart. The [[Tauren]] will not stand for it and if they leave, I know they will not be the last.

We must save Baine. Not just for his life, but for the Horde. I can only hope once the time pressure is gone we may be able to reason with her but...

I have contacted allies who will help. Meet them in the Cleft of Shadows.

;Against Sylvanas
Sylvanas Windrunner was once my ranger-general. Now she is my [[warchief]]. Through peacetime and war, I followed her orders.

Until now.

Baine is an noble soul. His execution would drive a blade into the very heart of the Horde.

We must save him, <name>. It is the only way to preserve who we are. What we stand for.

I have reached out to allies who will help you. But in siding with them, you will put your own life in peril.

If you feel as I do, then meet them in the Cleft of Shadows. Good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Once again, we face dark times, <name>.

==Completion==
;Pro-Sylvanas
It is good to see you again, <name>. Quickly, Baine does not have much time.

;Against Sylvanas
Your aid is welcome, <class>.

Baine has little time left.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Baine Bloodhoof represents all that is best in the Horde. We cannot stand by and let his light be snuffed out.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|But know this: When the warchief learns of our defiance, her wrath will be swift... and terrible.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|In the end, we all must choose our path. And that choice will have consequences.}}

;Approaching [[Dark Earth]]
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|And take this. I have a feelin' ye be needin' it.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|You do what'chu gotta do. I be keeping an eye out for ya. Spirits be wit' ya mon.}}

;Speaking with Thrall
Baine will be executed within hours. We must act now. Many will see this as treason. But if we fail to act, all the Horde stands for will be lost.

{{Gossip|I am with you.}}
