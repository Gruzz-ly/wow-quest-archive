==Objectives==
Kill 10 naga within [[Zanj'ir Wash|Zanj'ir wash]] and the [[Deepsea Slave Pen]]s.
* [[Naga]] forces slain  (10)

==Description==
We've long believed that the ocean is big enough for all that wish to call it home.

Unfortunately, the naga don't see it that way.

They kill and capture our kind without remorse, and it's about time they paid the price.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
The naga are such cruel captors.

As long as they live, we'll never be safe.

==Completion==
If they're dead, they can't hurt me anymore.

If I keep telling myself that, soon enough I'll believe it, right?

==Notes==
*Eligible mobs are [[Zanj'ir Myrmidon]]s, [[Shirakess Apprentice]]s, [[Zanj'ir Scaleguard]]s, [[Shirakess Enthraller]]s, [[Shirakess Subjugator]]s, [[Zanj'ir Trapper]]s, and [[Lesser Zoatroid]]s.
