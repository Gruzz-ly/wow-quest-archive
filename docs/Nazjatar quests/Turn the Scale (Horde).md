==Objectives==
Collect 20 Hydra Scales from nearby [[hydra]].
* [[Hydra Scale]] (20)

==Description==
I have been trying to gather some of the scales from the young hydra nearby.

Their flexibility and strength makes them incredibly versatile.

With all the cranky old hydra tromping around, I don't stand much of a chance.

Can you gather some up for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Do you have enough?

==Completion==
You aren't as slow as I thought you'd be, with those land foots.

==Notes==
