==Objectives==
Show the Strange Organ to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Mezzamere]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Strange Organ (quest item)]]

==Description==
<You find a strange organ in the corpse of the mindbender. Upon picking it up, your head begins to throb.

The [[octopus]]-like [[Merciless one|creatures]] have long been one of [[Azeroth]]'s mysteries, this organ may shed some light on them.

Someone in Mezzamere may know more.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
The organ from a mind-squid, yes, I am familiar with them.

The children of [[Ozumat]] flood the deeps, too numerous to count.

They attack our thoughts with the aid of this organ. It makes a sound that speaks directly to the mind.

Let me show you.

<Itanu pushes on the organ, and your mind is assailed by a deafening psychic scream.>

The very creature itself seems built to harass the mind, and service the [[Old God|old ones]].

I will dispose of this now, away from the camp.
