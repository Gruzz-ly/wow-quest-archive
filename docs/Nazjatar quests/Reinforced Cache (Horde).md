==Description==
The heavily reinforced [[chest]] is of [[naga]] construction and appears to be reinforced with a heavy-duty lock of some kind.

Reinforcement aside, the cache still requires a key to unlock.

The key is most likely being held by one of the nearby naga [[Commander (rank)|commanders]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*2x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]
*100x [[Nazjatar Ally - Vim Brineheart]]

==Progress==
The chest is locked and requires a key.

==Completion==
As you turn the key you can hear the heavy latches of the chest snap open with considerable force...
