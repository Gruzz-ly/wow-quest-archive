==Objectives==
Collect 5 Angel Scale Starfish.
* [[Angel Scale Starfish]] (5)

==Description==
Our forward [[scout]]s have been using [[starfish]] scales as camouflage. The trouble is that the scales deteriorate too quickly. We are going to need more scales if we want to keep tabs on [[naga]] movements.

If you happen upon any Angel Scale Starfish, please deliver them to the quartermaster as soon as possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
