:{{Text|say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|The [[Horde]]'s [[Adventurer|champions]] will drive every last [[naga]] from the palace. Azshara will pay for what she's done.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]|[[Alliance]] heroes will dethrone the would-be queen. We won't seek a fight with you, Lor'themar, but we will not abide interference.}}
: ''Those gathered turn to see the [[Image of Queen Azshara]] when it appears in front of the [[Tidestone of Golganneth]].''
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|What have we here? Bitter rivals standing united around my Tidestone. I really do possess a gift for bringing my subjects together.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You can't stop us, Azshara. We are coming to end your reign.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|Stop you? My dear child, why would I want to stop you?}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|Consider this a formal invitation. My palace has been made ready. Your presence is eagerly anticipated.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|So many wonders lie in store. Such... magnificence.}}
:''The image disappears.''

;Completion
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Our victory rings hollow. Azshara's master will rise. Nothing can stop that now.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|For all her lies, [[Priscilla Ashvane]] spoke one truth. [[Fourth War|The war between the Alliance and Horde]] has kept us distracted. Divided, we have no hope against N'Zoth.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|We may have found common cause here in [[Nazjatar]], but the battle still rages beyond these waters. So long as [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] holds [[Orgrimmar]], there can be no lasting peace.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The war needs to end, Lor'themar. You know this to be true.}}
: ''Jaina firmly urges the Regent Lord. He sighs in resignation.''
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I had hoped that reason would prevail. But the time has come to finish this.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I will tell [[Blood elf|my people]] what transpired here. Of how Azshara fell because we stood together. Of the threat rising from the depths, and all that is at stake if we should fail.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Then I will take my place beside [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] and [[Thrall]], and pray that the sin'dorei stand with me.}}
