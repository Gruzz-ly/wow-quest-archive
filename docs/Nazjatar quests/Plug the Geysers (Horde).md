==Objectives==
Seal all of the unstable geysers.
* [[Unstable Geyser]] sealed (5)
* [[Disturbed Algan]] slain
*[[Benthic Sealant]] (provided)

==Description==
;1
Just keep watching this spot... any second now...

Once those geysers start firing, get in there and seal them up.

The more they shake, the more everything breaks apart!

We have to keep these things under control.

;2
We have been keeping an eye out for these unstable geysers.

Since the water went away, the ocean has been trying to find a way back in.

If we let it burst up just anywhere, we could all be doomed!

Help me plug these up!

Be careful, though, I found out the hard way they have a bit of a kick.

;3
Earthquakes! Snakes! Water coming from every direction.

What is going on around here?

Neri said to plug some holes in the defenses - didn't think she'd mean it literally.

Take some of this goo, next eruption, stick it in the hole.

;4
Have you heard about the geysers? 

All over the newly exposed areas, water trying to fill where it was pulled away.

The ocean, she is angry. I don't think she likes Azshara either.

We will keep filling this in until we can find a permanent fix.

;5
We're getting a geyser hit any minute now.

The effects of the Tidestone are far-reaching.

We have to do what we can to prevent any further destruction.

Use this sealant to stall off the next round of eruptions!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
;1
Good work!

I was hoping for a little help from the Reefwalkers, but we take what we can get!

;2
The ocean's own luck was with us! Well done, <race>.

;3
Yeah! That was some surftastic heroing!

;4
Thank you, friend.

I have a feeling that won't hold for long.

;5
Did it get you once? I feel like it got you.

Happens to the best of us! Great work.
