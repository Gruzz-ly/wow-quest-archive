==Objectives==
Collect 3 Piles of Flotsam.
* [[Pile of Flotsam]] (3)

==Description==
I have seen piles of flotsam in the sands to the west. If you could go out and scrounge anything useful from the debris, it could prove useful. Beware, that area is a [[hydra]] breeding ground and they have been growing more aggressive since the water receded.

Once you've gathered some supplies, return to the quartermaster for your reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
