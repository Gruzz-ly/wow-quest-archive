==Objectives==
Kill 10 naga within [[Zanj'ir Wash]] and the [[Deepsea Slave Pen]]s.
* [[Naga]] forces slain  (10)

==Description==
It is true that [[Waveblade Ankoan|my clan]] has been battling the naga for generations, but it was only in recent times that we took the fight to [[Nazjatar]].

Our leader was slain by the [[Queen Azshara|vile queen]], and now honor binds my clan to this deep ocean.

We will avenge their death or die here trying. It is our way.

Your mission aligns with our duty, so we will fight the naga together.

Slay their forces and bring us one step closer to honoring our promise.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
Our leader was slain by the vile queen, and now honor binds my clan to this deep ocean.

==Completion==
You fight like an [[Ankoan]]. You bring my clan honor with your actions today.
