==Objectives==
Rescue Imara, Adaru, and Umai from the clutches of mind-leeching [[Lesser Zoatroid|Zoatroids]].
* [[Imara]] rescued
* [[Adaru]] rescued
* [[Umai]] rescued

==Description==
[[Waveblade Ankoan|My clan]] came to [[Nazjatar]], eager to destroy the [[naga]] [[queen]].

We were not prepared for the darkness that she commands.

Our [[scout]]s knew this land best, but their knowledge now deteriorates as their minds are controlled by [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s forces.

Find and free our scouts, and you may still have a chance to access their knowledge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Compelled to do the mindless bidding of our enemies is a fate worse than death.

There is no honor in that life.

==Notes==
*Defeat [[Mind-Shackled Ankoan]]s to free the targets.
