==Objectives==
Show the Crackling Mandible to [[Finder Palta]] in [[Newhome]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Crackling Mandible (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<The mandible of a [[tidal guardian]], still crackling with electricity.

One of your new allies might have a use for this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Yowch! You've got to warn a person before you hand them something electric! You picked this up from a tidal guardian?

The tidal guardians have guarded the [[naga]] domain for as long as I can remember. It seems like they have always been intertwined, I can't recall ever having seen one in the wild.

They're really quite beautiful when they're swimming, mesmerizing even.

Anyway, I use these things to make drinks. You mix some kelpflower wine with a bit of ground mandible, really gives it a kick!
