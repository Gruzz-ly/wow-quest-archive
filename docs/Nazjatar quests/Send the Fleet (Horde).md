:''On the Horde's ship, Nathanos, wielding [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire]] and Lor'themar Theron are staring out at the docks. The camera shifts up revealing the Alliance fleet are after them.''
:'''Genn Greymane''': {{Text|Bossemote|Keep on them! We cannot let them escape!}}
:''The Aerial shot of the Alliance fleet chasing the Horde Fleet then zooms down into a shot of The Eternal Palace. Inside, The Naga Centuar reports to Queen Azshara who's staring at her reflection at the waterfall''.
:'''Naga Centuar''': {{Text|Bossemote|My queen...they have arrived.}}
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|Wonderful! Set the tidestone, won't you?}}
:''The Naga Centaur leaves. Azshara looks back seeing the shadowy tendrils''
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|Feeling Anxious, are we?}}
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|How frustrating it must be for you...still locked away.}}
:''The shadowy tendrils comes closer''
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|so powerless For now. Do not worry.}}
:''She turns to see the shadowy tendrils''
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|We've both waited so long...but at last...You're about to see what I do best.}}}
:''The sequence shifts to the Naga Centuar placing the [[Tidestone of Golganneth]] on the pedestal. It begins to glow creating a beam up top.''
:''The beam comes out of the sea. Nathanos smiled seeing this.''
:''Genn Greymane and the Alliance soldier reacted in horror as a massive rift in the ocean is created.''
:''The Alliance ship heads towards the rift''
:'''Alliance Soldier''': {{Text|Bossemote|She's not responding!}}
:'''Genn Greymane''': {{Text|Bossemote|Set the sails! Set the sails!}}
:''The Sails are pulled up but it was effortless''
:'''Alliance Soldier''': {{Text|Bossemote|We can't escape!}}
:''Genn Greymane hangs on but the Alliance ship fell and crashed. It then shifts to Lor'themar Theron waking up and he sees the horde ship into the area as Queen Azshara laughs.''
:'''Queen Azshara''': {{Text|Bossemote|Welcome to Nazjatar. I've been waiting for you.}}
