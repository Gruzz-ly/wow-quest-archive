==Objectives==
Support your allies in [[Nazjatar]] by getting one to rank 3.
*Reach rank 3 with an Ankoan ally

==Description==
We have much to do, <name>. However, we are all weary and require rest. Decisions made while fatigued are almost always the wrong ones to make.

The [[Ankoan]] have offered their home to us, yet they are barely holding on themselves. We should do what we can to support them while we think about our next move.

See what you can do to aid their hunting parties, it may be the only way we survive in this place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
*[[Pearl of Lucid Dreams]]

==Progress==
There is much to consider.

==Completion==
Good work. Your efforts have helped us establish some trust with our [[Waveblade Ankoan|new allies]] and gained some much-needed combat experience in this [[Nazjatar|strange place]].

They have entrusted us with this item, I sense incredible power within. It is clearly attuned to the Heart of Azeroth, you should take it. Hopefully it is of use to us.

==Progression==
{{Secrets in the Sea Alliance}}
