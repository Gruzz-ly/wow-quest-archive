==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Hoarder Moarrgl.png|Hoarder Moarrgl|Known collector of Deepsea Crystals.}}
Collect a Deepsea Crystal from [[Hoarder Moarrgl]].
* [[Deepsea Crystal]]

==Description==
Locating the weapons cache should not be a problem once we have the proper tools. A little light and a lot of bioluminescent fluid is all that is needed.

It all seems rather simple, does it not? But the key is in the Deepsea Crystal used to refract the light.

The [[Bloodfin tribe]] covets these crystals, so you should have no trouble obtaining one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* 5x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]

==Progress==
Have you found the crystal?

==Completion==
I can see why the Bloodfin covet these crystals. The gem is unlike any I've seen before.

==Progression==
{{Secrets in the Sea Alliance}}
