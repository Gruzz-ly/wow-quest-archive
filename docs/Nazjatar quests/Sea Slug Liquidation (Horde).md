==Objectives==
Collect 8 Bioluminescent Ooze from [[Luminescent Slug|Luminescent Sea Slugs]] within [[Bloodfin Village]].
* [[Bioluminescent Ooze]] (8)

==Description==
The [[:Azerite]] refinement process creates a byproduct that is invisible to the naked eye, but is easily seen with refracted bioluminescent light.

The sea floor is littered with creatures that produce just what we need to track down this weapons cache.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progress==
Do you have the ooze?

==Completion==
It's stickier than expected, but should still work.

==Notes==
*Click on Luminescent Slugs to collect the quest item.
