==Description==
Whatever [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] is up to, this *ahem* [[Nazjatar|great new landscape]] we have found ourself in is terribly inconvenient.

Too many getting too close to our home. We have moved most of the [[refugee]]s deeper into the cave.

Could you ask Telur to move our calling conch inside?

Grab some of [[Slen Darkroe|Slen]]'s Elixir and check in with [[Vim Brineheart|Vim]].

Once it is set up, test it out!

I'm off to do a progress check!

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
