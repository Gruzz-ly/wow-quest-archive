==Objectives==
Show the Half-Digested Deepcoral Pod to Finder Palta in Newhome in Nazjatar.
* [[Half-Digested Deepcoral Pod (item)#Horde]]

==Description==
<Upon inspection of this oddly-aggressive fathom ray, you find several halfway-digested pods.

You've seen similar pods on the coral of this region, it appears to be one of the foods of the fathom rays.

This may explain their strange ability to fly.

Finder Palta might know more.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Unshackled| The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Hey, you're back! What's that? Something you ate?

Oh, yeah, the fathom rays love these pods. They grow on the coral around the area, seem to be filled with gas.

I always thought it was just air but it appears it's lighter than air, I can fill a fishskin with what's in a pod and it floats above water!

Must help them survive in the deeps, somehow. Not sure how that works, life is a mystery, you know?
