==Objectives==
Loot the Mystic Chest.
* [[Mystic Chest]] looted

==Description==
We have uncovered many rare treasures while exploring [[Nazjatar]]. I believe that I have found yet another cache of valuable artifacts to retrieve.

Some time ago, I noticed a strangely glowing object in the distance. I believe that it may have been a treasure chest.

We should go and investigate the object. If it is a treasure chest, its contents may prove valuable in our quest to defeat the [[naga]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
