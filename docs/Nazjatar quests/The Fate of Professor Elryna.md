==Objectives==
Defeat the Snapdragon Matriarch, collect the [[Memory Core]], and activate the [[Memory Pylon]] to witness the fate of Professor Elryna.
* [[Snapdragon Matriarch]] slain
* [[Memory Core]]
* Fate of [[Professor Elryna]] witnessed
*[[Scroll of Bursting Power]] (provided)

==Description==
From the looks of it, Elryna's story should have a very interesting end. This pylon here has been acting up, but I think I know why!

These things use memory cores, little crystals found within the center of the orb. I bet there's one in that old [[Mage tower|magi tower]].

There's a [[snapdragon]] that's bigger than the terrormaws in there so here, keep the scroll for now. It should help in your fight. She's a big one!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
What happened that fateful day?

==Completion==
So. She was betrayed by that [[General (rank)|general]]?

He probably proceeded to take all the credit himself. 

Shame. But at least now we have the knowledge! Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
*After killing the snapdragon, loot the quest item from the [[Waterlogged Chest (Nazjatar)|Waterlogged Chest]].

:{{Text|say|General Huxzar|Very impressive indeed. I assume you have kept notes on this research?}}
:{{Text|say|Professor Elryna|That would be correct, General.}}
:{{Text|say|General Huxzar|Good.}}
:Huxzar kills Elryna and loots her.
