==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Ley Line Accumulators in [[Spears of Azshara]].
* [[Ley Line Accumulator]] destroyed (5)

==Description==
The [[naga]] are tapping into some latent power, infusing the energy into some manner of device.

I do not know what purpose they have for this power, but it is surely in our interest to destroy the objects before they can be used against us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Can you feel the magic in this place?

==Completion==
At times it is satisfying to break another's toys.

==Notes==
Once [[Dark Tides (Alliance)]], [[Disruption of Power (Alliance)]] and [[Fortunate Souls (Alliance)]] have been accepted, a few [[naga]] will rush the survivors.

:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Very well. Shandris, can you handle the naga ahead with our champion's help?}}
:{{Text|Say|Shandris Feathermoon|We will make them pay!}}
