==Objectives==
Return to [[Finder Palta]] in [[Newhome]] in [[Nazjatar]].

==Description==
<You discovered the history of [[Mad Mardivas|Mardivas]], a [[sorcerer]] that once lived in the [[Zin-Azshari|city]] and the crafter of the [[Arcane Chest|arcane chests]] scattered around Nazjatar.

From the sounds of it, he was not well-liked, which worked out for him, as he did not much like others.

You also found and unlocked one of his "unsolvable" [[arcane]] locks. This knowledge may prove useful on your journey.

Finder Palta will surely enjoy hearing the end of this tale.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Curios of Nazjatar]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Completion==
Hey, thanks for letting me know. Always wondered what was going on with those chests.

Not that I mind free treasures, mind you. All for them.

I'm sure it'd just steam his clams to know that you're going to end up with all of his stuff, ha!
