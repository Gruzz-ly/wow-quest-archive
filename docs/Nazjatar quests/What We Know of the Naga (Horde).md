==Objectives==
Tend to the [[Gilgoblin|Kelfin]]'s wounds and hear what [[Fenn]] has to say about the naga.
* [[Esma Lostfin|Esma]] bandaged
* [[Kono Kelpcurl|Kono]] bandaged
* [[Dried Kelp]] (provided)

==Description==
It feels good to be me again. I have you to thank for that.

My head still hurts from the [[Merciless one|zoatroid]]'s influence, but I think the others are worse off.

Put some of this salve on their wounds, and I'll do my best to tell you what I know about the [[naga]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

You will be able to choose from:
*[[Benthic Girdle]]
*[[Benthic Bracers]]
*[[Benthic Cloak]]

==Progress==
You're interrupting.

==Completion==
Whatever is hidden within the stronghold needs to be destroyed.
