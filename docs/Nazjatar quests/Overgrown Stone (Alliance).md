==Objectives==
Show the Overgrown Stone to Artisan Itanu in Mezzamere in Nazjatar.
* [[Overgrown Stone (item)]]

==Description==
<A stone taken from the [[algan|earthy elemental]] you recently defeated, covered in kelp and various other underwater plants.

You have not seen many such creatures in the deeps. Perhaps there is a story to them.

One of your new undersea allies may know more.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Oh hello, what have you there?

A fragment from a [[Algan|kelp-covered elemental]]? Most fortuitous. Such stones can be used to enhance the growth of most sorts of plants that we know of.

At times, I use them to grow healing wraps for us, when I can find them. The elementals themselves are quite rare.

I thank you for this donation.
