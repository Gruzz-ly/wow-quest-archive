==Objectives==
Rescue Farseer Ori.
* [[Farseer Ori]] found
* [[Prison Key|Prison key]]
* Farseer Ori rescued

==Description==
My master, Farseer Ori, has been imprisoned by the forces of [[Queen Azshara]].

Farseer Ori was captured while performing a sacred ritual to call upon the [[Elemental|elements]] for guidance. I managed to escape, but the ritual has been left unfinished.

If we do not rescue my master soon, the elements will grow even more restless.

The elemental balance must be maintained. I fear what may become of [[Waveblade Ankoan|my clan]] and our bond with the elements if Farseer Ori is not returned to us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
I fear whatever fate may have awaited me had you not rescued me when you did.
