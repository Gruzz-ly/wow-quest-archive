==Objectives==
Find [[Neri's Ruse]].

==Description==
You're not that bad for a... what was it? <race>?

I like when I am reminded to look past appearances. Ha!

But, really, speaking of hiding things in plain sight, I put some things in a [[naga]] crate. It is close to one of their camps in the [[Spears of Azshara]], so they will never suspect it belongs to me!

Let's go see if it is still there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
