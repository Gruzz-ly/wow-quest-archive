==Objectives==
See what is in [[Vim's Cache]].

==Description==
I sometimes amuse myself with excursions into [[Zanj'ir Terrace]], where the [[naga]] tough guys hang out.

I grab things that could be useful and stash them somewhere I can pick them up later.

I haven't been down there in a while.

I could have something in there you may find useful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]

==Progression==
