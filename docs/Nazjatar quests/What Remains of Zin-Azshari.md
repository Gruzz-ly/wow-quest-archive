==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I never expected to set eyes upon this city again.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Azshara. She sacrificed her people twice over. Once to the Legion. Again to N'Zoth.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|My sweet child. As a general, you should be familiar with sacrifice. A leader must ever serve the greater good.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|"Good"?! What "good" is there in trading your people's lives for power? In twisting them into aberrations?!}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Queen Azshara|Such a pity. It seems you do not yet understand. Not to worry. Very soon, you will.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I will savor the moment when we finally strike her down. Come. We must push deeper into Zin-Azshari.}}
