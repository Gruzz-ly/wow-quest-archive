==Objectives==
Meet with [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]] in [[Nazjatar]].

==Description==
Our situation is dire, <name>.

The [[Horde navy|Horde fleet]] was decimated by the attack on [[Dazar'alor]]. This [[naga]] trap has claimed much of what we had left.

Survivors report seeing the naga taking captives. Thalyssra has gone on ahead to see what she can do to help them. 

I will finish up here while you aid the First Arcanist's efforts. My rangers will provide what little aid they can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, <name>. I am glad you survived the attack.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|It seemed as if the [[Alliance]] [[ship]]s were about to capture us. Then the naga sprung their trap. What could those fiends be up to?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Go on ahead to Thalyssra. Cut down any naga you encounter along the way. Make them pay for every [[Horde]] life they have taken.}}

Starting with this quest, the extra button Farstrider Volley is available to aid you in attacking the enemies.
