==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Ley Line Accumulators in [[Spears of Azshara]].
* [[Ley Line Accumulator]] destroyed (5)

==Description==
The [[naga]] tap into the power within nearby [[ley line]]s and have found a way to harness it.

Destroy their devices before they can put that power to use against us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Perhaps we can use these ley lines to our advantage in the future...

==Completion==
Hopefully we will never find out what they were drawing in such power for.
