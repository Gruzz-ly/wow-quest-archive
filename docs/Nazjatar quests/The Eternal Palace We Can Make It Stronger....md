==Objectives==
Collect 20 Eternal Ornaments from the most powerful creatures of the [[Eternal Palace]]. 
* [[Eternal Ornament]] (20)

==Description==
Now that it's functioning, it occurred to me while repairing it that it has the capability to output even more energy.

Of course <that will / that'll> require stronger materials to upgrade and the only place I can think of is in the Eternal Palace.

[[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s army and even herself carry items of extraordinary power. If you could bring some of those back, I could at the very least test my theory and see if it's viable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|93|60|}}
*37,500 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with {{Alliance}} [[Waveblade Ankoan]] or {{Horde}} [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
*[[Empowered Abyssal Focus]]

==Progress==
How goes the search for those items?

==Completion==
Yes, these will do nicely. Good work, <name>.

I'll get started right away on upgrading the core.

==Notes==
It should be noted that as the guaranteed drop rate rewarded increases by raid difficulty, this quest and the next one should only be taken if you at least regularly raid in heroic mode. The reward rate in LFR and normal mode is so low it is considered to not be worth doing.
