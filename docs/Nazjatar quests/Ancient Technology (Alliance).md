==Objectives==
Bring the Broken Power Core to [[Instructor Ulooaka]] in [[Mezzamere]].
* [[Broken Power Core (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Given the experience you've had with the [[naga]] and the power they wield, you wonder if using their own power against them might not garner you a powerful advantage.

Perhaps Instructor Ulooaka back at Mezzamere could help you repair this core and put it to use against the naga invasion.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
What's this you've brought me?

<Instructor Ulooaka looks over the broken power core and arcs an eyebrow. You ask him if he thinks it could be used against the naga.>

Actually, I believe it could. But probably not in the way you think.
