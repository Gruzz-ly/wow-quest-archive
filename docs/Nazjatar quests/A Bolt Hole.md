==Objectives==
Meet with [[Shandris Feathermoon]] at [[Utama's Stand]].
* Base found

==Description==
<Name>, we must seek out a powerful weapon to combat the [[naga]] who guard the [[Tidal Conflux]]. I am certain such an object would be in the hands of one of [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s minions.

Thanks to our [[Waveblade Ankoan|new allies]], we've tracked down the location of one of her [[handmaiden]]s within the ruins of [[Zin-Azshari]]. The journey will be quite dangerous. Thankfully our allies have a location nearby that we can use as a staging ground.

I've marked the location on your map, meet with me there as soon as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

== Progress ==
A suitable base would be easily defensible by a few warriors, not attackable from the air, preferably with a fresh water source.

==Completion==
Yes. This place will do nicely. It is easily defended and has safe access to the ruins.

== Notes ==
;Base found
: ''Shandris, [[Blademaster Okani]] and [[Chie]] run up the road and into the building.''
:{{text|say|Blademaster Okani|We often make camp here when venturing into the ruins.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I see you are well versed in this type of warfare. We are off of the main road and can easily reinforce this position.}}

==Progression==
{{Turning the Tide Alliance}}
