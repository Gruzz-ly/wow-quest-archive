==Objectives==
Collect 10 Elemental cores.
* [[Elemental Core (Nazjatar)]] (10)

==Description==
Holding back the tide walls is not an easy task, even using the [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]]. The ebb and flow of the [[magic]]al energies in the area are too inconsistent.

We need to shore up our magical reserves, which requires [[mana]] batteries, if you will. The befouled [[elemental]]s along the canal here are created with exactly the elemental cores we need.

The goal is two fold. Clearing out the befouled elementals, before their corruption spreads, but also retrieving their cores, so we can keep the water at bay.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
How goes your hunt?

==Completion==
We will get these back to [[Jaina Proudmoore|Admiral Proudmoore]].

==Progression==
{{Turning the Tide Alliance}}
