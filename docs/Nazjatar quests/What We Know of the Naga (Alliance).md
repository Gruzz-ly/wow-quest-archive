==Objectives==
Tend to the [[Ankoan]]'s wounds and hear what [[Adaru]] has to say about the [[naga]].
* [[Umai]] bandaged
* [[Imara]] bandaged
* [[Dried Kelp]] (provided)

==Description==
I owe you a debt. That much is clear.

My mind still reels from the [[Merciless one|zoatroid]]'s influence, but I fear the others suffer more visible wounds.

Apply this salve to their wounds, and I will do my best to share what I know of the naga.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one from:
*[[Benthic Girdle]]
*[[Benthic Bracers]]
*[[Benthic Cloak]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Progress==
I will tell you what I know of the naga.

==Completion==
Whatever is hidden within the stronghold needs to be destroyed.
