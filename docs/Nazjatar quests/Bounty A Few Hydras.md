==Objectives==
Kill 10 hydras.
* [[Hydra]]s slain (10)

==Description==
Our forces are desperately outmatched when it comes to the hydras. They are ferocious, tenacious, and deadly. We have retreated almost entirely out of the western region of [[Nazjatar]].

If we are going to hold the line against the [[naga]], we need to make sure the western region is safe for our forces. Destroy as many hydras as you can manage, then report to the quartermaster.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]
* +50 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
