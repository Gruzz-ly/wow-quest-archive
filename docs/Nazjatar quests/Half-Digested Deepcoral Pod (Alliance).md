==Objectives==
Show the Half-Digested Deepcoral Pod to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Mezzamere]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Half-Digested Deepcoral Pod (item)]]

==Description==
<Upon inspection of this oddly-aggressive [[fathom ray]], you find several halfway-digested pods.

You've seen similar pods on the coral of this region, it appears to be one of the foods of the fathom rays.

This may explain their strange ability to fly.

Artisan Itanu might know more.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Hello again, have you come to trade?

Ah yes, the coral produces such pods. The fathom rays have a liking for them, we can sometimes lure one into a trap with them, to tame or consume.

The pods are filled with a gas of some sort, I have never ventured to breathe it myself, but I surmise this diet now keeps the rays aloft.

The creatures of the deeps have not seen the air before, yet I could not have foreseen such an outcome. It is fascinating.
