==Objectives==
Show the Opaline Conch to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Mezzamere]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Opaline Conch (item)]]

==Description==
<The conch slumps following your assault -- the battle appears to be over.

It doesn't move. You bend over and pick it up, instinctively turning it over, wary of any attack.

It appears to be dead, but intact. You consider bringing the entire conch back to your allies in Mezzamere.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Ah, a great find.

<Itanu takes the conch from you and flips it over. Before you can see it, he has a small knife in hand. The conch is quickly speared, the slug within removed.>

Most delightful! It would ruin it to touch fire. This... is a delicacy. It must be savored.

<Itanu closes his eyes and breathes deeply, then devours the snail in a single gulp.>

Hm, mm. Slimy, oddly rough on the insides. 

Magnificent.
