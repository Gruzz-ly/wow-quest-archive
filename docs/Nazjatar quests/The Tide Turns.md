==Objectives==
Assault the [[naga]] camp and seize control of the [[Tidestone of Golganneth]].
*Sound the advance
*Assault the [[Gorgonian Overlook]]
*[[Commander Kresh]] slain
*Throw the Javelin of Suramar
*[[Lady Zharessa]] slain

==Description==
The time to strike is now. We must take the Tidestone of Golganneth and the [[Javelins of Suramar|Javelin of Suramar]] is our best chance of piercing the barrier around it.

Every minute we wait is another minute when the sea can come crashing down on us. What forces we have will be arrayed below, just outside their encampment.

We will need your strength in addition to the Javelin, <name>. We do not have enough forces to take it on our own.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Unshackled|The Unshackled]]
*25x [[Prismatic Manapearl]]

==Completion==
Quickly, the Tidestone!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I will marshal our forces. We will meet you near the Tidestone.}}

;Arriving at the destination
The Alliance group include [[Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Genn Greymane]], [[Blademaster Okani]], and [[Alliance Skirmisher]]s. Horde group consists of Lor'themar, Thalyssra, [[Atolia Seapearl]], and [[Horde Skirmisher]]s.

:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Your arrival is timely. They seem to be spoiling for a fight.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|I thought I smelled an ambush....}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|This is our best opportunity to seize the Tidestone from Azshara's grasp.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Their champion holds the Javelin of Suramar. We should hear what they have to say.}}

;Interacting with Lor'themar
This is it. It will have to do.

Are you ready to begin the assault?

{{Gossip|I am ready. Sound the advance!}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Thalyssra, there is little our troops can do against the guardian. We shall assault the nearby naga camp to buy you the time you need.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Very well. We must distract the guardian so our champion can breach her defenses. Lady Proudmoore, we stand a better chance if we work together.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Your plan is sound. Let's see it done.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Be warned that if I catch even the scent of treachery, I will tear you to shreds.}}
:''The group marches towards the Gorgonian Overlook.''

;Entering Gorgonian Overlook
:''The player is joined by Lor'themar and Genn.''
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I shall accompany you. Together, we will strike at the heart of the camp.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Two against one, is it? You are right to beware of me, elf.}}

To fill up the bar, kill [[Zanj'ir Defender]]s, [[Zanj'ir Bulwark]]s, [[Azsh'ari Stormwitch]]es and interact with [[Barricade (Nazjatar)|Barricades]] and [[Scroll of Aquatic Abjuration|Scrolls of Aquatic Abjuration]].

*{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Hmph. You fight well... for an elf.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|And you fight well for a wolf.}}

*{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Impressive, Greymane. A pity we never had the honor of facing one another on the battlefield.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|How fortunate that we never did. It would have been a waste to kill you.}}

;Bar filled
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Our soldiers can handle the rest. Now for their leader.}}

;Kresh attacked and killed
:{{Text|say|Commander Kresh|No escape, landwalker!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Strike now, champion! Throw the Javelin!}}

Use the extra button to throw the javelin. A scene plays out.

Jaina and Thalyssra are no longer under a protective barrier but attacked Zharessa.

:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|I do not need the Tidestone's power to defeat you! I am the queen's champion!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|Merely glimpsing my queen's visage would strike you blind.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|Impudent wretches! You shall all drown!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|Nazjatar will be your grave!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Zharessa|No! I... cannot fail... my queen....}}

;Upon completion
:''A scene plays out. Lor'themar, Jaina, Thalyssra, and Genn walk towards the Tidestone.''
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Azshara's forces are routed. We have broken her hold on the Tidestone.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Our way into the palace remains blocked.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The Tidestone's power could be used to shatter the barrier...}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|But I cannot control its energies on my own.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Perhaps we could... together.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|So be it.}}
:''Jaina and Thalyssra channel a spell through the Tidestone and shatter the barrier.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|It is done. The way is open.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Azshara's reign must end.}}
