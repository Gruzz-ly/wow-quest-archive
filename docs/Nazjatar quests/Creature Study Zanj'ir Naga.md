;Description during early testing
There is much to learn from the creatures that inhabit this deep sea, though we must do our best not to disrupt the fragile ecology. 

I've enchanted a scroll to collect valuable data from a specimen without being unnecessarily invasive. 

This way, we can ensure that information is recorded and passed down to future generations.
