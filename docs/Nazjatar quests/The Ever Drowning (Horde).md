==Description==
[[Queen Azshara]] has her eye on us now. We must proceed with caution.

Speak with me when you are ready to proceed.

==Progress==

==Completion==
The flood has stopped for now. That is good because my power is nearly drained.

==Notes==
;Speak with Thalyssra to begin

This avenue holds so many memories, all drowned in the aftermath of Queen Azshara's ambition.

Watch your step, the Queen will be intending to test us, If I read matters correctly.

{{Gossip|Ready when you are.}}

[[Fleeing Civilian]]s run towards you. Follow Thalyssra. When the flood tides appears, go to First Arcanist's protective bubble to survive.
