==Objectives==
Speak to [[Blademaster Okani]] to learn more about the [[naga]] within [[Nazjatar]].

==Description==
There's no telling what awaits us within this land. We cannot press forward without first knowing exactly what we're up against.

Our [[Waveblade Ankoan|new allies]] have long been embattled with the naga. They would know best how to navigate these waters.

Speak with Blademaster Okani and see if they can provide some insight into how our enemies operate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
You wish to know more about the naga of Nazjatar?

I am afraid these waters are as new to me as they are to you, but we may still be able to help each other.

==Notes==
;Accept
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Obtaining the [[Tidestone of Golganneth|Tidestone]] must be our top priority. But it would be unwise to press further into [[Azshara]]'s realm without first knowing what we're up against.}}
