==Objectives==
Complete the "Stay of Execution" [[Scenario]].
* Speak with [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]]
* [[Baine Bloodhoof]] Saved

==Description==
When I was younger, Baine Bloodhoof and I began exchanging letters. Through our unlikely friendship, I learned that there was nobility in the [[Horde]].

He proved that by defying [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] when she planned to strip the free will from [[Derek Proudmoore]]. That act of nobility will cost him his life... unless we intervene.

If there is to be peace in [[Azeroth]], our hope depends upon good people doing the right thing. People like Baine. People like you.

Please, go with Jaina. Save my friend and see him home.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (1,000 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Thank you. This hasn't been an easy time for all of us.

==Completion==
Thank you for helping us rescue Baine.

It was the right thing to do.

==Notes==
Speak with Jaina:

:Baine Bloodhoof doesn't have much time. Unless we act, he will be executed.

:We are about to enter the heart of Horde territory.

:Be ready for anything.

:{{gossip|I am prepared, Jaina.}}

''Warlords of Draenor'' [[Bloodmaul Slag Mines]] [[loading screen]] appears. The player appears in the '''Baine Rescue''' version of the [[Siege of Orgrimmar (instance)|Siege of Orgrimmar]]'s [[Underhold]] map.

===Stage 1 – It Begins===
*Description: Leave the platform.
*Exit the platform

[[File:Stay of Execution picnic.png|thumb|Jaina and Mathias arriving to the Underhold.]]
:''Two [[Off-Duty Mech Jockey]]s approach. Jaina freezes them.''
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|She's holding Baine in the halls deep beneath [[Orgrimmar]]. This way.}}
:{{Text|say|Off-Duty Mech Jockey|I promise you're gonna love this surprise, pookie!}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Just need a moment to get this gate open.}}
:{{Text|say|Off-Duty Mech Jockey|Aw, I always love your surprises, honey bun.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Someone's on the other side.}}
:{{Text|say|Off-Duty Mech Jockey|What the-- Who are these clowns?}}
:{{Text|say|Off-Duty Mech Jockey|The [[Alliance]]! Awwww... this ain't gonna be good!}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Damn. They'll sound the alarm when they thaw.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Baine might not have that long. Come on!}}

===Stage 2 – Down and out in Orgrimmar===
*Description: Cross the catwalk and head down the steps.
*Reach the lower level

:{{Text|say|Azerite Researcher|Hey! They don't belong here! Keep 'em away from our [[:Azerite]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It seems they're developing Azerite weapons down here.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Looks like we're about to get a bit of firsthand experience with them, too.}}

===Stage 3 – Mecha-Gone===
*Description: Destroy mechs in the Azerite research facility then leave.
*Destroy mechs (4)
*Reach the exit

Below are more goblins (including [[Over-Worked Mechanic]]s) and [[Experimental Mech]]s.

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|This is a rare opportunity to deplete the Horde's arsenal. We should make the most of it.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Let's destroy their mechs, but we can't lose sight of our mission.}}

;Second mech killed
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|One day the [[goblin]]s might outpace [[Gnome|gnomish]] innovation. But not today.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They should use their minds to save the world instead of devising ways to tear it apart.}}

Third mech killed 
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We need to keep moving, Shaw.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Only a few targets left. They can't use them against us if we turn them into scrap.}}

===Stage 4 – Hang a Right===
*Description: Head for the gate.
*Reach the gate

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|This way!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Underhold Elite Guard]]|You'll regret this incursion!}}

===Stage 5 – Exit, Pursued by a Mech===
*Description: Protect Shaw while he opens the gate out.
*Protect Shaw

:''Shaw heads to the gate and picks it up.''
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Can you get the gate open?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|I'll need time. <Name>, you and Lady Jaina keep those Horde thugs at bay.}}

:''More Underhold Elite Guards attack.''
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Stand fast! More are coming!}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|This is a tricky one. The Horde's locksmiths must be learning from the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|If you're having trouble with the lock, I could try a spell.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|I [[The Treasury Heist|snuck a raiding party]] into [[Rastakhan]]'s [[Halls of Opulence|treasury]]. Getting through this gate isn't even a challenge.}}

:''After another wave of the guards, [[Unit One-Thirty Three-Seven]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Unit One-Thirty Three-Seven|Well, well, well. If it ain't Sneaky [[Spy]]-Guy and Sea [[Captain (rank)|Captain]] Lady [[Lord Admiral|Lord]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Unit One-Thirty Three-Seven|Killin' you guys is gonna earn me a HUGE raise!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Walk away, goblin! We're here for Bloodhoof.}}
:{{Text|say|Unit One-Thirty Three-Seven|[[Daughter of the Sea|Beware, beware this, toots!]]}}

===Stage 6 – Unlikely Alliance===
*Description: Continue deeper into the underhold.
*Enter the next room

A scene plays:

:''[[Thrall]] and [[Varok Saurfang]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Thrall...}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Jaina...?}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|The Alliance? Here?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|[[Anduin Wrynn|Our king]] sent us to rescue his friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|We too have come to save Baine.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|His odds will improve if we work together.}}
:''Varok nods.''
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Hmm... Agreed.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Time is short. Let's move.}}

===Stage 7 – Truce and Consequences===
*Description: Work with the Horde to find Baine.
*Speak with Jaina
*Reach the end of the corridor

;Thrall's gossip
We must keep moving. Baine's time grows short.

;Speaking with Jaina
The longer we are here, the greater the risk. We must keep going.

{{Gossip|I suppose we can work with the Horde, but I will be watching for their treachery.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Keep a close eye on them, <name>.}}

;Entering the tunnel
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|I did not expect the Alliance to be here.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Not the first time we've had to move against a [[Garrosh Hellscream|corrupt warchief]].}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|Or a sovereign king. Slain in [[Zuldazar|his own home]].}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|A home that still stands. Can you say the same for [[Teldrassil]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Enough! We aren't here to fight each other.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Stay focused. Baine's life is all that matters right now.}}

[[Dark Ranger (Stay of Execution)|Dark Rangers]] and Underhold Elite Guards are in the tunnel.

;Random Dark Ranger quotes
*{{Text|say|Dark Ranger|For the Horde! For the warchief!}}
*{{Text|say|Dark Ranger|Kill the Alliance!}}
*{{Text|say|Dark Ranger|For the Horde! For the warchief!}}

After the mobs are cleared, Shaw opens the next gate.

===Stage 8 – Strike Them Down!===
*Description: Defeat Rowa Bloodstrike.
*Defeat Rowa Bloodstrike

Rowa is accompanied by her two wolves, [[Mukuta]] and [[Gunaz]], [[Trained Wolf|while others]] are chained in the hall as well.

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Looks like Baine is being held just ahead.}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|It seems we must get past her first.}}
:{{Text|say|Rowa Bloodstrike|I wondered if anyone would come to save the traitor's life.}}
:{{Text|say|Rowa Bloodstrike|I am disappointed to see you here, Saurfang. Thrall. But I am not surprised.}}
:{{Text|say|Rowa Bloodstrike|Tonight, my wolves will feast on the flesh of traitors and Alliance scum!}}

;Gunaz dies
:{{Text|say|Rowa Bloodstrike|That dog had more honor than you do, Saurfang!}}

;Mukuta dies
:{{Text|say|Rowa Bloodstrike|Mukuta, no! You monsters!}}

;Orders for Trained Wolves

The party runs to Baine. As soon as they are near, the stage is completed and a scene plays.

===Stage 10 – It's a Trap!===
*Description: Defend Baine Bloodhoof, destroy the inhibitor crystals.
*Defeat Sylvanas's forces (4)
*Destroy Inhibitor Crystals (4)

A scene plays:

[[File:Stay of Execution - Hathorel and dark rangers.jpg|thumb|Enter Hathorel.]]
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Baine!}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Th--Thrall? Jaina?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|These chains are warded against [[magic]]. I'll need time to pick the lock.}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|This feels wrong. Sylvanas must have known we were coming.}}
:''[[Magister Hathorel]] accompanied by [[Dark Ranger Thandel]] and [[Dark Ranger Zanra]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Magister Hathorel|Indeed she did, traitor. You and Lady Proudmoore.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|I have no quarrel with you.}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Hathorel|Have you forgotten the [[purge of Dalaran]], murderer?  Today, the [[Sunreavers]] will be avenged.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Then your vendetta is with me, and me alone!}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Hathorel|No! You will watch your friends die--just as I did!}}
:''The scene ends.''

:{{Text|say|Magister Hathorel|Rangers! Kill them all! FOR THE SUNREAVERS!}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|We will need an escape route once Baine is free.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I can get us out, but not while these crystals are blocking my teleportation spells.}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|Then we must destroy them. Go, <name>!}}

;Summoning [[Underhold Grunt]]s
:{{Text|say|Magister Hathorel|Guards!}}

[[File:Stay of Execution - Shaw working on the shackles.png|thumb|Shaw working on the shackles]]
Kill the two dark rangers and Underhold Grunts. After the dark rangers are defeated, [[Lyani Shadestalker]] appears.

:{{Text|say|Magister Hathorel|Damn!}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Hathorel|Lyani! Get in here and eliminate them!}}

;After Lyani is defeated
[[File:Stay of Execution - Mathias Shaw.png|thumb|Shaw jumps on a pole and works on the locks.]]
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I'll disrupt the shields protecting those mages. You destroy the focus crystals!}}

After Lyani is dead, follow Jaina Proudmoore who uses Glacial Ray to destroy the shields around [[Elite Battlemage]]s. Kill them and interact with [[Inhibitor Crystal]]s to continue. The magister is casting Firestorm, so avoid the fire.

First down
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Over here! I'll bring down the shield from this one next!}}

Second down
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I can feel their spell weakening. We need to take down all four crystals!}}

With crystals down, Hathorel attacks. Defeat him.

:{{Text|yell|Magister Hathorel|None of you will escape these halls!}}

When Magister Hathorel casts Annihilation, use the extra button Ice Block.

===Final Stage – Destination: Anywhere But Here===
*Description: Take the portal out

When Hathorel is defeated, he summons an Ice Block for himself. A cutscene plays. At this point, the quest objective is complete.

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|I've got him free!}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Stay close. I'll get us out.}}
:''Jaina teleports the group out of the Underhold.''

{{#ev:youtube|LEV0jmGFRPk|Crossroads}}

:''The group materializes in [[Mulgore]], overlooking [[Thunder Bluff]]. Jaina walks to forward. Thrall looks at her, then at his friends. Varok gestures towards her. Thrall walks to Jaina.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Thank you.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Baine would've died}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|without your aid.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|I couldn't let that happen.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Nor could I.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|I refuse to fail him}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|like I... failed [[Cairne Bloodhoof|his father]].}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|I wish I could change it all.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Cairne...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Garrosh...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|[[Theramore]]...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Sometimes}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|it feels like I did}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|everything wrong.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|We all have blood on our hands.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|And now...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Sylvanas will come.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Thunderbluff will burn}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|just like Teldrassil.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Once before}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|you and I [[Battle of Mount Hyjal|stood side by side]]}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|on the slopes of [[Mount Hyjal]].}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|That world tree did not fall.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Because the Horde and the Alliance}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|worked together.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Horde...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Alliance...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|We've come to this crossroad}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|again and again, Jaina.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|It always falls apart.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|What's different this time?}}
:''Thrall looks at Jaina, she places her hand on his arm.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|We are.}}
:''Saurfang, Baine, and Shaw approach them.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|I should go.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Anduin will want to know}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|that Baine is safe.}}
:''Baine places his hand on his chest in gratitude and slightly bows his head.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Tell your king}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|he is not alone.}}
:''Jaina nods and teleports.''

;On completion
:{{Text|say|[[Genn Greymane]]|Good to have you back, Jaina. Why did King Anduin summon you?}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Sylvanas ordered the execution of Baine Bloodhoof. Anduin sent us into Orgrimmar to rescue him.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|You risked your lives to save a leader of the Horde?!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|After what he did for Derek, I felt I owed him a debt. We received some unexpected help from Saurfang... and Thrall.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Shandris Feathermoon]]|You were fortunate that you were not betrayed. Presenting your heads might have regained their warchief's favor.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We had a common enemy. Sylvanas wanted us at each other's throats. Perhaps that's what [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] wants, too.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Hold on... Are you suggesting we lay down our arms and fight beside them? After all they've done?!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|No. Merely that we direct our efforts against Azshara instead of the Horde. That could buy time for Saurfang's rebellion to take root.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|There must be vengeance for Teldrassil. But if Azshara is not stopped, she will unleash her master upon the world.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Very well. We will focus on defeating the [[naga]] queen. But if the Horde turns against us, they will answer for it.}}
