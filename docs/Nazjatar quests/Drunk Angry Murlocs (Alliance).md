==Objectives==
Collect 12 Ocean "Infused" Lagers.
* [[Ocean "Infused" Lager]] (12)

==Description==
Those no-good [[Bloodfin tribe|Bloodfins]] ran off with all of the [[beer]]!

I've been experimenting with brews that only use ingredients native to [[Nazjatar]], but it's still a work in progress. For now, I must rely on whatever I can scrounge up from the shipwreck.

My supply of beer was already limited, but now it's all gone thanks to those thieving Bloodfin [[murloc]]s! We're going to have some very angry customers here if we don't get it back.

Please recover the stolen lager from [[Bloodfin Village]] before it's too late!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
Those no-good Bloodfins ran off with all of the beer!

==Completion==
Good work, <name>! You've recovered pretty much all of the stolen beer. Those Bloodfins are more trouble than they're worth!
