==Objectives==
Show the Leathery Venom Gland to [[Artisan Itanu]] in [[Mezzamere]] in [[Nazjatar]].
* [[Leathery Venom Gland (item)]]

==Description==
<You pry a leathery gland from the [[snapdragon]] corpse. Drops of venom spill from an opening on one end and sizzle as they touch the ground, leaving small holes behind.

This toxin appears to be very potent. It would be best to bring it back to Mezzamere.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Waveblade Ankoan]]

==Completion==
Friend, let me take that from you, it is best not to handle the venom for too long.

The [[naga]] tame the snapdragon with ease, but we have more difficulty. They seem to have a natural affinity for them. I envy them somewhat, the creatures are both vicious and loyal.

The venom they spit is deadly. I have only known one to truly master it, a naga [[Commander (rank)|commander]]. We believe she feeds on the substance to give herself immunity. I do not know how this is possible, she must be a terror in combat.
