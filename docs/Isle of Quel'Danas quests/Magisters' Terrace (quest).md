==Objectives==
[[Captain Theris Dawnhearth]] wants you to find [[Exarch Larethor]] inside the [[Magisters' Terrace (Burning Crusade)|Magisters' Terrace]].

==Description==
We recently sent in an expeditionary force to the Magisters' Terrace to stop the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] forces there.

However, we haven't heard from them since, and I fear the worst.

Will you go there and try to find Exarch Larethor? He's in charge of the expedition.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||44}}
* 1,080 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Dawnhearth thought we were dead? Hah!

I haven't sent a report because we haven't made any progress past this point.

Perhaps you can help us change that?

==Progression==
# [[Crisis at the Sunwell]] / [[Duty Calls]]
