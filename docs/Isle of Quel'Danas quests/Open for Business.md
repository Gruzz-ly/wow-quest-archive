==Objectives==
[[Mar'nah]] at the [[Sun's Reach Harbor]] wants you to gather 5 Bloodberries from the bushes found on [[Isle of Quel'Danas|Quel'Danas]].
*[[Bloodberry]] (5)

==Description==
Welcome, <name>.

There are a number of ways I can assist you in your efforts here.

For example, I've recently discovered a recipe for a unique elixir.

The bloodberry grows wild in many regions of [[Azeroth]] and has long been considered nothing more than a nuisance. I've learned though, that when exposed to the [[Sunwell]]'s power this plant takes on special properties that can be distilled and imbibed to magnify one's abilities.

Bring me a sample from the nearby bushes and I'll show you what I mean.

==Rewards==
You will receive [[Bloodberry Elixir]] and {{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
Have you gathered those berries yet?

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>. I hope this will aid you in your efforts here.
