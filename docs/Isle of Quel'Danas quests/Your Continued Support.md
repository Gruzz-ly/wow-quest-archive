'''Your Continued Support''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have funded the construction of the Monument to the Fallen, this quest replaces [[A Charitable Donation]]. Players who are {{reputation|exalted}} with the Offensive will ''not'' see this quest.

==Objectives==
[[Anchorite Ayuri]] at [[Sun's Reach]] in [[Isle of Quel'Danas|Sunwell Isle]] wants you to donate 10 gold.
* Required Money: {{cost|10}}

==Description==
We've built a memorial to honor those slain in battle. It's but a small consolation to the families that lost their loved ones.

I am taking up a collection to aid the orphans and spouses of our war heroes. If you can spare a small donation it would go a long way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Shattered Sun Offensive]]

==Progress==
Do you wish to make a donation?

==Completion==
You are a virtuous soul, <name>. It is easy to forget the fallen amongst the turmoil of war and the euphoria of victory. The friends and families of the dead thank you.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.4.0|note=Added.}}
