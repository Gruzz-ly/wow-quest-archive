==Objectives==
Dathris Sunstriker on [[Scryer's Tier]] in [[Shattrath City]] has insisted that you travel to [[Azeroth]] at once and report to [[Exarch Larethor|Larethor]]{{sic}} at the [[Sunwell]].

==Description==
Hear me, <race>.

Duty requires that you return to Azeroth. Every able person is to report to the [[Sunwell Plateau]] immediately.

I'm afraid I have no more information to share, except this:

You'll be joining forces with the [[Aldor]] for this mission. Speak with a [[draenei]] by the name of Larethor when you arrive.

Apparently, the situation calls for us to set our differences aside and join forces.

Prepare yourself, friend. This sounds serious.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||44}}

==Completion==
Welcome to the [[Sunwell Plateau]]!

Well, now, let's get a few things straight. There's some serious business going on behind those walls and it's in the interest of both our people to address it. And since neither of us have the forces to go it alone, we're going to work TOGETHER. Got that?

Now, let's get started, shall we?
