'''Don't Stop Now....''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have built the Anvil and Forge at the [[Sun's Reach Armory]], this quest replaces [[Making Ready]].

==Objectives==
Smith Hauthaa in Sun's Reach Armory wants you to kill Darkspine Myrmidon to the east and use their keys to steal three pieces of the ore from their chests.
*[[Darkspine Iron Ore]] (3)

==Description==
Now that we have an anvil, I can really get to work.

No matter how many supplies we receive, I'll always be able to put the Darkspine Iron Ore to good use. We'll need a constant supply of weapons and armor if we're to be successful here.

There are a group of naga on the coast to the east of here. They're collecting ore and placing it in chests for shipment to the Legion. Relieving them of their ore will help our efforts in more ways than one....

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
Have you gathered the ore I asked for?

==Completion==
Excellent! This will help me keep our soldiers in weapons and armor.

Your help is truly making a difference!
