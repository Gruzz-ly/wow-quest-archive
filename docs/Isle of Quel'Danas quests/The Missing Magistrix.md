==Objectives==
Use the Captured Legion Scroll near the portal at [[Dawning Square]].  Once you've gone through the portal, find [[Magistrix Seyla]].
* [[Captured Legion Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
We sent one of our operatives to investigate the fel portal in the middle of Dawning Square, south of here.  She never returned.

Take this scroll we found on one of the enemy corpses. We believe it will grant you access through the portal. Once through, find Magistrix Seyla and aid her in any way you can.

==Progress==
Keep quiet, <class>. The [[Burning Legion|Legion's]] forces watch the south of the gate.

==Completion==
It's very sweet of [[Captain Theris Dawnhearth|Theris]] to worry about my hide, but we've got bigger problems here. Much bigger.

==Notes==
[[File:Portal at Dawning Square.jpg|thumb|Use the Scroll near this Portal]]
WARNING: Using the Captured Legion Scroll will teleport you to the [[Throne of Kil'jaeden]]! Magistrix Seyla does not offer a return-teleport to any other location, so once you use the portal you have to find another way to leave (ride, fly, portal, etc.).
There is no repeatable quest to use the portal to get from the Isle to the Throne; you'll need to find another way to get there if you want to repeat the dailies.
