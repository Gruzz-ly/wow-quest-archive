==Objectives==
[[Captain Valindria]] wants you to free 10 Greengill Slaves. Return to her onboard the ''[[Silvermoon's Pride]]'' at [[Sun's Reach Harbor]] once you have done so.
*[[Greengill Slave]] freed (10)

==Description==
The [[naga]] have taken the [[Greengill Coast]] to the southeast. Their females, the [[Darkspine Siren|Darkspine sirens]], are using magic to enslave the indigenous [[murloc]]s.

It's my responsibility to see to it that whatever the naga are up to over there is disrupted. That's where you come in.

<class>, I want you to get the controlling orbs from the female naga and throw them near the Greengill slaves, breaking the orb and setting the murlocs free.

My guess is that the murlocs will be incensed and turn on their masters.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{Cost|4|40}}.

==Progress==
My scouts tell me that there hasn't yet been enough disruption of the naga today.

==Completion==
That's enough for today. Slow and steady is the key here. Too much disruption and they'd turn their attention directly upon us; something that we don't want.

Come back again tomorrow and we'll work on it some more.

==Notes==
Kill [[Darkspine Siren]]s to loot an [[Orb of Murloc Control]]. The Orb's on-use effect acts like a targeted [[AoE]] spell, so try to target as many murlocs that will fit in the circle to cut down on attempts.
