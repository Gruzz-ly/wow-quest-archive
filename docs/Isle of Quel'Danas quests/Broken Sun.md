==Objectives==
Meet [[Liadrin]] at the entrance to the [[Sunwell]].
*Escape on the [[Empowered Dragonhawk|Dragonhawk]]
*Arrive at the Sunwell
*Meet Liadrin at the entrance to the Sunwell.

==Description==
We need to fall back! This is not a battle that we can win. Not like this.

But there is still hope! The Sunwell. It brought the [[Vanguard of the Light]] here to defend it. It brought you, <name>. Fall back to the Sunwell chamber and defend it for as long as we can.

I have faith the [[Light]] did not intend for us to lose this day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|30|98}}
*11,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank the Light! Everyone from the Vanguard that survived is in the Sunwell chamber. Now that you are here we can begin.
