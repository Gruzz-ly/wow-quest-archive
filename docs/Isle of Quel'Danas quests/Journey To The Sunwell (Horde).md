This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Halduron Brightwing]] at the entrance to the [[Sunwell Plateau]] on the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]].
*[[Tempered Quel'Delar]] (Provided)

==Description==
Take [[Quel'Delar]] to the [[Sunwell]] as quickly as possible, <name>. Trust in [[Uther Lightbringer|Uther]]'s words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the [[Lich King]]'s influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the Sunwell itself, where you can cleanse the sword.

The guardians will try to stop you from entering the Sunwell Plateau, but make yourself known to Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||74}}
*2200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What brings you here?

==Completion==
I hope you understand that I can't just admit you to the Sunwell, <name>. This is the most sacred place known to the sin'dorei and we have only recently regained control over it.

You would raise the hopes of our people with tales of Quel'Delar? Without proof of the truth of your claims, I see no reason to take you at your word.
