'''Crush the Dawnblade''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have recovered the [[Sun's Reach Harbor]], this quest replaces [[Taking the Harbor]].

==Objectives==
[[Magister Ilastar]] at [[Sun's Reach Armory]] wants you to slay 6 Dawnblade Summoners, 6 Dawnblade Blood Knights and 3 Dawnblade Marksmen.
*[[Dawnblade Summoner]] slain (6)
*[[Dawnblade Blood Knight]] slain (6)
*[[Dawnblade Marksman]] slain (3)

==Description==
We've driven the Dawnblade army out of the [[Sun's Reach Harbor]]. [[Sun's Reach]] is ours in its entirety. Yet somehow... I'm not entirely satisfied.

I want you to go to [[Dawnstar Village]], west of here, and slay any surviving Dawnblade combatants. They sealed their fate when they followed [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael]] to this place.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
Have you slain the dawnblade scum, <name>?

==Completion==
What thoughts go through Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider's head when he hears of his armies' defeats?

Does he feel despair? Helplessness? Fear?

I sure hope so.
