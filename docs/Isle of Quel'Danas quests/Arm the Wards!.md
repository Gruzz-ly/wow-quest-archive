'''Arm the Wards!''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have recovered the [[Sun's Reach Sanctum]], this quest replaces [[The Sanctum Wards]].

==Objectives==
[[Captain Theris Dawnhearth]] at the [[Shattered Sun Staging Area]] wants you to obtain 4 [[Mana Remnants]] from [[Wretched Fiend|Wretched Fiends]] and [[Wretched Devourer|Wretched Devourers]] and use them to energize one of the [[Crystal Ward (NPC)|Crystal Wards]] surrounding the [[Sun's Reach Sanctum]] to the north.

==Description==
We've succeeded in reactivating the crystal wards around the sanctum, but why stop there?  We'll build defenses around the other structures, but the [[Wretched]] are stubborn and continue to steal power from the crystal wards.

Hunt them down and get the mana remnants they carry.  Use the remnants to energize the sanctum wards; the safety of our operation depends on it.

==Notes==
Once you have collected four [[Mana Remnants]], go to the Sun Reach's Sanctum and use them on the floating red crystals just outside of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|10}} at lvl 70.

==Progress==
Have you reactivated a crystal ward, <name>?

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. The wards are slowly regaining their power. [[Sun's Reach]] will be ours in no time!
