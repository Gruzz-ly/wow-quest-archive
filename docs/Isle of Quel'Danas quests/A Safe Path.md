==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gloomstress.jpg|Gloomstress|A writhing mass of slime, growing larger with each life it devours. It does not feed to survive, it feeds to become.}}
Eliminate Gloomstress.
*[[Gloomstress]] slain

==Description==
We must rescue the civilians and get them to the ships, yet the path to the docks is barred by a vile, hungering creature.

If we are to save my people, then we need to clear an evacuation path. We cannot leave them to fend for themselves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|30|98}}
*11,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Does the engulfing void still bar the way?

==Completion==
Thank you, <Name>. These rescue missions are rarely as straightforward as they seem. There is always one more threat that appears that you didn't account for.
