This quest is available even after players have funded the construction of the [[Monument to the Fallen]].

==Description==
You've done so much for us, <name>. We greatly appreciate your assistance.

You might have noticed Anchorite Ayuri's efforts outside. She has a big heart and is very convincing, but the donations do not quite add up to what she had expected.

If you were to make a large contribution to her cause, I will make sure that word of your deeds in this war spreads far and wide. What do you say?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Shattered Sun Offensive]]
*The title "of the Shattered Sun"

==Progress==
Are you ready to make the contribution?

==Completion==
You truly are a generous person and a worthy ally. From now on you shall be known as <name> of the Shattered Sun and all who fought here will know of your deeds!
