'''The Battle Must Go On''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have recovered the [[Sun's Reach Armory]], this quest replaces [[The Battle for the Sun's Reach Armory]].
This quest's name appears to be a reference to the song "Show Must Go On", by the group Queen.

==Objectives==
[[Harbinger Inuuro]] wants you to slay 6 [[Burning Legion]] [[Demon]]s and the [[Emissary of Hate]] in [[Dawning Square]]. Use the Shattered Sun Banner to impale the Emissary of Hate's corpse.
*Burning Legion Demon slain (6)
* Emissary of Hate Implaled
* [[Shattered Sun Banner]] (provided)

==Description==
We must continue to defeat and demoralize the armies of the Legion.

The emissaries of hate are Legion shocktroopers sent to reinforce tactical Legion positions.  The enemy rallies upon their arrival for they fear them more than they fear us.

Today we will change that.  Take this banner and slay the demons at Dawning Square.  When the emissary is sent, slay and impale him.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
Have you succeeded, <name>?

==Completion==
Your dedication is exemplary, <name>. We will show the forces of the Burning Legion what we're capable of.

==Patch changes==
