This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Halduron Brightwing]] at the entrance to the [[Sunwell Plateau]] on the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]].
* [[Tempered Quel'Delar]] (provided)

==Description==
Take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell as quickly as possible, <name>. Trust in Uther's words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the [[Lich King]]'s influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the [[Sunwell]] itself, where you can cleanse the sword.

The guardians of the Sunwell will not simply allow you to walk in, so you must find Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||74}}

==Progress==
What brings you here?

==Completion==
Admit you to the Sunwell? That's impossible! The Sunwell is the most sacred and important site of our people. We have only recently reclaimed it with the help of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]]. It is not a place for tourists or travelers.

==Notes==
The quickest way there is to take a teleport to [[Shattrath City]], then run across the [[Terrace of Light]] to [[Exarch Nasuun]] and the Shattrath Portal to the Isle of Quel'Danas.

Once there, run down the path to the instance line, where [[Halduron Brightwing]] awaits.

The isle is in a new phase, as there are no demons or wretched attacking the area. Instead are a number of [[Warden of the Sunwell|Wardens of the Sunwell]] speaking curtly.
