[[File:The Setting Sun Lantern location.jpg|thumb|The lantern location, resembling the player's model.]]

==Objectives==
Witness the fall of [[Anasterian]].
* Light shed on Anasterian's Fall
* [[Blightgut]] slain

==Description==
Remember the [[Sunwell]].

We ride into battle with those words for a reason. We lost so much that day...

I lost so much that day.

Shine the lantern on the southern side of the island, where the [[Dead Scar]] meets the [[Frozen Sea|sea]]. There you will see how the fall of the Sunwell began. And with it, the last act of the High Elves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done, champion?

==Completion==
One final task remains.
