'''Enter, the Deceiver...''' is the introduction quest to the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] and the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]].

==Objectives==
Report to [[Archmage Ne'thul]] on the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]], north of [[Quel'Thalas]].

Flight masters in Ironforge and Silvermoon City will get you to your destination.

==Description==
Despite our best plans, [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas']] sinister plans have been carried out. The [[Sunwell]] has been re-ignited in preparation for the [[Kil'jaeden|Deceiver's]] arrival.

The object that stands before me and below [[A'dal]] is a representation of the status of the Sunwell's current defenses. Mighty barriers have been raised, stymieing our attacks against the inner chambers. If ever there was a time our world needed assistance, it would be now.

Report to Archmage Ne'thul at the Isle of Quel'Danas, north of Quel'Thalas.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,050 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Shattered Sun Offensive]]

==Completion==
Kil'jaeden bears down upon this world with the full force of the [[Burning Legion]]. Should the summoning complete, our world will once more be flung into the throes of chaos.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.4.0|note=Added.}}
