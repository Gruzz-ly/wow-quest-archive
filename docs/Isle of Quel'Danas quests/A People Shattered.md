==Objectives==
Light the final flame.
* [[Lamp (Quel'Danas)|Light the Final Flame]]

==Description==
While the monument here was intended to honor the fallen members of the [[Shattered Sun]], it quickly took on a second meaning for the [[sin'dorei]].

It was not far from here that we lost one of our greatest heroes: [[Anasterian Sunstrider]], the last king of [[Quel'Thalas]]. He led our final effort against the [[Scourge]] and personally crossed blades with [[Arthas]] himself. As we remember the sacrifices it took to reclaim this land, we also remember the sacrifices made in its defense.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Never forget the lives that were lost here. Both to the Scourge, and to their own misguided kin.

==Notes==
;Using the [[Lamp (Quel'Danas)|lamp]]
:''The blood elf [[adventurer]] lights the final flame, channeling a spell that causes small [[phoenixes]] to fly from them towards the lamp. [[Anasterian Sunstrider]] can be seen leading the last defenders, among which [[Lady Liadrin|High Priestess Liadrin]], [[Vandellor|High Priest Vandellor]] and [[Belo'vir Salonar|Grand Magister Belo'vir]].
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|For thousands of years, the [[Sunwell]] meant everything to our people. Arthas dealt us a grievous wound when he defiled it.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|My faith was shattered when [[Silvermoon]] fell. I lost sight of who I was. But by the grace of the [[Light]], I found redemption before it was too late.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Let this [[Monument to the Fallen|monument]] serve as a reminder of what it means to be sin'dorei. That our every deed may honor the sacrifices of those who came before us.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|No matter how much pain we endure, we will not lose hope. In the face of darkness, look always to the Eternal Sun.}}
