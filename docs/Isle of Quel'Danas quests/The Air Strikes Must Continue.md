'''The Air Strikes Must Continue''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have recovered the [[Sun's Reach Armory]], this quest replaces [[Distraction at the Dead Scar]].

==Objectives==
[[Battlemage Arynna]] wants you to speak to [[Ayren Cloudbreaker]] when you're ready to fly over the [[Dead Scar]].  Once there, use the Arcane Charges to kill 2 Pit Overlords, 3 Eredar Sorcerers and 12 Wrath Enforcers.
* [[Pit Overlord]] slain (2)
* [[Eredar Sorcerer]] slain (3)
* [[Wrath Enforcer]] slain (12)
* [[Arcane Charges (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
We've taken the armory from the enemy thanks to our aerial attacks against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s forces in the Dead Scar.

As a matter of fact, it's gone so well that we're going to continue our air strikes against them.  Take these arcane charges and use them against their forces.

Talk to Ayren Cloudbreaker at the [[Shattered Sun Staging Area]] when you're ready for flight.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|40}}

==Progress==
Have you accomplished your mission, <name>?

==Completion==
Any demons we kill today are demons that we do not have to fight tomorrow. Keep it up.
