==Objectives==
[[Adyen the Lightwarden]] on the [[Aldor Rise]] in [[Shattrath City]] has requested that you travel to [[Sunwell Plateau]] and speak with [[Exarch Larethor|Larethor]]{{sic}}.

==Description==
By the [[naaru]], I thank you, <race>, for your efforts.

Our work is far from finished, however, and I must request that you undertake a critical mission - one as important as any I've issued.

Our forces are spread thinly. To compound the strain, we've had to dispatch a contingent to [[Azeroth]] to investigate developments at the Sunwell Plateau.

You are needed there, <name>. Report to Larethor. Tell him that I wish we could spare more men.

==Completion==
Another soldier from Shattrath? A welcome sight!

Wish there were more of you, but we'll make due with what we have. Whatever's going on out here won't wait for us to make ready.

Have a look around, <class>. There's much that needs doing. Pitch in and do your share.

Oh, yeah, and don't go tauntin' the cryers - err, Scryers. Looks like we're in this thing together....
