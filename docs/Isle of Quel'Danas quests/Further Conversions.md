'''Further Conversions''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have recovered the [[Sun's Reach Sanctum]], this quest replaces [[Erratic Behavior]].

==Objectives==
[[Vindicator Xayann]] at the [[Shattered Sun Staging Area]] wants you to place the Attuned Crystal Cores inside 5 defeated [[Erratic Sentry|Arcane Sentries]] to turn them into friendly units.
*Converted Sentry Deployed (5)
*[[Attuned Crystal Cores]] (provided)

==Description==
My plan to replace the damaged crystals on the erratic sentries has been a success. We've managed to take the [[Sun's Reach Sanctum]] with their help.

I've crafted new crystals that will bring more of them under our control; place them inside the hulls of defeated sentries. We'll deploy them to other locations once they've been converted.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|40}}

==Progress==
Have you converted the sentries, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent. The converted sentries will help to secure our perimeter.

==Notes==
In the quest text, [[Erratic Sentry|Erratic Sentries]] are referred to as "Arcane Sentries", due to the fact that they are [[Arcane Guardian]]s. The sentries are neutral unless attacked and patrol the same areas as the Wretched. It is safer to first kill any Wretched (especially if you are working on [[The Sanctum Wards]]† or [[Arm the Wards!]], then attack the sentries. Using the crystal on a sentry despawns its corpse and spawns a new (friendly) mob, so be sure to loot the sentry before you use the crystal. The sentries patrol the northwest part of the Isle, so if the area near the harbor has too may players, move farther west.
