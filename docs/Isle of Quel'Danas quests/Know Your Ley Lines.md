'''Know Your Ley Lines''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have activated the Sunwell Portal in [[Shattrath City]], this quest is made available at the [[Sun's Reach Sanctum]].

==Objectives==
[[Astromancer Darnarian]] in the [[Sun's Reach Sanctum]] wants you to use the Astromancer's Crystal at the [[Bloodcrystal]], the [[Dawning Square]] portal, and the [[naga]] shrine at [[Greengill Coast]].
* Portal Reading Taken
* Shrine Reading Taken
* Bloodcrystal Reading Taken
*[[Astromancer's Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Freeloaders!

You all want instant gratification - never giving thought to the effort required to create even the simplest of portals.

Perhaps a little education will instill a bit of gratitude for my ceaseless efforts.

Take this crystal. Attune it to the Bloodcrystal to the west, at the Dawning Square portal just south of here, and at the naga shrine at Greengill Coast to the southeast.

Perhaps then you'll appreciate your precious translocations....

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Darnarian's Scroll of Teleportation]] and {{cost|4|40}} 

==Progress==
Have you attuned the crystal yet, <class>?

==Completion==
Yes, yes. Let's have a look now, shall we?

Things seem to be in order. Very well. Here is your translocator.

If any of the readings are faulty, there's no telling where you'll end up, and mind you, you'll only have yourself to blame.

==Notes==
*The portal can be found at the southeast corner of [[Dawning Square]], at {{co|48.5|44.4|Isle of Quel'Danas}}. It is efficient to combine doing this quest with [[The Battle for the Sun's Reach Armory]] or [[The Battle Must Go On]], as the demons in this area count for those quests.
*The naga shrine can be found just off the southern [[Greengill Coast]], east of the [[Dead Scar]], at {{co|61.2|62.6|Isle of Quel'Danas}}. It is efficient to combine doing this quest with [[Making Ready]] or [[Don't Stop Now....]], as the naga in this area drop the keys to open the quest chests.
*The [[Bloodcrystal]] can be found inside the largest, northernmost building of [[Dawnstar Village]], at {{co|42.1|35.7|Isle of Quel'Danas}}. It is efficient to combine doing this quest with [[Taking the Harbor]] or [[Crush the Dawnblade]], as blood elves in this area count toward that quest.
