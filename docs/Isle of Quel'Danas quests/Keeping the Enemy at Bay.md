'''Keeping the Enemy at Bay''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have recovered the [[Sun's Reach Harbor]], this quest replaces [[Intercept the Reinforcements]].

==Objectives==
[[Vindicator Kaalan]] at the [[Sun's Reach Armory]] wants you to speak to [[Ayren Cloudbreaker]] and fly over the Dawnblade reinforcement fleet. Use the Flaming Oil to set the ship sails on fire as you fly and once you land, slay 6 Dawnblade Reservists.
* ''[[The Sin'loren|Sin'loren]]'' sails burned
* ''[[The Bloodoath|Bloodoath]]'' sails burned
* ''[[The Dawnchaser|Dawnchaser]]'' sails burned
* [[Dawnblade Reservist]] slain (6)
* [[Flaming Oil]] (provided)

==Description==
We've managed to capture [[Sun's Reach]] in its entirety. Unfortunately a fleet of Dawnblade reservists is on its way to take back the harbor.

Take this oil and secure a dragonhawk from Ayren Cloudbreaker. You should be able to fly within reach of the ships' sails; once you're close enough, set them on fire.

Land in one of the ships and attack the reservists. With their ship sails on fire they won't be able to mount much of a defense.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|59}}

==Progress==
Have you accomplished your task, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. It should be a long time before the harbor receives any reinforcements.

==Notes==
The dragonhawk Ayren provides will fly near all three of the ships north of the Harbor. Target the sails while flying overhead. After flying around, players will land on ''[[The Sin'loren]]'' where an [[Unrestrained Dragonhawk]] waits to fly players back to the dock after they've killed their six reservists.
