==Objectives==
[[Kadrak]] at [[Mor'shan Rampart]]s wants you to kill 5 Ashenvale Skirmishers and 5 Ashenvale Bowmen.
*[[Ashenvale Skirmisher]]s Slain (5)
*[[Ashenvale Bowman|Ashenvale Bowmen]] Slain (5)

==Description==
Lok'tar, <race>!

The campaign is finally underway! Soon, all of [[Ashenvale]] will be in the grip of the Horde.

As we expected, our offensive is forcing the enemy to test our defenses at every position.

Here at Mor'shan, their assault has been decimated! But as the vice tightens, they will have no choice but to continue to press us here.

Scout the region, <class>. Search for [[night elf]] survivors and cut them down before they can regroup for another assault! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1300}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Was your hunt successful, <race>?

==Completion==
Good work, <class>!

Your efforts will help keep the enemy on their heels while our forces sweep across the land! 

==Notes==
*In {{g|cata}}, the quest rewarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]]. It was changed to Orgrimmar at some point.
