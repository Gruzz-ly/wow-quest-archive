{{questportrait|Chief Engineer Foote.jpg|Chief Engineer Foote|He holds the schematics we need.}}
==Objectives==
Get the Ship Schematics from {{NPC||Chief Engineer Foote}} at the [[Broken Keel Tavern]] in [[Ratchet]].
* [[Ship Schematics]]

==Description==
All this new friction between the [[Alliance]] and the [[Horde]] was leading to windfall profits, until [[Rear Admiral Hartley]] sailed into MY harbor and started poking his prow into my business. He's been searching and seizing vessels flying horde colors with the goal of depriving them use of a neutral port.

I'm not about to allow some fat-fingered [[human]] to cut into my profits! Get me the schematics of his flagship. Hartley's Chief Engineer is soaking himself at the Broken Keel Tavern just up the hill...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||2|85}}
* 370 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got the goods?

==Completion==
Ah, this is it - this is it right here! So his flagship is named "The [[Bellipotent]]" eh?

Let's see what it'll take to send this nuisance to the bottom of the sea.

==Notes==
Talk to Foote in the inn to attempt to get the schematics.
