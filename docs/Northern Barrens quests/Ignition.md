==Objectives==
Get the Ignition Key from [[Supervisor Lugwizzle]].
*[[Ignition Key]]

==Description==
I don't suppose [[Sputtervalve]] sent you? I'm in a bind here. I hopped in without realizing that I need a key to unlock the shredder's movement column. One of the other shredder operators asked me if everything was okay, and I panicked! Instead of telling him that I was missing my key, I told him there was some sort of mechanical problem.

We need to get out of here on the double! Search the upper level of the [[Oil platform|derrick]], Supervisor Lugwizzle should have a key for this shredder.

Help me out here!

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*740 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]]

==Progress==
Quick, we need to get out of here before someone gets suspicious!

==Completion==
Yep, this looks like the right key. Let me just make sure I know how to work this thing...

Hmmm... rotation control... This regulates speed and stability... fine arm movement control. Just look at this! I can't believe the [[Venture Company]] could design something this much better than ours. I've got to get this back to the outpost!

==Notes==
You can find [[Wizzlecrank's Shredder]] on the north side of the [[Sludge Fen]], in the depressed area. If it is missing, someone else has started the follow-on escort quest, [[The Escape (Horde)]]. Wait a few minutes and it will respawn.

Climb the ramp on the oil derrick in the middle of the [[Sludge Fen]]. The [[Ignition Key]] drops off of [[Supervisor Lugwizzle]]. He patrols from the top of the ramp to the bottom. There are a few other goblins that patrol, as well as a rare spawn ([[Foreman Grills]]), so keep an eye open for them.

If you haven't battled many of the goblins in the Sludge Fen, they run for help when they are at 1/2 life, so plan your fights on the derrick and on the shore accordingly.
