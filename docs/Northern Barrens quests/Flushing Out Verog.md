==Objectives==
Gather 4 pieces of Centaur Intelligence from around the [[Stagnant Oasis]].
* [[Centaur Intelligence]] (4)

==Description==
[[Regthar Deathgate]] sent me here to observe the [[centaur]] activity, but the leader of this group is hard to pin down. I've discovered that his name is "[[Verog the Dervish]]," but his whereabouts are a mystery.

Can you help me do some digging? I know that "Centaur Intelligence" sounds like an oxymoron, but their camps are often littered with important communications. Search the centaur tents all around the Stagnant Oasis here and bring me back some info.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost||2|85}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Search those tents, <name>. Try to ignore the stench.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. Did you look through these? They're barely legible, more like angry graffiti than war plans. Hatred, jealousy, rage, personal conflict - it's a wonder Verog can keep these centaur from killing each other, much less form them into an army.

We can use this to our advantage.
