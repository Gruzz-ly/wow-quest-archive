==Objectives==
Blow your horn at Echeyakee's lair to summon him. Slay or subdue him.
* Conquer [[Echeyakee]]
* [[Horn of Echeyakee]] (provided)

==Description==
Whitemist, or 'Echeyakee' in the [[Taur-ahe|tauren tongue]], is the king of the savannah cats. He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth. He kills so fast his prey have no time for fear or pain.

The [[tauren]] say he is both mercy and death.

<Name>, I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee. His lair is just northwest of here, on the north side of a small mountain, among the bones of giant [[Kodo]].

Go. Blow this horn when you reach his lair. Blow the horn, and he will come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
The great cat calls to you, <name>.

==Completion==
You've beaten Echeyakee, and though his days of hunting are over... his spirit is with you. He will show you the strength found in subtlety, and the honor in mercy.

I underestimated you, <class>. The [[Horde]] is fortunate to have you in its ranks.

==Notes==
This is one of the very few quests where taming the target counts for the objective.

On completion:
:{{text|yell|Sergra Darkthorn|Lok'tar ogar! This young <race> <class> has conquered the great Echeayakee. Let <his/her> actions show the might of the new Horde!}}

==Progression==
