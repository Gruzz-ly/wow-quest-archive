==Objectives==
Retrieve the Cats Eye Emerald from one of the [[Venture Co. Overseer]]s or [[Venture Co. Enforcer|Enforcers]].
* [[Cats Eye Emerald]]

==Description==
Hey <race>, you interested in treasure? I knew that would get your attention.

Word from the river dock here is that one of the miners in the [[Venture Company]]'s [[Boulder Lode Mine|Boulder Lode mine]] just northeast of here discovered an emerald the size of your fist.

I know a few buyers who'd be interested in getting their hands on something like that, and I'd be willing to go half and half on its sale. You in?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bargain Gloves
|Irregular Belt
|Misshapen Boots
|Slightly Dented Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* 930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If only we knew which one of the miners had found the emerald, it'd be a walk in the park...

==Completion==
Look at the size of that thing! We're going to be rich! Let's see, according to the rates I've seen on gems going into [[Undermine]], I should be able to figure out your cut - fifty percent, don't worry!

Now let's see... I think this should do about right. Pleasure doing business with you, <name>.
