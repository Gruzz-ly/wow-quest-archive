==Objectives==
[[Gorka]] wants you to accompany her to [[Mor'shan Rampart]]s and report to [[Kadrak]].

Speak to her when you are ready to depart.
*Gorka accompanied to Mor'shan Ramparts

==Description==
There will be no help coming from [[Splintertree Post|Splintertree]].

The [[Night elf|elves]] have launched a major assault on our stronghold there and they have the place surrounded!

We must inform Kadrak or die trying!

[[Brutusk|Your kodo]] has been loaded up with the wood you collected. Let me know when you're ready and we'll charge the enemy lines. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mourner's Stole
|Leggings of Loss
|Burden of Sacrifice
|Griefbearer Leggings
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||13|}} 
*1250 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
What's all this about, <class>?

==Completion==
Gorka...

We must always be prepared for losses. Her honorable service to the [[Horde]] will not be forgotten.

And her sacrifice shall not be in vain!  

==Notes==
This quest would frequently bug-out and become uncompletable if multiple players tried doing it at the same time. As if to rectify this, [[patch 8.3.0]] changed this quest entirely into a single cutscene.

;Speaking with Gorka
:Hurry, <class>! There is no time to waste!

:Splintertree must not fall!

:{{Gossip|I am ready, Gorka. To Kadrak!}}

''Brutusk charges from the [[Warsong Lumber Camp]] on the western road, the adventurer and [[Gorka]] on its back. Several [[Ashenvale Bowman]] appear from the woods and begin firing at the kodo to no avail. [[Ashenvale Skirmisher]]s attempt to leap onto Brutusk, but Gorka cuts them down. Eventually, an [[Ashenvale Commander]] appears in front of Brutusk with a squad of sentinels.'' 

:{{Text|say|[[Ashenvale Commander]]|That's far enough, orc! Dismount and submit or die!}}
:{{Text|say|Gorka|Out of our way, fools!}}

''Despite a rain of arrows, Brutusk barrels through the sentinels, knocking the commander aside. Finally, the party arrives at the [[Mor'shan Rampart]], but it is revealed that Gorka did not make it, having been shot through the chest by one of the elves' arrows.''
