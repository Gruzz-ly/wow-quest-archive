==Objectives==
Kill the [[Razormane tribe|Razormane]] leader, Tortusk.
* [[Tortusk]] slain

==Description==
In the wake of the chaos down south, this "Tortusk" brute seems to have rallied all of the Razormane [[refugee]]s to his [[banner]]. Under his leadership, he's turned them into little more than [[brigand]]s. There's no negotiating with his type; Tortusk must be destroyed.

If [[Captured Razormane|our prisoner]] is to be believed, you'll find Tortusk southeast of here at a place called [[Thorn Hill]]. Search the bluffs where he has a commanding view of the road. Kill him, <name>, and the immediate threat should cease.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wand of Separation
|Boar Hunter's Boots
|Togrik's Legguards
|Boar Hunter's Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Does Tortusk still draw breath?

==Completion==
Ah, so Tortusk behaved as I expected? Went right for your throat? It is good that he's dead.

The Razormane quilboar have been separated from their leadership in the southern Barrens, no doubt allowing an animal like him to come to power. Perhaps without his influence we can start a dialogue with the survivors... Although hotter heads may prevail.
