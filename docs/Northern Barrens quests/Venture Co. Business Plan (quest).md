==Objectives==
Confront [[Lizzarik]] in [[Ratchet]].
* [[Venture Co. Business Plan]]

==Description==
<An enormous volume, and printed in very small print. You can't make it through even a few sentences before the words begin to swim before your eyes.

The [[Venture Company]]'s long-term plan appears to be quite complex and nearly impossible to understand.

One thing is for certain: a competing enterprise would likely pay well to get their hands on this tome.>

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yeah? What do ya got there? Oh.

Listen, my name's on the back of that thing because I'm what you call an "investor." I put money into a bet that the company's going to succeed or not.

It's all a little complicated, so don't worry your pretty little head. I didn't do anything wrong, technically! We're just leveraging some existing infrastructure to make a little gold.

It's harmless.

Hey, look, I've got a huge bag of [[:Azerite]] right here! Why don't you take it with you? Too heavy for me, really.
