==Objectives==
Report to [[Kargal Battlescar]] at [[Far Watch Post]] in [[Northern Barrens]].

==Description==
For years, the [[Barrens]] have been the heart of the [[Horde]] presence on [[Kalimdor]], a vital link between the [[orc]]s of [[Durotar]] and the [[tauren]] settlements in [[Mulgore]].

In the chaos of the [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]], floods, earthquakes, and even a [[quilboar]] invasion threaten to separate us from this vital grassland.

You look ready for a challenge. Report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post and ensure the route to the Barrens remains clear! Head west from nearby [[Razor Hill]] and cross the [[Southfury River|southfury river]] to find him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|85}}
*370 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
A fresh recruit from Orgrimmar is it?

<Kargal sizes you up.>

I'll take what I can get. Keeping the roads open has been a nightmare.
