==Objectives==
Access the control console at the Venture Company research site.
*[[Control Console Operating Manual]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Venture Company]] have a small research facility west of here, just past the [[Sludge Fen]]. I don't know very much about what they're doing, but did manage to discover that they're experimenting with something called a "[[samophlange]]".

Now what the heck is a samophlange? Well, whatever it is, I want to examine it, so I need someone to go get it.

I obtained a copy of their control system operating manual, you should be able to figure out how to disengage the samophlange from it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 560 - 60 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Completion==
A variety of buttons, levers, and blinking lights are somewhat erratically arrayed on the face of the control console. A small gauge indicates that the apparatus is currently operating within optimal levels, and indicates that control valves one through three are currently open. There is a small keyhole set into the lower right side of the control panel.

==Progression==
{{Samophlange}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.6|note=Added, replacing [[Samophlange (Classic)|the previous version]].}}
