==Objectives==
Collect 10 Theramore Medals from Theramore Marines and Deck Hands. Kill Lieutenants Pyre and Buckland.
* [[Lieutenant Buckland]] slain
* [[Lieutenant Pyre]] slain
* [[Theramore Medal]] (10)

==Description==
Yet another ship from my fleet has been lost to those overzealous humans from [[Theramore]]!

Their [[Rear Admiral Hartley|new Rear Admiral]] has parked himself right off the coast here. He's boarding or sinking any vessel that doesn't heave-to at his whim.

Travel south along the [[Merchant Coast]] to his camp. Bring me the medals of the marines and deck hands. Execute his top Lieutenants, Pyre and Buckland. Lay waste to them as they have laid waste to my fleet!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]]
* +75 reputation with [[Horde]]

==Progress==
Fill my hand with medals from their dead and I will know that vengeance has been given to my fallen privateers.

==Completion==
I see you've made the righteous Rear Admiral suffer as I have. Perhaps this blow will weaken the resolve of [[Northwatch]]. His supply of fresh recruits seems inexhaustible, but the loss of his top Lieutenants will weaken him for some time.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Renamed from "[[The Guns of Northwatch (Classic)|The Guns of Northwatch]]", updated for ''Cataclysm''.}}
