==Objectives==
Obtain the Demon Seed.
*[[Demon Seed]]

==Description==
Listen <name>, we can't leave quite yet. I managed to overhear their plans while they were preparing for the ritual sacrifice.

They're planning to use a powerful artifact called the Demon Seed to launch a full scale attack on the [[Horde]]. They're keeping it under close guard over in [[Dreadmist Den|that cave]].

If you can get your hands on the Demon Seed, we should take it to my sister [[Nagala Whipshank|Nagala]]. She'll know what to do with it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Sacrificial Blade}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What did you find at the top of the mountain?

==Completion==
<Name>, you're back! [[Balgor Whipshank|Balgor]] made it down before you, and he's already eaten two bowls of raptor stew. Considering that his appetite hasn't suffered, I'm sure he will be fit to travel in no time.

I'll make sure that this artifact is taken care of. You've done us a great service today.

==Notes==
The Demon Seed is protected by [[Xelnaz]].

While at the Peak, Balgor has some unique gossip:
:They're planning to sacrifice me! Their demons are already licking their chops over my corpse.
:<Balgor shudders.>
:Makes me think twice about my own diet.
:Anyway, they've got a guard watching my every move. I can get myself out of here, but I need a good distraction.
