==Objectives==
Acquire King Reaperclaw's Horn.
* [[King Reaperclaw's Horn]]

==Description==
The [[raptor]]s of the [[Barrens]] are smarter than raptors in other lands. I think all those smarts are hiding in their horns! If so, then I could grind their horns into powder and use it to make "smart drinks." I'll make a fortune!

Here's where you come in: I want the horn from the smartest raptor around. "{{NPC||King Reaperclaw}}" leads a whole pack of intelligent raptors up on the bluffs north of [[Ratchet]]. Bring me his horn! And don't get ripped to ribbons like everyone else I've sent!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:
*5x [[Raptor Punch]]
*740 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]]
*+125 reputation with [[Everlook]]
*+125 reputation with [[Booty Bay]]
*+125 reputation with [[Gadgetzan]]

==Progress==
Did you get King Reaperclaw's horn, <name>? I need to test my first smart drink!

==Completion==
Great, you got it! Let's grind this up and mix it with some wine, and...

==Notes==
King Reaperclaw patrols the east side of Thorn Hill, accompanied by two {{NPC||Sunscale Consort||Sunscale Consorts}}.

On completion:
