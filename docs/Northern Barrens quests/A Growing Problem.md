==Objectives==
Bring Tonga's Eyes to [[Thunderhead Summit]] southwest of [[Ratchet]].
*[[Tonga's Eyes]] Taken to Summit
*[[Tonga's Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
An explosion of life from barren soil... My companion [[Jerrik Highmountain|Jerrik]] has described similar events happening elsewhere in the [[Barrens]]. I shall have to see this for myself, but I cannot abandon my post.

Here, <name>, I will loan you my 'eyes.' My eagle companion here has served me since I was named. Please accompany him to Thunderhead Summit, where Jerrik awaits, and we will investigate.

To get to the peak, follow the road east out of the [[Crossroads]]. Turn south when you reach a large stone scrawled with paintings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||4|25}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Tonga knows these lands better than any of us, and I believe it physically hurt him to see it torn asunder.

==Completion==
I am glad Tonga was able to witness the [[overgrowth]] firsthand - words can't convey the scope of the damage. Did you bring his totem? I will return it to him when I am finished here.

==Notes==
Reach the summit to complete the quest:

:{{text|say|Tonga's Spirit|We must do everything in our power to stop the same from happening here. We'll have to step up our investigations of the oases and stop this phenomenon at the source. We'll talk again at Crossroads!}}
