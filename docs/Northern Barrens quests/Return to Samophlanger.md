==Objectives==
Take the Re-engineered Samophlange Wreckage back to [[Sputtervalve]] at [[Nozzlepot's Outpost]]. Talk to Wenikee to port directly to him.
* [[Re-Engineered Samophlange Wreckage]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, that didn't work. The structural integrity of the samophlange is at an all-time low. I could add some more dials to try and fix it, but...that might make things even worse.

Look what I discovered when I blocked the release valve and blew the cover off the differential casing, though: the personal stamp of "[[Boss Copperplug]]."

Take this back to Sputtervalve and tell him to find this Copperplug genius. When you're done here, just talk to me and I'll send you back using [[Brak Blusterpipe|Brak]]'s teleporter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 370 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is that my samophlange? I don't even recognize it.

==Completion==
Wenikee said what? Copperplug? BOSS Copperplug? Oh no, this might be tricky.

==Notes==
Talk to Wenikee again:
:Did Brak say this teleporter thing was tested? Well, if you're ready to go back to Nozzlepot's Outpost, just say the word! I hope you get there in one piece.

:{{Gossip|Send me back to Nozzlepot's Outpost.}}

The player is instantly teleported back to the outpost. As before, they end up some distance above ground, but not high enough to kill them.
