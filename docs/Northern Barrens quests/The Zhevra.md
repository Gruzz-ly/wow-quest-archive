==Objectives==
Slay [[Zhevra Runner]]s to collect 4 Zhevra Hooves.
* [[Zhevra Hooves]] (4)

==Description==
If you wish to serve my beloved [[horde]], you'll have to prove your strength to me, pup. You can cut your teeth by hunting [[zhevra]]. They may not be the strongest of [[beast]]s in the [[Barrens]], but stay clear of their kick or you'll regret it.

Hunt the zhevra to the north and south, and collect their hooves. Bring them to me and perhaps we'll next send you against something tougher.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
How many zhevra have you slain?

==Completion==
Not bad, <name>. Those zhevra hold a lot of strength in their legs. I've seen them knock even a [[tauren]] on its haunches!

It looks like you have some strength in you too.

==Progression==
{{Hunting the Huntress}}
