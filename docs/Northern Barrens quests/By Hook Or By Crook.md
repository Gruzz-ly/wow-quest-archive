==Objectives==
Question the nearby Razormane prisoner. If he's not there or unconscious, [[Togrik]] can revive him for you.
*Razormane Prisoner Interrogated

==Description==
I suppose he'll come around with some cold water to the face. What do you think he'll tell us?

I'll secure him inside our livestock pen behind me here. I don't think he'll stay conscious long. Find out what you can about why the [[quilboar]] are attacking our farms! I'll leave the interrogation methods up to your better judgment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||4|25}}
* 560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, did he squeal?

==Completion==
Very interesting - our brute here seems both enthralled and terrified of the one they call "[[Tortusk]]." A powerful leader can inspire his people to acts or greatness or atrocity... but we [[orc]]s know that more than others.

We should turn our attention to this Tortusk problem.

==Notes==
Talk to the [[Captured Razormane]] in chains to start interrogating him. Every option except "''Who sent you!?''" makes him give in.

If you choose to give him food or tickle him for the information, you get a "Saintly" buff that increases health regeneration rate by 3% for 20 minutes. If you choose to keep hitting him, you get a "Nasty" buff that increases your melee damages by 4 and your magical damages by 8.

:{{text|say|Captured Razormane|Oof! I not talking!}}
:{{text|say|Captured Razormane|You waste your strength! [[Tortusk]] train us warriors never to talk.}}
:{{text|say|Captured Razormane|Oh - I've said too much!}}

:{{Gossip|<Offer food.>}}
:{{text|emote|The Captured Razormane warily takes the offered food.}}
:{{text|say|Captured Razormane|Mnn, <snort> why you cook this meat? Tortusk tells us meat taste best when stolen and raw.}}
:{{text|say|Captured Razormane|Oh - I've said too much!}}

:{{Gossip|<Tickle Time!>}}
:{{text|say|Captured Razormane|Haha - <snort> ha - heee! <snort> Haha no stop haha <SNORT> <wheeze> Hee hee! Battlemaster Tortusk never prepared us for this!}}
:{{text|say|Captured Razormane|Oh - I've said too much!}}

If the Captured Razormane disappears because you took too long, talk to Togrik:

:{{Gossip|Togrik, can you wake up the prisoner again?}}
