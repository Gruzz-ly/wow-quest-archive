When a waptor steps on my waptor twap, it'll shwink down so that it's wess dangewous. It's wewwy easy! I would do it myself but wecentwy I wan acwoss [[King Reaperclaw|King Weapercwaw]].

==Trivia==
[[Kala'ma]]'s speech is clearly reminiscent of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Fudd Elmer Fudd] of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes Looney Tunes] fame. The quest is somewhat reminiscent of Elmer's always going 'wabbit hunting' trying to catch [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugs_Bunny Bugs Bunny].
