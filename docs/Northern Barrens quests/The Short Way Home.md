==Objectives==
Take a ride on the [[Silver Bullet X-831]].
*Rocket Ride Taken

==Description==
Looks like your work here is done, <class>. You'd better head back to the [[Crossroads]].

Luckily for you, my Silver Bullet X-831 prototype is finished, and she's ready for a test drive. Whaddaya say you do me one last favor and take her for a little spin?

One of my assistants will accompany you. Your sweet, sweet ride is waiting on the platform behind me. Just hop on when you're ready.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

==Progress==
I designed the Silver Bullet X-831 myself. Isn't she a beauty?

==Completion==
I thought you were a goner. Glad to see you're still in one piece.

:{{Text|say|[[Gyrotilt]]|Wow, wow, wow! I can't believe Sputtervalve actually let me drive this baby! Have I mentioned this is my first time flying? Don't worry though. I have everything under control.}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|Man, oh man...Just look at that amazing view! Are those [[Lion|LIONS]]? Oops, almost let go of the steering wheel there.}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|Wait until the guys back home find out about this! This is soooo totally geared out!}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|My dream is to be as brilliant as Sputtervalve someday. You should see his design for a two-wheeled tricycle!}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|Well here we are, back at the Crossroads, safe and sound.}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|Huh? Hold on, the engine stalled...}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|Whoa! What's going on?}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|No, no, no...this can't be happening. This wasn't part of the travel plan!}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|Auuugh! Looks like we're taking an unexpected detour! Hold on tight!}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|Maybe if I press this green button. No, what about this blue one? Hold on, let me try resplicing some wires. Ow!}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|Nothing's working!}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|I can't stop it. We're in for a crash landing!}}
:{{Text|say|Gyrotilt|Oh no, Sputtervalve is going to kill me! Sigh...You'd better find your own transportation from here. I have to pick up the pieces and start the long walk back to camp...}}
