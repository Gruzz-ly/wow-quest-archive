Recover 6 of Sputtervalve's Blueprints from [[Venture Co. Drudger]]s, [[Venture Co. Mercenary|Mercenaries]], or [[Venture Co. Peon|Peons]].
*[[Sputtervalve's Blueprints]] (6)

==Description==
I'm just a little guy, trying to set up my own independent business. Working hard toward the Azerothian dream, ya know?

Well soon as I set up shop, the [[Venture Co]]. next door decided they wanted me out. They've been harrassing{{sic}} me with threatening letters, using words like 'cease' and 'desist.' 

Worst of all, the schematics for my newest machine are missing, and I know those corporate pilferers stole them! Go to the [[Sludge Fen]] and knock out some of their employees. I know they're hiding my blueprints! 

==Progress==
I can't believe they would stoop so low! Did you get my blueprints back? 

==Completion==
Thanks for recovering my blueprints. Now my work on the [[Silver Bullet X-831]] can continue.
