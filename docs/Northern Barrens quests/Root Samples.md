==Objectives==
Collect 8 Root Samples from herbs around [[Northern Barrens|North Barrens]].
* [[Root Sample]] (8)

==Description==
The herbs of the [[Barrens]] are not quite like herbs in other lands. Their properties are mostly the same, but the oasis water here alters the plants; they are just slightly different.

I want to study those differences... to see if they're exploitable!

If you are skilled in [[herbalism]], then gather root samples off the herbs you find in the Barrens. Bring back these samples so that I may compare them with herbs from other regions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Spore-Covered Tunic]]
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]]

;Classic
*[[Spore-covered Tunic]]
* {{cost||8}}
* 1,150 XP
*{{wow-inline|classic=}}+100 or {{bc-inline|classic=}}+250 [[reputation]] with Ratchet

==Progress==
Hello, <name>. Did you get those root samples?

==Completion==
Yes yes, these are very nice! I will grow specimens from these roots and study them. I hope to find new properties from them. Hidden, valuable properties...!

And don't worry – if I do then you'll be the first to know. Because I'll need someone to gather more!

==Notes==
You will need to have [[Herbalism]] in order to get this quest.

==Patch changes==
