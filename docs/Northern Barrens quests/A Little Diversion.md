==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Kolkar clan|Kolkar]] [[Centaur]].
* Kolkar Centaur Killed (8)

==Description==
I was sent here to scout out the centaur activity. I've been trackin' their every movement for days! It's time for me ta sneak out, but they've got [[Forgotten Pools|this oasis]] surrounded.

You look like a dangerous one. Can you make a lot of noise for me? Stir 'em up! Start killin' indiscriminately. While they're looking out for you I'll slip out to get my info to [[Regthar Deathgate]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I love watchin' these guys scurry all over.

==Completion==
Oh, ho! That was beautiful. I probably shouldn't have stayed to watch. Now that they're looking for you, I'll slip quietly away in the dust of their aimless gallopin'.

Be sure to look for my buds at the other pools. Boss has agents at every one.

==Progression==
{{The Forgotten Pools (2)}}
