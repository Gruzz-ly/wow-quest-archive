==Objectives==
Find a missing [[Grol'dom Kodo]] somewhere within [[Thorn Hill]] in [[Northern Barrens]].

==Description==
Friend, if you are traveling south to Thorn Hill, I was wondering if you could locate one of our missing [[kodo]]s? Not every caravan has made it up the pass from [[Far Watch Post]]. Those [[Razormane tribe|Razormane]] brutes hijacked a pack animal yesterday morning. It may not still be alive, but if it is, we cannot afford to lose more of our livestock.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 560 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This poor battered kodo looks to be on the verge of death, but it's still breathing. The Razormane haven't even plundered its cargo yet. If it can be revived, you may be able to save the entire shipment.

==Progression==
{{Drag it Out of Them}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
