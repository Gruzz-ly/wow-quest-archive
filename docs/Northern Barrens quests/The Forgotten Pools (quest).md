==Objectives==
Search the bottom of the [[Forgotten Pools]] northwest of the [[Crossroads]].
* Explore the waters of the Forgotten Pools

==Description==
Have you felt the tremors, <class>? [[Cataclysm (event)|Something]] has [[Great Divide|cleaved this land in two]]. But we [[druid]]s can sense other tremors, as well.

Life is stirring in lands once dry and lifeless. The oases around the Crossroads are suddenly blooming. I can sense a power leaking its way to the surface, but from where? Is it related to the disaster that shattered the [[Barrens]]?

We must find the source. Travel to the Forgotten Pools, northwest of the Crossroads. Search its waters for a source of power, then return here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*560 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Have you been to the Forgotten Pools, <name>? Did you find anything?

==Completion==
You found a fissure in the earth, with power emanating from it? Strange. Something is causing that oasis to bubble over suddenly with life.

Come, <class> - there is something else I'd like you to investigate with me.

==Notes==
*You must dive into the oasis and go near the bubbling rock on the bottom to explore the waters of the Forgotten Pools before heading back to Tonga Runetotem.
