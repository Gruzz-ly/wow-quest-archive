==Objectives==
Speak to Kadrak at [[Mor'shan Rampart]]s and accompany him to [[Splintertree Post]].
*Splintertree Post Siege Broken

==Description==
You're coming with me, <name>.

There's no one else that I can spare, and we cannot afford for Splintertree to be lost.

Prepare yourself, and speak to me again when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Gorka's Band]]
*{{cost||10|}} 
*1250 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Work complete!

==Completion==
Gorka's death was not in vain, <name>.

Splintertree would have certainly fallen if we hadn't come when we did.

Now we must get to work shoring up her defenses.

This isn't over....

==Notes==
