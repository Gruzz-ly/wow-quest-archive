==Objectives==
Give [[Kargal Battlescar]] at the [[Barrens]] outpost your recruitment letter.
* [[Recruitment Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
Hmm, you look pretty strong.

Listen, my good friend Kargal needs some new recruits for Barrens duty. I know you want to do what's right for the Horde. Well, this is your chance.

Take this recruitment letter to Kargal and see if he'll sign it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 370 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +75 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
What do you want, pup? If you're not here for recruitment, I don't have time for you.

==Completion==
Oh, so Takrin sent you?

<Kargal warily eyes your recruitment letter and shoves it unceremoniously into his vest>

I'll sign this when you've earned it. I've got reports from down south that this whole continent is being [[Cataclysm (event)|torn apart]]. Meanwhile, we've got supply caravans backed up to the river and outposts under siege from here to [[Stonetalon Mountains|Stonetalon]]. You want to prove your worth to the [[horde]]? Start by proving it here.

==Progression==
{{Preserving the Barrens}}
