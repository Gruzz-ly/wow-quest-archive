The Razormane have stolen plenty of grain from previous caravans. You can gather up stolen grain from the nearby camps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The creature doesn't lift its head, but looks at you imploringly with large, watery eyes.

==Completion==
The Kodo is voracious! You might as well be pouring those sacks of grain into a hole!

Already the animal is beginning to perk up.

==Notes==
Complete the quest and the kodo returns to the farm.
