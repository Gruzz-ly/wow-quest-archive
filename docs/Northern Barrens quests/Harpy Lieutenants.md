==Objectives==
Kill 6 Witchwing Slayers in the [[Dry Hills]] of the [[Northern Barrens]].
*[[Witchwing Slayer]] slain (6)

==Description==
The only way to stop the [[harpy]] raiders is to destroy their chain of command. The harpies are led by fearless [[lieutenant]]s, Witchwing Slayers. If the Slayers fall, the rest will follow.

Go to the Dry Hills and cut down the Witchwing Slayers. Make sure they die painfully, <name>. We want those harpy wenches to know the idiocy of picking fights with the [[Horde]].

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*{{cost||5|65}}
*740 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you killed 6 Witchwing Slayers yet? Justice must be dealt to them for their vicious attacks on the Horde.

==Completion==
You examine the destruction around you and nod in satisfaction. The harpies' leaders have been dealt with. For now.

==Progression==
