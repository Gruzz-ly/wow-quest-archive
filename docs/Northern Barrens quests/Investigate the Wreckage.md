==Objectives==
Find the wrecked caravan near the road between [[Ratchet]] and [[Crossroads]] and search the area for clues.
* [[Caravan]] Scene Searched

==Description==
Not long ago, a shipment of silver was stolen en route from here to Crossroads. It was meant as payroll to the guards, and we want that silver back.

I'll ask around here for clues, but I want you to investigate the scene of the crime. Head west and look for a crashed caravan wagon just north of the road between here and Crossroads. Find out who took our silver and get it back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This [[Horde]] caravan was not merely robbed. It was savagely brutalized. Crates of supplies have been ripped apart by sharp claws. The wagon has been demolished. The food has been eaten and the silver is gone, and yet useful supplies have been left behind...
