==Objectives==
Kill 5 Razormane Defenders, 5 Razormane Thornweavers, and [[Kreenig Snarlsnout]]. Take Snarlsnout's Tusk.
* [[Razormane Thornweaver]] slain (5)
* [[Razormane Defender]] slain (5)
* [[Kreenig Snarlsnout's Tusk]]

==Description==
Pigmen running amok right on the border of [[Durotar]]? Not on my watch! It is as they say, <name>: The best defense is crushing all who oppose you.

One of my scouts followed the [[quilboar]] after the last caravan raid, so we know where to strike. Kreenig Snarlsnout is the mastermind behind the attacks along the river. Crush him, <class>. Defeat him and disembowel his forces so that the attacks on this camp cease.

Search for a quilboar-infested cavern along the river, just south of our stables.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Thornweaver Leggings
|Pigman Belt
|Kargal's Breastplate
|Pigman Waistband
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Cut off the head of their leader, and chaos ensues, <name>. Learn this lesson well. It will aid you in the future.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Without Kreenig to orchestrate the raids, my [[grunt]]s should be able to keep [[Far Watch Post|Far Watch]] secure. Your people should be proud to count you among them.

==Progression==
{{Preserving the Barrens}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Pigman Waistband]] added as a reward.}}
