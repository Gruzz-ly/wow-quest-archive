==Objectives==
Plant a Fungal Culture near the [[Stagnant Oasis]] and observe the results.
*Fungal Culture Planted
*[[Fungal Cultures]] (provided)

==Description==
I've cultured these unusual spores you dug up with a most magnificent cocktail of ... reagents ... that I'm fond of. I'm eager to see how my manipulated spores react to the waters of the [[Crossroads]] oases.

The Stagnant Oasis to the southeast should provide us an uncontaminated site for our experiment. Simply plant this culture in the moist soil anywhere near the oasis, and document the results for me.

Be sure to cover your mouth, <class>.

<[[Apothecary Helbrim|Helbrim]] grins disarmingly.>

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fuzzy Gloves
|Ointment-Coated Bracers
|Ointment-Coated Handwraps
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Out with it, <class>! What happened at the oasis?

==Completion==
Explosive spore clouds? You don't say ... tell me more. Choking? Stinging? Burning of the eyes? Was there itching? Nausea? Mortification? Delightful, DELIGHTFUL! You've certainly earned your commission, <name>.

That skin rash of yours should pass in a day or two.

==Progression==
{{Fungal Spores (2)}}
