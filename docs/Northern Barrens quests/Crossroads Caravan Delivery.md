==Objectives==
Talk to [[Rocco Whipshank]] at [[Grol'dom Farm]] and escort his caravan all the way to the [[Crossroads]].
* Crossroads Caravan Escorted
* [[Halga's "Street Sweeper"]] (provided)

==Description==
<Rocco hands you a familiar-looking shotgun.>

I took the liberty of cleaning up [[Halga Bloodeye|Halga's]] artillery for you. I'm sure I don't need to warn you about the kickback. Just ask me when you're ready to mount up for the Crossroads! [[Thork]] is waiting for you there. Be sure not to give him any lip.

Don't stop for nothing, <name>, and if someone gets too close, just give 'em a thump with the butt-end of your gun. Do us proud!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Was that you I saw waving a gun around from the back of my last caravan?

==Completion==
It's about time we got some supplies through here. It's bad enough to be severed from [[Mulgore]], but this city would fall apart if we lost our trade with [[Orgrimmar]].

==Notes==
[[File:Halga's Street Sweeper 2.jpg|thumb|The cleaned-up "Street Sweeper".]]
Talk with Rocco again to start the escort.
:Are you ready to do this, <name>?
:{{gossip|Bring it on, Rocco.}}
:{{text|say|Rocco Whipshank|There she is. Mount up!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Defend the Caravan Kodo!}}
:{{text|say|Rocco Whipshank|Ride hard and show no mercy!}}

The caravan will appear, made up of [[Balgor Whipshank]] riding a [[Head Caravan Kodo]] and another [[Crossroads Caravan Kodo|kodo]] behind. Click to mount the lead kodo. It's trickier this time since you can't tab-target the [[Burning Blade Raider]]s. Click them when you have the opportunity to shoot them, and hit them with the shotgun if they get too close.
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank| The Burning Blade? What are they doing here? Shoot to kill!}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Incredible shooting! I'll try to calm the animals down. Report to Thork, he will want to know of this attack.}}

==Progression==
