==Objectives==
Gather six Heavy Dwarven Rifles.
* [[Heavy Dwarven Rifle]] (6)

==Description==
Now, any good mutiny is going to need serious firepower. [[Cap'n Garvey]] claimed all the best firearms for himself: A whole shipment of big, heavy dwarven flintlocks. He keeps them at his side in the other building across the island. Grab me six of those rifles and I'll distribute them to me future officers...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Guns, mon. You got the stuff?

==Completion==
<Tony unhinges one of the weapons and peers down the barrel.>

Oooh, very nice. Shiny. Loud. Now we're talkin'.

Not much left to do but close the deal...
