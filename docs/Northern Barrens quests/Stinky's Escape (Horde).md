==Objective==
Escort [["Stinky" Ignatz]], then speak with [[Mebok Mizzyrix]] in [[Ratchet]].
*Help Stinky find [[Bogbean Plant|Bogbean Leaves]]

==Description==
Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me!!

I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>.

A [[goblin]] from Ratchet named Mebok Mizzyrix needs some bogbean leaves for a potion, or something... I honestly don't care why—his money was good and I know [[Dustwallow Marsh|this swamp]], so here I am.

Too bad I got myself surrounded before I found the bogbean! Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for Mebok's plant?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Elixir of Fortitude]]
*{{cost||40}}
* 290 - 3700 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|s=22|c=20}} compensation at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]]

;Classic
*{{wow-inline|classic=}}+100 or {{bc-inline|classic=}}+250 reputation with Ratchet

==Completion==
Stinky was here with the herbs I ask of him, and he told me you helped him out of a bind. Good work! A friend of Stinky's is a friend of mine! 

He asked me to give you this if I ever saw you, right before he walked back south toward the marsh.

==Notes==
The quest involves escorting Stinky as he picks Bogbean Leaves, and then visiting Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet once he is finished.

You can find Stinky at {{coords|45|17|Dustwallow Marsh}}. He wanders around the swamp a bit until he finds the Bogbean Leaves. There aren't any ambushes, but there will be some mobs in the area unless you've already killed them. He gets onto a road at {{coords|49|25|Dustwallow Marsh}} and the quest is completed.

Then head over to [[Ratchet]] in [[Northern Barrens]] to turn-in.
