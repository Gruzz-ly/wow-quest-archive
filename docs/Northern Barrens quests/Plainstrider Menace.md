==Objectives==
Collect 7 Plainstrider Beaks.
*[[Plainstrider Beak]] (7)

==Description==
Are you familiar with [[Tallstrider|plainstriders]]? Useless animals. Can't fly. Gamey. Brain the size of my knuckle. Too dim to get out of the way of a moving cart. I've broken more axles thanks to their thick skulls... Sometimes I think the [[quilboar]] intentionally frighten flocks of them into the path of our caravans just prior to an ambush.

Make me proud, <class>. Cut a swath through those filthy birds to keep the roads free, and bring me their beaks as proof.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the plainstrider beaks?

==Completion==
Very good, <name>. That's one less thing to worry about on the road.

==Progression==
{{Preserving the Barrens}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing [[Plainstrider Menace (Classic)|previous version]].}}
