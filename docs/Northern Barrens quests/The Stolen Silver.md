==Objectives==
Kill 8 Sunscale Ravagers, 4 Sunscale Scytheclaws, and locate the Stolen Silver.
* [[Sunscale Ravager]] slain (8)
* [[Sunscale Scytheclaw]] slain (4)
* [[Stolen Silver]]

==Description==
It's clear that these [[raptor]]s acted alone to steal the [[Horde]]'s silver.

It's time to teach these beasts a lesson.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Silver-Edged Blade
|Silver-Trim Leggings
|Silver-Trim Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You look roughed up, <class>. Did you tussle with the [[Thief|thieves]]?

==Completion==
<Gazrog opens the lockbox and begins counting up the silver while you relate your story.>

What!? Raptors? Just the raptors? Assaulting our [[caravan]]s and looting them? Perhaps they are as intelligent as the rumors say. As if we didn't enough problems, now we've got to deal with brainy lizards with a lust for coin.

Here, <name> - you've earned a share of the rescued silver. Thank you.

==Notes==
Make sure to pick up [[Waptor Twapping]] from {{NPC||Kala'ma}} nearby.
