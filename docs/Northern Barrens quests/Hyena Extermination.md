==Objectives==
Kill 6 Hecklefang Hyenas. 
*[[Hecklefang Hyena]] slain (6)

==Description==
Hey <name>, we've got a real problem here. There's an overpopulation of [[hyena]]s just west of the [[Sludge Fen]], and they're starting to become a menace.

If I have to listen to them caterwauling one more night, I just might go crazy! [[Vernon Soursprye|Vernon]] over there says the hyenas might even have made off with [[Mr. Oinky|one of his stabled pigs]]. We can't have that happening.

Can you go thin out the hyena numbers? You'll find them parading in broad daylight to the west.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I should have brought earplugs. I didn't realize the [[Barrens]] could be so noisy.

==Completion==
Good riddance! Those filthy pests are more trouble than they're worth. 

==Patch changes==
