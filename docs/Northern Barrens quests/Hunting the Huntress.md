==Objectives==
Collect 5 Huntress Claws from [[Savannah Huntress]]es.
* [[Huntress Claws]] (5)

==Description==
If you want to really demonstrate your bravery to me, let me send you after something that really bites. The savannah huntresses of the [[Barrens]] are as sly as they come. Tough, resourceful, quick... and deadly. They've been hassling our [[scout]]s recently around the outskirts of the town, especially to the northeast.

Be wary as you hunt them, <name>, or you may find yourself no longer the predator, but instead the prey.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
How goes your hunt, <name>?

==Completion==
Ah, I see you've been busy. I hope you learned a lot from this prey, <name>. You'll need the strength and cunning of beasts like these to serve my beloved [[Horde]].
