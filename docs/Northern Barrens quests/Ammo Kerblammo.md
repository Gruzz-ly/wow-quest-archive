==Objectives==
Destroy 5 [[Theramore Ammunition Stockpile]]s along the coast.
* Ammo Dumps Destroyed (5)

==Description==
Hartley must've unloaded all of his ordnance along the beach. Let's pull his teeth out, <name>!

Run along the shore and look for his munitions stockpiles. Light 'em up and he'll be land-locked and unarmed while the Bellipotent is repaired.

I'll meet you back here in [[Ratchet]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gouging Staff
|Bellipotent Gloves}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So... how fares [[Rear Admiral Hartley|Vice Admiral Hartley]]? Miserable, I hope?

==Completion==
Hah! Beautiful work, <name>. Those Alliance cretins will never trace this back to me. Meanwhile, it's back to business as usual: smuggling, double-dealing, price-gouging... I've got a lot of work to catch up on.

Here, I'll let you in on a cut of my future profits. Enjoy!
