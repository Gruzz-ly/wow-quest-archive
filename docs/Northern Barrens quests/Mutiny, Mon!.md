==Objectives==
Use the Pirate Signal to summon {{NPC||Tony Two-Tusk}} and his crew to the Maiden's Dagger. Help him to defeat {{NPC||Alicia Cuthbert}} below decks.
* [[Pirate Signal Horn]] (provided)
* Maiden's Dagger Captured

==Description==
Now for my favorite part of any mutiny: the killin'! For [[pirate]]s, it doesn't matter who's supposed to be in charge, only who's in control of the ships. Anchored on the east end of this island is the [[Maiden's Dagger (vessel)|Maiden's Dagger]], {{NPC||Cap'n Garvey}}'s old flagship. He left his most trusted officer in charge: Alicia Cuthbert. Once we take her out, the ship is ours, and so's the sea.

I'll get the men onto the boats. I need you to board the Dagger and blow this horn from on deck - that'll be our signal to board. Yar!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bachelor's Dagger
|Conspirator's Slippers
|Uninsured Bracers
|Mutineer's Cloak
|Uninsured Armguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is that the Maiden's Dagger I see weighing anchor in the distance? Did you have anything to do with that?

==Completion==
So Tony is running the show there now? Good! We need more pirates like him in these waters. He's a real businessman.

<Dizzywig rubs his hands together greedily.>

Speaking of business, I suppose I owe you a cut. Would you be interested in insuring any of your new loot? You never know what can happen in a town like this...

==Notes==
Use the Pirate Signal Horn once you're on the ship.
