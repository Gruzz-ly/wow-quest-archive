==Objectives==
Investigate 5 Muddy Tracks at the [[Sludge Fen]].  
*[[Muddy Tracks (Northern Barrens)|Muddy Tracks]] Examined (5) 

==Description==
Hey <name>, do you see this footprint? We found them all over the camp last night! Nothing's missing, but all our belongings have been...examined. The muddy trails lead back toward the Sludge Fen.

Someone's been sniffing around, and I don't like it one bit. Can you go west to the Sludge Fen and investigate? See if you can find any more tracks just like this one! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My favorite wrench is missing and all my tools are muddy.

==Completion==
You look around and notice the lake is covered in slick oil. This once beautiful oasis has been ravaged. You feel a deep sense of foreboding.

==Notes==
:{{Text|bossemote|Grass, sand, and sludge mix together to form the vague resemblance of a footprint.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|The tracks are smeared, almost as if the creature drags its feet.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Mixed in with the mud are traces of oily sludge from the nearby rig.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|This trail is bloody. You follow it to a nearby bush, where you find the remains of the creature's last meal.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|These tracks are fresh, and they lead down into the water...}}
