==Objectives==
Rescue [[Balgor Whipshank]].

==Description==
They took Balgor and the caravan supplies from our very doorstep!

Those supplies are vital for our victory against the [[Alliance]] in [[Ashenvale]], and Balgor...if anything happens to my dear little brother, I will rip every [[Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade]] member to shreds myself.

<Name>, I need you to rescue Balgor and the captured caravan. Follow the path just north of us, up onto [[Dreadmist Peak]]. Do not let any of those Burning Blade dogs live.

==Completion==
<Name>, you came for me!

<Balgor sobs in relief.>

==Progression==
{{Demon Seed}}
