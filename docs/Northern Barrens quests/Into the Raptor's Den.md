==Objectives==
Kill Sunscale [[raptor]]s and collect their feathers. Use the feathers on the 3 Sunscale Nests.
*Visit [[Red Raptor Nest]]
*Visit [[Yellow Raptor Nest]]
*Visit [[Blue Raptor Nest]]

==Description==
The hunt deepens, <name>. Now you must find and defeat your prey within its lair.

Hunt the Sunscale raptors to the south, where they have built a warren amongst the hills just off of the road. Slay them and remove the feathers they wear. Place the feathers on the sunscale raptor nests to show their brethren you do not fear them!

Be cautious, <class>. Raptors hunt in packs and will swarm you if you are not cautious.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sunscale Cloak
|Darkthorn Piercer
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you been to the nests, <name>?

==Completion==
So you've been to the nests and placed the feathers of your prey within them. That took a fair portion of courage, no doubt about it.

Do you feel a little tougher, <name>? Because you look tougher now then{{sic}} when you first came here. I guess the Barrens is doing its job.

==Notes==
The best mobs for farming {{item|Sunscale Feather|s}} are [[Sunscale Lashtail]]s and [[Sunscale Screecher]]s.

==Progression==
