==Objectives==
Speak to [[Rocco Whipshank]] and ride north with the Mor'shan Caravan.
*Speak to Rocco Whipshank
*Ride Caravan to [[Dreadmist Peak]]

==Description==
The battle in Ashenvale rages on without relent. Our forces at the [[Mor'shan Ramparts]] are in desperate need of reinforcements and supplies.

We have a major shipment of medicines and food headed north, and I need a capable <class> like you to guard it.

Rocco Whipshank waits for you at the road north out of the [[Crossroads]]. Let him know you are ready to accompany the caravan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Mor'shan Ramparts is in dire need of supplies. Speak to Rocco Whipshank at the northern-most point of the Crossroads. He should be waiting for you by the side of the road.

==Completion==
This is terrible news! <name>, at least you arrived safely.

==Notes==
Talk with Rocco again to start the escort.

:<Name>, glad to see you're still in one piece! I saw a rocket fly by earlier and heard your voice screaming, so I was a bit worried.

:We have one last shipment to take care of. Talk to me when you're ready and we'll get going.

:{{gossip|I'm ready. Let's go!}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Everybody on board! This caravan's leaving for the Mor'shan Rampart!}}

The caravan will appear, made up of [[Balgor Whipshank]] riding a [[Chief Caravan Kodo]] and a humongous [[Crossroads Caravan Cart|kodo]] behind. Click to mount the lead kodo. 

This time the caravan isn't attacked while traveling:
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|How are you doing back there? Not too bumpy I hope.}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Our enemies wouldn't dare attack us this close to the [[Crossroads]]. It's further out that we'll have to watch our backs.}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|My family has been running caravan routes in the [[Barrens]] since [[Orgrimmar]] was settled. We raise and train the [[kodo]]s ourselves. My sister [[Nagala Whipshank|Nagala]] is the best kodo breeder outside of [[Mulgore]].}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Bet you didn't know that a kodo can eat its own weight in grass each day. Sure is a lot to shovel when it comes out the other end.}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Hope you don't mind, but we'll stop at [[Dreadmist Camp]] to pick up additional supplies and fresh mounts for the last leg of the journey.}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Nagala will have her famous grilled [[zhevra]] chops waiting for us, no doubt. She says I need to cut back and eat more vegetables, but I don't think I've gained that much weight...do you?}}

After arriving at [[Dreadmist Camp]], however, something happens. Several [[Burning Blade Ambusher]]s will spawn and trap Balgor and you under nets, and then kidnap the caravan driver with his supplies:
:{{text|say|Burning Blade Ambusher 1|The [[Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade]] sends its greetings.}}
:{{text|say|Burning Blade Ambusher 2|Quickly now! Grab one of them while I take the supply cart!}}
:{{text|say|Burning Blade Ambusher 1|Which one should I take?}}
:{{text|say|Burning Blade Ambusher 2|The fat one! He'll make for a fine sacrifice.}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Help! Let me go!}}
