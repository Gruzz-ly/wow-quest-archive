==Objectives==
Protect Wizzlecrank and the [[Wizzlecrank's Shredder|stolen goblin shredder]] on the way out of the [[Sludge Fen]]s.
*Escort [[Pilot Wizzlecrank|Wizzlecrank]] out of the [[Venture Co]]. drill site
*Talk to Sputtervalve at Nozzlepot's Outpost in Northern Barrens.

==Description==
I suppose I'll learn as we go... Couldn't be too hard. Just some buttons here, and a lever or two... Well, are you ready to go?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sputtervalve Gun
|Bracers of Angry Mutterings
|Nozzlepot Leggings
|Nozzlepot Legwraps
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]]

==Progress==
Can I help you?

==Completion==
He wrecked it!?

<Sputtervalve mutters angrily to himself before continuing>.

Hopefully we'll be able to get something of value from the wrecked shredder prototype... my business depends on it! I'll start tearing that sucker apart and we'll see what makes it tick.

Oh, let me give you something for your trouble, too.

==Notes==
Clear all the Venture Co. Mercenaries and Drugers in the area around the shredder. If you can, clear them west of the shredder as well because that is the direction you will be heading.

The Shredder does a great job of pulling extra adds from around the drill site so you'll need to stay on your toes. The shredder will assist in fights but you will most likely be doing most of the damage.

You don't have to escort the Shredder all the way back to the outpost. You just have to escort it a short distance away from the Sludge Fen. Once Wizzlecrank says he can make it back on his own, you need to return to the outpost and see Sputtervalve to complete the quest.

;On accept
:{{Text|say|Wizzlecrank's Shredder|Alright, alright! I think I can figure out how to operate this thing...}}
:''Wizzlecrank tries to work the controls, and the shredder moves rather jerkily.''
:{{Text|say|Wizzlecrank's Shredder|Arrrgh! This isn't right!}}
:''The shredder settles down.''
:{{Text|say|Wizzlecrank's Shredder|Okay, I think I've got it, now. Follow me, <name>!}}

The shredder starts heading west from his starting point. He will run west towards the ramp that slopes out of the Sludge Fen depression, aggroing the Venture Co. mobs in and on the edge of the depression.

Once you get to the top of the ramp, Venture Co. Mercenaries spawn and attack.
:{{Text|yell|[[Venture Co. Mercenary]]|There's the stolen shredder! Stop it or [[Supervisor Lugwizzle|Lugwizzle]] will have our hides!}}

Defend the shredder.

Once they are dead,
:{{Text|say|Wizzlecrank's Shredder|Looks like we're out of the woods, eh? Wonder what this does...}}
:{{Text|say|Wizzlecrank's Shredder|Come on, don't break down on me now!}}
:{{Text|say|Wizzlecrank's Shredder|That was a close one! Well, let's get going, we're almost there.}}

He walks over to (55.4,7.7). The shredder stops moving.
:{{Text|say|Wizzlecrank's Shredder|Hm... I don't think this blinking red light is a good thing...}}

It falls over. Wizzlecrank climbs out of the shredder.
:{{Text|say|Pilot Wizzlecrank|Oh boy. Do you suppose Sputtervalve will mind if the shredder is just a little bit ... inoperable?}}
:{{Text|say|Pilot Wizzlecrank|I'll try to get it started again. You go ahead. I'll find my way back on my own.}}
