==Objectives==
Investigate the Sludge Beast's resting place and kill whatever comes out.  
*[[Sludge Beast]] slain 

==Description==
Whatever is lurking around the [[Sludge Fen]], it doesn't appear to be human. Judging from the remains around its tracks, it's also dangerous.

You decide to follow the tracks down to the bottom of the lake and look for the creature's resting place. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nozzlepot's Vest
|Sludge Fen Cloak
|Sludge Encrusted Vest
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So? Did you see what's going on at the Sludge Fen?

==Completion==
You saw sludge being dumped straight into the lake? I wouldn't be surprised if the Sludge Beast were a product of the [[Venture Co.]]'s carelessness.

==Notes==
Dive in and interact with the [[Sludge Pile]] to summon the Sludge Beast:
