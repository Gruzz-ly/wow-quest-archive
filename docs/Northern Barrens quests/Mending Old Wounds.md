==Objectives==
Bring [[Mupsi Shacklefridd]] 40 [[Linen Cloth]] and 4 [[Crystal Vial]].

==Description==
You'd better think twice before setting foot in [[Ratchet]], <name>! Words been getting around of your dirty deeds.

You're in luck though, a ship just arrived with many wounded from an encounter with the [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]. This is your chance to prove you're not a complete scoundrel. Lend us a hand by bringing linen cloth for bandages and empty vials for potions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]] 
*+250 reputation with [[Booty Bay]], [[Everlook]], and [[Gadgetzan]] (unmentioned)
*-500 reputation with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]] 

==Completion==
I'm happy you're seeing the error of your ways, <name>. Keep the supplies coming; We're not going to forget about you so easily!

==Rebuilding Reputation==
If you are at 0/36000 {{reputation|hated}} with Ratchet:
* You will need to do 72 turn ins of 40 [[Linen Cloth]] and 4 [[Crystal Vial]]s to reach: "{{reputation|Hostile}}"

If you are at 0/3000 {{reputation|hostile}}:
* You will need to do 6 turn ins of 40 [[Linen Cloth]] and 4 [[Crystal Vial]]s to reach: "{{reputation|Unfriendly}}"

If you are at 0/3000 {{reputation|unfriendly}}:
* You will need to do 6 turn ins of 40 [[Linen Cloth]] and 4 [[Crystal Vial]]s to reach: "{{reputation|Neutral}}"

So in all you will need to do a grand total of 90 turn ins which is:
* 3600 [[Linen Cloth]]
* 360 [[Crystal Vial]]
