==Objectives==
Get the Tattooed Head from the entrance to the [[Alliance]] compound.
*[[Tattooed Pirate Head]]

==Description==
Here's the deal, mate: to protect me treasure map, I tattooed it onto me first mate's scalp.

Of course, he's dead now, along with most of me crew. The Alliance doesn't even know what they have - his severed head is hanging from a tree at the entrance to this camp.

Grab that head and take it to [[Gazlowe]] back in [[Ratchet]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Was Baron Longshore alive? Do you have anything for me?

==Completion==
What? What is this? I send you out to fetch my treasure and you bring me a big filthy head?

==Notes==
The first mate's head is hanging from a tree at {{coords|69|81|Northern Barrens}}. The tree is near the entrance to [[The Merchant Coast]]. The entrance has a couple of fences erected with two Alliance banners and Alliance guards. You pass it on the way through to do the other quests in the area.

On completion:

:{{text|say|Gagsprocket|Sure thing, boss.}}
:{{text|say|Gazlowe|Thanks.}}

==Progression==
