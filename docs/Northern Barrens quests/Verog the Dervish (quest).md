==Objectives==
Kill [[Wyneth]] in order to lure out [[Verog the Dervish]], then slay him and grab his head.
* [[Verog's Head]]

==Description==
Verog may be hard to find, but judging by the info you gathered, his mate Wyneth is always in his command tent just west of here. If we kill her, Verog will come running.

[[Regthar Deathgate|Regthar]] sent us here to scout, but he also said we should seize any opportunity to upset the [[centaur]] chain of command if we can. Lure out Verog and kill him!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Robe of Shame
|Murderous Bracers
|Murderous Cuffs
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 560 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Did you find Verog, <name>?

==Completion==
You did it! That'll really upset the balance of power down here. Verog left no clear successor, so I expect this crew of brutes will fall on each other like hungry dogs. I'll stay here and keep an eye on what happens next.

Verog answered directly to the Kolkar Chief - killing him is a good start, but there's more work to be done.

==Notes==
*The command tent is located at approximately {{coords|51.2|78.8|Northern Barrens}}.

Kill [[Wyneth]]:
