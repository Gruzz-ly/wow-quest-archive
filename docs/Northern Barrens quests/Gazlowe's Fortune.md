==Objectives==
[[Gazlowe]] wants you to dig up his buried treasure from atop the cliffs overlooking [[Ratchet]].
* [[Gazlowe's Treasure Chest]]

==Description==
Sink me, you were right! There's a map tattooed on the skull.

That cursed [[Baron Longshore|Baron]] - he buried my treasure right under my nose. Or, above my head, anyway. The map points to a place on the bluffs over Ratchet, to the south.

Follow the road west out of the city, get atop the hill, head south, then run back towards the coast and look for an enormous tree overlooking the bay. Fetch my treasure and I'll split it with you!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bling Cane
|Vest of Fortune
|Dividend Leggings
|Hauberk of Fortune
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm going to close my eyes, <name>. And when I open them, I expect to see wall-to-wall treasure. Deal?

==Completion==
Nice work, <name>!

Oh, the Baron tried to stop you, did he? Well, I hope you gave him a pounding.

Now, I promised you a cut of the goods you recovered. Let's see... what's one percent of a half percent? Ah, here you go.

==Notes==
After retrieving the treasure at the [[Curious Pirate Landmark]], Baron Longshore appears and attacks you!
