==Objectives==
Return the Samophlange to [[Sputtervalve]] at [[Nozzlepot's Outpost]] in [[Northern Barrens]].
* [[Samophlange (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Pulling open the face of the control console reveals a dense jumble of wires, tubing and other strange mechanical objects—most of which seem to serve no practical purpose. Pushing them aside and digging deeper into the console, you find the samophlange. A tug removes it from its housing.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Painstakingly Crafted Belt
|Clean Room Boots
|Dusty Treads
}}

You will also receive:
*740 - 70 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Oh, you're back, <name>! Do you have the samophlange?

==Completion==
This is... er... interesting... yes. A device this complex is best analyzed by a team of skilled engineers in a clean room, painstakingly reverse engineering each component in a controlled environment.

But who has that kind of time?

Let's just fire this thing up and see what it does...

==Notes==
On completion:
:{{text|say|Sputtervalve|Ok, let's take a look at this thing...}}
:''Sputtervalve places the Samophlange in front of him and starts hammering away at it. After a few seconds, it explodes and burns him slightly before disappearing.''
:{{text|say|Sputtervalve|Oh, darn...}}
