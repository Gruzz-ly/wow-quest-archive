==Objectives==
Slay [[Hezrul Bloodmark]] and collect his head.
*[[Hezrul's Head]]

==Description==
Hezrul Bloodmark is the leader of the [[Kolkar clan|Kolkar]] [[centaur]]s in the [[Barrens]]. He is fierce, brutal and cunning. Defeating him would disrupt and fracture the Kolkars, greatly reducing their threat to us.

Bring me Hezrul's Head, and I will mount it from this outpost, so that they may know fear.

He leads his people from the [[Lushwater Oasis]], to the south.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Lushwater Cloak
|Gloves of Unfocused Rage
|Fractured Belt
|Hands of Unfocused Rage
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Is Hezrul defeated, <name>?

==Completion==
I commend you, <name>. These centaur are undisciplined and cannot focus their rage as the orcs can, but they are fierce nonetheless. In defeating them, your valor is proven.

==Progression==
{{Deathgate's Reinforcements}}
