==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ak'Zeloth]] at [[Far Watch Post]] in the [[Northern Barrens]].

==Description==
Since the [[Third War|last great war]] when the [[Burning Legion]] was defeated, I have searched for sources of [[demon]]ic corruption in [[orc]] society. The collar you brought me confirms my fears.

It belongs to the [[Burning Blade]].

Your role in this tale is nearly complete, <name>. Go to Far Watch Post, on the border of the Barrens to the west, and speak with my assistant, Ak'Zeloth. Pass on to him this information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 100 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +75 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Completion==
This is not news to me. While I appreciate your efforts, the Burning Blade will have to wait. We have other matters to which we must attend.

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Now offered by Arnak Fireblade.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing previous version.}}
