==Objectives==
Use the Grol'dom Net to ensnare a [[Razormane Pillager]] and drag it back to [[Togrik]] at [[Grol'dom Farm]].
*Razormane Prisoner Delivered
*[[Grol'dom Net]] (provided)

==Description==
It is our instinct to simply lash out at our attackers, but wisdom dictates another path. We should interrogate one of these [[quilboar]] invaders and learn all we can. Take this net, <name>, and ensnare a quilboar pillager attacking our farm just west of here. Club the beast unconscious and bring him to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't be too harsh with our captive, he will still need his head attached to answer our questions.

==Completion==
Oh my. We want to question this quilboar, not tenderize him!

==Notes==
[[File:Hogtied Razormane.jpg|thumb|Drag that chump.]]
Use the net on a [[Razormane Pillager]] to ensnare him. He won't be ensnared for long, so make sure you take care of it quick by "talking" to it:

:<Snort> Is this how cowards fight, <race>?
:{{gossip|<Pound this chump.>}}
:{{Text|emote|Razormane Pillager is ensnared!}}

It will then turn into a [[Hogtied Razormane]], that you have to drag back to Togrik.
