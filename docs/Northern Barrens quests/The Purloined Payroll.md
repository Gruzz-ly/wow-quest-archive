==Objectives==
Speak to [[Gazrog]] near the entrance to [[Ratchet]].

==Description==
Well, <name>. I admit there's a place for you in my beloved [[Horde]]. You've shown me strength, cunning, initiative ... Even [[Thork]] recently mentioned you by name, and neither of us are easily impressed. Well done.

Now it's time to start pulling your weight. This week's payroll for the [[Crossroads]] guards has gone missing. Gazrog in Ratchet is heading up the investigation. Talk to him!

Simply follow the road East of here to the coast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 370 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I was hoping for a squad of [[grunt]]s... but if you earned [[Sergra Darkthorn|Sergra]]'s respect, I supposed you'll be more than enough. Let me explain what's happening here.
