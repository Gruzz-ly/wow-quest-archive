==Objectives==
Defend the Mor'shan Caravan.
*Speak to [[Nagala Whipshank]]
*Mor'shan Caravan Ride Defended

==Description==
You've managed to stir the [[Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade's]] nest. Our scouts report that they are gathering for an attack.

You must complete the caravan's journey before they arrive. The supplies are packed, the [[kodo]]s are rested, and I hope you don't mind but I made a few adjustments to [[Halga's "Street Sweeper"|your gun]].

If you meet up with any resistance, shoot first and ask questions later.

Quickly! They come! Speak to me when you are ready to leave.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mor'shan Caravaneer's Leggings
|Wild Rider's Gloves
|Kadrak's Axe
|Wild Rider's Mail Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Some days we gain quarter, other days we are beaten back behind our walls. Every day, we bury more of our brothers and sisters.

<[[Kadrak]] pauses and takes a deep breath.>

Not only have the supplies you brought strengthened our troops, but your heroic deeds have inspired them as well. Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
Talk with Nagala again to start the escort.
:I can hear the howls of the Burning Blade as we speak. The kodos are ready to ride for the [[Mor'shan Rampart]]s. Tell me when you are ready to leave.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to ride.}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Good to see you again, friend. Make haste and hop on while the way is still clear.}}

The caravan will appear, made up of [[Balgor Whipshank]] riding an armored [[Master Caravan Kodo]] and another humongous [[Mor'shan Caravan Cart|kodo]] behind. Click to mount the lead kodo. [[Halga's "Street Sweeper"]] is bigger and nastier than ever, which will help repel the [[Burning Blade Attacker]]s and [[Burning Blade Windrider]]s:
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Watch out above us! Use your rocket!}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Good shooting! That one won't be getting up anytime soon.}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Look sharp! They're closing in on our heels!}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|They're coming from all sides! Hang on just a little longer - we're almost there!}}
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|By the skin of our teeth, we made it! I haven't seen shooting like that since...well...ever! I wish we could ride together again, but Kadrak has more important work for you. Thank you for delivering us safely, my friend.}}
