==Objectives==
Plant a Limpet Mine at the thinnest part of the hull of the Bellipotent.
*The [[Bellipotent]] Mined
*[[Limpet Mine]] (provided)

==Description==
<[[Gazlowe]] spreads the plans on the table and jabs a tiny finger aft of the ship below the waterline.>

There! The hull is thinnest here, where the crankshaft meets the paddlewheel. And it's right next to the magazine!

<Name>, I can't be held responsible if some enterprising [[Horde]] <class> were to attach a limpet mine to that part of the hull. Not even if I supplied the mine. And paid <him/her>. Handsomely. The ship is anchored just southeast of here... go to it!

Then radio me with this stolen gnomecorder.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did we make some nice kersplosions? Did we?

==Completion==

Excellent! I wish I could've seen the look on that [[Rear Admiral Hartley|Rear Admiral's]] face when his flagship went up like a candle. Let me use my telescope here to take a look at the damage.

What - Whhhaaatt!? That thing is still floating? Hartley must've moved the munitions ashore in case his ship was mined.

I underestimated you, Hartley... but for the last time!

==Notes==
Go over to the ship at {{coords|72|85|Northern Barrens}}. If you swim it is quicker but you will encounter a couple of makrura along the way. Go to the back of the ship near the paddlewheel. You will see a fairly large wooden section underwater. If you run your cursor over it the tooltip will indicate it to be the thinnest part of the ship.

Click on the Limpet mine in your inventory and your done. After your done Gazlowe can give you your next quest immediately.
