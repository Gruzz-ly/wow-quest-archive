==Objectives==
Slay [[Barak Kodobane]] and collect his head.
* [[Kodobane's Head]]

==Description==
The [[centaur]]s have plagued the [[tauren]] for years. And recently, the [[Kolkar clan|Kolkar]] centaurs of the [[Barrens]] have grown into a real threat. Normally they were disorganized in these lands, but new leaders have risen among them. Rallying them.

To preserve our holdings here, these centaur leaders must be destroyed.

Bring me the head of Barak Kodobane. He camps west of these [[Forgotten Pools]].

Defeat him, then return to me.

==Progress==
Hello, <name>. Do you have Kodobane's head for me?
