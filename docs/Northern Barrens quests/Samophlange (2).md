==Objectives==
Close off the Fuel Control Valve, the Regulator Valve and the Main Control Valve then use the control console again.
* Shut off [[Main Control Valve]]
* Shut off [[Fuel Control Valve]]
* Shut off [[Regulator Valve]]

==Description==
The three control valves are currently opened. The various readings on the control panel lead you to presume that they must be shut off before the apparatus can be shut off.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 370 - 40 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Blinking lights on the control console indicate that the main control valves have not been closed off.

==Completion==
The lights indicating the three control valves dim as they are shut off. Green lights slowly fade into yellow, and the switch controlling the apparatus is now moveable, with the walves closed, it can be turned off.
