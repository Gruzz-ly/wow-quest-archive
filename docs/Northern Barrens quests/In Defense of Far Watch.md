==Objectives==
Kill 8 Razormane Plunderers and 3 Razormane Hunters.
* [[Razormane Plunderer]] slain (8)
* [[Razormane Hunter]] slain (3)

==Description==
All the [[quilboar]]s are our enemies, <name>. Some just prove to be more of a nuisance than others.

The [[Razormane tribe]] has been attacking our supply caravans that roll through here from [[Orgrimmar]]. I have scouts seeking the leader of these raids, but until then, any losses you can inflict on the filthy pig men would aid us.

Start just south of here, where they've been raiding our camps near the river. Seek them out, and slay them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
...Assaulting our [[Kennel|stables]]? The audacity!

The destruction in [[Southern Barrens|southern barrens]] has pushed the Razormane up here, and they're been stealing our supplies with renewed ferocity.

The longer it takes to stop these attacks, the harder it will be to keep the people of the [[Crossroads]] armed and fed.

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>. Those insolent quilboars will finally learn that the might of the Horde is not to be ignored.

==Progression==
{{Preserving the Barrens}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing [[Disrupt the Attacks]].}}
