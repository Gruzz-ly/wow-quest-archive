==Objectives==
Collect 10 Centaur Bracers from [[Kolkar Marauder]]s and [[Kolkar Stormseer|Stormseers]].
*[[Centaur Bracers]] (10)

==Description==
The [[centaur]] leadership relies on a core of trusted, disciplined [[warrior]]s to keep the others in line. If we reduce their numbers, the [[Kolkar clan|Kolkar]] will have no might with which to support their rage. And so, I have a bounty task for you.

Around the [[Lushwater Oasis]] to the south, slay Kolkar Marauders and Stormseers to collect their bracers. Return when you have a heap of these trophies and the [[Horde]] will reward you well.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Marauding Belt
|Foolhardy Bracers
|Marauding Cord
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
How goes your hunting, <name>?

==Completion==
Nicely done. I'm sure you've struck fear into the surviving centaurs, <name>. With their greatest warriors slain, they will either stop their advances or lash out at us in a foolhardy strike.

I hope for the latter.

==Progression==
{{Deathgate's Reinforcements}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Marauding Cord]] added as a reward.}}
