==Objectives==
Get the Console Key from {{NPC||Tinkerer Sniggles}}.
*[[Console Key]]

==Description==
With the apparatus deactivated, the control panel can be opened up and the samophlange removed from the console. With everything else in place, all that is left is to acquire the key to unlock the console.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*560 - 60 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
The console lights are dimmed and the gauges and dials all read at their zero positions, everything idling.

==Completion==
Turning the key in the lock, the control console unlocks. A red light at the top of the console turns off and all power drains from the terminal.

==Progression==
{{Samophlange}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Updated for ''Cataclysm''. No longer a neutral quest.}}
