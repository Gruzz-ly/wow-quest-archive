==Objectives==
Speak with [[Halga Bloodeye]] at [[Far Watch Post]] to escort the next Crossroads Caravan to [[Grol'dom Farm]].
* Caravan Escorted
* [[Halga's "Street Sweeper"]] (provided)

==Description==
<Halga grins disarmingly, holding up an enormous [[Gun|firearm]].>

Have you ever used one of these, <name>? It's a beast. Hell with a handgrip. Too heavy to use on foot, but perfect when riding at the head of a caravan. I call it my 'street sweeper.'

We need to get those supplies you've collected to [[Crossroads]], and I expect trouble. I'd like for you to ride shotgun. Literally! Say the word when you're ready and I'll put you at the head of our next caravan.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bloodeye Belt
|Kranal's Vest
|Caravan Escort's Gloves
|Kranal's Chestplate
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Mok'ra, stranger. Are you here from [[Far Watch Post|Far Watch]]?

==Completion==
You're a sight, <race>. That's the first caravan to make it through this week!

==Notes==
[[File:Halga's Street Sweeper 1.jpg|thumb|The "Street Sweeper" in action.]]
Talk with Halga again to start the escort.
:Well, <name> - are you ready to roll? It won't be easy!
:{{gossip|Yes, I'm ready. Let's do this thing!}}
:{{text|say|Halga Bloodeye|Mount up, <name>! Do not fail me.}}
:{{Text|emote|Defend the Caravan Kodo!}}
:{{text|say|Halga Bloodeye|Head 'em up! Move 'em out!}}

The caravan will appear, made up of [[Balgor Whipshank]] riding a [[Lead Caravan Kodo]] and another [[Crossroads Caravan Kodo|kodo]] behind. Click to mount the lead kodo. Defend the caravan by targeting the [[Razormane Raider]]s and shooting them. This is easily done by tab-targeting them.
:{{text|say|Balgor Whipshank|Excellent work! I'll unload the goods. You should check in with [[Kranal Fiss]].}}
