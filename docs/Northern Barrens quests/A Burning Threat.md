Kill 8 members of the [[Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade]] at the [[Pig farm|farm]] to the southwest.
* Burning Blade Slain (8)

==Description==
While we cast our eyes toward the [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]], who watches our backs? While our leaders take up arms against [[Deathwing]], the Burning Blade plots our downfall.

Even as we speak, they are gathering recruits and supplies at the farm to the southwest. I care not to meet death at the hands of the [[Burning Legion]]. It's time we take matters into our own hands.

<Name>, will you help me keep the vigil? Go and slaughter their ranks before it's too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I may be old and retired, but my mind is still as sharp as my sword.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. This old orc will sleep more safely at night.

==Notes==
*[[Burning Blade Bruiser]]s and [[Burning Blade Acolyte]]s both count for the quest.
