==Objectives==
Board Horton Hornblower's Riverboat northeast of [[Ratchet]] and get a riverboat ride to [[Nozzlepot's Outpost]].
* Board the Riverboat to Nozzlepot
* [[Sack of Semi-Precious Stones]] (provided)

==Description==
Enjoy your cut of the loot, <name>!

I hate to share, but business is business. And that double-dealer [[Nozzlepot]] is guaranteed a 10% cut of this treasure. Can you deliver this to him at his outpost in the north?

He's got a little research station upstream, along the river. If you travel just northeast of town here, [[Horton Hornblower]] can give you a free ride on one of his riverboats. Tell him I sent ya!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 370 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Welcome, <class>. Fresh off the boat from Ratchet? Any news?

==Completion==
<Nozzlepot snatches the bag of gems from you.>

Gazlowe calls this 10%? You tell him I'm going to weigh these!

I suppose he expects me to pay you a delivery fee, as well? Find, fine. Have some spoils!

==Notes==
[[File:Riverboat.jpg|thumb|This looks legit.]]
Horton Hornblower is found at the southern [[Southfury River]], ready to take you up the river.

:{{text|emote|Horton motions to the rickety [[riverboat]] nearby.}}
:''You jump on the boat, barely managing to go up the river.''
:{{text|say|Horton Hornblower|Whew, that was a bit of a tight squeeze, but the rest of the trip should be a breeze.}}
:{{text|say|Horton Hornblower|There's nothing quite like the smell of Durotar on a warm, comfortable boat ride.}}
:{{text|say|Horton Hornblower|This is where you'd expect something to go wrong on a beautiful trip like this.}}
:{{text|say|Horton Hornblower|Everyone always says, "Horton, why do you drive a boat up and down the river?" I ask them, "Why don't you?" ... that's usually when I run out of witty retorts.}}
:{{text|say|Horton Hornblower|We're pulling up near your stop. Head due west along the road to reach Nozzlepot's Outpost.}}
