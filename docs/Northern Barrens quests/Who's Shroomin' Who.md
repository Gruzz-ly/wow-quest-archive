==Objectives==
Deliver Helbrim's Research to {{NPC||Sashya}} at [[Ratchet]] in [[Northern Barrens|North Barrens]].
* [[Helbrim's Research]] (provided)

==Description==
Think of the possibilities, <name>! Fast-growing fungal delivery agents for any manner of toxins. My companions in the [[Undercity]] will want to hear about this.

Here are my notes and some additional samples. If we're fast, we can catch the next ship bound for the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. Take the road east of here and follow it to the [[goblin]] town of Ratchet. Look for the Broken Keel tavern toward the south side of town and deliver these to my associate Sashya within.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Who are you? Did Helbrim send you? Keep a low profile.

==Completion==
Quiet! Give me those notes. Were you followed here?

==Notes==
On completion, [[Hargash]] interrupts you.

:{{text|say|Hargash|<class>, you should know [[Garrosh Hellscream|the Warchief]] doesn't trust the undead. Have you heard [[Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate|what happened at the Wrathgate]]?}}
