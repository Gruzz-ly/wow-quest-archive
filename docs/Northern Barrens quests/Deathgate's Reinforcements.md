==Objectives==
Report to [[Regthar Deathgate]] at his outpost west of the [[Crossroads]] in [[Northern Barrens]].

==Description==
<Name>! Your reputation among the [[Horde]] grows. I've been hearing reports from both the [[Forgotten Pools]] and the [[Stagnant Oasis]] that you've been a real bane to our [[centaur]] foes. Well done, indeed.

Regthar Deathgate is in charge of our operations against the centaur all over the Northern Barrens. He could use a bold <class> like yourself to bolster his forces. Report to him at his outpost along the road west of here and aid him in any way he requires.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 370 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, I've heard about your work, <class>. Your timing is fortunate - I've got a major offensive in the works.
