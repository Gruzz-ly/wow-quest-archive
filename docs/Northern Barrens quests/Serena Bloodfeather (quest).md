==Objectives==
Slay [[Serena Bloodfeather]] and collect her head.
*[[Serena's Head]]

==Description==
The [[Harpy|harpies]] you've killed mentioned their matron, Serena Bloodfeather. Judging from their vile hatred toward the [[Horde]], she must hold some kind of [[Bloodfeather|deep-seated grudge]]. You decide to hunt down Serena Bloodfeather and end matters once and for all.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cutthroat Band
|Bloodfeather Ring
|Darsok's Ring
}}

You will also receive:
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
You're not getting anything until I see Serena's head.

==Completion==
HA! Well done, <name>! Very well done... I wasn't sure you were up to the task, but you've proved yourself quite the cut-throat. Thank you again for helping us suppress the Harpy epidemic. Here is your reward, use it well.
