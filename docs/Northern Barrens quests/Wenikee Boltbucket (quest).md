==Objectives==
Bring the Broken and Battered Samophlange to [[Wenikee Boltbucket]]. Talk to [[Brak Blusterpipe|Brak]] to teleport directly to her.
* [[Broken and Battered Samophlange]] (provided)

==Description==
I think I really put my foot into that one - it looks like I might have knocked one of the load-bearing fluxors into the spokes of the deregulator gear. We can fix this, easy. I know an expert on triple-expansion piston drives who would love to get her hands on a samophlange. Take the broken samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket, just south of [[Mor'shan Rampart]], she'll patch 'er right up.

Hey, no need to walk - this gives me the perfect opportunity to test my personal people porter device!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 370 - 40 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
I'm very busy with my work, <class>. Unless you have something for me, it'd be best if you moved along...

==Completion==
Oh, what's this? A samophlange you say? What's a samophlange??

Ah... but look at the way it moves when you handle it. And there's the sound of intricate gears inside. Oh my! I want to fix it and see what it does, don't you??

==Notes==
Talk to Brak to teleport to Wenikee right away:
:Okay, my Personal People-Porter is ready for testing! I mean, ready for use. I wouldn't test unproved hardware on you, would I?

:{{gossip|I'm ready to teleport. I think.}}
:{{text|say|Brak Blusterpipe|Stand still, <name>! And hold your breath in case you end up over the ocean...}}
:{{text|say|Brak Blusterpipe|Yep, he's a goner.}}
''The teleport doesn't end as intended as you end up some distance above ground, fortunately enough to not kill you. If you haven't got the achievement [[Going Down?]] yet, you'll get it now.''
