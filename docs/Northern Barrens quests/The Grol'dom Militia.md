==Objectives==
Slay 6 Razormane Pillagers.
* [[Razormane Pillager]] slain (6)

==Description==
They came out of nowhere, <class>! [[Quilboar]] from horizon to horizon. Spines and snouts and teeth. We fell back to [[Grol'dom Farm|the farm]] but they kept on coming.

Our best defenders have fallen in the field, and we've no sign of Farmer [[Ralton]]. I need you to go on the offensive for me! Hold these swine at bay while I defend the wounded until help arrives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can see smoke from the neighboring building - what's going on out there?

==Completion==
I see you've left a string of corpses in your wake, <race>. I couldn't have done better. The livestock may be lost, but the land remains ours - thank you!

==Progression==
{{Drag it Out of Them}}
