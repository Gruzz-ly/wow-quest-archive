==Objectives==
Collect 5 Fungal Spores from mushrooms at the [[Forgotten Pools]].
* [[Fungal Spores]] (5)

==Description==
The oases of the [[Barrens]] hide a mystery. Life energy flows from their waters, invigorating the plants and beasts that drink it.

Invigorating, and altering.

There is a mushroom that grows near the [[Forgotten Pools]] to the northwest. Its spores hold properties that we, the [[apothecary|apothecaries]] of [[Lordaeron]], find useful.

Bring me these spores and you will earn our gratitude.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||11|30}}
*740 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Do you have the spores, <name>? My associates and I are eager to study this phenomenon...

==Completion==
Ah, yes. These are good specimens. Potent.

I am [[Forsaken]], and we honor our contracts. Here is your reward, <name>.

==Notes==
You can find [[Laden Mushroom]]s at the shores of [[Forgotten Pools]], [[Lushwater Oasis]] and [[Stagnant Oasis]] and retrieve the 4 Fungal Spores, which are required to complete this quest. The mobs at Forgotten Pools are of slightly lower level than the mobs at the other two oases.

You may wish to complete this quest along with [[The Forgotten Pools (quest)]] and the [[Centaur Bracers (quest)]].
