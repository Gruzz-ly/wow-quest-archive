==Objectives==
Kill {{NPC||Glomp}} and grab Glomp's Booty.
* [[Glomp's Booty]]

==Description==
What? Leave it to [[Wharfmaster Dizzywig|Dizzywig]] to expect a mutiny on the cheap.

No matter, mon, we can make this work. First we need the money. [[Cap'n Garvey]] likes to hoard the loot we've been earnin', money I can use to pay off my handpicked mutineers.

The treasure pile is just outside the [[barracks]] here. You'll need to take care of Cap'n Garvey's "treasurer" first. Now, Glomp ain't no pushover. Believe me, I tried pushing him over once. He don't budge for nothin'.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got the cash? That money will go a long way to winnin' over the hearts and minds of heartless, thoughtless cutthroats.

==Completion==
Look at that. We're loaded! In mutiny, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Let's go get some power, <name>...

==Progression==
{{Take it up with Tony}}
