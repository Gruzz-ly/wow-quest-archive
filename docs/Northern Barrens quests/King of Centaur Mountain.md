==Objectives==
Keep [[Gorgal Angerscar]] alive as he starts some trouble with the [[centaur]], and help him to slay Kurak.
* Cause Some Trouble
* [[Kurak]] slain

==Description==
We were sent here to track movements of the [[Kolkar]] centaur, but after a week of watching these dirty animals scamper all around this oasis, I'm itching to give my axe a taste of their necks. What do you say, <class>? Want to cause a little havoc with me?

Let's see if we can attract the attention of their strongest warrior, Kurak.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, I suppose that's one way to track down Kurak. What happened up there?

==Completion==
Aw mon, why you have to go settin' Gorgal off like that? Still, I can't argue with results. We'll need to watch these animals closely to see what they do with Kurak outta the way.

More watchin' and waitin'. Gorgal won't like that.
