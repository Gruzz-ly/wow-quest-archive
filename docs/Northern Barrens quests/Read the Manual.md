==Objectives==
Assemble the Samophlange Manual.
*[[Samophlange Manual]]

==Description==
Back when I was in the [[Tinker's Union]], [[Boss Copperplug]] was the best [[engineer]] we had. He defected to the [[Venture Company]] shortly before I left, and took his greatest techniques with him. He hoarded his secrets, doling out bits and pieces of knowledge to his trusted inner circle.

If he built the samophlange, then he's probably got the manual. Last I heard, he was operating right here, out of [[Boulder Lode Mine|Boulder Lode mine]] to the northeast. Get the manual from him, and collect the pages from his followers.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Out-of-Date Manual
|Scrap Metal Shield
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Did you find Copperplug?

==Completion==
You found it! Wow, it's over 600 pages, only 30 of which are intentionally left blank.

Let's see. Chapter three: Backsplicing the Reverse Crankshaft Flywheel Pulley? Interesting. Chapter seven: Valve Timing for the High-Pressure Expansion Condenser!? This stuff is great! And I still don't even know what this thing does.

Here, have some of my old tools. Let's fire this thing up one last time!

==Notes==

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Sputtervalve|Let's get this samophlange operational!}}
:''Sputtervalve runs to the center of camp, places the samophlange in front of him and starts hammering away at it with a wrench. [[Brak Blusterpipe]] runs up to watch.''
:{{text|say|Sputtervalve|All I have to do is resequence the oscillating coolant pressure valves...}}
:{{text|say|Brak Blusterpipe|It's beautiful ...have we figured out what it does yet?}}
:{{text|say|Sputtervalve|No idea. But it's doing it perfectly!}}
:''[[Nozzlepot]] runs up as well.''
:{{text|say|Nozzlepot|Is that a working samophlange? Throttle it up! MAX POWER!}}
:''The samophlange explodes (again), knocking back the three goblins.''
:{{text|say|Nozzlepot|Sputtervalve you're a genius! I'll take 30.}}
:{{text|say|Sputtervalve|Right away, Noz.}}
