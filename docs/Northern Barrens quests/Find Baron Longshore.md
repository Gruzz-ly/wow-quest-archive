==Objectives==
Find and speak to the notorious [[pirate]] [[Baron Longshore]].
* Longshore Located

==Description==
That dirty pirate Baron Longshore was the terror of these waters before the [[Alliance]] demolished his [[fleet]] and rounded up the survivors. Am I happy about it? Do I look like a bundle of joy and good cheer, <name>?

Longshore raided some of my most valuable cargo before his capture. Rumor has it he buried it before he was caught. I want my goods back! Find Longshore in the Alliance camp just south of here and see if you can get him to reveal where my treasure is.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 560 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hah-har! So ol' Gazzy ain't give up on his goods yet, has he? Well, looks like that ol' floppy-eared goldgrubber jes' gave me somethin' ta bargain with.

==Notes==
Baron Longshore is found further down in the camp, along with Southsea Cutthroats in cages nearby.
