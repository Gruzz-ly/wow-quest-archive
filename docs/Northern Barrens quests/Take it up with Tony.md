==Objectives==
Talk to [[Tony Two-Tusk]] on [[Fray Island]] in [[Northern Barrens|North Barrens]].

==Description==
This [[pirate]] situation is really crimping my operation. [[Cap'n Garvey]] is attacking any vessel in sight, even the ones whose owners paid me my bogus "protection" money. We need to get these pirates on the take, and fast!

I know just the guy, one of Garvey's Lieutenants who's open to wheeling and dealing the Dizzywig way. He's offered to arrange a little 'mutiny' for me. Once we get these guys working for us, it's all gravy, see?

Talk to my boy Tony Two-Tusk on Fray Island to the south.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 560 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hey hey mon, did Dizzywig send you? Good, good. Did you bring the money? No? ...what about the guns?
