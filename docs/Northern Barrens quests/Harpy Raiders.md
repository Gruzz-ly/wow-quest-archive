==Objectives==
Collect 6 Witchwing Talons from [[Witchwing]] [[Harpy|harpies]].
*[[Witchwing Talon]] (6)

==Description==
Since you're here, <class>, perhaps you can help me with a small problem. The blasted [[Harpy|harpies]] have been ravaging our [[caravan]] supplies for too long. It's time we slit a few of their throats and diminished their numbers.

The most devastating attack will destroy a good section of their lower chain of command and then we can work our way to the top.

Take out [[Witchwing]] harpies of any kind in the Northwest and bring me 6 Witchwing Talons. That should be a good start...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5|65}}
*740 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
The Witchwing harpies live in the [[Dry Hills]] to the north.

==Completion==
You drop the last Witchwing Talon into your bag. Thanks to you, the lower ranks of the Witchwing harpies will no longer be a problem for [[Darsok Swiftdagger|Darsok's]] caravans.

==Progression==
