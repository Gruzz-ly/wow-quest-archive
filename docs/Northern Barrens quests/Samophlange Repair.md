==Objectives==
Walk the Broken Samophlange over to [[Brak Blusterpipe]] within the encampment.
* [[Broken Samophlange]] (provided)

==Description==
Well that didn't go as expected. I think I busted it.

No need to panic, though. Do me a favor and walk this across the way to Brak here in the camp. He'll bang this sucker back into shape real quick!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you say ... samophlange!?

==Completion==
[[Sputtervalve]] scored us a Samophlange? Lemme see that thing!

Yeah, we can get this working again, no problem. Hand me that huge mallet...

==Notes==

On completion, Brak places the Samophlange in front of him and starts hammering away at it with a wrench.
