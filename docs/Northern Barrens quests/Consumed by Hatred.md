==Objectives==
Collect 30 Quilboar Tusks.
* [[Quilboar Tusk]] (30)

==Description==
They murdered {{npc||Olgra||my wife}}. They burned my homestead. Since that awful night I have traveled these lands, from the sun's rising till its decline, scouring the horizon for more of those monsters. I've killed every [[quilboar|pig man]] I've come across since, but my thirst for their blood is far from quenched.

You, <class> - you could help me.

Kill them. Kill as many as you can. Bring me their tusks, and we will celebrate their deaths together.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mankrik's Old Wedding Garments
|Quilboar Skin Gloves
|Mankrik's Boar Slicer
|Quilboar Linked Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
The quilboar will pay for this, <name>. I swear it.

==Completion==
<Class>, you take my task seriously, and for that I thank you.

Although my desire for revenge remains, I can at least smile seeing that the quilboars have felt pain themselves.

==Progression==
{{Drag it Out of Them}}
