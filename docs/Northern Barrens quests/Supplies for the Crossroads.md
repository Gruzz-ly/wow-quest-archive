==Objectives==
Collect 5 Crossroads Supply Crates from inside the Razormane cave.
* [[Crossroads Supply Crates]]

==Description==
Whatever has happened in [[Southern Barrens]] is causing some of the [[quilboar]] tribes to flee our direction. The displaced [[Razormane tribe|Razormane]] in particular grow desperate, and their attacks grow bolder. I've lost two caravans this week alone!

Our warriors at the [[Crossroads]] desperately need those supplies, and I'm not about to let the quilboar grow fat off of their misdeeds. Find the missing supply crates and bring them to me. I'd search the quilboar hovel south of here, along the river.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
How goes your search for the supplies, <name>? I trust the quilboar fall under your strength easily.

==Completion==
Haha! Thank you, <name>! This will help us greatly. I'll get these supplies packed up and on their way to the Crossroads immediately.

==Progression==
{{Preserving the Barrens}}
