==Objectives==
[[Kadrak]] wants you to bring the Vial of Gorat's Blood to [[Dinah Halfmoon]] at [[Mor'shan Rampart]]s.
*[[Vial of Gorat's Blood]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Horde]] may have never known one more loyal than [[Gorat]]. He never failed to complete a mission, and it would seem that he refuses to allow this to be his first.

Gorat had you deliver this vial for a purpose. Dinah is the daughter of a revered [[shaman]], and is more powerful than she appears. Bring her the vial and hope that we are not too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|25}}
*165 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
What have you there, <race>?

==Completion==
Let's have a look, <class>.

==Notes==
*In {{g|cata}}, the quest rewarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]]. It was changed to Orgrimmar at some point.

==Progression==
