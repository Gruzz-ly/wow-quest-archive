==Objectives==
[[Kadrak]] at [[Mor'shan Rampart]]s wants you to search the [[Fallen Sky Lake]] region for [[Gorat]].

==Description==

The mere mention of his name strikes fear into the hearts of our [[Alliance]] foes.

He is reliable, fiercely loyal, and - until now - punctual.

He should be somewhere in the region of [[Fallen Sky Lake]].

Find him!
