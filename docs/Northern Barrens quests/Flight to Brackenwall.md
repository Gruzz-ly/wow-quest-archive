==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bragok]] in [[Ratchet]] to fly to [[Brackenwall Village]]. Then report to [[Krog]].

==Description==
Listen, I got no special love for the [[Horde]]... but then again, I got no real hate for you guys either.

Your gold is as good as anyone else's.

That [[Gim'hila|two-headed ogre]] and [[Steve (fish)|his pet fish]] left some gold for your travel costs. I believe the person you're looking for in [[Dustwallow Marsh|Dustwallow]] goes by the name of Krog. And the best way to get there is to talk to our [[flight master]], Bragok. He'll fly you there, if you want. The flight's free, thanks to your friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||27|75}}
*260 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with the [[Horde]]

==Completion==
Lok'tar, <race>.  Welcome to Brackenwall.

==Patch changes==
