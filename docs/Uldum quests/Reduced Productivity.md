==Objectives==
Kill 15 {{NPC||Schnottz Excavator}}s or {{NPC||Schnottz Overseer}}s.
*Schnottz Employees Killed at Obelisk of the Moon

==Description==
Alright, <name>, here's what I've learned.

There's a [[titan]] device deep in a place called the [[Halls of Origination]]. It's meant to be an emergency reset switch for all life on [[Azeroth]]. If activated, it will destroy every living thing in the world!

Now, it's only meant to be used under certain extreme conditions, but if {{NPC||Deathwing}} is able to corrupt the titan watchers, he could use the contents of the coffer to trigger the device.

Go to the [[Obelisk of the Moon]], <name>. Slow them down!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{coppercost|104600}} at max level)

==Progress==
How'd it go out there, <name>?

==Completion==
Good job with Schnottz's men.

Sounds like you gave them something to think about.

Hopefully it bought us the time we need.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Missing Pieces]] before heading out.

Up and over the ridge down to the [[Obelisk of the Moon]]. Kill all the Schnottz employees, but steer clear of {{NPC||Myzerian}}, a level 85 elite with 387,000 health buffed with Ward of the Worldbreaker, which regenerates 50,000 health every 5 sec.

Pillaged Loot Sacks litter the ground, which contain the scrolls.

After collecting the scrolls and killing the Schnottz employees, a cutscene triggers automatically:
:''The player is seen running back around the ruins to the northeast heading back in the direction of the oasis. The camera pans back to the obelisk area, which is littered with the corpses of employees. An overseer walks out and sees the spilled blood.''
:{{text|yell|Schnottz Overseer|Warning! Warning! Intruder alert! Intruder alert!}}
:''A squadron of Schnottz Elites pour out of the building as the camera pans over to Myzerian, as he shifts to his dragon form and takes to the air.''
Players automatically wind up back in front of Harrison upon the conclusion of the cutscene.

==Progression==
{{Vir'sar and beyond}}
