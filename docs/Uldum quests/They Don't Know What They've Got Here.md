== Objectives ==
Create the Titan Activation Device.
*[[Titan Activation Device]]

== Description ==
Listen, <name>. I don't have a lot of time to talk here.

These guys are excavating relics from this site and taking pieces of ancient technology that we need!

I need you to check their crates for pieces of an ancient activation device. The officers should have the codes you'll need to open them.

Hurry!

We can't let them load this stuff into their planes!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Have you got the titan activation device, <name>?

== Completion ==
That's it!

Good work, <name>!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[I've Got This Guy]] before heading out. Note that the targets are {{NPC||Schnottz Air Officer}}s, not troopers! The Officers have [[Uldum Chest Key Code]]s on them, which are required to open the chests. The chests contain [[Titan Device Component]]s, of which six are required to form the Titan Activation Device.

Also, one of the officers has [[Efficient Excavations]], which starts [[Efficient Excavations]].
