==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Harrison Jones}} at [[Pilgrim's Precipice]].

==Description==
Jonesy tells me you two need to make it up that mountain.

Well, you're not going far with those troopers crawling all over it like ants on a carcass.

Some of my friends were able to confiscate a bit of the enemy's hardware. It should make your journey a bit easier.

Make your way up the ridgeline to the north, and you'll find it waiting for you.

Good luck, you two!

==Completion==
Glad you could make it, <name>!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|See you there, <name>!}}
:''Harrison takes off running.''

Hop on a flying mount and head the same direction, pretty much due north. Head east of the rise to Pilgrim's Precipice, up a sheer cliff from the ground level. Harrison can be found inside one of the three pieces of {{NPC||Confiscated Artillery}}.

==Progression==
{{Temple of Uldum}}
