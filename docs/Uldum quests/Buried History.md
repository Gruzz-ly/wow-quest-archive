==Objectives==
Uncover and collect 6 Amathet Artifacts in Uldum.
* [[Amathet Artifact]] (6)

==Description==
Since the [[Amathet]] came from this region, it would only stand to reason that artifacts form their civilization would be left behind here, hidden beneath the sands.

It looks like it's time for a good old-fashioned dig!

The dunes near here must have covered up a large swath of the Amathet's former territory. Lets' see what we can dig up there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have ye turned up?

==Completion==
Yes! The markings on these artifacts confirm my hypothesis.

There's definitely more to this than we first thought.

==Notes==
Take both quests. Go looking for piles of [[Sand]] in the quest zone and excavate them until the artifact is uncovered so you can pick it up. Often there will be hyenas by the sand.
