== Objectives ==
Go to the [[Neferset Prison Camp]] and find the whereabouts of {{NPC||Tahet}}.
*Tahet's Whereabouts

== Description ==
Hieroglyphs depicting a chained [[tol'vir]] mark the southeastern corner of the map.

Perhaps Tahet was brought there when he was imprisoned.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Completion ==
If the prisoner's information is true, Tahet is in great danger.

== Notes ==
Head southeast, crossing all the way over the Lost City of the Tol'vir to the eastern end of the delta. There, at {{co|71.3|73.7|Uldum}} is the prison and the {{NPC||Ramkahen Prisoner}}. Talk to him.
:Are you with the Neferset scum? Did they send you to do their dirty work? Speak!
{{gossip|''I'm looking for Tahet. Let's get you out of these chains.''}}
:{{text|yell|Ramkahen Prisoner|Wait! Here come the Neferset guards! Fight near me so I can beat their skulls in!}}
A few Neferset Enforcers followed by the Neferset Overlord, a level 83 elite with ~161,000 health, spawn. Kill them all near the prisoner.

Upon the overlord's death:
:{{text|emote|Ramkahen Prisoner picks up a key from Neferset Enforcer.}}
:{{text|say|Ramkahen Prisoner|Freedom at last. I thank you, stranger. Tahet is no longer here. A cruel Neferset warlord called {{NPC||Caimas}} took him.}}
:{{text|say|Ramkahen Prisoner|I must warn you. Caimas does horrible things to prisoners... he forces them to fight his pet beasts. Prepare for the worst, friend.}}

The quest completes automatically at this point.
