:''Harrison and the player run away from the arena toward the southwest. After a fade to black, the two are at the southwestern end of the [[Ruins of Khintaset]]. A translucent yellow hemispherical shield sits in the middle of the area, but Harrison and the player run past it to the controls at the west end of the area overlooking the [[Oasis of Vir'sar]], far below.''

:I been expectin' ye fer days now.
:Leavin' an ol' dwarf ta swelter... I trained Junior better than that.

== Trivia ==
Almost everything regarding this quest, (including the title), is a reference to the "Indiana Jones" movies. The quest itself is a reference to the famous ending scene where the Nazi's opens the Ark and gets killed by ghosts in a similar way the dragons and [[Commander Schnottz|"The Furrier"]] dies in.
