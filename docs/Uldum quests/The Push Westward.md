== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||King Phaoris}} at the [[Neferset City Outskirts]] in [[Uldum]].

== Description ==
Our work here is done, <name>. Against all odds, we stopped the [[Neferset]] advance on [[Nahom]].

Let us join the forces pushing west, lest they take all the glory for themselves.

They must've reached the outskirts of [[Neferset City]] by now.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|50}}

== Completion ==
You've arrived just in time, <name>.

== Notes ==
Fly west, crossing the [[Vir'naal River|Vir'naal]] heading just to the southwest of where Salhet's lions were. Just north of Neferset City is its outskirts, where King Pharois and his forces are launching an attack on the immortal colossi and neferset champions guarding the city.

==Progression==
{{Down with Neferset City}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
