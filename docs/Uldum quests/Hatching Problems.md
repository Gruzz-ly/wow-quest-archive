==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Aqir Egg Clusters in [[Uldum]].
*[[Aqir Egg Cluster]] destroyed (6)

==Description==
The [[aqir]] are multiplying faster than we can put them down. If this pace continues, we will be outnumbered before long.

The only way to slow down their assault is to attack their hives directly and destroy their [[egg]]s, but we have been unsuccessful in doing so.

That's why I wish to conscript your services.

Will you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Uldum Accord]]
*325 [[Coalescing Visions]]
*413 [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
Many [[Wastewander]]s have died attempting this task. Do not let their lives be lost in vain.

==Completion==
Destroying those eggs should buy us the time we need to regroup before they can throw another wave at us.

Your may{{sic}} just mean the difference between victory and defeat.

==Patch changes==
