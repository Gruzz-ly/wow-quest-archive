== Objectives ==
Slay Scorpion-Lord Namkhare and High Priest Sekhemet.
*[[Scorpion-Lord Namkhare]] slain
*[[High Priest Sekhemet]] slain

== Description ==
The armies of [[Ramkahen tribe|Ramkahen]] are getting obliterated by [[Neferset tribe|Neferset]]'s immortal guardians.

The only way to defeat them is to slay the Dark Pharaoh of Neferset.

Before we make our move, however, we're going to need to take care of his lieutenants.

Go behind the battle-lines and slay Scorpion Lord Namkhare and High Priest Sekhemet. Only then will we be ready to confront the Dark Pharaoh himself.

You've returned, <name>.

== Completion ==
You are a valuable ally, <name>.  We are one step closer to defeating the enemy.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Bleeding the Enemy]] and [[Salhet's Gambit]] before heading out. Fly past the battlefront into the city proper. Then start killing tol'vir. The two named tol'vir are up on high ledges. The High priest is to the northwest on the high ledge by glowing obelisk. The scorpion-lord is at the southernmost point of the high ledge. They are both level 85s. Makhare with 116,000 health, Sekhemet with 154,000.
