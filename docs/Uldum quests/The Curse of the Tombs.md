== Description ==
The [[Neferset]] are not the only threat to our sacred tombs.

A [[Cursed expedition|gnomish expedition]] stumbled upon our lands a few weeks ago.

They did not heed our warnings and dug too deep within a cursed vault.

Their entire expedition is now afflicted by a terrible curse that has robbed them of their sanity and taken control of their minds.

They now seek access to the deepest vaults of [[Uldum]] and pose a great threat.

Go to the [[Sunstone Terrace]] and put their wretched souls out of their misery.

== Progress ==
Is it done, <name>? The expedition members cannot be saved.

== Completion ==
They couldn't be saved, <name>.  The ancient curse that fell upon them is irrevocable.

== Notes ==
Tumet offers this side chain after [[The Defense of Nahom]]. Head immediately south of the pyramid to reach the [[Sunstone Terrace]], which is littered with [[Crazed Diggers]]. Go killing. The Diggers will drop the [[A.I.D.A. Communicator]], which starts [[Artificial Intelligence]].
