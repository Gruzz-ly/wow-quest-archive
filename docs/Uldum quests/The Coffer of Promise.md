==Objectives==
Give {{NPC||Brann Bronzebeard}} the contents of the [[Coffer of Promise]].
*[[Titan Discs]]

==Description==
I'm not quite certain what ta expect 'ere, so stay on yer toes, eh?

These codes should reveal the coffer's true purpose, and present us with the tools to thwart {{NPC||Deathwing||Deathwing's}} efforts in [[Uldum]] fer good!

Stand back!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{coppercost|104600}} at max level)

==Progress==
Well, now. 

Would ya look at that!?

==Completion==
Of course! I had a hunch this is what we'd find.

Had no idea about the organic transformations, though. I must admit.

There's more to this old relic than I'd dared to hope.

==Notes==

Brann walks over to the coffer and starts interacting with it. Suddenly, the door to the north starts eye-beaming the coffer! The camera pulls in to the eye beams, then pulls back, revealing an amazing regrowth! Water is flowing and the cradle is alive!

Interact with the coffer to loot the Titan Discs and hand them to Brann.

This concludes the non-instanced portion of the Harrison Jones storyline in [[Uldum]]. Brann continues the chain with [[The Heart of the Matter (Uldum)|The Heart of the Matter]], leading players inside the [[Halls of Origination]].
