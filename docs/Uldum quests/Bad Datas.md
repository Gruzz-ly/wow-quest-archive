==Objectives==
Accompany {{NPC||Harrison Jones}} in the [[Chamber of the Moon (Uldum)|Chamber of the Moon]].

==Description==
There should be two titan communication devices in this chamber.

If my translations are correct, one is a death trap and the other will accept the codes and activate the obelisk.

Let's hope I get this right.

Let me know when you're ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|21500}} (or {{coppercost|26200}} at max level)

==Completion==
Okay, <name>.

I think I can do this manually, but I'll need your help.

==Notes==
Talk to the Doctor again:
:Let's keep moving. There's a lot at stake here.

:{{gossip|Ready when you are, Doctor Jones!}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|My gut's telling me....}}
:''Harrison runs to the center of the hallway, glacing at either path.''
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|...this way!}}
:''Harrison chooses the southern device and runs to it.''
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|This should just take a moment.}}
:''Harrison interacts with the device, then walks a few yards away.''
:{{text|say|[[Tho'kesh]]|Codes accepted. Activating mechanism.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|Well, that went smoothly for a change.}}
:{{text|say|Tho'kesh|System failure. Internal data corruption detected. Constructing defense mechanism.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|Too good to be true. I might have known.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|Looks like we do this the hard way. Let's go!}}
:''Harrison exits the southern area, player in tow, and runs to the eastern end of the chamber.''
