==Objectives==
Board the [[Confiscated Artillery]] and use it to kill 100 Schnottz Infantrymen.
* Infantrymen Slain x100

==Description==
The remnants of {{NPC||Commander Schnottz||Schnottz's}} organization persist here on the [[Maker's Ascent]], making the region deadly to any who draw near.

There's plenty of ammunition, but without a good spotter, I'm just firing blind.

Hop in and give me a hand here. Those soldiers won't know what hit them!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{coppercost|104600}} at max level)

==Progress==
It's a target-rich environment, <class>.

==Completion==
The enemy on Maker's Ascent remain a threat, but with your help we've dealt a serious blow to their numbers and their morale. 

==Notes==
This quest opens up after players leave the [[Pilgrim's Precipice]] after completing the quests there during the climax of the {{NPC||Harrison Jones}} story in [[Uldum]].

When first implemented this quest gave no reputation rewards, but now gives 250 points for {{neutral}}[[Ramkahen (faction)|Ramkahen]].

This quest can give the achievement [[Help the Bombardier! I'm the Bombardier!]].

==Progression==
{{Temple of Uldum}}
