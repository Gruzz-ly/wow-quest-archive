==Objectives==
Kill 3 rare minions of N'Zoth in [[Uldum]].
*Rare [[N'Zoth]] minions defeated

==Description==
Our lands have been infested by the minions of the [[Old God]]s. They strike at every front, even assailing the very minds of our [[soldier]]s.

Our forces cannot handle this for long. We must strike a decisive blow to try to salvage some of their morale.

Find the biggest, slimiest, tentacle-faced monstrosities that you can and bring them down. My men will rally to your example.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We could really use a victory about now.

==Completion==
My men will look to your victories this day to bolster their spirits. 

Ramkahen owes you a debt, <class>.
