== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||High Commander Kamses}} at the [[Ramkahen Legion Outpost]] in [[Uldum]].

== Description ==
If we're to pass a resolution for war, the high council's vote needs to be unanimous.

I'm certain High Commander Kamses will give us his vote once he hears what happened at [[Orsis]].

Please speak to him in Ramkahen and make sure that's the case. I must make preparations in case our plan fails.

== Completion ==
No need to fill me in on the events in Orsis, <name>.

I've heard about them already. And you. Any enemy of {{NPC||Al'Akir}} is a friend of mine.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The High Priest's Vote]] and [[The Vizier's Vote]] before heading out.

==Progression==
