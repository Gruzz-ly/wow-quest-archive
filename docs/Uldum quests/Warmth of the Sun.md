==Objectives==
Collect an [[Amathet]] Solar Collector in [[Uldum]].
* [[Solar Emanator]]

==Description==
The desert nights in Uldum can get awfully cold. I fear for our little egg's ability to withstand these temperatures.

These Amathet to the East seem to have mastered the harnessing of the [[sun]]'s energy. If we could borrow some of their expertise, we could use it to keep the egg nice and cozy.

Keep your eyes open for something we can use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +900 reputation with [[Voidtouched Egg]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything among the Amathet?

==Completion==
You've found a solar collection device? Perfect!

Now our egg will be nice and toasty through the chilly nights.

==Notes==
Travel to the [[Obelisk of the Stars]] and fly down a shaft to reach the inner [[Chamber of the Stars]]. The solar emanator will be found there.
