==Objectives==
Use H'partho's Whistle to summon your [[Shadowbarb Hatchling|Aqir Hatchling]] and battle enemies in [[Uldum]] or [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]]. Fighting tougher and rarer enemies will help your hatchling grow faster.
*H'partho's Whistle used 
*Hatchling trained
*[[H'partho's Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
In observing the aqir battling the [[Wastewander]]s, I have seen the newly hatched immediately join the [[aqir]]i assault. It would seem the need for combat is born into these creatures.

We should exercise this in our new hatchling, under your supervision of course. Take him out with you and show him how to fight our enemies.

He may not be able to fight for long, so don't call him until you're ready for training.

With luck, he will come to see us as part of his hive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Take care of your hatchling. He will return here if he becomes too injured.

==Completion==
That must have been an exciting day for our little hatchling.

He'll need to rest up for now, but we can try again tomorrow!

==Notes==
Using the whistle will prompt a warning window and you'll be given 30 seconds to decide if you're ready. The whistle will be consumed afterwards if you chose "yes" and you'll be given a 10 minute buff. Should you or the hatchling die, you'll not be given another chance to obtain more XP for the hatchling. The quest auto-completes the objectives and it cannot be abandoned.

You can also lose the buff prematurely through the following:
* Doing the Consuming Maw event
* Teleporting
