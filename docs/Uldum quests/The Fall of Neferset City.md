== Objectives ==
Slay Dark Pharaoh Tekahn at [[Neferset City]] in [[Uldum]].
*[[Dark Pharaoh Tekahn]] slain

== Description ==
We are ready to strike now, <name>.

If we take down Dark Pharaoh Tekahn, the immortal colossi will fall and our armies will be able to march into Neferset City.

Seek him out and engage him without fear. I will make sure you're not alone when it's time to bring him down.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Wrap of the Fallen City|Fallen Brotherhood Gauntlets|Drape of Neferset Destruction|Necklace of the Dead City}}
You will receive: {{cost|27}}

== Progress ==
It is good to see you again, friend.

== Completion ==
It is done. We have defeated the Neferset inside their own city.

I wish I could say that there is peace for my people at last, but I only foresee more bloodshed.

== Notes ==
Fly back in to the city. At the entrance of the eastern pyramid at {{co|51.9|82.3|Uldum}} is Tekahn, a level 85 elite with 387,000 health. He is flanked by two (initially inactive) colossi. Attack him and the king will join in as the colossi activate. All kinds of actions start happening... the colossi will launch fireballs at the ground, Tekahn will cast some kind of shadow damage, and so on. Keep moving!
On Tekahn's death, a quick cutscene:
:''The camera looks over the attacking Ramkahen forces as the immortal colossi fall to the ground.''
:{{text|yell|High Commander Kamses|The Dark Pharaoh has fallen! His immortal colossi tumble like toys!}}
:{{text|yell|High Commander Kamses|Neferset City will fall! ATTACK!!!}}
Fly back to Ramkahen.

==Progression==
{{Down with Neferset City}}
