==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Harrison Jones}} at the [[Temple of Uldum]].

==Description==
Och!

You an' junior took yer sweet time gettin' 'ere, din't ya!?

<Drinkin' ale/Holdin' hands>, takin' in the sights, I'll wager.

Don't go breakin' yer arm pattin' yerself on the back now, the real work's just beginnin'!

There be more ta this ancient artifact than ye know, but in order ta reveal its secrets, we need ta get it to the [[Cradle of the Ancients]]!

Now howdya spose we do that?

Maybe junior over there has some bright ideas, eh?

==Completion==
Of course I have a plan for moving the coffer.

Someday, maybe the {{NPC||Brann Bronzebeard||old coot}} will learn to trust me.

==Trivia==
The way how Brann calls Harrison Jones reminded of the way how Doctor Henry Jones calls his son Indy in the movie [[wikipedia:Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]
