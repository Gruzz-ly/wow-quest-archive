== Objectives ==
Recruit 8 Ramkahen Laborers.

== Description ==
We have a sizable army, but I'm afraid the coming showdown with the [[Neferset]] hordes will demand that all able-bodied [[tol'vir]] of [[Ramkahen tribe|Ramkahen]] and [[Orsis tribe|Orsis]] join in the fight.

I want you to be the forefront of our recruiting efforts.

Go across the river, to the [[Akhenet Fields]], and recruit the laborers that work there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
You've returned, <name>. How are the recruitment efforts faring?

== Completion ==
You are a born leader, <name>. It'll be good to have you by our side when war comes to these lands.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Element of Supplies]] before heading out. Fly across the river to Akhenet and look for the laborers in the fields.
*If the rumors about you are true, stranger, I will gladly join you in the fight against the Neferset!
*The <race> that rescued Prince Nadun is the only <race> that I'll ever take orders from.
*I heard of what you did in Orsis. I will be honored to fight along your side.
*I will defend Ramkahen with my bare hands if I have to!
*It's about time we started doing something.
*We will defend our lands!
