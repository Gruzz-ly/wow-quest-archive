==Objectives==
Collect the Sun King's Decree from Suntouched [[Amathet]] in [[Uldum]].
* [[Sun King's Decree]]

==Description==
If anyone would know more about the "corruption" the tablet spoke of, it would be the Suntouched that were put in charge of rooting it out.

Of course, I doubt they'll be willing to turn over any information voluntarily.

Luckily for me, you're a bit of a specialist at brute force investigation, aren't you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Found anything from the Suntouched?

==Completion==
So the Amathet aren't working with [[N'Zoth]] after all! That's a relief!

Of course, that doesn't make them any less hostile to us, but it's a start!

==Notes==
This can drop from [[Suntouched Acolyte]]s, [[Amathet Suntouched]], [[Suntouched Ritualist]]s, [[Acolyte Taspu]], and [[Muminah the Incandescent]], but the Acolytes are non-elites, so you'll be able to search them faster.

==Progression==
