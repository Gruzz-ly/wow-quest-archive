==Objectives==
Defeat Retinus the Seeker in a [[pet battle]] with your [[Shadowbarb Hatchling]] in your party.
*[[Retinus the Seeker]] defeated

==Description==
While fighting alongside you no doubt provides excellent training for our hatchling, sometimes it is better to have him fight on his own against enemies his own size.

I know of one such opponent nearby, observing the [[Amathet]] near the [[Obelisk of the Stars]]. You should seek it out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +900 reputation with [[Aqir Hatchling]]

==Progress==
How did our little hatchling do?

==Completion==
I bet that was quite an exhilarating battle!

We should try to get some more training in tomorrow.
