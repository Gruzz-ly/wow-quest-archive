==Objectives==
Catch 5 Docile Sandstone Hatchlings in [[Uldum]].
* [[Docile Sandstone Hatchling]] caught (5)

==Description==
Is it just me or does our little friend look lonely? It would make sense that [[aqir]] are social creatures, coming from a hive and all. It must be difficult for him not being around any of his kind.

You know, maybe you could find some friends for him. Nothing big and scary, of course, but perhaps some of the smaller [[scarab]]s could be safe enough to keep him company.

What do you think?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +900 reputation with [[Shadowbarb Larva]]

==Progress==
He really does look like he could use some company.

==Completion==
Look, they're playing! At least, I think that's what it is.

Anyway, having some friends should go a long way to keeping our larva healthy and happy. Well done!

==Notes==
Friendly [[Sandstone Hatchling]]s can be found outdoors at the [[Temple of Uldum]] complex.

;Quest completion
:''The larva runs around the pen, then does a twirl-jump.''
