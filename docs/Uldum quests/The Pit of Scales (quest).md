<Name>?

== Completion ==
I thank you for what you've done, <name>. You can count on my vote when High Council convenes.

== Notes ==
Fly west across the mouth of the delta to reach the Pit of Scales at the other end of the delta. There, at {{co|58.3|82.8|Uldum}} is Tahet, in bad shape.  Talk to him.

:''You release Tahet from his ropes, but he immediately falls to the ground.  [[Caimas the Pit Master]] appears on the ledge above you and Tahet.''
:{{text|yell|Caimas the Pit Master|I'm afraid your friend won't be waking up any time soon.  I always sedate my croc's food.  I hate to see them struggle with their meal.}}
:{{text|yell|Caimas the Pit Master|But perhaps I will make an exception for you.  Let the crocs out!  IT'S FEEDING TIME!}}
:''A croc named [[Gorebite]] spawns and enters the pit from the east.  Once killed or tamed by a [[hunter]]:''
:{{text|yell|Caimas the Pit Master|Bah!  Mere luck!  My pets will make mincemeat out of you yet!}}
:''Two more crocs spawn behind Caimas, named [[Khamen]] and [[Thartep]], and both rush down into the pit.  Once both are dead:''
:{{text|yell|Caimas the Pit Master|Enough! I grow tired of you!}}
:''Caimas leaps down to the middle of the pit and attacks you.''

Caimas is a level 83 elite with 644,000 health. This is a fight based primarily on kiting. Have him run over Croc Eggs to slow him down and deal some damage over time. Keep running him over croc eggs as the "Tiny Teeth!" debuff does not last forever... Caimas has no other moves outside of basic melee, which hits for ~4-4.5k on plate, upwards of 6k on cloth.

When he is eventually killed, Tahet wakes up:
:{{text|say|Tahet|I... *cough* I owe you my life, stranger.  Thank you.}}
Objective complete, fly back up to the [[Akhenet Fields]] to speak with the vizier.

This concludes the vizier' portion of the fork. Complete the High Priest's and the High Commander's quest chains as well to be offered the conclusion, [[The High Council's Decision]].

HUNTER NOTE: Gorebite is one of only two known [[crocolisk]]s of that color, the other being [[Lockmaw]], and the only one that can be tamed.
