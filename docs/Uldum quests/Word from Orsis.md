==Objectives==
Investigate the situation in Orsis.
* [[Orsis]] investigated
* [[Discarded Bottle]] collected
* [[Laborer Mitchell]] revived
* Talk to Laborer Mitchell

==Description==
As you can see, <name>, we have our hands full here dealing with these disgusting bugs.

Our [[caravan]]s from the south have stopped arriving and we have received disturbing news from the few who've made it back recently.

I've sent a patrol toward Orsis to investigate; they are past due for a report back.

Can I ask you to check in on them for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Completion==
If the sun didn't take me, the bugs surely would have. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==

:{{Text|Say|Arik Scorpidsting|Something tells me that this attack serves as a distraction from a much larger threat.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arik Scorpidsting|Regardless, I suspect our caravans will be in need of aid. Please provide them with any assistance that you can.}}

:{{Text|say|Laborer Mitchell|I thought I was going to die out here...}}

They... I think they're all... dead.

{{Gossip|What happened here?}}

It all happened so quickly, the bugs came out of nowhere, swarmed us faster than we could understand what was happening.

It was a... massacre.

{{Gossip|This is troubling news.}}
