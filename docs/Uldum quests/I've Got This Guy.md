== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Schnottz Air Troopers.
*[[Schnottz Air Trooper]] slain x10

== Description ==
Good timing, <name>.

Seems I'm not the only one interested in these obelisks, and these fellas aren't inclined to compare notes...

I think I can handle {{NPC||Burly Sea Trooper||this guy}}.

Maybe you could take care of a few of his friends before they make their way over here?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
This guy's tougher than he looks - and he looks tough!

== Completion ==
That's a relief. Thanks, <name>.

Turns out I've got my hands full here.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[They Don't Know What They've Got Here]] before heading out. While killing troopers and officers, [[Efficient Excavations]] will drop from an officer. It starts [[Efficient Excavations]].

==Progression==
{{Obelisk of the Sun}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
