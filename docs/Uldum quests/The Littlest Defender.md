==Objectives==
Defeat the Baruk Stone Defender in a [[pet battle]] with your [[Shadowbarb Hatchling]] in your party.

*[[Baruk Stone Defender]] defeated

==Description==
The [[Baruk clan|Baruk]] [[mogu]] are known for animating ancient statues to serve as defenders of their territory. They are a resilient foe, and much can be learned from battling an enemy with such rigid defenses.

Fortunately, it seems like one of their Stoneshapers mistakenly animated a small idol. It has been discarded as useless to the mogu who made it, but it could prove a valuable training opportunity for our hatchling.

Find this miniature defender in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +900 reputation with [[Shadowbarb Hatchling]]

==Progress==
Did you find the stone defender?

==Completion==
I knew our little hatchling could hand the mogu creation!

His prowess grows with each passing day!

==Notes==
Baruk Stone Defender is located at the [[Ruins of Guo-Lai]].{{co|28.5|34.9|Vale of Eternal Blossoms}}

Your [[Shadowbarb Hatchling (battle pet)]] does not need to survive in order to receive credit.
