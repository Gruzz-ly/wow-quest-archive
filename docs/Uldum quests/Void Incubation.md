==Objectives==
Collect 10 Crystallized Void in areas under assault by [[N'Zoth]]'s forces.
* [[Crystallized Void]] (10)

==Description==
Well one thing is for certain with this egg, it requires great amounts of [[void]] energy in order to strive.

It is fortunate for us that an [[Old God]] is attacking [[Azeroth]] at this very moment, yes?

No? Oh...

In any case, there should be an abundance of void energy wherever N'Zoth's minions strike. You should head out and find some.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +300 reputation with [[Voidtouched Egg]]

==Progress==
Have you found a reliable source of void energy?

==Completion==
Brilliant! The void energy emanating off these crystals will be perfect to incubate the egg.

Don't worry, I'm sure there won't be any side effects from carrying those around.

==Notes==
Within a N'Zoth assault on [[Uldum]] ''or'' [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]], look for areas that are particularly infested by void tentacles.
