==Objectives==
Kill 6 [[Wastewander]] Hosts.
* [[Fire Bomb (Uldum)|Fire Bombs]] collected (Optional)
* [[Wastewander Host]] slain (6)

==Description==
The bugs have been laying [[egg]]s in the corpses of our [[soldier]]s, it's absolutely terrifying!

Some of them are rising from the ground as putrid, bloated, hideous monstrosities.

We have to stop them before they continue to bolster their ranks with our fallen.

It's not a pleasant task... but I have to ask you to help me destroy them. Completely.

Grab some [[bomb]]s behind me, if you'd like.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
Destroy every last one of those horrible corpses!

==Completion==
Blech. I can clearly see that you killed them all, thank you for bringing back that truly awful smell.
