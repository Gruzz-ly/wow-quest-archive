==Objectives==
Collect 8 Coalesced Corruption from [[Ooze|slimes]] in [[Uldum]].
* [[Coalesced Corruption]] (8)

==Description==
My clairvoyance provides a great strategic asset to the people of [[Ramkahen]]. However, the potency of my visions of late has proven taxing to my health.

I have devised a tonic that may serve to dull the harm these visions cause, but it will require the coalesced essence of the [[Old God]]s' corruption.

If you could retrieve some samples of this for me, it could prove invaluable in our efforts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you acquired the reagent?

==Completion==
You've returned with the samples? Excellent.

Let us hope this has the intended effect.

==Patch changes==
