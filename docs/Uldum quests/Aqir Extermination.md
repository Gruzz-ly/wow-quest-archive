==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Aqir]] Impalers.
* [[Aqir Impaler]] slain (10)

==Description==
There are too many of these things flyin' around for us to make a clean getaway.

We're liable to get swarmed the second we start up them plane engines!

These bugs are going straight back into the ground... one way or another. May as well expedite the process, know what I mean?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
You manage to clean up some of them bugs?

==Completion==
That should help keep the runway clear for a bit!

==Notes==

==Progression==
