==Objectives==
Collect 12 pieces of Corrupted Flesh from creatures in areas under assault by [[N'Zoth]]'s minions.
*[[Corrupted Flesh]] (12)
* Larva Fed

==Description==
You know, it occurred to me that since this creature has been imbued with [[void]] energy, it may prefer a more... corrupted food source.

I speak, of course, of the Minions of N'Zoth.

It's a long shot, but it's worth a try.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +300 reputation with [[Shadowbarb Larva]]

==Progress==
Who knew [[aqir]] would be such picky eaters?

==Completion==
Well done! Our little guy cleaned his plate!

It's a good thing, too. I was not looking forward to asking [[King Phaoris|Phaoris]] for fresh [[tol'vir]] corpses.

==Notes==
The meat can be dropped by any [[Old Gods' forces|Old God]]-related creatures, such as [[n'raqi]] and [[fleshbeast]]s.

;Place meat
:{{Text|say|[[H'partho Ardoros]]|Here comes din din!}}
:''The larva approaches the meat and takes a bite. It proceeds to take another.''
:{{Text|say|H'partho Ardoros|He likes it! Just look at that appetite!}}
:''The larva wolfs down the rest of the meat before doing a twirl-jump in the air to indicate its satisfaction.''
