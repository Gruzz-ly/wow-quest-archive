== Objectives ==
Escort the Ramkahen Ranger captain to higher ground.
*Higher ground secured

== Description ==
[[Neferset City]] is too well defended. [[Mount Akher|The mountain]] next to it, however, is not.

I've spoken to the ranger captain and he's willing to take a handful of his men and secure the strategic mountaintop.

There is one catch, <name>. He agreed, but only if you would spearhead the attack with them.

It must be a small group, else we'll draw the enemy's attention too soon, but trust me... the rangers of Ramkahen are as tough as they come. With you by their side we'll surely succeed.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Hail, <name>!

== Completion ==
You did it, <name>! Excellent!

== Notes ==
Fly around the battlefront to the southeast to find the ranger captain and a few rangers at {{co|54.0|71.2|Uldum}} at the base of the mountain path. The group will sprint up the mountain after talking to the captain, so start at full health! There are three scripted spawns—two halfway up and one at {{co|53.8|75.5|Uldum}} on the peak. After clearing the path, head back to the battlefront. Then talk to Phaoris again for [[The Fall of Neferset City]].

==Progression==
{{Down with Neferset City}}
