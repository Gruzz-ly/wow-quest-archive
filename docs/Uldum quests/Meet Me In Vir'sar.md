==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Harrison Jones}} at the [[Oasis of Vir'sar]].

==Description==
So, listen to this, <name>.

I knew that these obelisks were linked to the [[Coffer of Promise]], but there's more to it.

There appears to be something very important about the coffer - something pertaining to a place the Makers called the [[Halls of Origination]].

Now that we know this {{NPC||Commander Schnottz||Schnottz fellow}} and his crew are in league with {{NPC||Deathwing}}, it's all the more urgent that we get to it first.

I'll wait for you north of here, at the Oasis of Vir'sar

Hurry! They have a head start on us!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|8600}} (+{{coppercost|16500}} at max level)

==Completion==
Ahh, glad you could make it.

I could use a hand here. 

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|See ya around, kid.}}
:''Harrison runs off to the north.''

Head north along the ridge comprising the border with [[Ahn'Qiraj: The Fallen Kingdom]] to the northwest corner of the zone. Pick up the flight path!

==Progression==
{{Vir'sar and beyond}}
