== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Vizier Tanotep]] at the [[Akhenet Fields]] in [[Uldum]].

== Description ==
Getting Vizier Tanotep to go against my brother's wishes is going to be extremely difficult. His very position is based on enforcing the will of [[King Phaoris|Phaoris]].

I've had little luck making the case for open war against [[Neferset]].

Nevertheless you must speak to him. Perhaps he will listen to an outsider's perspective.

You will find the Vizier at the Akhenet Fields on official business.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|50}}

== Completion ==
What manner of creature are you?  You will leave the king's lands before...

Wait!  You are that <name> I've heard so much about.

You must pardon my lack of hospitality.  We have seen all manner of hostile intruders since the barrier around Uldum failed.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The High Priest's Vote]] and [[The High Commander's Vote]] before heading out. Fly down the Vir'naal to Akhenet Fields, on the west side of the river.
