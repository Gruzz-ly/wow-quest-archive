==Objectives==
Free 6 Ramkahen Citizens from [[Torment Cell]]s within the [[Lost City of Tol'vir]] in [[Uldum]].
* [[Ramkahen Citizen (Assaults)|Ramkahen Citizen]] freed (6)

==Description==
Our [[Commoner|citizens]] here in [[Ramkahen]] have managed to escape the brunt of [[N'Zoth]]'s assault.

Our brothers in the Lost City were not so fortunate. Those not immediately slain have been held captive only to be tortured by N'Zoth's minions.

I know that you will be taking the fight to N'Zoth's forces. If you can free our allies as well, Ramkahen will be in your debt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

You will also receive one from:
{{itembox||q1=403|Azerite
|q2=250|Coalescing Visions
|q3=60|War Resources
}}

*[[Glowing Azerite Geode]]

==Progress==
Were there any survivors?

==Completion==
Our citizens owe you a debt they may never be able to repay, <name>.

Ramkahen thanks you for this service.
