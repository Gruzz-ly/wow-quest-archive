==Objectives==
Collect 6 Fuel Canisters.
* [[Fuel Canister]] (6)

==Description==
So, I was checkin' all these planes... and you are never gonna believe this, but none of them have any fuel in the tanks!

Saw a few canisters scattered around nearby, surely some a' them have some gas left.

Was gonna collect 'em myself, but these damned [[Aqir|bugs]] came outta nowhere and started swarmin' the place.

Too many here now to deal with on my own, think you'd be able to lend a hand?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
Yo, you got them fuel cans yet?

==Completion==
Well hot damn, you did great finding all of these!

==Notes==
