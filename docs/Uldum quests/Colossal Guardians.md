== Objectives ==
Obtain the Stone of the Moon and the Stone of the Sun from the Colossal Guardians.
*[[Stone of the Moon]]
*[[Stone of the Sun]]

== Description ==
The chest containing the scepter appears to be magically sealed and will not budge.

The plaque above it depicts two giant statues holding star and moon-shaped stone sockets at their center.

The two statues are pictured guarding pyramids that look like the ones outside.

Perhaps it's worth your while to investigate these.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
You wipe away the sand from the hieroglyphs only for them to become covered in a new layer. You'd best hurry.

== Completion ==
You place the two gems inside the sockets in the wall.
