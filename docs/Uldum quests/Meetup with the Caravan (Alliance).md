== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Adarrah}} at [[Thistleshrub Valley]] in [[Tanaris]].

== Description ==
The pyramid inside of the [[Maker's Rise|Maker's Terrace]]{{Sic}} in [[Uldum]] can be used as some kind of super weapon that will end all life on [[Azeroth]].

<{{NPC||Harrison Jones||Harrison}} thinks a moment.>

You need to continue the research you've begun. Head to the southern end of [[Kalimdor]], to the desert of Tanaris. There's a caravan there that's about to leave for Uldum.

Perhaps you can tag along.

== Completion ==
Harrison sent you, hmm?

How fortunate!

== Notes ==
There's no friendly NPC offering to teleport players directly to her, so make the trek the old-fashioned way. Don't forget about the free teleport to the [[Caverns of Time]] from [[Shattrath City]] (reputation required) and [[Dalaran]] (no rep required). Don't forget about the flight paths on either side of the [[Valley of the Watchers]] either. The entrance to Uldum is ''not'' at the Valley of the Watchers, however. Head just northwest to Thistleshrub Valley and speak to Adarrah.

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}
