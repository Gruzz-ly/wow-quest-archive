==Objectives==
Collect 6 Rugged Hyena Pelts from [[Amathet Hunter]]s or by [[skinning]] [[hyena]]s in [[Uldum]].
* [[Rugged Hyena Pelt]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Wastewander]]s used the pelts of the local hyenas to construct our armor. Unfortunately since the [[Amathet]] arrived, their [[hunter]]s have overrun our normal hunting grounds.

We need those pelts, and will pay handsomely for them. Either take them from the hunters or skin the hyenas yourself, if you have the skill.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* 325x [[Coalescing Visions]]
* Random [[War Resources]], [[Azerite (resource)]], or [[Money]]
* +125 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you brought back the pelts?

==Completion==
You're a life-saver, friend.

Here's your reward, as promised.

== Notes ==
The hyenas will also drop hides in addition to being skinned for them.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
