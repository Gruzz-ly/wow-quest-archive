== Objectives ==
Free {{NPC||Prince Nadun}} and speak to {{NPC||King Phaoris}} at [[Ramkahen]] in [[Uldum]].

== Description ==
Everything is ready! Undo my chains and set your friends free.

We must move quickly before the [[Neferset]] scum realize we're up to something!

If we make it, see my brother, King Phaoris for a reward.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Royal Reward|Ramkahen Badge of Valor}}

== Completion ==
Is it true then? An outsider rescued {{NPC||Prince Nadun}} from the Neferset?

We are truly in your debt, stranger.

== Notes ==

Accepting the quest starts the last cutscene for a while.
:''The camera starts out focused on Nadun, now free of his chains.''
:{{text|bossemote|Prince Nadun|Free... at last.  Your reward will be substantial, friends.}}
:''Adarrah walks into the frame from the right.''
:{{text|bossemote|Adarrah|This is the most moronic... half-assed... ridiculous plan you've ever come up with, Budd!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Adarrah|But I suppose it's the only plan we've got.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Adarrah|What am I grabbing again?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Prince Nadun|Your approach is... unorthodox.  Though, I suppose with the smoke from the fires, all they'll see is your silhouettes.}}
:''Adarrah walks toward the front of the cages and the camera pans along after her, showing the six members of the caravan in a very, very rough approximation of two tol'vir, wearing a piece of armor each.  Nadun walks in to the frame, inspecting the "tol'vir" to the side of him.
:{{text|bossemote|Budd|LOOK AT ME!!!!  I'M A [[magnataur|MANATAUR]]!!!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Adarrah|Shut your stupid face, Budd.  SHUT IT!!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Prince Nadun|Let's go!}}
:''The two "tol'vir" and Nadun run off into the city and make their escape.''

Players find themselves in Ramkahen at the conclusion of the cutscene, standing near Nadun.  King Phaoris can be found inside the building to the north, with his royal guardian [[Akhet]].
