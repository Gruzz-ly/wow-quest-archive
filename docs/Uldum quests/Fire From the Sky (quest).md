==Objectives==
Kill 100 Schnottz Troopers while mounted on the {{NPC||Confiscated Artillery}}.
*Schnottz Infantrymen slain x100

==Description==
{{NPC||Sullah}} wasn't kidding. That hill is crawling with troopers!

Jump on and paint our targets for me.

Make every shot count, <name>! We need to be able to get up there.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Confiscated Dog Tags|Powderburned Spaulders|Canopic Chestplate}}
You will also receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{coppercost|104600}} at max level)

==Progress==
Don't think twice, <name>.

These guys are rotten to the core.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>.

Now let's see if we can make our way up there before they're able to recover.

==Notes==
Hop in. Players have access to one ability:
*{{abilities|Designate Target|range=300|Designates the desired location for Harrison's artillery strike.|notes=Instant|cd=5 sec}}

There's a good 3-4 sec lead time from when players paint a target to when the shell lands, so try to lead the troops some.

An achievement, [[Help the Bombardier! I'm the Bombardier!]], is awarded if players can kill 10 infantry within a few seconds of each other. See the Help the Bombardier article for more information. The achievement is also available in the [[Fire From the Sky (daily)|daily version]].

==Progression==
{{Temple of Uldum}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2010-12-14|bluenote=Kill credit is now awarded to all party members. Missiles from other players are also visible to everyone now.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
