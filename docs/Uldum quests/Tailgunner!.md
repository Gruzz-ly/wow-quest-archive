== Objectives ==
Use the tailgun to defend the [[Schnottz Bomber]].
*Escaped the [[Obelisk of the Sun]]

== Description ==
Okay, I've softened {{NPC||Burly Sea Trooper||this guy}} up, how about you help me finish him off?

I've got a plan for our escape, but it'll require a lot of guts and a little luck.

You up for it, <name>?

Just follow my lead...

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Tailgunner's Flight Suit|Reinforced Seatbelt|Aeronaut's Helm}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Completion ==
Good work back there, <name>.

Looks like we've lost them, for now at least.

== Notes ==
Another cutscene... the player runs over to the dead body next to Harrison and the sea trooper, grabs the monkey wrench and stuns the sea trooper. Harrison and the player then jump into the plane, which starts moving forward. One of the props shreds the sea trooper, another reference to [[wikipedia:Raiders of the Lost Ark|Raiders of the Lost Ark]] where the Nazi Mechanic is killed in the same way. As the plane taxis to the runway, the rest of the plans are spooled up and take after Harrison's plane. Cutscene concluded, Harrison takes the plane around for a tour and then in through the chamber of the sun, finally heading back to the [[Vir'naal Dam]] in the center of Uldum.

Harrison doesn't offer any more quests right now, so take the [[Efficient Excavations]] book down to [[Schnottz's Landing]].  The Harrison quests resume briefly with [[Meet Me In Vir'sar]] once the Schnottz quest [[Firing Squad]] has been completed.

==Progression==
