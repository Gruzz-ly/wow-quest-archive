==Objectives==
You are to slay 8 Diseased Vultures.

==Description==
The sky above the [[Cradle of the Ancients|Shriveled Oasis]] is littered with these nasty [[vulture]]s.

Like infectious rodents with wings, these creatures serve no great purpose and inflict untold misery.

Rid the skies of this nuisance and leave the region better than you found it.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|16|53}} at max level

==Completion==
You've made the Cradle of the Ancients a somewhat less despicable place to travel through.

==Notes==
