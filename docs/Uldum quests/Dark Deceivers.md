==Objectives==
Kill 8 k'thir minions in [[Uldum]].
* [[K'thir]] minion slain  (8)

==Description==
The [[Old God]]s have many [[N'raqi|faceless]] minions at their disposal, but none so deceiving as the ones they call k'thir.

Though not nearly as imposing as their brethren, the k'thir manipulate in the shadows, bending the wills of men and even reality itself.

We must not allow their machinations to go unchecked.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
*x342 [[Azerite (resource)]]
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring?

==Completion==
We cannot let these creatures roam Uldum unhindered.

You have done well to cull their numbers.

==Notes==
*Kill: [[K'thir Doomsayer]]s, [[K'thir Thoughtstealer]]s, [[Corrupted Doomsayer]]s, [[Corrupted Thoughtstealer]]s, [[Shol'thoss the Doomspeaker]], [[Doomsayer Vathiris]], [[Actiss the Deceiver]], and [[Thoughtstealer Vos]].
