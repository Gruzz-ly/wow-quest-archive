==Objectives==
Use the Reinforced Cage to capture 5 [[Cavorting Pygmy|Cavorting Pygmies]].
*Sand Pygmies captured x5
*[[Sullah's Pygmy Pen]] (provided)

==Description==
Some see the little [[sand pygmy]] as nothing more than a pest, a vermin, or worse yet, a vile little demon.

I say they are simply misunderstood!

With the proper care and guidance, these little fellows may just turn out to be a glorious gift of nature.

I would like you to take these cages and use them to capture a few of them for me to work with.

You will need to give them a sound beating before boxing them up, but in the end it will be for their own good.

You'll see!

Go south for pygmies!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{cost|10|46}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did you capture the Pygmies I need, friend?

==Completion==
Splendid!

This is shaping up to be better than I had dared to dream!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Master Trapper (quest)]] and [[Camelraderie]] before heading out.

Head south for camels, pygmies and wildlife.

When pygmies are weakened enough (below 20% health), a boss emote triggers:

Sullah offers [[Jonesy Sent For You]] upon the completion of any of these three quests.
