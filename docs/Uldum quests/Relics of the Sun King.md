== Objectives ==
Obtain 4 Relics of the Sun King.
*[[Relic of the Sun King]] x4

== Description ==
The [[Seal of the Sun King]] serves as a defense mechanism for [[Ramkahen]].

When the barrier around [[Uldum]] fell, we began to see [[Wastewander]] outriders from [[Tanaris]] filter into our borders.

They attacked this holy site on their way west and robbed it of the relics which once provided its power.

Recover the relics for us. Without them we are powerless to defend against attacks from the desert.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Did you succeed?

== Completion ==
Thank you. The rumors I'd heard about you are proving true after all.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Venomblood Antidote]] before heading out. Then head north into the [[Sahket Wastes]] to kill wastewanders and scorpids.

==Progression==
{{Escape and retribution}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
