==Objectives==
Speak with [[Blacksmith Abasi]] in [[Ramkahen]].
* Speak with Blacksmith Abasi

==Description==
I think it's safe to say that our little friend is no long{{Sic}} a hatchling, but a fully grown [[aqir]]! He's grown so much, in fact, he could even carry you into battle.

Wait, that's a marvelous idea!

You should speak with Blacksmith Abasi about getting a saddle made.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What do you need?

==Completion==
I am certain I can craft a suitable saddle for that creature.

However, I am going to need your help with some things first.

==Notes==
;Blacksmith Abasi
{{Gossip|Can you craft a saddle for an aqir?}}
:I was wondering what you and that [[draenei]] were doing keeping that bug here in Ramkahen.

:If you've somehow managed to tame that thing, then I'm sure it could carry you. We'll want some special supplies to craft the saddle, though, so as not to add undue weight.
