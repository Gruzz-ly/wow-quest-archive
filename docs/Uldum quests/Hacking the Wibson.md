==Objectives==
Hack the [[Wibson Mainframe]] on top of the [[M.A.C. Diver]].
*Wibson Mainframe hacked {{co|77.0|62.9|Uldum}}

==Description==
It is true. New [[Cursed expedition|expedition]] crews have arrived by sea.

My scanners detect that they already have been afflicted by the curse phenomenon.

You must hurry and go aboard the M.A.C. Diver. The access codes will give us control over the [[Fusion Core|fusion core]]'s functions, but there is still a layer of security we must bypass.

User <name>, I must ask you to hack a very sophisticated mainframe known as the "Wibson."

Do not worry I will provide you with further instructions.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
Greetings, user <name>.

==Completion==
I am in control, user <name>.  But I cannot keep the core temperature stable indefinitely. 

==Notes==
Fly due east up on top of the submarine. Interact with the [[Maintenance Tools]] {{co|77.0|62.9|Uldum}} immediately next to the Wibson Mainframe to loot the [[Maintenance Axe]], then interact with the Mainframe. This causes the player character to jump atop it and literally "hack" it by hitting it with the axe a few times, before jumping off automatically. Turn in to the nearby [[Fusion Core]].

==Trivia==
The quest name is a reference to the cult film ''{{Wp|Hackers (film)|Hackers}}'' (1995), in which the protagonists hack an advanced computer mainframe named the Gibson.

==Progression==
{{Curse of the Tombs}}
