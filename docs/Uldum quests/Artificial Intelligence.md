== Objectives ==
Speak to the A.I.D.A terminal at the [[Surveyors' Outpost|Surveyor's Outpost]] in [[Uldum]].
*[[A.I.D.A. Communicator]] (provided)

== Description ==
<A feminine voice addresses you over the portable terminal.>

Emergency code: 55-729.

Upper cerebral cortex functions in [[Cursed expedition|expedition]] members have been compromised.

Please report to your nearest terminal location, to the southeast of the [[Sunstone Terrace]], for further analysis.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*3,100 [[XP]]
*{{cost|7|87|50}}

== Progress ==
<The terminal whirrs as its mechanisms become active.>

== Completion ==
Scanning subject...

Cerebral cortex diagnostics indicate the absence of "tomb curse" phenomenon.

Diagnostics did reveal frequent head trauma.  The user would do well to exercise more caution around blunt objects in the future.

== Notes ==
The A.I.D.A Communicator drops from the [[Crazed Digger]]s on [[Sunstone Terrace]], the [[Cursed Expedition Member]]s at [[Starwatch Tower]], and [[Cursed Surveyor]]s in the [[Cursed Landing]], the [[Trail of Devastation]], and the [[Steps of Fate]]. The player is directed to kill Crazed Diggers in [[The Curse of the Tombs]], but this is an optional breadcrumb that only unlocks after [[The Defense of Nahom]] late in the main questline, and is not required to start this side chain.
