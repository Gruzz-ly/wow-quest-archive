== Objectives ==
Report to the regiment at [[Nahom]] in [[Uldum]].

== Description ==
As soon as we make our move west in order to attack Neferset City, the enemy will strike us from the east, where we'll be weak.

Nahom will be the first to fall, and if it does, [[Ramkahen]] will soon follow.

A small detachment is there already.

Get a briefing from them. I want you to make sure that they hold Nahom until I can send more troops there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}}

== Completion ==
<Name>! It's you! My regiment was ambushed on our way here.

Our captain was slain, leaving me in command... until you got here, that is... sir!

== Notes ==
Head southwest to reach Nahom. Inside the building is {{NPC||Salhet}}!

==Progression==
{{Down with Neferset City}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
