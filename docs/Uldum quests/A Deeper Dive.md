==Objectives==
Defend High Explorer Dellorah as she deciphers the [[Amathet Monument]] at [[Sunstone Terrace]].
* [[High Explorer Dellorah]] defended

==Description==
Something just isn't adding up about these [[Amathet]]. Why would protectors of [[titan]] works attack and damage the [[Forge of Origination]]?

I think we need tae take a closer look. I think I saw a monument on the terrace over there. Perhaps the writings there could tell us more about these [[tol'vir]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm ready when ye are, <class>.

==Completion==
This monument was a good start, but it still doesn't explain what we're looking for.

Fortunately, uncovering mysteries is what the [[Explorer's League]] does best!

==Notes==
;At the Amathet Monument
: It might take me a few tae decipher what's written on these tablets. I'll need ye tae watch my back.

: ''An [[Amathet Sun Priest]] attacks. After a bit, Dellorah finishes and turns to you.''
:{{text|say|High Explorer Dellorah|All right! It says here the Amathet once inhabited the tombs right below us.}}
:{{text|say|High Explorer Dellorah|That means more o' their artifacts must be nearby.}}
