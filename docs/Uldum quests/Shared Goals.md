==Objectives==
Defend High Explorer Dellorah as she deciphers the Amathet Tablets within the [[Chamber of the Stars]].
* [[High Explorer Dellorah]] defended

==Description==
The decree you found made mention of a plan to defeat the [[Old God]]s.

I know that the [[Amathet]] aren't likely to work with us toward that goal, but if they have a plan tae take out [[N'Zoth]], it's worthwhile for us tae look at it.

The decree mentions the [[Engine of Ascension]]. I think that might be what they call that solar empowering device we saw earlier. We should take a peek underneath and see if we can figure out what they're planning!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's see what we can find in the Chamber of the Stars.

==Completion==
These Amathet are off their rockers!

They've decided that [[Azeroth]] is too far gone for saving!

==Notes==
;At the Amathet Tablets
:{{text|say|High Explorer Dellorah|These markings reference the Old Gods. This might be how the Amathet plan tae defeat N'Zoth.}}
: It might take me a few tae decipher what's written on these tablets. I'll need ye tae watch my back.

:{{text|say|High Explorer Dellorah|Some of these symbols are of titan origin. This one here means "[[Reply-Code Omega|Reply code: Omega]]."}}
:{{text|say|High Explorer Dellorah|Wait... that cannae be right...}}
: ''After a bit, Dellorah moves over to the center between the tablets. An [[Amathet Lightblade]] attacks:''
:{{text|yell|Amathet Lightblade|The [[Forge of Origination|Forge]] will purge you all!}}
: ''After a bit, Dellorah finishes and turns to you, alarmed.''
:{{text|say|High Explorer Dellorah|Oh no... the Amathet intend tae eliminate N'Zoth by reoriginatin' all o' Azeroth!}}
