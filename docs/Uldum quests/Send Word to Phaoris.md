== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||King Phaoris}} at [[Ramkahen]] in [[Uldum]].

== Description ==
Hurry, <name>. We must speak to my brother, the king.

He is bent on averting war with {{NPC||Al'Akir}} and the [[Neferset]]. He has foolish hopes that there is a diplomatic solution to this problem.

Maybe once he hears what occurred here he will see reason.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

== Completion ==
This is just the beginning, <name>. If {{NPC||Deathwing}}'s minions can bury entire cities, we have little chance of defeating them through conventional means.

== Notes ==
Fly back to Ramkahen. On complete, a cutscene:
:{{text|say|King Phaoris|Perhaps we ought to give the enemy what they're after... and spare our people the coming bloodshed.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Nadun|I urge you to reconsider, Phaoris. Deathwing would use the scepters' power to unravel the secrets of Uldum and unleash great destruction.}}
:{{text|say|King Phaoris|I must act to protect my people first. Our enemies buried Orsis in the desert. How do you fight against that sort of power?}}
:{{text|say|Prince Nadun|We fight to the death, Phaoris! Our race was created to guard this land. We must not betray that legacy.}}
:{{text|say|King Phaoris|Your words ring true, brother... but even a king cannot make this decision alone. I will put the issue to a High Council vote.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Nadun|I defer to your wisdom, brother. Let us pray we are quick to come to a decision. The enemy will not wait.}}

Phaoris does not offer any followups, so step outside and speak with {{NPC||Prince Nadun}}.

==Progression==
{{Escape and retribution}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Hotfix|date=2013-06-25|bluenote=Players should now be placed into the correct phase after the cutscene, allowing the quest to be completed.|link=http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/9687729/}}
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
