== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||High Priest Amet}} inside the [[Vir'naal Dam]] in [[Uldum]].

== Description ==
High Priest Amet's vote is the only one that is completely outside of our control.

He will vote as his divinations tell him and nothing we do will dissuade him.

I figure that gives us even odds either way.

The only problem we face is that his clairvoyance has failed him ever since the barriers around Uldum fell.

He will not cast a vote unless he regains power over his divinations.

Speak to him and see what you can do to help.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||86}}

== Completion ==
War, you say.

Divinations for war are always difficult. Some wars must never be fought, even if victory was assured. Some wars have to be waged even if defeat is certain.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Vizier's Vote]] and [[The High Commander's Vote]] before heading out. Head down to the Vir'naal Dam. At either end is a path down inside the dam, where High Priest Amet awaits.

==Progression==
