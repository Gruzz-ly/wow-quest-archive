==Objectives==
You are to collect 7 Suspended Starlight in the [[Chamber of the Stars]].
*[[Suspended Starlight]] x7
*[[Sapphire Spectacles]] (provided)

==Description==
Look at this, <name>.

<[[Harrison Jones|Harrison]] holds up the [[Schnottz Scout|dead scout]]'s goggles.>

I tightened the clamp in the middle and crimped the wires on the edges. They may not be the most fashionable, but they should hold together.

If I've translated your tablets correctly, there's something hidden here - a final piece to our puzzle.

I hope your spectacles hold the key.

Let me know what you find!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
So?

Find anything interesting?

==Completion==
Well, kid, it looks like you've done it again.

<Harrison points to an image on the tablets.>

This starlight is exactly what we were missing.

Now we can get to work!

==Notes==
Accepting the quest puts the Sapphire Spectacles in the player's inventory. Merely ''possessing'' them is enough to put players into "Sapphire Sight": Detects Suspended Starlight in the Chamber of the Stars.

While in this mode, there are small glowing balls hovering a few feet above the floor of the chamber. Also, neutral [[Indentured Protector]]s wander the area. Get close to one of the lights and interact with it to collect it. However, that will aggro a nearby protector or two, so watch out!
*We have sworn to serve, intruder. And so shall you.
*I welcome you into an eternity of service, thief.
*Once a thief, I am now a servant of the Stars.
*You tread on sacred ground! You must be purified!
*Those who behold the starlight must forever protect it!
*Your theft is forbidden, trespasser!

On complete:
:Alright, <name>. Time to see what this staff of yours has to show us.
:''Harrison walks up to the center and throws the staff into the ancient machine. There, it hovers in the center, illuminated by a shaft of light. Suddenly, the four statues in the corner of the room shine red beams at it!''
