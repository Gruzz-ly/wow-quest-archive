== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Adarrah}} at [[Thistleshrub Valley]] in [[Tanaris]].

== Description ==
The pyramid inside of the [[Maker's Rise|Maker's Terrace]]{{Sic}} in [[Uldum]] can be used as some kind of super weapon that will end all life on [[Azeroth]].

<{{NPC||Belloc Brightblade||Belloc}} thinks a moment.>

You need to continue the research you've begun. Head to the southern end of [[Kalimdor]], to the desert of Tanaris. There's a caravan there that's about to leave for Uldum.

Adarrah's an old associate of mine. She'll take you under her wing.

== Completion ==
Belloc sent you, hmm?

<Adarrah eyes you warily.>

Well, you're here already. It can't hurt to have one more along for the trip.

== Notes ==
There's no friendly NPC offering to teleport players directly to her, so make the trek the old-fashioned way. Don't forget about the free teleport to the [[Caverns of Time]] from [[Shattrath City]] and [[Dalaran]]. Don't forget about the flight paths on either side of the [[Valley of the Watchers]] either. The entrance to Uldum is ''not'' at the Valley of the Watchers, however. Head just northwest to Thistleshrub Valley and speak to Adarrah.

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}
