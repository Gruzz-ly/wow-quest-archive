==Objectives==
Bring the Otherworldly Saddle to [[H'partho Ardoros|H'Partho Adoros]]{{sic}} in [[Ramkahen]].
* [[Otherworldly Saddle]] (provided)

==Description==
The saddle is complete. I can't say I enjoyed working with that corrupted metal, but in the end I can easily say this is the finest saddle I have ever crafted.

I know it looks... aggressive, but I assure you that your aqir will find it quite comfortable.

I hope it serves you well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
*[[Shadowbarb Drone]]

==Progress==
Was the blacksmith able to help?

==Completion==
I am impressed, this is beyond what I thought Abasi capable of.

It looks like our little friend is ready to fly the nest. Remember to take good care of him!

And do visit once and{{sic}} a while.

==Notes==
