== Objectives ==
{{NPC||Belloc Brightblade}} wants you to reaassure the guests at [[Schnottz's Landing]].
*{{NPC||Prolific Writer}} Questioned
*{{NPC||Privileged Socialite}} Soothed
*{{NPC||Pretentious Businessman}} Chastened
*{{NPC||Budding Artist}} Counseled

== Description ==
There is a delicate situation that calls for the... objective discretion of an outsider.

You see, an unfortunate incident has upset some of our guests. Rest assured, our top men are sorting out the details.

In the meantime, it would be wonderful if you could calm some of our more squeamish visitors.

Handle this well, and {{NPC||Commander Schnottz||the furrier}} is sure to hear of it!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to put the guests' minds at ease, <race?>

== Completion ==
Hmm, still a bit frazzled, are they?

Well, you know what they say. Time heals all wounds.

Except for those of {{NPC||Ambassador Laurent||the ambassador}}, of course...

== Notes ==
{{NPC||Ambassador Laurent}} was attacked in the building he was in, and made his way out to the central area, leaving a blood trail to the center of the camp before dying. The four NPC targets are standing around Laurent's corpse.

On completion, one of Schnottz's bodyguards rushes into the hut:
:{{text|yell|Schnottz's Bodyguard|Hide your vives! Hide your children! Zhey're killink everyone up in he'ah!}}
:{{text|yell|Belloc Brightblade|What are you talking about, goblin? Speak!!}}

:''The bodyguard stomps on the ground.''
:{{text|yell|Belloc Brightblade|What are you waiting for? Get out there and stop them!}}
:{{text|yell|Schnottz's Bodyguard|Of course, sir! At Vonce!}}
The commander offers the next quest, [[Battlezone]]
