== Objectives ==
Accompany {{NPC||Harrison Jones}} to the [[Chamber of the Stars]].
*Accompanied Harrison Jones to the Chamber of the Stars

== Description ==
This is remarkable work you've done! Especially for someone who hasn't taken my courses.

[[Ornate Tablet Fragment|These tablets]] provide new information on several subjects.

They indicate that these obelisks are part of an enormous ancient mechanism that once kept [[Uldum|this region]] masked from [[Azeroth|the rest of the world]].

They also depict how to recharge the mechanism, which is where your [[Shaft of the Stars]] comes in...

Get ready, <name>. We have some history to make!

== Completion ==
Would you get a load of this place!

== Notes ==
Talk to the Doctor again.
:I've been meaning to investigate this site.
:No time like the present!

:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|Stay alert, <name>. There's no telling what we might run into down here...}}
:''The quest completes at this point. Harrison looks down the hole, then jumps in!''
