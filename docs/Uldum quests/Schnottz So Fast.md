==Objectives==
Kill 10 Schnottz Elite Troopers in the [[Chamber of the Moon (Uldum)|Chamber of the Moon]].
*[[Schnottz Elite Trooper]] slain x10

==Description==
I'm nearly ready, <name>.

Your scrolls contained enough information to discern their encryption method. Now all that's left is for me to translate the codes.

I need you to scout out the chamber beneath the [[Obelisk of the Moon]]. There are likely to be a few of [[Commander Schnottz|Schnottz]]'s troops down there that escaped your blast.

You take care of them and I'll meet you there when I'm finished.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{coppercost|104600}} at max level)

==Completion==
Alright, <name>.

I think everything is in order. Let's do this!

==Notes==
A side quest is now available. Fly over the ridge and kill [[Myzerian]], who survived the blast. Collect [[Myzerian's Head]] to start [[Myzerian's Head (quest)]].

To advance the storyline, however...

Instead of flying over the ridge, fly into it. There's a huge door on Harrison's side of the ridge leading into the Chamber of the Moon. Fly in, then down the hole to the lower level.

Schnottz Elite Troopers are still active, but weakened. They are down to 76715 of their 232,000 health. They're also occupied fighting off neutral [[Ancestral Guardian]]s, but the guardians will not assist the player.

The elites can shoot for upwards of 3,500 damage on cloth and will melee in the 4,500 range. So, not as hard as they hit on the surface, but still, not hitting like a limp noodle.

Kill 10 and another cutscene triggers. Harrison can be seen jumping down from the upper level and running toward the center of the room. The player comes out of the cutscene there to meet him.
