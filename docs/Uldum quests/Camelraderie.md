==Objectives==
Use Sullah's Harness to tame 3 Camels.
*[[Wild Camel]]s captured x3
*[[Sullah's Camel Harness]] (provided)

==Description==
Greetings, friend!

You are always most welcome in my humble tent.

Looking for something to do? Sullah has just the thing!

Camels are good to have in hand regardless, but when putting together a performance the likes of my sideshow, they are an absolute must!

Take this harness and use it to subdue a wandering camel.

You may have to, uhh, humble it a bit first... if you know what I mean.

You'll find a desert full of wild camels to the south.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{coppercost|104600}} at max level)

==Progress==
Were you able to tame some camels for me yet, <name>?

==Completion==
You've done it!

I now have camels to spare. Perhaps one day we shall take our show on the road!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Master Trapper (quest)]] and [[Unlimited Potential (quest)]] before heading out.

Head south for camels, pygmies and wildlife.

When camels are weakened enough (below 35% health), a boss emote triggers:
:{{text|bossemote|Wild Camel weakens! Capture it with your harness!}}

Sullah offers [[Jonesy Sent For You]] upon the completion of any of these three quests.
