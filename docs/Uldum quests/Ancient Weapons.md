== Objectives ==
Retrieve the Ancient Tol'vir Armaments.
*[[Ancient Tol'vir Armaments]]
*[[Horn of Ramkahen]] (provided)

== Description ==
Though we aren't formally at war yet, the [[Neferset]] do not hesitate to imprison or kill all who trespass upon their territories.

{{NPC||King Phaoris}} refuses to recriprocate, even when they use our lands to smuggle stolen relics from the tombs of our ancestors.

My scouts report that the Neferset are about to move a major shipment of looted weapons south of here.

I've instructed the laborers you recruited to assist you. Call upon them with this horn when you find the smugglers and recover the weapons.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Stolen Neferset Waistguard
|Chestguard of the Bleak Scarab
|Weaponseeker Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
You've returned, <name>. How did the operation go?

== Completion ==
This is quite timely. I will distribute these armaments to my best men and to the laborers that you recruited.

I've a feeling they'll show as much courage as my best trained captains.

== Notes ==
Fly down the river toward the falls and the lost city. At {{co|60.5|58.5|Uldum}} is a large group of {{NPC||Neferset Smuggler}}s. Aggro them with the horn. A few of the smugglers will drop the weapons on the ground.
