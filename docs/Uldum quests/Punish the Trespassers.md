==Objectives==
Slay any 10 [[Neferset]] intruders at the [[Tombs of the Precursors]].
*Neferset intruder slain x10

==Description==
We, the priests of [[Nahom]], are the guardians of the Tombs of the Precursors.

Ever since the Neferset turned to their new masters, they've turned to great heresies.

They rob the sacred tombs of our forefathers, seeking powerful artifacts and destroying invaluable relics in the process.

Go to the tombs, west of here, and punish the tomb-robbers for their transgressions, lest they join their brethren when the Neferset attack on Nahom begins.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Leggings of the Unforgiving Tomb|Grave Protector Shoulderplates|Ramkahen Ceremonial Hammer}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
You're back, <name>. Is your prowess as great as I've heard?

==Completion==
Perhaps you are as powerful as I've heard afterall.

You have our gratitude.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Secret of Nahom]] before heading out. Head just east to the tombs, which are above ground southeast of the pyramid. Fragments litter the ground and there are plenty of Neferset in the area.

==Progression==
{{Down with Neferset City}}
