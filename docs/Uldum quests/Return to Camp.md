== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||High Commander Kamses}} at the [[Ramkahen Legion Outpost|Ramkahen Legion post]]. 

== Description ==
What do you think, <name>? Maybe the High Commander will give me a few men to command.

Maybe we can marshal a regiment together. What do you think?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Salhet}}? A tactician, you say?

Hah! Very well, if you vouch for him, we might be able to arrange something.

== Notes ==
Back to the north-northeast.

This concludes Kamses' portion of the fork. Complete the High Priest's and the Vizier's quest chains as well to be offered the conclusion, [[The High Council's Decision]].
