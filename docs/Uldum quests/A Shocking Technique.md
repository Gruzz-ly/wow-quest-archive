==Objectives==
Collect 8 Lightning Rod Components from the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Zan-tien Generator Part]] (8)

==Description==
I have heard tales that the [[mogu]] use lightning to speed up the growth of their [[cloud serpent]]s. I wonder if the same principle could be used for our [[aqir]] friend?

There's only one way to find out! Go to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and see if you can get the parts together so we can create our own lightning rods. 

If they work the same as they do for the cloud serpents, it should speed up the hatching process significantly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +900 reputation with [[Voidtouched Egg]]

==Progress==
Were you able to collect the proper components?

==Completion==
I hope the mogu didn't give you too much trouble.

It will all be worth it, though, once we hatch our little friend there.

==Notes==
The generator parts are located at the [[Golden Stair]] in Vale of Eternal Blossoms.
