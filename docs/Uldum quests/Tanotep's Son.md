== Objectives ==
Obtain the Vir'Naal Delta map from a {{NPC||Neferset Guard}}
*[[Vir'Naal Delta Map]]

== Description ==
I have devoted my life to serving {{NPC||King Phaoris||the King}}. That service is unrivaled in importance by anything... with one exception: my son.

{{NPC||Tahet}} was captured by Neferset sentries.

They claim my son was trespassing upon their territory. Phaoris is attempting to negotiate his release... but I fear for the worst.

If you were to find Tahet, I would pledge my vote to you.

I do not know where they take the prisoners, but I've seen the guards consult maps to guide them through the thick vegetation.

("Neferset guards may carry maps pointing to Tahet's location.")

==Rewards==

== Completion ==
You've obtained a map of the Vir'naal river delta.
