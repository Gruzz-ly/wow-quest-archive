The [[cultist]]s that follow this dark legion befoul our lands with symbols of the tyrants they follow.

Their mindless followers flock to these banners, worshipping them as unholy idols.

Burn them down, and cleanse their taint from our lands.

Good. It will be a fine day when these disgraceful sigils no longer befoul our land.
