== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Salhet}} at the Southern End of the [[Sunwatcher's Ridge]] in [[Uldum]].

Listen, <name>. Before you give up on me, there's something I'd like to show you.

I'm more of a tactical mind.

Meet me at the southern end of the ridge and I'll show you.

You will receive: {{cost|4|30}}

== Completion ==
Aren't they beautiful?

== Notes ==
Fly southeast. Keep an eye out for {{NPC||Salhet's Lion}}s, three level 83 elite lions.
