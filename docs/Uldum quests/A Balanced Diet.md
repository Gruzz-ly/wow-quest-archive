==Objectives==
Collect 12 Chunks of Meat from [[beast]]s in [[Uldum]] and the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
*[[Chunk of Meat]] (12)
* [[Shadowbarb Larva|Larva]] fed

==Description==
Now that our larva is hatched, we'll need to figure out what we can feed it to keep it healthy.

It would seem that the [[aqir]] are carnivores, but the only things I've seen them eat are... well... us.

Of course, we can't feed our little friend people, so we'll have to find an alternative. Perhaps we could substitute [[animal]] meat?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +300 reputation with [[Shadowbarb Larva]]

==Progress==
He looks hungry, I hope you brought a snack.

==Completion==
It looks like animal meat is not his favorite.

He should be okay for now, we'll try something different later.

==Notes==
Kill [[Rabid Hyena]] to get the meat.

;Return with the meat
:''The shadowbarb larva now has its own fenced pen.''

;Place meat
:{{Text|say|[[H'partho Ardoros]]|Here you go, little guy. Eat up!}}
:''The larva moves to the meat, pauses, then moves away without eating the meat .''
:{{Text|say|H'partho Ardoros|Hmmm... he doesn't seem to like it much.}}
