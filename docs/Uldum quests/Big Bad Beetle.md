==Objectives==
Defeat the Aqir Sandcrawler in a [[pet battle]] with your [[Shadowbarb Hatchling]] in your party.
*[[Aqir Sandcrawler]] defeated

==Description==
It could do our hatchling some good to face off against another [[aqir]], to learn what his kind are capable of.

I have found an opponent who could provide a challenging fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +900 reputation with [[Aqir Hatchling]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Looks like we've got a tough little hatchling on our hands!

That should be enough training for today, though.
