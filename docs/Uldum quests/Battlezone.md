You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Vell?

Has our little situation been brought under control?

== Completion ==
Auch!

If I vere an inch or two taller, I'd be dead!

== Notes ==
Fly west to the siege tanks. A tank driver tries to get the player's attention with any of the following:
*{{text|yell|Siege Tank Driver|<Name>! Ovah he'ah!}}
*{{text|yell|Siege Tank Driver|Come, <name>! Into zhe siege tank! NOW!}}
*{{text|yell|Siege Tank Driver|Hurry, <name>! Zhere is little time!}}
*{{text|yell|Siege Tank Driver|Zhis vay, <name>! Come! Come!}}

Hop in:
:{{text|say|Siege Tank Driver|I vill vorry about zhe drivink!}}
:{{text|say|Siege Tank Driver|You vorry about zhe killink!}}
The siege tank takes off and the player hops into the turret. It has a standard projectile weapon that hits for ~44,000 damage against the Decrepit Watcher's 154,980 health. So it will take a few rounds to take it out. Kill seven. The tank driver will automatically return to camp.

Run back to the commander's hut, but it explodes, knocking the player back. Head inside to check the damage. [[Belloc Brightblade]] has vanished, and is the last time he is seen in all of Uldum, arousing suspicions that he sabotaged Schnottz's hut. These suspicions are lent further credence with Belloc's subsequent appearance in the [[Krasarang Wilds]] of [[Pandaria]].
