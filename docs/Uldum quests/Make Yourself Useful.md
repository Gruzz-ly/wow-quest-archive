==Notes==
Schnottz's new gossip text:
*Say, would you mind just blocking the sun with your shadow for a little while?
:That'd be great...
*Schnottz is making a fortune because of us... where's ours?!
*It's far too hot to work out here - especially in these uniforms.
*I was promised substantial wealth to come out here.
What a joke!

Head northwest. The units are specifically called Slacking Laborers. Don't bother with the Schnottz's Landing Laborers.

The laborers can react hostilely:
*{{Text|say|I'm not working for that maniac anymore!}}
*{{Text|say|I have a message for you to deliver to that tyrant!}}
*{{Text|say|I can't believe I fell for Schnottz's lies! I'm out of here!}}
*{{Text|say|I haven't been paid since I got here! I'm through with this place!}}
*{{Text|say|I'm done working in this heat!}}

Or not:
*{{Text|say|Yeah, yeah. When aren't we behind schedule?}}
*{{Text|say|I should never have left Tanaris.}}
*{{Text|say|I didn't sign up for this...}}
*{{Text|say|I was happier as a Wastewander.}}

Schnottz offers new gossip text again when completing the quest:
*After zhat ritual debacle, you owe me, <race>.
:And I plan on collectink!
*How do you zhink Gobbles vould feel about you if he vere here?
:Hmm?

Belloc offers the next quest, [[Crisis Management]].
