'''[[Uldum]]''' is the level 83-84 zone of ''Cataclysm''. The full breadcrumb chain to Uldum starts during the [[Deepholm quests|Deepholm storyline]] as soon as players hit level 83. Two quests open up in the player's respective faction's room in the [[Temple of Earth]] and involves a few quests at the [[Twilight Terrace]] before heading to [[Stormwind]] or [[Orgrimmar]] to check in, then down to [[Thistleshrub Valley]] in [[Tanaris]] to meet up with {{NPC||Adarrah}}'s caravan.

Adarrah's quest, [[Easy Money]], is the ''required'' first quest of the zone, as the quests before it are all optional, but they do fill in some of the lore. After completing Easy Money, the storyline proper begins in a phased version of the [[Lost City of the Tol'vir]] with [[Traitors!]]. After [[Escape From the Lost City]], players wind up in [[Ramkahen]] on the open world and can then branch out at their leisure.

There are two parallel storylines in Uldum, one involving the [[tol'vir]] of [[Ramkahen (faction)|Ramkahen]] and [[Neferset]], and another involving [[Harrison Jones]] and the [[Coffer of Promise]]. Both storylines can be completed independently of one another, and there is a breadcrumb early in the tol'vir storyline that sends players to Harrison.

Breadcrumbs to the three dungeons of Uldum, the [[Vortex Pinnacle]], the [[Lost City of the Tol'vir]], and the [[Halls of Origination]], exist in the form of:
*[[The Vortex Pinnacle (quest)]] offered during "[[#Escape and retribution|Escape and retribution]]"
*[[Return to the Lost City]] offered upon conclusion of "[[#Down with Neferset City|Down with Neferset City]]"
*[[The Heart of the Matter (Uldum)]] offered upon conclusion of "[[#Temple of Uldum|Temple of Uldum]]".

In addition to the normal quest progression, there are four quests started by killing the local wildlife at the right time. The four quests all appear during Harrison's storyline and are marked with "Side quest" in the quest listings.

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Unearthing Uldum]].

After Uldum will be the capstone level-up zone of ''Cataclysm'', [[Twilight Highlands quests|Twilight Highlands]].
