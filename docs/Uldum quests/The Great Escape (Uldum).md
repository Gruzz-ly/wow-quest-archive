== Objectives ==
The {{NPC||Prolific Writer}} in [[Schnottz's Landing]] wants you to collect 6 Fresh Uniforms from {{NPC||Schnottz Sea Trooper}}s.
*[[Fresh Sailor Uniform]] x6

== Description ==
Please, <class>! We need your help!

We're being kept in this building against our will. And with {{NPC||Commander Schnottz||the commander}} on such a tirade, there's no telling what he might do to us!

Perhaps if you were to secure some uniforms for us, we could sneak away.

We never should have come here. I see that now.

If you help us escape, I will write the TRUTH of what has happened here.

The men on those ships are all dressed in the garb we need.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Mirror-Polished Boots|Gauntlets of the Obelisk|False-Face Mask|Officer's Formal Baton}}
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to find us some uniforms, <race>?

== Completion ==
These are perfect, <class>.

Wish us luck!

== Notes ==
On [[Lockdown! (Uldum)|Lockdown!]] while players are checking on the guests, the Prolific Writer offers this quest. Before heading out to the ships, turn in Lockdown! and pick up [[Sending a Message]].

On complete:
:''All of the guests put on the uniform!''
:{{text|say|Prolific Writer|Alright everyone. Follow me and uhh... just act natural.}}
:''The guests walk out the back door of the building and disappear, permanently phasing out.''

==Progression==
