==Objectives==
Kill 5 Aqir Dominators in [[Uldum]].
* [[Aqir Dominator]] slain (5)
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
The [[aqir]] that have assaulted our camp seem to mainly consist of their shock troops. However, our [[scout]]s who dare venture behind their lines have spotted a different kind of creature -- tall and thin, wielding dangerous [[void]] [[magic]].

My instinct tells me that these creatures are the leaders behind this invasion. They should be seen as targets of opportunity, and cut down wherever they're met.

Are you up to the task?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|194|17}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What do you have to report?

==Completion==
Even a [[hydra]] will die if you sever enough of its heads.

Remember that as the battle rages on.
