==Objectives==
Collect 6 Amathet Figurines from [[Amathet]] creatures in [[Uldum]].
* [[Amathet Figurine]] (6)

==Description==
It occurs to me that our larva's current living situation is quite dull. We should try to find something to keep him entertained.

After all, a happy larva is a healthy larva!

I think the Amathet keep figures for worship of their [[god]]s. I'm sure they could also double as toys for our little friend here. See if you can find some!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +900 reputation with [[Shadowbarb Larva]]

==Progress==
Did you find any suitable toys?

==Completion==
Look how happy he is with his new toys!

==Notes==
Kill any Amathet [[tol'vir]] that appear during an Amathet assault on Uldum.

==Progression==
