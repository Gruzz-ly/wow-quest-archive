== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Salhet}} at the [[Ramkahen Legion Outpost]] in [[Uldum]].

== Description ==
They say a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

I subscribe to that theory and expand upon it.

Rather than removing that weak link, one must... strengthen it.

The other links will step up their performance out of fear of they themselves becoming the weakest link.

In my army's case, our weak link has a name. Salhet.

You'll find him training near the bottom of those stairs.

Start him off with something easy. The hyenas on the hills to the west, perhaps.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||86}}

== Completion ==
It is a great honor to meet you, <name>. I've heard much about you.

== Notes ==
Just to the southeast.

==Progression==

== Patch changes ==
