== Description ==
Aww, that was nothin', really.

Those statues were teetering as it was - just needed a little push is all.

How about you go and sort through that rubble?

I've got a feeling we're close to getting this all sorted out.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Find anything interesting, <name>?

== Completion ==
Fine work, <name>.

<Harrison studies the tablets.>

It looks as though our work here is nearly complete.

== Notes ==
Don't forget about [[Just a Fancy Cockroach]], which can be started simply by killing any of the now-dislodged scarabs in the chamber.

Head to the four corners and interact with the Watcher Heads.
