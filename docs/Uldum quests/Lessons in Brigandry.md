==Objectives==
Loot 3 Black Empire Caches in [[Uldum]].
* [[Black Empire Cache]] looted (3)

==Description==
The [[Wastewander]]s have spent many generations as [[brigand]]s, whether on land or sea. Though we have decided to hang up that life for a chance at a more peaceful existence, we have not forgot the lessons we've learned in those days.

One such lesson, which I feel is particularly relevant now, is when faced with a superior opponent, it often helps to use their weapons against them.

Find their hidden caches and take whatever you can carry. You may just find something that can turn the tide of this battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

You will also receive one or two from:
{{itembox||q1=250|Coalescing Visions
|q2=371|Azerite
|q3=345|Azerite
|q4=50|War Resources
}}

==Progress==
Found anything worthwhile?

==Completion==
I hope you found what you were looking for.

We can use all the help we can get in this fight.
