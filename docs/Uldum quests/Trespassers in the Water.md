== Objectives ==
Slay 8 Stillwater Slitherers.
*[[Stillwater Slitherer]] slain x8

== Description ==
Shortly after [[Uldum]]'s protective barriers fell, the [[Nilos River|Nilos]] river became afflicted with a terrible corruption.

Whether it was brought here maliciously or accidentally is not of great significance.

The result is the same. As the river becomes clouded so does our ability into what the future holds for us.

Look outside, <class>. These foul creatures were never meant to live in the pristine waters of our river.

Slay them so that the river may grant us visions once again.

== Rewards ==

== Progress ==
You've returned, <race>.

== Completion ==
Yes, <name>. I can feel the disruption in the river fading.

Yet, I feel the source of this taint still lingers.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Stopping the Spread (Uldum)|Stopping the Spread]] before heading out.
