==Objectives==
Kill 8 Amathet priests in [[Uldum]].
* [[Amathet]] [[priest]]s slain (8)

==Description==
The Sun Priests are an ancient order for the [[tol'vir]] who have walked among all of the [[tribe]]s.

Those that follow the Amathet, however, have twisted our beliefs and weaponized them to justify their crusade against [[Ramkahen]]. Their [[soldier]]s follow them blindly, never questioning.

They must be stopped.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|192|38}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
I take no joy in the deaths of my brethren, but the Amathet must be stopped.

You have my thanks.

==Notes==
*Kill: [[Sun Prophet Epaphos]],	[[Sun Priestess Nubitt]], [[Amathet Sun Priest]]s, and [[Amathet Devoted]].

==Patch changes==
