==Objectives==
Collect 6 Titan Artifacts in [[Uldum]].
*[[Titan Artifact]] (6)

==Description==
Ever since the [[Amathet]] came out of their tombs, they've been busy unearthing [[titan]] relics from the surrounding areas.

I'm not sure what they intend to do with them or if they're just hoarding it so we can't have them. Sufficed to say the [[Explorers' League]] would love to study some of what they found!

Of course, we can't get anywhere close to them without the Amathet trying to stick an axe in us, but that's not a problem for you, is it?

Care to help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*[[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
Any luck with the titan artifacts?

==Completion==
You really do come through, don't you?

You know, we could use some reliable folks like you in the League...

==Notes==
Find the artifacts around the [[Chamber of the Stars]].
