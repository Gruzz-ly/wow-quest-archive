==Objectives==
Burn 10 Egg-bearing corpses.
* Egg-bearing Corpses burned (10)
*[[Torch (Uldum)]] (provided)

==Description==
Our friends continue to fall as these terrible insects pour of their nests and attack our camps.

It's a terrible job to ask of anyone, but we have to dispose of the corpses as quickly as possible.

We can't allow our dead to be used as fertilizer for growing their disgusting eggs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hope this will help keep the growth of their numbers at bay.
