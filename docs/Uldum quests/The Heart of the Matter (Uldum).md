==Objectives==
{{NPC||Brann Bronzebeard}} wants you to meet him in the [[Halls of Origination]].

==Description==
Well, <laddie/little lady>, half of me wishes I could stick around a while and take in the sights with ye.

I've seen some mighty amazin' things in my day, but this here takes the cake.

Sadly, I have a fair bit o' research ta do on these discs before I make my way into the Halls of Origination.

You seem ta be worth your salt, perhaps ye'd like ta tag along and see how a REAL archaeologist works, eh?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|10|46}} at max level

==Completion==
Bout time ye showed up, lad.

Now let's get goin'! There be work ta do!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Arrite then! Follow me!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|The Halls of Origination lie due east of here, near the desert sands of [[Tanaris]]. It be a bit of a walk, so we'd best get movin'.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Me back still be a wee bit stiff from bein' stuck inside that coffer for so long. Bear with me if I'm a little slow...}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Stay close, now! Ya never know when Deathwing's agents might be swoopin' in and puttin' an early end to our quest!}}
:''After slowly walking for a bit more, Brann stops and is overcome with laughter.''
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|I just be pullin' yer leg, <lad/lass>! The slow walkin'... always good fer a laugh!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|You go on ahead. I'll meet ya there as soon as I get these discs decrypted.}}
:''Brann takes off at mounted speed before disappearing in the distance!''

Brann is past the first boss inside the instance, so bring a group to get to him.
