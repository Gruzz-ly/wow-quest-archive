==Objectives==
Collect a Titanic Core from an [[Ivory Watcher]] in [[Uldum]].
* [[Titanic Core]]
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
Our [[scout]]s have reported that the [[Amathet]] are constructing new [[titanic watcher]]s.

We had long thought this art was lost to the sands of [[time]]. It would appear we were mistaken.

I needn't tell you what a boon it would be to have the aid of watcher constructs in our battles for Uldum. We must unlock the secrets of their construction!

The power of a titanic watcher lies in its core. I ask that you bring one to me, so that our [[artificer]]s might divine its construction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*[[Azerite (resource)]]
*50x [[War Resources]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the core?

==Completion==
Marvelous! I have never seen its like!

I will have this sent to my artificers at once! With luck, they can unlock the lost knowledge within.

==Notes==
Find the Ivory Watcher south of [[Khartut's Tomb]] or east of the [[Halls of Origination]].
