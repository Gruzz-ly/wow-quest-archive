==Objectives==
Use the Orbs of the Stars near the mechanism in the [[Chamber of the Stars]].
*[[Obelisk of the Stars]] Reactivated
*[[Orbs of the Stars]] (provided)

==Description==
It looks like all that's left to do is place the orbs on the pedastals at each corner of this mechanism.

We appear to have stumbled upon what may be the most important find in modern history.

<[[Harrison Jones|Harrison]] looks at you for a moment, then hands you the orbs.>

Well, go ahead, <name>.

We'd have never made this discovery without you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Chain Reaction Hood|Crashing Idol Chestguard|Statue Climbers|Eye of the Stars}}
You also will receive: {{cost|17|20}}

==Completion==
Well, now. Would ya look at that!

As amazing as this is, I am confident that there's more to our discovery than meets the eye...

Much more.

==Notes==
Walk a few feet closer to the mechanism and use the orbs. In a cutscene, the four orbs will jump to the four pillars at each corner, then channel something into the mechanism. On the surface, a bright light appears out of the obelisk pointing skyward! When the cutscene ends, the player and Harrison are back on the surface, south of the obelisk.

:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|See ya around, kid.}}
:''Harrison runs off to the southwest toward [[Ramkahen]] before disappearing.''
Follow him to Ramkahen, where [[Adarrah]] waits, offering [[That Gleam in his Eye]].
