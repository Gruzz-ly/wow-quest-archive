== Objectives ==
Mack wants you to investigate [[Khartut's Tomb]].
*Khartut's Tomb Investigated

== Description ==
We was lucky to escape, <class>. I'm not sure I'd feel right if we didn't take care of them ambushers.

Hows about you git back up to Kharkut's tomb and give them little buggers what fer!

It's off to the northeast, just inside the entrance to [[Uldum]] if'n I recollect correctly.

What're you looking at? I sure ain't in no condition to do it!

== Completion ==
Good to see ya, kid.

Would've been even better if you'd have been here to help me take care of these little savages...

== Notes ==
Mack, after the escape, can be found standing next to {{NPC||Asaq}} in [[Mar'at]] while players are on the quest [[Impending Retribution]]. Head up to the northeast corner of the zone where players got ambushed during [[Easy Money]]. Harrison Jones is there along with {{NPC||Lady Humps}}, his mule, and a lot of dead pygmies.
