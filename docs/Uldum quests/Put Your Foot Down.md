==Objectives==
Squish 8 Aqir [[Larva]]e in [[Uldum]].
*[[Aqir Larva]] squished (8)

==Description==
<[[Zahra Sandstalker|Zahra]] stomps on a slimy, slug-like creature as you approach.>

You see that? Doesn't look like much, but believe it or not, those bugs grow out of these things.

They're all over the places the [[aqir]] have taken over, feeding off of our dead and growing into these monstrosities.

If you happen to see any of them, do the [[Azeroth|world]] a favor and take your boot to 'em.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Uldum Accord]]
*325 [[Coalescing Visions]]
*406 [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
What's the word, soldier?

==Completion==
By the looks of your boots, I'd say you stomped out a good number of those creepy crawlies.

Don't worry, it'll clean off... eventually.

==Patch changes==
