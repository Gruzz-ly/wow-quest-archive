==Objectives==
Collect 16 Aqir Bits.
* [[Aqir Bits]] (16)

==Description==
We need more [[Aqir]] samples, <name>. As many as you can get your hands on!

I've made some fascinating discoveries already, but there's so much more to learn.

With further study and a bit of good luck, perhaps we can slowly begin to uncover some of their weaknesses.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|cv=50}}
*440x [[Azerite (resource)]]
* {{cost|192|9|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained any additional samples?

==Completion==
Excellent, thank you for collecting these samples.

==Notes==
Any aqir mob has a chance to drop the quest item.
