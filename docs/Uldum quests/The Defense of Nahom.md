== Objectives ==
Speak to a {{NPC||Ramkahen Sergeant}} and succeed in the Defense of Nahom.
*The Defense of Nahom completed

== Description ==
The enemy is coming... and in great numbers.

We will get no further reinforcements. Let us hope we can stop the [[Neferset]] advance.

If [[Nahom]] falls, [[Ramkahen]] will follow.

Go outside and speak to one of my sergeants when you're ready. I will help you command the forces we have to the best of my ability.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|18}}

== Progress ==


== Completion ==
We did it, <name>! We held Nahom.

== Notes ==
Head outside and speak to any of the sergeants. Players have access to three abilities:
*{{abilities|Move}}
*{{abilities|Volley}}
*{{abilities|Sun's Radiance}}
This fight works much like the fight in [[Salhet the Tactician]] did. Move the infantry about to protect the archers so they have can get their volleys off unimpeded. If the Neferset send in a large group, fall back and use the Sun's Radiance move to both heal friendly units and knock back enemies.
The first waves are mere footsoldiers, then a few Enscorceled Colossi, then finally the Greater Colossus.
:{{text|bossemote|The enemy approaches. Use the Move ability to move the Ramkahen Champions to the southern ramp.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Use your archers to support your infantry. A few volleys of flaming arrows will take down most groups.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Use the Sun's Radiance ability if you get overwhelmed! it will heal your units and deal terrible damage to the opponent.}}

On complete, Salhet offers [[The Push Westward]], which continues the chain. The Sun Priest, on the other hand, offers [[The Curse of the Tombs]], which starts a short side chain.

==Progression==
{{Down with Neferset City}}
