Defeat 4 [[rare]] [[Amathet]] enemies in [[Uldum]].

==Description==
On the surface the Amathet appear to be unwavering, but all [[soldier]]s have their breaking point. We need to send a message to their forces that we are not to be trifled with.

Seek out the strongest of their numbers and bring them down in front of their eyes.

We will show them the strength of Uldum!
