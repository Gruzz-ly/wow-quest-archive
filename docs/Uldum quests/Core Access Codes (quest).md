==Objectives==
Obtain the Core Access Codes from [[Twizzleflux the Insane]].
*[[Core Access Codes]] {{co|73.3|72.7|Uldum}}
*[[Mech Control Scrambler]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Cursed expedition|expedition]]'s numbers are extremely large, user <name>.

Dealing with them by conventional means would take you an estimated 2,700,136.5 hours.

We can make use of a powerful energy held within the expedition's [[M.A.C. Diver|crawler vehicle]].

We will need the [[Fusion Core|fusion core]]'s access codes to accomplish this.

Mekgineer Twizzleflux has these codes and can be found at the [[Starwatch Tower]] to the southeast.

I've uploaded jamming frequencies to a scrambler. Use it to temporarily disable Twizzleflux's defenses.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
Did you succeed, <name>? I estimated your chances of survival at 68.5%.

==Completion==
Excellent job, <name>. We must obtain access to the fusion core now.

==Notes==
[[File:Curse of the Tombs.jpg|thumb|Twizzleflux cursing the Expedition Members.]]
Pick up [[A Disarming Distraction]] before heading out. Head south. Twizzleflux is standing at {{co|73.3|72.7|Uldum}} at the southeast end of the ridge high above the [[Vir'naal River Delta]]. Use the Mech Control Scrambler to stun him for 6 seconds. Take this time to unload and get away. The item has a 14 second cooldown, so plan wisely.
:{{text|yell|[[Expedition Member]]|Twizzleflux! What insanity are you up to? We brought the additional crew you requested, but there is no... research going on here. Only madness!}}
:{{text|yell|Twizzleflux the Insane|Hahahah!}}
:''Twizzleflux channels "Curse of the Tombs" into the Expedition Members, turning them into [[Cursed Expedition Member]]s!''
:{{text|yell|Twizzleflux the Insane|Fools! It is too late for them. And it is too late for all of you! You will join us and together we will unearth secrets that will unravel this world!}}
:{{text|yell|Twizzleflux the Insane|And you... are next!}}

On using the scrambler:
:{{text|yell|Twizzleflux the Insane|Gah!!! What... how did you...?}}
