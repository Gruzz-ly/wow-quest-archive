'''Easy Money''' is the required breadcrumb to start the [[Uldum quests|Uldum storyline]]. None of the earlier quests in the chain are required as Adarrah will offer this quest to any player who has reached level 83 and can find her in [[Thistleshrub Valley]] in the southwest corner of [[Tanaris]].

== Objectives ==
Accompany {{NPC||Adarrah}}'s caravan into [[Uldum]].
*Caravan Escorted

== Description ==
Well, hello there!

Whatever brought you, I'm so glad that you're here! My friends will never admit to it, but we could really use a hand.

The ancient region of Uldum has been exposed! Treasures beyond your wildest dreams, free for the taking!

We just need a bit of an escort, what with the [[bandit]]s and all...

You'll accompany us, won't you?

You're welcome to all the loot you can haul off!

== Completion ==
Smells like someone else was in this cell recently.

Gross!

==Notes==
Try to hop on {{NPC||Lady Humps}} next to Adarrah to start the cutscene.
:''Adarrah runs over to the player and laughs.''
:{{text|bossemote|Adarrah|No, no, silly <race>...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Adarrah|No one rides the Lady!}}
:''Adarrah runs off to hop on her camel as the caravan sets off, the player conveying a "then where do I sit?" expression.  The player walks to the back of the wagon as it passes and hops in instead.''
:''[[Budd Nedreck]] brings up the rear on a camel, waves to the player, greets them then fist pumps.'' 
:{{text|bossemote|Budd|Ahoy!}}
:''The camera pulls away to show the pass to Uldum and the scene fades to black.  Having passed through the [[Gate of Unending Cycles]] and passing by [[Khartut's Tomb]], the caravan is ambushed by a pygmies!''
:{{text|bossemote|Sultan Oogah|Attack!}}
:''The caravan members cower in fear. Despite the player's defiance via <code>/insult</code>, the members of the caravan are quickly surrounded, everyone is netted and subdued.  One pygmy turns to another.''
:{{text|bossemote|Pygmy Ambusher|How many coconuts can we get for the ugly one?}}
:''Another fade to black. This time the caravan members are found imprisoned in the [[Lost City of the Tol'vir]], after being handed off to the [[Neferset tribe]] by the Pygmy Ambushers.  Two of the pygmies walk off, their fee having been agreed to.''
:{{text|bossemote|Pygmy Ambusher|THREE?  He woulda paid five, easy...  Dummy!}}
:''The cutscene ends with the player and Adarrah imprisoned inside a locked cage.''
Talk to Adarrah to complete the quest.

''On complete:''
:''Adarrah breaks out her lockpicking tools and goes to work on the cage.''
:{{text|say|Adarrah|Please don't break... please don't break....}}
:''She picks the lock and the door opens!''
:{{text|say|Adarrah|Crap!  That was my last lock pick!}}
:{{text|say|Adarrah|Here comes the guard, <name>!  Take him out!}}
: ''Adarrah stealths.''
:''A {{NPC||Neferset Jailer}} walks over and aggroes the player.  Kill it.''
:{{text|say|Adarrah|Well done!  I was about to jump in!  But it looked like you had it under control.}}
:{{text|say|Adarrah|That cat-creature chained back there looks like he wants to talk.  Maybe he can help us... but be careful.}}

Speak with {{NPC||Prince Nadun}} to start [[Traitors!]]
