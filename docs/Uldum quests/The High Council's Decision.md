:{{text|say|King Phaoris|On the matter of war against the rebel tribe of Neferset... has each member of the High Council reached a decision?}}
:{{text|say|High Commander Kamses|Yes, your majesty. The Sword of Ramkahen casts its vote in favor of war. Your armies are standing at the ready.}}
:{{text|say|Vizier Tanotep|The Voice of Ramkahen casts its vote in favor of war as well.}}
:{{text|say|High Priest Amet|The Faith of Ramkahen... abstains.}}
:{{text|say|High Priest Amet|In my visions, negotiations with the enemy brought our people fleeting peace... followed by terrible betrayal and destruction.}}
:{{text|say|High Priest Amet|But war, waged by a leader reluctantly following protocol, brought an even swifter demise to our nation.}}
:{{text|say|High Priest Amet|Only one vision offered a faint glimmer of hope. And in that vision... the High Council did not make this decision for you, Phaoris.}}
:{{text|say|Ramkahen Envoy|My liege, a skirmish along the Neferset border just occurred. A patrol led by your brother was involved...}}
:{{text|say|Ramkahen Envoy|He's been... mortally wounded, sir.}}
:{{text|say|King Phaoris|[[Prince Nadun|Nadun]]...}}
:{{text|say|King Phaoris|Commander. Move all forward regiments westward.}}
:{{text|say|King Phaoris|We attack Neferset city at first light.}}
