==Objectives==
Kill 15 flying Aqir in [[Uldum]].
* [[Aqir]] flyer slain (15)

==Description==
I'd like to see if we can get some more of these flyers in the air to drive back the aqir, but it's nearly impossible to get back to the [[Obelisk of the Sun]] with all these bugs in the air.

I think we're going to have to thin them out on the ground before we can hope to gain aerial superiority.

Can I count on you to lend a hand?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* {{cost|wr=65}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How fares the bug smashing?

==Completion==
The skies look a little clearer now, thanks to you. Hopefully it'll be enough to get our aerial efforts off the ground.

Either way, your help is appreciated.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Aqir Stinger]]s, [[Aqir Impaler]]s, [[Corpse Eater]]s, and [[Skikx'traz]].

==Patch changes==
