==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sullah]] at [[Sullah's Sideshow]].

==Description==
Wow!

It sounds like you really got their attention, <name>. We're never getting in there with them on alert like this.

There must be a way...

It's just a matter of time before [[Commander Schnottz|Schnottz]]'s men activate the obelisk and I need to research the scrolls you found. I need you to figure this one out without me.

Sullah has connections in these parts. Maybe he has a solution for getting us inside.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|8600}} (or {{coppercost|10450}} at max level)

==Completion==
You know, I believe I have just the thing!
