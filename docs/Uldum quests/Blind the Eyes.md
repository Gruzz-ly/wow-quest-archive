==Objectives==
Kill 6 Foul Observers in the [[Akhenet Fields]] in [[Uldum]].
* [[Foul Observer]] slain (6)

==Description==
Strange forces have been interfering with my visions of late. The ever-watching eyes pierce through the veil, shattering my clairvoyance.

The eyes of our enemy peer into our very souls and pierce our minds. We must rip them out, if we truly wish to be rid of the curse on this land.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* {{cost|wr=55}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
The eyes are closed, and my clairvoyance returns.

Thank you, <class>.
