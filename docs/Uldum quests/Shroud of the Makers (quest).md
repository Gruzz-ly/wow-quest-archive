==Objectives==
Sabotage 7 Schnottz Powder Kegs.
*Powder Kegs Sabotaged x7
*[[Shroud of the Makers]] (provided)

==Description==
It is good to have friends, <name>! While kindness is its own reward, there can be tangible benefits too!

Some friends of mine recently intercepted a shipment of [[Commander Schnottz|Schnottz]]'s plunder and found something that should serve your needs nicely.

It's a piece of titan technology that renders the user nearly invisible. If you use it in the enemy camp, you might be able to rewire their explosives and make a mess of their operation.

Each charge has a limited duration, so don't stray too far from safety!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Leggings of the Vir'naal|Powderkeg Bracers|Rediscovered Delta Walkers}}
You will also receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{coppercost|104600}} at max level)

==Progress==
What's new, <name>?

==Completion==
Hah!

I heard it from here! I wish I could've been there to see it!

==Notes==
Back to the northeast over the ridge.

The obelisk area is now carpeted with [[Schnottz Elite Trooper]]s, level 85 elites with 232,000 health! Additionally, [[Myzerian]] is in dragon form and now has 2.3 million health!

Pick a safe spot to land (in a corner somewhere) and use the shroud. Note that it has a two minute duration, so move quickly! Also be warned that ''Myzerian can see through the cloak'', so avoid him at all costs! Pets are not affected by the invisibility shield, and thus will draw aggro, so dismiss them before heading in.

Summoning a mount will not break stealth until the cast completes, so it is possible to trigger a powder keg, summon a flying mount and fly away if need be without arousing an attack from the elite guards.

Another cutscene once all seven have been tampered with: The player is again running off back toward the oasis. The camera pans back to show the area surrounding the obelisk. All is peaceful as Myzerian circles the area, when suddenly, everything explodes! Myzerian looks like he's been killed.

Players wind up in front of Harrison when the cutscene concludes.
