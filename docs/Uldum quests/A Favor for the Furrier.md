== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Desert Coyote Furs.
*[[Desert Coyote Pelt]] x5

== Description ==
{{NPC||Commander Schnottz||The commander}} can be most generous to those who demonstrate their loyalty, and I know of something that you can do to curry favor with him.

Before building up his... eh... workforce, he dealt in the furs of animals.

He is quite skilled in the art of [[leatherworking]]. The furrier can do wonders with even the most tattered pelts.

The dried oasis to the east is said to be home to a rare breed of coyote.

Their furs would make a very thoughtful gift.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Pristine Coyote Spaulders|Flenser's Leggings|Ankh-Inscribed Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Were you successful in your hunt?

== Completion ==
Oh, these are exquisite!

The commander will be able to make a winter uniform with these.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Desert Fox]] from Schnottz before heading out. Fly east past the [[Ruins of Ammon]] to the [[Cradle of the Ancients]]. Then start killing coyotes. Also, kill a [[Diseased Vulture]] to start [[Dirty Birds]].

==Progression==
{{Schnottz's Landing}}
