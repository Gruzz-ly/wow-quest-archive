==Objectives==
Collect 7 Ancient Copper Scrolls.
*[[Ancient Copper Scroll]] x7

==Description==
There are just a few specific pieces of information that I'm missing.

Once those blanks are filled, we'll be ready to activate the final obelisk. Then, it'll be a race to discover the [[Coffer of Promise]] before {{NPC||Commander Schnottz||Schnottz}} and his cronies can.

Those fools are excavating this site as fast as they can. They're ruining more than they're looting!

Go to the obelisk and rummage through their booty, <name>.

See if you can find our missing pieces.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{coppercost|104600}} at max level)

==Progress==
Were you able to find anything interesting, <name>?

==Completion==
<Harrison quickly skims through the scrolls.>

Yes... yes... perfect!

I'll need some time to make sense of these, but the information is there.

Good work, <name>!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Reduced Productivity]] before heading out.

Up and over the ridge down to the [[Obelisk of the Moon]]. Kill all the Schnottz employees, but steer clear of {{NPC||Myzerian}}, a level 85 elite with 387,000 health buffed with Ward of the Worldbreaker, which regenerates 50,000 health every 5 sec.

Pillaged Loot Sacks litter the ground, which contain the scrolls.

After collecting the scrolls and killing the Schnottz employees, a cutscene triggers automatically:
:''The player is seen running back around the ruins to the northeast heading back in the direction of the oasis. The camera pans back to the obelisk area, which is littered with the corpses of employees. An overseer walks out and sees the spilled blood.''
:{{text|yell|Schnottz Overseer|Warning! Warning! Intruder alert! Intruder alert!}}
:''A squadron of Schnottz Elites pour out of the building as the camera pans over to Myzerian, as he shifts to his dragon form and takes to the air.''
Players automatically wind up back in front of Harrison upon the conclusion of the cutscene.

==Progression==
{{Vir'sar and beyond}}
