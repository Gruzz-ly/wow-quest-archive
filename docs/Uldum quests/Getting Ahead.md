==Objectives==
Collect 1 Goliath Trophy from [[Aqir Goliath]]s in [[Uldum]].
* [[Goliath Trophy]]
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
Morale's been down at the camp lately. Funny how getting chewed on by some bugs can spoil the mood of a place.

I've got an idea to perk the troops back up, though. We need a trophy!

See if you can get me the head of one of those big tanky-looking ones so we can put it on display to show these bugs that we mean business! Just try to make sure it's not too mangled, okay?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Show me what ya got!

==Completion==
Wow, that thing is massive!

If a giant severed bug head doesn't lift the troops' spirits, I don't know what will!
