==Objectives==
Collect 10 pieces of Amathet Armor from armored [[Amathet]] [[tol'vir]] in [[Uldum]].
* [[Amathet Armor]] (10)

==Description==
Fighting a war on several fronts has taken its toll on our supplies. Our [[Smith|blacksmiths]] cannot repair and replace our [[soldier]]s' armor quickly enough, which is leaving us ill-equipped to face so many foes.

Though the Amathet's armor is ancient, it is [[titan]]-forged and formidable. If we were able to salvage any, it could prove very useful to our defensive efforts.

Can you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you returned with the armor?

==Completion==
Thank the Light you've returned! Our soldiers need this armor badly.
  
Your efforts will safeguard the lives of many in Ramkahen, <class>.
