==Objectives==
Obtain the [[Sultan's Staff]] from [[Sultan Oogah]], then use the Elaborate Disc to create the Shaft of the Stars.
*[[Shaft of the Stars]]
*[[Elaborate Disc]] (provided)

==Description==
The etching around the surface of this object indicates that it is of ancient origins, and yet, no signs of wear can be detected.

A hole on its edge, full of splintered wood, assures you that it is meant to be mounted on a wooden pole of some sort.

Before showing this staff to [[Harrison Jones|Doctor Jones]], you set off to find the missing staff.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Shardfinder Hood|Splinterproof Bracers|Staffseeker Shoulderplates}}

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
<Doctor Jones puts on his spectacles.>

Let's have a look at this. Shall we?

==Notes==
After picking up [[Field Work]] from the [[Sand Pygmy Corpse]] next to the player's unfortunate landing after [[Exploding Through]], head just to the southeast to find the Elaborate Disc, which offers this quest. Sultan Oogah can be found riding [[Skarf]] just to the east at an unnamed pygmy camp.

Killing Skarf, or any other hyena, starts another quest: [[Do the World a Favor]].
