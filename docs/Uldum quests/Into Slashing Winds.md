==Objectives==
Speak with [[Cyclonas]] on the [[Bluff of the South Wind]] in [[Uldum]].

==Description==
<Class>, I refuse to believe my Go'el is lost forever. His spirit has been scattered across the [[elemental plane]]s. If even a part of him still exists, we can find him, but I will need your help.

We will start with the [[Skywall|plane of air]].

Speak to me and we will travel to the [[Vortex Pinnacle]] together. We must speak with an elemental, Cyclonas. He's capricious, but he sees everything in the realm of air. If my love is there, Cyclonas will know what's become of him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*34700 XP (or {{coppercost|82700}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
<You feel the wind racing over your arms, your face, your weapons and armor...>

<Cyclonas is looking you over.>

==Notes==
Speak to Aggra again:
:Let me know when you are ready to travel to Uldum. We will ask Cyclonas what he knows
:{{gossip|''I am ready to travel to Uldum, Aggra.''}}

Aggra and the player teleport directly to the Bluff of the South Wind, at the southernmost tip of Uldum, just south of [[Neferset]]. Speak with Cyclonas.
:The winds are strange today. Strange indeed.

In order to complete the quest, you have to participate in combat against the various neutral elements that spawn around the platform. You do not have to tap the elementals -- merely being on their threat tables is enough.
