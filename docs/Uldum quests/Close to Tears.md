==Objectives==
Find and close 3 [[Void Tear (Uldum)|Void Tears]] in [[Uldum]].
* [[Void Keeper]] slain (3)

==Description==
Our [[warrior]]s have observed foul manifestations coming forth from numerous [[void]] tears within the surrounding jungle.

They have been but mere weaklings, clearly intended to test our defenses before the real forces arrive.

If we do not deal with this threat now, however, it will only be a matter of time until we are overrun by their fodder.

Find a way to close those [[portal]]s!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you had any luck with the portals yet?

==Completion==
That should help to hold back the tide... for now.
