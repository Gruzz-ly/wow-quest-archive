==Objectives==
Collect 30 pieces of Aqir Webbing from [[aqir]] casters in [[Uldum]].
*[[Aqir Webbing]] (30)

==Description==
One oddity I have observed about this egg is that it lacks the protective webbing commonly found throughout the aqir hives. 

I believe this webbing has protective qualities, and could be beneficial to our egg if we can acquire some.

While you're out fighting the insects, see if you can't bring back some of their webbing so we can make a proper cocoon for our growing egg.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*+900 reputation with [[Voidtouched Egg]]

==Progress==
Did you find some suitable webbing?

==Completion==
Oh, this sure is sticky! It should do the trick, though.

Here, give me a moment while I wrap the little guy up.

==Notes==
Kill the [[Aqir Voidcaster]]s and [[Aqir Dominator]]s for the webbing.
