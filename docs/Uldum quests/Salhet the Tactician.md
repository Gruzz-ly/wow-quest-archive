== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Salhet}} and slay 30 Bloodsnarl Scavengers.
*[[Bloodsnarl Scavenger]] slain x30

== Description ==
Ever since I was a cub, I've always wanted to be a general.

I was eager to join the army. But as you've seen, my combat skills are not all quite there.

This is not the first time I've been sent to kill [[hyena]]s. As a matter of fact, I get sent here so often, that I've befriended these lions and trained them to do my bidding.

They are my soldiers and at my command they will slay legions of hyenas. Watch!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Leggings of Feline Command|Great General's Crown|Salhet's Ornate Dagger}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Did you see, <name>?

== Completion ==
Not bad, huh? Maybe you can put a word in with the high commander.

Maybe he'll put us in charge of our own squad!

==Notes==
Talk to Salhet:
:Some day I'll be able to put my skills at the service of Ramkahen.
