==Objectives==
{{NPC||Sullah}} wants you to collect 5 Meat Scraps from the wildlife in [[Uldum]].
*[[Meat Scrap]] x5

==Description==
One thing about me that you might not know, ...

I come from a long line of trappers. My father taught me, as his taught him, to master the art of trapping creatures in a most merciful manner.

As any master trapper will tell you, the most important ingredient in an effective trap is the bait.

So let's start there.

Fill this bucket with the meat scraps from almost any wild creature in Uldum.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|86000}} (or {{cost|10|46}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you got enough to fill my bucket, <name>?

==Completion==
Fine work, <my boy/little lady>!

You'll master this trapping skill in no time.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Camelraderie]] and [[Unlimited Potential (quest)]] before heading out.

Head south for camels, pygmies and wildlife.

Just about every beast in Uldum counts, excluding snake-types.

Sullah offers [[Jonesy Sent For You]] upon the completion of any of these three quests.
