==Objectives==
Kill Ruinator Xok'nixx.
* [[Ruinator Xok'nixx]] slain

==Description==
[[Ar'kali the Dervish|Ar'kali]] and a group of our [[warrior]]s are engaged with a most behemothic creature in the heart of the [[Ruins of Ammon|ruins]].

She can hold her own against nearly any foe, but I fear it is only a matter of [[time]] before this monster is able to wear them down.

Although the creature is occupied for now, if our warriors fall, the ruins will be lost to us.

Please, make haste, with your help they can surely fell this titanic foe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
How is the situation within the ruins?

==Completion==
You are a capable fighter. Thank you for assisting our warriors!
