==Objectives==
Collect 6 Writs of the Sun King from Suntouched Amathet in [[Uldum]].
* [[Writ of the Sun King]] (6)

==Description==
Very little is known about the [[Sun King Nahkotep|Sun King]] that leads the [[Amathet]]. Our observations suggest that those closes to him are the "Suntouched," a unique caste of [[solar magic]] practitioners.

I would like very much to learn more about this Sun King, but unlike some members of the [[Explorer's League]], I'm not willing to risk the lives of my researchers to do so. 

You seem to be able to hold your own, though. If you happen upon any records about the Sun King, I'd gladly take them off your hands.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* 325x [[Coalescing Visions]]
* Random [[War Resources]], [[Azerite (resource)]], or [[Money]]
* +125 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you found anything interesting?

==Completion==
The markings on these are fascinating!

I'll have my researchers begin deciphering these right away!

==Patch changes==
