'''The Incredible Egg''' is the beginning quest for eventually obtaining the [[Shadowbarb Hatchling]] battle pet. It is started by the [[Voidtouched Egg]] found at [[Ankhaten Harbor]] in [[Uldum]].

==Objectives==
Bring the [[Voidtouched Egg]] to [[H'partho Ardoros|H'Partho Adoros]]{{Sic}} in [[Ramkahen]].

==Description==
<The [[aqir]] seem to have been in the process of empowering this [[egg]] with [[void]] [[magic]].

It looks to be far from hatching, so it should be safe to study to find out what they were planning to do with it.

Someone in the [[Explorer's League]] might be interested in taking a look.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}

==Completion==
Fascinating! You say that the aqir were trying to empower this egg?

You did the right thing by bringing this egg into my care. Just think of the wonders we'll uncover when it hatches!

You look worried.

==Notes==
A N'Zoth [[Assaults|Assault]] does not need to be active.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|H'partho Ardoros|Let's just make a nice and cozy home for you right... here!}}
:''H'partho places the egg on a nearby pedestal.''
