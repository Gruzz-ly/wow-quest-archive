==Objectives==
Scout the [[Amathet]] territories with [[High Explorer Dellorah]] in [[Uldum]].
* [[Obelisk of the Stars]] Scouted
* [[Tombs of the Precursors]] scouted
* [[Cursed Landing]] scouted
* [[Halls of Origination]] scouted

==Description==
On behalf of the [[Explorer's League]], I'd like tae thank ye for helping establish the [[Uldum Accord]] and buying us some cooperation from [[Ramkahen]].

In the interest of better understanding our foes, Ramkahen has allowed the exploring of the Amathet tombs. Unfortunately, though, their forces are spread too thin to provide protection.

I was hopin' ye could help out with that.

Think ye could spare some time tae see what they're all about? We can start with an aerial look.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
To the skies!

==Completion==
So much tae take in! I just wish it wasn't so hard tae write notes on [[gryphon]]-back.

Still, I think we've only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.

==Notes==
High Explorer Dellorah will accompany the [[adventurer]] during this quest. She'll use a {{item|Reins of the Black Riding Goat|Black Riding Goat}} and an unequipped {{item|Reins of the Proudmoore Sea Scout|Proudmoore Sea Scout}} model for mounts. You'll also be able to conveniently turn in her other quests to her while you're out and about, and she'll contribute ranged DPS with a rifle.
