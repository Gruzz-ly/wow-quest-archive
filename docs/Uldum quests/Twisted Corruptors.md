==Objectives==
Kill 10 fleshbeasts in [[Uldum]].
* [[Fleshbeast]]s slain  (10)

==Description==
While the fleshbeasts that accompany the invading forces appear to be no more than a nuisance, they carry within themselves a deep connection to the corrupting powers of the [[Old God]]s.

Like a pestilence, they spread the [[N'Zoth]]'s corruption wherever they tread, slowly twisting the very land to their form.

They must be eradicated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|203|80}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Uldum breathes a sigh of relief with each twisted manifestation of N'Zoth slain.

==Notes==
*Kill: [[Burbling Fleshbeast]]s, [[Ravenous Fleshbeast]]s, [[Disfigured Fleshbeast]]s, [[Amalgamation of Flesh]], [[Corrupted Fleshbeast]]s, [[Deranged Fleshbeast]]s, and [[Emaciated Fleshbeast]]s.

==Patch changes==
