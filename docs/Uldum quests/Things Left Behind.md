==Objectives==
Collect 3 Wastewander Supplies from [[Infested Cache]]s in [[Uldum]].
* [[Wastewander Supplies]] (3)

==Description==
The invading [[aqir]] forced the [[Wastewander]]s to flee many of our [[settlement]]s in Uldum. In our haste to escape, much was left behind.

I understand you intend to take the fight to the beasts. While you're there, could you keep an eye out for any of the supplies we had to leave behind?

You can keep anything of use to you, of course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|196|16}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find anything?

==Completion==
You found the supplies? Thank goodness!

The desert nights can be punishing on the unprepared. These will help ensure our survival out here.

The Wastewanders owe you much, <class>.
