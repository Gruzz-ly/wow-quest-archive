==Objectives==
Take [[Myzerian]]'s Head to [[Sullah]] at [[Sullah's Sideshow]].
*[[Myzerian's Head]]

==Description==
The head of one of [[Deathwing]]'s most formidable [[black dragon]]s is now in your possession.

While many in [[Azeroth]] would pay dearly for such an artifact, something tells you that it belongs in a museum for all to see and remember.

[[Harrison Jones]] is likely to have the proper connections.

Sullah would certainly be happy to deliver it to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|258000}}
{{itembox||Inferno Ruby|Amberjewel|Ocean Sapphire}}

==Progress==
You took down that dragon!?

Remarkable! 

==Completion==
Quite an accomplishment, <name>.

I'll be certain that this gets to Harrison when his expedition here is concluded.

==Notes==
This will involve kiting. Lots of kiting. Wait until after [[Shroud of the Makers (quest)]] to attempt, as Myzerian has a full-heal self-buff that ticks every five seconds in human form, and while at full strength in dragon form, cannot be taken below 1HP.

Weakened, [[Myzerian]] is down to 767,151 of his 2.3 million health and there are no other elites to contend with. He can also be affected by most snares and stuns. See his article for tactics and strategy, but his abilities in his weakened state are listed here for convenience:
*{{Abilities|Black Cleave|icon=spell shadow chilltouch|id=90075|range=Melee|Inflicts weapon damage plus additional damage to an enemy and its nearest allies, affecting up to 3 targets. Enemies hit by this ability also suffer periodic Shadow damage every 3 sec for 12 sec.|notes=Next melee}}
