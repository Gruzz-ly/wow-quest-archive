==Objectives==
Kill 8 Amathet Bowmen in [[Uldum]].
* [[Amathet Bowman]] slain (8)

==Description==
The [[archer]]s of [[Ramkahen]] are highly skilled, but the bows of the [[Amathet]] have the advantage of range. This makes our incursions into their territory highly dangerous.

You have a knack for fighting behind enemy lines. If you could thin out their ranks, it could provide us an opportunity to push their lines back for once.

Will you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must disrupt the Amathet's archers if we ever wish to gain any ground.

==Completion==
The Amathet's arrows no longer darken our skies.

We must take this opportunity to strike! 

==Notes==
The archers are found in eastern Uldum.

==Patch changes==
