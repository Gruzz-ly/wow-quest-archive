==Objectives==
{{NPC||Harrison Jones||Harrison}} wants you to speak to {{NPC||Sullah}} at [[Oasis of Vir'sar]].

==Description==
I need to unpack and look around the area a bit. In the meantime, I have an old friend I'd like you to meet.

Sullah and I go way back. He's a man who can be trusted, and that's pretty rare these days.

Why don't you go on over and introduce yourself.

==Completion==
Welcome <class>!

You and I are going to be good friends! I can tell already.

==Progression==
{{Vir'sar and beyond}}
