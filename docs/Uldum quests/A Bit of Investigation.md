==Objectives==
Collect 16 Aqir Bits.
* [[Aqir Bits]] (16)

==Description==
<Name>, this may be the discovery of a lifetime!

I cannot yet say with absolute certainty, but I have a suspicion that these insects are known as the [[aqir]].

The [[Explorers' League|League]] has few intact records, but the last mention of these creatures describes a [[Aqir and Troll War|great war]] waged between the [[C'Thrax]]xi, aqir, and early [[troll]] [[Empire of Zul|civilizations]].

We had assumed they were driven to extinction, but they may have simply been... rebuilding.

Could you please collect some samples for me to examine?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to acquire the samples?

==Completion==
Marvelous! Your contributions to the League will be duly noted.

==Progression==
{{Aqir Offensive}}

==Patch changes==
