== Objectives ==
Acquire the Broken Goggles.
*[[Broken Spectacles]]

== Description ==
This unfortunate explorer has clearly suffered a bit of bad luck in the recent past.

Prudence dictates that you perform the unenviable task of searching the corpse for clues that might shed light on your surroundings...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

== Progress ==
Any news, <name>?

== Completion ==
Odd...

It looks as if someone used gemstones as lenses.

I should be able to fix them without too much trouble.

== Notes ==
The Schnottz Scout can be found by the southern hieroglyph on the west side of the chamber. Also pick up [[Be Prepared]] from the [[Decrepit Skeleton]] on the east side of the chamber, at {{co|65.2|33.8|Uldum}} near the other southern hieroglyph.

Interact with the scout again:
:After a quick assessment, you determine that this fellow has expired within the last several hours.

The goggles are there to complete the quest, but take the [[Scout's Journal]] too:
{{Book|Scout's Journal|content=
I've found an incredible site!

The whole area pulsates with the hum of ancient architecture.

If it were not so late in the day, I would investigate the chamber immediately!

Sleeping, tonight, will be a struggle...


A most productive day, today!

The chamber is indeed of ancient origin, and houses a magnificent mechanism which seems to be in disrepair.

I will investigate further tomorrow.

This discovery will surely force {{NPC||Commander Schnottz||Schnottz}} to take notice of me!

How could he deny me a promotion after something like this?


It has taken me all day to wrestle the cipher from these hieroglyphs:

:Through the eyes of blue is starlight revealed.

:Ten shards, one rod, and the veil disappears.

Forget Schnottz and his empty promises!

If I can unravel this riddle, its secrets will be mine!


I've done it!

Using sapphire from the chamber's adornments, I have fashioned a pair of goggles. With them, I am able to see things previously hidden from view.

Amazing!

With luck, my next entry will find me a newly rich man!}}
