== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Prince Nadun}} at the [[Arsad Trade Post]] outside [[Mar'at]] in [[Uldum]]. 

== Description ==
Listen, <name>. What struck [[Orsis]] was no natural sandstorm. It was the minions of {{NPC||Al'Akir}}. 

The [[elemental lord]] of air is firmly allied with {{NPC||Deathwing}} and it was only a matter of time before he set his subjects upon my people. 

Orsis has been attacked as a warning to us. We must move quickly to offer our brethren what aid we can. 

Meet with Nadun at the Arsad Trade Post outside of Mar'at. I will begin preparations to take care of the displaced and wounded. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

== Completion ==
Do you see what Deathwing's minions have done? Great Orsis is now all but buried in the sand!

==Progression==
{{Escape and retribution}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
