==Objectives==
Speak with [[Cyclonas]] to secure passage to [[Thrall]]. Then, fight the [[air elemental|wind elementals]] that torment him until he is freed.
*Protect Thrall from the elements

==Description==
I do know the one you seek... but I do not know if it is wise for you to follow him. He has cast himself into the cyclone. The winds now tear at his body and mind, leaving nothing but shreds of flesh and doubt.

Chasing after him would only expose you to the same fate. The wind's edge leaves nothing uncut.

You have been warned. Now what will you do?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*86750 XP (or {{coppercost|206700}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Earthen Ring]]

==Progress==
Stay vigilant, <name>! Do not give up on Go'el.

==Completion==
What is this... water?

==Notes==
Speak to Cyclonas again:
:The winds are strange today. Strange indeed.
:{{gossip|I am ready, elemental. Take me to Thrall.}}
Cyclonas sends the player in a whirling vortex to the [[Cloudtop Terrace]].
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Cyclonas|Clever fleshling... soaring in-between the winds of fate. Yes, I know the one you seek... the orc-father... Earthbinder...

I sense him nearby - raging within a tempest of his own fear. You may go to him... at your peril.}}
</poem>

The player and Aggra reach the terrace.

{{Text|Say|Aggra|We've found him! But this tempest he's become... I'll try to calm it - to reach him somehow.}}

Essences of Doubt, ''neutral'' level 85 air revenants with 77,490 health circle the terrace. They have the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Charge|range=5-30|Charges the target, moving quickly to their location.}}
*{{abilities|Lightning Bolt|range=40|Blasts an enemy with lightning, inflicting Nature damage.|notes=3 sec cast. Interruptible. Hits for ~8000 Nature}}
*{{abilities|Seeds of Dout|range=20|Shocks an enemy, then inflicts additional Nature damage every 3 sec. for 12 sec.|notes=1.5 sec cast. Hits for ~3000 Nature, ticks for ~1100 Nature.}}
*{{abilities|Summon Twister|range=30|Summon a cyclone near the target's location.|notes=Instant. If the twister catches up with the player, it triggers...}}
**{{abilities|Twisting Winds|Powerful winds deal 17205 to 17805 Nature damage and knock players up in the air, slowing fall speed.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~11k Nature despite the tooltip.}}
*{{abilities|Uncertain Strike|range=Melee|Slams the opponent, causing weapon damage plus an additional amount.|notes=3.5 sec cast. Uninterruptible. Hits for ~25k on cloth}}
*{{abilities|Invocation of Air|Harness the power of the gusting winds. Melee, ranged, and spell-casting speed increased by 50%.|notes=Instant. This is a ''buff on the player'' cast by the essence. Take advantage of it.}}

Two Shadows of Doubt, ''neutral'' level 85 elite air elementals with 542,000 health are on either side of Thrall, tormenting him. Each essence killed advanced the progress bar by 5%, so it will take 20 non-elites to complete the quest. Elites are worth 15%. This is not by any sense timed, so pull an elemental, kill it, then heal up and kill another. Progress is also individual in the sense that only kills in which the player is on the aggro list will advance the progress bar.

As players progress, Thrall keeps announcing his doubts for the world to see.

{{text|say|Aggra|I would have it no other way.}}
{{text|say|Thrall|Aggra, I... I can't hold on... AAH!}}
''Thrall disappears in a burst of water.''
</poem>

Speak to Aggra to continue. On complete:

{{Text|Say|Aggra|The Twilight Curse is shifting Go'el between elemental states! Before he vanished he took on the aspect of water. We must hurry to him...}}
