== Objectives ==
{{NPC||Belloc Brightblade}} wants you to collect 10 Trooper Uniforms.
*[[Trooper Uniform]] x10

== Description ==
We have a strict policy among our ranks, one that we take most seriously.

Our troops are to dress in official uniform at all times. This helps with organization, friendly fire incidents are reduced, and it keeps the troops looking wonderful!

We call it, Fashionism.

We've been running low on uniforms lately. I must ask that you recover from the troopers that have fallen in the line of duty.

You should find plenty of the poor fellows east of here at the [[Ruins of Ammon]].

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Impeccable Uniform Gauntlets|Waistguard of Fallen Hearts|Bullet-Pierced Chestplate}}
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to recover the uniforms we need?

== Completion ==
Most efficient work, <class>.

You should rise rapidly through the ranks.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Idolatry]] and [[Angered Spirits]] before heading out. Then head east to the [[Ruins of Ammon]]. Corpses litter the ground.

==Progression==
