==Objectives==
Free 8 Enslaved Tol'vir in [[Uldum]].
* [[Enslaved Tol'vir]] freed (8)

==Description==
The [[Amathet]]'s conquest of eastern Uldum was sudden, and we were unable to reach some of our farthest settlements in time.

Fortunately, many of the [[tol'vir]] who lived in the conquered territories were not killed, instead being [[Slave|put to work]] under the Amathet's whip.

We must take any opportunity we can to free them and return them to their homes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

We have seen the return of many of our people, thanks to you.

You have my gratitude.
