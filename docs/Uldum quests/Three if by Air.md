==Objectives==
Use the Signal Flares at the [[Temple of Uldum]].
*North Signal Flare Placed
*West Signal Flare Placed
*South Signal Flare Placed
*[[Harrison's Signal Flares]]

==Description==
I had planned on bringing the coffer back to my lab for study, but it seems [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] here has different ideas.

He thinks he knows how to put a stop to [[Deathwing]]'s plans here in [[Uldum]].

My buddy, Jock, is standing by with the transport, just waiting for our signal.

Take these flares and plant them around the perimeter to let him know that we're ready.

==Completion==
Nice work, <lad/lass>.

Looks as tho everything made the trip in one piece.

I'm beginnin' ta see why junior keeps ye around.

==Notes==
There are three Signal Flare Positions marked in a triangle around the coffer. Interact with them. Once the third flare is placed, a quick cutscene takes place. The three flares light and Jock flies out of the north to pick it up. When the cutscene ends, Brann, Harrison, the player and the Coffer of Promise are all located in the [[Cradle of the Ancients]] just south of the door leading into the mountain.

Talk to Brann to continue.
