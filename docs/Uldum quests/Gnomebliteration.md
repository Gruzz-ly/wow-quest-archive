==Objectives==
Obliterate 512 [[Crazed Gnome]]s.
*Crazed Gnome obliterated (512)

==Description==
I have downloaded my program to the [[Fusion Core|fusion core]] and have complete control over it.

I've created a small pocket of air inside to avoid vaporizing user <name>.

I will yield control of all movement functions so I can dedicate my cycles to keeping the core stable.

My analysis reveals you might feel... "guilt" as a result of such high fatality numbers.

User <name>, you must be assured that [[Cursed expedition|expedition]] members are without hope.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Kata-Mary Crown|Spaulders of Rolling Incineration|Fireball Treads|Gloves of Gnomebliteration}}
You will also receive: {{cost|17|20}}

==Progress==
The expedition members' demise is unfortunate.

==Completion==
It is done, user <name>. I thank you for your assistance with this unfortunate task.

==Notes==
[[File:Gnomebliteration 2.jpg|thumb|Wheee.]]
On accept, the player character immediately casts "Gnomebliteration", giving them control of the [[Fusion Core]] which launches off of the [[M.A.C. Diver]] and starts unstoppably rolling across the ground, leaving a trail of scorched earth in its wake. The [[Cursed Landing]] and adjacent areas (the [[Trail of Devastation]] and the [[Steps of Fate]]) have been phased to be filled to the brim with [[Crazed Gnome]]s and [[Crazed Spiderbot Pilot]]s. Steer the Fusion Core into them to "obliterate" them, incinerating and sending them flying out of the way with loud screams or rolling them up into the core. The core has two abilities:
*{{Abilities|Fusion Thrust|id=261331|Thrusts the Fusion Core forward.|icon=spell_fire_fireball02|notes=1 sec cooldown.}}
*{{Abilities|Exit Fusion Core|id=261345|Leave the Fusion Core.|icon=achievement_bg_returnxflags_def_wsg}}

Fusion Thrust launches the core into a jump and can be spammed for infinite air time. Should the player exit or somehow lose the core, they get immediately transported back to atop the [[M.A.C. Diver]] and can talk to the Fusion Core to re-enter:
:{{Gossip|We need to give this another try.}}

Entering water also immediately ejects the player. Upon completing the objective, the player also gets automatically ejected back to the quest giver.

==Trivia==
*As referenced by the name of the [[Kata-Mary Crown]], the gameplay of this quest is inspired by the ''{{Wp|Katamari}}'' game franchise, in which players control a growing ball to roll up objects, creatures, and buildings.
*The Alliance [[Zuldazar]] quest [[Fragment of the Firelands]] and its world quest version [[Gobliteration]] can be seen as spiritual successors to this quest, only with [[goblin]]s as the targets instead of gnomes.
