== Objectives ==
Obtain 8 Atulhet's Record Fragments.
*[[Atulhet's Record Fragment]] x8

== Description ==
There is an old story about [[Nahom]]. It speaks of how a powerful prophet named {{NPC||Atulhet}} held off troves of enemies by channeling the power of the sun through this very temple.

Most believe the tale to be a legend, but that power... would certainly be useful to us now.

The vile [[Neferset]] have ransacked Atulhet's tomb. They've taken any artifacts of power and shattered the tablets that en code his memories.

Go to the [[Tombs of the Precursors]] to the east and retrieve any fragments that you find.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9}}

== Progress ==
Did you find them, <name>? Were they salvageable?

== Completion ==
Excellent. Let's see if we can find anything of importance.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Punish the Trespassers]] before heading out. Head just east to the tombs, which are above ground southeast of the pyramid. Fragments litter the ground and there are plenty of Neferset in the area.

==Progression==
{{Down with Neferset City}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
