==Objectives==
[[File:Second Bomb Cluster.jpg|thumb|Cursed Engineers at the Second Bomb Cluster.]]
Disarm the First, Second and Third Bomb Clusters and deactivate 4 Unstable Bomb Bots at the [[Tomb of the Sun King]].
*First Bomb Cluster disarmed
*Second Bomb Cluster disarmed
*Third Bomb Cluster disarmed
*[[Unstable Bomb Bot]] deactivated (4)
*[[Holographic Projector]] (provided)

==Description==
The curse has taken over the [[Cursed expedition|expedition]] members' higher brain functions, but my calculations reveal their suppressed adolescent subconscious can still be stimulated by realistic imagery.

Utilize this holo-projector to distract them.

They are currently setting up explosives at the tomb to the east to attempt to gain access to secret passages in [[Uldum]].

They seek dangerous [[re-origination]] technology beneath Uldum and must be stopped.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Brainrot Grips
|Treads of the Starry Obelisk
|Tomb-Curse Chestplate
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|50}}
*4,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Greetings, user <name>. I am happy to see you are still unaffected by the effects of the expedition curse.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.  The expedition has already doomed itself.

There is no need for it to endanger the rest of the world as well.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Core Access Codes (quest)]] before heading out. Head west. The ground is carpeted with hostile [[Cursed Engineer]]s, who hit quite hard. Luckily, the Projector can be used while in flight, so do so.

The three bomb clusters can be found in a (roughly) north-south line along the center of the Tomb of the Sun King. Check both above and below the terrace. [[Unstable Bomb Bot]]s are all over the area without a fixed position.

The projector, when dropped, creates a hologram that attracts all nearby Cursed Engineers and turns them temporarily friendly. It can display one of three options, with the following responses from the Engineers:
*The [[Epicus Maximus]], [[And a Dinosaur]], [[ROCK ON]] combination:
** {{text|say|Weaponized sharks? Why didn't I think of that!?}}
** {{text|say|ROCK ON!!!}}
** {{text|say|So... EPIC!!!}}
** {{text|say|Brilliant!}}
*An [[epic]] running [[mechanostrider]] in a blue paint job:
** {{text|say|Check out the modified leg articulation! Perfect for off-roading!}}
** {{text|say|200 horsepower, dual combustion engine with modified flux capacitors! ZOING!}}
** {{text|say|It's the TXR-5000!}}
** {{text|say|I didn't know it came in lightning-blue! AWESOME!!}}
*A dancing female [[man'ari eredar]] (using [[succubus]] sound effects):
** {{text|say|Shake it like a sine wave, baby!}}
** {{text|say|I'd like to survey those curves!}}
** {{text|say|Hubba-hubba!}}
** {{text|say|You could bounce a washer off those legs!}}
