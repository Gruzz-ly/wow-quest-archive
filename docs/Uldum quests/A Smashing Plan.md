==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Amathet Idols and 8 Suntouched Obelisks in [[Uldum]].
* [[Amathet Idol]] destroyed (8)
* [[Suntouched Obelisk]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
Reports from my scouts mention various idols and monuments that the Amathet use to channel their [[solar magic]]. 

I don't know exactly what they're up to, but we should take away any possible advantage they have. So, I want you to go over there, and break anything that looks remotely magical.

Just don't tell the [[Explorer's League]]. I'll never hear the end of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* 325x [[Coalescing Visions]]
* Random [[War Resources]], [[Azerite (resource)]], or [[Money]]
* +125 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Good work, <class>.

Slowly but surely, we chip away at the Amathet's resolve. 

==Patch changes==
