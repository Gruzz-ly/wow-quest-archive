==Objectives==
Kill 8 Scavenging Dunerunners in [[Uldum]].
* [[Scavenging Dunerunner]] slain (8)

==Description==
These mangy [[hyena]] will gnaw on anything they dig up, including priceless artifacts!

We cannae allow the history of Uldum tae go to the dogs, so tae speak.

I'm afraid we're gonna have tae thin out their numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did ye take care of the hyenas?

==Completion==
That was a regrettable thing, but necessary.

Thank ye, <name>.

==Notes==
Take both quests. Go looking for piles of Sand in the quest zone and excavate them until the artifact is uncovered so you can pick it up. Often there will be hyenas by the sand.

==Progression==
{{Mystery of the Amathet}}

==Patch changes==
