===Intro===
Speak to Harrison:
:The coffer is just beyond these ruins.

:Let's go!

:{{Gossip|I'm ready. Let's go!}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|Let's move!}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|I've got a bad feeling about this...}}
:''Harrison and the player reach the far side of the colossus to see {{NPC||Commander Schnottz}} channeling something into a device!''
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|I figured I might see you again, Schnottz.}}
:''A squadron of Schnottz Rifleman run down the steps, all targeted on Jones.''
:{{text|say|Commander Schnottz|Ve meet again, Doctor Jones! Zhanks to your vork in zhis region, my mission has become much easier.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|I know what you're up to, Schnottz! {{NPC||Deathwing}} will never have the coffer, not if I can help it!}}
:{{text|say|Commander Schnottz|Vell in zhat case, ve must ensure zhat you and your friend are out of zhe picture.}}
:''Schnottz laughs.''
:{{text|say|Commander Schnottz|Permanently!}}
:''Schnottz activates the devices, which awakens the colossus!''
:{{text|yell|Schnottz Rifleman|What... is that thing?!}}
:{{text|say|Commander Schnottz|You von't live to see your precious coffer, Jones!}}
:''Schnottz takes off up the steps to the southwest.''
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|Not so fast, Schnottz!}}
:''Jones takes off after him. As Harrison runs up the steps, a rockfall blocks off the exit!''
:{{text|bossemote|Destroy the Obsidian Colossus!}}
:{{text|yell|Commander Schnottz|Zhat vhich you seek vill soon be mine, Doctor Jones!}}
:''Schnottz gets in his hot air balloon and leaves.''

===Abilities===
The colossus has 1.5 million health and the following abilities:
*{{Abilities|Sweeping Attack|id=88102|Deals damage to enemies in front of the Colossus|range=20|icon=inv_sword_47|notes=5 sec cast. Hits for around 20,000 Physical}}
*{{Abilities|Force Punch|id=87988|Knocks away all nearby enemies with a forceful fist of force.|icon=ability_vehicle_sonicshockwave|notes=2 sec cast. Immediately followed by...}}
**{{Abilities|Shadow Storm|id=87991|Channels an immense amount of shadow energy to destroy distant enemies.|icon=spell_shadow_painspike|notes=4 sec cast. Hits for 4000-4600 Shadow damage. Launches an excessive amount of missiles in the arena, marked on the ground by purple shadow runes}}

Additionally, the eagle statues around the room have an eye-laser ability:
*{{Abilities|Focused Laser|id=64683|Inflicts Fire damage to enemies within 7 yards|icon=spell fire blueflamebolt|notes=Hits for 1100-1700 Fire}}

The player does not have to take the colossus alone, as Schnottz left a squadron of {{NPC||Schnottz Rifleman||Riflemen}} behind in his escape. They have the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic Melee|notes=Hits for 3200-4300 Physical on Colossus}}
*{{Abilities|Shoot|id=84837|range=5-30|Shoots at an enemy, inflicting Physical damage.|icon=ability_marksmanship|notes=Hits for 2800-4600 Physical on the Colossus}}
*{{Abilities|Bomb|id=8858|range=5-30|Bombs all enemies in a selected area, inflicting Fire damage.|icon=spell_fire_selfdestruct|notes=Hits for ~4600-6100 Fire}}

===Strategy===
Keep out of the eye beams. Stay behind the colossus to avoid the sweeping attack. When the force punch happens, find a safe spot not covered in purple runes. Try to ignore the Riflemen. Though they are hostile, the riflemen won't attack players directly. However, players may suffer some splash damage from the bombs targeted on the colossus.

There are Schnottz Supply Choppers circling the arena. Destroy them and they will drop supply crates. The crates either have a Berserking or a Restoration buff (much like the ones in Battlegrounds).

==Progression==
{{Temple of Uldum}}
