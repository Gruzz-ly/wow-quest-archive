==Objectives==
[[File:Thieving Little Pluckers.png|thumb|A stack of Pygmies.]]
Smash 30 [[Sand Pygmy|Sand Pygmies]] with the Tehret Dynasty Mallet.
*Thieving plucker smashed x30
*[[Tahret Dynasty Mallet]] (provided)

==Description==
I don't have the most glamorous job in the world.

I do not concern myself with the deep myseries of the halls of [[Uldum]] or what have you.

I am in charge of these grounds... and these grounds grow dates.

Now, these little date-plucking mongrels have gotten gutsy enough to stand on each other's shoulders to try and steal my precious fruit.

I will not stand for this.

Take this mallet, crafted by the [[titan]]s, blessed by the sun-kings and who-knows-what-else and smash the runts!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Progress==
Did you do it, <name>?

==Completion==
You showed those thieving little scoundrels! Great job.

==Notes==
Run just to the south. Stacks of Pygmy Thiefs are trying to get into the trees. The hammer is a point blank AoE. Run up to a stack of them and use the hammer to smash the pygmies!

==Progression==
{{Escape and retribution}}
