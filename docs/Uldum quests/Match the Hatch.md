==Objectives==
Investigate 7 Voudtouched{{sic}} [[Egg]]s in [[Uldum]].
* [[Voidtouched Egg]]s investigated (7)

==Description==
Don't fret, I'm sure no ill will become of hatching this creature. After all, the [[aqir]] can't be born evil, can they?

Of course, we have no idea how to take care of such an egg. I will need you to do some investigating.

Head back to the aqir hives and see if you can find any other, similar eggs. If we can observe how they're being treated, we might be able to apply those learnings here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +300 reputation with [[Aqir Hatchling]]

==Progress==
What have you learned among the aqir?

==Completion==
The eggs hatched while you were studying them, you say?

That's unfortunate, but it looks like you returned in one piece!

I will study these notes and see if I can learn more about our little friend here. We may just find something that can help in the hatching process.

==Notes==
Fly west from [[Ramkahen]] until you reach the [[Temple of Uldum]]. Watch out for the elite [[Aqir Dominator]]s while investigating the area. Interacting with the eggs will summon 2-3 [[Shadowbarb Stinger]]s.
