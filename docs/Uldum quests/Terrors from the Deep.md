==Objectives==
Defeat 4 [[rare]] [[Aqir]] enemies in [[Uldum]].
*Rare Aqir enemies defeated

==Description==
The Aqir threaten the livelihood of the [[Wastewander]]s with each passing day, but I have heard of greater terrors that have been unearthed with them.

Our fighters are able, but I fear what might happen if one of these ancient terrors falls upon us.

I know that you have experience putting down great foes. I would like to ask you to do the same for us.

After all, we can hardly help protect the forge if we've been decimated by some long-buried monster.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Some things should have stayed buried.

==Completion==
Uldum is a degree safer today, because of you.

I thank you on behalf of the Wastewanders.
