==Objectives==
Defeat the [[Vil'thik Hatchling]] in a pet battle with your [[Shadowbarb Hatchling]] in your party.

*Vil'thik Hatchling defeated

==Description==
Observing the combat techniques of the [[mantid]] may prove helpful for our hatchling's training, offering a different way to use the natural weapons of an insect.

I have found a mantid opponent that our hatchling could face in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]]. Take him there and see how he does.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +900 reputation with [[Shadowbarb Hatchling]]

==Progress==
How did our hatchling fare against the mantid?

==Completion==
It looks like our little guy learned much from his battle with the mantid.

No doubt he'll be ready to face fully grown opponents soon.

==Notes==
Vil'thik Hatchling is located at the [[Gate of the Setting Sun]].{{co|7.3|31.9|Vale of Eternal Blossoms}}

Your [[Shadowbarb Hatchling]] does not need to survive in order to receive credit.

==Progression==
