==Objectives==
Collect 6 Wastewander Coins.
* [[Wastewander Coin]] (6)

==Description==
It may be too late for some of our fallen brothers and sisters, but it is not too late to give solace to their families.

Every [[Wastewander]] carries with them a unique coin, signifying their status as a member of our group.

If you find any of these coins, please bring them to me and I will make sure they are properly returned to their next of kin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* 325x [[Coalescing Visions]]
* Random [[War Resources]], [[Azerite (resource)]], or [[Money]]
* +125 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
Do you have coins to return?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I will see to it that these make it into the right hands.
