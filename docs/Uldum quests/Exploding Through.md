== Objectives ==
Assist [[Harrison Jones]] at the [[Khartut's Tomb]].
*Assisted Harrsion at Khartut's Tomb.

== Description ==
What a find!

Right here... exactly where my notes predicted it would be.

With any luck, inside this chamber will lie clues to the legendary [[Coffer of the Promise]].

That's right, <name>. It's not just a myth. I believe it truly exists.

I'll explain more later. For now, just give me a hand with these explosives.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Completion ==
Shake it off, kid.

Happens to me all the time...

== Notes ==
After accepting the quest, look a few yards to the northeast to see an active Powder Keg in front of {{NPC||Harrison's Mule}}. Click it to start a cutscene. In a scene straight out of the fourth Indiana Jones movie, a fuse is lit that leads to one keg in the middle of a huge batch. With mere seconds to spare, both Harrison and the player jump into nearby chests to seal themselves from the explosion. The chests are launched south to the [[Obelisk of the Stars]], one of which takes takes out a [[sand pygmy]].
:''As the player interacts with the keg, a pygmy shoots at Harrison's Mule, spooking it. It kicks, knocking the player back into a brazier, which falls over.''
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|Whoa... easy, now.}}
:''Said brazier conveniently falls onto the fuse leading to a big pile of powder kegs. Horrified, Harrison and the player turn and run to the nearby chests.''
:{{text|yell|Harrison Jones|Quick, <name>! Into the chests!}}
:''As the camera pulls back, the kegs explode! The two chests are launched in the explosion to the south toward the [[Obelisk of the Stars]]. The player's chest takes out a sand pygmy on the ground trying to dodge, but acts like a deer in headlights. Harrison and the player get out of the chests and dust themselves off.''

Talk to Harrison to complete the quest. However, he does not offer the followup. Instead, the {{NPC||Sand Pygmy Corpse}} that the player's chest took out does. There is also an [[Elaborate Disc]] to the southeast that offers another quest.

==Trivia==
The quest is a likely reference to the "nuking the fridge" scene from [[Wikipedia:Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]].

==Progression==
{{Obelisk of the Stars}}
