== Objectives ==
Obtain the Cypher of Keset.
*[[The Cypher of Keset]]

== Description ==
<Salhet spends some time going over the tablets with the priests around him.>

It's all right here, <name>. {{NPC||Atulhet}} built a potent weapon into this temple and the only way to access it is with the correct cypher.

It is reportedly hidden in the [[Keset Pass]]. We must hope the [[Neferset]] looters haven't gotten to it yet. That's where {{NPC||Raider Lord Havat}} is operating and he's the most ruthless of the lost.

But without reinforcements, this might be our only hope for defending Nahom.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|80}}

== Progress ==
Did you retrieve the codex, <name>?

== Completion ==
It is true then? It does exist!

== Notes ==
Back to the northeast end of the tomb complex. A small pass has been cut out of the sand, where at {{co|78.2|45.7|Uldum}} waits Havat. He is a level 84 tol'vir with 128,000 health.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Salhet|It... it worked! We will defend Nahom with the power stored in this temple!}}
:''A large glowing sphere flies up into the center of the ceiling.''

==Progression==
{{Down with Neferset City}}

== Patch changes ==
