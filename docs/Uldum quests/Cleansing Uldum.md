==Objectives==
Destroy 10 Corruption Tumors in [[Uldum]].
* [[Corruption Tumor]] destroyed (10)

==Description==
Every moment that [[N'Zoth]]'s forces remain in Uldum, his corruption seeps further into the land itself.

Even if we were to drive back his minions, the damage he has done to Uldum may be irreversible.

We must seek out his corruption where it festers and eliminate it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|199|13}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must put a stop to N'Zoth's Corruption{{sic}}.

==Completion==
Even now, I sense N'Zoth's corruption waning.

You have done well.

==Patch changes==
