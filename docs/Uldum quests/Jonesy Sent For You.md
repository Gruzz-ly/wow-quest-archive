==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Harrison Jones}} in the [[Oasis of Vir'sar]].

==Description==
Listen, <name>, you may want to make your way back to Jonesy when you get a moment.

Chances are, whatever he's got to talk to you about is more pressing than anything I have for you to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|8600}} (or {{coppercost|10450}} at max level)

==Completion==
Alright, kid.

My research is complete. We're about ready to activate the final obelisk.

==Progression==
{{Vir'sar and beyond}}

==Patch changes==
