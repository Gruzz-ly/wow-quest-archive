==Objectives==
Check 8 Wastewanders in [[Orsis]].
* [[Wastewander]] examined (8)

==Description==
The bugs came from everywhere... There wasn't any time to react.

Many of my friends died where they stood, while others tried to fight with our meager tools.

I'm a coward. I fled in the commotion instead of trying to help.

Now, here I am, out of food and water and too scared to look for survivors.

Please, I beg you to help anyone you find left alive in Orsis...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
Is anyone still alive out there?

==Completion==
I am in no shape to face those creatures right now. I appreciate your help <Name>.

==Notes==
*Examine [[Wastewander Tracker (Assault in Uldum)|Wastewander Trackers]], [[Wastewander Outrider (Assault in Uldum)|Wastewander Outriders]], [[Wastewander Laborer]]s, [[Wastewander Warrior]]s, and [[Wastewander Exterminator]]s.

==Progression==
{{Aqir Offensive}}
