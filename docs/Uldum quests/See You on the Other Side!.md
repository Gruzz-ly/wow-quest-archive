==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Harrison Jones}} at the top of [[Maker's Ascent]] in [[Uldum]].

==Description==
Alright, <name>. We've bought ourselves a little breathing room, but there's no time to lose.

Follow me!

==Completion==
So far, so good...

==Notes==
The camera follows the trail of destruction up the path to the Maker's Ascent, catching up with the player near the top.

If the event is in progress, players will be behind a rock pile. Sit tight until it ends and Harrison respawns.

==Progression==
{{Temple of Uldum}}
