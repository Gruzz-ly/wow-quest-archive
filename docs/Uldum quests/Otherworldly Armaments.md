==Objectives==
Collect 12 Black Empire Armaments from [[Black Empire]] [[cultist]]s in [[Uldum]] and the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Black Empire Armament]] (12)

==Description==
To craft a saddle for your beast, I'll need some special materials. Mainly, it will require metals much lighter than what we have available.

I have noticed that the Black Empire cultists carry with them weapons made from otherworldly materials, which are impossibly light and strong.

If you could retrieve some of their weapons for me, I may be able to melt down this metal and shape it into a saddle for the aqir.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found my materials?

==Completion==
These weapons... they are both disturbing and fascinating.

I will melt them down at once. [[Daily quests|Visit me tomorrow]] to claim your saddle.
