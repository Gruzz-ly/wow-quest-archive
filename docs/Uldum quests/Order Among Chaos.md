==Objectives==
Kill 6 faceless minions of [[N'Zoth]] in [[Uldum]].
* [[N'raqi|Faceless]] minions slain (6)

==Description==
It has been a long time since the [[tol'vir]] have squared off against the forces of an [[Old God]], so our tactical knowledge of their forces is limited.

However, one tenet of combat always holds true -- striking down those that issue the orders will weaken the foe much greater than the rank and file.

I have observed that the larger faceless minions act as [[Commander (rank)|commanders]] of the Old Gods' forces. Silence them, and perhaps we can sow a different kind of chaos in their ranks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
A decisive strike against their commanders should buy us some time.

Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
*Kill: [[R'khuzj the Unfathomable]], [[Black Warden Rhothkozz]], [[Abyssal Harbinger]]s, [[Corrupted Dominator]]s, [[Mind Eater]]s, [[Faceless Jailer]]s, [[Corrupted Jailer]]s, [[Faceless Despoiler]]s,	[[Corrupted Despoiler]]s, [[Faceless Dominator]]s, and [[Corrupted Mind Eater]]s.
