==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Neferset Denizens.
* [[Neferset Denizen (Visions of N'Zoth)|Neferset Denizen]] slain (8)

==Description==
[[Scout]]s have returned recently, nearly on the verge of death, with reports that I find... disconcerting.

[[Neferset tribe|Neferset]] have been spotted wandering the streets of [[Neferset City|their city]] to the south.

This would normally be no cause for alarm, except, the Neferset were completely wiped out.

I must ask you to investigate further... and if by some foul [[magic]] these reports turn out to be true, you must do whatever you can to contain this threat!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|183|76}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you news of Neferset City?

==Completion==
I cannot believe what I am hearing...

This is truly much worse than I feared.

==Notes==
*[[Voidwarped Neferset]]s also count.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
