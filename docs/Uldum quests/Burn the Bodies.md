==Objectives==
Burn 10 [[Egg]]-bearing [[corpse]]s.
* [[Egg-bearing Corpse]] burned (10)
*[[Torch (Uldum)]] (provided)

==Description==
The bugs seem to be indiscriminately laying eggs all over the nearby corpses.

They are using them as food to spawn more of those horrible things. Disgusting!

We can mourn the dead later, but if any more bugs are allowed to hatch we may not live long enough to do so.

Burn the bodies and destroy those eggs!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Progress==
I know it's a terrible thing to ask, but it has to be done.

==Completion==
Grisly work to be sure, but we were left with no choice. Thank you <name>.
