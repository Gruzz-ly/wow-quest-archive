This quest begins from an item dropped by [[Schnottz Air Officer]]s on the [[Obelisk of the Sun]] in [[Uldum]].

== Objectives ==
Bring 'Efficient Excavations' to {{NPC||Belloc Brightblade}} in [[Schnottz's Landing]].
*[[Efficient Excavations]] (provided)

== Description ==
This manual describes outlandish theories on how to most efficiently manage large groups of workers as they engage in massive excavation projects.

After a quick skim of the material, it becomes clear to you that the author of the book is the figure in charge of the over-aggressive pillagers here.

A map on the back cover indicates that the author has a bunker in the southwest region of Uldum.

Perhaps an introduction is in order.

("You can only assume that the picture on the cover is that of the self-absorbed author.")

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||86}}

== Completion ==
Oh look, it's one of little {{NPC||Commander Schnottz||Schnottz's}} pamphlets.

I'll be taking that from you, if you don't mind.

== Notes ==
Fly southwest toward the coast. Schnottz's Landing is a decently large pirate camp in the southwest corner of the zone. Belloc can be found in one of the buildings with Commander Schnottz. He offers [[Eastern Hospitality]] next.

==Progression==
{{Obelisk of the Sun}}

At Schnottz's Landing:
