==Objectives==
Kill 12 Mangy Hyenas.
*[[Mangy Hyena]]s Eradicated x12

==Description==
[[Hyena]]s, on their best day, are a nuisance.

These foul specimens have a particularly nasty disposition, are riddled with all manner of disease, and are simply a blight on the face of dogdom.

Do the world a favor and rid the deserts of [[Uldum]] of this mangy menace.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Completion==
The world is a better place because of your deeds here today.

==Notes==
This quest is automatically offered upon the death of a Mangy Hyena (or {{NPC||Skarf}}) around the [[Obelisk of the Stars]] after the quest [[Exploding Through]]. Thankfully the quest-starting death counts toward the twelve required.

==Progression==
{{Obelisk of the Stars}}
