== Objectives ==
Collect 20 Hardened Crocolisk Hides.
*[[Hardened Crocolisk Hide]] x20

== Description ==
You'll notice that we're slightly ill prepared for battle.

The [[tol'vir]] tribes had never seen any sort of major confrontation for thousands of years.

All the combat protocols that the [[titans]] programmed into our ancestors are still there, though. Some are part of our instincts, some get passed on as tradition.

But none of this can compensate for the lack of supplies. We need weapons. We need armor.

The best armor is lined with the skin of the riverbed [[crocolisk]]s nearby. Help us gather some.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sarcophagus Bracers|Cartouche-Inscribed Spaulders|Legplates of Heilopolis|Knife of the Venomous Asp}}
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
I'm glad to see you don't think you're above this sort of task.

== Completion ==
Excellent job, <name>. You might not think this adds up to much, but this might very well be the difference between life and death to one of our soldiers.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Ploughshares to Swords]] before heading out. Hides drop 2-3 at a time from the {{NPC||Riverbed Crocolisk}}s.
