==Objectives==
Find [[Tracker Samara]] in [[Ankhaten Harbor]].

==Description==
I fear that I don't yet have the strength to ride out into the sands and face those monsters again.

Ride to the south and find Tracker Samara in the excavation camp formerly known as [[Schnottz's Landing]].

Tell her to halt any [[caravan]]s that plan to pass this way, lest others are ambushed and met with the same grisly fate.

We must get the word out across [[Uldum]] before our forces are further divided!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Uldum Accord]]

==Completion==
Orsis is lost you say!? This is truly worse than I feared.

==Progression==
{{Aqir Offensive}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
