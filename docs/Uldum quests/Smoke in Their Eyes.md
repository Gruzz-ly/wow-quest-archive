==Objectives==
Burn Stacks of Hay inside the [[Lost City of the Tol'vir]] in [[Uldum]].
*Bale of Hay burnt x5
*[[Brazier Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm not sure what [[Budd's Plan|knuckle-headed plan]] [[Budd Nedreck|your friend]] is concocting, but we're going to need a distraction if we're to stand a chance of escaping.

Take the torch from that brazier and go start some fires.

Perhaps if we divert the [[Neferset]] scum's attention away for a few minutes, we'll have the opportunity we need.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
Yes, I hear the Neferset calling each other to the east. This might yet work.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Kavem the Callous]] and [[Budd's Plan]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{Escape and retribution}}

==Patch changes==
