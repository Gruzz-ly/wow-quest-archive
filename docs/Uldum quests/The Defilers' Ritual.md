==Objectives==
Stop the Neferset Ritual at the [[Murkdeep Cavern]].
*Neferset Ritual stopped

==Description==
Ah, I can already see more clearly, <name>.

We were right to be wary of the evil [[Neferset]]. I can already sense that they're behind the forces that corrupt the river.

Go underwater once more and find the Murkdeep Cavern. You will find the Neferset are performing a foul ritual of corruption.

Stop them so the river is cleansed once again.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9}}

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
The waters of the river are nearly cleansed. Our prophetic visions will soon return.

==Notes==
Back into the water. The mouth of the cave is at {{co|52.0|40.0|Uldum}} just east of Orsis about 50 yards down from the surface. Inside at the back of the cave is {{NPC||Dark Ritualist Zakahn}}, a level 84 elite tol'vir with 193,000 health, guarded by a few {{NPC||Ritual Guardian}}s. Take out the guardians first—they will not link to the ritualist.

Zakahn has a few abilities:
*{{abilities|Zakahn's Serpents|notes=Summons a few Cavern Serpents, each with ~20,000 health, hitting for 2k on cloth each. Cast repeatedly.}}
*{{abilities|Shadow Bolt Volley|range=30|Hurls missiles of dark magic, inflicting Shadow damage to nearby enemies.|notes=3 sec cast. Hits for ~8500-9500 Shadow.}}

*{{text|yell|Dark Ritualist Zakahn|Serpents of the depths! Come and aid your master!}}
