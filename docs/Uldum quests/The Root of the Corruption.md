== Objectives ==
Go to the northeastern source of the [[Nilos River]] and slay Scalemother Hevna.
*[[Scalemother Hevna]] slain

== Description ==
You might have dealt with the symptoms of our problem, <name>. But I've been studying these foul beasts and the eggs are not laid here by them.

The stream from the current carries their eggs to the dam, but whatever is laying them will be found upstream.

Go northeast, to the river's main source, and deal with the root of the corruption.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Scales of the Scalemother|Hevna's Eye Socket|Corrupted Eggshell Drape}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Is it done yet, <name>?

== Completion ==
Yes. The waters are clearing up.

I am certain I will be visited by a vision before the High Council meets.

Be warned, <race>. My vote will only be swayed by what I see.

You might have helped us greatly here today, but if the vision sways me to make a case against war than that is the way my vote will be cast.

== Notes ==
Fly northeast through Ramkahen up the river to the source of the Vir'naal. Up the last waterfall is a smallish lake. In the center at {{co|58.9|14.2|Uldum}} is Scalemother Hevna, a level 83 with 107,362 health.

This concludes the high priest's portion of the fork. Complete the High Commander's and the Vizier's quest chains as well to be offered the conclusion, [[The High Council's Decision]].
