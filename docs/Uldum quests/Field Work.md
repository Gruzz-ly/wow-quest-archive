== Objectives ==
Collect 10 Ancient Tablet Fragments.
*[[Ornate Tablet Fragment]] x10

== Description ==
This unfortunate [[pygmy]] was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

As you ponder his bad luck, you take notice of the symbols covering his shield - far too elaborate for pygmy scrawl.

Confident that {{NPC||Harrison Jones||Doctor Jones}} will find such objects of interest, you set out to find more fragments like this one.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
What'dya have there, <friend/young lady>?

== Completion ==
These tablets are covered with [[titan]] writings. There's never-before seen information here, <name>!

Missing pieces to an ancient puzzle...

Good work!

== Notes ==
Before starting to collect tablet fragments, look to the southeast. Inside a crater at {{co|68.4|29.6|Uldum}} is an [[Ornate Disc]], which starts [[A Strange Disc]]. {{NPC||Sand Pygmy}}s drop the fragments, and they also litter the ground around the obelisk.

Also, kill any [[hyena]] in the area (or {{NPC||Skarf}}) to start [[Do the World a Favor]].

==Progression==
{{Obelisk of the Stars}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Hotfix|date=2010-12-13|bluenote=Player are now able to stay in the proper phase and accept the quest after leaving the area, porting to other zones, or relogging.}}
