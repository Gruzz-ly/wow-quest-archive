==Objectives==
Collect 8 Vials of Purified Anima from [[Dokani clan|Dokani]] [[mogu]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Vial of Purified Anima]] (8)
* Larva Fed

==Description==
I have heard that a [[clan]] of the mogu called the Dokani have mastered the harnessing of [[life]] force into a substance they call "[[Anima (blood fluid)|anima]]."

If this stuff is indeed life condensed into a liquid form, then it could have spectacular properties when applied to our [[aqir]] [[larva]].

Go see if you can bring back some of this anima in a form that we can use. We'll see if our little friend here likes it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +900 reputation with [[Aqir Hatchling]]

==Progress==
Have you returned with the anima?

==Completion==
He sure took a liking to that! I guess it helps that it's blood-flavored.

I'll keep note of any changes the anima causes in our friend's growth.
