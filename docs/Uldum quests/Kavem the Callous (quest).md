== Objectives ==
Obtain the Neferset Key from {{NPC||Kavem the Callous}}.
*[[Neferset Key]]

== Description ==
Kavem was cruel enough before the [[Neferset]] signed up with {{NPC||Deathwing}}. His pleasure in deriving pain now borders on the insane.

It is he who now holds the keys to our shackles.

He dwells in the building next to us, to my right.

Find him and take the key from him. Do not hesitate or show him mercy. He will slit your throat and think nothing of it.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Keythief Handwraps|Kavem's Trimmed Chestguard|Pearl-Handled Long Gun}}
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
You're back. Do you have the key?

== Completion ==
Excellent, <name>. We will make our way out of here soon enough.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Smoke in Their Eyes]] and [[Budd's Plan]] before heading out. Head just to the southeast. Kavem is standing at {{co|60.9|73.9|Uldum}} in front of the altar. He is a level 83 tol'vir with 107,000 health.

On aggro:
:{{text|say|Kavem the Callous|How did you get here? I will destroy you!}}
