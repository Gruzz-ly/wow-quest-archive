==Objectives==
Fill the Antidote Vial with the poison of 8 [[Venomblood Scorpid]] corpses.
*[[Venomblood Scorpid]] drained (8)
*[[Antidote Vial]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Sun Priest Iset|Iset]] attempted to defend [[Seal of the Sun King|this holy ground]] when the [[Wastewander]] bandits ransacked it.

They appear to have used the potent toxin present in venomblood scorpids.

Take this vial and collect venom from their corpses so that I may concoct an antidote. I fear Iset might not have much time.

You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. We might yet save Iset.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Relics of the Sun King]] before heading out. Then head north into the [[Sahket Wastes]] to kill wastewanders and scorpids.

==Progression==
