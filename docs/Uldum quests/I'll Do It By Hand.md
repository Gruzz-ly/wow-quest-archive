==Objectives==
Defeat the Titanic Guardian.
*[[Titanic Guardian (Chamber of the Moon)|Titanic Guardian]] Defeated

==Description==
Yes, this all looks familiar enough.

Thanks to all the information you gathered for me, I'm sure that I can activate the mechanism. I'll just need some time free from distraction.

As soon as I get started, you can count on that titan construct to try and stop me.

That's where you come in.

I don't need to remind you of what's riding on this. Take down that guardian!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Titanic Treads|Gauntlets of Ahmtul|Guardian-Killer Waistplate}}
You will also receive: {{coppercost|172000}}

==Progress==
Almost got it...

==Completion==
That should do it.

Stand back!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|Take out those crystals, <name>! That should shut it down!}}

Several level 85 {{NPC||Lunar Crystal}}s with 38745 health are channeling something into the titanic guardian. They have a basic melee attack and the titanic guardian channels some kind of moonbeam into the ground. Quickly take out all three (they're linked!) to end the encounter.

On complete, another cutscene. The player and Harrison are standing near the pool as it activates. Up on the surface, the obelisk is shining its light skyward, too.

On the surface, the player, Harrison and Sullah are holding a quick war conference behind the hole leading down into the lower level, hiding from {{NPC||Myzerian}}, who has been weakened, but not killed. Talk to Sullah to continue the chain.

==Progression==
