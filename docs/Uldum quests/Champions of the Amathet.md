==Objectives==
Kill 6 Elite [[Amathet]] enemies in [[Uldum]].

==Description==
The [[soldier]]s of [[Ramkahen]] are hearty and reliable.

I would stand them up against any [[footman]] of the Amathet, but some of their higher-caste [[fighter]]s are too much for even our toughest to handle.

I don't think they'd be a problem for you, though. It would be a boon to our defense efforts if you could handle them while my soldiers engage the rank and file.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* {{cost|wr=65}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes the war?

==Completion==
Good work, <class>. My soldiers should be able to take care of the rest.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
