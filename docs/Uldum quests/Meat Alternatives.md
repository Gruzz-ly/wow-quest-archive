==Objectives==
Collect 12 pieces of Insectoid Meat from [[Aqir]], [[Mantid]], or other insects in [[Uldum]] or the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
*[[Insectoid Meat]] (12)
*Larva fed

==Description==
In the wild it is actually fairly common for insects to eat others of their species. I wonder if this rings true for the aqir as well.

Could you bring back some meat from the aqir or mantid? We'll see if that's more palatable for our friend here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +300 reputation with [[Shadowbarb Larva]]

==Progress==
I do hope this works.

==Completion==
Poor little thing, the insect meat gave him tummy troubles.

We'll have to try something else tomorrow.

:''The larva approaches the insect meat, eats a little, and briefly flops over. It recovers and returns to its original spot.''
