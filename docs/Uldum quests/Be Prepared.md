Collect 6 Rope Pieces.
*[[Piece of Rope]] x6

==Description==
;[[Decrepit Skeleton]] / [[Piece of Rope (starter)]]
Every [[adventurer]] worth their salt knows never to step foot in a cave, dungeon, crypt or tomb without an ample supply of rope... right?

You can never have too much of this stuff!

You resolve to scrounging every scrap of it you can find from the skeletons here.

Well, mine was in that wagon full of explosives that you set off.

How about searching around here and seeing if you can't find some.

==Progress==
;Decrepit Skeleton / Piece of Rope
What have you found, <name>?

;Harrison Jones
How goes the search?

==Completion==
;Decrepit Skeleton / Piece of Rope
Ahh, rope! Thanks, kid.

Something tells me I'm going to need this.

==Notes==
The Decrepit Skeleton can be found by the southern hieroglyph on the east side of the chamber. Also pick up [[Lessons From the Past]] from the {{NPC||Schnottz Scout}} on the west side of the chamber, at {{co|63.4|32.5|Uldum}} near the other southern hieroglyph.

Thankfully, the Decrepit Skeleton had a rope piece on it, so only five more to collect.

The rope pieces are dropped by the skeletons all over the room. Although the skeletons are inactive when they are on the ground, get close and they will stand up and aggro.
