==Objectives==
Collect 8 Concentrated Royal Jelly in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
*[[Concentrated Royal Jelly]] (8)
*Larva fed

==Description==
My friends in the [[Golden Lotus]] have been telling me some interesting things about the new mantid swarm. Apparently they have developed a concentrated royal jelly that accelerates the growth of newly hatched [[mantid]].

If this jelly works on mantid, logic would suggest it would work on [[aqir]] as well!

See if you can find a sufficient sample of this jelly to help with our larva's growth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +900 reputation with [[Shadowbarb Larva]]

==Progress==
This gets me thinking.

After we've raised this one, I wonder if we could hatch a mantid as well?

==Completion==
Just look at how he gobbled it up!

Let's hope this does the trick.

==Notes==
The jars can be found on the ground near any [[Amber Vessel]]s at [[Autumnshade Ridge]].

;Place the jelly
:''The larva eagerly eats the royal jelly in his water dish and afterwards does an air-flip.''
