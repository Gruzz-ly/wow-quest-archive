In '''Hunt for Yenniku''', you must hunt [[Bloodscalp|Bloodscalp Trolls]] in northern [[Stranglethorn Vale]] to prove to [[Nimboya]] that you are strong enough to help him save [[Vol'jin|his chief]]'s youngest son, [[Yenniku]]. This is the first quest in a long chain for this area.

==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Bloodscalp Tusks from Bloodscalp trolls in the Bal'lal Ruins.
*[[Bloodscalp Tusk]] (6)

==Description==
A doom, there is. A doom on my chief's youngest son, Yenniku. As is a custom with our people, he was given to the Gurubashi Trolls of Zul'Gurub, but after my tribe, the Darkspear tribe, left with the orc Thrall, poor Yenniku was lost to us. I was sent from distant Orgrimmar, back to Stranglethorn, to search for my chief's son.

And I believe the Bloodscalp tribe has him.

If you would help me, then hunt the Bloodscalps. You may find them to the north. Gather their tusks and return to me.

== Reward ==
You will receive: {{cost||20||}}

==Progress==
<Class>. Show me you have made prey of the Bloodscalp tribe.

Show me your trophies.

==Completion==
These are good tusks, <name>. You prove that you have the strength to hunt the Bloodscalps.

And that is good, because you are not done hunting them.

==Notes==
This quest only becomes available upon completion of [[Commander Aggro'gosh]]'s quest [[The Defense of Grom'gol: Murloc Menace]] and should be done along with [[The Defense of Grom'gol: Trollish Thievery]] and [[Bloodscalp Insight]]. The [[Bloodscalp|trolls]] you need to hunt for this quest can be found all over north-western [[Stranglethorn Vale|Stranglethorn]], in the ruins scattered there.

==Progression==
{{Trolls and Yenniku}}
