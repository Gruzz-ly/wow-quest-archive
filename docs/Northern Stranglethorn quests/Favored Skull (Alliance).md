==Objectives==
Report to {{npc||Osborn Obnoticus}} at the [[Rebel Camp]] and show him your [[Lashtail Hatchling|Lashtail Hatchling's]] new skull. 

== Description ==
Your pet raptor seems to have found a new toy: a skull, from a nearby troll skull pile.

What sets this skull apart from the rest is beyond you, but for some reason, she won't put it down.

[[Osborn Obnoticus]], the [[gnome]] you saved from [[Kurzen's Compound]], is an expert in troll history and physiology. Maybe he'll have some idea what makes this one so special.

== Completion ==
What do we have here?  A young raptor, and her pet <race>.  Hah!

More importantly, what is that skull you have there?  This was no ordinary troll.  He was big...

<Osborn raps on the headcase.>

... and strong, too.  You know, I've been meaning to try my hand at some troll magic.  How hard could it be?  Let's use this strong fellow as a test subject, shall we?

==Progression==
{{Just Hatched}}

== Notes ==
The skull can be found by the Lashtail Hatchling either on the body of a troll or while working on [[Deep Roots (quest)]].
