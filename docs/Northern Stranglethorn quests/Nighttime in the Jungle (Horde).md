*[[Zul'Mamwe Brazier]] Extinguished (8)

==Description==
One year ago, my mother - that is, the troll who took care of me - was taken by the Skullsplitters of Zul'Mamwe. Young and headstrong, I ran in after her, only to see her being pushed toward a burning brazier by a dozen of their warriors. I hid behind a tree and watched as they grabbed her and... and...

<Kil'karil looks away.>

At nighttime, the lights from their braziers reflect off the treetops and keep me awake. Please, <name>... travel south into Zul'Mamwe and put them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||50}}

==Completion==
My mother's spirit rests well tonight, <name>.

As will I.
