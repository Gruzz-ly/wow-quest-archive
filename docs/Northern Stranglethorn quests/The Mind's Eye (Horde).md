In '''The Mind's Eye''', you must enter the [[Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound]] and defeat [[Mai'Zoth]] to obtain the gem known as the [[Mind's Eye]]. Once this is complete, you can finally attempt to save [[Yenniku]], the [[Darkspear]] chief's son. This quest is part of a long chain, all available in [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]], the first being [[Hunt for Yenniku]] which can be obtained from [[Nimboya]] at the north exit to the camp.

==Objectives==
Obtain the Mind's Eye from [[Mai'Zoth]].
*[[Mind's Eye]]

==Description==
The Mind's Eye is held by an ogre mage, east of here and deep within the Mosh'Ogg ogre mound. His name is Mai'Zoth. I know him from when the Darkspears dwelt in Stranglethorn - he is vicious, and his magic is strong.

And if he has the Mind's Eye, then his magic will be stronger still.

You must face Mai'Zoth and wrest from him the Mind's Eye. It is a perilous task, but it is the only hope we have of saving Yenniku.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Greetings, <name>. The spirits sing praise of your bravery, yet they tell me no tales of your quest against Mai'Zoth.

Do you have the Eye?

==Completion==
You retrieved the eye! Your might is the stuff of legends, <name>!

And in getting the Eye, you must have defeated Mai'Zoth and sent him to the Nether. That is why the spirits would not mention him before.

It is good that he is gone from the world of flesh and bone, but now that he is in the realm of spirits...I fear he will begin a new reign.

But that is a worry for another time.

==Notes==
[[Mai'Zoth]] is at the very bottom of the ogre mound, and has two body guards. [[Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound|Mosh'Ogg]] is in north-eastern [[Stranglethorn Vale]]. If you can sap/sheep/whatever the two bodyguards, [[Mai'Zoth]] isn't too difficult to take out.

==Progression==
{{Trolls and Yenniku}}
