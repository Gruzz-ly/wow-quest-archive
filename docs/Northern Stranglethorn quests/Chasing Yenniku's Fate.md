==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kin'weelay]] at [[Bambala]]. 

== Description ==
<Nezzliok speaks.>

You have appeased myself and my chief, so I will tell you that which you seek to discover...

Young Yenniku is lost to his clan.

He was taken by the witchdoctor {{npc||Zanzil the Outcast}}. Now Zanzil controls him, body and soul, and only the most potent magic could set him free.

A magic that you do not have, <class>.

Perhaps your Darkspear allies at Bambala in the east can offer a hope of Yenniku's salvation. But that, I doubt.

== Completion ==
Zanzil the Outcast??

If Yenniku is held by that troll, a vile and powerful witchdoctor, then I fear that only a faint hope remains.  Faint.  And tiny as the smallest insect.

Fortunately, I have some suspicions of my own.  Suspicions which may lead to Yenniku's salvation.
