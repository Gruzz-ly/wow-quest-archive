==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Tumbled Crystals from Venture Co. forces near [[Lake Nazferiti]].
*[[Tumbled Crystal]] (5)

==Description==
If I'm going to repair this pot, I'm going to need reagents. And to get them, you're going to have to do a eensy little bit of killing. I hope you don't mind.

Those dastardly Venture Company geologists have been collecting some tumbled crystals that will suffice for what I need. You'll find them around their Base Camp, on the other side of Lake Nazferiti, to the east.

I don't care what you have to do to get them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Spare Metal Pauldrons
|Bartered Bracers
|Krazek's Oven Mitts
|Bartered Wristguards
|Crystal-Chipping Mallet
|Shredder Arm Extension
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Booty Bay]]

==Progress==
Do you have those crystals? 

==Completion==
These will work fine.  Just a moment please.

<Krazek thrusts the stones into the cooking pot and wiggles them around a bit.>
