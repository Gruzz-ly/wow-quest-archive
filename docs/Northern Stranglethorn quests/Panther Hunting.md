==Objectives==
Hunt 10 Young Panthers.
*[[Young Panther]] slain (10)

==Description==
If you want to be a part of the hunt with this crack group under [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.|Hemet Jr.]]'s leadership, you're going to need to prove yourself an able [[panther]] hunter. You should start out easy: just focus on the young panthers for now. As you improve and gain experience as a hunter, you will undoubtedly find increasingly dangerous quarry.

Start by heading east. Return to me when you are a master panther hunter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You feel more experienced already.  Perhaps it's time to move on to bigger prey. 

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing [[Panther Mastery (Classic)]].}}
