==Objectives==
Find Page 14 of the Green Hills of Stranglethorn. 
*[[Green Hills of Stranglethorn - Page 14]]

==Description==
One page! I only need one more page!

[[Hemet Nesingwary|Master Nesingwary]]'s novel ran into a bit of an... accident <Barnil shoots an accusing glance over at [[Spanks]]>... and we misplaced some of the pages.

I've been asking your fellow adventurers to look for the missing pages, and they've been quite helpful, but one page still eludes me.

I'm sure you're awfully busy with other matters, but while you're out in the jungle, would you mind looking for it? 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
*2000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found it?  I'd hate to return an almost-finished book back to Hemet. 

==Completion==
You've certainly saved me a heap of trouble, <name>!  I can't thank you enough.  It shouldn't be long now until we see Master Nesingwary's book in libraries throughout the world!

I'll leave a copy of the book right here, if you ever want to take a peek at the finished product.  Thanks again, <name>! 

==Notes==
*Page 14 is a random drop from any mob in [[Northern Stranglethorn]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing [[The Green Hills of Stranglethorn (Classic)]].}}
