[[Hemet Nesingwary]] had originally set up an expedition camp here in [[Stranglethorn Vale]] to conduct a big-game hunting safari. With the opening of the [[Dark Portal]] and [[Outland]], he left his son, [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.]] here to tend the camp, and established another safari camp in [[Nagrand]].

[[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.]], and his friends, challenge you to face the beasts of Stranglethorn Vale. Will you be the hunter?...or the hunted? [[Hunter]]s, Leather wearers in general, and [[Skinning|Skinners]] of all types will find these quests profitable.

Hemet Nesingwary Jr, and his two friends, [[Ajeck Rouack]] and Sir [[S. J. Erlgadin]] each offer you a series of quests, against tougher and tougher adversaries. Each series of quests is independent of the others.

Should you prove up to the challenge, and complete all 12 quests offered (4 each of Raptor, Tiger, and Panther mastery), you will be challenged to face the lord of the Stranglethorn jungle himself: [[King Bangalash]].

== The Stranglethorn Vale Safari ==
=== Tigers ===
[[Ajeck Rouack]] asks you to go hunting Tigers:
;[[Tiger Hunting]]
:Kill 10 Young Stranglethorn Tigers, level 24-25.  These are found near the camp.  You can't miss them, except intentionally.

;[[Tiger Stalking]]
:Kill 10 Stranglethorn Tigers, levels 25-26.  These are found further west.  Also, east of [[Colonel Kurzen]]'s compound.

;[[Tiger Prowess]]
:Kill 5 Elder Stranglethorn Tigers, levels 26-27.  These are found south of the haunts of the western Stranglethorn Tigers, down as far as [[Grom'gol Base Camp]].

;[[Tiger Mastery]]
:Hunt down the lordly [[Sin'Dall]], and return with his {{item|Paw of Sin'Dall|paw}}.  He's king of his hill, but we'll leave it to you to find the hill.

Your reward will be the {{Item|Tiger Strangler's Bracers}}, {{Item|Paws of Sin'Dall}}, {{Item|Cat Lover's Vest}}, or {{Item|Sin'Dall's Femur}}.

=== Panthers ===
Sir [[S. J. Erlgadin]] challenges you to master hunting the stealthy Panther.

;[[Panther Hunting]]
:Kill 10 Young Panthers, level 24-25.  These are found near the camp, but primarily to the East, and south of [[Kurzen's Compound]].

;[[Panther Stalking]]
:Kill 10 Panthers, levels 25-26.  These are generally found West of the camp, closer to the [[Zuuldaia Ruins]], one terrace up from the Stranglethorn Tigers.  A few are located elsewhere. as well.

;[[Panther Prowess]]
:Kill 5 Shadowmaw Panthers, levels 26-27.  These are found both east and south of [[Lake Nazferiti]], as far south as the [[Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound]].  Proceed with caution, as these panthers are hard to spot in the jungle, and may pop out at you without notice.

;[[Panther Mastery]]
:Hunt down the elusive [[Bhag'thera]], and return with his {{item|Fang of Bhag'thera|fang}}.  No, we're not going to tell you where he is.  What part of Elusive didn't you understand?

Should you accomplish this feat, your reward will be {{Item|Bhag'thera's Roar}}, {{Item|Shield of the Panther}}, or {{Item|Mantle of the Panther}}.

=== Raptors ===
[[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.]], like his father before him, challenges you to hunt the viscious Raptors.
;[[Raptor Hunting]]
:Kill 10 Stranglethorn Raptors, level 24-25.  These are found almost on the coast West of the camp, on the terrace above where the Stranglethorn Tigers, and just west of where the Panthers are found.

;[[Raptor Stalking]]
:Kill 10 Lashtail Raptors, levels 25-26.  These are found everywhere around the ruins south of the expedition camp, to as far south as [[Grom'gol Base Camp]].

;[[Raptor Prowess]]
:Kill 10 Jungle Stalkers, levels 26-27.  These are found north or east of [[Fort Livingston]].

;[[Raptor Mastery]]
:Hunt down the dangerous [[Tethis]], and return with his {{item|Talon of Tethis|talon}}.  You want to know where he is?  We hesitate to tell you.  People who hunt him go missing...  But hey, it's your funeral.  Look to the southeastern corner of [[Northern Stranglethorn]].

Should you return alive, and with a fang, collect your reward of the {{Item|Raptor Slayer's Band}}, {{Item|Belt of the Raptor}}, or {{Item|Tethis' Skull}}.

=== Finale ===
Completing all of the above quests, Hemet Nesingwary Jr sends you off for ''the'' biggest game of all.
;[[Big Game Hunter]]
