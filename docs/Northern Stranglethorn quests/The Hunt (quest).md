==Objectives==
Report to [[Barnil Stonepot]] at [[Nesingwary's Expedition]] in [[Northern Stranglethorn]].

==Description==
Of all the places to end up across [[Azeroth]], I'm stuck here in [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]]. With the marauding wildlife, the caravan raids, and the constant threat of troll attacks, I'm surprised I've survived for this long.

Could be worse, I suppose. At least here in Grom'gol we have walls and guards. There's a group of hunters up north that set up camp right in the middle of the jungle!

I see people heading there all the time. If you're looking for trouble, feel free to head up there. I'll stick with my Grom'gol.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Completion==
Hmm?  Barnil's the name.  And you are...?
