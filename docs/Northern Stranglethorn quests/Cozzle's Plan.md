==Objectives==
Obtain Cozzle's Key from [[Foreman Cozzle]], then obtain the Fuel Regulator Blueprints.
*[[Fuel Regulator Blueprints]]
*[[Cozzle's Key]]

==Description==
I may be of [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]] birth, but I spent my childhood here, in [[Stranglethorn Vale]]. I've seen everything there is to see here in Stranglethorn, but the most offensive is the devastation that the [[Venture Company]] has done to the riverbed.

To make things worse, Foreman Cozzle and his crew have been increasing their activity, and I suspect they have some new plan. Succeed where I failed, <name>: Kill Cozzle, obtain his key, and steal the blueprints from his apartment.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

==Progress==
The Venture Company's acts against Stranglethorn cannot be forgiven. 

==Completion==
A fuel regulator?  This seems important.  At least, I hope it is.

We may not have ended the Venture Company's operations, but we at least slowed them down.  Thank you, <name>.
