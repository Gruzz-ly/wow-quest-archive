==Objectives==
Kill Chief Anders, Chief Gaulus, Chief Miranda, and Chief Esquivel within [[Stockpile|The Stockpile]].
*[[Chief Anders]] slain {{co|63.7|16.7|Northern Stranglethorn}}
*[[Chief Gaulus]] slain {{co|62.4|14.1|Northern Stranglethorn}}
*[[Chief Miranda]] slain {{co|65.8|17.1|Northern Stranglethorn}} 
*[[Chief Esquivel]] slain {{co|66.1|11.7|Northern Stranglethorn}}

== Description ==
Now that our allies have been evacuated, it's time to run a final raid on [[Kurzen's Compound]]. They will never be weaker than they are right now, and with your help, we may be able to weaken them beyond repair.

Those four names that were listed in the Officers' Dossier - Anders, Gaulus, Miranda, and Esquivel - will be the highest-ranking personnel remaining. Look for them in that cave in the back of their compound. Removing all four will be devastating to Kurzen's forces.

Go with honor, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Guerilla Breastplate
|Expedition Scouting Gear
|Ring of Forgotten Causes
|Expedition Scout's Hauberk
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||60|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Remove the heads, <name>. I know you can do it. My men will clean up the remainder of their forces after you are done.

== Completion ==
Marvelously executed, <name>.  My men and I can handle the rest.

With Kurzen out of the picture, we may be able to continue our original expedition here in Stranglethorn, which was... ahh...

No matter. Please, feel free to peruse our armor stores. You may find something that fits you well.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Source of the Madness]] before heading out. The mouth of the cave is at {{co|59|19|Northern Stranglethorn}} at the northeastern end of [[Kurzen's Compound]].

Enter the cave and keep left to find [[Chief Anders]] at {{co|63.7|16.7|Northern Stranglethorn}} in a dead end. Back track a few yards, and go down the ramp, then turn around again at the split heading further downhill. In the back of this room at {{co|62.4|14.1|Northern Stranglethorn}} is [[Chief Gaulus]]. Backtrack and exit the room, then go straight into the southeastern part of the ramp split area. On the right side of the cave near to the supplies at {{co|65.8|17.1|Northern Stranglethorn}} is [[Chief Miranda]]. Keep heading back to the end to find at {{co|66.1|11.7|Northern Stranglethorn}} behind a table [[Chief Esquivel]].

Hopefully, by this point, the [[Whispering Blue Stone]] will have dropped, but if not, keep killing troops until it does.

This concludes the Kurzen portion of the Northern Stranglethorn storyline. [[Corporal Kaleb]] will send players to [[Nesingwary's Expedition]] via [[Krazek's Cookery]], [[Corporal Sethman]] will send players scouting the [[Bal'lal Ruins]] via [[Deep Roots (quest)]] alongside [[Berrin Burnquill]] with [[Bloodscalp Insight (Alliance)]], and [[Emerine Junis]] will send adventurers on a hunt for water elemental bracers with [[Water Elementals (quest)]].
