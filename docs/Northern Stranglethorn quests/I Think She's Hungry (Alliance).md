==Objectives==
Kill [[Crystal Spine Basilisk]]s in [[Northern Stranglethorn]], and let your Lashtail Raptor eat 40 bites of their meat.
*Bites of basilisk meat (40)
*[[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
It looks like your young raptor is hungry. If you're looking to keep her, why don't you find something for her to eat? The lashtail often attack the basilisks of Stranglethorn, which can be found to the east, beyond [[Kurzen's Compound]].

She probably isn't strong enough to hunt on her own yet, but I'm sure she will eat freshly killed basilisk meat.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||12}}

==Progress==
She's still looking a little scrawny, <name>. Maybe some more basilisk meat is in order.

==Completion==
She looks bigger already!  You can see, these raptors grow quickly.  You are lucky to have found such a strong companion.

Keep her by your side as long as you can, <name>.  I'm sure she will prove to be an asset in the future.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Control Sample]] before heading out. The basilisk are on the far side of [[Kurzen's Compound]] from [[Rebel Camp]].

The followup will take place later, so don't be alarmed if [[Favored Skull (Alliance)]] isn't offered upon completion of this quest.
