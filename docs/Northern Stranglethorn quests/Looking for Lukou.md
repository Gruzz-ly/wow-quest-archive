{{dialogue|title=Shadow Hunter Ty'jin|
Is dat.... Kevo ya Siti over dere?

AND [[Jani]]?

{{Gossip|quest=|Have you ever heard of a [[loa]] named Lukou?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I followed de ways of Lukou for a long time. She was mostly a loa our [[witch doctor]]s and [[priest]]s followed, but she helped de [[shadow hunter]]s too. It is said she be time itself, able to recover from any wound. Some say she granted regeneration to us [[troll]]s.

To me, losing Lukou is how we lost ourselves as [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]]. We lost some of our ability to recover. I worship her and find some small power in it, but it be weak, distant.

Stories say Lukou had an old shrine here in [[Stranglethorn]], but de stories don't say where it was, exactly.

{{Gossip|quest=| We'll find her!}}}}}}

:{{Text|say|Kevo ya Siti|We fought. I left. She must have retreated to that shrine.}}

{{dialogue|title=Witch Doctor Daara|How you doin'?

{{Gossip|quest=|Have you ever heard of a loa named Lukou?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Yes. Lukou be de loa of regeneration... and pain.

Not de pain of being injured, but de pain of recovery.

Like a bruise or a fever, it has to hurt if it is to heal.

We have not lately felt enough of our history and pain as Darkspear, I think, and we forgot Lukou. I come here to meditate and deal with my own grief. I have felt Lukou in a small way. Perhaps she be close by and still guiding us.

{{Gossip|quest=|We'll find her!}}}}}}
:{{Text|say|Kevo ya Siti|Her pain. If we get closer, I will sense her pain.}}

{{dialogue|title=Shadow Hunter Laztoki|What brings you all de way to Bambala?

{{Gossip|quest=| Have you ever heard of a loa named Lukou?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I know less of Lukou, and more of her brother, Kevo ya Siti. He could hunt anything. If he be on your side, I am sure you will find what you seek.

It be said Bwonsamdi was de soul of the Darkspear, but Lukou and Kevo ya Siti be our heart and head. Dat was a long time ago. I do remember stories of de ancient Lukou rituals. Dey were done deep in a cave near where Bambala now stands.

But de caves have long been taken by [[ogre]]s.

{{Gossip|quest=| We'll find her!}}}}}}
:{{Text|say|Kevo ya Siti|I thought we were forgotten, abandoned.}}

The trolls can be asked again:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Could you repeat what you said about Lukou?}}
}}

Once you have asked everyone, return to Rokhan.

{{dialogue|What information did you gather? Kevo ya Siti is very restless!

{{Gossip|quest=|We should look for Lukou's shrine in an ogre cave nearby.}}}}

:{{Text|say|Rokhan|The Mosh'Ogg ogre mound be just southeast of here.}}
:{{Text|say|Kevo ya Siti|They could be hurting Lukou!}}
:''Kevo ya Siti rushes to the mound, Rokhan follows.''
:{{Text|say|Jani|Wait for Jani!}}

Upon reaching the ogre mound:
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Where would Lukou hide?}}
:{{Text|say|Kevo ya Siti|Lukou be de loa of regeneration, and she be fierce. She does not hide. Something is wrong.}}
