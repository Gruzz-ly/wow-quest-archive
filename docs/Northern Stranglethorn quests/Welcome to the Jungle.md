==Objectives==
Speak with [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.]]

==Description==
Welcome to [[Stranglethorn]]!

Perhaps you're not aware of this, but that [[dwarf]] over there is the son of the one and only [[Hemet Nesingwary]], renowned war hero of the [[Alliance]] and master big game hunter. Like his father, he's not one for welcoming strangers into his camp, but you look like you've seen quite a bit of action in your day, <class>.

Go and speak with him. He's a chip off the old block, so perhaps he can give you some hunting pointers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*200 [[XP]]
*{{cost||1|75}}

==Completion==
Jolly nice to make your acquaintance, <name>.  Haven't seen a <class> around these parts for some time.

I've one purpose in being here: to hunt a great and elusive [[beast]].  Seeing that you're a hero of sorts I am willing to let you take part in the hunt, but you must first prove yourself.

I shall teach the ways of [[raptor]] killing to you.  [[Ajeck Rouack|Ajeck]] will train you with [[tiger]] hunting.  And [[Sir S. J. Erlgadin|Sir Erlgadin]] is a master of [[panther]] tracking.

Prove your skill and I'll let you in on the big hunt.

==Trivia==
*The quest's name is likely a reference to the {{wp|Guns N' Roses}} song "Welcome to the Jungle."
