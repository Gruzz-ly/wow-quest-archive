==Objectives==
Deliver the Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment to [[Bloodlord Mandokir]] in [[Grom'gol Base Camp]].
*[[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
<Race>.  <Race>, <race>, <race>... you didn't think I was a friend, did you, <race>?  Ah, ha ha haaaa!

You've served your purpose.  I've returned to the realm of the living, and it's all thanks to you.  So, instead of killing you, I'm going to make you a deal instead.

Give me [[Ohgan'aka|the raptor]].

You must already know that she's no normal raptor, and I need a replacement for [[Ohgan]].  Do it, or both you and [[Nimboya|the witch doctor]] will taste my rage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|6000}} (or {{coppercost|1920}} at max level)
*3150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
All I ask is the raptor, <race>.  Give it to me, and the troll lives.

==Completion==
I'm glad to see you've come to your sense.

Come and visit us in [[Zul'Gurub]] sometime, <race>.  I'll be watching...

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Nimboya|Do it!  Give him de raptor!  I don't like havin' his sword in my face!}}

After completing the quest and giving him the raptor, Bloodlord Mandokir runs off through the northern exit of Grom'gol.
