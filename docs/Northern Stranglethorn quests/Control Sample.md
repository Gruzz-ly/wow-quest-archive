==Objectives==
Obtain 7 samples of Crystal Spine Basilisk Blood.
*[[Crystal Spine Basilisk Blood]] x7

==Description==
<[[Brother Nimetz]] analyzes the samples you've given him.>

This... this is just [[basilisk]] blood!

No, it's mostly basilisk blood. They've added something to it though. I'll need a control sample to perform a proper comparison.

They most likely obtained the blood from the [[Crystal Spine Basilisk|crystal spine basilisks]], found to the east of their compound. Bring me back some pure samples, and I'll have this elixir figured out. 

==Progress==
There's something not quite healthy about this elixir, <name>.  Even though I haven't completed my analysis, I can sense it. 

==Completion==
This will do.  Please hold on for a moment while I test this out. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||12}}

==Notes==
Pick up [[I Think She's Hungry (Alliance)]] before heading out. The basilisk are on the far side of [[Kurzen's Compound]] from [[Rebel Camp]].
