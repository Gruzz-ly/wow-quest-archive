==Notes==
This quest takes the form of a minigame in which the Captured Lashtail Hatchling must be guided out of [[Zul'Gurub]], avoiding trolls and using the assistance of friendly adult raptors, using a [[vehicle]] UI with an increasing number of abilities.

[[File:Be Raptor UI.png|thumb|The "vehicle UI" with all abilities unlocked after obtaining a skull.]]

It begins by talking to the quest-giver:
: {{gossip|''I am ready for the Mind Control ritual, Thaalia.''}}

The hatchling's perspective then loads with one starting ability:
: [[File:Ability druid dash.png|22px]] '''Dash''' - Increases movement speed by 60% for 5 sec. ''(15 sec cooldown)''

She can run at a typical pace and jump at similar height to players. Like most vehicles, it takes a brief time to turn, and she cannot strafe. 

The hatchling begins atop a tower in the southeast corner of the dungeon complex. She is next to a friendly raptor, [[Tian-kuyi]], who can be spoken to, is agreeable to escaping, and offers advice:
* Avoid the trolls, who will use traps to stop the escape.
* Speak with other raptors to learn new abilities and help navigate. These act as "save points" if the hatchling is trapped.
* Stay out of the water.

Various trolls roam around and can be avoided in part by hopping over walls. Some have a fairly large aggro radius, although a small visual and audio "alert" indicator shows above most trolls' heads when close to aggroing. They throw nets which, after about 3 seconds, reset the hatchling's position to the last raptor she spoke to (or the starting tower, if none). Minimap objective markers show the location of all friendly raptors along the way, who stand in "safe" areas the trolls do not walk past. The first is [[Tan'shang]], in a doorway at the end of the first area. It grants a new ability:
: [[File:inv_misc_net_01.png|22px]] '''Eat Through Net''' - Bite through the Gurubashi Trolls' nets. Does not work on Ironweave Nets. ''(10 sec cooldown)

Biting out of the net allows the hatchling to run away, but is unreliable. The troll(s) that cast the net will follow closely and may be able to throw new nets before the Bite cooldown is over, especially with multiple trolls. They do de-aggro with enough distance. Ironweave Nets are only used by [[Gurubashi Crusher (dire troll)|Gurubashi Crushers]], which from this point forward block access to other parts of the dungeon, forcing the hatchling to follow a linear path but playing no part in the minigame objectives.

Hugging the wall to the right easily skirts the second area to reach the next raptor [[Tenjiyu]]. It is more hesitant about allowing the hatchling to escape, but acquiesces on the condition the hatchling steals some food, as Tenjiyu has not been fed in days. This requires entering deeper into the second area and locating a tent not blocked by the various patrols. The trolls within will be asleep, and interacting with one steals a sack of food, which has a 3 minute duration. Tenjiyu only requires one, and teaches the hatchling a new ability in return:
: [[File:spell_fire_fire.png|22px]] '''Light Tiki Fire''' - Sets fire to a Zul'Gurub Tiki. Requires you to have a [[Burning Twig]]. ''(11 yard range)''

Three Tikis in a row must be set ablaze to distract three triplets of guards blocking progress. Burning Twigs are fetched from Gurubashi Braziers just before each Tiki, but have only a 5 second duration. The guards will rush to put out their Tiki:
* {{text|yell|Gurubashi Soldier|Someone been burnin' my tiki!}}
* {{text|yell|Gurubashi Soldier|It's a fire! Hurry up mon!}}
* {{text|yell|Gurubashi Soldier|Get over here, bruddas, quick!}}

This allows the hatchling to walk straight through them without aggroing, although they return to their posts after a little while.
# North down a steep ramp is the first Tiki, very simply set up right next to a Brazier.
# A squad of Crushers blocks a path west, so further downhill to the northwest is the only way.
# More Crushers block the north path, but luckily down and west leads towards the exit. The final Brazier is only just after the previous troll guards' doorway ''and'' is quite far away from the Brazier, requiring speed for success - make sure Dash is available. Ideally, the second and third fires can be handled in one quick run, so that the second set of guards is still distracted while fetching the third twig.

[[File:Be Raptor guard slipping.png|thumb|A guard falling off the bridge after slipping on a dropped skull.]]
[[Chiyu]] awaits after the third Tiki. He teaches:
: [[File:inv_misc_bone_orcskull_01.png|22px]] '''Drop Skull''' - Drops a skull on the ground. You must be carrying a Gurubashi Skull.

The path curves north towards the first of two bridges which each have a soldier patrolling end-to-end. Another regular patrol is easily avoided along the way. A Giant Skullpile sits in a hut immediately before the bridge, from which skulls with 30-second durations can be fetched. Only one skull can be carried at a time. Dropping one on a bridge and retreating allows the soldier to melodramatically slip and fall over the edge into the lake to the north.
* {{text|yell|Gurubashi Soldier|Ouch, mon! I be trippin'!}}
* {{text|yell|Gurubashi Soldier|Who left this here, mon? Wooaahh...}}
* {{text|yell|Gurubashi Soldier|Must...regain...balance...mon...}}
* {{text|yell|Gurubashi Soldier|Aaaaahhh!}}

A replacement soldier does appear after a few seconds, but crossing the bridge right away is fine. The next bridge works much the same, this time with the skullpile on the left, and another non-bridge patrol that may need to be waited out before retrieving a skull.

Only one uphill stretch to the west remains before the dungeon entrance. Take care stepping off the bridge: a patrol walks up and down the path, and an additional guard ''runs'' up and down it quickly. Both can be bypassed by keeping to the left wall and cutting behind a large tree. Touching water at this point, either by falling off the edge around the bridges ''or'' even stepping into the pond near the dungeon entrance, immediately ends the "mind control". However, progress is still saved at the last raptor, so talking to Thaalia again restarts the minigame at Chiyu's location.

Near the top, a final Tiki setup awaits to distract the last pair of guards, but a patrol passes right next to the Brazier. The hatchling must wait until they have walked away to the north while simultaneously avoiding the running guard.

[[File:Be Raptor final ambush.png|thumb|[[Jin'do the Hexxer]] denies escape for the hatchling.]]
The way looks clear after passing the final set of fire-fighting guards, but unfortunately the hatchling finds herself stopped in her tracks as a [[Shade of the Hexxer|shade]] of [[Jin'do the Hexxer]] appears just short of the entrance portal:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
* {{text|say |Shade of the Hexxer|Where you goin', little one?}}
* {{text|say |Shade of the Hexxer|You tryin' to escape from Zul'Gurub?}}
* {{text|yell|Shade of the Hexxer|Ain't NO ONE gonna escape Zul'Gurub! Not with Jin'do in charge!}}
* {{text|say |Shade of the Hexxer|You're lucky I don't kill ya right now... but I got bigger plans for ya.}}
* {{text|say |Shade of the Hexxer|Ya see... to summon Hakkar, I need Mandokir. And Mandokir, he needs you.}}
* ''<[[Bloodlord Mandokir]] walks up from behind.>''
* {{text|say |Bloodlord Mandokir |Hello, Ohgan'aka.}}
* {{text|say |Shade of the Hexxer|Bloodlord, you gonna take better care of your possessions?}}
* {{text|say |Bloodlord Mandokir|Oh yeah, Jin'do. We gonna take REAL good care of Ohgan'aka.}}
* {{text|say |Bloodlord Mandokir|I got a new cage built up, and we got plenty of ways to... teach her not to escape again.}}
* {{text|say |Shade of the Hexxer|Good, Good. And you... yes, you... the meddling worm inside dat Mind Control spell. Don't think Jin'do can't see you.}}
* ''<The adventurer's spirit is wrenched out of the hatchling and hovers above her, struggling against Jin'do.>''
* {{text|yell|Shade of the Hexxer|Whenever you get the GUTS to come back here, you better be ready. 'Cause Jin'do's got a surprise for you...}}
* ''<The adventurer's mind is whisked back to their body as the vision ends.>''
}}

Despite the sudden reversal of fortune at the end, the "Escape from Zul'Gurub" objective is now complete and the quest may be turned in.
