==Objectives==
Obtain Gan'zulah's Body from [[Zul'Kunda]].
*[[Gan'zulah's Body]]
*[[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
The soul is ready, but the body is not. For a skull as well-formed, as marvelous, as beautiful as this... we will need a suitable body.

The chief of the [[Bloodscalp tribe|Bloodscalps]], [[Gan'zulah]], won his throne with brute force. If he still lives, you'll find him in Zul'Kunda, to the west.

Taking his body won't be easy, but nothing a sturdy <class> like yourself couldn't handle. Bring it back here when you're done.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Electrostatic Legguards
|Discarded Troll Leggings
|Juju Belt
|Discarded Troll Greaves
|Gan'zulah's Headchopper
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Gan'zulah was a brute and a tyrant.  I've got a feeling that this troll will be different.  This troll magic is easier than I thought it would be!

==Completion==
You have done well, <race>.  We have a head, a body, and some juju-voodoo-mojo nonsense.  Now, just a little shock of electricity to get things started, and... 

==Notes==
A crack of lightning knocks down the player and reveals a terrible mistake: the skull belonged to [[Bloodlord Mandokir]], and he's now been resurrected!  Osborn cowers in fear in front of him.)

==Progression==
{{Just Hatched}}
