{{Gossip|What happened between you and Kevo ya Siti?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Kevo ya Siti and I fought when de Darkspear first left this region.

Kevo left in anger, to push back on de dark [[loa]] that corrupted many [[troll]]s, like [[Mueh'zala]] and [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]]. I knew you would return. 

I waited, but de ogres found me. Dey shattered my shrine and used their own [[magic]] to steal my power. I would not die, but I could not heal. De torment of it was... unspeakable. 

Kevo returned, and I thank you for that. I will help the Darkspear, as I always have.
