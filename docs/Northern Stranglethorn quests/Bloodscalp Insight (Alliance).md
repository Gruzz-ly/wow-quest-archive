==Objectives==
Obtain a Bloodscalp Totem from a [[Bloodscalp Shaman]].
*[[Bloodscalp Totem]]

==Description==
I never got to properly thank you for saving me.

Thank you, <name>.

I'm still a little fatigued from my captivity, so I thought you might help me with my studies. As a [[shaman]] of the [[Wildhammer clan]], I'm very interested in the shamanic practices of the [[Bloodscalp tribe]].

Their magic seems to have diverged in an interesting direction. If I had one of the totems that their shaman use, I could begin my studies. You'll find them at the Bal'lal ruins, on the coast to the southwest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{cost||20|}}

==Progress==
Beware: they may put up a fight.

==Completion==
<Berrin studies the inscriptions on the totem.>

I think I can read this text... Fascinating!

Tsul'kalu, Mahamba, Pogeyan... what are these names?
