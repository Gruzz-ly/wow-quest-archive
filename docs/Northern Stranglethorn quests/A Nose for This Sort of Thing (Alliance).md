Use your Lashtail Hatchling to sniff out 8 Tkashi Fetishes.
*[[Tkashi Fetish]] (8)
*[[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
<Osborn looks at the skull again.>

In life, he was strong, powerful, a lord among trolls. With our help, he can be a lord once more.

The Bloodscalp scavengers that wander the ruins to the southwest hoard magical fetishes that can help us. They hide these artifacts under the ground. Use your hatchling to find these artifacts, <name>... then bring them here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20}}
*2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How many did you find? 

==Completion==
These will provide a bit of... what's the troll word?  Voodoo?  Juju?  Tiklabang?

It doesn't matter.  If we're going to re-build a troll, we need troll magic, and these fetishes are full of it.
