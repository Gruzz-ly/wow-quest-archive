==Objectives==
Report to [[Bort]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
My commander has sent me to scout for potential recruits to assist in the defense of [[Grom'gol Base Camp]] in [[Northern Stranglethorn]]. Are you familiar with [[Stranglethorn Vale|Stranglethorn]]? It's a long way away... across the [[Great Sea]], on the southern tip of the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. You fit the build he was looking for... interested in leaving [[Kalimdor]] for a while?

If so, then go talk to my cohort Bort in Orgrimmar. He'll help you board the [[zeppelin]].

And tell him I said "Woozle wozzle." He'll know what it means. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|}}
* 360 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
Hah! That Cromula cracks me up.

Oh, right, Stranglethorn. You're really going?

==Trivia==
The quest name is likely a reference to the Gun's N Roses song Welcome to the Jungle.
