==Transcript==
After accepting the quest, Priestess Hu'rala has the dialogue option:
:[[File:GossipGossipIcon.png]] I am ready for the Mind Vision ritual, Hu'rala.

Clicking it transports the player's vision inside Zul'Gurub, where it quickly zooms into Ohgan'aka's tiny body. It is first person from then on, low to the ground and swaying back and forth slightly as it moves. Mandokir is next to the young raptor, and leads it up a ramp. As Mandokir walks, he talks to Ohgan'aka:
:{{text|say|Bloodlord Mandokir|Welcome to Zul'Gurub, little one. It might not look like much now, but give it time.}}
:(''Mandokir pauses at the top of the ramp and dances a little jig.'')
:{{text|say|Bloodlord Mandokir|Ahh... it's good to be home.}}
:(''Mandokir continues along the path, past high level elite trolls and raptors all about. He pauses again.'')
:{{text|say|Bloodlord Mandokir|There's plenty others of your kind here, but I wouldn't worry about competition. You're from the bloodline of [[Ohgan]], my oldest friend. You see... our souls are intertwined, yours and mine.}}
:(''Mandokir leads Ohgan'aka on into his "room" in the complex. He turns and gets low, his face close to hers.'')
:{{text|say|Bloodlord Mandokir|Here we are. Get ready for your training, little one. I recommend you forget about that worthless <race> <class> and start thinking about your duties here in Zul'Gurub.}}

The vision ends there.

==Completion==
What did Priestess tell you?

The raptor is daughter of Ohgan, heir to Mandokir's seat.

Hah!
