In '''Saving Yenniku''', you must use the [[Soul Gem]] to capture [[Yenniku]]'s soul and return it to his people. This is the final quest in a long chain, available in [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]] and [[Bambala]], the first being [[Hunt for Yenniku]] which can be obtained from [[Nimboya]] at the north exit to the camp.

==Objectives==
Bring the Filled Soul Gem to [[Nimboya]].
* [[Filled Soul Gem]]
* [[Soul Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
I have reshaped the Mind's Eye into a Soul Gem. Its purpose is twofold: you must use it to stun Yenniku, and once stunned place it upon his head to entrap his soul.

My suspicions that I spoke of earlier were correct: the spirits tell me that Yenniku dwells not with Zanzil the Outcast, but within the Ruins of Zul'Mamwe, to the southwest. Once you have freed Yenniku's spirit, return to Nimboya at Grom'gol.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nimboya's Legguards
|Weavers of the Unending Tale
|Stone Etcher
|Linkers of the Unending Tale
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
<Name>. Kin'weelay told me you set out to capture Yenniku.

Is it true? Do you have him?

==Completion==
You've done it! You freed Yenniku from the will of Zanzil and the tyranny of the Skullsplitter, and completed the mission I had thought was so hopeless. Zanzil still looms a threat in the Cape of Stranglethorn, but for now, I at least know that the soul of my chief's son is free.

Our tribe will remember your name in songs, <name>, and we will etch your tale in stone so that it will live forever.

==Notes and trivia==
*Take the [[Soul Gem]] you get when you accept the quest and head to the [[Ruins of Zul'Mamwe]]. [[Yenniku]]{{coords|57.4|75.2|Northern Stranglethorn}} is in the southern corner of the ruins, almost completely alone. Simply use the Soul Gem while targeting him (you don't have to weaken him first or anything), and he will become friendly. Right click him to capture his soul in the gem and create the [[Filled Soul Gem]].
*After the ''Cataclysm'' world revamp, Nimboya once referred to Yenniku as his own son in the completion text of this quest, saying "...I at least know that my son's soul is free." His words were changed at some unknown point later during Cataclysm to "...I at least know that the soul of my chief's son is free." to be more in line with the classic quest.<ref>[[Talk:Vol'jin#Vol'jin's son]]</ref>
