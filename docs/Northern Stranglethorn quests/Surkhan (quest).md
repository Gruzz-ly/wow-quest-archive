==Objectives==
Report to [[Surkhan]] at [[Bambala]] in [[Northern Stranglethorn]].

==Description==
Priestess is not very good at speaking [[Orcish (language)|Orcish]], no.

Maybe you go speak with Surkhan, upstairs.

Tell him about what you've seen inside [[Zul'Gurub]], yes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||60|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Completion==
<You explain to Surkhan what has happened up to this point.>

It would seem that [[Jin'do]] has survived, and he is rallying his brothers to once again summon [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]] into [[Azeroth|this world]].  It was good of you to come to speak with me.

There is not much we can do now but to wait, and watch.  Jin'do is weak, and prime for striking, but I must wait for word from Rastakhan before issuing orders.  Until then, you and your raptor will have to wait.
