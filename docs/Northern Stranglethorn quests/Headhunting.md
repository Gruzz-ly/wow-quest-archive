In '''Headhunting''', you hunt more [[Bloodscalp|Bloodscalp Trolls]] in northern [[Stranglethorn Vale]], this time specifically their headhunters, and collect their {{item|Shrunken Head|Shrunken Heads}} to determine if Yenniku has been killed by them. This quest is in a long chain, all available in [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]], the first being [[Hunt for Yenniku]] which can be obtained from [[Nimboya]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 25 Shrunken Heads from Bloodscalp trolls at the Zuuldaia Ruins.
* [[Shrunken Head]] x25

== Description ==
We must find if Yenniku is dead.

Slay the Bloodscalps of Zuuldaia and take from them their shrunken heads. You must gather many, many heads, and I will inspect them to make sure Yenniku's head is not among them.

And if Yenniku was killed by the Bloodscalps, then may a 600-year curse fall on the spirit of their chief, Gan'zulah!

Go, <name>. You will find the heads at the ruins of Zuuldaia, along the coast to the north. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Head Inspector's Gloves
|Palm Frond Shoulderpads
|Junglestrider Sandals
|Ring of Six Hundred Years
|Palm Frond Pauldrons
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

== Progress ==
<Name>. I fear for our chief's son. Do you have the shrunken heads so I may inspect them?

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>. I will inspect these heads to ensure poor Yenniku was spared the headhunter's axe.

==Notes==
[[Nimboya]] can be found near the northern exit of [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]], near a bubbling cauldron. [[Bloodscalp]] headhunters can be found in their main city in the north-eastern part of [[Stranglethorn Vale]] and along the northern coast.

A single troll may drop up to five Shrunken Heads.

This quest should be done along with [[An Unusual Patron]] and [[A Nose for This Sort of Thing (Horde)]].

==Progression==
{{Trolls and Yenniku}}
