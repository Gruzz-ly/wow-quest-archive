==Objectives==
Bring Krazek's Crock Pot to Krazek.
* [[Krazek's Crock Pot]] (provided)

==Description==
I do most of the cooking at the camp. And it used to be a lot of work, until I bought a mechanical cooking pot from a goblin merchant in Booty Bay. The pot is a wonder! It saved me countless hours...until it broke!

Can you take the pot back to the goblin for me so he can fix it? His name is [[Krazek]]. Last I heard, he was staying with [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.|Nesingwary]] in the [[Nesingwary's Expedition|hunters' camp]] just to the south.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 140-1400 XP
* +75 [[reputation]] [[Booty Bay]]
* -75 reputation [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]

==Progress==
Hello! You brought me something?

==Completion==
Oh I see, it's a Krazek's Crock Pot! An ingenious piece of work, but it can break a spring or throw a gear now and then. Let me see what's wrong with this one...

Aha! Its steam charger is rusted out, it has a cracked knuckle-gasket and its fobulator is missing teeth. I'm surprised the pot could even boil a turnip in this state!

Can I fix it? Of course I can fix it!

But there's a price. Oh yes, there is always a price...
