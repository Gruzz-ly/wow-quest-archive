==Objectives==
Obtain {{NPC||Gan'zulah}}'s Body from [[Zul'Kunda]].

==Description==
<The skull speaks once more.>

My soul is ready, but my body is not. The [[Bloodscalp]]s desecrated my old body long ago. The horrors that they inflicted upon me... my spirit watched on while they tore my body apart and, and... I can't go on.

Their chief, Gan'zulah, presided over the gruesome acts. In fact, if memory serves, he was a strong, powerful troll... about the same size as I was. What a fine coincidence.

You know what to do, <race>. Make it quick.

* 1,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<You hear the skull's voice:>

Gan'zulah...

==Completion==
You have done well, <race>. Only one more step remains before I may return.
