==Objectives==
[[Nemeth Hawkeye]] at [[Grom'gol Base Camp]] wants you to bring him a [[Bloodscalp Totem]] from a [[Bloodscalp Shaman]].

==Description==
Well met, <class>.  I’ve made a habit of studying the fighting techniques of the various troll tribes in my travels, and I’ve noticed a trend.  The Bloodscalp trolls at the Tkashi Ruins and Bai'lal Ruins to the north use some of the same tactics as the Amani of the northern forests.

Their magic seems to have diverged in an interesting direction and they’ve used it to become the strongest tribe in the area.  It could form the core of a powerful weapon against the Amani, but first I must find out more about it.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||20|}}

==Progress==
Do not fail me, <name>. If we can bend this Bloodscalp magic to our will, my people may yet eliminate the Amani threat.

==Completion==
Well done. Now, this is curious...

The inscription on this totem is in a language no troll could ever hope to learn, but one that is known to us. It names the bearer as an ally of a water elemental named Naias and marks him as one worthy to channel his power.

This is most unexpected, but not entirely bad, <name>. With your help, I'd like to pursue this further.

==Notes==
This quest only becomes available upon completion of [[Commander Aggro'gosh]]'s quest [[The Defense of Grom'gol: Murloc Menace]] and should be done along with [[The Defense of Grom'gol: Trollish Thievery]] and [[Hunt for Yenniku]]. The quest [[Favored Skull (Horde)|Favored Skull]] becomes available while doing them.
