==Objectives==
Hunt [[Tethis]].
*[[Talon of Tethis]]

==Description==
Before returning to [[Nesingwary's Expedition]], you will have to complete the impossible: hunt the raptor that no other hunter has been able to capture. That beast goes by the name of Tethis, and he's been known to terrorize the southeastern corner of [[Northern Stranglethorn]].

Bringing Tethis' talon back to that dwarf hunter should be proof that you are no ordinary <race>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Raptor Slayer's Band
|Belt of the Raptor
|Tethis' Skull
|Scale-Cord of the Raptor
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||60}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ah, so you're hunting Tethis?  Tracked her all the way back to camp, did you?

==Completion==
Master <name>, the raptor slayer!

Has a nice ring to it, eh?

==Progression==
{{Big Game Hunter}}
