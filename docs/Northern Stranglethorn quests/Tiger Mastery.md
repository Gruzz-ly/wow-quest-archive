==Objectives==
Hunt [[Sin'Dall]] and return with her paw.
*[[Paw of Sin'Dall]]

==Description==
Legends speak of an elusive tigress... a feline so powerful that she dwarfs even the elder males. The hunters at [[Nesingwary's Expedition]] have hunted for her without success. Many of them have fallen prey to her raking claws, their bodies now decaying at the foot of her hill, north of [[Grom'Gol|Grom'gol]].

They call the beast [[Sin'Dall]].

You resolve to do what no <race> has done before: hunt, kill, and claim the paw of Sin'Dall.

==Progress==
How goes the hunt?

==Completion==
Most impressive, I do say!  I send you out to defeat the kittens, and you return with a paw the size of a [[gnome]]!  You are a true Master Tiger Hunter, <name>!
