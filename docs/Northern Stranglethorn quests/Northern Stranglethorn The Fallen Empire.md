==Objectives==
Report to [[Commander Aggro'gosh]] at [[Grom'gol Base Camp]] in [[Northern Stranglethorn]].

==Description==
Commander Aggro'gosh is looking for devoted members of the [[Horde]] to assist him and his mission in Grom'gol. If you're interested, just hop on up to the top of that [[zeppelin tower]] and board the Grom'gol [[zeppelin]]. It's that easy!

Seriously, [[Stranglethorn Vale|Stranglethorn]] is the place to be right now... there's plenty of action to be found, and not nearly as much cataclysmic damage as, say... [[Stonetalon Mountains]]. I wish I could go with you. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 180 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
Glad you could make it! Let's get to work, shall we?

==Patch changes==
