==Objective==
Slay 15 Murkgill [[murlocs]].

==Description==
The Murkgill murlocs have been pushed out of the ocean by the Saltscale murlocs, so they make their refuge in the [[Kal'ai Ruins|Kal'ai ruins]] to our northeast. This was acceptable in the past, but no longer.

Separated from the sea, the Murkgill have grown restless, and they send their foragers to attack my supply caravans. Send them a message: this behavior will NOT be tolerated by [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]'s [[Horde]].

==Progress==
Beware the murloc fighter, <name>. In my experience his size usually belies his strength.

==Completion==
Excellent work. Hopefully the raids will stop for now.

I have one more task for you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||18|}}

==Notes==
This quest should be done along with [[I Think She's Hungry (Horde)|I Think She's Hungry]]. You will not be able to loot the murloc corpses once they have been eaten by [[Ohgan'aka]].
