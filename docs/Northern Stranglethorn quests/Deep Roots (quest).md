==Objectives==
Obtain the Bloodscalp Lore Tablet from the [[Bal'lal Ruins]] in [[Northern Stranglethorn]].
*[[Bloodscalp Lore Tablet]] 

== Description ==
On a somewhat unrelated note, I've been putting together a collection of troll stories and legends for a... personal project. I was just thinking you might be able to help me find some of them.

The Bloodscalps at the Bal'lal ruins, on the coast to the southwest, maintain a large tablet documenting some of their stories. Of course, I'll reimburse you if you're able to bring any of these stories back to me. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Well Crafted Leather Britches
|Soft Cotton Armbands
|Rebel Breastplate
|Well Crafted Chain Britches
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Did you make it down to Bal'lal Ruins yet?  Did you find the tablet? 

== Completion ==
To be honest, I'm sending this information home to Stormwind, for my wife and son.  They love to hear about what I've been doing out here in the jungle, and I only get to visit so often.  Every little bit helps.

Thank you, <name>.
