==Objectives==
Speak with [[Priestess Hu'rala]] at [[Bambala]] in [[Northern Stranglethorn]].

==Description==
Thank you, <name>.  I know you didn't have to save my life, and... well, I am thankful.

The return of [[Bloodlord Mandokir]] is ill news.  He was killed inside [[Zul'Gurub]] several years ago, and we thought we had seen the last of him and his kind.  The [[Jungle troll|trolls]] of Zul'Gurub were attempting to perform a hideous, horrible ritual.  If Mandokir is alive, then it stands to reason that he is not the only one.

The trolls at Bambala in the east may know more.  Speak with their priestess.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|225}} (+{{coppercost|120}} at max level)
*220 experience
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Completion==
Mandokir is alive, yes.

You are responsible, yes.

You may be able to stop him still, yes.
