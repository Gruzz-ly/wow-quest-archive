==Objectives==
Obtain the Mosh'Ogg Bounty from the ruins behind the [[Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound]]. 
*[[Mosh'Ogg Bounty]]

==Description==
Say... have you heard about the ogres? I got a hot tip from some fella' named Mok'thardin that some <race> schmuck in a ridiculous <class> getup found this ogre hand, and...

<Skeezy trails off as he looks you over.>

What was I just saying? Oh yes... some <SWASHBUCKLING HERO/BREATHTAKING HEROINE> found this ogre hand, and Mok'thardin thinks it means that the ogres have some special artifact. I've seen them guarding a chest up in some ruins behind their mound. Care to fetch it for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25}}
*2,300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Why is it that the OGRES always find the priceless artifacts?

==Completion==
<Skeezy struggles fruitlessly to open the box.>

Those ogres really know how to close a treasure chest, I'll tell you what.  A box is useless to me, hero.  We're going to need to find a way into this crate.
