==Objective==
Kill 4 [[Mosh'ogg]] Brutes and 4 Mosh'ogg Witch Doctors.
*[[Mosh'Ogg Brute]] slain (4)
*[[Mosh'Ogg Witch Doctor]] slain (4)

==Description==
When we first arrived in [[Northern Stranglethorn Vale|this jungle]] we did not intend to wage war on the local tribes. Our mission to supply [[Stonard]] is of the highest priority. But complications have arisen. A local band of [[ogre]]s has occupied the [[Mizjah Ruins]] to the southeast of [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]]. Despite warnings, they continue to ambush our supply caravans.

I am putting you in charge of dealing with these uncooperative ogres.

Travel to the ruins and attempt to drive them from the area. At the very least it will send a firm message. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Smashing Breastplate
|Mizjah Vest
|Ring of Cooperation
|Mizjah Hauberk
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
I need Mizjah to be cleaned of ogres, <name>. Now get to it!

==Completion==
I see you are good for more than simple egg-smashing duty. Good. The Horde can use a capable <race> like you.

==Notes==
One of the ogres will drop a [[Disfigured Mosh'Ogg Hand]] which begins the quest [[Mosh'Ogg Handiwork]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Mizjah Hauberk]] added as a reward.}}
