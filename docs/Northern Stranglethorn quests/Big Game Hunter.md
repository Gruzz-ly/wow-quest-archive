==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|King Bangalash.jpg|King Bangalash|He is the deadliest thing in this jungle... other than you.}}
Hunt for the head of [[King Bangalash]], the great white [[tiger]].
*[[Head of Bangalash]]

==Description==
<Name>, you are a [[hunter]] worthy of our company. From the battlefields of [[Lordaeron]] to the deepest jungle, I have rarely witnessed such prowess with weaponry as you have demonstrated.

You have killed the ferocious [[Sin'Dall]], the elusive [[Bhag'thera]], and the treacherous [[Tethis]]. But the true prize is the head of [[King Bangalash]]. That white tiger is the reason I am here... yet still, he taunts me from his roost to the south. Kill King Bangalash and your hunting prowess is proven to be second to none.

I see you're back, <old bloke/lass>.  King Bangalash has caused me to come crawling back to camp many times.  Hang in there.

==Completion==
Bloody well done!  Right-o!  Congratulations, <name>, for succeeding where others have failed.

I am honored to count you as a comrade of our great hunting party here.  No one will ever doubt your expertise in hunting and tracking!

Cheers to you, I say!  Cheers!
