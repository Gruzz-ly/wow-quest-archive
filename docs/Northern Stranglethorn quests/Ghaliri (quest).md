==Objectives==
Report to {{npc||Ghaliri}} at [[Fort Livingston]] in [[Northern Stranglethorn]]. 

== Description ==
Priestess is not very good at speaking Common, no.

Maybe you go speak with Ghaliri, in front of that tent.

Tell him about what you've seen inside Zul'Gurub, yes.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* {{cost||75}}
*3,550 XP
* +500 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

== Completion ==
<You explain to Ghaliri what has happened up to this point.>

It would seem that Jin'do has survived, and he is rallying his brothers to once again summon Hakkar into this world.  It was good of you to come to speak with me.

There is not much we can do now but to wait, and watch.  Jin'do is weak, and prime for striking, but I must wait for word from Rastakhan before issuing orders.  Until then, you and your raptor will have to wait.
