==Objectives==
Bring the [[Ohgan'aka|Lashtail Hatchling]] to [[Far Seer Mok'thardin]] at [[Grom'gol Base Camp]].
*[[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
Upon dealing the final blow to the [[Lashtail Egg|lashtail eggs]], you look down to see a newborn hatchling looking back up at you. You can see it studying you, learning your features and following your movements.

The lashtail hatchling has formed a bond with you.

Your original assignment was to thin out the [[raptor]]s, but you have fulfilled your egg quota, and this one is an innocent newborn. Perhaps someone back at Grom'gol Base Camp will know what to do with a raptor hatchling. 

==Completion==
Yes, the little one seems to have taken a liking to you. I suppose that one raptor alone and raised among [[orc]]s is much less deadly than a whole pack of them. Keep her, <name>... she may come in handy.

In fact...

==Notes==
This quest is is accepted automatically upon destruction of the twelfth egg in the quest [[The Defense of Grom'gol: Raptor Risk]], beginning a storyline involving [[Ohgan'aka]], [[Bloodlord Mandokir]] and [[Jin'do the Hexxer]].
