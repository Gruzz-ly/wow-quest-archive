==Objectives==
Obtain 7 Jungle Remedies from the [[Kurzen's Compound|Kurzen Compound]].
* [[Jungle Remedy]] x7

==Description==
I have a feeling that [[Kurzen Medicine Man|Kurzen's Medicine Men]] are distributing more than just medicine. Kurzen needs some way to quelch insubordination, and an elixir under the guise of "medicine" would be the perfect way to do that.

We need those remedies for research. Search the Kurzen Compound to the southeast - his medicine men and jungle fighters should carry the remedies on their bodies.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nimetz's Pauldrons
|Cord of the Ascetic
|Missionary's Leggings
|Cinch of the Ascetic
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I'm a little bit of an [[alchemist]] in my spare time, you know.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.  Now, let's see what they've got in this elixir of theirs...

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Fate of Kurzen]] before heading out.

At [[Kurzen's Compound]], the prison records are on the ground at {{co|57.9|22.9|Northern Stranglethorn}} a yard west of the saw blade at the [[lumber mill]], and officers' dossier is on the ground at {{co|57.9|23.7|Northern Stranglethorn}} at the southern end of the lumber mill.

Kill any Kurzen commandos as well looking for [[Jungle Remedy]]. Additionally, upon looting the seventh vial of jungle remedy, the adventurer will also find the [[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]], which starts [[Just Hatched]].
