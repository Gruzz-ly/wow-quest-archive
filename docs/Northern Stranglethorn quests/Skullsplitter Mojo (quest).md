==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Skullsplitter Mojos from [[Skullsplitter tribe|Skullsplitter]] trolls in the [[Ziata'jai Ruins]] and the [[Balia'mah Ruins]].
*[[Skullsplitter Mojo]] (6)

==Description==
I have my body, thanks to you, your raptor, and [[Gan'zulah]].  Now, if I remember correctly, you and your witch doctor friend will need some [[mojo]] to complete this ritual.

The [[Bloodscalp]]s keep mojo in [[Zul'Kunda]], but it is weak.  Your [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspears]]' mojo will not work either.  No... you want to take from the Skullsplitter trolls, across the river to the east.

Hurry back, <race>.  I will be watching...

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|4000}} (or {{coppercost|1620}} at max level)

==Progress==
<The large troll skull floats around within the cauldron.>

==Completion==
<You throw the mojo into the pot.>

Excellent work, <race>. You and your raptor have done a great thing. [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]] would be most pleased...

==Notes==
This quest should be done along with [[Speaking with Nezzliok]].

After completing the quest [[Bloodlord Mandokir]] appears next to the cauldron and threatens to kill Nimboya.
