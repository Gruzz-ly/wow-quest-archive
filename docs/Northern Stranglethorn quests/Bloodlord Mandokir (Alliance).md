==Objectives==
Deliver the Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment to [[Bloodlord Mandokir]] in the [[Rebel Camp]]{{coords|47.2|10.6|Northern Stranglethorn}}.
*[[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
<Race>.  You just resurrected your worst nightmare.  You didn't think I was a friend, did you, <race>?  Ah, ha ha haaaa!

You've served your purpose.  I've returned to the realm of the living, and it's all thanks to you.  So, instead of killing you, I'm going to make you a deal instead.

Give me that raptor.

You must already know that she's no normal raptor, and I need a replacement for [[Ohgan]].  Do it, or both you and the gnome will taste my rage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||60}}
*3,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
All I ask is the raptor, <race>.  Give it to me, and the [[Osborn Obnoticus|gnome]] lives.

==Completion==
I'm glad to see you've come to your senses.

Come and visit us in [[Zul'Gurub]] sometime, <race>.  I'll be watching...
