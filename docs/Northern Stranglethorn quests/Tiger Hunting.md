==Objectives==
Hunt 10 Young Stranglethorn Tigers.
*[[Young Stranglethorn Tiger]] slain (10)

==Description==
When I was but a young girl, my father trained me in the art of [[tiger]] hunting.

You'll find the young felines much easier to track and slay. One can often find young tigers near the [[Nesingwary's Expedition|expedition camp]].

Test your tracking skills and see if you can hunt some of the beasts down. Start your hunt near our camp, to the south.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have finished with the young tigers... but the thrill of the hunt still holds you captive. 

==Progression==
