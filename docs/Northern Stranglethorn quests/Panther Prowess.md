==Objectives==
Hunt 5 Shadowmaw Panthers.
*[[Shadowmaw Panther]] slain (5)

==Description==
Now the hard part. As panthers grow older, they become more wily, blending in with their environment and becoming difficult to spot. These cunning panthers are known by the name "shadowmaw", for their tendency to suddenly appear out of the darkness... with a waiting mouth full of teeth.

If you want to prove yourself as a true panther hunter, shadowmaws are the only way to do so. They prowl to the southeast, across the river.

==Rewards==
*2,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The shadowmaw panthers proved no match for your skills as a hunter.  Only one task remains.
