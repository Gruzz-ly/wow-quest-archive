==Objectives==
Use your Lashtail Hatchling to sniff out 8 Zuuldaian Fetishes.
*[[Zuuldaian Fetish]] (8)
*[[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
<The skull speaks to you.>

I live? No, I do not... but I can.

That raptor you have is wise to have found my skull among what must have been so many. In life, I was strong, powerful, a lord among trolls. With your help, I can be a lord once more.

The Bloodscalps at Zuuldaia hoard magical fetishes that can help me return. They hide these artifacts under the sand. Use your hatchling to find these artifacts, <name>... then throw them in the pot.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20||}}
*2100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The large troll skull bubbles to the surface.>

How many did you find?

==Completion==
<You drop the fetishes into the pot.>

Yes... yesss...

My spirit is strong again, <race>, and I am ready to return to the world. Now I need a body.

==Notes==
This quest should be done along with [[An Unusual Patron]] and [[Headhunting]].

You have to go to the target area and summon your [[Lashtail Hatchling]] with the [[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]].  The hatchling will then detect fetishes, dig them out and throw them to you.
