==Objectives==
Kill Murkgill [[murloc]]s in [[Northern Stranglethorn]], and let [[Ohgan'aka|your Lashtail Raptor]] eat 40 bites of their meat.
*Bites of Murkgill meat (40)
*[[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
It looks like your young [[raptor]] is hungry. If you're looking to keep her, why don't you find something for her to eat? The lashtail often attack the camp of the Murkgill murlocs, just to our north.

She probably isn't strong enough to hunt on her own yet, but I'm sure she will eat freshly killed murloc meat.

==Progress==
She's still looking a little scrawny, <name>. Maybe some more murloc meat is in order.

==Completion==
She looks bigger already!  You can see, these raptors grow quickly.  You are lucky to have found such a strong companion.

Keep her by your side as long as you can, <name>.  I'm sure she will prove to be an asset in the future.

==Notes==
This quest should be done along with [[The Defense of Grom'gol: Murloc Menace]]. You will not be able to loot the murloc corpses once they have been eaten by [[Ohgan'aka]].
