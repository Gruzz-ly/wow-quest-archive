==Objectives==
Obtain 6 vials of Sea Salt from Murkgill murlocs in Northern Stranglethorn.
*[[Sea Salt]] (6)
*[[Emerine's Telling-Sphere]] (provided)

==Description==
I need something to cut into the raw, elemental power of these bracers... something strong and abrasive, but still of the sea.

The [[Murkgill tribe|Murkgill]] murlocs have moved inland from the sea, but they still carry vials of sea salt on them. What they use it for, I can't be sure, but it will serve for our studies. You can find the Murkgill in the glade south of the Rebel Camp and east of Bal'lal ruins.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||20}}

==Progress==
The salt? 

==Completion==
We have what we need.  Are you ready to activate the Altar of Naias, <name>? 

==Progression==
{{The Altar of Naias}}
