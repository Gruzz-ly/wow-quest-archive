==Objectives==
Open the Mosh'Ogg Bounty by fighting a Venture Co. Shredder or by using the sawblade in the Venture Company [[lumber mill]].
*[[Opened Mosh'Ogg Bounty]]
*[[Mosh'Ogg Bounty]] (provided)

==Description==
We're going to need something even stronger than those beefy <race> hands of yours to open this. And the Venture Company schlubs to the northwest might have just the thing.

Last time I was over there, I saw shredders walking around with giant rotating blades on their hands. That's one way to open a box!

If you can't find any shredders, you might also try the giant sawblade in their lumber mill, by the lake.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25}}
*2,300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
You get that chest open yet?  I can't wait to see what's inside. 

==Completion==
<The goblin peers inside.>

Whaaaaaa?!?

I'm... I'm going to have to send this to... to {{npc||Flem Gizzix||Flem}}... in the south.  He'll know what to do with it. 

==Notes==
To open the bounty, hover over a sawblade and interact with it once the cursor changes to the gear ([[File:pointer gear on 32x32.png]]).
