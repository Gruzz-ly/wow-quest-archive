==Objectives==
Report to [[Lieutenant Doren]] at the [[Rebel Camp]] in [[Northern Stranglethorn]]. 

== Description ==
Several years ago, [[Stormwind]]'s [[Colonel Kurzen|Captain Kurzen]] brought a brigade into [[Stranglethorn Vale]] on a mission whose details are still murky. Kurzen swiftly descended into madness, as did his men... except for a few rebels who made it their mission to undo the evils that Kurzen had wrought.

As I said, that was years ago. I'm now hearing rumors that Kurzen is dead, but those rebels still persist at their rebellion. If you wish to investigate, you'll find them at a camp on Stranglethorn's northern border.

== Completion ==
Welcome to our camp, <class>. You couldn't have arrived at a better time. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

== Notes ==
This quest is offered by two quest givers: [[Sister Elsington]] in [[Duskwood]] and [[Sentinel Velene Starstrike]] in [[Ashenvale]]. It is otherwise identical in both versions.
