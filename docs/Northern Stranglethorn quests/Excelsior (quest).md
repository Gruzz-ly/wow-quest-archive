'''Excelsior''' is the third part of a three part chain in Stranglethorn Vale. The chain begins with [[Supply and Demand]].

==Objectives==
Bring an Elder Crocolisk Skin to Drizzlik at [[Nesingwary's Expedition]].
* [[Elder Crocolisk Skin]]

==Description==
With the inside finished, all that's left is to add the outer layer. For this, I use only the best elder croc skins. They are more durable and a better canvas--if you will--for adding the designs and accents that make Drizzlik's Excelsior line.

It's hard to find that perfect skin though, the only one that fits my plan is the skin of an [[Elder Snapjaw Crocolisk|elder snapjaw crocolisk]]. Find them to the south, near the border with the cape.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Excelsior Footwear
|Excelsior Waders
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I read somewhere that the elder [[crocolisk]]s are slowly dying out... bad news for my business, isn't it?

Anyways, I hope you have that elder snapjaw crocolisk skin for me!

==Completion==
Great! Thanks to your help I'll have this order filled and sent off to [[Director Riddlevox]] on the next boat to [[Undermine]]. Ahead of schedule, even!

For all your hard work, here, I made some extras, so take a pair. It's on Drizzlik.

And remember, there's no boot so fine as one of Drizzlik's Excelsior line!
