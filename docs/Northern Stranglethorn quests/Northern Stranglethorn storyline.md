# Northern Stranglethorn storyline

[[File:WorldMap-StranglethornJungle.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

[[Northern Stranglethorn]] is a level 20-25 zone in southern [[Eastern Kingdoms]] for both the [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]]. It starts out separated, with the Alliance going to the [[Rebel Camp]] in the north and the Horde going to [[Grom'gol Base Camp]] on the western coast. The overarching story for the whole zone revolves around a [[Lashtail Hatchling]]. {{NPC||Hemet Nesingwary Jr.||Nesingwary}} and his crew still offer the quests involving hunting the local wildlife. (Tigers, and Panthers, and Raptors, Oh My!)

The progress for the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Northern Stranglethorn Quests]].
