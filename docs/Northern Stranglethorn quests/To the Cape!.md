==Objectives==
Speak with [[Robert Rhodes]] to obtain a flight to the [[Explorer's League Digsite]] in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]].

==Description==
The [[Explorer's League]] is growing, <name>. Not only have they taken in [[worgen]] like me, but they have expanded their range in search of artifacts. One of our best, [[Bronwyn Hewstrike]], has set up a camp in the south, where he believes an item of [[titan]] origin may be hidden.

Bronwyn asked me to perform some duties here in the north, one of which was to identify potential recruits. You seem to be made of the right stuff. Talk to Robert Rhodes, the flight master, and he'll send you down there. Bronwyn's treat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||7}}
*610 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Completion==
[[Wulfred Harrys|Wulfred]] has a good eye.  I think you'll do just fine here at my camp.
