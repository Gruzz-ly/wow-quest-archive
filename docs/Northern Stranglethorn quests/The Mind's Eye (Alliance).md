In '''The Mind's Eye''', you must enter the [[Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound]] and defeat [[Mai'Zoth]] to obtain the gem known as the [[Mind's Eye]]. 

==Objectives==
Obtain the Mind's Eye from [[Mai'Zoth]].
* [[Mind's Eye]]

==Description==
One of the Vale's many treasures lies nearby, on OUR side of [[Sundering (Stranglethorn Vale)|the giant whirlpool]]. The Mind's Eye is held by an ogre mage, in the [[Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound|Mosh'Ogg ogre mound]] just to the northeast. His name is Mai'Zoth. From what I understand, he is vicious, and his magic is strong.

And if he has the Mind's Eye, then his magic will be stronger still.

Thus far I've been unable to get near enough to take it from him. Will you give it a try?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fort Livingston Legguards
|Eye-Plucker Gloves
|Wand of Imagination
|Eye-Plucker Grips
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the Eye? 

==Completion==
You retrieved the eye! Your might is the stuff of legends, <name>!

And to think my [[Williden Marshal|brother]] and [[Hol'anyee Marshal|sister]] said we wouldn't find anything of worth here in the Vale. Hah! And I'm just getting started!

==Notes==
[[Mai'Zoth]] is at the very bottom of the ogre mound, and has two body guards. [[Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound|Mosh'Ogg]] is in north-eastern [[Stranglethorn Vale]]. If you can sap/sheep/whatever the two bodyguards, [[Mai'Zoth]] isn't too difficult to take out.
