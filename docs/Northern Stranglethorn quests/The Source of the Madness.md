==Objectives==
Obtain a Whispering Blue Stone from Kurzen troops within [[Stockpile|the Stockpile]].
*[[Whispering Blue Stone]]

==Description==
After reducing the [[basilisk]] blood out of the elixir, I've uncovered an unusual precipitate. It appears to be a blue crystal of some sort...

<[[Brother Nimetz]] consults his notes.>

It's not a [[Singing Blue Crystal|singing blue crystal]]... not a [[Pulsing Blue Shard|pulsing blue shard]]...

<He flips forward a few pages.>

... not a piece of the [[Mind's Eye]]. Nope, this isn't something we've seen before in [[Stranglethorn]]. If anyone has any more of this substance, I want it. Check the high-ranking Kurzen troops, in the back of their cave.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||18}}

==Progress==
Make sure you handle that stuff carefully, <name>.  We don't know what it is. 

==Completion==
<Brother Nimetz opens up a pouch and lets you place the crystal inside.>

I knew they'd have some more of this substance.  I'm going to send this to my contacts at [[Fort Livingston]], to the south.  Hopefully they'll have some more luck with it.

Thank you for everything, <name>. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stopping Kurzen's Legacy]] before heading out. The mouth of the cave is at {{co|59|19|Northern Stranglethorn}} at the northeastern end of [[Kurzen's Compound]].

Enter the cave and keep left to find [[Chief Anders]] at {{co|63.7|16.7|Northern Stranglethorn}} in a dead end. Back track a few yards, and go down the ramp, then turn around again at the split heading further downhill. In the back of this room at {{co|62.4|14.1|Northern Stranglethorn}} is [[Chief Gaulus]]. Backtrack and exit the room, then go straight into the southeastern part of the ramp split area. On the right side of the cave near to the supplies at {{co|65.8|17.1|Northern Stranglethorn}} is [[Chief Miranda]]. Keep heading back to the end to find at {{co|66.1|11.7|Northern Stranglethorn}} behind a table [[Chief Esquivel]].

Hopefully, by this point, the [[Whispering Blue Stone]] will have dropped, but if not, keep killing troops until it does.

This concludes the Kurzen portion of the Northern Stranglethorn storyline. [[Corporal Kaleb]] will send players to [[Nesingwary's Expedition]] via [[Krazek's Cookery]], [[Corporal Sethman]] will send players scouting the [[Bal'lal Ruins]] via [[Deep Roots (quest)]] alongside [[Berrin Burnquill]] with [[Bloodscalp Insight (Alliance)]], and [[Emerine Junis]] will send adventurers on a hunt for water elemental bracers with [[Water Elementals (quest)]].
