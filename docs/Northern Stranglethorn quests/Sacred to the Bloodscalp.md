==Objectives==
Obtain an Icon of Tsul'kalu, an Icon of Mahamba, and an Icon of Pogeyan from [[Bloodscalp]] trolls in the [[Tkashi Ruins]].
*[[Icon of Tsul'Kalu]]
*[[Icon of Mahamba]]
*[[Icon of Pogeyan]]

==Description==
Ahh... these must be names of their totemic creatures - the animals that they attribute to the spirits. Let's see... [[Mahamba]] as water, [[Tsul'Kalu]] as earth, [[Pogeyan]] as... air? Fire? I can't make this part out.

I'd like some more information on these spirits of theirs. The Bloodscalp have a camp close to here, in the Tkashi ruins. Maybe you can find some details there. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tsul'kalu's Strikers
|Mahamba's Caress
|Bloodscalp Sandals
|Wildhammer Scribe's Band
|Mahamba's Pauldrons
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
It's likely that these totemic creatures are based on some of the fantastic creatures that roam this jungle. 

==Completion==
First you save me from the madman's jail cell, and now you bring me some keys to understanding trollish shamanism.

This is turning out to be a pretty good week!

Thank you again, <name>.  I will see to it that you have the support of the [[Wildhammer clan]] as you continue on your journeys.
