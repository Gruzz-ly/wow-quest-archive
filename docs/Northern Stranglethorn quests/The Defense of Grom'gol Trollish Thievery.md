==Objectives==
Obtain the Grom'gol Rations from the [[Bal'lal Ruins|Bal'lal ruins]].
*[[Grom'gol Rations]]

==Description==
The [[troll]]s leave us well enough alone here in [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]]. Most trolls know that the [[Horde]] can easily crush them when angered, and the trolls here in [[Stranglethorn Vale|Stranglethorn]] are no exception.

The [[Bloodscalp]] have been more active lately, however. As lately as last week, they sent a party into Grom'gol and stole several cases of rations.

Stealing food is the most forgivable type of theft, but I still can't let it happen under my watch. Head north, to the Bal'lal ruins, and return our property.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pitiless Pauldrons
|Bal'lal Belt
|Unforgiving Pantaloons
|Bal'lal Waistguard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Horde]]

==Progress==
Pity has no place under my command. The trolls can find food elsewhere. It's a big jungle.

==Completion==
<Commander Aggro'gosh salutes you.>

The Horde thanks you, <name>. Grom'gol is protected, if only for today.

==Notes==
This quest should be done along with [[Hunt for Yenniku]] and [[Bloodscalp Insight (Horde)]]. The quest [[Favored Skull (Horde)]] becomes available while doing them.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Bal'lal Waistguard]] added as a reward.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
