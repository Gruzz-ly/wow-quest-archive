==Objectives==
Bring [[Krazek's Fixed Pot]] to [[Corporal Kaleb]] at the [[Rebel Camp]].

==Description==
While you were gone I fixed the pot you brought me. I even added an extra steam whistle, and look! There's a new chopper at the bottom that'll cut through leg bones!

Yes yes, Krazek's Crock Pot is a 100% cook pleaser! I'm sure its owner will be satisfied. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost||25|}}
|Cap of Harmony

You will also receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
It's fixed! This is great, now I can get dinner started! Thanks so much, <name>.

I hope Krazek didn't give you too much trouble.
