==Objectives==
Return to [[Nimboya]] at [[Grom'gol Base Camp]] and show him your Lashtail Hatchling's new skull. 

==Description==
Your pet raptor seems to have found a new toy: a skull, from a nearby troll skull pile.

What sets this skull apart from the rest is beyond you, but for some reason, she won't put it down.

Nimboya at Grom'gol Base Camp seems to be somewhat of a skull expert, judging by the skull piles he keeps. Maybe he'll have some idea what makes this one so special. 

==Completion==
What do we have here? A young raptor, and her pet <race>. Hah!

More importantly, what is that skull you have there? This was no ordinary troll. He was big...

<Nimboya raps on the headcase.>

... and strong, too. Let's see what we can do with this one.

Don't go anywhere.

==Rewards==
None.

==Notes==
This quest becomes available while doing the quests [[The Defense of Grom'gol: Trollish Thievery]] and [[Hunt for Yenniku]]. [[Ohgan'aka]] runs to a pile of skulls and grabs one of them.

After completing the quest, Nimboya throws the skull in his [[Bubbling Cauldron]] and says:

*{{text|say|Nimboya|Watch Nimboya do what Nimboya does best.}}
*{{text|say|Nimboya|Throw de big skull in de pot!}}
*{{text|say|Nimboya|Throw de mojos on de skull!}}
*{{text|say|Nimboya|Magic's done.}}
