==Objectives==
Destroy 12 Lashtail Eggs.
*[[Lashtail Egg]] slain (12)

==Description==
[[Orcish (language)|Throm'ka]], <class>!

Your arrival at [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]] is timely, indeed. Our mission to provide a safe chain of supply to [[Stonard]] is being hampered by some of the local inhabitants.

I am putting you in charge of eliminating the [[raptor]] population outside of Grom'gol, just to the north. Don't worry about the raptors themselves... those wretched [[Nesingwary's Expedition|Nesingwary]] hunters will take care of them.

I want you to destroy their eggs.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||18|}}

==Progress==
I start you out with the simplest task for a reason, <name>. Do not fail me.

==Completion==
Keep up the good work, <class>. [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]'s eyes are upon you.

==Notes==
The quest [[A Lashtail Hatchling]] is accepted automatically upon destruction of the twelfth egg, beginning a storyline involving [[Ohgan'aka]], [[Bloodlord Mandokir]] and [[Jin'do the Hexxer]].
