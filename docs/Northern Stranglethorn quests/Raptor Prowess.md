==Objectives==
Hunt 10 Jungle Stalkers. 
*[[Jungle Stalker (raptor)|Jungle Stalker]] slain (10)

==Description==
A particularly cagey brand of [[raptor]], known by locals as the "Jungle Stalker", prowls the forests to the south, across the river. They are far more difficult to track down and kill than the other breeds you've been trying your luck at.

Killing these Jungle Stalkers will undoubtedly make for a good tale around the fire.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Bah!  What are you doing standing around, <name>!  A true big game hunter never gives up once his prey is in his sights.  Those Jungle Stalkers aren't going to come running up to this campfire and throw themselves in it.  Silly bloke.

==Completion==
You are no longer just a raptor hunter.  You are an honest-to-goodness raptor SLAYER.

Though one fabled raptor still eludes you...

==Progression==
