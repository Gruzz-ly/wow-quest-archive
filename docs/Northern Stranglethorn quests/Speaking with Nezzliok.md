In '''Speaking with Nezzliok''', the dead witch doctor [[Nezzliok]] asks you to steal trophies from the [[Bloodscalp]]'s enemies, the [[Skullsplitter Tribe|Skullsplitters]]. After you do this, he will reveal the whereabouts of the [[Darkspear]] chief's son, [[Yenniku]]. This quest is in a long chain, all available in [[Grom'gol Base Camp|Grom'gol]], the first being [[Hunt for Yenniku]] which can be obtained from [[Nimboya]] at the north exit to the camp.

==Objectives==
Obtain a Balia'mah Trophy and a Ziata'jai Trophy from the Skullsplitter ruins in Northern Stranglethorn.
* [[Balia'mah Trophy]]
* [[Ziata'jai Trophy]]

==Description==
<The head of Nezzliok speaks.>

It is true. I know where the child of the Darkspears was taken. You have bested me and bound my spirit, but I will say nothing without appeasement!

The Bloodscalps war with the Skullsplitters. To gain my favor, steal two of their most-prized trophy skulls from the Skullsplitters across the river to the east. Place them here with us, so that my spirit will have slaves in the Nether. One skull must be from their trophy pile in Balia'mah, the other from Ziata'jai.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:

* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

== Progress ==
I await the skulls...

== Completion ==
Yes.  These will serve me well.  When my spirit is freed, I will enter the Nether with some fine servants indeed!

You are a credit to your <race> clan, and you have appeased me.
