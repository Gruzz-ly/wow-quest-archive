==Objectives==
Collect 6 Offerings to Hakkar to attract the [[loa]].
*[[Offering to Hakkar]] (6)
*Return to [[Jani]]

==Description==
If dis loa be huntin' here, he may have seen us already. Since we don't know for sure, let's split up.

I be hunting for him, while ya get his attention. Jani says the loa has been taking the offerings meant for [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]], the loa of blood.

But we don't know WHY. Collect some and see if he wants them. If his motive is something else... we be knowin' soon enough.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
<[[Kevo ya Siti]] examines your offerings.>

==Completion==
<Kevo ya Siti accepts the offerings silently.>

I don't be wanting dese offerings myself. Slowing Hakkar's return benefits us all.

It will take more than just remembering. Your hunt is just beginning.

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest:
:{{Text|say|Jani|Some baddies over here. Come along, or not. Me don't care.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Rokhan]]|Jani seems to know a good spot. I be meeting with ya soon.}}
:''Jani heads off, Rokhan follows him.''

Following Jani:
:{{Text|say|Jani|Sneaky loa was here. I bet dere be more prey around!}}

The area in front of Jani has corpses of trolls. He has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
I think our lost Darkspear loa be hunting Hakkari priests. Dis be great news for us.

If he hates dem, he won't be a friend to Mueh'zala.
}}

Head to either the south-east or south-west area of [[Zul'Gurub]] and kill [[Hakkari Ritualist]]s, [[Foul Offering]]s, and [[Animated Offering]]s to collect offerings to [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]].

Upon collecting two offerings:
:{{Text|say|???|I see ya.}}

Upon collecting all the tributes:
:{{Text|say|???|Hunting my prey, are you?}}

Upon meeting up with Jani and Rokhan:
:{{Text|say|Jani|Big loa be real close! Peel your peepers.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Behind you, Jani.}}
:''Kevo ya Siti appears behind Jani, spooking him.''
:{{Text|yell|Jani|AHH!}}
:{{Text|say|Jani|[[Kevo ya Siti]]! What ya do dat for? Sneakybeast.}}
:{{Text|emote|Kevo ya Siti releases a low, sinister chuckle.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|De Darkspear have forgotten you for too long. I want to change dat.}}
:{{Text|say|Kevo ya Siti|Where is ya mask? Ya [[rush'kah]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|We seek to remake dem. We need your aid to defeat Mueh'zala's influence.}}

Jani and Rokhan have new gossip after:
{{dialogue|title=Jani|Cunning loa be too sneaky!}}
{{dialogue|title=Rokhan|Many loa were--and are--worshipped here in Zul'Gurub. Many of them are not friends to de Darkspear.}}
