==Objectives==
Use the Gift of Naias near the [[Altar of Naias]] to summon the water elemental [[Naias]]. Defeat him and return to Nemeth Hawkeye at Grom’gol Base Camp with the Heart of Naias.
*[[Heart of Naias]]
*[[Gift of Naias]] (provided)

==Description==
So this Naias is the mastermind behind the Bloodscalp and their exotic magic? I’ll admit, this is the last place I expected my inquiry to lead, but no matter, our findings may still prove useful.

Off the coast to the northwest is an island inhabited by lesser water elementals. There’s a crude stone slab there that might serve as an altar for the likes of the trolls.  Take the totem you found to that altar. Let’s see if we can draw this Naias out and distill his power into a more agreeable form.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Junglewalker Boots
|Monnions of Raw Power
|Blade of Exotic Magic
|Shouldersguards of Raw Power
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
What news of Naias, <name>?

==Completion==
I can feel the raw power contained in this gem, <name>. I'll send it to Silvermoon for our magisters to study further, but I am sure it will prove useful in our struggle against the Amani.

Your help has been invaluable in procuring this gem, and I will see to it that the Farstriders know the name of the <race> who made this find possible.

==Notes==
The stone altar is at 19,22, on the large island off the coast of northwest Stranglethorn Vale, in the Vile Reef. It is populated with water elementals. Naias is pretty easy. He does not have any special abilities or resistances, except for the standard water elemental ones.

This quest should be done along with [[Headhunting]] and [[A Nose for This Sort of Thing (Horde)]].
