==Objectives==
Obtain [[Nezzliok's Head]] from [[Nezzliok the Dire]] in [[Zul'Kunda]].

==Description==
[[Yenniku]] was not among the heads, and I thank the Great Serpent for it.  But we are no closer to finding him.

We must know the truth, and I fear that only the [[Bloodscalp]] [[witchdoctor]] will know it.  He is an enemy of the [[Darkspear tribe]] and will not speak freely, so we must force the truth from his dead lips!

Bring me the head of Nezzliok the Dire and place it within this cauldron.

He is deep within Zul'Kunda.  Bring his head...we will then make it talk.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|4500}} (or {{coppercost|1680}} at max level)

==Progress==
The greenish broth within the cauldron bubbles.

==Completion==
You place the head of Nezzliok within the cauldron...

==Notes==
This quest should be done along with [[Who's a Big Troll?]] and [[Population Con-Troll (Horde)]].
