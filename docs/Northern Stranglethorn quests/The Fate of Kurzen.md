==Objectives==
Obtain the Kurzen Compound Prison Records and the Kurzen Compound Officers' Dossier.
*[[Kurzen Compound Prison Records]] {{co|57.9|22.9|Northern Stranglethorn}}
*[[Kurzen Compound Officers' Dossier]] {{co|57.9|23.7|Northern Stranglethorn}}

== Description ==
Hello, <class>.

We are soldiers of [[Stormwind]], and rebels from [[Kurzen's Compound]], a large outpost that you'll find just to the southeast of here. We were under the command of [[Colonel Kurzen]], until he and those close to him started to descend into madness...

We rebelled, set up camp here, and stood against Kurzen. Now, my sources are telling me Kurzen has disappeared. I trust my source, but it would help to hear from a third party. Please, head into the compound and find some documentation of his fate. 

== Progress ==
What were you able to find, <name>? 

== Completion ==
They KILLED him?  And all this time, I thought he had them underneath an iron bootheel... 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||18}}

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Bad Medicine]] before heading out.

At [[Kurzen's Compound]], the prison records are on the ground at {{co|57.9|22.9|Northern Stranglethorn}} a yard west of the saw blade at the [[lumber mill]], and officers' dossier is on the ground at {{co|57.9|23.7|Northern Stranglethorn}} at the southern end of the lumber mill.

Kill any Kurzen commandos as well looking for [[Jungle Remedy]]. Additionally, upon looting the seventh vial of jungle remedy, the adventurer will also find the [[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]], which starts [[Just Hatched]].
