==Objectives==
Use the Gift of Naias to summon [[Naias]], then obtain the Heart of Naias.
*[[Heart of Naias]]
*[[Gift of Naias]] (provided)

== Description ==
The salt you brought was sufficient to activate the bracers' innate enchantments. I have taken these enchantments and combined them into a summoning token... a gift, if you will.

Return to the Isle of Naias, and place the gift on Naias' altar. Call me again once you have Naias' heart. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Junglewalker Boots
|Salt-Cured Monnions
|Emerine's Blade
|Salt-Cured Mantle
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
I eagerly await the results. 

== Completion ==
My colleagues within the [[Kirin Tor]] will be happy to learn that the heart is ours.

Thank you for your assistance, <name>.  I couldn't have done it without you.
