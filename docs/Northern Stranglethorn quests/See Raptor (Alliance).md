: {{text|say|Bloodlord Mandokir|Welcome to Zul'Gurub, little one.  It might not look like much now, but give it time...}}
: {{text|say|Bloodlord Mandokir|Ahh... it's good to be home.}}
: {{text|say|Bloodlord Mandokir|There's plenty others of your kind here, but I wouldn't worry about competition.  You're from the bloodline of Ohgan, my oldest friend.  You see... our souls are intertwined, yours and mine.}}
