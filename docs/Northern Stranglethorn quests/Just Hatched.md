==Objectives==
Bring the [[Lashtail Hatchling]] to [[Corporal Sethman]] at the [[Rebel Camp]] in [[Northern Stranglethorn]].
*[[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
While looking through this soldier's possessions, you look down to see a newborn raptor hatchling looking back up at you.  Was it following this Kurzen militiaman the whole time?

You can see it studying you, learning your features and following your movements.

The lashtail hatchling has formed a bond with you.

Perhaps someone back at the Rebel Camp will know what to do with a raptor hatchling.

==Completion==
Yes, the little one seems to have taken a liking to you. You're lucky... at this age, the raptors are calm, peaceful, and easily trained. Keep her, <name>... she may come in handy.

In fact...

==Notes==
Adventurers will find the [[Lashtail Raptor Egg Fragment]] at the same time they find the seventh vial of [[Jungle Remedy]] for [[Bad Medicine]]. If for some reason players were not in [[Northern Stranglethorn]] when they got credit for finding the seventh vial, [[Corporal Sethman]] at the [[Rebel Camp]] will offer the quest instead.

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2010-12-07|bluenote=If a player completes the objectives of [[Bad Medicine]] outside of Northern Stranglethorn, then this quest  will not auto-launch, but [[Corporal Sethman]] will have the quest available when the player turns in the quest "Bad Medicine" to [[Brother Nimetz]]. If the player completes "Bad Medicine" within Northern Stranglethorn, then "Just Hatched" is auto-launched.}}
