==Objectives==
Show the weaponization orders to [[Rexxar]] at [[Breaker's Crown]].
*[[Weaponization Orders]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Gronnslaver Raz|Raz]],

Your orders are to capture four additional [[gronn]] for weaponization.

Of your first group, only one survived the entire process.

One attacked our soldiers relentlessly and had to be put down. Another fell victim to a misfire while being fitted. Yet another rolled onto its cannons in its sleep. We're still cleaning up that mess.

Rest assured, your efforts are not in vain.

- Captain Brak

==Rewards==
You will receive:

==Progress==
Weaponizing gronn? If they succeed...

==Completion==
This is grim news, <name>.

==Notes==
In the area for [[Bad at Breaking]] and [[Nisha's Vengeance]], find the book of Weaponization orders in the back of a cart not far from [[Gronnslaver Raz]].
