==Objectives==
Collect Enriched Seeds.
*[[Enriched Seeds (quest item)]] (provided)

These seeds have been shielded with care by the [[botani]].

Great power can be felt surging out of these tiny vessels of life.

These may prove useful.

You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
Seeds. So simple to look at but in each the potential for untold amounts of destruction. Much like my son.

You were wise to take these.

==Notes==
In the area with the [[Voice of Iyu]] in the Razorbloom, find the Primal Seeds in the clearing just to the north.
