==Objectives==
Bring the Glowing Red Pod to [[Grulkor]] at [[Crimson Fen]].
*[[Glowing Red Pod#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
This pod is similar to the ones growing on or near the bodies around here, except this one is pulsating weirdly.

Grulkor might know more about this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's this?  Let me check if it has a skull...

==Notes==
While in the [[Crimson Fen]] for [[Basic Skulltaking]], players will come across the [[Dying Skulltaker]], who starts [[Skulltaker's Revenge]]. That quest has players killing [[Fungal Lurcher]]s, of which the first will drop the [[Glowing Red Pod]], which starts this quest.

==Progression==
{{Crimson Fen}}
