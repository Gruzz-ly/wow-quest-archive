==Objectives==
Speak to [[Glirin]] outside [[Tangleheart]].

==Description==
The Rangari have been here for a tick, and they hear tell from the Laughing Skull o' a place called Tangleheart.

Seems some really bad ancients come from there, and [[botani]] use a kind o' sap to grow them quickly.

I think we could use that for yer outpost. Hey, wood is wood, right?

I'll meet ya there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|15}}
*10500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Cheers! Found a goblin skulkin' about here. Think I'll keep 'er around. Says she knows things about lumberjackin'.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Glirin|See ya at Tangleheart.}}

Pick up [[Deeproot (quest)]] and [[Rangari in the Red]] before heading out. Do the Rangari in the Red side chain at [[Crimson Fen]] or not, then exit [[Highpass]] to the south, cutting through [[Mistcreep Mire]]. Head southeast in the mire to reach the [[Tangleheart]], or southwest to get to [[Tangleroot]]. Immediately south of the water on the east side, keep an eye out for Gorgrond's [[Mysterious Flower (Gorgrond)|Mysterious Flower]].

To the southeast, just outside of [[Tangleheart]], [[Glirin]] has [[Glyza]] in his sights:
