==Objectives==
Slay 6 Infested.
*[[Infested]] slain (6)

==Description==
[[Rangari D'kaan|D'kaan]] did not say it, but there were more rangari taken by the [[botani]] than the ones you found.

He believes they were slain. I fear worse.

You might dare to venture into the [[Razorbloom]]. If you do, you may discover what the botani do to their... "prisoners."

Give these poor souls a proper release.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
One truth of Gorgrond: death is not the worst thing that can happen to you.

==Completion==
I thank you for doing what I could not.

While it is the right thing to do, it is hard to loose the arrow when your target was once a friend.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Razorbloom (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Northeast past the flight path (which got picked up, right?) into the [[Razorbloom]]. Start killing [[Infested Orc]]s and [[Infested Behemoth]]s. The three named dwarves are marked on the minimap on the edge of the central pond, but [[Razzlebeard]] holds [[Razzlebeard's Report]] in his left hand, which concludes "The Razorbloom". Turn that quest in and pick up [[The Voice of Iyu (Alliance)]]. Do that quest and pick up [[Super Seeds (Alliance)]] from the [[Enriched Seeds]] in the clearing north of the hollowed-out tree with the [[Voice of Iyu]], then head back to camp.

On return:
:{{text|say|Yrel|Why did you join us, Kaalya? If we are such an inconvenience, why not leave us to our own devices?}}
:{{text|sy|Rangari Kaalya|Rangari do not leave people behind.}}
