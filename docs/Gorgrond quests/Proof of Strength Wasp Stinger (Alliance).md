==Objectives==
Take the proof to [[Rangari Jonaa]] at [[Highpass]] in [[Gorgrond]].
*[[Wasp Stinger (Gorgrond)]]

==Description==
This stinger is proof of your strength at slaying ancients{{sic}} and your gladiator friend has born witness!

Take the stinger back to Jonaa and claim your accolades!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90|}}
*14,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
As you can see, the venom Gorgrond [[wasp]]s have is extremely powerful. To face one is to possibly face your own death. I would refrain from harvesting more of these, one enough to prove your strength here!
