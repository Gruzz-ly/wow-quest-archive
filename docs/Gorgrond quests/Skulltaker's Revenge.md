==Objectives==
Kill 7 Fungal Lurchers.
*[[Fungal Lurcher]] slain (7)

==Description==
The others... gone or wandered into the haze. It called to me as well but I am too strong.

I chose to kill until they crushed my body. I haven't killed enough of them yet <name>, not enough! Go. Kill more of them and tell my hunt leader that I don't go alone into the dark.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hah! If he was that strong he'd still be alive.  Still it is good you did him honor.  Did you take his skull by any chance?

==Notes==
In the [[Crimson Fen]] for [[Basic Skulltaking]], find the Dying Skulltaker on the path near the north end of the fen. He starts this quest. Kill a [[Fungal Lurcher]] and it will drop a [[Glowing Red Pod]], which starts [[Mysterious Pod (Horde)]].

==Progression==
