==Objectives==
Find [[Frenna]] within [[Tangleheart]].

==Description==
All o' them [[mole machine]]s got mighty unreliable here in [[Gorgrond]]. I hear tell that one of 'em might've crashed here in Tangleheart.

See if you can find Frenna. She would've been on the one we tracked to this location. I'll go lookin' for the mole machine to see if it can be repaired.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|30}}
*18700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Frenna didn't make it out of Tangleheart.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Growing Wood (Alliance)]] before heading out. Then follow the path a hundred or so yards to find [[Frenna]]'s corpse. Turn in this quest, then pick up her followups.

==Progression==
