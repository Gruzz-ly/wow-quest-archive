==Objectives==
Find a [[Laughing Skull Orcs|Laughing Skull]] clansman.
*Peacefully approach [[Deadgrin]]

==Description==
Ah, <name>, good. I need someone who is not of my clan to negotiate with the Laughing Skull.

We could use their help navigating this land, but they are dangerous and unpredictable, much like [[Gorgrond]] itself.

Follow this road and seek out someone willing to speak with you.

Perhaps they will see you as something new and be willing to talk first and stab later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ha! Curious. What are you?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Durotan|They may be mad, but they are the only orc clan familiar with this savage land. We may need to rely upon their knowledge.}}
:{{text|say|[[Draka (alternate universe)|Draka]]|Husband, please reconsider. No good can come of this.}}

Head northeast to Deadgrin. Upon approach, a giant boulder suddenly appears and crashes into the village, knocking the player back a short distance. Ripfist runs out of the village and crouches down in front of the entrance to the settlement, apparently wounded. Speak with him to proceed.
