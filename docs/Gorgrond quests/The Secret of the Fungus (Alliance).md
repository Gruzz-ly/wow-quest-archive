==Objectives==
Collect 5 Glowing Mushrooms.
*[[Glowing Mushroom]] (5)

==Description==
I'm beginning to sense a strong... connection... between the fungus and the creatures that inhabit it. There are certain mushrooms that are stronger than others.

I believe if I had some samples of these I could use them, track the source of this foul fungus and... deal with it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where are my mushrooms?!

==Completion==
Sadly, I'm growing used to the smell of these spores.  In fact, they smell quite pleasant now.  Perhaps if I ate these it will speed up our work here...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Mercy for the Living]] before heading out.

Plenty of fungus-covered shamblers (both orc and draenei) and orange-capped mushrooms in the area.

==Progression==
{{Crimson Fen}}
