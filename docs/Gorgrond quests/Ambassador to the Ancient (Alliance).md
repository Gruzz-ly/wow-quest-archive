==Objectives==
Talk to [[Birchus]] at [[Dionor's Demise]] in [[Gorgrond]].
*Talked to Birchus {{co|50.3|47.5|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
It appears that a [[genesaur]] was killed here not long ago and this growth has sprung up. It is stirring up the local monsters and I fear for [[Highpass|our outpost]].

There is a strange ancient that wallows in grief here and is not hostile. Perhaps you could "harvest" its story?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What did you learn from the ancient?

==Completion==
So the normal ebb and flow of battle has been disrupted by the [[saberon]]. I don't think it wise to leave things as such.

We should see about infiltrating the saberon and setting things right.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Plant Pruning (Alliance)]] before heading out.

At the southern end of the forested area, find a pile of [[Hardened Thornvine]], which can be shredded by players who chose the Lumber Mill to find an [[Aged Stone Container]].

Birchus is found on the east side of the forested area near the north end of the quest area, standing a dozen yards away from the corpse of [[Dionor the Carnivorous]].
:I should crush you but what would be the point... I have failed in my duties and can only wait until I am crushed to dust...
{{gossip|''Thank you for not killing me. What duty have you failed?''}}
:Dionor was a powerful and bold champion of our kind. He sought to break the ancient lines of battle and take the fight to the enemy.
:It ended with his defeat at the hands of several [[Magnaron]]... Here he fell, some of his energy creating a small sanctuary for those of us that remained until I could fulfill my duty... but I cannot...
{{gossip|''What were you supposed to do?''}}
:When a champion like Dionor falls, a Death Bloom will grow from his husk. I was to collect this Bloom and perform a sacred rite here to release his life force back to the overgrowth.
:As I was about to do this I was set upon by [[saberon|fur-covered two legs]] and they took the Bloom first. We tried to follow but they raised barriers and used fire to drive us back.
:So now I stand vigil over my failure until we are all ground into the tortured soil by our great enemy...
{{gossip|''So getting that bloom back might fix things... interesting...''}}

At the northern end of the quest area, [[Char the Burning]], a rare [[Draenor ancient]], has been set alight by some [[Grom'kar Pyro]]s. Loot Char's corpse for [[Char's Smoldering Fist]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]]. Additionally, to the northwest, elite [[steam elemental]] [[Erosian the Violent]] is found. An objective of [[Gorgrond Monster Hunter]], Erosian drops [[Crystalized Steam]], which starts [[Trophy of Glory: Erosian]].

Alatur has moved from his previous spot to a small cave a hundred or so yards west of Birchus, halfway up the hill.
