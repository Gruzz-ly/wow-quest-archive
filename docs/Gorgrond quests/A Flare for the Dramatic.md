==Objectives==
Shoot Penny's Flare Gun while in [[Deadgrin]].
*Fire Penny's Flare Gun
*[[Penny's Flare Gun]] (provided)

==Description==
I received a strange object with a note attached. Here, it seems to be written in your tongue, commander.

<Dear Mister Durotan, I'm [[Penny Clobberbottom|Penny]]... you know, from [[Azeroth]]? We met briefly back at [[Frostwall|<name>'s garrison]].

Anyway, like I told you, I have a fifth degree black hammer in engineering and I'm eager to serve. The more danger the better!

You just fire this old flare whenever you're in trouble and I'll be there, quick as a quark!

Hopefully, Penny>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
* 14100 XP

==Progress==
Hey there, commander!

==Completion==
That didn't seem to do much, commander, except to give away our position to every creature in Gorgrond.

Wait, did you hear something?

==Notes==
Upon completing the quest, a short cutscene plays, showing a rocket crashing into the [[Broken Spine]] a short distance away while a female goblin parachutes down to the ground.
