==Objectives==
Speak to [[Bony Xuk]] at [[Affliction Ridge]].

==Description==
Beasts of the western wasteland fight an endless war with the creatures of the eastern wilds.

If one side were to overwhelm the other, all of Draenor would be doomed at the hand of the victor.

The Laughing Skull seek revenge for their destroyed village. I have directed them to aim their vengeance at the nearby creatures, that our outpost here might be preserved.

If you would, commander, oversee their efforts. I have not yet grown to trust the Laughing Skull.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I can see the future of my enemies in the bones. They're gonna die!

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Sparring Arena}}

==Patch changes==
