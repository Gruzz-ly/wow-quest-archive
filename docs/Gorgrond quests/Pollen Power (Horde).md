==Objectives==
Collect 20 Potent Pollen.
*[[Potent Pollen]] (20)

==Description==
Those of us who grew up in [[Gorgrond]] have long learned a few secrets of the [[botani]] that can be used to grow our own plants.

There is no such thing as a hungry Laughing Skull for this reason.

The ravagers are the key.

Outside of Evermorn Springs you will find ravagers of every type. Slay them and bring me the pollen they carry, and I can cultivate it to be of use to your garrison.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]
*50x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
Few dare challenge the botani in the field of growing plants.

==Completion==
Ah yes yes yes. Fresh pollen. With a dash of a few secret ingredients you can feed an army with the food you could grow from this, if you know the secret ways.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cutter (quest)]] and [[Bushwhacker (Horde)]] before heading out.

Get to killing [[Golden Pollinator]]s and [[Thicket Ravager]]s before entering [[Evermorn Springs]].

==Progression==
