==Objectives==
Use the detonator to blow open the prison train, and convince Roark to join your cause.
*Plant First Explosive
*Plant Second Explosive
*Plant Third Explosive
*Blow Open the Train
*Recruit [[Solog Roark]]

==Description==
These rangari will surround and cover the train car. Hit the detonator to blow open the doors.

I will try to talk Roark into joining our cause. He's a genius around a drydock and our best hope for building a shipyard.

If it doesn't work, we must be prepared to kill him. The last thing we need is someone rebuilding another Iron Fleet...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
*1,510 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Lower your weapon, stranger. Blackhand is dead and our new "Warchief" just signed my death sentence. It looks like I'm going [[mercenary]].

You want to build a shipyard? Then you want me.

==Notes==
: ''Blowing open the doors, several former Iron Horde scramble away to freedom.  Solog Roark is inside.  Yrel hefts her [[Hammer of the Naaru|hammer]] just in case and speaks with a strong voice.''
: {{text|say|Exarch Yrel|We seek Solog Roark!}}
: ''Solog walks to the doorway and jumps down. Yrel lowers her weapon.  Solog answers with an equally strong voice.''
: {{text|say|Solog Roark|You found him.  If you wish me dead, put a hammer in my hands and let's make a fight of it.}}
: {{text|say|Exarch Yrel|We don't want you dead.  We need a shipwright.}}
: ''Solog starts walking over to the other side of the detonator.''
: {{text|say|Solog Roark|Hah!  There's none better.}}
