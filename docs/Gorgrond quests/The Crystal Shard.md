==Objectives==
Collect 25 Goren Crystals from [[Longtooth Gorger]]s.
*[[Goren Crystal]] (25)

==Description==
I'm glad you arrived when you did.

The [[Laughing Skull Orcs|Laughing Skull orcs]] practice some strange spirit magic, but one of their traditions could be quite useful in our situation.

While I make preparations, can you gather the reagents?

First, we'll need crystals from the husks of goren corpses. You can find their bodies in the canyon.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 534 necklaces|Xuk's Good Xuk Charm|Laughing Skull Trophy Necklace|Xuk's Spirit-Speaking Chain|Xuk's Fingerbone Pouch|Xuk's Bad Xuk Charm}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have learned some of the Laughing Skull traditions. This is less strange than many.

==Completion==
Goren crystals are used by some as weapons. The acid left behind can be deadly, though, even to the wielder.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hard Shell]], [[Bad at Breaking]], and [[Nisha's Vengeance]] before heading out.

Head southwest into [[Drywind Gorge]], killing goren and looting their crystals all the way. On the west side of the gorge behind a pillar of rocks, find at {{co|43.3|51.7|Gorgrond}} an [[Odd Boulder]]. This one contains the [[Ancient Titan Chest]].

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Sparring Arena}}
