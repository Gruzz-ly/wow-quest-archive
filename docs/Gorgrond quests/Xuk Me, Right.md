==Objectives==
Collect 9 Goren Shells from [[Boneyard Gorger]]s.
*[[Goren Shell]] (9)

==Description==
The magics Xuk is weaving will let you perform great acts, but preparations must be made before the spirits will bless us with their power.

Xuk needs many shells from the pesky goren. To gather them, Xuk will share a secret.

Approach their tunnel craters and the goren will pour out. This way, you kill many at once.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Xuk Xuk.

==Completion==
Ahh, yes. Xuk is one step closer to performing a miracle.

==Notes==
Pick up [[What the Bony Xuk?]], [[Bad at Breaking]], and [[Nisha's Vengeance]] before heading out.

Head southwest into [[Drywind Gorge]], killing goren and looting their crystals all the way.
