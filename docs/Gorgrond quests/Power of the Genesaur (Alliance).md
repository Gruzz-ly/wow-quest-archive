==Objectives==
Speak with [[Vindicator Maraad]] at [[Highpass]] in [[Gorgrond]].

==Description==
Commander, you now have the Will of the Genesaur along with the genesis water and enough seeds to grow an army. Not to mention the lives of the dwarves you saved.

I would call this mission a success.

I can help the dwarves mop up their operation here and see what we can salvage. In the meantime, you may want to bring the artifact to Maraad back at the outpost.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*23900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well done, Commander. Many of the orcs have tried to master the power of the genesaur but I have never heard of any of them reaching this level of success.

This should provide us a substantial advantage in the days ahead.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Service of Rangari Kaalya]] before heading out. Then take the flight path back, or do [[Tailthrasher Basin (bonus objective)]] for some bonus gold and experience and a few treasure chests and rare mobs.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill Alliance}}
