==Objectives==
Find [[Khaano]] near the [[Crimson Fen]] in [[Gorgrond]].

==Description==
Gorgrond is a very dangerous place and I've sent scouting squads out to investigate various regions.

I've sent one squad to the marsh called the Crimson Fen and they've not come back yet. I'd like you to find the missing squad and get a report if possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|45}}
*11850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Rangari D'kaan|D'kaan]] sent you? He's not likely to enjoy the report I have to give him.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Deeproot (quest)]] and [[Tangleheart (Alliance)]] before heading out. Head east back toward the path, then jump down near the bridge and head south to the [[Crimson Fen]].

==Progression==
