== Objectives ==
Burn 6 [[Mulching Body|Mulching Bodies]].
*Bodies burned x6

== Description ==
You don't understand. Anythin' these [[botani|plant people]] don't infest they fatten up and then turn inta mulch.

I say we take out their food source.

These botani got a few corpses lying around that I saw. Might be a good idea to burn those bodies.

Let's find out if they can infest ash.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
* 21150 XP

==Progress==
If I survive this, I'm gonna get even by becomin' a vegetarian.

==Completion==
Normally I'm not a violent dwarf, but I ain't about to sit by and get turned into a bush. And I ain't about to let others do the same.

==Notes==
*Pick up [[A Green Ogron? (Alliance)]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill Alliance}}
