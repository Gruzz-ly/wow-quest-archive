==Objectives==
Find 8 Herb Bundles in saberon stashes at [[Steamscar Rise]].
*[[Saberon Herb Bundle]] (8)

==Description==
You are attracted by a low green glow to the container. Inside there is a glowing bundle of herbs that was most likely stolen from [[Dionor's Demise|the overgrowth below]].

It would be best to collect all of these so the [[saberon]] don't continue their dabbling in plant magic and irritating the nearby [[magnaron]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The saberon should definitely NOT have any of the herbs you have found!

==Completion==
A good catch discovering those herbs <name>. We cannot allow them to continue using these. Who knows what it might set off.

==Notes==
While in the area for [[Saberon Population Reduction]], find the [[Saberon Stash]] a few dozen yards to the south of [[Altauur]], which offers this quest.

Altauur has moved again, and this time is uphill to the south/northeast of where he was before, up the hill at the south end of the high clearing.

==Progression==
{{Dionor's Demise}}
