==Objectives==
Investigate the strange presence at Crimson Fen.
*Strange Fungus Site inspected {{co|58.9|62.6|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
I can feel a powerful presence in the marsh, <name>. I feel drawn to it. We must go and take what is there.

Go on ahead, I must finish consuming these mushrooms.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We are so close I can almost touch it!  We will have to go deeper, much deeper!

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Grim Harvest (Horde)]] before heading out.

Kill [[fungal giant]]s between Grulkor's position and the Drained Fungal Heart island to the south, hopefully gathering five hearts before reaching the island.

West of Grulkor's new position, find a rare elite fungal giant [[Fungal Praetorian]]. It drops a [[Precious Mushroom]], which starts [[Trophy of Glory: Fungal Praetorian (Horde)]].
