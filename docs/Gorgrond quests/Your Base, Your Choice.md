==Objectives==
Choose to construct either a Lumber Mill or a Sparring Arena at [[Beastwatch]].
*Building selected

==Description==
You have already constructed an [[Frostwall|impressive garrison]] in [[Frostfire Ridge|Frostfire]]. I believe I should defer this next choice to you.

One region of [[Gorgrond]] is rich in resources. A lumber mill could help us make the most of them.

Another region harbors hardened gladiators. A sparring arena would help persuade them to fight for our cause.

Either path will strengthen us as we seek to find and weaken the Iron Horde.

Which do you choose, Commander?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A fine choice. It will need more work before such a structure could be built in your garrison, but this is a start.

==Notes==
Interact with Durotan to construct the Lowlands Lumber Yard or Savage Fight Club:
;Lowlands Lumber Yard:
:The Lowlands Lumber Yard will provide daily materials and reduce the cost of other garrison buildings and specializations.
:Once fully operational, the Lowlands Lumber Yard grants the use of [Summon Mechashredder 5000] within Gorgrond.
*{{Abilities|Summon Mechashredder 5000|icon=inv_misc_sawblade_01|Summon the Mechashredder 5000.|notes=Instant|cd=10 min|id=164050}}
;Savage Fight Club
:The Savage Fight Club will provide training missions to improve existing followers.
:Once fully operational, the Savage Fight Club grants the use of [Champion's Honor] within Gorgrond.
*{{Abilities|Champion's Honor|icon=spell_holy_championsbond|Summons an Arena Champion to fight by your side for 1 min.<br>When the champion departs, you will gain an enhancement improving your combat skills while in Gorgrond. The more enemies you kill while the champion is present, the stronger this enhancement will be.}}
Whichever option is selected, players gain an innkeeper and a flight path at Beastwatch and have access to [[Skulltakers in Crimson Fen]].

This completes the "Your Base, Your Choice" chapter of [[Putting the Gore in Gorgrond]]. The [[Gorgrond storyline]] continues with [[The Razorbloom (Horde)]] and [[Tangleheart (Horde)]] for the Lowlands Lumber Yard option, or [[Rage and Wisdom (Horde)]] and [[A Rediscovered Legend (Horde)]] for the Savage Fight Club option.
