[[File:Rescue Rangari - Rangari Rajess.jpg|thumb|Rangari Rajess]]
[[File:Rescue Rangari - Rangari Jonaa.jpg|thumb|Rangari Jonaa]]
Find Rangari Rajess, Rangari Kolaan, and Rangari Jonaa.
*Find [[Rangari Kolaan]] {{co|59.5|53.2|Gorgrond}}
*Find [[Rangari Rajess]] {{co|57.7|54.3|Gorgrond}}
*Find [[Rangari Jonaa]] {{co|55.1|58.6|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
Many of our {{Au|rangari}} have not been accounted for. It would seem the followers of [[Iyu]] have taken captives.

We will continue to search the area for survivors.

In the meantime, follow the [[Wildwood Wash]] west toward [[Highpass]] and look for any signs of our rangari comrades.

Our people are stout and capable survivors. You may find more than you expect. Have them stay near the road and we will follow as soon as this... dwarf creature... has fixed his mechanical vessel.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 523 gloves|Steamburst Handwraps|Overgrowth Cutter Gauntlets|Wildwood Wrangler Gloves|Foundry-Fired Plate Handguards}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is no small thing for us to welcome so many strangers into our camps.  [[Gorgrond]] is not the sort of place that breeds trust easily.

==Completion==
The rangari are stout survivalists. I knew they would not go down without a fight.

Thank you, <name>, for your help in this. You have done us a great honor.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Lost Mole Machines]] before heading out. Additionally, [[Iyun Weald (bonus objective)]] pops up in the area.

Along the road, just before reaching the bridge, find [[Rangari Kolaan]].
:Those foul creatures poison their spears. I keep an antidote but it will take time for my head to celar enough for me to move.
{{gossip|''D'kaan is coming with help.''}}
:{{text|say|Rangari Kolaan|Do not worry about me, my friend. I will await D'kaan's arrival. Please, find the others.}}

Cross the bridge to find Rangari Rajess just on the other side:
:One thing we learned early from the Laughing Skull: podlings hate fire.
{{gossip|''D'kaan is coming with help.''}}
:{{text|say|Rangari Rajess|Go without me, stranger.  I will only slow you down.  I shall hold my own until D'kaan arrives.}}

Take a left heading south and find at {{co|57.8|56.0|Gorgrond}} the [[Remains of Balldir Deeprock]] on the bottom of the small pool of water, who apparently did not survive the Gorgrond Water Snakes.

Keep following the path southwest to find [[Rangari Jonaa]]:
:We fought as well as we could. But in the end, too many of my friends were lost.
{{gossip|''D'kaan is coming with help.''}}
:{{text|say|Rangari Jonaa|I will not leave the fallen to the children of the genesaur. I will protect their bodies until D'kaan arrives.}}

Take the right fork to come across [[Glirin]] standing outside a mole machine:
:{{text|say|Glirin|Over here!}}
:A <class>? Oh are you a sight for sore eyes.
:We dinna' expect to hit anything when digging through the ground like we were.
''{{gossip|Thaelin is on his way soon.}}''

When you click on Glirin to talk to him, Darkanvil's tank races up the path and you hear the roar of the engine as it gets near. With a car horn and a dwarvish whoop the tank rams its way through the pile of boulders that Glirin's mole machine upturned, which were blocking the way.  Running up the road to the top of the hill, you find it parked behind the mole machine with the everyone disembarked.
