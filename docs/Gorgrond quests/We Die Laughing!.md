==Objectives==
Collect 5 Laughing Skull Masks.
*[[Laughing Skull Mask]] (5)

==Description==
Are you here to help or hinder?

This village is being eaten, and we must move quickly to salvage what we can.

Gather the masks of our fallen Laughing Skull brothers and sisters and meet me on the western side of the village.

I will need them if our clan is to rebuild.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 522 shoulders|Overgrowth Cutter Spaulders|Foundry-Fired Plate Shoulders|Steamburst Mantle|Wildwood Wrangler Monnion}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We are the Laughing Skull! We do not flinch in the face of death. We laugh at it.

==Completion==
These are more than fancy facewear. With a mask and some proper incentive, we can make anyone a Laughing Skull.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Goren, Goren, Gone!]] and [[Eye Candy]] before heading out.

Upon accept, Kaz runs out of her hut and despawns.

The masks can be looted from [[Dead Laughing Skull]]s, which are found all over Deadgrin. They can be looted while mounted and/or moving.

After completing the objective, head southeast to find Kaz, [[Limbflayer]], [[Marrow]], {{Au|Durotan}}, {{Au|Draka}}, [[Nightstalker (alternate universe)|Nightstalker]] and [[Whitefang]] outside the village's eastern exit.

:{{text|say|Durotan|I have come to hunt the [[Iron Horde]]. I could destroy what remains of your ruined village, or perhaps we could assist one another.}}
