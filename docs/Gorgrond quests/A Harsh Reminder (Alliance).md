==Objectives==
Kill 8 denizens of the wasteland in [[Affliction Ridge]].
*Denizens of the Wasteland slain (8)

==Description==
Welcome to the front lines, commander, where the wastelands and the jungle collide.

The battle below rages on, but I believe one side is beginning to overwhelm the other. This cannot be allowed to happen.

The [[gronnling]]s are gaining an upper hand and must be stopped before they pose a threat to [[Highpass]].

I will get closer to the battle while you thin their ranks. Meet me within Affliction Ridge when you are done.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 525 belts|Foundry-Fired Plate Girdle|Steamburst Cord|Wildwood Wrangler Belt|Overgrowth Cutter Belt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These creatures are fierce in battle.

==Completion==
You have a true talent for combat.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Seedbearers of Bad News (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Kill [[Goren Gouger]]s, [[Gronnling Bonebreaker]]s and [[Gronn Rockthrower]]s while burning dead [[Draenor ancient]]s. Once done with both, find Erdanii stealthed on a rock in the middle of the quest area.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Sparring Arena}}
