==Objectives==
Collect Waters of Utrophis.
*[[Waters of Utrophis]] {{co|40.6|81.8|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
It sounds like these... "dwarves"... you found managed to steal a powerful botani artifact.

But the fools didn't know they need a special water to power it.

To the north is a well along the [[Evermorn Rise]].

There you will find a guardian, a creature of water we have named [[Utrophis]].

Slay it and take its essence and you will be one step closer to claiming the power of the botani and their genesaur.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 534 necks|Botani Tangle Chain|Utrophis-Soaked Spiritstone|Waterworn Ogre Carving|Smoothed Spiritstone|Botani Thorn Necklace}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
For years the Laughing Skull would not touch the sacred waters. We feared the wrath of the botani. We should have set them to burn long ago.

==Completion==
The Waters of Utrophis. I have never held or smelled or tasted it before. But I have heard many stories, many legends.

I was expecting something more grand.

==Notes==
East southeast of the main area where the Dew Masters were, find [[Utrophis]] in a little alcove.

Before leaving the area, head uphill to the northeast to find rare botani [[Bashiok (NPC)|Bashiok]]. Also, make sure to finish killing [[Bloom Weaver]]s and gathering [[Potent Pollen]] for the other quests before returning to camp.
