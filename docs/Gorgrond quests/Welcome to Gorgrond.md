==Objectives==
Follow the [[Wildwood Wash]] to [[Naielle's Watch]].
*Scout ahead for Naielle's Watch {{co|63.5|52.7|Gorgrond}}
*Find survivors {{co|64.2|51.6|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
[[Gorgrond]] is one of the most untamed landscapes in all of {{Au|Draenor}}.

Only our most skilled of {{Au|rangari}} venture this deep into the wilds.

It is their camp we are heading for. If you wish to travel ahead, it can be found down this path and to the right.

Maraad and I shall follow after you momentarily. We still have some logistics to work out before we leave the landing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I am a fan of the temple gardens but this place is just too far gone for my tastes.

==Completion==
You have chosen a very unfortunate time to visit our camp, my friend.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Yrel|We should have brought an army to fight the Iron Horde!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Gorgrond is no place for armies. This land swallows all who enter. We will be fortunate to even lay eyes upon the Iron Horde base.}}

Run down the path to the north. A [[genesaur]] appears a few hundred yards ahead and spawns a huge number of weeds on the path and a steam tank comes flying over the road and slams down into the ditch on the other side. Where the genesaur was, off to the right, is [[Naielle's Watch]], but it has been overrun by [[podling]]s! On the south side of camp in a small cave, find [[Rangari Kaalya]] and [[Rangari D'kaan]]. Get close:
:{{text|say|Rangari D'kaan|What do we have here? A hero? Gorgrond is no place for heroes, my friend.}}
