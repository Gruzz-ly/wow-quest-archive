Rescue {{au|Nazgrel}}.
*Rescue Nazgrel {{co|36.8|70.6|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
Escaping Stonemaul was the easy part. The ogre filth that rule the pits still have my son.

For a while they used him as leverage to ensure I would fight in their arenas. But now that I have escaped they will try to train him to replace me.

Please, rescue my son. If they see me they will kill him instantly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found my son?

==Completion==
This deed will never be forgotten as long as I or my son live. You have my gratitude, hero, and my loyalty.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Getting Gladiators]], [[Slave Hunters]], and [[Krav'ogra]] before heading out.

Immediately southwest is an [[Odd Boulder]]. This one contains the [[Obsidian Crystal Formation]]. Head inside and find [[Prowler Sasha]] standing in front of a pile of dead ogres. He offers [[Need More Teeth]].

Head up the tower that Sasha is standing in front of to reach [[Slave Hunter Krag]]. Kill him, loot the [[Pendant of Krag]], then head north across the way and enter the tower to find Bruto shackled to the back wall.
:{{text|yell|Bruto|Now I can kill who I want, when I want!  Meet me in the [[ogre mound]] when you are done and we will rip faces together!}}
Head south into the pit to find [[Slave Hunter Brol]] and loot his pendant. Enter the arena and bang the Challenge Gong.
:{{text|yell|Slavemaster Ok'mok|What is this? A new challenger? We will enjoy watching you be consumed by my little pet.}}
A goren, [[Kigli'ak]], comes out. Kill it.
:{{text|yell|Slavemaster Ok'mok|A meager victory. Let us see how you fare against my personal ogron.}}
An ogron, [[Stribit]], comes out. Kill it.
:{{text|yell|Slavemaster Ok'mok|Such impudence. I will see you consumed by my favorite pet.}}
A ravager, [[Jabberback]], comes out. Kill it.
:{{text|yell|Slavemaster Ok'mok|That was my favorite ravager. You filthy savage. I will kill you with my own bare hands!}}
Ok'mok jumps into the arena. Kill him.

Behind the arena where the combatants emerged is [[Y'kish]] locked in a cage.
:{{text|say|Y'kish|Free at last! Join me in the ogre mound when you are done, and we shall slay the ogre chieftain together.}}
Enter the tower to the north to free [[Pitfighter Vaandaam]].
:{{text|say|Pitfighter Vaandaam|My fists and gratitude are yours, stranger. How do you feel about killing an ogre chief before you go?}}
Exit and get on top of the same tower and head south to enter the tower to find [[Slave Hunter Mol]]. Before turning in, head north and take the switchback back to the southwest to find [[Stomper Kreego]], who drops the [[Ogre Brewing Kit]], a few cases of beer, and some [[Garrison Resources]].

Finally head back downhill and enter [[Kor'gall's Hovel]] (where the question mark is on the minimap) and take the south fork to loop around and free {{au|Nazgrel}} from his cage:
:{{text|say|Nazgrel|You better fear the day I get let out of this cage!}}
:{{text|say|Nazgrel|Did my father send you? I told them he would find a way to spring me! Thanks, stranger.}}
Don't leave the hovel just yet -- head to the north end to find the three freed gladiators.
