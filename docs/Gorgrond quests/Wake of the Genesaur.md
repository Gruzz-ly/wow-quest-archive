==Objectives==
[[File:Podling Scavenger.jpg|thumb|[[Podling Scavenger]].]]
Slay 9 Wild Growth.
*Wild Overgrowth (9)

==Description==
One moment we see a great metal beast rolling into our camp, the next a [[genesaur]] follows it and sends a wave of pure chaotic life at us.

The manifestations left behind by the genesaur must be culled so we have time to salvage what we can before leaving.

If you are here to help, then start killing as many of the violent plants that are assailing us as possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 522 shoulders|Overgrowth Cutter Spaulders|Foundry-Fired Plate Shoulders|Steamburst Mantle|Wildwood Wrangler Monnion}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This has not been a good day.

==Completion==
A good start. The growth from a genesaur is pure chaos and must be culled whenever possible.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Harvester Has Come]] before heading out.

Kill a path to the northeast and note a tentacle of [[Aggressive Growth]] flinging [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] about. Kill the growth and pick up [[I Drew Aggro...culture]] from him. Head west-northwest and enter the [[Rangari Hollow]] to find [[Harvester Ommru]] with a few [[Podling Scavenger]]s. Finish him off, then head back to where the genesaur attacked the siege tank on the road to turn in.

: ''[[Maraad]] and [[Yrel]] have come across [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] busy with the siege tank, along with Kaalya and D'kaan.  Yrel is surprised to see the dwarf.''
