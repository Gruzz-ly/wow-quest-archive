==Objectives==
Kill 6 Fungus Covered Shamblers.
*[[Fungus Covered Shambler]] slain (6)

==Description==
You can see that the dead were the lucky ones. Those that live wander about attacking anything not infected with these vile spores.

I cannot bring myself to slay them, but if you could bring mercy to those poor people I would be very grateful.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 530 gloves|Overgrowth Cutter Gloves|Foundry-Fired Plate Gauntlets|Steamburst Gloves|Wildwood Wrangler Gauntlets}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Truly a grim task, bringing mercy to the infected...

==Completion==
Perhaps we shouldn't have wasted time on them, this place... drains me. Still it was a good dead you have done.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Secret of the Fungus (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Plenty of fungus-covered shamblers (both orc and draenei) and orange-capped mushrooms in the area.
