== Objectives ==
Meet [[Durotan (alternate universe)|Durotan]] in [[Gorgrond]].

== Description ==
;Post-Battle of Thunder Pass:
:Commander, I will leave my forces to secure this pass, but I will not sit idle while our enemy prepares for another attack.
:I want to take the fight to the heart of the Iron Horde at Blackrock, and to do that we are going to need to go where few orcs dare tread.
:Gorgrond.
:It is a savage place, filled with giants and monsters of every sort.
:Will you dare these wilds with me so that we might strike at the [[Foundry|foundries]] of the Iron Horde? 
;Backup
:
:Commander, Durotan calls for aid in leading a small strike team into Gorgrond to launch a counter attack against the Iron Horde strongholds there.
:The land is home to the Blackrock clan, industrial arm of the Iron Horde.
:It is also home to some of the most savage giants and monsters in all of Draenor.
:If you wish to answer this call to action, Gorgrond can be reached through the eastern side of Frostfire Ridge through Thunder Pass.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|83}}

== Completion ==
Gorgrond is no place for armies, Commander. We are now stepping into the domain of legends.

== Gains ==
* 1400 XP

== Notes ==
Head past [[Agurak's Fall]] and into [[Gorgrond Pass]]. Durotan and [[Draka (alternate universe)|Draka]], along with [[Nightstalker (alternate universe)|Nightstalker]] and [[Whitefang]], are standing in front of a large stone pillar. Two Iron Horde soldiers with grins on their faces have been strung up on the rock with axes. A sign on the ground in front of them reads "We got them to laugh... eventually."
