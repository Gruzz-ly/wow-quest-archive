==Objectives==
Collect 5 Glowing Mushrooms.
*[[Glowing Mushroom]] (5)

==Description==
It smells here and there are whispers.

I feel there is a connection between the plants and beasts here. Special mushrooms seem to focus the beasts' attention.

Go and get some of these for me. I... need... them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where are my mushrooms?!

==Completion==
Yes, they smell... wonderful. These will help me find the power of this marsh and take it for my own.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Clearing the Way (Gorgrond)]] before heading out.

Plenty of fungus-covered shamblers (both orc and draenei) and orange-capped mushrooms in the area.

==Progression==
{{Crimson Fen}}
