==Description==
It is done.

With this enchantment, not only can you roam amongst the [[goren]] freely, but you can move as they do.

Your travels through Gorgrond are now made simple. You have safe access to places otherwise impossible to reach.

Xuk's ancestors have made it so.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What has that orc done to you?!

==Completion==
It is good that you still have your wits about you. You do... have your wits about you?

==Notes==
Use the quest item then head east to some cracked ground as the tunnel passes through northwest to Drywind Gorge. There, three [[Boneyard Gorger]]s are consuming a [[Bluff Rylak]]:
:{{text|emote|The goren mumbles something incomprehensible to you.}}
When in Rome, do as the Romans do and consume the rylak.
Immediately to the north, find a [[Suntouched Spear]]. Loot it for...

Get back up on top and click the tunnel beneath the rylak to head north through the [[Valley of Destruction]] to reach a level 102 elite magnaron, [[Drov the Ruiner]]. Quickly hop back in the tunnel, which comes out at [[Brak's Excavation]]. There, a dead [[Grom'kar Messenger]] lies on the ground. Check the corpse for a [[Grom'kar Dispatch]].

Before leaving the cave, check the east wall to find an [[Iron Supply Chest]], which contains 25 [[Garrison Resources]], then roll to the southwest past the Grom'kar Messenger a few yards to take the tunnel back.
