==Objectives==
Collect 9 Basilisk Meat from [[Stoneshamble Basilisk]]s or [[Decaying Basilisk]]s.
*[[Basilisk Meat]] (9)

==Description==
Basilisk is one of Nisha's favorite meals. This is where she hunts, and that's likely how those Iron Horde bastards were able to capture her.

Why would they go to the trouble to subdue her this way? Perhaps together, you and I might learn the answer as we punish them for their transgressions.

For now, Nisha's going to need some food. While I tend to her, will you do her hunting for her?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Nisha sniffs deeply.>

==Completion==
<Nisha downs the meat in one gulp.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[On the Mend]] before heading out. After picking up both quests, Rexxar carries Misha on his back and stalks off to the north.

This is a good time to sneak off to the southwest to do [[A Rediscovered Legend]].

Kill water furies and basilisks, then head north to reach [[Breaker's Crown]].

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Sparring Arena}}
