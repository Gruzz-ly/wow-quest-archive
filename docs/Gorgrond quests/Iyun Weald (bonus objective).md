This bonus objective pops up while in [[Iyun Weald]] for [[Rescue Rangari]] and [[Lost Mole Machines]]. Kill neutral wasps and the larger podlings, and click on the smaller podlings to punt them! Watch out for [[Biolante]]! After the Lumber Mill or Sparring Arena is built at [[Highpass]] in [[We Need An Outpost]] or [[Beastwatch]] in [[Establish a Foothold]], come back and kill Biolante again to loot the [[Writhing Green Tendril]], which starts [[Trophy of Glory: Biolante]].

Players who chose the Lumber Mill can open some [[Hardened Thornvine]] at {{co|63.3|57.2|Gorgrond}} just southeast of the quest area. This back of thornvine contains a [[Mysterious Petrified Pod]]. On the other hand, players who chose the Sparring Arena can open an [[Odd Boulder]] at {{co|61.5|58.5|Gorgrond}} just to the southwest. This boulder hides an [[Ancient Ogre Cache]].
