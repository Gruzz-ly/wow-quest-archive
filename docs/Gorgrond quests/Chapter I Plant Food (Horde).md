==Objectives==
[[File:Pollen Pod.jpg|thumb|The Pollen Pod.]]
Destroy 8 Pollen Pods.
*Pollen Pod destroyed (8)

==Description==
There are strange, glowing objects within Tangleheart, seemingly pollinated by a variety of stinging creature.

The [[botani]] sometimes collect whatever the pods produce. I can't be sure what it is, but it might be dangerous to us.

- Frenna

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|30}}
*13970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hey, nice job, commander!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Chapter II: The Harvest (Horde)]] and [[Chapter III: Ritual of the Charred (Horde)]] before heading out.

In the greater Tangleheart area, focus on killing [[Draenor ancient]]s until the requisite four are dead, then shift over to [[botani]] to get the last of the [[Ancient Growth Sap]]. [[Ontogen the Harvester]] is in the western lake, and Pollen Pods are all over the area.
