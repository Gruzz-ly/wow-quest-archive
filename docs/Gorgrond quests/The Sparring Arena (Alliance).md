==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rangari Jonaa]] at [[Highpass]] in [[Gorgrond]].

==Description==
We owe you our freedom, and more. I have spoken to the others, we are willing to return with you to your garrison and teach those pitiful creatures you call "soldiers" how to properly fight.

We will also do our best to impart our knowledge to you, Commander. Should you have need of us when in the wilds of Gorgrond, simply call us.

You may wish to warn Rangari Jonaa of our coming.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*13830 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Now that we have the trainers, we can start training your forces to do something other than chop lumber. Heh. Heh.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Fists of Vaandaam]] before heading back. Don't forget about [[On the Mend]] and [[Basilisk Butcher]] either!

This completes the "Supporting Your Garrison" chapter of [[Putting the Gore in Gorgrond]]. Keep going with the "In the Land of Giants" chapter of the [[Gorgrond storyline]] with On the Mend and Basilisk Butcher.
