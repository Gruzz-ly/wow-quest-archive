==Objectives==
Recover the Will of the Genesaur.
*[[Will of the Genesaur]] {{co|58.7|23.0|Moira's Bastion|1}}

==Description==
When the [[goren]] attacked we threw everything we had at them but they just kept comin'.

So some of the lads went and stole a fancy artifact from the [[botani]].

Problem was we couldn't get it to work. Now the artifact is sitting at the bottom of the bastion. To get to it you got to go all the way to the back of the tunnels pass all them goren and find the wee tunnel that takes you further underground.

If you retrieve it, it is yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*23900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Not fond of this place. If the plants ain't tryin' to kill you then the ground is tryin' to swallow ya up.

==Completion==
That artifact was useful until it ran out of juce. Hopefully you got some seeds and water for it.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Down the Goren Hole (Alliance)]] and [[Just In Case]] before heading out.

Kill anything that moves. Doomshot is rather large-caliber rounds strewn all over the ground. Head to the back (southward) and to the lower level. Loot the Will of the Genesaur and Hansel will run downstairs:
