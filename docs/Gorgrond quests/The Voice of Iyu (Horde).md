{{questportrait|Voice of Iyu.jpg|Voice of Iyu|He speaks for the genesaur.}}
Slay the Voice of Iyu.
*[[Voice of Iyu]] slain {{co|49.4|71.7|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
The botani and their wretched minions take and take and take.

They want food, they take our land. They want an army, they take our people.

It is important to strike fear into the shrubby hearts of these plant people.

Look for their leader, the Voice of Iyu. It is a [[botani]] who speaks on behalf of their [[genesaur]] master.

Kill their precious leader in the safety of his precious bloom.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It isn't enough to kill the botani. They will always have greater numbers.

You must cut them deep and hard, where it hurts them the most.

Like slaying their most sacred leader.

==Notes==
Follow the path to the northeast to find the [[Voice of Iyu]] inside a hollowed-out tree. Knock him out, then head just to the north of the tree to find a basket of [[Enriched Seeds]], which starts [[Super Seeds (Horde)]].
