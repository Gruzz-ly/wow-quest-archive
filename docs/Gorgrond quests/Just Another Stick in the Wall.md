==Objectives==
Use Penny's Plunger to blow up the Rock Wall.
*Use Penny's Plunger

==Description==
So, get this.

As I was flyin' in, I took the opportunity to scope out what might be a defensible position.

Just on the other side o' these boulders is an ideal clearing to hole up in. I even brought a set of blueprints to get us all settled in! 

That's not too presumptuous, is it?

Anyway, whenever you're ready just hit this plunger!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Perhaps this little creature will earn her keep after all.

==Notes==
After blowing up the rock wall, [[Kaz the Shrieker]], [[Limbflayer]], [[Marrow]], [[Durotan (alternate universe)|Durotan]], {{Au|Draka}}, {{Au|Nightstalker}}, [[Ricket]] and [[Whitefang]] come running towards [[Beastwatch]], where, with the exception of Durotan, they briefly stop before despawning.
