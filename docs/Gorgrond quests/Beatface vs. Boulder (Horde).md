== Objectives ==
Break the boulder barrier using [[Beatface]] the gladiator.
*Saberon camp breached

== Description ==
After the [[saberon]] stole from these plants, they were forced further up [[Steamscar Rise]] and barricaded themselves in. I could not find a way to get in but you have the solution.

One path is blocked by a boulder, but it looks weak. A strong warrior, such as an ogre, could break it.

I think you know an ogre gladiator...

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
* 14100 XP

==Completion==
Good work, but we need to move quickly before the plants realize the way is open...

== Notes ==
Exit the cave and, turn south and head uphill to the marked spot on the minimap. Near the southwestern end of the ridge, find an [[Odd Boulder]]. This one contains an [[Ancient Titan Chest]]. Head southeast from the Odd Boulder to get to the Large Boulder, and interact with it to get Beatface to break it as ... stealths on by:
