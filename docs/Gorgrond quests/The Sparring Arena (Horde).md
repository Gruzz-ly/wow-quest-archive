==Objectives==
Speak with [[Limbflayer]] at [[Beastwatch]] in [[Gorgrond]].

==Description==
We owe you our freedom, and more. I have spoken to the others, we are willing to return with you to your garrison and teach those pitiful creatures you call "soldiers" how to properly fight.

We will also do our best to impart our knowledge to you, Commander. Should you have need of us when in the wilds of Gorgrond, simply call us.

You may wish to warn Limbflayer of our coming.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Kash'drakor is coming here?! Ha! I once saw him cut through a dozen Laughing Skulls because they had his son.

He is the purist expression of destruction.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Interest of Bruto]] before heading back. Don't forget about [[On the Mend]] and [[Basilisk Butcher]] either!

This completes the "Supporting Your Garrison" chapter of [[Putting the Gore in Gorgrond]]. Keep going with the "In the Land of Giants" chapter of the Gorgrond storyline with On the Mend and Basilisk Butcher.
