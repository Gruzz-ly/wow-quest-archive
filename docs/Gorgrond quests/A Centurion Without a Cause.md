==Completion==
This jungle will kill me and I will not return to cower at the mercy of [[Imperator Mar'gok (alternate universe)|Mar'gok]]!

I am a veteran of several wars and campaigned on two continents now. If you have a war worth joining, I will serve for a time.

At least until I can kill the Sorcerer-King!

==Rewards==
You will gain: Follower: [[Tormmok the High Centurion]]

==Notes==
;Upon encountering Tormmok, he says the following lines as he keeps fighting
:{{text|yell|High Centurion Tormmok|I will NOT die in this accursed jungle! I will not become plant food! My death is meant for something far more glorious than you plants!}}
:{{text|yell|High Centurion Tormmok|Is that the best you can do?! I've put bigger forests to the torch in my campaigns!}}
:{{text|yell|High Centurion Tormmok|You just keep coming like the weeds you are! Fine then! I've killed a hundred of you, I can kill hundreds more!}}
:{{text|yell|High Centurion Tormmok|I yet live you green beasts! Come face Tormmok if you dare!}}
;As Woodfist runs up the rise towards Tormmok
:{{text|yell|Woodfist|Your corpse will grow countless of us!}}
;After Woodfist is defeated
:{{text|say|Woodfist|There will always be more of us... here...}}
:{{text|say|High Centurion Tormmok|I hate this jungle... You there! I would speak with you.}}

;Upon speaking with Tormmok
:You are the first thing that has not immediately attacked me since my expedition arrived in this forsaken lan... I should not even be here!
*{{gossip|No one should become fertilizer for these monsters. How did you come to be here?}}
:Ever since "Sorceror King" Mar'gok came to power and found those artifacts its been Felbreaker this and Firebreaker that. With his newfound power he thinks he doesn't need the Legion!

:This empire was forged with ogre strength and ogre blades and I told him as such!

*{{gossip|I doubt he took that well...}}
:He did not. He turned my words against me!

:He ordered me and my lpyal supporters to go on this cursed expedition to find the first ogre civilization and find some stupid relics!  I could not disobey... now my troops are all dead and I cannot return...
