==Notes==
[[Tailthrasher Stalker]]s, [[Tailthrasher Ambusher]]s and [[Tailthrasher Vinebender]]s all count. Rope Spikes are used to restrain the Jungle Axebeaks. Also look for [[Sunclaw]] on top of a pillar. There are two sets of Climbing Ropes that can be used to reach the rare elite, the lower on the northwest side, and the higher on the southwest side.

On the west side of the area, find [[Ockbar the Wanderer]] being "threatened" by an [[Intimidating Baby Adder]]. Slay the adder and Ockbar will run off, so loot the forgotten [[Ockbar's Pack]]. Additionally, just outside of Bastion Rise is another [[Hardened Thornvine]]. This one contains the [[Remains of Explorer Engineer Toldirk Ashlamp]] for players who chose the Lumber Mill.
