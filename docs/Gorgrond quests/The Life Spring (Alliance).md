==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Utrophis.jpg|Utrophis|Manifestation of living water.}}
Collect Waters of Utrophis.
*[[Waters of Utrophis]] {{co|40.6|81.8|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
So we came here cause we needed a weapon we saw the [[botani]] using.

[[Hansel Heavyhands|Hansel]] grabbed the artifact an' [[Scorchbrow]] an' I were supposed to grab the special water the thing runs on.

We didn't know that water so full of life forms an [[elemental]].

If ya mosey up to the cauldron at the base of that fancy lookin' ancient artifact in [[Evermorn Springs]], you'll be findin' this beast. If ya can kill it and get its water, we can use it when we get the rest of the artifact. 

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 534 necks|Botani Tangle Chain|Utrophis-Soaked Spiritstone|Waterworn Ogre Carving|Smoothed Spiritstone|Botani Thorn Necklace}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Now I see why some become Rangari. This is exciting.

==Completion==
You are carrying something of great power on you. I could feel it as you approached.

==Notes==
East southeast of the main area where the Dew Masters were, find [[Utrophis]] in a little alcove.

Before leaving the area, head uphill to the northeast to find rare botani [[Bashiok (NPC)|Bashiok]]. Also, make sure to finish killing [[Bloom Weaver]]s and gathering [[Potent Pollen]] for the other quests before returning to camp.
