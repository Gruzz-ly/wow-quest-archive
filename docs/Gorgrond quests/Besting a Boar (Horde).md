==Objectives==
Use the Boar Lasso on a Young Rocktusk and follow it until it is tamed.
*[[Young Rocktusk|Rocktusk]] Tamed
*[[Boar Lasso]] (provided)

==Description==
The great boars of Gorgrond appear to serve as both a mount and an excellent source of food. Having a few of them in the garrison would not be an unwise idea.

I have created for you another rope, should you wish to ride one down. Be wary of the Iron Horde presence nearby..

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Completion==
The boar has taken to the stables quite quickly. They appear to be nearly domesticated already. It will need some time to rest.

==Patch changes==
