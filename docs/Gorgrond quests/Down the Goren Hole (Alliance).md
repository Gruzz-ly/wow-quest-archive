==Objectives==
Slay 5 goren in [[Moira's Reach]].
*Goren Breachers slain (5)

==Description==
These beasts came at us so fast we didn't have time to mount a proper defense. They went right for the metal and chewed through any wall we had.

If we don't kill some of them soon they'll bring the whole fortress down on us.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 536 weapons|Abandoned Dark Iron Handaxe|Abandoned Dark Iron Skullthumper|Abandoned Dark Iron Cudgel|Abandoned Dark Iron Greataxe|Abandoned Dark Iron Longbow|Abandoned Dark Iron Lockjammer|Abandoned Dark Iron Glaive|Abandoned Dark Iron Staff}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
All in a day's work, eh Commander?

==Completion==
You give me blackrock orcs, troggs, er evil leper gnomes an' we'd be fine. But these acid munchin' beasts are the end of us.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Will of the Genesaur (Alliance)]] and [[Just In Case]] before heading out.

Kill anything that moves. Doomshot is rather large-caliber rounds strewn all over the ground. Head to the back (southward) and to the lower level. Loot the Will of the Genesaur and Hansel will run downstairs:
