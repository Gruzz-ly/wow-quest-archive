==Objectives==
Defeat Cymre Brightblade in a pet battle.
*Defeat [[Cymre Brightblade]]

==Description==
I found some interesting artifacts on a recent dig, and I'd love to put them through their paces to see how they would have performed in their native cultures. Don't suppose you have anything small and furry that can put up a fight?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you want to pet battle or just talk...

==Completion==
Thanks for helping me test out these artifacts.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
