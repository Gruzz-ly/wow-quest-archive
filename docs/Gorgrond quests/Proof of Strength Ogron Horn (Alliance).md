==Objectives==
Take the proof to [[Rangari Jonaa]] at [[Highpass]] in [[Gorgrond]].
* [[Worn Ogron Horn]]

==Description==
This horn is proof of your strength at slaying [[ogron]] and your gladiator friend has born witness!

Take the horn back to Jonaa and claim your accolades!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|18|90|}}

==Completion==
It is hard to admit that there is a creature more brutal than an [[ogre]], but the ogron definitely fit that description. Facing a captured ogron in the arena is no mean feat. Facing one in their own lair is something even more dangerous. Hail to thee champion!
