==Objectives==
Recover 100 Quenching Waters from Steamfury elementals.
*[[Quenching Waters]] x100

==Description==
Nisha will heal.

This ordeal has taken a toll on her. She needs water and rest.

I will bring her to my camp and make her comfortable.

Will you meet us there with some fresh water?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Steamfury Signet
|Steamfury Seal
|Steamfury Loop
|Steamfury Band
|Steamfury Ring
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|10|}}
* 600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Nisha raises her head.>

==Completion==
<Nisha laps up the water.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Basilisk Butcher]] before heading out. After picking up both quests, Rexxar carries Misha on his back and stalks off to the north.

This is a good time to sneak off to the southwest to do [[A Rediscovered Legend]].

Kill water furies and basilisks, then head north to reach [[Breaker's Crown]].

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Sparring Arena}}
