==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Iron Horde]] camp in [[Sulfur Basin]].
*Iron Horde camp investigated {{co|44.2|61.6|Gorgrond}}
*[[Goren Ambusher]] slain (3)

==Description==
Commander, I've spotted Iron Horde soldiers nearby.

It is bold, even for them, to venture into such deadly territory.

If we do not deal with their presence, they will surely be a threat to your camp.

While I scout deeper into the canyons, may I request your help in investigating the camp?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, friend. I am in your debt.

This arrogant Iron Horde has made a dangerous enemy today.

==Notes==
Head just to the north-northwest. A [[Dying Beast]] is on the ground in the middle of a ruined camp. Interact with it:
:<The creature is still alive, but is completely incapacitated by the iron Horde's chains.>
:{{gossip|Release the creature from its chains.}}
Three [[Goren Ambusher]]s pop out of the ground next to the dread raven. Defeat them and a [[Gronn Treeslammer]] will land a boulder on the adventurer, stunning it, as the gronn picks up the player and starts walking away. Suddenly, [[Rexxar]] jumps out of the shadows, charges after the gronn, and takes it down with a mighty blow!
:{{text|yell|Rexxar|Back to the dust with you!}}
Freed from the gronn's grip, run over to Rexxar and turn in. It turns out the Dying Beast is [[Nisha (dread raven)|Nisha]], Rexxar's mount!
