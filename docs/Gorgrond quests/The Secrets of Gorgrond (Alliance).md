==Objectives==
;Shadowmoon Valley
Seek [[Yrel]] at the [[Wildwood Wash]] in [[Gorgrond]]. Speak with your [[Dungar Longdrink|Garrison Gryphon Master]] to fly there.

;Gorgrond
Seek Yrel at the Wildwood Wash in Gorgrond. Speak with your Garrison Gryphon Master or [[Rangari Yaval|the Flight Master]] at [[Bastion Rise]] to fly there.

==Description==
;Yrel, The Defense of Karabor 
:Our victory today was costly. Too costly. There is no guarantee that we can turn another attack.

: We need to know what the [[Iron Horde]] is up to, and there is only one place we can go to find out.

: Gorgrond.

: It is a savage land that few ever return from.

: I mean to go there, I mean to find their stronghold at [[Blackrock Foundry|Blackrock]], and I mean to learn how we can defeat these vile orcs.

: Will you join me, Commander?

;Bodrick Grey, Garrison
:Commander, Yrel and [[Vindicator Maraad|Maraad]] have a tactical suggestion.

:They recommend a small expedition group be sent into the savage wastelands of Gorgrond far to the north.

:Reports from their {{Au|rangari}} suggest that land may hold ancient secrets or primal knowledge that we might use to exploit weaknesses in the Iron Horde that our enemy would not expect.

: If you wish to go I will have a [[gryphon]] prepared for you at once.

;Rangari Kolaan, entering Gorgrond from [[Talador]] through the [[Iron Pass]] {{co|42.06|94.02|Gorgrond}}
: Commander, I was dispatched to intercept you.

: Yrel and Maraad have landed at Wildwood Wash, the rangari base of operations for the area.

: Your presence is requested immediately. 

: We keep a small feywing presence just east of here.  If you speak with the flight master they should be able to provide you safe passage to the Wash.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14,400 [[XP]]
*1,595 XP

==Progress==
Speak with [[Dungar Longdrink]] to pick up the flight path, then hop on a 2-3 minute ride to the [[Wildwood Wash]] in the southeast corner of [[Gorgrond]].

If for some reason you decide to buck the conventional and ride there overland from Talador past [[Bladefury's Command]], Rangari Kolaan can cover you. This will unlock [[Rangari Yaval]] to also give the flight path for the quest.  However, this version will give no where near as much XP as the mainline versions do.

==Completion==
Welcome to Gorgrond, Commander. We only just arrived ourselves.

==Notes==
*Once you turn in either Shadowmoon Valley quest, you can also pick up the Gorgrond version and turn it in for some extra XP and gold before continuing with the quest line.
