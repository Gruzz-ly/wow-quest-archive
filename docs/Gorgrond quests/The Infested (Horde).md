==Objectives==
Slay 6 Infested Orcs.
*Infested Orc slain (6)

==Description==
I understand Kaz's desire to rescue her people, but her plan is reckless and she is not telling us everything.

I came along to make sure she wasn't devising a plan against us and now I see this... this... horror.

What did the [[botani]] do to these orcs?

These infested souls need to be put to rest. Give them peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
These creatures... were not what I expected to see. I always knew Gorgrond to be a dangerous place, but I never could have guessed at how vile.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Mossy Fate]] before heading out.

Start killing [[Infested Orc]]s and [[Infested Behemoth]]s. The three named orcs are marked on the minimap on the edge of the central pond.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill}}
