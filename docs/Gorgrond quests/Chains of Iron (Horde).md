==Objectives==
Defeat Captain Brak and find the Heart of the Magnaron.
*[[Captain Brak]] slain {{co|49.2|44.9|Gorgrond}}
*[[Heart of the Magnaron]] {{co|49.7|43.8|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
The artifact we seek is within our grasp.

Be prepared for a fight. If they truly have learned how to control gronn, this may be more difficult than I anticipated.

I will join you in this battle as soon as you arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 543 chestpieces|Foundry-Fired Plate Chestplate|Wildwood Wrangler Vest|Overgrowth Cutter Vest|Steamburst Robe}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The artifact is yours, and is well earned.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. We can use this artifact against the Iron Horde when the time is right.

==Notes==
Roll east-northeast through the [[Valley of Destruction]] to reach [[Grom'kar Gulch]].
:{{text|yell|Captain Brak|Don't let them take the artifact!}}
:{{text|yell|Rexxar|The object we seek is here!}}
Let Rexxar handle most of the fight - he can take it:
:{{text|yell|Captain Brak|Gronnlings, break their bones and bring them back to me!}}
Three Dominated Gronnlings all attack at once. Once they're all dead, two Dominated Gronn jump into the arena!
:{{text|yell|Captain Brak|Gronn, gnash them in your teeth!}}
:{{text|yell|Rexxar|I've always enjoyed killing gronn.}}
Take them out.
:{{text|yell|Captain Brak|Impossible!}}
:{{text|yell|Rexxar|Nisha, get her down here!}}
:''Nisha flies up, grabs Brak in her talons, and unceremoniously drops her in the middle of the arena.}}
:{{text|yell|Captain Brak|Aggghh!}}
Finish her off.
:{{text|say|Rexxar|Well done. The artifact is yours to take.}}
Follow Rexxar to the north and interact with the [[Heart of the Magnaron]]. After picking it up, take Nisha back to camp:
:<Nisha playfully flicks out her tongue and licks your cheek.>
:{{gossip|Ride Nisha to your outpost.}}

This completes the "In the Land of Giants" chapter of [[Putting the Gore in Gorgrond]]. The [[Gorgrond storyline]] continues with [[Strike While the Iron is Hot]].
