==Objectives==
Find the Missing Mole Machine.
*Find the Lost Mole Machine {{co|54.0|60.1|Gorgrond}}
*Wait for [[Thaelin Darkanvil|Thaelin's]] Arrival {{co|53.4|60.3|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
Few people know the [[Blackrock clan]] better than [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron dwarves]].

So after [[Tanaan Jungle|Tanaan]], we sent a bunch of mole machines to [[Gorgrond]] to build a listenin' post to keep an eye on them.

Me own mole machine got way off course an' I got separated. It didn't take long to figure out all the other mole machines got off course as well.

Accordin' to the readin's in me tank, a mole machine surfaced somewhere way to the west of here.

Mind scoutin' ahead while we get this tank operational?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I came here to fight the Blackrock clan, not get lost in the jungle.

==Completion==
Well, that's one down, and about a dozen others to go. We best get a base goin'. Sounds like we might be here a while.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Rescue Rangari]] before heading out. Additionally, [[Iyun Weald (bonus objective)]] pops up in the area.

Along the road, just before reaching the bridge, find [[Rangari Kolaan]].
:Those foul creatures poison their spears. I keep an antidote but it will take time for my head to celar enough for me to move.
{{gossip|''D'kaan is coming with help.''}}
:{{text|say|Rangari Kolaan|Do not worry about me, my friend. I will await D'kaan's arrival. Please, find the others.}}

Cross the bridge to find [[Rangari Rajess]] just on the other side:
:One thing we learned early from the Laughing Skull: podlings hate fire.
{{gossip|''D'kaan is coming with help.''}}
:{{text|say|Rangari Rajess|Go without me, stranger. I will only slow you down. I shall hold my own until D'kaan arrives.}}

Take a left heading south and find at {{co|57.8|56.0|Gorgrond}} the [[Remains of Balldir Deeprock]] on the bottom of the small pool of water, who apparently did not survive the Gorgrond Water Snakes.

Keep following the path southwest to find [[Rangari Jonaa]]:
:We fought as well as we could. But in the end, too many of my friends were lost.
{{gossip|''D'kaan is coming with help.''}}
:{{text|say|Rangari Jonaa|I will not leave the fallen to the children of the genesaur. I will protect their bodies until D'kaan arrives.}}

Take the right fork to come across [[Glirin]] standing outside a mole machine:
:{{text|say|Glirin|Over here!}}
:A <class>? Oh are you a sight for sore eyes.
:We dinna' expect to hit anything when digging through the ground like we were.
''{{gossip|Thaelin is on his way soon.}}''

When you click on Glirin to talk to him, Darkanvil's tank races up the path and you hear the roar of the engine as it gets near. With a car horn and a dwarvish whoop the tank rams its way through the pile of boulders that Glirin's mole machine upturned, which were blocking the way.  Running up the road to the top of the hill, you find it parked behind the mole machine with the everyone disembarked.
