==Objectives==
Collect 20 Potent Pollen.
*[[Potent Pollen]] (20)

==Description==
The [[botani]] use monstrous [[ravager|insect-like creatures]] to pollinate their bloom.

The pollen they carry has a number of powerful properties that would be of use to your garrison forces.

If you bring me a reserve of this pollen I should be able to convert it to something of value.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]
*50x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
Do you have the pollen?

==Completion==
Keep this up and we'll make a survivalist out of you yet.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Dark Iron Down]] and [[Bushwhacker (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Across the road to the west, get to killing [[Golden Pollinator]]s and [[Thicket Ravager]]s.
