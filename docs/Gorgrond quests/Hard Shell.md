==Objectives==
Collect 9 Goren Shells from [[Boneyard Gorger]]s.
*[[Goren Shell]] (9)

==Description==
I have already learned much from watching the Laughing Skull.

Traveling through [[goren]] tunnels was thought to be impossible due to the acid they leave behind, but the orcs found a way around it.

We will need some of the shells of goren within the canyon.

If you see any of their tunnel craters ready to burst, approach them and goren will come pouring out. This way, you can kill many at once and find the shells more quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Goren seem willing to eat anything in their path, alive or otherwise.

==Completion==
Ah, yes, these shells will work perfectly.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Crystal Shard]], [[Bad at Breaking]], and [[Nisha's Vengeance]] before heading out.

Head southwest into [[Drywind Gorge]], killing goren and looting their crystals all the way. On the west side of the gorge behind a pillar of rocks, find at {{co|43.3|51.7|Gorgrond}} an [[Odd Boulder]]. This one contains the [[Ancient Titan Chest]].

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Sparring Arena}}
