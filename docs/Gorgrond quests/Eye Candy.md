==Objectives==
Collect [[Skothwa]]'s Eye.
*[[Skothwa's Eye]] {{co|41.4|72.6|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
You! Get in the fight or get out of our way.

This is no ordinary [[goren]] attack. Look over there, a gronnling is sacking our grubhall. That hunchbacked gorebucket bit a chunk out of my lovely Marrow!

Rip the eye out of its forehead and bring it to me.

That should buy me enough time to get her clear of this goren hole.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 523 gloves|Steamburst Handwraps|Overgrowth Cutter Gauntlets|Wildwood Wrangler Gloves|Foundry-Fired Plate Handguards}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you make that thing scream? Did it beg for mercy? Did you kill it before taking its eye? Tell me everything.

==Completion==
These puppets of the [[magnaron]] will pay for the skulls they claimed today.

For now, I shall wear this eye across my waist so this fool you have slain may watch as I slowly slaughter his brethren until my dying breath.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Goren, Goren, Gone!]] and [[We Die Laughing!]] before heading out.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Limbflayer|If we don't kill more of these [[goren]] soon they will forget who we are.}}

Head east to find Skothwa inside the grubhall. After completing the objective, head southeast to find Limbflayer, [[Marrow]], [[Kaz the Shrieker]], {{Au|Durotan}}, {{Au|Draka}}, [[Nightstalker (alternate universe)|Nightstalker]] and [[Whitefang]] outside the village's eastern exit.

:{{text|say|Kaz the Shrieker|The mighty Durotan descends from his mountain without an army. It would seem you have grown tired of living.}}
:{{text|say|Durotan|I have come to hunt the [[Iron Horde]]. I could destroy what remains of your ruined village, or perhaps we could assist one another.}}
