==Objectives==
Find [[Altauur]] at [[Dionor's Demise]] in [[Gorgrond]].

==Description==
We are still trying to locate all of our [[scout]]s out in the field. One of these, Altauur, enjoys handling the more dangerous missions.

He has not checked in and I feel we should check to make sure he has not taken on more than he can handle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|90}}
*9450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Rangari D'kaan|D'kaan]] worried about me? He is more worried I will be chased back to [[Highpass|the camp]] with one of those giant beasts in tow. Still I could use your help here...

==Notes==
Exit [[Highpass]] to the west and cut north through the east end of [[Crushfang's End]]. On the way, look to the east to find a cave with a Dying Grom'kar Grunt at its mouth, who says:
:{{text|say|Dying Grom'kar Grunt|It came... in the night...}}
The cave is full of dead orcs and goren, and the cause of all the death, rare mandragora [[Mandrakor]]. Take it out for ... and some [[Garrison Resources]], then keep heading northeast to find [[Altauur]] stealthed on a rock.

==Progression==
{{Dionor's Demise}}
