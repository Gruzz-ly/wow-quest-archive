==Objectives==
Find the pilot of the Dark Iron tank.
*Find [[Thaelin Darkanvil|the pilot of the Dark Iron Tank]] {{co|65.0|48.5|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
What you saw was the wake of the genesaur, [[Iyu]]. It was chasing this mechanical monstrosity and the person who drove it.

I believe the pilot of this vessel is still alive and trapped within the ruins of the camp.

If you wish them to be recovered, I recommend doing so now.

==Completion==
Ah perfect. I'll get this up an' runnin' in no time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90|}}
*14,100 [[XP]]

==Notes==
This is a backup quest in case players did not find [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] in [[Naielle's Watch]] being flung about by an [[Aggressive Growth]] while on [[A Harvester Has Come]] and [[Wake of the Genesaur]]. Kill the tentacle and run back to the road.
