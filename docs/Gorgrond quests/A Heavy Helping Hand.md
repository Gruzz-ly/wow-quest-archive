==Objectives==
Find Dark Iron dwarf survivors.
*Find [[Dark Iron dwarf]] survivors {{co|47.5|94.1|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
[[Burrian Coalpart|Burrian]] gave us the coordinates of the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] base. They named it [[Moira's Reach]].

But half way through buildin' it the base got infested with [[goren]].

If you head south you should come to the structure. Just look for a big ol' cannon.

We will follow as soon as we get this bloody tank untangled.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*23900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
''On approach:''
: {{text|say|Hansel Heavyhands|Over... *cough*... here...}}

==Completion==
Co... Commander? Well ain't you a sight for sore eyes?

I didn't think anyone friendly was comin' for me.

We found an artifact that seemed pretty handy against the locals in the area but then those [[goren|acid-mouthed roly polies]] showed up and started eatin' everything.

Help me up an' we can git to it.

==Notes==
Follow the path south, taking the right fork to continue on the dirt path south, finally reaching [[Bastion Rise]]. Southeast of the rise is a flight path.

On the rise, try to dodge the [[Iyun Reclaimer]]s and [[Acidmouth Breacher]]s and enter the keep, taking the first right. A wounded [[Hansel Heavyhands]] is lying on the ground in front of a door.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill Alliance}}
