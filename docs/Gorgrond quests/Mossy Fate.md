==Objectives==
Search for Torg Earkeeper, Meka the Face Chewer, and Chag the Noseless in [[Bloodthorn Bloom]].
*Find [[Meka the Face Chewer]]
*Find [[Chag the Noseless]]
*Find [[Torg Earkeeper]]

==Description==
Your {{Au|Draka|wolf queen}} will not let me out of her sight.

The children of the [[magnaron]] may have destroyed my village but it was the children of the [[genesaur]] who took my people.

The [[botani]] and their minions drag our people to the Razorbloom, and if we see them again, it is not as they were in life.

You have already helped the Skulls, so I ask your help again.

Enter the Razorbloom and search for my people that were recently taken.

Perhaps they may even be alive.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 525 belts|Foundry-Fired Plate Girdle|Steamburst Cord|Wildwood Wrangler Belt|Overgrowth Cutter Belt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Dead? All dead? Dead and mulched and forgotten. No Chag with his missing nose or Meka with her love for chewing faces.

And Torg, my beloved Torg. A son we had together. A son that is still missing.

The botani will pay for this. They will burn for this.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Infested (Horde)]] before heading out.

Start killing [[Infested Orc]]s and [[Infested Behemoth]]s. The three named orcs are marked on the minimap on the edge of the central pond.

==Progression==
