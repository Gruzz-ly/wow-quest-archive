==Objectives==
Find [[Rakthoth]] at [[Dionor's Demise]] in [[Gorgrond]].

==Description==
The destruction of our village will not be easy to come back from. Our best hunter, Rakthoth, "finds" reagents for our shaman.

She has not been seen for some time and we need those more than ever. Go to her hunting grounds and see if she still lives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|89}}
*1410 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Marrow sent you? Our village destroyed? I would have been back already if it wasn't for these cursed plant beasts!

==Notes==
Exit [[Beastwatch]] and cut north through the east end of [[Crushfang's End]]. On the way, look to the east to find a cave with a Dying Grom'kar Grunt at its mouth, who says:
:{{text|say|Dying Grom'kar Grunt|It came... in the night...}}
The cave is full of dead orcs and goren, and the cause of all the death, rare mandragora [[Mandrakor]]. Take it out for ... and some [[Garrison Resources]], then keep heading northeast to find [[Rakthoth]].

==Progression==
{{Dionor's Demise}}
