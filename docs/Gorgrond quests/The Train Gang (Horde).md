==Objectives==
Use the detonator to blow open the prison train, and convince Roark to join your cause.
*Plant First Explosive 
*Plant Second Explosive
*Plant Third Explosive
*Blow Open the Train
*Recruit Solog Roark

==Description==
My warriors will surround and cover the train car. Hit the detonator to blow open the doors.

I will speak to Roark and convince him to defect to our cause. He built all of this - he's our best hope for building a shipyard of our own.

If this doesn't work, execute him on the spot. The last thing we need is someone rebuilding the [[Iron Fleet]].

==Rewards==
*You will receive: {{cost|1|54}}

==Completion==
Lower your weapon, stranger. Blackhand is dead and our new "Warchief" just signed my death sentence. It looks like I'm going [[mercenary]].

You want to build a shipyard? Then you want me.

==Patch changes==
