==Objectives==
Speak to [[Rangari Erdanii]] at [[Affliction Ridge]].
*Ask [[Rangari Rajess]] to fly you to Rangari Erdanii {{co|52.8|59.3|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
An endless war wages between the creatures of the eastern wilds and the beasts of the western wasteland.

Should one side overwhelm the other, all of Draenor would fall at the hand of the victor.

I sent Rangari Erdanii to the heart of the battle between these two forces. It is likely that she will need your help, commander.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|45}}
*7050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Thank you for coming, commander.

==Completion==
These creatures are relentless in their assault against one another.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Rediscovered Legend (Alliance)]] before heading out.

The fey drake will fly the player west to [[Affliction Ridge]].

==Progression==
