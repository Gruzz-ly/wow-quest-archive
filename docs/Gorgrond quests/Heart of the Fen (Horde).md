==Objectives==
Follow [[Grulkor]] deeper into the [[Crimson Fen]] and deal with what comes.
*Stop Grulkor {{co|61.1|61.8|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
If only the trees here weren't screaming at me I could concentrate better. Never mind, they are only trees.

This spot is used up but now I can feel a much stronger presence deeper in the marsh. I will go there now and take what is rightfully mine!

Then I will share it... with everyone...

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 534 legs|Foundry-Fired Plate Legguards|Steamburst Leggings|Wildwood Wrangler Leggings|Overgrowth Cutter Breeches}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|37|80}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Grulkor was crazy to think he could harness the power of those mushrooms, but then, most Laughing Skull are crazy.

Still, not a complete waste of time.

==Notes==
Head east to the marked island. There, the Red Spore Haze: The air is clogged with spores here, making you feel powerful but dragging you down as well. You should not stay here long... is so thick it starts interfering with vision. On the island, [[Grulkor]] is standing in front of a fungal heart that is apparently not drained. Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Grulkor|It's in my head, <name>! I can't control myself! Kill me before I spread the disease!}}
Finish him off, then before returning to [[Marrow]] at [[Beastwatch]], head east into the water to find rare elite sea serpent [[Sylldross]]. Kill it for the [[Slimy Sea Serpent Skin Sabatons]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].
