==Objectives==
Kill 8 Ogron Spinecrushers and Borogahn.
*[[Ogron Spinecrusher (Gorgrond)|Ogron Spinecrusher]] slain (8)
*[[Borogahn]] slain {{co|30.4|74.1|Fissure of Fury|1}}

==Description==
The ogron here are far from brilliant, but they are more intelligent than the gronn. They're large, and even stronger than they look.

Their leader, Borogahn, is especially formidable. Despite several fights, I have not yet managed to kill him.

Heed my words, friend. Take caution as you explore their lair.

Nisha is ready to move. Ask her to take you to the mouth of the cave, and I'm sure she would be happy to.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ogron Slayer's Axe

==Progress==
It is good to see you still in one piece, <name>.

==Completion==
Most people cannot handle ogron in single combat.

==Notes==
''On accept''
:{{text|say|Rexxar|This is the final resting place of some of my companions who were killed by ogron.}}
: ''He walks over to the right, introducing you to three graves in turn.''
:{{text|say|Rexxar|Visha, newly born and not yet ready for combat.}}
:{{text|say|Rexxar|Qisha, still young but showing great promise.}}
:{{text|say|Rexxar|And finally, the dearest of them all, Latisha.}}
: ''He cries.''
:{{text|say|Rexxar|Were it not for you, this would be Nisha's resting place as well.}}
: ''Rexxar returns to the campfire.''
:{{text|say|Rexxar|Nisha is willing to take you to the den of the ogron if you are in need.}}

Pick up [[Leave Every Soldier Behind]] before heading out.

Speak with Nisha to take a flight directly to the [[Fissure of Fury]]. Start killing a path down to the lower level of the Fissure of Fury. There, [[Corporal Thukmar]] has not survived the experience with his mental faculties intact:
:Kill... eat... torn to pieces... ate... alive... they took us... DIE... kill... me... kill me... KILL ME... please...
:{{gossip|Put the corporal out of his misery.}}
Loot the Thukmar's Research book next to his corpse to acquire [[Thukmar's Intel]], which reads:
{{book|Thukmar's Intel|content=This is magnificent!

I have unearthed an artifact of unknown origin. Touching it instantly floods my mind with a vision of every [[magnaron]], [[gronn]] and the like that walks [[Gorgrond]].

What's more, I am overcome with a sense that each of these creatures are an appendage to me. I have found myself able to commune with them and even shape their thoughts.

I am returning to the [[Blackrock Foundry|foundry]] to inform Blackhand directly. This discovery will hasten our purging of Draenor, and many more worlds to come!}}
Keep circling clockwise to the north to find [[Borogahn]]:
:{{text|say|Borogahn|New plaything!}}

After killing Borogahn, but before taking the Goren Tunnel a dozen yards away from Borogahn, head to the northwest end of the cave to find [[Gelgor of the Blue Flame]]. Additionally, there is a pile of [[Hardened Thornvine]] in Gelgor's room, and an [[Odd Boulder]] in the room to the northeast. Beyond that, there is a [[Horned Skull]] in the center room of the lower level. Once both quest objectives are complete, the [[Goren Tunnel]] lights up with a quest to escape the area, [[A Great Escape]]. Pick it up and click on the tunnel to get out of the cave. On the surface:
:{{text|say|Rexxar|Well done, friend. It is rare for one to emerge from that cave alive.}}
