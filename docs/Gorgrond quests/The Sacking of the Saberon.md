==Objectives==
Find 8 Herb Bundles in saberon stashes at [[Steamscar Rise]].
*[[Saberon Herb Bundle]] (8)

==Description==
The stash mostly contains bits of old animal parts and other junk. Upon closer inspection there are remains of a bundle of herbs and plants.

Rakthoth might be more willing to help if some of these herb bundles were found and gathered for her...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I need more reagents before I return to my brothers and sisters.

==Completion==
So they started storing their herbs in personal stashes instead of their storage dens, good to know.

You have helped me a great deal, <name>.

==Notes==
While in the area for [[Steamscar "Reagents"]], find the [[Saberon Stash]] a few dozen yards to the south of [[Rakthoth]], which offers this quest.

Rakthoth has moved again, and this time is to the southeast of where she was before, up the hill at the south end of the high clearing.
