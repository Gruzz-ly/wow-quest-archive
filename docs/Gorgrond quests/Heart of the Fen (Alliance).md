== Objectives ==
Follow [[Khaano]] deeper into the [[Crimson Fen]] and deal with what comes.
*Stop Khaano {{co|61.1|61.8|Gorgrond}}

== Description ==
The pounding in my head is almost unbearable but I must see this through. With all the spore samples I've taken I know where to go and what to do.

I will find the source and spread... no! Destroy it! I will do what needs to be done!

''On accept''
:{{text|say|Khaano|We must hurry, <name>! I have to get there now!}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 534 legs|Foundry-Fired Plate Legguards|Steamburst Leggings|Wildwood Wrangler Leggings|Overgrowth Cutter Breeches}}
You will also receive: {{cost|37|80}}

== Progress ==
You have new from [[Crimson Fen]]?

== Completion ==
That is terrible news. I will warn off all scouts from venturing to the Crimson Fen from now on. Thank you and I am glad that you were not affected by the spores...

== Gains ==
* 17630 XP

== Notes ==
Head east to the marked island. There, the Red Spore Haze: The air is clogged with spores here, making you feel powerful but dragging you down as well. You should not stay here long... is so thick it starts interfering with vision. On the island, [[Khaano]] is standing in front of a fungal heart that is apparently not drained. Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Khaano|It's in my head, <name>! I can't control myself! Kill me before I spread the disease!}}

;Death
{{text|say|Khaano|Tell D'kaan... I am... sorry...}}

Finish him off, then before returning to [[Rangari D'kaan]] at [[Highpass]], head east into the water to find rare elite sea serpent [[Sylldross]]. Kill it for the [[Slimy Sea Serpent Skin Sabatons]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].
