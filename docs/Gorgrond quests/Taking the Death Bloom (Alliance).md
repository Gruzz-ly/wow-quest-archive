==Description==
Your work has born fruit. Inside the nearby cave a powerful [[saberon]] shaman is learning to channel the genesaur magic using the Death Bloom we seek.

==Progress==
Do you have something for me, little beast?

==Completion==
You have... you have brought me the bloom. At last my purpose can be fulfilled!
