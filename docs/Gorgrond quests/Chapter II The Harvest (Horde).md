==Objectives==
Kill Ontogen the Harvester.
*[[Ontogen the Harvester]] slain {{co|59.9|71.2|Gorgrond}}

== Description ==
I have seen a creature working with the [[Draenor ancient|ancient saplings]], imbuing them with anger and hatred toward creatures unlike them.

Perhaps it is this [[botani]] who is responsible for the unusually aggressive nature of ancients here in Tangleheart. Would killing this botani do us good? I fear I would be no match for it alone.

- [[Frenna]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|30}}
*13970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Big baddy botani busted? Works for me!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Chapter I: Plant Food (Horde)]] and [[Chapter III: Ritual of the Charred (Horde)]] before heading out.

In the greater Tangleheart area, focus on killing [[Draenor ancient]]s until the requisite four are dead, then shift over to [[botani]] to get the last of the [[Ancient Growth Sap]]. [[Ontogen the Harvester]] is in the western lake, and Pollen Pods are all over the area.
