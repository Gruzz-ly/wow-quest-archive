==Objectives==
Collect 100 Ancient Growth Sap from [[botani]] or [[Draenor ancient|ancients]].
*[[Ancient Growth Sap]] (100)

==Description==
We got the lumber mill good an' built, but we be needin' more wood!

The Rangari tol' me there's botani usin' some kinda sap to grow ancients fast as you like.

Get yer hands on some o' that sap and I betcha I can put it work. What? Oh, [[Glyza]] here? Found 'er crashed here and she knows a thing or two about lumberjackin'. I'll take her back to the outpost later.

I'll meet ya near the mole machine if I can find it.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 528 bracers|Steamburst Wristwraps|Foundry-Fired Plate Wristwraps|Wildwood Wrangler Wristwraps|Overgrowth Cutter Wristwraps}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|30}}
*18700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Glyza is good with tools.

==Completion==
Sap? Who called me a sap?! Oh...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Lost Lumberjack (Alliance)]] before heading out. Then follow the path a hundred or so yards to find [[Frenna]]'s corpse. Turn in her quest, then pick up her followups.

In the greater Tangleheart area, focus on killing [[Draenor ancient]]s until the requisite four are dead, then shift over to [[botani]] to get the last of the [[Ancient Growth Sap]]. [[Ontogen the Harvester]] is in the western lake, and Pollen Pods are all over the area.

In the northeastern extent of Tangleheart, find [[Glirin]] still pointing his [[crossbow]] at [[Glyza]], who is working on the Dark Iron mole machine.
