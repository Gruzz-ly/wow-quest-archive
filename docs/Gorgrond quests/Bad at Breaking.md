Search the Iron Horde camp at [[Crushfang's End]].
*[[Mangled Boulderbreaker]] slain {{co|48.0|54.3|Gorgrond}}
*[[Gronnslaver Raz]] slain {{co|47.8|51.7|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
Screams and growls echo from the canyon below - even more than usual.

I don't dare leave Nisha here alone yet.

Will you investigate those noises, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 528 boots|Foundry-Fired Plate Warboots|Steamburst Treads|Wildwood Wrangler Sabatons|Overgrowth Cutter Boots}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Since the Iron Horde formed, these orcs have been getting more dangerous.

==Completion==
They are enslaving gronn? This is an even bigger problem than it might seem.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Crystal Shard]] or [[What the Bony Xuk?]], [[Xuk Me, Right?]] or [[Hard Shell]], and [[Nisha's Vengeance]] before heading out.

Run just to the southeast, killing [[Grom'kar Grunt]]s along the way. Find the [[Mangled Boulderbreaker]] chained up at the south end of the quest area, and [[Gronnslaver Raz]] up the hill at the north end. In the back of a cart where Gronnslaver Raz is, find a book of [[Weaponization Orders]].

==Progression==
