==Objectives==
Watch [[Birchus|Birchus's]] ritual.
*Ritual completed

==Description==
You have given me a tremendous gift with this bloom. I can finally send [[Dionor the Carnivorous|Dionor]] back to the Overgrowth for good and end this nightmare. All that remains is the ritual... stay and behold something you will never see again in your lifetime...

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 534 cloaks|Grace of Dionor|Wisdom of Dionor|Strength of Dionor|Fortitude of Dionor|Clarity of Dionor}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|37|80}}
*17630 [[XP]]

==Completion==
At last it is done. Dionor has left and his spawn shall follow him in due time.

I grow weary of this conflict and the desire to return to the Overgrowth has left me.

Perhaps I will travel beyond these lands and see what other surprises you little beasts have to share...
