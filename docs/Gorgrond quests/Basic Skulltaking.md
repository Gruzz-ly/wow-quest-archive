==Objectives==
Take the skulls from 5 dead Skulltakers.
*[[Skulltaker Skull]] (5)

==Description==
My hunters are all dead, you will be my hunting pack now.

Find their bodies and take their skulls. I will choose which to honor and which to cast aside. It is our way.

I will go further and see what other skulls may be found here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Afraid to get your hands dirty?  They are just bodies now, no need to be scared.

==Completion==
This red slime covers everything, even the skulls of my hunters!  I'll make a Skulltaker of you yet though, great work!

==Notes==
Head south into the [[Crimson Fen]]. Just inside the quest area, look for a [[Dying Skulltaker]], who starts [[Skulltaker's Revenge]]. Pick it up and kill a [[Fungal Lurcher]], which will drop a [[Glowing Red Pod]]. That pod starts [[Mysterious Pod (Horde)]].

==Progression==
