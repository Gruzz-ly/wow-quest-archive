==Objectives==
Break the boulder barrier using [[Beatface]] the gladiator.
*Saberon camp breached

==Description==
The [[saberon]] took their treasure up the rise and barricaded themselves in after [[Birchus]] attacked. It will be difficult to get in but I hear you have resources to handle this.

One of their entrances is covered with a large boulder. Too large for you or I, but perhaps an ogre with a large enough hammer could break it. I think you know who I am talking about...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have strong friends <name>. We must make haste before the plants realize the way is open.

==Notes==
Exit the cave, turn south and head uphill to the marked spot on the minimap. Near the southwestern end of the ridge, find an [[Odd Boulder]]. This one contains an [[Ancient Titan Chest]]. Head southeast from the Odd Boulder to get to the Large Boulder, and interact with it to get Beatface to break it as Altauur stealths on by:
