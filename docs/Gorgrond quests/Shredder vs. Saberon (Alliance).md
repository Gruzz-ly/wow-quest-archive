*Saberon vine barrier breached {{co|52.2|48.6|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
The [[saberon]] took their treasure up the rise and barricaded themselves in after [[Birchus]] attacked. It will be difficult to get in but I hear you have resources to handle this.

You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*18900 [[XP]]

==Completion==

From the north end, head south to find the Strong Vine Barricade. Interact with the vines to quickly hop on the shredder and shred the vines as Altauur stealths on by.
