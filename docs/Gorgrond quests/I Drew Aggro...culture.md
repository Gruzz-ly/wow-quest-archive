==Objectives==
Meet [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] at the [[Wildwood Wash]].

==Description==
<Name>? Boy am I glad to see ya.

I was tryin' ta ditch that genesaur when I stumbled across this rangari camp.

Next thing I know, the ground is creepin' up and spitting out all sorts of angry plants.

I barely made it out of me tank before that genesaur threw it like it was an empty beer mug.

I'm gonna make my way back to the road an' look fer me tank.

I'll see ya there when yer done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah perfect. I'll get this up an' runnin' in no time.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|Ya don't have to tell me twice. I'll meet ya on the road.}}

While in [[Naielle's Watch]] for [[A Harvester Has Come]] and [[Wake of the Genesaur]], find Thaelin Darkanvil being flung about by a tentacle of [[Aggressive Growth]]. Kill the growth and pick up this quest from him. Finish up the other quests in the area before finding Thaelin back at his siege tank, where the genesaur attacked, on the road.
