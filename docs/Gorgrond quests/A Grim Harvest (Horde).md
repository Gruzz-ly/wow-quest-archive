==Objectives==
Bring Grulkor 3 Spore Pods from the [[Fungal Stomper]]s.
*[[Enlarged Stomper Spore Pod]] (3)

==Description==
The larger monsters are the key to my destiny, I can feel it. The pods growing on them are even bigger than the one you brought me earlier.

Get me a few of these, they will be... helpful... soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I need more of those pods!  Many more!

==Completion==
These will aid me greatly.  I must consume them and take their power.  We are close to the end <name>, I can feel it.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Heartfelt Search (Horde)]] before heading out.

Kill [[fungal giant]]s between Grulkor's position and the Drained Fungal Heart island to the south, hopefully gathering five hearts before reaching the island.

West of Grulkor's new position, find a rare elite fungal giant [[Fungal Praetorian]]. It drops a [[Precious Mushroom]], which starts [[Trophy of Glory: Fungal Praetorian (Horde)]].

==Progression==
