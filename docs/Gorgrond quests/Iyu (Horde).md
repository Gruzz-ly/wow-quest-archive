==Objectives==
Defeat Iyu.
*[[Iyu]] slain

==Description==
There is a [[genesaur]] here!

It wants its artifact back.

Kaz and Draka are fighting it now on the surface but they need you. Draka said I could fire the big gun. So I will stay here and do that.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 543 chestpieces|Foundry-Fired Plate Chestplate|Wildwood Wrangler Vest|Overgrowth Cutter Vest|Steamburst Robe}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It was an honor to fight by your side today, commander.

==Notes==
Head back upstairs. The goren have cleared out, but podlings in the form of [[Iyun Pustule]]s have invaded. Upstairs, the western path is blocked off, so take the east fork.
More [[Aggressive Growth]] tentacles are in the next room. Dodge the [[Vine Beast]] in the next room and get outside, where Kaz and Draka are staring down [[Iyu]]. Aggro it and the two orcs will help kill the genesaur.
