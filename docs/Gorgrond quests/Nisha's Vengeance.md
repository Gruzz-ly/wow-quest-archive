==Objectives==
Kill 10 Grom'kar Grunts.
*[[Grom'kar Grunt]] slain (10)

==Description==
Since I left on my last hunt, the Iron Horde have drawn nearer and reinforced their positions.

<A grin spreads across Rexxar's lips.>

They've created a target-rich environment.

I must continue nursing Nisha to health for now. You go in my stead, friend. Fill them with the fear and pain that they inflicted on her.

Make their screams fill the canyon!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The fewer of them the better.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Nisha is nearly returned to health.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Crystal Shard]] or [[What the Bony Xuk?]], [[Xuk Me, Right?]] or [[Hard Shell]], and [[Bad at Breaking]] before heading out.

Run just to the southeast, killing [[Grom'kar Grunt]]s along the way. Find the [[Mangled Boulderbreaker]] chained up at the south end of the quest area, and [[Gronnslaver Raz]] up the hill at the north end. In the back of a cart where Gronnslaver Raz is, find a book of [[Weaponization Orders]].
