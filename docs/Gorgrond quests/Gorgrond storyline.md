The '''Gorgrond storyline''' is the level-up experience in [[Gorgrond]] on {{Au|Draenor}}. The Gorgrond storyline is unique in that the decision of which building gets built at the player's Garrison outpost (either [[Highpass]] or [[Beastwatch]] for the Alliance or Horde, respectively) affects how the rest of the zone storyline plays out. The lumber mill option will send players to the jungle overgrowth of southern Gorgrond, while the sparring arena option instead sends players to the brutal wastelands of northern Gorgrond.

Whichever chain does not get chosen will unlock a number of bonus objectives that take place where players would have been directed to quest. So, even if players pick the Sparring Arena, they still have the option to complete some quest objectives in [[Tangleheart]] and [[Evermorn Springs]].

The tracking achievement for the Gorgrond storyline is [[Putting the Gore in Gorgrond]]. Don't forget about the [[:Category:Gorgrond vignettes|vignettes in Gorgrond]] either. Additionally, there are eight rare-elite mobs whose death is required for [[Gorgrond Monster Hunter]].

After this, if players have reached level 94, the [[Talador storyline]] begins with [[News from Talador]]. If not, go complete some bonus objectives! The other side of the zone is full of objectives for players to complete if they didn't quest there.

===Bonus objectives===
As with the rest of the zone, some Bonus Objectives are only open to players who chose a specific building. These building-locked objectives send players to where they would have quested had they chosen the other building. Completing all available Bonus Objectives awards the achievement [[Make It a Bonus]].
