==Objectives==
[[File:Fungal Stomper.jpg|thumb|Fungal Stomper]]
Bring Khaano 5 Spore Pods from the [[Fungal Stomper]]s.
*[[Enlarged Stomper Spore Pod]] (5)

==Description==
The spores grow thick further into the marsh, but those larger fungus beasts are the key.

Yes, kill them and take their spore sacs. I will need them to refine my... search.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Those pods are critical <name>, I need them!

==Completion==
I... I must consume these like the mushrooms. It will help me locate the source, I swear!

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Heartfelt Search (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Kill [[fungal giant]]s between Khaano's position and the Drained Fungal Heart island to the south, hopefully gathering five hearts before reaching the island.

West of Khaano's new position, find a rare elite fungal giant [[Fungal Praetorian]]. It drops a [[Precious Mushroom]], which starts [[Trophy of Glory: Fungal Praetorian (Alliance)]].

==Progression==
{{Crimson Fen}}
