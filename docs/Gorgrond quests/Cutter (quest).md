==Objectives==
Find [[Cutter]].

==Description==
You found many Laughing Skulls. All friends, all loved, all dead. But you did not find my precious Cutter.

They must have taken him to [[Evermorn Springs]].

Find him, and rescue him.

He is a good boy, and deserves a better death than infesting.

I am going to round up some ravagers and take the place by air. Look for me in Evermorn if you find Cutter before I do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The botani took my dad. They took my friends. And now they are making me eat fruit!

Why are they so mean?!

Did you kill them all?

I think you should kill them.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bushwhacker (Horde)]] and [[Pollen Power (Horde)]] before heading out.

Get to killing [[Golden Pollinator]]s and [[Thicket Ravager]]s before entering [[Evermorn Springs]]. Kill a path (but don't kill too many botani just yet) to the southwest extent of the quest area and find [[Cutter]] in a hollowed out tree, surrounded by food. Turn in this quest and pick up his followups.
