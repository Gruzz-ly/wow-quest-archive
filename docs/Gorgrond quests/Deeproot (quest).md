==Objectives==
Meet [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] at [[Deeproot]].

==Description==
Since yer all set up to take on trees and bushes now, I need ta ask for a favor.

I came to [[Gorgrond]] in search of an expedition of me fellow [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] that were headed this way. Sadly I lost 'em.

I am goin' south to look for them. Thing is, south is nothing but [[botani]], [[podling]]s, [[draenor ancient|giant trees]], and other mean, angry plants.

Yer lumber camp resources would be mighty appreciated. If ya help me look for me friends I swear we'll help ya in any way we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|89}}
*2350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah good! Ya made it.

The lasses here insisted on comin' with, though they don't seem to like each other much.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|I'm gonna load up me tank and head southwest. I'll see if I can't get one of these rangari to be a guide.}}

''On approach'':
:{{text|say|Rangari Kaalya|A temple-kneeler and a metal-bender have no place in this jungle. You will need my help to survive.}}
: ''Yrel is annoyed with Kaalya's attitude.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Prophet Velen trusted me to turn the Iron Horde from Karabor. I can handle the jungle.}}
:{{text|say|Rangari Kaalya|Hmmph. Just keep up if you can.}}

Pick up [[Tangleheart (Alliance)]] and [[Rangari in the Red]] before heading out. Do the Rangari in the Red side chain at [[Crimson Fen]] or not, then exit [[Highpass]] to the south, cutting through [[Mistcreep Mire]]. Head southeast in the mire to reach the [[Tangleheart]], or southwest to get to [[Tangleroot]].

Heading southwest, dodge all the basilisk and hydras and head west to reach [[Deeproot]]. Pick up the flight path.

==Progression==
