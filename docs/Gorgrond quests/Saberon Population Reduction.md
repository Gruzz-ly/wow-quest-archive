==Objectives==
Slay 10 [[saberon]] at [[Steamscar Rise]].
*Steamscar saberon slain (10)

==Description==
We are closer to our goals but a host of sharp toothed saberon bar our way.

If we are to get anywhere up here, some of the more aggressive ones will need to be put down I think.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 530 off-hands|Steamscar Vessel|Steamscar Shaman's Barrier|Steamscar Shield|Steamscar Sabre|Steamscar Cudgel|Steamscar Shank}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you finished killing the saberon soldiers?

==Completion==
Many are finding bolt holes to weather your storm, friend.  That should keep them out of our way.

==Notes==
A few yards to the south of Altauur is a [[Saberon Stash]]. Interact with it to pick up [[Reclaiming Property]] before heading out.

Altauur has moved again, and this time is to the southeast of where he was before, up the hill at the south end of the high clearing.
