==Objectives==
Use the Improved Iron Trap to capture a Boar or Riverbeast in Gorgrond and then place a Work Order at your Barn.
*Beast Trapped
*Place A Large Work Order
*[[Improved Iron Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
We've had a chance to work with these beasts for a while now, and that's allowed us to develop a brand-new trap for you to try out. It should be much sturdier than the last one.

The Improved Iron Trap will let you capture some of the meatiest beasts on Draenor. You will find that a single riverbeast or boar from Gorgrond can feed many warriors.

Trap one and bring it back, and we will cook you a savage meal.

==Completion==
Ah, so the trap held! I can smell the meat already. This will make a great feast for our warriors!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
