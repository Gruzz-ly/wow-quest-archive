==Objectives==
Recover the Will of the Genesaur.
*[[Will of the Genesaur]]

==Description==
I am pretty sure those dwarves took the artifact in that iron fort there.

Are you going to go get it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Kaz said she wants me to hide for this fight.

==Completion==
The [[genesaur]] is coming!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Down the Goren Hole (Horde)]] and [[Doomshot (quest)]] before heading out.

Kill anything that moves. Doomshot is rather large-caliber rounds strewn all over the ground. Head to the back (southward) and to the lower level.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill}}
