== Objectives ==
Find [[Kash'drakor (alternate universe)|Kash'drakor]] near the [[Stonemaul Arena]] in [[Gorgrond]].

== Description ==
If your troops are going to learn to fight people you better get people to fight! And they better be good.

Ever hear of Kash'drakor?

He's a big famous [[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolf orc]] warrior type that tried to kill us [[Laughing Skull Orcs|Skulls]]. He would have won too, if the ogres hadn't snatched him.

To the north is the Stonemaul Arena where they took him and a bunch of other big bad mean fighter gladiators.

If you can find a way to free them, they could be the best trainers you could hope for.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|89}}

== Completion ==
The Laughing Skull sent you? If they were any other clan I would find that ironic.

I am Kash'drakor, hero of the Frostwolf clan, and champion of the slave pits of Stonemaul.

And yet, despite all these titles, I need your help.

== Gains ==
* 1410 XP

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Rage and Wisdom (Horde)]] before heading out. Hold off on this quest for a bit, and work on the Rage and Wisdom chain first.

After meeting a rather notable Horde NPC in the [[Sulfur Basin]], sneak off to the southwest to find [[Gladiator Akaani]], [[Kash'drakor (alternate universe)|Kash'drakor]], and [[Beatface]].

==Progression==
{{Supporting Your Garrison - Sparring Arena}}
