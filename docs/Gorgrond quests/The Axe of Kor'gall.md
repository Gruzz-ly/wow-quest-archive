==Description==
Time for vengeance! We are going to kill Kor'gall and you are going to take his axe.

Shatter this feeble barrier, follow the bridge beyond until you reach the chieftain's throne.

You freed us, so the honor of first blood is yours. Strike the first blow and we will join you in the cutting.

Kor'gall has ruled uncontested for far too long.

This blade has caused enough pain and suffering for one lifetime. We shall see to it that it is properly disposed of.

==Notes==
Interact with the Ogre Barricade next to the friendly gladiators and follow the bridge. Kor'gall is sitting on his throne.
