Defeat Iyu.

==Description==
Did ya hear that?

Sounds like that [[genesaur]] wants its 'will' back. I told ya this place is nuthin' but bad luck.

I'll git that shot ya gave me loaded properly and see if I can't weaken that thing up. You better get up there and deal with it though...

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 543 chestpieces|Foundry-Fired Plate Chestplate|Wildwood Wrangler Vest|Overgrowth Cutter Vest|Steamburst Robe}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes your search?

==Completion==
That was a challenge.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|yell|Hansel Heavyhands|Git to the surface an' keep that genesaur busy. I'll git this cannon firin' soon as I can!}}

Head back upstairs. The goren have cleared out, but podlings in the form of [[Iyun Pustule]]s have invaded. Upstairs, Thaelin and Burrian have made it, but blocked off the western path, so take the east fork.
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|Oy! Commander! That genesaur found us. The lasses are outside tryin' to keep it at bay. They are gonna need yer help!}}
More [[Aggressive Growth]] tentacles are in the next room, but these have a bit more health than the first one way back at [[Naielle's Watch]]. Dodge the [[Vine Beast]] in the next room and get outside, where [[Yrel]] and [[Rangari Kaalya]] are staring down [[Iyu]]. Aggro it and Kaalya and Yrel will help kill the genesaur.

;Aggro
:{{text|yell|Yrel|For the light!}}

;Grow Vine Beast
:{{text|yell|Yrel|We do not fear you!}}
:{{text|yell|Rangari Kaalya|Watch your flank, sister.}}

;Defeated
:{{text|say|Rangari Kaalya|Be at peace.}}
