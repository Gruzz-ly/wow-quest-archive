==Objectives==
Bring the Glowing Red Pod to [[Khaano]] at [[Crimson Fen]] in [[Gorgrond]].
*[[Glowing Red Pod]] (provided)

==Description==
This pod is similar to the ones growing on or near the bodies around here, except this one is pulsating weirdly.

This is something Khaano would be interested in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|45}}
*11850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've seen these around on corpses and the beasts, but not as big. Let me see it...

==Notes==
While in the [[Crimson Fen]] for [[Scout Forensics]], players will come across the [[Dying Rangari]], who starts [[Vengeance for the Fallen (Gorgrond)]]. That quest has players killing [[Fungal Lurcher]]s, of which the first will drop the [[Glowing Red Pod]], which starts this quest.
