==Objectives==
Slay 7 Bloom Weavers.
*[[Bloom Weaver]] slain (7)

==Description==
We are continuing the search for [[Thaelin Darkanvil|Thaelin's]] people, but these [[botani]], they are a larger threat than we ever realized.

To infest their victims... monstrous.

Please, commander, if you find yourself in [[Evermorn Springs]] to our west, slay as many of those creatures as you can.

Stop them from committing such acts of horror. Bring them to justice.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 525 rings|Botani Grower's Ring|Botani Tender's Seal|Botani Mender's Signet|Botani Leafbloomer's Signet|Botani Pruner's Signet}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We had always revered the botani back in [[Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)|Shadowmoon]].  Now, I see them for the horror they can become.

==Completion==
Well done, commander. At every turn you seem to demonstrate an efficiency with war that even our most seasoned exarchs might fight to be challenging.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Dark Iron Down]] and [[Pollen Power (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Across the road to the west, get to killing [[Golden Pollinator]]s and [[Thicket Ravager]]s before entering [[Evermorn Springs]]. Kill a path (but don't kill too many botani just yet) to the southwest extend of the quest area and find [[Burrian Coalpart]] in a hollowed out tree, surrounded by food. Work on his quests and players should wind up killing enough Bloom Weavers for this quest.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill Alliance}}
