==Objectives==
Kill 12 defenders at [[Dionor's Demise]].
*Dionor defenders slain (12)

==Description==
I have a hunting den not far from here where I gather my trophies as well as reagents for the Laughing Skull. Not long ago this giant plant monster charged in from the overgrowth and was killed by several of the giant rock monsters. Since it died smaller plant beasts have sprung up and made a mess of the place.

They have also cut me off from my best source of reagents. Kill them, I will attempt to reach my den and salvage what I can...

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 528 belts|Steamburst Waistwrap|Overgrowth Cutter Girdle|Wildwood Wrangler Links|Foundry-Fired Plate Waistguard}}
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you cleared a path yet?

==Completion==
They just keep coming back! I would hate to lose this hunting ground. We shall find a way clear this growth, I swear it.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ambassador to the Ancient (Horde)]] before heading out.

Then enter the forested area and start killing [[botani]] and [[tentacle]]s.

At the southern end of the forested area, find a pile of [[Hardened Thornvine]], which can be shredded by players who chose the Lumber Mill to find an [[Aged Stone Container]].

At the northern end of the quest area, [[Char the Burning]], a rare [[Draenor ancient]], has been set alight by some [[Grom'kar Pyro]]s. Loot Char's corpse for [[Char's Smoldering Fist]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]]. Additionally, to the northwest, elite [[steam elemental]] [[Erosian the Violent]] is found. An objective of [[Gorgrond Monster Hunter]], Erosian drops [[Crystalized Steam]], which starts [[Trophy of Glory: Erosian]].
