==Objectives==
Take the proof to [[Rangari Jonaa]] at [[Highpass]] in [[Gorgrond]].
*[[Elemental Crystal]]

==Description==
This crystal is proof of your strength at slaying [[elemental]]s and your gladiator friend has born witness!

Take the crystal back to Jonaa and claim your accolades!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90|}}
*14,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have seen no elementals elsewhere in {{Au|Draenor}} that compare in ferocity to those in Gorgrond. I wonder what caused them to be so angry. That crystal was hard-won I am sure!
