==Objectives==
Collect 100 Ancient Growth Sap from [[botani]] or [[Draenor ancient|ancients]] within [[Tangleheart]].
*[[Ancient Growth Sap]] (100)

==Description==
I found this dwarf, Thuldren, runnin' out of Tangleheart like his boots were on fire. Says his mole machine showed up here and he barely made it out alive. And another called Frenna might still be inside. One useful thing he told me is that the creatures in there have sap that can be used to grow things real fast. By the way, I'm gonna go lookin' for Thuldren's mole machine. Find me in Tangleheart when you're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 528 bracers|Steamburst Wristwraps|Foundry-Fired Plate Wristwraps|Wildwood Wrangler Wristwraps|Overgrowth Cutter Wristwraps}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|30}}
*13970 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't be such a sap. Get it?!

==Completion==
You got it! You should be able to use this mole machine one way back to your outpost.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Lost Lumberjack (Horde)]] before heading out. Then follow the path a hundred or so yards to find [[Frenna]]'s corpse. Turn in her quest, then pick up her followups.

In the greater Tangleheart area, focus on killing [[Draenor ancient]]s until the requisite four are dead, then shift over to [[botani]] to get the last of the [[Ancient Growth Sap]]. [[Ontogen the Harvester]] is in the western lake, and Pollen Pods are all over the area.
