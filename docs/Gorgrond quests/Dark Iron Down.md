==Description==
While you were away [[Rangari Kaalya|our rangari]] here found more clues leadin' to some of me other friends.

Burrian Coalpart and [[Scorchbrow]].

Ah! It was terrible! They made me eat an' eat an' eat.

Don' get me wrong, I enjoy a good meal but these plant people had me eatin' nuthin' but fruit.

I canno' take it anymore.

==Notes==
''On approach''
:{{text|say|Burrian Coalpart|Hey oh!  These plant people make quite a spread, but I canno' stand the sight o' it much longer!}}

Pick up [[Bushwhacker (Alliance)]] and [[Pollen Power (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Across the road to the west, get to killing [[Golden Pollinator]]s and [[Thicket Ravager]]s before entering [[Evermorn Springs]]. Kill a path (but don't kill too many botani just yet) to the southwest extent of the quest area and find [[Burrian Coalpart]] in a hollowed out tree, surrounded by food. Turn in this quest and pick up his followups.

''On complete''
