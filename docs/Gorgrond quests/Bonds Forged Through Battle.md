==Objectives==
Assist [[Overlord Geya'rah|Geya'rah]] in putting down the [[ogre]] uprising.

*[[Kor'gall Defector]] slain (10)
*{{mob|Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall}} slain

==Description==
Geya'rah has a fiery spirit... like {{Au|Draka|her mother}}. Perhaps facing a common foe will ease her wariness.

We subdued the ogre [[clan]]s long ago. But every so often, one of their bravest--and stupidest--stirs the embers of rebellion. Today is such a day.

You and [[Eitrigg]] will join Geya'rah in putting down the ogre uprising. Prove yourself in battle and you may earn her respect.

==Progress==
Don't slow me down.

==Completion==
We have to deal with an ogre uprising every few seasons.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|Eitrigg and <name> will aid you in putting down the ogre instigator, Geya'rah.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|I do not need the help of outsiders... but I will do as you command. Come!}}

Eitrigg and Geya'rah will travel with you to the ogre base. On entering [[Sulfur Basin]]:
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|You are the daughter of {{Au|Durotan}} and Draka. I see them both in you. Are your parents...}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|My mother commands a garrison in {{Au|Nagrand}}. My father fell in battle to the [[Lightbound]].}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Lightbound?}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Enough questions. Ride!}}

Proceed to [[Stonemaul Arena|Stonemaul]]. At the entrance, a [[Stonemaul Ogre (Gorgrond)|Stonemaul Ogre]] speaks up:
:{{text|say|Stonemaul Ogre|Overlord! Stonemaul don't want trouble with orcs. Kor'gall's in his cave.}}

Kill 10 Kor'gall Defectors or [[Kor'gall Agitator]]s outside, then proceed inside to the [[Throne of Kor'gall]] to confront [[Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall]].
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|What is the meaning of this uprising, Kor'gall? You know we must stand together--now more than ever.}}
:{{text|say|Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall|You cannot protect your own people, daughter of wolves. Why would we follow you?}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Silence! If you will not stand down, I will put you down myself.}}
:{{text|say|Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall|The {{Au|Mag'har}} are doomed, Geya'rah. But I have ensured that my clan will endure long after yours has fallen to dust.}}

Kor'gall removes his helmet to reveal eyes glowing with the [[Light]]; he has aligned with the [[Lightbound]], and summons a [[Lightbound Warpriest]]. Kill them both. 

:{{Text|say|Lightbound Warpriest|We can save Draenor together!}}

After Kor'gall falls, {{Au|Lantresor of the Blade}} runs in.
:{{text|say|Lantresor of the Blade|Overlord Geya'rah! The Lightbound are attacking [[Beastwatch]]!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Damn those traitors! How great a force do they have?}}
:{{text|say|Lantresor of the Blade|An exarch leads them. Their numbers are... considerable.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Good! I've been wanting another exarch's head upon my wall. Come, outsiders!}}

After Lantresor leaves:
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|It is time you explained who these Lightbound are, overlord.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|I suppose you have earned that much.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|After [[Archimonde]]'s fall, the orcs and draenei worked together to drive the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] from {{Au|Draenor}}. Those were good years.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|But without demons to fight, the draenei became fixated on their precious [[Light]].}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Their [[naaru]] masters compelled them to spread their influence among the orcs. A few converted willingly. Others had the Light forced upon them.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Some orcs even sided with the draenei against their own kin... even the warchief's own son was lost! We call these traitors Lightbound.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|I will not stand by while the [[Yrel|High Exarch]] crusades against Mag'har freedom! The tyranny of the Light must be ended!}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|We will fight with you, overlord!}}
