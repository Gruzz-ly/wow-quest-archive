Slay the Voice of Iyu.

==Description==
Journal Entry 25 -

The [[botani]] got themselves a leader who calls himself... er... herself... er... itself the Voice of Iyu.

Seems the botani see the [[genesaur]] as gods and only the most bossy of the botani get to speak on behalf of the genesaur.

When we tried askin' it about the artifact we found back at the base it got all angry and sent off [[Lera Ashtoes|Lera]] and [[Nori Sootstash|Nori]] and I ain't seen either of them since.

I got a bad feelin' about this thing.

==Progress==

==Completion==
They mulched my friends? Those pointy branch wavers with their wee beady eyes! Thank ya for avenging ma friends.

We best be findin' the others before they get turned into plant food.

==Notes==
Follow the path to the northeast to find the [[Voice of Iyu]] inside a hollowed-out tree. Knock him out, then head just to the north of the tree to find a basket of [[Enriched Seeds]], which starts [[Super Seeds (Alliance)]].

On return:
