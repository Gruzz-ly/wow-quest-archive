==Objectives==
Slay 3 Dew Masters.
*[[Dew Master]] slain (3)

==Description==
They steal children? Children?!

Had you not rescued Kaz's child, he would be reduced to mulch just like the others.

You should send them a message they will understand. Cut down their great dew casters. Rip them apart.

Let them know that it is not okay to take our children.

==Rewards==
*You will receive: {{cost|18|90}}

==Completion==
They are lucky you are the one that killed them. I would have tried to carve pictures in their dead wood bodies.

==Patch changes==
