==Objectives==
Take the proof to [[Rangari Jonaa]] at [[Highpass]] in [[Gorgrond]].
*[[Gronnling Scale]]

==Description==
This scale is proof of your strength at slaying ogron{{sic}} and your gladiator friend has born witness!

Take the scale back to Jonaa and claim your accolades!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90|}}
*14,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A gladiator saw you tear this off the back of a [[gronnling]], which I am sure did not part with it easily. It is more like a stone than a true scale though as these brutes are part stone it seems. Not an easy trophy to collect!

==Notes==
*Completing this is a criterion for [[Prove Your Strength]].
