==Objectives==
Slay 7 Bloom Weavers.
*[[Bloom Weaver]] slain (7)

==Description==
[[Kaz the Shrieker|Kaz]] is using us, I am sure of it. She is a [[Laughing Skull Orcs|Laughing Skull]] and must NOT be trusted.

For now, I am willing to play along until we can learn more.

Kaz is going to ask for you to travel to [[Evermorn Springs]]. When there, I recommend you slay any [[botani]] you encounter.

Culling the numbers of these horrific casters will hopefully save future [[orc]]s from such a infested fate.

I will stay with Kaz and keep a close eye on her.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 525 rings|Botani Grower's Ring|Botani Tender's Seal|Botani Mender's Signet|Botani Leafbloomer's Signet|Botani Pruner's Signet}}
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I had thought the Laughing Skull were planning something. Now I think I am beginning to understand.

They match savagery with savagery.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cutter (quest)]] and [[Pollen Power (Horde)]] before heading out.

Get to killing [[Golden Pollinator]]s and [[Thicket Ravager]]s before entering [[Evermorn Springs]]. Kill a path (but don't kill too many botani just yet) to the southwest extent of the quest area and find [[Cutter]] in a hollowed out tree, surrounded by food. Turn in this quest and pick up his followups.
