==Objectives==
Pay homage to the orc clan symbols.
*{{Au|Blackrock clan|Blackrock}}
*{{Au|Warsong clan|Warsong}}
*[[Frostwolf Orcs|Frostwolf]]

==Description==
This [[Overlord Geya'rah]] has a fire inside her. I may come to like her... if she doesn't kill us.

We have but one chance. You pay homage to the symbol of each clan, and I will speak of it.

Show respect--or they will show us the executioner's blade.

==Progress==
I do not have time for this.

==Completion==
So you know of our clans.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|The three banners in this camp will be known to any true orc. Tell me of them, or it's the executioner's blade for you both!}}

First is the [[Blackrock (object)|Blackrock]] banner. Click it:
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|The Blackrock... my own clan. We were proud orcs... fierce soldiers. But we were deceived by [[Gul'dan]]'s [[fel]] magic and did... terrible things.}}

Next, the [[Warsong (object)|Warsong]]:
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|The Warsong clan struggled for generations against the [[ogre]]s. Though vastly outnumbered, [[Grommash Hellscream]] led his people to a great victory over the [[Highmaul]].}}

And lastly, the [[Frostwolf (object)|Frostwolf]]:
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|[[Durotan]] was [[chieftain]] of the Frostwolves. Never have I known a more honorable orc. He was a true leader who loved his people. I miss his wisdom.}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Your words stir my heart, old one. We still honor the history of our clans, though we stand united as the Mag'har. But you have yet to prove--}}

At that moment, {{Au|Grommash Hellscream}}, Warchief of the {{Au|Mag'har}} - aged yet still recognizable - approaches.
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|Enough! I will judge the prisoners for myself, Geya'rah.}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|It has been many years since I set eyes upon a green-skinned orc. And this one at your side is... familiar. You come from [[Azeroth]].}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Indeed. I am Eitrigg, and this is <name>, champion of the [[Horde]].}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|Eitrigg... I knew an {{Au|Eitrigg}} who served {{Au|Blackhand}}. He was an honorable orc who died in glorious battle.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|And the [[Grommash Hellscream]] I knew gave his life to free us from the grip of [[demon]]s. A worthy death.}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|Well then here we are... two old [[ghost]]s. Why have you returned to {{Au|Draenor}} after all this time?}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Heroes from my world once freed yours from the grip of tyrants. Now [[Azeroth]] faces a similar threat, so we have come to ask repayment of that debt.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Do you think us fools?! Warchief, we cannot pledge our soldiers to these off-worlders. Not when we face foes of our own!}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|{{Au|Durotan}} owed a debt to these heroes, Geya'rah, same as I. You dishonor your father's spirit with your outburst. Still... you have given me an idea...}}

Speak to Grommash for the next quest.
