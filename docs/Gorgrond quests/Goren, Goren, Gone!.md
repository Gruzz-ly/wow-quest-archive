==Objectives==
Slay 8 Acidtooth Devourers.
*[[Acidtooth Devourer]] slain (8)

==Description==
We... we left the [[goren]] alone for too long. They have grown bold and forgotten who we are.

Kill them! Kill them all. Rip them apart until they scream. Remind them what happens to anyone who tries to attack a Laughing Skull village.

Oh, and welcome to Gorgrond.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Rip them tooth from claw.

==Completion==
Ripfist's dying wish has been satisfied. Goren corpses litter the ground, and these corpses have not gone unnoticed by the nearby goren.

==Notes==
Acidtooth Devourers are be found all over the village. [[Kaz the Shrieker]] is standing inside a hut, fiddling with a fire totem.

:{{text|yell|Kaz the Shrieker|I'll give you goren something to eat!}}

[[Limbflayer]] and [[Marrow]] are found a bit further east under an outcropping, surrounded by dead Devourers.

Pick up [[We Die Laughing!]] from Kaz and [[Eye Candy]] from Limbflayer before heading out.
