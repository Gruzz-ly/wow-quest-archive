==Objectives==
Kill Ontogen the Harvester.
*[[Ontogen the Harvester]] slain {{co|59.9|71.2|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
I have seen a creature working with the [[Draenor ancient|ancient saplings]], imbuing them with anger and hatred toward creatures unlike them.

Perhaps it is this [[botani]] who is responsible for the unusually aggressive nature of ancients here in [[Tangleheart]].

Would killing this botani do us good? I fear I would be no match for it alone.

- [[Frenna]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|30}}
*18700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hey there, <name>.

==Completion==
Ya took out the big nasty, did ya? Yer sure to be causin' some real trouble out there!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Chapter I: Plant Food (Alliance)]] and [[Chapter III: Ritual of the Charred (Alliance)]] before heading out.

In the greater Tangleheart area, focus on killing [[Draenor ancient]]s until the requisite four are dead, then shift over to [[botani]] to get the last of the [[Ancient Growth Sap]]. [[Ontogen the Harvester]] is in the western lake, and Pollen Pods are all over the area.

In the northeastern extent of Tangleheart, find [[Glirin]] still pointing his [[crossbow]] at [[Glyza]], who is working on the Dark Iron mole machine.
:{{text|say|Glirin|Put yer back into it. There ya go!}}

;On complete of all four
:{{text|say|Glirin|Commander, feel free to use the mole machine to return to yer outpost. I'll get ya there. Perhaps.}}
