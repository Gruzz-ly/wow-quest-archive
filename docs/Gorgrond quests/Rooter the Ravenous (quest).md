==Objectives==
Find food for Rooter at Rooter's Pass in Gorgrond.
*[[Prickly Nopal]] (5)

==Description==
The stray boar is digging through garbage left behind by the iron horde. He stops chewing and stares at you-then he burps.

He smells terrible.

It looks like he's chewing on a chunk of rotten meat. Maybe you can find something a bit healthier for him to snack on?

==Progress==
That rotten meat looks gross. Find rooter something healthy to eat.

==Completion==
You feed the hungry boar the nopales. He devours them whole and smacks his lips.

Rooter jumps up onto you and licks your face with his disgusting tongue.

It looks like you have made a new friend.

==Trivia==
*During the beta, the food was found at [[Emberfall Lake]].
