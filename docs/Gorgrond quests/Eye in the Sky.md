==Objectives==
Speak to [[Nisha (dread raven)|Nisha]].
*Scout with Nisha {{co|43.9|48.9|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
The notes you recovered tell of a device capable of subjugating even a [[magnaron]].

Ancient legends speak of such artifacts, crafted by the worldbuilders to keep these creatures in check.  I had discounted them as silly stories, but if they are true...

<Name>, {{Au|Draenor}} is doomed.

No army will be able to stop them if they harness this power. We must stop them or die trying.

Here, I shall bind our sight to Nisha and hope she can locate this artifact.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We are in luck!  The artifact is still within reach.

==Completion==
Good.  We know where we must go to acquire the artifact.

==Notes==
Speak with Nisha:
