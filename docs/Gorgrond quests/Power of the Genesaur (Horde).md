==Objectives==
Speak with {{Au|Durotan}} at [[Beastwatch]] in [[Gorgrond]].

==Description==
Commander, you now have the Will of the Genesaur along with the genesis water and enough seeds to grow an army. Not to mention the Laughing Skulls you helped save.

I would call this mission a success.

I will investigate this fortress further and see if there are more materials we might glean from it.

In the meantime, you may want to bring these artifacts you have obtained to Durotan back at the outpost. I will catch up once we have finished here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well done, Commander. Many of the orcs have tried to master the power of the [[genesaur]] but I have never heard of any succeeding.

You have won us a powerful weapon for the next time we face the [[Iron Horde]].

==Notes==
Pick up [[Kaz the Shrieker (quest)]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill}}
