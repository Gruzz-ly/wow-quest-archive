==Objectives==
Kill 12 defenders at Dionor's Demise.
*Dionor defenders slain (12)

==Description==
There may be more to this aberrant growth than it seems, but we will need to clear the way a bit before we can get to the bottom of this, yes?

I suggest clearing out some of the angrier defenders to be on the safe side.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 528 belts|Steamburst Waistwrap|Overgrowth Cutter Girdle|Wildwood Wrangler Links|Foundry-Fired Plate Waistguard}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*18900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes the pruning <class>?

==Completion==
I have slain quite a few as well but they continue to spring up here.

We will need another solution...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ambassador to the Ancient (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Then enter the forested area and start killing [[botani]] and [[tentacle]]s.

At the southern end of the forested area, find a pile of [[Hardened Thornvine]], which can be shredded by players who chose the Lumber Mill to find an [[Aged Stone Container]].

At the northern end of the quest area, [[Char the Burning]], a rare [[Draenor ancient]], has been set alight by some [[Grom'kar Pyro]]s. Loot Char's corpse for [[Char's Smoldering Fist]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]]. Additionally, to the northwest, elite [[steam elemental]] [[Erosian the Violent]] is found. An objective of [[Gorgrond Monster Hunter]], Erosian drops [[Crystalized Steam]], which starts [[Trophy of Glory: Erosian]].

[[Altauur]] has moved from his previous spot to a small cave a hundred or so yards west of [[Birchus]], halfway up the hill.
