==Objectives==
Slay 7 goren in [[Moira's Reach]].
*Goren Breachers slain (7)

==Description==
Dwarves are dumb. Don't they know that if you dig a deep hole you are going to have [[goren]] attack?

If you are going to go into that iron fort you better kill a bunch of goren otherwise they are going to chew the walls enough to cause a cave-in.

I would do it myself but I'm still stuffed from all that fruit the botani made me eat.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 536 weapons|Abandoned Dark Iron Handaxe|Abandoned Dark Iron Skullthumper|Abandoned Dark Iron Cudgel|Abandoned Dark Iron Greataxe|Abandoned Dark Iron Longbow|Abandoned Dark Iron Lockjammer|Abandoned Dark Iron Glaive|Abandoned Dark Iron Staff}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Goren like to chew things. I HATE THAT!

==Completion==
Goren, goren, gone!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Will of the Genesaur (Horde)]] and [[Doomshot (quest)]] before heading out.

Kill anything that moves. Doomshot is rather large-caliber rounds strewn all over the ground. Head to the back (southward) and to the lower level.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill}}
