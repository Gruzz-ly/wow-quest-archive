==Objectives==
Use a Burning Log to cauterize [[Nisha (dread raven)|Nisha]]'s wounds.
*[[Burning Log]] {{co|44.4|61.3|Gorgrond}}
*Nisha's wounds cauterized {{co|44.2|61.6|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
You have saved my most precious companion, Nisha. I owe you a great debt.

The Iron Horde lured me away to separate us. I shall not make the same mistake again.

They have inflicted grievous wounds, and I fear we must cause her even more pain before the healing process can begin.

Please use a burning log from the nearby fire to cauterize her wounds.

I will hold her down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nisha must make it through this.

==Completion==
Thank you. Her wounds have closed.

==Notes==
Step a few yards to the northeast and interact with the Iron Horde Bonfire to pick up a Burning Log, then interact with Misha to cauterize her wounds:
