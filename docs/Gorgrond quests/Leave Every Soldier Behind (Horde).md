==Objectives==
Find Corporal Thukmar and recover his intel.
*[[Corporal Thukmar]] found {{co|44.9|86.1|Fissure of Fury|1}}
*[[Thukmar's Intel]] {{co|44.9|86.1|Fissure of Fury|1}}

==Description==
Hmmm.

The [[ogron]] possess something of value to the [[Iron Horde]]. I'm sure they're unaware, likely just bored and in need of something to torture.

I'd be inclined to just let them be, it's a fate they deserve. But we can't afford not to follow up on this clue. With any luck, it will help us stop the Iron Horde from turning Gorgrond's most fearsome creatures into weapons.

Try to find this Corporal Thukmar and his notes. We'll meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Again you've done well, friend.

==Completion==
We have the notes. Let us see what they reveal about our enemy's strategy.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fair Warning]] before heading out.

Speak with Nisha to take a flight directly to the [[Fissure of Fury]]. Start killing a path down to the lower level of the Fissure of Fury. There, [[Corporal Thukmar]] has not survived the experience with his mental faculties intact:
:Kill... eat... torn to pieces... ate... alive... they took us... DIE... kill... me... kill me... KILL ME... please...
:{{gossip|Put the corporal out of his misery.}}
Loot the Thukmar's Research book next to his corpse to acquire [[Thukmar's Intel]], which reads:
{{book|Thukmar's Intel|content=This is magnificent!

I have unearthed an artifact of unknown origin. Touching it instantly floods my mind with a vision of every [[magnaron]], [[gronn]] and the like that walks [[Gorgrond]].

What's more, I am overcome with a sense that each of these creatures are an appendage to me. I have found myself able to commune with them and even shape their thoughts.

I am returning to the [[Blackrock Foundry|foundry]] to inform Blackhand directly. This discovery will hasten our purging of Draenor, and many more worlds to come!}}
Keep circling clockwise to the north to find [[Borogahn]]:
:{{text|say|Borogahn|New plaything!}}

After killing Borogahn, but before taking the Goren Tunnel a dozen yards away from Borogahn, head to the northwest end of the cave to find [[Gelgor of the Blue Flame]]. Additionally, there is a pile of [[Hardened Thornvine]] in Gelgor's room, and an [[Odd Boulder]] in the room to the northeast. Beyond that, there is a [[Horned Skull]] in the center room of the lower level. Once both quest objectives are complete, the [[Goren Tunnel]] lights up with a quest to escape the area, [[A Great Escape]]. Pick it up and click on the tunnel to get out of the cave. On the surface:
:{{text|say|Rexxar|Well done, friend. It is rare for one to emerge from that cave alive.}}
