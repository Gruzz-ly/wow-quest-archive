==Objectives==
Burn 5 Ancient Seedbearer corpses.
*[[Ancient Seedbearer]] burned x5
*[[Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
When these seedbearers are slain their seeds survive. From them spring new seedbringers, not over years, but hours.

Leaving their remains here would soon cause the outpost to be overrun.

We have learned that burning their remains prevents this from happening.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
* 14100 XP

==Progress==
These creatures employ unusual tactics.

==Completion==
The ancients should not be a problem for your outpost for some time.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Harsh Reminder (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Kill [[gronnling]]s and burn dead [[Draenor ancient]]s. Once done with both, find Erdanii stealthed on a rock in the middle of the quest area.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Sparring Arena}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
