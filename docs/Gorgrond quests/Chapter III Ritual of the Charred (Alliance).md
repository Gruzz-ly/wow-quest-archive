==Objectives==
Kill 4 [[Draenor ancient|Ancients]].
*Ancient slain (4)

==Description==
I have seen a strange ritual performed by ancients. They step into fire, burning the leaves from their branches and charring their bark.

I call it the Ritual of the Charred. If we want to weaken the ancients, we can get rid of them before they become even stronger.

- Frenna

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|30}}
*13970 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's this about a ritual?

==Completion==
Those ancients are crazy! Hard to believe they'd burn off their own leaves.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Chapter I: Plant Food (Alliance)]] and [[Chapter II: The Harvest (Alliance)]]  before heading out.

In the greater Tangleheart area, focus on killing [[Draenor ancient]]s until the requisite four are dead, then shift over to [[botani]] to get the last of the [[Ancient Growth Sap]]. [[Ontogen the Harvester]] is in the western lake, and Pollen Pods are all over the area.

In the northeastern extent of Tangleheart, find [[Glirin]] still pointing his [[crossbow]] at [[Glyza]], who is working on the Dark Iron mole machine.
:{{text|say|Glirin|Put yer back into it. There ya go!}}

''On complete of all four'':
:{{text|say|Glirin|Commander, feel free to use the mole machine to return to yer outpost. I'll get ya there. Perhaps.}}
