==Objectives==
Collect 4 Doomshot.
*[[Doomshot (quest item)]] (4)

==Description==
This ominously large explosive appears to be ammunition for the primary cannon that the Bastion is built around.

The loading assembly must be on a lower floor, but this ammo did not make it that far.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|50}}
*14240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This loader can take a number of rounds of doomshot at a time.

==Completion==
The rounds of doomshot fit into the weapon loader with ease.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Will of the Genesaur (Horde)]] and [[Down the Goren Hole (Horde)]] before heading out.

Kill anything that moves. Doomshot is rather large-caliber rounds strewn all over the ground. Head to the back (southward) and to the lower level.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill}}
