== Objectives ==
Find [[Gladiator Akaani]] near [[Stonemaul Arena]] in [[Gorgrond]].

== Description ==
This Sparring Arena is a good start, but we will need trainers to help mold your forces into worthy fighters.

There has been a reported spotting of a draenei to the west who matches the description of Akaani.

This is interesting, as we all believed her dead. She was one of the finest warriors the draenei have ever fielded and a master of nearly any weapon forged or found.

Commander, you could not ask for a more skilled trainer. I advise seeking her out, if it is really her...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|89}}

== Progress ==
''On approach''
:{{text|say|Gladiator Akaani|Hold your arms, brothers. I do not believe this one serves the ogres.}}

== Completion ==
You do not have the look of a Stonemaul bounty hunter.

We escaped the clutches of their vile arena but at a heavy cost. We were forced to leave too many allies behind and too many ogres breathing.

We could use a fresh face, one that is unknown to the ogres.

== Gains ==
* 1410 XP

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Rage and Wisdom (Alliance)]] before heading out. Hold off on this quest for a bit, and work on the Rage and Wisdom chain first.

After meeting a rather notable Horde NPC in the [[Sulfur Basin]], sneak off to the southwest to find [[Gladiator Akaani]], [[Kash'drakor (alternate universe)|Kash'drakor]], and [[Beatface]].

;Upon talking to Kash'drakor
:We did not expect to find any friendly faces out here in this wasteland. We have survived only by sticking together and relying on one another to get this far.

:Our escape attempt was only half executed though. Kor'gall got wind of our plan before we could assassinate him and take his axe.
