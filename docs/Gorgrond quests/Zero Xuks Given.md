==Objectives==
Speak with Bony Xuk to observe him communing with [[Gro the Uncreator]].
*Speak to [[Bony Xuk]]

==Description==
The spirits have spoken to me. They believe the [[magnaron]], Gro the Uncreator, will join our fight and lead his underlings against the [[Iron Horde]].

This is an honor beyond any bestowed upon a Laughing Skull, at least in my time.

I will commune with the magnaron, and together we shall destroy the Iron Horde.

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The spirits of my ancestors have betrayed me! Their skulls are surely laughing.

==Notes==
{{Dialogue
|Never before have the spirits spoken with such strength to me.

{{Gossip|You may commune with Gro the Uncreator.}}}}

Once given the go, Xuk goes to commune with the magnaron in a cutscene.

:{{text|bossemote|Bony Xuk: Gro the Uncreator, I call to you!}}

Gro starts walking towards Xuk.

:{{text|bossemote|Bony Xuk: The spirits of the Laughing Skull have spoken. We must join together against the common enemy, the Iron Horde!}}

Gro stops next to Xuk and roars.

:{{text|bossemote|Bony Xuk: Yes! It's working! The spirits were right!}}

Gro smashes down on Xuk, leaving nothing but a skeleton and a puddle of blood.

:{{text|bossemote|Bony Xuk: Xuk...}}

Gro walks away. Moments later, Bony Xuk's mask lands next to his corpse.
