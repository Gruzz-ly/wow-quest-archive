==Description==
It is done.

With this enchantment, not only can you roam amongst the [[goren]] freely, but you can move as they do.

Your travels through the canyon are now made easier. You have safe access to places otherwise impossible to reach.

Perhaps these tunnels will lead to more information that could be used against the [[Iron Horde]].

*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That goren disguise smells awful.

==Completion==
Your search brought rewards?

==Notes==
Use the quest item then head east to some cracked ground as the tunnel passes through northwest to Drywind Gorge. There, three [[Boneyard Gorger]]s are consuming a [[Bluff Rylak]]:
:{{text|emote|The goren mumbles something incomprehensible to you.}}
When in Rome, do as the Romans do and consume the rylak.
Immediately to the north, find a [[Suntouched Spear]]. Loot it for...

Get back up on top and click the tunnel beneath the rylak to head north through the [[Valley of Destruction]] to reach a level 102 elite magnaron, [[Drov the Ruiner]]. Quickly hop back in the tunnel, which comes out at [[Brak's Excavation]]. There, a dead [[Grom'kar Messenger]] lies on the ground. Check the corpse for a [[Grom'kar Dispatch]].

Before leaving the cave, check the east wall to find an [[Iron Supply Chest]], which contains ..., then roll to the southwest past the Grom'kar Messengera few yards to take the tunnel back.
