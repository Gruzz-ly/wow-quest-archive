==Objectives==
Kill 6 Fungus Covered Shamblers.
*[[Fungus Covered Shambler]] slain (6)

==Description==
The dead ones were the strong ones it seems. The weak ones wander about killing invaders to this marsh.

It feels... wrong... to kill them, but they are worthless and get in our way. Kill these shambling fools so we can move further into the marsh easily.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 530 gloves|Overgrowth Cutter Gloves|Foundry-Fired Plate Gauntlets|Steamburst Gloves|Wildwood Wrangler Gauntlets}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You take too long. Something calls to us deeper in there. Whatever it is, I will have its skull or die trying.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Secret of the Fungus (Horde)]] before heading out.

Plenty of fungus-covered shamblers (both orc and draenei) and orange-capped mushrooms in the area.

==Progression==
