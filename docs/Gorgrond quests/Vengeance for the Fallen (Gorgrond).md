==Objectives==
[[File:Fungal Lurcher.jpg|thumb|Fungal Lurcher.]]
Kill 10 Fungal Lurchers.
*[[Fungal Lurcher]] slain (10)

==Description==
I... almost made it out. Most of us... dead. The others... they are no longer themselves.

These lurching spore beasts are the cause, dragging us further into the marsh... stop them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you avenged us?

==Completion==
Thank you for avenging my fallen friends. We will get to the bottom of this I swear!

==Notes==
In the [[Crimson Fen]] for [[Scout Forensics]], find the [[Dying Rangari]] on the path near the north end of the fen. He starts this quest. Kill a [[Fungal Lurcher]] and it will drop a [[Glowing Red Pod]], which starts [[Mysterious Pod (Alliance)]].
