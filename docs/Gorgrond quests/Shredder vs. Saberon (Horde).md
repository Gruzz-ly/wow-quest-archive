==Objectives==
Break the vine barrier using your shredder.
*Shred the vine barrier and enter the saberon camp {{co|52.2|48.6|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
After the [[saberon]] stole from these plants, they were forced further up [[Steamscar Rise]] and barricaded themselves in. I could not find a way to get in but you have the solution.

One path is blocked by a tangle of hard vines. I have heard you have a machine that could cut through that with ease.

I would get on a shredder and take those vines down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good work, but we need to move quickly before the plants realize the way is open...

==Notes==
Exit the cave, turn north and loop clockwise to the south and head uphill. At the north end of camp is a pile of [[Hardened Thornvine]]. This one contains ... From the north end, head south to find the Strong Vine Barricade. Interact with the vines to quickly hop on the shredder and shred the vines as Rakthoth stealths on by.

==Progression==
