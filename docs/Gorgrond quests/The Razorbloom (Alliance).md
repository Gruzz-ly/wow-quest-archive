==Objectives==
Find clues to the whereabouts of Lera Ashtoes, Nori Sootstache, and Razzlebeard.
*Find [[Lera Ashtoes]] {{co|47.4|73.4|Gorgrond}} 
*Find [[Nori Sootstash]] {{co|48.1|73.6|Gorgrond}}
*Find [[Razzlebeard]]

==Description==
[[Rangari Kaalya|Kaalya]] thinks she picked up a trail. Seems a bunch of dwarves went north to [[Razorbloom]] by the signs.

Problem is that place is filled with plant people. I ain't much use against plant people.

Are you willing to investigate?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 525 belts|Foundry-Fired Plate Girdle|Steamburst Cord|Wildwood Wrangler Belt|Overgrowth Cutter Belt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Curse them [[botani]] and their ilk.

==Completion==
The plant people fattened up my friends with fruit an' honey an' mead.  Seems they were fattenin' them up for sure.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Infested (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Northeast past the flight path (which got picked up, right?) into the [[Razorbloom]]. Start killing [[Infested Orc]]s and [[Infested Behemoth]]s. The three named dwarves are marked on the minimap on the edge of the central pond, but [[Razzlebeard]] holds [[Razzlebeard's Report]] in his left hand, which concludes the quest.

==Progression==
{{In the Land of Giants - Lumber Mill Alliance}}
