==Objectives==
[[File:Drained Fungal Heart.jpg|thumb|Drained Fungal Heart]]
Investigate the strange presence in the Crimson Fen.
*Strange Fungus Site inspected {{co|58.9|62.6|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
I can feel a powerful presence in the marsh <name>, it is not far from here.

Go see what is there while I finish my grim feast. I will catch up...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That is unfortunate... I had hoped... Still we are closer now, we are on the right track to finishing this.

None too soon either, the screaming beasts are really getting to me...

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Grim Harvest (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Head southeast and find the [[Drained Fungal Heart]] in the center of a bigger island. Interact with it and Khaano will run up:
:{{text|say|Khaano|This is it... this is it!}}
:{{text|say|Khaano|Dead... or used up. I was so sure I would find what I needed here!}}
:{{text|say|Khaano|Wait, I feel it. It is closer now. Quickly! To me!}}

West of Khaano's new position, find a rare elite fungal giant [[Fungal Praetorian]]. It drops a [[Precious Mushroom]], which starts [[Trophy of Glory: Fungal Praetorian (Alliance)]].

If you cannot interact with the Drained Fungal Heart, relogging should fix it.
