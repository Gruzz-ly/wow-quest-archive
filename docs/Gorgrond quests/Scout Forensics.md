==Objectives==
Collect 5 Rangari Pouches from dead {{Au|Rangari}}.
*[[Rangari Pouch]] (5)

==Description==
My entire squad is gone. Some are dead; that much is obvious. The others though... they must be further in.

Go and search the bodies of my squad that you find, each will carry a small pouch of personal items. I would like to return these to their families.

I will go ahead and meet you inside the marsh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|60}}
*15800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The families of my squad need closure and we need more information on their deaths.

==Completion==
Thank you for doing this <name>. Hopefully they can be cleaned of these foul spores that coat everything here.

==Notes==
Head south into the [[Crimson Fen]]. Just inside the quest area, look for a [[Dying Rangari]], who starts [[Vengeance for the Fallen (Gorgrond)]]. Pick it up and kill a [[Fungal Lurcher]], which will drop a [[Glowing Red Pod]]. That pod starts [[Mysterious Pod (Alliance)]].
