==Objectives==
Use the Laughing Skull elixir to find [[Skulltaker]] and claim [[the Silent Skull]].
*Brew the Laughing Skull Elixir
*Drink the elixir and find a way to reach Skulltaker
*The Silent Skull

==Description==
With the reagents found, you should seek out [[Grinning Tolg]]'s camp in the nearby cave to brew the elixir. Once the elixir is consumed, you should be able to communicate with the [[ravager]]s there. With any luck, they should be able to bring you to Skulltaker. His mask should bring a hefty reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|150||22}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This must be the cursed skull. Are you sure we should be touching it?

==Completion==
This definitely looks like no [[Laughing Skull Orcs|Laughing Skull]] mask I've seen before. I'll take it to [[Harrison Jones|Jones]] and see what he makes of it. 

He left me with this payment for you.

==Progression==
