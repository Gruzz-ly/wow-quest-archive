==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Harvester Ommru.jpg|Harvester Ommru|He is a weapon of the genesaur, Iyu.}}
Slay Harvester Ommru.
*[[Harvester Ommru]] slain {{co|63.2|46.7|Gorgrond}}

==Description==
This is what happens when one stands in the path of a [[genesaur]]. And where a genesaur walks, the [[botani]] follow.

I saw one entering our shelter cave along the northern side of the camp.

It is commanding the [[podling]]s to gather the corpses of our fallen brethren and must be stopped.

I must tend to our wounded, and gather supplies for our departure.

If you are serious about being a hero, venture into the cave and slay this botani.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|90}}
*21150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ah, still alive?

==Completion==
I dread to think what the botani had intended to do with the corpses of our fallen.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Wake of the Genesaur]] before heading out.

Kill a path to the northeast and note a tentacle of [[Aggressive Growth]] flinging [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] about. Kill the growth and pick up [[I Drew Aggro...culture]] from him. Head west-northwest and enter the [[Rangari Hollow]] to find [[Harvester Ommru]] with a few [[Podling Scavenger]]s. 

On engaging Ommru:

{{text|say|Harvester Ommru|I have known weeds that were more threatening than your kind.}}

Finish him off, then head back to where the genesaur attacked the siege tank on the road to turn in.

: ''[[Maraad]] and [[Yrel]] have come across [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] busy with the siege tank, along with Kaalya and D'kaan.  Yrel is surprised to see the dwarf.''
: {{text|say|Yrel|Thaelin?  What are you doing here?}}
: {{text|say|Rangari Kaalya|Giving away our position.  The fool brought a genesaur down on us.}}
