This quest is part of a {{questchain|A Fishy Peril|quest chain}} of the same name.

==Objectives==
[[Remy "Two Times"]] wants you to speak with [[Marshal Dughan]] in [[Goldshire]].

==Description==
<Name>, there's a new threat in [[Elwynn Forest]]!  [[Murloc]]s are swimming up the streams of eastern Elwynn, scaring away fish and attacking gentle folk!

I warned Marshal Dughan, but he's more worried about the [[gnoll]]s and the bandits.  He's not convinced that the murlocs are a danger.

Please, <name>, speak to Dughan and persuade him to send more troops to the east!

==Completion==
Yes, I spoke with [[Remy "Two Times"|Remy]]. I respect him as a merchant, though all reports of Murlocs to the east have been sketchy at best.

Your concerns are noted, but unless I receive a military report of a murloc threat, we can't afford to send more troops east.
