==Description==
;Newcomers
:You smell that funny odor too? Smells like smoke, cheap cologne, and alchemical nonsense. You ask me, I think the Crown Chemical Co. is up to something. Want to help me get to the bottom of it?
:Well, take a look at my pal here. Sure, he looks like a pooch, but this is O.D.I.E.! The Olfactory Detection and Inspection Engine! With this little fella, you and I can sniff out whatever the Crown is plotting from a mile away!
:Are you in? I could use a good partner to solve this.
;Returners
:<Name>! Boy am I glad to see you.
:Listen <name>, we may have gotten rid of the Crown Chemical Co., but I got a bad feeling we haven't seen the last of them.
:Well, take a look at my pal here. Sure, he looks like a pooch, but this is O.D.I.E.! The Olfactory Detection and Inspection Engine! With this little fella, you and I can sniff out whatever the Crown is plotting from a mile away!
:What do you say, partners again?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
Sure, O.D.I.E. can sniff out the clues, but you still gotta piece 'em together.

==Completion==
;Newcomers
:Poisonous perfumes? Revenge for kicking 'em out of the city?
:Seems like Apothecary Hummel is cooking up something sinister. This could get ugly.
;Returners
:Poisonous perfumes? Revenge for kicking 'em out of the city?
:Seems like Apothecary Hummel is cooking up something sinister again. But deadly poisons? Sheesh, this could get ugly.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Oh hi there, pal. You busy? I could use a little assistance with a... sticky situation.}}

On accept, Snip and O.D.I.E. join the player and will follow them around.
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|O.D.I.E. can sniff out anything, just use that remote control of his!}}
:{{Text|say|O.D.I.E.|Ark ark!}}

Try using [[O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control]] outside the [[Trade District]]:
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|No clues here, pal. Maybe we could try the Trade District?}}

Try using [[O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control]] on the walls, towers or rooftops of the city:
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Let's not use that here, O.D.I.E.'s scared of heights.}}

Leaving the correct area: <!-- I think that was the trigger? -->
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Wait, it ain't working? Must be the wind over here. Let's head somewhere else!}}

;Near clue
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Here we go, this looks promising. Let's try out O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control here.}}
;Activating [[O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control]] with a nearby clue
*{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|We're on the move!}}
*{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Aha! Good old O.D.I.E.--I knew he could find us a trail!}}
*{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Follow that scent!}}
;Activating O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control with no nearby clue before you have found all clues in the Trade District
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Everything's on the up and up around here. Let's search somewhere else.}}
;Activating O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control with all clues were found in the Trade District
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Nothing, not even a whiff. How about we try the Dwarven District next?}}
;Activating O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control when transformed (Druid shapeshift, Demon hunter Metamorphosis...)
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|You're pretty good at using that device while looking like that!}}
;Activating O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control when quest complete
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|That device sure is fun to play with, huh? We've got everything we came for and you're still pushing its buttons.}}
;Picking up [[Map of Shadowfang Keep Security]]
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|A clue! Huh, they're in Shadowfang Keep?}}
:{{text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|You'da thought they'd have the sense to re-locate by now.}}
;Picking up [[Discarded Perfume Bottle]]
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Gwah! There must have still been some perfume in that bottle. Nice of ya to pick it up before someone else gets poisoned. That wasn't a clue, but at least we know the Crown's been through here.}}
;Picking up [[Formula: Intoxicating Toxic Perfume]]
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Those absent-minded alchemists dropped their formula! Grindin' gadgets <name>, they're gonna try to eliminate us all with their artificial aromas!}}
;Examining [[:Crown Chemical Co. Supplies]]
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Yowza, what a stench! Thanks for taking the hit, pal. That wasn't a clue, but at least we know the Crown's been through here.}}
;Picking up [[Memo from Apothecary Hummel]]
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Great find, pal! This should be all the clues we need. Take a closer look at that memo and see what you can figure out.}}
When [[O.D.I.E.]] finds a clue
:{{Text|say|O.D.I.E|Ark, ark!}}

During the quest, Snip has new gossip for newcomers:
{{book|content=
{{Gossip|Who are the Crown Chemical Co.?}}

Never heard of the Crown? You're lucky, pal.

Back before we had this gala, the Crown would come by every year peddling their wares. It was all artificial nonsense--perfumes and colognes that reeked of factory production and corporate greed.

That was before we found out their smells were literally making people sick! Some friends and I did some digging, and we took the fight to their boss, Apothecary Hummel. I thought we got rid of him for good, but it looks like I was wrong.

Not only is he back, but he's not exactly happy about what we did to shut his operation down. We gotta stop whatever it is he's up to!

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}

Completing this quest also gives [[Memo from Apothecary Hummel (poor)]].
