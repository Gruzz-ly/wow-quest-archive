Guard Thomas wants you to travel north up the river and search for the two lost guards, [[Footman Rolf Hartford|Rolf]] and [[Footman Malakai Stone|Malakai]].

==Description==
A few days ago we sent two Guards, Rolf and Malakai, to investigate along the river, and they have not yet returned. To complete my report, I must know what happened to those men.

Travel north along the river and find the guards... or their remains.

You will receive:
*210 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at level 70)
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Stormwind}}

==Completion==
Although much has been stripped from the corpse, strewn nearby is a medallion with the words: "Footman Malakai Stone" etched upon it.
