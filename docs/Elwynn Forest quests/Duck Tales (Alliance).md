==Objectives==
Use the potion to get information from 5 [[duck]]s.
*Potion used
*Information gathered (5)
*[[Duck Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
Take this potion, <name>. You should be able to communicate with your feathery friends with it.

But don't blame me for any unintended side effects you may experience.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Brightly Colored Egg]]

==Progress==
Go on now, have a chat with those ducks!

==Completion==
What? Some of the ducks are [[druid]]s?

They won't get away with their interference.

==Notes==
[[File:Duck Potion.jpg|thumb|upright|A ducking good disguise]]

Upon accept, Emmery and his portal to Stormwind disappear. Use the potion to transform with the Duck Disguise, then use the ducking good disguise to interact with [[Furious Duck]]s in the area. Disguised ducks will give credit for the quest and respond with one of:
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|Quick, go steal those eggs for [[Daetan Swiftplume|Daetan]]!}}
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|Hey, don't blow my cover!}}
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|How did you--did Daetan send you?}}

Actual ducks will respond with:
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|The duck gives you a quizzical look.}}
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|Quack?}}

==Progression==
{{What the Duck}}

==Patch changes==
