==Objectives==
Follow the trail of [[Varok Saurfang]] in [[Elwynn Forest]].
* Investigate the area
* [[Old Lock|Lock]] inspected
* [[Loose Mud|Continue searching]]
* Follow [[Muddy Tracks|muddy tracks]]
* [[SI:7 Agent]]s slain (3)

==Description==
Keep your head down. We do not want to be seen out here.

Our [[spies]] keep watch over [[Stormwind]] day and night, and saw no signs of Saurfang. 

Nor did we notice any oddly-oversized [[cart]]s or strange [[ship]]s in the night, if that was what you were thinking.

How then, did he make his escape?

Let's look around.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let us keep investigating.

==Completion==
[[SI:7]] lurking around Stormwind? Hmm, probably after the same thing we are.

We need to keep moving.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|Let's keep moving. Be on the lookout for anything suspicious.}}

Arrive at [[Mirror Lake]] at {{Coords|28|61|Elwynn Forest}}.
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|A sewer exit. Outside the city, away from prying eyes. Let's take a look at that lock.}}

Investigate the [[Old Lock]].
{{Book|content=
This lock is old and heavily rusted.

Scrape marks and flecks of loose rust are present around the keyhole and moving parts.

It has been recently used.
}}
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|Seems we have found his escape route. Hmm, there is mud around the lake. We should check for tracks.}}

Continue along the lake to locate [[Loose Mud]] at {{Coords|33|64|Elwynn Forest}}. [[Lake Crocolisk]]s and [[Gutgnash]] are present.
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|The mud has been disturbed. Someone tried to disguise their route amongst the reeds. Let's keep moving.}}

Continue into the forest to locate [[Muddy Tracks]] at {{Coords|34|63|Elwynn Forest}}.
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|Heavy footprints. Too large for a human. It has to be Saurfang. His trail leads east...}}

Three SI:7 agents appear.
:{{Text|say|[[SI:7 Agent]]|Well, well... what do we have here?}}
:{{Text|say|SI:7 Agent|Seems a couple of [[Hordies]] got lost. VERY lost.}}
:{{Text|say|SI:7 Agent|Does that area look brown and filthy to you, Hordies?}}
:{{Text|say|SI:7 Agent|Sure seems green to me. Not like Horde lands at all.}}
:{{Text|say|SI:7 Agent|Let's send them back on their way then, shall we?}}
:{{Text|say|SI:7 Agent|My daggers can point 'em in the right direction!}}

And they attack the hero and Lyana. After they are killed, the quest is completed.

:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|Fools.}}
