==Objectives==
Consume treat packages from [[vendor]]s at the [[Gala of Gifts]].
* Treat package purchased (Optional)
* Treats consumed (5)

==Description==
A full belly is a happy belly!

There is plenty of good food and drink right here at the gala. Why don't you buy yourself something nice?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
Have you had your fill of treats? I love the fruits, myself.

==Completion==
On any other day, you do great deeds for others.

Today you have done something great for yourself. And that is the best gift of all.

==Notes==
Purchase any food package from the marked vendors in the area, then consume it fully, letting the Food buff run out to gain five stacks of Self-Love buff and earn quest credit.

Purchase a [[Comfort Food Package]]:
:{{text|say|[[Guo Plumpaw]]/[[Ming Plumpaw]]|Have you had a tough day? These simple but delectable salty snacks will help you feel better!}}
Purchase a [[Healthy Body Package]] from [[Ronathan Graham]]/[[Grogg Skullsmasher]]:
:{{text|say|[[Gala Attendee]]/[[Yorgrim Rocktooth]]|Ooh, does that have mangoes? I love mangoes! Give me one of what <she/he>'s having!}}
Purchase a [[Me, Myself, and Chocolate Package]]:
:{{Alliance}}{{text|say|[[Maurice Guichi]]|These chocolates have a wonderful flavor. I think someone of your taste will particularly appreciate the ganache.}}
:{{Horde}}{{Text|say|[[Zin'boja]]|I tink you gonna like these chocolate truffles!}}

Upon eating the food, nearby NPCs will react:
*{{text|say|Ooh, maybe I should get some of that too. I deserve it!}}
*{{text|say|That looks good! Can I have some?}}
*{{Text|say|Now there's someone who knows how to treat themselves right.}}
