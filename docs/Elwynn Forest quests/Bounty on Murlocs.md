== Objectives ==
Bring 8 [[Torn Murloc Fin]]s to [[Guard Thomas]] at the east Elwynn bridge.
* [[Torn Murloc Fin]] (8)

== Description ==
The [[Stormwind Army]] has placed a bounty on [[murloc]] lurkers and foragers in Elwynn.  Slaughter them and bring Guard Thomas their torn murloc fins, and the Stormwind Army will reward you well.

The murlocs have built a village at [[Stone Cairn Lake]] north of here, and another to the south where the stream forks.

}}

You will also receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
How goes the hunting, <name>?

== Completion ==
You have the fins?  Great!  [[Marshal Dughan]] is anxious about the Murloc situation in eastern Elwynn, and I'd like to tell him that it's becoming under control.

Your actions have helped realize that. 

==Notes==
Murlocs dropping [[Torn Murloc Fin]]s can be found at the lakes north and south of the quest giver.

*{{Patch 7.3.5|note=[[Solid Wooden Club]] and [[Field Tested Spear]] added as rewards.}}
