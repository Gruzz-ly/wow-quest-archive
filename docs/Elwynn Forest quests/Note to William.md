==Objectives==
Take Gramma Stonefield's Note to [[William Pestle]].
*[[Gramma Stonefield's Note]] (provided)

==Description==
I bet William Pestle has a potion to unite our two young lovers!

Here, take this note to William. He's staying at the [[Lion's Pride Inn]] in [[Goldshire]].

==Progress==
You have a note from "Gramma" Stonefield, eh?  I haven't seen Mildred in years!  I wonder what she has to say...

==Completion==
My heart goes out to those two poor souls, Maybell and Tommy Joe.  I remember being young and in love, once.

There must be something I can do to help them!  Let me think...
