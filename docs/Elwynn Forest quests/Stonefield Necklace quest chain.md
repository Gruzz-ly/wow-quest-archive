[[Bernice Stonefield]] has lost a necklace, and she wants you to help her retrieve it.

== The Stonefield Necklace ==
;[[Lost Necklace]]
[["Auntie" Bernice Stonefield]], a local widow, has lost her necklace, and thinks [[Billy Maclure|a neighbor child]] has taken it.

;[[Pie for Billy]]
You question Billy about the necklace, but he demands a pork pie before he is willing to tell you anything.

;[[Back to Billy]]
You kill a few of the local wild pigs and take the meat back to Bernice.  She isn't happy about it, but wants her necklace back more.  She bakes the pie and you take it back to Billy.

;[[Goldtooth (quest)]]
Billy still doesn't admit wrongdoing, but he's got the pie he wanted.  [[Goldtooth]], a local [[Kobold]], grabbed it up (from where Billy had dropped it) and took it into the [[Fargodeep Mine]] with him.

Goldtooth and the kobold miners aren't happy to see you there, and you have to slay Goldtooth to recover the necklace.

Mrs Stonefield gives you a pair of gloves that were her husband's in thanks.
