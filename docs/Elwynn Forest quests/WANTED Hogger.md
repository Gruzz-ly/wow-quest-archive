'''WANTED: "Hogger"''' begins when a [[Wanted Poster]] is read just outside of [[Westbrook Garrison]]. As Hogger is an [[elite]] monster, defeating him may require the help of another player.

==Objectives==
Deal with "[[Hogger|The Hogger Situation]]" and return to [[Marshal Dughan]].
* Dealt with "The Hogger Situation"

==Description==
Wanted: [[Hogger]]

A huge [[gnoll]], Hogger, is prowling the woods in southwestern [[Elwynn Forest|Elwynn]]. He has overpowered all attempts at his capture.

The [[Stormwind Army]] has placed a generous bounty on the Gnoll. To earn the reward, bounty hunters should venture into the woods and deal with the beast.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Footman Tunic
|Stormwind Guard Leggings
|Balanced Spell Staff
|Lion Guard Chainmail
}}

You will also receive:
* 450 - 1,200 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Yes, Hogger has been a real pain for me and my men. &nbsp;You have something to report about the beast?

==Completion==
He did WHAT?

Great, now we have a bloodthirsty beast right beneath the streets of Stormwind, with a whole army of gnolls at his command. &nbsp;Definitely an improvement, I feel safer already.

Here's your reward, <name>. &nbsp;But promise me you'll check in with the [[Stockades]] guards in Stormwind at some point, just to ensure that things are going smoothly.

==Notes==
[[Hogger]] is located on [[Hogger Hill]] at the southern end of [[Forest's Edge]], past several camps of [[Riverpaw pack|Riverpaw gnolls]].
