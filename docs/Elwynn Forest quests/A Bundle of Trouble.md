== Objectives ==
Bring 8 Bundles of Wood to Raelen at the [[Eastvale Logging Camp]].
*[[Bundle of Wood]] (8)

== Description ==
I've got a real problem on my hands.  I have a deadline looming for an order of lumber, and I'm running out of time.  The wolves and bears north of here have chased my workers away from the bundles of wood that they've already chopped.

I've already talked to [[Deputy Rainer]] about clearing the animals, but I need someone to go collect the wood for me.  If you could collect eight bundles of wood for me I might just make my deadline.

== Progress ==
That deadline isn't getting any further away, <class>.  Please hurry and collect those bundles of wood.

== Completion ==
Excellent!  Thanks to you, I should be able to complete the order in time.  To show my gratitude, I would like to offer some coin as compensation for your troubles.

Thank you and farewell.

== Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*775 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|80}} at level 70)

== Notes ==
Raelen says that she spoke to Deputy Rainer about the animals, which is strange seeing that he is on the opposite side of the zone at [[Westbrook Garrison]].
