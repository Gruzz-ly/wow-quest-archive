== Objectives ==
Report to [[Marshal McBride]] in front of [[Northshire Abbey]] in [[Elwynn Forest]].

== Description ==
Excellent work, <name>! The rear is now officially clear. We'll take care of the stragglers. I want you to go back to Marshal McBride, standing in front of Northshire Abbey, south of here, and let him know that the goblin situation is under control.

Farewell, <class>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{coppercost|7}} (or {{coppercost|30}} at max level)

== Completion ==
With your help we have managed to secure the northern and western sectors of Northshire. We still have a rather large contingency of [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] orcs to the east and they've begun burning down the forest!
