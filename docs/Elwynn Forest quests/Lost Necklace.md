This quest starts the [[Stonefield Necklace quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Billy Maclure]]. 

==Description==
I lost my necklace, and think that guttersnipe [[Billy Maclure]] took it! He's usually scuttling like a rat around the [[Maclure Vineyards]] east of here.

Get my necklace back for me, and you'll warm an old widow's heart.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*135 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||90}} at level 70)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
You lost a what?  Well I didn't take no necklace, because I ain't no thief!

I might know who did but...<grin>...I'm too hungry to remember.
