In this quest you must bring some [[Refreshing Spring Water]] to [[Gerard Tiller]]. This quest is repeatable.

==Objectives==
Farming is thirsty work, and I'm always looking for refreshing spring water.

If you have any, then I'm willing to make a trade.
*[[Refreshing Spring Water]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1 [[Shiny Red Apple]]

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>! &nbsp;And come back if you want to trade again.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.5|note=Available once again with the exploit fixed.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Players were abusing its 30k guild experience reward (all quests reward this much) for quick guild leveling. Became unavailable shortly after.}}
