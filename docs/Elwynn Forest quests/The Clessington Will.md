==Objectives==
Confront Count Clessington inside [[Northshire Abbey]].
*[[Shadow Barrier|Barrier]] dispelled
*[[Count Clessington]] slain

==Description==
I'm no great mage like my father, but I do know a few of his tricks.

I saw those signets you got off the enforcers. My father's private chambers were locked by a similar [[magic]]al trinket, which can be broken apart into pieces.

Let me put those signets back together into an [[arcane]] key. That should get us past the barrier.

Then... I can only hope we can talk some sense into him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hate that it's come to this...

==Completion==
I'm sorry, I need a moment. He was not a good man, but... he was still my father.
