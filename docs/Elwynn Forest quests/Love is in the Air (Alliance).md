Smell these roses! My partner got them for me at the Gala of Gifts.

Interested in seeing things yourself? Head to the gates of Stormwind. There are gifts, and food, and you should taste the chocolate, it's delicious!

;Gabbo Blinkwink
Hey there, friend! Do you like gifts? How about flowers? Food? Chocolate? Vacations to scenic lands?

Oh, I'm getting ahead of myself! Come to the Gala of Gifts, where all this and more is yours!

I can take you there with this portal. Just touch it and imagine being surrounded by love!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||5}}
* 30 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to the Gala of Gifts, friend!

Would you like to hear more about our specialty chocolates?

==Notes==
In [[Valdrakken]], an arcane projection of [[Gabbo Blinkwink]] offers this quest outside the bank. Interact with the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] at {{co|54.3|63.2|Valdrakken}} and select the Gala of Gifts option to head directly to the event site.
