==Description==
Thanks to you we know the [[Fargodeep Mine]] is infested with [[kobolds]].  Now we need a scout to investigate the more distant [[Jasperlode Mine]].

Explore Jasperlode and confirm any kobold presence.  To reach the mine, travel east along the road until you reach the [[Tower of Azora]].  From the tower, head north and you'll find the mine in the foothills.

You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
