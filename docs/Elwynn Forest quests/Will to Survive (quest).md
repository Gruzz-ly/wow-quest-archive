==Objectives==
Recover the Drakefire Amulet.
*[[Drakefire Amulet (quest item)]]
*Amulet given to [[Shaw]]
*Resist
*[[Shade of Onyxia]] slain

==Description==
... So it is done.

I would have liked to have questioned [[Count Clessington|the man]] more. But the power was too much for him.

We cannot allow the amulet to end up in anyone else's hands. Claim it, <name>, and we shall ensure its safe return to [[Stormwind]], together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are we done, here?

==Completion==
I'm tired, <name>. I'm tired of the constant battles. I'm tired of being manipulated, abandoned, and hurt. All of our people are.

I miss the person I used to be. A simple girl who wanted to follow [[Edwin VanCleef|her father]]'s footsteps and help her home in the same stride. The girl who thought that was possible. 

<[[Vanessa VanCleef|Vanessa]] sighs.> 

... I suppose I owe you some thanks. You've given me much to think about.

==Notes==
Take the amulet from the ground and give it to Shaw.

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|... Vanessa.}}
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|Noticed my little sleight of hand, did you? No way I'm leaving something like this for Stormwind. The Drakefire Amulet is mine, now.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|I don't think so, VanCleef! Hand it over!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Cecilia Clessington]]|What... what's happening?}}
:''Vanessa and Mathias start fighting each other.''

Overwhelming Presence stuns the adventurer. Use the Will to Survive extra action button, several times.
:{{Text|say|Shade of Onyxia|The control I could give you... you only have to take it.}}
:{{Text|say|Shade of Onyxia|You cannot resist. Kill them all. Take it for yourself.}}

Control resisted:
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|It's Onyxia... her will... lingers over that amulet. Over all of us.}}
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|Some long dead [[dragon]] thinks she can manipulate me? I don't think so.}}
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|I've had enough of this worthless trinket!}}
:{{Text|emote|Vanessa VanCleef shatters the Drakefire Amulet.}}
:''The [[Shade of Onyxia]] appears.''
:{{Text|yell|Shade of Onyxia yells: NOOO! POWER! CONSUME ALL! TAKE IT ALL!}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Your power is gone, and your legacy is broken, snake!}}

Continue using the extra action button when necessary and kill the Shade.
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|Is this what it's always going to be for our people? To be manipulated by great unknown powers, time and time again?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|And to overcome them, time and time again.}}
