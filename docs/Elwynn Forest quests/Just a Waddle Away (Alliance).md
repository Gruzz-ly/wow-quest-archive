==Objectives==
Discover the [[duck]]'s hiding spot.
*Potion used
*[[Daetan Swiftplume|Daetan]] found {{Co|34.60|69.42|Elwynn Forest}}
*[[Golden Egg Heirloom|Heirloom found]] {{Co|30.53|90.84|Elwynn Forest}}
*[[Duck Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
We need to find out where those ducks are hiding our stolen goods! And who this mysterious [[Daetan Swiftplume|Daetan]] is, while we're at it.

I convinced [[Emmery Fiske|Emmery]] to give me more of that potion. Take it and find my heirloom!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Black Duck Disguise]]
*[[Brown Duck Disguise]]
*[[Mallard Duck Disguise]]
*[[Pink Duck Disguise]]
*[[White Duck Disguise]]
*[[Yellow Duck Disguise]]

You will also receive:
*[[Brightly Colored Egg]]
*[[Duck Disguiser]]

==Progress==
Where would those ducks be hiding...

==Completion==
<Zinnia carefully examines the heirloom>

Did a duck gnaw on this? This is going to take some elbow grease to polish out!

Thank you for your help, <name>.

==Notes==

{{Zone Map Note|34.60|69.42|Cross|Find Daetan}}
{{Zone Map Note|30.53|90.84|Star|Heirloom and Daetan fight}}
}}

Use the potion and exit Goldshire to the southwest. On the bank of the river between Goldshire and the [[Westbrook Garrison]] at around {{Co|34.60|69.42|Elwynn Forest}}, [[Mischievous Duck]]s and [[Relaxed Duck]]s are present, and [[Daetan Swiftplume]] flies in:
:{{Text|say|Daetan Swiftplume|To the nest, my friends! We will end this ridiculous festival of colored eggs.}}
:''Daetan flies away.''

Drop the disguise, then find his nest south, past the [[Stonefield Farm]] at {{Co|30.53|90.84|Elwynn Forest}} and loot the [[Golden Egg Heirloom]] by the nest. Completing this quest unlocks [[Quacking Down (Alliance)]].

Additionally, if other players have not already done so, drag the Golden Egg onto the nest to summon [[Daetan Swiftplume]], who drops the [[Noblegarden Trinket]], which starts [[Feathered Fiend (Alliance)]]. Daetan's first kill also awards the [[Quacked Killer]] achievement.
