# Elwynn Forest questing guide

This '''Elwynn Forest questing guide''' details the best way to obtain and complete quests in [[Elwynn Forest]].

For a list of all [[Elwynn Forest]] quests in table format, see [[Elwynn Forest quests]].

[[Image:Icon-warning-22x22.png|Note]] '''Note''': This guide is not meant for power-leveling purposes. Rather, it is meant to show a player the most efficient way to complete all quests available for a particular zone. If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the '''[[Talk:Elwynn Forest questing guide|talk page]]''' as to your reasoning.

== {{Alliance_Icon}} Northshire Valley (LVL 1-5)==
{{Cleanup|Quests changed in 4.0.3a}}

[[Northshire Valley]] is the starting zone for new [[human]]s, and is located in northern part of [[Elwynn Forest]]. Other races may choose to quest here, but not all quests are available to them. If you are new to the game, check out the [[Newbie Guide]] to get started, or just dive in — the game has in-game hints and the opening quests are very straight-forward, just relax and have fun!

* You must approach the mine at (49,37) (and kill Kobolds) to complete [[Investigate Echo Ridge]].
* There is a shack on the hill side near (57,48) where you can find Garrick and his friend for [[Bounty on Garrick Padfoot]].

== {{Alliance_Icon}} Elwynn Forest (LVL 5-10)==

===Goldshire===
[[Goldshire]] is the hub for exploring [[Elwynn Forest]]. It is assumed a beginning player already worked to Level 5 in a starting zone before arriving here and making the Inn at Goldshire their home.
The Stonefields and Maclures are two farms just to the south with family issues. There is an easy quest chain requiring you to bounce back and forth a bit, plus fetching a trinket from a kobold infested mine.

* [[Goldtooth]] is a Kobold in the Fargodeep Mine. Kill him to get [[Bernice's Necklace]]. You will also be collecting Candles and Gold dust for other quests.

===Eastvale Logging Camp===
In the eastern part of Elwynn Forest there is a bridge with Thomas, the quest giving guard. Nearby at the logging camp are a few more quest givers. You can do these quests with only one hike back to Goldshire near the end.

==Other (LVL 10-12)==

You should be level 10 at this point. It is usually easier to grab another level or two here instead of the starting quests in a Level 10-20 zone. Also, Dwarves and Gnomes on their first visit south will find these quests a good introduction before heading to [[Westfall]].

* Pestles' Quests have prereqs and should be ignored to those first arriving at level 10.
* Grind the gnolls for the [[Painted Gnoll Armband]]s needed for [[Riverpaw Gnoll Bounty]] and continue until [[The Collector's Schedule]] drops.
* At the [[Brackwell Pumpkin Patch]], completely clear the farm, before attempting [[Princess (boar)|Princess]]. It is possible to solo this, even with her guard pig.
* You'll find [[Jasperlode Mine]] north of the [[Tower of Azora]].
* Look for a group on the channel for [[WANTED: "Hogger"|"Hogger"]], although some folks might be able to solo him.

==Where to go from here==
The next logical step for [[human]] characters is to head over [[Westfall]]. However, [[Ironforge]] is just a tram trip away and [[Loch Modan]] is of the appropriate level for questing. Review [[Westfall questing guide]] and [[Loch Modan questing guide]] to help you choose your next steps.
