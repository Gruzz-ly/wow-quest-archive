==Objectives==
Defeat <Matley Graston/Poggchug Ragethrower> in a duel near <[[Goldshire]]/the road to [[Razor Hill]]>.
*<[[Matley Graston]]/[[Poggchug Ragethrower]]> defeated

==Description==
If it's a challenge you're after, I think I have an idea.

I saw a boastful champion heading toward <Goldshire/Razor Hill>. You could challenge him to a duel.

This would satisfy your desire and perhaps teach him a valuable lesson in humility.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
How fares your challenge?

==Completion==
On any other day, you do great deeds for others.

Today you have done something great for yourself. And that is the best gift of all.

==Notes==

For the Horde version, find [[Poggchug Ragethrower]] at [[Rezlak]]'s camp south of the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]], surrounded by [[Razor Hill Citizen]]s and speak with him:
{{Dialogue|
Poggchug can take on anyone, anytime, anywhere!

{{Gossip|quest=|I challenge you to a duel!}}

;Gossip after defeat
{{Dialogue|
Poggchug lost? But how? Everyone believed in Poggchug!

Maybe Poggchug did not believe in himself enough...
