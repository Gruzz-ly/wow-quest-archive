Report to [[Sergeant Willem]] behind [[Northshire Abbey]] in [[Elwynn Forest]].

== Description ==
=== Class trainer ===
While you were out training I received an urgent message from Sergeant Willem.  Turns out that the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] orcs have hired goblin assassins.  They ambushed our battalion behind the abbey.  Willem has asked me to send him a hero.  You have to go help them, <name>!

Find Sergeant Willem north of the abbey at the command tent. Go!

("Sergeant Willem: Sergeant Willem can be found at the command tent behind Northshire Abbey.")

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{coppercost|13}} (or {{coppercost|30}} at max level)

== Completion ==
It's true, we were ambushed. I don't dare send any more soldiers out there and risk losing them too. I need a volunteer. Someone willing to risk their life! 

==Notes==
Exit the abbey, take a right and head north along the outside of the abbey to find Willem.
