==Objectives==
Speak with Emmery Fiske at the Wizard's Sanctum in Stormwind.
*Speak with [[Emmery Fiske]] at the [[Wizard's Sanctum]] in [[Stormwind]].{{co|48.6|86.9|Stormwind City}}

==Description==
We need to put an end to this [[duck]] invasion.

While I was shooing some stragglers away from the inn, a flock showed up and made off with some of our decorations and eggs. My precious heirloom was among the items stolen!

Please, <name>. I won't stand for these pilfering poultry. I know a [[mage]] in Stormwind who might have some ideas on how to handle this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Brightly Colored Egg]]

==Progress==
Have you spoken with Emmery yet?

==Completion==
Don't worry, I'm sure he'll have a good solution. Wait here, I think I see a portal forming.

==Notes==
Head to the Wizard's Sanctum in the [[Mage Quarter]] of Stormwind and speak with Emmery Fiske inside the tower but before taking the portal:

{{book|content=
What do you need?

{{Gossip|quest=|Zinnia sent me...}}

Zinnia sent you, did she? Tell her that I didn't become an Archmage to deal with such trivial things.

Hmph. If it's so important to her, I'll look into a potion to communicate with the ducks.
}}

Upon completion, Emmery pops out of a portal from Stormwind and offers the next quest.

==Progression==
{{What the Duck}}
