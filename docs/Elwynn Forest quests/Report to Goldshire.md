== Objectives ==
Take Marshal McBride's Documents to [[Marshal Dughan]] at [[Goldshire]] in [[Elwynn Forest]].
* [[Marshal McBride's Documents]] (Provided)

== Description ==
<Name>, you are a <class> with proven interest in the security of Northshire. You are now tasked with the protection of the surrounding Elwynn Forest.

If you accept this duty, then I have prepared papers that must be delivered to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire. Goldshire lies along the southern road, past the border gates.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pikeman Shield
|Pikeman Trousers
|Goldshire Heavy Jacket
|Deputy's Chainmail
|Innkeeper's Longstockings
}}

===Classic===
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Pikeman Shield#Classic}}

== Progress ==
You have word from McBride? Northshire is a garden compared to Elwynn Forest, but I wonder what Marshal McBride has to report.

Here, let me have his papers...

== Completion ==
Well, it says here that you've been awarded Acting Deputy Status with the Stormwind Marshals.  Congratulations.

And good luck - keeping Elwynn safe is no picnic... what with most the army busy doing who knows what for who knows which noble!

It's hard to keep track of politics in these dark days...

==Notes==

Don't miss to pick up [[Rest and Relaxation]] from [[Falkhaan Isenstrider]]{{coords|45.6|47.7|Elwynn Forest}} on your way to Goldshire.
