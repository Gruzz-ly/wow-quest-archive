==Objectives==
Bring Argus' Note to [[Bartlett the Brave]] the gryphon master.
*[[Argus' Note]] (provided)

==Description==
Although we don't get much aid from [[Stormwind]] directly, I do have a contact in the city who helps supply us with armor. His name is [[Osric Strang]]. His shop, [[Limited Immunity]], is in the [[Old Town]] of [[Stormwind]].

Our supply of armor dwindles, and I must contact Osric for more. Can you take him this note?

The fastest way to Stormwind is through [[Bartlett the Brave]], our [[gryphon master]]. He's just outside of the [[Blacksmith|smithy]]; bring him my note, and then take a [[gryphon]] to Stormwind.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*160 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Stormwind}}

==Progress==
You look like you're in a hurry.  Well, then you came to the right place!

==Completion==
You have to get this note to Stormwind?  That's not a problem, you can take one of my gryphons!

==Notes==
*This quest chain is Human only.
