==Objectives==
Recover the rune from the [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] camps to the east and use it to learn a new ability, then return to [[Drusilla La Salle]] in [[Northshire]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Haunt (warlock rune)]]

==Description==
I've been experimenting with a new type of [[magic]] - a rune which can channel [[fel]] energies to fuel powerful spells. I would share this power with you, but my notes were stolen last night. I suspect the [[bandit]]s calling themselves the 'Defias' are to blame.

Go to the east, and see if you can find my rune stashed among their possessions. Learn its magic, and report back to me. I would like to see my experiment put to use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Tattered Cloth Gloves]]

==Progress==
Well? Any progress?

==Completion==
You seem to have taken well to this new magic, <name>. Find more runes like this and engrave them to your equipment to wield new abilities against those who would oppose you.

Someday, perhaps your power will even eclipse my own.
