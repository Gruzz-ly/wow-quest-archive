==Objectives==
Recover the libram and follow its guidance to learn a new ability, then return to Brother Sammuel in Northshire.
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Crusader Strike (paladin rune)]]

==Description==
Relics of the Light can be found across Azeroth. These relics - in particular, the Librams that have guided our order since its founding - can help you strengthen your connection to the Light.

One such libram was held in the Abbey's archives, but it has been stolen by the Defias bandits to the east. Recover the libram, then study it and follow its guidance to learn a new combat technique. Return to me when you have done this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Tarnished Chain Gloves]]

==Progress==
What has the libram revealed to you, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune you have learned to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

Seek out more of these relics along your travels.

==Notes==
Kill [[Defias Thug]]s to loot the [[Libram of Judgement]]. Equip it and use seal 10 times to upgrade the Building Inspiration buff to the Inspired buff. Then use the Libram to learn the rune.
