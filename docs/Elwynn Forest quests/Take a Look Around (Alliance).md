==Description==

* 10x [[Love Token]]
* {{cost|||5}}

==Progress==
Have you seen all of the wares available?

==Completion==
Aren't the wares just marvelous? I find myself just a little jealous of the talent--and I find it hard to resist picking up everything they've made!

Did anything catch your eye?

==Notes==
Luciana has gossip:
{{book|content=Welcome, welcome, to the Gala of Gifts!

There's so much love to discover. Get a gift to show your appreciation for your loved ones!

{{gossip|What is the Gala of Gifts?}}

A celebration of the bonds we've built and the people we love, of course!

Artisans from all over Azeroth have come to sell exquisite gifts that reflect your kindness and affection. Show your appreciation for your loved ones by getting them something special!

Every artisan hand-crafts their goods from the heart, so you can trust that what you give to friends, family, or partners is of the highest quality!

The minimap lights up with blips.

{{gossip|Scenic getaways?}}

Haven't you ever wanted to be whisked away to an exciting new place?

When I heard we were putting on a festival, I rushed out of the Mage's Quarter and headed here immediately! I knew there would be folks like you who want to get away and see something different!

Go on, it's free! My gift to you.
