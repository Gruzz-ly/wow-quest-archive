The '''human starting experience''' takes place in [[Northshire Valley]], in [[Elwynn Forest]], a level 1-20 zone. Despite the victory against the [[Lich King]], [[Stormwind (kingdom)|Stormwind]]'s [[militia]] was stretched thinner than ever, due to new threats back at home. [[Deathwing]]'s attack on [[Stormwind City]], [[kobold]]s and [[gnoll]]s threatening the populace, and rumors of [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] [[bandit]]s sightings; the city wouldn't last long without a constant stream of food and supplies to support its population. [[Northshire Abbey]] remains dedicated to recruiting and training any [[Adventurer|citizens]] brave enough to help keep the peace.<ref>[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/races/human World of Warcraft Website - Human Race description]</ref>

The [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]] opened a pass between Northshire and the [[Burning Steppes]], causing the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] [[orc]]s, under the leadership of [[Kurtok the Slayer]],<ref name="Ending the Invasion!">[[Ending the Invasion!]]</ref> to invade the valley. The newly recruited [[adventurer]]s start by aiding the [[Stormwind Infantry|Stormwind infantries]], by killing the [[Blackrock Worg (Elwynn Forest)|worgs]], [[Blackrock Spy|spies]], and the [[Goblin Assassin|goblin assassins]] that were sent to ambush a battalion stationed behind the abbey,<ref>[[Join the Battle!]]</ref><ref>[[They Sent Assassins]]</ref> as well as helping [[Brother Paxton]] heal the fallen soldiers.<ref>[[Fear No Evil]]</ref>

Meanwhile, a large contingency of Blackrock orcs remains on the east side of the valley, and began burning down the forest and [[Northshire Vineyards|vineyards]].<ref>[[The Rear is Clear]]</ref> The adventurers were also sent to kill the remaining orcs and take their weapons as proof,<ref>[[Blackrock Invasion]]</ref> and were asked to extinguish the fires raging across the vineyard by its owner [[Milly Osworth]].<ref>[[Extinguishing Hope]]</ref> Finally, the adventurers killed Kurtok, the invasion leader, and [[Marshal McBride]] sent [[peasant]]s to seal the pass to end the invasion.<ref name="Ending the Invasion!" /> The Marshal then promotes the adventurers to Acting Deputy, and are sent to [[Goldshire]] to protect the surrounding Elwynn Forest.<ref>[[Report to Goldshire]]</ref>
