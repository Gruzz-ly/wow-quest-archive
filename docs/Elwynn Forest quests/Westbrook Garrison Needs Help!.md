==Objectives==
Go to the [[Westbrook Garrison]] and speak with [[Deputy Rainer]].

==Description==
The Garrison on our western border sends word of increasing gnoll and thief activity. They're requesting we send more [[Stormwind]] soldiers... but we just don't have any to spare!

If you can help, we could use it. Go and speak with Deputy Rainer at the Westbrook Garrison and see what he needs done.

The Garrison is down the road to the west. After you cross the bridge over the small brook it will be to the right.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*210 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at level 70)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Marshall Dughan sent you, eh? Well you're not from [[Stormwind Army|the army]], but if Dughan sent you then that's good enough for me!

Our situation is, to say the least, a stressed one. I hope you can give us a hand.
