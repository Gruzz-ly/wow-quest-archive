==Objectives==
Slay kobolds in Echo Ridge Mine to receive a memory. Kneel within Northshire Abbey to meditate on the light, then use the memory to learn a new ability. Afterwards, return to Priestess Anetta.
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Penance (priest rune)]]

==Description==
The Light has shown me your future, fighting the kobolds in Echo Ridge Mine. Within the mine, the Light will grant you a memory of the past. Once this is revealed to you, return to the Abbey and kneel within these halls to meditate on the Light's mysteries.

Once you have focused your thoughts, you will be able to make sense of this memory and learn a new technique. Return to me when you have done this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Tattered Cloth Gloves]]

==Progress==
What has the Light revealed to you?

==Completion==
As the Light reveals more visions to you, you can always meditate at sacred sites to clear your thoughts and contemplate these mysteries.

I have also foreseen that your path will lead you to commune with our elven allies in Kalimdor. Learning more about their curious moon-worship rituals may help us someday lead them to the Light as well.
