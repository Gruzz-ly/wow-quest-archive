This quest concludes the [[Stonefield Necklace quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Bring Bernice's Necklace to [["Auntie" Bernice Stonefield]] at the [[Stonefield Farm]].
*[[Bernice's Necklace]]

==Description==
I was playing near the Fargodeep Mine, and I think I dropped, er...I mean I saw, the old lady's necklace.  Don't ask me how it got there...it wasn't me!

Well anyway, I saw this big, gold-toothed kobold pick up the necklace and run back to his den above the mine.  Go find that kobold and you'll find the necklace, I swear!

==Progress==
Hello, <name>.  Have you found my necklace?

==Completion==
Oh, you found it!  Thank you, thank you dear!

Here, take this.  It was my husband's and he always said it was lucky.  If only he didn't forget it on his last campaign! *sniff*
