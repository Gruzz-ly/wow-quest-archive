This quest is part of the quest chain {{questchain|A Fishy Peril}}.

== Objectives ==

[[Marshal Dughan]] wants you to speak with [[Guard Thomas]].

== Description ==

If you are concerned that the rumors of murlocs are true, then do this -- travel to the eastern Elwynn bridge and speak with Guard Thomas. He has been stationed at the bridge for the past week and will know the state of the area.

I have here a Stormwind charger that will take you to Guard Thomas. Let me know if you wish to make use of the horse.

== Completion ==

Yes, murlocs have settled in and around the streams of eastern Elwynn.  We don't know why they are here, but they are aggressive and at least semi-intelligent.
