==Description==
[[File:HallowsEndWaterBarrel.jpg|thumb|Fire brigade water barrel]]
With the Headless Horseman at large, the heroes of Goldshire are always ready to form a fire brigade.  Do you want to help?

North of here, guards set up a small area to practice fighting fires.  Go there and throw buckets onto the blazes.  You can fill a bucket from the water barrel here, or the one near the fires.

Good bye, <name>.  When you're done with fire brigade practice, please visit us again!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Hallow's End Pumpkin Treat]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Stormwind}}

==Progress==
Hello, <name>. Have you been perfecting your fire fighting techniques? Don't forget about the practice area to the north!

==Completion==
You're wet and smudged with soot!  You must have been extinguishing fires!

Well done!  As an honorary member of the Goldshire Fire Brigade, I beg you to return here if ever the village needs you!
