==Objectives==
Buy a gryphon ride to [[Goldshire]] from the gryphon master [[Dungar Longdrink]], then take Osric's Crate to [[Smith Argus|Argus]] at Goldshire.
*[[Osric's Crate]] (provided)

==Description==
The gryphon master in Goldshire is [[Bartlett the Brave|Bartlett]]. If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my gryphons to him.

That's a good lesson to know: gryphons are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote gryphon master after you've already been there.

You've already been to Bartlett, so just speak with me again when you're ready to take a gryphon to [[Westfall]]. Once there, you can deliver Osric's Crate to [[Quartermaster Lewis]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
*630 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with {{F|Stormwind}}

==Progress==
You're back from Stormwind? &nbsp;Did Osric send the armor?

==Completion==
Great, you brought the armor! &nbsp;We'll get this divvied to those who need it immediately.

Thank you, <name>. &nbsp;Your efforts have been a great help to us. &nbsp;And now that you're no stranger to gryphons, I hope you'll come and lend your aid to Goldshire often!
