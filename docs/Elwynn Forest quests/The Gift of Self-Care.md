After accepting the quest, speak with the questgiver again to choose the next quest he provides:

{{book|content=
So, what is it that YOU truly desire?

*{{Gossip|quest=|A challenge.}}
:A challenge is an excellent way to favor your strengths and excite the body!

:I think I know something that could give you just that.

*{{Gossip|quest=|Something tasty.}}

:You and I share a common interest!

:In my years of traveling, I have sampled much of the food and drink [[Azeroth]] has to offer.

*{{Gossip|quest=|A nap.}}
:Ah yes, rest is important!

:It can be difficult to find a good place to sleep, especially now that the gala has brought in crowds.

:But I found a wonderful inn with extra beds that are quite comfortable!

:{{Gossip|Tell me more.}}
