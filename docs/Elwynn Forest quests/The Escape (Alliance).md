==Objectives==
Take the Invisibility Liquor to [[Maybell Maclure]].
*[[Invisibility Liquor]] (provided)

==Description==
Take this invisibility liquor to young Maybell.  It should last long enough for her to visit Tommy Joe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*630 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|90}} at lvl 90)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*5x [[Minor Healing Potion]]

==Progress==
Did you deliver my letter to [[Tommy Joe Stonefield|Tommy Joe]]?   What did he say??

==Completion==
Oh...my!  I feel guilty deceiving my family, but my feelings for Tommy Joe are too strong to ignore.

Thank you, <name>.  I'll drink this liquor as soon as I have the chance and sneak away to my love.

And for you... please take this.

==Notes==
The story drops here, and for many years in the game that was that.  However in ''[[World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor]]'', the player builds a [[Garrison]], and if they choose to build the [[Barn]], they'll find Tommy Joe Stonefield and Maybell Maclure-Stonefield (and family) working in it.

;On completion
