==Objectives==
Defend Northshire.
*[[Northshire]] defended (0/100%)

==Description==
Good to see you again, recruit. Wish it were in better circumstances.

Whatever this "influence" is, anybody with half a grudge now thinks it's worth spilling blood over!

Not to mention all the [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] [[bandit]]s! And the hired thugs! At this rate, more [[soldier]]s from [[Stormwind]] will only create more confusion.

From what I've seen, you can knock the sense back into most of these people. If they keep fighting you after their eyes have cleared... do what you must. They have made their choice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've seen quite a few things in my days of training new recruits... but this is madness!

==Completion==
We'll take anyone we can and heal them up. Even if we have to tie some down.

Sure hope that magic doesn't have any lasting effects.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|We saw Clessington use the amulet in Moonbrook. Its pull was... like hunger. For chaos and power.}}
:{{Text|say|Cecilia Clessington|My father will use it to spark an insurrection and bring down his political rivals. He's spoken of this plan for years, but I never thought he would actually go through with it.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Even if we know he was behind it all, could he use the amulet to make us forget? To make us think he was in the right? He must be stopped!}}

Attack the enemies - [[Defias Bandit (Northshire Valley)|Defias Bandits]] (+5%), [[Clessington Attendant]]s (+5%), [[Confused Acolyte]]s (+3%), [[Confused Recruit]]s (+3%), [[Confused Commoner]]s (+3%), [[Defias Mage]]s (5%), [[Duncon Ratsbon]], [[Defias Rebel (mob)|Defias Rebels]] (+5%), and [[Defias Ringleader]]s.

;Defias Bandits - idle
*{{Text|yell|Give me your coin!}}
*{{Text|yell|I know you've got more money on you, hand it over!}}
*{{Text|yell|Where's the rest of your coffers?!}}
*{{Text|yell|Your choice, cough up some coin or get a blade in the gut!}}
*{{Text|yell|Your choice, cough up some coin or get a blade to your gut!}}

The Defias and Confused mobs either turn neutral and run away:
*{{Text|say|I can't do this...}}
*{{Text|say|I'm sorry... I need to think.}}
*{{Text|say|My head...}}
*{{Text|say|No more... there are other ways to fight for change. Not this.}}
*{{Text|say|Ugh... what...?}}
*{{Text|say|I need to go lay down...}}
*{{Text|say|Ugh... what was I thinking?}}
*{{Text|say|Wait... This isn't what I wanted...}}
*{{Text|say|Why am I so angry? I just need to go cool off...}}
*{{Text|say|Down with, uh... everything!}}
*{{Text|say|I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me!}}

or the Defias continue fighting:
*{{Text|say|Curse you! Curse everything!}}
*{{Text|say|I'll tear this whole kingdom down with me!}}
*{{Text|say|What was I... angry about...?}}
*{{Text|say|It doesn't matter! Let it all burn!}}
*{{Text|say|My anger is my own! I'll take everything you have!}}
*{{Text|say|Get out of my face!}}
*{{Text|say|I don't like the look you're giving me!}}
*{{Text|say|Who are you? Get out of my face!}}

;Aggro Duncon
:{{Text|yell|Duncon Ratsbon|The Defias answer to me now!}}
