== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Gramma Stonefield]].

==Description==
Please, <name>, talk with my Gramma. If anyone can find a way to bring me together with Maybell, she can.

She's inside our house east of here.

== Completion ==
While our families are feuding, Tommy Joe and Maybell don't have much of a future, but... maybe we can get them together for just a little while.

Hm, what can we do...
