==Objectives==
Speak to Simeon Griswold at the [[Gala of Gifts]], then relieve your stress in [[Old Town]].
*Speak with [[Simeon Griswold]]
*Stress relieved (0/100%)
*Return to Simeon Griswold at the Gala of Gifts.

==Description==
You [[adventurer]]s are known to carry heavy burdens. There will be no better time to confront them than now.

I saw a veteran somewhere around here. There is a chance he may know what it means to cope with stress.

Perhaps he has insight to teach you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
I've seen men die of stress. You don't want to bottle it up every day.

==Completion==
Feeling better?

You must take care of yourself after a tough day. If you're good to your body and brain, they'll be good to you.

==Notes==
Speak with Simeon at {{co|33.93|50.51|Elwynn Forest}} on a crate between the chocolate and wine tents:
{{book|content=
{{Gossip|quest=|How do you relieve stress?}}

You're asking the right question, <class>.

After twenty years, I've learned all that tension builds up. You need to release it.

Head to Old Town--go whale on a training dummy, or kick the rubbish off the street or something. Scream if you have to. The relief it gives you... it feels like love.
}}

Following Simeon's advice, head to Stormwind's Old Town and kick [[Discarded Trash]] (+3%), which [[Jenn Langston]] and [[Erika Saka]] are not fond of:
:{{Text|say|Hey, careful! This town is dirty enough without you kicking rubbish everywhere!}}

Hit a dummy (+1% every second) and use the Yell extra action button or interact with the [[Abandoned Pillow]]s (+6%).

The adventurer screams:
:{{Text|yell|<Name>|Aaaahhhhhh!}}
:{{Text|yell|<Name>|Aaaarrrrgghhhh!}}

And nearby onlookers react:
:{{Text|say|[[Stormwind City Patroller]]|It's like that some days.}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind City Patroller|Are you okay?}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind City Patroller|What's wrong with you?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lovely Reveler]]|Need a hug?}}
:{{Text|say|Lovely Reveler|I completely understand.}}
