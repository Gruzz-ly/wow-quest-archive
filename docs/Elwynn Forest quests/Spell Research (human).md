==Objectives==
Recover research notes from the Defias bandits and use them to learn a new spell, then return to Khelden Bremen in Northshire.
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Ice Lance (mage rune)]]
*[[Comprehension Primer]] (provided)

==Description==
I will teach you what I can, <name>, but your own research will lead to astonishing power. Studying notes left by Azeroth's greatest archmages is an excellent place to start. The Abbey's archives used to contain a myriad of arcane research notes, but they were stolen by Defias agents.

Recover spell notes from the bandits to the east and use this primer to decipher them. Return to me once your research is successful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*[[Tattered Cloth Gloves]]
*[[Comprehension Charm]] x3

==Progress==
How is your research progressing?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Take these Comprehension Charms. They will help you decipher any more arcane writings you find.

Continue to seek out spell notes across Azeroth and use them to further your research. If you need more charms, pay a visit to a reagent vendor.
