== Objectives ==
Find and kill "[[Morgan the Collector|the Collector]]" then return to [[Marshal Patterson‎]] with [[The Collector's Ring]].
*[[The Collector's Ring]]

== Description ==
[[File:Manhunt TCG.jpg|thumb|In the ''[[Trading Card Game]]'']]
If the "Collector" is taking gold from our mines then he's stealing from the kingdom! Bring the Collector to justice, and bring me the ring mentioned in the [[The Collector's Schedule|pickup schedule]] you gave me. It may tell us whom the Collector is working for...

That Pickup Schedule says the Collector is hiding out at the [[Brackwell Pumpkin Patch]]. You should search for him there. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive one of the following rewards:
|Elastic Wristguards
|Patterson‎'s Sparring Gloves
|Wrangling Grips
|Stormwind Plate Gloves
}}

You will also receive:
*840 [[XP]]
*[["Collecting" Bag]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Did you find the Collector?&nbsp; Did you discover whom he's working for?

== Completion ==
You found him?  Well done, <name>.&nbsp; He won't be "collecting" from the Elwynn Mines again!

And this ring you found is interesting... it's a membership ring for the old [[Stonemasons Guild|Stonemason's Guild]] in [[Stormwind]].&nbsp; I haven't seen one of these in years, since back in the days when the [[Defias Brotherhood]] used to infest this land.
