Kill 6 Blackrock Worgs.

== Description ==
=== Human ===
So you're the new recruit from [[Stormwind]], eh?  I'm [[Marshal McBride]], commander of this garrison.  Glad to have you on board...

<McBride looks through some papers.>

<Name>.  It is <name>, right?

You've arrived just in time. The [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] orcs have managed to sneak into Northshire through a break in the mountain. My soldiers are doing the best that they can to push them back, but I fear they will be overwhelmed soon.

Head northwest into the forest and kill the attacking Blackrock worgs! Help my soldiers!
=== Non-human ===
Another Alliance recruit, eh?  I'm Marshal McBride, commander of this garrison.  We don't see many of your kind here, <race>, but we could sure use the help.
