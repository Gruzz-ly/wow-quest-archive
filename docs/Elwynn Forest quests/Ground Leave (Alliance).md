==Objectives==
Explore [[Stormwind]].
* Visit the Auction House
* Visit the Bank
* Visit the Embassy
* Visit the Portal Room

==Description==
Perhaps we should get an idea of this city, if it is to be our new home. A scouting mission, if you will.

Go, see what this place has to offer. I will follow [[Wrathion]] and attempt to help in any way I can.

Try not to upset the locals any more than you must, though. I doubt many of them are used to seeing [[dragon]]s walk among them.

Meet up with us once you've gotten the lay of the land.

==Progress==
How goes the exploration?

==Completion==
The [[Alliance]] has granted us asylum here in Stormwind.

It sounds like quite an interesting place.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Soldiers of Stormwind, allow me to--}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Wrathion! You were warned against making unannounced visits. Especially when you bring company.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|A thousand pardons, my dear spymaster, but I come bearing the tidings of the Dragon Aspects for Lord Commander Turalyon.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|As for the dracthyr, you have my word that they will cause no harm. They have come seeking refuge, not conflict.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Their conduct will be on your head, Wrathion. The dracthyr have my leave to roam the city. But know this... SI:7 will be watching.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Let them pass!}}
:''Shaw and the guards turn back to the city, with Wrathion and dracthyr entering the city.''
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Hmph. Mortals...}}
:{{Text|say|Obsidian Warder|Let us see what this city holds for us.}}
:{{Text|say|Obsidian Warder|After that long flight, I need food. Something more filling than our dusty rations from the Reach.}}

Walking through Stormwind, guards and inhabitants have various comments while passing and jumping near them:
*{{Text|say|Stormwind City Guard|Dragons don't belong here!}}
*{{Text|say|Stormwind City Guard|I'm not afraid of you, dragon!}}
*{{Text|say|Stormwind City Guard|I don't trust dragons. Not since that [[Lady Prestor]] business.}}
*{{Text|say|Could I have one of your scales? For crafting purposes, of course.}}
*{{Text|say|Do a barrel roll!}}
*{{Text|say|Do you know [[Alexstrasza]]?}}
*{{Text|say|How fast can you fly?}}
*{{Text|say|How high can you go?}}
*{{Text|say|How many dragons are in these 'Dragon Isles'?}}
*{{Text|say|I don't know if we need more outsiders.}}
*{{Text|say|I guess those wings aren't just for show!}}
*{{Text|say|I wish I was going to adventure with dragons!}}
*{{Text|say|I won't forget what [[Deathwing]] did to this city.}}
*{{Text|say|I wonder if they use those claws in battle.}}
*{{Text|say|Keep those talons where I can see them!}}
*{{Text|say|Oh! I love your scales!}}
*{{Text|say|Showoff. Walk like a normal person!}}
*{{Text|say|So you can fly!}}
*{{Text|say|Their wings are remarkable.}}
*{{Text|say|[https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winterfell_(Game_of_Thrones) What do dragons eat, anyway?]}}
*{{Text|say|What happens if you sneeze?}}
*{{Text|say|What is it like to fly?}}
*{{Text|say|Why haven't we seen your people before?}}
*{{Text|say|Do you plan to eat us?}}
*{{Text|say|I always wanted to see a dragon breathe fire!}}
*{{Text|say|You look too skinny to be a dragon.}}
*{{Text|say|Woo! Burn it all!}}
*{{Text|say|Impressive!}}
*{{Text|say|Amazing!}}
*{{Text|say|Are you sure you're a dragon? Or just a big [[lizard]]?}}
*{{Text|say|Careful with that flame!}}
*{{Text|say|Is it getting hot in here?}}
*{{Text|say|Dragons are attacking the city! Again!}}
*{{Text|say|Leave our city, spawn of Deathwing!}}
*{{Text|say|How do you walk through doorways with wings like that?}}
*{{Text|say|The belt's crocolisk, I swear!}}
*{{Text|say|Do you plan to eat us?}}

True to his words, Mathias' agents are present all over the city, seen [[SI:7 Agent (Stormwind City)|stealthed]] or [[Cathedral Priest|disguised]].

;Dracthyr in the streets
*{{Text|say|Obsidian Warder|I wonder what else we missed during our long stasis.}}
*{{Text|say|Obsidian Warder|There is much this land can teach us.}}
*{{Text|say|Obsidian Warder|Most of these people are... civilians?}}
*{{Text|say|Obsidian Warder|One of the small ones asked for a ride.}}
*{{Text|say|Obsidian Warder|Are there other cities like this one?}}
*{{Text|say|Obsidian Warder|Even the plants are strange here.}}
*{{Text|say|Obsidian Warder|This place feels so different from the Reach.}}
