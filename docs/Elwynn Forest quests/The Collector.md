==Objectives==
Go to [[Marshal Patterson‎]] at the [[Eastvale Logging Camp]] in [[Elwynn Forest]] and give him [[The Collector's Schedule]].
* [[The Collector's Schedule]] (provided)

==Description==
This note is a schedule with a list of days and times when a person -- described only as "[[Morgan the Collector|The Collector]]" -- will receive a shipment of gold from the mines in [[Elwynn Forest]].

From the schedule, it looks as if the Collector resides near the [[Brackwell Pumpkin Patch]] in eastern Elwynn.

This sounds important.  You should report it to Marshal Patterson‎ at Eastvale Logging Camp.  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||85}}
*210 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at level 80)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
What?!?  We haven't had our people working the Elwynn mines for months!

Let me see that note you have...

==Completion==
Hm... I have heard of this "Collector" but I don't know whom he's working for.  Thank you for the schedule.  It will help us solve this mystery.
