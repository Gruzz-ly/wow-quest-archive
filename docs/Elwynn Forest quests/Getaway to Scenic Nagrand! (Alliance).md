==Description==
Today's special is a magical getaway to the great plains of Nagrand!

If you're headed there, would you mind shooting a few animals? Oh, not like that! Here, borrow my camera.

My friend Beatrice has been roaming around there lately. She would really appreciate some photographs, but I've got portals to attend to.

* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
There are so many places in [[Azeroth]] to escape to! Everywhere you look, there's something new to discover.

==Completion==
I knew Beatrice would appreciate your photographs.

Thank you for your kindness, <name>.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] and choose the Nagrand option:
:{{Gossip|quest=|A wild adventure in Nagrand.}}

{{Zone Map|zone=Nagrand|notes=
{{Zone Map Note|52.8|44.8|Ping|Toothy}}
{{Zone Map Note|49.5|38.7|Ping|Swifthorn the Timid}}
{{Zone Map Note|33.0|49.2|Ping|Soaring Windroc}}
{{Zone Map Note|42.9|59.8|Ping|Great White Elekk}}
{{Zone Map Note|28.7|46.3|AvailableQuest|Beatrice}}
{{Zone Map Note|49.6|46.9|Blue|Portal}}
}}

Use the provided [[Borrowed Camera]] to take pictures of wildlife. Note that the wildlife needs to be alive in order to count!

Find Toothy at {{Co|52.81|44.84|Nagrand}}. He comes under attack from [[Big Game Hunter (mob)|Big Game Hunters]]. Defeat them, then use the camera and take a photo of the beast.
:{{text|say|Big Game Hunter|You ain't grinning now, are ye beasty?}}
:{{text|say|Toothy|<Angry grunting.>}}
:{{text|say|Big Game Hunter|Stay out of our business, damn photographer!}}

Swifthorn the Timid is found running around {{Co|49.46|38.72|Nagrand}} with two [[Amateur Photographer]]s wheezing for breath, trying to keep up.
:{{text|say|Amateur Photographer|Wait, come back!}}
:{{text|emote|Amateur Photographer wheezes for breath.}}

Soaring Windrocs are flying above [[Lake Sunspring]].

Great White Elekk is found northeast of [[Oshu'gun]] at {{Co|42.96|59.81|Nagrand}}. Taking a photo of it enrages it:
:{{Text|emote|Great White Elekk is startled by the flash photography!}}

Nearby are [[Amateur Photographer]]s:
:{{text|say|Amateur Photographer|How do we get a picture of THAT? It's terrifying!}}
:{{text|say|Amateur Photographer|I don't want to scare it! You go first!}}

Once all four photos are taken, head to Beatrice Ripley at {{Co|28.7|46.6|Nagrand}} at her camp on the western end of [[Lake Sunspring]]:

{{book|content=
{{Gossip|quest=|I took these photographs for you.}}

Photographs for me?

<Beatrice inspects your pictures.>

These are incredible! You've given me such a thoughtful gift. Thank you.

Please, if you could, share this one with my friend Maurice Guichi. He's a famous chocolatier. I heard he's at the Gala of Gifts.
}}

There is a Portal to Stormwind at {{Co|49.69|46.27|Nagrand}} that teleports the adventurer back to the gala. Speak with Guichi at the chocolate stand:

{{book|content=
{{Gossip|quest=|Beatrice wanted me to share this photograph with you.}}

Oh this is wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing.

I love animals, but animals and chocolate don't go well together.
