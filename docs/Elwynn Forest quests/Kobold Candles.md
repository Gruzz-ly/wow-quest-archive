==Objectives==
Bring 8 Large Candles to [[William Pestle]] in [[Goldshire]].
*[[Large Candle]] (8)

==Description==
Hello, <good sir/my lady>! Do you have a moment?

My brother and I run an apothecary in [[Stormwind]], and I'm here to gather large candles for their wax. Can you help me?

You can get large candles from kobolds, and I hear rumors that kobolds are infesting the Elwynn mines... the Fargodeep mine to the south and Jasperlode Mine to the east. I suggest looking for candles in one of those places.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Candlewax Streaked Robe
|Kobold Hunter's Trophy Belt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
*630 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|70}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Did you gather those candles yet?

==Completion==
You were busy hunting kobolds, were you? Thanks for the candles, &lt;name&gt;, and here's your reward...
