==Objectives==
Meet [[Dark Ranger Lyana]] at [[Three Corners]] in [[Redridge Mountains]].

==Description==
It's not unusual to see [[SI:7]] [[spies]] lurking around the city, but something about this doesn't feel right.

We need to find where [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]]'s trail picks up. The last tracks were heading east, towards Redridge.

The path to Redridge crosses the Three Corners, one of the [[Alliance]]'s more well-defended [[tower]]s.

I have an idea. Meet me there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There are few paths through Redridge, save this one.

We should start the next stage of our investigation here.
