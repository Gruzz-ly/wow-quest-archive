==Objectives==
Return the Dunes Deck to the {{C|Darkmoon Faire}} when it comes to town.
*[[Nightmares Deck]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you have gathered all of the Nightmare cards together into a deck, a ninth card mysteriously appears with the same backing as the first eight. On this card is inscribed, "Return these cards to the Darkmoon Faire and be rewarded." You have heard that this faire alternately stops at {{C|Mulgore}} and [[Goldshire]] every few weeks, so you will have to wait until they are here next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Darkmoon Card: Torment]]
*390 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]

==Progress==
I see that you have managed to complete a deck of nightmares!   Congratulations!

==Completion==
So you have put together a deck of Nightmares.   Your gesture of returning it to us will create a tie between you and the Darkmoon that will not soon be forgotten.   Allow me to present you with one of the greater darkmoon cards as a small token of our appreciation.
