==Objectives==
Give [[Sara Timberlain]] the Stormwind Armor Marker.
*[[Stormwind Armor Marker]] (provided)

==Description==
For your shrewdness and valor, I have a marker here that is good for one piece of armor. I want you to take it to [[Sara Timberlain]] at the [[Eastvale Logging Camp]]. Give her the marker, and she will fashion the armor for you. And after you receive it, <name>, use it in the defense of Elwynn.

Eastvale is just east of this post across the bridge.

==Rewards==

|Well-Stitched Robe
|Patched Pants
|Studded Arm Protector

}}

You will also receive:
*50 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I have been commissioned by the Stormwind Army to supply their people with cloth and leather armor.

If you have a marker for me, then I'd be happy to make you something.

==Completion==
Ah, thank you for the marker.  Please feel free to pick your choice of armor.

Luck to you, brave <class>.  And may this armor serve you well.
