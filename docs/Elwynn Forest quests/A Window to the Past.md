==Objectives==
Speak with [[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] under the [[Lion's Pride Inn]] in [[Goldshire]] to hear about the history of the [[:Drakefire Amulet]].
*Speak with Shaw

==Description==
In this, I trust [[Vanessa VanCleef|Vanessa]]'s word. I do not believe she knows what the Drakefire Amulet is. Some of the story about [[Onyxia]] was made public, but not all.

Perhaps even you do not know. 

I will explain everything, for both of you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Vanessa sizes you up.>

==Completion==
We all have our own versions of the past, don't we? 

I don't care if some [[dragon]] lady had a magic amulet. It wasn't complete mind control. 

The [[Nobles of Stormwind|nobles]] already hated the common people. The [[Stonemason's Guild]] would never have needed to turn to [[bandit]]ry and become the [[Defias Brotherhood]], if not for them.

==Notes==
Speak with Shaw:
:Keep your wits about you.

Shaw and Vanessa now offer additional information.

Speak with Shaw:
:{{Gossip|<Ask for more information about the Defias Brotherhood.>}}
::The Defias Brotherhood exists for many reasons, but they would not exist without Onyxia.

::The [[First War]] saw Stormwind razed to the ground. [[Edwin VanCleef]] led the Stonemason's Guild in rebuilding the city. But when they were to be paid, the [[House of Nobles]] refused.

::It was chaos at the time, but we now know how Onyxia, as Lady Prestor, worked behind the scenes. She convinced the House that the Stonemason's work was poor, and they were being ripped off.

::Then, she went to the Stonemasons and convinced them that the House of Nobles despised them and would never pay them their due.

::{{Gossip|<Continue.>}}
:::Her magical influence was a subtle thing. Not overt mind control. She could not force someone to do something they did not already want to do, somewhere inside.

:::Onyxia played both sides against each other so well, a riot erupted in the city. A thrown rock struck [[Tiffin Ellerian Wrynn|Queen Tiffin Wrynn]], and took her life. [[Varian Wrynn|Varian]]'s wife. [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]'s mother. In a world of wars and [[demon]]s... it was a cruelly simple fate. 

:::King Varian was furious, and banished the Stonemasons from the city. They fled to [[Westfall]], where Onyxia continued to stoke their rage by using her influence to cut off supplies and support to the region.

:::They became the Defias Brotherhood, and under Edwin VanCleef's reign, they turned to banditry and murder to recover the gold owed to them.

:::{{Gossip|<Ask Shaw how he feels about the Defias Brotherhood.>}}
::::It is easy to sympathize with the plight of the Stonemasons Guild.

::::It is not so easy to overlook the banditry and murders committed by the Defias.

::::Their goals never justified their methods.

::::But that does not mean that their goals--to see the Stonemasons paid, to help the people of Westfall--should be forgotten.

::::King Anduin made strides in addressing those issues, but for many, it will never be enough.

::::All we can do is keep trying. Forming a working relationship with Vanessa VanCleef herself... that sounds like another step in the right direction.

::::{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}
:{{Gossip|<Ask for more information about Vanessa VanCleef.>}}
::Ah, yes. What is the [[Stormwind City]] Spymaster doing having a chat with one of the most notorious criminal leaders known to man, instead of arresting her on sight?

::Good question.

::Vanessa is not an innocent woman. The Furlbrows, the [[Deadmines]]... there is much she should answer for.

::But war changes all of us. During the [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|invasion of the Burning Legion]], she took up her blades and poisons in defense of [[Azeroth]]. I saw her bleed for our world.

::{{Gossip|<Continue.>}}
:::Maybe it's just wishful thinking. Maybe I'm just going soft. Maybe... because I knew her father...

:::<Shaw sighs.>

:::Whatever the reason, I believe there is good in her. She cares deeply for the people of Westfall.

:::And she is not her father. Someday, she might actually listen to reason.

:::{{Gossip|<Ask if Shaw knew Edwin VanCleef.>}}
::::<Shaw's jaw tightens.>

::::Yes, I knew him.

::::{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}
:{{Gossip|<Ask for more information about the Drakefire Amulet.>}}
::We don't know where or how Onyxia first acquired her [[Fragment of the Dragon's Eye|Dragon's Eye]], as the amulet was first called. But while she had it on her person, her words were like honey to all that heard them.

::Myself included. I remember a sort of... fog around her. It never occurred to me to question a single thing she said, regardless of my normally cynical nature.

::Mind you, our wills were still our own. It was the combination of her cunning and her magic that gave her power. She knew what you wanted to hear... and how to push you in the direction you were already facing.

::The amulet could not force anyone to do something they didn't already want to do, somewhere inside.

::{{Gossip|<Continue.>}}

:Default text:
:::When Onyxia was in the height of her power as Lady Prestor, she placed the Dragon's Eye directly on [[Bolvar Fordragon]]. That seemed to enthrall him even more deeply than the rest of us.

:::But then Windsor arrived and, in the confrontation, the amulet was shattered.

:::Onyxia fled to her [[Onyxia's Lair|lair]] and locked the door behind her. But the key was within her broken amulet.

:::The Dragon's Eye was reforged into the Drakefire Amulet. It was used to enter her lair, where she was finally defeated.

:Or if you have the [[Drakefire Amulet]]:
:::When Onyxia was in the height of her power as Lady Prestor, she placed the Dragon's Eye directly on [[Bolvar Fordragon]]. That seemed to enthrall him even more deeply than the rest of us.

:::But then you and Windsor arrived and, in the confrontation, the amulet was shattered.

:::You reforged the Dragon's Eye into the Drakefire Amulet. You used it to enter her lair, where you finally put an end to her.

:::Afterward, the Drakefire Amulet was returned to Stormwind, where it was kept in safekeeping, lest its power linger.

:::{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}

Speak with Vanessa:
:{{Gossip|<Ask for more information about her.>}}
::Hmm, I suppose we have not met.

::I am Vanessa VanCleef, daughter of Edwin VanCleef, who was once head of the Stonemason's Guild.

::When the House of Nobles betrayed the guild and King Varian Wrynn exiled us, my father created the Defias Brotherhood to get justice.

::Stormwind ordered him killed. It happened right in front of me. When I was old enough, I took up his mantle. Back then, I stood by his every action, hand on heart.

::I followed his footsteps. And I realize now... I made the same mistakes. By confusing revenge and justice... I hurt the people of Westfall. People who have no one else to stand up for them.

::Things are different, now.

:If you've defeated her in the Deadmines, she has the following dialogue:

::What, like you don't remember "killing" me in the Deadmines?

::Hah, I suppose... what am I to you but another boss of another "evil" organization that needs to be put down?
::Nevermind my purpose. Nevermind my PEOPLE. I wanted to help them! The Westfall Sentinels who sent you would merely preserve the status quo!

::<Vanessa sighs, and the anger drains out of her.> 

::It doesn't matter now. I made so many mistakes. I can't say I didn't deserve it. 

::Then, the Legion invaded. Everything changed.

:If you are a Rogue and a member of the Uncrowned she has the following dialogue:

::What, like you don't remember all our wonderful time together? 

::Hah! Fine, I'll play along. 

::YOU took MY seat as a Shadow of the Uncrowned, during the Legion Invasion. I challenged you for the position, and... well, I was having an off day. You won. That time. Once.

::Whatever.

::They decided I should work for- no, that you needed someone actually competent to help do your job. So I stuck around to do the heavy lifting for you.

::<Vanessa suddenly pauses, then swallows hard.> 

::That was a lot of demons.

::{{Gossip|<Ask about her time fighting the Legion.>}}
:::...

:::...I've seen men do terrible things to one another. I've seen my people starve. I've seen my father killed. I've seen my own revolution fall apart at my feet.

:::The torture and pain the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] sought to bring to our world... that was... something else entirely.

:::I saw many people die in those days. You can't come back from that the same person.

:::<Vanessa turns her head away and stares into the distance.>

:::{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}
:{{Gossip|<Ask for more information about Shaw.>}}
::<Vanessa rolls her eyes.>

::The Spymaster for the Crown has some principle, I'll give him that. The fact that he still hasn't arrested me means he can keep his word, at least.

::We have an "arrangement". I keep the Defias on a short leash, and he doesn't go after us. 

::Luckily for him, I'm not that interested in leading my Brotherhood to murder and robbery anymore. If only the bulk of the Defias actually felt the same...

::It's getting harder and harder to keep them from hurting innocent people.

::{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}
:{{Gossip|<Ask for more information about the Defias Brotherhood.>}}
::<Vanessa straightens slightly.>

::The Defias Brotherhood are vigilantes fighting for the people of Westfall when no one else will.

::At least... we should be. Many would call us bandits. In my father's time... I have to admit it was true. His righteousness turned quickly to vengeance and greed.

::But that doesn't mean his anger wasn't justified. As long as there is suffering in Westfall, there will always be Defias. I tried to lead them to be a force for revolution and good. Now, I fear they are too used to the life of the bandit.
