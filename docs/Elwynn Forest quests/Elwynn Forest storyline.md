'''Elwynn Forest''' is a level 1-20 zone, the starting zone for [[human]]s. For the quests in [[Elwynn Forest]] before the Cataclysm, see [[Elwynn Forest (Classic) quests]].

Ever since the fall of the [[Defias Brotherhood]], these vast woodlands became far more tranquil. Nonetheless, this region, with [[Goldshire]] at the crossroads in its heart, is the prime location for trading. Most residents of Elwynn are involved in one of its major industries: logging, farming, [[fishing]], or [[mining]]; they provide the [[Stormwind City|capital]], to the west, with a constant stream of food and supplies. This exchange has become increasingly threatened by [[kobold]] invasions of the [[gold mine]]s, old rivalries among [[farmer]]s, and attacks from wild animals, and with the army stretched thinner than ever, it falls to the [[Adventurer|citizens]] to restore the peace.<ref>[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/races/human World of Warcraft Website - Human Race description]</ref>

Recently promoted to Acting Deputy, the adventurers recruited in [[Northshire Valley]], joined by the other races of the [[Alliance]], arrive at Goldshire. There, they are greeted by [[Marshal Dughan]], who immediately gives them their next assignment.<ref>[[Report to Goldshire]]</ref>

==Mines and kobolds==
[[File:Fargodeep Mine.jpg|thumb|The Fargodeep Mine]]
Marshal Dughan has received reports that the [[Fargodeep Mine]] is overrun with kobolds, so he tasks the adventurers with scouting the mine to confirm these reports.<ref name="The Fargodeep Mine">[[The Fargodeep Mine]]</ref> At the same time, they are asked by [[William Pestle]] in the [[Lion's Pride Inn]] to gather candles used by the kobolds for their wax.<ref>[[Kobold Candles]]</ref> On the way back, they also sell their [[Gold Dust]] mined by the kobolds to a crazy [[merchant]] named [[Remy "Two Times"]].<ref>[[Gold Dust Exchange]]</ref> After reporting back to the Marshal, the adventurers investigate the more distant [[Jasperlode Mine]], located in the foothills northeast of Goldshire.<ref>[[The Jasperlode Mine]]</ref> Finally, Dughan concludes that he will have to increase the patrols near the mines to be able to open them again.<ref name="The Fargodeep Mine"/>

==Maclures vs Stonefields==
===Bernice's Necklace===
While investigating the Fargodeep mine, the adventurers enter the [[Stonefield Farm]], where they stumble upon an old family feud. [["Auntie" Bernice Stonefield]] lost her necklace, but she is convinced that [[Billy Maclure]], member of the rival family of farmers, the Maclures, had stolen it. The adventurers ask Billy whether he had indeed stolen the object, to which he replies that he is "too hungry to remember".<ref>[[Lost Necklace]]</ref> Turns out that Billy is a big fan of Bernice's [[Pork Belly Pies]], and only those delicacies would make him remember. The adventurers hunt a few wild boars and take the meat back to Bernice. She isn't happy about it but wants her necklace back more, so she bakes the pie and they take it back to Billy.<ref>[[Pie for Billy]]</ref><ref>[[Back to Billy]]</ref> Billy still doesn't admit his wrongdoing, but he got the pie he wanted. Apparently, a large kobold named [[Goldtooth]] stole Bernice Stonefield's necklace when Billy Maclure dropped it near the mine and took it to his den above it. The necklace is finally returned to "Auntie" Stonefield, who reveals the necklace originally belonged to her husband.<ref>[[Goldtooth (quest)]]</ref>

===Tommy and Maybell===
[[William Pestle|William]] asks the adventurers in the Lion's Pride Inn for a favor. Last time he was at the [[Maclure Vineyards]], he overheard [[Maybell Maclure]] crying in her cottage, so he wishes for someone to go check up on her.<ref>[[A Visit With Maybell]]</ref> She reveals that she is in love with [[Tommy Joe Stonefield]], but because their families are bitter enemies, they cannot be together. She asks the adventurers to deliver a [[Maybell's Love Letter|love letter]] she wrote to Tommy Joe,<ref>[[Young Lovers]]</ref> who after reading the letter tells them to speak with his [[Gramma Stonefield|grandmother]].<ref>[[Speak with Gramma]]</ref> Gramma Stonefield is against the feud between the two families, so she goes to great lengths to bring the two lovers together. She sends a [[Gramma Stonefield's Note|note]] to William Pestle, who asks the adventurers to collect [[Crystal Kelp Fronds]] from the [[murloc]]s living in the [[Crystal Lake]].<ref>[[Note to William]]</ref><ref>[[Collecting Kelp]]</ref> He manages to concoct an [[Invisibility Liquor]] that the adventurers deliver to Maybell.

==On to Eastvale==
===A Fishy Peril===
[[File:Eastvale.jpg|thumb|Eastvale Logging Camp]]
[[Remy "Two Times"]] wants the adventurers to speak with [[Marshal Dughan]] about the [[murloc]] threat to the east. Since he cannot afford to send more troops east without a military report, he asks the adventurers to go speak with [[Guard Thomas]], who confirms the murlocs have been behaving aggressively.<ref>[[A Fishy Peril]]</ref><ref>[[Further Concerns]]</ref> Thomas then entrusts them with finding two guards, [[Rolf Hartford]] and [[Malakai Stone]], who were sent to investigate the murloc threat but had not yet returned.<ref>[[Find the Lost Guards]]</ref> Both guards were found dead in the murloc village, so Guard Thomas decides that the murlocs are a threat that can no longer be ignored.<ref>[[Report to Thomas]]</ref>

===Eastvale Logging Camp===
The adventurers help the local population with advertised bounties and collecting wood. From murlocs to wild [[Wolf|wolves]], and a bounty on a local [[bandit]] named [[James Clark]], here the army is stretched thin as well.

After the gold mines investigation, Marshal Dughan has one final assignment.
