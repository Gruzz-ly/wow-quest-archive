==Objectives==
Deliver Rolf and Malakai's Medallions to Guard Thomas at the eastern Elwynn bridge.
*[[Rolf and Malakai's Medallions]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you have both medallions, deliver them to Guard Thomas at the bridge so that he might know the fate of his murdered guards.

==Progress==
Hello, <name>.  Have you discovered the fates of Rolf and Malakai?

==Completion==
You have confirmed my fears, <name>.  The murlocs are a threat we cannot ignore.

==Notes==
After having discovered [[Rolf's corpse]] in the [[murloc]] village, run down to the bridge between [[Goldshire]] and the [[Eastvale Logging Camp]] and speak with [[Guard Thomas]].  This will finish the quest and lead to the next step, [[Deliver Thomas' Report]].
