==Objectives==
Explore the Fargodeep Mine, then return to [[Marshal Dughan]] in [[Goldshire]]. 
*Scout through the [[Fargodeep Mine]]

==Description==
The mine in Northshire isn't the only one with problems! I have reports that the Fargodeep Mine in Elwynn has also become a haven for Kobolds.

Explore the mine and confirm these reports, then return to me. The mine is almost due south of [[Goldshire]], between the Stonefield and Maclure homesteads. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
*630 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|70}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
What do you have to report, <name>? Have you been to the Fargodeep Mine?

==Completion==
This is bad news. &nbsp;What's next, dragons?!? &nbsp;We'll have to increase our patrols near that mine. &nbsp;Thanks for your efforts, &lt;name&gt;. &nbsp;And hold a moment... I might have another task for you.
