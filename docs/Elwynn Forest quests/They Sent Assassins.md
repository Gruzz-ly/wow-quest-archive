==Objectives==
Kill 8 Goblin Assassins.
* [[Goblin Assassin]] slain (8)

==Description==
Have you ever seen a [[goblin]], <name>? They're wretched little green-skinned monsters that love only two things: gold and themselves.

The [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] orcs have enlisted the aid of goblin assassins to kill our soldiers. If you look to the field in the north you can barely make out their silhouettes, sneaking about in the grass.

I need you to head out there and kill every goblin that you see. They need to learn that nobody messes with the [[Alliance]]!

("Goblin Assassin: This is a goblin assassin. Nasty little monster!")

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Outfitter Boots
|Outfitter Gloves
|Outfitter Gloves
|Outrider Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Kill the goblin assassins!

==Completion==
That will teach those monsters! They'll think twice before taking another [[mercenary]] job for orcs.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fear No Evil]] from [[Brother Paxton]] before heading out.

The assassins have a few lines when they are aggroed:
*{{text|say|We'll kill anybody for the right price!}}
*{{text|say|We're gonna burn this place to the ground!}}
*{{text|say|Time to join your friends, kissin' the dirt!}}
*{{text|say|DIE!!!}}
