This quest is part of the [[Stonefield Necklace quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Bring 4 Tender Boar Meat to [[Auntie Bernice Stonefield]] at the [[Stonefield Farm|Stonefield's Farm]].
*[[Tender Boar Meat]] (4)

==Description==
Maybe if I got a pie, I could tell you who has that necklace.  And you know, I think that old Bernice lady at that other farm makes great [[Pork Belly Pies]]... 

Maybe if you gave her some tender boar meat from the boars that hang around our farms, and told her what it was for, she'd bake up a pie for you.

==Progress==
I don't think it's right feeding the boy who stole my necklace in the first place, but if that's what it takes to get back what's mine, then so be it!

Do you have that boar meat?

==Completion==
Though this wild boar meat is bland, simmer it enough in the right spices and it sure does make for some tasty pie!
