[[File:Loving Yourself Your Way Nap Alliance.jpg|thumb|Upstairs in the [[Lion's Pride Inn]]]]

==Objectives==
Take a nap in the upstairs guest room at the [[Lion's Pride Inn]].
* [[Gusseon Mistley|Gusseon]] woken
* Pillow fluffed (2)
* Nap taken

==Description==
While visiting this gala, I am staying at the Lion's Pride Inn at [[Goldshire]].

I hear they have some extra beds upstairs. Why not see if you can sleep there for a while?

I think I will have a bit of a rest too... Right... here...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
<Ying is quietly snoring.>

==Completion==
...Huh? Oh! Welcome back, did you enjoy your rest?

On any other day, you do great deeds for others.

Today you have done something great for yourself. And that is the best gift of all.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Lion's Pride Inn]], and upstairs to the room with [[Gusseon Mistley]] and [[Hilda Thornwood]]. Hilda has gossip:

{{book|content=This bed's mine. Go pester that one over there. He's been out cold since yesterday.

*{{gossip|But you're not even using this bed.}}
:'Course I'm using it! I'm sitting here, aren't I?

*{{gossip|But I want to sleep here.}}
:This bed's the best I've found east of Kul Tiras! Better have a good reason to try and give me the boot.

*{{gossip|I'm a famed adventurer!}}
:No.
*{{gossip|Please?}}
:No.
}}

Interact with Gusseon Mistley until he wakes up:
:{{text|say|Gusseon Mistley|<Snoring.>}}
:{{text|say|Gusseon Mistley|Hnn... Madeline...? Five more minutes...}}

Upon [[Gusseon Mistley]] waking:
:''Gusseon wakes up and gets to a sitting position.''
:{{text|say|Gusseon Mistley|Huh, what? Oh no, I'm late!}}
:''He exits the room.''

Then fluff the pillow twice and interact with the comforting bed to take a nap. After a fade to black, [[Hilda Thornwood]] has left, but [[Snuzormu]], a bronze whelp, appears:
{{book|content=I love sleep so much! 

Maybe I was a green dragon in a different timeline...

{{gossip|What are you doing here?}}

I came to bring you an important message from [[Chronormu]]! But then I saw you sleeping and decided to help.

I sped up your timeline so you could get lots of extra sleep!

*{{gossip|Thanks?}}
:You're welcome! Delivering messages is tiring work!

*{{gossip|What message?}}
:I... forgot. Sorry.

:If it was really important, I'm sure you'll see me another time!
