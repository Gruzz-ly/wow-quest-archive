== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Kurtok the Slayer.jpg|Kurtok the Slayer|Kurtok hides amidst the smoke and flames, to the east.}}
Kill Kurtok the Slayer.
* [[Kurtok the Slayer]] slain

== Description ==
The rampaging orc horde is led by a savage beast known as Kurtok the Slayer! Kurtok is responsible for the recent invasion and must be killed if we are to have peace in the valley.

Venture back east, across the river and through the vineyard, and look for the passage leading into the mountains. Kurtok will be there, preparing for another assault. Kill him and return to me.

==Rewards==

{{itembox|Original rewards

|Long Lost Wand
}}

==Progress==
Have you found Kurtok?

==Completion==
With Kurtok slain we are safe once again from the orcish hordes. I will send peasants to the pass in an attempt to seal the passage so that no more orcs may come through into our territory.

You have the thanks of Stormwind and of the Alliance, hero!

==Notes==
Head east and cross the stream heading to the north end of the vineyard. Look for a Blackrock clan banner. Kurtok can be found at {{co|57.0|40.8|Elwynn Forest}} beside it. He is a level five orc with 204 health.

On completion:
