==Objectives==
Bring 4 Crystal Kelp Fronds to [[William Pestle]] in [[Goldshire]].
*[[Crystal Kelp Frond]] (4)

==Description==
I can make an invisibility liquor for Maybell, so she can slip away from the [[Maclure Vineyards]] and go to Tommy Joe.  But to make the liquor, I need some crystal kelp.

Although the kelp usually grows in the ocean... sometimes [[murlocs]] collect it.  See if the murlocs near [[Crystal Lake]] have any.  Crystal Lake is just east of Goldshire.

==Progress==
Do you have that crystal kelp?  I'm sure Maybell is anxious to see her beau...

==Completion==
You got them.  Good show!  Now, just one moment while I concoct the potion...

==Notes==
