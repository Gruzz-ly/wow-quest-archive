==Objectives==
Gain entrance to [[Stormwind]].

==Description==
Ordinarily such a flight would take considerably longer. But when the [[Nozdormu|bronze Aspect]] himself speeds you on your way, it allows one to make the journey in record...

<ahem> ...[[time]].

Oh, the soldiers with the pointy weapons? Not to worry. Merely a formality.

I shall see about arranging an audience with the Lord Commander while you and [[Scalecommander Azurathel|Azurathel]] get your bearings.

Thankfully, I wield considerable influence in this city.

==Completion==
Perhaps Wrathion's "influence" isn't as considerable as he thinks, if this is the welcome he receives.

==Progression==
{{The Dark Talons}}
