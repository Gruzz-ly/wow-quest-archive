==Objectives==
Collect 4 Barrier Keys off the Leading Attendants.
*[[Enforcer Grant's Signet]]
*[[Enforcer Jennive's Signet]]
*[[Enforcer Tera's Signet]]
*[[Enforcer Horb's Signet]]

==Description==
We're too late, <name>.

[[Count Clessington|Clessington]] has holed himself up inside [[Northshire Abbey|the abbey]] and is spreading the chaotic influence of [[Drakefire Amulet|the amulet]] all over [[Northshire]]!

I don't think most of the people here know the difference between friend and foe, anymore.

This man seems like the type to have a backup plan. Those agents must have a way to get past Clessington's barrier. Take them out and look for anything useful!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must get past the barrier and to Clessington, as soon as we can.

==Completion==
Hmm, it looks like these might be able to combine, somehow...

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|We saw Clessington use the amulet in Moonbrook. Its pull was... like hunger. For chaos and power.}}
:{{Text|say|Cecilia Clessington|My father will use it to spark an insurrection and bring down his political rivals. He's spoken of this plan for years, but I never thought he would actually go through with it.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Even if we know he was behind it all, could he use the amulet to make us forget? To make us think he was in the right? He must be stopped!}}

[[Enforcer Grant]] is at {{co|31.93|60.66|Northshire}}, [[Enforcer Jennive]] at {{Co|46.53|62.33|Northshire}}, [[Enforcer Tera]] at {{co|34.15|35.76|Northshire}}, and [[Enforcer Horb]] at {{co|32.69|20.98|Northshire}}.
