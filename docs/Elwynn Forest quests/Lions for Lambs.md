==Objectives==
Kill 8 Blackrock Spies.
* [[Blackrock Spy]] slain (8)

==Description==
The invading orcs aren't fools. They are sizing us up, making sure that when they attack it will be to their advantage.

In the forest, to the northwest, are Blackrock spies. They peer at us through spyglasses, watching our every move - waiting. I want you take the fight to them!

Kill the Blackrock spies! We must show them that we know they are watching us and that we are prepared!

("Blackrock Spy: This is a male Blackrock orc spy. There are females amongst them as well.")

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Northshire Abbot's Robe

Excellent work, <name>.  You've turned out to be quite an asset to this garrison.  It's time for you to train!

Excellent work, <name>.  You've turned out to be quite an asset to this garrison.

Feel free to speak with any of our trainers within and around the abbey if you need to sharpen any of your combat skills.

==Notes==
Back to the west and northwest. There are also a few spies to the east as well.

Up next is a class-specific quest for humans.  For all others and death knights, it's time to [[Join the Battle!]]
