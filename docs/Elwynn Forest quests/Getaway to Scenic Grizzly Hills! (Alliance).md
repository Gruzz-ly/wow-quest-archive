==Objectives==
Take the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] to [[Grizzly Hills]] to pick a bouquet of flowers for Gabbo.
* Portal taken to Grizzly Hills (Optional)
* Flowers picked (12) ([[Grizzly Hills Flower]])
* Take the return portal to Stormwind (Optional)
* Bouquet brought to [[Gabbo Blinkwink]]

==Description==
Today's special is a magical getaway to the majestic forests of [[Northrend]]!

Say, you're one of those adventurers, right? Listen, I need a favor.

Could you pick me a few flowers from Grizzly Hills? I've got my hands full here, but there's someone I'd really like to give a bouquet to.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
My partner would really appreciate these flowers.

==Completion==
Thanks a bucket, <name>!

I hope you enjoyed your trip in the hills! Everywhere you look, there's something new to discover.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] and choose the new quest option:
:{{gossip|quest=|A frosty hike in the Grizzly Hills.}}

This drops players off at {{co|76.9|40.9|Grizzly Hills}} on [[Prospector's Point]], where the return portal is located. Head west toward [[Camp Oneqwah]] to look for flowers, but watch out for the level-scaled [[Anglerweed]]s and [[Irritated Worker Bee]]s while picking them! Also, A [[Curious Critter]] can pop out:
:{{text|emote|A small critter emerges from behind the flower! It seems to like you!}}

After gathering the required amount, return to the event area and speak with [[Gabbo Blinkwink]]:
:{{gossip|quest=|I have flowers from Grizzly Hills.}}
:{{text|say|Gabbo Blinkwink|Wow, you actually did it! Could... could I have those?}}

Gabbo takes the flowers
:{{text|say|Gabbo Blinkwink|I'll be right back!}}

He walks over to [[Bubbi Gearcrank]]
:{{text|say|Gabbo Blinkwink|I'll be right back!}}
:{{text|say|Gabbo Blinkwink|Hey Bubs, I brought you something.}}
:{{text|say|Bubbi Gearcrank|Oh Blinky, they're beautiful!}}
:{{text|say|Gabbo Blinkwink|They pale in comparison to you, my bubbly beauty.}}
:{{text|say|Bubbi Gearcrank|Oh you're too much Gabby-poo!}}
:{{text|emote|Bubbi Gearcrank blows a kiss to Gabbo Blinkwink.}}
:{{text|emote|Gabbo Blinkwink blushes.}}
:{{text|say|Bubbi Gearcrank|Wish I could stay longer, but the portals need me! Take care!}}
