==Objectives==
Meet [[Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Inspector Snagglebolt]] at the entrance to [[Shadowfang Keep]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].

==Description==
;Newcomer
:Those clues add up to an ugly story, <name>.
:That map shows the Crown's got a heavily guarded base of operations in Silverpine Forest. And between that memo and formula, it looks like they're cooking up something intoxicatingly toxic.
:I've got a guy that can get us some... artisanal goods... to deal with the Crown. I'll go talk to him and meet you outside Shadowfang Keep.
;Returner
:Those clues you found tell an ugly story, <name>.
:The Crown are still up in Silverpine Forest but they've guarded the place even more than before. Now they're cooking up something intoxicatingly toxic.
:I've got a guy that can get us some "artisanal goods" to deal with the Crown. I'll go talk to him and meet ya outside Shadowfang Keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||5}}
* 30 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There you are, right on time.

I've got a plan to deal with this chemical conspiracy.

==Notes==
Before accepting the quest, Snip has new gossip:
{{book|content=Look, I know you and I could both use a nice hot bath, but we're not done just yet. 

We gotta stop Apothecary Hummel before he finishes up that nasty perfume of his.}}

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|I'll go talk to my guy. You meet me outside Shadowfang Keep.}}
:''Snip drops into stealth and walks off.''

There's no quest shortcut, so get flying. Level {{level|df}} characters have the On the Case! buff, increasing dragonriding speed. Catch up with Snip near the [[Meeting Stone]] and instance line to [[Shadowfang Keep]] on the western coast of [[Silverpine Forest]]. He has new gossip again:

{{book|content=I don't like this place one bit. Smells like corpse-flavored scented candles.}}

On approach
:{{Text|say|Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Hey, <name>! Over here!}}

==Progression==
