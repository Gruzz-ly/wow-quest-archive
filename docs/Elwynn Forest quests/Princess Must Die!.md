Now, do any of these suit you? 

== Notes ==
'''Princess''' is a {{reputation|neutral}} level 9 [[boar]] found at the [[Brackwell Pumpkin Patch]] in [[Elwynn Forest]]. She's tougher than the local boars that roam the forest, but not by a significant amount. She will not be hostile unless you attack her, or you happen to be one of [[Ma Stonefield]]'s veggies. She has a slightly smaller boar "guard" ([[Porcine Entourage]]) which follows her around the farmyard and help her in combat.

== Quest Loot==
*Brass Collar
*[[Tender Boar Meat]]

==The Legend==
In the dark depths of Elwynn Forest dwells a monstrous porcine beast that devours everything in her path.  Known as '''Princess''' by the Brackwells, the family whom she rules with an iron fist — er, hoof — and has cowed into giving her free room and board (as well as lots and lots of food), she often leaves her home to terrorize the Eastern Kingdoms by gobbling up all the vegetables on other farms, which has nearly induced a continent-wide famine. Perhaps someday an intrepid hero will put a stop to her endless rampage, but until that time the people of [[Stormwind]] will have to ration their crops carefully...or just eat cake.

A local farmer's wife, clearly traumatized by Princess' attacks and having blocked the more grisly details from her memory, understated the situation thusly:

''"The Brackwells have a prize-winning pig, Princess. The sow is HUGE, and she got that way from sneaking over here and eating my veggies! So before she comes to our fields...Princess must die! Bring me her collar as proof of the deed and I'll give you something for your time!"''

The mercenary to whom she made this request wisely fled screaming into [[Westfall]] and has not been seen since. Meanwhile, Princess' stranglehold on Elwynn continues unabated.

One recurring subject of drunken debate at the [[Lion's Pride Inn]] is who would win in a fight between Princess and the demon lord [[Kil'jaeden]]. Scholars agree that the outcome is impossible to predict, but have come to a consensus on one fact: the forces unleashed during a battle between two such awesomely powerful beings would undoubtedly destroy the known universe!
