==Objectives==
Kill [[Gormashh]] and obtain the Unbelievably Sticky Tar.
*[[Unbelievably Sticky Tar]]
*[[Tara's Tar Scraper]] (provided)

==Description==
Hey, I know! We've been looking at the wrong tar creatures.

Gremix once told me about a larger-than-normal tar creature that he ran into. It lurks around the tar pit far to the east of here, south of Fungal Rock. I'll bet that the bigger these creatures get, the stickier they get! We'll make some money yet, <name>!

Don't forget the scraper!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tarred Robe	
|Sticky Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|65|}}
*7,890 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm counting on you, <name>.  I'm invested pretty heavily into this "tar as glue" scheme, and it'd be a shame if you came back empty-handed.

==Completion==
Yes, this tar is just the stuff...

Hey, wait a minute, my hands... I can't seem to get them apart...

Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Oh, but wait! Super sticky tar remover! That's where the real money is!
