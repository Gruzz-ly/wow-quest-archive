==Objectives==
Obtain an Enormous Dinosaur Talon.
*[[Enormous Dinosaur Talon]]
*[[Fossil-Finder 3000]] (provided)

==Description==
One of the things I hate the most about digging is the fact that half the time, all you find is dirt.  That's why I've been spending most of my time out here tinkering instead of digging.

Let me show you what I've invented: the Fossil-Finder 3000.  I just put the finishing touches on it.  If it works properly, it should find the largest fossils in the area.  I know, sweet, huh?

Test it out and see if you can find some ridiculously big [[dinosaur]] bones.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*7890 XP (or {{coppercost|4800}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you found anything?  Did it work?

==Completion==
What an interesting femur you've brought here, but why's it all sharp and curvy?

...

Wait a minute, that thing's a TALON?  A dinosaur with a talon that size would've been... well, really big, that's for sure.  Is this the only fossil that you found there?
