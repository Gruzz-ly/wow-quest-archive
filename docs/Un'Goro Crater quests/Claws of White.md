==Objectives==
Obtain 5 White Ravasaur Claws.
*[[White Ravasaur Claw]] (5)

==Description==
Stop, <race>. I could use the help of a <class> like you.

Right outside this camp, there are [[raptor]]s with deadly claws. I've been using the claws for druid rituals, but it doesn't seem to be working. However, I did notice that some of those raptors sometimes have white claws, when most have deathly black ones.

The earth works in strange ways. Maybe you could fetch me some of the white claws, and I'll try one last time?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|White Bone Pummeler|White Bone Circle|White Bone Rod}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Have you gotten any of the claws yet? 

==Completion==
My mentor says that sometimes you have to take away from nature before you can give back.  These raptors... I feel that they died for good cause.

Thank you, <name>.
