==Objectives==
Discover the location of the Western Crystal Pylon.
*Discover and examine the [[Western Crystal Pylon]]

==Description==
Durrin's research touched on one area that intrigues me: a potential link between the titans and the dinosaurs. J.D. Collie back at camp is always talking about titan this and crystal that... maybe she'd be interested.

Before you report to her, you might want to check out the crystal pylon not far from here. It's just up in the cliffs, to the west of here. It's got crystals on it, and it always seemed to me like it might have something to do with the titans.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||85}}
*8170 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A pylon in the west?  And a relationship between titans and dinosaurs? This is a lot to take in, <name>.

==Notes==
* The pylon is a short distance up the cliffside west of [[Golakka Hot Springs]], atop a prominent rise up from the crater floor.{{coords|23|59|Un'Goro Crater}} The path to either side of the rise is steep but walkable, and the pylon is visible from the crater floor.
* The [[Dweller in the Cliffs]] stands right next to the pylon, so it will be encountered while completing [[Town Dwellers Were Made to be Saved]]. It is not unreasonable to delay the end of the "Saved" quest until it syncs up with this one, but the distances are not that far; the pylon can simply be returned to later.

===Previous progression===
{{classic only-section|patch=4.0.3a}}
Pylon quests existed prior to {{expac|Cataclysm}}, but had a much less involved lead-up storyline and were given directly by [[J.D. Collie]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Replaced by new version in a new quest chain for the ''Cataclysm'' zone revamp.|comment=Players who had completed this previously do not have credit for the new version.
