==Objectives==
The Pylon table allows you to combine green power crystals with red power crystals.

According to [[Crystal Pylon User's Manual|J.D.'s manual]], this combination can be used to strengthen the protection you have against physical damage.

*[[Red Power Crystal]] (8)
*[[Green Power Crystal]] (6)

==Completion==
Arranging the crystals on the table, you carefully align the colors. As you push the last one into place, a burst of light fuses the crystals together.

The resulting combination is now yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Crystal Ward]] (6)
