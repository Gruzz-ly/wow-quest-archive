==Objectives==
Find signs of [[Ringo]] at [[Fire Plume Ridge]].
*[[Spraggle's Canteen]] (provided)

==Description==
You've got to help me, <name>! My friend, Ringo left earlier to explore the volcano to the north of here, and he has been gone way too long. I am really worried about him.

Do you think you could find him? Why don't you take my canteen with you -- if you do find Ringo, I'm sure he'll need it!

==Progress==
Ringo's sack rests on the rock in front of you.

==Completion==
You find what appears to be Ringo's belongings. If he left these here, he can't have gone far away. Maybe you should look for him.

==Progression==
{{A Little Help From My Friends}}
