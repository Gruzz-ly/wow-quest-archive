==Objectives==
Collect 5 samples of Atal'ai Haze, then return to [[Muigin]] in {{C|Un'Goro Crater}}.
*[[Atal'ai Haze]] (5)

==Description==
To tell you the truth, <name>, I've never seen any plants like this in my travels. Perhaps I should take a trip to this crater...

At any rate, I think I know just the thing Muigin's looking for—Atal'ai haze. It's horrid stuff, hard to collect, but it's just what he needs to control the little monsters.

You'll need to visit the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|temple of Atal'Hakkar]] in the {{C|Swamp of Sorrows}}. The Atal'ai Haze can be collected from the deep lurkers, murk worms, or oozes found there. Good luck, <name>!

==Rewards==
You receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*4700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Larion's still not speaking to me! He sure knows how to hold a grudge.

==Completion==
I admit, I'm a bit hesitant to touch that stuff, <name>! But if Gregan says it'll work, then I'm willing to give it a try!

==Notes==
*The haze drops from [[Deep Lurker]]s and [[Saturated Ooze]]s in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Sunken Temple]] raid.

==Progression==
# [[Muigin and Larion]]
# [[A Visit to Gregan]]
