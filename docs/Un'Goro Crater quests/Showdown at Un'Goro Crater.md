==Objectives==
Travel to the camp of Van Amburgh in {{C|Un'Goro Crater|Un'Goro crater}}, in the south of [[Kalimdor]], and defeat the [[dwarf]] and his menagerie.
*Defeat [[Van Amburgh]] and His Menagerie

==Description==
It's time at last. It's taken everything out of me to find Van Amburgh's camp here, and I was wounded by one of his traps. His beasts are with him. Are you ready to finish this?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*8300 [[XP]]
*{{cost|4|98}}

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
It's done. Van Amburgh will commit no further atrocities.

==Notes==
Van Amburgh will engage as soon as the quest is accepted, sending his pets to attack: first [[Bearthold]], then [[Roary]], then finally [[Anne Tenna]]. Their release is timed, so it is possible to fight more than one at a time. The three pets will fall unconscious when defeated; interacting with them will [[Tame Beast|tame]] them into attacking and killing Van Amburgh.

==Progression==
