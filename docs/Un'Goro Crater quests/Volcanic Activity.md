==Objectives==
Collect 9 samples of Un'Goro Ash from the [[fire elemental]]s around the volcano in [[Un'Goro Crater]].
*[[Un'Goro Ash]] (9)

==Description==
Welcome. I'm [[Williden Marshal]], and my sister and I run this expedition of explorers and scientists. You have a moment?

I don't like the look of those elementals on that volcano, <class>. We have too much equipment, too many notes... one crazed elemental could streak its way through our camp and do terrible, terrible damage.

Show them that their new neighbors aren't to be trifled with. And bring back the ash that they leave behind... we might as well do a little science while we're at it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|77|50}}
*2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you think the volcano is active?  I wonder why it didn't explode when the cataclysm hit.

==Completion==
I hope that did the trick.  I'll take the ash... this may come in handy sometime down the line.

==Trivia==
*The phrase "terrible, terrible damage" in the quest text is a reference to an {{StarCraft|Terrible terrible damage|oft-repeated phrase}} by ''[[StarCraft franchise|StarCraft II]]''<nowiki/>'s lead designer Dustin Browder.

==Progression==
