==Objectives==
Deliver the Unloaded Zapper and 5 samples of Atal'ai Haze to [[Larion (dwarf)|Larion]] in [[Marshal's Refuge]].
* [[Atal'ai Haze]]
* [[Unloaded Zapper]] (provided)

==Description==
You're in luck, <name>! I've been working on some of my own experiments while Marvon's been gone, and one of them is a short range bug zapper. With just a few adjustments, it should be great for ridding yourself of those [[Bloodpetal]] pests.

I can let you have one of my zapper prototypes, but you'll still need to collect the fuel. You can get the necessary [[Atal'ai]] haze that the zapper needs in the [[temple of Atal'Hakkar]]. The deep lurkers, murk worms, or oozes are the ones you'll need to get it from.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5100 [[XP]] (or {{cost||43|50}} at max level)

==Progress==
This is exhausting, <name>. Those things just won't leave me alone!

==Completion==
So, Marvon wasn't around? Well, show me what you got, anyway.

==Notes==
The quest provides a [[Bloodpetal Zapper]] which only works to kill the [[Bloodpetal Pest]]s in [[Marshal's Refuge]]. The Zapper requires one additional follow on step, a [[Bloodpetal Sprout]] to be turned into the factioned brother ([[Larion (dwarf)|Larion]] or [[Muigin]]).

==Progression==
#[[Larion and Muigin]]
#[[Marvon's Workshop]]
#[[Zapper Fuel (Season of Discovery)]]
#[[Bloodpetal Zapper (quest)]]
