==Objectives==
Return 20 Venomhide Baby Teeth, the Venomhide Hatchling, 20 Runecloth, 20 Rugged Leather, and 80 gold to [[Mor'vek]] in the southeastern part of the [[Marshlands]] in [[Un'Goro Crater]].
*[[Venomhide Hatchling]] (provided)
*[[Venomhide Baby Tooth]] (20)
*[[Runecloth]] (20)
*[[Rugged Leather]] (20)
*Required money: {{cost|80}}

==Description==
With your expert feeding and care, your venomhide hatchling will grow quickly. As they grow, their hatchling teeth will be replaced by adult teeth. If you keep the teeth shed by your hatchling as it grows, you'll have an easy way to tell when it's mature enough to be trained as a mount.

Your venomhide will let you know what it needs, so pay close attention. When it has shed all of its baby teeth, return to me with your venomhide and the materials for your saddle and I'll do the rest. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*950 [[XP]] or {{cost||57}} at level 80
*[[Whistle of the Venomhide Ravasaur]]

==Progress==
Have you been taking good care of that raptor?

==Completion==
It looks like both of you have managed to do some growing without killing one another.

There, everything's finished. I've trained your venomhide ravasaur to respond when you blow this whistle.

Few have the dedication to hand-feed and raise a venomhide, but they're well worth the effort.

==Notes==
To get the baby teeth you will have to complete the Venomhide Hatchling's daily quests 20 times.
