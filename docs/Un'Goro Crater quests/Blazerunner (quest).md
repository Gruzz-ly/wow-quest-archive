== Objectives ==

Kill Blazerunner.
* [[Blazerunner]] slain

== Description ==
I'm still a bit concerned about these [[fire elemental]]s, <name>. One last request: head to the top of [[Fire Plume Ridge]], and kill the one they call Blazerunner. He's the biggest and strongest of all the fire elementals in the crater. With him gone, I'll be able to sleep much better. 

==Rewards==

You will also receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
Please, <name>.  Head up to the top of Fire Plume Ridge and show Blazerunner an early retirement.

==Completion==
At last, Blazzerunner is extinguished. Thanks <name>... he was driving me batty.
