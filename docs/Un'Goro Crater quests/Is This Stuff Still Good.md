==Objectives==
Return the Crate of Foodstuffs to [[Williden Marshal]] at [[Marshal's Stand]].
*[[Crate of Foodstuffs]] (provided)

==Description==
You find what appears to be a crate of food, left behind when this camp was abandoned. On the outside of the crate, you can make out a stamp that says "PROPERTY OF [[Marshal Expeditions|MARSHAL EXPEDITIONS]]".

Perhaps you might find someone who could use this?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40|}}
*3,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you got there?

==Completion==
Oh... wow... it's some really old food.  Hey [[Hol'anyee Marshal|Hol'anyee]], take a look at this!  This <race> brought us those old rations that we abandoned!

No, not from [[Marshal's Refuge]]... from the old base camp!

I'm not sure I want to peek inside.  I'll just give it to [[Nolen Tacker|Nolen]], I guess... he'll know what to do with it.
