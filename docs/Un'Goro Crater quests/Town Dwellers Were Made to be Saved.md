# Town Dwellers Were Made to be Saved

{{Questbox
 | name = Town Dwellers Were Made to be Saved
 | start = [[Maximillian of Northshire]]
 | level = {{level|Un'Goro Crater}}

==Objectives==
Rescue the [[Dweller by the Shore]], the [[Dweller in the Cliffs]], and the [[Dweller of the North]].
*Dweller by the Shore saved
*Dweller in the Cliffs saved
*Dweller of the North saved

==Description==
I've a feeling that we may find more than dragons here in this crater. My paladin's instinct tells me that there are townsfolk nearby that require our aid. Those in distress cannot be ignored.

Let us sally forth, Squire <name>! The people of Un'Goro require our aid!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80|}}
*7,890 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The cries of distressed damsels are still carried by the wind into my ears. We must find them, and quickly!

==Completion==
Our duty is fulfilled.  Even so, it troubles me that today's damsels were less than gracious... only the fair-haired one by the lake managed to show us any gratitude for our chivalry.  Perhaps tomorrow's damsels will have thankfulness to match their beauty.

Now we must ride.  More adventures await!

==Notes==
Upon accepting this or [[The Evil Dragons of Un'Goro Crater]], Maximillian will join the player on his horse. He's a bit aggressive as a combat partner, occasionally aggroing nearby monsters including neutral ones like [[elite]] [[Stegodon (mob)|Stegodons]].

This quest requires visiting three NPCs at different locations in western Un'goro, where Maximillian will initiate a specific scripted event where he attempts to help them with a perceived "distress", often to their detriment. There is no combat - at least, not by Max's "squire" the player - and only one requires interaction. See the individual pages for the full encounter information:
* [[Dweller of the North]] - Maximillian believes this goblin woman is being attacked by a [[phoenix]] which happens to look a lot like a pet [[parrot]].
** ''A bug may cause the phoenix/parrot to not be visible at all, but Maximillian's script and objective completion still occurs correctly.''
* [[Dweller in the Cliffs]] - Maximillian frees this human woman from a cliffside in which her leg may or may not be stuck in some rocks.
* [[Dweller by the Shore]] - Maximillian directs his squire to valiantly retrieve a crate that was dropped just off the shoreline of the hot springs by a blood elf man.

;Dialogue
* ''{{gossip|Where would one go about finding damsels?}}''
: A fair question.
: One might check the perimeter of the hot springs. Or one might look for signal fires up in the cliffs to the west. Finally, the path to [[Silithus]], far to the north, is often wrought with danger.
: Those would be the places I'd check.

* {{gossip|I think I'll adventure alone for a while.}}
: ''<Dismisses Maximillian. He can be found at his his original location.>''

* {{gossip|Maximillian, I am ready for adventure.}}
: ''<Mobilizes Maximillian to follow the player once again, if they have separated.>''
