==Objectives==
Your [[Venomhide Hatchling]] wants you to feed it 10 Silithid Meat.
* [[Silithid Meat]] fed to [[Venomhide Hatchling]] (10)

==Description==
The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt.

The hatchling's drawings seem to resemble various types of large insects, perhaps the [[gorishi]] [[silithid]]s{{Sic}}. The hatchling finishes his picture, then gestures at it with one short arm, snaps its jaws, and licks its lips.

It must want you to go to the [[Slithering Scar]], in center of the southern part of [[Un'Goro Crater]], and gather silithid meat. When you have the meat, feed it to your hungry hatchling.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:

The hatchling cocks its head and looks at you.

==Completion==
Your venomhide hatchling flashes you a toothy smile and then settles in for a nap.
