==Objectives==
Discover the location of the Northern Crystal Pylon in [[Un'Goro Crater]].
*Discover and examine the [[Northern Crystal Pylon]]

==Description==
You've done us a number of favors, <name>... now let Gremix do one for you. The attacks on Marshal's Refuge were terrible, undoubtedly. They came without warning, and took no prisoners. They were lucky that so many of them survived.

A few weeks ago, I came across a crystal pylon in the cliffs to the northeast of here, east of Marshal's Refuge. I think the pylon and the attacks may be related somehow. Maybe you can investigate? I'm sure someone in Marshal's Stand will thank you. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*7610 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
You think this may be related to the attacks on Marshal's Refuge, <name>?

==Notes==
* The pylon can be found up a short way up the cliffside east of Marshal's Refuge and west of the gorilla cave called [[Fungal Rock]].{{coords|56|12|Un'Goro Crater}} The pylon is visible from the crater floor, and the path up to it is steep but walkable.

==Progression==
{{The Northern Pylon}}

===Previous progression===
{{classic only-section|patch=4.0.3a}}
Pylon quests existed prior to {{expac|Cataclysm}}, but had a much less involved lead-up storyline and were given directly by [[J.D. Collie]].

{{Crystals of Power quests}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Replaced by new version in a new quest chain for the ''Cataclysm'' zone revamp.|comment=Players who had completed this previously do not have credit for the new version. This removes access to the repeatable [[power crystals|power crystal]] turn-in quests until the new quest chain is completed.}}
