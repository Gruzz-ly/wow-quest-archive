==Objectives==
Report to [[Williden Marshal]] at [[Marshal's Stand]] in [[Un'Goro Crater]].

==Description==
Hey, you look like a discriminating adventurer. Are you looking for something different? Something exotic? Something... profitable?

Well shake the sand out of your boots, because I've got a proposition for you. Williden Marshal is looking for competent sellswords such as yourself. He's set up camp at Marshal's Stand, just southeast of the volcano in the center of lush Un'Goro Crater.

Then again, paradise isn't for everyone, <race>. It's up to you. Your tropical oasis awaits.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40|}}
*3,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hey Hol'anyee, look at the getup on this one!

<Williden turns to face you.>

Ahem.  Our recruiter sent you?  Good.  Let's start out with a bit of honesty: Un'Goro isn't the perfect nirvana that you may have been promised.  You've probably figured that out on the way over here, though.

Shall we get to work?
