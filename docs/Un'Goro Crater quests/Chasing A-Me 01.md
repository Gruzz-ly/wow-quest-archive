==Objectives==
{{questportrait|A-Me 01.jpg|A-Me 01|A pre-programmed primate.}}
Find [[A-Me 01]] at [[Fungal Rock]].

==Description==
Unfortunately, something's happened to one of my greatest inventions. You've seen [[mechanical squirrel]]s, yes? Well, to get closer to the [[ape]]s of [[Un'Goro Crater]], I created a mechanical ape to blend in with their kind--I call her A-Me 01.

She has been studying the local wildlife at Fungal Rock for several months, but she should have returned by now. I fear the worst for her.

Can you help me find her?

==Rewards==
*You will also receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A-Me lies motionless before you.  No power seems to be running through her components.
