==Description==
I'm sure you've noticed 'em, <name>. They're everywhere!

What am I talking about? Why, the crystals, of course!

The crystals... They're all over the crater. Most people ignore them, but I have a strange feeling that they hold power within them.

Say, I'm running a little low on the crystals I have here -- think you might be able to collect some more for me?

You'll find yellow crystals to the northwest, red crystals to the... oh, I'm sure you'll figure it out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*7340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I just know I'm onto something here, <name>!

==Completion==
Now I will continue my experiments! Thank you, <name>.

==Progression==
This quest can be completed independently and in any order with the "pylon quest chains" in the zone, but is required for the grand finale quest sequence, which continues with [[The Shaper's Terrace (quest)]].

===Previous progression===
{{classic only-section|patch=4.0.3a}}
This quest existed prior to {{expac|Cataclysm}}, but led into the pylon quests without complex lead-up storylines for each of them.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Replaced by new version in a new quest flow for the ''Cataclysm'' zone revamp.|comment=Players who had completed this previously do not have credit for the new version. This removes access to the repeatable [[power crystals|power crystal]] turn-in quests until the new quest chains are completed.}}
