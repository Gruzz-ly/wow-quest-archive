==Objectives==
Obtain 2 Ravasaur Pheromone Glands.
*[[Ravasaur Pheromone Gland]] (2)

==Description==
I'm actually surprised he has not come for you yet, <name>. But all is well, for I have a final plan that will bring the monster to us.

Being the dominant male gives [[Lar'korwi]] rights to breed with any female he chooses--and he chooses many of them. You'll find many [[ravasaur]] eggs to the west of here. Get close to them and you should provoke an attack by his mates. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed. Bring me two of those glands.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75|}}
*8,330 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be careful, <name>. Getting close to any nest of eggs surely will provoke the mothers... even if you've already secured a gland from one. The mothers can be just as deadly as Lar'korwi himself when they fight to protect their young. But, if you are successful, then we shall have a definitive way of bringing Lar'korwi out from hiding.

==Completion==
Ah, fine specimens, <name>. The two pieces you've found should be perfect for baiting Lar'korwi into the open. I cannot wait to see the outcome of your fight with the monster. He is a massive thing with claws as sharp as the finest blades. You will look into his eyes and you will know death.
