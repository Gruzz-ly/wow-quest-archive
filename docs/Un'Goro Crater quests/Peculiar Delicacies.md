==Objectives==
Obtain 96 Silithid Legs.
*[[Silithid Leg]] (96)

==Description==
Hey <bub/sweetie>, interested in making an extra dime?

I've got it on good authority that some interested parties are paying BIG money for silithid legs. Yes, you heard me right, silithid legs! Apparently these things are delicious if you cook them right. They're like underground lobsters, and they live just south of here.

Thing is, I'll need a good amount of them to pay for my overhead. Think you could get me 8 dozen or so?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75|}}
*7,340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I need a lot of them because I've got to pay for shipping, handling, marketing... oh, and I've got to pay you as well.

==Completion==
Brilliant!  We're on the cusp of something big here, <name>.  Here's your share of the inevitably huge profits.

Now, on to other matters...
