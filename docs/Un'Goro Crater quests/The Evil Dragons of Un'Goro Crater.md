==Objectives==
Help [[Maximillian of Northshire]] slay 15 "Dragons".
*"Dragon" slain  (15)

==Description==
This crater is filled with a malignant breed of [[dragon]]. Have you seen them? They wander all about, parading their spiky backs and lizardy faces all around the Crater.

Don't let them fool you, squire, for these dragons are no minions of graceful [[Alexstrasza]]. They are clearly vicious, and direly in need of a hero's blade.

I have decided that I will slay no less than 15 of them. As my squire, you must come along. Should we become separated, you may meet me back here at the [[Golakka Hot Springs|Hot Springs]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*7,890 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've not yet meted enough justice, squire. You may complain to me only when 15 of the beasts are slayed.

==Completion==
...and that makes 15 of them.

Justice had a name today... and that name was Maximillian of Northshire.  For [[Doloria]]!

==Notes==
Upon accepting this or [[Town Dwellers Were Made to be Saved]], Maximillian will join the player on his horse. He is generally responsible in combat, although he may occasionally aggro nearby neutral monsters like [[elite]] [[Stegodon (mob)|Stegodons]].

;Dialogue

: Come, Squire <name>, for adventure awaits us!

Upon [[aggro]]ing a dinosaur:
: {{text|yell|Maximillian of Northshire|DRAGON!}}
: or
: {{text|yell|Maximillian of Northshire|A DRAGON!}}

While fighting:
: {{text|yell|Maximillian of Northshire|DRAGON, I SHALL RUN YOU THROUGH!}}

He can be spoken to directly:
* {{gossip|I don't see any dragons anywhere.}}
: Nonsense. Have I hired a blind squire? There are dragons everywhere. My neighbor [[Spark Nilminer|Spark]] refers to them as "[[dinosaur]]s", but I know a dragon when I see one. They must be slayed.

* {{gossip|I think I'll adventure alone for a while.}}
: ''<Dismisses Maximillian. He can be found at his his original location.>''

* {{gossip|Maximillian, I am ready for adventure.}}
: ''<Mobilizes Maximillian to follow the player once again, if they have separated.>''
