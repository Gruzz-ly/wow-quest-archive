==Objectives==
The Pylon table allows you to combine blue power crystals with yellow power crystals.

According to [[Crystal Pylon User's Manual|J.D.'s manual]], this combination can be used to create a shield that does damage to enemies.

*[[Blue Power Crystal]] (8)
*[[Yellow Power Crystal]] (6)

==Completion==
Arranging the crystals on the table, you carefully align the colors. As you push the last one into place, a burst of light fuses the crystals together.

The resulting combination is now yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Crystal Spire]] (6)
