==Objectives==
Bring [[:U'cha's Pelt]] to [[Gremix]] at [[Mossy Pile]].

==Description==
Looking around, you see bits of red fur laying around this part of the cave. It appears to match the consistency of gorilla fur.

Based on your conversations with Gremix, you know that he would almost certainly be interested in a red gorilla hide, if you were to obtain one.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Beast Clobberer
|Beastkiller
|Beastflayer
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Red fur?  What're you waiting for!  Go back and get that red gorilla!  I'll pay you double!

==Completion==
Wow, look at this one!  Not just the color, but the size of it... you could cover a tauren with this.

Here you go, <name>.  You've earned this.  Stick around, I'm sure we can find something else for you to do.

==Progression==
