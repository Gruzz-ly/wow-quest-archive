==Objectives==
Report to [[Gremix]] at [[Mossy Pile]].

==Description==
Here in Marshal's Stand, I can't really do too much profiteering without arousing suspicion from the scientists. There is, however, another place where I might have use of you.

My business associate, Gremix, has a camp northwest of here, on the opposite side of the volcano. He's a savvy business mind, and has a better eye for profit than even I do. I'm sure he could put you to work, if you'd like to make some more coin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8}}
*730 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Very well, if Quixxil recommended you, then I suppose you're alright.  In all our years working together, Quixxil's never steered me wrong.

==Progression==
{{A Little Help From My Friends}}
Next: [[Marshal's Refuse]] and [[Adventures in Archaeology]]

==Patch changes==
