'''Hungry, Hungry Hatchling''' is one of several daily quests for the {{item|Whistle of the Venomhide Ravasaur|Venomhide Ravasaur}} mount.

== Objectives ==
Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 15 pieces of Fresh Dinosaur Meat.
* [[Fresh Dinosaur Meat]] fed to [[Venomhide Hatchling]] (15)

== Description ==
The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt.

The drawings are rough, but you can make out the shapes of [[diemetradon]]s, [[stegodon]]s, and [[pterrordax]]es. As the raptor finishes the sketch, it looks up at you, bares its teeth, and makes a biting motion.

Your venomhide hatchling must be craving fresh meat from these animals. Find and kill any type of diematradon, stegodon, or pterrordax in [[Un'Goro Crater]] and feed its meat to your hungry hatchling.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Venomhide Baby Tooth}}

== Progress ==
The venomhide hatchling licks its lips and tilts its head to the side.

== Completion ==
The venomhide hatchling seems satisfied with the giant meal you've provided, but there's no way of telling when it will be hungry again.

==Progression==
{{:Toxic Tolerance}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 3.2.0|note=Added.}}
