[[File:Un'Goro Flat Rock.jpg|thumb|The "Flat Un'Goro Rock" can be seen on the right side of this area. Place the [[Preserved Threshadon Meat]] there.]]

To complete this quest, remove the two items,[[Preserved Pheromone Mixture]] and [[Preserved Threshadon Meat]], from [[Torwa's Pouch]]. Go to the "[[Un'Goro Flat Rock|Flat Un'Goro Rock]]," a small area with giant dinosaur bones located among the eastern mountains of [[Un'Goro Crater]]. More specifically, it is the area behind and east of the [[Eastern Crystal Pylon]]{{coords|79.8|49.8|Un'Goro Crater}}. Use the two items, then kill [[Lar'korwi]]. Loot [[Lar'korwi's Head]] and return to [[Torwa Pathfinder]].

==Objectives==
Using the contents of Torwa's Pouch, summon [[Lar'korwi]] and defeat him. Then bring Lar'korwi's Head to [[Torwa Pathfinder]] near the entrance to [[Un'Goro Crater]].
* [[Lar'korwi's Head]]
* [[Torwa's Pouch]] (provided)

==Description==
This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan. Continue following the river to the north, and look for a bend in the river. It was here I saw Lar'korwi last. You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby.

Take the meat you recovered and place it there. Then, rub this mixture I created on the meat.

If both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Plainstalker Vest|Outrider Chainmail}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|60}}
*9500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do not let fear overpower you, <name>. Fear is the great betrayer... you must remain strong!

==Completion==
The [[Earth Mother]] be praised! You've done it! Fair play to you, <name>. You have proven to be a great hunter in your own right. Your spirit is strong. Your bravery unmatched. And your strength has been fortified. I bow down to your skills.

Only the greatest of my ancestors could have accomplished something so incredible. Congratulations.
