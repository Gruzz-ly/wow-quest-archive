# Un'Goro Crater storyline

[[File:WorldMap-UngoroCrater.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]
'''[[Un'Goro Crater]]''' is a level {{level|Un'Goro Crater}} zone in [[Southern Kalimdor]]. All quests here are neutral and concern exploring the primal wilderness of the crater and its creatures, culminating in a revelation about the purpose of Un'Goro Crater and its connection to the [[titan]]s.

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Un'Goro Crater Quests]].

== Marshal's Stand ==
Optional breadcrumbs:
* [[Tropical Paradise Beckons]]
* [[Hero's Call: Un'Goro Crater!]]
* [[Warchief's Command: Un'Goro Crater!]]

At [[Marshal's Stand]], [[J.D. Collie]] is researching the [[power crystals]] and pylons of the crater. She only offers one quest, but all roads lead back to her for the grand finale.
* [[Crystals of Power]]

[[Nolen Tacker]] also gives an unrelated side quest:
* [[How to Make Meat Fresh Again]]

=== The volcano and the silithid ===
Before venturing to the further reaches of the crater, investigations and a rescue at [[Fire Plume Ridge]] must be performed. This is followed by a move against the [[Slithering Scar]], then a journey to the Mossy Pile where the story diverges toward the pylons.

== Mossy Pile ==
After reaching the [[Mossy Pile]] on the other side of the volcano, a fur hunting expedition ends with crystal pylon contact. A wildlife / engineering mission may be completed at the same time.

=== The Northern Pylon ===
{{The Northern Pylon|link=#Finale: The Shaper's Terrace}}

=== A-Me 01 ===
This chain is given by [[Shizzle]] and [[Karna Remtravel]] at [[Mossy Pile]]. It is independent of the main story but convenient to do along the way.
{{Chasing A-Me 01}}

== Golakka Hot Springs ==
A brief return back to Marshal's Stand reveals that [[Nolen Tacker]] has a friend at the [[Golakka Hot Springs]] who may need assistance, ultimately leading to another pylon. [[Maximillian of Northshire]] has also taken up camp at the springs, where a few of his tasks overlap with the others.

=== The Western Pylon ===
Despite starting in Marshal's Stand, this branch only becomes available after [[Mossy Pile (quest)]].

=== The Ballad of Maximillian ===

== The Eastern Pylon ==
While the breadcrumbs into Un'Goro ultimately lead to Marshal's Stand, players are actually likely to walk right past [[Garl Stormclaw]] and [[Torwa Pathfinder]] first, as they stand directly at the bottom of the path into the crater from [[Tanaris]].
{{The Eastern Pylon}}

=== Ravasaur Trainers ===
Just beyond Garl and Torwa, [[Horde]] players can begin the process of obtaining a [[Whistle of the Venomhide Ravasaur]] mount. This is the equivalent of the Alliance-only [[Winterspring Frostsaber]] earned in [[Winterspring]].
# [[Toxic Tolerance]]
# [[Venomhide Eggs]]
# [[They Grow Up So Fast (Horde)]] (requires completing 20 daily quests, with a random one of the following available each day)
## [[Gorishi Grub (quest)]]
## [[Hungry, Hungry Hatchling]]
## [[Poached, Scrambled, Or Raw?]] ([[Tanaris]])
## [[Searing Roc Feathers]] (Tanaris)

== World object quests ==
Two crates lie in abandoned campsites and can be returned to Marshal's Stand.

From [[Crate of Foodstuffs]] (northeast):
* [[Is This Stuff Still Good?]]

From [[Research Equipment]] (southwest):
* [[An Abandoned Research Camp]]

== Finale: The Shaper's Terrace ==

Afterwards, the player is sent off towards [[Silithus]] via [[The Dunes of Silithus]].
