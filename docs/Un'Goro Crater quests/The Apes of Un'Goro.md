==Objectives==
Bring 2 Un'Goro Gorilla Pelts, 2 Un'Goro Stomper Pelts, and 2 Un'Goro Thunderer Pelts to [[Gremix]] at [[Mossy Pile]]. 
*[[Un'Goro Gorilla Pelt]] (2)
*[[Un'Goro Stomper Pelt]] (2)
*[[Un'Goro Thunderer Pelt]] (2)

The most common location for these apes are noted to be at location 63,17 - also inside the cave as well.

==Description==
There's plenty of money to be had here in Un'Goro, you just need to know where to look!

Apes may be common here in Un'Goro, but they're much rarer up north. In [[Everlook]], a gorilla hide fetches ten times what you'll get for it down here!

I'm not going to send you all the way up to [[Winterspring]] - that'd be irresponsible - but I could use your help actually obtaining some hides.

You'll find gorillas at [[Fungal Rock]], to the northeast, near a waterfall. Don't forget to check inside the cave! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|55|}}
*7340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I never know what style is in vogue, so I'll want a few different colors.  Try to get hides from each different type of gorilla there. 

==Completion==
Wow, 2 of each color!  You're certainly an overachiever, <name>.  My companions and I could use a <race> like you around here.  Ever consider a career in profiteering? 

==Progression==
