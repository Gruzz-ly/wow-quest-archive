==Description==
If you're here to help, then maybe you can help us with a lurking threat.

To the south lies the Slithering Scar, a quivering silithid outpost in the middle of the jungle. You can't miss it.

One of my scouts reports that the silithid are harboring a young colossus in their large central underground chamber, and once it is fully grown, they plan to unleash it upon Un'Goro!

This must not be allowed to pass, <name>. Find the colossus and kill it.
