==Objectives==
The Pylon table allows you to combine [[Red Power Crystal|red power crystal]]s with [[Yellow Power Crystal|yellow power crystal]]s.

According to [[Crystal Pylon User's Manual|J.D.'s manual]], this combination can be used to create a large explosion that can inflict damage on your enemies.
*[[Red Power Crystal]] (6)
*[[Yellow Power Crystal]] (8)

==Completion==
Arranging the crystals on the table, you carefully align the colors. As you push the last one into place, a burst of light fuses the crystals together.

The resulting combination is now yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Crystal Charge]] (6)
