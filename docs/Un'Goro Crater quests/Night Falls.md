==Objectives==
Walk with Estelenn and see what she has to show you.
*Walk with [[Estelenn]]

==Description==
If you'll walk with me, I have one last thing to show you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*660 [[XP]]
*{{cost||39}}
*[[Kestrel]]
*[[Peregrine]]

==Progress==
I promise this won't take long.

==Completion==
It's over at last. Finally, I can rest.

[[Van Amburgh]] killed me some time ago, you see. But I could not pass on while he inflicted such suffering on his animal minions. I had to find someone who understood animals like I did, who lived like I did, and I found you.

I must go, but before I do, I have one last thing for you. I was buried here, and I want you to take my swords, the last thing I left behind.

Go with the green.

==Notes==
Estelenn walks past Van Amburgh's camp to a {{sod|Shallow Grave}}, then turns into a [[wisp]].

==Progression==
{{Tracking the Trapper}}
