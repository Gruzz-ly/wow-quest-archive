==Objectives==
Bring 4 Venomhide Ravasaur Eggs to [[Mor'vek]] in the southeast part of the [[Marshlands]].
*[[Venomhide Ravasaur Egg]] (4)

==Description==
Now that you've built up an immunity to [[Venomhide Ravasaur (mob)|venomhide]] toxin, you can safely handle the animals and their eggs. Venomhides are vicious and must be trained from the moment they hatch.

If you want to ride one, you'll need an unhatched egg. Scattered throughout the Marshlands are a number of ravasaur nests. Look for the eggs with lighter colored shells—those are the ones that will hatch venomhides.

If you bring me several of the eggs, I'll allow you to keep one and raise its [[Venomhide Hatchling|hatchling]], with my guidance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*750 [[XP]] (or {{cost||80}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did you find those eggs?

==Completion==
Good work. Honestly, I'm amazed you were able to find this many. With each clutch, they seem fewer in number.

I'll let you raise one of the freshly-hatched venomhides. It shouldn't be shy about letting you know what it needs.
