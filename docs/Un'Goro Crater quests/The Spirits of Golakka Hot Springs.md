==Objectives==
Stand by as Maximillian of Northshire speaks to 2 [[Steaming Fury|Steam Furies]]. 
* Prayers (2)

==Description==
A moment of seriousness now, <name>. We have an important quest ahead of us. The treacherous dragons that plague this valley will not cease their mischief until we destroy their repugnant brood mother. Before we even attempt to complete such a task, we must ask the Light for aid.

I have seen the Light manifest itself nearby, in the form of Spirits floating by the shores of Golakka Hot Springs. Come, I must speak with them, and ask them for aid. 

==Progress==
We have not completed our prayers. Shall I join you?

==Completion==
Might I ask you a question?  What act have you committed to make the spirits so angry at you?  I'm impressed that you had the patience to sit so still while they pummeled you so violently.

Now we may proceed.  The teeth and scales of Un'Goro's greatest dragon await us. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

==Notes==
The "spirits of the Light" are actually hostile elementals; you must stand still and let them attack you while Maximillian prays to them.

'''First prayer:'''
:{{text|say|Squire! Please stand next to me as I request a blessing of this Light-blessed spirit.}}
:{{text|say|Light, give us the courage we need to defeat the vile broodmother of Un'Goro.}}
:{{text|say|I also ask you to shine your glorious light upon the immaculate face of my lady Doloria.}}
:{{text|say|Finally, I humbly request that you cease venting your hostility 'pon my good squire.}}
:{{text|say|I accept your blessing.}}

'''Second prayer:'''
:{{text|say|Squire! Please stand next to me as I request a blessing of this Light-blessed spirit.}}
:{{text|say|Light, give us the courage we need to enter battle with Un'Goro's corrupted dragons.}}
:{{text|say|I also ask you to sprinkle wildflowers around the feet of my beautiful Doloria, where'er she may walk.}}
:{{text|say|Finally, please find it in your heart to forgive my squire, for I see that you are smiting him.}}
:{{text|say|I accept your blessing.}}

'''If you kill a "spirit":'''
:{{text|say|Squire! I understand you are newly trained, but must I tell you not to kill the spirits of the Light?}}

'''Upon completion:'''
:{{text|say|Let us re-convene by my camp, as friends and fellow heroes, to discuss our final and most dangerous quest. Hup Hup, Pimento!}}
