==Objectives==
Report to [[Garl Stormclaw]] at the entrance to [[Un'Goro Crater]].

==Description==
Zen'Aliri been studyin' the ways of the druid, <race>. Hopefully one day, Zen'Aliri join the Druids of the Talon, and soar over this crater as a storm crow.

But for now, my mentor says I stay here and wait. So Zen'Aliri waits.

I know another druid who might be able to use your help. His name is Garl Stormclaw, and he's somewhere to the east of here, studying reagents. Maybe you go talk to him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8|}}
*705 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Completion==
Zen'Aliri was wise to send you here.  I've hit a dead end in my studies.

==Progression==
{{The Eastern Pylon}}
