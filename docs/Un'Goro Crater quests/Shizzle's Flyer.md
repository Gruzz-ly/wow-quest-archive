==Objectives==
Collect 35 Webbed Pterrordax Scales.
*[[Webbed Pterrordax Scale]] (35)

==Description==
I'm making a [[flying machine]]!

I got stranded here, and I'm absolutely horrible at finding my way around. I'd take a [[gryphon]] or [[wind rider]] back to [[Gadgetzan]], but those beasts just scare me to death.

So, will you help me? All I have left to build is the wings, and I was thinking that the webby scales from the [[pterrordax]] in the [[Screaming Reaches]] to the west would be perfect. There's no way I'm going to go up against one of those, but you look pretty tough. Why don't you give it a try?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shizzle's Nozzle Cleaner
|Shizzle's Muzzle Cover
|Shizzle's Drizzle Stopper
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*7610 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Every great vehicle needs a name... I was thinking I'd call it... Pwned!

==Completion ==
Yes, these scales are perfect. I should be able to get this flyer off the ground with these scales for sure!

Thanks!
