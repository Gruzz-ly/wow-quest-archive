==Objectives==
Lead [[Ringo]] to [[Spraggle Frock]] at [[Marshal's Stand]].

If Ringo feels weak, slap him. If he faints, use Spraggle's Canteen to revive him.
*Escort Ringo to Marshal's Stand
*[[Spraggle's Canteen]] (provided)

==Description==
Ugh... It's so hot...

I was exploring this area, when all of a sudden, the heat just became unbearable. I must be suffering from heat exhaustion.

Please, help me get back to my friend Spraggle at Marshal's Stand. I think I'm well enough to follow you there.

I am feeling a little out of it, so you can slap me if I'm feeling woozy. If I do happen to faint again, just splash some water on me from Spraggle's canteen. That should work, I hope...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Woodland Leggings
|Clayridge Headpiece
|Jeweled Legguards
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*7340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've been so worried about Ringo...

==Completion==
Ringo's not in the best shape, <name>, but I am glad to have him back in one piece!

Thank you for finding him.

==Notes==
;Start cutscene
:{{Text|say|Ringo|Well, I'm not sure how far I'll make it in this state... I'm feeling kind of faint...}}
:{{Text|say|Ringo|Remember, if I faint again, the water that Spraggle gave you will revive me.}}

During the quest, Ringo must be guided from [[Fire Plume Ridge]] to [[Marshal's Stand]]. During the escort, Ringo is likely to collapse from heat exhaustion several times, at which point Spraggle's canteen will need to be used.

As he collapses, Ringo says one of the following messages:
*{{Text|say|Ringo|The heat... I can't take it...}}
*{{Text|say|Ringo|Maybe... you could carry me?}}
*{{Text|say|Ringo|Uuuuuuggggghhhhh....}}
*{{Text|say|Ringo|I'm not feeling so well...}}

As Ringo regains consciousness, he will say one of the following messages:
*{{Text|say|Ringo|Where... Where am I?}}
*{{Text|say|Ringo|I am feeling a little better now, thank you.}}
*{{Text|say|Ringo|Yes, I must go on.}}
*{{Text|say|Ringo|How am I feeling? Quite soaked, thank you.}}

:{{Text|say|Spraggle Frock|Ringo! You're okay!}}
:{{Text|say|Ringo|Oh... I'm feeling faint...}}
:{{Text|emote|Ringo collapses onto the ground}}
:{{Text|emote|Ringo stands up after a short pause}}
:{{Text|say|Ringo|Ugh.}}
:{{Text|say|Spraggle Frock|Ringo? Wake up! Don't worry, I'll take care of you.}}
