==Objectives==
Bring 8 Dinosaur Bones to [[Spark Nilminer]] in Un'Goro Crater. 
*[[Dinosaur Bone]] (8)

==Description==
You'd think that being chief digger for Marshal Expeditions means I like digging. There might be worse things to do in this world... but none really leap to mind.

We were supposed to be digging in Terror Run - FANTASTIC name by the way - for dead stegodons and diemetradons. Well, there are plenty of live ones there too! Wil and Hol are still all about studying this death trap, so we need those dinosaur bones. Between you and me though, bringing some from live ones will work out just as well. 

==Progress==
Think whatever you want of me, but they're not going to care if the bones they get to research are from ancient stegodons and diemetradons or the ones that almost devoured us wholesale when we were trying to set up our camps.  I'll just be happy if we get out of here alive... 

==Rewards==

==Completion==
Excellent, these should do the trick.  And now, if you'll permit me, in case anyone's listening...

THANKS FOR DIGGING ALL OF THESE BONES OUT OF THE GROUND FOR US AND NOT HURTING THE NATIVE BEASTS IN ANY WAY.

Whether you really did or didn't, I don't want to know.  Let's keep it that way, shall we?  Here - maybe this will keep your lips shut on the whole thing.  Anything to get out of here alive, I say! 

==Notes==
The bones can be collected directly from objects on the ground ''or'' live dinosaurs; the live source does not have a 100% drop rate. A number of bones can be found in one place around the threshadon corpse on the south end of [[Terror Run]]. (This corpse is present on the zone map for Un'goro Crater - not a quest objective marker, but the zone map graphic itself.)
