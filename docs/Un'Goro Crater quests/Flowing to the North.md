==Objectives==
Report to [[Ithis Moonwarden]] in the [[Roiling Gardens]].

==Description==
Ithis Moonwarden is the night elf druid who indoctrinated me into the Cenarion Circle. He has set up camp north of here, near the cliffs of the crater's easternmost edge. Follow the flow of the Bloodpetal seeds, and I'll wager you'll find him nearby.

My studies are limited only to seeds and other reagents, but he pursues more advanced matters. If you are curious to learn more about Un'Goro's flora, you should speak with him now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8|}}
*705 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Completion==
Ahh... did Garl send you?  How are his studies coming?  I find that he can be a bit slow at times, but he's truly a force to be reckoned with when he takes the form of the bear.

Now, we have more pressing matters to attend to.
