* [[Research Equipment]] ''(provided)''

==Description==
You find what appears to be a piece of research equipment, left behind when this camp was abandoned. Chiseled onto the side of the device are the words "PROPERTY OF MARSHAL EXPADISHUNS".

Perhaps you might find someone who could use this? 

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
Well I'll be... that's Shizzle's old portable dinomometer!  Where did you find this?

I'm surprised it's still functional, even after all these years.  I'll have it delivered to Shizzle promptly.
