==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Williden Marshal}} at [[Marshal's Stand]] in [[Un'Goro Crater]].

==Description==
By order of his royal highness, {{NPC||Varian Wrynn||King Varian Wrynn}}, all able-bodied citizens of the [[Alliance]] are to report to Williden Marshal at Marshal's Stand.

The Alliance needs you to provide support to the [[Marshal Expeditions]] as they uncover the secrets of Un'Goro Crater's ancient beasts, unique flora, and powerful crystals. You can reach the crater by departing western [[Tanaris]] and following the road all the way to Marshal's Stand. 

For the glory and honor of the Alliance!

==Completion==
My team of explorers, researchers, and scientists is the finest in Azeroth, but we need all the help we can get to discover the truth about the crater's history and its denizens.
