==Objectives==
Touch the [[Eastern Crystal Pylon]] in [[Un'Goro Crater]].
*Discover and examine the [[Eastern Crystal Pylon]]
*Report to [[J.D. Collie]] at [[Marshal's Stand]].

==Description==
High up in the cliffs above me there is a large crystal pylon. Who placed it there, I cannot say, nor can I determine any reason that it would be built in such a strange place.

Maybe you can make more of it than I can. I personally don't care what it does, so you needn't report back to me, but perhaps one of the scholars in Marshal's Stand might be interested in what you discover.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*7610 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have something to share with me, <name>?

==Completion==
You were right to bring this pylon to my attention, <name>.  This is just the sort of thing I've been studying.

==Notes==
* The pylon can be found up on the cliffside in the middle of the eastern wall of the crater, next to a graveyard.{{coords|77|49|Un'Goro Crater}} It is visible from the crater floor, but unlike the other pylons, is difficult to walk or jump up to since the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]]. Luckily Ithis Moonwarden teleports the player up to the plateau upon acceptance of this quest.

==Progression==

===Previous progression===
{{classic only-section|patch=4.0.3a}}
The pylon quests existed prior to {{expac|Cataclysm}}, but had a much less involved lead-up storyline, and were given directly by [[J.D. Collie]].

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Replaced by new version in a new quest chain for the ''Cataclysm'' zone revamp.|comment=Players who had completed this previously do not have credit for the new version. This removes access to the repeatable [[power crystals|power crystal]] turn-in quests until the new quest chain is completed.}}
