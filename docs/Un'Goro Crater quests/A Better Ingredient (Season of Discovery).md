==Objectives==
Retrieve a Putrid Vine from the guardian at the bottom of the [[Sunken Temple (Season of Discovery)|Sunken Temple]] and return to [[Torwa Pathfinder]].
*[[Putrid Vine]]

==Description==
It is as I feared—the toxin is simply too weak for such a powerful creature.

If we are to create a toxin of high enough potency, you must venture to the bottom of the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Temple of Atal'Hakkar]], unlock the secrets of the altar and recover a putrid vine from the guardian there. The temple is dangerous, and it would behoove you to bring friends.

Return to me when this is done. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Grizzled Pelt]]
*[[Forest's Embrace]]
*[[Moonshadow Stave]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the vine?

==Completion==
At last, the toxin can be created in full.  I dare not require you to inflict it upon the creature again, as I have asked too much already.

You have my thanks and respect.  May you be well in your travels, <name>.
