Kill [[Durrin Direshovel]] and obtain Durrin's Archaeological Findings.
*[[Durrin's Archaeological Findings]]

==Description==
Hey wait a minute, this bone has pickax marks on it. These aren't yours, are they? No, I recognize this mark... this must be that blasted dwarf! Gah!

Let me step back for a minute and explain. There's another archaeologist south of here named Durrin Direshovel. He practices a reckless, devil-may-care brand of archaeology that offends even me.

A priceless fossil, ruined by sloppy pick-work. This is the last straw, Durrin!

<Name>, go put an end to Direshovel and his negligent excavation.

*12,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is the deed done?  Did you manage to salvage his notes?

==Completion==
I knew it!  Durrin HAS been digging around here.  And he's been excavating what could be the archaeological find of the century!  Now I just have to find out where he's stashing the bones...

Thanks <name>.  You've been a great help.
