==Objectives==
Slay 15 Crushridge Warmongers, then return to [[Marshal Redpath]] in [[Southshore]].
*[[Crushridge Warmonger]] slain (15)

==Description==
Now that you've had a taste of the [[Crushridge]] [[ogre]]s, I want you to really bloody their noses...

Go into the [[Ruins of Alterac]] and seek out the Crushridge Warmongers. I want you to cut down a good number of them - that's the only way those brutes will learn to keep their distance from [[Alliance]] territory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4700 XP (or {{cost||28|20}} at max level)
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Burning Sliver]]
*[[Lunar Buckler]]

==Progress==
You have more Warmongers to slay, <name>.  You should be up on the mountains on your task, not down here with your weapon stowed.

==Completion==
Very good. Here is your reward.

And when you were hunting those Warmongers, how did Alterac city look? It's in bad shape I would guess. Ogres are not known for their cleanliness.

Thankfully, your efforts will help keep them away from Southshore.
