'''Taretha's Gift''' is the final quest in a Horde quest chain in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] and [[Alterac Mountains]]. It involves returning a memento of [[Taretha Foxton]], [[Thrall]]'s childhood friend, to the possession of the orcs. You must have completed [[Lord Aliden Perenolde]] in order to get this quest.

==Objectives==
Return Taretha's pendant to [[Krusk]] in [[Tarren Mill]].
*[[Taretha's Necklace]] (provided)

==Description==
The pendant?  Of course you can have it...  Take it!  I want no memory of [[Lord Aliden Perenolde|him]]... just please, please leave in peace...

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of the following:
|Mantis Boots
|Brigand's Pauldrons}}

You will also receive:
*3,900 [[XP]]
*{{Classicquestrep|150|350|Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar}}

==Progress==
You've returned, <name>.  Success to report?

==Completion==
It is strange that [[Thrall|the Warchief]] would expend so much over such a small thing.  I do not claim to understand him, but I will follow him, whatever his commands.  You did well, <name>, no doubt the Warchief will be glad to hear of your success.
