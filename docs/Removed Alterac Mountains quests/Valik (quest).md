==Objectives==
Bring a mug of Southshore Stout to [[Valik]] in the [[Syndicate]] camp.
*[[Southshore Stout]]

==Description==
Urrgh... Injured and dying and confronted with the enemy.

No doubt you'll kill me anyway, but if you bring me some Southshore stout—your kind does drink, don't they?--I'll tell you what you want to know.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Syndicate Missive
}}

You will also gain:
*310 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|80}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Did you bring me something to drink or did you just come back to finish the job?

==Completion==
Given my impending death, I think I can safely say that this is the sweetest tasting thing ever... Here, take this, won't do me any good when I'm dead.

Well, get on with it!
