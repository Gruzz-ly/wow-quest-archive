'''The Summoning''' is the 3rd quest in the '''The Windwatcher''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Bring the Whirlwind Heart to [[Bath'rah the Windwatcher|Bath'rah Windwatcher]].
*[[Whirlwind Heart]]

==Description==
I am ready to perform the ritual to summon [[Cyclonian]].  When he is summoned, you must defeat him and take his whirlwind heart.  This I will use to instill a weapon with Cyclonian's power.

<Name>, are you ready to face the wind lord?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||19|80}} at level 70)

==Progress==
<Name>, I must have the whirlwind heart!

==Completion==
You did it!  You defeated Cyclonian and gained the Whirlwind Heart!

==Notes==
'''The Summoning''' is a final showdown ([[Warrior]]-only) [[quest]] with a level 40 [[elite]] [[elemental]] who has some nasty stun spells. You set it up by turning in the quest with Bath'rah the Windwatcher and then following him over to the nearby Easter-Island-style head. If you are slaughtered in your first (or any subsequent) attempt, just abandon the quest out of your log and go back to Bath'rah the Windwatcher's little hut again. Help from friends ''recommended''.

==Progression==
{{Whirlwind Weapon}}
