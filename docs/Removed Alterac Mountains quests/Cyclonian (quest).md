'''Cyclonian''' is the 2nd quest in the '''The Windwatcher''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Bring the items on Bath'rah's Parchment to [[Bath'rah the Windwatcher]] in [[Alterac Mountains|Alterac]].
*[[Liferoot]] (8)
*[[Bloodscalp Tusk]] (30)
*[[Essence of the Exile]]
*[[Bath'rah's Parchment]] (provided)

==Description==
I have spent ages watching this site.  I watch, so that one day I might see the great [[Cyclonian]] fall.  But I have not yet found a champion to defeat the wind lord.

Perhaps you are that champion.

Prove it to me.  Gather the items I need to summon Cyclonian, and I will know you are a great [[warrior]].  Perhaps then you can defeat him and gain his whirlwind heart.

If so, then I will infuse the heart's power in a weapon, and I will give that weapon to you.

Here is a parchment with the items I need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||19|80}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Do you have the items, <name>? &nbsp;Gathering them is the proof I need that you have the strength to face Cyclonian.

==Completion==
You have gathered the items for my spell, and have shown me your strength and cunning. &nbsp;But the next stage of our quest is even more perilous.

Let us hope your strength does not falter.

==Notes==
The Essence of the Exile is created by adding the Charms from the [[Arathi Highlands]] to the pot near the quest giver.

==Progression==
{{Whirlwind Weapon}}
