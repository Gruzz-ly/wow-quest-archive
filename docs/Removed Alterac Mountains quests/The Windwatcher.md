'''The Windwatcher''' is the 1st quest in the '''The Windwatcher''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bath'rah the Windwatcher]].

==Description==
Now that you've learned your berserker's stance, you'll want a nice weapon to use it with.

Talk to Bath'rah the Windwatcher, a [[Jungle troll|troll]] hermit who lives between the [[Alterac Mountains]] and the [[Western Plaguelands]].  He is a skilled weapon maker and a powerful [[shaman]].

To find Bath'rah, go to the river that flows along [[Tarren Mill]]'s eastern flank.  Follow it north—Bath'rah is camped near ruins that rest along the river's eastern bank.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|50}} at max level)

==Completion==
You have traveled far, young <class>.  I see fire in your eyes.  You seek a weapon of great power, yes?

I can help you with your quest.  And you can help me with mine.

==Progression==
{{Whirlwind Weapon}}
