'''Gol'dir''' is a Horde quest in a quest chain that takes place in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] and [[Alterac Mountains]]. It involves finding and freeing a captive orc from the [[Syndicate]]. 

==Objectives==
Free [[Gol'dir]] then return to [[Krusk]] in [[Tarren Mill]].
* [[Rusted Iron Key]]
*Find where Gol'dir is being held

==Description==
From what I can tell of the documents you procured, Gol'dir is being held in a large [[Syndicate]] base to the north, most likely in the [[Alterac Mountains]]. He has been held captive far too long and must be freed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,800 [[XP]]
*{{Classicquestrep|100|250|Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar}}

==Progress==
Give me the key, <class>, I will undo the lock myself.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I led the expedition from [[Durotar]] under the [[Thrall|Warchief]]'s orders, but as you can see, our plans went somewhat awry. They have held me captive here in [[Strahnbrad|this town]], forcing me to work, hauling burdens, digging...

What I have suffered is unimportant, however. There is important information you must deliver to whomever is leading our group now.

==Notes==
*Though the objective tells you to return to Krusk, you don't actually need to talk to him after getting the quest. You return to him in the next quest, which Gol'dir gives you.
*Gol'dir is being held in the top room in the inn in [[Strahnbrad]]. The building is packed with Syndicate, so it may be best to run through, finish the quest and accept the next one quickly, and run out again. Alternatively, you can die in the building and rez right next to him.
*[[Jailor Borhuin]] holds the key. He can be in any of the buildings in Strahnbrad.
