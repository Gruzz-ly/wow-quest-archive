'''Blackmoore's Legacy''' is a Horde quest in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] and [[Alterac Mountains]]. It is part of a quest line involving the [[Syndicate]]. You must have completed [[Gol'dir]] in order to get this quest.

==Objectives==
Return the information gathered by [[Gol'dir]] to [[Krusk]] in [[Tarren Mill]].

==Description==
A day or two ago, I was visited by the leader of this Syndicate. His name was [[Aliden Perenolde]], and styled himself lord of this land. He confided in me his plans to take the [[orc]]s that stood against him as [[slave]]s, just as his father and his mentor, the despised [[Blackmoore]], had planned.

More important was that he brought his mistress, a wisp of a girl named [[Elysa]]. Around her neck was [[Taretha's Necklace|the pendant]] the [[Thrall|Warchief]] desires.

Now go, I will make my own way, after I have settled my business here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*2100 [[XP]]
*{{Classicquestrep|75|150|Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar}}

==Completion==
The nerve of those overbearing [[human]]s! We'll show them the orcs shall never submit to their will!

This will now be our mission, in addition to recovering the trinket the Warchief desires. It would seem that by accomplishing one, we will also accomplish the other.

==Progression==
#[[The Rescue]]
#[[Infiltration (Classic)]]
#[[Gol'dir (quest)]]
#[[Blackmoore's Legacy]]
#[[Lord Aliden Perenolde (quest)]]
#[[Taretha's Gift]]
