==Objectives==
Return [[Vorrel Sengutz]]'s wedding ring to [[Monika Sengutz]] in [[Tarren Mill]].
* [[Vorrel's Wedding Ring]]

==Description==
Even though my will is free, I can serve the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]] no more. I feel my time on [[Azeroth]] has come to an end. My life force is shattered.

[[Interrogator Vishas]] did this to me! Tortured me for weeks! Took my wedding ring and gave it to his wife. The monster!

Revenge... I want revenge!

The pompous fool bragged about his precious wife, [[Nancy Vishas|Nancy]], who lived along [[Lake Lordamere]]. Track the wench down, slay her and return my wedding ring to my wife, Monika in Tarren Mill.

Heed my last wishes....

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

*4350 [[XP]] (or a {{cost||26|40}} compensation at level 80)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
What do you want, stranger?

==Completion==
Vorrel led such a troubled existence. And what a good mate he was...

Damn those filthy humans!

Vorrel is gone, never to enjoy undeath again. At least I can take solace in the revenge you took in his name. For that I thank you.

Now let me be to mourn....

==Notes==
Nancy Vishas is a 33 elite. She is found with [[Grandpa Vishas]], a level 34 elite. Both are found in a small house next to a pier at {{co|32|32|Hillsbrad Foothills}} in [[Alterac Mountains]].
