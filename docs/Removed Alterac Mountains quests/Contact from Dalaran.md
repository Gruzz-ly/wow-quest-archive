'''Contact from Dalaran''' is the first quest in the chain that eventually leads to your acquiring [[The Master's Key]], which you need to enter [[Karazhan (raid)|Karazhan]]. This quest becomes available to you after you complete [[Arcane Disturbances]] and [[Restless Activity]] from the questgiver.

==Objectives==
Bring [[Alturus's Report]] to [[Archmage Cedric]] on the outskirts of [[Dalaran Crater]].
*[[Alturus' Report]] (provided)

==Description==
These signs do not bode well for us, <name>. I've never been one for secrecy so I will tell you a bit about my organization, [[The Violet Eye]].

We are agents of the Kirin Tor, the [[Magus Senate of Dalaran]]. We were assigned to keep an eye on Karazhan and Medivh, in case things got out of hand.

Which they did...very quickly, after Medivh disappeared.

This report details my findings. Take it to [[Archmage Cedric]], also from the Violet Eye; you will find him in the outskirts of [[Dalaran Crater]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 6250 XP
* +75 reputation with the [[Violet Eye]]

==Progress==
You know of the Violet Eye? You do not look familiar.

==Completion==
Alturus entrusted you with this information? That old fool.

I suppose the damage is done, we might as well make use of you. I suppose you will cooperate?

==Progression==
{{Arcane Disturbances}}
