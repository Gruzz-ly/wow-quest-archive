This quest is started by the [[Assassin's Contract]], dropped by the [[Shadowy Assassin]] in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Assassin's Contract to Magistrate Maleb in [[Southshore]].
*[[Assassin's Contract]] (provided)

==Description==
This is a contract for the assassination of [[Magistrate Henry Maleb]]. It was sealed and stamped in red wax, using a distinctive signet ring.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|20}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
You look out of breath!  Do you have something to report?

==Completion==
<Maleb inspects the contract.>

That explains the latest attack on [[Southshore]].  The Syndicate must be after me, just as they were the last magistrate!

==Progression==
