This quest appears as part of the [[Love is in the Air]] [[event]].

==Objectives==
Find [[Apothecary Staffron Lerent]] in the [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] behind [[Ravenholdt Manor]].

==Description==
What? Treason? No, no. I assure you, my intentions are completely harmless.

Is it so wrong to help those who wish to ease the painful ritual of courtship? Come, that is no crime.

And to prove I mean no harm, I will even tell you my source.

They were shipped to me by a [[Apothecary Staffron Lerent|Staffron Lerent]], an apothecary of some sort. I never spoke with him.

Our goblin middle man said he worked in the [[Hillsbrad Foothills|foothills over Hillsbrad]] past that mysterious [[Ravenholdt Manor]]. I wish you luck in finding him.

==Completion==
Yes, I made those fragrances. Wonderful smell, isn't it? Irresistible.

Once the warriors of the [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] alike are smitten with these feelings of love, they will be powerless to stop the rise of the [[Shadow Council]].

They will be weakened, unprepared. As they worry for their loved ones, they will lose their edge.

The solution was so simple. Why did it take me so long to come up with it? The weakness of all is through the heart. And there is nothing you can do to stop the inevitable.

==Notes==
Fly to [[Southshore]]. Run to {{Raidicon|Star}}{{coords|75.4|23.3|Hillsbrad Foothills}} north of [[Durnholde Keep]]. Follow the path up to the cave entrance at {{Raidicon|Circle}}{{coords|77.7|19.6|Hillsbrad Foothills}}. Take a right in front of [[Ravenholdt Manor]] and head south towards {{Raidicon|Diamond}}{{coords|84.3|84.3|Hillsbrad Foothills}} (now that you're in [[Alterac Mountains]]...) to see a path leading south. At {{Raidicon|Triangle}}{{coords|85.8|26.0|Hillsbrad Foothills}} take a left and head north. Back in Alterac Mountains yet again is [[Apothecary Staffron Lerent]] at [[File:ActiveQuestIcon.png]]{{coords|89.4|74.7|Hillsbrad Foothills}}.

:{{text|say|Apothecary Staffron Lerent|Annalise? Is that you?}}
:{{text|say|Annalise Lerent|My dear Staffron, have you forgotten what it is to love? The love that we once shared?}}
:{{text|say|Apothecary Staffron Lerent|Have I forgotten? Of course I have... I have forgotten about love, happiness... of life itself.}}
:{{text|say|Apothecary Staffron Lerent|But I do know this - love makes the heart and body weak. It can be exploited. Without your love, I have only my work, Annalise.}}
:{{text|say|Annalise Lerent|But of course I love you, Staffron. And it pains me to see you suffer so.}}
:{{text|say|Annalise Lerent|I pledge my love to you forever. Death cannot erase that, even as I am sure that you still remember your love for me.}}
:{{text|say|Annalise Lerent|And if you do not, then I am truly lost.}}
:{{text|say|Apothecary Staffron Lerent|How could you love me Annalise? Look at me. I am not the man you once knew.}}
:{{text|say|Apothecary Staffron Lerent|Annalise? Annalise! No, don't leave me!}}
:{{text|say|Apothecary Staffron Lerent|Annalise... You're right. I-I can't do this. I must find another way.}}
:{{text|say|Apothecary Staffron Lerent|You there. You're welcome to take the contents of my cauldron. It was to be the second stage of my plan - amorous clothing.}}
