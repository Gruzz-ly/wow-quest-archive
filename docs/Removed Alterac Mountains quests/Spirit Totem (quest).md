==Objectives==
Bring the pieces for the spirit totem to [[Bath'rah the Windwatcher]].
* [[Bloodshot Spider Eye]] (8)
* [[Thick Black Claw]] (8)

==Description==
The [[elemental spirit]]s of this place don't be likin' me any more.

You know about the totems more than any, and I be needin' a spirit totem to protect me. We already got the elements, now we need somethin' more with more nature. More primal.

In the [[Western Plaguelands]] you can kill [[bear]]s for claws and [[spider]]s for their eyes. The [[carrion bird]]s eat everything, so they might have either one. 

==Progress==
The spirits know what we're up to, and they been tryin' to kill me!  I hope you got the parts. 

==Completion==
Great, mon!  Let's try it out.... 

==Notes==
*Bloodshot Spider Eyes come from: [[Plague Lurker]]s, [[Carrion Lurker]]s, [[Venom Mist Lurker]], and [[Carrion Vulture]]s.
*Thick Black Claws come from: [[Diseased Black Bear]]s, [[Diseased Grizzly|Diseased Grizzlies]], and [[Carrion Vulture]]s.
