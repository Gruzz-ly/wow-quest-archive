'''Lord Aliden Perenolde''' is a Horde quest in [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] and [[Alterac Mountains]] that involves killing the leader of the [[Syndicate]], [[Lord Aliden Perenolde]]. You must have completed [[Blackmoore's Legacy]] before you can get this quest.

==Objectives==
Kill Lord Aliden Perenolde and ask his mistress, [[Elysa]], about [[Taretha Foxton|Taretha]]'s [[Taretha's Necklace|pendant]].
* [[Lord Aliden Perenolde]] slain

==Description==
It is clear that Perenolde must be killed, his foulness removed from [[Azeroth|the world]]. His manor lies a ways to the north of here, on the shores of [[Lordamere Lake]]. Do your duty, <name>, then retrieve the pendant that the [[Thrall|Warchief]] desires, and return here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 4,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
W-what do you want?

==Completion==
No, no please don't hurt me! I never meant your people any harm, he's had me against my will! Please... spare me!

==Notes==
Lord Perenolde is in the house at [[Dandred's Fold]] in the upstairs room. It's an easy fight. The mobs that lead up to him are harder than he is.
