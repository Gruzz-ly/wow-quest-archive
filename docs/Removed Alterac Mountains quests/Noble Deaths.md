==Objectives==
Bring 7 Alterac Signet Rings to [[Magistrate Henry Maleb|Magistrate Maleb]] in [[Southshore]].
*[[Alterac Signet Ring]] (7)

==Description==
I fear the leadership behind the [[Syndicate]] is bent on Southshore's ruin. We must strike hard at these leaders before their plans are realized.

Enter the ruins of [[Strahnbrad]], in the {{C|Alterac Mountains}} to the north. We think the Syndicate is using the area as a headquarters.

We know this gang of cutthroats is run by former Alterac nobles. They may be hiding as normal Syndicate agents, but you'll know you've killed a noble by the signet ring he wears.

Bring me those signet rings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||40}}
* 280-2800 [[XP]]
*{{Classicquestrep|100|250|Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind}}

==Progress==
Have you been hunting the Syndicate? Do you have those rings?

==Completion==
Stripping the Syndicate of its nobility will remove its ability to act decisively, and reduce it to nothing more than a gang of thugs.

You serve your Alliance well, <name>.
