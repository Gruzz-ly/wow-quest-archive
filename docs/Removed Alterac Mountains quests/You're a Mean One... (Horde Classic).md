==Objectives==
Locate and return the Stolen Treats to [[Kaymard Copperpinch]] in [[Orgrimmar]]. It was last thought to be in the possession of [[the Abominable Greench]], found somewhere in the snowy regions of the {{Classic|Alterac Mountains}}.
*[[Stolen Treats]]

==Description==
A c-c-creature called "The Abominable Greench" is the one w-w-who stole our shipment of t-t-treats, <name>. Be c-c-careful though! He is t-t-the one who turned me into this s-s-snowy mess!

You're g-g-gonna need some help in f-f-facing him. I've seen him w-w-wander all around [[Growless Cave|where]] the [[Yeti|y-y-yeti]] are; he's s-s-surely here s-s-somewhere! F-f-find the treats <name>, take them b-b-back to [[Smokywood Pastures]] in [[Orgrimmar]], and t-t-tell them I n-n-need to be unfrozen!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Name> - our Feast of Winter Veil will be ruined without those treats to restock! [[Graccu]] himself will miss out on sharing his delicious [[Graccu's Homemade Meat Pie|meat pies]] with all the good boys and girls this season...

==Completion==
You found it! You've saved Smokywood Pasture's{{Sic}} Feast of Winter Veil!

Poor Sacks... we'll be sure to send a team out there and figure out a way to unfreeze him. Hopefully, he'll be back in time for the day of the Feast; he'll need to make up missed time working though. Still, this wouldn't even be possible if it weren't for you!
