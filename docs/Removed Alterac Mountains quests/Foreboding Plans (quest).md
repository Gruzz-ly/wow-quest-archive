==Objective==
Bring the Foreboding Plans to [[Magistrate Henry Maleb|Magistrate Maleb]] in [[Southshore]].
*[[Foreboding Plans]] (provided)

==Description==
Among these documents is a list of requested supplies. These include mundane items (food, weapons, clothing) as well as more exotic gear (masks, oil, poison).

But what is most notable is the urgency of the request - these supplies were needed soon in order to undertake what is described in the document as an "important mission against Southshore."

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*140-1350 [[XP]]
*{{Classicquestrep|50|75|Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind}}

==Progress==
<Name>, you look anxious. Is there something you wish to tell me?

==Completion==
<Maleb reads the documents.>

These are very troubling, <name>. From the information in these documents, and from the Syndicate's actions in the past, we must assume that band of cutthroats has waged war on Southshore.
