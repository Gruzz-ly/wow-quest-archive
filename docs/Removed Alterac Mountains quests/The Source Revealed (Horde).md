'''The Source Revealed''' is a quest starting in [[Undercity]]. It is only available during the [[Love is in the Air]] holiday.

==Objectives==
Find [[Apothecary Staffron Lerent]] in the [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] past [[Ravenholdt Manor]].

==Description==
Look, the actions of a rogue apothecary are not my concern. If he's undermining our efforts, then let me be the first to point you in the right direction

If he's innocent, then he's got nothing to hide, right?

I purchased the goods from Apothecary Staffron Lerent. He's working in a secluded area past Ravenholdt Manor in the hills over Hillsbrad. To be honest with you, I thought he was a little odd.

==Completion==
Yes, I made those fragrances. Wonderful smell, isn't it? Irrestible.

Once the warriors of the Alliance and Horde alike are smitten with these feelings of love, they will be powerless to stop the rise of the Shadow Council.

They will be weakened, unprepared. As they worry for their loved ones, they will lose their edge.

The solution was so simple. Why did it take me so long to come upon it? The weakness of all is through the heart. And there is nothing you can do to stop the inevitable.

==Notes==

Fly to [[Tarren Mill]]. Run to north of [[Durnholde Keep]]. Follow the path up to the cave entrance. Take a right in front of [[Ravenholdt Manor]] and head south to see a path leading south. Take a left and head north. Back in Alterac Mountains yet again is [[Apothecary Staffron Lerent]].

;Upon completion
''This dialog happens between [[Apothecary Staffron Lerent]] and the ghost of his wife, [[Annalise Lerent]], after completing this quest.''

:{{text|say|Apothecary Staffron Lerent|Annalise... You're right. I-I can't do this. I must find another way.}}
:{{text|say|Apothecary Staffron Lerent|You there. You're welcome to take the contents of my cauldron. It was to be the second stage of my plan - amorous clothing.}}
