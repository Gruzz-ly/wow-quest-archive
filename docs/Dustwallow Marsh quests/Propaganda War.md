==Objectives==
Obtain the [[Deserter Propaganda]] from the boat at the end of the [[Theramore]] docks.

==Description==
The deserter agents were doing far more than just chatting up the guards. We've found a number of leaflets the deserters somehow managed to smuggle in on a ship in the docks.

The ship used to transport leaflets is still in [[Theramore]], at the farthest dock. If you can sneak aboard and capture the rest of their propaganda documents, their agents will lose their most powerful tool. Be careful! The ship is manned by seasoned privateers and the cargo is probably being kept in the captain's quarters.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|s=35}}
* 3500 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Did you manage to find and capture the remaining propaganda leaflets?

==Completion==
<The [[SI:7]] agent nods in approval.>

Excellent. All that remains is to discredit the deserters so that they'll never gain a foothold in Theramore again, and I have just the plan to do it.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|say|Calia Hastings|It would be a shame to let these leaflets go to waste, wouldn't it?}}
