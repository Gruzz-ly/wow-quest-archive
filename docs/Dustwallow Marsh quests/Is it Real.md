==Objectives==
Talk to [[Nat Pagle]] at [[Nat's Landing]] in [[Tidefury Cove]].

==Description==
Oh, I'm sure you and [[Babs Fizzletorque|Babs]] had a good laugh over the outlandish descriptions and sketches in the book, but have you stopped to consider there might be some truth to the legends?

If you listen carefully enough, I bet you can still hear sailors talk about Tethyr, the sea creature the book says lives right here! Of course, if you wanted to know for sure, you could always ask old [[Nat Pagle]].

He's got a small fishing camp on a little island in [[Tidefury Cove]], which is southwest across [[Dustwallow Bay]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So you want to know about sea monsters? Hmm... well, I'll make you a deal, but it's going to involve a lot of alcohol and some embarrassment on your part.

==Progression==
{{This Old Lighthouse}}
