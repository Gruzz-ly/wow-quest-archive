==Objectives==
Use [[Tabetha]]'s Torch to burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at [[Direhorn Post]].
* North Tent Burned
* Northeast Tent Burned
* East Tent Burned
* [[Tabetha's Torch]] (Provided)

==Description==
There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new "neighbors" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the [[Shady Rest Inn]], as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer.

Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm. You can't miss it, really, as the [[Grimtotem]]s have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|s=45}}

==Progress==
Have you put that torch to good use?

==Completion==
The Grimtotems should have no trouble understanding our latest message.

As for you, your contact at [[Brackenwall Village]] will want to know of your success. If I know him, he'll appreciate the taste of vengeance.

==Original version==
{{rfg-section|4.0.3a}}
;Completion
As for you, your contact at Brackenwall Village will want to know of your success. I know the destruction of the Shady Rest Inn could be a source of tensions between the [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]]. If I encounter and investigators from [[Theramore]], I will gladly tell them the Grimtotems acted on their own.

==Progression==
{{Return to Krog}}
