==Objectives==
[[Captain Darill]] at [[North Point Tower]] wants you to bring him 7 Blackhoof Armaments.
* [[Blackhoof Armaments]] (7)

==Description==
If the [[Black Shield|equipment]] you found at the ruins of the [[Shady Rest Inn|inn]] belonged to a [[Grimtotem]] attack party, there's likely to be more just like it within their camp to the northwest.

We haven't been able to gather much information about [[Blackhoof Village]], but judging from the size of the raiding parties, there's a substantial force based there.

Do whatever you have to to capture some of their equipment so that we can compare it with your findings from the inn.

==Progress==
Did you get those weapons from Blackhoof Village?

==Completion==
<Captain Darill inspects the armaments you've brought from Blackhoof Village.>

There's not doubt about it. These match the description exactly, but there's just one problem—these have never been used in battle. Blackhoof Village must not be the only Grimtotem post in the marsh.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Glowing Tourmaline Ring
|Bone Dirk
|Biting Greataxe
}}

You will also receive: {{cost|s=45}}
and 3900 [[XP]]
