==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bragok]] in [[Ratchet]] to fly to [[Theramore]]. Then report to [[Calia Hastings]].

==Description==
Listen, I got no special love for the [[Alliance]]... but then again, I got no real hate for you guys either.

Your gold is as good as anyone else's. Sometimes better.

[[Corporal Jeyne|Jeyne]] left some gold for your travel costs. I believe the person you're looking for in [[Dustwallow Marsh|Dustwallow]] goes by the name of Calia Hastings. And the best way to get there is to talk to our [[flight master]], Bragok. He'll fly you there, if you want. The flight's free, thanks to your friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||27|75}}
*260 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with the [[Alliance]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Theramore.

==Notes==
Gazlowe does not offer this quest if [[Traitors Among Us]] has been completed.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
