==Objectives==
[[Captain Garran Vimes]] at [[Foothold Citadel]] wants you to lay the Wreath at the [[Hyal Family Monument]].
* Wreath Laid at Hyal Monument
* [[Wreath]] (provided)

==Description==
I wish we had a way of letting [[James Hyal]]'s wife and son know that we have brought their murderers to justice.

<Captain Vimes produces a small wreath decorated with flowers.>

There are some who say that their spirits will know, even if we cannot reach them. It's not much, but I'd like you to lay this wreath at the Hyal family monument. It's one of the stones in the graveyard just north of [[Theramore]]'s gates.

== Progress ==
Did you lay the wreath?

==Completion==
<Captain Vimes smiles slightly as you relate the events you witnessed at the Hyal family grave.>

It's good to know that they understand. You didn't tell them about James, did you?

I'll deliver his wife's message to him, but I doubt he'll understand.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Battlecaster's Edge
|Steel-Backed Hauberk
|Staff of Memory
}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|40}}

==Notes==
The [[Hyal Family Monument|Hyal Monument]] is in the graveyard just north of Theramore. Lay the [[Wreath]] near the grave and watch the little cutscene that follows:

:{{text|say|Lynn Hyal|James?  James...  No, you're not James, but I know who you are...}}
:{{text|say|Lynn Hyal|You're the one who tracked down the brutes who did this to us.}}
:{{text|say|Lynn Hyal|I tried so hard to tell Jim... to tell anyone... who was behind this, but I couldn't find a way...}}
:{{text|say|Lynn Hyal|Thank you for helping us and for helping Jim.  If you see him, tell him little Jimmy and I love him and that we're waiting for him.}}
:''Jimmy turns to his mother.''
:{{text|say|Jimmy Hyal|Mommy, when will we see Daddy again?}}
:''Lynn turns and kneels to speak to Jimmy.''
:{{text|say|Lynn Hyal|I don't know when we'll see Daddy again, Jimmy, but I know he loves you and he misses you very much.}}
:''Mother and son then vanish.''
