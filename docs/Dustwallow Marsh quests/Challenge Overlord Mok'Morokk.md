==Objectives==
Defeat [[Mok'Morokk]] and report the news to [[Draz'Zilb]] in [[Brackenwall Village]].
*Drive Overlord Mok'Morokk from Brackenwall Village
*Suggested players: 2

==Description==
You dare challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk?

Haw!

Me crush tiny <race>!

You tell me when ready for good beating.

==Reward==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Overlord's Trophy Shoulders
|Mok'Morokk's Beat Stick
|Dustwallow Impaler
|Overlord's Trophy Pauldrons
|Mok'Morokk's Headcracker
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|40}}
*6200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I thought you were going to attempt to drive Mok'Morokk out of the village. Instead you have come to me to chat? 

==Completion==
That cowardly fat mass Mok'Morokk fled like a scared child. You have done a great service, <name>.

Now my people can appoint a new leader, one who will help us reclaim our old home once and for all.

==Notes==
Leadership of an ogre clan is usually determined by single combat. However, Mok'Morokk is significantly tougher and stronger than other elite mobs of his level, so you will probably need help from friends to defeat him if your own level isn't much higher than his. This truly is a "group" quest.
