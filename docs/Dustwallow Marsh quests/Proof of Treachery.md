==Objectives==
Speak with [[Jaina]] to travel to [[Stormwind]] and meet with [[Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth]]. 

==Description==
Although [[Onyxia]] has been exposed and removed from the court, the [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] who carried out her plan must be punished. Carry word to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth in Stormwind castle that the Defias are the ones who carried out the Varian's kidnapping. I have little doubt that Stormwind's armies will mete out swift and terrible justice to those involved.

I can use my [[magic]] to expedite your trip to Stormwind. Just speak to me when you're prepared to go, <name>. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
1,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So it was the Defias who served as the hands of Onyxia in this plot?

<The admirall's{{sic}} face grows red with anger and her hands clench into fists.>

You and Lady Jaina have done Stormwind a great service this day. The traitors will not live long enough to regret their crimes.

==Notes==
*Despite being updated in ''Legion'' to turn in to Anduin instead of Varian, and Jaina referring to Anduin in the text, she still refers to "his kidnapping" as though Anduin was the one who had been kidnapped.
**The text was later updated and corrected.
