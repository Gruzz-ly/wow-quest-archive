==Objectives==
Obtain the Defias Orders from [[Garn Mathers]].
* [[Defias Orders]]

==Description==
My scouts have reported a shipwreck just off the beach to the northeast. Shipwrecks aren't all that unusual out here, but the reports also indicated the survivors were all wearing red bandanas... the symbol of the Defias!

The reports indicate their leader resides on a large island just off the coast to the northeast of the tower. Kill him and retrieve any documents you find in his possession. 

==Progress==
Were you able to track down their leader?

==Completion==
<Captain Wymor accepts the orders from you and reads over them.>

What in the world could 'precious cargo' refer to? The Defias have done some small time smuggling back in the lands of Stormwind, but this seems to be out of their league. The language of these orders suggests a wealthy or noble patron.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 3,710 [[XP]]

The [[Defias]] are craftsmen and guildsmen, not sailors. What are they doing at the site of a shipwreck on a continent they've no interest in?

Their leader is rumored to reside on a large island just off the coast to the northeast of the tower. Kill him and retrieve any documents you find in his possession.
