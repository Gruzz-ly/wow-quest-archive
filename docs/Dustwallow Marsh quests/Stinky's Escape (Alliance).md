In this quest you must escort {{NPC|Neutral|"Stinky" Ignatz}} to safety while allowing him time to gather Bogbean Leaves. This is the Alliance version, were you looking for the [[Stinky's Escape (Horde)|Horde version]]?

==Objective==
Escort {{NPC|Neutral|"Stinky" Ignatz}}, then speak with {{NPC|Alliance|Morgan Stern}} in [[Theramore]].
* Help Stinky find Bogbean Leaves

==Description==
Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me!

I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, ''&lt;buddy/lady&gt;''.

The cook Morgan Stern is researching a new recipe, and he sent me out here to gather bogbean leaves. I guess he thinks they're tasty.

Anyway, while looking for a bogbean plant... I got myself surrounded! Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for the bogbean?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40|}}
{{itembox||Elixir of Fortitude
}}

==Progress==
Have you seen Mr. Ignatz? I sent him into the swamp some time ago and he hasn't returned!

==Completion==
Mr. Ignatz was just here with the bogbean leaves, and he told me you helped him out of some real trouble.

Thank you, ''&lt;name&gt;''. I will ask my uncle to treat you to a feast the next time you visit the Blue Recluse in Stormwind.

==Gains==
* 290-3700 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|s=22|c=20}} compensation at level 80)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]] <!-- additional reputations in previous version were spillover only. -->
