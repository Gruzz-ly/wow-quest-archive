==Objectives==
Collect 10 Marsh Frog Legs from [[Giant Marsh Frog]]s.
* [[Marsh Frog Leg]] (10)

==Description==
I like cooking. Good swamp cooking. Fried green frog legs and the like.

And I'm all out of legs. The [[Swamplight Manor|manor]] is overrun with frogs, though. Giant marsh frogs. Think you could bring me some of those legs? Nothin' to it, really. Just bop 'em on the head and bring me the legs.

Then I'll make a stew and stew it up and suck it down and give you some too.

Do you like stew? 

==Progress==
Spice. We could all use some spice in our life. You agree?

==Completion==
Ah, that's the spice! Now here's some swampy good stew.
