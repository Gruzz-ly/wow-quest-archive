'''Lieutenant Paval Reethe''' seems to be involved in the destruction of the [[Shady Rest Inn]].

==Objectives==
Bring Reethe's Badge to [[Krog]] in [[Brackenwall Village]]. 
*[[Reethe's Badge]] (Provided)

==Description==
A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble. Brushing debris and ash caked onto the object reveals the insignia of a gold anchor on white, enameled on the surface: the sign of [[Theramore]].

Underneath the anchor is embossed the name "Lieutenant [[Paval Reethe]]".  

==Progress==
Have you found any leads on what happened at the Shady Rest Inn? 

==Completion==
Hmm... now this is interesting.

I know this human, Paval Reethe. Pathetic, even for his kind. He deserted his fellow soldiers and is now hiding out in the woods.

I sent [[Ogron (ogre)|Ogron]] out to track him down. Some of the others suspect he's been stealing from our supplies. I think I saw Ogron heading off to the southeast.

==Progression==
This is part of [[The Shady Rest Inn quest chain]]:
