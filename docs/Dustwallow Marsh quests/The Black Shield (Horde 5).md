==Objectives==
Show the Blackened Iron Shield to [[Mosarn]] in [[Thunder Bluff]].
*[[Blackened Iron Shield]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before.

In thanks, the [[Earthen Ring]] awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work.

Perhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted.

It's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of [[Paval Reethe|Reethe]], it's all we have.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at max level)

==Progress==
Hello there, <class>. Something I can help you with?

==Completion==
Yes, you are certainly correct. This is a shield that I made.

I'm afraid there's not much more I can tell you though, <name>. I craft so many different shields and sets of armor, I can't keep track of them all.
