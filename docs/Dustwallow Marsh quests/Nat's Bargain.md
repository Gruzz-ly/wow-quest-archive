==Objectives==
Smear Pagle's Fish Paste, Extra Strength on yourself, then swim into [[Tidefury Cove]].
*Fish Paste Tested
*[[Pagle's Fish Paste, Extra Strength]] (provided)

==Description==
So you found a copy of [[:Dastardly Denizens of the Deep]], did you? Well, I can tell you from experience, it's all true. I've even seen a few of 'em with my own eyes.

But you want to know about [[Tethyr]]. I said I'd make you a deal, so here's what I want you to do. I'm working on a new line of baits, but I haven't tested this one yet.

Just take this paste -- yeah, it smells a little foul -- smear it on yourself, and swim into the deep part of Tidefury Cove to the southwest. Let me know how it works!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90|}}
*6,010 [[XP]]
*2x [[Darkmoon Special Reserve]]

==Progress==
Remember, the deal is "don't come back until something bites you."

==Completion==
Not bad at all, but you know, I think I'd get a bath in as soon as possible, if I was you.

Now, about your sea monster...

Help yourself to a brew or two in the meantime.

==Notes==
Apply the lure, swim to the shipwreck, and then swim in the area until a "[[Lurking Shark]]" aggros.

There are two shipwrecks in the area. Swim around the shipwreck that is to the west (a tiny bit south, but mainly west).

The best approach is to apply the bait where you receive the quest then swim towards the wreck. The shark will attack you as you approach the ship. killing the other mobs around the wreck prior to applying the bait makes this easier.

==Progression==
