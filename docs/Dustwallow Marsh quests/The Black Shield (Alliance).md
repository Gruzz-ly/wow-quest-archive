==Objectives==
Bring the [[Blackened Iron Shield]] to [[Captain Garran Vimes]] in [[Theramore]].

==Description==
An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the [[Shady Rest Inn]].

The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney.

==Progress==
Have you found evidence from the site of the Shady Rest Inn?

==Completion==
Hm, I'm no expert with the construction of arms and armor. Their use, yes, but not their making.

This shield seems as ordinary as any, excepting the damage from the fire that engulfed the inn.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|s=4|c=80}}

==Progression==
This is part of [[The Shady Rest Inn quest chain]]:
