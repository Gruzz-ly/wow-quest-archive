==Objectives==
Obtain Razorspine's Sword.
*[[Razorspine's Sword]]

==Description==
I have cutting to do. I can't tell you what I'm going to cut, but... I need myself a blade. A certain blade...

Some people call it a sword. I call it a swing blade.

You help me? Those fish-men, you know, [[murloc]]s or whatever they're called.... There's one they call [[Razorspine]], carries a big sword, lives north of here near the beach. That's the sword I need!

But don't sleep on this. What I'm cutting won't keep forever...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Artisan's Trousers
|"Swamp Eye" Belt
|Reedknot Ring
|"Swamp Eye" Chain Sash
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||40}}
* 4,350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You have my blade?? 

==Completion==
That's a good blade. It has a good swing. It's a good swing blade. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! Now I want to try it....  

Later. I'll try it later. But like I was saying... thanks.

==Progression==

==Trivia==
The line "Some folks call it a sword, I call it a swing blade..." is a reference to the movie {{wp|Sling Blade (film)|Sling Blade}}, in which Karl says, "Some folks call it a Kaiser Blade, I call it a sling blade..."
