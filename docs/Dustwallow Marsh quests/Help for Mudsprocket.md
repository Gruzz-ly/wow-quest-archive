==Objectives==
Speak with [[Drazzit Dripvalve]] at [[Mudsprocket]].

==Description==
When that goblin... what's her name... Boxie, Foxy... [[Moxie Steelgrille|Moxie]], that's it! Anyway, when she came through here on her way to the [[Beezil's Wreck|zeppelin wreck]], she said the town of [[Mudsprocket]] was having some problems.

That crashed zeppelin was bringing them fresh supplies. If you follow the road south of here, past the [[Stonemaul Ruins]], you'll eventually come to Mudsprocket.

Why don't you check in with Drazzit Dripvalve down there and see if there's anything you can do to help?

==Completion==
It's good of [[Tabetha]] to send you down here. I'd prevail upon her for some food until the wreckage from the [[Beezil's Wreck|zeppelin]] is taken care of, but I know she's got none to spare at the moment. If you're feeling adventurous, I've posted a bounty for the death of a particularly nasty raptor.

==Gains==
* 600 [[XP]]
