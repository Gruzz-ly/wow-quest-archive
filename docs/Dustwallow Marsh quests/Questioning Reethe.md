'''Questioning Reethe''' sends the adventurer to assist an ogre who is going to question a human deserter.

==Objectives==
Go with [[Ogron (ogre)|Ogron]] to speak with [[Paval Reethe|Reethe]].

==Description==
It took a long time, but I found Reethe. He hide good for a human.

Ogron worried that he might be crazy after so much time in swamp. You come with me for we go get answers from him. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Eyepoker
|Blasting Hackbut
}}

You will receive:
*2850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hmph. It is good that Reethe will no longer be lurking around the swamp, but it is a shame that humans are built so frail that he could not recover from a little arrow wound.

It seems that this thread of the mystery has led nowhere, and we must look elsewhere.

==Notes==
When you and Ogron reach Reethe, several [[Theramore]] soldiers show up to assassinate Reethe. It seems they want to shut him up rather than bring him to justice. 

;Dialogue
:{{Text|say|Ogron|I noticed some fire on that island over there. A human, too. Let's go check it out, <name>.}}
<Ogron then starts walking forward until he comes to the tree to the right of Reethe's camp.>
:{{Text|say|Ogron|That's Reethe alright. Let's go see what he has to say, yeah?}}
<Ogron approaches Reethe's camp and Reethe changes to an attack stance.>
:{{Text|say|Paval Reethe|W-what do you want? Just leave me alone...}}
:{{Text|say|Paval Reethe|I swear, I didn't steal anything from you! Here, take some of my supplies, just go away!}}
:{{Text|say|Ogron|Just tell us what you know about the Shady Rest Inn, and I won't bash your skull in.}}
:{{Text|say|Paval Reethe|I... Well, I may of taken a little thing or two from the inn... but what would an ogre care about that?}}
:{{Text|say|Ogron|Look here, if you don't tell me about the fire--}}
:{{Text|say|Paval Reethe|Not one step closer, ogre!}}
:{{Text|say|Paval Reethe|And I don't know anything about this fire of yours...}}
<As he speaks, a small group of [[Theramore]] soldiers spawn to the right. The group consists of [[Lieutenant Caldwell]], [[Private Hallan]], and two [[Theramore Skirmisher]]s.>
:{{Text|say|Paval Reethe|What was that? Did you hear something?}}
:{{Text|say|Lieutenant Caldwell|Paval Reethe! Found you at last. And consorting with ogres now? No fear, even deserters and traitors are afforded some mercy.}}
:{{Text|say|Lieutenant Caldwell|Private, show Lieutenant Reethe some mercy.}}
:{{Text|say|Private Hallan|Gladly, sir.}}
<She switches to a bow, shoots him once, and switches back to her sword.><br>
<Paval Reethe staggers backwards as the arrow lodges itself deeply in his chest.>
:{{Text|say|Paval Reethe|Ugh... Hallan, didn't think you had it in you...}}
:{{Text|say|Lieutenant Caldwell|Now, let's clean up the rest of the trash, men!}}
:{{Text|say|Ogron|Damn it! You'd better not die on me, human!}}
<The group of Alliance soldiers aggro. If/when you kill them all, the scene continues, though Reethe is no longer in an attacking stance towards Ogron.>
:{{Text|say|Ogron|Still with us, Reethe?}}
:{{Text|say|Paval Reethe|Must be your lucky day. Alright, I'll talk. Just leave me alone. Look, you're not going to believe me, but it wa... oh, Light, looks like the girl could shoot...}}
<Paval Reethe falls over dead at this point.>
:{{Text|say|Ogron|Looks dead to me. Not much use to us like this. You'd better go back and tell Krog what happened.}}
:{{Text|say|Ogron|By the way, thanks for watching my back.}}
