==Objectives==
Speak to [["Swamp Eye" Jarl]] at [[Swamplight Manor]].

==Description==
There's a fellow the locals know as "Swamp Eye" Jarl, who lives alone out in the swamp. Sometime ago he "took over" Swamplight Manor after the previous owners disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

I like to send someone to check up on him every once in a while. He kind of reminds me of my grandfather, you know? Some say he's not quite right in the head.

If you're headed northwest on the road out of [[Theramore]], you'll find Swamplight Manor in the [[Witch Hill]] area, before the road turns west.

==Completion==
Get off my lawn... unless, that is, you want to help old "Swamp Eye" with a little bit of cooking. Whad'ya say?
