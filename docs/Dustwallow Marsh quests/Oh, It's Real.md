==Objectives==
Speak with [[Major Mills]] at the docks in [[Theramore]].

==Description==
Yes, [[Tethyr]] is certainly real, and he lives in the waters off [[Theramore]].

Has a thing for bright lights. He's the reason they shut down the lighthouse in the first place, you know...

And if you light it back up again, he'll come right back. But no one in their right mind would do that.

So that must be your plan! It's been good sharing a drink with you, but don't blame ol' Nat if Tethyr REALLY turns you into fish bait. If you're going to do this, make sure you consult [[Major Mills]] at the Theramore docks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You recount your experiences with [[Nat Pagle]], carefully omitting the portion about the 'bait test.'>

Well, it sounds like we've got our work cut out for us. I'll make the preparations.

==Progression==
