==Objectives==
Slay 7 [[Withervine Creeper]]s or [[Withervine Rager]]s in the marsh north of [[Brackenwall Village]].
*Withervine slain (7)
 
==Description==
[[Dustwallow]] is [[Horde]] territory, <name>. The [[human]]s may have [[Theramore Island|their little island]] and their precious sand bar, but the marsh belongs to us.

In time, we will surely win this stalemate with the humans. For now, we must master our own territory. The withervine [[bog beast]]s to the north rise from the marsh itself to attack any living thing that approaches. If we own this marsh, we must not let our own land fight back against us!

Slay the bog beasts, if you wish to serve the Horde. You will be rewarded.

==Rewards== 
You will receive:
*{{cost||40|}}
*3,500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. We'll be able to focus on greater threats here now.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
