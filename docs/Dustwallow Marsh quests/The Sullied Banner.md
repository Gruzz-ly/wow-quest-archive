==Objectives==
Find [[Surigosa]] in [[Theramore]].

==Description==
So long as there has been [[magic]], there have been those willing to utilize it for nefarious ends.

I am not certain what grievances these [[Hedge wizard|rogue mages]] hold that has prompted Surigosa to chase them down, but I am inclined to trust her judgment on the matter. Let us go to her, <name>; perhaps we can solve this rogue mage problem and convince Surigosa to return in a single turn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones

==Completion==
Greetings, mortal. You and your hangers-on have arrived just in time to see me obliterate this pack of miscreant magi.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|[[Azuregos]] said in his notes that he intended to seek out Surigosa himself. If the situation is truly so dire, then I shall accompany you on your way.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|It would be wise to avoid getting too close until we are apprised of the situation. This portal will take us to the cliffs just beyond Theramore.}}

There's also an option with Kalecgos:
