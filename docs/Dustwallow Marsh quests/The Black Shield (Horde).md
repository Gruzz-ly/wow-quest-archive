==Objectives==
Bring the Blackened Iron Shield to [[Krog]] in [[Brackenwall Village]].
*[[Blackened Iron Shield]] (provided)

==Description==
An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the [[Shady Rest Inn]].

The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||4|20}}

==Progress==
What's that you have there, <name>? Evidence from the remains of the Shady Rest Inn?

==Completion==
I grant that [[human]]s have strange decorating tastes, but would they use a plain iron shield to adorn their fireplace? Perhaps this shield was placed there by the ones who burned the inn.

A warning? A threat?

==Progression==
