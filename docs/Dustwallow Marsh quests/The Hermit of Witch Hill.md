==Objectives==
Speak with [["Swamp Eye" Jarl]] at [[Swamplight Manor]].

==Description==
The marsh seems to have a strange effect on humans. Some grow mad simply by living here.

Anyone who has ever settled at Swamplight Manor has gone mad in a spectacular way. The latest owner, one "Swamp Eye" Jarl, is already showing signs.

I don't completely understand what's happening there, you'd have my thanks for looking into it.

The manor is at the eastern edge of the swamp. Trek east across [[Bluefen]] and past [[North Point Tower]]. The manor is in a haunted patch of land called [[Witch Hill]].

==Completion==
Have you come here to spy on me? No?

Perhaps you have an appreciation for fine cuisine, then? Good, you can help!
