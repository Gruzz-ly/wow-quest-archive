==Objectives==
Speak with {{npc||Drazzit Dripvalve}} at [[Mudsprocket]].

==Description==
The [[Steamwheedle Cartel]]'s new outpost in the southern part of the marsh isn't faring so well. The zeppelin carrying supplies to Mudsprocket crashed, leaving them without vital tools, food, and medical supplies.

Follow the road down south and into the marsh's interior. You'll pass by [[Tabetha's Farm]] and the [[Stonemaul Ruins]] before the road brings you to Mudsprocket. Offer any help you can provide to the town's leadership.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*410 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|40}} at level 70)

==Completion==
I won't turn down any help! We're in the process of setting up here and trying to make the most of what we've got, until those supplies from the zeppelin arrive.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Added.}}
