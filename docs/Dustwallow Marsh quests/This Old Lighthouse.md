==Objectives==
Speak to [[Babs Fizzletorque]] at the lighthouse on the island east of [[Theramore]].

==Description==
The old lighthouse out to the east hasn't worked for some time, but Babs Fizzletorque has gotten in to her head to get it working again.

I don't know how she plans to do it by herself, but she claims that it'll make the movement of ships and goods to the docks smoother, so I can't really object. Drawing duty on the docks is really nothing to complain about when you could be on the front lines, you know?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good. I can use all the help you can offer. My first priority is to get that lamp re-lit.
