'''Daelin's Men''' were so loyal to their [[Daelin Proudmoore|admiral]] that they turned traitor against the [[Alliance]].

==Objectives==
Return the information about [[Paval Reethe|Reethe]] to [[Captain Garran Vimes]] in [[Theramore]].   

==Description==
[[Reddon]]... [[Redpath]]... Ah, here it is! Lieutenant [[Paval Reethe]].

Joined the [[Theramore Guard|Theramore guard]] along with most of the recruits that came across the sea with Lady Proudmoore. Enlisted with the [[marine]]s of [[Kul Tiras]] at the age of sixteen. Distinguished service, promotions...

Listed as missing.

==Completion==
Missing? That would be [[Adjutant Tesoran|Tesoran's]] kind way of saying traitor.

No doubt he's one of those fools so blindly loyal to [[Daelin Proudmoore|Admiral Daelin]] that he turned traitor.  Isn't that a delicious irony? The deserters accuse us of betraying the Alliance.
