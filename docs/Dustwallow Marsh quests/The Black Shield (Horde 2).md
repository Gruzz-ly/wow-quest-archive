==Objectives==
Show the Blackened Iron Shield to [[Do'gol]] in [[Brackenwall Village]].
*[[Blackened Iron Shield]] (provided)

==Description==
Hmm... I don't see anything out of the ordinary with this shield. We should have Do'gol, the blacksmith, take a look at it, and see if he can tell us more about it, but I wouldn't hold out hope...

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|50}}.

==Progress==
Something for me, <class>?

==Completion==
This is good shield. Very strong, heavy, good. But Do'gol don't need it. I make shields, not buy them, <name>.

You should know that.
