==Objectives==
Apprehend Turi Flickerflame.
*[[Turi Flickerflame]] apprehended

==Description==
With many of their rank-and-file captured, it is time to deal with the leader of this so-called [[Sullied Banner]].

I imagine [[Kalecgos]] wishes to take her alive. I have no such compunctions, but I am not a picky [[dragon]]. So long as we put a stop to her schemes, I care little what happens to her.

His plan, though troublesome, seems to have worked thus far. I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for a short while longer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Act quickly, <class>. I do not want this [[gnome]] to slip away from us now.

==Completion==
I admit, I did not expect things to go this way. That gnome... no. Magus Flickerflame. She has suffered much. It makes sense that she would wish to cultivate her power, in order to subvert further tragedies from coming to pass.

Kalecgos says that we must be mediators and protectors, not hoarders of secrets. I think I am beginning to understand what he means.

:{{Text|say|Surigosa|Our presence will merely exacerbate the situation. She will feel more threatened. We are breaking the cycle, yes?}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|...you make a fair point. Very well. We shall remain here, friend. Please, stop their leader before she does something she comes to regret.}}
