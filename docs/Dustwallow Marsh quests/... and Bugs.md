'''... and Bugs''' is the second ingredient to what could possibly be the next food craze in Stormwind.

==Objectives==
Bring 12 Pristine Crawler Legs to [[Morgan Stern]] in [[Theramore]].
*[[Pristine Crawler Leg]] (12)

==Description==
Another component of my new recipe is the shelled leg of a giant [[crab]]. And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- spiny rock crawlers they call them -- will be perfect!

The shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs. An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish.

Head on over to the rocks surrounding Theramore and get me those legs!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Baroque Shield
|Crawling Wand}}

==Progress==
My research with the Mudrock tongues is progressing nicely. I trust your crab hunt goes well?

==Completion==
These are wonderful specimens, <name>! The shells are in perfect condition, and the meat is pink and tender. The blood of a chef is in your veins, I'm sure of it!

==Notes==
The legs drop from [[Spiny Rock Crab]]s along the waters east of Theramore Isle.
