All able bodied members of the [[Horde]] are hereby ordered to report to Krog at Brackenwall Village. The marsh is overrun with enemies of many kinds and the [[Alliance]] forces there are dangerously strong.

You can travel to Dustwallow Marsh by following the path from the eastern part of the [[Southern Barrens]] toward Brackenwall Village. Or, you can get a flight there from Doras in Orgrimmar.

Destiny calls!
