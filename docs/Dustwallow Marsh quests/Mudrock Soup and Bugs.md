'''Mudrock Soup and Bugs''' could be the next big dish at inns in Stormwind City.

==Objectives==
Bring 8 Forked Mudrock Tongues to [[Morgan Stern]] in [[Theramore]].
*[[Forked Mudrock Tongue]] (8)

==Description==
I'm working on a dish I call "Mudrock Soup and Bugs." I still need the major ingredients, and... well, I don't think I'd last long trudging through [[Dustwallow Marsh]]!

So, <name>, can you do some hunting for me? First, I need the tongues of Mudrock turtles. You can find Mudrocks along the coast, mostly around the bay.

But I don't want just any tongues! I hear that the tongues of some Mudrocks are forked...

They say the forked tongues have a distinct flavor, and I want that flavor in my dish...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6,010 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Did you get the forked tongues?

==Completion==
These will do fine! Thank you, <name>!

Now I'll try different cooking techniques on these tongues to find the best way to bring out their flavor.

Eventually I'll have a dish worthy of serving at the [[Blue Recluse]] in [[Stormwind]]!

==Notes==
The tongues drop from the various Mudrock turtles along the coast. The droprate is not extremely high but they do drop sellable grey items, [[Turtle Meat]], and can be skinned for [[Heavy Leather]].
