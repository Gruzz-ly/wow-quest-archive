==Objectives==
Use [[Tabetha]]'s Torch to burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at [[Direhorn Post]].
* North Tent Burned
* Northeast Tent Burned
* East Tent Burned
* [[Tabetha's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new "neighbors" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the [[Shady Rest Inn]], as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer.

Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm. You can't miss it, really, as the [[Grimtotem]]s have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor.

==Progress==
Have you put that torch to good use?

==Completion==
I hope the Grimtotems got the message. Any attempt to return will be met with far worse than a mere torch. My apprentices and I will see to that.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|s=45}}

==Progression==
{{They Call Him Smiling Jim}}
