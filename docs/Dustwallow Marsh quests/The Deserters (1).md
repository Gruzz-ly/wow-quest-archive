==Objectives==
Get information about Reethe from [[Balos Jacken]] and the deserters in [[Dustwallow Marsh]]. 

==Description==
It has been a struggle maintaining a presence in the marsh, but through strength of our resolve, we have been able to maintain several defensive [[Scout tower|watchtowers]] throughout the area.

The latest information and scouting reports I have received indicate that a group of deserters has squatted in our abandoned tower at [[Lost Point]], southeast of the [[Shady Rest Inn|inn]].

The local lieutenant seems to be Balos Jacken. See if you can get some information out of him.

Be warned, <name>. He may be a tough nut to crack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||17|40}} at max level)

==Completion==
Did Vimes send you? Couldn't do his dirty work himself, could he... 

==Notes==
