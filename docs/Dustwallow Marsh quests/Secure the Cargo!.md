==Objectives==
[[Moxie Steelgrille]] at [[Beezil's Wreck]] wants you to recover 8 pieces of Zeppelin Cargo.
*[[Zeppelin Cargo]] (8)

==Description==
This [[zeppelin]] was carrying six months' worth of supplies to us at [[Mudsprocket]]! Sure, they've been able to barter for some of what they need, but they won't hold out forever.

I've been sent here to recover what I can of the cargo, but the wreckage is scattered all over the marsh in this area. I'm sure a lot of cargo didn't survive the crash, but are you willing to help me recover what we can?

==Rewards==
You will receive {{cost||45}}

==Progress==
<Moxie looks frantic with worry.>

Did the cargo survive? Did you find any of it?

==Completion==
Wow you certainly found a lot more than I expected would be out there. I'm not sure how much [[Drazzit Dripvalve|Drazzit]] thought we were going to find out here, but he's going to have to be happy with this for now.

==Gains==
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gadgetzan]]
* 4150 [[XP]]

==Notes==
*Interestingly, there are three boxes that look certainly like Zeppelin Cargo near [[Tabetha's Farm]], however they cannot be gathered.
