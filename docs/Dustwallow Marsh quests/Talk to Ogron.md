==Objectives==
Find [[Ogron (ogre)|Ogron]] to the southeast of [[Brackenwall Village]].  

==Description==
I know this [[human]], [[Paval Reethe]]. Pathetic, even for his kind. He deserted his fellow soldiers and is now hiding out in the woods.

I sent Ogron out to track him down. Some of the others suspect he's been stealing from our supplies. I think I saw Ogron heading off to the southeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ogron? Yeah, that me.

Shh. Keep voice down. Crocs hear you.
