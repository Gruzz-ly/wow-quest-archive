==Objectives==
Collect 6 vials of Marsh Venom from [[Darkfang Creeper]]s or [[Noxious Shredder]]s.
* [[Marsh Venom]] (6)

==Description==
If there's one thing you can count on [[Apprentice Morlann]] to do, it's whine about reagents.

Normally, I just ignore him, and it never works. This time, I'm going to try something different.

Maybe if I replace the missing reagents before he notices, he'll leave me alone. The most common reagent we both use is marsh venom, which comes from the darkfang creepers and noxious shredders in the marsh north of the [[Tabetha's Farm|farm]]. If you bring me the venom, I'll replace it before Morlann notices it's gone.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

|Seasoned Marshwood Bow
|The Wanderer's Cover
|The Explorer's Coif
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get that venom? Morlann's going to discover that it's gone any moment now...

==Completion==
<Apprentice Garion inspects the venom.>

This is absolutely perfect! He'll never know the difference.
