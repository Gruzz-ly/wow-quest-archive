==Objectives==
Show the [[Blackened Iron Shield]] to [[Caz Twosprocket]] in [[Theramore]].

* [[Blackened Iron Shield]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm sorry I can't be of much help, <name>, but I can refer you to someone who would be. Caz Twosprocket, one of our best blacksmiths, works the forge at the [[Blacksmith|smithy]].

Take the shield to him, and see what he can tell you.

==Progress==
Something for me to look at?

==Completion==
Hm... Interesting piece of iron you have here. Definately{{sic}} not made by any of the blacksmiths I know over on this side of the sea, and it's certainly not my work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|s=2|c=10}}.
* 330 [[XP]]

==Progression==
This is part of [[The Shady Rest Inn quest chain]]:
