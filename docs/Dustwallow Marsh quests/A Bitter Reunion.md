==Objectives==
Speak to Thomas Zelling to set sail to [[Theramore]].
* Speak with [[Thomas Zelling]]

==Description==
We've done it! Zelling will guide the [[The Swift Vengeance‎|ship]] to Theramore, and we can put an end to this foul business once and for all.

Speak to Zelling when you are ready to leave, and we will set sail.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*20 [[War Resources]]
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We sail at your command, <class>.

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <class>. 

I must return home, but Zelling has a plan to hide our actions from [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]' eyes.

The Banshee Queen must not learn of what transpired here, for it would put far more lives at risk than our own.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Baine blows a horn and runs to the center of the deck.''
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|That took longer than expected. I was concerned you had been caught.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|There were... complications... but we are ready to depart.}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|Then let's not waste any more time. <Class>?}}

;Speaking with Thomas
:As a Tidesage, I can call upon the powers of the sea to guide this ship to our destination.

:Say the word and we will set sail.

:{{Gossip|Set sail to Theramore.}}

:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|Seaward winds, fill our sails! Guide our ship through oceans true!}}
:''Thomas uses his magic, and the atmosphere changes.''

;Cinematic
: ''It is nighttime. Jaina's ship waits by one of Theramore's docks, bow pointed out away from the ruins as cool ocean mist slightly obscures their surroundings. Jaina, with Shaw behind her left shoulder, are alone on deck, waiting for ''The Swift Vengeance'' to come up along the port side. As the Horde battleship slowly solidifies into view from the mist on her approach from the opposite direction, Jaina tightens her grip on her staff.''
: ''The Horde vessel practically drifts into position, portside to portside, and Baine lowers a gangplank with a thump. As he crosses over, his massive body obscures a man following closely behind him. He greets Jaina as he steps down onto her deck.''
:'''Baine Bloodhoof:''' {{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina.}}
: ''He bows.''
:'''Baine Bloodhoof:''' {{text|bossemote|Long has it been [[The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm|since we spoke peacefully in Theramore]].}}
: ''Jaina replies pointedly.''
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|Theramore is gone. You did not ask me here to reminisce.}}
:'''Baine Bloodhoof:''' {{text|bossemote|No. I have come to return one who was lost.}}
: ''He turns and gestures towards his companion who steps forward, eyes hidden by his tricorne hat. He is dressed in [[Kul Tiran]] clothing that has seen better days, and as he raises his hand to politely remove his hat, it's clear by the skin tone that he is [[undead]].''
: ''Jaina is stunned when she sees it's Derek Proudmoore, her older brother raised as a [[Forsaken]]. She becomes upset, misunderstanding [[Ships in the Night|Baine's intentions]].''
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|Derek... my own brother.}}
: ''She steps towards Baine, her anger continually mounting as she speaks.''
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|I had thought better of you, Baine.}}
: ''She points accusingly at the High Chieftain.''
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|So tell me.}}
: ''Gestures to Derek.''
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|Is he [[Sylvanas Windrunner|the banshee's]] puppet? Crammed full of [[New Plague|blight]]?}}
: ''Nearly enraged, Jaina ignites a frost spell in her left hand, causing the sails and rigging to move about in the supernatural wind.''
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|[[Theramore's Fall (Alliance)|Is he the bomb this time?]]}}
:'''Derek Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|Yes.}}
: ''At Derek quietly speaking up, Jaina's spell fizzles out in her surprise as she looks at him.''
:'''Derek Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|That was the plan. But...}}
: ''Dropping his gaze, he gestures to Baine.''
:'''Derek Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|Baine took me from Sylvanas before, before I was twisted to her will.}}
: ''He looks back up at his now not-so-little sister, a note of hope in his tone.''
:'''Derek Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|I'm still your brother, Jaina. [[The Nation of Kul Tiras#Notes|For as long as stars do shine.]]}}
: ''Realization dawns on Jaina's face as she sees that Derek really is his own person; only family would know those words. She looks to Baine to ask one simple question.''
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|Why?}}
: ''Baine looks at her sadly.''
:'''Baine Bloodhoof:''' {{text|bossemote|The Horde has a sickness in it.}}
: ''Jaina steps up to him as he continues.''
:'''Baine Bloodhoof:''' {{text|bossemote|We [[Fourth War|wage war]], while the [[Earth Mother]] dies. We have forgotten what truly matters,}}
: ''Baine accentuates his heartache by bringing his hand to his chest as he speaks.''
:'''Baine Bloodhoof:''' {{text|bossemote|and my heart can bear it no longer.}}
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|Sylvanas will kill you for this. And... she may not stop with you.}}
: ''He replies philosophically.''
:'''Baine Bloodhoof:''' {{text|bossemote|No life is worth living, if we cannot be true to our nature.}}
: ''He turns away to the gangplank. Jaina's face is a look of worried concern.''
:'''Baine Bloodhoof:''' {{text|bossemote|I return home, to take what solace I can in my family.}} 
: ''He briefly looks back over his shoulder at her as he continues, looking towards Derek before stepping up onto the gangplank to cross back over.''
:'''Baine Bloodhoof:''' {{text|bossemote|I hope you take solace in yours.}}
: ''He gets a few steps before Jaina calls out to him.''
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|Baine...}}
: ''He pauses, and the siblings look towards his back.''
:'''Jaina Proudmoore:''' {{text|bossemote|thank you.}}
: ''He acknowledges her heartfelt gratitude with a soft grunt, and disembarks back onto ''The Swift Vengeance''. Derek and Jaina look to each other.''

The ship now appears in [[Dustwallow Marsh]]. Speak with Baine to finish the quest.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I will not forget what you have done this day. Take care, <name>.}}
:''Baine leaves the ship, mounts his wyverns, and flies towards the mainland.''
