==Objectives==
Travel to [[Theramore Isle]] in [[Dustwallow Marsh]] and talk to [[Captain Garran Vimes]] in the main [[barracks]].

==Description==
[[General Hawthorne|Hawthorne]] dead... [[Marley Twinbraid|my own son]] murdered... the situation in the [[Southern Barrens|Barrens]] is out of control, <name>.

I'm going to take charge of [[Fort Triumph]] and try to lock things down. To do that, I'm going to need reinforcements. Reinforcements that were promised from Theramore weeks ago!

Travel to Theramore in Dustwallow Marsh and give Captain Garran Vimes an earful. What good is that [[Theramore Highway|blasted road]] through the swamp if the men and materiel aren't rolling in?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|38|75}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
What now, soldier?

Reinforcements? For the Barrens? We've been bleeding supplies and men there for months!

Does someone need to remind [[Twinbraid]] of the attack on [[Northwatch]]? Our losses at [[Honor's Stand]]? What happened to the men I sent to [[Fort Triumph]]? We've nothing to spare!

Listen <name>, if you want to help out our cause, you'll focus your efforts here in Dustwallow. Between the [[Theramore deserters|deserters]] and the [[Horde]] encroachment... we could use a hand.
