==Objective==
Bring Dastardly Denizens of the Deep to [["Dirty" Michael Crowe]] on the [[Theramore]] docks.
*[[Dastardly Denizens of the Deep]] (provided)

==Description==
You know, it's amazing what you can find in that old lighthouse. After I lit the lamp, I noticed this book in one of the old trunks up there.

<Babs holds up the book and reads the title dramatically.>

"Dastardly Denizens of the Deep!"

Why, I think I might swoon if I ever saw me one of these! I'm sure it's good for a laugh or two, but I simply don't have time for reading right now.

You know who might enjoy it, though... that fishmonger on the docks. [["Dirty" Michael Crowe]]. He collects old books.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What'll it be today? The snook is quite good.

==Completion==
Well, now, that was thoughtful o' [[Babs Fizzletorque|Babs]] to send that over. I don't know if you've leafed through it or not, but there's a lot of truth to the tales in that book. Sailors didn't just make it all up, you know.

==Progression==
