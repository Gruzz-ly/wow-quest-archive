==Objectives==
Speak with [[Tabetha]] at her [[Tabetha's Farm|farm]] in the [[Quagmire]].

==Description==
Deep in the heart of the swamp lives and old woman named [[Tabetha]]. We've never really known much about her, save that she's a good deal older than she appears. She's helped us from time to time and helped keep the peace here between the [[Horde]] and our forces.

She used to keep in regular contact, but we haven't received one lately.

Could you check in with her when you have time? Just follow the road beyond the [[North Point Tower]], where it turns south and in to the Quagmire. You can see her farm from the road.

==Completion==
It's good of [[Theramore]] to send someone. Your guard friend's suspicions were correct. We've got some new neighbors, and they aren't the kind you'd bring a casserole.

== Rewards ==
* 370 [[XP]]
