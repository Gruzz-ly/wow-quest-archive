==Objectives==
Use the Sturdy Rope to capture 6 [[Bloodfen Raptor]]s or [[Bloodfen Screecher]]s.
* Raptors Captured (6)
* [[Sturdy Rope]] (provided)

==Description==
The patch of swamp to the northeast is home to a particularly nasty breed of raptors. We've lost more than one unwary soldier to them, but I think we can turn them against our [[Grimtotem]] neighbors.

Take this rope and use it to capture bloodfen raptors or bloodfen screechers that you've subdued. I wouldn't try to capture one of the beasts until you've weakened them quite a bit in combat. It's going to be quite a struggle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|s=40}}
*3700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you capture those [[raptor]]s?

==Completion==
You look a little scratched up, but nothing major. You're certainly in a lot better shape than the Grimtotems will be when our new raptor friends get done with them.

==Progression==
{{They Call Him Smiling Jim}}

==Patch changes==
