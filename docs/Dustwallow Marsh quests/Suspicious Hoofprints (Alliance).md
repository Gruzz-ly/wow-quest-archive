==Objectives==
Report about the suspicious prints at the [[Shady Rest Inn]] to [[Captain Garran Vimes]] in [[Theramore]].

==Description==
Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hoofprints, eh? It is true that there is an extraordinary amount of [[centaur]] activity in the lands near the [[Dustwallow Marsh]]. In brief excursions into the [[Barrens]], we found their camps and holdings dotting the area.

I'll send out [[Falgran Hastil]], one of our trackers to see if he can find where the tracks lead.

==Notes==
This is the only quest in the [[Hoofprints]] fork. Complete both the [[Black Shield]] and the [[Theramore Guard Badge]] forks to gain access to the conclusion.
