==Objectives==
Collect 7 Blackhoof Armaments from [[Blackhoof Village]].
*[[Blackhoof Armaments]] (7)

==Description==
We've gleaned as much as we can from the ruins of the inn. I'm concerned about where the investigation will lead us from here, but we must know the truth.

Between the hoofprints and the shield with [[Mosarn]]'s mark, I'm led to believe that the [[Grimtotem]]s may have been involved. They've recently established a settlement in the swamp, Blackhoof Village to the northeast. Travel to Blackhoof Village and search for more arms of Mosarn's manufacture.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Glowing Tourmaline Ring
|Grimtotem Cloak
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|80|}}
*7,510 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What did your search of Blackhoof Village reveal?

==Completion==
<Krog inspects the weapons and armor you've brought from Blackhoof Village.>

This is unmistakably the work of Mosarn. Questioning him further may draw too much attention, but we have a bit more freedom in dealing with the Grimtotems.

==Progression==
{{Return to Krog}}
