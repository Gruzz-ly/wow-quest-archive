==Objectives==
[[Major Mills]] at the [[Theramore]] docks wants you to defeat [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
Sea monster or not, we're not going to risk the safety of our shipping. I've ordered our best marksmen to prepare for a confrontation with this [[Tethyr]]. The artillerymen have augmented the dock's defenses with three mortars.

I'm going to order the lighthouse's lamp illuminated. If Tethyr does attack, it will be your job to operate the mortars and take down the beast before it can kill all of the marksmen. I wouldn't stand in one place too long, though. Using the mortars is likely to draw it's attention.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tower of Theramore
|Swift Wind Spaulder
|Seamonster Harpoon
|Swift Wind Shoulders
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! I'll admit, when I caught my first glimpse of that beast, I had doubts about our ability to defend the docks, but you held together the defenders brilliantly!

==Notes==
Use the mortars on the docks nearest Tethyr to speed the process and successfully complete the quest. It is not necessary to tag Tethyr to complete the quest.

When the quest starts, it automatically begins to rain and will not stop until the encounter is over.

Falling in the water or going too far away from the docks will fail you and you'll have to restart the quest. On rare occasions, if you restart a failed quest too quickly (while Tethyr is still alive and leaving the dock area), he will not come forwards for the new quest, and you'll have to intentionally fail and restart. 

If the marksmen and Major Mills die, the player has to wait for Mills to respawn.

==Progression==
