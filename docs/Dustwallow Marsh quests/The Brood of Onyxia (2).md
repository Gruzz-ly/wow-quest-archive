The Brood of Onyxia is the 2nd quest in the '''The Brood of Onyxia''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Draz'Zilb]] in [[Brackenwall Village]].

==Description==
You leave me alone now. Go tell Draz'Zilb we stay here. No [[black dragon]] here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|70}} at max level)

==Completion==
That lazy coward!

Mok'Morokk displayed strength when [[Rexxar]] was our leader. But soon after Rexxar's departure Mok'Morokk fell prey to temptations of power. Rather than lead, he demanded. He does not serve his people but rather expects us to serve him.

Something must be done.

==Progression==
This quest is part of a chain.
