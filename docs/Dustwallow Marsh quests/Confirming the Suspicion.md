==Objectives==
Collect 4 [[Grimtotem Note]]s from [[Grimtotem Elder]]s and combine them into the Grimtotem Battle Plan.
* [[Grimtotem Battle Plan]]

==Description==
The [[Grimtotem]]s may be the most warlike of all the [[tauren]] clans, but they're by no means unorganized. If they're the ones who put the torch to the [[Shady Rest Inn]], they'll have had orders from one of the clan elders.

There's a large Grimtotem settlement called [[Blackhoof Village]] to the northwest. They've been using it as a base to attack the tower, but I'll bet that you'll find the orders you're looking for there. Check the village's elders for traces of the orders you seek.

==Progress==
Were you able to find any trace of the orders?

==Completion==
<Captain Darill glances at the battle plan.>

I'd say it doesn't get any clearer than this. They've taken it upon themselves to fight back against human settlements in the area and I have little doubt [[Theramore]] is next on their list.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|s=45}}
* 3900 [[XP]]

==Notes==
The Grimtotem Elders all drop a [[Grimtotem Note]]. Collect 4 notes then combine the stack into the [[Grimtotem Battle Plan]]

Grimtotem Battle Plan text:

I have sent you a force of considerable size, elder, but you must take care in your activities. Your first priority will be to halt the advance of the [[Alliance]] curs into our lands. Some of the more adventurous [[human]]s have already started the construction of a large building on the border with the [[Barrens]].

See to it that they know their kind are not welcome beyond the borders of their wretched [[Theramore]]. Lastly, a word of caution to you, elder: do not make your plans known to the [[ogre]]s of [[Brackenwall Village|Brackenwall]]. Those brutes are incapable of even the slightest hint of discretion.
