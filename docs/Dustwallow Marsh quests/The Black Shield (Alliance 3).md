==Objectives==
Speak with [[Captain Garran Vimes]] in [[Theramore]].

==Description==
Ah, I almost missed this... The leather strap on the back must have been burned off, but it seems like it was made to fit a large person. I'd guess a [[tauren]], actually.

That's about all I can tell you. Tell Captain Vimes I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

==Completion==
That's not much information to work on, but we'll have to keep it in mind. Hopefully some of the other pieces of this mystery will fall into place, and paint a more helpful picture of what happened.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|s=8|c=40}}

==Notes==
This quest concludes the [[Black Shield]] fork of the chain. Finish the [[Hoofprints]] and [[Theramore Guard Badge]] forks to have access to the conclusion.

==Progression==
This is part of [[The Shady Rest Inn quest chain]]:
