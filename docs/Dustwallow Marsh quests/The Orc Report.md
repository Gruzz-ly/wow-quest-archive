==Objectives==
Bring the Spy's Report to [[Lieutenant Aden]] in [[Theramore]].
*[[Spy's Report]] (provided)

==Description==
Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found. And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube. And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment.

The parchment is written in orcish... and it looks important.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|20}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Do you have a report to make?

==Completion==
Hm... I can't read orcish very well, but this looks like a report... written by an orc spy!

==Progression==

# [[Captain Vimes]]
