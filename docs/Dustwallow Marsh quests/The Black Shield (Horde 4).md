==Objectives==
Talk with [[Krog]] in [[Brackenwall Village]].

==Description==
Oh, I think I might have dropped too much acid onto the shield. Let me just rub a little...

Hm, kind of hard to read, but it looks like the name [[Mosarn]]. Never heard of him. Maybe Krog knows. Krog knows many people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8|40}}

==Completion==
Mosarn? Sounds familiar... I can't put my finger on it. Maybe it'll come to me later.

It probably isn't important. A shield can come from anywhere and not mean anything...
