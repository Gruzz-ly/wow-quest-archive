'''Hungry as an Ogre!''' is a quest in given by [["Swamp Eye" Jarl]] in [[Dustwallow Marsh]].

==Objectives==
Collect 8 Mirefin Heads from Mirefin Murlocs.
*[[Mirefin Head]] (8)

==Description==
You meet some people out here sometime. Nice people. Met an [[ogre]] once. Ogres get hungry just like me.

I'll never forget what he said. He said "[[Mudcrush Durtfeet|Mud]] big ogre. Me hungry. Go bash fishy. Bring Mud food. You feed Mud or Mud eat you."

So I got him those fish and he ate 'em up. That's when I started too. The heads are the best part, all soggy-like.

Don't crush those heads now. It makes them sad. Sad heads aren't good eating. Get me happy heads and I'll eat them and be happy too.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mud's Crushers
|Durtfeet Stompers
|Mud's Chain Boots
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*4350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Jarl's hungry. Just like that ogre.

==Completion==
Wonder what it's like to be an ogre. Big people have to eat more.

Ogres must be even hungrier than me. That doesn't sound very fun.
