==Objectives==
[[Balandar Brightstar]] in [[Brackenwall Village]] wants you to reclaim the Dawn Runner Cargo and rescue his first mate [[Ithania]] from forces of [[Theramore (nation)|Theramore]] at [[North Point Tower]].
*Rescue Ithania from North Point Tower
*[[Dawn Runner Cargo]]

==Description==
The [[ogre]]s here are useful for little more than crude jokes, sour ale, and bouts of headbutting. When my ship, the [[Dawn Runner]], ran aground, those curs from [[Theramore Isle|Theramore]] made off with my cargo and last surviving crewman. I made my way here searching for help, but those good-for-nothing ogres stared blankly at me when I told them my story.

I could use the help of a reliable <race> in recovering what remains of my cargo and freeing Ithania from North Point Tower, to the northeast, where they're being held.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Archer's Wristguard|Swamp Gas Gauntlets}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3700 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
Have you freed Ithania and reclaimed my cargo from those glorified privateers? 

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! As soon as Ithania has had time to rest and my preparations are complete, we'll depart this sodden wasteland and head back to civilization. 

==Notes==
North Point Tower (46,23) is located northeast of Brackenwall Village, on the road to Theramore.  Ithania is located on the first floor.  Clear the guards in the entrance and on the road in front of the tower, and rescue Ithania.   (The guards are level 35-36.)  She will say that she can make it to Balandar Brightscar on her own.  If the way is clear, let her go.  She will walk out to the road and disappear.

The [[Warped Crates]] are at the top of the tower.  You will have to clear the stairs and guard at the top of the stairs to get the crates.  The other guard won’t bother you while you get the crates.
