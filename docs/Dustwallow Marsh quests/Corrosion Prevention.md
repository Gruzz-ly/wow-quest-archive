==Objectives==
[[Moxie Steelgrille]] wants you to dissolve 10 oozes and report back to her at [[Beezil's Wreck]].
*Oozes Dissolved (10)
*[[Ooze Buster]] (provided)

==Description==
Just look at this area! It's swarming with oozes. If I don't find some way to keep them under control, they'll corrode the wreckage and the zeppelin's cargo!

I can't go back empty-handed, <class>! Help me dissolve these oozes before they've digested everything!

This device, when powered, will concentrate energy on the slimes, causing them to explode. The zeppelin's fragmented [[Power Core Fragment|power core]] should power the device. The one near the main crash works all the time, but the others flicker on and off.

==Progression==
Did you make any progress against those oozes?

==Completion==
Well, it does look a little cleaner out there...

I suppose it's time to get down to the business of salvaging this wreckage.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cobalt-Threaded Gloves
|Marshwarden's Tunic
|Rustproof Waistguard
|Corroded Helmet
|Marshwarden's Vest
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||50}} 
*4350 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gadgetzan]]

==Notes==
You must have the "[[Energized!]]" buff on in order to use the [[Ooze Buster]]. Staying near the zeppelin will keep you consistently buffed, the other power cores in the area work occasionally.

==Known bugs==
<!-- Still happening as of 2.4.3 -->
*Currently, using the Ooze Buster, you can target one ooze and while using the item, target another ooze. The second ooze will be killed while the first one will continue attacking you. You could essentially kill all needed oozes without having to move from the quest giver.
