==Objectives==
Plant the Witchbane Torch at the end of the dock and defeat the evil haunting [[Witch Hill]].
*[[Witch Hill]] Cleansed
*[[Witchbane Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
The torch is ready. Plant it at the end of the dock and be prepared to face whatever comes forth.

I have no idea what the torch's smoke may reveal... if anything emerges at all. I must say, I have my doubts about this kind of folk magic, but we haven't time for anything else. For your sake and [["Swamp Eye" Jarl|Jarl]]'s, I wish you luck.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mordant's Travel Tunic
|Scaled Marshwalkers
|Grimsby's Gaudy Girdle
|Grimsby's Chain Cinch}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*4350 [[XP]]
==Progress==
Is it over?

==Completion==
It worked?

<Mordant clears his throat.>

I mean... it worked! Jarl and I are in your debt, <name>. Now the only remaining problem is my friend's taste in furniture, and I'm afraid that won't be solved as easily.

==Notes==
*Place the torch near the end of the dock. A level 36 demon, [[Zelfrax]], will spawn.
*If Grimsby and Jarl are speaking to each other, the demon may not spawn.
