==Objectives==
Teleport eight Prototype Mana Bombs.
*[[Prototype Mana Bomb]]s Teleported (5)

==Description==
These precocious whelps seem to be trying to recreate the very bomb that leveled [[Theramore]]. Predictably, they have yet to succeed. Still, I would rather not give them the chance to stumble into a more effective solution.

If our [[Kalecgos|dear Aspect]] wishes to avoid simply turning the whole lot of them into [[mana]] dust, then I suppose I can refrain from carpeting the ruin in [[spellfrost]]. Someone will need to go and repossess their banal attempts at ordinance, though.

Do take care not to set them off, hmm?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Do not dally, mortal. Those bombs may be prototypes, but even an accidental detonation could present issues.

==Completion==
Well, <class>, I suppose you are not as hapless as most mortals who cross my path. You may deserve some modicum of recognition for your deft work.

...not from me, mind you. If you want a pat on the head, go ask Kalecgos.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:''The player gets the Azure Ward buff.''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|This death ward should blunt your blows and allow you to subdue the mages without killing them. Find us near the docks when you are done.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Azuregos]]|The path of mercy again, Kalecgos? I would have thought your encounter with [[Raszageth]] would have at last relieved you of that impulse.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Every time [[Malygos]] chose to intervene in the affairs of mortals, [[mage]]s died -- and where has that brought us? I will not perpetuate that cycle of destruction any longer.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Is that so? Show us, then. But do not expect us to clean up your mess if this goes wrong.}}
:''Azuregos leaves.''
:{{Text|say|Surigosa|You lead our flight, Kalecgos. We will do things your way. Let us hope your "peaceable solution" does not end buried under the corpses of [[dragon]]s.}}
:''Surigosa leaves.''
:{{Text|emote|Kalecgos sighs.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Thank you for your aid, my friend. With your help, we will show them that there is another way.}}
:''So does Kalec.''

Simply interact with the mana bombs to collect them.

;Approaching the dragons at the dock
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|You are soft, Kalecgos. You always have been. These mages are a threat and should be treated as such.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|They fly the flag of Theramore! These people are grieving. They fear for their lives. I am certain they can be reasoned with.}}
:{{Text|say|Surigosa|Quiet your steps, mortal, lest you spook [[Turi Flickerflame|their leader]].}}
