Seek Out Tabetha is the 1st quest in the '''Seek Out Tabetha''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Tabetha]] at her farm in the [[Quagmire]].

==Description==
The arms you captured in [[Blackhoof Village]] have not seen any combat beyond mere training exercises, which means the [[Grimtotem]]s who destroyed the [[Shady Rest]] are still at large.

To the south, in the heart of the Quagmire, lives the witch Tabetha. Though she is a [[human]], she has dealt honorably with us and trained some of our mages.

Ask her for assistance in tracking down the band of Grimtotem responsible for burning the inn. The [[Alliance]] must not be allowed to think we were complicit in the attack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Tabetha smiles slightly.>

Krog wishes me to scry for the Grimtotems, eh? Well, I have no need of magic in this case.

It seems we have a mutual enemy. The Grimtotems have built an outpost nearby and are a constant thorn in the side of me and my students.

==Progression==
{{Return to Krog}}
