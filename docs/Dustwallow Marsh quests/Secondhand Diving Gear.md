==Objectives==
Bring the Tool Kit and the Damaged Diving Gear to [[Renn McGill]] in the [[Dustwallow Marsh]].
*[[Damaged Diving Gear]]
*[[Tool Kit]]

==Description==
There's plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to [[Alcaz Island|Alcaz]], and the [[Defias]] have already got divers out there looking around. With the help of some of their gear, we can get you suited up and ready to join the hunt, but you'll have to do some creative "borrowing" first.

Search this island for a crate of diving gear and something to repair it with. When you've got them, bring them to me and I'll have your gear ready in no time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3,710 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's see what you managed to "borrow" from the Defias.

==Completion==
Wow, this is in worse shape than I'd thought and these tools...

Well, I said I'd get this back into working condition for you, so I'd better get to work.

==Notes==
Neither the Diving Gear nor the Tool Kit have fixed locations. They are both on the island near the three tents, or near the wrecked boat, though.

==Progression==
