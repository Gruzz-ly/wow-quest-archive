'''Lieutenant Paval Reethe''' seems to be involved in the destruction of the [[Shady Rest Inn]].

==Objectives==
Bring Reethe's Badge to [[Captain Garran Vimes]] in [[Theramore]].
*[[Reethe's Badge]] (provided)

==Description==
A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble. Brushing debris and ash caked onto the object reveals the insignia of a gold anchor on white enameled on the surface: the sign of Theramore.

Underneath the anchor is embossed the name "[[Paval Reethe|Lieutenant Paval Reethe]]".

==Progress==
Have you found anything of interest at the Shady Rest Inn?

==Completion==
It's never good news when a guard's badge is brought to me.

Sometimes it's a man or woman who's fallen in battle, and I'm left to bring the news to the grieving family. Other times we never find out what happened to them. And other times it's even worse than that.

==Notes==
This quest is unusual in that the background of the quest description box is a steel gray color.

==Progression==
This is part of [[The Shady Rest Inn quest chain]]:
{{They Call Him Smiling Jim}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Given new ID, numbers adjusted to new leveling path.}}
