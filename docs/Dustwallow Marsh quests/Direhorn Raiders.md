==Objectives==
Kill 12 Grimtotem in [[Direhorn Post]].
* Direhorn Grimtotems killed (12)

==Description==
The Grimtotems up at [[Direhorn Post]], just to the north, are getting bolder by the day. At night, you can often hear them chanting about their deeds in battle against people who've tried to settle here.

They're determined to drive us from [[Tabetha]]'s [[Tabetha's Farm|farm]] even though she's trained generations of apprentices here. We're defended the farm as best we can, but [[Apprentice Garion]] was wounded in the last attack.

Go to Direhorn post and kill any Grimtotem you can find! The attacks must stop.

==Progress==
Have you made any progress in stopping the Grimtotem attacks?

==Completion==
<Apprentice Moriann nods.>

Good. Can't say I'll miss the company, if you can call it that. You'd think at least in the middle of the swamp you'd get some privacy, you know?
