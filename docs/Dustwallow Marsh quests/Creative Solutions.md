==Objectives==
Pacify the [[Hedge wizard|rogue mages]] of the [[Sullied Banner]].
*[[Militant Arcanist|Arcanists]] Pacified (8)

==Description==
I have always hoped that [[mage]]s would once again walk the streets of [[Theramore]]. This, however, is not what I had in mind.

If this Sullied Banner truly intends to reconstruct a working [[mana bomb]], then they must be stopped--but I will not repeat the mistakes [[Malygos]] made. There must be a way to reason with them.

I shall place an enchantment upon you that will allow you to subdue the mages without killing them. See to it that they cannot continue their ill-intended actions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
These mages walk a dangerous path, but I do not believe that they are beyond redemption.

==Completion==
[[Arcane]] [[magic]] has always been well-suited to matters of stasis and security. I am pleased that we could put it to such effect here.

Still, the question remains: what drove these mages to such reckless action in the first place?

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:''The player gets the Azure Ward buff.''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|This death ward should blunt your blows and allow you to subdue the mages without killing them. Find us near the docks when you are done.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|The path of mercy again, Kalecgos? I would have thought your encounter with [[Raszageth]] would have at last relieved you of that impulse.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Every time Malygos chose to intervene in the affairs of mortals, [[mage]]s died -- and where has that brought us? I will not perpetuate that cycle of destruction any longer.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Azuregos]]|Is that so? Show us, then. But do not expect us to clean up your mess if this goes wrong.}}
:''Azuregos leaves.''
:{{Text|say|[[Surigosa]]|You lead our flight, Kalecgos. We will do things your way. Let us hope your "peaceable solution" does not end buried under the corpses of [[dragon]]s.}}
:''Surigosa leaves.''
:{{Text|emote|Kalecgos sighs.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Thank you for your aid, my friend. With your help, we will show them that there is another way.}}
:''So does Kalec.''

Attack the enemies and get them to 25%, when they are pacified and teleported back to the dragons.

;Approaching the dragons at the dock
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|You are soft, Kalecgos. You always have been. These mages are a threat and should be treated as such.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|They fly the flag of Theramore! These people are grieving. They fear for their lives. I am certain they can be reasoned with.}}
:{{Text|say|Surigosa|Quiet your steps, mortal, lest you spook [[Turi Flickerflame|their leader]].}}
