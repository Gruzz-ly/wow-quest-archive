==Objectives==
Kill Goreclaw the Ravenous and report to [[Drazzit Dripvalve]] at [[Mudsprocket]].
*[[Goreclaw the Ravenous]] slain

==Description==
Travelers and [[Steamwheedle Cartel|Steamwheedle]] personnel working in the field are advised to avoid the [[Bloodfen Burrow]] to the west of town.

The area is overrun with raptors lead{{sic}} by the cruel and cunning Goreclaw the Ravenous, who has already killed two Steamwheedle engineers.

Drazzit Dripvalve has authorized a generous reward to be paid to the individual who rids Mudsprocket of this menace.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Protective Engineer's Leggings

|Raptorhide Chain Leggings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gadgetzan]]

==Progress==
You look pretty satisfied with  yourself. Come to claim the bounty on that monstrous raptor?

==Completion==
Thank goodness someone's finally taken me up on that offer. I was just thinking that I might need to triple the reward to get that stupid raptor killed, and our budget couldn't afford that!

== Notes ==
* Goreclaw can be found near the Bloodfen Cave at about 31,65 in Dustwallow Marsh.

*He's a level 39 non-elite.
