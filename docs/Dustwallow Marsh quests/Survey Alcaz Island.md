==Objectives==
Speak to [[Cassa Crimsonwing]] and use one of her [[gryphon]]s to survey [[Alcaz Island]].

==Description==
It looks like [[Renn McGill|Renn]]'s hunch about Alcaz Island was right. We need to survey that island, but it would take a whole brigade of troops to fight our way in there.

[[Theramore]]'s defenses can't weather such a hit, so I've arranged with Cassa Crimsonwing, the apprentice to Theramore's [[Baldruc|gryphon master]], to allow you to use one of her beasts to survey Alcaz from the air.

Alcaz Island holds the key to the mystery of the [[Defias]]' involvement in this kidnapping.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Swamp Gas Gauntlets
|Archer's Wristguard
|Archer's Chain Bracer
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*4,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your aerial survey of Alcaz Island?

==Completion==
<Lady Jaina listens intently as you report the results of your aerial survey.>

A rune circle, [[dragonkin]]? The Defias have allied themselves with [[Katrana Prestor|HER]]? The traitor?

<Lady Jaina composes herself and prepares to explain.>

==Notes==
*Players mount a gryphon, and fly north over and around Alcaz Island. Upon it are several buildings, and above it is at least one of the [[black dragonflight]], a [[Firemane Drake]].
*As of ''Legion'', the rune circle and dragons that Jaina mentions are not actually present on the island.
*Before [[patch 3.0.2]], this quest was followed up with [[Warn Bolvar!]]. The follow-up quest has since been removed, and instead Jaina narrates the story of King Varian's abduction after the quest is completed.
*After [[patch 4.0.3a]], this quest was followed up with [[Proof of Treachery]].

:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Perhaps I should explain...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I had arranged for a secret summit between Warchief Thrall and King Wrynn, here in Theramore.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The king was to travel here by ship, in secret. But the ship never arrived, and King Wrynn disappeared.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Your help enabled us to connect the Defias to the mastermind behind the abduction, Onyxia, who was posing as a member of the royal court.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Meanwhile, the king managed to escape his captors, and returned to Stormwind to deal with Onyxia.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will send word that you have discovered the link to the Defias. I was a fool to think them broken with the defeat of Edwin Van Cleef, and King Wrynn will want to make an example of all who remain.}}
