==Objectives==
Distribute the Altered Leaflets to 6 Theramore Guards.
* Leaflets Distributed x6
* [[Altered Leaflets]] (provided)

==Description==
I've altered the leaflets you captured from the deserters' mercenary friends at the docks.  Now, anyone who reads them will get an entirely different view of the deserters and their aims.

If we distribute these to enough of the guards, the deserters will be too embarrassed to ever reestablish their presence within our walls.

<Calia hands you a stack of the altered leaflets.>

Why don't you get started while I plan our next move?

==Progress==
I thought I heard laughter coming from the [[barracks]].  Did you distribute those leaflets I gave you?

==Completion==
<Calia chuckles as you describe the guards' reactions to the propaganda.>

Just as I'd hoped!  I think it's safe to say any deserter agents who try to infiltrate Theramore will be laughed right out of town!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|s=40}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Notes ==
: {{gossip|''You look like an intelligent person.  Why don't you read one of these leaflets and give it some thought?''}}

* {{text|say|Theramore Guard|What a bunch of lunatics!  You actually believe this stuff?}}

* {{text|say|Theramore Guard|I'd never join anything like this.  Better keep this, though.  It'll come in handy in the privy...}}
