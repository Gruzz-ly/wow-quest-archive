==Objectives==
Speak with [[Captain Garran Vimes]] in [[Theramore]].

==Description==
I can't help it if I feel sorry for ol' Jim there. He wasn't always like that. Ran an inn out in the marsh for a while, wonderful place.

Look, I don't really want to talk about it. Bring it up with Captain Vimes if you really have to.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*280 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|50}} at level 70)

==Completion==
James Hyal's his real name. He opened an inn at the edge of the Barrens. Wanted to make a nice place for travelers to stop over...

Might be he was thinking too big, but the inn did do well for a while. Then we lost control of the roads in the marsh, and the ogres took over.

James was too stubborn to give up his dream for safety within our walls, and the Shady Rest Inn was burnt to the ground. We're investigating, but haven't had much luck. If you want to help out, see what you can find in the rubble.

==Progression==
This is part of [[The Shady Rest Inn quest chain]].
