==Completion==
My nephew said you aided him with his research in [[Dustwallow]], and that you helped his associate out of a tight spot.  Well, we Sterns stick together and we don't ignore our friends!

So wash your hands, <name>, because we're about to throw a party in your honor!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Moist Towelette}}

==Notes==
You will receive only one Moist Towelette on this quest. Upon turn in, all around the room [[Feast Fruit]]s, [[Feast Fish]]es, [[Feast Goblet]]s and [[Feast Boar]]s are spawned. From those, you can respectively loot 3 [[Snapvine Watermelon]], 6 [[Rockscale Cod]], 20 [[Sweet Nectar]] and 3 [[Wild Hog Shank]].
