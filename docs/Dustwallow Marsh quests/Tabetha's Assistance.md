==Objectives==
Speak with [[Tabetha]] at [[Tabetha's Farm|her farm]].

==Description==
I can't spare any men to help search for a second [[Grimtotem]] outpost, but I think I know of someone who might be able to help you.

Deep in the [[Quagmire]], to the south, there is a small farmstead owned by Tabetha. She may seem little more than an old hermit, but the truth is that she's a mage and a scryer of some renown. Follow the road south to her farm and seek her help in finding the culprits responsible for the massacre at the [[Shady Rest Inn]].

==Completion==
So you want me to scry for Grimtotems, eh? And what will you say when I tell you there's no need?

== Rewards ==
* 410 [[XP]]

==Notes==
Both [[Confirming the Suspicion]] and [[Arms of the Grimtotems]] must be complete before Darill will offer this quest.

==Progression==
