The Brood of Onyxia is the 3rd quest in the '''The Brood of Onyxia''' quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Draz'Zilb in [[Brackenwall Village]] wants you to destroy 5 Eggs of Onyxia.
*[[Egg of Onyxia]] destroyed (5)

== Description ==
Onyxia's brood has been scattered across the [[Dragonmurk]]. It is imperative that no more whelps be permitted to hatch.

Make haste to [[Wyrmbog]] in the south of [[Dustwallow Marsh]]. Surely, she has made her lair there. Track down the evil dragon's eggs and destroy them.

We will never reclaim [[Stonemaul Village]] if the surrounding area remains a breeding ground.

As for Mok'Morokk... I have other plans for the sod.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Encarmine Spaulders
|Wyrmbog Amulet
|Encarmine Pauldrons
}}

You will also receive:
* 2,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Splendid! It will be sometime before Onyxia can produce more eggs.

On behalf of my people, I thank you, <name>.

I have asked much of you so far. Perhaps you can do the [[Stonemaul Clan]] one last service.

Mok'Morokk is not fit to lead us. [[Tharg]] would make an excellent leader but is hindered by his injuries and age. Drive Mok'Morokk from this place by force. Only then can we appoint a new leader to return us to our proper home in the south.

==Progression==
This quest is part of a chain.
