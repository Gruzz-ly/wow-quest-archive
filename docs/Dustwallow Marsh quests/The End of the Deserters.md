==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gavis Greyshield.jpg|Gavis Greyshield|Former lieutenant of the Theramore militia.}}
Defeat [[Gavis Greyshield]] aboard the ship southeast of [[Theramore]].

==Description==
Now that we've eliminated the deserters from Theramore, it's time to complete this operation.  My local contacts have reported that the deserters base their operations in a ship moored on a small island to the southeast of the docks.

Arresting their leader, [[Gavis Greyshield]], should cause the others to lose their will to fight.  Find him within the ship and convince him to surrender.  I wouldn't be surprised if he puts up a bit of a fight for show, but then surrenders when he understands that he can't win.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Journeyman's Helm
|Boots of the Skirmisher
|Proudmoore Cloak
|Journeyman's Headguard
|Treads of the Skirmisher
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your assault on the deserter base?

==Completion==
Gavis' request isn't as outlandish as it might sound.  With the proper handling, [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina]] can return the deserters to the fold, but that is her decision, of course.

It's been a pleasure working with you, <name>.  Without your help, I doubt the operation would've gone so smoothly.  When I make my report in [[Stormwind]], it will name you as the <class> who ended the deserter threat.

==Notes==
When players defeat Gavis Greyshield, he says the following:
: {{text|say|Gavis Greyshield|I surrender!  Stay your blade!}}
: {{text|say|Gavis Greyshield|I will go with you.  Just spare my men.  They're good lads who've only made a mistake...}}
