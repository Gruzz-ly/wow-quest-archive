==Objectives==
[[Mordant Grimsby]] at [[Swamplight Manor]] wants you to gather information from 10 [[Risen Husk]]s or [[Risen Spirit (Dustwallow Marsh)|Risen Spirit]]s.
*Information Gathered (10)

==Description==
I traveled out here to pay [["Swamp Eye" Jarl|Jarl]] a visit at his new home and it's been a nonstop horror show ever since! There's something seriously wrong here and I can't be the only one who sees it...

Have you seen the ghosts and corpses shambling about [[Witch Hill]]? I've a feeling that if anyone knows what happened here, it is them. Seek out these risen husks and risen spirits in the surrounding area, grant them rest through combat, and see what you can learn from them before this evil consumes Jarl!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|s=40}}
*3500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you learned from the spirits haunting this place?

==Completion==
<Mordant produces a small sheet of paper and pen, beginning to scribble down notes on your findings.>

From your findings, the spirits in this place must amount to everyone who ever lived on this land, not just the previous occupants.

Something has been corrupting and killing them. Those who follow don't learn the truth until it's too late. We have to put an end to this, <name>!

==Notes==
The ghosts say such things as ...
* It was ... terrible... the demon...
* The darkness... the corruption... they came too quickly for anyone to know...
* the darkness will consume all... all the living...
* It is too late for us, living one.  Take yourself and your friend away from here before you both are... claimed...
* It is too late for Jarl... its hold is too strong...
* Go away, whoever you are!  Witch Hill is mine... mine!
