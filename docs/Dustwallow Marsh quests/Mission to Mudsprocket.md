==Objectives==
Speak with [[Drazzit Dripvalve]] at [[Mudsprocket]].

==Description==
The [[Steamwheedle Cartel]] has recently established a new outpost in the southern part of [[Dustwallow Marsh]]. It's called Mudsprocket, if I recall, and it's located on the main road south out of [[Tabetha's Farm]] and the [[Stonemaul Ruins]].

This is an excellent opportunity for us to establish new trade contacts and [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina]] wants me to send a representative down there to establish contact. Would you be willing to go?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3,005 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So [[Theramore]] is interested in doing business? Well, that's not an offer I'd turn down. Supplies are pretty scarce here right now, so we need all the business contacts we can get!

==Notes==
*[[Alliance]] members can pick up either this quest or [[Help for Mudsprocket]] from [[Tabetha's Farm]].

==Progression==
