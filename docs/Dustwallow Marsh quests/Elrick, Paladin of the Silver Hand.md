==Notes==
;Dialogue
{{gossip|One moment, please. [[Katherine the Pure|Katherine]] sent you? Who are you?}}

:I am called Elrick and I am a paladin of [[Knights of the Silver Hand|The Silver Hand]]. I came just before you did and by the time I had arrived, the merchant we were to meet had already left town, headed north deeper into the swamp. I was just about to set off after him when you arrived.

:{{gossip|Do we know anything else? Was he alone? Does anyone here know anything about him? Was he pursued by anyone else?}}

::<Elrick shifts his weight impatiently.>

::We do not have time for this! The merchant is going to get away if we do not act now. Please, let us go in all haste before it's too late!

::{{gossip|<You notice that one of the patrons standing at the bar is focused intently on something and is wearing a hard expression. There is a full, untouched mug of ale before him.>}}

:::What will it be, <name>? Are you coming, or should I give chase without you?

:::{{gossip|<Your gaze next falls on the barkeep who has been dutifully cleaning a dish. She has been focused intently on that same dish since you walked in. You notice a bead of sweat dripping down the side of her face, despite a noticeable chill in the air.>}}

::::<As you turn back to Elrick, you notice his grip tighten on his mace. His expression hardens.>

::::{{gossip|<You clear your throat and speak loudly so everyone in the room can hear you.><br><br>Before what comes next... does anyone want to leave?}}

''Elrick turns hostile and attacks, along with the [[Stern-faced Bar Patron]]. [[Innkeeper Janene]] runs in fear.''
