==Objectives==
[[Nat Pagle]] wants you to catch the following fish:

Misty Reed Mahi Mahi from the [[Misty Reed Strand]] in the [[Swamp of Sorrows]].

A Sar'theris Striker from the [[Sar'theris Strand]] in [[Desolace]].

Feralas Ahi from the [[Verdantis River]] of [[Feralas]].

Savage Coast Blue Sailfin from the [[Savage Coast]] of [[Stranglethorn Vale]].

Return to Nat Pagle when you have reeled them all in!
* [[Feralas Ahi]]
* [[Misty Reed Mahi Mahi]]
* [[Sar'theris Striker]]
* [[Savage Coast Blue Sailfin]]

==Description==
Can't say I really enjoy fishin' much. Figure I been at it for a good 20 or 30 years now.

I reckon people are driven to do what they do for different reasons.

Now, I'm not saying you need to fish for 30 years or catch every fish in the sea to become a master fisherman. I reckon you just need to be determined - determined enough to sit on your duff for hours at a time, doin' nothin'.

I'll tell you what, catch me a few rare fish and I'll teach you a thing or two. Here's a list:

==Progress==
Anything bitin' today? 

==Completion==
Now that's a fine catch!

Come over here, lemme show you how to set a few lines.

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Nat's Lucky Fishing Pole]]

You will also receive: {{cost||33|0}} (at level 80)

As of [[patch 3.1]], this quest no longer teaches you [[Fishing#Levels|artisan fishing]].

==Notes==
You need a Fishing Skill of 225 to accept this quest. 

*[[Feralas Ahi]] → Feralas - {{coords|62|51|Feralas}}
*[[Sar'theris Striker]] → Desolace - {{coords|25|77|Desolace}}
*[[Savage Coast Blue Sailfin]] → Stranglethorn Vale - {{coords|33|32|Stranglethorn Vale}}
*[[Misty Reed Mahi Mahi]] → Swamp of Sorrows - {{coords|93|40|Swamp of Sorrows}}

As well as looting the quest fish, you will loot another fish or item that would usually be fished up in the area if you did not have the quest.

Be sure to drop your raid group!  As with most quests, you cannot get the drops when you're in a raid.

==Patch 3.1.0 addition==
Players who had already completed the quest can visit Nat Pagle and do a new version of the quest to instantly receive the item.

;Completion
Well hello there, young <race>. Either my memory is failing me, or I forgot to give you this the last time we spoke....

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.1.0|note=This quest is no longer required to attain the [[Artisan]] fishing level. The quest now offers a special superior-quality fishing pole instead. If you already completed the quest, you can visit Nat Pagle to receive this fishing pole.}}
*{{Patch 1.8.0|note=The minimum level for the Artisan Fishing quest line has been lowered to 35.}}
