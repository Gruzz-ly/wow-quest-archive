==Objectives==
Speak to [[Inspector Tarem]] at the [[Shady Rest Inn]].

==Description==
Poor [[James Hyal|James]] never recovered from the destruction of the Shady Rest and the murder of his family. The boys and I are doing what we can to find the monsters who did this.

I've sent our best investigator, Inspector Tarem, out to the ruins, but this is too big a job for any one man. If you'd lend Tarem a hand, we'd appreciate it. Light knows, we'd all like to be out there helping.

The main road will lead you to the inn, but take care. Your journey will take you beyond the protection of my soldiers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*330 [[XP]] (or {{cost|s=2|c=10}} at 70)

==Completion==
It's good to see that [[Captain Garran Vimes|Captain Vimes]] is finally assigning others to this investigation.

I've used a reflective powder to dust the area. It will reveal suspicious objects and markings, helping you to focus your efforts. Look over anything the dust illuminates.

==Notes==
This quest was added in [[patch 2.3.0]] as a more obvious means of getting people to the [[Shady Rest Inn]] to pick up the three quests out there.

When completing this quest, Tarem gives you the buff "Spread Reflective Dust", which lasts for 2 minutes. While buffed, 3 arrows appear in the general area. Hoofprints are next to Tarem, a Theramore Guard Badge is on the floor of the Inn, and a Black Shield is over the fireplace. Inspect each of the items to pick up a new quest. Players can ask Tarem to reapply the buff if necessary.

* [[Black Shield]] --> [[The Black Shield (Alliance)|The Black Shield]]
* [[Hoofprints]] --> [[Suspicious Hoofprints (Alliance)|Suspicious Hoofprints]]
* [[Theramore Guard Badge]] --> [[Lieutenant Paval Reethe (Alliance 1)|Lieutenant Paval Reethe]]

==Progression==
This is part of [[The Shady Rest Inn quest chain]].
