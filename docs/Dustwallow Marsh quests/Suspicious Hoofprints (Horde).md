==Objectives==
Report about the suspicious prints at the [[Shady Rest Inn]] to [[Krog]] in [[Brackenwall Village]].

==Description==
Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at max level)

==Completion==
Hoofprints... It could have been the [[quilboar]], I suppose. Or maybe even the centaur. Their presence in the [[Barrens]] is not insignificant, and I would not think it a stretch to commit such an act.

Did I tell you? It wasn't just that the inn was burned down... The owner's woman and pup were killed. Bad business, that.

Nonetheless, I will send [[Kagoro]] to find where the tracks lead.
