==Objectives==
Speak to [[Tabetha]] at her farm in the [[Quagmire]].

==Description==
A [[human]] woman named Tabetha lives on a small [[farm]] near the middle of the [[Dustwallow Marsh|marsh]]. Ordinarily, I wouldn't associate with a human, but her help has proven useful at times.

Unfortunately, she's been out of touch for quite some time now and I'm looking for someone to travel down to her farm to see if everything's all right.

If you follow the road south out of the village, then into the swamp's interior, you'll find her farm near the middle of the Quagmire.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's fortunate [[Nazeer Bloodpike|Nazeer]] thought to send someone. We've got some new neighbors and they've been nothing but pests since they set up camp.

==Patch changes==
