==Objectives==
Report to [[Captain Wymor]] at [[Sentry Point]].

==Description==
Reports from our scout patrols have recently taken a disturbing turn. They tell of men wearing red [[Defias]] bandanas walking the [[Dreadmurk Shore]] north of [[Theramore]]'s walls.

Wreckage in the area suggests they may be survivors of a shipwreck, but our information is limited. Captain Wymor at Sentry Point, a guard tower to the north of the city, is looking for help in following up on the reports.

==Completion==
<The captain makes no effort to hide that he's assessing your abilities.>

So you've heard about the recent shipwreck off the coast? Good, I could use some help confirming my suspicions about the survivors. Welcome aboard, <name>.

==Rewards==
* 600 [[XP]]
