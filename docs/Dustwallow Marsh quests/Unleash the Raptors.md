==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Lukas]] at [[North Point Tower]] wants you to place the [[Raptor Bait]] near the windmill in [[Blackhoof Village]].

==Description==
Now that we've got our raptors, our next move is to "encourage" them to attack the [[Grimtotem]]s at Blackhoof Village to the northwest.

I've got a leftover haunch of... well, it doesn't really matter what it is. It'll be your bait. Set it down on the ground in Blackhoof Village near the windmill in the center of the settlement. The raptors should take care of the rest, if their training took.

==Rewards==

|Book of the Adept

|Pendant of Ferocity
|Crested Chain Epaulets

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you set the raptors loose in Blackhoof Village?

==Completion==
<The sergeant doesn't bother to hide his grin.>

Good. That ought to forestall a raid or two.
