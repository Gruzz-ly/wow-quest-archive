==Objectives==
Return to Kalecgos in the [[Azure Span]].
*Take the [[Portal to the Azure Span|portal]] to [[Kalec]] in the [[Azure Archives]]

==Description==
I do not understand what would drive [[Turi Flickerflame]] and her [[Sullied Banner|band of mages]] to attempt what they have done here today. But I do understand the pain of losing family. I understand the fear and regret that follows you wherever you go.

I have much to think about. I imagine Kalecgos has much yet to do in the [[Dragon Isles]]--return there with him. I will follow soon... I need some time to think upon what happened here today.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}

{{itembox||q1=5|Drake's Shadowflame Crest Fragment
|q2=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Welcome back, <name>.

==Completion==
[[Surigosa]] and [[Azuregos]] are hardly the only members of [[Blue dragonflight|my flight]] to question my more measured approach to the misuse of [[magic]]. I'm glad for their perspectives--and their willingness to check my optimism.

Still, I hope that they will come to see things as I do now.

Come. We have much yet to do.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Thank you for your aid, my friend -- and for yours, Surigosa. I do not know where we would be without your hard work.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|You three should get back to the Isles. I will meet you there; I need to speak with Turi first.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Azuregos]]|I must admit, Kalecgos, I did not think your plan would work. But you seem to have cleaned things up rather nicely.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|No... Not yet. There is more work to be done.}}
:{{Text|emote|[[Surigosa]] sighs.}}
:{{Text|say|Surigosa|Kalecgos... Oh, blast it all.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Well go on then, hero. No doubt you wish to hear what is said in there. As for me, I have other matters to see to, now that this mess has been resolved.}}
:''Azuregos teleports away, and Kalecgos and Surigosa, in her gnome visage, enter the tower where Turi is held.''
:{{Text|say|Turi Flickerflame|Come to laugh at me, then? Or maybe just to crush me underfoot?}}
:{{Text|say|Surigosa|I want to know why you are doing this. Why would you try to recreate something so horrid?}}
:{{Text|say|Turi Flickerflame|What choice did we have? We had to protect ourselves. I couldn't do a thing to stop the first mana bomb! And because of that, [[Rhonin]] and [[Kinndy Sparkshine|Kinndy]] -- everyone is gone!}}
:{{Text|say|Turi Flickerflame|You were supposed to protect us. You were supposed to keep things like this from happening! But you didn't. And now our home is gone. We can't ever get it back.}}
:{{Text|emote|Surigosa remains silent.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|...Turi Flickerflame, yes? I remember you. You were one of Rhonin's apprentices.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|You speak the truth. We tried to protect the [[Focusing Iris]]. We tried to protect [[Theramore]] and its people. But we failed.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Nothing I say can ever bring back the fallen. There are no words to properly express the regret I feel towards what happened here. But this?}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|We can move forward together, Turi. We can be better than those who came before.}}
:{{Text|say|Turi Flickerflame|I just... I just miss them so much.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I know. But come. I would hear your thoughts on the future that you want to build for your allies. As one of Rhonin's apprentices, I would very much appreciate your insight.}}
:{{Text|emote|Surigosa watches the pair silently. She glances towards you before nodding towards the portal.}}
