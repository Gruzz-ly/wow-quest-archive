# Dustwallow Marsh storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Dustwallow.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]
'''[[Dustwallow Marsh]]''' is a level 35-40 zone in [[Central Kalimdor]]. Both the [[Alliance]] and the [[Horde]] have a presence here, at the [[human]] port city of [[Theramore Isle]] and the [[ogre]]-populated [[Brackenwall Village]], respectively. In addition, [[goblin]]s of the [[Steamwheedle Cartel]] have set up the town of [[Mudsprocket]] to the southwest.

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Dustwallow Marsh Quests]].
