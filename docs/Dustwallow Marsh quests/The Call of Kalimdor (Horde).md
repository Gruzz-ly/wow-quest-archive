==Objectives==
Ride the ship from [[Booty Bay]] to [[Ratchet]], then speak with [[Gazlowe]].

==Description==
Say, you haven't seen a fish about this long? Short fins? Responds to the name [[Steve (fish)|Steve]]? He's blue?

Never mind, I'll keep looking.

Actually... there was another reason I came here to Booty Bay. Boss [[Krog]], over in [[Dustwallow Marsh|Dustwallow]], is looking for new blood. Someone to help us [[Stonemaul clan|Stonemaul]] from getting overrun. You look strong enough.

Wait on the edge of the pier for the next ship, then ride to Ratchet. Gazlowe should be able to help you from there.

Steve? Steve! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yeah?  What can I do for ya?
