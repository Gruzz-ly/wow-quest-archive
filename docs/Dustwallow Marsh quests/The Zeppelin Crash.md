==Objectives==
Speak with [[Moxie Steelgrille]] at [[Beezil's Wreck]].

==Description==
Not long ago, a goblin zeppelin crashed to the east. A representative of the [[Steamwheedle Cartel]] passed through here a few days ago.

She was looking for information about the zeppelin's cargo and it's pilot, Beezil, but none of us really got a good look at the crash. I doubt she'll be able to clean up after the wreck by herself, much less recover whatever cargo the vessel might have carried.

If you have time, you may want to check up on her out at [[Beezil's Wreck]], due east of here, near the mountains.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*440 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|70}} at level 70)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Gadgetzan]]

==Completion==
So those hermit mages sent you? How can I be sure that I can trust you?

I suppose I can use the help. There's not much a mage would be interested in, anyway.
