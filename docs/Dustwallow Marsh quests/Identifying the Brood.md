==Objectives==
[[Draz'Zilb]] in [[Brackenwall Village]] would like you to bring him 7 Searing Tongues and 7 Searing Hearts.
*[[Searing Tongue]] (7)
*[[Searing Heart]] (7)

==Description==
Whilst that craven fool, [[Overlord Mok'Morokk|Mok'Morokk]], wallows in power and [[Tharg]] wrestles the demons of sorrow and vengeance and vies for leadership of the clan, I seem to be the only one concerned with identifying the source of aggression on our old home.

Why the puzzled stare, <name>? Expecting me to speak like an uncouth ruffian merely because I am an ogre?

Now back to business, bring to me the hearts and tongues from the whelps and hatchlings. I shall trace the root of this evil... 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Brooding Mask
|Searing Dagger
|Whelp Slaying Axe
|Brooding Collar
}}

You will also receive:
*6,200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||37|50}} at max level)

==Progress==
With the hearts and tongues of scorched offspring of the black dragon army, I can decipher what wretched beast introduced her spawn into our home. Perhaps with a greater knowledge of our aggressors, we can seek to destroy them once and for all and reclaim [[Stonemaul Village]] from ruin.

Of course, convincing Mok'Morokk to move his lethargic, fat mass out of this muck hole is going to be an epic quest in and of itself...

==Completion==
'Twas a perilous affair, no doubt, collecting all of these hearts and tongues. I shall delve into the depths of the arcane to trace the origin of the black menace which has descended upon our former home.
