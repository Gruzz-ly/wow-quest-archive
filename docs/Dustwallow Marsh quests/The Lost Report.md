==Objectives==
Bring the Spy's Report to [[Nazeer Bloodpike]] in [[Brackenwall Village]].
* [[Spy's Report]] (provided)

== Description ==
Sifting through the [[Loose Dirt]], the severed hand of an orc is found. And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube. And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment.

The parchment is a report made by an orc who spent weeks spying on the city of [[Theramore]].

After scanning the parchment, it is clear that it must be brought to the orc spymaster in Brackenwall Village.

==Progress==
You have something for me?

==Completion==
Good work, <name>.  Our agent, [[Marg Nighteye]], was stationed outside Theramore.  He was charged to spy on the city.  

This is his latest report, and it may be his last—from your testimony, I fear that Marg met his end in the swamp...

== Reward ==
You will receive: {{cost|s=75|c=}}

== Notes ==
Before [[patch 4.0.3a]] this quest was part of a quest line that continued with [[The Severed Head]].
