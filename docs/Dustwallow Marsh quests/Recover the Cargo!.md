==Objectives==
[[File:Recover the Cargo objective.jpg|thumb|Salvaged Strongboxes appear below the water under floating burning debris.]]
Collect 1 Salvaged Strongbox.
*[[Salvaged Strongbox]]
*[[Renn's Supplies]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, I was able to make enough repairs to this gear to let you dive for awhile, anyway. I wouldn't count on it holding out for a long time, though.

The wreckage of the ship is strewn along the bottom from the east coast of this island out toward [[Alcaz Island]]. While that helm holds out, locate pieces of the wreckage on the bottom between this island and Alcaz. Use this salvage kit to search the wreckage for pieces of the cargo. Be careful not to venture too close to Alcaz Island. Those [[hydra]] are fierce.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fleshripper (dagger)
|Crimson Barbut
|Serrated Gladius
}}
*{{cost||40}}
*3,710 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did your search of the wreckage reveal anything about the [[Defias]] cargo?

==Completion==
<Renn rifles through the contents of the strongboxes you recovered.>

Good work. Now, let's see if our 'precious cargo' is in here....

:Renn McGill says: Hey... what's this? A pair of manacles and not just any. These are enchanted. This cargo, it wasn't a thing... it was a person!</font>

==Notes==
Accept the quest to receive [[Renn's Supplies]], which contains the [[Repaired Diving Gear]] and [[Salvage Kit]]. The Diving Gear has a 60 minute duration. Talk to Renn if you run out of time to get another.

Look for floating wreckage (much like fishing schools) on the surface of the water, then swim down to the boxes on the bottom of the sea and use the Salvage Kit to collect them. Also, wreckage with fewer fish contains a box and not a murloc.
