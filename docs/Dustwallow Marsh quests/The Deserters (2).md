'''The Deserters''' are a group of [[Theramore]] soldiers who left their posts.

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Captain Garran Vimes]] in [[Theramore]] about [[Paval Reethe|Reethe]]. 

== Description ==
Reethe? That coward?

We threw him out of camp because he insisted on raiding the supplies of the [[ogres]] up at [[Brackenwall Village]]. We're not so many in number that we could stand up to those mindless brutes.

He crossed the line one too many times, so we left him to fend for himself.

Now, I helped you out... So, why don't you help us out and forget you bumped into us?

== Completion ==
I will send [[Lieutenant Caldwell]] to deal with the deserters at [[Lost Point]]. In addition, I will instruct him to find Reethe. The marsh is not so big and trackless that he should be unable to find him. 

== Notes ==
This quest concludes the [[Theramore Guard Badge]] fork of the quest chain. Complete the [[Hoofprints]] and [[Black Shield]] forks to gain access to the conclusion.

In the [[Questioning Reethe|Horde version]] of this quest, the player and his ogre escort find Reethe at the same time as Lieutenant Caldwell. Cadwell tries to kill Reethe before he says anything. This has led some people to believe that perhaps the destruction of the [[Shady Rest Inn]] was to cover something else up and Cadwell might be involved.
