==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Darkmist Eggs in [[Darkmist Cavern]].
*Darkmist Egg (8)

==Description==
The [[spider]]s that occupy Darkmist Cavern to the northwest are another vicious threat to us here. They are nothing the [[ogre]]s cannot handle, but splitting our attention to them when [[Theramore]]'s forces lurk nearby is a deadly mistake.

I need someone to destroy the eggs inside Darkmist Cavern, to cut off this infestation. You will find the eggs in the deepest part of the webbed mines... along with their guardians.

==Rewards== 
You will receive:
*{{cost||40|}}
*3,500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
This is a great relief, <class>. Thank you.
