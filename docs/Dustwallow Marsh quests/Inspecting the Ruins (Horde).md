==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Shady Rest Inn]] in at the border of the [[Barrens]] in [[Dustwallow Marsh]].

==Description==
If you follow the road south from the village, and then west toward the Barrens, you'll come across the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn.

[[Theramore]] has sent an investigator to discover how the inn met its fate. I had a man placed in that inn as a [[spy]] and I don't trust in the competence of these [[human]]s to uncover what happened.

Whatever you find, don't give a scrap of it to that investigator. We'll handle this ourselves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The inspector regards you with what can only be disdain and distrust.>

Leave this place be, errand boy, or I'll be sure to bring a contingent of guard with me next time to sink the lesson home.

==Notes==
When completing this quest, Tarem gives you the buff "Spread Reflective Dust", which lasts for 2 minutes. While buffed, 3 arrows appear in the general area. Hoofprints are next to Tarem, a Theramore Guard Badge is on the floor of the Inn, and a Black Shield is over the fireplace. Inspect each of the items to pick up a new quest. Players can ask Tarem to reapply the buff if necessary.

;Objective
Speak to Inspector Tarem at the Shady Rest Inn.

;Description
If you follow the road south from the village, and then west toward the Barrens, you'll come across the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn.

Theramore has sent an investigator to discover how the inn met its fate. Normally, I'd advise you to steer clear, but we have orders from Orgrimmar to 'assist' in the investigation.

Accept any help the Theramore investigator offers, even feed him a tidbit or two of information if you'd like, but save your real findings for me.

;Completion
<The inspector regards you with what can only be distrust.>

I've been told that you're to... aid in this investigation. Very well, then.

I've been using this powder to search the ruins for clues that might help identify the attackers. It will illuminate anything that might have been involved in the attack. Don't hesitate to examine anything that looks suspicious.

==Progression==
This is part of [[The Shady Rest Inn quest chain]].
