==Objectives==
Return to [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] in [[Theramore]].

==Description==
We must make plans to destroy the remnants of the [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]]. Please convey my thanks to Lady Jaina, back in Theramore. She has ever been a loyal friend and steadfast ally.

Go to the [[Mage Quarter]] at the western end of the city and speak with [[Archmage Malin]] at the foot of the tower there. He will speed your return to Theramore.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*4600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have no doubt that the king meant every word when he told you he plans to destroy the Defias once and for all. He does not make promises lightly, and the enemies of Stormwind should know it.

==Notes==
[[File:Return to Jaina teleport from Archmage Malin.jpg|thumb|Alliance players who do not complete this quest will continue to find the Archmage Malin teleport useful!]]
Speak to [[Archmage Malin]] in the [[Mage Quarter]] to get a free teleport back to Jaina!

:Pleased to meet you, <race>.

:You are teleported back to Lady Jaina's presence in Theramore.

That is excellent news, <name>! I was worried the highlord might question the veracity of our information, but I see now my concern was misplaced.

You are to be well rewarded for your efforts on behalf of Theramore and the Alliance.
