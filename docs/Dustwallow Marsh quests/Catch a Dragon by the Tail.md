==Objectives==
Collect 8 Wyrmtail stalks in the [[Dragonmurk]] or [[Wyrmbog]].
* [[Wyrmtail]] (8)

==Description==
With the zeppelin crash delaying supplies, we've run out of medicines and bandages.

We're making use of what we can, but between all the insects, the injuries, and the enemies we're encountering here, I can barely keep up! I've found one herb that seems to help heal wounds and dull pain, but it, too, is in short supply.

It's called wyrmtail, and it's abundant in the Dragonmurk and Wyrmbog areas east of town. The plants themselves are made of coiled stalks, and seem to pulsate when you look at them.

==Progress==
Did you find any of the wyrmtail?

==Completion==
Thank you! This will help keep our guys going out in the field until [[Moxie Steelgrille|Moxie]] returns with the rest of the supplies from the zeppelin crash.

==Rewards==
