==Objectives==
Return to [[Krog]] at [[Brackenwall Village]].

==Description==
I doubt the [[Grimtotem]]s will give up their campaign to drive [[human]]s from the marsh, though I get the impression you probably don't mind that. At least we have dealt with the perpetrators of the crimes at the [[Shady Rest Inn]].

Go tell your leader that his vengeance has been sated.

==Completion==
<Krog listens to your report.>

I'm impressed, <name>. I would've thought that the Grimtotem criminals would've been more difficult to locate. The Alliance are truly incompetent.

In truth, I just sought to answer the death of one of my men, but this situation has been more fortunate than expected. If the Grimtotem choose to retaliate, it will likely be against the Alliance. Perhaps we will soon have the manpower to drive the scum from these shores once and for all.

==Rewards==
