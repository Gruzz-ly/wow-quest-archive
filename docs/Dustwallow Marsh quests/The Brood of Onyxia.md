==Objectives==
Speak with [[Overlord Mok'Morokk]] in [[Brackenwall Village]].

==Description==
[[Stonemaul Village]] was invaded by the brood of [[Onyxia]]. But why would the daughter of the black dragonlord, [[Deathwing]], descend upon our lands?

This is most troubling. Surely, Onyxia was driven here for a purpose beyond laying siege to a small band of ogres.

Notify Mok'Morokk at once! Action must be taken.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,050  [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|70}} at max level)

==Completion==
Why you tell me 'bout dragons? Me no like dragons. Me like it here. No dragons here.

==Progression==
* [[Identifying the Brood]]
** [[The Brood of Onyxia]]
*** [[The Brood of Onyxia (2)]]
**** [[The Brood of Onyxia (3)]]
