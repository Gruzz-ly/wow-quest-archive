== Objectives ==
You have been asked to recover four Dusty Prison Journals from the [[Cursed Depths]], just east of [[Baradin Hold]].
* [[Dusty Prison Journal]] (4)

== Description ==
Now that we finally have a hold on this wretched island, we can start to investigate how it got in this condition. Some of our troops have discovered journals around the entrance to Cursed Depths cellblock just east of here.

These journals are of particular interest to our elder scribes back at base camp. I need you to recover four of them and bring them back to me as fast as you can.

<name>, be careful down there, that place is crawling with undead.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|18|80|tbc=1}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to recover the journals? Reports mentioned that they were sighted both in and out of the cells down there.

== Completion ==
These journals are in excellent condition <name>. We will begin deciphering them immediately. Only time will tell what secrets they hold.

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].

== Patch changes ==
