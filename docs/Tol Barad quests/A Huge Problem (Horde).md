== Objectives ==
You have been asked to kill Problim, a giant [[ettin]] that roams the paths of [[Tol Barad]].
* [[Problim]] slain
* Suggested players [3]

== Description ==
We finally capture this godforsaken rock and then we find out that there is a huge ettin roaming around, taking out our sentry patrols!

<name>, I need you to round up a few friends and take that ettin down. We can't have a beast like that roaming around, wreaking havoc.

Stay alert, reports from the front say that he is carrying a huge tree as a weapon, and he is not afraid to use it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40|tbc=1}}

== Completion ==
You actually killed him?! I can't believe it!

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
