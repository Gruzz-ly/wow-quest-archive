# Tol Barad quests

'''Tol Barad quests''' take place in two sets of quest hubs, one on the northern [[Tol Barad Peninsula]] that always available, regardless of which faction controls [[Baradin Hold]], and another on the southern, main [[Tol Barad]] island at Baradin Keep, which is available to the faction that controls it.

Completing every single daily quest awards the achievement [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]], while completing 100 dailies awards the achievement [[Breaking Out of Tol Barad]].

The second quest hub is in [[Tol Barad]] in the PvP area of Tol Barad located at {{co|51.2|49.3|Tol Barad}}. These quests are available to the winning side as soon as the battle is over, but 15 minutes before the next battle begins, the quest-giver NPCs and all quest mobs will disappear, and whichever of the three quest areas had been unlocked will be closed again, preventing completion of any further objectives. There will be a five-minute warning to players in the zone before this occurs. However, any ''completed'' quests may still be turned in at the faction base camps on Tol Barad Peninsula at any time.

These three quests are always available:
*[[Sergeant Parker]] / [[Commander Zanoth]]
** [[A Huge Problem]]
** [[Swamp Bait]]
** [[The Leftovers]]

Then, ''one'' of these three sets are available at a time, based on which quest area is unlocked for this possession of the island:
*[[Cursed Depths]]: [[Commander Stevens]] / [[Private Garnoth]]
**[[Clearing the Depths]]
**[[Learning From The Past]]
**[[The Imprisoned Archmage]]
*[[D-Block]]: [[2nd Lieutenant Wansworth]] / [[Drillmaster Razgoth]]
**[[Cursed Shackles (quest)]]
**[[D-Block (quest)]]
**[[Svarnos (quest)]]
*[[The Hole]]: [[Marshal Fallows]] / [[Staff Sergeant Lazgar]]
**[[Food From Below]]
**[[Prison Revolt]]
**[[The Warden (quest)]]
These sets are ''not'' exclusive with each other on a given ''day'', and because the unlocked area rotates after every ''battle'', it is possible for an attentive player to complete all 12 quests in a day by returning after each battle - assuming their faction continues winning, and the random sequence of areas unlocked works out in their favor.
