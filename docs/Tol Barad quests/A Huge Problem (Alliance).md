This is a [[Tol Barad quests|Tol Barad]] daily quest.  It can only be taken and completed while your faction has control of [[Tol Barad]].  Once completed, it can be turned in at [[Baradin Hold]] on Tol Barad, or at the [[Baradin's Wardens]] post on [[Tol Barad Peninsula]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Problim.jpg|Problim|Good luck on this one.}}
You have been asked to kill Problim, a giant [[ettin]] that roams the paths of Tol Barad.
* [[Problim]] slain
* Suggested players: 3 

==Description==
We finally capture this godforsaken rock and then we find out that there is a huge [[ettin]] roaming around, taking out our sentry patrols!

<Name>, I need you to round up a few friends and take that ettin down.  We can't have a beast like that roaming around, wreaking havoc.

Stay alert, reports from the front say that he is carrying a huge tree as a weapon, and he is not afraid to use it.

==Progress==
Did you find [[Problim]] yet?  Pretty hard to miss that guy with how huge he is.

==Completion==
You actually killed him?!  I can't believe it! 

==Gains==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}, 1x [[Tol Barad Commendation]], 250 reputation with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
