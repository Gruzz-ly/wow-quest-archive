This is a [[Tol Barad quests|Tol Barad]] daily quest.  It can only be taken and completed while your faction has control of [[Tol Barad]].  Once completed, it can be turned in at [[Baradin Hold]] on Tol Barad, or at the [[Baradin's Wardens]] post on [[Tol Barad Peninsula]].

==Objectives==
You have been asked to kill 9 ghosts of any type in the [[Cursed Depths]], just east of Baradin Hold.
*Ghosts Slain (9)

==Description==
You are a sight for sore eyes, <name>.  Now that we have claimed Tol Barad, the battle has just begun.

We discovered a cell block just east of here that we need you to clear out.  Turns out that its chock full of [[ghost]]s that have been locked up down there for who knows how long.

Clear out as much as you can and report back to me when you are done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|80}}
*1x [[Tol Barad Commendation]],
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

==Progress==
Did you take care of the ghosts down there yet?  We have plenty of [[horde]] scum to fill that place up with once it's cleared out.

==Completion==
You made it back out alive?  You are a stronger man than I, <name>.

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].

==Notes==
Kill [[Captive Spirit]]s, [[Cellblock Ooze]]s and [[Ghastly Convict]]s.
