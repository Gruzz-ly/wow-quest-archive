This is a [[Tol Barad quests|Tol Barad]] daily quest.  It can only be taken and completed while your faction has control of Tol Barad.  Once completed, it can be turned in at [[Baradin Hold]] on Tol Barad, or at the [[Baradin's Wardens]] post on [[Tol Barad Peninsula]].

==Objectives==
You have been tasked with collecting 8 Crocolisk Hides from the [[Baradin Crocolisk]]s on Tol Barad. The crocolisks can be found in the swamp, just west of Baradin Hold.
*[[Crocolisk Hide]] (8)

==Description==
Supplies are never easy to find in a place like this, <class>. We have been scouting since we captured the island but things are not looking good.

Fortunately, we just received a scouting report that a swamp full of crocs is just west of our base camp here. The hides off those crocs will come in handy for our leatherworkers. Bring back as many as you can. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|40}}
*1x [[Tol Barad Commendation]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

==Progress==
You cleared out that swamp yet?

==Completion==
Looks like you were able to get the croc hides that we needed.  Thanks <name>, your contributions will not go unnoticed. 

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
