== Objectives ==
You must kill [[Svarnos]] in the [[D-Block]] and return with his Cursed Collar. Svarnos can be found in the D-Block, just northwest of [[Baradin Hold]].
* [[Svarnos' Cursed Collar]]

== Description ==
Excellent work on the island capture, <class>. Now that we have claimed the island, we need to make these cellblocks useable for prisoners. D-Block has been especially hard to clear out. Unfortunately it has become overrun with demons of all sorts.

We have been able to thin out the demons but a large [[core hound]] has broken its way out of its cell and is wreaking havoc down there. I need you to kill him and bring back his collar.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|18|80|tbc=1}}

== Progress ==
Is the core hound dead?

== Completion ==
Svarnos is finally dead? Looks like we can finally get to work setting up that cellblock then. Thank you <name>.

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].

== Patch changes ==
