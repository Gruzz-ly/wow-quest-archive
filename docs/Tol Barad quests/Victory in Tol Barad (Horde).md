== Description ==
Maintaining control of Tol Barad is the key to our strategic plans here in the Eastern Kingdoms, <race>. We must do whatever it takes to keep the Alliance off this island and that means we need your help. Fight with everything you have to win control of Tol Barad and bring me word of victory.

You bring word of victory, just as I expected!  Any triumph in Tol Barad is in turn a triumph for the Horde.  Have no doubt, your efforts here will be rewarded.
