* Demons Slain (10)

==Description==
Have you heard of the D-Block yet <name>?  It's one of the old cellblocks here on the island.  Problem is, it's infested with demons.  We planned on using it to lock up the leftover [[horde]] we found on the island, but that is not going to happen in it's{{sic}} current state.

I need you to head down there and clear those demons out.  Report back to me when you are done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|80|tbc=1}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

==Progress==
Are the demons gone yet?  We are waiting on you, <name>.  Let me know when you are done.

==Completion==
D-Block is all clear?  Good work, <name>.  We will send down a crew to start cleaning up right away.

Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
