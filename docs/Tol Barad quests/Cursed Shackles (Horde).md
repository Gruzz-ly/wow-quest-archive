== Objectives ==
You have been asked to recover 8 Cursed Shackles from the [[D-Block]], just northwest of [[Baradin Hold]].
* [[Cursed Shackles]] (8)

== Description ==
Have you been down in the D-Block yet, <name>? Every time we clear that infested cellblock out, the demons seem to return rather quickly. We learned that they regenerate from the cursed shackles scattered around the area. That's where you come in to the picture <name>.

I need you to retrieve as many of those shackles as you can and bring them back to me. We will destroy them immediately.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|18|80|tbc=1}}

== Progress ==
Did you find many shackles? Reports mentioned that they were all over the place down there.

== Completion ==
The shackles! We will begin the process of destroying these shackles immediately <name>. Thank you for your help.

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
