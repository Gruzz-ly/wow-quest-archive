This is a [[Tol Barad quests|Tol Barad]] daily quest.  It can only be taken and completed while your faction has control of Tol Barad.  Once completed, it can be turned in at [[Baradin Hold]] on Tol Barad, or at the [[Baradin's Wardens]] post on [[Tol Barad Peninsula]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Warden Silva.jpg|Warden Silva|Time to give the warden an early parole.}}
You must kill [[Warden Silva]] in [[The Hole]] and return with his keys.  The Hole is just southwest of Baradin Hold.
*[[Warden's Keys]]

==Description==
We have almost finished clearing out the revolting prisoners in The Hole, but one last problem remains.  The warden.

Warden Silva is their master and they will do anything for him.  If we take him out, we take them all out.  Finish him off and bring me back his keys.  We can use those keys to explore deeper into the cellblock and possibly gain access to the water supply here on the island. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|80|tbc=1}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

==Progress==
Is the warden dead yet?

==Completion==
Ahh, the wardens key's.  Another job well done, <name>.  These will come in very handy. 

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
