This is a [[Tol Barad quests|Tol Barad]] daily quest.  It can only be taken and completed while your faction has control of [[Tol Barad]].  Once completed, it can be turned in at [[Baradin Hold]] on Tol Barad, or at the [[Baradin's Wardens]] post on [[Tol Barad Peninsula]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Svarnos.jpg|Svarnos|Green never was my favorite color.}}
You must kill [[Svarnos]] in the [[D-Block]] and return with his Cursed Collar.  Svarnos can be found in the D-Block, just northwest of Baradin Hold.
* [[Svarnos' Cursed Collar]]

==Description==
Excellent work on the island capture, <class>.  Now that we have claimed the island, we need to make these cellblocks useable for prisoners.  D-Block has been especially hard to clear out.  Unfortunately it has become overrun with [[demon]]s of all sorts.

We have been able to thin out the demons but a large [[core hound]] has broken its way out of its cell and is wreaking havoc down there.  I need you to kill him and bring back his collar. 

==Progress==
Is the core hound dead?

==Completion==
Svarnos is finally dead?  Looks like we can finally get to work setting up that cellblock then.  Thank you <name>. 

==Gains==
You will receive: {{cost|18|80|tbc=1}}, 350 reputation with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
