== Objectives ==
You have been instructed to kill 10 demons of any type in the [[D-Block]], just northwest of [[Baradin Hold]].
* Demons Slain (10)

== Description ==
Have you heard of the D-Block yet <name>? It's one of the old cellblocks here on the island. Problem is, it's infested with demons. We planned on using it to lock up the leftover alliance we found on the island, but that is not going to happen in it's current state.

I need you to head down there and clear those demons out. Report back to me when you are done.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40|tbc=1}}

== Completion ==
D-Block is all clear? Good work, <name>. We will send down a crew to start cleaning up right away.

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
