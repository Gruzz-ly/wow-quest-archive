You must kill [[Archmage Galus]] and return with his Staff from the [[Cursed Depths]], just east of Baradin Hold.
*[[Archmage Galus' Staff]]

==Description==
We have been trying to clear out the Cursed Depths cellblock since we landed on Tol Barad.  It seems that everytime we get close, that [[archmage]] shows up and pushes us back.

Now that we have claimed the island, it's time we take another shot.  Head down there and bring me back his staff as proof that you have finished the job.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|80}}
*1x [[Tol Barad Commendation]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

==Progress==
Have you been able to take out the Archmage?

==Completion==
Galus is dead?  Fantastic work <name>, now we can send down the cleanup crew and get that cellblock ready for new prisoners.

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
