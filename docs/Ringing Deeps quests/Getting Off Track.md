[[File:Getting Off Track.jpg|thumb|A Derailed Transport Cart, and some Buried Legs?]]

==Objectives==
Investigate the derailed mine cart in [[Ironhaul Station]].
*Investigate the area around the overturned mine cart
*Inform Uzjax about the escaped skardyn

==Description==
[[Speaker Brinthe]] acknowledged. Outlanders, there is work to do.

One of our larger mine carts has derailed. It's blocking the station's main junction.

My workers' productivity is impaired, and their functioning is suboptimal. The [[titan]]s put us here to work, but my workers aren't all working. Could you go and get us back on track?

Be careful. I can see you're made of flesh and bone. I don't want you to be crushed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
As long as we stay loyal, hit our deadlines, and meet our quotas, everything will be fine.

The gears keep grinding, and we keep working.

Praise the Machine.

==Completion==
Report requested. Did you find anything?

It's a what? A "[[skardyn|skar-dyn]]"?

This information is irrelevant to my assignment. Focusing on work.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Underground and Overwhelmed]] before heading out.

At the marked spot in the quest area to the southeast are some [[Buried Legs]] in a pile of coal next to the Derailed Transport Cart. Free the rest of the body attached to the Buried Legs to reveal a hostile [[Feral Skardyn]]!
:{{text|say|Feral Skardyn|... bleedssss...}}

Finish it off, then get back to filling the Underground and Overwhelmed bar.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|A skardyn? Here? Does the High Speaker know?}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Uzjax|That is not your concern. We do as he commands.}}
