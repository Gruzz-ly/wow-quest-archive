==Objectives==
Fly near the leaks in steam pipes above [[Gundargaz]] to seal them with [[kobold]]-provided glue.
* Leaking pipes patched (12)

==Description==
Earthquake do number on old pipes. Many start leaking steam everywhere. Especially ones too tall to reach.

<[[Fourman Grimes]] points up to the pipes stretching from Gundargaz to the surface.>

[[Earthen|Stoneheads]] not have "approved replacements," but we not have time wait.

Take glue and seal leaks with flappy-flying thing. Made of only best bugs, boiled myself. Will do for today.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Try not glue self to pipe, yes?

==Completion==
See? Not need wait. Need action.

You understand.

==Notes==
Fly around the pipes above Gundargaz and strafe the leaks. No need to do anything special, just get close.

==Progression==
