==Objectives==
Collect 8 caustic blooms and find the missing bucket.
* [[Caustic Bloom]] (8)
*Find the [[Missing Bucket|missing bucket]]

==Description==
Down among the creeping [[lashroom]]s, grows an orange flower. When mixed with water, its blooms make a caustic solvent that is perfect for removing moss from [[earthen]] skin.

I also left a bucket next to this earthen the last time I was here, which I use {{sic}} make the solvent. Something seems to have made off with it.

Could I delegate the task of gathering these to you? I'll wait here. The moles from [[Brunwin's Terrace|the terrace]] have given me enough excitement for one day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The acidity from the plants is strong enough to remove the moss but gentle enough not to harm the earthen. Plus it has a pleasing smell to it. Almost like sulfur.

==Completion==
Ah, I can smell the sulfur from here! Thank you for gathering the bucket and blooms.

Not everyone shares my taste, but I enjoy a bowl of lightly seared magma in an igneous bowl, especially when the fumes are particularly sulfurous.

What? You've never tried it? To each their own.

[[Bytta]], the bucket nabber, is located at the west end of the quest area, wearing a bucket and guarding a cache of many more. [[Caustic Bloom]]s are growing all over, including near [[King Splash]], a rare [[mudskip]].
