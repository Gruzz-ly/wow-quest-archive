==Objectives==
Find a way to stoke the forge outside of [[Gundargaz]].
*Stoke the Forge with [[Fire Breath]]

==Description==
Harumph! This blasted forge is on its last legs. We'd repair it, but [[Stonemason Itsak]] was picking up a shift at [[Ironhaul Station]] when the [[Coreway]] collapsed, and well...

There's no one to fix it anymore.

If you can figure out a way of getting it running hot again, Gundargaz would be in your debt!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*5,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm going to miss Itsak. He made the best end-of-shift rock roasts...

==Completion==
Whoa! I've never seen anything like that! You just... keep fire in your throat?

Now that's a trick I'd been keen on learning!
