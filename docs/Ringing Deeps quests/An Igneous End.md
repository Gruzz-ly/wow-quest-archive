==Objectives==
Free [[Entombed Earthen]] from their stone shells near [[Hallowfall Gate]].
* [[Earthen]] freed (6)

==Description==
When the magma transport pipe failed, our workers rushed down to begin repairs.

The [[elemental]]s caught us unawares, rising up and attacking with great gouts of lava.

Fortunately, we earthen are made of stern stuff and a little magma is hardly going to be the end of us. Unfortunately, the cooling magma has hardened into stone shells, entombing our repair crews where they stood.

Smash their stony prisons and free my workers!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't worry about hurting them, just get them free.

==Completion==
Thank you, topsider. With our crews returned, we can get back to work.
