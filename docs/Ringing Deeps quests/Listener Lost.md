'''Listener Lost''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]]. [[Haimaz]] at [[Shadowvein Point]] will offer this quest with no prerequisites.

==Objectives==
Find Brennok
*Find [[Brennok]]

==Description==
Blast it all!

Brennok and I were on our way to [[Shadowvein Point]] to conduct a recitation ceremony. We were attacked by [[scorpid]]s. Now the hauler has a scorpid stinger lodged in its gears, and Brennok wandered off.

He said he was going to stretch his legs while I fixed the hauler, but that was a while ago. I need to get the bot moving again, can you look for him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You don't understand, I was going to leave the [[Ringing Deeps]]. But I can't now, not without my book!

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|Blasted bot! Brennok should have been back by now.}}

Northeast to the [[Shadowvein Extraction Site]], where Brennok is looking at a looted chest:
:{{text|say|Brennok|No, my book! What have they done?}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|Years of work, carried off by animals...}}

Brennok has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Did Haimaz send you? This is important. I can't go back yet.

{{gossip|Why do you want to leave?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
So many come to me to entrust stories or ask questions. I try to answer well, but I don't really know.

I could describe the sun a hundred ways, but to me it's less real than a candle's flame.

My stories matter, I know that. I keep memories alive that would otherwise pass into nothing.

But they're all as much as shadows trickling down the cenotes. I want to see the real thing. I want to bring back new stories, not just retell old ones. I want my oath to grow, not stagnate.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
