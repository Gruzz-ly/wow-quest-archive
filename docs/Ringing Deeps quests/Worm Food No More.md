==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Maddened Eyestalk.jpg|Maddened Eyestalk|Big, nasty, wriggling slab of teeth and slime. It has a taste for goblin, and a maw wide enough to swallow a shredder.}}
Kill the Maddened Eyestalk in the [[Writhing Fields]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]].
*[[Maddened Eyestalk]] slain {{co|71.4|95.2|Ringing Deeps}}

==Description==
We've got the bots workin' the fields, but there are still flesh-an'-blood workers out there.

They need to be able to get back here safely, an' they can't do that with a giant, slobberin' "worm" doggin' their steps 'cause it's got a taste for goblin meat.

So, here's the job: I don't want that thing scared off, I want it gone. Go out there, track down that overgrown "earthworm", and make sure it dies.

Don't hold back--I want guts everywhere. Payback for all the goblins it's had for lunch.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Bug Exterminator's Gloves]]
* [[Bug Exterminator's Pants]]
* [[Bug Exterminator's Belt]]
* [[Bug Exterminator's Shoulderguards]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You flattened that thing yet?

==Completion==
Whoa, I see you took my words to heart!

Remember to hit the shower after you're done here, okay?

==Progression==
