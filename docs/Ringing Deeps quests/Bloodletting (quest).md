==Objectives==
Kill [[Black Blood]] creatures and signal Orweyna to attack weak points in the pipeline.
*[[Forming Pusglob]] slain (6)
*[[Giant Gorewalker]] slain (2)
*Target attack on Pipeline Valve (4)
*Find [[Orweyna]] in the [[Verdant Grotto]]

==Description==
The land aches underfoot. These pipes carry Black Blood north in a massive volume!

I've never seen the land become infected this rapidly. Clear away the rot--perhaps we can save it yet.

I'll go after the structures. Point out weak spots as you find them and I will focus our assault!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]
* [[Ring of Purification]]
* [[Circle of Cleansing]]

==Progress==
The horrors these goblins have brought forth are truly a blight on this land.

==Completion==
I mistrust any of the goblins responsible for this pipeline.

Be cautious, <name>.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Follow me. We will stop this atrocity.}}
:''Orweyna runs into some enemies and kills them.''

Bofore Orweyna runs off, she has gossip:
{{dialogue|My visions show a bleak future, when it comes to this blood.}}

:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Nature rejects you!}}
:''Orweyna shifts into her bat form and flies off.''

In the quest area, players gain an extra action button:
: {{Abilities|Orweyna's Fury|Request Orweyna's assistance to assault the area.|icon=ability_creature_poison_04|id=469649}}

Use Orweyna's Fury (a ground-targeted AoE) on valves and she swoops in with a bark:
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|There are more!}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|It begins to falter!}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Foul thing!}}

Finish the objectives:
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Wait. Someone's coming.}}
:''[[Pamsy]] runs in.''
:{{Text|Yell|Pamsy|Don't touch that! What are you doing?}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The Black Blood, you have no idea--}}
:{{Text|Say|Pamsy|I know it's bad, but you're making things worse!}}

Pamsy has gossip:
{{dialogue|Tell your bat-eared friend to calm down.

Harming the pipes will just make more of the Black Blood get everywhere!}}

==Progression==
{{Trust Issues}}
