==Notes==
Once more into the breach with Granny Scribbles:

{{Dialogue|You ready hear story, tenderfoot?

{{gossip|quest=|Tell me about the wickless candle, Granny Scribbles.}}}}

This time players are at the [[Chittering Den]], looking at some [[Grabby Rock]]s, reminiscent of [[Dragonscale Expedition]] climbing world quests...
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|In beginning, kobolds not know about "surface". Cave, tunnel, mine all was.}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|One day, tenderfoot hear story no one believe. Of giant cave with ceiling so high can't even see.}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|But she believe. She decide see herself.}}

Start climbing, but steer clear of the [[Flappy Rockwing]]s and [[Pillar Scuttler]]s:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|She decide climb tallest rock in all cave. Higher than any climb before.}}

Some distance up:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Up, up, up she go! Higher than any kobold before.}}

Further up:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|At tippest top, when reach ceiling itself and no more up to go, she see crack just big enough to squeeze into.}}

Hop in the [[Squeezy Hole]] to pop out at the back of a cave in the [[Three Shields]]. Exit the cave:

:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Squeeze through crack and tunnel, up crumbly rock and slippery stone to new cave.}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|But this one smell funny. Air move on own. Cold, salty.}}

Upon exiting the cave:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Biggest cave any kobold ever see! So big, can't see walls, can't see ceiling. And in not-ceiling a candle so bright it blind you if look at!}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Magic flying candle not need wax to burn, but too high to grab, no matter how much she jump.}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Other kobolds never believe story, so she need bring back proof!}}

Collect a [[Prooftelling Flower]]:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|So she pick strange flower never seen before. Bring back home. Show surface and wickless candle real!}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|And that how kobold discover surface. Too bright, too big for tenderfoots, but maybe new friends tell you stories some day.}}

Completing this quest awards the "Kobold Story Time" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
