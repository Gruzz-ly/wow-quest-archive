==Objectives==
"Remove" 15 Hardhead moles.
*Moles dealt with (15)

==Description==
All that's between us and the juiciest excavation site I've ever seen is a couple of moles and a leggy deer. Sorry, getting ahead of myself.

See these [[shredder]]s? State of the art in the field of maiming and killing. And they keep getting stuck in holes!

Listen, I'm as ecologically conscientious as the next [[goblin]], but these moles have got to go. I'm gonna need you to give these hardheads a hard time. And if you see any of my crew, help 'em out, wontcha?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You deal with 'em yet? I'm not hauling another shredder out of the mud.

==Completion==
You sure sent 'em scurrying! There's only one teensy thing left between us and all those beautiful resources.

==Notes==
Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Prospera Cogwail|We can't afford to keep draggin' shredders out of the mud!}}

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Prospera Cogwail|Watch your step, I ain't comin' to haul you out.}}

Slay [[Invasive Hardhead]]s and/or help [[Panicked Shredder Pilot]]s which are being attacked by baby moles. When helped the workers say:
*{{text|say|Panicked Shredder Pilot|I only had two payments left on this haircut!}}
*{{text|say|Panicked Shredder Pilot|Prospera's gonna dock my pay for this.}}
*{{text|say|Panicked Shredder Pilot|Tell Prospera she can take this gig and shove it!}}
*{{text|say|Panicked Shredder Pilot|This better be covered by hazard pay.}}

The moles can be mounted:
