==Objectives==
Kill enemies in the [[Writhing Fields]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]].
* Enemies killed in the Writhing Fields (0/100%)

==Description==
Even if we got bots out there an' not workers, there are still gonna be monsters out there gettin' in their hair, er, wirin'. 

Get out there an' thin out the wildlife. That'll keep our bots from gettin' damaged and voidin' whatever warranty they got left. 

The longer they can stay out there, the longer we can stay right here!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*+200 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Progress==
Got any good news, kid?

==Completion==
That's what I'm talkin' about!

Now those bots'll be able to work without bein' hassled by all them nasty [[Black Blood]] monsters out there.

==Notes==
Fill the bar by killing:
* [[Engorged Bloodtick]] (3%)
* [[Bloated Abscess]] (5%)
* [[Maddened Eyestalk]] (10%)
* [[Guttergorger]] and [[Enveloping Bloodeater]] (20%)
