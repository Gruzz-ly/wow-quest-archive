Smell like dirt...and wax! You find something good? Something hidden?

Lots to find if keep nose open.

Kobolds always happy to take wax off hands. Love wax! Almost as much as you love shinies.

Middles working on new project. Wax sculpture! He take any wax you find. Give enough and he trade you shiny rock as proof you help.

Bring back to me! Have all kinds of stuff we find to give for helping. Some even good!

Try out! I give you some old wax to give Middles for shiny pebble.
