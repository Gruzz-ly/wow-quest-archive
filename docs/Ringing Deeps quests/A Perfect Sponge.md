==Objectives==
Collect one perfect [[lashroom]] cap.
*Collect a [[Perfect Lashroom Cap|perfect lashroom cap]]

==Description==
Welcome, stalwart colleague, to [[Shimmermist Falls]]! It's always damp here - a thriving paradise for green, living things. Unfortunately, it's also the perfect climate for moss to grow on my inert [[earthen]] charges. 

We'll need to gather a few supplies for removing the moss. First, we need a sponge to wash their surfaces. It needs to be soft enough to not damage them but strong enough to hold up to an earthen's rough stone skin.

The caps from [[Creeping Lashroom|the lashrooms]] down below are perfect!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|17|55}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These lashroom caps make for perfect sponges!

==Completion==
Task complete! This one is perfect! And your performance is optimal, of course.

==Notes==

Since [[Batzvara]] is looking for a perfect lashroom cap, it will take many [[Creeping Lashroom]] kills to come up with one.
