==Objectives==
Collect 6 Galvanic Glands.
* [[Galvanic Gland]] (6)

==Description==
I am seeking my mentor, [[Foreman Arbauch]]. He is... missing. Under other circumstances, I would send for a search party from [[Gundargaz]], but there is no time.

I suspect he passed through here, but the only lead I have is [[Clive DelGizmo|DelGizmo]]. He wants the local [[fog beast]]s removed. Reluctance. But if he has seen Arbauch, I must learn what he knows.

The lurkers to the south carry powerful Galvanic Glands. They have enough charge to disperse even the thickest fog. Retrieve some. Compensation assured.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Haste is appreciated. I must find Arbauch.

==Completion==
Approval. These seem quite energetic. They will allow you to scare off the fog beasts for DelGizmo.

==Notes==
Upon approaching [[Danagh]] at DelGizmo's in [[Camp Murroch]]:
:{{text|say|Danagh|If you have seen him, it is your duty to tell me.}}
:{{text|say|Clive DelGizmo|What's it worth to you?}}
:{{text|say|Danagh|I do not have time to bargain, outlander.}}

Danagh has gossip:
{{dialogue|
Another outlander? Hopeful. You may be more useful than this... proprietor.

{{gossip|Where do fog beasts come from?}}

{{dialogue-child|
Unknown. Most believe they are creations or byproducts of Titanic work. My mentor had theories, though he was prone to fringe thinking.

He believed fog beasts only appeared once we could no longer erase our memories. He thought that, when memories overflow, they must go somewhere. Like attracts like, so they coalesce and manifest as physical mnemozoa. Memory creatures. Fog beasts.

He always was superstitious.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

Danagh's gossip changes upon accepting the quest:
{{dialogue|We are stretched thin. Machines this far from the Stonevault do not get the attention they are owed.

;Objective
Collect 6 Electric Cores
* Electric Core (6)

;Description
Another outlander? Hopeful. You may be more useful than this proprietor.

I'm looking for [[Machine Speaker Arbauch]]. He was sent to... perform maintenance. [[Clive DelGizmo|DelGando]] has seen him, but won't say more without a favor.

He wants the local [[fog beast]]s removed. Reluctance. But I must find Arbauch.

Bring me Energetic Electric Cores. Compensation assured.
