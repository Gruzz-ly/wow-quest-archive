==Objectives==
Experience [[Orweyna]]'s scouting mission.
*Speak to Orweyna
* "Listen in" to Gather Intel (4)
* Listen in at the Cave Wall
* Reach the Foreman's Office.
* Find information

==Description==
When I scouted, I head and saw things that I don't understand.

Perhaps if I describe it to you and the goblins, you will know what it means.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15 [[Valorstones]]
* 5 [[Carved Harbinger Crest]]/[[Weathered Undermine Crest]]

==Completion==
After I escaped from that place, I saw you battling the gigantic machine, and I had to join in the fight.

Now it seems there really is no going back. I am alone here, except for you, and these goblins

==Notes==
[[File:Bat Versus World - Orweyna and Gallywix.jpg|thumb|Orweyna spies on Gallywix's hologramic message.]]
Speak with Orweyna again:
{{Dialogue|I know we are close to answers. I cannot stop now.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to see and hear what you did.}}}}

This starts a scenario. The player controls Orweyna in her Bat form, and has access to the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Listen in||Listen in for intel.|icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Flap||Movement speed increased by 30 for 3 sec. Cancels Sneak|icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Sneak||Hide from detection for a short time.|icon=ability_stealth}}

Be careful not to get spotted by lasers, Point Sharpshooters, or Anti-Aerial Assemblies.

Head to the rooftop, go to the goblins on the rooftop, and Listen In while in the glowing orb.
:{{Text|Say|[[Chatty Goblin]]|I just realized I'm afraid of heights.}}

Head to the bridge where another goblin is there and Listen In.
:{{Text|Say|Chatty Goblin|Hardly workin', definitely.}}

Head to the Structure where the goblin are partying and Listen In.
:{{Text|Say|Chatty Goblin|Oh man, I've got all my money tied up in this venture! Ugh, no! Not that Venture, are you crazy?}}

Go to the tower where the goblin is at the entrance and Listen In.
:{{Text|Say|Chatty Goblin|The real opportunity is on the other side of that wall.}}

At the cave wall:
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I saw little of use when observing the other goblins, but I heard things coming from the wall.}}

Go to the cave wall and Listen In:
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|It sounded like the earth ground itself to nothing. What manner of machine does this?}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Sounds like a rocket drill, a big one. But who's running it?}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Next I went searching for you, <name>. I found you outside the building.}}

Fly up into the Foreman's office:
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|While you fought the machine, I witnessed something inside.}}

Use the extra action button to Infiltrate and a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|jFgnPTwHLGo|Gallywix Revealed}}
:''Orweyna flies down to the ground and shifts into her haranir form and sneaks into the foreman's office. She spots a red button and presses it. A hologram appears.''
:{{Text|bossemote|???|Look, pal! The only opportunity here is the one I gave you.}}
:''The camera reveals the hologram to be [[Trade Prince Gallywix]]''
:{{Text|bossemote|Trade Prince Gallywix|Big things are coming, and if you want to be part of it, you better fall in line.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Trade Prince Gallywix|Jastor Gallywix is back in business!}}
:''Orweyna shifts into her bat form and flies away.''
:The player automatically exits the scenario and returns to [[Opportunity Point]].
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Gallywix! Without the Bilgewater Cartel, he shouldn't have the resources for an operation here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|You've been hiding under the Horde's skirts too long. Gallywix is back, making deals, and making trouble. Things have changed.}}
