==Objectives==
Acquire the proper-temperature mineral water from the [[Living Grotto]] springs.
* Collect water from first pool
* Collect water from second pool
* Collect water from third pool
*Meet Moira Thaurissan by Fearbreaker's crater in the Living Grotto.

==Description==
When [[Fearbreaker|that magic hammer]] fell into [[Ringing Deeps|the Deeps]], I knew it could be a formidable weapon against the [[skardyn]] menace. [[Moira Thaurissan|Your friend]] has told me that it's 'particular' about its wielder.

Fortunately, I am a hero!

And as a hero, I know how to get close to it. We need to have a good mix of pollen and water plastered onto us. That way, [[Verdant Hulk|the beast standing over it]] will think we're just like it.

That mineral water has to be the exact right temperature to mix with the [[lashroom]] dust and blend in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That was a right pain. But we got the water Berrund asked for.

It's time we get a move on. I don't want my father's hammer to just languish there in the mud. That doesn't sit right with me, not at all.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|If you want to set foot near that crater without the creature attacking, you'll need the perfect mixture of components.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|While I'm... happy... tae help, that will take some work. This sounds dangerous. Are ye sure it's absolutely necessary?}}
:{{Text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Yes! That hammer will be the perfect weapon against the skardyn. Once I... we have retrieved it, think of all the good we can do!}}
:''Moira runs off and Berrund walks down to water level.''

After accepting this quest, Berrund has new gossip:

{{Dialogue|
{{gossip|Do you want Fearbreaker for yourself?}}

I am a hero of great renown throughout the Ringing Deeps. I have trained and honed my shape to be the best.

The skardyn menace must be quelled. I will do this, and that hammer will be an excellent weapon to wield against them.

It should be in the hands of someone who will use it for good, don't you think?

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

[[File:Mineral Water Woes.jpg|thumb|[[Moira Thaurissan]] and a [[Collection Bowl]]]]
Find Moira by the first pool:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Those blasted lashrooms and their accursed spores. I feel like my eyes are never going tae stop itchin'.}}

Interact with the Collection Bowl next to her to take the first sample, which is too cold:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Hm. This water doesn't seem tae be the right temperature for ol' Berrund. We'll have to get more from deeper in.}}
:''Moira runs off.''

Moira has caught up with Berrund at the second pool, which is too hot:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Ye think that Fearbreaker would make a good weapon against the skardyn. Ye know there's only certain people it likes, aye?}}

Collect the second sample:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|No, no, no, this water is too warm. You'll want to find water that's just right.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|[[Eimear|My mother]] told me a story about three bears once. It didn't turn out well for the dwarf who stole from 'em.}}
:''They run off.''

At the third pool, it's just Moira again:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Berrund's scouting out the beast standing over Fearbreaker. Let's hope this is enough. I just want tae get that hammer back tae Magni.}}

Collect the water, which is just right:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|That'll have tae do. Let's get back down there and see what we're up against.}}
:''Moira mounts a gryphon and flies off.''

On return:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Look at that big beastie... And that hammer is so close...}}
