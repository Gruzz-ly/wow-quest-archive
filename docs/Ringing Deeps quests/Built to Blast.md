==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Haywire MEK IV.jpg|Haywire MEK IV|The fourth version of the Mechanical Everything Killer, this one has some serious bugs in the system.}}
Destroy the Haywire MEK IV.
* [[Haywire MEK IV]] slain
* Return to [[Orweyna]] at [[Opportunity Point]].

==Description==
We've got an intel problem, but we've also got a clank problem.

If you look over there, there's a big, haywire mech that's just going crazy. There's no way anyone's going to uncover anything while that's out in the field.

We should do something about that.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 15 [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
It would seem that we are all searching for information, but I have some that I think is useful.

And it's too late to hide now, they've seen my true form.

Let's see this through to the end.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|No one's going anywhere while that massive boom-bot is running amok. Take it out, and we'll talk. Deal?}}

Go to the area where the [[Haywire MEK IV]] is attacking [[Monte Gazlowe]].
:{{Text|Yell|Monte Gazlowe|A little help? Kind of bit off more than I can chew!}}
:''[[Orweyna]] appears.''
:{{Text|Yell|Orweyna|Die, foul machine!}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Uhhh, what? Who are you? What are you?}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|There is no going back now. Small green one, I propose an exchange of information.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|She's got the goods, Monte. She was flying around all over the place.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|The surprises never end. Meet you both back at Opportunity Point.}}
:''Renzik smoke bombs away and Orweyna turns into a bat and takes off.''

After slaying the mech, go to [[Opportunity Point]].
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Spill it, Renzik. What's an [[SI:7]] agent doin' down here?}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I'm off the clock Bilgewater. I am here lookin' out for goblin interests.}}
