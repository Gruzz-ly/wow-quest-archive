==Objectives==
Find [[Foreman Arbauch]].
*Substation investigated
*[[Arbauch's Ward|Ward]] removed

==Description==
There's a substation directly below us? Perhaps that is where Arbauch went to hide it... Disregard, we must investigate.

With luck, Arbauch may still be here. The entrance should be to the north, near the pool of water from the burst pipe. Please, come with me. He may need our help.

I will explain everything once he is located.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
* 5,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It killed him, and we let it loose. Even his memory gem is gone.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Danagh|Haste may be warranted.}}

Upon catching up with Danagh in a cave below [[Camp Murroch]]. You see that the cave gate is blocked by a magical ward:
:{{text|say|Danagh|Arbauch must have cast this ward from the inside...}}
:{{text|say|Danagh|Remove it. If he went in, so must we.}}

Upon removing the ward, a [[Corrupted Golem]] breaks through the gate and runs away:
:{{text|yell|Danagh|Something's wrong. Get back!}}
:{{text|yell|Corrupted Golem|Failure. Protect gem. Find new vessel.}}
:{{text|yell|Danagh|Nevermind the golem! Arbauch, are you alright?}}

Upon completion, a hologram of Arbauch appears from a [[Arbauch's Cogwalker|nearby bot]]:
:{{text|say|Foreman Arbauch|Danagh, I'm sorry I left. I thought I could... I don't know.}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Arbauch|It was confused--it hurt me. I feel very still. Titans forgive me.}}
