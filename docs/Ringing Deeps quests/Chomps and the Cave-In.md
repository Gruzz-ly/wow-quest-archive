Speak with [[Granny Scribbles]] again:

{{Dialogue|You ready hear story, tenderfoot?

{{gossip|quest=|Tell me about Chomps, Granny Scribbles.}}}}

Another loading screen, this time to the [[Fetid Grotto]], where [[Unsuspecting Kobold]]s are all over. Move to start the story:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Chomps young kobold. Headstrong.}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Told not dig too high, but not listen to elders. Think he know better.}}

Head southwest to the end of the cave and interact with the [[Rock Face]] to start digging too high:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Crash! Dig too greedy and too high. Bring whole cave down on poor kobolds. Trap many. Squish many.}}
:''[[Angry Pebbles]] run out.''

[[Angry Rocks]] start attacking [[Trapped Kobold]]s. Defeat the former and free the latter. At 50%:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Chomps try help friends. But more rocks fall.}}

Stay out of the swirlies while freeing the rest. At 100%, the player is stunned:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Until SQUISH goes Chomps! And all his friends.}}

Splat. On the other side of the loading screen:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|And that why not dig too greedy or too high, little ones. Or go squish like Chomps!}}
