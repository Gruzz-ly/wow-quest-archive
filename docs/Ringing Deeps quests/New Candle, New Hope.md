==Notes==
[[File:VZ-Darkflame Cleft.jpg|thumb|[[Darkflame Cleft]] instance map]]

Speak with Skitter again:
{{dialogue|Are you ready, <name>?

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to infiltrate Darkflame Cleft.}}}}

This starts a scenario set in the [[Darkflame Cleft]] dungeon.

===Kobold Disguise===
:Apply the disguise Skitter has made for you out of the scrap recovered from the Warrens
*Disguise yourself as a kobold

After entering:
:{{text|say|Skitter|I make disguise out of scrap you collect! So look like kobold and sneak past others.}}

At any point, should the need arise, Skitter can be talked to, in order to leave:
{{dialogue|Candle Crown will be in throne room.

{{gossip|I need to leave the Darkflame Cleft. Take me back to the Warrens.
{{Text|red|<This will exit the current scenario.>}}}}}}

Use the Disguise: Kobold extra action button.

===Snuff the Candles===
:Extinguish the [[Wavering Candle|large candles]] scattered about the chamber, plunging the area into darkness and driving off the massive kobold guarding the door.
*Candles snuffed (6)

:{{text|say|Skitter|No get too close to kobolds. Sneak in, take back crown!}}
When you snuff off a candle an unnatural darkness ({{Abilities|It's Getting Dark In Here|id=430819|Maximum Health reduced by 5%.|icon=spell_shadow_auraofdarkness|notes=Stacks up to 15 times, totalling at 75%}}) envelops the area:
*{{text|say|Skitter|Just dark. Dark can't hurt you if keep light inside.}}
*{{text|say|Skitter|Ah!}}
*{{text|say|Skitter|Eeep!}}

Enemies might say one of the following lines when extinguishing candles:
*{{text|say|Ah!}}
*{{text|say|Eee!}}
*{{text|say|Eeep!}}
*{{text|say|No eat me!}}
*{{text|say|Too dark!}}

When you try to approach the entrance to the [[Waxatory]] before snuffing out all the candles, [[Tiny (kobold)|Tiny]], who is standing guard, says: 
:{{text|say|Tiny|King say: no one come in when King is out. No one! Go!}}
When you snuff out all the candles:
:{{text|say|Tiny|I...I just remembered a thing I have to do. In another part of the mine!}}
:{{text|say|Skitter|Not too big to be scared of dark, was he?}}

===Kill Waximus===
:The way forward is blocked with waxy buildup. Defeat [[Waximus]] to dislodge it.
*Waximus slain.

The room is patrolled by [[Candleclaw Underboss]]es, [[Candleclaw Scrambler]]s, [[Candleclaw Pyromancer]]s and [[Waxy Globule]]s. Both entrances to the room are flanked by a pair of [[Oil Packed Brazier]]s. The braziers by the door onwards can also be lit in order to melt the blocking wax.
:{{text|say|Skitter|What is that?}}
After defeating Waximus:
:{{text|say|Skitter|The candles melted! We go deeper!}}
:{{text|say|Skitter|Just ahead! Almost there!}}

===Enter the Throne Room===
:Make your way into the Candle King's inner sanctum.
*Enter the Throne Room

Proceed through the room, while doding [[Candleclaw Knight]]s. The [[Candleclaw Bootlicker]]s can be ignored as long as the disguise is up.

===Acquire the Candle Keys from Dripear===
:Defeat [[Dripear the Waxy]], the High Wax-o-mancer, and take his keys.
*Acquire the [[The Candle Keys|Candle Keys]]

After defeating Dripear:
:{{text|say|Skitter|Quick! Grab key, take Crown!}}

===Retrieve the Candle Crown===
:Search the Candle King's treasures for the Candle Crown.
*Retrieve the Candle Crown

Find the [[Candle Crown]] in one of the chests of [[Discarded Loot]]:

:{{text|say|Skitter|Yes! Crown symbol of hope! Candle King no take it from us!}}
:{{text|say|Skitter|Now we escape! Let's go!}}

In the Discarded Loot chests nearby, you will find [[Well Worn Doll]], [[Crusty Chalice]], [[Royal Nailpicker]], [[Cloak of Beards]], [[Chocolate Coins]], [[Backup Candles]], [[Necklace of Kobold Teeth]] and [[CANDLE KING DIARY]].

===Escape the Lost Mines===
:Speak with Skitter to tunnel out before the Candle King returns!
*Speak with Skitter to exit the Darkflame Cleft

Talk to Skitter to leave:
{{Dialogue|We have it! Run!

{{Gossip|quest=|Let's get out of here!}}
}}

Completing this quest is the first criterion of [[The Ringing Deeps (achievement)]].
