==Objectives==
Help Machine Speakers secure Ironhaul Station.
*Help the [[Machine Speakers]] secure [[Ironhaul Station]] (0/100%)

==Description==
I've been away too long. The Machine Speakers are clearly not faring well here. Does the High Speaker know about this?

[[Nerubian]] sabotage and gross negligence are a devastating combination. We need to get Ironhaul Station up and running as soon as possible. It's a vital link between the [[Ringing Deeps]] and [[Dornogal|the city up above]].

Please <name>, help our injured workers, collect any salvageable cargo, and restore safety to Ironhaul Station.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Dead nerubian skitterlings, unexploded bombs, injured workers... what a mess.

==Completion==
Thank you for getting the workers on their feet. You've restored order, or at least enough for us to get back to work.

The best way to impress [[Foreman Uzjax]] is by getting work done, and you're doing that.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>whispers* ... but tread carefully. He's loyal to the powers that be, so we should watch what we say.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|This is unacceptable. If [[Foreman Uzjax|Uzjax]] won't aid the injured, then we will.}}

Pick up [[Getting Off Track]] before heading out.

Fill the bar by:
*[[Malfunctioning Railbot]]s slain or loot [[Valuable Parts]] from [[Priority Transport Crate]]s (5-6%)
*[[Injured Railhand]] helped (11-12%)
*[[Nerubian Explolsive Cache]]s disarmed (7-8%)

Healed Railhands will say one of:
*{{text|say|Injured Railhand|Appreciation offered.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Railhand|Check on the others. I'm functional.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Railhand|Expressing relief! Glad to see a friendly... whatever you are,}}
*{{text|say|Injured Railhand|Give me a moment... regaining strength...}}
*{{text|say|Injured Railhand|Painful... not a memory I'm going to keep.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Railhand|Timely intervention! I declare my gratitude.}}
