# Ringing Deeps storyline

[[File:VZ-Ringing Deeps.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

'''The Ringing Deeps storyline''' starts immediately after concluding the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]], taking place in the [[Ringing Deeps]], the second zone of [[The War Within campaign]] on [[Khaz Algar]].

The [[Machine Speakers]] are also dealing with [[nerubian]] attacks, and other things are going wrong as well.

==Campaign==
The three-chapter campaign is tracked in [[The Ringing Deeps (achievement)]]:

===By Candlelight===

Through the repaired [[Coreway]], the outsiders descended into the [[Ringing Deeps]] alongside [[Speaker Brinthe]] to meet her subterranean kin, the [[Machine Speakers]]. At [[Ironhaul Station]], they found workers and foremen still recovering from a [[nerubian]] ambush, one of several recent disasters. The leader of the Machine Speakers, [[High Speaker Eirich]], was focused on restoring the long-dormant [[Awakening Machine]], which had been inactive for millennia. As a result of his neglect, long-lived [[earthen]] throughout the Ringing Deeps were continuing to shut down, unable to replenish their life force. Traveling to the city of [[Gundargaz]], the outsiders and their allies learned more of the problems left unaddressed under Eirich's leadership. Brinthe and the outsiders turned their attention to a [[kobold]] incursion in the region. There they met [[Skitter]], a kobold who urged them to help liberate her people from the rule of the [[Candle King]]. Together they infiltrated the [[Darkflame Cleft]], the Candle King's stronghold, and recovered the [[Candle Crown]], a symbol of hope for the kobolds of the [[Warrens]].

===Dark Revelations===

[[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]], recalling events on the surface, urged the outsiders and [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]] to investigate unusual activity in the mining town of [[Taelloch]]. Upon arrival, they found the settlement deserted and shrouded in fog, with only primal wildlife roaming the streets. While searching for clues, the group witnessed an earthen undergoing a transformation into a [[skardyn]]. Following a series of slates left behind, they tracked the disturbance to a cave where the town's [[Kol Brunkrag|foreman]] had sealed herself inside. She, too, succumbed to the transformation, and the outsiders, aided by Magni and Dagran, were forced to put her down. Recovering her memory gem, they uncovered evidence that the foreman had overheard High Speaker Eirich and [[Xal'atath]] discussing the “perfection” of the Awakening Machine. The vision revealed their plan: to reawaken the earthen as skardyn.

Magni and Dagran returned to Gundargaz to inform Speaker Brinthe of High Speaker Eirich's actions. When the outsiders rejoined them, they accompanied Brinthe and her allies to [[The Earthenworks]] to confront the High Speaker. Moira arrived with reinforcements, including [[Adelgonn]] and the soldiers of [[Dornogal]]. After pushing through Eirich's loyalists and defenses, the group confronted the High Speaker and urged him to abandon his plan. He refused and instead reactivated the Awakening Machine, intending to transform the slumbering earthen into skardyn. As the device stirred to life, Eirich escaped through a shadowy portal. In the aftermath, Dagran encouraged Magni to reach out to [[Azeroth]]'s [[Worldsoul]] once more. Magni attempted to commune with her directly, causing his body to turn to erupt in light and turn into stone. When the light faded, the statue cracked, and Magni emerged restored to his original dwarven form. He no longer bore the title of Speaker, but his act awakened a new generation of earthen, led by the first of the awakened, [[Dawn]]. With Eirich's flight, Brinthe was named the new High Speaker and pledged the Machine Speakers' aid against the nerubians. Soon after, [[Anduin Wrynn]] arrived with information shared by Adelgonn: there's a nearby cavern called [[Hallowfall]], which is the home to humans known as the [[Hallowfall Arathi|Arathi]], who may be connected to the [[Arathor|ancient human empire]].
