==Objectives==
Kill [[Risen Magma]] and [[Slag Bubble]]s near [[Hallowfall Gate]].
* [[Magma elemental]]s slain (12)

==Description==
As if the pipe going down wasn't enough, a horde of magmatic elementals burst out when it failed.

We can't risk sending anyone else down to attempt repairs while the area is overrun, but that magma is vital to powering the whole [[Ringing Deeps|Deeps]].

If you are capable, clear them out so we can get that magma flowing again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
Commendable job. We could do with a little less excitement in our work.

==Progression==
{{Magma-nificence}}

==Patch changes==
