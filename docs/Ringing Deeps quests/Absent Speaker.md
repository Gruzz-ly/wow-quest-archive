'''Absent Speaker''' begins the The Monster and the Machine chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Speaker Brinthe]] in the [[Earthenworks]].

==Description==
It is a dark day for the [[Ringing Deeps]], <name>.

I've always knew there was something about the [[High Speaker Eirich|High Speaker]] that wasn't quite right. Now we have proof.

And we need justice. If he has plans for the [[Awakening Machine]], then we've got to stop him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The High Speaker and his followers will answer for their crimes.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Enough talking! The High Speaker will answer for his crimes. To the Earthenworks!}}
:''Brinthe, Dagran, and Magni run off.''

Head north to the Earthenworks, where Moira has enlisted some of the Oathsworn from on the surface:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I suspected we might need some assistance.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Moira informed us of the situation. We're ready to help.}}

Present are [[Speaker Brinthe]], [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Adelgonn]], [[Dagran Thaurissan II]], [[Magni Bronzebeard]], [[Skitter]], [[Janky]], [[Fourman Grimes]], and several [[Oathsworn Volunteer]]s and [[Earthen Stormrider]]s.

After completion, Moira has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|A fine mess, this is.

{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:''Moira sheathes her hammer and looks over at Magni. The background music changes to that of [[Dun Morogh]].''
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I can see how worried you are about Dagran.}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I've got a lot to make up for. For a long time, I knew I needed to protect Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I gave up a lot. I gave up too much. I should have spent more time protecting you and Dagran.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Dagran's been through a lot, too.}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I know. I want to be here for him as his Gran'da.}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I wasn't responsible enough. That needs to change.}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I've spent too many years listening to Azeroth's voice. I'm glad I can listen to yours now.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Aye, Father. We'll figure it out together.}}
