==Objectives==
Report to [[Alleria]] in [[Dornogal]].
* Take the elevator from [[Opportunity Point]] to [[Isle of Dorn]] (Optional)
* Report to Alleria in Dornogal.

==Description==
So [[Gallywix]] has chosen to show his ugly face here, and it looks like he's got himself organized.

We should report this to Alleria. See how she wants to handle it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* [[Lingering Shadows (achievement)]]

==Completion==
You've brought me far more than just information.

Although I have a feeling that this... Orweyna... will not give up her secrets easily. I should be patient. I am sure that we will find common ground eventually.

In the meantime, there is someone that she should talk to.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I must follow my visions, follow this calling, until I have found what the goddess wants me to see.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Looks like we're on the same path. Join us on the surface and maybe you can get some help from your new friends.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Friends...}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I'm going to keep looking for the source of those sounds. And Bilgewater, don't forget about your people while you're off saving the world.}}
:''Orweyna leaves.''

Go to the [[Foundation Hall]] where [[Alleria]], Gazlowe and Orweyna are talking about what transpired.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|And that's what's happening. Gallywix is back in business, and that ain't good for no one.}}

Characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Gazlowe|I got more questions than answers. What are they looking for down there?

And Gallywix... Why did it have to be Gallywix?}}

{{dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|What news do you bring, <name>?}}

On completion:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Our mysterious ally returns. You slipped away last time, before we could thank you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|That is our way... it was my way.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|But my visions have put me on another path. I was told by your people share these visions.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|If you want to talk about visions, I know just the [[Magni Bronzebeard|dwarf]].}}
