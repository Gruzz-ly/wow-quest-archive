==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Terrified Grubtenders.
*[[Terrified Grubtender]] freed (6)

==Description==
All happen so fast. One moment, we gathering eggs and [[Jawcrawler|grubs]]. Next, [[Undercrawler|spiders]] swarming.

Nebb drag me here, many others trapped. Caught in webs, soon to be feasts. Must save the Grubtenders.

We tenders, not fighters. Do not let friends become meals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hurry. Spiders prefer grubs, but spiders very hungry.

==Completion==
Aha, Grubtenders free! They survive to harvest again.

==Notes==
[[Terrified Grubtender]]s are trapped in [[undercrawler]] webs around the area. When freed:
