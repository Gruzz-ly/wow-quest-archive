==Objectives==
Meet [[Keldaz]] outside of the northeastern mine.

==Description==
[[Orsenth]] told me you have been instrumental in dealing with the [[elemental]] problem here at the mine. I am Keldaz, supervisor for the [[militia]]. We came as soon as word of the attack reached us in [[Gundargaz]]. The miners you rescued said that the elementals poured out of the northeast mine shaft. 

I will leave some of my guards here to lend their support and have sent for reinforcements. If you are still willing to help, meet me outside the cave and let us see what we can do to staunch the flow of elementals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|85}}
*2,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, <name>, you made it. We did as well, but were attacked often on our way over. Unfortunately, Nanthaz took a heavy blow and needs time to recover.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Keldaz|Let's go, [[Nanthaz]]! <Name>, we shall meet you at the cave.}}

Upon catching up with Keldaz and Nanthaz:
:{{text|say|Keldaz|<Name>! Over here!}}

==Progression==
