==Objectives==
Kill 10 Rampaging Elementals.
*[[Rampaging Elemental (Ringing Deeps)|Rampaging Elemental]] slain (10)

==Description==
Catastrophe! Oh, this is awful. Awful! Those accursed [[Slag elemental|slag heap elementals]] are keeping my refinery workers from being able to do their jobs.

Duty demands we carry on our work. These delays will not be tolerated. You look competent enough. Go on, get down there and get to work destroying elementals. Production must not be slowed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well? Did you destroy them? I need my crew back to work immediately!

==Completion==
What a terrible delay in production. The miners will have to work twice as hard to make up for lost time, I am afraid.

It is good you came around when you did. Those elementals are a menace. An awful menace!

==Notes==
Upon approach:
*{{text|say|Refinery Worker|Someone needs to get down there and drive those elementals off!}}
*{{text|say|Refinery Worker|How can we perform our duties with them running rampant in the refinery?}}

*{{text|say|Refinery Worker|Those elementals are making a terrible mess.}}
*{{text|say|Refinery Worker|We cannot fall behind in production. Someone get down there and do something.}}
*{{Text|say|Refinery Worker|They are trying to destroy everything!}}
*{{Text|say|Refinery Worker|This is an outrage! We must get back to work!}}
