==Objectives==
Bring the Cinderbrew Reserve to [[Cogwin]] at the [[Hallowfall Gate]].
* [[Cinderbrew Reserve]] returned

==Description==
Trade may have been restricted, but I'll calcify before I let my Cinderbrew Reserve fall into the hands of these stripped screws or go up when some [[elemental]] looks at it funny.

The inspectors are watching me, stranger, so I can't go fetch it myself, but they won't be paying any special attention to you.

I left it behind the desk in my old office, down below.

Just don't get too close to an enforcer or they'll confiscate any cinderbrew you're carrying and I'll be left with nothing to drink.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have it?

==Completion==
Ah, now this is a brew worth waiting for. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
The cinderbrew can be found in an office slightly to the south. Once acquired, you will have to make the trek back to Cogwin by foot. Stay away from [[Embargo Enforcer]]s field of vision. If they catch you, they will say:
:{{text|say|Embargo Enforcer|Contraband detected. Seizing!}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Cogwin|Cheers, stranger!}}

Completing the quest awards the "Magma-nificence" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
