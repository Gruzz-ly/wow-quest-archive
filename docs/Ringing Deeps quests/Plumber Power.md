==Notes==
[[File:Plumber Power puzzle.jpg|thumb|A sliding block puzzle]]

Head to the marked spot on the minimap on the northeast side of the building. There, a [[Tunnel Rat Crew Boss]] and three [[Quickwick Tunnel Rat]]s are looking at a [[Tunnel Access]] door.

Interact with the door to start a sliding block puzzle, asking players to make a solid connection from left to right using the available pipes. Once solved, click the semi-circular "go forward" button as shown in the bottom-right of the puzzle screenshot.

Solve the puzzle three times. After solving the first puzzle Tunnel Rat Crew Boss says:
:{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Crew Boss|Job good! Two more to go.}}
After solving the second:
:{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Crew Boss|You natural. Last one!}}
After solving the third:
:{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Crew Boss|We take from here!}}
:{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Crew Boss|Tunnel rats rule!}}
:''They all enter the tunnel.''

Should players want to skip the puzzle, speak with the crew boss:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
Kobold and tunnel go together like candle and...kobold!

Entrance right there. Give try!

Let know if need help reading plans. Not everyone meant for tunnel life.

*{{Gossip|quest=|I'll map out the pipes myself.}}
*{{gossip|Let's go over the plans together.<br> {{text|red|Warning: this will skip the puzzle but take a long time.}}}}
}}

This starts a ''two minute long'' "Reading Plans" cast, but it will do as promised and skip the puzzle.
