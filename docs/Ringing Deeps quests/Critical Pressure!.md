Consequences for deal with later!

==Completion==

Always something, <name>. Maybe old pipes behave now, yes?

==Notes==
[[File:Geothermus.jpg|thumb|[[Geothermus]]]]

Above the inn is a gigantic Main Release Valve. Interact with it to spawn [[Geothermus]], a [[steam elemental]], then defeat it. For this iteration of "What [[Magic schools|magic school]] is steam damage?", the answer is Fire.

On complete:

:{{text|say|Steamwarden Hurlt|We're going to have to talk about your disregard for protocol, though. Or at least safety regulations.}}
:{{text|say|Fourman Grimes|We see, stonehead. We see.}}

This is one of the three criteria for [[Home Is Where the Candle Is]]. The other two are also started in the kobold house of [[Gundargaz]], [[New Home, New Candle!]] and [[Dripsy Forgot Her Candle]].
