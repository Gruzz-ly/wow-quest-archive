==Objectives==
Meet [[Speaker Brinthe]] in [[Gundargaz]].
* Ask Speaker Brinthe about the High Speaker
*Find Speaker Brinthe in Gundargaz

==Description==
I'm seeing legitimate concerns. We have to do something about the [[nerubian]]s... even if the High Speaker won't. If he won't do something, I will.

The High Speaker sent me to the surface because I wasn't "reasonable." I think we should have a chance to... reason... with him. We'll need to go to Gundargaz.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|85}}
*2,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So much for reason.

[[Ringing Deeps|The Ringing Deeps]] has plenty of problems, and the High Speaker is obviously distracted. He sounds obsessed!

<Name>, if you and your companions can help us solve some of our challenges here, maybe I can convince the [[Machine Speakers]] to help you against the [[nerubian]]s. That's a problem that concerns us all.

==Notes==
Speak with Brinthe again:
{{dialogue|I have been gone too long. The sounds of industry, of our people's life force... they are but faint echoes of a better time. Instead of fuel and oil, these caverns reek of despair.

This place is broken. I can fix it.

I know I can.

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays, Meeting The High Speaker:
{{#ev:youtube|PkK5xgyVFHg|Meeting The High Speaker}}

''Brinthe and the adventurer are speaking as [[Dagran Thaurissan II]], [[Magni Bronzebeard]], and [[Moira Thaurissan]] walk up. Dagran stops and looks off in the distance to see an ostentatiously-large railcar being pulled by earthen on the tracks at [[Ironhaul Station]].''

''At the rail intersection, the earthen stop pulling the railcar as Brinthe and the rest of their party walk up. Atop the throne is [[High Speaker Eirich]].''

{{text|bossemote|High Speaker Eirich|And who is this? Brinthe? I almost forgot I sent you away...}}

{{text|bossemote|High Speaker Eirich|I have been busy addressing our greatest problem: the Awakening Machine!}}

{{text|bossemote|High Speaker Eirich|What distractions have you brought before me this time, Brinthe?}}

{{text|bossemote|Brinthe|These outlanders crashed on our shores...}}

{{text|bossemote|High Speaker Eirich|I have no time for your misadventures.}}

{{text|bossemote|Brinthe|High Speaker, the nerubians...}}

{{text|bossemote|High Speaker Eirich|Enough! Outlanders, you may wander where you will, but when you are done, return from whence you came.}}

{{text|bossemote|High Speaker Eirich|The High Speaker... has SPOKEN.}}

''Eirich closes his eyes, expecting something to happen. When nothing does, he opens them again and claps to get the attention of his railcar pullers, who dutifully start pulling away. Brinthe and the adventurer share a look, and Brinthe responds with a gesture of resignation. They all start walking along the tracks toward [[Gundargaz]].''

After the cutscene, catch up with [[Speaker Brinthe]] at [[Gundargaz]], and make sure to pick up the flight path from [[Igram Underwing]]!

Moira has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|The Earthen in the Ringing Deeps remind me of my people. Hard workers. Faithful. Sometimes, forgotten by those who depend on the strength o' their hands.

I think we'll get along fine.}}

On the way, in the inn, [[Innkeeper Brax]] starts [[Brax's Brass Knuckles]].
