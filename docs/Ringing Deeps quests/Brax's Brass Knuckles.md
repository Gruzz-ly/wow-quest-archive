==Objectives==
Kill creatures around [[Gundargaz]] to find Brax's Brass Knuckles.
* Find [[Brax's Brass Knuckles (quest item)]]
* Pacify Rowdy Patrons (6)

==Description==
I have a proposition for you.

We get some rowdy patrons here from time to time. Nothing sinister, but our folk work hard and things can get out of hand faster than a dropped hammer. 

Usually I'd give 'em a considerate knock upside the head to remind them what's what, but I lost my brass knuckles while helping Watcher Toki clear monsters on the town's skirts.

Mind fetching my knuckles and administering some love taps?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|11|70}}
* 5,450 [[XP]]
* [[Brax's Brass Knuckle]]

==Progress==
Now which beasts did I punch with those knuckles last...

==Completion==
That's the genius of the knuckles. They keep your hands intact!

==Notes==
Slay mobs around [[Gundargaz]] until they drop [[Brax's Brass Knuckles (quest item)]]. Some other items related to Brax also have a chance to drop:
*[[Brax's Other Hat]]
*[[Brax's To-Do List]]
*[[Brax's Left Shoe]]
*[[Brax's Toothpick]]
*[[Brax's Favorite Cog]]

After that go into the inn and hit [[Rowdy Patron]]s with the Brass Knuckle Sandwich:
*{{Text|say|Rowdy Patron|Allright, allright! I'll bugger off.}}
*{{Text|say|Rowdy Patron|Point taken!}}
*{{Text|say|Rowdy Patron|Good shot!}}
*{{Text|say|Rowdy Patron|You have a stronger arm than Brax!}}
*{{Text|say|Rowdy Patron|I think I'll take a walk...}}
*{{Text|say|Rowdy Patron|I didn't mean to break anything!}}

;Description
Hail, friend.

I have a proposition for you.

We get some rowdy patrons here from time to time. Nothing sinister, but our folk work hard and things can get out of hand faster than a dropped hammer.

Usually I'd give 'em a considerate knock upside the head to remind them what's what, but I lost my brass knuckles clearing [[basilisk]]s on the town's skirts for [[Watcher Toki]].

Mind fetching my knuckles and administering some love taps?

;Progress
A polished gem is a happy gem, I say!
