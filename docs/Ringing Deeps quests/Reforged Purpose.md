I'm forever grateful to you.

==Notes==

Speak with Kittrin again:
{{Dialogue|
{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to help you reforge the tools.}}
}}

Sets of three [[Spattered Charcoal]] pop out of the forge. Kick them back in to fill the bar. Meanwhile:
:{{text|say|Machinist Kittrin|Rock and flame, storm and sea...}}
:{{text|say|Machinist Kittrin|Stamp our purpose on our stone...}}
:{{text|say|Machinist Kittrin|Tools reforged and function shown...}}
:{{text|say|Machinist Kittrin|Once again, my purpose be.}}

Fill the bar:
:{{text|say|Machinist Kittrin|It's done. My tools and my purpose are back in my hands!}}

After completing the quest, Kittrin has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
{{gossip|What will you do now that you have your tools back?}}

Now, I will live in service of the machine that keeps our unawakened kin safe. And, hopefully, if the Machine comes to life itself again, I will be there to keep it running.

Maybe I could even taken on an apprentice!}}
