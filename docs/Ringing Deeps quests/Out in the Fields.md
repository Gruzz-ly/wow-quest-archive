==Objectives==
Deploy goblin bots in the [[Writhing Fields]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]].
* Bots deployed (6)

==Description==
If [[Trixxie Boltcrank|Trixxie]] has those bots ready, then all we gotta do is mark where they needa work.

Head out, fire a flare, and deploy those tin cans--an' see if they actually, yanno, work.

Watch for glitchy servos, smokin' coolant vents... You know the drill.

If they start doin' their work? Great.

If not, well... I might be callin' some workers back in to clean up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The longer it takes us to deploy those bots, the longer my workers gotta be in that Black Blood sludge.

And the longer I have to pay 'em!

==Completion==
They worked? I mean, of course they did!

==Notes==
Deploy bots at marked locations with the extra action button:
:{{abilities|Signal Flare|Fire a signal flate to summon a fixer bot to the location, ready to tackle repairs with goblin-engineered flair (and maybe a few sparks).}}
