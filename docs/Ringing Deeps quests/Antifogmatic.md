==Objectives==
Disperse the fog around [[Camp Murroch]].
* [[Thick Fog]] dispersed (6)
* [[Antifogmatic (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Machine Speakers|Machine speakers]] have no love for [[fog beast]]s. Where there is fog, rust is sure to follow. Still, I'd prefer not to harm them. Arbauch always said it was bad luck.

Take this device. The glands you collected should provide enough power to disperse the fog without hurting the fog beasts within.

Caution. Fog beasts are skittish, but other creatures may also lurk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}} 
* 5,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done? We have little time to waste.

==Completion==
Fine work. I hope [[Clive DelGizmo|DelGizmo]]'s information is worth the trouble.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|[[Clive DelGizmo]]|What's that do? You gonna blast 'em?}}
:{{text|say|Danagh|No, only scare them. Irrational to harm a fog beast.}}

Go around [[Camp Murroch]] and use the {{Abilities|Antifogmatic|id=452657|icon=inv_engineering_90_lightningbox}} extra action button on the mist around the camp. When the mist is dispersed, either a [[Skittish Fog Beast]] or a [[Saurolisk Ambusher]] will appear.

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Danagh|Now, shopkeep, what do you know?}}
:{{text|say|Clive DelGizmo|Yeah, Arbauch was here. Looked real nervous.}}
:{{text|say|Clive DelGizmo|Said something about a substation underneath Murroch. Didn't make much sense to me.}}
