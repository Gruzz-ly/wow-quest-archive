{{Dialogue|You ready hear story, tenderfoot?

{{gossip|quest=|Tell me about Dripsy, Granny Scribbles.}}}}

This teleports the adventurer to the [[Obsidian Hollow]], but in a different phase. The hollow is normally a {{level|tww-max}} [[elite area]], but on this quest it's at the player character's level. Hop off the ledge and Granny starts her story:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Dripsy go hunt for shiny rocks and tasty treats. Search far from safety of tribe.}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|But Dripsy forget to bring extra candle, and it slowly get dark...}}

Start killing [[Sweetshine Grub]]s for their [[Sweetmeat]] and looting [[Shinies (Ringing Deeps)|Shinies]] for a [[Shiny Rock (Ringing Deeps)]], but steer clear of [[Scary Sticker]]s and [[Scary Skitterer]]s.

At six:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|...and darker as candle grow short while she look for just one more. Dark press in, but she not notice...}}

Players are buffed with:
:{{abilities|Scared of the Dark|Candle is running low...}}

At twelve, the screen goes dark and the player starts losing chunks of health:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Until candle go out and Dripsy alone in dark. And CRUNCH go poor Dripsy!}}

After the loading screen, the player is back in Gundargaz:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|And that why never go out without candle, tenderfoots. Or go crunch like Dripsy!}}

If the player leaves the story:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|You even listening? That not how story go! Go back!}}
