==Objectives==
Destroy the haywire excavators.
*[[Haywire Excavator]] slain (4)
*Meet [[Renzik "The Shiv"|Renzik]] in the [[Abyssal Excavation]]

==Description==
I saw many machines nearby, and all of them seem to make dreadful noises. I cannot hear the one that I heard in the vision, though, at least not clearly.

Destroy the excess ones. They are only in the way.

While you are quieting the scene, I will hunt and scout.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You're not who I expected to see here.

==Completion==
Looks like you're interested in the foreman's office too, huh?

Don't get cranky, we're on the same side here. I just can't get close without being seen.

And then there's just one big, clanking wrinkle to this whole mess.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Whisper|Orweyna|I will scout on my own. Good luck with your hunt.}}

Go to the [[Abyssal Excavation]] and slay the [[Haywire Excavator]]s.
:{{Text|Say|Haxle Drillbit|You'll never get to meet the big boss....}}

Loot the [[Opportunity Work Permit]] and go to the [[Opportunity Point]] to meet up with [[Gazlowe]].
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|There you are. Did you get that permit?}}

He has a gossip:
{{dialogue|Got that work order? We can open up way more doors with it than without it.}}

Go to the structure where [[Renzik "The Shiv"|Renzik]] is on the roof.
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Psst! You're like an ogre in [[Gnomeregan]], asking questions and breaking things. Get over here.}}
