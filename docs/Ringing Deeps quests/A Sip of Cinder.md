==Objectives==
Fill a keg with Cinderbrew Mead.
* Cask filled (0/100%)

==Description==
Now there's one last thing we need. It wouldn't be a proper recitation ceremony without mead.

However, [[Hearthkeeper Zirc]] tells me the last couple deliveries of cinderbrew haven't arrived. It seems the local flayers in the Rumbling Wastes have a taste for it and raid the shipments.

Here, take a spare keg. See what you can recover from the flayers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Careful out there, flayers are already dangerous enough. I wouldn't want to meet one that's been guzzling cinderbrew.

==Completion==
Thank you, the miners will appreciate this. I hope the flayers weren't too much trouble.

==Notes==
Fill the bar by recovering:
*10% [[Nearly-empty Cask]]
*7-8%: [[Cinderbrew Flask]]

Defeat [[Waste Flayer]]s, [[Brew-barmy Flayer]]s, and [[Mead-Mad Flayer]]s and loot the alcohol.

On complete:

During the beta, [[Crackdown on Cask-cruncher]] was available in the [[Rumbling Wastes]] during this quest.
