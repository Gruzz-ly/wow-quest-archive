[[File:Buried in Stone.jpg|thumb|A suspicious Cave Blockage]]

==Objectives==
Investigate the cave at the back of the [[Taelloch Mine]]
* Cave entered
* Cave explored
* [[Cave Blockage|Blockage]] destroyed

==Description==
We need to go into the cave, the one mentioned near the last slate. It's not signed, but I think that's [[Kol Bruncrag|the foreman]]'s handwriting... and we've looked everywhere else. We have to investigate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We're missing something... There must be something in that cave!

==Completion==
I knew it! I was right! There's something in here. Something someone was trying to hide.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|The foreman's last entry mentioned a cavern. It must be nearby!}}

The cave entrance is north of the fourth Earthen Slate. Head in:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|This looks like the right place... but I don't see any signs of the foreman. We need to take a closer look!}}

Further in, the cave is blocked by a rather suspicious Cave Blockage:
:{{text|say|[[Magni Bronzebeard]]|Wait... I can hear wind blowing... from beyond the stone.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|It must have been a controlled cave-in! <Name>! Help us destroy the blockage!}}

Attack it with player abilities to destroy it.
