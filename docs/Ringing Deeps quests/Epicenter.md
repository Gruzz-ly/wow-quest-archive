==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Verdant Hulk.jpg|Verdant Hulk|Attracted to the powerful energies of [[Fearbreaker]], it will not relinquish territory without a fight.}}

Approach the [[Verdant Hulk]].
* Verdant Hulk approached
* Verdant Hulk slain
*Meet Moira Thaurissan in the Living Grotto.

==Description==
There is the creature standing between us and that magic hammer. It certainly made an impact when it landed here in the [[Ringing Deeps]], didn't it? Look at the size of that crater!

With the pollen and water splashed on you like this, you should be able to approach that beast and, theoretically, not be harmed. You'll blend right in with it!

But if it does turn aggressive, don't worry, I'll be right behind you.

We'll get that hammer out of here safely!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Why that amber-sucking, slime-spined, travesty of an [[earthen]]! I've met troggs with more honor!

He took Fearbreaker! He took my family's hammer and left us to die to that creature!

This cannot stand. I will not allow such disrespect to you... or to me.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|You should be able to run right up to it. Go on, I'll follow you!}}
:''Moira mounts up while Berrund just runs down to the Verdant Hulk.''

Follow them down and get within aggro range of the hulk, a large [[genesaur]]:
:{{text|emote|The Verdant Hulk smells the Lashroom Dust upon you and bellows in rage!}}
:{{text|yell|Berrund the Gleaming|No hard feelings! I will do great things in your memory with this hammer!}}
:''Berrund [[loot ninja|ninjas]] the hammer, and the action of taking it traps Moira in a stalagmite.''
:{{text|yell|Moira Thaurissan|You ill-formed son of a pebble!}}
:''Moira frees herself and flies after Berrund.

Fend off the hulk and catch Moira by water's edge to the east. She has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
When [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]] dropped Fearbreaker, I thought that was the end o' the legacy an' there was no going back. Now, there's a chance tae recover the hammer and it slipped away from me.

We have tae find Berrund before he gets himself killed.

{{gossip|I thought you didn't want Fearbreaker?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I don't. 

I didn't.

By the [[Black Anvil]], I don't have time tae think this through right now. It's clear that people are in danger, an' the hammer's not where it ought tae be. We can talk about this later.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
