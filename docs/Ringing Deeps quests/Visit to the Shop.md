==Objectives==
Find [[Trixxie Boltcrank]]'s workshop further in the depths of [[Sanity's Rest]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]].

==Description==
That's all we can do for now. 

But if you really wanna help us fix all this, you ought to talk to our local engineer--uh, Tricksy... or maybe Trixxy. 

She's got her workshop set up further down in the cave, and Benny's got her tinkerin' away day and night on some kind of... "permanent solution." 

Odd, but she's sharp as a blade. If anyone's got a chance at makin' people safe down here, it's her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10 [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Ey! Can't ya see I'm busy here?

Whaddaya want?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Stitchoaf|'Meantime, I'll start a new batch.}}

On complete, Trixxie has new gossip:
{{dialogue|It's not so much a "help the workers" solution to keep 'em from gettin' poisoned.

It's more of a "keep the workers away" solution that keeps 'em from bein' in danger in the first place.

Benny likes it 'cause after the initial expense, he thinks it'll line his pockets.

<Trixxie rolls her eyes and starts counting on her gloved hand.>

But there's breakdowns, fuel consumption, and maintenance to consider, and that's not counting the low-but-not-zero chance that the bots might rebel against us...}}
