==Objectives==
Burn 6 Deepsflayer Nests.
*Burn [[Deepsflayer Nest]]s (6)

==Description==
While the [[krolusk]]s like to attack from beneath, the [[Rumbling Wastes|Rumbling Waste]]{{sic}} also plays host to a predator who prefers to swoop down from above. [[Deepflayer|Deepsflayer]]s have built nests on the peaks and ridges around the Waste.

Destroy their nests and show them that the Waste is no welcoming home.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's show those overgrown bats that the Wastes is no home for them!

==Completion==
I could see the smoke from here! Good job! That ought to make those wretched things look for a new place to perch.

==Notes==
[[Deepsflayer Nest]]s are marked on the minimap, and will aggro any nearby [[Waste Flayer]]s.

==Progression==
{{Revenge in the Rumbling Wastes}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
