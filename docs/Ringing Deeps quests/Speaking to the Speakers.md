==Objectives==
Reassure [[Gundargaz]]' defenders on the way to the [[Lost Mines]].
* Defenders reassured (3)
* Vantage point secouted

==Description==
I've heard about a problem nearby, and I think I know what's wrong.

We used to have a mining operation northeast of Gundargaz. When we moved out, [[kobold]]s moved in.

We haven't heard from those kobolds in a long time, but it sounds like they're raiding us now! And the High Speaker is doing nothing about it.

Someone has to do something. If we can solve this, more [[Machine Speakers]] will listen to us. If the High Speaker doesn't get results, we will.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's good to see some of the kobolds are not so keen on this war.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Moira, please continue speaking to the citizens here. <Name>, I'd like your help with this kobold problem.}}
:''Brinthe walks outside and disappears.''

Brinthe has new gossip:
{{dialogue|I hope Ironhaul Station isn't a sign of things to come...}}

Before leaving town, new optional sidequests open up: [[Discarded and Broken]] from [[Machinist Kittrin]], and [[On Cold, Dark Wings]] from [[Watcher Toki]].

Head northeast out of town. On the way, [[Batzvara]] starts [[The Caretaker of Brunwin's Terrace]] while looking at an Inert Earthen:
:{{text|say|Batzvara|Blessings on you, and may the Vault welcome you soon.}}

Further east along the road, Brinthe is speaking with [[Foreman Grint]] and an [[Emergency Militia]]:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Look at this mess. Beaten back and battered with nothing to show for it.}}

Speak with the militiamen:
{{dialogue|Bit busy here.

*{{gossip|By order of the High Speaker, you are to hold the kobolds here!}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|Ha! Where was he when we lost the mines in the first place?}}<br> {{text|say|Foreman Grint|Stow that talk, defender! He is the High Speaker. We do not question him.}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|I'm sorry, but... who are you? What are you doing here? I've got a job to do.}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|Insufficient motivation. We're already doing our best.}}
**{{Text|say|Emergency Militia|I don't suppose he sent any reinforcements?}}
*{{gossip|Run! Flee! The kobolds are coming!}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|I'm sorry, but... who are you? What are you doing here? I've got a job to do.}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|Outlander detected! Deploying mockery! Bah!}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|Very funny.}}
*{{gossip|Speaker Brinthe and I are going to investigate the kobold incursion. Hold on until we get back.}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|A plan, you say? I'll take it.}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|Speaker Brinthe? That's a name I've not heard in an age. If she's involved, count me in.}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|You and what army? No one gives a shale chip about us!}}
*{{gossip|Have no fear! I, <name>, storied hero and famous <class> am here to save the day!}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|Better you than me, outsider. Enjoy getting shivved.}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|Talk is cheap, outlander. A solution is required.}}
**{{text|say|Emergency Militia|The what now? I suppose anyone's better than the nothing we had before.}}

If you heal them: <!-- May be more -->
:{{text|say|Emergency Militia|It was just a scratch...but thanks.}}

After reassuring three:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|As expected, I suppose. We're engineers and crafters, not soldiers.}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Thankfully, outlander, we have you. Let's scout the mines.}}

Head east into the [[Lost Mines]] to spot [[Skitter]] chained to a post:
:{{text|say|Skitter|[[The Candle King|Candle King]] is crazy! Forcing kobolds into war, but many want peace!}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Candle King? Perhaps we face a common foe...}}

Upon completion, [[Speaker Brinthe]] has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|There is much to do, but there is always hope.}}

==Progression==
{{By Candlelight}}
