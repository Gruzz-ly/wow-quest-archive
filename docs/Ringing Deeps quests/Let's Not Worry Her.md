==Objectives==
Return to Haimaz in [[Shadowvein Point]].
* Return to [[Haimaz]]

==Description==
Right, we better get back to Haimaz before she gets suspicious.

Please, don't tell her about any of this. Her duty is to guide and guard me in my role as compiler.

If she knew I was planning to leave... I don't know what she would do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for bringing him back. He always acts strange when we come to Shadowvein Point, but he seems more out of sorts than usual.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brennok|Please, don't tell Haimaz I'm planning to leave. Or about my book. I worry she wouldn't understand.}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|Brennok, where were you? Your duty is to rest.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|All I've ever done is rest.}}

Characters have new gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Haimaz|Brennok's seemed troubled lately. Fixating on stories about oaths and journeys. I hope the Shadowvein recitation raises his spirits.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Brennok|I'm leaving. But I won't abandon my oath.

{{Gossip|Why do you want to leave?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
So many come to me to entrust stories or ask questions. I try to answer well, but I don't really know.

I could describe the sun a hundred ways, but to me it's less real than a candle's flame. 

My stories matter, I know that. I keep memories alive that would otherwise pass into nothing.

But they're all as much as shadows trickling down the cenotes. I want to see the real thing. I want to bring back new stories, not just retell old ones. I want my oath to grow, not stagnate.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
