==Objectives==
Examine [[Ausgazur]] for clues.
* Examine Ausgazur
* Investigate the cooling wax
* Follow the trail of cooling wax
* [[Stolen Gem|Find the gem thief]]

==Description==
This is Ausgazur. His hand is usually full of a selection of his favorite gems. We don't really know what it's like when we go into stasis, but he wanted to spend his last moments contemplating the natural beauty of [[Azeroth]] and her bounty.

I am afraid someone or something has made off with the jewels he usually holds. Let's look around. See if you can find any clues where they may have gone off to.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*5,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ausgazur will never forgive me if his gems go missing. This is very upsetting. Who would steal from an earthen in stasis?

==Completion==
[[Kobold]]s made off with his gems? This is unacceptable! We must recover the rest of Ausgazur's jewels!

==Notes==

Interact with Ausgazur:
{{Dialogue|
<The still form of Ausgazur is splattered with still cooling dribbles of wax.>
}}
:{{text|say|Batzvara|Is that wax? Let's look around to see if there's more.}}

Just downhill is a large [[Cooling Wax Puddle]], with more drops heading downhill:
{{book|content=<A puddle of slowly cooling wax leads away from Ausgazur, towards the stream below.>}}

The next interactable wax puddle is on the other side of the stream:
{{book|content=<This puddle of wax is still slightly warm to the touch.>}}

Head southwest into the [[Waterworks]] and take down a [[Waterworks Gem-Thief]].

Any one will have the [[Stolen Gem]] on their corpse. Head back to Batzvara:
:{{text|say|Batzvara|There you are, my friend. All wax free.}}
