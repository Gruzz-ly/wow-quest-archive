==Objectives==
Find Brennok.
* [[Brennok]] rescued

==Description==
This is the only road to the elevator, he should have been here by now.

Unless... he didn't take the road! He wouldn't want to be seen.

He has no idea how dangerous the deeps can be. We have to find him!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*13,600 [[XP]]
*{{wb|repitem=The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation|repamount=500|faction=The Assembly of the Deeps|altqty1=25|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}
*One from:

|Compiler's Shoulderguards
|Compiler's Chain Clasp
|Compiler's Greaves
}}

==Completion==
If he'd only told me sooner... stone-headed oaf. But if he's set on leaving, he'll need a guide. Not sure he knows how to put one foot in front of the other on his own.

His chronicle is already on a rook headed to Gundargaz. They'll take care of his stories. At least until he's had his fill of his own.

My oath is, and always was, to care for him. I can't do that if I keep him down here.

Thank you for helping him.

==Notes==
On accept, Haimaz joins the party and will follow the player:
:{{text|yell|Brennok|What is that?}}
:{{text|say|Haimaz|Did you hear that? Hurry! He's hardly ever left a paved road. He doesn't understand the dangers.}}

Head down to the north to find Brennok pinned in by [[Grimlurk]]:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|There he is!}}
:{{text|yell|Brennok|Look out, it's dangerous!}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|Come on! Get out of here before more of them turn up.}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Brennok|Haimaz, how did you find me? I won't go back. You can't stop me.}}
:{{text|say|Haimaz|You shale-headed schist-seam! I'm not here to stop you. I'm coming with you.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|You... what? Oh, I've been so foolish.}}

Characters have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Brennok|I have been such a fool. So worried over my oath that I forgot Haimaz has hers as well.

I've been at her side longer than either of us can recall. Of course she would understand.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Haimaz|On his own for five minutes and see what happens. At least traveling with him won't be boring.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Brennok|Thank you, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Haimaz|So, where to first?}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|First, I just want to feel the sun. After that, who knows?}}
:''They walk northeast, in the direction of [[Pillarstone Spire]].''

Completing the quest awards the "Tired of Rest" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
