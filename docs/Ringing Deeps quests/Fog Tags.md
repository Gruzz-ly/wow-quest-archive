==Objectives==
Attach trackers to [[fog beast]]s in and around [[Taelloch]].
* Trackers attached to fog beasts (6)
* [[Fog Beast Tracker]] (provided)

==Description==
While I analyze these fog samples, I have another task for you.

My employers have asked me to figure out where these fog beasts are coming from. I've developed these trackers. If you could, please attach them to an assortment of fog beasts.

You'll have to get close, so... be careful. Hopefully they don't mind it too much!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you attached all the trackers?

==Completion==
You've attached the trackers? Perfect! Did they attack you? No? Interesting... This is all so interesting...

==Notes==

[[Fog Wither]]s and [[Deepflayer Hunter]]s are just to the north, no need to enter [[Taelloch]].
