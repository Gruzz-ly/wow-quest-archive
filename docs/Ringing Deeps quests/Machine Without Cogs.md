==Objectives==
Bring an Overclocked Gear-A-Rang Launcher to [[Speaker Jurlax]] for parts.
* [[Overclocked Gear-a-Rang Launcher]]

==Description==
Diagnosis: This machine's movement is impaired.

We must get it moving again. I'm going to need some replacement parts. The gears must keep grinding.

==Progress==
Did you bring the parts we need?

==Completion==
Precisely what I need: the right part of the right job. 

This should work.

==Notes==
The [[Overclocked Gear-a-Rang Launcher]] drops from [[Speaker Dorlita]] in the [[Stonevault]].
