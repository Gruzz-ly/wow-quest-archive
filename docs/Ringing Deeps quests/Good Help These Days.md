==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Haxle Drillbit.jpg|Haxle Drillbit|Carrying a work permit that accesses operations around Opportunity Point.}}
Find [[Haxle Drillbit]] and shake him down for access to the operation.
*[[Opportunity Work Permit]] taken.
*Meet Gazlowe in [[Opportunity Point]].

==Description==
Seeing you here is a welcome surprise!

There's something big happening over at [[Opportunity Point]], but it's hard to know what without getting closer to the people working there.

I know Haxle's involved. We'll need his paperwork if we want to be able to ask around without trouble...

He's headed down to Opportunity Point.

Go, follow him, and see if he's got anything on him we can use. Don't worry about the mess-- I know you're discrete when you need to be.

And... also not, when you need to be.

==Progress==
Got that work order? We can open up way more doors with it than without it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10 [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Perfect. Now anytime someone asks why we're here, we've got this. Now it's time to do a little snooping.

There are a lot more goblins here than I remember. Something's definitely going on.

==Notes==
Gazlowe's gossip:
{{Dialogue|I haven't seen this many goblins moving around in one place since... well, it's been a while. Kezan comes to mind. 

Something big has to be happening.

{{Gossip|What are you doing here?}}

{{Dialogue-child|Me? I'm on the trail of some big operation in the Ringing Deeps. Why are there so many goblins working right at the edge of the cave? 

Why are there so many different cartels in one place? It's not even our annual convention!

And who the blast is in charge of it all?

Things like that. Questions, questions.}}

:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|This Haxle guy has the papers we need to set up close and see what they're up to.}}
:{{Text|Whisper|Orweyna|Go. I will follow unseen. This must be what the visions meant for us to do.}}

Go and find Haxle Drillbit.
:{{Text|Say|Haxle Drillbit|Back off! This job is mine! I paid good bribes for it!}}

Slay him.
:{{Text|Say|Haxle Drillbit|You'll never get to meet the big boss....}}

Loot the [[Opportunity Work Permit]] and go to the [[Opportunity Point]] and meet up with [[Gazlowe]].
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|There you are. Did you get that permit?}}
