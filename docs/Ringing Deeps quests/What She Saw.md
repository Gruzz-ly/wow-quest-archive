[[File:What She Saw.jpg|thumb|A vision of [[High Speaker Eirich]] and [[Xal'atath]]]]

==Objectives==
Investigate the gem left by [[Kol Bruncrag|the skardyn]]
* [[Memory Gem|Gem]] examined
* Memory viewed

==Description==
What is that? That thing the [[skardyn]] dropped before we... before it died.

I think I've seen something like that before.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*13,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I think I know what that gem is...

==Completion==
Oh. This is bad, isn't it?

The foreman witnessed this conspiracy at the [[Hall of Awakening]].

Then she traveled back to [[Taelloch]] with her memory gem.

She tried to warn the others, but she was infected... and her transformation was swift. She sealed herself in this cave, but her corruption still spread.

And the [[High Speaker Eirich|High Speaker]] knew what would happen. The High Speaker is behind all of this!

We've got to warn [[Speaker Brinthe|Brinthe]]. We've got to warn [[Azeroth|the world]].

==Notes==
[[File:Memory Gem Taelloch Mine.jpg|thumb|The Memory Gem]]

The Memory Gem is on the edge of the pool of water just below where [[Kol Bruncrag]] was standing. Interact with it to watch a script event play out:
