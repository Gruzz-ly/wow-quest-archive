==Objectives==
Remove the Venture turncoat spies in Gutterville.
*[[Greedy Turncoat]] slain (6)

==Description==
I thought we could talk here in Gutterville, but it feels tense. They're all [[Venture Company]], but I don't recognize a lot of 'em. Word is, [[Gallywix]] sent down a bunch of workers who are sympathetic to him so they could spy on us. 

Clear out some of these turncoats. If any of them report to [[Gozzic Cogcrane|Overseer Gozzic]] that we're working against the pipeline, he'll go after my people.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Silent Strike Leggings]]
* [[Silent Strike Chestguard]]
* [[Silent Strike Gloves]]
* [[Silent Strike Helmet]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The spies are everywhere, I tell ya.

==Completion==
There were more spies than I expected. It's hard to have faith in the Venture Company. But we're not all like that.

==Notes==
[[Greedy Turncoat]]s are located all over the area, and have random gossip, one of:

{{dialogue|
* Mind yer business, there's a good <race>.
* What're you starin' at?
* Who invited you down here, anyway?
* You shouldn't be hangin' around here.

{{gossip|quest=|You're spying for Gallywix, admit it!}}
}}

Followed by one of:
*{{text|say|Greedy Turncoat|Gallywix will pay big if I get rid of you!}}
*{{text|say|Greedy Turncoat|I'm reporting this.}}
*{{text|say|Greedy Turncoat|Info about this'll be worth a big promotion.}}
*{{text|say|Greedy Turncoat|I've got a direct line to Gallywix's ear!}}

After completion, Pamsy has new gossip:
{{dialogue|There's always a way to fix things.}}

Once done, head into the cave for [[Paranoia Prevention]].

==Progression==
{{Trust Issues}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.1.0|note=Added.}}
