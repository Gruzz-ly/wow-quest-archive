==Objectives==
Summon food for [[Innkeeper Brax]] in the [[Gundargaz Inn]].
*[[Conjured Mana Bun]] (60)

==Description==
If you're looking for food--softy food--I'm afraid we're clean out. Nothing but good ol' rocks and gems here at the moment.

It's starting to become a problem, actually.

Say... you wouldn't be able to do anything about that, would you? Rustle us up some victuals for the fleshy folk?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*5,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You don't want to try a nibble of cobalt?

==Completion==
Strike me with a hammer and call me an anvil--that's a lot of food!

==Notes==
Upon conjuring the required amount of buns:
{{Dialogue|{{Gossip|quest=|Here are the buns you asked for.}}}}
:{{Text|say|Innkeeper Brax|Wow! You're like... a machine! But also a vendor? A machine vendor!}}

Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Innkeeper Brax|Have you ever considered vending?}}
