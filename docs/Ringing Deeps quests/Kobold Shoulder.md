==Objectives==
Kill invading [[kobold]]s in the [[Lost Mines]].
* Flickerflame kobolds slain (24)

==Description==
The first step to stemming our losses and retaking the mines is straightforward, if unpleasant. Without minions, this [[The Candle King|Candle King]] will be less of a threat to [[Gundargaz]].

See if you can reduce the swarm, <name>, before hostilities escalate further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This should never have happened.

==Completion==
Grim work, but necessary.

==Notes==
[[File:Kobold Shoulder.jpg|thumb|Flickerflame kobolds]]
Pick up [[Leave No Stone Behind]] and [[Death and Waxes]] before heading out. On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Considering theory: if we depose this Candle King, then perhaps the raids on Gundargaz will cease.}}

Valid targets include: [[Flickerflame Candleflyer]]s, [[Flickerflame Candlekeeper]]s, [[Flickerflame Enforcer]]s, [[Flickerflame Geomancer]]s, [[Flickerflame Kobold]]s, [[Flickerflame Overseer]]s, [[Flickerflame Scrabbler]]s, and [[Flickerflame Sticker]]s.

While killing kobolds, keep an eye out for [[Charmonger]], in a small cave on the eastern wall of the quest area.

On return after completing all quest objectives:
:{{text|say|Skitter|...and that all the ways hygiene effect{{sic}} quality of ear wax!}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|That was certainly an...exhaustive list. I would never have imagined all the uses of mammals' waxy secretions.}}

==Progression==
{{By Candlelight}}
