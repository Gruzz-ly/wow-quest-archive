Pay the toll at the tollbooth, then gather information from the northern goblin camp.
* Speak to [[Tollbooth Entrepreneur]]
* Locate Mining Camp

Lots of these workers are headed to a Venture camp just down the road. That's a great first stop for information. We'll pay the tollbooth fee. It's best to just play along for now.

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
See what these goblins know about the area!

==Completion==
Maybe whoever wanted that wall blown up also wants our attention here. We gotta dig deeper.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|We just want to visit the mining camp.}}
:{{text|say|Tollbooth Entrepreneur|You ain't goin nowhere till ya pay.}}

Speak with the [[Tollbooth Entrepreneur]]:
{{Dialogue|There's lots of business heading to the north Venture mining camps lately. That's big bucks for us.

You wanna go in, you pay the toll. Simple!

{{gossip|quest=|We'd like to go to the mining camp.}}

{{gossip|Why are you letting some of those goblins in without paying?}}

{{dialogue-child|Oh, they've got Darkfuse work badges. We don't upset Darkfuse Enforcement!

Blackwater's got a good thing going on here. If the boss-man ain't picking on us, we ain't gonna upset that apple cart.

{{gossip|Got it.}}}}

{{gossip|I want to haggle about the price.}}

{{dialogue-child|I love to haggle!<br>

But today the price is set. We're still setting up our coupons and deals.}}}}

Pick the quest option to continue:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Uh, here, this should cover us.}}
:{{text|say|Tollbooth Entrepreneur|All paid, move along.}}
:''Monte, Renzik, and Orwenya head east.''

Follow them into the [[Verdant Gutters]] to a small camp where [[Monte Gazlowe]], [[Orweyna]], and [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] have gathered near [[Fazzo Fusebucket]].
:{{text|say|Renzik "The Shiv"|The manager is deflecting. See what the workers know while we distract him.}}

They have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|Usually it's not too hard to find some loose lips among unhappy workers.}}

{{dialogue|title=Orweyna|{{gossip|What do you think of all this chaos?}}

I'm glad Gazlowe and Renzik are here. I'm used to working at a greater distance from people. They seem to thrive in this environment.

{{gossip|Understood.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Fazzo Fusebucket|What do you wanna talk about? I'd much rather chat than work, yanno what I mean?

[[Trella]]'s got trouble at home in Undermine, behind on her rent money. It's a scandal.

[[Ishqikle]] takes naps behind the bomb shed, during work hours.

[[Aberee]] is a tireless worker, it's obnoxious. She's probably after my job.

What else? Some strange <race> is pokin' around our business. Yes, I mean you.}}

{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|I don't want to judge any goblin by who they work for, but when it comes to Darkfuse? We got to.

{{gossip|Can you tell me more about the different goblin cartels?}}

Sure, I can explain the cartels, <name>. They are basically big groups that focus on some specific area of business.

There are four major cartels currently in Undermine. [[Steamwheedle Cartel]], [[Venture Company]], [[Blackwater Cartel]], and [[Bilgewater Cartel]].

[[Darkfuse Enforcement]] is new. They don't seem like a proper cartel. Darkfuse seems more like [[Gallywix]]'s personal enforcers, to me.

{{Gossip|Who are the Bilgewater?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I'm the Bilgewater trade prince right now, so that's the cartel I know the most about. Most folks know us as the engineers and masters of all things that go "boom!" That's pretty accurate, honestly.

Bilgewater has had a rough time of things. Jastor Gallywix was the trade prince just before me. [[Thrall]] asked me to take over after Gallywix abandoned the cartel, and the Horde. See, Gallywix made some bad deals, and didn't want to stick around when the bill came due.

{{Gossip|I'd like to ask about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Who are the Bilgewater? '''(If the player is a [[Goblin (playable)|goblin]])'''}}
{{Dialogue-child|Well, that's who we work for, along with the other goblins in the [[Horde]]. I get the honor of being the trade prince.

Most folks know us as the engineers and masters of all things that go "boom!" That's pretty accurate, honestly. But what do you think?

I know I don't have to tell you the Bilgewater had a rough time of things. Jastor Gallywix was the trade prince just before me. Thrall asked me to take over after Gallywix abandoned the cartel, and the Horde. Gallywix made some bad deals, and didn't want to stick around when the bill came due.

{{Gossip|I'd like to ask about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Who are the Blackwater?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The Blackwater Cartel is led by [[Baron Revilgaz]]. He was the Baron of [[Booty Bay]], and leader of the Blackwater Raiders when they were pirates. Now he's a trade prince and the Blackwater are a cartel focusing on controlling trade and shipping. If it has to do with travel, Blackwater's the crew! 

Revilgaz is a decent guy though, if you don't mind the piracy thing.
{{Gossip|I'd like to ask about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Who are the Venture Company?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The Venture Company is a cartel that prizes profit over everything else, usually. They are mostly into lumber, ore, or any other natural resource they can find. If they can dig it up or cut it down, Venture Company is going to make money off of it. Their drilling and cutting gear ain't half bad either.

I don't know who their leader is right now. It was [[Mogul Razdunk]] for a while, but not anymore. Not after the [[MOTHERLODE!!|Motherlode]] debacle.
{{Gossip|I'd like to ask about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Who are the Steamwheedle?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The Steamwheedle Cartel is where I used to work. You see 'em at [[Gadgetzan]], [[Mudsprocket]], [[Ratchet]], everywhere. They've done everything. These days, they're known for their alchemy, potions, and poison. Selling the best product they can make.

Marin Noggenfogger, a friend of mine, took over as trade prince a while back. He's well known for his Noggenfogger elixirs!
{{Gossip|I'd like to ask about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Can members of cartels change cartels?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Yeah. I used to work for Steamwheedle back in the day. I try and treat my folks fair, but sometimes you get a better deal from the other cartels.

And when another day comes, we can always try to win them back.
{{Gossip|I'd like to ask about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Can members of cartels change cartels? '''(If the player is a goblin)'''}}
{{Dialogue-child|You're not bailing on me, are ya? Hope not, we need sharp goblins like you!

But yeah. I used to work for the Steamwheedle Cartel. Then Thrall asks me if I want to run Bilgewater. How could I turn that down?

I'll try and do right by you, but if another cartel offers ya a good deal, take it.

{{Gossip|I'd like to ask about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Nevermind.}}
}}

Speak with the three other goblins nearby:
{{dialogue|title=[[Trella]]|You don't look like Darkfuse inspectors.

{{gossip|quest=|What can you tell me about the Darkfuse?}}

Darkfuse Enforcement are the security and overseers for this outfit, so they think they can push everyone else around... And they can. 

I'm here to track work hours of the Venture team. Pure admin gig. 

So, excuse me, I've got to get back to work. I just want to finish my contract and bring my cash back to pay my rent in Undermine.

{{gossip|quest=|Thanks for the info.}}}}
:{{text|say|Trella|I just handle the paperwork and try to stay off the Darkfuse radar.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Ishqikle]]|I didn't sign up for this...

{{gossip|quest=|What's the job here?}}

This was a Venture Company mining operation, but now lots of cartels are getting their hands into things. The best jobs are up here in the north. The jobs in the south are the worst, I heard. In the southern work sites, workers just... disappear.

And hazard pay is only an added ten percent! It's awful!

{{gossip|quest=|Thanks for the info.}}}}
:{{text|say|Ishqikle|This is bad, but at least I'm not in the south mines.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Aberee]]|Come to blame me for the wall, too? I inventory the explosives, but I don't decide where they go!

{{gossip|quest=|What happened here?}}

Hey, our job is to get things done, not ask a bunch of questions. Some order came in to blow up the wall. So we did it!

If somebody sent a bogus work order, that's not on us.

{{gossip|quest=|Thanks for the info.}}}}
:{{text|say|Aberee|Somebody wanted a hole in the wall. I dunno who. But it sure wasn't the Darkfuse!}}
