==Objectives==
Slay skardyn and save earthen in the [[Rumbling Wastes]] with [[Moira Thaurissan]].
* [[Fearbreaker]] used (Optional)
* Skardyn slain (0/100%)
* Holdout groups evacuated (4)
*Return to [[Shadowvein Point]] with Moira Thaurissan.

==Description==
The [[skardyn]] have taken over the operations here in the Rumbling Wastes. That's why [[Berrund the Gleaming|Berrund]] thought he needed Fearbreaker.

We're going to finish that job before I take the hammer back to [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]].

What kind of a queen would I be if I wasn't willing tae put myself in danger for the good of others? Let's get in there and save as many as we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We got there in a roundabout way, but we still made a difference in the lives of these earthen.

Berrund, hopefully, has learned a lesson in real heroism. But I suppose we'll see in time.

Now, let's get this over with.

==Notes==
On accept, Moira joins the party:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|You're still going into the Rumbling Wastes? To fight the skardyn?}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Aye.}}

:{{abilities|Fearbreaker|Ask Moira Thaurissan to strike and weaken your skardyn target with Fearbreaker.|range=30|cd=10 sec|notes=Instant|id=435238|icon=inv_mace_1h_fearbreaker_d_01}}

When used, she'll bark one of:
*{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Fearbreaker smite ye!}}
*{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Feel the might o' the Bronzebeard clan!}}
*{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Tremble before the Dark Iron clan!}}

Use it to fill the bar by defeating or healing:
* 3%: [[Skardyn Degenerator]], [[Skardyn Reaver]], [[Injured Earthen (Rumbling Wastes)|Injured Earthen]]
* 5%: [[Skardyn Devastator]]
* 14-15%: [[Voidstone Behemoth]]

Also interact with ghost Fearbreakers near Earthen Holdouts to free them:
:''Moira channels into Fearbreaker near the holdouts, spawning a large bubble shield. Berrund runs up.''
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|This way! Come this way! I'll get you out of here!}}
:''The holdouts flee and Berrund runs after them.''

At other spots:
*{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Yer safe now. Get yerself up tae Shadowvein Point!}}
*{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Go on! Get out o' here, there's refuge at Shadowvein Point!}}
*{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Come with me if you want to survive! Let's get to Shadowvein Point!}}
