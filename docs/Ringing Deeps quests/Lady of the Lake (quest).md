On accept:
:{{text|say|Marline|Here, not bleed all over place.}}

Head downhill to the northeast in the cave to find the [[Lady of the Lake]] swimming in a pool of water. Interact with her to beseech a favor, revealing the lady as a [[kobyss]]! It snags the adventurer, who blacks out, then wakes up in a different cave. The "Lady" is feasting on a [[Questing Knight]] and an [[Unfortunate Goblin]] from the [[Venture Co.]].

Defeat it, then take the Damp Passage Upwards to return to Campalot.
