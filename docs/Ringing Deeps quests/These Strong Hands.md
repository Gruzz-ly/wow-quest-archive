==Objectives==
Witness Moira Thaurissan.
* Witness [[Moira Thaurissan]]

==Description==
<[[Berrund the Gleaming]] coughs dustily.>

I knew I couldn't take the [[skardyn]] without some help. I thought, if I just had that magic hammer, then nothing would stop me. I had to have it, you see, or else, maybe I wasn't who I was made to be.

But it kept slipping out of my fingers. Like it didn't want anything to do with me. It fell out of my hands at the worst moment and now... <He coughs again.>

It's clearly not mine. It never was. I'm... I'm... sorry.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I thought this day would never come because my Da' would never have given me Fearbreaker. He probably would have wanted it to happen a different way.

But I have it now, and I'll make sure it gets back to him safe.

First though, we have unfinished business here.
