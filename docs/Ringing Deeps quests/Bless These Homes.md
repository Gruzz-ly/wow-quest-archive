==Objectives==
Bless the incense around [[Gundargaz]].
* Bless [[Machine Incense|Gundargaz Incense]] (8)

==Description==
Divine presence acknowledged.

Every day for as long as my memory serves me, I have walked the routes and lit the incense around our homes. It has ground my joints to dust, but is it an important task.

A sacred task.

These are dark times we live in--perhaps you could add your own beatitudes to our little rituals?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You do us an honor, bringing your faith into these caverns. Let it bless these machines and those who work with them, just as they bless us in turn.

==Completion==
We are all cogs in the machine. We turn, and turn, and turn...

There is a beauty there.

A quietude.

==Notes==
This quest is exclusive to [[priest]]s and [[paladin]]s.
