{{Dialogue|You ready hear story, tenderfoot?

{{gossip|quest=|Tell me about the day the stoneheads came, Granny Scribbles.}}}}

Another loading screen, this time to the cave of the [[Lost Mines]]. Head south to start the story:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Once was normal day. Candles bright, dirt calm.}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Life go as normal. Good young kobolds help elders. As should!}}

Jump down the pit to pick up [[Softsnout's Favorite Shovel]]:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|When BOOM everything go bad all sudden!}}
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Stoneheads smash into kobold home! Ruin everything!}}

Use the two Stepclimbers to get back out of the pit and [[Stonehead Koboldcrusher]]s and their [[Cogwalker (Ringing Deeps)|Cogwalkers]] are running around killing all the [[Panicking Kobold]]s. [[Stonehead Tribestomper]]s and [[Invading Stonehead]]s are on the ledge and [[Slaughtered Kobold]]s are about as well. Interact with the kobolds, [[Peaceful Home]]s, [[Local Industry]] ([[Krafting Tools]]), [[Life Savings (Ringing Deeps)|Life Savings]] ([[See Where Running Candles]]), [[Gainful Employment]] ([[Run Far Food]]), [[Village Center]] ([[Heirloom Wax]]), and so forth.

At 60%:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|"Kill all rats!" yell stoneheads. "Purge infestation!"  Shoot everyone. Burn everything.}}

At 100%:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|Shoot everyone. Even tenderfoots like you!}}

After the loading screen:
:{{text|say|Granny Scribbles|And that why never trust stoneheads. Err... except new friends. They seem ok.}}
