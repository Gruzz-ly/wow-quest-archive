==Objectives==
Recover Flickerflame Candles from around the [[Lost Mines]].
* [[Flickerflame Candle]] (12)

==Description==
[[Kobold]]s take candles seriously. Wax, even more. More important than gold. More important than freedom!

We steal candles from [[The Candle King|Candle King]]. We make him look weak. Bully that looks weak loses control. Gets dead!

Also means we not have to wait out here in dark until get eaten. Hurry!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Earthen Traveler's Cord]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Waders]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Grips]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Mantle]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you take candle?

==Completion==
<Skitter visibly relaxes in the presence of the candles.>

Ah, good. Now get me out of this!

==Notes==
[[File:Flickerflame Candles.jpg|thumb|[[Flickerflame Candle]]s]]
Pick up [[Leave No Stone Behind]] and [[Kobold Shoulder]] before heading out. On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Considering theory: if we depose this Candle King, then perhaps the raids on Gundargaz will cease.}}

Candles are all over the mine, and kobolds occasionally drop them as well.

On return after completing all quest objectives:
:{{text|say|Skitter|...and that all the ways hygiene effect{{sic}} quality of ear wax!}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|That was certainly an...exhaustive list. I would never have imagined all the uses of mammals' waxy secretions.}}
