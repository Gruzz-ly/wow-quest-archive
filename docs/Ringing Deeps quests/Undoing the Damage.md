==Objectives==
Defend Danagh while he repairs the substation.
* [[Danagh]] defended
*Return to Danagh at Camp Murroch

==Description==
Apologies. [[Foreman Arbauch|Arbauch]] was not here for repairs--he stole [[Corrupted Golem|that golem]].

Arbauch and I worked alongside it for years in the darkest reaches of [[Ringing Deeps|the Deeps]]. The work took its toll on the golem. It became erratic, dangerous even. We planned to decommission it, but when the time came, Arbauch couldn't bear it. He'd become attached. Before it could be destroyed, he took it and fled.

It must be found, but the damage to this substation is catastrophic. With your help, I will attempt repairs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A foreman and a substation lost. Blast. I was careless.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Danagh|[[Titan (language)|[Titan]]] Zekul zenn asj zekul asj raka. Ruk shi, az amir mishun, zar arakal alar lek zar tiros tiros.}} (''Stone hold you while you rest. One day, we will follow, our duties done and our hands empty.'')
:{{text|say|Danagh|If the golem has tainted this terminal, it may be dangerous. Tell me when you're ready.}}

Danagh goes to the terminal in the cave:
{{dialogue|The damage is extensive. I will attempt to restore it. You will deal with whatever comes.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}
}}

:{{text|say|Danagh|Be ready, machines are sensitive. In the Deeps they don't just deteriorate, they fester.}}

Waves of [[Memory Leak]]s and [[Fouled Coolant]]s appear while Danagh attempts to restore the terminal:

:{{text|say|Danagh|No! It's too far gone. I can't-}}

:{{text|say|Danagh|It's beyond repair. I need to think--meet me back at Camp Murroch. I will not fail Arbauch twice.}}
