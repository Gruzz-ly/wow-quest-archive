==Objectives==
Find [[Berrund the Gleaming]] within the [[Rumbling Wastes]].
* Find Cave Entrance
*Find Berrund the Gleaming within the Rumbling Wastes.

==Description==
Berrund took [[Fearbreaker]] for himself. I suppose he thought he could save these people. Be the hero.

But ye can't go about doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.  I know from experience. If a rock is hollow tae begin with, it never can be solid again, no matter how hard ye try.

He's likely tae need saving himself now. Let's find him in this blasted place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Berrund the Gleaming's skin is chipped and damaged. His eyes can barely focus. He is near to death.>

Every time... I tried to use the hammer... it just got away from me. I could have saved people. I don't... I don't...

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|What's happened tae this place?}}

:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|And Berrund thinks he can make things right with one magic hammer. All right. I'll do me best tae help.}}
:''Moira runs off.''

:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Ye bloody thief! Yer lucky we weren't far behind.}}

Moira has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Moira stands straight and tall as she can, her chin high and proud. But she still appears conflicted.>}}

Fearbreaker has gossip too:
{{Dialogue|<Fearbreaker sits solid and heavy on the ground.>

{{gossip|<Try to lift Fearbreaker.>}}

*<Fearbreaker slips politely out of your grasp, dropping back to the ground. It is waiting for someone else.>
*({{Race|Dwarf}}) Fearbreaker respectfully recognizes that you are near to kin. However, it still slips politely out of your grasp, as if it is waiting for someone else.
