==Objectives==
Kill [[Chillgut Slime]]s to collect Chillburst Canisters.
*[[Chillburst Canister]] (12)

==Description==
[[Pamsy]] and I came up with an idea. Since we can't access the controls, and we can't blow it up, what if we freeze the pump station?

Stay with me!

Pamsy mentioned that a lot of the machines up north are overheating lately, because all the coolant is being used down south. And it's even harder to get, because the blood slimes eat it. What if we found all of that coolant supply and dumped it into the pump station?

We put the whole operation on ice, and it'd take ages to fix!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Get enough to freeze this station solid!

==Completion==
Great, that's a good haul!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|Bring the coolant, we'll be ready for it.}}

Before leaving, Pamsy has new gossip:

{{Dialogue|{{Gossip|So, you need coolant?}}

Yeah, bring us twelve canisters of coolant. I've calculated that should be exactly the right amount to imbalance the station, if we apply it in key areas. 

The pressure'll change, and the whole thing will lock up solid!

{{Gossip|I'll get them.}}}}

Head southeast to the quest area at {{co|76.6|97.2|Ringing Deeps}} and kill [[Chillgut Slime]]s to collect Chillburst Canisters. Interact with the valves and canisters to collect more.

On complete of both:
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|This'll be a snap!}}
