'''A Hint of Fear''' begins the optional Fearbreaker chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]], started by [[Moira Thaurissan]] in [[Gundargaz]] after completing the three required campaign chapters.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Moira Thaurissan]] outside [[Camp Murroch]].

==Description==
[[Magni Bronzebeard|My father]] thinks that while he and [[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]] were dealing with the [[skardyn]] tae the south, he caught a sensation o' his old hammer, [[Fearbreaker]].

He said it slipped out o' his fingers when [[Dalaran]] crashed, and it's been bothering him mightily. That hammer belongs tae the [[Bronzebeard clan]], and has for generations. But he hasn't been himself lately, either.

I'm willing tae have a look, so he doesn't worry that he might've missed it. Meet me down at Camp Murroch, and we'll have a quick look around.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well...

I wasn't expecting to actually see Fearbreaker here.

It's really here, but it ain't exactly within easy reach.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I'll meet ye outside of Camp Murroch. Let's see if we can find Fearbreaker after all.}}

Head down to the south. On the way, if players have not completed the [[Pillarstone Spire]] quests, [[Mindi Maxlof]] starts [[An Opportunity to Relax]], and the [[Rusted Lever]] starts [[Rust and Redemption]].

Present characters have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Moira Thaurissan|
Fearbreaker's had a long and storied history with the [[Bronzebeard clan]]. It shouldn't just sit in the mud... or be wielded by weak hands.

{{gossip|What is Fearbreaker?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Fearbreaker's a hammer.

Well, not just any hammer, but the ancestral hammer o' the Bronzebeard clan. It's been wielded in battle both on [[Azeroth]] and on [[Outland]].

But, more importantly, Fearbreaker has its own opinions and feelings on how it should be used. I don't know how my father lost hold of it, but he wasn't at full strength at the time.

Now, tae be clear, I don't want Fearbreaker. I just don't want it tae fall into the wrong hands. We're going to get it back and then return it tae Magni.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Berrund the Gleaming|
The caverns will echo with praise for my deeds.

{{gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
My name is Berrund. I am called "Gleaming" because of how I shine.

I am a hero of great derring-do and renown, you see. Whenever there are problems, I am there to help fix them.

Now, we have a problem here in the [[Ringing Deeps]] with the [[skardyn]], and I intend to do everything I can to root them out. I will use any tool or any method that seems fit for my strong hands.
