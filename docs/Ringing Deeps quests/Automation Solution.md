==Objectives==
Collect metal scrap lying around [[Sanity's Rest|the cave]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]].
* [[Metal Scrap]] (10)

==Description==
As you have probably figured out, [[Black Blood]] exposure is bad for your health. And that's a problem for our operation.<br>
We can't keep replacin' our workers. It's expensive, and it ain't ethical.

So! What's the solution? Replacin' our workers with my fully-automated bots.

These beauties don't get affected by Black Blood exposure. They just dig and haul--precision, efficiency, an' no more sick workers!

I just need more scrap to patch 'em up. You in?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Time is... you know what it is.

==Completion==
Nice! This'll get 'em patched up and good to go!

==Progression==
{{Sanity's Rest}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.1.0|note=Added.}}
