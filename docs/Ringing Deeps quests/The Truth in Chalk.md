==Objectives==
Search for messages in [[Taelloch Mine]].
* First slate found
* Second slate found
* Third slate found
* Fourth slate found

==Description==
So the people of [[Taelloch]] use chalk on slate to leave messages to each other. So many clues! But what does it all mean....

I"m seeing a pattern, and I think it points to the mines. If the workers haven't already been lost, I'd expect them to be in the mines.

And I know [[Kol Bruncrag|the foreman]] is the key. She has to be.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There's more to learn here. I'm sure of it.

==Completion==
I think I know where we need to go next.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Controlled Demolition]] before leaving the safe house.

The slates are marked on the minimap, and the first is south of the house:
{{book|content=Work Shift 81.4

Workers of Taelloch,

As your foreman, I have met with the High Speaker in secret. The outcome was not what I expected.

I have been... altered.

Perhaps even... chosen.

:{{text|say|Kol Brunkrag|The outcome was not what I expected. I have been... altered. Perhaps even... chosen.}}

The second slate is at the western end of the quest area, inside a collapsed mine:
{{book|content=Work Shift 81.5

Change is coming, workers. Hordes of skardyn stir within the Hall of Awakening.

Taelloch could be next. Barricade your doors, but be not afraid. We will press on.

The third is on the south side of the large rock structure at the southern end of [[Taelloch Mine]]:
{{book|content=Work Shift 81.6

Workers, the circle has turned.

Can you hear it? The ringing... the ringing... the music is eternal.

My mind is sane because the water flows through the ages.

The itching... it itches... I can taste the sounds. Revelation awaits.

The fourth is to the northeast:

{{book|content=The RINGING... the RINGING...

Will lock away. Deepest cavern for darkest memory.

Don't... Speaker... RINGING. Don't let destroy.}}
:{{text|say|Kol Brunkrag|The RINGING! The RINGING! Will lock away... deepest cavern for darkest memory.}}
