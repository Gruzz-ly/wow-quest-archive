==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Glintwick.jpg|Glintwick|Crowned with a candle whose wick is studded with stolen jewels, Glintwick's eyes gleam with a greedy lust for gems.}}

Kill [[Glintwick]].
* [[Unfaceted Purple Gemstone|Collect the final gem]]

==Description==
[[Waterworks Gem-Thief|The kobold]] mentioned Glintwick, did he? It sounds like she's the driving force behind these gem thieves. I'll bet my beard she's got Ausgazur's last gem!

Look for her in the Waterworks and see if she has the final gem. She may also be behind the attack that's happening, so taking her out will help the defenders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*10,850 [[XP]]
*[[Batzvara's Gratitude]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Assembly of the Deeps]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Glintwick will not get away with this thievery!

==Completion==
You did it! You found the last gem! I'm glad that Glintwick will no longer be after Ausgazur's gems.

This particular gem was his favorite. It's not faceted, like the rest. Ausgazur could always find the beauty in flawed things. He would show me this one and marvel at its hue and potential. He never wanted it buffed or shined.

<She's silent a moment, then looks at the gray earthen beside her.>

Ah, Ausgazur. You never cared what I looked like either. You saw my potential. I miss you, friend.

==Notes==
Find [[Glintwick]] inside what would be the inn.

On completion of both:
:{{text|say|Batzvara|Here you are, my friend. May your sight be filled with their beauty once more.}}
:''Batzvara walks up to Ausgazur and places the recovered gems in his outstretched hand.''

Completing the quest awards the "The Caretaker of Brunwin's Terrace" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
