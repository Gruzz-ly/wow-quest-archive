==Objectives==
Collect 4 pieces of [[krolusk]] meat.
*[[Juicy Krolusk Meat]] (4)

==Description==
Greetings! I am [[Kagfritha]]. I was once a site supervisor for operations in the [[Rumbling Wastes]] to the south of here, but time has taken its toll on our enterprise and we had to abandon the area.

It's high time we got things back in working order down there, but while we were gone some unsavory creatures moved in. I have a plan for dealing with the worst of the bunch, but first we need some bait.

If you're here to help, go hunt some of those dirt diving [[krolusk]]s and bring me back their meat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|17|55}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have big plans for that krolusk meat, and for the Rumbling Wastes!

==Completion==
Ah, these juicy hunks of flesh are exactly what I need!

==Notes==
[[Sticks and Bones]] becomes available immediately after picking up this quest.

After accept, she has gossip:
{{dialogue|The [[Rumbling Wastes|Rumbling Waste]] was once a thriving mining operation. It pains me to see how much has been lost.

How many of us have been lost.}}

Pick it up, then get to killing [[Waste Krolusk]]s for their [[Juicy Krolusk Meat]].

==Progression==
{{Revenge in the Rumbling Wastes}}
