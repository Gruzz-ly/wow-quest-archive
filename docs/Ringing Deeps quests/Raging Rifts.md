==Objectives==
Destroy 4 rifts and find their source within the cave.
* Defeat [[Elemental Rift (Ringing Deeps)|Elemental Rifts]] (4)
*Enter the Cave
* Destroy Rift Source

==Description==
The [[elemental]]s are coming from inside that cave. We only made it part of the way in before needing to retreat.

I could see some flickering within, some strange glowing thing that looked almost like a tear in space from which the elementals poured forth! We managed to close one of these portals, but there are more.

I need to stay with [[Nanthaz]]. It is up to you now, if you can manage. Destroy the rifts and find their source. I suspect it lies deeper within the cave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*13,600 [[XP]]
*[[Band of Elemental Chaos]]
*{{Warband bonus|repitem=The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation|repamount=500|faction=Assembly of the Deeps|altqty1=25|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
Destroy what rifts you come across, but above all, find their source! I suspect you will find it deep inside the nearby cave.

The miners you rescued spoke of breaking through to a crystal-filled room, and of the elementals pouring forth from within.

==Completion==
You return with good news, I hope? 

<You tell her about Urthgrafr Riftcaller.>

With Urthgrafr's defeat, we should have no problem cleaning up the rest of the elementals and rifts ourselves. We are lucky that you came along when you did.

Thank you for your help, friend. Do not worry about me or Nanthaz. We will make our way back to the refinery once he has caught his breath. Gratitude, outlander. And may all earthen Awaken one day.
