'''Sanity's Rest''' begins the optional Sanity's Rest storyline of [[Sojourner of Undermine]], starting at the [[Writhing Fields]] in southeastern [[Ringing Deeps]]. This questline awards Explorer 1 legs and +200 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]].

==Objectives==
Carry the Incapacitated Worker inside the cave in the [[Ringing Deeps]].
* Incapacitated Miner picked up
* Incapacitated Miner taken to [[Stitchoaf]]

==Description==
Looks like another one down the hatch, huh?

I'm tellin' ya, these [[Black Blood]] dig sites are chewin' up workers faster than I can hire 'em! Every day, one of my guys goes down with the shakes, sproutin' nonsense about seein' tentacles in the dirt...

Take 'em to see my guy, Stitchoaf, in the cave over there. He's brewin' up some kinda "cure."

See if he can't help this poor guy out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I'm already short. I mean, short-handed!

==Completion==
That's the third one today.

Gettin' worse out there.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Benny Gooserocket|Hey! A little help here.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Benny Gooserocket|Get him outta here. I don't want anyone else thinkin' they can lay around on the job.}}

Pick up the worker and take the goblin inside the [[Sanity's Rest]] cave and place it at the marked spot:
:{{text|say|Stitchoaf|Anotha' one? Just toss 'em over there, will ya?}}

==Progression==
