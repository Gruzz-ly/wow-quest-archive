==Objectives==
Find the foreman.
* Cave explored
* [[Kol Bruncrag|Foreman]] confronted

==Description==
[[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]] was right. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by that any longer.

All the signs suggest there's something in this cave. Maybe the foreman is hiding here. Maybe she can give us some answers.

We've come this far. Let's see what's inside.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Earthen Traveler's Cuffs]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Bindings]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Bracers]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Armplates]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There must be answers deeper within the cave.

==Completion==
That was her. The foreman. It had to be. After all that... she was already gone.

==Notes==
Head past the blockage and up the ramp to spot [[Kol Bruncrag]], heavily transformed into a [[skardyn]].
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Is that... the foreman? You were right, lad.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Come on! We can't let that thing out of this cave!}}

Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Kol Bruncrag|... infection...}}

At 50%:
:{{text|say|Kol Bruncrag|... remorse...}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|We were... too late. How many times have I been too late?}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Wait, Gran'da! Look in the water. I think that's a memory gem.}}
