[[File:Controlled Demolition.jpg|thumb|An [[Unstable Skardyn]] fighting a [[Fog Wither]]]]

==Objectives==
Kill 18 skardyn in [[Taelloch]]
* [[Skardyn]] slain (18)

==Description==
I know we've fought skardyn before, champion, but this... this is worse. 

I knew that skardyn were turning earthen into more skardyn, but I didn't expect... the crystals... the spikes... the roiling blue energy... that smell! Anyway, not what I expected at all. 

If we must venture out there, I'm taking down some of those abominations along the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Earthen Traveler's Shawl]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Cloak]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There's more to be done. We can't let this corruption spread.

==Completion==
Maybe we've only killed a few skardyn from a much larger swarm. But we have to start somewhere.

==Notes==
On accept, Magni and Dagran rejoin the party. Pick up [[The Truth in Chalk]] before leaving the safe house.

Get to killing enemies with a suspiciously void-filled kit, including [[Corrupted Spellshaper]]s, [[Corrupted Voidfinder]]s, [[Cursed Miner]]s, [[Hijacked Ironstrider]]s, [[Reconstructed Skardyn]], [[Skardyn Husk]]s, [[Skardyn Hauler]]s, [[Unstable Skardyn]], and [[Voidtouched Speaker]]s.

==Progression==
{{Dark Revelations Ringing Deeps}}
