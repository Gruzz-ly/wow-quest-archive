'''Into the Deeps''' begins the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]].

==Objectives==
Find [[Speaker Brinthe]] at the bottom of the [[Coreway]].

==Description==
Onward and downward it is, then. We'd best follow after Speaker Brinthe and see what state the [[nerubian]]s have left her home in.

[[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]], [[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]], and [[Moira Thaurissan|I]] will accompany you down in due time. Would you mind roving ahead and making sure there's a warm welcome awaiting us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|85}}
*2,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
By the [[Titan]]s! It looks like the nerubians did a number on [[Ironhaul Station|our station]]... but I see no spidery fiends here. Only struggling [[Machine Speakers]]...

==Notes==
Upon accept, Moira has a new dialogue:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Dagran, are ye ready to go down? Ye dunnae have to. Ye can stay at the Archive if ye like.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|No, ma. I've learned so much here. The world seems so new... an' old at the same time.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Good. I did nae want ye to be in danger, but I'm glad to see adventuring suits ye.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Ye have always had a knack for history--and culture. I already think of ye as an advisor.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Really? Sometimes ye will ask me questions... and if I am excited about what ye ask me, I can talk for hours...}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Hours? I'd listen to ye for days. I may nae be impartial since ye are me son, but ye have a fine mind.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Ye are the future of our people, and ye have a lot to offer this world--dunnae let anyone tell ye different.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|There's nobody else I'd rather crash a city, meet new peoples, and jump down a dark hole with.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Thank ye, ma. I... dunnae know what to say other than... I'm excited to see what we discover--together.}}

At the bottom of the Coreway, on approach:
:{{text|say|[[Foreman Uzjax]]|Speaker Brinthe, the [[High Speaker Eirich|High Speaker]] has the situation under control.}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Under control? The station is in ruins!}}
