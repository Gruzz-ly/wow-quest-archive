==Objectives==
Meet [[Batzvara]] in [[Shimmermist Falls]].

==Description==
Assigned tasks complete! I'll check back on these folks on my next scheduled patrol.

There is one more earthen I must tend to today. He was... he is very special to me.

You've been an especially considerate colleague, so I'd like for you to see him. Let us travel west a bit, closer to the falls.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|85}}
*2,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You made it!

<She looks at the outstretched hand of [[Ausgazur|the earthen next to her]] and sighs.>

I admit that I am quite disturbed by what I've found here. Your presence is a comfort.
