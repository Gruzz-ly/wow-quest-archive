==Objectives==
Defeat enemy [[Machine Speakers]], constructs, and help frightened workers in the [[Earthenworks]]!
* Fight [[High Speaker Eirich|The High Speaker]]'s followers in The Earthenworks (0/100%)

==Description==
<Name>! There's a battle afoot! We need to assist [[Machine Speakers]] loyal to our cause and move against anyone defending the High Speaker.

I'm going to remain and make plans with [[Adelgonn]]. I need you to lead our forces while we're containing consequences of the High Speaker's actions in the Earthenworks. This is our first step in deposing him. We're putting a stop to his horrendous crimes once and for all. 

What do you say, <name>? Up for a scrap?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Earthen Traveler's Leggings]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Vest]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Greaves]]
* [[Earthen Traveler's Helm]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'll admit: the ability to acquire an army at the drop of a hat has gotten me fairly far in life.

==Completion==
You've managed to drive out some of the High Speaker's most devoted disciples... and you've cracked some heads.

That's a fine start. But there's so many... too many...

==Notes==
Fill the bar by defeating, freeing, or destroying:
* 2%: [[Dogmatic Machine Speaker]]s, [[Swarming Cogwalker]]s
* 3%: [[Dogmatic Forgecaster]]s
* 4%: [[Assembly Worker]]s, [[Dogmatic Soot-Seer]]s
* 5-6%: [[Broken Machinery]]
* 7-8%: [[High Speaker's Construct]]s
* 10%: [[Earthenwork Ironstrider]]s

When rescuing [[Assembly Worker]]s, they will say one of the following lines:
*{{text|say|Assembly Worker|When I said I didn't want to help, they attacked!}}
*{{text|say|Assembly Worker|They're destroying our machines!}}
*{{text|say|Assembly Worker|Madness! This is madness!}}
*{{text|say|Assembly Worker|Why would the High Speaker do this?}}

==Progression==
{{The Monster and the Machine}}
