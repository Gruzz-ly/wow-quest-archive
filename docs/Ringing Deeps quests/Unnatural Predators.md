==Objectives==
Kill Deepflayer Hunters.
* [[Deepflayer Hunter]] slain (8)

==Description==
It would be no use tagging fog beasts to study if they all were to die, would it? 

Could you clear out some of the aggressive [[deepflayer]]s that have flocked to feast on the [[fog beast]]s?

They'll ruin my data if left unchecked, I'm sure of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you taken out the deepflayers?

==Completion==
Thank you. A researcher's duty is  to not interfere with nature, but... I only have so many trackers.

I can't risk losing them to a bored, murderous deepflayer. No other reasons certainty{{sic}}. Hehe!

==Notes==
[[File:Unnatural Predators.jpg|thumb|Six [[Deeplayer Hunter]]s]]
[[Fog Wither]]s and [[Deepflayer Hunter]]s are just to the north, no need to enter [[Taelloch]].
