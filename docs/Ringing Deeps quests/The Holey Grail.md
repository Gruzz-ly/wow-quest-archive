*{{trainer|Please teach me how to fish.}}

Had one, but go missing one day. Kept my best worms in it.

Imagine fish took.

If want, try them. Punch fish, catch fish, can keep if find.

I teach you how catch fish, if want.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}
*{{gossip|You seem injured. Are you ok?}}

Stupid fish eat anything fit in mouth. Try me! Regret it.

Will be fine, but appreciate you ask.
