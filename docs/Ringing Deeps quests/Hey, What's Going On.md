==Objectives==
Search for clues by questioning goblins and uncovering evidence in the [[Abyssal Excavation]].
*Question Harried Workers (4)
*[[Used Fuel Drum]] examined (6)
*Find [[Renzik "The Shiv"|Renzik]]

==Description==
Time to do some networking.

There's a bunch of goblins outside of [[Opportunity Point]], over there in the [[Abyssal Excavation]]. I heard some of them grumbling as they started their shift.

Let's see what some friendly words shake loose.

While you're out there, check out the used fuel drums, They wouldn't let me look inside the full drums, but they just stop the used ones around the work site.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We've got to stop meeting like this. Assuming we've met before, which, maybe we have.

==Completion==
Those goblins only know part of the story. What's in there is the full story, or at least, a big piece that's missing.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Keep an eye out for anything odd while you ask around. There's more here than they're letting on.}}

Go to the [[Abyssal Excavation]]. Interact with the [[Used Fuel Drum]] and it blows up.

Ask the Harried Workers about what is happening.
Each of them has a gossip
{{dialogue|Look, they promisted if I could figure out how to get this all going, I would get promoted to foreman!

{{gossip|quest=|What's going on?}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Harried Worker|That new fuel is causing all sorts of problems. We didn't get hazard pay for experiments!}}
:''Monte Gazlowe appears''
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Huh, interesting. Eh, keep asking around, and I'll do the same. Keep your eyes open.}}

The 2nd harried Goblin appears near the ledge.
{{dialogue|I was the top of my class when it comes to mechanical innovation. And this is not what I expected.

{{gossip|quest=|Hey, what's going on?}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Harried Worker|If you really want to know what's going on... The foreman keeps all the orders in his office.}}

The 3rd  harried Goblin is near the stairs.
{{dialogue|This ain't worth it! I didn't sign up for crazy machines.

{{gossip|quest=|Hey, what's going on?}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Harried Worker|You want to know what the drilling's about? Buddy, it's bigger than you can imagine!}}

The 4th  harried Goblin is near the lamp in the hill.
{{dialogue|Between you and me, I'm just here until overtime kicks in. But's I'm staring to reconsider.

{{gossip|quest=|Hey, what's going on?}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Harried Worker|I wanted less work for more pay, instead I got busted machines and overtime! Who runs a site like this?}}

Go to the structure where [[Renzik "The Shiv"|Renzik]] is on the roof.
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Psst! You're like an ogre in [[Gnomeregan]], asking questions and breaking things. Get over here.}}

Renzik's gossip:
{{Dialogue|Fancy meeting you out here.

{{Gossip|Why is SI:7 here?}}

{{Dialogue-child|Just because I work for Stormwind Intelligence doesn't mean everything I do is for the Alliance. These goblins are getting mixed up in some shady stuff. Someone has to look out for them.}}
