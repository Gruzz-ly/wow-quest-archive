[[File:Fog Follower.jpg|thumb|[[Noli Marlen]] and the fog trail]]

==Objectives==
Help Noli find the source of the fog beasts with her mist tracking ability.
* Find and follow the fog trail
* [[Noli Marlen|Noli]] followed
* Photo taken

==Description==
With the trackers attached, we should be able to find out where the fog beasts are coming from. The trackers leave a residue in the air. It's invisible to the naked eye, but I can use the mists to reveal it in places where there's a high enough concentration.

Theoretically, this should lead us to the places they most frequent. Maybe a nest! That I'll then have to report to my employer... hm.

Anyway. Let's see what we can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
*{{wb|repitem=The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation|repamount=500|faction=The Assembly of the Deeps|qty=180|currency=Resonance Crystals|altqty1=205|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
I know we'll be able to find them. Let's keep looking!

==Completion==
Wow. I mean, wow! We learned so much in so little time! But now, I'm supposed to report this to people who want them gone?

I think people are wrong about the fog beasts. They don't attack unless threatened. And even when we entered their nest, they teleported us away safely.

We haven't even had time to talk about the fact that they can do that kind of magic! Amazing!

==Notes==
[[File:Fog Follower - Noli and the fog nest.jpg|thumb|[[Noli Marlen]], [[Noli's Camera|her camera]], and a nest of [[Fog Form]]s, [[Fog Sower]]s, and [[Fog Wither]]s]]

On accept, Noli joins the party and will follow the player:
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|Okay! Use the fog tracer and it should reveal any residue left behind by the fog beasts.}}

Use the provided extra action button:
:{{abilities|Fog Tracer|Reveals nearby traces left by the fog beasts.|cd=1.5 sec|id=443970|icon=ability_monk_pathofmists}}
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|Wow! Right under my nose! We have to follow the trail. Keep using the fog tracer to reveal more.}}

As you follow the trail:
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|I expected the fog beasts to be hostile to you, but they weren't.}}
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|I had a feeling their reputation was only correlation.}}

The trail leads down into the [[Living Grotto]], but stops at water's edge:
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|Hmm. Looks like the traces stop at the water's edge. I guess the water washed away the residue. Maybe check the other side of the river?}}

Hop across the river a few times while spamming the Fog Tracer to the west down the trail to [[Azj-Kahet]].
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|Look! It goes off the cliff and around the corner here. We'll have to fly to follow it. Come on!}}
:''Noli flies off.''

Follow her clockwise to the west to come across a nest of [[Fog Form]]s, [[Fog Sower]]s, [[Fog Wither]]s, and [[Fog Drogher]]s:
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|It's them! I've never seen so many in one place! This must be their nest. But how are they traveling from here to the rest of the Deeps?}}
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|Quickly, <name>. And quietly! We have to take a photo.}}

Interact with [[Noli's Camera]] to take the shot, but the flash was on:
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|Oh no! I forgot the flash was on!}}
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|Please, we mean no harm! Don't hurt us!}}
:''The screen fades to white. On the other side of a loading screen, the player and Noli are 100 yards up above a pond in the [[Ancient Falls]], just south of [[Camp Murroch]].
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!}}
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|...Huh.}}
:''Noli swims to shore.''
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|We're... outside Camp Murroch. They could have killed us. But they didn't.}}
:''She runs uphill in the direction of camp.''
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|Let's dry off at the camp, then we'll talk.}}

Catch up with Noli inside the inn (say hi to the [[Shoeduck]]! It's a duck! It has shoes!) and warm up.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|You know, I've been thinking...}}
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|It's a real shame we weren't able to find out where the fog beasts are coming from. Right, <name>?}}
:{{text|say|Noli Marlen|I guess we'll just have to learn to live with them.}}

Completing the quest awards the "Into the Fog" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
