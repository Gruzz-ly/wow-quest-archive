==Objectives==
Meet up with [[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]] and [[ZZ-01-47]] at the [[Waterworks]].

==Description==
Getting the Waterworks up and running is our first objective. Nothing else we do matters if we can't get power to the facility.

Meet up with Dagran and ZZ-01-47 once you get there. And try to keep them on the sidelines. I don't want to explain to [[Moira Thaurissan|Moira]] that her son was injured, or worse, under my care.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This place is a mess! I think Zee-Zee and I will stay up here where it's dry.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Zee-Zee and I will meet you at the Waterworks, <name>.}}
:''Dagran and Zee-Zee run out.''

Catch up with them in a safe spot at the Waterworks to the southwest:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|More titan tech! It wasn't built to last forever, but it sure came close. I know we can fix this.}}
