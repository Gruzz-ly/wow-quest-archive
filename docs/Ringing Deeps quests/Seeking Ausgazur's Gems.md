==Objectives==
Recover 4 of [[Ausgazur]]'s gems.
*[[Gem of Ausgazur]] (4)

==Description==
So it was [[kobold]]s who made off with Ausgazur's gems. I did not realize the Waterworks was under attack. Our timing is lucky for the defenders down below!

We must get those jewels back! I'll stay here and guard the remaining gems, but I implore you to complete a critical task: go down into the Waterworks and retrieve the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to find the rest of Ausgazur's gems! Critical priority!

==Completion==
Excellent work! Though they're not worth much monetarily, these gems meant a great deal to Ausgazur. I am glad he will not be parted from them any longer.

==Notes==
