==Objectives==
Collect 100 Missing Pages of [[Brennok]]'s book.
* [[Missing Page]] (100)

==Description==
My oath is to be a compiler. I collect and tell the stories of our people.

<Brennok sighs.>

Is there wisdom in stories told by someone who never lived them? I've never had an adventure. I was afraid to overwrite the stories entrusted to me.

So I started transcribing them into a book I hid here. Each time we returned to [[Shadowvein Point]], I added more.

I was going to leave and pass on the book, but [[scorpid]]s ransacked it. Please, find the missing pages before they stuff them into their nests.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Thousands of stories, now they're probably lining some animal's den...

==Completion==
By the [[Titan]]s, thank you! I don't know what I would have done if I'd lost these.

I can finally leave without failing my oath.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brennok|I won't be like the [[Unbound]]. My stories are my oath, and they must be passed on. I need my book whole.}}

Kill [[Scavenging Swarmer]]s, [[Shadowsting Scavenger]]s, and interact with [[Suspicious Rock]]s to spawn more scorpids. They carry 3-13 pages.
