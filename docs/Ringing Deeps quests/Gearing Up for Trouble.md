Speaker Kuldras gossip in Gundargaz:
{{dialogue|
Speaker Kuldas at your service! The Machines talk to us all, but I make 'em sing. If something breaks, Kuldas will fix it. There's no gear too large nor cog too small that I can't restore it to working order. It's a shame there's only one of me!

That being said, I'm quite busy these days.

{{Gossip|Let's go do some maintenance! {{text|rare|<Awakening The Machine.>}}}}
}}

This will send the player to the [[Awakening The Machine]] scenario in the [[Ritual Hall]] within the [[Halls of Awakening]], speak to Kuldras there:

{{dialogue|class=plainlist|
Ah, the Halls of Awakening! She's certainly dragging her feet after her slumber these past few eons. Let's give her a tune up. shall we?

These ancient machines have a mind of their own. and don't always react to our rituals in ways that are... pleasant. Things might get a little hot in here!

*{{Gossip|I'm ready to continue.}}
*{{Gossip|I'm ready for a challenge, Kuldas.}}
*{{Gossip|What are we doing here?}}
{{dialogue-child|
A fair question, <race>. I'm an Awakener--it's my duty to go into these old places, or newly awakened ones, and make sure that everything is in working order. Think of the Ringing Deeps like one great slumbering giant. I make  sure she's taken care of!

Protect me while I concentrate on my ritual. and try to absorb as much of the Machine's nascent energy as you can! If we can get charged up enough. we should be able to see it through to the end...
}}
{{Gossip|I'd like to leave.}} (Brings the player back to Gundargaz.)
}}

The objective is to keep Speaker Kuldras alive for as long as you can while he conducts the Rites of Awakening. Enemies come in waves, every 5th wave completed provides a reward upgrade. 
A Challenge mode was added in [[patch 11.1]] with no breaks after every 5 Waves and faster enemy spawn rates.

When you are ready to continue:
:{{text|say|Speaker Kuldas|Watch my back while I commune with the machine, <name>!}}

Every 5th wave, Kuldas stops and says:
:{{text|say|Speaker Kuldas|Let me know when you're ready to continue.}}

If you fail to defend Kuldas before all the waves are done:
:{{text|say|It's getting too hot. We're getting out of here!}}
