'''Down Undermine''' concludes the "Trust Issues" chapter of the [[Undermine(d) campaign]]. The second chapter of the campaign, "Undermine Awaits", begins with the direct followup: [[Welcome to Undermine]].

After the first character on the account completes this quest, all other characters have instant access to repeatable content in Undermine, such as world quests and public objectives.

==Objectives==
Talk with [[Gazlowe]], then go to [[Undermine]] using the rocket drill.
*Speak to Gazlowe
*Ride [[Pamsy's Rocketboard]] (Optional)
*[[Stelliya|Rocket Drill]] used {{co|77.1|73.2|Ringing Deeps}}
*Find Gazlowe in Undermine

==Description==
We've done what we could here. It's time to get a look at Undermine.

[[Pamsy]]'s got a contact, a Venture goblin named [[Grimla Fizzlecrank|Grimla]]. We can start there when we arrive.

Let's get Gazlowe and get going. Undermine's not the kinda problem you solve with a knife. We need someone like Gazlowe on board for this. You know, the builder and leader type.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +750 reputation with [[The Cartels of Undermine]]

==Completion==
I hope Renzik and Pamsy know what they're doin' with Grimla here.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Monte Gazlowe]]:
{{Dialogue|If Pamsy has access, we get our friends out of Undermine and be home before you know it.

{{Gossip|quest=|Renzik has another idea.}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Gallywix can't be trusted with something like Black Blood.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|It looks like we got business in Undermine.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|You got business in Undermine.}}
:''[[Pamsy]] walks up into her Rocketboard storage.''
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I ain't ever going back there.}}
:''Renzik walks up to Gazlowe.''
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I thought you were the one who wanted to build a better world for goblins.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Any goblin who wants a better world has already left Undermine, like we did.}}
:''Gazlowe sighs''
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Look, maybe we can get some others out.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|It's their home. They shouldn't HAVE to leave!}}
:''Renzik turns around.''
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I gave up everything when I left.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Family, friends...}}
:''Renzik turns to Gazlowe.''
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I won't make anyone else do that.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Alright, alright. We'll take a look around.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|But I'm not going there to start a war.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Don't worry... that's my job.}}
:''Renzik summons a Rocketboard and takes off for the Undermine. Gazlowe follows him shortly after.''
:{{Text|Say|Pamsy|Ride the rocketboard if you want, or meet me up by the rocket drill. I'll get ya into Undermine!}}

Board [[Pamsy's Rocketboard]] or use a flying mount and fly north to the [[Gutterside Rocket Station]] where Pamsy is talking with [[Stelliya]]:
:{{Text|Say|Pamsy|I got your papers, just tell her you're with me.}}

[[Pamsy]] and Stelliya have gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Pamsy|I'm not going to Undermine now. I want to make sure I'm not leaving anyone behind. I'll catch up with you soon, though.

I sent word to my friend Grimla Fizzlecrank. She'll help you out!}}

{{Dialogue|title=Stelliya|Got the proper papers for Undermine?

{{Gossip|quest=|Of course. Let's go!}}}}

Stelliya has alternate dialogue for [[Goblin (playable)|goblin players]]:
{{Dialogue|Wow, is that a Kezan accent? That takes me back!

Got the proper papers for Undermine?

{{Gossip|quest=|Of course. Let's go!}}}}

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|qRbQ6307QcA|Down Undermine}}
:''The Rocket Drill begins to start its engines as the other goblins flee. The Rocket Drill takes off!''

[[File:Down Undermine - after.jpg|thumb|In Undermine with [[Orweyna]], [[Monte Gazlowe]], [[Renzik "The Shiv"]], [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]], and [[Gramps]]]]
On the other side of the cutscene, the [[adventurer]] has arrived at [[Undermine]] at [[Slam Central Station]]. Head east out the station to where [[Gazlowe]], [[Renzik]], and [[Orweyna]] are meeting [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]], leaning against [[Gramps]]:
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Hey! Over here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Pamsy sent word about what happened in the Ringing Deeps. I'm here ta get you reacquainted with Undermine.}}

Walking past an [[Impatient Traveler]]:
:{{Text|Say|Impatient Traveler|Hey. Watch where yer walkin'!}}
:{{Text|yell|Impatient Traveler|Move it, I'm late!}}
:{{Text|Say|Impatient Traveler|In Undermine, we walk around people, not through 'em.}}
:{{Text|Say|Impatient Traveler|Tourists.}}

Several characters have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Orweyna|This Undermine is very unsettling, but It must be where my visions were leading me.}}
{{dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|We've been betrayed before, but I got a good feeling about Grimla if Pamsy's vouching for her.}}
{{dialogue|title=Grimla Fizzlecrank|Undermine's somethin' you gotta experience y'self.}}
{{dialogue|title=Grimla Fizzlecrank (If the player is a goblin)|You're from Kezan? You ever see footbomb games there? I heard they got wild.}}
{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|It's the same old Undermine. Still, something feels... off.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I ain't been in Undermine in so long. I could use the help. What about you Gazlowe?}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|It hasn't been long enough.}}
