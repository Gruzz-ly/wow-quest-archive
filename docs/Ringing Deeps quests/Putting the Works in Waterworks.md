==Objectives==
Get the [[Waterworks]] running again.
* Waterwheels Activated (2) {{co|48.4|46.1|Ringing Deeps}} {{co|45.4|46.4|Ringing Deeps}}
* Delve Entered {{co|46.3|48.5|Ringing Deeps}}
* Delve Completed
* Waterworks Restored

==Description==
Overly-enthusiastic [[kobold]]s, angry [[elemental]]s, and a broken-down power plant. This place is in shambles!

Do you spot those large wheels on each side? They should be moving, but they're not. We'll need to get those moving again if we want this place to come back to life.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I wonder if we could use this technology to rebuild the Stonewrought Dam? Wouldn't that be something.

==Completion==
Wowiee look at it go! 

Just a fraction of Azeroth's power, harnessed for its protection.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Nothing a little hard work can't fix. We make a good team... you and me and [[Zee-Zee]].}}

Dagran has gossip too:
{{dialogue|When machinery breaks down, when titan artifacts are uncovered, when there's a code to decipher or security to breach, I'm supposed to drop everything else I'm doing and find an ingenious solution.

And I love it. Bring me a puzzle, and I'll find a solution.}}

Destroy the wax on the two marked consoles:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Hrm, the hydraulic system has located an obstruction within the plant. It's in the main drain.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|You'll have to enter the dam and manually remove the obstruction. Be careful. I suspect you won't be the only one in there.}}

Enter and complete the [[Waterworks (Ringing Deeps)|Waterworks]] delve. See that article for a full walkthrough.

After defeating the final boss, look for a clogged grate in the water, and pull on the vine to clear it:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Good news! The drainage system is reading clear across the board.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Have you considered a fulfilling role in sanitation? You wouldn't believe what happens in Ironforge during Brewfest.}}

After the delve, return to Dagran and interact with the Waterworks Primary Activation console next to him:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Back in action! With my brains and your brawn, we're bringing this ancient facility back to life.}}

==Progression==
{{The Machines March to War}}
