'''Broken Memories''' starts from a [[Faded Memory Gem]] found on the corpse of a [[Fallen Earthen]] that players are looking for in [[Leave No Stone Behind]] in the [[Lost Mines]] of [[Ringing Deeps]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Faded Memory Gem to [[Speaker Brinthe|Brinthe]].
*[[Faded Memory Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
Something about this particular gemstone feels important. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to bring it to Speaker Brinthe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|17|55}}
*8,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Earthen]] use these gems to hold memories we would otherwise lose to the unrelenting march of time.

When an earthen goes into stasis, we sometimes use a memory gem to witness their final moments.

During our lives, we use them to carry our precious memories to the Archive, where they can be stored. Then we recharge our bodies and renew our minds in the [[Awakening Machine]].

Thank you for returning this, <name>. Even shattered and faded, it's still precious.
