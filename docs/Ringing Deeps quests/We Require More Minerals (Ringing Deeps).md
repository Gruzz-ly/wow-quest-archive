[[ZZ-01-47|Zee-Zee]] is ready to help you get the Shadowvein site up and running again.

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
<Zee-Zee emits an inquisitive beep.>

==Completion==
<Zee-Zee whistles in relief. It seems they were not happy with the subpar maintenance standards here.>

==Notes==
On accept, Zee-Zee projects an image of Dagran:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Based on Zee-Zee's initial findings, it looks like none of the crushers are receiving power.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Check the nearby power substation and see if something's amiss.}}

Head north into the [[Shadowvein Power Station]] and interact with the Power Substation Console:
:''Zee-Zee looks at a large device.''
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Hmm, power isn't reaching the main delivery conduit.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Look around in the substation. You may need to reroute the power piping nearby.}}

West into the pipe room:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|With these pipes in tatters, the water can't reach the boilers!}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|If those valves are opened in the correct sequence, they should reroute the water to the working line.}}

Three sets of Valves light up. Interact with them in turn: middle, bottom, top. Then interact with the Power Substation Console again:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Power is on! It's spreading to machines and buildings all over the facility. Let's deal with those seized crushers next.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Zee-Zee's arc emitter should be able to help with those crushers.}}

Players gain an extra action button:
:{{abilities|Arc Emitter|ZZ-01-47 activates her arc emitter to free Crushers from attached muck.|notes=Instant|id=437962|icon=spell_lightning_lightningbolt01}}

Outside, look for [[Infested Crusher]]s (marked on the minimap), and use the extra action button near them to knock out some [[Infested Discharge]]. Also find the trapped mine cart in the southeast, blocked by some rubble.
