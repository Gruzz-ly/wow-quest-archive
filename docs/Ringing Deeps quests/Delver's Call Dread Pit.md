==Objectives==
Complete the [[Dread Pit]] [[delve]] on any difficulty.
*The Dread Pit delve completed on any difficulty

==Description==
Two things are bad for business. Earnest competition and [[nerubian]]s. We need someone to deal with the latter!

We lost a bunch of workers to nerubians in a cave called the Dread Pit. Turns out they're doing something bad over there.

We need you to kick 'em out so we can keep business booming!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Companion Experience]] (warband bonus)
*100x [[Resonance Crystals]]

==Progress==
Glad I finally found someone to check out the Dread Pit!

==Completion==
You took care of the threat in the Dread Pit? Great!

I'll get to work on figuring out a better name for that place. "Dread Pit" just ain't catchy enough.
