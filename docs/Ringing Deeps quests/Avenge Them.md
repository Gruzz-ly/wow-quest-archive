==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Gozzic Cogcrane.jpg|[[Gozzic Cogcrane]]|The Darkfuse boss of the Writhing Fields.}}

Kill the [[Darkfuse Enforcement|Darkfuse]] that killed [[Pamsy]]'s engineers.
*[[Gozzic Cogcrane]] slain {{co|77.6|97.3|Ringing Deeps}}
*[[Correspondence from Zirdo]]

==Description==
I followed [[Zirdo]]'s trail south. I found a nasty piece o' work named Gozzic Cogcrane pushin' workers around and talking about "another lesson." Zirdo must have snitched to this Gozzic guy, but I need to confirm it. I think this Gozzic will have the proof on him.

Gozzic could've given the orders, but lookin' at that bloody shredder and the marks on Pamsy's crew, I'm sure he got involved personally. You should do the same. Kill Gozzic and check him for any sign Zirdo got word to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
These engineers deserved better.

==Completion==
You found proof? I knew it. Not as good as getting Zirdo himself, but we'll catch up with him in the end.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|You'll find Overseer Gozzic in the south, by the huge dropoff.}}

Before leaving, Renzik has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Zirdo's a slippery goblin.

{{gossip|Where'd Zirdo go?}}

I was able to track Zirdo's path down to the south, near some huge digging machines, but then I lost the trail.

{{gossip|We'll get him.}}}}

Head south to the Darkfuse base and find Gozzic Cograne:
:{{Text|Say|Gozzic Cogcrane|Zirdo warned me about you!}}

Destroy [[Gozzic's Bloody Shredder]] and then kill Gozzic himself. Upon killing him:
:{{Text|Say|Gozzic Cogcrane|I can't... die out here!}}

Some [[Hopeless Worker]]s run away:
:{{Text|Say|Hopeless Worker|I'm outta here!}}

Loot [[Correspondence from Zirdo]] from his corpse and return to the pump station. 

On complete of both:
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|This'll be a snap!}}
