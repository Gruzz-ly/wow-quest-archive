==Objectives==
Track down whatever is hunting the [[earthen]] in [[Gundargaz]].
*Investigate the Market
*Investigate the Junction
*Investigate the Tunnel
*[[Daughter of Alizabal]] slain

==Description==
You look dangerous.

<Toki spits on the ground.>

That's good. We need dangerous. Something is stalking Gundargaz.

Something mean. 

Something... recent. 

Just before the [[Coreway]] collapsed I started getting reports of workers going missing mid-shift. Only thing we've been able to find have been the odd chunk of rock.

Fingers, mostly.

If you could sniff out what's stalking my town, I'd be in your debt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
A [[demon]]? Escaped from the crashed ruins of a [[Dalaran|flying magical city]]?

If you say so.

I'm just glad it's sorted.

==Notes==
Find [[Fresh Demon Blood]].

This quest is exclusive to [[warlock]]s and [[demon hunter]]s.
