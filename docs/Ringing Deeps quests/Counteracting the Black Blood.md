==Objectives==
Help Stitchoaf ease the goblin's symptoms in the [[Ringing Deeps]].
* Ingredients added (3)
* "Cure" picked up
* "Cure" applied to Incapacitated Miners (10)

==Description==
[[Black Blood]]? Nasty stuff. Glad I got this mask here. Nobody should be workin' in that mess. 

It gets inside ya, messes with ya head. Some folks get dizzy, seein' things that ain't there. Some even sproutin' strange scales. Makes me itch thinkin' about it. 

An' there ain't no cure. Best we can do is ease the pain an' maybe help the symptoms a bit. 

I got a "cure" brewin'. It's just soup, but they don't know that. 

It's almost "done," but it could use some flavor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I got the pot simmerin'. All it needs is a few finishing touches.

==Completion==
Chicken soup is good for a lot of things. Dunno if the mouthwash'll help though.

At least they'll smell better?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Stitchoaf|I'll leave the flavor up to you. I ain't takin' off this mask to taste it.}}

Pick up the three ingredients that light up: Leftover Food, Mouthwash Bottle, and a Chicken:
:{{text|say|Stitchoaf|Good. Now load up 'an hose 'em down.}}

Interact with the Cauldron and then hose down the incapacitated miners.
