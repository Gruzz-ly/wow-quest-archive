Defeat elementals.
* Defeat Elementals (0/100%)

==Description==
<ZZ-01-47 twitches back and forth, sensors scanning unceasingly. They seem afraid of this area, if they're even capable of feeling fear. Maybe clearing out some of the elementals will set them at ease.>

* [[Element-Attuned Pendant]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I appreciate what you're doing for Zee-Zee.

And they appreciate it, too.

==Completion==
Thanks. I'm sure Zee-Zee appreciates it. When we're done here you can find them at the Shadowvein Extraction site.

[[Disturbed Kelp]]s and [[Kelpmire]] are worth 10%, and [[Disrupted Slime]]s are worth 5%.
