==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Refinery Workers and look for [[Munderut]].
*Rescue [[Refinery Worker]]s (6)
*[[Healing Clay]] (provided)

==Description==
Quickly! [[Elemental]]s have overrun the [[Nibelgaz Mine]] and the refinery crew are trapped down there with them.

I am especially worried about my fused, Munderut. His memory is not the best these days. If you are a friend, rescue him and the refinery workers.

Here, take this healing clay. It only helps a little, but it should be enough for any injured to make their way back. I wish we had a rejuvenating crystal, but that is the stuff of legends.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you rescued the workers yet? What about Munderut? Is there any sign of my fused?

He's long overdue for a sync and gets confused very easily these days.

==Completion==
The workers told me that you helped them escape the refinery. Task complete!

I'll take the clay back now. Gratitude.

==Notes==
Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Orsenth|A stranger. Here to help or to hinder?}}

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Orsenth|I would look for Munderut myself, but these injured workers need my care. I hope you can be trusted, stranger.}}

Rescued [[Refinery Worker]]s say:
*{{text|say|Injured Refinery Worker|Bah, they're making such a mess! This will take ages to clean up.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Refinery Worker|Thank you for the assistance. Hopefully we can get back to work soon.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Refinery Worker|Thank you for the rescue! I will report back and let them know you assisted.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Refinery Worker|This disruption to our work is unacceptable!}}
*{{text|say|Injured Refinery Worker|Why did they keep drilling into that cave? Fools!}}
*{{text|say|Injured Refinery Worker|You arrived just in time. Those slag-heap elementals are tearing the place apart!}}
