==Objectives==
Stomp slimes and take [[:Alhainr's Skull]] away from town.
* [[Ectoplasmic Excretion|Slimes]] stomped (6)
* Get a ride from [[Prospera Cogwail|Prospera]] (Optional)
* Get the skull out of town

==Description==
It's going to ruin everything! Who wants to visit a resort with a thirty-foot tall [[ghost]]-[[Deepstrider|deer]]? Ok, no need to panic. It's probably just a little miffed you took its skull.

First, you gotta get rid of some of these slimes. Then, get that skull out of here. The farther the better.

Oh man, they're gonna get [[ectoplasm]] in the hot pools!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]
*{{wb|repitem=The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation|repamount=500|faction=The Assembly of the Deeps|qty=180|currency=Resonance Crystals|altqty1=205|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
Hurry up, before this whole place is wrecked!

==Completion==
Whew, that was close. This whole thing has really taught me to value the beauty of nature.

<The goblin breaks into laughter.>

Really had you going there, huh? Still, think I'll leave Abyssal Excavation alone for awhile.

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Prospera Cogwail|Deal with the slimes, then get that skull outta here!}}

Deal with the [[Ectoplasmic Excretion]]s around the area. Upon completing the task:

:{{text|yell|Prospera Cogwail|Nice stompin', now get over here! I'll give you a lift.}}

Get over to Prospera:
:{{text|say|Prospera Cogwail|Keep a grip on that skull, you're going long!}}
:''She uses her mech to throw the adventurer towards [[Abyssal Excavation]], in the area where Alhainr was before being slain.''

Placing the skull on the ground will make Alhainr's spirit appear; it then resurrects itself and leaves.

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Prospera Cogwail|That was fun. Let's never do it again.}}

Prospera has new gossip after:
{{dialogue|No hard feelings, already got a new venture cookin'. You interested in the incredible rejuvenatin' powers of ectoplasm for hair and skin? Only five thousand gold a bottle. It's locally harvested, but supply is limited.}}

Completing the quest awards the "Abysmal Extraction" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
