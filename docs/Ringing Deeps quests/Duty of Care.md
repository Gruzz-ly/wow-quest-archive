==Objectives==
Activate the backup systems along the [[Cataract River]].
* [[Backup Substation Terminal|Power rerouted]]
* Leaking Pipe patched (3)
*Pests exterminated (12)

==Description==
[[Corrupted Golem|The golem]] is unstable. I doubt it can travel far. We will track it, but haste failed me once already. [[Foreman Arbauch|Arbauch]] showed true devotion to the machines--we will follow his example. Repairs must come first.

Machine systems are delicate. We must activate the backup before the failure can cascade. Exterminate any pests you find as well. Even the smallest creature can ruin delicate machinery.

I am damaged. I will send my cogwalker with you to relay instructions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Our primary duty is to mend.

==Completion==
The backup systems are operational. Now we may track the golem.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Danagh|Make repairs. Then we must locate the golem.}}
:{{text|say|[[Clive DelGizmo]]|I might be able to help with that.}}

Danagh has gossip:
{{dialogue|Disastrous. That substation routed power throughout this whole sector of the Deeps. With it destroyed, damage could propagate to other systems as well.}}

Dangh's Cogwalker will follow you around, and Danagh can speak through it:
{{dialogue|Hello, can you hear me? These bots were never meant for transmitting voice.}}

Upon reaching the cave in the [[Cataract River]] where the backup terminal and the damaged pipes can be found:
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|Shameful. We have neglected these machines.}}

Upon completing all the objectives:
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|That is all. Our duty now is the golem.}}
