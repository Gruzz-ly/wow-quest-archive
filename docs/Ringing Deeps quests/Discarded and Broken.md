'''Discarded and Broken''' starts an optional chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]]. This chapter is required for [[Allied Races: Earthen]].

==Objectives==
Collect [[Machinist Kittrin]]'s lost tools.
* [[Machinist's Gauge]]
* [[Machinist's Calipers]]
* [[Machinist's Wrench]]

==Description==
You there! You're here to help, aren't you?

The humming melody of the machines is changing, and I... I admit I am not ready. For so many years I served faithfully, and then...

Well the important thing is that I'm ready to get to work again. But you see, my tools have all been broken and scattered about.

If you could keep an eye out for them and bring them back to me, I would be in your debt.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A machinist is nothing without the tools of office.

==Completion==
My gauge! My calipers! My wrench!

It feels good to have them in my hands again. Though, I have to admit, I have not been entirely honest with you.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Machinist Kittrin|You can find the tools in the areas just outside of Gundargaz. They... might be buried. Bring them back to me and I will get them in use again.}}

Three spots light up on the minimap: to the northwest, east, and southeast, which are the gauge, calipers, and wrench respectively. All three tools are in a [[Machinist Plinth]].

On complete, Kittrin has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
I once heard the singing of the deep machines. One day, I will hear them again.

{{gossip|Why are these tools so important to you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
My purpose is--was--to serve and fix the great Forge that sustains our sleeping brethren. My tools are part of who I am and what I do.

{{gossip|Then why did you throw them away?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
After so many centuries, so many eons, the forge simply... ceased to function.

I lost my faith, I admit it. I took my tools and ritually buried them. 

But now! Now things are changing. I have felt the ground rumble beneath my feet. I have heard the machines stirring. Music I longed to hear since I first awoke now rings through these caverns.

With my tools in my hands again, I have my purpose. And what's more, I can truly appreciate what I have.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
