==Objectives==
Rescue Pamsy's last engineers from the [[Writhing Fields]].
*[[Razi]] saved {{co|74.2|92.6|Ringing Deeps}}
*[[Keets]] saved {{co|72.8|90.2|Ringing Deeps}}
*[[Glizza]] saved {{co|75.6|94.6|Ringing Deeps}}
*Speak to [[Gazlowe]] at the Pump Station.

==Description==
This crew trusted me. They're my family. We gotta see if any of them survived. 

I have other engineers who ain't here. They must have fled into the field. Razi, Keets, and Glizza are out there. Find 'em. Bring 'em home.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Don't leave those engineers out there to die.

==Completion==
We made some progress here while you were helping Pamsy's engineers.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Pamsy|I won't let the Darkfuse, or Gallywix, bully us. We are shutting this all down.}}
:''Pamsy walks over to a console and starts working on it.''
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I'll give you a hand, Pamsy. <Name>, save the rest of her crew.}}
:''Gazlowe helps her.''

Before leaving, Pamsy has gossip:
{{dialogue|There's always a way to fix things.

{{gossip|I'm sorry about your family, Pamsy.}}

{{dialogue-child|I appreciate that.

I'll spend time to grieve later. Right now, we need to help the living.

{{gossip|We will, Pamsy.}}}}

{{gossip|What are you doing now?}}

{{dialogue-child|I was trying to get into the controls, but the console wouldn't take my pass-code. Somebody with high level access has been here.

But we can get creative. We're goblin engineers, after all! We don't quit, even if something explodes a little.

{{gossip|I'd like to ask about something else.}}}}}}

The three engineers are marked on the minimap. Find them while killing enemies for [[Bloody Business]]. From north to south, they are:

{{Dialogue|title=[[Keets]]|Everything out here's on fire. Literally and figuratively.

{{Gossip|quest=|Pamsy sent me. The Pump Station's safe!}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Keets|Headed back to the station.}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Razi]]|I HATE this place!

{{Gossip|quest=|Pamsy sent me. The Pump Station's safe!}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Razi|I'll go check in with Pamsy!}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Glizza]]|What are you doing here? This place is deadly!

{{Gossip|quest=|Pamsy sent me. The Pump Station's safe!}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Glizza|Huh. Thanks for saving me!}}

[[FIle:Found Family - after.jpg|thumb|Pamsy's Crew: [[Keets]], [[Glizza]], [[Evbert]], [[Grotee]], [[Nicaxel]], [[Wikky]], and [[Razi]]]]

After returning, the members of Pamsy's Crew are gathered in one area. The surviving members have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Keets|Our team's been cut in half. It's hard to be positive.}}
{{dialogue|title=Glizza|Everything feels pretty hopeless.}}
{{dialogue|title=Razi|Pamsy is making us rest up. I'm sure she'll solve things, though. 

She's our boss for good reason!}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|<Name>, we have a plan.}}
:''[[Renzik "The Shiv"]] drops out of stealth nearby.''
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|It starts with killing the Darkfuse leader, Gozzic.}}
