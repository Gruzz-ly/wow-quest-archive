==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Alhainr.png|Alhainr|Alhainr was here long before Opportunity Point. Some say he was here before the earthen.}}
Slay [[Alhainr]] and collect its skull.
* [[Alhainr's Skull]]

==Description==
Ever seen a [[deepstrider]] before? This one sure ain't happy to see us. Made quick work of the [[shredder]]s that made it past the [[mole]]s. Real shame, those pilots are gonna have to work overtime to pay off the damages.

Now if someone were to take care of it and bring back something as proof, well, I'm sure there'd be a nice payday.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*13,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
;Before killing Alhainr
You deal with it yet?

;After killing Alhainr
What did you do?!

==Completion==
This is bad, real bad! You'd think killin' something would make it less dangerous. We're getting stomped!

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Prospera Cogwail|Look out for the hooves! Saw it punch clean through a shredder.}}

Upon killing Alhainr, its spirit appears and starts running toward [[Opportunity Point]].

Upon returning to Prospera:
:{{text|yell|Prospera Cogwail|It's wreckin' everything!}}

[[Terrified Vacationer]]s and [[Panicked Prospector]]s are around.

==Progression==
{{Abysmal Extraction}}
