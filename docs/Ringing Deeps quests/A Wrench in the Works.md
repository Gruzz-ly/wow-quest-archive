'''A Wrench in the Works''' begins the Dark Revelations chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]].

==Objectives==
Encourage members of the crowd to air their grievances.
* Grievance heard (4)

==Description==
Looks like the [[High Speaker Eirich|High Speaker]] is addressing his workers. It seems something has finally shaken them from their complacency, and their time away from the [[Awakening Machine]] is affecting them.

<[[Moira Thaurissan|Moira]] pauses to brush a bit of dust off her robe.>

Perhaps this would be a good opportunity for everyone to hear what they have to say?

We should convince a few of these [[Machine Speakers]] to speak up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Recalcitrant lot, aren't they?

==Completion==
Excellent, now we're starting to make some progress.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Sometimes, diplomacy means stirring the pot. Let's see what bubbles up.}}

Two [[Agitated Machine Speaker|agitated]] and two [[Concerned Machine Speaker|concerned]] machine speakers light up. Interact with all four of them:

{{dialogue|title=Agitated Machine Speaker 1|More speeches aren't what we need.

{{gossip|quest=|Now is the time to speak up.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Agitated Machine Speaker|Are we preparing for more [[nerubian]] attacks?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Eirich|Earthen above us have fought that battle, and we've recovered from our own minor raid.}}

{{dialogue|title=Agitated Machine Speaker 2|Nothing but empty promises...

{{gossip|quest=|Now is the time to speak up.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Agitated Machine Speaker|Why haven't we heard more about [[Taelloch]]?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Eirich|We're currently investigating. You would be wise to avoid that distant destination.}}

{{dialogue|title=Concerned Machine Speaker 1|It's been many cycles since the last time we saw him here. Discontent is increasing.

{{gossip|quest=|Now is the time to speak up.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Concerned Machine Speaker|I see [[Speaker Brinthe]] has returned.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Eirich|As long as she knows her place and does her job, we'll allow her to resume her work.}}

{{dialogue|title=Concerned Machine Speaker 2|Things are falling apart down here and all he does is talk.

{{gossip|quest=|Now is the time to speak up.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Concerned Machine Speaker|The number of working machinists is insufficient!}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Eirich|All the more reason to restore our Awakening Machine!}}

After speaking with the fourth:
:{{text|say|High Speaker's Guard|No further questions! Return to your assigned duties! Praise the High Speaker.}}
:''The gathered audience wanders off, grumbling along the way.''
:{{text|say|Agitated Machine Speaker|Ridiculous.}}
:{{text|say|Traditionalist Machine Speaker|Hmph.}}
:{{text|say|Traditionalist Machine Speaker|The longer we're away from the Awakening Machine, the more this discontent is going to grow.}}
:{{text|say|Reassured Machine Speaker|The High Speaker is doing all he can.}}
:{{text|say|Traditionalist Machine Speaker|Are we really supposed to believe any of that?}} <!-- Didn't appear for me. Some degree of randomness? -->
:{{Text|say|Traditionalist Machine Speaker|And that's why we need an Awakening Machine. Recharge the body, refocus the mind.}}
:{{Text|say|Traditionalist Machine Speaker|There was a time when workers focused on work! We have procedures for a reason.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Traditionalist Machine Speaker|Not a single real answer...}}
