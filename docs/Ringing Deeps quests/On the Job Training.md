==Objectives==
Help Steamwarden Hurlt repair the steamworks.
* [[Steamwarden Hurlt]] spoken to
* Steamworks repaired

==Description==
[[Earthen|Stoneheads]] use steam to run whole place. Have lava, have water, make sense.

Repairs not going well, we hear. No new parts from factory. "Against rules" to use scrap, been told. A lot.

Help get old machines work. We watch, learn. Maybe not get yelled at for helping.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How go?

==Completion==
Seem easy enough. Put steam in pipe, try not to cook self.

I get!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Steamwarden Hurlt|Cog preserve us. This is what we've been reduced to.}}
:''Hurlt walks a few yards away.''
:{{text|say|Steamwarden Hurlt|Let's see what you outlanders are made of. Speak to me when you're ready to get to work.}}

Speak with him:
{{Dialogue|Are you ready to get to work, outsider?

{{gossip|quest=|I am. Just tell me what to do.}}
}}

This starts a traditional pick-an-object minigame. Nearby, a [[Shutoff Lever]], a [[Pressure Readout]], a [[Flow Control (Ringing Deeps)|Flow Control]] console, and a [[Steam Pipe]] light up.
*{{text|yell|Steamwarden Hurlt|The blasted console is stuck! A little percussive maintenance should loosen it up.}}
*{{text|yell|Steamwarden Hurlt|What's the pressure at, now? Read me those numbers, now!}}
*{{text|yell|Steamwarden Hurlt|The pressure's too much! Throw the shutoff lever!}}
*{{text|yell|Steamwarcen Hurlt|That pipe's coming loose! Quick, smack it back into place!}}

Players need to interact with seven objects correctly, and in time (within ten seconds).

Too slow:
:{{text|yell|Steamwarden Hurlt|Too slow! Let me know when you're ready to get a move on.}}

Wrong object:
:{{text|yell|Steamwarden Hurlt|No, not that one! Now we have to start over! Let me know when you're ready to listen to directions.}}

Objective complete:
:{{text|say|Steamwarden Hurlt|That did it! Not half bad, outlander.}}
:{{text|say|Steamwarden Hurlt|Not bad, outlander. Not bad.}}

Upon completion, Fourman Grimes has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Work to do. What?}}
