==Objectives==
Meet up with [[ZZ-01-47]] at the [[Shadowvein Extraction Site]].

==Description==
I sent Zee-Zee ahead to the Shadowvein extraction site.

From what they transmitted back it looks like the area is swarming with rock worms and covered in this... discharge. I gave them an upgrade while we were waiting for you.

I don't know how effective it'll be in battle but the results should be shocking for anyone that tries to threaten them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Zee-Zee beeps in recognition and excitement. It seems like they're ready to get underway.>

==Notes==
On accept:

==Patch changes==
