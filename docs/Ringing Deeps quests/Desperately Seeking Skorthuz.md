'''Desperately Seeking Skorthuz''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]], started at [[Shadowvein Point]] without any prerequisites.

==Objectives==
Look for [[Skorthuz]] around the [[Chittering Den]].

==Description==
Eh? Who are you? Oh that's right, I heard that there were new folk about.

Say, are you heading north? If so, keep an eye out for my friend, Skorthuz, will you? The laggard was due back an hour ago but is nowhere to be seen. I heard he was heading towards the Chittering Den for some awful reason.

If you see him, tell him to hurry up and get back here or I'm drinking alone!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|85}}
*2,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Who are you? Oh, Hrandaz sent you? Is it that time already?

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Hrandaz|Hmph. It's not like Skorthuz to be late.}}

On accept, Hrandaz has gossip:
{{dialogue|Skorthuz should know better than to keep me waiting. This cinderbrew isn't going to drink itself!}}

Head northeast to the [[Chittering Den]]. Outside the entrance to the [[Fetid Grotto]], Skorthuz is lamenting his lot in life:
:{{text|say|Skorthuz|There's no way I'm going back in there. What do I do?!}}

==Progression==
{{Frolicking in the Fetid Grotto}}
