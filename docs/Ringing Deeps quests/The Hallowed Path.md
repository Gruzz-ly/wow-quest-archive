'''The Hallowed Path''' begins the [[Hallowfall storyline]], taking players through [[Hallowfall]] as the third level-up zone in [[The War Within campaign]].

==Objectives==
Meet with the denizens of [[Hallowfall]].
*Exit to Hallowfall (Optional)
* Find the [[Hallowfall Gate|Gate to Hallowfall]]
* Speak with Anduin in Hallowfall{{Co|77.18|43|Hallowfall}}
* Meet the Arathi in [[Dunelle's Kindness]]

==Description==
<Name>, I'm glad our paths have crossed. [[Adelgonn]] has been telling me about a cavern called Hallowfall.

She's told me the people there are called the [[Arathi]]. I cannot imagine that they are related to the [[Arathor|ancient human kingdom]], but it can't be a coincidence.

Adelgonn's people had fruitful contact with them some time ago. Whatever happened, I hope to repair that relationship and gain their aid. Please meet me at the Hallowfall Gate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Friendly outsiders are not common in Hallowfall. Only enemies emerging from the shadow.

But you seem comfortable in the light despite how unusual you may appear. I would welcome you, were we not in the midst of a crisis.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|But we had no access to the [[Coreway]]. And helping another culture was outside the [[Oathsworn]]'s [[Edict]]s.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Perhaps they need our help as well? Thank you for your help, Adelgonn.}}
:''Anduin hops on a gryphon and flies off.''

Before leaving, Adelgonn has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Now that the Oathsworn and [[Unbound]] are working together, we need to forge other relationships.

I hope the earthen can rekindle our cooperation with the Arathi.

Perhaps Anduin can help there, just as [[Moira Thaurissan|Moira]] helped unite us.}}

[[File:The Hallowed Path - Anduin and Beledar.jpg|thumb|Anduin looking out at Beledar.]]
Past the Hallowfall Gate, Anduin is standing at a cliff's edge at [[Lothar's Landing]], looking out at [[Beledar]].
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|By the Light! It shines as brightly as the sun.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Are those... [[Arathi airship|airships]]? But we're underground.}}

Talk with him:
{{Dialogue|We'll find out if the people of Hallowfall will stand with us as allies, <name>.

{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}}}

[[File:The Hallowed Path - Radiant Song.jpg|thumb|The Radiant Song affecting the player.]]
The screen shakes by the force of the [[Radiant Song]] for a few seconds:
:{{Abilities|Radiant Song|id=453731|Azeroth calls to you.|icon=spell_azerite_essence_18}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I hear... the Radiant Song? Is it coming from that crystal?}}
:''Anduin mounts up on his gryphon, flies down toward Dunelle's Kindness and despawns.''

[[File:The Hallowed Path - Anduin and Arathi.jpg|thumb|Anduin, Faerin, and Steelstrike in Dunelle's Kindness.]]
In the center of Dunelle's Kindness, [[Faerin]] is having an argument with [[General Steelstrike]].
:{{Text|say|General Steelstrike|The nerubians breached the [[Aegis Wall]], Faerin! The darkness forced us back!}}
:{{Text|say|Faerin|Your fear of the dark will kill us all, General! We'll never survive unless--}}
:''Anduin lands and dismounts nearby.''
:{{Text|say|General Steelstrike|Quiet, Lamplighter! Outsiders are here. Who are you?}}
:''Anduin and Faerin walk up to each other.''

Steelstrike and Faerin have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=General Steelstrike|Greetings, outsider. I am General Steelstrike, in command of the [[Arathi Army|army of Hallowfall]].

We would never turn away a blade or staff, but we have survived by following the rules of the [[Shadow Curfew]].

A careless soldier endangers everyone.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Faerin|You are the first friendly outsider I've met, other than earthen. I have many questions, but those will have to wait. I am in need of help from those unafraid of the dangers in the dark.}}
