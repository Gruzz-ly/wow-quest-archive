==Objectives==
Introduce yourself to the maintenance machine.
* Introduce yourself to [[ZZ-01-47]]

==Description==
I tracked down a distress signal that led me to this little maintenance machine. A curious find, but the real treasure is the [[Deepforge Golemworks|defunct war golem facility]] to the southeast.

If we can start producing war golems again we'll be able to contribute to the war effort. Unfortunately, it's been overrun by a goblin salvage group. And we'll need to investigate and assess if the facility is functional.

Fortunately, I have a plan, and it involves our little friend here. Why don't you introduce yourself?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
With your assistance, I think we can find a way to clear this place out.

==Completion==
Now that introductions are out of the way. Let's sneak our way into this facility.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|ZZ-01-47 is the last maintenance machine of the Deepforge Golemworks. Say hello, Zee-Zee!}}

Speak with ZZ-01-47:
{{dialogue|<ZZ-01-47 blurts a series of bleeps in ascending pitch and tips their form slightly, as if in greeting.>

{{gossip|quest=|Hello Zee-Zee, I'm <name>. It's a pleasure to meet you.}}
:{{text|emote|<Zee-Zee emits a happy beep.>}}
{{gossip|quest=|ZZ-01-47, is it? I hope you'll be of help to us in retaking the Deepforge Golemworks.}}
:{{text|emote|<ZZ-01-47 emits a wary beep.>}}
{{gossip|quest=|<Vocalize a series of sounds in an attempt to mimic her greeting.>}}
:{{text|emote|<ZZ-01-47 emits a confused beep.>}}}}

==Progression==
{{The Machines March to War}}
