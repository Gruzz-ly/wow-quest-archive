[[File:Wax On Pot Off.jpg|thumb|[[Kobold Cauldron]]s ready for some adulteration]]

==Objectives==
Sabotage the pots of wax in the [[Warrens]].
* [[Kobold Cauldron|Wax pots]] ruined (6)

==Description==
If candles are important to [[kobold]] society, I have an idea that might disrupt their production... or at least make sure there's an unpleasant surprise waiting for our enemy.

Take [[Unstable Cinderbrew Barrel|that cinderbrew]]. Drop some in those large vats of wax the kobolds are prepping at the top of that hill. It's a powerful explosive. It burns aggressively, so try not to drop any.

It should certainly make any candles made with that wax quite feisty, once they're lit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Try not to breathe too many of the fumes.

==Completion==
Hopefully, that takes them down a peg or two.

A leader's power waxes and wanes. With all this destruction, the Candle King's power is waning.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Contemplating mayhem: mixing the Cinderbrew with candle wax should yield pyrotechnic results.}}

Head up the hill and interact with six of the giant [[Kobold Cauldron]]s.

On return:
:{{text|say|Skitter|Candle King weak! Bullies weak! Just one thing left to do...}}

==Progression==
{{By Candlelight}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
