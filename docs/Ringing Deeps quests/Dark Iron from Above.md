==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Supervisor Varric.jpg|Supervisor Varric|Leads the zealous loyalists of High Speaker Eirich in the Earthenworks. Sees non-conformity as defiance, non-compliance, or deviance.}}

Defeat Supervisor Varric and his forces within the Earthenworks.
* Speak with [[Moira Thaurissan|Moira]]
* [[Supervisor Varric]] slain
* Mount [[Varric's Damaged Ironstrider]]
* Attacking forces defeated (0/100%)

==Description==
We've done our best to contain the High Speaker's followers. We've hampered their efforts at destroying or looting anything they can take with them into [[Hall of Awakening]].

Now, we just need to deal with the leader of their forces before they can coordinate a more unified resistance.

Are you ready to do this, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*13,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Ringing Deeps should be safe... for now. But the High Speaker...

We need to follow Speaker Brinthe into the Hall of Awakening.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Supervisor Varric|You dare challenge the will of the High Speaker? Suffer for your hubris!}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Let's see how brave you are when your protective shield is gone.}}
:{{text|say|Supervisor Varric|Slag and rust! This isn't over. The High Speaker will hear of this!}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Come with me. We can't let Varric get away!}} <!-- didn't show up. -->

After the script event ends, speak with Moira again:
{{dialogue|A fine mess, this is.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready, let's go!}}

:''The player hops on a gryphon and flies northeast to a bridge. Moira lands just behind.''
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|We've caught up to him! <Name>, take 'em out! I'll guard the rear.}}

[[Supervisor Varric]] is hovering in a mech some 80 yards north. Engage him, then finish him off and an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-engine cinematic plays]]:
{{#ev:youtube|YwCsJw2kyDM}}

:''Varric's mech staggers and he attempts to flee.''
:{{text|bossemote|Supervisor Varric|Must.. get away!}}
:''The adventurer hops on to the front of the mech before it flies off. As the mech gains altitude, then speed, the adventurer jumps from the front of the mech and lands just behind Varric's pilot seat. With a punch, Varric falls sloooooooowly to the ground, but the camera cuts away before his fall into lava happens.''
:{{text|bossemote|Supervisor Varric|Deviants!}}
:''Almost immediately after, the mech explodes and it dives down to the ground. After a fade to black to end the cutscene, the adventurer wakes up, looking north at the [[Stonevault]].''
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Rouse yourself, champion! The enemy advances!}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Looks like Varric's machine is still usable. Use that mechanical contraption to blast 'em to scrap!}}

Hop in [[Varric's Damaged Ironstrider]]s to enter a shooting minigame, and the mech provides three abilities:
# {{abilities|Gigablast|Launch a projectile that deals moderate damage to the first enemy hit.|range=100|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant}}
# {{abilities|Lava Surge|Blast all nearby enemies that are in front of you for massive damage.|range=30|cd=5 sec|notes=Instant}}
# {{abilities|Repairing Flames|Create a shield that protects you from all harm and rapidly heals you to full health for 4 sec.|range=10|cd=10 sec|notes=Instant}}

Fill the bar by defeating:
* [[Swarming Cogwalker]] (2%)
* [[Zealot's Guardbot]] (4%)
* [[Zealous Ironguard]] (5-6%)

At 100%, another in-game cinematic plays:
{{#ev:youtube|7OOrTuFGgE8|Moira flying to the Stonevault}}
:''The camera is focused on the Stonevault Exterior, then it quickly whips around to spot Moira astride her gryphon, tracking her as it comes in to land.''
:{{text|bossemote|Moira Thaurissan|Well done! Now let's regroup ahead.}}

Head north to meet her by the instance line, where Magni and Dagran are also waiting.
