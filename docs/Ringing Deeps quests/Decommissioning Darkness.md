==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Corrupted Golem.png|Corrupted Golem|A golem sent into the dark too many times may bring something back with it.}}
Destroy the Corrupted Golem and recover [[Foreman Arbauch]]'s memory gem.
*[[Corrupted Golem]] slain
*[[Arbauch's Memory Gem]]
*Return to Danagh in Camp Murroch

==Description==
Decommissioning a machine is a rare necessity. It must be done with care and regret.

We put much of ourselves into our work. To destroy it is to destroy a part of ourselves. In doing so, we admit our failure to protect the [[Titan]]s' work. But where stone rebels against stone, we must stand firm.

Imperative: Destroy it. Recover Arbauch's memory gem.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 13,600 [[XP]]
*{{wb|repitem=The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation|repamount=500|faction=The Assembly of the Deeps|qty=180|currency=Resonance Crystals|altqty1=205|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
Regret. This should have been my burden.

==Completion==
There is no joy in the death of a machine, but I express gratitude. I suspect Arbauch would too. 

His decisions were his own, but none can doubt that he devoted his life to the machines. The Titans would be proud.

==Notes==
Upon approaching the [[Corrupted Golem]] at a cave in the [[Living Grotto]]:
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|What is it doing with the memory gem? Stop it!}}
:{{text|yell|Corrupted Golem|Attempting memory insertion.}}
:The golem is surrounded by [[Dormant Golem]]s and attempting "memory insertion" on them.
:{{text|yell|Corrupted Golem|Failure. Memory vessel incompatible.}}

Upon engaging the golem in combat:
:{{text|yell|Corrupted Golem|Scanning target.}}
:{{text|yell|Corrupted Golem|Error: incompatible memory vessel. Priority: protect gem.}}
:During combat some Dormant Golems will get activated by the Corrupted Golem becoming [[Unstable Golem]]s and attack.
:{{text|yell|Corrupted Golem|PROTECT GEM PROTECT SPEAKER PROTECT GEM.}}

Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Corrupted Golem|Protect gem. Protect speaker. Protect...}}
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|Was it trying to fit the gem into a new vessel? Did it think that would bring Arbauch back?}}
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|If only that were true. Come, I will wait at Camp Murroch.}}

Upon returning to Danagh, he has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Did the golem think it could save him? Fighting its own corrupted instructions, even after killing him... I have served the machines for many years, and still I do not fully understand them.}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Danagh|Boundless gratitude, <name>. I will bring Arbauch's memory gem to the archive.}}
:{{text|say|Danagh|DelGizmo. Your reluctant assistance proved invaluable.}}
:{{text|say|[[Clive DelGizmo]]|How invaluable we talkin'?}}
:{{text|say|Danagh|You have my gratitude. That is all.}}

Completing the quest awards the "Routine Maintenance" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
