Enter the cave at the top of the hill to find [[Torchsnall]] with three [[Waxtail Scraper]]s tending to his feet:
*{{text|yell|Torchsnarl|Get between toes! No forget!}}
*{{text|yell|Torchsnarl|Scrub harder!}}
*{{text|yell|Torchsnarl|Stop and I crush you!}}

Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Torchsnarl|Smash you! Bash you! Puny... thing!}}

Get him to 3% health and he will run away:
:{{text|say|Torchsnarl|Ah! Not the face! Not fair!}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Skitter|Candle King weak! Bullies weak! Just one thing left to do...}}
