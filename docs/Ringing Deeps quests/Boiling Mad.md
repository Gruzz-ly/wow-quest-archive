==Objectives==
Track [[Berrund the Gleaming|Berrund]] and [[Fearbreaker]] through the [[Ringing Deeps]].
* Berrund tracked (3)
*Meet Moira outside the Rumbling Wastes.

==Description==
That gravel-brained ingrate! He took Fearbreaker and ran off to the north!

It's not that I want that hammer for myself. I don't. But it belongs to the [[Bronzebeard clan]]. It should be in the hands of someone who respects its power!

We need to track him down before he hurts himself or someone else with that hammer!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have ye found signs of where Berrund took Fearbreaker?

==Completion==
These [[earthen]] have had a bad time of it.

Berrund's already run headlong into there, but if he was hoping to clean up the ills of the place, he's clearly in over his rocky head.

<Moira points to the nearby rocky contusion>

Look, he can barely keep hold o' Fearbreaker! What if he drops it and is killed? We need tae find him.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Fearbreaker's not some clump of pretty metal. It's got feelings and opinions. Berrund's going to have a devil of a time keeping hold of it. We can track him.}}
:''Moira mounts up and flies north.''

[[File:Boiling Mad.jpg|thumb|Two [[Seismic Contusion]]s]]
Head north, looking for blue-glowing [[Seismic Contusion]]s on the ground. They all have gossip:

{{book|content=Fearbreaker impacted the ground with some force here. This devastation does not seem intentional.}}
{{book|content=Energy still crackles from where Fearbreaker struck the earth. The hammer seems to be resisting its wielder.}}
{{book|content=Berrund's hold on Fearbreaker seems tenuous, as the hammer appears to have impacted the ground yet again, this time with even more force.}}

After finding the third, follow the [[Cataract River]] north to the northwestern end of the [[Rumbling Wastes]], where Moira is waiting with some [[Injured Earthen (Ringing Deeps)|Injured Earthen]].

==Trivia==
The line "This devastation does not seem intentional" is a reference to ''{{wp|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn}}'', in which the villain Gaius van Baelsar remarks about another villain's actions, "Such devastation... This was ''not'' my intention..."

==Progression==
