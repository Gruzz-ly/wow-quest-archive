'''Rust and Redemption''' is an optional quest at [[Pillarstone Spire]] in northwestern [[Ringing Deeps]]. After completing the quest, players unlock the elevator up to [[Skolzgal Mill]] on the [[Isle of Dorn]].

==Objectives==
Collect 3 Pure Crawler Extracts from [[Underdrip Crawler]]s and [[Crawler Sproutling]]s within the [[Ringing Deeps]].
* [[Pure Crawler Extract]] (3)

==Description==
As you approach, a rusty lever catches your eye, stubbornly stuck in its place. 

"This thing hasn't moved in ages," you muse, as you feel the rough metal resist your touch. 

Glancing around, you note the oily sheen on the plantlike Crawlers. "Perhaps a bit of natural lubricant would do the trick," you ponder, realizing that these flora foes might yield what you need to ease the lever's grip.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
:{{abilities|Isle of Dorn|Unlocks access to the Isle of Dorn Elevator in Pillarstone Spire.|id=459835|icon=achievement_zone_isleofdorn}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The lever remains immovable, its secret locked tight without the Crawler Extract.

==Completion==
With the Crawler Extract in hand, you approach the obstinate lever once more.

A few drops of the viscous liquid, and the lever moves with ease, revealing new paths ahead.

==Notes==
After completion, the Rusted Lever becomes the Elevator Lever.
