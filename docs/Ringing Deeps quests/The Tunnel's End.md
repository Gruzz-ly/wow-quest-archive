[[File:The Tunnel's End.jpg|thumb|[[Magni Bronzebeard]], [[Dagran Thaurissan II]], and an [[Injured Machine Speaker]]]]
==Objectives==
Investigate the rumors about [[Taelloch]].
* Find [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]] and [[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]] near Taelloch
*Turn in to Magni

==Description==
So we're hearing more rumors about Taelloch. 

The town and its mine are responsible for ore production. Apparently, we haven't received shipments in weeks, and the town's [[Kol Bruncrag|foreman]] has disappeared. Now the [[High Speaker Eirich|High Speaker]] is discouraging anyone from traveling there.

That tells me we should investigate. And of course, if people are hurting, then we should help them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|17|55}}
*8,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Beasts inside?

The residents of Taelloch might need our help.

Help me keep an eye on Dagran, <name>. He's read a lot of stories about thrilling adventures, but he hasn't seen what we've seen.

And something seems... off.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I'll speak with the Council in Dornogal. They need to hear about this.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|In the meantime, I want to investigate Taelloch. Something about those missing shipments...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I'm coming with you, lad. Brinthe, we'll be back soon.}}
:''Dagran and Magni speak with [[Igram Underwing]] and fly away, Brinthe and Skitter walk into Brinthe's home, and Moira walks in the direction of the [[Ironhaul Station]].''

Before leaving, Brinthe has gossip:
{{dialogue|When that Dagran takes an interest, he really can't be stopped, eh?

As I said, Taelloch is an important mining outpost. It was known for running like a well-oiled machine. I've known the Foreman, Kol Bruncrag, for quite some time. But it's been a while since we spoke.

I need an answer for why ore production has stopped... even if the High Speaker doesn't want me to find one. He's probably sent his investigators, but we should see for ourselves.}}

Head southeast down to [[Camp Murroch]], either via flight path or manually. On the way, players may run across the [[Pillarstone Spire]], where [[Mindi Maxlof]] starts [[An Opportunity to Relax]], and the [[Rusted Lever]] inside the elevator to the surface starts [[Rust and Redemption]].

At the north entrance to Taelloch:
:{{text|say|Injured Machine Speaker|Intruders! The beasts! Inside--}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Did he just... shut down?}}
