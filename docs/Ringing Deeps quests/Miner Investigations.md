==Objectives==
Examine suspicious canisters and crates with [[Orwenya]].
* [[Suspicious Canister]] {{co|75.0|76.8|Ringing Deeps}}
* [[Zirdo|Ask about shipments]] {{co|76.3|73.7|Ringing Deeps}}
* [[Worker Timecard]] inspected {{co|76.3|78.6|Ringing Deeps}}

==Description==
What "riches" are they mining out of the earth? Could this deep digging be related to my visions? Surely these goblins would not find value in something like [[Black Blood]].

We must get a closer look. Together we will gain insight into their operation.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Suspiciously Stained Shoulderguards]]
* [[Suspiciously Stained Legguards]]
* [[Suspiciously Stained Greaves]]
* [[Suspiciously Stained Wristwraps]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
My visions suggest there is more to the south. We should move on soon. 

Does this goblin you discovered have more information?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|I fear I know what they are digging up. Let us be sure.}}
:''Orweyna leaves in her bat form.''

Pick up [[Hostile Work Environment]] and head out. Interact with the [[Suspicious Canister]] marked on the minimap and Orweyna runs up:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|This is Black Blood. They must be bringing it from the south.}}
:''She shifts to bat form and flies away.''

Head northeast to [[Gutterside Rocket Station]] and meet with [[Zirdo]], the micromanager:
{{Dialogue|A new face? Great to see you. I'm Zirdo, and I specialize in gettin' people what they need!

Welcome to my shipping desk. How can I help?

{{Gossip|quest=|I'd like to learn more about the process here.}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Zirdo|Meet me by the south gate, friend. I'll clock out and clue ya in.}}
:''Orweyna appears in bat form for a moment, then flies away.''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|South? That seems more like what I saw in my vision.}}

Zirdo has new gossip:
{{dialogue|I'll be right with you, but I want to clock out first. Accurate reports are important!

And I want a promotion.}}

[[File:Miner Investigations - timecard.jpg|thumb|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]] and a [[Worker Timecard]]]]

Head south to spot [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] inspecting timecards:
:{{text|say|Renzik "The Shiv"|The employees are being worked to death, based on these timecards.}}

He has gossip:
{{dialogue|Just looking through these shows this is a huge operation that stretches from the south all the way into Undermine.

I see some shift tags that reference Undermine hours!}}

Inspect the lit up [[Worker Timecard]] and [[Zirdo]] runs up:
:{{text|say|Zirdo|Let me just clock out over here...}}
:{{text|say|Zirdo|So let's get what you need! Eh? I accept gold as a, as a tip... You know, if my info's useful.}}
:''Zirdo runs southeast over to Monte's position.''
:{{text|whisper|Renzik "The Shiv"|Really? This guy.}}
:''Renzik follows and Orweyna flies in.''

On the table nearby, look out for a [[Dirty Scroll]] that starts [[Order of Magnitude]].

Head southeast to Monte and the gang:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Over here!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Orweyna|I saw the Black Blood in my visions, but not all of that machinery.}}
:{{text|say|Zirdo|How's about a tour?}}

The collected characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|Look, we can't just assume the worst of everybody. Their situation has been bad for years.}}
{{dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|Trusting this skeezy guy feels like a bad idea, but he could have useful intel.

I'm keeping an eye on him.}}
{{dialogue|title=Zirdo|Ol' Zirdo's here to help.

You just let me know what ya need!}}
{{dialogue|title=Orweyna|If Zirdo can give us more information about this mining operation, I would like to hear it. But I feel we should get moving.}}
