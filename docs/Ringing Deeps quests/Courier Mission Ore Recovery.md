==Notes==
Pick up an ore bucket from the pile at {{co|64.6|63.9|Ringing Deeps}}, then walk, on foot, down off the ridge into the lower level of the mine. Pick up resources from [[Taelloch Ore]]s and [[Big Taelloch Ore]]s, and use the extra action button to refill the balance gauge. The spell for the extra action button is an empowered cast, so hold it down until it reaches the third area for a full refill and a speed boost for a few seconds. Use [[Improvised Springboard]]s or [[Reclamation Machinist]]s to get back on the track and deliver the ore to the targeted area (yellow arrow) at the end of the track.
