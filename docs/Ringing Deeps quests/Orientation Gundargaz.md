'''Orientation: Gundargaz''' concludes the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]]. The [[Hallowfall storyline]] starts immediately after with [[The Hallowed Path]].

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Waxmonger Squick]] in [[Gundargaz]]
* Speak to Waxmonger Squick

==Description==
Our new kobold friends have been moving into Gundargaz. They've also been gathering odds and ends from around the [[Ringing Deeps]].

You should check in with the Quartermaster! Go have a look at what they've collected. Then we can talk about what we're doing next.

I heard [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]'s around here somewhere. I suspect he has some plans for [[Hallowfall]]. We need all the allies we can get against the [[nerubian]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,350 [[XP]]
*[[The Ringing Deeps (achievement)]]

==Progress==
New allies are always appreciated.

==Completion==
It's good to make new friends. In the days ahead, we'll need all the help we can get.

==Notes==
[[Waxmonger Squick]] is outside just to the northeast.

The next quest in the campaign is outside to the north, where [[Anduin Wrynn]] is speaking with [[Adelgonn]] in the center of town.

Moira also starts an optional chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]], starting with [[A Hint of Fear]].

She also has a {{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen>}} gossip option:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|So, now that you've... changed... how do you feel?}}
:{{text|say|[[Magni Bronzebeard]]|I feel... humbled. Like I've carried a burden for a long time. Like I've finally been forgiven. I've had... debts to pay.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Forgiveness shouldn't be easy. When I was much younger, we clashed a lot. Some things... there were things I couldn't forgive you for.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|When you were in your... other state... I at least knew you were learning.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I didn't want to forgive you, and I didn't want you to forget what you've done... what you did.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|What changed your mind?}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Watching you and [[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]]. He sees you differently than I do. He sees who you've become. You're here for him.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Lass... my old life... I can't live my life that way.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Aye. You need to be here and do right... for both of us. You can see how much you mean to Dagran.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I understand. I've changed, and my life has changed. I don't want to live in the past. I want our family to have a future.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Then I'm glad we still have our future.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Onward and upward. On to the next adventure.}}
