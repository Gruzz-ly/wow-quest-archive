==Objectives==
Escort Berrund from the camp.
* Speak to [[Berrund the Gleaming|Berrund]]
* Escort Berrund

==Description==
You work good. Now they let you into ring to "fight" [[earthen]]. You go to ring when ready. Cinder-flash candles could go off any moment.

I head back to camp. Wait for you and earthen there.

You good one. No get killed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
;Fearbreaker completed
Now what are the chances of meeting you in a place like that? But this is no time for a reunion. I've got bad news.

;Fearbreaker not completed
Captured? No, I was just gathering information. And I've got bad news.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Scrit|You free the earthen. I meet you back at camp.}}
:''Scrit drops into stealth.''

Enter the ring and speak with [[Berrund the Gleaming]]:

{{Dialogue|<Name>, is that you under all that?

{{gossip|quest=|Get ready, the candles are about to explode!}}
}}

If you have not completed the [[Fearbreaker (quest)]] storyline, Berrund will have different gossip:
{{dialogue|Ugh! Each bug's uglier than the last!}}

This changes the phase, and players lose their disguise:
:{{text|say|Glumtooth Bruiser|That no bug. Smash it!}}
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|I was just waiting for my moment. You're welcome to tag along.}}

Fend off the two bruisers, without Berrund's help (as usual...) and he takes off. Keep up with him and two [[Glumtooth Trapper]]s attack:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|They're not eager to see us go. Handle them!}}

On the way, Berrund says one of the following lines at various intervals:
*{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Don't worry, I'll be right here!}}
*{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|I won't leave you behind!}}
*{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|To me, hero!}}
*{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|I'll wait for you here.}}

Three more kobolds in the next ambush:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|I'll leave this to you. You seem like you need the practice.}}

Outside of the kobold camp, Berrund runs off:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|You say you've got a camp nearby? I'll meet you there.}}

Catch up with Berrund and Scrit at her camp:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|...and that's when I threw <name> over my shoulder and broke through the kobolds' defenses.}}
:{{text|say|Scrit|That before or after you hide behind <name> like shield?}}

;On complete
Fearbreaker completed:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Good to see you again, <name>, but I fear that's not the end. That camp was just a part of the Glumtooth's operation.}} 
:{{text|say|Scrit|You know him? Good, then you work together to stop [[Boss Whiskerlash]] bug army. Already have many.}}
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|If this Whiskerlash has an army, we can't just take him head on. Don't worry, I'll come up with a better plan than that business with [[Moira]].}}

Fearbreaker not completed:
:{{Text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|We've struck a blow, but I fear that's not the end. That camp was just a part of the Glumtooth's operation!}}
:{{Text|say|Scrit|Yes. Boss Whiskerlash raise bug army. Already have many.}}
:{{Text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|If this Whiskerlash has an army, we can't just take him head on. I need time to strategize.}}

Berrund has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|Don't worry, I've fought worse beasties than these.}}

Scrit has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|Camp finished, but work not done. Whiskerlash remain. For now.}}
