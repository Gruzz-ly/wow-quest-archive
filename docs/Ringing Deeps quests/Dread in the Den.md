:{{text|say|Scrit|See you in den. Find my camp.}}

At Scrit's camp:
:{{text|say|Scrit|You no get lost? That good sign.}}

On complete, Scrit has gossip:

{{Dialogue|There kobold camp here, just over hill. Run by [[Boss Whiskerlash]], leader of Glumtooth Gang. They all Candle King cronies. They train for war on earthen. Must be stopped.

{{gossip|Why don't you have a candle?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Scrit young once. Not much in deeps for kobold. Fell in with Glumtooth Gang.

When Scrit older, learn more. Not much in deeps, true, but less if Boss Whiskerlash and Candle King get way.

So Scrit go to Whiskerlash. Say want leave. Whiskerlash take Scrit candle, say, "Where go now? You want dark take you?" Scrit fear dark, yes. But fear what happen if do nothing more. So Scrit stay. And plan.

<Scrit pats her head where a candle should be.>

This reminder. Whiskerlash and Candle King burn many candles. Use light to hide darkness in selfs.

Sometimes, only can see in dark when not blinded by light.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
