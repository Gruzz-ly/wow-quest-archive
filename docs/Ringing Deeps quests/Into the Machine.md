==Objectives==
Confront the [[High Speaker Eirich|High Speaker]] inside the [[Hall of Awakening]].
* Enter the Halls of Awakening
* Confront the High Speaker in the Halls of Awakening

==Description==
No time to catch our breath! The High Speaker is fleeing to the [[earthen]]'s most sacred machine. We need to follow him.

Remember, we're doing this for the earthen! For justice! For all the brothers and sisters and comrades who've fallen to the High Speaker's hubris!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|70|20}}
*16,300 [[XP]]
* [[Esteemed Earthen Emblem]]

==Completion==
He's gone? He's really gone?

As far as I'm considered, he just abdicated his authority. I don't know where he fled, and I don't care. Now that the Awakening Machine is operational again, we can step up and set things right.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Brinthe is already inside the Hall of Awakening. Let's move!}}
:''Moira, Dagran, and Magni run forward and through the instance line, though Moira stops short.''

Speak with Moira:
{{dialogue|We must make haste, <name>.

{{gossip|quest=|We're with you, Moira.}}

After the loading screen, players are in a scenario set in the [[Halls of Awakening]]:

===Stage 1: In Pursuit===
*Follow the trail of the High Speaker into the Hall of Awakening.
:A pair of [[Ceremonial Sentinel]]s flank the entrance, and [[Gearsweep]]s roam the hall.
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I can hardly believe it! This place dates back to the time of the titans...}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Time for that later, Dagran! We've a fight on our hands!}}
:{{text|emote|Moira Thaurissan looks up ahead.}}
:''Dagran, Moira, and Magni walk up to [[Ostiary Wystan]], who is blocking the path:''
:{{text|say|Ostiary Wystan|High Speaker Eirich refuses your entry!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Ostiary Wystan|High Speaker... will... prevail!}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I'll get the door. Lead the way, <name>!}}
:''Dagran uses Earthen Unlocking to open the door.''

Downstairs, before the next set of doors, [[Master Machinist Dunstan]] opens them and runs off, sounding the alarm:
:{{text|say|Master Machinist Dunstan|Intruders! Activate the defenses!}}

Defeat the [[Machinist Protector]] that attacks, then run into the [[Firewall of Negation]] to advance stages.''

===Stage 2: Security Breach===
:''Deactivate the defenses.''
* [[Ironfuse Bomb]] collected
* [[Inferno Sprayer]] destroyed (4)
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|<Name>! Those bombs have enough firepower to destroy the turrets!}}

Pick up an Ironfuse Bomb, staying off the grates while doing so, and use the extra action button to target the ground beneath the Inferno Sprayer turrets that are shooting fireballs all over the arena. They hurt! A well-placed bomb toss can destroy two sprayers at once. While navigating the room, walking over the lava grates will apply the ''Fire Patch'' debuff.

Destroy all four sprayers and the remaining Machinist Protectors to move on.

===Stage 3: Journey Onward===
*Journey deeper into the Hall of Awakening.
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Hurry! We need to catch up to Brinthe!}}

Dagran uses Earthen Unlock to keep pushing westward through two doors.

===Stage 4: Activate the Runelock===
*Help Dagran activate the Runelock sequence.
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|We're near the Stonevault. That's where the dormant earthen are stored.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|And if those earthen awaken as skardyn...}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Get those doors open, lad! And fast!}}

The doorway opens into a circular room, the [[Processing Unit]]. Turn left and take the northward (clockwise) path while clearing enemies, [[High Speaker's Construct]]s and Machinist Protector, on the way to the [[Earthen Console (Hall of Awakening)|Earthen Console]] that Dagran runs to. Interact with it to continue.

===Stage 5: Skardyn Breakout===
:Protect Dagran while he solves the Runelock combination.
*Defend Dagran while he solves the Runelock combination. (0/100%)
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|This configuration... I've read about this, Proper alignment of the runes should open the way.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|All these skardyn... twisted into something they never asked to become...}}

Skardyn of various forms stream in to attack from all sides, including [[Deranged Skardyn]], [[Deviant Skardyn]], [[Enraged Skardyn]], [[Skardyn Remnants]], [[Skardyn Metamorphosis]], and a [[Void Crystal Monstrosity]].

At around 30%:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Stay near me, champion. I'll heal yer wounds.}}

At 40% and 60%:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Almost done here...}}

Finishing off the Void Crystal Monstrosity should be enough to fill the bar when it appears at around 70%.

===Stage 6: Twin Guardinas===
:''Defeat the twin golems that defend the entrance to the Awakening Machine.''
*Enter the [[Annihilation Interface]]
*[[Earthen-Ward Sentinel]] defeated
*[[Iron-Runed Protector]] defeated
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I've got it.  We can proceed.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|So many skardyn... If only we'd known about them sooner...}}
:''The party runs west to the door to the next room and Dagran does his thing to open it once again.''
:{{text|say|High Speaker Eirich|So you're relentless... vindictive... and misguided. Perhaps my golems can show you the error of your ways.}}

In the next room, the two golems (and two [[Machinist Protector]]s) attack. Moira and Magni will tank. One of the golems will start off immune, so attack the other. They'll swap immunity bubbles at 50%, so focus on the non-immune golem first.

Defeat all enemies to continue.

===Stage 7: The Awakening Machine===
:''Enter the final chamber of the Halls of Awakening.''
*Enter the [[Awakening Machine|final chamber]]
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I'll be damned if I let Brinthe's people be turned into monsters!}}
:''Dagran opens the final door.''
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|This room seems different. Do the walls seem... older... to you?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I've seen rooms like this before. There's titan machinery in here!}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Outside, the earthen rebuilt the machines... but the oldest ones remain unchanged!}}

Follow the party into the last room.

===Stage 8: Vigilance and Violence===
:''Defeat Master Machinist Dunstan.''
*[[Master Machinist Dunstan]] defeated
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|It's time to step down, High Speaker. Everyone knows what you've done.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Eirich|What I've done? Saved us all? I have found a path to our salvation!}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|You would have us all live as skardyn?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Eirich|Better to live as a skardyn than die as an earthen.}}

Take out High Machinist Dunstan's mech, and then Master Machinist Dunstan himself to continue.

===Final Stage: King of the Dwarves===
*Confront High Speaker Eirich at the Awakening Machine.
:''Brinthe, Dagran, Magni, and Moira all run up to the High Speaker, suspended in a bubble held up by void lines of power.''

Run up to him and a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|pre-rendered in-game cutscene]] plays, Magni's Sacrifice:

{{#ev:youtube|Hi3t2_PYpX8|Magni's Sacrifice}}

''Interior, the Awakening Machine. Magni and Dagran stop at the base of the steps before High Speaker Eirich.''

{{text|bossemote|High Speaker Eirich|It is done! Now, with this power, all Earthen shall awaken.}}

''A void portal opens behind Eirich and he backs into it as he chuckles before it closes. Magni, Dagran, Moira, and Brinthe stand, dumbstruck. Tendrils of void wrap around the dormant earthen all over the room.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|We've lost them all.}}

''Magni sighs as he lowers his head, closing his eyes for a moment.''

{{text|bossemote|Mangi Bronzebeard|It's over.}}

{{text|bossemote|Dagran Thaurissan II|Granda, you can stop this. I've seen you wield Azeroth's gift.}}

''Dagran puts his right hand on Magni's chest.''

{{text|bossemote|Dagran Thaurissan II|It's you. You're the only one who can save them.}}

''Magni looks down at Dagran, then jerks his head up as light pours from his eyes. Magni is seeing a vision of the World Soul, still glowing like the surface of a star.''

{{text|bossemote|World Soul|Magni...}}

''The vision fades, and Magni looks around.''

{{text|bossemote|World Soul|...it is time.}}

''As the voice of the world soul echoes, Magni turns to look at Dagran, who smiles back at him. Magni faces forward, lowers his eyes for a moment as he steels himself, then takes a few steps forward. He drops to his knees, closes his eyes, and spreads his arms, palms up. A light starts glowing from Magni's body as Moira and Dagran look on. They share a look.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|Azeroth, let your blessing pass to them.}}

''Magni's light brightens, then explodes across the room, burning away the void clouds. The earthen in stasis all glow like Magni does until the light gets so bright that it whites out the room.''

''As the light fades, Moira and Dagran look around the room. The earthen appear to be saved. As Dagran starts smiling, he turns to look at Magni, and stops. Magni is frozen like a statue, the life gone from him. Shocked, Dagran runs over as Moira gives him a concerned look. Dagran gingerly reaches his right hand out to touch Magni.''

{{text|bossemote|Dagran Thaurissan II|You did it, Granda. You saved them.}}

''Dagran breaks into tears and sobs into Magni's chest. Moira walks up and places her left hand on Dagran's left shoulder, and Dagran turns to hug her. As Moira holds Dagran's head, a tear falls from her eye.''

''Some whooshing distracts Moira, and she turns to look at Magni. Cracks form on his skin and spots of light shine brightly through them. Dagran and Moira both get to their feet as the light whites out the room. As it fades, Magni appears to have lost his stone form and Moira and Dagran rush to catch him. Magni pants as he shares a look with his daughter and grandson. He pulls the two of them into a hug.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|She let me go.}}

''Some approaching footsteps snap them out of the moment, and the dwarves all turn to look at the [[Dawn|first earthen to awaken]].''

{{text|bossemote|Awakened Earthen|You woke me. Who are you?}}

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|I'm...}}

''He stops to look at his left hand, made of skin instead of diamond for the first time in years.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|Magni.}}

{{text|bossemote|Awakened Earthen|Magni. But who am I?}}

''The awakened earthen looks at her right hand, echoing Magni's motions.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|Whoever you want to be.}}

''The awakened earthen lowers her hand and looks at Dagran, Magni, Moira, and Brinthe.''
