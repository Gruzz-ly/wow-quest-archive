==Objectives==
Prepare the recitation site.
* [[Stuck Minecart]] moved
* [[Mislaid Tool]] (3)
* Plaque [[Stubborn Moss|cleaned]]

==Description==
Once a year, [[Brennok]] and I take the long road through The [[Ringing Deeps]].

We stop at each outpost, and Brennok tells the residents a story from their past. One they entrusted to him to remember, even when they forget.

It's my duty to ready the ceremony site. Would you come with me? I could use the help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Brennok usually seems more excited for a recitation.

==Completion==
Thank you. I hope you'll join us for the recitation when the time comes.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|We're going to the recitation site, Brennok. Try not to wander Off.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|Of course. Where would I even go?}}
:''Haimaz wanders off.''

Pick up [[The Common Costume]] from [[Brennok]] before chasing after her.

Just north, find Haimaz near the minecart rail:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|Seems they have more pressing concerns here than cleaning. Could you tidy while I hang the ornaments?}}

Interact with the objects:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|Brennok's role isn't easy. He must keep his life simple. To keep the stories from being overwritten by his own experiences.}}
:{{text|say|Haimaz|I swore to watch over him. Guide him. Care for the parts of his life his oath keeps him from partaking in.}}
:{{text|say|Haimaz|He's never even left The Ringing Deeps. I worry for him. How long can a person live without their own experiences?}}

After cleaning a [[Memorial Plaque (Ringing Deeps)|Memorial Plaque]], it becomes readable:
{{Book|Memorial Plaque|content=
Here we record those lost to the depths.<br>
May their names never fade, even as they pass from our memory.

Durgur, who plotted the deeps.

Kharrag, taken by stillness.

Berthok, the Pillar. Lost saving others from cave-in.

Krannock, swept away by uncharted currents.

Tholde, whose pick never dulled.
}}
 
On complete of both:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|<Name>, do you have a moment?}}

==Progression==
