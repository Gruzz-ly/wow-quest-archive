==Objectives==
Meet Orweyna at [[Camp Murroch]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]].

==Description==
My vision was clear to me. I need to continue this work.

I need to find out how we can stop the [[Black Blood]] from spreading, before it's too late for your people, and for mine.

Meet me in Deeps. I will be in a form that allows me to hide and to listen without anyone noticing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
There seem to be goblins everywhere now.

Do not look too closely at me, or you will draw attention. We need to get closer to where the goblins are working.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|The vision-- we are close. But I must remain unseen by the people there.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Look for me in another form. At least I can honor one haranir tradition.}}
:Orweyna turns into her bat form and takes off.

Follow Orweyna into Camp Murroch where a Goblin named [[Haxle Drillbit]] is talking to [[Lugger Aklin]].
:{{Text|Say|Haxle Drillbit|Get lost, you lump of rock! These items are now the property of Opportunity Acquisitions. Where we acquire at every opportunity!}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|Hey, <name>! Nice timing. We got trouble brewing.}}
