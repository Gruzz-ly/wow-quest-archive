==Objectives==
Stand in gas vents near [[Hallowfall Gate]] as they erupt to gather samples.
*[[Unstable Ground|Gas samples collected]] (8)

==Description==
The effects of the magmatic buildup are clear to see, but what we still do not understand is the root cause.

In order to determine it, and prevent it in the future, I need samples of the volcanic gases you can see bursting from the ground.

Fresh samples. Very fresh.

You're going to have to stand in them as they erupt in order to gather what I need.

*{{cost|23|40}}
