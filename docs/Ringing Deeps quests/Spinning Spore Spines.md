==Objectives==
Collect 150 Spore Spines for [[Munderut]].
* [[Spore Spines]] (150)
*Bring the spines to Munderut near the refinery

==Description==
[[Orsenth]] sent you? And we are supposedly fused? Why... so I am wearing a medallion. But I have no memory... Well, no time for that.

Did you see the spinning spores on your way here? I need the spines that they grow for... I need them for... now what was it again? Oh yes! There is no better instrument for carving out the fine detail that my work as a gem carver requires than those spines. Will you collect some?

I will make my way back to the refinery. I am eager to get back and meet this Orsenth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Why, what is this now? You are a stranger to these depths, are you not? What are you doing here?

<You remind him of all you've spoken of.>

Well what are you waiting for, then? Go and get me those spines!

==Completion==
Where did you come from? Who are you?

I do not know how you knew I needed these spines, but I thank you. There is no better instrument for carving out the fine detail that my work as a gem carver requires. I am a gem carver, you see!

Have you met my new friend Orsenth? What- what was I saying?

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Munderut|This Orsenth sounds intriguing. I should get back to the refinery and introduce... meet... I should talk to her.}}

Slay [[Underground Spore]]s to collect [[Spore Spines]] from them. Then return back to Orsenth.

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Orsenth|Here is the stranger I was telling you about, [[Keldaz]].}}

Munderut has new gossip:
{{dialogue|
:Down in glittering depths
:Guarded by living rock
:Seek ye neither silt nor sand
:But that most elusive of jewels
:Then, the reconstructive crystal
:may{{sic}} one day be yours
