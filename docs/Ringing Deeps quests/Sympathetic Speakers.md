[[File:Sympathetic Speakers.jpg|thumb|[[Speaker Brinthe]] and [[Foreman Otan]]]]

==Objectives==
Look for [[Machine Speakers|Machine Speaker]] Foremen in the [[Earthenworks]] with [[Speaker Brinthe]].
* Confront [[Foreman Gesa]] {{co|50.2|21.0|Ringing Deeps}}
* Confront [[Foreman Otan]]
* Confront [[Foreman Uzjax]] {{co|49.0|17.4|Ringing Deeps}}

==Description==
I have to stop the High Speaker from making more [[skardyn]].

Machine Speaker protocol dictates that one of the foremen in this area should have a key to the [[Hall of Awakening]]. Come with me, and we'll track it down!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This should get us into the Hall of Awakening...

==Notes==
On accept, Brinthe joins the party and follows the player around:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|We require a foreman's key to access the Hall of Awakening.}}

[[Foreman Gesa]] is at the southeastern end of the quest area:
{{dialogue|Defiant! Non-compliant! The Awakening Machine is all that matters.

{{gossip|quest=|Can you help us?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Gesa|Brinthe! Speaker detected. The High Speaker warned us about you!}}

Fend her off, then head northwest to find [[Foreman Otan]]:
{{dialogue|Return to your stations!

{{gossip|quest=|Can you help us?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Otan|You should have remained on the surface, Speaker Brinthe.}}

Find [[Foreman Uzjax]] inside a room on the lower level of a building not far from where the quest started:
:{{text|say|Foreman Uzjax|Brinthe, I... don't know what to believe anymore. My efficiency is... impaired.}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Uzjax|Take my access key. Never did like the High Speaker's pomposity.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|The High Speaker must be stopped. Regroup with Moira. I'll head for the Hall of Awakening.}}
:''Brinthe runs off.''

If players completed [[Battle of the Earthenworks]] first, Foreman Uzjax will start [[Return to Moira]].
