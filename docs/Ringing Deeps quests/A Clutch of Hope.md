Bring the egg to Nebb.
*[[Broodmother's Egg]] (provided)

<The broodmother lies dead, coiled around a single egg. She gave her life to keep it from the spiders.

You should take it to [[Nebb]]. He and the other [[Grubtenders]] would know what to do with it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What this, another egg?

==Completion==
This not just any egg. Mother egg.

<Nebb takes the egg from you. He holds it with reverence.>

With this, grubs not just survive. They thrive. Thank you. We protect.

==Notes==
Inside [[Queen Rickiticka]]'s cave, players will find the corpse of the [[Jawcrawler Broodmother]] wrapped around the [[:Broodmother's Egg]], which starts this quest.

Completing the quest awards the "Envenomed Invasion" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
