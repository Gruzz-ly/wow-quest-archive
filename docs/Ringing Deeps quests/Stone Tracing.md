==Objectives==
Scan remnants of the golem to triangulate its location.
* Golem location triangulated (3)
* [[Triangulation Matrix]] (provided)

==Description==
Couldn't help overhearing. Not to brag, but [[goblin]]s are specialists in the field of rampaging [[robot]]s.

If [[Corrupted Golem|that golem]]'s as unstable as Danagh says, it'll be leaking all sorts of energy. Take this, run a few scans, and you'll find it. Oh, and be careful. Animals tend to go a little cuckoo when you power this thing on.

No charge--a murderous golem's bad for business. And I kinda feel bad making you work just to find a dead guy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Curious. It seemed to be wandering along the river. Unimportant, we have its location. We will find it and decommission it.

==Notes==
Upon using the {{Abilities|Triangulation Matrix|id=452940|icon=10prof_portabletable_engineering01}} on the first location:
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|Do not wander--I must monitor the data.}}
:''A couple of [[Rummaging Mudnose]]s appear.''
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|Data received.}}

On the second location:
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|Stay close while I monitor the device.}}
:''A couple of [[Furious Skipper]]s appear.''
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|Scan complete.}}

On the third location:
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|Keep me close to the device while it works.}}
:''A couple of [[Agitated Shalewing]]s appear.''
:{{text|say|Danagh's Cogwalker|Data received.}}
