==Objectives==
Scout out and distribute pamphlets across the [[Warrens]] from the air.
*Hop on a flying mount (Optional)
*Scout a safe area
*Pamphlets distributed (120)

==Description==
Before take mines, my people live in great city. [[Earthen|Stoneheads]] call it the Warrens.

[[The Candle King|Candle King]]'s bullies run it now. We need see what we are fighting. Let [[kobold]]s know we here to help! Better choices than Candle King.

What better way than pamphlets? Everyone love pamphlet! We draw real good!

Brinthe say you have some sort of flying dragon-bird-thing? Perfect for scout! Perfect for dropping pamphlets!

<[[Skitter]] looks at you expectantly, making small flapping motions as she waits.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Never flown before. Is fun?

==Completion==
Sad to see home in such state.

But we fix!

==Notes and trivia==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Skitter|We show kobolds in Warrens they no need Candle King!}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|It seems I underestimated the problem. And you, Skitter.}}
:{{text|say|Skitter|At least you take action, stonehead. That better than other earthen.}}
:''They walk off.''

Head southeast to the [[Warrens]] and watch out for the flare that Skitter sets off, indicating the safe area:
:{{text|say|Skitter|Brinthe and Skitter find good place to set up! Flare out!}}

Fly through the rings to machine gun pamphlets all over the city.
:{{text|say|Skitter|See! Kobold build great city. Big towers, lots of room!}}
:{{text|say|Skitter|Many jobs, too! Candle making, wax harvest, scrap salvage... many!}}
:{{text|say|Skitter|Used to be happy place. Now bullies and fear everywhere.}}

Upon completion, [[Skitter]] has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|Long time since I feel hope, <race>. Almost forget how.}}
