==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Smaragthr.jpg|Smaraghtr|Deadly sharp pinchers clack with rock crushing force, but it's of Smaragthr's venomous tail that one must be most alert.}}
Kill Smaragthr.
* Place the meaty bait (Optional)
* [[Smaragthr]] slain
* [[Scorpion Bait]] (provided)

==Description==
I suppose I should come clean and tell you why I had you gather that meat.

Truth is, there's a horrible beast who lives down in the [[Rumbling Wastes|Wastes]]. A monster who feeds on the unwary and whose pincers can snap through stone and bone like a knife through warm butter.

Its name is Smaragthr, and the foul thing is the reason I have but one eye and my gems are cracked. I am no match for it, but you... you could enact my vengeance.

Kill Smaragthr so the Wastes can be free!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*10,850 [[XP]]
*{{wb|repitem=The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation|repamount=500|faction=The Assembly of the Deeps|qty=180|currency=Resonance Crystals|altqty1=205|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
I will have my revenge on that vile creature!

==Completion==
You did it! I hope you made it hurt.

==Notes==
Head south to the marked spot on the map and interact with the ghost Meaty Bait to place the [[Scorpion Bait]].

Completing the quest awards the "Revenge in the Rumbling Wastes" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
