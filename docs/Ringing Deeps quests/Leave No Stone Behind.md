==Objectives==
Recover Identification Plaques from fallen [[earthen]] in the [[Lost Mines]].
* [[Earthen Identification Plaque]] (4)

==Description==
Many earthen fell when the [[kobold]]s took this mine.

Worse, those who fell were left to crumble where they dropped. There was no attempt to recover them. We couldn't provide closure or respect their memories. Why? Why did we forsake the fallen?

We will not fail them again, <name>. Gather the identification plaques of those we lost, so we may commemorate them properly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
* 10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found them?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. The fallen will be remembered.

The earthen above us have their own rituals of remembrance, and the Machine Speakers have procedures in place.

There's a plinth in [[Gundargaz|the town square]] with the plaques of the fallen. [[Speaker Jurlax|Jurlax]] will ensure that the proper observances are performed... along with process checks and a recalculation of worker allocation. Work never stops here.

==Notes==
[[File:Fallen Earthen.jpg|thumb|A [[Fallen Earthen]]]]
Pick up [[Kobold Shoulder]] and [[Death and Waxes]] before heading out. On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Considering theory: if we depose this Candle King, then perhaps the raids on Gundargaz will cease.}}

[[Fallen Earthen]] are marked on the minimap. The first one looted contains a [[Faded Memory Gem]], which starts [[Broken Memories]]. The four earthen contain a unique plaque:

*[[Earthen Identification Plaque 0985e438]]
*[[Earthen Identification Plaque 1103a572]]
*[[Earthen Identification Plaque 2672b138]]
*[[Earthen Identification Plaque 3481a662]]

On return after completing all quest objectives:
:{{text|say|Skitter|...and that all the ways hygiene effect{{sic}} quality of ear wax!}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|That was certainly an...exhaustive list. I would never have imagined all the uses of mammals' waxy secretions.}}

==Progression==
{{By Candlelight}}
