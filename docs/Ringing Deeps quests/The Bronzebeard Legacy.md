'''The Bronzebeard Legacy''' concludes the optional Fearbreaker chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Moira Thaurissan]] in [[Gundargaz]].

==Description==
Well, we did what we set out tae do... and more. We found [[Fearbreaker]] and did some good with it.

Now it's time tae bring it back tae [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]].

Let's hope [[Berrund the Gleaming|Berrund]] learned a lesson here, but I suspect he'll manage tae get himself in trouble again soon. Hopefully, it'll be fer the right reasons an' with the right support.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,350 [[XP]]
* [[Fearbreaker's Echo]]
*{{wb|repitem=The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation|repamount=500|faction=The Assembly of the Deeps|qty=180|currency=Resonance Crystals|altqty1=205|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Completion==
It's funny. I can see why me Da' was so fond o' this hammer. And what it meant when he trusted others tae hold onto it.

Fearbreaker's got a mind of its own, in ways. It wants what it wants.

I suppose I relate.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|I...  we... have saved the day! And the [[earthen]] will be forever grateful for your help, Moira.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I'm sure ye'll remember me. And take care. Don't forget tae do the right things fer the right reasons. Now I've got tae get back tae Gundargaz.}}
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Henceforth and always! I will be known far and wide in [[Khaz Algar]] and beyond! For we are made of the mountains themselves.}}
:''Moira steps away, mounts up, and flies away to the northwest.''

Before leaving, Berrund has gossip:

{{Dialogue|Another day saved! Another tale of heroic deeds to tell!

{{gossip|Uh... You sure about that?}}

Why yes!

<Berrund glances at the other Earthen nearby. He lowers his voice.>

Look, I apologize for leaving you to fight that beastie yourself. I never intended to get anyone killed, or worse, angry with me.

<He raises his voice again.>

But look at you, you came out of it just fine! Perhaps we will run into each other again, where there is danger, and there are deeds to be done!

{{gossip|<Stare hard at Berrund the Gleaming.>}}

I mean it! I think we work very well together!

<Berrund stands silently, giving you a confused look.>

What?

<Berrun{{Sic}} conveniently stares off into the distance.>

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Here's yer hammer, ye stubborn old ram. I found it sure enough.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Nay, ye should keep it, my girl. It's sittin' solid in yer hands, like it belongs there. As it was meant tae.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|This isn't some sort o' test? Some trick tae make me accept a certain legacy?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Yer a [[Bronzebeard]], through and through, it don't take Fearbreaker tae make that clear. I just ask that one day, when ye know it's time, tae pass it on.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Aye. But fer now, I'll keep good care o' it. Thanks, Da'.}}

{{Stub-section|quest}}
Moira has new gossip before the conversation completes:

The storyline continues with [[Scrit]] at [[Shadowvein Point]], who starts [[Dread in the Den]], though it is possible to start this questline before and the quest text will be different.

Completing the quest awards the "Fearbreaker" criterion of [[Sojourner of The Ringing Deeps]].
