==Objectives==
Check papers at the [[Overseer's Desk]] in [[Opportunity Point]].
*Get behind the desk
*Troublemakers dealt with (6)

==Description==
Hey pal, what's it gonna take to get you to leave me alone? 

How about a trip? A POWER trip...

I told [[Boss Sparkshot]] that I would man the worksite's...er, resort's! Yeah, that I would man the resort's front desk for a bit.

Care to take my place? It's just your usual paper-pushing busy work. Check credentials, keep an eye out for corporate sabotage, call in the occasional air strike, etcetera, etcetera...

<[[Garv Gearwhistle|Garv]] has already fallen back asleep.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're in my shade, pal.

==Completion==
<Garv throws something at you without glancing up.>

==Notes==
On accept, [[Arriving Prospector]]s start streaming into town from the elevator. Interact with the [[Overseer's Desk]] to gain access to two abilities:
*{{abilities|Call Over|Call someone over to the desk.|range=30|cd=5 sec|notes=Instant}}
*{{abilities|Call Airstrike|Call in an airstrike on the target location. Coming in hot!|range=50|notes=1 sec cast}}

Use Call Over on passing prospectors. If they're fine, they'll say one of:
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|Can ya break a twenty?}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|I've got the best documentation money can buy!}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|I've got ya papers right here!}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|Papers? Oh yeah!}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|Take my money! Er, papers!}}

If they're a troublemaker, they'll turn unfriendly and run off. Use the Call Airstrike action (lead them a bit!) to take them out:
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|All your proprietary secrets belong to us!}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|I reject your authority and substitute my own!}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|Just because you asked... NO!}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|Rats, I've been made!}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|The boss is gonna want to hear about this place!}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|They said the payout would be huge! I gotta escape!}}
*{{text|say|Arriving Prospector|Time to make like a plunger and blow this pineapple stand!}}
