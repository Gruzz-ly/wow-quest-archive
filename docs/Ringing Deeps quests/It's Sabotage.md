==Objectives==
Wreak havoc, gain access to the [[Deepforge Manufacturing Bay|manufacturing bay]], and restart the facility.
* Mayhem Caused (0/100%)
* Speak to [[Speaker Brinthe|Brinthe]]{{co|56.1|77.6|Ringing Deeps}}
* Facility Activated and Secured

==Description==
We're back, and we're ready.

You and [[ZZ-01-47]] head in and cause some mayhem. Blow stuff and make a mess that will draw them out of the manufacturing bay. I'll use the commotion to sneak inside. Join me when you're able, and we should have a chance at reactivating the facility and driving them out.

We don't need to defeat them all. Defeating the Darkfuse leader supervising this operation should break their resolve.

The Darkfuse lackeys will clear out when the coin stops flowing.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Saboteur's Shoulderpads]]
* [[Saboteur's Grips]]
* [[Saboteur's Striders]]
* [[Saboteur's Girdle]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 XP
* +500 reputation with [[Assembly of the Deeps]] or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]]

==Completion==
It was touch and go there for a bit. But if anyone could seize a victory out of this, I knew it would be you.

Please return to the Emissary in Dornogal and communicate our victory. Go with my thanks, and with the knowledge that the Machine Speakers are indebted to you. Again.

==Notes==
Players regain the Arc Emitter extra action button from before. Head into the [[Deepforge Golemworks]] and interact with stuff to fill the bar. Steer clear of [[Derelict Golem]]s and [[Goblin Battery|Goblin Batteries]], as they take a long time for Zee-Zee to charge, spawning waves of enemies and an elite! Kegs and Grill Racks are near-instant, however.

At 30%:
:{{text|say|[[Supervisor Radlock]]|Is everybody on a break or something? Drop those mugs and go see what's going on!}}

Trying to enter the [[Deepforge Manufacturing Bay]] before completing the objective will get the player character thrown back by the [[Mechanized Enforcer]]:
:{{text|say|Mechanized Enforcer|No visitors!}}

Once the bar is full, head to Brinthe in the [[Deepforge Manufacturing Bay]]:
{{dialogue|I'll try to get this power station up and running.

Be warned that we may attract some trouble once they see what we're up to.

{{gossip|quest=|Let's do this.}}}}
:{{text|yell|Supervisor Radlock|Hey, what's going on in here?}}

Fend him off. Consider using the Furnace Blasts to help damage Radlock's mech.

At 40%, Radlock knocks the adventurer away, and a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-engine cinematic]] plays:

{{#ev:youtube|yPbzSaqnM-I|It's Sabotage}}

''Interior, Deepforge Golem Bay. The adventurer is on their back after the blow from Radlock's mech, which walks over and picks up the adventurer in it's left claw.''

{{text|bossemote|Supervisor Radlock|Looks like you should've brought some bigger friends.}}

{{text|bossemote|Brinthe|Guess what? WE DID. Now, Zee-Zee!}}

''Zee-Zee fires off a massive bolt of lightning at the inactive golem in the corner, charging it instantly! It activates, and with some heavy steps, rushes over to Radlock and his mech. With a heavy overhand blow, the golem destroys the mech, flinging Radlock from it.''

{{text|bossemote|Brinthe|Facility reactivated!}}

''Various devices whirr to life.''

{{text|bossemote|Brinthe|War Golems are active and back in production.}}

''Outside, as the golems activate, the occupying goblins cower in fear.''

{{text|bossemote|Supervisor Radlock|Pack it up team! I know when we're beaten...}}

''The adventurer has gotten to their feet and is staring Radlock down. Radlock runs out of the building.''

After the cutscene, turn in to Brinthe.
