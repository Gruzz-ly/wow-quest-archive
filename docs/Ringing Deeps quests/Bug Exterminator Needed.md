==Objectives==
Kill Bloodfeasters inside [[Sanity's Rest|the cave]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]].
*[[Bloodfeaster (Ringing Deeps)|Bloodfeaster]] slain (20)

==Description==
Well, if ya really wanna help... 

We're safe in this cave from the [[Black Blood]]--or we were until it was crawlin' with nasty bloodfeasters. 

The ugly little creeps always had a taste for blood--but now they're gonzo for Black Blood! I got a hunch they're spreadin' Black Blood poisonin' when they bite us. 

I can't work like this. Each time I see one in a scrap pile, I wanna scream. They're gross, an' I don't wanna get bit an' start seein' things. 

Stomp 'em flat so we can keep safe an' keep workin'!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
<Humming a catchy tune.>

Ahh!

Oh, I thought you were another bloodfeaster.

==Completion==
Bleh. Disgusting, but effective. Now I can get back to work!

==Notes==
Just run them over. No need to engage them in combat.
