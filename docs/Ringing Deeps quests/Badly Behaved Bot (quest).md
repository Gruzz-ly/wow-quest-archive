==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kagfritha]] in [[Shadowvein Point]].

==Description==
Go ahead, laugh. I would be as well if I didn't have such pressing business. [[Badly Behaved Bot|My bot]]'s foot clipped a nearby rock, spilled me out and then righted herself. Without me in the cockpit! 

I'm grounded while she floats there quite cheerfully. Can you believe it?

Listen, if you are heading up to Shadowvein Point, will you let Kagfritha know that I'll be late for my shift? I need to wait for this hunk of metal to run out of fuel and dip low enough for me to get back in the driver's seat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*5,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Sinruna got tossed again, did she? I keep telling her she's flying too low. Maybe this'll knock some sense into her.

==Notes==
Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Sinruna|Hurry up and run out of fuel, you hunk of scrap metal!}}

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Sinruna|Tell Kagfritha I'll be along soon. I hope.}}

==Progression==
{{Revenge in the Rumbling Wastes}}
