'''Back to Gundargaz''' concludes the By Candlelight chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]]. The next chapter begins immediately after, with [[A Wrench in the Works]]. Additionally, [[Skitter]] starts an optional quest: [[Home Is Where the Candle Is]].

==Objectives==
Return to [[Gundargaz]].

==Description==
We may not have overthrown [[the Candle King]], but our work here has surely relieved some of the pressure facing Gundargaz. And it's made us more than a few new allies, as well.

Our new friends will not be forgotten, on my word as Speaker. There is a...regrettable amount of available housing in Gundargaz as of late. It will be nice to feel the city come to life again, and we can certainly use the manpower.

Shall we bring them home, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,350 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[The Assembly of the Deeps Commendation]] (+2500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 125x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Completion==
I'm glad to be back, but this gathering is... troubling.

Looks like discontent is growing.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|I am sorry for what has happened to your people. I understand what it feels like to watch your home slip away.}}
:{{text|say|Skitter|At least we friends now, yes? Not all is doom. More friends means less doom.}}
:''Brinthe and Skitter walk away.''

Return west to Gundargaz, where [[High Speaker Eirich]] has deigned to make an appearance, and a great number of [[Agitated Machine Speaker|agitated]] (3), [[Complacent Machine Speaker|complacent]] (5), [[Concerned Machine Speaker|concerned]] (3), [[Reassured Machine Speaker|reassured]] (5), and [[Traditionalist Machine Speaker|traditionalist]] (5) [[Machine Speaker]]s have gathered in audience. Additionally, [[Confused Machine Speaker]]s are chatting with [[Emigrating Kobold]]s, and [[Pack Mole]]s pulling [[Moving Wagon]]s filled with more Emigrating Kobolds are constantly arriving.

Outside Brinthe's home, Skitter, [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Dagran Thaurissan II]], and [[Magni Bronzebeard]] are waiting:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|The Candle King may still hold power, Skitter, but your people have a home in Gundargaz.}}
:{{text|say|Skitter|We help new friends. Many hands make light work.}}

==Progression==
{{By Candlelight}}
