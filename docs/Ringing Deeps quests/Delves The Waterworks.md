==Objectives==
Complete the Waterworks [[delve]] on any difficulty.
*[[Waterworks (delve)|Waterworks delves]] completed on any difficulty

==Description==
What a trip! Can ye believe how much exists below the depths here? 

The [[Machine Speakers]] were telling me of problems they're having over at a place called The Waterworks. Sounds like [[kobold]]s are making trouble again. They're also storing some treasure deeper within the place.

What do ye say? Let's go on an adventure and help out these folks!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27|}}
* 15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Companion Experience]]
*100x [[Resonance Crystals]]

==Completion==
In and out. No problems at all!

Except for this trapped chest in front of us.

==Notes==
Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Some place called the Waterworks is overrun by kobolds? And ye say it has treasure in there too?}}
:{{text|say|[[Waterworks Laborer]]|Information verified. Urgent aid is required to recover it.}}

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Leave it to me and <name> to take care of your kobold problem at the Waterworks!}}

See [[Waterworks#Walkthrough]] for a description of the events inside the delve.

Upon exiting the Waterworks delve you see a nerubian treasure chest infront of you:
:{{text|say|Look here! There's a treasure chest just out in the open. Looks nerubian in nature.}}
