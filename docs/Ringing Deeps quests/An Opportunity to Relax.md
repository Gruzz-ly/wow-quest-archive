'''An Opportunity to Relax''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]], started by [[Mindi Maxlof]] at the [[Pillarstone Spire]] south of [[Gundargaz]].

Nearby, a [[Rusted Lever]] starts [[Rust and Redemption]].

==Objectives==
Pass out 6 flyers to tired workers in and around [[Gundargaz]].
* Flyers Handed Out (6)
* [[Stack of Flyers]] (provided)

==Description==
Hey, you! Yeah, you'll do. You wanna make some coin? We's tryin' to drum up business at our exclusive resort. Maybe ye heard of it? [[Opportunity Point|Opportunity Point Spa and Resort]]!

Boss sent me up to Gundargaz to pass out this stack of flyers, but my [[trike]] blew a gasket and I'll be stuck here for a bit repairing her. How's about you head up there and pass them out for me? Look for the tired and weary types.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}

I shoulda listened to my mechanic. He told me there was no way my trike was gonna make it all the way up here, but my boss has been on me to get more clients.

Did you pass out those flyers yet?

You're back! How did it go? Should we start preparing for large crowds?
