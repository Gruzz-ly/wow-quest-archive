[[File:Not Waste Not Want.jpg|thumb|A [[Sizzling Barrel]] and [[Intriguing Scrap]]]]


==Objectives==
Collect potentially useful scrap from around the [[Warrens]].
* [[Useful Looking Scrap]] (24)
* [[Unstable Cinderbrew Barrel]] (3)

==Description==
Everything have use, friend. Even things [[Earthen|stoneheads]] throw away and think worthless.

[[Kobold]]s know better.

Go and see what you can find. Need to scavenge lots of scrap. Enough for kobold crafting of new homes!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You will be surprised. Kobold crafting is amazing!

==Completion==
Not bad for a <race>. We make good use of this.

Most of it, anyway. Sometimes, one person's trash is really just trash.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Skitter|Now we deal with bullies so Warrens can be free!}}

Head in and get to killing. [[Waxtail Browbeater]]s and [[Waxtail Tormentor|Tormentors]] count for Ko-boldening, and all the others drop scrap.

*{{text|say|Oppressed Kobold|Free!}}
*{{text|say|Oppressed Kobold|Quick!}}
*{{text|say|Oppressed Kobold|Run!}}
*{{text|say|Oppressed Kobold|Thank you!}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|...and we'd swapped his beard polish for Cinderbrew! Lit up like a magma vent, he did.}}
:{{text|say|Skitter|Ha! Not think stoneheads have humor, but you pretty funny.}}

[[Liberated Kobold]]s are about.

==Progression==
{{By Candlelight}}
