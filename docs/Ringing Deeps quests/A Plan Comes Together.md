==Objectives==
Go over the plan with [[Speaker Brinthe|Brinthe]] and [[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]].
* Point out the Golem Factory
* Point out the Waterworks
* Point out the Shadowvein Extraction Site

==Description==
We have our work cut out for us, <name>. But I think, with Dagran's help, we can break this down and tackle it piece by piece.

Why don't you take us through what we've learned so far.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We're some of the greatest minds in... well Gundargaz, at least. We can figure this out.

==Completion==
We need to secure the Waterworks and get the Shadowvein Excavation site up and running before we head back to the factory.

Let's get to work.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Are you ready for a summary of what we know? Time for a quick sit-rep.}}

Four doodads appear on the table between Brinthe and Dagran. The Deactivated War Golem lights up first:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|So there's a war golem left intact? If it reactivated, it could deal with that goblin in the big mech.}}

Next is the Waterworks waterwheel:
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We'll need to get the Waterworks operational to power the Golemworks. Unfortunately, some isolated kobolds are scavenging there. Keep an eye out.}}

After that is a mechanized Hammer:
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We can't build War Golems without materials from Shadowvein. [[Zee-Zee]]'s arc welder should be able to repair the facility's equipment.}}

==Progression==
{{The Machines March to War}}
