'''The Caretaker of Brunwin's Terrace''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]] started by [[Batzvara]] on the north side of [[Gundargaz]] while players are on the way to [[Speaker Brinthe]] for [[Speaking to the Speakers]].

==Objectives==
Offer cinderbrew to 6 inert earthen and kill 10 Sweetsnufflers.
* [[Inert Earthen|Honor Earthen]] (6)
* [[Sweetsnuffler]] slain (10)

==Description==
Greetings, outlander. You must be the problem solver I've heard about! I'm [[Batzvara|Caretaker Batzvara]]. I tend to [[earthen]] who have gone into stasis, like [[Inert Earthen|our friend here]].

I often patrol [[Brunwin's Terrace]] to honor my fellow earthen with an offering of cinderbrew. Recently, however, I've drawn the attention of a local species of moles. They have a nose for sweets, and greedy claws for all else.

You look like you can defend yourself. Will you accompany me to pay respect to those who have gone into stasis?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Gratitude expressed. Your reputation as a stalwart ally is well-deserved.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Batzvara|Blessings on you, and may the Vault welcome you soon.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Batzvara|Let's head up to the Terrace, but watch out for the sweetsnufflers. The cinderbrew will draw their attention.}}
:''Batzvara joins the party and will follow the player.''

Batzvara also has gossip:
{{dialogue|
As Caretaker, it is my duty and my privilege to attend to my fellow earthen who have entered into stasis. Honoring them keeps their memories active.

{{gossip|Why are the earthen standing still here?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The earthen here were... are a group of friends who made a pact that they would gather here in their twilight moments.

Though the pact was sworn over what was probably too many pints of cinderbrew, they have all honored it, coming here as they felt their power dwindling and striking their favorite pose.

I was there for that swearing, and when my time comes, I will join them here as well. If the Vault is still full, that is.

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
}}

{{gossip|Why did the earthen come here in their final moments?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The answer to that is twofold. Normally, our people would return to the Vault for processing when our time comes. With the Vault out of working order, its halls have become full of waiting earthen. My friends here chose to find a new place for their stasis.

Secondly, for many of us, these green spaces have provided comfort and beauty. There has been a sort of... calling within many earthen to the green and growing spaces of late. We desire to be closer to Azeroth, I believe.

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
}}}}

Don't focus on killing Sweetsnufflers, as interacting with earthen will spawn/aggro them.

Interact with an Inert Earthen:
*{{text|say|Batzvara|May the Vault welcome you.}}
*{{text|say|Batzvara|Rest well, dear friend. May you rejoin us soon.}}
*{{text|say|Batzvara|Blessings of the Machine upon your rest.}}
*{{text|say|Batzvara|May the warmth of this firemead find its way to your core.}}
*{{text|say|Batzvara|You are guarded and revered. Be at peace.}}
*{{Text|say|Batzvara|You are remembered, honored, and missed, friend.}}
*{{text|say|Batzvara|Your name is etched in my memory. You are not forgotten.}}
*{{text|say|Batzvara|You are rememebered{{sic}}, honored, and missed, friend.}}

After completing both objectives:
:{{text|say|Batzvara|Great job! Meet me south of the terraces, by the road.}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Batzvara|Over here, <name>!}}
