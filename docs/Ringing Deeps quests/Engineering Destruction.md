[[File:Engineering Destruction.jpg|thumb|[[Sparklit Buttonmasher]]s and [[Sparklit Scrapper|Scrappers]] working on an [[Abandoned Mining Rig]]]]

==Objectives==
Destroy mining rigs in the [[Lost Mines]].
* Enter the storage depot (Optional)
* [[Abandoned Mining Rig|Mining Rig]] scuttled (8)

==Description==
[[File:Abandoned Mining Rig.jpg|thumb|[[Abandoned Mining Rig]]]]

Some of the [[kobold]]s are retrofitting equipment left behind when the mines fell.

Please, destroy the rigs before they're used against us. I'd rather they be scrap than in the hands of an enemy.

There was a storage depot on the western edge of the lowest level of the mine. Start there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are any still operable, <name>?

==Completion==
Thank you. Our enemy now has one less advantage.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cracking Cogchewer]] before heading out.

Enter the marked cave, then destroy [[Abandoned Mining Rig]]s or kill [[Sparklit Rush Crusher]]s while killing a path to the north end of the mine, where [[Cogchewer]] awaits.

On return:
