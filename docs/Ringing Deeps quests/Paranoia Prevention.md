[[File:Paranoia Prevention.jpg|thumb|[["Conspiracy Theory" Binni]] and [[Monte Gazlowe]]]]

==Objectives==
Investigate [[Gutterville]]'s spy problem.
*Speak with [[Keeble]]
*Speak with [["Conspiracy Theory" Binni]]
*Stop [[Extractor Drill X-71|the Drill]]

==Description==
What information is [[Gallywix]] after here in Gutterville? Let's see if some of these goblins will give us a hint. 

Let's start with any Bilgewater goblins we can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
This seems like it's more about keeping people quiet than actually learning anything.

==Completion==
I hope Renzik catches up with Zirdo before he can blab, but we shouldn't count on it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Yell|Monte Gazlowe|Hold up, I see a goblin I know. Hey there, friend.}}
:''Monte Gazlowe runs over to [[Keeble]], the Blackwater blacksmith.''

{{Dialogue|title=Keeble|Keep your voice down!

Of course I recognize Gazlowe. But we gotta keep this on the down-low.

{{Gossip|quest=|Can you tell us what's going on here in Gutterville?}}}}

:{{Text|Say|Keeble|Can't talk now.}}
:{{Text|Say|Keeble|Try ol' crazy Binni. He'll tell ya some weird stuff, but he gets facts mixed in too.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Sorry to put you on the spot. Thanks.}}
:''Gazlowe runs northeast to the cave.''

Before leaving, Keeble has new gossip:
{{dialogue|The mining situation just gets worse, the further south ya go. I'd say this camp is medium level misery.}}

Catch up with Monte and [["Conspiracy Theory" Binni]]:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|You saw... ghosts?}}
:{{Text|Emote|"Conspiracy Theory" Binni indicates for Monte Gazlowe to speak more quietly.}}

{{Dialogue|title="Conspiracy Theory" Binni|You're looking for the real truth? I've got all the juicy stuff. But we gotta whisper.

{{Gossip|quest=|What are all these spies trying to find?}}
{{Dialogue-child|<Binni looks around nervously, then speaks.>

Gallywix is givin' out big rewards to find the folks workin' against him. It's turning all the goblins against each other.

Pamsy knows the truth, I think.

{{Gossip|quest=|Pamsy?}}}}

{{Gossip|What have you seen lately?}}
{{Dialogue-child|<Binni checks behind him, and on the ceiling, as if expecting ghosts to be up there.>

It isn't just goblins!

There are weird ghosts spying on us too, all wrapped in bandages. My uncle's niece's foreman saw some ghostly shape dematerialize. I saw one skulking around just yesterday, all sneaky-like, with a bandaged face. 

Plus, I think the pinchpinch are in on it. They've been trained by Gallywix.

<Binni makes pinching motions with his hands and points at the exit.>

{{Gossip|Thanks for the info.}}}}}}

Choose the quest options and [[Pamsy]], [[Renzik "The Shiv"]], [[Orweyna]], and [[Zirdo]] walk in:
:{{text|say|Pamsy|Look. This project is slowly killing my crew. Blowing up the wall was my cry for help.}}
:''Zirdo activates a nearby [[Extractor Drill X-71]].''
:{{text|say|Zirdo|That was you?}}
:{{text|yell|Zirdo|I knew you was worth somethin'. I got a reward to collect! See ya, losers.}}
:''Zirdo flees and Renzik takes off after him as the extractor keeps digging, putting up a smoke screen.''
:{{text|say|Pamsy|This smoke--I can't see a thing.}}

{{dialogue|title="Conspiracy Theory" Binni|<Binni coughs, unable to breathe.>}}

Interact with the drill to stop it. Pamsy has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|Everything's become a terrible mess.

{{Gossip|Why did you explode the wall?}}

It was a big risk to do it, but I was out of options. I couldn't get help from Undermine, they got their own problems.

So, I made some noise and hoped that somebody out your way would care about this Black Blood. Looks like I was right.

{{Gossip|Understood.}}}}
