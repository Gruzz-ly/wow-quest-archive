==Objectives==
Look for [[Munderut]] in [[Nibelgaz Mine]].

==Description==
The workers said they saw Munderut near the back of the mining area. Please find him and tell him that I said he needs to report back in.

He might not remember me, or that I am his fused. Tell him to look down at his chest, at the medallion he wears. His memory of our time together fades in and out these days, but the medallion tells of our story and bond forever.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Who are you? What are you doing here? 

Actually, what was I doing here? Gathering spines, I suppose. I got distracted by all the [[elemental]]s. They have made this area quite dangerous for someone who is more of an artist than a fighter.

==Progression==
