==Objectives==
Attend the recitation.
* Attend the Recitation
* Meet [[Brennok]] by the bridge

==Description==
Well, it's time. I'll be holding the recitation at the mine entrance. I'll see you there, though don't feel obligated to stay the whole time.

I'll leave my book for [[Haimaz]] to find. She'll take care of it.

After the ceremony, I would like to say goodbye properly. Meet me by the bridge outside of town. I'll head there after the recitation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*5,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I knew Brennok was acting odd. Then one of the miners mentioned you'd borrowed a spare set of clothes. That and his strange mood, well, it wasn't hard to guess that he planned to leave.

I expected him to come this way, though. Have you seen him?

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|Go on, you two. I have a few things to take care of. I'll catch up.}}
:''Brennok leaves [[Brennok's Chronicle]] on one of the wheels of the cart that Haimaz is leaning on before walking off.''

The chronicle reads:
{{book|Brennok's Chronicle|content=
<Hundreds of pages are filled with Brennok's precise handwriting. Between the cover and first page is a folded note:>

Haimaz,

There has long been a fault in me. A seam of doubt and longing. Every day, it threatens to crack me apart. How long am I to live only for others? What good are stories from one who has lived none? And how long will you be forced to humor me? I'm going. I'm not sure where. I don't think I'll be back. I'm sorry.

Signed,<br>
Brennok}}

Head up to the recitation site and speak with Brennok:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
Well, this is it. The last story I'll tell for some time.

I don't see Haimaz. She doesn't always attend. Titans know she's heard my stories plenty.

Still, I'd hoped... but she wouldn't know this would be my last recitation.

*{{gossip|quest=|<Listen to Brennok's last recitation.>}}
*{{gossip|{{text|red|(Skip recitation)}} I'll meet you by the bridge.}}

Should players choose to listen, they will be provided the option to quietly leave at several points.

:{{Text|say|Brennok|Take your seat. Then I will begin.}}

Sit on the Stool.

:{{text|say|Brennok|I come to you with a story from this very mine. A story of two miners: Durgur and Kharrag.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|Side-by-side, they served their oaths for centuries. But in time, Kharrag felt the call of the [[Unbound]].}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|Her pick grew heavy, and her thoughts grew heavier still. She ceased work, and barely spoke.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|Durgur saw her friend's pain, and was desperate to help. But all she knew was mining.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|So she swore upon her oath. She would not return to the surface until she found something so incredible it would shake off Kharrag's doubts.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|For many years she searched. True to her promise, she never left the mine.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|One day, in the fathomless depths, she found her prize. A peerless gem. So beautiful it could cut through all of Kharrag's doubts.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|Joyful, she ran back to Kharrag. Do you know what Kharrag said when Durgur returned with the gem?}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|Nothing.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|Kharrag had long since passed into stillness.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|They say all the strength went out of Durgur. Her body so worn, it had only been her oath keeping her upright.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|When they tried to comfort her, she shattered. She was a mere shell of stone.}}
:{{text|say|Brennok|Remember, an oath is a heavy thing. If we are not careful, we will buckle under that weight.}}
:{{text|whisper|Brennok|I'll find somewhere quiet to change. Meet me at the bridge outside of town.}}

Outside of town at the marked spot, catch up not with Brennok, but Haimaz:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|There you two are-}}
:{{text|say|Haimaz|<Name>, why are you alone? Where's Brennok?}}

She has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|Of course I know Brennok wants to leave. He's not half as subtle as he thinks.}}

==Progression==
