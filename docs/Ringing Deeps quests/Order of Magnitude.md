==Objectives==
Give the Bounty from [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] to [[Monte Gazlowe|Gazlowe]].
* [[Bounty from Gallywix]] (provided)
* Bring the orders to Gazlowe at the far side of the Darkfuse camp.

==Description==
<This document requires anyone with information about who opened the western wall to bring the information to their supervisor. 

It details the reward: a promotion to working inside Undermine. It also includes a promise of the favor and "appreciation" of Gallywix.

Gazlowe will want to know about this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
What'd you find?

==Completion==
Gallywix is controllin' the Darkfuse directly, and wants to know who worked against him. We could have an ally out here. That's a big clue, <name>.

==Notes==
While in the area for [[Hostile Work Environment]] and [[Miner Investigations]], keep an eye out for the [[Dirty Scroll]], which starts this quest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Jastor Gallywix|I want the head of whoever brought down that wall!}}
:{{text|say|Jastor Gallywix|The goblin who brings me the culprit gets a promotion, and a corner office at the Gallagio.}}

Once done with the other quests, find Monte just south of camp:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Over here!}}

He has some gossip:
{{dialogue|I didn't have trouble snooping in the camp. I guess I just look like any of the Bilgewater workers.

They are really repressed, it's depressing.}}
