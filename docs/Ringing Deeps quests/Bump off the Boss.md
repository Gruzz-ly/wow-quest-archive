==Completion==
You back! Berrund came back alone. Scrit worried.

It done then? Good. Glumtooth Gang no last long without leader.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go!}}
:{{text|say|Scrit|Better follow him. He shiny, not brilliant.}}
:''Berrund runs off.''

Find Boss Whiskerlash in a cave with three large spiders at the northeast end of the [[Chittering Den]]. Berrund runs in headlong:
:{{text|say|Boss Whiskerlash|You no leave this cave. Crawlers, attack!}}
:{{text|yell|Berrund the Gleaming|No spider can stop us!}}
:''Berrund gleams, spooking the spiders. They bail.''
:{{text|say|Boss Whiskerlash|Bah. Where there lash, there way. I deal with you.}}
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|That's the hard part done. I'll leave the cleanup to you.}}
:''Berrund bails too.''

;On complete
Fearbreaker questline completed:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|That's twice now we've saved the day. When they tell stories, what do you think they'll call us? Berrund and the Mountaineers? No, Berrund's Chargers!}}
:{{text|say|Scrit|I think I stick to calling you kobold friend.}}

Fearbreaker questline not completed:
:{{Text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Another adventure to add to my legend. Follow my example. You might learn a thing or two about being a hero.}}
:{{Text|say|Scrit|You better watch him. His body brighter than his head.}}

Scrit has new gossip:

It done then, good. Glumtooth Gang fall apart. Maybe peace for earthen and kobold.
