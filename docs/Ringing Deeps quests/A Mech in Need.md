'''A Mech in Need''' begins the quest chain to acquire the [[Stonevault Mechsuit]] mount. To begin, loot the [[Malfunctioning Mechsuit]] from [[Void Speaker Eirich]] in the [[Stonevault]]. To complete the warband-wide questline, players must loot the [[Overclocked Gear-a-Rang Launcher]] from [[Speaker Dorlita]] in the Stonevault, the [[Synergistic Brewterializer]] from [[Goldie Baronbottom]] in the [[Cinderbrew Meadery]], and [[Burin of the Candle King]] from [[The Candle King]] in [[Darkflame Cleft]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Malfunctioning Mechsuit to [[Speaker Jurlax]] in [[Gundargaz]].

==Description==
This mechsuit has seen better days. Maybe a skilled [[Machine Speakers|Machine Speaker]] could assist you. 

I know Speaker Jurlax has been assigning machinists to mechsuit maintenance lately. He probably has some advice for you.

==Completion==
Time and decay have wrought havoc on this machine.

With a bit of work, we might still be able to recover it.
