==Objectives==
Collect Lashroom Dust from [[Lashroom]]s in the [[Living Grotto]].
* [[Lashroom Dust]] (12)
*Meet Berrund the Gleaming in the Living Grotto.

==Description==
[[Berrund the Gleaming|Berrund]] here says that [[Verdant Hulk|the massive beast]] standing over [[Fearbreaker]] is very particular about what kinds of creatures it allows near it.

If we blend in, he says, we can get close enough tae nab the hammer. But tae blend in, he says we have tae get covered by the dust an' pollen in the grotto. 

Those Lashrooms look like they're a good place to start. 

It all seems suspicious tae me, but fer now, we'll play along until I can recover Fearbreaker and bring it back to my father.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered up that dust? It's the only way you're going to get near that hammer, especially with that creature wandering around.

==Completion==
<Berrund the Gleaming appears not to have a speck of pollen on himself.>

You got yourself good and covered in that lashroom dust, all right.

I'm a bit surprised you're not itching and sneezing, like your friend here.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|If you want to set foot near that crater without the creature attacking, you'll need the perfect mixture of components.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|While I'm... happy... tae help, that will take some work. This sounds dangerous. Are ye sure it's absolutely necessary?}}
:{{Text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Yes! That hammer will be the perfect weapon against the skardyn. Once I... we have retrieved it, think of all the good we can do!}}
:''Moira runs off and Berrund walks down to water level.''
