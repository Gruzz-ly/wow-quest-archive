Bring the glistening clay to [[Orsenth]] near [[Nibelgaz Mine]].

Orsenth may be interested in examining this piece of ore.>

You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A crystal shard? From a glittering cave? Why does that sound familiar to me?

<She takes the crystal in her hands to examines{{sic}} more closely.>

This can't be! It's the healing crystal I mentioned earlier! We thought it was lost. What a wonder to hold it in my hands...

<She sighs deeply, looking at Munderut.>

I wish it could mend our minds as well as it mends our wounds. We need to get the vault back up and running.
