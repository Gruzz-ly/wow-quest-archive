==Objectives==
Rescue Lisky from [[Fetid Grotto|the cave]].
*Find [[Lisky]]
*Bring Lisky to [[Skorthuz]]

==Description==
[[Hrandaz]] is going to have to wait. My beloved Lisky is missing! She went into this cave and hasn't come out. I think whatever's making that terrible stench drew her attention.

Please, go in and find my Lisky? She hasn't drawn the attention of the horrid creatures inside yet, but it's only a matter of time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My sweet precious Lisky! Please get her out of there.

==Completion==
You found her! Thank you!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Skorthuz|Blow on the whistle to call Lisky to you. She always gets distracted.}}

Skorthuz has gossip:
{{dialogue|
I can't believe she ran into that awful cave! The stench alone drove me away, but of course, that's what drew her in.

Slimy cave full of kobold trash! Of course she'd go straight for it.
}}

Pick up [[Oozemodius (quest)]] before heading in. [[Lisky]] is wandering around the bottom bit of the cave. It would help to <code>/target</code> her. Get close and she'll follow the player, but finds herself distracted fairly frequently.
:{{text|bossemote|Lisky is distracted!}}

Use the extra action button that appears:
:{{abilities|Call Lisky|Use the whistle to call Lisky to your side.|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Skorthuz|Lisky! My darling! Get back here you silly thing, you.}}

On completion of both:
:{{text|say|Skorthuz|Come, Lisky. Let's see if Hrandaz saved us any cinderbrew.}}
:''They wander off.''

Back at [[Shadowvein Point]] Skorthuz and Lisky are with Hrandaz and Skorthuz has new gossip:
{{dialogue|
Without your help, I don't know what might have happened to my Lisky. I'm so glad to have her back, even if she does smell like a sewer.

You hear that, girl? You're getting a bath as soon as I'm done here.
