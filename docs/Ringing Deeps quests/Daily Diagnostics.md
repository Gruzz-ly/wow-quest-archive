==Objectives==
Take diagnostic readings of 4 machines within the [[Stonevault]].
*[[Diagnostic Console|Diagnostics Collected]] (4)

==Description==
It is my duty and honor to take diagnostic readings every day. I determine the output and efficiency of the Stonevault's great machines. The burden is mine.

Describing complication: now that [[skardyn]] have overrun the Stonevault, I cannot reach my machines!

Solution proposed: I have heard that you are a hero of great renown. Please go in and gather today's readings for me. Timing will be critical in the event anything goes wrong. Awaiting confirmation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60}}
* 21,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There are numerous consoles that assist with the running of the great machines within the Stonevault. Work does not cease, even in the face of this madness.

Please, get me those readings as soon as you can!

==Completion==
Thank you for getting me those readings. Hopefully the analysis will show that everything is in order with the great machines. 

Until it has been deemed safe for us to return to the Stonevault I'm stuck here cooling my gears. But at least I know what today's readings are like.
