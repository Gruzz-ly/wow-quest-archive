==Objectives==
Employ ZZ-01-47 to scout the [[Deepforge Golemworks|Golem Factory]].
* Command [[ZZ-01-47]] to Scout the Facility
* Pipe Grate Entered {{co|58.0|75.9|Ringing Deeps}}
* Scout the Darkfuse leader {{co|58.0|77.0|Ringing Deeps}}
* Scout the Manufacturing Bay {{co|56.4|77.6|Ringing Deeps}}
* Sneak through the pipes {{co|57.2|78.3|Ringing Deeps}}
* Scout the Cargo Bay {{co|58.1|79.9|Ringing Deeps}}
* Exit back through the Pipe {{co|58.4|76.6|Ringing Deeps}}
* Return to Brinthe

==Description==
ZZ-01-47 should be able to make its way in there without drawing too much attention.

But be careful! These goblins are hungry for raw materials. If they spot our bot, they won't show it mercy.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Light Boots of the Ringing Deeps]]
* [[Epaulets of the Ringing Deeps]]
* [[Grips of the Ringing Deeps]]
* [[Sabatons of the Ringing Deeps]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Zee-Zee shouldn't be in much danger, as long as she stays away from the big mechs.

==Completion==
So we're contending with a lack of power, materials, and a dangerous amount of goblins.

If I had pores like an outlander, they'd be excreting moisture right about now. Is that proper terminology? I've seen your skin weep moisture before. Remarkable.

==Notes==
Speak with Zee-Zee:
{{dialogue|<ZZ-01-47 blurts a series of bleeps in ascending pitch and tips their form slightly, as if in greeting.>

{{gossip|quest=|We'll need you to go in to the Golemworks and take a look for us.}}}}

Players take control of ZZ and "You" walk over to the stool next to Brinthe and take a seat. ZZ's vehicle interface provides two abilities:
#{{abilities|Turbo Boost|Activate to boost your speed for a short time.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.}}
#{{abilities|Decoy|Deploy a hologram decoy to fool perceptive goblins in the Deepforge Golemworks.|range=20|cd=20 sec|notes=Instant. Spawns a Lazy Salvager that distracts the truesight-capable units.}}

Head southeast around the corner and aim for the Pipe Grate to the left of the Perceptive Salvagers and Mechanized Enforcers that are blocking the path. On the other side of the pipe, in the building immediately to the west, is [[Supervisor Radlock]]:
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|That thing is huge! Our work's cut out for us.}}

Using the [[Decoy]] ability:
:{{text|say|Perceptive Salvager/Mechanized Enforcer|Hey, get back to work!}}
*{{text|say|Lazy Salvager|Time for work? More like time for a nap!}}
*{{text|say|Lazy Salvager|There's nuthin' good here anyway.}}
*{{text|say|Lazy Salvager|Must be nice, sittin' up there on your cushy mechs.}}
*{{text|say|Lazy Salvager|Time for a break!}}
*{{text|say|Lazy Salvager|What're you gonna do, step on me? I'd like to see you try, bub!}}
:{{text|say|Perceptive Salvager/Mechanized Enforcer|An illusion!?}}

Head west into the marked building:
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|The facility is unpowered, but that war golem in the corner looks intact.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We might be able to reactivate it, if we can get some time in there uninterrupted.}}

Back outside and to the south for another pipe shortcut, then enter the next entrance to the right:
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|We can't build golems without resources from Shadowvein. The site's mostly automated. It was abandoned centuries ago.}}

Return to the initial pipe near Supervisor Radlock to exit the area.
