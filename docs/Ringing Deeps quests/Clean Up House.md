==Objectives==
Slay agitated creatures in the [[Rumbling Wastes]].
* Agitated creatures slain (10)

==Description==
It looks like the destruction around the [[Coreway]] rattled loose more than just a few stones down here. It's stirred up all sorts o' dark things.

If this was a thriving mining operation, it ain't anymore.

We need to help the earthen get it under control again, and that means thinning out these beasts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I want to get Fearbreaker back, but we need to clear out some of these agitated beasts first.

==Completion==
That's a mite better. At least there won't be so many of those creatures running amok around this area.

Now we've got other problems.

We've got [[skardyn]].

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|What's happened tae this place?}}
:{{text|say|[[Injured Earthen (Ringing Deeps)|Injured Earthen]]|This place was hit hard when the Coreway collapsed. Now skardyn and other horrors run amok. We weren't able to get everyone out in time.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|And Berrund thinks he can make things right with one magic hammer. All right. I'll do me best tae help.}}
:''Moira runs off.''

After killing the quota, head to the marked cave entrance to find Moira, Berrund, and some slain [[Slain Reaver|skardyn]] and [[Expired Earthen|earthen]]:
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|You're here! Thank goodness. The hammer just... it just...}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Ye bloody thief! Yer lucky we weren't far behind.}}

Moira has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Moira stands straight and tall as she can, her chin high and proud. But she still appears conflicted.>}}

Fearbreaker has gossip too:
{{Dialogue|<Fearbreaker sits solid and heavy on the ground.>

{{gossip|<Try to lift Fearbreaker.>}}

*<Fearbreaker slips politely out of your grasp, dropping back to the ground. It is waiting for someone else.>
*({{Race|Dwarf}}) Fearbreaker respectfully recognizes that you are near to kin. However, it still slips politely out of your grasp, as if it is waiting for someone else.
