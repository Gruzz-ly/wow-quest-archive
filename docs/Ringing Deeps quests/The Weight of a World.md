==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Oath-Eater.jpg|Oath-Eater|Devourer of anything that falls into the water.}}
Collect [[Machinist Kittrin]]'s Calibrated Weight.
* [[Machinist's Calibrated Weight]]

==Description==
My tools didn't randomly end up where you found them. They were placed there. By me.

I had reached a point so low that I saw no alternative. The machines, the great work of my people, were never going to sing again. So why should I bother to keep them repaired?

But now I see, and now, I understand!

The last tool I need, I dropped it into the water, and it was eaten by a giant creature. I think that one might need a bit more force to return it to me.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
*Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Once I have all my tools back, I know that things will be right again.

==Completion==
<Kittrin doesn't seem bothered at all by the intestinal goo that coats the calibrated weight.>

You found it! Now let me get this cleaned up, and the rest of the tools repaired. Then, I will be ready to serve once again.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Machinist Kittrin|It's true, I buried those tools myself at a moment of great crisis. I regret that decision, and now, I am ready. I just need that last tool and then I can move forward again.}}

Northwest out of [[Gundargaz]], just south of the [[Ironhaul Station]] is a small ravine, where [[Oath-Eater]] awaits. Defeat it and loot the [[Machinist's Calibrated Weight]] from its corpse.
