Return to [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] in [[Dornogal]]{{sic|no period}}

==Description==
Please take word of our victory to Alleria in Dornogal. I'm sure our allies will be pleased to hear what we can provide for the war effort.

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}

What amazing news, <name>!

The War Golems awaken, and march against our enemies once again, just like in times past.

Your contribution to the cause of the Machine Speakers, and to all of the Earthen, will not be forgotten.

==Notes==
Before leaving, Brinthe has gossip:
{{dialogue|Incredible, <name>. With the facility under our control, you can expect us to punch above our weight in the coming battles.}}

No shortcut back to Dornogal, alas.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We need to match the raw strength of Ansurek's Ascended monstrosities. War Golems give us a way to do that. Well done.}}
