==Objectives==
Use the Investigate ability to find clues about what happened in [[Taelloch]].
* Tell Magni you are ready to go
* Enter the town
* Investigate and inspect clues (6)
* Investigate the call for help

==Description==
[[Kol Bruncrag|The foreman]] isn't here. Obviously. But the evidence points to her being here recently. So perhaps she's still nearby!

We should go further into town and see if anyone has any idea where she might be.

Or maybe someone else can give us the answers we need. Maybe we'll find out on our own! Maybe it was some sort of attack or some kind of... sorry. I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's go investigate!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well... there's one question answered perhaps. Only to unearth a dozen more.

==Notes==
Before heading out, Magni has dialogue:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|We must always remember our duty to Azeroth.

{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
*{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Dagran... lad... I'm concerned about you.}}
*{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|What's wrong, Gran'da?}}
*{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|It does my heart good to see you so excited about this... but I'm concerned about your safety.}}
*{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|You've got a good eye for solving problems, lad, but not for danger. You've got a brave heart, but you're reckless.}}
*{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Sometimes I think you're so distracted figuring things out that you leap before you look.}}
*{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I'll be careful. And Gran'da... I'm also worried... about... you.}}
*{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Me? What do you mean?}}
*{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|You also seem... distracted. Sometimes you're angry. Like it hurts. Like it's all too much.}}
*{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Aye. I've had a burden to bear for too long. I just don't want you to get hurt, lad.}}
*{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|That's how adventures work sometimes, Gran'da. And not just in books.}}
*{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Tell ya what: I'll learn to be more cautious. And you'll try to enjoy an adventure now and then.}}
*{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Aye, lad. I'll enjoy them even more when I'm with you. It's a deal.}}}}
{{Gossip|quest=|I am ready to go.}}

:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|If we want answers, we'll just have to look for them.}}
:''Dagran and Magni join the party, following the player around.''

Head northeast up the stairs into town:
:{{text|bossemote|Use the "Investigate" ability to find clues.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Where are all the people? What happened to everybody?}}

An extra action button appears:
:{{abilities|Investigate|Search for clues within 80 yards.|cd=8 sec|notes=2.5 sec cast|id=440479|icon=inv_professions_inscription_scribesmagnifyingglass_gold}}

[[File:Ghost of a Company Town.jpg|thumb|A Hastily Constructed Barricade blocking off the entrance]]
Use it, then follow the glowing orbs to find a [[Hastily Constructed Blockade]] barring the entrance to a building:
:{{text|bossemote|You found something! Take a closer look.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|We should see if any one is in there.}}

Interact with the barricade to knock on it:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Hello? Someone there?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I doubt it. The entrance is boarded up.}}

Other barricades can be interacted with, for similar dialogue:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Is anyone home?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I know you want to help, lad. But this is a ghost town.}}

For the third set of barricades, it seems that someone ''or something'' is home.
:{{Text|Yell|Unknown Voice|<muffled growling>}}
:{{Text|Say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Did you hear something, Gran'da?}}
:{{Text|Say|Magni Bronzebeard|Sounded like another deepflayer. Let's move on.}}

For the set of barricades on the lower level, outside of the town:
:{{Text|Say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Anyone down here?}}
:{{Text|Yell|Unknown Voice|You... are not wanted here! Away! Away!}}
:{{Text|Say|Magni Bronzebeard|Don't think we'll be getting anything out of these folk.}}
:{{Text|Say|Dagran Thaurissan II|What could they be so afraid of?}}

Use the extra action button again to find the next object, an [[Earthen Slate]] in the middle of the plaza:
{{book|content=<This slate appears to be a solicitation for workers:

"Strong hands needed for additional shifts!

Overtime approved to make up for recent losses of labor.

Please inquire with Foreman if interested.">}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Fewer workers, it would seem. Is it because the earthen are shutting down?}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Shutting down... or disappearing or... changing? The answer lies in the clues.}}

To the south are two [[Full Mug]]s:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|These mugs are still full, and the drinks look fresh, but there's no one around. I think people were here recently.}}

Up the stairs to the southeast to find an [[Earthen Hammer]] on a table full of other tools:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|A lot of tools are still here. So the workers can't all be out in the mines...}}

Head north to find another Earthen Slate:
{{book|content=<This earthen slate reads:

"MISSING: Kor Nartklec

LAST SEEN: Night Shift, Mine Site 4"

Underneath this original message are more names written in varying handwriting. The names get smaller as writers try to squeeze more names in at the bottom of the slate.>}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|That's... a lot of names. Everywhere we go, we find the names of people lost.}}

Another slate:
{{book|content=
<This earthen slate reads:

"NOTICE: While Foreman Kol Brunkrag is away,

Tolknat is acting Foreman. Please submit ONLY URGENT inquiries to Tolknat.">
}}

:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan|Acting foreman... that must mean that the foreman was gone for a while, right?}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Good eye.}}

When all clues have been investigated:
:{{text|yell|Unknown Voice|It's changing! It's changing!}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|What was that?}}
:{{text|yell|Magni Bronzebeard|It came from that building!}}

Head just southeast to find a larger Barricade. Interact with it and Magni and the player attempt to destroy the barricade:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Enough knocking, <name>. We're breaking this thing down!}}
:{{text|yell|Unknown Voice|It's changing... it's changing... Whoever you are, get in here!}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|We have to help them, Gran'da!}}

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] follows, Magni Defends Dagran:
{{#ev:youtube|HShZaYCXUig|Magni Defends Dagran}}

''From the inside of the barricade, it takes a few heavy blows before Magni smashes through it with a grunt. He, the adventurer, and Dagran run in.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|<grunt>}}

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|We heard ya!}}

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|We're here to help!}}

{{text|bossemote|Skardyn|<painful groaning>}}

''In the back of the room, an earthen is clearly not in a good way, groaning painfully. Large crystalline spikes grow out of their left shoulder and back.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|What's happening to them?}}

{{text|bossemote|Dagran Thaurissan II|A skardyn transformation in progress!}}

''Heedless of the danger, Dagran walks closer to the transforming earthen.''

{{text|bossemote|Dagran Thaurissan II|Fascinating...}}

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|Stay back, lad!}}

{{text|bossemote|Skardyn|<unintelligible shouting>}}

''The skardyn transformation continues, and the skardyn turns to Dagran and shouts at him unintelligibly. Dagran steps back, but the skardyn closes the distance with a leap over the table between them, and the force of the impact knocks Dagran to the ground on his back.''

{{text|bossemote|Dagran Thaurissan II|<shocked gasp>}}

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|Get away from him!}}

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|<angry yell>}}

{{text|bossemote|Skardyn|<painful groan>}}

''Magni charges forward and a surge of power wells up in him. Stopping between the skardyn and Dagran, Magni pops open a spherical shield around the two of them, noticeably Azerite-colored. This stops the skardyn, who runs out of the room past the adventurer, and Magni drops to one knee as the shield fades. Dagran gets to his feet, shocked, and walks up to Magni.''

{{text|bossemote|Dagran Thaurissan II|Gran'da! That surge of energy-- the skardyn's reaction-- how did you do that?}}

''The adventurer walks up as well. Magni looks incredulously at his left hand.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|I don't... know...}}

''They hear something outside and turn to look.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|We'll figure it out later! I can hear more coming...}}

Outside, the phase changes, and Taelloch is now full of [[Unstable Skardyn]], [[Fog Wither]]s, [[Cursed Miner]]s, and [[Skardyn Husk]]s.
