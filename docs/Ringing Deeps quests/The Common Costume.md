==Objectives==
Find a spare set of Miner's Clothes.
* Speak to [[Resting Miner]]s
* [[Miner's Clothes]]

==Description==
I'll slip away after the recitation. It's easy to vanish in a crowd of earthen enjoying a keg of cinderbrew.

However, I can't be recognized when I leave town. I don't want anyone to stop me. Or worse, to think I'm abandoning my oath. Better to just disappear.

If you find me a spare set of Miner's Clothes, I'll be able to get away without being noticed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find them yet?

==Completion==
Thank you. No one should recognize me in these.

==Notes==
[[Resting Miner]]s are upstairs in the inn that Brennok is behind. Speak with one:

{{Dialogue|Can I help you?

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask if the miner knows where a spare set of clothes is.>

I do, but why do you need them?

*{{gossip|quest=|It's part of the recitation ceremony.}}
Oh, in that case, you can find plenty of spares on the top floor of the inn.
*{{gossip|quest=|I like to collect souvenirs.}}
Well... I suppose it's alright as long as you only take one set. You can find plenty of spares on the top floor of the inn.
*{{gossip|quest=|No time to explain! It's a very urgent, very embarrassing situation.}}
Oh! Say no more. You can find plenty of spares on the top floor of the inn.
}}

}}

On the way up to the top floor:
:{{text|say|Resting Miner|Have you been to the Compiler? I told him about the flayer that chipped its teeth on me.}}
:{{text|say|Resting Miner|I hope the Compiler has tales from the surface.}}
:{{text|say|Resting Miner|Are you going to the recitation?}}
:{{text|say|Resting Miner|Who knows, maybe he'll tell one of my stories.}}

Pick up a crate of [[Spare Miner's Clothes]] for some [[Miner's Clothes]].

On complete of both:
:{{text|say|Haimaz|<Name>, do you have a moment?}}

==Progression==
{{Haimaz}}
