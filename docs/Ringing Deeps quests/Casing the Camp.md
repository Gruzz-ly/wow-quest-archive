==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Glumtooth Gang]] camp.
* Put on the [[Flawless Bug Disguise]]
* Impress the guards
* Investigate the camp
* Investigate the fighting ring

==Description==
Now we take you to camp. You see what [[Boss Whiskerlash]] do. Put on bug disguise when we close to camp. Let me do talking.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Can no let this camp stand. Too much to lose for kobold and earthen.

==Completion==
You see what Glumtooth Gang do? Even have earthen prisoner!

==Notes==
On accept, Scrit joins the party and will follow the player around.

Use the extra action button:
:{{abilities|Flawless Bug Disguise|Don your bug disguise.|notes=1.5 sec cast|id=444933|icon=inv_inscription_pigment_bug04}}

Then head uphill to the northwest. The disguise makes the kobolds in town friendly.
:{{text|say|[[Glumtooth Bruiser]]|Eugh! Where you find that bug?}}
:{{text|say|Glumtooth Bruiser|It even trained?}}
:{{text|say|Scrit|Of course. Bug, uh, do trick!}}

Use the new extra action button:
:{{abilities|Show Off|Impress the guards with a fancy move.|notes=1.5 sec cast|id=449231|icon=ability_kick}}
:{{text|say|Glumtooth Bruiser|Ok, you come in.}}

Head in, but steer clear of the [[Glumtooth Sneak-spotter]]s, who have truesight with the buff {{Abilities|Wait a Minute|id=448350|icon=ability_rogue_bloodyeye}}. Stop at the Glumtooth Trapper:
:{{text|yell|Glumtooth Trapper|Boss want bugs tough. No go easy!}}
:{{text|yell|Glumtooth Trapper|Get bugs fight ready!}}
:{{text|say|Scrit|Boss Whiskerlash send captured bugs here. Training army for war with earthen.}}

Check in at the fighting ring:
:{{text|say|Scrit|Use captured earthen for training. Must put stop to this.}}
:{{text|say|Berrund the Gleaming|Come on, beasties! I'll take all of you.}}

Scrit has new gossip on complete:
{{Dialogue|
This camp a disgrace. Glumtooth Gang use kobolds and bugs as tools. Force them into war for Whiskerlash and Candle King. Must put stop to it.
}}

If you try to enter the area where [[Berrund the Gleaming]] is, you will be knocked back with a [[Glumtooth Bruiser]] saying one of the following lines:
*{{text|say|Glumtooth Bruiser|Prove bug strong first!}}
*{{text|say|Glumtooth Bruiser|Weak bugs no allowed!}}
*{{text|say|Glumtooth Bruiser|Control your bug!}}
*{{text|say|Glumtooth Bruiser|Come back when bug stronger!}}
