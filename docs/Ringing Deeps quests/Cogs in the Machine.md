==Objectives==
Accompany [[Speaker Brinthe|Brinthe]] as they talk to [[earthen]] in [[Gundargaz]].
*Meet [[Igram Underwing]]
*Meet [[Speaker Jurlax]]
*Meet [[Watcher Toki]]
*Return to Brinthe's house

==Description==
Gundargaz is my home. Or at least, it was before the High Speaker saw fit to reassign me above ground. I've missed my home, but it's... changed.

As the number of [[Machine Speakers]] decreases, we're in a race against time.

Lately, we've been especially weary of our assigned tasks, but as always, we must bear our burdens.

Let me show you around the area. There are some earthen I would like you to meet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Problems are increasing, and our numbers are dwindling.

The High Speaker is distracted, [[kobold]]s are attacking, shipments are missing from Taelloch, and earthen aren't returning from their shifts.

Where to begin? Looks like our work is cut out for us.

==Notes==
On accept, Brinthe joins the party and will follow the player around.

Just outside is the flight master, [[Igram Underwing]]:
{{dialogue|The sounds of industry ring through the Deeps! Fly to the far-flung reaches of the realm, and you'll hear even greater wonders.

{{gossip|quest=|Are you Underwing?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Igram Underwing|Is that... Brinthe? Speaker acknowledged! Thank the titans you're here. We lose more of our kin with each passing shift.}}

Just north is [[Speaker Jurlax]]:
{{dialogue|In better days, the Awakening Machine bestowed us with the life force to work for thousands of years. We reaffirmed our loyalty each time we returned to it.

Now we have been slipping into stasis one by one, and discontent is growing. For every plaque on this plinth, another earthen has shut down.

Until the Machine is restored, our earthen in stasis cannot Awaken.

I see earthen working hard. I also see you... walking around. I hope your time here is... productive.

}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Jurlax|Speaker Brinthe, you've returned! Unlike the missing shipments from Taelloch. And its foreman.}}

Don't forget about [[Brax's Brass Knuckles]] from [[Innkeeper Brax]]! To the southeast, find [[Watcher Toki]] past the steam pool:

{{dialogue|Careful, friend. It's not all cheerful tunes and happy miners down here.

Danger lurks in these caves.

{{gossip|quest=|Watcher Toki, I presume?}}
}}

:{{text|say|Watcher Toki|Praise the Machine, it's Brinthe! Are you here to deal with the kobold raids? The High Speaker won't lift a finger to help!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|So this "Awakening Machine" is what recharges the earthen?}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Yes. But it has been broken for millennia. That is why our numbers are dwindling.}}
