==Objectives==
Collect 20 Pristine Ice Chunks from [[ice elemental]]s.
* [[Pristine Ice Chunks]] (20)

==Description==
The cliffs here are well known for the crystal clear ice which forms at their base, and even more so for the [[elemental]]s that are responsible for such. The hunters in my lodge use shards from the primal bodies to keep their stock frozen for transport. 

More importantly, think of how useful it could be for making and serving drinks!

Let's see if we can't find some elementals and gather shards from them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I've heard that destroying some of the larger ice structures in the area angers them, so do what you do best and destroy any that you come across!

==Completion==
Perfectly chilled drinks, here I come! And there is enough for the hunters here too.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Noble Responsibilities]] before heading out. For the duration of the quests, you have the buff Kennings is Near.

Break [[Humming Ice]] objects in the area to spawn a handful of [[Agitated Ice Shardling]]s. They have a good chance of dropping [[Pristine Ice Chunks]].
