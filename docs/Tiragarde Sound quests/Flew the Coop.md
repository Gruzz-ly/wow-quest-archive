==Description==
Yes, yes, you can ride the pretties. They like it! They're good pretties. They like helping!

Do you like helping, too? Maybe you can help me!

Some of the loud men came here and threatened me. They don't scare me! But they made the pretties fly away.

If you see any of my pretties out there, please feed this to them!

It's my special treat. I know it will make them come home.

==Progress==
Did you find any pretties? Oh, they must be so hungry out there.

==Completion==
You did it! So many pretties came back!
