==Objectives==
Find Chelsea Wright at the [[Bleak Hills Mine]] in [[Drustvar]].
* Find [[Chelsea Wright]]

==Description==
While you are visiting Drustvar, I need you to run another errand for me.

The Wright family owned a mine up near [[Corlain]]. Years past, they supplied all the [[metal]] [[ore]] I used to build my [[Boat|ships]].

I can't imagine they're faring too well, based on what we've seen [[Algerson Lumber Yard|here]].

Find Chelsea Wright, the foreman's daughter, and see what they need to get another ore shipment together.

Just tell her [[Dorian Atwater|Dorian]] sent you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Boy, am I glad to see you. I thought that beast was going to eat me alive!

==Notes==
At [[Watchman's Rise]]:
:''[[Chelsea Wright]] stands cowering from a [[Wicker Beast]]. As the [[adventurer]] approaches, the beast runs up to her.''
