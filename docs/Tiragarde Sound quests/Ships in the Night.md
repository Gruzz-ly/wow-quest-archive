==Objectives==
Take the boat to the Swift Vengeance and find Derek Proudmoore.
* Take [[Thomas Zelling|Zelling]]'s [[Zelling's Boat|Boat]] to [[the Swift Vengeance]]
* Grappling Hook used
* [[Aft Door]] breached
* [[Derek Proudmoore]] found

==Description==
[[Sylvanas]] has gone too far this time. We may be at [[Fourth War|war]] with the [[Alliance]], but there are certain lines we cannot cross.

I must right this situation, but I need your assistance. Derek Proudmoore is being held on the Swift Vengeance, which is moored in the harbor here for supplies.

We must take him and bring him back to [[Proudmoore|his family]]. Are you with me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There's no time to waste.

==Completion==
Proudmoore is here, but this cage may prove problematic.

I don't think we're going to be able to brute force this lock.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Baine runs towards [[Zelling's Boat]] and boards it. [[Thomas Zelling]] is there, channeling his magic.''
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|The Swift Vengeance is anchored just outside the harbor. Zelling will take us there.}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|You'll have to pardon the tight quarters. These boats weren't made with tauren in mind.}}

;Boarding the boat
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|Revered tides, carry us swiftly and silently to our quarry.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|The ship's crew is fanatically loyal to Sylvanas. They will not take our trespass lightly.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Though it pains me, we may need to shed blood this day.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|This is it. Zelling, wait here while we clear the deck.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|<Name>, use the grappling hook to board the ship. I will follow behind you.}}

The Grappling Hook Extra Button is available.

;Boarding the Swift Vengeance
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Give the word, and I will break down the door. Prepare to meet heavy resistance.}}

;Interacting with Aft Door
:''Baine smashes the door, [[Swift Vengeance Crewman|Swift Vengeance Crewmen]] attack.''
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Be on your guard. This is sure to alert everyone inside.}}
:{{Text|say|Swift Vengeance Crewman|Trespassers! The Banshee will have your head!}}
:{{Text|say|Swift Vengeance Crewman|We've been boarded!}}
:{{Text|say|Swift Vengeance Crewman|Please, no more!}}
:{{Text|say|Swift Vengeance Crewman|Spare me! I was just following orders!}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Proudmoore is likely being held belowdecks. Be swift.}}

Continue and find [[Jailer Hatewell]].

:{{Text|say|Jailer Hatewell|Intruders! You wont leave here alive!}}
:{{Text|say|Swift Vengeance Crewman|Spare me! I was just following orders!}}
:{{Text|say|Swift Vengeance Crewman|No prisoner is worth this! Take him!}}
:{{Text|say|Jailer Hatewell|Proudmoore belongs... to the Dark Lady...}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Over here! He is unconscious, but still alive...}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|At least... as close to it as undeath can be.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Hmm. This is quite an intricate lock. We may have a problem.}}
