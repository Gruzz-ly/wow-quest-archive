==Objectives==
Kill The Hornet.
* [[The Hornet]] slain
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
That's it, I'm putting a bounty on that blasted hornet.

Every time I try to do some good old fashioned bare-handed fishing, that son of a bear comes after me.

Somebody take that bug down!

("The Hornet: "I'd do it myself, but I'm allergic." - Tagart")

You will receive:
* {{cost|58|20|}}

==Progress==
What do you want, <name>?

==Completion==
The hornet's dead! Good on ya, house cat.

I'd like to not die to a bug.

==Notes==
While searching for [[The Hornet]] over on the east end of the weald, look for [["Helpless" Henry]], hiding behind a rock near [[Brawr]]. He offers [[Helping Henry]].
