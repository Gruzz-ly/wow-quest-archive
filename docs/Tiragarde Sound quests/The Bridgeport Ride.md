==Objectives==
Mount the [[Stolen Horse]], then use it to round up 10 Bridgeport Guards and Captain Stone. Then escort them to the southwest corner of town.

Getting knocked off of your horse could prove fatal, and will fail the mission.
* Ride past [[Bridgeport Guard]]s (10)
* Ride past [[Captain Amalia Stone]]
* Complete the Bridgeport Ride

==Description==
Pay attention, <name>, because this isn't going to be our standard assassination mission.

You and I are going to take this [[horse]] through [[Bridgeport]] and... cause a scene. I want every single guard on our tail, along with that Captain Stone character. Once we've rounded them up, it's over to those [[explosive]]s, and...

<Lilian's eyes grow wide with delight.>

Boom.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (800x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
I trust you and Lilian are being productive.

==Completion==
I heard the blast from up here. I think I may have even gotten a piece of guard on my cloak.

==Notes==
;On the horse

:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Head into town and round up as many guards as you can!}}
:''Lilian hops on the horse and stars throwing torches.''
:{{Text|yell|Lilian Voss|Kul Tirans! Your deal with the Alliance will be your death sentence!}}
:{{Text|yell|Lilian Voss|The Horde will tear you apart!}}
:{{Text|yell|Lilian Voss|Come and get us, cowards!}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Keep moving! Gather up all the town's guards... and their leader!}}

Ride past the enemies to make them follow you. Once you have 10 guards and Captain Stone following you, ride towards the explosives.

;Upon reaching the explosives
:A cut-scene plays
:Past the explosives, Lilian throws her torch at the explosives, blowing up the riders and their horses into the air.
:{{Text|yell|Lilian Voss|For the Horde!}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Good work, <name>. Now, where is Lilian?}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Right here, Blightcaller. I have retrieved the body.}}
:''Lilian is dragging a [[Forsaken Coffin]].''
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Mostly intact?}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Intact enough.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Load it into the wagon, then. You are proving more useful than I had anticipated, Miss Voss.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Hello, Captain Stone. I so look forward to meeting you.}}
:''Lilian throws the coffin on a wagon and joins Nathanos.''

Completing this quest completes the "The First Assault" criterion of [[Ready for War]].
