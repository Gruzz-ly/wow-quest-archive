==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Overseer Bates.jpg|Overseer Bates|The leader of the guard, he surrendered his underlings to the dark forces that have overtaken the wharf.}}
Kill Overseer Bates.
* [[Overseer Bates]] slain

==Description==
I won't sugarcoat it, kid. It's a madhouse here.

The leadership has fallen, selling their own [[soul]]s as well as the souls of the workers to some darker forces.

I will not give in.

Overseer Bates surrendered the guard in his hunger for power. Show him that he is a fool.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Navigator's Footwraps
|Freebooter Shoes
|Outrigger Waders
|Sea Raider's Boots
|Navigator's Waistwrap
|Freebooter Cord

|Sea Raider's Cinch
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
After the guard fell, it was easy to get to everybody else.

==Completion==
Bates gave everything he had for greater power. Shame it had to go that way.

==Notes==
While in the [[Anglepoint Packing District]] for [[Possessive Headgear]], [[The Young Lord Stormsong]], [[Betrayal of the Guard]], [[Manager Yerold]] offers this quest and [[Dangerous Cargo]].

Bates' main ability is a 3-yard wide by ~20-yard-long area of effect swipe that will stun for 3 seconds if players are hit by it.
