==Objectives==
Take out Fernn's three lieutenants.
* [[Overseer Howling]] slain {{co|78.7|38.8|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Stablemaster Diana]] slain {{co|80.2|37.0|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Hayden the Madshot]] slain {{co|78.2|36.7|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
If [[Tallis Skyheart|Tallis]] honestly thinks that offing a few random soldiers is going to force us to give up Southwatch, he's in for a surprise. The reason why we haven't chased out the sorry troops in this camp is simply because we have more pressing plans.

[[Fernn the Turncoat|Fernn]] has his lieutenants facing the Watch's cannons straight at [[Boralus]] as we speak. Those three are the real driving force of the attack.

<The marine gives you a concerned look as he realizes what he said.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
What is it?

==Completion==
We finally got some useful information from him?

==Notes and trivia==
Pick up [[Targeting a Turncoat]], [[A Lesson on Trust]], [[A Boralus Triple Threat]] and [[Free Bird]] before heading out.
