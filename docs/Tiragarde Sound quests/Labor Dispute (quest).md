==Objectives==
Slay 10 [[Company Watchman|Company Watchmen]], [[Company Enforcer]]s, or [[Company Fusilier]]s.
* Ashvane Company guards slain (10)

==Description==
The [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane Company]] has been workin' their people so hard they even tried to strike! 

The company brought in a bunch of goons to break it up and get everyone back to work. 

Heard they even shot a couple guys who tried to walk off the job.

What say you give 'em a taste of their own brutality while you're in there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
One of them even got the gall to come out here askin' about MY whiskey. Told him to suck bilge-water.

<Cagney spits.>

Yeah he roughed me up pretty good after that.

==Completion==
Nobody likes livin' under the thumb of company men like that - they ain't gonna be missed.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Suspicious Shipments]] and [[Small Haulers]] before heading out.

On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Send those kids to the western edge of the foundry. I'll wait there and make sure nobody tries to snatch 'em.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Meet me there when you've got some information on those shipments.}}

After crossing the bridge to enter the [[Ashvane Foundry]], look out for a [[Posted Notice]] tacked to a wall that starts [[Message from the Management]].

Plenty of guards to kill while on other tasks. Don't focus on them for this quest.

Additionally, there are other suspicious objects like [[Azerite-Dusted Blade]]s all over the foundry that can be used (via the extra action button) to do some extra damage to enemies.

Finally, there's a Small Treasure Chest near [[Forgemaster Farthing]]. It contains a poor-quality item and some [[War Resources]].
