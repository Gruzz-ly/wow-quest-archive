==Objectives==
Catch 5 Unassuming Chickens.
* [[Unassuming Chicken]]s caught (5)

==Description==
Do you know what people love? The unexplained! Problem is, everything here is explainable. 

So I have a plan to create our own phe-gnome-enon. There are stories that talk about some weird chicken-snake hybrids that can turn you to stone. I've already released the chickens, now we just need the snakes.

The first problem can be solved easily. Just chase down the chickens, and stick one of these robotic tails on them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
How do my petrifyingly scary chickens look?

==Completion==
Stupendous! Now we can start calling our resort tour a "mystery safari"!

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Beauty of Marketing]] before heading out.

While in the area, there's also the bonus objective [[Spring Cleaning]].

[[Unassuming Chicken]]s are all over the resort. Interact with them to give them a metal tail.

Out and about, keep an eye out for the rare [[Raging Swell]] southwest of the main camp, and rare turtle [[Tort Jaw]] over by the waterfall.

Near the Ruined Robot, find [[Parin Tinklocket]], who offers [[Inspection Gadget]] and [[Reverse Tinkering]].
