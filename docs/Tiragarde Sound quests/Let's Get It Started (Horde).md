==Objectives==
Repair the vault's machinery.
* [[Gear Controls|Gears repaired]]
* Activate [[Electrode]]
* Attach [[Alpha Wire]] to [[Alpha Pylon]]
* Attach [[Beta Wire]] to [[Beta Pylon]]

==Description==
Those [[gnome]]s think busting up machinery is gonna stop a [[goblin]] like me from figuring out what all the [[Technology|tech]] in this place does?

I ain't never seen a hunk of junk so busted up that ol' [[Skaggit]] and I can't get running smoother than the day it was made.

Tell ya what. You head around with Skaggit and see what you can piece back together.

Meanwhile, I'll have a chat with our gnome friend here and see what she knows about all this tech.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We'll have this place up running in no time.

==Completion==
<Gazlowe's ears perk up and he listens intently for a few moments.>

Machine sounds good. Few loose bolts and missing wires, but nothin' we'd really miss.

Nice work.
