==Objectives==
Take [[Liam (child)|Liam]] to meet a [[pirate]] outside of Freehold in [[Tiragarde Sound]]. Make sure to call for him if he is not present when you get there.
* Visit [[Freehold]]
* [[Kul Tiran Orphan Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Orphan Matron Westerson|orphan matron]] is always telling us what to do! Study your books, practice your words, behave in public...

What if I want to be a pirate when I grow up? A scourge of the high seas! Finding buried treasure, dueling my enemies on the mast, wearing cool hats!

Pirates never come into [[Boralus]], so I've only ever heard stories. I wanna meet a real one! Can you take me to Freehold? I'll practice my pirate voice on the way.

YARRRRR!

==Progress==
Yo ho, yo ho!

Look at my new hat! What a nice pirate man.

==Notes==
Arriving at Freehold:
:{{text|say|Liam|Whoa, <name>! Look how cool that place is!}}
:''The [[Irontide Recruiter]] nearby turns and walks up to Liam.''
:{{text|say|Irontide Recruiter|Oi, kid! What ye be doin' here? This is no place for a kid yer age!}}
:{{text|say|Liam|Are you a real pirate?!}}
:{{text|say|Irontide Recruiter|Of course I am! What's it to ye?}}
:{{text|say|Liam|You have a real hat and everything! You're so cool! Do you sail and swashbuckle and find buried treasure?!}}
:{{text|say|Irontide Recruiter|I... uh... yes?}}
:{{text|say|Liam|When I grow up I wanna be just like you! Forget the rules! I'm gonna live a life of adventure on the high seas!}}
:''The Irontide Recruiter kneels.''
:{{text|say|Irontide Recruiter|Hold on, kid. A pirate's life ain't all that great. Ye'll never have a warm [[hearth]] or yer own bed. And upstanding citizens will call ye a no-good vagrant!}}
:{{text|say|Liam|But you still get a cool hat!}}
:{{text|say|Irontide Recruiter|That I do, kid. Here, I've got an extra. Now get back and finish yer studyin'. Don't grow up too fast.}}
:''The recruiter stands back up and Liam now sports his very own pirate hat.''
:{{text|say|Liam|Whoa, thanks mister pirate man!}}
