{{wqr|bfa}}

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Did you see the looks on their faces?! Oh, that was priceless! They'll be cleaning up for days!}}

This is a replay of [[Rodrigo's Revenge]].

Hop on the [[Riding Macaw]] behind [[Rodrigo]] on the poop deck.

While on the world quest, keep an eye out for four suspicious objects:
*[[Banana Hoard]] {{co|76.1|84.6|Tiragarde Sound}} on top of a house 
*[[Sweete's Feast]] {{co|73.4|83.9|Tiragarde Sound}} by the arena
*[[Cart o' Cutlasses]] {{co|75.0|82.9|Tiragarde Sound}}
*[[Blacktooth Brew]] {{co|76.7|81.8|Tiragarde Sound}}

Nail all four objects to earn the achievement [[Bless the Rains Down in Freehold]].
