==Objectives==
Accompany [[Jaina Proudmoore]] to an audience with [[Katherine Proudmoore]].
* Audience with Katherine Proudmoore

==Description==
They're not letting us any closer to [[Proudmoore Keep|the keep]]. We'll have to walk from here.

Returning to [[Boralus]] has stirred feelings I thought I'd left behind - memories smoothed away by the years like stones in the tide.

It all feels raw again.

I do not know how this will end - only that we must try.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|60|}}
* 12,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
Hope you had a nice nap. You're gonna need your strength.

== Notes ==

An [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|fD9yrI1wAR8|urlArgs=start=28&end=134}}
:''Jaina and the player start walking in the direction of Proudmoore Keep, where three mounted guards intercept them.''
:{{text|say|Boralus Guard|Halt! State your intentions!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I am Jaina Proudmoore. I have come for an audience with Lord Admiral Katherine Proudmoore... my mother.}}
:{{text|say|Boralus Guard|We're taking you to Katherine, all right.}}
:''Two armed guards walk up behind Jaina and the adventurer.''
:{{text|say|Boralus Guard|You will answer to her for your crimes against Kul Tiras.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|As you wish.}}
:''The lead guard starts clearing a path, with a large number of guards lining the way.''
:{{text|say|Boralus Guard|Clear the way! Dangerous prisoners coming through!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I see the city guard is as disciplined as ever. My father was so proud of them.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|And now they see me as a criminal.}}
:''A large crowd has gathered, looking on at the scene..''
:{{text|say|Kul Tiran Child|Mommy, who is that lady?}}
:{{text|say|Boralus Citizen|Come on, we're going home. Now!}}
:''The mother and daughter walk away from the crowd.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I suppose I have earned this.}}
:{{text|yell|Boralus Guard|Get those civilians back! Form a perimeter!}}
:{{text|say|Boralus Worker|It's the daughter of the sea!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Lady Jaina... Is that really her?}}
:{{text|say|Boralus Worker|Sh-she's come back to finish us!}}
:{{text|yell|Boralus Citizen|Murderer!}}
:{{text|yell|Boralus Worker|Traitor!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will suffer what I must...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|For the Alliance.}}
:''The party approaches Proudmoore Keep as the cutscene concludes..''

Another cutscene plays for the Audience with Katherine Proudmoore objective:
{{#ev:youtube|3LMNG2UKuig}}
:''Katherine Proudmoore and Priscilla Ashvane exit the keep.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|So... my wayward daughter returns to the kingdom she betrayed?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|Why?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|I have come to ask Kul Tiras for aid on behalf of the Alliance.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Priscilla Ashvane|The Alliance? HA!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Priscilla Ashvane|Where were they when we begged for their help?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Priscilla Ashvane|When our husbands, and sons, and brothers were slaughtered at Theramore?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Do not blame the Alliance for my actions.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Priscilla Ashvane|So you admit it. You admit that you were responsible for the deaths of our men!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|I was.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|But I will do anything in my power to ease the suffering of Kul Tiras!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Priscilla Ashvane|Katherine... enforce our laws. The punishment for treason... is death.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|Do you accept the judgment of your homeland?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|I accept your judgment... mother.}}
:''Katherine tears Daelin's pendant off Jaina's neck.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|You are no daughter of mine.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|Do what you will. She is nothing to me.}}

After the cutscene, the adventurer wakes up stripped of his/her armor in a cell on [[Tol Dagor]]. [[Flynn Fairwind]] is humming the beginning of the sea shanty "[[Daughter of the Sea]]":
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Beware... beware... the daughter of the sea... hmm... hmm...}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Heyyy, look who's finally awake.}}

Speak with Flynn to continue.

Should players wish to replay the cutscene, simply abandon the quest to be teleported back to the ship at the Boralus dock.
