* Gnoll targets jabbed (6)
* Paper Zeppelin shot down (2)
* Fences jumped (8)

==Description==
You may know how to ride already, but you don't know how to ride like a Kul Tiran!

We'll let you borrow a horse for the festivities. Take one of our lesson masters, Cooper. He's trained many a beginner in his day!

Mount up, get in the ring, and show us what you've got! I'm sure you'll be a quick learner!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|22|60|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Kul Tiran riding is a true show of mastery and sport!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! I think you're ready to take it to the next level!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|Combat prowess is an important requirement for Kul Tiran riders. Display your harpoon skills on the gnoll targets!}}

Hop on Cooper. It has three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Rapid Dash|range=20|Gain a bust of speed for 1 sec. During a Rapid Dash, Harpoon Jab will always land a critical strike.|notes=2.5 sec recharge. Max 2 Charges|id=252847|icon=ability_mount_charger}}
#{{Abilities|Harpoon Jab|range=15|cd=0.5 sec|Jab with your harpoon, striking targets in front of you. During Rapid Dash, Harpoon Jab will always land a critical strike.|notes=Instant.|id=253030|icon=inv_polearm_2h_kultirasquest_b_01}}
#{{Abilities|Bolas|range=40|cd=3 sec|Throw a bolas at the target. Riding over an enemy tangled in bolas will drag the enemy behind you.|id=253494|icon=inv_jewelry_necklace_92}}

Use the Jab ability just as the horse reaches the barrel. Upon jabbing six:
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|The Roughnecks have already introduced you to their favorite tool, the bolas! Practice throwing them on horseback by shooting down the flying zeppelins. They're a bit rare, but are worth a lot of points!}}

[[Paper Zeppelin (Tiragarde Sound)|Paper Zeppelins]] are flying around the arena. Target them, then use the Bolas ability. After snagging two:
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|And of course, my favorite part, the jumping! Show your equestrian expertise by jumping over the fences. The more you jump, the more impressive the rest of your actions will be!}}

Run and jump by hitting the space bar. After jumping eight fences:
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|You're a natural, friend!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|You and Cooper make a wonderful team! Feel free to ride him around the estate as much as you'd like.}}
