==Objectives==
Slay Haughton Francis and recover his cipher.
* [[Haughton Francis]] slain
* [[Ashvane Cipher Ring]]

==Description==
I'm betting that one page of jibberish is a coded message. We can send it back to [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] to be cracked by our codebreakers or we could break some heads and find the cipher here.

I'm thinking we'll just save some time and do that.

The guy in charge here probably has what we're looking for. Why don't you take him out and see if you can't find it. Even if you don't, without a leader the loyalists won't be much trouble. It's a win-win!

Well, for us I guess.

("Haughton Francis: Slay Haughton Francis.")

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find a cipher? Or some kind of decoding gadget?

==Completion==
A decoder ring? Can't go wrong with the classics I guess.

<[[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey]] uses the ring to decode the message.>

This is from [[Priscilla Ashvane|Ashvane]] alright. The date on here is pretty old though. The "patron" she mentions is something they're gonna want to hear about back in [[Boralus]].

==Notes==
Francis is inside a building.
