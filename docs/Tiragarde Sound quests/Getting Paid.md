Meet with [[Tagart]] at the [[Roughneck Camp]].

Now that we got our mitts good and bloody, I think it's time we head back to camp.

I'll run ahead, so you can finish up whatever business you got. Just remember to meet Tagart for your pay.

* {{cost|19|40|}}
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
Here's your pay. You seem suited for the Roughneck life. Come back sometime if you need work.
