:{{Text|say|Rexxar|...but we can follow the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief]]'s plan for now. One guilty [[human]] out is worth the lives that will be spared.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|I still have an uneasiness, Rexxar. I advise caution in doing as one is told, when it is against their better judgment.}}
