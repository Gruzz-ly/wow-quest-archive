'''Tiragarde Sound''' begins the [[Tiragarde Sound storyline]] for Alliance characters. Pick it up from the [[Scouting Map]] behind [[Taelia]] at the [[Harbormaster's Office]] in [[Boralus]].

==Objectives==
Offer to investigate the [[Ashvane Trading Company]].

==Description==
We must convince [[Katherine Proudmoore]] to pledge [[Kul Tiras]] to the Alliance. [[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]] believes the Ashvane Trading Company's new gunpowder is our best lead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
Maybe with your help we can restore the people's faith in Proudmoore leadership.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Taelia|All right, Flynn. What's this big lead of yours? Something about Ashvane having a new gunpowder?}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|How is that a lead? They're making new weapons all the time.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Not like this, they aren't.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Emissary! Mind giving our skeptical colleagues here a demonstration?}}

Flynn offers the next quest, [[The Smoking Gun]].
