==Objectives==
Report to [[Genn Greymane]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].

==Description==
So, we meet again.

I... apologize for how you were treated last time. I trusted [[Priscilla Ashvane|Priscilla]] like a sister and-- 

<[[Katherine Proudmoore|Katherine]] chokes up for a moment before regaining her composure.>

Let us keep this brief, for I will make no promises nor any formal accords in this state.

Return to your leaders. Tell them I wish to parley.

That is all for now. My people have suffered a great deal today and I have much to reflect upon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|60|}}
* 12,340 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]
*[[Admiralty's Upholstered Chair]]

You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Sea Raider's Breastplate]]
*[[Outrigger Chainmail]]
*[[Freebooter Tunic]]
*[[Sea Raider's Greathelm]]
*[[Navigator's Circlet]]
*[[Outrigger Helm]]
*[[Freebooter Cowl]]
*[[Navigator's Robes]]

==Completion==
So, Katherine is willing to speak with us at last?

Well done.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Lord Admiral, perhaps we should get back to the keep. I can review the evidence against House Ashvane with you there.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Certainly. And your name is?}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Taelia, ma'am.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Taelia... Of course. Our young ward from across the sea. Has it already been so long?}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|You've grown into a valiant young woman, Taelia. [[Bolvar Fordragon|Your father]] would be proud.}}

Head back to the [[Harbormaster's Office]] to turn in.

This concludes the "Enemies Within" chapter [[A Sound Plan]]. There are a few other side chains required to earn the achievement on the [[Tiragarde Sound storyline]]. Also, work on the [[Drustvar storyline]] or [[Stormsong Valley storyline]] and don't forget about the [[Alliance War Campaign]] quests.
