==Objectives==
Free 5 Entangled Lumberjacks in Algerson Lumber Yard.
* [[Entangled Lumberjack]]s freed (5)

==Description==
My father is incapable of seeing what's in front of his very nose. He holes himself up in his office, not leaving to go home until late at night...

Here I am, his only son, trapped out here along with all of his workers. Are they in trouble? Yes! But father will never believe them.

If he won't try to get to the bottom of this attack, I will do it myself!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Can't you see I'm trying to run a business here?

==Completion==
My son is far too soft-hearted. He needs to harden up if he's going to run this business one day!

==Notes==
While on [[Inventory Deficit]] and [[Maximizing Resources]], find [[Benjamin Algerson]] rooted on the dock. He offers this quest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Benjamin Algerson|I'm going to go check on the workers in the woods. If we're in danger here, I worry about their safety out there!}}

Defeat [[Timberbough Invader]]s and [[Timberfang Lurker]]s for their masks, "recover" axes from dead [[Stormsong Forester]]s, and free [[Entangled Lumberjack]]s.

Keep an eye out for the rare [[Lumbergrasp Sentinel]] in the area as well!

On return:
:{{text|say|Algerson Lumberjack|Now spiders are attacking in the woods! We can't chop trees when we're being killed, boss!}}
:{{text|say|Maynard Algerson|You're scared of spiders now? Just squish them under your foot!}}
