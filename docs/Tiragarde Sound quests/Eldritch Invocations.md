==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Director Deepwarden.jpg|Director Deepwarden|The [[cultist]] leader is none other than Director Deepwarden. As long as he lives, the cultists will continue to regroup.}}
Kill Director Deepwarden in [[Krakenbane Cove]].
* [[Director Deepwarden]] slain {{co|30.0|19.4|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
This is my fault, my friend.

The leader of these cultists is none other than Director Deepwarden, a man who I once trusted as an advisor and business partner.

It seems he did not approve of how I ran our operation... to a ludicrous degree.

He gave his humanity for power, using his frustration to overthrow the village from the inside. Who knows what he plans next.

I can no longer stand idly by. Take out Deepwarden. Show him that Anglepoint will not fall to his madness.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I trusted Deepwarden. He always seemed a good man.

Nevertheless, we cannot allow such [[Blasphemy|blasphemy]].

==Completion==
Is this truly the end?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eldritch Invocations]], [[Death in the Depths]], [[Deep Sea Defilement]] & [[Those Aren't Fish Eggs]] before heading out, and don't forget about the bonus objective: [[Creature Corruption]].

Deepwarden is in the same cave as the Western Pylon. The mouth of that cave is at {{co|30.9|21.6|Tiragarde Sound}} in the northwestern end of the quest area.

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Director Deepwarden|You are too late! You cannot stop the tide that rises before you!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Director Deepwarden|Uq naggwa... our master... comes for you...}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|My scouts report that the corruption hasn't spread beyond the harbor yet. We're cullin' any monsters that stray too far out.}}
:{{text|say|Brannon Stormsong|Well done, Captain. The longer we can keep it contained, the longer we have to stop it.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|The tides seem to be calming. Perhaps our friend has made some progress.}}
:{{text|say|Okri Putterwrench|Well I sure hope so, because there's something else coming this way!}}

On complete of all five a short cutscene:
:''The camera shifts, showing some fishermen in their boats. Waves appear in what's supposed to be a tranquil harbor. Suddenly, [[Viq'Goth]], a giant kraken appears!''
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|OUTRIGGERS! OPEN FIRE!}}
