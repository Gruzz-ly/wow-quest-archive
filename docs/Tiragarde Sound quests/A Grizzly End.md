==Objectives==
Skin 6 Monstrous Grizzlies.
* [[Monstrous Grizzly]] skinned (6)
* [[Simple Skinning Knife]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Kennings Lodge|This lodge]] serves as the largest supplier of furs and leather to [[Boralus]].

<[[Lord Kennings|Kennings]] puffs out his chest a bit.>

And as its proprietor, it is my duty to ensure every request is met on time. With recent delays, I've decided to take a trip out here to see if the Holtons need my assistance.

We could use any available hands! Take this knife and bring back some pelts from the bears in the nearby pass.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I see that Lord Kennings' idea of assistance hasn't changed since his last visit.

==Completion==
These furs appear to be in fine shape. Your skills should easily make up for any setbacks caused by 'accidents'.

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Pardon Our Rust]], [[A Hunt for Hawk Eggs]], [[A Sweater for Rupert]] and [[WANTED: Ol' Frostclaw]] before heading out.

Then go nuts! There are [[Monstrous Grizzly|Monstrous Grizzlies]] to be skinned (make sure to actually ''use'' the [[Simple Skinning Knife]]!), [[Guarded Quillrat]]s to be looted for their quills, [[Sprung Beartrap]]s to be armed, [[Mountain Raccoon]]s to be killed for their tails, [[Hawk Nest]]s to steal eggs from (and [[Tiragarde Skyhunter]]s to aggro if they're close), and an [[Old Frostclaw|old elite bear]] to be taken out.

On complete of [[Pardon Our Rust]], [[A Grizzly End]] and [[A Hunt for Hawk Eggs]]:
