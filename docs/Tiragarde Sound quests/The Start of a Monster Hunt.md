Investigate the camp wreckage.

* [[Bloody Trail]] {{co|70.7|62.0|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Disturbed Trap]] {{co|70.8|61.4|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
This is the closest I've been to [[Southwatch Game Warden|a dead body]], how exciting! What do you think murdered him?

Regardless, it is my duty to ensure the safety of individuals under my employ. With a combination of my wit and bravery, and your practical skills, we should be able to track it down.

This will be a tale for the ages!

Let's start with looking around the camp, see if you can find any clues.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything? I'm still caught up in examining this poor fellow.

==Completion==
A trail, you say? I wonder where it leads...

==Notes==
;Smashed Crate
:A crate of foodstuff has been crushed by blunt force. Most of its contents have been flattened in the process.

;Bloody Trail
:A pool of dried blood marks the start of a trail of crushed overgrowth. Something heavy, and bleeding, was dragged to the west of the camp.

;Disturbed Trap
:This trap appears to have been set up to deter wildlife from entering the camp. Whatever set it off was large enough to break the trigger.
:Some fur from the attacker is stuck in the jaws.

==Progression==
{{Kennings Lodge}}
