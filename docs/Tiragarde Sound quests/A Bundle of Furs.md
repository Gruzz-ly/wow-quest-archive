==Objectives==
Deliver the Bundle of Warm Furs to [[Dandy Jones]] in [[Hatherford]].
* [[Bundle of Warm Furs]] (Provided)

==Description==
You there! Would you happen to be passing by Hatherford?

I have a delivery to make there, but my normal delivery person fell ill after a trip to Anglepoint. 

Would you mind taking this bundle of furs to Dandy Jones in Hatherford for me? I would go myself, but I must hold down my stall.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|85|}}
* 4,110 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Welcome to my inn, friend! How can  I help ya?

==Completion==
Ah, my furs! Thanks for the delivery. It's getting a bit cold out here - these will be perfect for the beds!

If you need food or a place to lay your head, I can offer you the best!

==Notes==
This is a breadcrumb to [[Hatherford]]. The quest chain starts with [[Worker's Rights]], offered by [[Davey Brindle]] in town. Additionally, a wanted poster starts [[WANTED: Gryphon 'Nappers (quest)]].
