* [[Kurek the Lost|Kill the Wendigo]] {{co|68.1|66.6|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
From the state of this body, I would say a beast with formidable claws or fangs ravaged this camp. You say the trail leads westward? This camp usually houses more than one of Alanna's hunters, I wonder if they are tracking the beast down as well.

Hurry it up! I don't want to spend the day waiting around, track our dangerous quarry!

==Progress==
Lord Kennings claims you two ran into something dangerous?

==Completion==
Thank you for dealing with the threat. I'll see that the men who died out there have a proper send off.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Encase of Emergency]] before heading out. For the duration of the quests, you have the buff Kennings is Near.

Head just west out of camp to find a [[Cold Corpse]] of a [[Midland Stag]]:
:{{text|say|Lord Kennings|What peculiar wounds. They almost remind me of a bear. Do they look like bear wounds to you?}}

Just northwest to find a [[Hunter Corpse]]:
:{{text|say|Lord Kennings|Or maybe not a bear. She looks like she ran afoul with an outlaw, or something.}}

South to find a [[Dead Quillrat]]:
:{{text|say|Lord Kennings|More bear wounds. An outlaw and his pet bear, perhaps?}}

Before going further, consider taking out the rare bear, [[Ranja]], at {{co|68.3|63.6|Tiragarde Sound}} on a small rise.

Just in front of the mouth of the cave to the south is a [[Fresh Stag Corpse]]:
:{{text|say|Lord Kennings|Could it be a combination of the two? Man-bear, or is it bear-man?}}

Enter the cave to find [[Kurek the Lost]]:
:{{text|say|Lord Kennings|A yeti! Well, I was mostly correct. It is man-shaped and hairy like a bear.}}

Head back to [[Kennings Lodge]] to turn in.
