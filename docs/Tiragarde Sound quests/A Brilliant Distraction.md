==Objectives==
Retrieve the Volatile Azerite.
* [[Volatile Azerite]] (8)

==Description==
We plan to be cautious on entry to [[Tol Dagor]].

I imagine our exit will not be as... subtle.

That [[Ashvane Foundry|foundry]] to the west... I hear they made [[:Azerite]] [[explosive]]s there.

Stock up, we will need them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find them all?

==Completion==
Gently...

Maybe [[Valtrois]] should take charge of these. She may be able to stabilize them another way.

==Notes==
*While doing the quests, loot the item from [[Volatile Azerite Weapons]].

==Progression==
{{Through the Front Door}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.0|note=Added.}}
