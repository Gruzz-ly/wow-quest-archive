==Objectives==
Use the Horn of the Mountain to rally 8 Kul Tirans.
* Kul Tirans rallied (8)
* [[Battlehorn of the Mountain]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Kul Tiran]]s won't go down without a fight!

Take this horn. We use it in the mountains to warn each other of danger and lead the charge into battle. Use it to rally our allies against the [[trogg]]s!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
We are stronger together!

==Completion==
Our people defend the estate with renewed vigor!

==Notes==
While dragging troggs, make sure to hit 4 (or use the quest item) to rally the defenders as well.

Complete both quests, and a short cutscene plays:
:''The troggs have been routed and are fleeing!''
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|You've done it again, my friend! Well done!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|My friend, not only did you save my son, but also my festival! Folks will be talking about this one for years!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|Please, enjoy the party. Ride! Eat! Drink! You, my friend, are my honored guest.}}

This concludes the "The Norwington Estate" chapter of the [[Tiragarde Sound storyline]] for [[A Sound Plan]].
