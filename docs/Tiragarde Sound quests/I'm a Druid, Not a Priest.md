==Objectives==
Free 5 cursed raiders.
* Cursed Raiders freed (5)
* [[Repurposed Gilnean Staff]] (provided)

==Description==
The remains of previous trespassers also arose when we set off the main trap.

[[Pendi Cranklefuse|Cranklefuse]] here has been demanding that I help them, and while I can't say I'm too familiar with turning the [[undead]], I believe I have found a solution.

I've modified my staff to remove their curse. Take it and see if you can't help them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Have you tried out that staff yet?

==Completion==
Another victory for [[druid]] [[magic]]! This staff is much more effective than any of Cranklefuse's gadgets.

==Notes==
Shortly after entering the cave of [[Gol Thovas]] proper while on [[Chasing the Leader]] and [[The Ruins Fought Back]] and [[A Marine Out of Water]], find some rather displeased members of the Explorers' League in the middle of an argument:
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|-to fix your mess!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|My mess? MY MESS? I believe YOU were the one to set it off, you insufferable pip-}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|Hyah!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|Ow! That was my shin!}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|You're lucky I can't kick any higher! Don't deny it! You set off the trap!}}

Get within 20 yards of a [[Cursed Raider]] and use the quest item's ability to aggro it and make it a temporary pet.

On complete of both:
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|An opening! I'll race you out, Birch! Bet you can't catch me, even if you are part dog!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|Wait! I am not a dog! And I'm surprised you can even run with those stubby legs of yours. I was certain you would just roll down any general incline.}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|Oooh! When I catch my breath I'm soo going to kick you in the shins for that!}}

==Progression==
{{Gol Thovas}}

==Trivia==
The name of this quest is a reference to the original Star Trek series where the USS Enterprise's surgeon, Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy (Jackson DeForest Kelley), occasionally says in protest "I'm a doctor, not a [relevant profession]", where the relevant profession was replaced with whatever the crew was dealing with at the time.
