==Progress==
I've never seen a monster with such dark energy. We can't let it get through!

==Completion==
My inadequacy to rule lead to Deepwarden's near takeover of not only the fishing operation here, but the village as a whole.

I can no longer allow myself to sit quietly and allow people like him to walk over me to do as they please! I've learned that, thanks to you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Okri Putterwrench|Inform me when you are prepared to go! Time is fleeting, and the monster shall not hesitate!}}

Speak with Okri:
:We are under siege! Come with me to halt the monster's onslaught!

:{{gossip|Let's fly!}}
:{{text|say|Okri Putterwrench|The terror of the sea, swayed by Deepwarden's dark master! Perhaps too large a monster even for the Outriggers.}}
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|Stand firm, Outriggers! Give her all you've got!}}

Hop on one of the Outrigger Cannons (more of a harpoon gun...) on the wall.
:{{text|yell|Outrigger Engineer|Hold the damned thing off while I get this cannon ready to fire!}}

Use the weapon's ability to shoot down the orbs of Erupting Darkness. Once ten have been shot down, hop off and find the Outrigger Engineer:
:{{text|yell|Outrigger Engineer|Alright! Ready when you are!}}

Speak with him:
:Alright! Ready when you are!

:{{gossip|Fire!}}
:{{text|say|Outrigger Engineer|Here goes...}}
:''The engineer lights the fuse, then quickly runs away. The cannon shot lands a direct shot on Viq'Goth, and it flees back into the depths.''
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|And down she goes! A fight for the ages, Outriggers.}}
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|Nicely done, my friend. You're welcome to join us for a hunt anytime! For now, take a gryphon down to Anglepoint. We'll clean up here.}}

The gryphon's just on the other side of the wall. Hop on to return to town.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Brannon Stormsong|Anglepoint has been saved, but my fear still lingers. Deepwarden, as smart a man as he was, did not hold that kind of power previously.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|Deepwarden... he was always clever, but I never knew him to dabble with magic such as this. To harness a power that could cause the ocean such panic...}}
:{{text|say|Brannon Stormsong|Now I must return home. My uncle and his tidesages in [[Stormsong Valley]] may have more information about this dark magic.}}
:{{text|say|Brannon Stormsong|We thank you, ally. You have saved this village, and inspired courage in me. Alby and Therold, please make sure that Anglepoint recovers. You shall hear from me soon.}}

This concludes the "A Shadow Over Anglepoint" chapter of the [[Tiragarde Sound storyline]]. Return to [[Boralus]] to pick another zone's storyline if desired.
