'''Drustvar''' begins the [[Drustvar storyline]] for Alliance characters. Pick it up from the [[Scouting Map]] behind [[Taelia]] at the [[Harbormaster's Office]] in [[Boralus]].

==Objectives==
Offer to make contact with [[House Waycrest]].

==Description==
The stalwart protectors of House Waycrest hold fast along the western border, but recently all contact with them has been lost. We must secure their aid in order to bring [[Kul Tiras]] together under the Proudmoore banner.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've only been to [[Drustvar]] once, on a hunting trip. It's a rugged land with a dark history and superstitious people. Steel yourself for this one.
