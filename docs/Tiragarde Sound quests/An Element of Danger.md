==Objectives==
Collect 8 Rugged Boar Tusks.
* [[Rugged Boar Tusk]] (8)

==Description==
These nobles really think killing weasels is the mark of a good [[hunter]]? Ha!

It ain't hunting if there isn't a bit of danger involved. There are [[boar]]s in these woods. That's more our speed out in the mountains! Why don't you kill some of those, then bring me their tusks as proof?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Boars actually present some semblance of challenge to the hunter.

==Completion==
<Harold lets out a hardy laugh.>

Now that's what I'm talking about!

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Stoat Hunt]] and [[An Element of Danger]] and [[Bolas and Birds]] before heading out.

While in the quest area, keep an eye out for [[Caleb Batharen]], who offers [[Settle the Score]].

On complete of all three:

:''The horse bolts!''
:{{text|say|Melissa Kenny|Eddie!!!}}

==Progression==
{{The Norwington Estate}}
