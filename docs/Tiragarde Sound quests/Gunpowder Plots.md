==Objectives==
Collect 6 Kegs of Gunpowder.
*[[Gunpowder Keg]] (6)
*Find Rosaline Madison past the waterfall in Anglepoint Wharf

==Description==
Since the [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lord Admiral]] iced all of their [[zeppelin]]s, the [[Horde]] are rowing in through the seagate.

The nice, narrow seagate entrance that makes for a great choke point.

I'll have my people haul over a [[cannon]] and some [[ammunition]]. If you collect some gunpowder, we'll set up behind the gate where they won't expect the attack.

We'll blast the Horde to the bottom of the harbor!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite]] (350x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Did you find enough gunpowder?

==Completion==
Excellent! We're all set up here to take out the Horde's boats.
