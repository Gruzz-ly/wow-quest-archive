==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Old Frostclaw.jpg|Old Frostclaw|"He's big and scary." - [[Joey Holton|Joey]]}}
Slay Old Frostclaw.
* [[Old Frostclaw]] slain
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
Old Frostclaw has once again been spotted near the edge of the pass. [[Hunter]]s in the area are advised to keep caution. This larger than average [[bear]] has killed four people to date, I'd hate for you to make it a fifth. 

Any individual who kills the beast will be rewarded, regardless of their occupation.

<Below the huntmistress' signature is a child's drawing of a bear with the words "Ol' Frostclaw" above it.>

You will also receive:
* {{cost|58|20|}}
* 24,680 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Is this about the wanted sign? You better hurry, a good number of hunters are after it as well.

==Completion==
I'll let the hunters know they were beaten to the kill by a passerby. That should humble some of them.

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Pardon Our Rust]], [[A Grizzly End]], [[A Hunt for Hawk Eggs]] and [[A Sweater for Rupert]] before heading out.

Then go nuts! There are [[Monstrous Grizzly|Monstrous Grizzlies]] to be skinned (make sure to actually ''use'' the [[Simple Skinning Knife]]!), [[Guarded Quillrat]]s to be looted for their quills, [[Sprung Beartrap]]s to be armed, [[Mountain Raccoon]]s to be killed for their tails, [[Hawk Nest]]s to steal eggs from (and [[Tiragarde Skyhunter]]s to aggro if they're close), and an [[Old Frostclaw|old elite bear]] to be taken out.
