==Objectives==
Collect 8 Bunches of Seaweed from [[Harbor Seaweed]].
* [[Bunch of Seaweed]] (8)

==Description==
You may not believe it, but seaweed is one of the most important gifts the sea grants to us. Without it, my tonic shall be useless.

I know it is much to ask, but can you go into the harbor and collect some for me? The water is tumultuous in this trying time, but I will give you my blessing.

* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The sea cannot offer its guidance when it is in such pain. I feel as if one of my senses is blinded.

==Completion==
Glorious! This should be plenty.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sharks in the Water]] and [[Stinging Barbs]] before heading out.
