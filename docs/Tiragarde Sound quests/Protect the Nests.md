==Objectives==
Kill 7 Hungry Dewscale.
* [[Hungry Dewscale]] slain (7)

==Description==
Now that [[Tagart]] is done with your hazing... I mean... trials, you can start helping us with some of the work around here.

Some of the nearby [[gryphon]] nests have been overrun with [[saurolisk]]. I fear that the gryphons will make new roosts elsewhere if we don't clear them out.

Head up the road towards the waterfall and take out those saurolisks. Report to Shawn when you're done. He's posted as a lookout there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Get bit?

==Completion==
Bloody saurolisks. Good riddance.

==Notes==
Pick up [[An Offering of Eggs]] before heading out.

While in the quest area, look out for [[Merianae]], a rare saurolisk in a cave beneath the waterfall.

==Progression==
{{Roughneck Camp}}
