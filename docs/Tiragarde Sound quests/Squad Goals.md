==Objectives==
Find the members of [[Taelia]]'s patrol squad.
* [[Carter Riptide]] found
* [[Emma Swiftwind]] found
* [[Tamara Barrie]] found
* [[Edward Nash]] found

==Description==
My patrol squad fought off the [[Horde]] so [[Galeheart]] and I could fly free. I have to stay with the [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lord Admiral]], so I can't look for them on my own. With any luck, they're out there fighting and waiting for reinforcements.

Well, we're here to help save them. Would you find the rest of my patrol squad for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
There was a patrol squad went down around here. They fought well. Shame to see the Horde finish 'em.

==Completion==
They fought like [[Outriggers]] when the Horde showed up. True [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] steel, one and all.

I'll see to it the injured are protected until we can get out and I'll give the able-bodied ones some blades.

I imagine they'll want to repay the Horde for the loss of their friend.
