==Objectives==
Gather 6 Drust Relics.
* [[Drust Relic]] (6)

==Description==
[[Birch Tomlin|Birch]] and I are helping out the expedition with field studies. I'm not much of a fighter, but I can't make another mistake, they might demote me!

Could you recover some of the relics we packed up in boxes around the cave?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Did you find enough relics?

==Completion==
I can't wait to see what sort of power I can squeeze out of these.

==Notes==
Shortly after entering the cave of [[Gol Thovas]] proper while on [[Chasing the Leader]] and [[The Ruins Fought Back]] and [[A Marine Out of Water]], find some rather displeased members of the Explorers' League in the middle of an argument:
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|-to fix your mess!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|My mess? MY MESS? I believe YOU were the one to set it off, you insufferable pip-}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|Hyah!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|Ow! That was my shin!}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|You're lucky I can't kick any higher! Don't deny it! You set off the trap!}}

Relics are found in crates of [[Packaged Relics]] all over the cave.

On complete of both:
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|An opening! I'll race you out, Birch! Bet you can't catch me, even if you are part dog!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|Wait! I am not a dog! And I'm surprised you can even run with those stubby legs of yours. I was certain you would just roll down any general incline.}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|Oooh! When I catch my breath I'm soo going to kick you in the shins for that!}}

==Progression==
{{Gol Thovas}}
