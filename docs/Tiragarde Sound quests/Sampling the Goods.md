==Objectives==
[[File:Raw Azerite Sample.jpg|thumb|Small Azerite Sample]]
Collect the Chemist's Notes and a Raw Azerite Sample.
* [[Chemist's Notes]]
* [[Raw Azerite Sample]]

==Description==
[[Bridgeport]] is a major trade hub for this area. Naturally, [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane]] has offices and workshops here.

Check around town and see if you can learn anything about this new material and how they're using it.

If you can lift a sample for us to send back to [[Boralus]], even better.

I gotta stay here and keep an eye on someone.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|9|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
<Flynn side-eyes you while trying his best to look casual.>

You get what we need?

==Completion==
Good, I'll hang onto them for now.

I think I've found our next lead.

==Notes==
The [[Chemist's Notes]] are on a table with an [[Ashvane Chemist]] watching over it. Inspect them:
:"After finally discovering a suitable base, we have successfully produced a stable compound.
:In this state, it can be stored, transported, or introduced into the mixing process to make a terribly potent black powder!
:I am so confident in its stability that initial samples were sent to Boralus suspended inside a necklace.
:As we run the cauldrons day and night mixing powder, work also continues on prototyping further applications. Our most promising so far is a pistol, which we hope will make another suitable gift for our esteemed Lady Chairman."
:<The disorganized notes go on to detail various projects and aspirations.>
:{{gossip|<Take the notes.>}}

Find a [[Raw Azerite Sample]] further west in a small satchel.
