==Objectives==
Gather 50 Toxic Stingers.
*[[Toxic Stinger]] x50

==Description==
A traveler? Nobody uses this trail unless they got a death wish.

The only thing more poisonous than the marrowflies are the [[saurolisk]]s that eat 'em all day.

That marrowfly toxin is what I'm here for. Y'see, I'm a purveyor of, uh... specialty goods. And my clients are just dyin' for more of my product. Heh.

You bring me their stingers, I pay you. Simple as that. 

You can even find 'em in the saurolisks, if you don't mind gettin' your hands dirty.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got them stingers?

==Completion==
Pleasure doin' business with you.

In the future I'll make sure you get a special discount. Heh.

==Notes==
While "escorting" Flynn to Freehold on [[Lovesick and Lost]], he runs across [[Skinner MacGuff]], who offers this quest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Toxic stingers? I'm sure those serve a totally legitimate purpose.}}

Flynn handily goes on a loop of the area near a whole bunch of [[Marrowfly|Marrowflies]]. Take them out.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|You all done with your side job, are you? Can we get a little <hic> professionalism here?}}
