==Objectives==
Kill 6 Invading Dreadmaws.
* [[Invading Dreadmaw]] slain (6)

==Description==
Recently a large gam of sharks has moved into the shallower water in the harbor. I have dealt with minor illnesses before that were caused by creatures carrying foreign contaminants to shore.

Perhaps the [[shark]]s have brought something in from the deeper waters? Cull some of the sharks that have wandered too close to the pier. I shall read the tides for any changes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
The sea's creatures travel where they may find food, but they carry danger with them.

==Completion==
Unfortunate... the tides still speak the same.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Cure from the Sea]] and [[Stinging Barbs]] before heading out.

Try to stay on the seafloor while gathering Harbor Seaweed, killing [[Barbtail Stingray]]s for their [[Intact Venomous Barb]]s and slaying [[Invading Dreadmaw]]s.

==Progression==
{{The Shadow over Anglepoint}}
