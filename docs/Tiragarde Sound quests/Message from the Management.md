==Progress==
Find anything useful in there?

Most folks workin' for the Ashvane Trading Company don't know how rotten they are, or don't have any other choice.

The sooner we take down Priscilla the better.

==Notes==
While in the [[Ashvane Foundry]] for [[Suspicious Shipments]], [[Labor Dispute (quest)]], and [[Small Haulers]], find one of a number of [[Posted Notice]]s tacked to the walls to start this quest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Faithful employees! Effective immediately, all shifts are doubled. We do not ask this of you lightly. Your hard work ensures the safety of Kul Tiras in these uncertain times!}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Regarding increase company presence on site: Rest assured, they are here for your safety.}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Given the rumors of foreign invaders and spies among us, we can never be too careful. Obey their instructions to avoid any unseemly incidents.}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Kindly direct inquires to [[Forgemaster Farthing|Mister Farthing]] or [[Taskmaster Williams|Mister Williams]].}}

Taskmaster Williams is found in the northernmost big building:
:{{text|say|Taskmaster Williams|Snoopin' around ain't good for yer health!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Taskmaster Williams|Priscilla... will have your head for this...}}

Loot the [[Note to Taskmaster Williams]] from his corpse:
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Suffer no insolence from the soot-smeared rabble. Make examples if you must. All that matters is that our clients get their supplies on time.}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|And burn this note after reading it, you buffoon!}}

Forgemaster Farthing is found on the eastern end of the foundry:
:{{text|say|Forgemaster Farthing|I'll pound ya flat!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Forgemaster Farthing|I'm... clockin' out... one last time...}}

Loot the [[Note to Forgemaster Farthing]] from his corpse:
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|I don't care how you do it, I want those forges running day and night!}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|The chemists are producing excellent powder. You WILL keep them supplied with refined Azerite, or I'll find someone who can.}}

Additionally, there are other suspicious objects like [[Azerite-Dusted Blade]]s all over the foundry that can be used (via the extra action button) to do some extra damage to enemies.

Finally, there's a Small Treasure Chest near [[Forgemaster Farthing]]. It contains a poor-quality item and some [[War Resources]].
