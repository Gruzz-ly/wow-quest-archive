*[[Bilge Rat Orders]]
*[[Cutwater Corsair Orders]]
*[[Blacktooth Bruiser Orders]]

==Description==
So the [[Irontide Raiders]] are bringing the various outlaw crews together for a big job using weapons provided by the [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane Company]].

Something tells me they're not going fishing.

We should see if members of the smaller crews are carrying any notes or orders. I trust you can handle it?

I need to lay low and catch up with [[Venrik]]. If anyone else were to recognize me, the odds of them offering a friendly drink are precisely zero.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Find anything?

==Completion==
I- I'll try to make sense of these.

You've gotta help [[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]]!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Recruiting Efforts]] before heading out. Additionally, [[Missing Treasure!]] can be picked up from the [[Sternly Worded Letter]] just outside.
