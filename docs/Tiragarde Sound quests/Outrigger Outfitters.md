==Objectives==
Recover 10 Outrigger Weapons.
* [[Outrigger Weapon]] (10)

==Description==
My people met the [[Horde]] head on when they arrived, but we've been scattered over the wharf. The Horde has been relentless. We haven't been able to form a solid resistance force using just our fists as weapons.

But now the [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lord Admiral]] is here with the [[Adventurer|champion]] of the [[Alliance]]. That's just the spark we need to rise up and kick these sorry mongrels out of our lands. If you can get my men some weapons, they'll join the fight!

Find those weapons and meet me back here. I'm working on a plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
For [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]]! For the Lord Admiral!

==Completion==
Now that my people are able to fight back, I have a plan to help stop more of these savages from fouling up [[Anglepoint Wharf|my nice wharf]].

==Progression==
{{War Marches On}}
