==Objectives==
Gather 5 Evermoss Clumps.
*[[Evermoss Clump]] (5)

==Description==
The medics here are doing their best, but they've suffered heavy casualties and are strapped for healing supplies.

With a few clumps of evermoss I could mix a painkilling tincture to ease the suffering of the injured. Can you forage some from the nearby trees?

I'll help get Flynn stabilized. The last thing these people need is another wounded man howling in pain.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Did you find any evermoss?

==Completion==
That should do.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Farmers Who Fight]] and [[Air Raid]] before heading out.

Evermoss grows on trees.

==Progression==
{{Defenders of Daelin's Gate}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
