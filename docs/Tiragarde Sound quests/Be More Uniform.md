==Objectives==
Collect gear from [[Proudmoore Admiralty|Proudmoore]] forces in the foundry.
* [[Proudmoore Equipment]] (12)
* [[Captain's Overcoat]]

==Description==
Head into the [[Ashvane Foundry|foundry]]. Proudmoore's guards have taken over there. They will provide excellent accessories for our disguises.

I can recreate their faces, but without the clothing, we won't make it far.

Gather enough gear to cover us. 

We'll need the [[Captain Serafina|Captain]]'s jacket as well. 

There will be less of a challenge at the gate if we outrank them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Was the harvest successful?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. This is going better than I expected.

==Notes==
*The unavailable [[Proper Parrot]] lists this quest as its source.
*Loot the following items to get the Proudmoore Equipment credit:
**[[Proper Hat]]
**[[Barely Used Bracers]]
**[[Slightly Worn Hauberk]]
**[[Well-Proportioned Pauldrons]]
**[[Scuffed Boot]]
