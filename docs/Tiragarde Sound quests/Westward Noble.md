==Objectives==
Find [[Lord Kennings]].

==Description==
While I loath to involve you in this further, I don't have the men to afford an escort for Lord Kennings. If he gets hurt, we'll all be out of a job. Can you make sure he at least made it to the west camp?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
Oh, you finally made it! I think we have more pressing matters on our hands than hunting deer.

==Notes==
Head west to the [[Stagheart Wash]] to find [[Lord Kennings]] at a sacked camp.

==Progression==
{{Kennings Lodge}}
