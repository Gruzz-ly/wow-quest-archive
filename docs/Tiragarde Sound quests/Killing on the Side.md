==Objectives==
Kill 15 Alliance and Kul Tiran [[soldier]]s in [[Vigil Hill]].
* [[Alliance]] and [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] forces slain (15)

==Description==
Those annoying Alliance nearby are definitely takin' orders from [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]].

That means they gotta die! And any of their Kul Tiran friends, too. They gotta know the [[Horde]] is number one.

And that you don't kidnap someone's roadside assistance!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Show those guys what for.

==Completion==
Good work mopping up those guys, that'll show 'em to mess with the Horde! 

What? They weren't messin' with us? Of course they were, they kidnapped my insurance policy!

==Notes==
Kill [[Vigil Hill Marine]]s, [[Gnomish Engineer (Tiragarde Sound)|Gnomish Engineers]], and [[Gnomish Spider Tank]]s.

==Progression==
{{Mekkatorque's Battle Plans}}
