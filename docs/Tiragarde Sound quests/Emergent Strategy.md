==Objectives==
Find [[Benjamin Algerson]] near [[Fernwood Ridge]].

==Description==
My son went where? Chasing our workers into the woods once again?

That boy is too soft-hearted. No matter what I do, he will never be strong enough to take over the family business.

I demand he come back this instant. He's got better ways to spend his time than going on wild goose chases for our employees!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Father is blinded in his pursuit of success. If he won't listen to our employees, I must!

==Progression==
{{Hatherford}}

==Patch changes==
