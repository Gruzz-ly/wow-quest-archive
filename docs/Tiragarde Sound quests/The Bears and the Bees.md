==Objectives==
Kill 8 Scruffhide Bears and gather 6 Sticky Bee Honey from nearby [[Beehive]]s.
* [[Sticky Bee Honey]] (6)
* [[Scruffhide Bear]] slain (8)

==Description==
Hey, while you're out, would you grab some honey for me and the boys?

Plenty of hives out in the woods, but I'd be careful if you don't want to dirty your delicate house cat hands. Bears out here tend to get pretty vicious when they smell honey.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Bears giving you trouble?

==Completion==
You got more on your shirt than you got in the bottles! I'd ask you to shower, but frankly none of us have done that in weeks.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hold Still]] before heading out. There's also a wanted poster that begins [[WANTED: The Hornet (Alliance)]].

Keep an eye out for [[Totes]] the goat, which croaks the [[Goat's Tote]]!

[[Beehive]]s are at the base of trees. When interacted with, players find themselves Covered in Honey for ~17 seconds, which slows their movement speed by 30% and increases the aggro radius (by 15 yards) of nearby mobs, including [[Scruffhide Bear]]s and [[Goldcoat Stinger]]s.

While searching for [[The Hornet]] over on the east end of the weald, look for [["Helpless" Henry]], hiding behind a rock near [[Brawr]]. He offers [[Helping Henry]].

On complete of [[Hold Still]] and [[The Bears and the Bees]]:
