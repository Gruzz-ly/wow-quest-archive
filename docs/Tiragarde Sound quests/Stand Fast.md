==Objectives==
Protect Jaina Proudmoore.
* Speak with [[Jaina Proudmoore]]
* Jaina Proudmoore Protected

==Description==
The [[Horde]] will pay for what it has done, but first I have to attend to the people here. 

<Name>, I need to hold a portal open so the injured can evacuate to [[Boralus]].

Keep the Horde's forces off me while the wounded get to safety. We can deal with them once the civilians are safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
That's the last of the wounded.

==Completion==
If the attackers didn't know we were here before, they know now.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Jaina
{{Dialogue|
I knew returning home would be dangerous, but I had to take the chance. I did not expect to find healing.

{{Gossip|I'm ready to face the Horde.}}
