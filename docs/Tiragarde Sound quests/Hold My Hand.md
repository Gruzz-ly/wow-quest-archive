The player gets an escort buff:
:{{Abilities|Escorting Penny Hardwick|id=259909|Penny wants you to hold her hand.|icon=achievement_worldevent_childrensweek}}

If the player gets too far away from her, she stops and cries in place until they rejoin her:
*{{text|say|Penny "Precious" Hardwick|Where are you going?}}
*{{text|say|Penny "Precious" Hardwick|Wait! We have to hold hands!}}
*{{text|say|Penny "Precious" Hardwick|Please, don't leave me.}}

At {{co|53.7|35.7|Tiragarde Sound}}, the player is ambushed by two [[Alluring Siren]]s:
:{{text|say|Penny "Precious" Hardwick|Is this the right way?}}

After the player defeats the sirens, Penny wades across a bit of shallow water:
:{{text|say|Penny "Precious" Hardwick|Good thing I wore my boots!}}

At {{co|51.2|34.6|Tiragarde Sound}}, Penny stops to look at a waterfall while the player is ambushed by two more Alluring Sirens:
:{{text|say|Penny "Precious" Hardwick|Ooh, pretty!}}

By [[Earless Joe]]:

:{{text|say|Earless Joe|Oh hey, Penny. Heading to see your dad?}}
