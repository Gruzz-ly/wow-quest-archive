==Objectives==
Send the targets chosen by [[Valtrois]] back for examination.
* [[Drusilla Whiteblade]] sent
* [[Rosie Walker]] sent
* [[Ollie Oakman]] sent
* [[Shard of Vesara]] (provided)

==Description==
We have decided that our best course of action would be to enter the prison disguised as Proudmoore military. [[Rexxar]] will be our [[prisoner]].

We want to keep a low profile until we break [[Priscilla Ashvane|Ashvane]] out.

I find that I work better with reference when undertaking this type of endeavor.

I have chosen some [[human]]s that interest me. I would like to examine their faces.

Use the Shard of Vesara on them, and they will be... encouraged to find their way to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Did you find all of my specimens?

==Completion==
Humans can be so malleable.
