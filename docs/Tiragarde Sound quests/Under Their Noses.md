==Objectives==
Speak with [[Flynn Fairwind]] in [[Bridgeport]].

==Description==
Figures they wouldn't just put the destination on the crates for us. 

Nothing's ever easy, is it?

If the weapons aren't moving on [[Cagney]]'s ferry, they must be passing through Bridgeport, the shipping hub just up the road.

Bridgeport is protected by a garrison of [[Proudmoore Admiralty|Proudmoore]] marines. The [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane Company]] has a lot of nerve moving illegal weapons right under their noses.

Come on, let's check it out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Flynn pretends not to notice you, but whispers at you.>

Of course it's [[Captain Keelson|her]].

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Cagney, get [[Rescued Urchin|these kids]] on a ferry back to town. Taelia will make sure they get placed into a shelter.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Mate, I'll see you up ahead.}}

Head just down the road to the southwest to enter [[Bridgeport]] nonchalantly leaning up against a lamp post.

This concludes the "The Ashvane Trading Company" chapter of the [[Tiragarde Sound storyline]]. The main storyline continues with [[Sampling the Goods]].

Don't forget the flight path! There are some side quests in the area too:
*[[The Hunters of Kennings Lodge]]
*[[An Overrun Mine]]
*[[Left at the Port]]
