Slay 15 workers at the [[Ashvane Foundry]].
* [[Ashvane Company|Ashvane]] workers slain (15)

I suppose we'll have to kill them, then.

* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
You go on ahead. I'll take out a few myself.

==Completion==
<Lilian bounces her blade in her hands, looks up, and nods approvingly at you.>

==Notes==
Kill [[Company Enforcer]]s, [[Company Fusilier]]s, [[Foundry Worker]]s, and [[Company Watchman|Company Watchmen]].
