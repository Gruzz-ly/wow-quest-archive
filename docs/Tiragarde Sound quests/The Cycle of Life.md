*Stop 20 [[Juvenile Turtle]]s From Reaching the Ocean

==Description==
:{{text|say|Scrollsage Nola|These tiny crabs need help! I hate to see any living thing suffer. Would you be willing to lend a hand?}}

==Rewards==
Depending on zone and player faction, you will receive:
*+175 [[reputation]] with [[Tortollan Seekers]]
*{{Alliance}} +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]], [[Proudmoore Admiralty]], [[Storm's Wake]], or [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*{{Horde}} +75 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]], [[Voldunai]], [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]], or [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

You will also receive one of the following:

*An [[Azerite (resource)]] item
*[[War Resources]]
*[[Tortollan Trader's Stock]]

==Progress==
:{{Text|say|Scrollsage Nola|The cycle of life can be cruel...}}

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Scrollsage Nola|All creatures in nature must live together in balance. But I can't help cheering for the little turtles!}}

==Notes==
Speak with Nola to enter a [[Armored Claw|vehicle]] with three abilities.

{{Dialogue|
These tiny crabs need help! I hate to see any living thing suffer. Would you be willing to lend a hand?

{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
}}

Two of the vehicle options are moving left and right. Turtles can only be killed by a crab that enters the same row, within a limited distance of the turtle, and within a limited time frame of entering. The last requirement is likely to prevent winning by idling.

Killing a turtle grants the player a shell, which the player can throw to kill all turtles on the same row between the player and Nola. The shell is consumed on use.

The player must also dodge attacks similar to the player's in [[Beachhead]]. The player's crab dies in three hits, but turtles killed carry on into subsequent attempts.

When a turtle makes it to the water:
:{{text|say|Scrollsage Nola|Another [[A turtle made it to the water|turtle made it to the water]]!}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.5|note=Added.}}
