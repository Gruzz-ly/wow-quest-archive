==Objectives==
Kill 8 Brinefang Saurolisk.
* [[Brinefang Saurolisk]] slain (8)

==Description==
The [[saurolisk|overgrown lizards]] from down on the beach decided to swarm the camp suddenly. 

We're used to dealing with one or two each week, but it seems like the whole brood came up the cliff. Wonder if the smell of blood drew them in.

They're putting our remaining men at risk, wipe them out!

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Have you thinned out those saurolisks yet?

==Completion==
There's one problem dealt with.

==Notes==
Pick up this quest before putting much effort into [[Patching Up the Rear]] from the questgiver just outside the tent.

Also, there's a Gargantuan Saurolisk, the rare [[Broodmother Razora]] at the south end of the quest area.

==Progression==
{{Greystone Keep}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
