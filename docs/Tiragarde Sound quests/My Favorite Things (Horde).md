==Objectives==
Ask Friendly Pete, Hungry Sam and Handy Bill about their missing keepsakes, then collect those items from the [[Wailing Tideway]].
* Speak with [[Hungry Sam]]
* Speak with [[Friendly Pete]]
* Speak with [[Handy Bill]]
* [[Steel Lunchbox]]
* [[Silver Compass]]
* [[Tin Robot]]

==Description==
It's tough out here.

[[Pirate]]s. Deadly monsters.

Hungry Sam's seemingly endless battle with indigestion.

Nothing sets the nerves at ease like an old keepsake. Somethin' to remind you of home. Somethin' to keep you going.

Ask around the camp. Find out what folks might have lost out there in the tideways. If you can bring any of it back, it'd be a mighty kind gesture.

Me? Oh... I had a locket...

Never mind, it's too small, you'd never find it. It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We've all lost something in the tides.

Some more than others.

==Completion==
I didn't think you'd actually find all this stuff!

We don't have much, but here's a little something for your troubles.

==Notes==
Hungry Sam:
:{{Gossip|What's your favorite thing you lost in the wreck?}}
:{{text|say|Hungry Sam|Oh that's easy! My trusty lunchbox. Never a bad meal outta that lunchbox. I miss it dearly.}}

Friendly Pete:
:{{Gossip|What's your favorite thing you lost in the wreck?}}
:{{text|say|Friendly Pete|Hmm... Probably my compass. It never led me astray! Well, until we ended up here. But that's hardly the compass' fault, I mean it's an inanimate object you can't really blame--}}
:{{text|emote|Friendly Pete continues rambling about taking responsibility for your own actions for several minutes.}}

Handy Bill:
:{{Gossip|What's your favorite thing you lost in the wreck?}}
:{{text|say|Handy Bill|I had a toy robot. A little wind-up fellow I bought from a gnome back in Boralus.}}
:{{text|say|Handy Bill|Always liked that little guy. The robot, I mean.}}

Next to the Tin Robot, look for a pile of [[Glimmering Seaweed]]. It starts [[Glimmering Locket (Horde)]].
