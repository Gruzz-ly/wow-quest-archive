==Objectives==
Slay [[Carentan]].
* [[Carentan]] slain
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
Hello again my young friend! I have good news.

Our mutual acquaintance Carentan -- the man who scammed us in [[Freehold]] -- has finally come out of hiding.

I have been communicating with him in letters delivered by various middlemen and even completed a few proxy trades to earn his trust. In our last correspondence, he agreed to meet for an in-person trade.

He thinks he is meeting with a Ms. Pixy Spindlespark, gnomish hairdresser with a weakness for poached furs.

But he'll be meeting you instead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,780 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Don't let him get away this time!

==Completion==
Slow and steady, my friend.

==Notes==
Have you come to beg for handouts like the rest of the stinking rabble outside?

Don't waste your time. I'm here on business.
