==Description==
A... a witch?!

I uh... I would love to help you, truly I would but... I must report to my father.

Why don't you go stop the witch yourself? For a brave adventurer like you, a witch should be no problem.

I'm sure my father would reward you greatly!

You will receive:
*[[Petula's Locket]]
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
My son told me about the witch, <name>. I've come up here to take care of her! If you want something done right, you need to do it yourself.

==Completion==
<Maynard studies the locket.>

That ungrateful woman!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Benjamin Algerson|A witch... why is a witch targeting our operation?! I need to get out of here. I'll tell my father!}}

Head north up the hill along the torch-lit path. On approach:
:{{text|say|Witch of the Woods|Ah, so Maynard sends his goons to solve his problems, as he always does. Well come, goon. I will take care of you as I did the others!}}

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Witch of the Woods|You are a fool to get in my way!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Witch of the Woods|My husband's exploitation of his workers will never end...}}

<!--Just past the house is a small cave with a [[Ritual Effigy]] inside, along with the corpses of [[Gaius Duffy]] and [[Lady Martisha]]. Interact with the effigy to spawn the [[Twin-hearted Construct]].

~80%:
:{{text|say|Gaius Duffy|What... what have we become?}}

~50%:
:{{text|say|Lady Martisha|I was told we could be together this way!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Lady Martisha|She... promised...}}-->

Turn in just across the river at the [[Evergreen Grove]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Maynard Algerson|I wasn't always the president of a successful lumber company, you know.}}
:{{text|say|Maynard Algerson|I came from nothing! I started this business to support my wife and our family.}}
:{{text|say|Maynard Algerson|My work is my life! Forget Petula, forget Benjamin, this is my legacy.}}
:{{text|say|Maynard Algerson|For her to turn to witchcraft to exact revenge against me...}}
:{{text|say|Maynard Algerson|I don't care that she's dead. One fewer person to get in my way.}}
