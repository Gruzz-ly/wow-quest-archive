==Objectives==
Gather 4 V-300 serial plates.
* [[V-300 Serial Plate]] (4)

==Description==
The [[V-300 SENTRY|sentry bots]] here are definitely of gnomish make. If the creator had any sort of proper education, each machine should have some sort of serial code on it.

And if they've been properly documented, I might be able to use those codes to track that gnome down.

Do you think you could bring a few of them back to me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything interesting?

==Completion==
I'll have to send these back to Ironforge and we'll see if they can find anything.

==Notes==
While out and about for [[The Beauty of Marketing]], find [[Parin Tinklocket]] outside the [[Abandoned Junkheap]]. He offers this quest and [[Inspection Gadget]]. Pick them both up before heading out.

Head south into the junkheap, start killing [[V-300 SENTRY]] bots and using the [[R.A.D.A.R.]] while walking around. Steer well clear of the [[Shock Turret]]s' area of effect radius. They sting!

At the south end of the quest area, keep an eye out for the rare [[P4-N73R4]] mechanical panther!

On complete of both:
