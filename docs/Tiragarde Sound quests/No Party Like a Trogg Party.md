==Objectives==
Kill 20 Grimestone [[trogg]]s in [[Norwington Estate]].
* [[Grimestone]] intruders slain (20)

==Description==
Troggs? At my party?

My grandfather pushed them back to [[Mistfall Cleft|that cleft]] years ago to build this estate. To think that they would attack in such force after all these years?

This is just what we needed to make this year's festival the greatest ever!

Show us your heroism firsthand, <name>! Mount [[Cooper (horse)|Cooper]] and defeat these troggs! Drag them behind you, jab them with your harpoon... whatever it takes!

==Progress==
Troggs on the estate grounds? What meaning is this?

==Completion==
A grand showing! You had me on the edge of my seat!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|This is going to be the most exciting festival in years! Hop onto Cooper and show the troggs what for. You will find him most useful in combat!}}

Pick up [[Mountain Sounds]] before heading out.

Hop back on Cooper. He has the three standard abilities, as well as a fourth, useful for Mountain Sounds:
#{{Abilities|Rapid Dash|range=20|Gain a bust of speed for 1 sec. During a Rapid Dash, Harpoon Jab will always land a critical strike.|notes=2.5 sec recharge. Max 2 Charges|id=252847|icon=ability_mount_charger}}
#{{Abilities|Harpoon Jab|range=15|cd=0.5 sec|Jab with your harpoon, striking targets in front of you. During Rapid Dash, Harpoon Jab will always land a critical strike.|notes=Instant.|id=253030|icon=inv_polearm_2h_kultirasquest_b_01}}
#{{Abilities|Bolas|range=40|cd=3 sec|Throw a bolas at the target. Riding over an enemy tangled in bolas will drag the enemy behind you.|id=253494|icon=inv_jewelry_necklace_92}}
#{{Abilities|Battlehorn of the Mountain|range=10|cd=5 sec|Blow the Battlehorn of the Mountain, empowering nearby Kul Tirans|notes=instant|id=272923|icon=inv_misc_horn_02}}

There is also an achievement associated with this quest (or the world quest equivalent), [[Drag Race]]. Use the bolas on troggs and run over them to drag them. Drag five at the same time to earn the achievement.

Try to find five close together and at full health, because the troggs lose health as they're getting dragged.

Complete both quests, and a short cutscene plays:
:''The troggs have been routed and are fleeing!''
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|You've done it again, my friend! Well done!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|My friend, not only did you save my son, but also my festival! Folks will be talking about this one for years!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Aldrius Norwington|Please, enjoy the party. Ride! Eat! Drink! You, my friend, are my honored guest.}}

This concludes the "The Norwington Estate" chapter of the [[Tiragarde Sound storyline]] for [[A Sound Plan]].
