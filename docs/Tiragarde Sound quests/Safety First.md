==Objectives==
Collect 8 Durable Seashells in [[Rockskip Falls]].
* [[Durable Seashell]] (8)

==Description==
The connection between [[horse]] and rider is fascinating to me, and I will never truly understand until I experience it.

But, well, you know... armor! How could I possibly even think to mount one of these beauties without some proper protection?

I saw some waterfalls nearby. There must be shells near the banks of its pools! Would you entertain an old [[Tortollan]] by collecting some for his safety?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Protection, yes. Can't put yourself in a dangerous situation without the proper protection!

==Completion==
Ah yes, these shells will help keep me well safeguarded!

==Progression==
{{The Norwington Estate}}

==Patch changes==
