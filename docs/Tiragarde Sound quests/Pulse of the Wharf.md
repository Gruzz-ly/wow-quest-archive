==Objectives==
Talk to Julian Nichols, Ginger Freelin, and Aaron Gutier in [[Anglepoint Wharf]].
* [[Julian Nichols]] checked {{co|42.3|26.6|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Ginger Freelin]] checked {{co|42.2|27.4|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Aaron Gutier]] checked

==Description==
I am at a loss for ideas, <name>. The tides churn, and I can feel their pain as if it is my own.

While I am out of ideas, perhaps the [[merchant]]s in town may have seen something? They are always watching and gossiping, making them quite good sources of information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
The merchants here generally have a thumb on the pulse of the wharf. If anybody's noticed anything strange in town, it's them.

==Completion==
In the name of the sea! Did you see that?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Algae Shakes]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|Be calm, children of the sea. We must put our faith in the waters to find a cure.}}

Head north to the quest area, and start force-feeding [[Nauseated Villager]]s and talking to the merchants. Additionally, there's a wanted poster, offering [[WANTED: Quartermaster Ssylis (Alliance)]].

;Julian Nichols
:Welcome, welcome! Care for something to eat?
{{gossip|Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?}}
:{{text|say|Julian Nichols|I haven't received any fresh ingredients in days! How am I supposed to make my famous deep fried threshadon without fresh threshadon fins?}}

;Ginger Freelin
:Yes, can I help you?
{{gossip|Noticed anything strange?}}
:{{text|say|Ginger Freelin|You know, I haven't seen that Stormsong kid in a few days. I wish they would put somebody more competent in charge of this place, but who am I to say?}}

;Aaron Gutier
:Need something?
{{gossip|Have you been receiving your shipments?}}
:{{text|say|Aaron Gutier|I actually received a shipment a few minutes ago! Want to take a look?}}
:''Aaron walks over to a barrel and opening it, revealing more [[Infectious Gutworm]]s and a [[Merciless Mindeater]], which takes over Aaron's mind!''
:{{text|yell|Aaron Gutier|AAH! GET THIS THING OFF ME!}}
:{{text|yell|Aaron Gutier|I can't... help... AAAAAUUURGH!}}

Defeat Aaron, who has lost control over his senses.

Brother Therold has relocated up close to the quest area -- turn in to him there.
