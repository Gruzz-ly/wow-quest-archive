==Objectives==
Free 6 Trapped Saurolisks.
* [[Trapped Saurolisk]] freed (6)

==Description==
You cautiously approach a [[saurolisk]] tied to a post. It doesn't snap at you, but looks at you with defeat in its eyes.

The [[trogg]]s seem to be keeping these saurolisks against their will. They should be freed before they are abused further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
What's wrong?

==Completion==
Troggs training saurolisks to be ridden? Seems they've learned from watching us after all.

It's better that you freed them. I don't particularly want to imagine what would happen if the troggs were widely successful in their new riding endeavors!

==Notes==
While in [[Mistfall Cleft]] for [[Following Eddie's Trail]] and [[Troublesome Troglodytes]], keep an eye out for a [[Trapped Saurolisk]], which offers this quest.

Interact with [[Post]]s to free the saurolisks.

==Progression==
