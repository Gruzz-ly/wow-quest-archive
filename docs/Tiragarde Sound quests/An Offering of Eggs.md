==Objectives==
Collect 4 Spotted Gryphon Eggs.
* [[Spotted Gryphon Egg]] (4)

==Description==
Our work isn't only to capture and tame [[gryphon]]s, it's also to preserve them.

Rescue any eggs remaining in nearby abandoned nests. Set them in one of the new nests we've built for the displaced gryphons. I am sure one of the gryphon females will adopt them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
You find a safe nest.

==Completion==
The eggs fit nicely into the new nest.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Protect the Nests]] before heading out.

While in the quest area, look out for [[Merianae]], a rare saurolisk in a cave beneath the waterfall.

==Progression==
{{Roughneck Camp}}
