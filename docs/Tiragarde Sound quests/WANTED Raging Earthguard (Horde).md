==Objectives==
Kill the Raging Earthguard west of [[Norwington Estate]].
* [[Raging Earthguard]] slain
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
I have been receiving formal complaints about some big [[earth elemental]] in the middle of our scouting path.

Normally I'd elect to ignore these, but the sooner we get done here, the better. Nobody wants to be stuck in this frozen hill any longer than we need to.

Payment goes to the person who brings it down!

(Raging Earthguard: This earthly revenant has spawned, threatening all who approach.)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (115x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
What do you want?

==Completion==
Now the complaints should stop. Thanks a lot, pal!

==Trivia==
*During the beta, it was named "WANTED: Living Earthguard".

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
