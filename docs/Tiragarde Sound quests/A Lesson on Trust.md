==Objectives==
Retrieve 8 Marine Identification Badges.
* [[Marine Identification Badge]] (8)

==Description==
The men in the fort were once under my command, and so, they are now my responsibility. Each of them should have a badge we use for identifying individuals under certain circumstances. I would ask you to bring back a number of these as proof of thinning their ranks.

These men are no longer soldiers of [[Boralus]], and as such, no longer deserve to carry the Proudmoore anchor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Did you bring me those badges?

==Completion==
A grim task, but one that needed to be done.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Targeting a Turncoat]], [[A Lesson on Trust]], [[A Boralus Triple Threat]] and [[Free Bird]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{Greystone Keep}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
