==Objectives==
Break 30 Corrupted Eggs in [[Krakenbane Cove]].
* [[Corrupted Egg]] destroyed (30)

==Description==
Corruption has seeped into the sea.

Part of our job is to keep the monsters of these parts under control. A cruel magic has taken over many of the beasts. I take the challenge of the hunt with pride, but too many and we are overrun!

Monster eggs are scattered across the breeding grounds, pulsing with a dark energy.

Get your stompin' boots on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Ah, the satisfying squish of a monster egg under your boot. What a feeling!

==Completion==
It's best to not know what corrupted eggs will hatch into, though I could imagine the fight that we may now never see.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eldritch Invocations]], [[Death in the Depths]] & [[Deep Sea Defilement]] before heading out, and don't forget about the bonus objective: [[Creature Corruption]].

Eggs must be damaged to be destroyed, not merely walked over.

On return:
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|My scouts report that the corruption hasn't spread beyond the harbor yet. We're cullin' any monsters that stray too far out.}}
:{{text|say|Brannon Stormsong|Well done, Captain. The longer we can keep it contained, the longer we have to stop it.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|The tides seem to be calming. Perhaps our friend has made some progress.}}
:{{text|say|Okri Putterwrench|Well I sure hope so, because there's something else coming this way!}}

On complete of all five a short cutscene:
:''The camera shifts, showing some fishermen in their boats. Waves appear in what's supposed to be a tranquil harbor. Suddenly, [[Viq'Goth]], a giant kraken appears!''
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|OUTRIGGERS! OPEN FIRE!}}
