* Ferry Dock visited
* Tradewinds Counting House visited
* Snug Harbor Inn visited
* Flight Master visited

==Description==
I think a proper introduction is in order!

My name is [[Taelia]], member of the [[Proudmoore Guard]] and squire of [[Cyrus Crestfall|Sir Cyrus Crestfall]].

<Taelia salutes firmly.>

Cyrus asked me and [[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]] to break you out of that [[Tol Dagor|Ashvane prison]] and get you settled in here at the market, but he neglected to mention that you're with the Alliance.

I must say, it's an honor.

Let's get you up to speed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I'll bring you to Cyrus after a brief tour of the market.

==Completion==
Ready to meet the Harbormaster himself?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Don't worry about the prison break. Here in the market, you're just another traveler. Now let's get you settled in!}}

Run forward and take a left to approach [[Will Melborne]], the Ferry Master:
:{{text|say|Taelia|This ferry connects to stations all along the sound's interior coast.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|You'll need a ferry pass from the harbormaster. That won't be a problem.}}

Head up two flights of stairs to reach the [[Tradewinds Counting House]]:
:{{text|say|Taelia|The counting house is under heavy guard day and night. Feel free to store your valuables here.}}

Head up another flight of stairs and enter the [[Snug Harbor Inn]], stopping by [[Wesley Rockhold]], the innkeeper.
:{{text|say|Taelia|The market hosts travelers from all over Azeroth. There are many taverns, but this one's my favorite.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|I spend a lot of time in here, pestering travelers to tell me their stories. Especially folks from the Eastern Kingdoms!}}

Further west on the upper level is [[Joan Weber]], the flight master. As is [[Galeheart]], Taelia's gryphon:
: ''She lovingly speaks to the gryphon.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Ah, there's my girl. You must be restless, being cooped up here all day.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Believe me, I know the feeling. We'll fly soon, all right?}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Beautiful, isn't she? Cyrus gave her to me when she was just a hatchling.}}

Important spots in Boralus Harbor located, turn directly in to Taelia.

;Description
Than you for helping Flynn. I've been bailing him out of trouble since we were kids.

My name's Taelia. I'm with the Proudmoore Guard.

You must be wondering why I'd help you after Katherine turned away the Alliance.

Let's just say things here in Kul Tiras are a little more complicated than they appear. I'll get you up to speed soon enough.

For now, let me show you around the marketplace.
