==Objectives==
Gather 12 Hawk Eggs.
* [[Hawk Egg]] (12)

==Description==
Before [[Alanna Holton|Alanna]] sends us on our grand hunt, there is something more immediate demanding our attention...

I'm absolutely famished! No good man can hunt on an empty stomach.

There are [[hawk]]s in the area, which means that there are also hawk eggs. I'm not sure how well they'll do in an omelet, but I'm always one for a culinary adventure!

Good <class>, could you bring back a few before we get started?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Have you found enough eggs yet? You know what those small goblins say, time is money!

==Completion==
Fantastic! Here's hoping that hawk eggs aren't too gamey...

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Pardon Our Rust]], [[A Grizzly End]], [[A Sweater for Rupert]] and [[WANTED: Ol' Frostclaw]] before heading out.

Then go nuts! There are [[Monstrous Grizzly|Monstrous Grizzlies]] to be skinned (make sure to actually ''use'' the [[Simple Skinning Knife]]!), [[Guarded Quillrat]]s to be looted for their quills, [[Sprung Beartrap]]s to be armed, [[Mountain Raccoon]]s to be killed for their tails, [[Hawk Nest]]s to steal eggs from (and [[Tiragarde Skyhunter]]s to aggro if they're close), and an [[Old Frostclaw|old elite bear]] to be taken out.

On complete of [[Pardon Our Rust]], [[A Grizzly End]] and [[A Hunt for Hawk Eggs]]:
