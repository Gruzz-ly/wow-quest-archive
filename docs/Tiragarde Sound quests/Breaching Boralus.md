==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[High Warlord Cromush]]|Tiragarde Sound is the most heavily fortified Alliance stronghold on the continent. We cannot hesitate or lose focus. Strike quickly, <name>.}}

[[Greystone Ruins]] is one of the main areas of attack. [[Quizla Blastcaps]] and [[Uraka Wildthunder]] are preparing an [[Azerite Iron Star]].
:{{Text|say|Quizla Blastcaps|You're packing the Azerite into that compartment too tightly, Uraka. You're gonna lose a hand.}}
:{{Text|say|Uraka Wildthunder|Shut up, Quizla. I know what I'm doing.}}
:{{Text|say|Uraka Wildthunder|And take that stupid mask off. You're not Laughing Skull.}}
:{{Text|say|Quizla Blastcaps|Tell that to Kil'rip. Ha ha ha!}}
:{{Text|say|Quizla Blastcaps|Oh well, I never liked your hands anyways.}}

Scour eastern Tiragarde Sound and complete 4 Faction Assault world quests.

;Four world quests completed
:{{Text|say|High Warlord Cromush|Our forces cannot breach the walls of Boralus! Regroup with our engineers and find a way to break through the Alliance defenses!}}

Return to Greystone Ruins and mount the Azerite Iron Star.
:{{Text|say|Uraka Wildthunder|I removed the brakes to accommodate a bigger Azerite payload. Hope you don't mind!}}
:{{Text|yell|Quizla Blastcaps|Ha ha ha ha! Burn 'em up, <name>! For the Horde!}}

Navigate the star through the Alliance soldiers through the ruins.

*{{Text|say|[[7th Legion Stalwart]]|Don't let it reach Boralus!}}
*{{Text|say|[[7th Legion Arcanist]]|What is that monstrosity?!}}
*{{Text|say|[[7th Legion Cavalry]]|We need reinforcements!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Arcanist|That was my good leg!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Stalwart|My skin is on fire!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Stalwart|Retreat!}}

;Enemy forces crushed
:{{Text|say|Usha Eyegouge|Hah! I need to get one of these things for myself! Now head for the main gates to Boralus and blast them to pieces!}}

Continue down the road toward Boralus and destroy [[Barricade (Faction Assaults)|Barricades]]. Then ram the iron star into the gate.
:{{Text|yell|Boralus Guard|The southern gate has been breached!}}
:{{Text|yell|Captain Briggs|Face me, cowards! Boralus stands strong!}}

Attack him:
:{{Text|say|Captain Briggs|Guards, to me! We will drive this Horde filth out of our city!}}

On death:
:{{Text|say|Captain Briggs|Beware... the daughter of... the sea...}}
:{{Text|say|Usha Eyegouge|So much for the city walls! Ha ha! Our warriors will have no problem pushing into Boralus now! Lok-tar!}}

Additional conversation between Quizla and Uraka:
:{{Text|yell|Quizla Blastcaps|Whoo! Your iron star made my post shake all the way from the front gates, Uraka!}}
:{{Text|emote|Uraka smiles.}}
:{{Text|say|Uraka Wildthunder|I knew you'd appreciate my genius eventually.}}
:{{Text|say|Quizla Blastcaps|We gotta make more of them. Hundreds of them... Millions of them... Bomb-billions of them!}}
:{{Text|say|Uraka Wildthunder|Heh. You bring the Azerite, and I'll bring the boom, lil' one.}}
:{{Text|say|Quizla Blastcaps|Deal! That's a binding contract!}}
