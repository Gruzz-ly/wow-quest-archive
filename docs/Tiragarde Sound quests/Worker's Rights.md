==Objectives==
Talk to [[Maynard Algerson]] at [[Algerson Lumber Yard]].

==Description==
Hey, you! You lookin' for work?

I ain't got a job for ya, but I can tell ya to stay away from Algerson Lumber!

Algerson'll promise ya some solid labor work and decent pay, but it's a lie I tell ya!

The conditions are terrible, we're gettin' attacked, and Algerson ain't even battin' an eye!

He don't care 'bout us little people. I'd stay away if I were you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Why hello! Welcome to Algerson Lumber. How may I help you?

==Notes==
Head just over to the [[Algerson Lumber Yard]], which has been besieged by the wicker.

Find Maynard Algerson inside his office:
:{{text|say|[[Algerson Lumberjack]]|Boss, the trees have come for their revenge! They're attacking us left and right!}}
:{{text|say|Maynard Algerson|I'm sick of these excuses. Trees don't come to life! Get back to work!}}
