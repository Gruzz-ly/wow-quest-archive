I'm most interested in those [[explosive]]s, though.

Meet me in the foundry, east of here. You probably passed through it on your way from [[Plunder Harbor]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Lilian gestures toward a pile of crates nearby.>

Think those are filled with the explosives?
