==Objectives==
Deliver the forged orders to Boatswain Taryn, Quartermaster Killian, and Navigator Swink.
* [[Boatswain Taryn]] ordered
* [[Quartermaster Killian]] ordered
* [[Navigator Swink]] ordered

==Description==
Whispers of dissent have been spreading through the harbor, <name>.

You can hear the grumblings of [[pirate]]s who do not want to give up their freedom!

Rumor holds that some of the other authority figures have goals that align with mine.

I forged some letters in the [[Captain Rhenik|captain]]'s hand. Deliver them... see who bites.

Or who gets in our way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Mutiny is about subversion. We must fly under the radar as long as we can!

==Completion==
I hoped that Taryn would see the truth. Ah, well. So it goes.

==Notes==
;Swink
:Where did you come from? Clearly you are not from around here.

:{{Gossip|Orders from the captain, sir. He has decided against siding with the [[House Ashvane|Ashvanes]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Navigator Swink|And I am to believe you, <race>? Hand it over.}}
:{{Text|say|Navigator Swink|We shall not hand ourselves over to the Ashvane...}}
:{{Text|say|Navigator Swink|Instead we shall... open our port to the [[Horde]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Navigator Swink|I may be with the Fogsail now, but to assume I would insult my [[Alliance]] roots by siding with the Horde... how dare you!}}

;Swink's death
:{{Text|say|Navigator Swink|Glory... to the Alliance...}}

;Taryn
:Who are you? And what exactly do you want?

:{{Gossip|Got some new orders from the captain for you, boatswain.}}
:{{Text|say|Boatswain Taryn|What? Let me see that.}}
:{{Text|say|Boatswain Taryn|I could recognize Owings's handwriting anywhere. I'll kill you, and then that traitor!}}

;Taryn's death
:{{Text|say|Boatswain Taryn|Captain! We've got a mutiny on our hands...}}

;Killian
:Mighty fine clothing you've got there, friend. Need something?

:{{Gossip|We're saying no to the Ashvane. Here are orders from the captain.}}
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Killian|Hmm... I don't believe that the captain would decide against siding with the Ashvane. He seems fairly set.}}
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Killian|Does this mean... I see.}}
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Killian|I'll go talk to Owings. I like my job, and I want to keep doing it. On my own terms.}}
