==Objectives==
Evacuate 8 Anglepoint Fishpackers.
* [[Anglepoint Fishpacker]] evacuated (8)

==Description==
The people of [[Anglepoint Wharf|Anglepoint]] need me to stand tall, to not panic in the face of the unknown.

I will admit to not being the best at this.

Even now, the fishpackers are handling the tainted product and preparing it for shipment. They are in great danger, and we cannot allow them to stay in harm's way.

We must get them to safety!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
We've already witnessed one innocent death today. We cannot allow more!

==Completion==
If there is even a chance of harm to innocents, we must protect them at all cost.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Tainted Shipments]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|I will move to scout further in town. Pray that the people there are safe!}}

While on this quest, players have access to the extra action button:
*{{Abilities|Evacuate!|Warns Anglepoint Fishpackers in a 10 yd radius, causing them to evacuate to safety.|range=10|notes=1.2 sec cast|id=261807|icon=ability_warrior_battleshout}}

As fishpackers flee:
*{{text|say|Anglepoint Fishpacker|It's time for my break anyway. I'm outta here.}}
*{{text|say|Anglepoint Fishpacker|How can management let this happen? That's it, we need to unionize.}}
*{{text|say|Anglepoint Fishpacker|Worms that eat faces? I'm getting out of here!}}
*{{text|say|Anglepoint Fishpacker|I'm used to monster parts in the shipments, but living monsters? Count me out.}}

[[Brother Therold]] has made it to [[Keegan Alby]]'s position further west. Approach them:
:{{text|say|Brother Therald|Alby? What's going on? Where is Lord Stormsong?}}
:{{text|say|Keegan Alby|You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Therold. It's a disaster.}}
