==Objectives==
Slay Fernn the Turncoat.
* [[Fernn the Turncoat]] slain {{co|80.1|38.9|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
{{Questportrait|Fernn the Turncoat.jpg|Fernn|He has always shown discontent with House Proudmoore and his position here.}}
The instigator of this mutiny is a man named Fernn. He has always shown discontent with [[House Proudmoore]] and his position here. But to betray the men he works with? That seems beyond even my expectations of him.

Take him out, and show this mutiny the mistake of crossing truly loyal marines.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Lieutenant Fernn's Ring
|Southport Searchlight
|Proudmoore Marine's Crest
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Has the task been finished?

==Completion==
Good work. That should be enough help to get my men back in that fort and manning it again.

==Notes==
Pick up Targeting a Turncoat, [[A Lesson on Trust]], [[A Boralus Triple Threat]], and [[Free Bird]] before heading out.

Fernn's at the highest level of the keep.
