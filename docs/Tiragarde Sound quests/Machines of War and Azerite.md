==Objectives==
Recover 4 Azerite bombs and 3 Azerite rifles.
* [[Azerite Bomb Cluster]] (4)
* [[Azerite Rifle]] (3)

==Description==
The [[Norwington Estate]]... I remember taking walks here with my wife and children.

Sorry, this isn't the time for remembering an old life.

The Alliance have [[:Azerite]] [[bomb]]s and [[rifle]]s scattered throughout the estate. I believe our goal is to recover them.

If only the Alliance hadn't chosen to use the estate as a testing ground... this was meant to be a place of peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
I wish the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]] did not try to bring the Norwington Estate into this madness... but here we are.

==Progression==
{{The Day is Won}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.0|note=Added.}}
