My dear friend <name>, I do hope you enjoy the festival. I throw it every year to bring [[rider]]s from all over [[Kul Tiras]] together for a grand celebration of the sport!

In fact, you deserve the whole nine yards. Please, tour the estate at your leisure and partake in the delicious food and drink, introduce yourself to the people. I insist!

==Progress==
Have you taken your tour yet? Take a break from adventuring and relax!

==Completion==
How are you enjoying the grounds? We are still setting up, so it will be even more marvelous soon!

To tell you the truth, I have to one-up myself every year. It's quite exhausting organizing it all, but it's so very rewarding!

==Notes==
Stables, [[Dolan Northfield]]:
:This is where we take care of all our horses. Both the riders and the stablehands keep them groomed and well cared for!

Nearby, [[Majo]] and [[Joma]] offer some side quests: [[Safety First]], [[Lucky Charm (quest)]], and [[Monstrous Energy]].

Catering, [[Arthur Seville]]:
:Ah, our esteemed hero! Welcome, welcome. Help yourself to some food and drink. If you need anything else, let me know and I will gladly assist.

Inn, [[Terry Rigglesmith]]:
:It is my honor to serve Lord and Lady Norwington as their housekeeper. If you would like to acquire a room for rest, do not hesitate to ask.

Smithy, [[George Mitchell]]:
:An estate such as this one requires a lot of upkeep. Between making horseshoes, repairing rakes, and doing the occasional odd job here and there, a blacksmith's work is never done!
