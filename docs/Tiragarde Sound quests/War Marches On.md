==Objectives==
Return to [[Halford Wyrmbane]] on the [[Wind's Redemption]].

==Description==
I hope the [[Horde]] will think twice about attacking [[Kul Tiras]] in the future, but given the actions of its leadership, it is a faint hope at best. Still, what matters most is my people are safe now.

The [[Kul Tiran fleet|fleet]] and [[marine]]s should be here soon to help the [[Outriggers]] clear out what remains of the Horde forces. Please return to High Commander Wyrmbane and let him know I will join everyone as soon as I am able.

Thank you for your swift actions today, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 4,450 [[XP]]
* +2,000 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*[[Tiragarde Emblem]]

==Completion==
A successful operation, indeed. I'm glad we have [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina]] back among the members of the [[Alliance]]. We've done our best together but the added power of the Kul Tiran fleet, and their new Lord Admiral, may be just what we need to push this campaign forward.

==Criteria of==
*[[Tides of Vengeance (achievement)]]

== Notes ==
While not obvious, [[Plumeria]] becomes a quest flightpath that takes you directly back to [[Tradewinds Market]].
