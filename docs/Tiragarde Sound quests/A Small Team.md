==Notes==
;Entering the [[Safe House]]
:{{Text|say|Sapphronetta Flivvers|Kablamo! The tea is ready.}}
:{{Text|say|Sapphronetta Flivvers|This batch is stronger than the last!}}
Sapphronetta is surrouned by [[Tea Mug]]s, [[Crate of Azerite (Boralus)|Crate of Azerite]], [[Azerite Bag]], and [[Pouch of Azerite (Boralus)|Pouch of Azerite]].

;Speaking with Sapphronetta
:I've just discovered the two-hundred and forty third most useful thing to do with Azerite.

:Grab a cup of tea and test it out!

:{{Gossip|We need you for Mechagon.}}
::Ooh, Mechagon, I heard it had been discovered!

::All the new technology! The possibilities make my toes wiggle!

::You bet I'll go! There's just one problem...

::{{Gossip|What problem?}}
:::If you want me to come with you, you gotta invite my partner in life, love, and the lab...Grizzek Fizzwrench.

:::Scoot upstairs and tell him the good news!

:{{Gossip|Tea?}}
::I modified my Lightning Blast 3000 to a lower frequency allowing it to fuse tea leaves with Azerite particles.

::The taste of the tea, pairs perfectly with the energetic and lively nature of the Azerite ore. The results are most exciting... and surprisingly smooth!

::{{Gossip|That sounds interesting.}}

Grizzek is upstairs with a [[Clockwork Rocket Bot]].

;Speaking with Grizzek
:I bet you was expecting someone taller, less green, maybe a gnome?

:{{Gossip|Your partner in life, love, and the lab says I should invite you to come to Mechagon.}}

:''Grizzek walks to Saffy.''
:{{Text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|Alright, Punkin, let's go find this King Mechagon!}}
:{{Text|say|Sapphronetta Flivvers|<Name>, we'll start packing and meet you later at the departure point.}}
:{{Text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|I'll get my fuses, the spare rocket packs and the Azerite.}}
:{{Text|say|Sapphronetta Flivvers|We'll need a disguise for you, Grizzek. We don't want to attract too much attention.}}
:{{Text|say|Sapphronetta Flivvers|We'll need the auto-hammer, the electromagnet, the micro-anvil, and the tea press.}}
:{{Text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|Let's bring that entire crate of pirate scout cookies we bought!}}
:{{Text|say|Sapphronetta Flivvers|I'm bringing the full set of sixty-two hydrospanners.}}
:''Grizzek heads back upstairs.''
:{{Text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|Where's my socks?}}

;Approaching the Cog Captain
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|This <race> may know what's going on.}}
:''A [[Gyrocopter Engineer]] is hammering into a [[Gnome Toolbox]]. Next to her is a [[Box of Scrolls]]. There are also an [[Expedition Transport]] and an [[Expedition Scout (Boralus)|Expedition Scout]] on a flying machine.''

;Speaking with the Cog Captain
:The Tinkmaster sent word that you needed skilled pilots, so my crew and I came as fast as we could.

:{{Gossip|We need you for Mechagon.}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|See you at the departure point!}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|Everyone pack up, we're headed to Mechagon!}}
:''Winklespring walks to a flying machine, hops on it, and flies away.''

:{{Gossip|Have we met before?}}
::I don't know, you spend any time in [[Gnomeregan]]?

;Reach the departure point
: ''Overspark has just met Grizzek, who is wearing a complete skin-covering outfit with a [[Hallow's End]] witch's hat, handkerchief mask, and sunglasses, along with a [[Gnomeregan Tabard]].''
:{{text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|I must say, Grizzek, your outfit is quite peculiar.}}
:{{text|say|Sapphronetta Flivvers|It's for the... uh... radiation poisoning! Right, sweetie?}}
:{{text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|Right! The radiation. From Gnomeregan. Where I am definitely from.}}
