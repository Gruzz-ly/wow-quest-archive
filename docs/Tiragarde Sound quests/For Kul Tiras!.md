==Objectives==
Use the Proudmoore Battle Standard to inspire 15 [[Vigil Hill Marine]]s or [[Vigil Hill Militia|Militia]].
*[[Proudmoore Battle Standard]] (provided)

==Description==
Listen, I'll be frank with you; we're not at full strength here. Many of our [[soldier]]s recently left for [[Boralus]] on new orders.

It's like they knew just when to hit us...

But we're going to hit back! Every able-bodied man and woman in town has stepped up to mount a defense.

Take this battle standard and remind them what they're fighting for!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Standard Bearer's Band
|Navigator's Shoes
|Freebooter Walkers
|Outrigger Walkers
|Sea Raider's Stompers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
They say a warrior fights twice as hard when he thinks of home.

==Completion==
It fills my heart with pride to hear that battlecry ring out across the field.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cease Fire!]] and [[Righteous Retribution]] before heading out.

In Daelin's Gate, a bonus objective appears, [[Enemies at the Gate (bonus objective)]].

Back at Vigil Hill, Flynn has recovered and offers [[Freehold: A Pirate's End]].

This concludes the "Defenders of Daelin's Gate" chapter of the [[Tiragarde Sound storyline]]. The quest chain continues with [[Bearers of Bad News]].
