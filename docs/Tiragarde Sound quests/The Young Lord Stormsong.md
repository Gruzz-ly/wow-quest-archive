==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Brother Conway.png|Brother Conway|Once a respected administrator, it seems Conway grew tired of Brannon's "leadership".}}
Kill Brother Conway, then rescue [[Lord Brannon Stormsong]] from [[Anglepoint Packing District]].
* [[Brother Conway]] slain

==Description==
When the town fell, I got separated from my charge.

Lord Stormsong is being held hostage in his own house. I should've been there to protect him.

When you go in there, succeed where I failed. Bring him back safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I have failed in my duty as a guard.

==Completion==
<Alby clears his throat.>

It is good to see the young lord safe.

...Thanks.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Possessive Headgear]] and [[Betrayal of the Guard]] before heading out.

Use the ships to cross over to the [[Anglepoint Packing District]], killing [[Mind-addled Enforcer]]s and attacking [[Possessed Dockworker]]s to release them from the [[Parasitic Mindstealer]]s.

In one of the buildings, look for [[Manager Yerold]]. He offers some side quests: [[Dangerous Cargo]] and [[Enemy Within]].

Brother Conway and Brannon Stormsong are at the southeast end of the packing district.
