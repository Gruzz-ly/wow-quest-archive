==Objectives==
Locate Civil Technician Alena and Ordnance Handler Prim.
* [[Civil Technician Alena]] located {{co|77.0|57.8|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Ordnance Handler Prim]] located {{co|77.3|60.4|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
[[Winterdeep Mining Camp|The mine]] is in real trouble. We've been excavating for a short while, but never seen anything like this. [[:Azerite]] doesn't just get up and walk around.

If we are going to take the mine back, we're going to need more help. We'll need an engineer and an explosives expert. I have two in mind, sisters actually, but they are caught behind the river in all the chaos.

Locate the sisters and they'll help you with the next phase of the plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
Good. We're all here.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Pinch of Azerite]] before heading out.

Alena:
:Can't you see I'm a little busy? This place is in shambles. I don't have the workforce nor the materials to get this under control.
{{gossip|Theock wants to retake the mine.}}
:{{text|say|Civil Technician Alena|Take the mine back? We're going to need help. Find my sister and meet me outside the mine!}}

Prim:
:Grab a crate, we got to get this stuff out of here while we still have a chance.
{{gossip|Theock wants to retake the mine.}}
:{{text|say|Ordnance Handler Prim|We're retaking the mine boys! Grab all the dynamite you can carry and lets head out! Meet us at the store house outside the mine. We'll talk more there!}}

Find both of them in the small building just outside the mine. Prim, for whatever reason, is holding a lit stick of dynamite!
:Some people say handling explosives is dangerous work. I'd say they are bang on.
{{gossip|Are you holding a lit stick of dynamite?}}
:Oh, don't worry. It's a special slow fuse I designed. It only goes off when I'm bored with a conversation.
:So... Boom.

Ouch.
