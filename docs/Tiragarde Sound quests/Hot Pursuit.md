==Objectives==
Mount a Proudmoore Charger and chase Priscilla Ashvane.
* Proudmoore Charger mounted {{co|47.8|81.4|Boralus}}
* Priscilla Ashvane pursued

==Description==
Priscilla's escaping on horseback! Grab one of our chargers and chase her down!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Find a charger and get after Priscilla! I'll join you as soon as Katherine is secure.

==Completion==
I don't know how anyone could survive a fall like that.

Still, we should be careful not to let our guard down.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Priscilla's escaping on horseback! Grab one of our chargers and chase her down!}}

Hop on the [[Proudmoore Charger]]:
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Your little stunt meant nothing. I OWN this city!}}

Follow Priscilla as she escapes through the city. The horse has two abilities:
#{{Abilities|Jump|Command your Proudmoore Charger to jump over an obstacle|notes=Instant|cd=2 sec|icon=ability_heroicleap|id=267059}}
#{{Abilities|Giddyup!|Give your Proudmoore Charger a burst of speed.|notes=Instant|cd=6 sec|icon=spell_nature_swiftness|id=267404}}

Priscilla will knock over several obstacles while she's escaping, so use the '''Jump''' ability when prompted to save some time. Players cannot fail the quest by not jumping, but merely slow down:

:{{text|bossemote|Jump!}} (over a hay wagon)
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Take this!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jump!}} (over building debris)
:{{text|bossemote|Jump!}} (over spray from a beer keg)
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Out of the way, chum-for-brains!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Cabbage Vendor]]|Fresh cabbages!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jump!}} (over the cabbage vendor's cart)

Should players not manage to clear the cabbage cart:
:{{text|yell|Cabbage Vendor|My cabbages!!}}

Eventually Priscilla heads up to the bridge from [[Proudmoore Keep]] over to the [[Proudmoore Barracks]], but Taelia and some guards have cut her off:
:{{text|say|Taelia|There's nowhere left to run.}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Insolent BRAT. This is far from over!}}
:''Priscilla leaps off the bridge with her mount down to the harbor below.''
:{{text|yell|Taelia|Wait, no!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|You three, get a search party down there and find her!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Hero, let's return to Katherine.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|You there! A word, if I may.}}

==Progression==
{{Enemies Within}}

== Trivia ==
This quest is a reference to ''{{wp|Avatar: The Last Airbender}}'', when the cabbage vendor constantly has his cabbage cart destroyed throughout the show while also exclaiming the same line as the NPC in the quest.

==Patch changes==
