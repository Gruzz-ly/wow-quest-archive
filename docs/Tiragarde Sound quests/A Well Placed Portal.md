Use the Portal to [[Boralus]] and meet with [[Thomas Zelling]] in [[Stormsong Monastery]].
* [[Portal to Boralus]] taken

==Description==
We have the front here under control. I am sending you and Zelling into Boralus to acquire the [[:Abyssal Scepter]].

[[Oculeth]] has managed to pinpoint a safe location for a portal. Get moving.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

==Progress==
Never did I think I would be undercover here. Or, truly, anywhere.

==Completion==
I once studied here. And now...

<Zelling clears his throat.>

We have a job to do.
