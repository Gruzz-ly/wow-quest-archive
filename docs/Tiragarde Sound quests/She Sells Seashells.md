==Objectives==
Gather shells for Jenny.
* [[Gleaming Spiral]] (4)
* [[Sparkling Tidescale]] (6)

==Description==
[[Jeorge Swiftbrook|Papa]] wanted to go fishing, and mum is working, so he brought me along.

But I'm bored! I'm trying to sell some of the shells I found washed up on the beach, but nobody seems to be stopping. I don't think my shells are pretty enough...

You don't seem like you're afraid of those big snakes on the beach. Can you bring me back some prettier shells? Only the shiniest please!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Come, let us parley... How was that? I'm trying to sound like a proper shell seller.

==Completion==
Oooh! These are so pretty! I bet they'll sell really well.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Jenny Swiftbrook|Seashells for sale! The prettiest in all of Kul Tiras! Wait, Azeroth! The prettiest in all of Azeroth!}}

Don't mind the [[Venomous Coilscale]]s just west along the [[Driftwood Shore]]. Plenty of [[Gleaming Spiral]]s to steal off the backs of [[Gleaming Seacrab]]s and [[Sparkling Tidescale]]s just lying on the sand.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Jenny Swiftbrook|These are so sparkly! I'll say this big one is blessed by the tidesages and this spiraly one is from a pirate's treasure chest!}}
