==Objectives==
Free 6 [[Urchin Worker]]s from the [[Ashvane Foundry]].
* [[Urchin Worker]] freed (6)

==Description==
<sniff>

They said they would feed us. Said they'd keep us warm.

<Olive runs the sleeve of her coat across her nose.>

But they were mean! And it was really hard work. And when we tried to rest, they yelled at us!

<sniff>

I got away, but my friends are still in there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
These kids are gonna have it hard enough without being under [[Priscilla Ashvane|Ashvane's]] thumb. Thanks for getting them out.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Suspicious Shipments]] and [[Labor Dispute (quest)]] before heading out.

On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Send those kids to the western edge of the foundry. I'll wait there and make sure nobody tries to snatch 'em.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Meet me there when you've got some information on those shipments.}}

After crossing the bridge to enter the [[Ashvane Foundry]], look out for a [[Posted Notice]] tacked to a wall that starts [[Message from the Management]].

Look for [[Urchin Worker]]s all over the foundry and interact with them to free them:
*Please don't yell at me!
*I saw bad men. They were yelling at everyone - even other grown-ups!
*<cough> <cough>
:I wanna go home.

:{{gossip|Head down to the water. There is a boat waiting to take you to safety.}}
*{{text|say|Please help the grown-ups, too!}}
*{{text|say|I'm goin' back to school...}}
*{{text|say|Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|I hope they have food on the boat!}}
*{{text|say|I'm off!}}
*{{text|say|I'm out of here!}}
*{{text|say|Now to find a warm fire!}}
*{{text|say|They won't catch me! I'm too fast!}}

Additionally, there are other suspicious objects like [[Azerite-Dusted Blade]]s all over the foundry that can be used (via the extra action button) to do some extra damage to enemies.

Finally, there's a Small Treasure Chest near [[Forgemaster Farthing]]. It contains a poor-quality item and some [[War Resources]].
