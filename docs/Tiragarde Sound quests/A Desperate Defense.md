==Objectives==
Report to [[Lieutenant Tarenfold]].

==Description==
The [[soldier]]s garrisoned here are doing their best to hold out, but they're struggling. [[Pirate]]s haven't dared attack this gate in years, and never with such a large force.

If you're handy in a fight, Lieutenant Tarenfold will want to meet you. 

He's organizing the militia up ahead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Aha! Reinforcements!

Wait... Where are the rest of you?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Vigil Hill Refugee|Daelin's Gate has fallen. How could this happen?}}
:{{text|say|Vigil Hill Refugee|We built that gate with the finest steel from the Waycrest mines... And it just came apart like paper...}}

Head up to [[Vigil Hill]], under siege from all directions. Don't forget the flight path!

==Progression==
{{Defenders of Daelin's Gate}}
