==Description==
This vault screams of ancient [[Gnome|gnomish]] [[Technology|tech]]! I believe this could be the key that leads us to [[King Mechagon]]!

I can't risk putting myself in danger though, so you will lead the way into the vault. 

Well, what are we waiting for? Let's see what's inside!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is such a great moment in gnomish history. Your help here will be noted in the historical journals.
