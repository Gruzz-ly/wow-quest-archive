==Notes==
Enter the courtyard and a cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|The rumors are true. [[Daelin's Gate]]... has fallen.}}
:''The crowd reacts in horror and anger.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|A pirate fleet struck the gate with overwhelming force...}}
:{{text|say|Concerned Citizen|Pirates?! The Proudmoores can't even protect us from pirates anymore!}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|For shame!}}
:''Priscilla silences the crowd.''
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Katherine Proudmoore has spent her life doing what's best for Kul Tiras!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|But it has not been enough.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|My dear friend Priscilla and I have discussed this. I believe that what is best for Kul Tiras is that I step down as Lord Admiral...}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|I will shoulder this heavy burden. I can only hope I will be a worthy successor.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Lady Ashvane has been my rock since those first dark days when we both lost our husbands. Now she will be the kingdom's rock. Now... she is--}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|A liar!}}
:''Taelia and the adventurer walk up to the front.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|So, this was your play all along. Despicable.}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Asvhane|What is the meaning of this, girl?!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Lady Priscilla Ashvane, you are under arrest for trafficking, conspiring with pirates, and high treason against the Admiralty of Kul Tiras.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|And we have evidence!}}
:''Taelia tosses down a sack full of [[:Azerite]].''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Your company MADE the weapons that destroyed Daelin's Gate using this!}}
:''Katherine approaches the sack and kneeling, takes a long look.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|It's called Azerite... and the Alliance and Horde are already at war over it.}}
:''Priscilla looks around nervously.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|You hired the pirate fleet, armed them to the teeth, and set them upon your own countrymen.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|And I almost... Priscilla... How could you betray the kingdom? How could you betray me?}}
: ''Her true character exposed, Priscilla abandons all pretense and cruelly snarls her response.''
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|You're too weak to rule, Katherine.}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|Your family has always been too weak.}}
:{{text|say|Priscilla Ashvane|The Proudmoore legacy of failure dies with you!}}
:''Priscilla pulls out her gun and fires at the bag of Azerite, which explodes violently.''
