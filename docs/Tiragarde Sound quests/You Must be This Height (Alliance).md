;Talking to Overspark
The secrets of [[Mechagon]] are about to be revealed to us.

{{Gossip|I'm ready. Activate the device.}}

:''Tinkmaster Overspark approaches the controls and activates the device. A large image of [[King Mechagon]] appears.''
:{{Text|Yell|King Mechagon|Brothers and sisters of gnomanity! For generations, the curse of flesh has condemned us to obsolescence.}}
:{{Text|Yell|King Mechagon|But no more! At long last, the perfection of our original titan-forged design will be restored!}}
:''Tinkmaster Overspark returns to his original spot and begins to cheer.''
:{{Text|Yell|King Mechagon|All who are worthy shall join me in Mechagon and be cleansed of the Old Gods' corruption.}}
:{{Text|Yell|King Mechagon|Step forth, and be judged in the eyes of invention. Together, we will reclaim our true legacy!}}
:''The [[:Tri-dimensional Coordinates]] materialize on the surface of the device below King Mechagon.''

;Looting the Tri-dimensional Coordinates
:''A cutscene plays:''
:{{Text|Say|King Mechagon|Incompatible presence detected!}}
:{{Text|Say|King Mechagon|Unworthy subjects will be neutralized.}}
:{{Text|Say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Unworthy?! I hand-picked these tinkologists myself!}}
:{{Text|Say|Tinkmaster Overspark|They're the best and the brightest!}}
:''A beam of light focuses on one of the non-gnome [[Archaeo-Tinkologist|tinkologists]], then vaporizes them. The crewmembers scatter in a panic, some of them with more light beams hot on their tails.''
:{{Text|Say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Th-this can't be right! It's malfunctioning!}}
:''Tinkmaster Overspark begins hitting the controls with a wrench. Behind him, two tinkologists are targeted and killed.''
:''A beam appears above [[Gila Crosswires]], and she cowers in fear. As Overspark hammers away at the controls, an electrical explosion bursts from them, causing the beam to turn yellow. It and the image of King Mechagon fade away.''
:{{Text|Say|Gila Crosswires|Amazing! The expedition has been saved by the Tinkmaster's technological expertise.}}
:{{Text|Say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Most perplexing... I couldn't find a failsafe protocol.}}
:''Overspark clears his throat and turns toward Gila and the [[adventurer]].''
:{{Text|Say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Thank you, Gila!}}
:{{Text|Say|Tinkmaster Overspark|And now, with the coordinates in hand, our next stop is Mechagon!}}

;After the cutscene
:''The bodies of dwarf, night elf, and human tinkologists lie on the floor throughout the vault. Only the gnomish members of the expedition survived.''
:{{Text|Say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Those poor souls! This device must have malfunctioned. King Mechagon would never mean us harm!}}
