==Objectives==
Tell Gazlowe to activate the device.
* Speak with [[Gazlowe]]
* Purpose of device discovered
* [[Tri-dimensional Coordinates]]

==Description==
You and the [[Gazlowe's Greasemonkeys|Greasemonkeys]] got this machine up and running even faster than I expected.

The [[gnome]] we captured is keeping her mouth shut, but that shouldn't be a problem. I can take it from here.

Let me know when you're ready. I'll crank up this machine to max and we'll finally see what it can do.

I hope it prints [[gold]] coins...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That's the best use of a gnome I've ever seen!

==Completion==
Phew. Close call there, but the risk is gonna pay out big.

Did you see the sweet [[Technology|tech]] [[King Mechagon]] was wearing? We gotta get our hands on that!

==Notes==
;Speaking with Gazlowe
:You ready to see what all this fancy tech actually does?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready. Activate the device.}}

:{{Text|yell|[[Archaeo-Tinkologist]]|This [[gnomish technology]] is way out of your league, simpleton!}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Heh. I'm a lot of things, gnomie, but I ain't no "simpleton".}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|All right, let's crank this baby up and see what happens.}}
:{{Text|yell|[[King Mechagon]]|Brothers and sisters of gnomanity! For generations, the curse of flesh has condemned us to obsolescence.}}
:{{Text|yell|King Mechagon|But no more! At long last, the perfection of our original [[titan-forged]] design will be restored!}}
:{{Text|yell|King Mechagon|All who are worthy shall join me in Mechagon and be cleansed of the [[Old God]]s' corruption.}}
:{{Text|yell|King Mechagon|Step forth, and be judged in the eyes of invention. Together, we will reclaim our true legacy!}}

;Upon looting the coordinates
:''A cut-scene plays.''
:{{Text|say|King Mechagon|Incompatible presence detected!}}
:{{Text|say|King Mechagon|Unworthy subjects will be neutralized.}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Uh oh. That can't be good.}}
:''A [[Greasemonkey Engineer|goblin]] is blasted by the rays of light.''
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|[[Skaggit]]! Get that thing under control!}}
:''Skaggit goes to the controller. Two more goblins are blasted by the rays of light.''
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Hang on, I've got an idea!}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Gimme that gnome!}}
:''Gazlowe grabs the gnome held by [[Jack the Hammer]] and holds her up to the image of King Mechagon.''
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Hey, Brighteyes! Over here!}}
:''Rays of light envelope Gazlowe and the gnome but are not evaporated.''
:{{Text|say|Skaggit|Phew! Looks like you handled that situation, boss!}}
:''Jack the Hammer grabs the gnome.''
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Good thing we kept one around. Now we've got a lead on the next location!}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Hah! This has gotta pay off!}}
