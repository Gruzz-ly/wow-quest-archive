==Objectives==
Kill 10 wendigo.
* [[Wendigo]] slain  (10)

==Description==
It's a mystery where these boys were taken, but it ain't much of a mystery who did it. Roughnecks believe an eye for an eye and then some.

Let's put down some of those monstrosities.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
You'll need to kill a whole heap of them to make this right.

==Completion==
This'll help protect my boys down the hill. Well done.

==Notes==
Boss Tak follows the player for the duration of the quest.

Pick up [[Where'd They Go?]] before heading out.

Kill [[Glacial Wendigo|Glacial]] and [[Savage Wendigo]]s.

Keep a look out for [["Helpless" Henry]] near the supply cart - entombed in a block of ice. He offers [[Frozen]].

==Progression==
{{Roughneck Camp}}
