==Objectives==
Kill Anthemusa.
* [[Anthemusa]] slain {{co|53.7|32.9|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
These [[siren|snake wenches]] show up and everyone loses their minds! All my men are head over heals for these things. Personally, I don't see it. I mean, I sort of get the appeal, but the wings for arms and snake tails are a big turn off.

There's a big one in a cave to the east. She's got a whole heap of suitors. I need them back to work. Go give her a wallop and get everyone back here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder?

==Completion==
I decided if you can't beat 'em, join 'em! That one over there looks available. Think she'll go out with me?

Oh, and thanks for getting everyone back at their posts. We got a lot of cleanup.

==Notes==
While in the area for [[Captured and Enraptured]], [[A Very Precious Cargo]], and the bonus objective [[Shipwreck Recovery Crew]], [[Earless Joe]] offers this quest.

The [[Amora Grotto]] is north of the main quest area. She has three [[Anthemusa's Thrall]]s with her, but they are not valid targets for the [[Stein of Grog]], so they will aggro normally.

Death:
