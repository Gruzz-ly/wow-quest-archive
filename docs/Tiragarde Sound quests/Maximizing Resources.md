==Objectives==
Collect 5 [[Wood-Adorned Skull]]s in [[Algerson Lumber Yard]].
* [[Wood-Adorned Skull]] (5)

==Description==
Let me tell you a thing about my employees.

They're always blowing things out of proportion! I give them a good job with a steady wage and what do they do? They try to make excuses as to why they can't work!

They say the trees have come alive. Trees? Walking and fighting? If you're going to lie, at least make it more believable.

If they want to convince me, I'm going to need cold hard proof.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I give them an honest job with good pay. This is the thanks I get?

==Completion==
<Algerson examines the skull.>

Now this... this is something! Why are my workers running, they should be harvesting!

We could make a killing with these!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Inventory Deficit]] before heading out. Just outside, find [[Benjamin Algerson]] rooted on the dock. He offers [[Time Off Requests]]. Pick it up too.

Defeat [[Timberbough Invader]]s and [[Timberfang Lurker]]s for their masks, "recover" axes from dead [[Stormsong Forester]]s, and free [[Entangled Lumberjack]]s.

Keep an eye out for the rare [[Lumbergrasp Sentinel]] in the area as well!

On return:
:{{text|say|Algerson Lumberjak|Now spiders are attacking in the woods! We can't chop trees when we're being killed, boss!}}
:{{text|say|Maynard Algerson|You're scared of spiders now? Just squish them under your foot!}}
