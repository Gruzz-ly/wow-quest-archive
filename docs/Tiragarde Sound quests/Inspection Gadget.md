==Objectives==
Survey the [[Rusted Vault]].
* Survey percentage (100)
* [[R.A.D.A.R.]] (provided)

==Description==
Some time ago, a good friend of mine who had a [[tinker]] shop in [[Boralus]] just stopped all correspondence. With the state of foreign affairs, I wasn't able to look for him myself until recently.

It's not just him. It seems that all of the [[gnome]]s that were living in the city just up and vanished.

I've decided to start my search with these ruins, but the machines here have gone haywire. Could you go get a good magnetic reading on the place?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
The machine should beep when it has all the information it needs.

==Completion==
This data is astounding! It will take quite a while to go through all of it.

==Notes==
While out and about for [[The Beauty of Marketing]], find [[Parin Tinklocket]] outside the [[Abandoned Junkheap]]. He offers this quest and [[Reverse Tinkering]]. Pick them both up before heading out.

Head south into the junkheap, start killing [[V-300 SENTRY]] bots and using the [[R.A.D.A.R.]] while walking around. Steer well clear of the [[Shock Turret]]s' area of effect radius. They sting!

At the south end of the quest area, keep an eye out for the rare [[P4-N73R4]] mechanical panther!

On completion of both:
