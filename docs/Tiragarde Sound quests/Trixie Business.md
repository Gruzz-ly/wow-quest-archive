==Objectives==
Slay First Mate Trixie Tornsail.
*[[First Mate Trixie Tornsail]] slain

==Description==
Usually this is the part where I hand you the scroll and send you on your way.

Sadly, friend, these are unusual times.

How's a man expected to run an honest business dealing in highly illegal goods when the [[Irontide Raiders]] are shaking down good folk like myself?

I'm prepared to offer you a handsome sum - and the scroll for our shelled associate - if you rid me of the damnable woman who collects these tributes.

You'll surely find her at [[Harlan Sweete|Harlan's]] table at the bar, getting drunk on MY gold!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Stay your hand, friend. If you harm me, you'll never find the scroll!

==Completion==
You actually did it? Color me impressed.

==Criteria of==
*[[The Long Con]]
