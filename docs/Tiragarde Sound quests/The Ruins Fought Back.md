==Objectives==
Kill 6 Ancient Protectors.
* [[Ancient Protector (Tiragarde Sound)|Ancient Protector]] slain (6)

==Description==
Something set off a trap in the cave, and then the ruins themselves came tae life. I expect that most of our lads still in that cave aren't in fightin' form.

Could ye clear out some of the livin' ruins tae help them escape?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Did ye clear out those constructs? The bloodthirsty things ain't helpin' anyone by bein' in there.

==Completion==
I've fought off spirits afore, but ne'er the actual ruins themselves.

==Notes==
At the [[Thovas Base-Camp]], pick up [[Chasing the Leader]] and [[The Ruins Fought Back]] and [[A Marine Out of Water]] before heading out.

Shortly after entering the cave of [[Gol Thovas]] proper, find some rather displeased members of the Explorers' League in the middle of an argument:
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|-to fix your mess!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|My mess? MY MESS? I believe YOU were the one to set it off, you insufferable pip-}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|Hyah!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|Ow! That was my shin!}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|You're lucky I can't kick any higher! Don't deny it! You set off the trap!}}

They offer [[I'm a Druid, Not a Priest]] and [[Salvaging a Disaster]].

On return:
:{{text|say|Hilde Firebreaker|And that's about all I could drag out by myself.}}
:{{text|say|Drogin Alewhisker|I'm just glad ye managed to drag yerself out.}}
:{{text|say|Hilde Firebreaker|What's explorin' without a little danger? Didn't even get a scratch.}}

==Progression==
{{Gol Thovas}}
