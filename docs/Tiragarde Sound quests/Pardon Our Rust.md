==Objectives==
Arm 5 Bear Traps.
* [[Sprung Beartrap]] armed (5)

==Description==
The traps we've set up in the field require routine maintenance checks. Some of them are fairly old and will spring at incorrect times. If only we could get more funding for these sort of supplies. 

<The huntmistress glances towards [[Lord Kennings]].>

While you're out hunting, could you reset any sprung ones that you find?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Be careful when resetting the traps, and if you get injured by faulty equipment, take it up with Kennings, not me.

==Completion==
It seems that you still have all of your limbs attached, and here I was hoping that I could talk Kennings into buying us new traps. Fair work.

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[A Grizzly End]], [[A Hunt for Hawk Eggs]], [[A Sweater for Rupert]] and [[WANTED: Ol' Frostclaw]] before heading out.

Then go nuts! There are [[Monstrous Grizzly|Monstrous Grizzlies]] to be skinned (make sure to actually ''use'' the [[Simple Skinning Knife]]!), [[Guarded Quillrat]]s to be looted for their quills, [[Sprung Beartrap]]s to be armed, [[Mountain Raccoon]]s to be killed for their tails, [[Hawk Nest]]s to steal eggs from (and [[Tiragarde Skyhunter]]s to aggro if they're close), and an [[Old Frostclaw|old elite bear]] to be taken out.

On complete of [[Pardon Our Rust]], [[A Grizzly End]] and [[A Hunt for Hawk Eggs]]:
