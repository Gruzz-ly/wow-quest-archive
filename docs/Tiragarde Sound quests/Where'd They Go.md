:{{text|say|Boss Tak|This poor soul's been dead for ages. Let's look east fer the supply cart.}}

Head east up the hill to find some [[Roughneck Supplies]] next to a cart:
:{{text|say|Boss Tak|Seems they got dragged thataway, up the glacier ta the northwest.}}

Poor [["Helpless" Henry]] has gotten himself frozen in an Ice Block. He offers [[Frozen]]:
:{{text|say|Boss Tak|This guy don't seem too bright.}}

On top of an outcrop overlooking the lake is the [[Roughneck Axe]]:
:{{text|say|Boss Tak|One o' our axes. We're on the right track.}}
