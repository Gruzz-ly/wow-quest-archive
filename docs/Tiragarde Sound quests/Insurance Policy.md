==Objectives==
Activate the roadside assistance button on the [[G.M.O.D]].
* Call for roadside assistance
* Try calling roadside assistance again
* Keep pushing buttons until something happens

==Description==
[[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]] called us idiots, can you believe that? Well, if I'm an idiot, then why did I buy an insurance policy on my mech, huh?

I bet that radioactive dimwit doesn't have an insurance policy on HIS mech!

We're gonna be outta here in no time. I just gotta give a quick call for roadside assistance to come out and fix this thing up.

I need you to go hit the button for roadside assistance on my mech.

Just, uh, don't hit the wrong one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You gonna call these guys up or what?

==Completion==
Maybe I shoulda bought an insurance policy for my insurance policy. 

Wait, what am I talkin' about? YOU'RE the insurance policy for the insurance policy!
