==Objectives==
Free 6 Enthralled Sailors in [[Fogcliff Strand]].
* [[Enthralled Sailor (Tiragarde Sound)|Enthralled Sailor]] freed (6)
* [[Stein of Grog]] (provided)

==Description==
You gotta help me! Me and my crew were running late on a delivery, so we decided to take a detour through this grotto ahead. Boy... that was a mistake. This place is crawling with [[siren]]s!

If there's one thing my men like more than women, it's grog! Here, take some. Use it to bring them back to their senses. Might be best to rough 'em up a bit to weaken the enchantment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Were you able to free my men? Without them, I'm stranded!

==Completion==
My men have been reporting back to me. Thanks for freeing them, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Very Precious Cargo]] before heading out. Also, there's a bonus objective in the area, [[Shipwreck Recovery Crew]].

Additionally, immediately to the west of the quest giver is a treasure chest and [[Squirgle of the Depths]], a rare [[deep sea murloc]]. Also, just west is [[Earless Joe]], who offers [[Can't Hear A Thing]].

==Progression==
{{Fogcliff Strand}}
