==Objectives==
Take [[Liam (child)|Liam]] to meet the Roughnecks at the [[Roughneck Camp]] in [[Tiragarde Sound]]. Make sure to call for him if he is not present when you get there.
* Visit the [[Roughnecks]]
* [[Kul Tiran Orphan Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
All [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]] are really tough, but the Roughnecks are the roughest and toughest of them all!

They can wrestle [[gryphon]]s with their bare hands! They can knock down a [[yeti]] with a single punch!

I wanna meet a Roughneck and prove that I can be really strong like them! Can you take me to their camp? I've heard it's up in the mountains by [[Anglepoint Wharf|Anglepoint]].

==Progress==
I'm gonna be big and strong and eat raw [[goat]] with my teeth!

==Completion==
Did you hear that?! He said I could be a Roughneck!

I'm gonna eat a lot of food so I can be big and strong like he is!

:{{text|say|Liam|Whoa! <name>, look at me!}}
:''Tagart walks back towards the campfire.''
:{{text|say|Tagart|Come back in a couple years, kid. If you train hard, I bet you'll have no problem with the trials.}}
