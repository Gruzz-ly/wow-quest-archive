==Objectives==
Kill 10 Mind-Addled Enforcers.
* [[Mind-addled Enforcer]] slain (10)

==Description==
My boys have gotten in too deep.

They've given in to whatever dark forces are at work here.

Do not hesitate to do what you need to and put them down. They knew what they were signing up for when they picked the wrong side.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I feel no pity for those who gave their humanity for power.

==Completion==
You did what needed to be done.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Possessive Headgear]] and [[The Young Lord Stormsong]] before heading out.

Use the ships to cross over to the [[Anglepoint Packing District]], killing [[Mind-addled Enforcer]]s and attacking [[Possessed Dockworker]]s to release them from the [[Parasitic Mindstealer]]s.

In one of the buildings, look for [[Manager Yerold]]. He offers some side quests: [[Dangerous Cargo]] and [[Enemy Within]].

==Progression==
{{The Shadow over Anglepoint}}
