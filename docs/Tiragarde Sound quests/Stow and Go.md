==Objectives==
Stow away on [[The Maiden's Virtue]].
* Speak with [[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]]
* The Maiden's Virtue boarded
* Hide in [[Barrel of Fish (Tiragarde Sound)|Barrel of Fish]]

==Description==
<Flynn lifts his collar to hide his face and speaks to you under his breath.>

You see that ship? I know that ship.

Let's just say her [[Captain Keelson|captain]] and I have a little history.

It's a smuggling vessel. Our illegal weapons are on there for sure. I'd bet my coat on it... and I love this coat.

We need to find out where it's going...

How are you in tight spaces?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]
*[[Green Boralus Market Tent]]

==Completion==
You alright, mate? I'm afraid your ship's gone.

Somethin' tells me you weren't really a part o' that crew anyway, were ya? Har har!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|You got any more business in town, now's the time to do it. Let me know when you're ready to board that ship and go wherever the wind takes us.}}

Speak with Flynn again when ready to leave:
:Ready to catch a ride on that ship and see where it's going?
:{{gossip|Let's go.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I'll follow your lead. Remember, the key to going anywhere you don't belong is to just walk in like you own the place.}}
:''A Bridgeport Guard walks past, stopping to inspect Flynn.''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Good mornin', sir.}}
:''Satisfied, the guard keeps walking.''

Board the ship:
:{{text|say|Captain Keelson|Timetable's changed, boys! Get your grogs to-go!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Quick, hide!}}
:''Flynn runs up to the quarterdeck and spots an empty barrel.''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ooh, I call the empty barrel! You can have the other one.}}

Interact with the [[Barrel of Fish (Tiragarde Sound)|Barrel of Fish]] to hop in, and an [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|T0KG3puo53Y|urlArgs=start=45&end=59}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Oh no... I think my barrel has pee in it...}}
:''Flynn gives it a taste.''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Nope, never mind. It's ale. We're good.}}
:''Keelson walks up to the poopdeck.''
:{{text|say|Captain Keelson|Clients want the stuff right now! We're shovin' off!}}
:''The ship sets off, heading southward.''

Another in-engine cutscene plays immediately after the loading screen:
{{#ev:youtube|T0KG3puo53Y|urlArgs=start=64&end=109}}
:''Finding themselves in a heavy fog, Keelson turns to the helmsman.''
:{{text|say|Captain Keelson|Steady as she goes, helmsman.}}
:''The helmsman salutes back to Keelson. Suddenly, a mysterious singing voice is heard...''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Wait, do you hear that?}}
:''The male members of the crew hear it too, and find themselves enthralled, walking toward the bow of the ship.''
:{{text|say|Enthralled Sailor|Preeettyyy...}}
:''Keelson, growing concerned, tries to get away from it.''
:{{text|say|Captain Keelson|Helmsman, steer us away!}}
:''The helmsman, enthralled as well, steers in the direction of the singing instead.''
:{{text|yell|Captain Keelson|No, you idiot, THE OTHER AWAY!}}
:''The scene fades to white as the sounds of the ship wrecking and screams can be heard.''

On the other side of the loading screen, you find yourself floating close to the shore with the wreckage nearby. Get to shore and turn in to [[Beachcomber Bob]].
