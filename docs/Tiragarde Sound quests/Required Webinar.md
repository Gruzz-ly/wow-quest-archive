==Objectives==
Free 5 Webbed Lumberjacks.
* [[Webbed Lumberjack]] freed (5)

==Description==
I'm not surprised some of the workers stayed in the woods, even amidst the beasts. While he won't admit it, some of father's workers are extremely dedicated.

And now they're trapped by the spiders!

Perhaps they have information about what is going on here. Free them from their webbings and see what they know!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
If they've been in the woods this whole time, the lumberjacks must have seen something that will help us in our investigation.

==Completion==
A witch?! This is all because of a witch?!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Required Webinar]] and [[Pest Prevention]] and [[Incident Reports]] before heading out.

Start killing [[Enthralled Mossfang]]s and [[Enthralled Ashclaw]]s, freeing Webbed Lumberjacks, and destroying [[Mossfang Egg]]s.
