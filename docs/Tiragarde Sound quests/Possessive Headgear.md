==Objectives==
Kill 10 Parasitic Mindstealers controlling [[Possessed Dockworker]]s in the [[Anglepoint Packing District]].
* [[Parasitic Mindstealer]] slain (10)

==Description==
It is fortunate that we have found [[Keegan Alby|Alby]]. He has filled me in on the situation in the packing district.

It's not good, <name>.

The workers walk, yes. They work as if nothing is out of the ordinary, yet they are controlled by parasites. [[Merciless one|Mindstealers]] that force them to do their bidding.

It is they who contaminate the shipments.

You must destroy as many of those mindstealers as you can. Free the minds of the possessed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Our priority is saving our people. We must do whatever we can.

==Completion==
This has never been a simple illness. There is foul magic at work here.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Young Lord Stormsong]] and [[Betrayal of the Guard]] before heading out.

Use the ships to cross over to the [[Anglepoint Packing District]], killing [[Mind-addled Enforcer]]s and attacking [[Possessed Dockworker]]s to release them from the [[Parasitic Mindstealer]]s.

In one of the buildings, look for [[Manager Yerold]]. He offers some side quests: [[Dangerous Cargo]] and [[Enemy Within]].
