==Objectives==
Spy on the [[Commoner|denizens]] of [[Bridgeport]].
* Investigate the harbor terrace
* Investigate the watchpost cabin
* Investigate the outdoor workshop

==Description==
While you're in Bridgeport, you might keep an ear out for any information that will be of aid to us.

You'd be surprised what you can learn by staying quiet and listening to people who think they're alone...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Now's not the time, <name>. Get to Bridgeport!

==Completion==
[[Explosive]]s in the [[Ashvane Foundry]]? Clearly we can put that information to use. Well done.

It sounds like that [[Captain Amalia Stone|Captain Stone]] is somewhat of a big-shot as well. It would be a shame if something were to happen to her...

==Notes==
;Harbor terrace
:{{Text|say|[[Captain Amalia Stone]]|Are those gunpowder shipments in from the Ashvane Foundry?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Bridgeport Guard]]|Y-yes, Captain Stone.}}

:{{Text|say|Bridgeport Guard|Of course, Captain.}}

;Watchpost cabin
:{{Text|say|Bridgeport Guard (1)|Sure am glad we got assigned out here today.}}

;Outdoor workshop
:{{Text|say|[[Wanda]]|Careful there, John. That gunpowder'll blow your hand clean off.}}
:{{Text|say|[[John (Bridgeport)|John]]|What? This is a BOMB? I thought it was an avocado.}}
