==Description==
I came in here tae try an' reclaim as many relics as possible. Sneakin' in was easy, but I'm worried about things noticin' me while I pack up. 

Mind watching me back while I get the relics stored in a safe place in my bag?

Everything worth our attention should be stored in my bag, many thanks.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Hilde goes to the [[Pile of Packaged Relics]].

Three waves of mobs: [[Living Artifact]], [[Angered Revenant]], and the last one is the [[Fallen Keeper]].
