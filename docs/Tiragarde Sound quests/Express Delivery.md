==Objectives==
Mark locations on the [[Horde]] [[ship]]s to direct [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]]'s spell.
* Ships marked (3)

==Description==
The Horde appears to have misplaced some of its [[:Azerite]]. It would be rude of us not to return it, don't you think?

The most efficient way is for me to teleport it back.

I've enchanted the harpoons in that launcher over there. Fire them onto the Horde ships in the bay. I can use them as beacons to return the Azerite to the Horde... and send its ships on their way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*[[Kul Tirans Don't Look at Explosions]]

==Progress==
Well done, <name>.

==Completion==
It appears as if the [[Kul Tiran fleet|fleet]] won't be needed for much more than hauling wreckage out of the bay.

Thank you for helping me to save my people before more could be killed by the Horde. Our foes are growing bolder. Clearly, we need to strike back. [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] will fight beside the [[Alliance]] when we do.

==Notes==
Hop on the [[Heavily Modified Harpoon Launcher]] and mark the ships with 1.

As soon as the objective is completed, a scene plays. 

:''A harpoon lands on a ship next to a troll, the player nods at Jaina while Okri has prepared the Azerite bombs. Jaina readies her spell to use the bombs on the Forsaken ships.''
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|For Kul Tiras!}}
:''Jaina uses her magic to teleport the bombs on the ships, forcing the crew abandon ships. Since Kul Tirans and cool guys don't look at explosions, Jaina and the player walk away as the ships are exploding behind them.''
