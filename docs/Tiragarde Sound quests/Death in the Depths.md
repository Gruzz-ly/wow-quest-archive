==Objectives==
Kill 8 Deepwarden Followers in [[Krakenbane Cove]].
* [[Deepwarden Followers]] slain (8)

==Description==
My own people have fallen to the mad whispers of the voices of the deep, deep sea.

Cultists inhabit caves in the ocean, spreading hysteria deeper and deeper into Tiragarde with their mad rituals.

We must put an end to them, <name>, before they get even more out of hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
We must send a message to these cultists: they are not welcome in Kul Tiras. My house's name is at stake!

==Completion==
Perhaps now the danger may come to an end.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eldritch Invocations]], [[Death in the Depths]], [[Deep Sea Defilement]] & [[Those Aren't Fish Eggs]] before heading out, and don't forget about the bonus objective: [[Creature Corruption]].

Valid targets include [[K'thir Harbinger]]s, [[Willing Cultist]]s, and [[Merciless Aberration]]s.

On return:
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|My scouts report that the corruption hasn't spread beyond the harbor yet. We're cullin' any monsters that stray too far out.}}
:{{text|say|Brannon Stormsong|Well done, Captain. The longer we can keep it contained, the longer we have to stop it.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|The tides seem to be calming. Perhaps our friend has made some progress.}}
:{{text|say|Okri Putterwrench|Well I sure hope so, because there's something else coming this way!}}

On complete of all five a short cutscene:
:''The camera shifts, showing some fishermen in their boats. Waves appear in what's supposed to be a tranquil harbor. Suddenly, [[Viq'Goth]], a giant kraken appears!''
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|OUTRIGGERS! OPEN FIRE!}}

==Progression==
{{The Shadow over Anglepoint}}
