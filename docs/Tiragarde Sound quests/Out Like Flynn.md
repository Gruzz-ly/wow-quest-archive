*Equipment Recovered
*[[Block Warden Carmine]] slain
*[[Glittering Gunpowder]]
*[[Cell Block Gate]] opened

==Description==
I'm relieved you woke up! Having to carry you would have made this job far less appealing.

The name's Flynn, and my client in [[Boralus]] is paying me a king's bounty to break you out of here.

You, my friend, are incarcerated in Tol Dagor. Used to be a legit prison... 'til the [[Ashvane Trading Company]] bought it. Now it's [[Priscilla Ashvane|Priscilla's]] own personal fortress, riddled with scum on both sides of the bars.

Wasn't hard to bribe my way into this cell. Now we just have to get out.

Not to worry. I have a plan!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,550 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Is that the new powder Flynn was talking about?

I'll take it for safekeeping.

==Completion==
It's hard to believe the Lord Admiral would willingly hand you and her daughter over to Lady Ashvane.

She must have had her reasons... right?

==Notes==
On accept:

Interact with Flynn to punch him:

:You ready?
:{{Gossip|I'm ready.}}

:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|All right, here's the plan:}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Hit me.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Come on, hit me!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Don't be shy! Give me your best shot.}}

:{{text|yell|Flynn Fairwind|AUGH! OH, YOU BRUTE!}}
:{{text|yell|Flynn Fairwind|GUARD! GUARD, HELP!! OHHH!!}}
:''Flynn plays dead.''
:{{text|say|Ashvane Jailer|Hey! What's going on in there?!}}
:''The guard opens the jail cell and starts attacking the player. Flynn gets up and one-shots the guard, then runs out of the cell.''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Quick! Hit that lever!}}

Next to the lever is a note pinned to the wall - "ATTENTION IDIOTS, DO NOT PULL!! - Warden Carmine". Ignore the note and pull the Cell Block Lever next to Flynn to start an [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]]:
{{#ev:youtube|lv_Eva2ju0M|urlArgs=start=36&end=55}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Riot, boys! Give 'em hell!}}
:''Cell doors swing open. [[Tol Dagor Inmate|Inmates]] flood forth, knock the guards out, and start escaping.''
:{{text|say|Ashvane Jailer|Wh-what?!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Grab your gear and let's pay the block warden a visit. We'll need his keys.}}

After the cutscene, interact with the Equipment Locker chest in the corner to re-equip. Lead Flynn to [[Block Warden Carmine]] at the far end of the hall, dispatching any [[Ashvane Jailer]]s that aggro along the way.

:{{text|yell|Block Warden Carmine|Nobody escapes on my watch!}} (aggro)

Work through Carmine's health, dodging the Azerite Grenades, but at 10% health, he casts last stand to commit suicide and destroy the keys:
:{{text|yell|Block Warden Carmine|Over my dead... body...}} (casting Last Stand)
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Damn! They keys are ruined. That was some serious firepower!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Just what kind of powder is this? Hey, help me grab some of this stuff.}}

Snag some of the Glittering Gunpowder on the table.
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Oh! One more thing. Well, two.}}
:''Flynn then takes his swords from a chest.''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ahh, that's better. I felt naked without these! Let's move.}}

Keep moving towards the exit of the cell block. At the locked gate:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Maybe we can blow the lock? Sprinkle some of that powder on it.}}

Sprinkle some powder on the gate by interacting with it:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Now for a little spark... You may wanna take a step back.}}
:''The gate explodes and Flynn flies 10 yards back, but quickly gets to his feet, none the worse for wear.''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Oof! That stuff packs a punch!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Let's get down to the lower levels and find a way out.}}

Taking a wrong turn
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Guess we're not going out this way. Let's try the other side.}}

Head downstairs, and pass through the [[Sodden Depths]], infested with [[Sewer Vicejaw]]s (and the bodies of [[Despondent Scallywag]]s), to reach [[Drain (Tol Dagor)|The Drain]]:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ugh... smells like a freebooter's hammock.}}

While in the sewer pipe, [[Sewer Rat (Tol Dagor)|Sewer Rats]] basically act as a gauntlet. Work through them:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Something touched my leg!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Wait wait, no. It was just my other leg. We're good.}}

Upon reaching the outside:
:{{text|yell|Ashvane Jailer|You! Stop right there!}}
:{{text|say|Ashvane Jailer|Wh-what?!}}
:''[[The Sand Queen]] appears and eats the jailer.''
:{{text|say|Ashvane Jailer|No! Noooo!!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Yeah, I'm officially done with this place.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Come on, our ride should be waiting for us just up the beach.}}

Loop around to the north to find Taelia in a boat:
:{{text|say|[[Taelia]]|Flynn! Over here!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|There she is! Let's hop in.}}

Hop in:
:{{text|say|Taelia|What is going on in there? It sounds like you started a riot!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|No idea what you're talking about... But I think we finally have some real dirt on Ashvane.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|A new gunpowder, like nothing I've ever seen.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|OH, and I rescued the target, of course. Crime-buddy, Taelia. Taelia, crime-buddy.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Wait... I recognize you...}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|You arrived with [[Jaina Proudmoore]]! You're the [[Alliance]] emissary!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Alliance emissary?! [[Cyrus Crestfall|Cyrus]] didn't mention that... I would have charged him double!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|You're lucky he's paying you at all. Now row!}}

Another in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|lv_Eva2ju0M|urlArgs=start=218&end=270}}
:''The camera pans back to [[Tol Dagor]] as Taelia and Flynn row back to [[Boralus Harbor]] before fading to black. The boat finally makes it to the harbor.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Here we are, Boralus Harbor. Aside from [[Proudmoore Keep]], it's the most heavily guarded part of the city. And the only place most visitors ever get to see.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Looks like another Alliance ship has already docked. Hopefully, they got a warmer welcome than Jaina did...}}
:''The camera keeps tracking forward to show more of the [[Tradewinds Market]] as the boat reaches the dock.''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Thanks for the lift, Tae. I'll report to the old man.}}

:{{text|say|Flynn|Right on time, as usual. Thanks for coming on such short notice!}}
<Get on the getaway boat with Taelia.>
:{{text|say|Taelia|We have to stop meeting like this.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn|I know, I know. But I got something BIG on Ashvane.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn|Plus I made a friend! Crime-buddy, Taelia. Taelia, crime-buddy.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Wait...I recognize you...}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|You arrived with Jaina Proudmoore! You're the Alliance emissary!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn|Wait, Jaina's back? How did that go over with Katherine?}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|You literally just broke the emissary out of an Ashvane prison. How do you think it went?}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Ashvane won't be happy about your little stunt. There are probably bounty hunters looking for you as we speak.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|You'll be safe in the market though. They wouldn't dare try anything here.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn|Thanks for the lift, Tae. I'll see you at the tavern.}}
