==Objectives==
Place 8 Gunpowder Crates in a hidden location southwest of [[Bridgeport]].
* [[Gunpowder Crate]] placed (8)
*Rendezvous with Lilian Voss on the road east of Bridgeport.

==Description==
We started this mission with a goal, but not much of a plan. I think I can see the pieces coming together, though.

<[[Lilian Voss|Lilian]] surveys the horizon, thinking.>

Place these [[explosive]]s over on the southwest edge of town. Somewhere inconspicuous.

We'll meet again over there. In the meantime... I need to find a [[horse]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Lucky for us, horses are in no short supply around here.

You placed the gunpowder?

==Notes==
Upon returning, Lilian is standing with a [[Stolen Horse]]. Behind them is a dead [[Unsuspecting Horseman]] engulfed in violet flames...

==Progression==
{{The First Assault}}
