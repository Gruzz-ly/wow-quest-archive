==Objectives==
Destroy the three [[Corrupting Pylon]]s in the underwater caves in [[Krakenbane Cove]].
* Southern Corrupting Pylon destroyed {{co|30.4|31.1|Tiragarde Sound}}
* Eastern Corrupting Pylon destroyed {{co|35.4|24.3|Tiragarde Sound}}
* Western Corrupting Pylon destroyed {{co|30.0|19.4|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
The sea...

I understand its screams now. It is as if a veil has been lifted, revealing the chaos that has taken hold.

Corrupting such a vast swath of sea cannot be done with simple spells. The cultists must have erected some sort of structures to channel their dark magics through...

You must find and destroy them, <name>. Only then can we hope to restore the waters to balance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
My mind is bursting with the tide's cries. It is almost too much to bear.

==Completion==
The screams have subsided, if ever slightly.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eldritch Invocations]], [[Death in the Depths]], [[Deep Sea Defilement]] & [[Those Aren't Fish Eggs]] before heading out, and don't forget about the bonus objective: [[Creature Corruption]].

*Eastern cave mouth at {{co|33.9|25.5|Tiragarde Sound}}
*Southern cave mouth at {{co|31.4|29.0|Tiragarde Sound}}
*Western cave mouth at {{co|30.9|21.6|Tiragarde Sound}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|My scouts report that the corruption hasn't spread beyond the harbor yet. We're cullin' any monsters that stray too far out.}}
:{{text|say|Brannon Stormsong|Well done, Captain. The longer we can keep it contained, the longer we have to stop it.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|The tides seem to be calming. Perhaps our friend has made some progress.}}
:{{text|say|Okri Putterwrench|Well I sure hope so, because there's something else coming this way!}}

On complete of all five a short cutscene:
:''The camera shifts, showing some fishermen in their boats. Waves appear in what's supposed to be a tranquil harbor. Suddenly, [[Viq'Goth]], a giant kraken appears!''
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|OUTRIGGERS! OPEN FIRE!}}
