==Objectives==
Kill Captain Gastrod and Guard-Commander Trunksal on The [[Siren's Daughter]], and Helmsman Miria on the [[Valorous Rose]].

[[Hobart Grapplehammer]] can fly you out to the [[ship]]s.
* [[Captain Gastrod]] slain
* [[Guard-Commander Trunksal]] slain
* [[Helmsman Miria]] slain

==Description==
The people in charge of those two ships are old colleagues of mine, <name>.

They did not achieve their rank through hard work as I did, but rather through deception and blackmail.

I think they deserve the hammer of karma. Or whatever weapon you prefer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
I am not a vengeful person... but appropriate punishment? Consider me a fan.

==Completion==
Each one of those people deserved nothing less than what you gave them.

==Notes==
