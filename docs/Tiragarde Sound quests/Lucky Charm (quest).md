==Description==
[[Majo|My daddy]] would never admit it, but he's really superstitious. I don't think he'll ever feel safe on a horse unless he has a lucky charm!

I heard about a [[fox]] somewhere around here that's been eating a lot of [[chicken]]s, and escaping everybody trying to catch him. I bet he's really lucky! Maybe if you got his tail and gave it to my dad, he'd feel lucky too!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Tails are real lucky, <name>. I think this one will give my dad heaps of courage!

==Completion==
I think I can feel the luck too!

==Notes==
