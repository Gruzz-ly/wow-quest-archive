==Objectives==
Collect the ingredients for Stone Soup in [[Mistfall Cleft]].
* [[Soup Stone]] (4)
* [[Unidentifiable Meat]] (2)
* [[Saurolisk Scale]]
* [[Stirring Bone]]

==Description==
On the surface of the rock you find carvings of what you make out to be ingredients.

If you find the ingredients, perhaps you can make the troggs' soup for yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Grimestone Stew]]
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
The flavor of the soup doesn't seem quite right. It must be missing ingredients.

==Completion==
The soup has somehow taken on a somewhat floral quality. It feels well-balanced on the tongue and goes down very smoothly.

This may be, in fact, the most delicious cuisine you have ever tasted.

==Progression==
{{The Norwington Estate}}

==Patch changes==
