:{{Text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|You've never been patient with your lab work, Sapphronetta.}}
:{{Text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Which explains why you gravitated towards the Explorer's League.}}
:{{Text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|Told you not to say anything.}}
:{{Text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|However, that impulsive drive also makes you the perfect fit for this expedition.}}
:{{Text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|I need brash dare-do-alls like you and Grizzek to lead the way into the dangerous unknown!}}
:{{Text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|I think he's saying we're expendable.}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|I think they're shooting at us!}}
:{{Text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|This must be a misunderstanding! King Mechagon will obviously want to meet me!}}
