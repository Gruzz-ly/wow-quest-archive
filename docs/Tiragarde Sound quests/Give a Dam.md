==Objectives==
Shoo 6 Woodchewing Beavers back to the water.
* [[Woodchewing Beaver]]s shooed (6)

==Description==
These loggers are destroying the forest, and harming the wildlife!

Beavers need this wood for their dams, but have had to resort to scrounging for scraps.

It's not safe for them anymore! Please, help me chase them back to the safety of the water.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Between the logging and the giant spiders, the beavers are in such danger!

==Completion==
Hooray! Now the beavers will be safe from the lumberjacks and the spiders!

==Notes==
While questing in the [[Algerson Lumber Yard]], players may come across [[Lyssa Treewarden]]. She offers this quest and [[Sowing Saplings]]. Pick them both up.
