==Objectives==
Obtain the Ashvane Explosives Formula and the Gunpowder Manufacturing Guide.
* [[Ashvane Explosives Formula]]
* [[Gunpowder Manufacturing Guide]]

==Description==
I suppose that, before we steal all the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]]' violently explosive gunpowder and use it against them, we should learn how they make the stuff.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Let's see the paperwork.

==Completion==
<Lilian quickly looks over the documents and nods.>

I suppose that someone in the [[Horde]] will find this information useful.

Probably [[goblin]]s.

==Notes==
Kill [[Forgemaster Farthing]] and [[Taskmaster Williams]] to loot the quest items.

==Progression==
{{The First Assault}}

==Patch changes==
