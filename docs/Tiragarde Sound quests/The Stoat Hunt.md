==Objectives==
Collect 5 Soft Stoat Pelts from [[Faintstep Stoat]]s.
* [[Soft Stoat Pelt]] (5)

==Description==
One of the greatest hunting sports amongst the [[Nobles of Kul Tiras|nobles of Boralus]] is the [[Ferret|stoat]] hunt. It is a sport of determination, patience, and skill. Do you think you can rise to the challenge?

Stoats are agile, sneaky, and sharp. They're next to impossible to catch out in the forest, so the best way to find one is to find its burrow and scare it out.

Find their burrows and bring back their pelts. Their fur is soft and much loved amongst the nobles.

==Completion==
Not only will these pelts please the nobles, they also prove your worth as a hunter.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Stoat Hunt]] and [[An Element of Danger]] and [[Bolas and Birds]] before heading out. While in the quest area, keep an eye out for [[Caleb Batharen]], who offers [[Settle the Score]].

Interact with [[Stoat Den]]s ([[Cragbound Fox]]es are standing near them) to lure [[Faintstep Stoat]]s and kill them for the quest item.
