==Objectives==
Help [[Taelia]] destroy the [[pirate]] [[ship]]s in [[Daelin's Gate]].
* [[Azerite Bombs]] stolen

==Description==
Cyrus taught me how to deal with thugs, bullies, and scum like pirates.

When they hit us, we hit back twice as hard.

<Taelia's hand finds the haft of her hammer and grips it tight.>

It's time to hit back.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
Those cowards only understand strength. Show them you're not an easy victim and they turn tail and run.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Taelia hops on her mount.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Hang in there, Flynn. Just... don't die.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|I will see justice delivered. First to these pirates, and then to the Ashvane Company.}}

Pick up [[Cease Fire!]] and [[For Kul Tiras!]] before heading out.

Head down into [[Daelin's Gate]]:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Such devastation... Daelin's Gate never stood a chance.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|If Azerite is capable of this kind of destruction, I fear not even the great gate of Boralus could withstand it.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Time to fight fire with fire. Let's search one of their ships for some of those Azerite bombs.}}

In Daelin's Gate, a bonus objective appears, [[Enemies at the Gate (bonus objective)]].

Head to the ship, working on other quest objectives along the way to find the Azerite Bombs:
:{{text|say|Taelia|These will do nicely. Let's get clear of the ship and give them a try!}}

A few yards away from the ship, the bonus action button appears:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Now! Let 'em have it!}}
*{{abilities|Azerite Bomb|Hurl a devastating Azerite bomb.|range=50|cd=6 sec|notes=Instant.|id=277387}}

Use it and ''The Plunder Runner'' goes up in flames:
:{{text|say|Taelia|We'll need a boat to reach the next ship.}}

Keep an eye out for [[Black-Eyed Bart]], in the ruins of the tower.

Head northeast to find the Landing Boat, then hop in it to get to ''The Bloodwake'':
:{{text|say|Taelia|Ready?! Throw!}}

Use the bonus action button again.
:{{text|say|Taelia|Gah! Maybe that was too close...}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|We should hit the next one from the air. Are you with me?}}
:''Taelia rows back to shore near Galeheart. Hop on.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Aim for their powder barrels!}}

While riding Galeheart, players have access to one ability:
#{{abilities|Azerite Bomb|range=75|cd=1.5 sec|Hurl a devastating Azerite bomb.|notes=Instant.}}

Hit one of the barrels:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Haaha! Take that, ya bilge-suckers!}}

Hit the remaining four:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Look! They're withdrawing!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|We did it... We actually did it!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Still, they could be back. And if they bring those guns to bear on Boralus...}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|I'll tell the lieutenant what's happened. Meet me in Vigil Hill when you're done here.}}

Back at Vigil Hill, Flynn has recovered and offers [[Freehold: A Pirate's End]].

This concludes the "Defenders of Daelin's Gate" chapter of the [[Tiragarde Sound storyline]]. The quest chain continues with [[Bearers of Bad News]].
