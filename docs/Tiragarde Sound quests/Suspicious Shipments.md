==Objectives==
Inspect 5 Marked Goods in the [[Ashvane Foundry]].
*[[Marked Goods]] inspected (5)

==Description==
Normally I wouldn't tell you nothin'... but I'll spill it for [[Cyrus Crestfall|Cyrus]].

[[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane's]] onto somethin' big.

They got guys workin' round the clock in there. Even brought in some muscle to keep everyone uh... "motivated."

I don't know anything about what they're makin', but I know it ain't passin' through here to [[Boralus]].

If I were dumb enough to go snooping around in there, I'd look at the goods themselves. See if they got shipping labels.

But I ain't that dumb, so you gotta do it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (100 [[Azerite (resource)]])
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
We need to find out how many more of these new weapons Ashvane has and where they might be sending them.

==Completion==
Sounds like they're making a ton of this stuff and keeping it under wraps.

That's bad.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Labor Dispute (quest)]] and [[Small Haulers]] before heading out.

On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Send those kids to the western edge of the foundry. I'll wait there and make sure nobody tries to snatch 'em.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Meet me there when you've got some information on those shipments.}}

After crossing the bridge to enter the [[Ashvane Foundry]], look out for a [[Posted Notice]] tacked to a wall that starts [[Message from the Management]].

Marked Goods have notes pinned to them in the vein of:
*"FRAGILE - DO NOT SHAKE"
*"NOT BOOZE! DO NOT OPEN!"
*"PRIVATE CONTRACT - KEEP DRY"

After interacting with the goods:
*<Peeling back the wrapping, you see a the glint of gunmetal within the crate.>
*<You see hundreds of fuses leading into small vials of glimmering gunpowder.>
*<The unmistakable scent of gunpowder wafts from this crate.>

Additionally, there are other suspicious objects like [[Azerite-Dusted Blade]]s all over the foundry that can be used (via the extra action button) to do some extra damage to enemies.

Finally, there's a Small Treasure Chest near [[Forgemaster Farthing]]. It contains a poor-quality item and some [[War Resources]].
