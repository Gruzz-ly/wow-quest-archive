Head north to find the Sandy Sweaweed-covered Chest:
:Tooth marks scar the front of the chest, and the lock appears to have been gnawed open.
:Scraps of burlap caught in the hinges suggest that a bag was torn out of the chest.
:The sand around the chest is covered in paw prints.

Just southwest by the dogs is a [[Dirty Diamond]]... in a pile of excrement. Of course.
