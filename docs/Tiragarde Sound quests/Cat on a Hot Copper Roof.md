==Objectives==
Climb the burning house and rescue [[Scratchy]].
*[[Scratchy (item)]]

==Description==
My parents said we have to go, but I won't leave Scratchy behind!

She's so gentle and precious and pure and kind and soft and cuddly! She must be so scared up there on the balcony!

Please help her!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Polished Pet Charm]]
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
We can't leave Scratchy here!

==Completion==
Yay!

Isn't she the sweetest most perfectest kitty cat ever?!

==Notes==
While in [[Vigil Hill]] for other quests, [[Meredith]] offers this quest.

Pre-pickup:
*{{text|yell|Meredith|Scraaatchyyy!! Come down!!!}}
*{{text|yell|Meredith|Scraaatchy! Are you still up there?! Meow twice if you can hear me!!}}
*{{text|yell|Meredith|Jump down, Scratchy! I'll catch you!}}
*{{text|yell|Meredith|Come down Scratchy! Come down! It's not safe up there!}}
*{{text|yell|Meredith|It's gonna be okay, Scratchy! Just wait there!}}
*{{text|yell|Meredith|We're gonna get you down, Scratchy! Just be good!}}

On accept:
:{{text|yell|Meredith|Hang on, Scratchy! Help is on the way!!}}
:{{text|yell|Scratchy|MrrOWWww.}}

A number of Rings are on the side of the house. Jump while standing immediately beneath the lowest ring to get in range of it, then interact with it to grab on. Reach from Ring to Ring, dodging the falling debris that occasionally falls down the house.

After looping all the way around the house, get to the last Ring and grab Scratchy. However, Scratchy is not really a fan and will scratch the player, debuffing him or her.

Don't be deterred, and grab Scratchy again, then jump down to Meredith.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Meredith|Yay! Thank you!}}
:{{text|say|Meredith|Come on, Scratchy! Let's go!}}
:''Meredith and Scratchy run off...''

==Trivia==
The name of this quest is a reference to the {{Wp|Tennessee Williams}} play {{Wp|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof}}.
