==Objectives==
Collect the [[:Dockmaster's Records]].
* [[Dockmaster's Records]]

==Description==
All this legwork will be for nothing if we can't show [[Katherine Proudmoore|Katherine]] hard proof linking the [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane Company]] to the freebooters here in [[Freehold]].

Ashvane might have been careful to encrypt their books, but I doubt the dockmaster here has any reason to be so secretive.

Check his office and find us something--anything--that connects him to Ashvane.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Lady Katherine is as stubborn as a [[whale shark]]. She won't buy our story without proof.

==Completion==
Nice work! This is undeniable proof that [[Priscilla Ashvane|Priscilla]] has been selling weapons to pirates.

It's high treason!

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Once you have proof that the Ashvane Company's been selling weapons to these scumbags, come find me up the hill at the main gate.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I've been gone a long time. Let's hope I still have a few friends inside.}}

Just down the hill, [[Geraldine]] is hiding among some bushes and offers [[The Beatings Will Continue]] and [[Rig Robbing]]. Also, keep an eye out for an [[Azerite Cannonball]] (there are several), which will start [[Loaded for Bear]].
