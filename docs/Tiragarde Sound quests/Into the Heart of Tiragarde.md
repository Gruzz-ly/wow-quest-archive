==Objectives==
Rendezvous with [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]] and [[Lilian Voss|Lilian]] in central [[Tiragarde Sound]].

==Description==
Step one is to establish a more suitable base of operations. A [[pirate]]'s den will do in a pinch, but I believe the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|warchief]] expects better of us.

Let's split up and push farther inland, to the west. Be on the lookout for something defensible and inconspicuous.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Completion==
<Nathanos peers around the corner at the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] [[Roughnecks|roughneck]] [[Timberfell Outpost|camp]].>

This will do. Not only is it well-hidden in the forest, but the locals seem to be rather dull and easily outwitted.
