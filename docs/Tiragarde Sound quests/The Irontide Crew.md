==Description==
You see those salty looking guys in red? That's the [[Irontide Raiders|Irontide crew]].

They're the worst of the worst. Cutthroats and [[brigand]]s, to a man.

Irontide wouldn't be guarding the docks if they didn't stand to gain something...

Lighten their pockets. See what kinda hardware they've got.

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
Just as I thought - Irontide cut some kind of deal with Ashvane.

Figures... birds of a feather and all that.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Once you have proof that the Ashvane Company's been selling weapons to these scumbags, come find me up the hill at the main gate.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I've been gone a long time. Let's hope I still have a few friends inside.}}

Just down the hill, [[Geraldine]] is hiding among some bushes and offers [[The Beatings Will Continue]] and [[Rig Robbing]]. Also, keep an eye out for an [[Azerite Cannonball]] (there are several), which will start [[Loaded for Bear]].
