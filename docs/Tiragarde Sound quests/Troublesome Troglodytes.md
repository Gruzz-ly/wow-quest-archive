==Objectives==
Kill 8 Grimestone Bullies and 3 Grimestone Throwers in [[Mistfall Cleft]].
* [[Grimestone Bully]] slain (8)
* [[Grimestone Thrower]] slain (3)

==Description==
[[Trogg]]s are base creatures. They barely have any brain process, living mostly on survival instinct alone. They are pests through and through, and need to be dealt with.

The fewer of them there are, the better.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
The troggs attack passers-by and take whatever... or whomever... they want for food. Enough is enough!

==Completion==
Fewer troggs means fewer of our people getting attacked.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Following Eddie's Trail]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{The Norwington Estate}}
