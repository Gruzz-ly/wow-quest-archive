==Objectives==
Eliminate the source of the [[:Azerite]] creatures.
* [[Earthshaper Brugaw]] slain

==Description==
Thanks for your help out there, but we have to ask another favor from you.

These elementals must be coming from somewhere in the mine and we need you to locate that source. 

You seem more than capable of handling yourself in there, but just for extra security I am going to send you with some of Prim's special dynamite. It has an extra kick from the Azerite dust that you gathered.

Get in. Find the source. Put a stop to these elementals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Did you find the source?

==Completion==
A trogg? Hmmm... He may have eaten quite a bit of Azerite to be able to cause all this.

With him gone, now we can clear out the remaining creatures here and get back to digging! Thank you for your help.

==Notes==
While in the [[Winterdeep Mine]] proper, players have access to an extra ability:
*{{abilities|Azerite-Infused Dynamite|range=20|cd=2.5 sec|Throw Azerite-Infused Dynamite at a location, inflicting heavy Nature damage.|notes=Instant}}

The ground in the mine is ''carpeted'' in [[Enraged Nibbler]]s. Thankfully, the dynamite does enough damage to one-shot them. Run forward, take out a dozen or so, repeat.

Find [[Earthshaper Brugaw]] near the end of the mine:
:{{text|say|Earthshaper Brugaw|My fancy rock! No you!}}

Shortly after aggroing him, both sisters run in:
:{{text|say|Ordnance Handler Prim|More explosions!}}
:{{text|say|Civil Technician Alena|I swear you're half goblin.}}

The sisters will spam Throw Dynamite on Brugaw, helping to work through his health pool. Finish hi off:
:{{text|say|Ordnance Handler Prim|We did it!}}
:{{text|say|Civil Technician Alena|You should report back to Theock! He'd be happy to hear that the mine is under control.}}

The nibblers have likely flooded the mine again, so carefully clear a path back to the surface, then across to Theock.
