==Objectives==
Use [[Lilian's Torch]] on the [[Pile of Ashvane Crates]] near the [[Ashvane Foundry]].
* Test bomb explosiveness

==Description==
I don't want to waste your time. Let's make absolutely sure that these are what we're looking for.

Here, take this torch and toss it over onto those crates. If they explode, then we'll know what to do next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
I... ah... I guess we've found our gunpowder then.

==Notes==
Use the Torch extra button to destroy the [[Pile of Ashvane Crates]].
