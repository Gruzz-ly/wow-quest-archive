==Objectives==
Discover information about [[Priscilla Ashvane|Lady Ashvane]]'s plans.
* Correspondence collected (5)

==Description==
I think Ashvane has been in contact with her [[Ashvane Trading Company|loyalists]], but I don't know what their orders are.

Go into their camp and see if you can't read their mail. We might find something that leads back to where Lady Ashvane is hiding or what their next move is going to be.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find any communications from Ashvane?

==Completion==
A recipe, a personal letter.... a grocery list? Oh! Yeah, this is a coded communication. Hmmm

<[[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey]] rubs her chin and idly flips one of her knives as she thinks>

I'm betting whoever is in charge here has the cipher. Why don't you go pay them a visit and get it for us.

==Notes==
The quest items are:
* [[Suspiciously Encrypted Letter]]
* [[An Annotated Recipe]]
* [[A Pile of Betting Slips]]
* [[Ashvane Shipping Record]]
* [[Bad Poetry]]
