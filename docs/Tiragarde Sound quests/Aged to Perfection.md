==Objectives==
Deliver the Hundred Year Bourbon to [[Carentan]] in [[Freehold]].
* [[Hundred Year Bourbon]] (Provided)

==Description==
Greetings, young one. I am [[Roko]]. I trade in specialty goods and exotic wares.

<Roko pulls a small wooden cask from beneath his shell.>

This bourbon is one hundred years old. I know, because I bought it one hundred years ago.

A man in Freehold is prepared to trade me a rare scroll for this, but alas I am barred from entering. It seems this town is not so "free" anymore.

If you can get in, perhaps you could make the trade on my behalf? I would be in your debt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|85|}}
* 4,110 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Are you with the Irontide?

I've already paid you people! Leave me alone!

==Completion==
Oh! The bourbon from that turtle fellow!

So... he's not coming himself? And I take it you're no Irontide loyalist.

Very well, hand it over.

==Notes==
After picking up [[Dress to Impress]] just outside [[Freehold]], Roko offers this quest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Roko|The man you are looking for is named Carentan. His shop is upstairs, at the south end of town.}}
:{{text|say|Roko|I suppose I'll return to Boralus empty-handed for now. Meet me there and we shall work out your compensation.}}
