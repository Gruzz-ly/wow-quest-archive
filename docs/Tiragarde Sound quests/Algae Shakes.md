==Objectives==
Dispense the Cleansing Tonic to 6 Nauseated Villagers in [[Anglepoint Wharf]].
* [[Nauseated Villager]]s treated (6)
*[[Cleansing Tonic]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that I have properly developed my tonic, it is of utmost importance that we dispense it amongst the ill at once.

Please, take this tankard and distribute the remedy to the sick. I will try to calm the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
This remedy was passed down to me from the [[tidesages]] that came before.

I just hope it helps us now.

==Completion==
In all my days, I have never seen such an illness. We must find the source!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Pulse of the Wharf]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|Be calm, children of the sea. We must put our faith in the waters to find a cure.}}

Head north to the quest area, and start force-feeding [[Nauseated Villager]]s and talking to the merchants. Additionally, there's a wanted poster, offering [[WANTED: Quartermaster Ssylis (Alliance)]].

Administering the tonic may cause [[Infectious Gutworm]]s to come out of the body of the infected! Defeat them:
*{{Text|say|Nauseated Villager|How did those things even get in my stomach?!}}
*{{text|say|Nauseated Villager|W...were those inside of me?}}
*{{text|say|Nauseated Villager|I... I don't feel so good...}}
*{{text|say|Nauseated Villager|My stomach hasn't felt this good in days!}}

Brother Therold has relocated up close to the quest area -- turn in to him there.
