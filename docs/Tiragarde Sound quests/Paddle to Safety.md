==Objectives==
Use the [[Escape Rowboat]] to travel to [[Outrigger Post]].
* Rowboat used

==Description==
Perhaps... perhaps I can still help my people.

I overheard conversations between the foreman and his men. It sounds as if the source of this corruption comes from the deeper waters, where the Stormriggers do their monster hunting.

Please, assist me in investigating this. I can still redeem myself and this operation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I can't sit idly by anymore.

==Completion==
From here, we can launch our investigation.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brannon Stormsong|Alright... I think I'm ready to go. We can still fix this.}}

Enter the rowboat:
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|The water's screams grow louder as we go out into the bay. I can feel the torment of the tides. These are ill omens, indeed.}}
:{{text|say|Keegan Alby|I'll give you another "ill omen". The bay is full of the Outriggers' prey.}}
:{{text|say|Brannon Stormsong|Do... do you believe that the sea creatures have been affected, too?}}
:{{text|say|Keegan Alby|Absolutely.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|We must discover the source of this defilement.}}
:''The rowboat reaches [[Outrigger Post]].''
:{{text|yell|Rosaline Madison|Get ready, Outriggers! These creatures are unlike anything we've faced before!}}

Pick up the flight path before turning in!

On complete:
:{{text|say|Okri Putterwrench|Brother Therold! Lord Stormsong! You've arrived at a most fortuitous time! We require your aid!}}
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|Oi! You're either talking or helping. Let's take the hunt to the water!}}

Four quests and a bonus objective are next: [[Eldritch Invocations]], [[Death in the Depths]], [[Deep Sea Defilement]], [[Those Aren't Fish Eggs]] & [[Creature Corruption]].
