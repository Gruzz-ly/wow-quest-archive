==Objectives==
Collect 4 heavy lumber and take it to the drop-off point.
* [[Heavy Lumber]] collected (4)
* Follow [[Dorian Atwater|Dorian]] to the drop point

==Description==
[[Maynard Algerson|Algerson]] is about as useful as a legless [[horse]]. We're going to do this ourselves.

The mill is overrun with [[wicker construct|bizarre creatures]]. I'll handle those. You and [[Algerson Lumberjack|these hearty volunteers]] will need to be the muscle of this operation.

Don't look at me like that, <class>. It's just a little lifting.

Once we have enough [[lumber]], [[Sal Atwater|Sal]] will meet us for a pick up. Just stay close to me and focus on not dropping my wood, yes?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Why are you all sweaty?

==Notes==
On accepting this quest:
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|And [[Maynard Algerson|you]] made it sound like [[Algerson Lumberjack|they]] didn't want to be useful.}}
:''Dorian and the Algerson Lumberjacks begin following the [[adventurer]].''

On entering combat, Dorian may say one of the following lines:
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Don't fret, I've got you.}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|I'll handle this. Don't drop my lumber.}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Just focus on the wood.}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|No need to panic.}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Stay at it. I'll take care of this.}}

On getting the second load, your hands are needed to pull the ropes lashed to your logs, so you'll need to use the action bar provided to call for Dorian's help to kill your attackers, and heal you if needed.

As the crew picks up each of the first three pieces of [[Heavy Lumber]], Dorian will say one of the following lines:
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Earn your keep, lads!}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Hup hup! Keep it moving!}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Lift with the legs.}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Put your backs into it.}}
*{{Text|say|Dorian Atwater|Faster you lift, faster we leave.}}

After picking up the fourth piece:
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|That'll do for now. Follow me.}}
:''Dorian runs a short distance ahead upslope, leading the way to the drop point.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|[[Sal Atwater|Sal]] should be waiting just up this path. Doesn't look too steep.}}
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Did you hear that?}}
:''A small group of [[wicker construct]]s appears, and you direct Dorian to fight them off.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Depths below, I hate this forest.}}

Stopping on the way to the drop point may cause Dorian to say one of the following lines:
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Come on, I can't carry you AND the wood.}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Do you WANT me to shout at you?}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|I suppose I do have all day.}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|I've seen [[tortollan]]s move faster than this.}}
*{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|You make this look difficult.}}

Reaching the drop point:
:{{text|say|Sal Atwater|Hello, pumpkin.}}
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Did you have any trouble getting [[Bound Earth|these rocks]] to move?}}
:{{text|say|Sal Atwater|They were quite helpful, actually. Ah... dearest?}}
: ''The lumberjacks pile up the logs, which begin to seep with [[Drust]] magic.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|What is it, Sal?}}
:{{text|say|Sal Atwater|I think this lumber is haunted.}}
