==Objectives==
Kill 10 Enthralled [[beast]]s in [[Fernwood Ridge]].
* Enthralled beasts slain (10)

==Description==
No wonder our workers are terrified to go into these woods. Generally the bears and [[spider]]s stay out of the way of [[human]]s... 

But these are no ordinary beasts!

[[Maynard Algerson|Father]] would be furious if productivity came to a halt. Please, cull these beasts so that the ridge can be safe once more!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Have you looked those beasts in the eye? Something is quite unusual about them.

==Completion==
I have never seen beasts so... soulless. It's as if they're under some sort of spell.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Required Webinar]] and [[Pest Prevention]] and [[Incident Reports]] before heading out.

Start killing [[Enthralled Mossfang]]s and [[Enthralled Ashclaw]]s, freeing [[Webbed Lumberjack]]s, and destroying [[Mossfang Egg]]s.
