==Objectives==
Meet [[Kelsey Steelspark]] in [[Freehold]].

==Description==
[[Alliance War Campaign|Our campaign]] against the [[Horde]] is going strong, but there are some loose threads to take care of.

[[Priscilla Ashvane|Lady Ashvane]] was broken out of [[Tol Dagor]] - by the Horde. We don't know where she's gone or what she is planning. I sent Kelsey out to track down some Ashvane Loyalists to get answers. She found them and has requested backup.

She's waiting for you in Freehold.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I found a whole nest of these guys!

You ready to help me take 'em out?
