==Objectives==
Collect 99 Steamy Essences.
* [[Steamy Essence]] (99)

==Description==
Heya! Isn't this place a dream? I couldn't be more relaxed. Well, I could be if these [[Steam Elemental (Tiragarde Sound)|annoying cloud jerks]] would leave me alone. 

Why don't you go punch some in their cloud faces. Oh, and bring back their essences, they help keep my tub warm.

* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I need more steam! Hurry, the tub is getting chilly!

==Completion==
Ooooh, that's nice. Real nice. Hop in if you want, the water is great! Ignore the bubbles.

==Notes==
While in the [[Longdrop Hot Springs]] for [[Frozen]], [[Griddon]] offers this quest.

Kill [[Steam Elemental (Tiragarde Sound)‎|Steam Elementals]] for 8-9x [[Steamy Essence]], and there are also [[Steam Shard]]s (huh?) which have 14-15.
