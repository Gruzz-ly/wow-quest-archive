==Objectives==
Collect 45 Azerite Dust and Walters' Chemistry Kit.
* [[Azerite Dust]] (45)
* [[Walters' Chemistry Kit]] {{co|76.1|57.4|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
I don't have time for idle chit chat! If you haven't noticed, rocks are running around doing who knows what?!

How about you help out and retrieve my chemistry kit. While you're out, smash some of those creatures and collect their dust. Prim will need both of those for the next step of the plan.

Maybe we can figure out what has animated the [[:Azerite]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the dust?

==Completion==
Great job! We are going to put this to good use.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Miner Operation]] before heading out.

Kill all forms of the animated Azerite to acquire dust.

Walters' kit is hanging on a wall in the house in the center of the quest area.
