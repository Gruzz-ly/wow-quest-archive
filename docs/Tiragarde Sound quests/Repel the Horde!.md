==Objectives==
Defeat [[Horde]] [[Axethrower|Axe Throwers]] or [[Berserker]]s on the north shore of [[Anglepoint Wharf]].
* Defeat Axe Throwers and Berserkers (0 / 100%)

==Description==
The Horde has overrun [[Anglepoint Wharf|Anglepoint]], killing my people and destroying their livelihoods. Its raiders have come to [[Kul Tiras]] with killing on their minds. I cannot allow that to happen.

Slay any Horde Axe Throwers or Berserkers you see on the north shore. I will do the same on the south. Together we will stop this invasion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I see you've been successful too, <name>.

==Completion==
I can see the Horde's ranks have thinned quite a bit.

I'm sure the [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lord Admiral]] will be pleased. I know I am. Not bad, mainlander.

==Notes==
;On accept of all four quests
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I believe I see some of the Outriggers fighting the Horde across the water. They'll help us take back Anglepoint.}}
:''Jaina, Taelia, and Okri walk towards the end of the pier, facing the water.''
:{{Text|say|Okri Putterwrench|The Outriggers almost certainly need mechanical restoration to their weaponry, Lord Admiral. I'll stay with <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Very well, Quartermaster. Taelia, you're with me.}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia Fordragon|Aye, Lord Admiral.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|<Name>, I will create a path for you to travel over the water to the Outriggers on the south shore.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|<Name>, take my water elemental to help you.}}
:''Jaina summons a [[Water Elemental (guardian)|Water Elemental]].''
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We'll meet up when we've cleared the Horde out of the Wharf.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|For Kul Tiras!}}
:''Jaina teleports away, followed by Taelia.''

You can use the frozen water to walk to Rosaline. Kill [[Invading Axe Thrower]]s, [[Invading Shaman]], and [[Invading Berserker]]s.
