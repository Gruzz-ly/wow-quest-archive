'''A Nation United''' concludes the [[patch 8.0.1]] portion of the overarching ''Battle for Azeroth'' campaign from the Alliance perspective, ending the [[Kul Tiras finale]] storyline. The greater storyline continues in the [[Nazjatar storyline]], added in [[patch 8.2.0]].

==Objectives==
Attend the council meeting at [[Unity Square]].
*Attend the Council Meeting

==Description==
You've done a fine job here, <name>.

With the city secure and [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] in command of the fleet, the time has come for [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] to formally join the [[Alliance]].

[[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]] has already departed for Unity Square to meet with Jaina, [[Katherine Proudmoore|Katherine]] and the heads of the major Kul Tiran houses.

They are waiting for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]
* [[A Nation United]]

==Completion==
Hero, you have brought my family and my country back together again.

My heart is whole for the first time in many years.

I cannot thank you enough.

==Notes==
As of [[patch 8.2.5]], you will be prevented from getting this quest if the auto-accept quest [[The Wolf's Offensive]] is in your questlog. You will simply have to complete that quest first to make Genn spawn. By the same token, any other quest in that questline, such as the next one, [[Send the Fleet (Alliance)]], will need to be abandoned first to spawn Genn.

Take the flight master from [[Boralus Harbor]] to [[Proudmoore Keep]]. Upon arrival at Unity Square, a crowd has gathered for the meeting of the Kul Tiran leaders.

In front of [[House Stormsong]]'s banner, [[Brannon Stormsong]] stands with two [[Awakened Tidesage]]s, several [[Awakened Tideguard]]s and a [[Tidal Guardian (NPC)|Tidal Guardian]].

In front of [[House Waycrest]]'s banner, Marshal [[Joan Cleardawn]] leads a contingent of [[Waycrest Guard]]s, [[Waycrest Falconer]]s and [[Waycrest Attendant]]s.

Between the two groups stand the [[Proudmoore Guard (NPC)|Proudmoore Guards]], with [[Taelia]] and [[Galeheart]] on the left and [[Tandred Proudmoore]] on the right.

On the other side of the circle is Anduin and eight [[Lion's Guard]]s, facing the Kul Tirans.

Katherine, the outgoing [[Lord Admiral]], begins the meeting:

:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Thank you all for coming. I shall keep this brief.}}
:''Katherine faces [[Lucille Waycrest]], leader of House Waycrest.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Division has made us vulnerable. We are beset by enemies from within.}}
:''Katherine turns next to [[Brother Pike]], leader of the [[Storm's Wake]].''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|The Horde, too, has made its intentions clear. Those savages would see us burn.}}
:''Katherine turns to Jaina.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|I ask you now to put your faith in my daughter Jaina... the true Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras.}}
:''Lastly, Katherine turns to Anduin.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|And to renew our bond with the Alliance, whose heroes have saved us from our own unmaking.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|What say you?}}
:''Lucille steps forward, kneeling before Katherine and Jaina.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|House Waycrest stands with you, Lord Admiral. And with the Alliance.}}
:''Brother Pike steps forward and kneels as well.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|The Storm's Wake shall guide the fleet to victory for the Alliance, as we have before.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Thank you... all of you. I will do everything I can to prove worthy of your trust.}}
:''Anduin steps into the center.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I am pleased and honored to welcome Kul Tiras back into the Alliance. May the Light guide us to victory.}}

At that point, each person in the center steps back. After turning the quest in to Katherine, she speaks up again:

:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|King Wrynn, there is someone you should meet.}}
:''Taelia walks forward.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Along with your champion, she was instrumental in saving our kingdom... and my life.}}
:''Taelia kneels before Anduin.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|It is an honor to meet you, King Wrynn. I am Taelia.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Taelia Fordragon.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Fordragon?!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Daughter of [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]]. Fostered under our protection since the [[Third War]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Taelia... please, rise. The honor is mine.}}
:''Taelia stands, her tone searching.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Did you know my father?}}
:''Anduin responds with high praise.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Highlord Bolvar was a great man. A true hero to the Alliance--and to me.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I remember now... he used to write you letters. He had a nickname for you...}}
: ''She finishes the sentence wistfully.'' 
:{{text|say|Taelia|"My shining star."}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|The letters stopped coming. I... I have so many questions.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Taelia, when time permits, you must come to [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] as my guest. I have many stories to share about your father.}}
:''Taelia curtsies, and returns to the Proudmoore contingent.''
