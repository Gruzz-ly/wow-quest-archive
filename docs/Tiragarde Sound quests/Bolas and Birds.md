Up in the mountains we know the value of a good hunting companion. We use bolas to shoot down our flying prey, then our [[retriever]]s go and bring us our kill!

You want to take a shot? [[Nickel]] can accompany you. Shoot down some of the falcons in the woods. My dog will finish the job.

There's nothing like man and beast working together for a clean hunt!

Pick up [[The Stoat Hunt]] and [[An Element of Danger]] and [[Bolas and Birds]] before heading out.

While in the quest area, keep an eye out for [[Caleb Batharen]], who offers [[Settle the Score]].
