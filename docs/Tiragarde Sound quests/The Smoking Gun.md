==Objectives==
Fire Flynn's Pistol at the Water Barrel in the [[Harbormaster's Office]].
* Water Barrel shot

==Description==
The [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane Company]] doesn't know it yet, but throwing you into [[Tol Dagor]] was the biggest mistake they've ever made.

That new powder we swiped could be the key to bringing them down.

First, how about we give everyone a little demonstration of just how powerful this stuff is?

<Flynn loads a pinch of the glittering powder into his pistol.>

Go ahead, take a shot at that barrel over there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|60|}}
* 12,350 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Don't worry, it won't hurt anyone.

I think.

==Completion==
Adds a kick, don't it?

==Notes==
Use the extra action button to shoot the water barrel next to the fireplace behind [[Cyrus Crestfall]]:

:''The recoil from the pistol shot knocks down Flynn and Taelia, and launches the player back 10 yards!''
:{{Text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|What was THAT?!}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ashvane's dirty secret.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|And that was just a pinch! Imagine how much damage they could do with more of this stuff.}}

Cyrus offers the next quest, [[The Ashvane Trading Company]].

;Objectives
Fire Flynn's Pistol at the Barrel in the tavern.
*Barrel shot

;Description
The [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane Co.]] doesn't know it yet, but throwing us into [[Tol Dagor]] was the biggest mistake they've ever made.

I swiped this from one of the guards when they picked me up.

<Flynn takes a pinch of coarse, glittering powder from a small leather pouch and loads it into his pistol.>

Go ahead, take a shot at that barrel over there. 

;Progress
Why'd they arrest me in the first place? Uh… business disagreement.

;Completion
That powder adds a little kick, doesn’t it?
