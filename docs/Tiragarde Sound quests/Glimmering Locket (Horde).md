==Objectives==
Return the Glimmering Locket to [[Stabby Jane]].
* [[Glimmering Locket]] (provided)

==Description==
<A glint of metal catches your eye among the gently bobbing flotsam. Digging into the tangled seaweed, you discover a locket of simple, yet sturdy design.

Opening the locket reveals a hand-drawn picture of a woman with fiery red bangs. 

Her arm is around a woman with short-cropped auburn hair, and the two are proudly displaying warm smiles for the artist.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hm? What's that you've got there?

==Completion==
Is that?

<Jane takes the locket and opens it tenderly. Tears begin to well up in her eyes as she closes it and tucks it away in her jacket.>

Thank you.
