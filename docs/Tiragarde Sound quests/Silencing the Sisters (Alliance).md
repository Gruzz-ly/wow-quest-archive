==Objectives==
Slay Patheope and Nolpe.
* [[Patheope]] slain
* [[Nolpe]] slain

==Description==
The [[siren]]s in this tideway have drawn countless ships to their doom. Wiping them out would be a boon to all seafaring folk.

But you can't very well kill all of them. Only a fool would try that.

The real dangerous ones are the elders. The "sisters" as they're known. Bigger, smarter, and stronger than the younger ones. Their voices carry far out to sea and bring in all the big "catches."

I managed to track two of them to a den at the northern end of the tideway, but I can't take them alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Small Azerite Shard]] (100x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Sirens can be handled with relative ease. The older ones take a bit more work.

==Completion==
By quieting their deadly song, you have saved countless lives.

==Notes==
Mouth of the cave at {{co|87.0|72.6|Tiragarde Sound}} in the [[Wailing Tideway]]. Upon aggroing one of the two sirens, the other will also aggro, and Stabby Jane runs in:
:{{text|yell|Stabby Jane|That's enough singing from you two!}}

Finish them off:
:{{text|say|Stabby Jane|Good work. Maybe some day these waters will be safe again.}}

==Progression==
{{Castaways and Cutouts}}
