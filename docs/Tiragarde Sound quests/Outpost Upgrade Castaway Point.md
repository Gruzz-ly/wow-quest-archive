==Objectives==
Talk to [[Dynamite Jack]] in [[Castaway Point]].

==Description==
The mission at Castaway Point was a success. Well done, <name>.

We now have access to a very large [[cannon]] which promises to be a fast way to travel to [[Tiragarde Sound]]. Glad that's not how I plan to get around.

Travel to Castaway Point and enquire about this upgrade.

==Completion==
Ain't she a beauty? I know its unusual, but this baby here can get you quick smart to Tiragarde Sound. 

Want to give her a shot?
