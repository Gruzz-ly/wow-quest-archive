==Objectives==
Kill Whompus.
* [[Whompus]] slain

==Description==
Revenge has never really been my thing, but whatever is in there killed my crew and I am not going to let it stand.

Everybody fights, nobody quits.

You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Don't chicken out on me.

==Completion==
To survive out here, we do what we have to. Today that meant avenging members of the pack.

Thank you for your help. If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to call on the Roughnecks.

==Notes==
Enter [[Whompus' Lair]] and take out the wendigo.
