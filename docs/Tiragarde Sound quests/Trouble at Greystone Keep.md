==Objectives==
Speak with [[Tallis Skyheart]].

==Description==
A friend of mine, a fellow military courier, had a job at [[Greystone Keep]]. The fort lies just outside of [[Boralus]], so I would've expected him to be back by now.

I have another job lined up, so could you go check out the fort for me? I'm probably just being paranoid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
A courier? I think we lost him in the coup.

==Progression==
{{Greystone Keep}}

==Trivia==
*During the beta, it was named "Trouble at Southport Watch".

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
