==Objectives==
Speak with [[Cagney]] at [[Eastpoint Station]]. Take the ferry from [[Will Melborne]] in [[Tradewinds Market]].
* Take the Ferry to Eastpoint Station (optional)

==Description==
So, [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane's]] goons are walking around with a new powder that can blow a galleon clean in half and the military has no idea.

We need to find out how much of this powder they have and where it's going.

An old buddy of mine works the ferry down by the [[Ashvane Foundry]]. He may know something about this.

You can take the ferry from Tradewinds Market to Eastpoint Station. Once you get there, look for a man named Cagney. Tell him I sent you. He owes me a favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Eh? What do you want?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Flynn, I have another job for you: Help our new ally track down the source of this powder.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|You got it.}}
: ''Flynn walks for the exit.''
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Taelia, prepare to make your rounds again. Tell the city guard to be on the lookout for unusual weapons being smuggled into Boralus.}}
: ''She salutes.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Aye, sir!}}

Get to [[Will Melborne]] at the ferry dock and ride to [[Eastpoint Station]]. At Eastpoint, head up the hill and check in with [[Cagney]], by the fire. Somehow Flynn has already made it there.

Cagney and [[Olive]] offer the next quests: [[Suspicious Shipments]], [[Labor Dispute (quest)]], and [[Small Haulers]].
