==Objectives==
Man the [[Vigil Hill Cannon]] and use it to slay 20 looters.
*Looters slain (20)

==Description==
We are dealing with lawless, no-account thugs. As soon as they gained ground, they started looting! Looting right in the middle of a battle!

Well I, for one, am not giving up our booty that easily.

Get up to the top of Vigil Hill and man the main cannon. Rain hellfire down on those blaggards!

Dismissed!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Navigator's Bracers
|Freebooter Armbands
|Outrigger Armguards

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What are you waiting for? Get up there and man that cannon!

==Completion==
They destroyed the main gun?!

Then it's time to advance on foot!

==Notes==
Run up to the top of Vigil Hill and hop in the cannon. It has one ability:
*{{abilities|Cannonball|Fire a cannonball.|range=50|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant. Uses the path-tracing arc adjusted by moving the camera.}}

Take out 20 looters, and one of the ships will return fire, destroying the cannon!
