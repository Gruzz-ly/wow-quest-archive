==Objectives==
Put on the [[Irontide Hat]] and enter [[Freehold]] with [[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]].
* Speak with the [[Irontide Recruiter]]
* Enter the [[Dead Man's Tale]]

==Description==
Freehold used to be open to anyone, but now it seems the [[Irontide Raiders]] have declared themselves the owners. They're locking the place down and turning away anyone who isn't part of the crew.

Fortunately, they're also hiring.

Put this on. Don't think about where it came from.

We'll pose as new recruits, get in, gather some information, and be back in [[Boralus]] in time for supper! [[Cyrus Crestfall|Cyrus]] may be salty, but he's a decent cook.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Don't worry, [[Venrik|Venrik's]] a good man. I trust him with my life.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Put the hat on. You can't be a scurvy sea dog without a hat!}}

After putting on the hat:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Looking good. Let's tell the recruiter we've come to volunteer.}}

In the area, Roko offers [[Aged to Perfection]] and there's a rare parrot, [[Squacks]]<!--132280--> just on the next rise. Squacks is friendly to players wearing the hat, so make sure to take it off to fight it.

To continue, speak with the [[Irontide Recruiter]]<!--128700-->:
:Aye? What you want?
{{gossip|We want to join the Irontide Raiders. We brought our own hats.}}
:{{text|say|Irontide Recruiter|Hmm... Well, ye DID bring yer own hats...}}
:{{text|say|Irontide Recruiter|All right, get in there and report for... "orientation." Heh.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Hazing. He means hazing.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Don't worry, we're skipping that part. I know a place we can hide out while we gather information.}}

Take the bridge past the [[Irontide Bouncer]]s to reach [[Freehold]] proper. A cutthroat notices:
:{{text|say|Irontide Cutthroat|Heh. Fresh meat.}}

Find the [[Dead Man's Tale]], the inn of Freehold, and Flynn will complete the quest.

;Approach Venrik
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ahem... AVAST ye bloated barnacle! We've come for yer booty!}}
:{{text|say|Venrik|I told you Irontide punks to--wait a minute... Flynn?!}}
:{{text|say|Venrik|I thought you were dead! Oh, don't tell me you're actually workin' for those bootlickers!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|It's... kind of a long story. How about a drink?}}
