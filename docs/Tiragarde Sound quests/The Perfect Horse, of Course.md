==Progress==
My dad thinks horses can have lots of personalities, just like us. We gotta find him the perfect horse for his first ride!

==Completion==
He's on! He's on!

Don't worry, <name>. I'm sure he'll be fine! Thanks for all of your help!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Majo|Before we begin, let me get prepared. Just a moment...}}
:{{text|say|Majo|Well, enough dawdling, then. It is time to identify the perfect horse!}}
:{{text|say|Majo|My friend, would you mind assisting in the inspection of these horses? Only the perfect horse will do!}}

First horse:
:{{text|say|Joma|What about this one, Dad?}}
:{{text|say|Majo|No, no, Joma. This one will not do. It is too... uh... fidgety. Yes! Fidgety! I suspect it would spook at any abrupt movement.}}

Second horse:
:{{text|say|Joma|This one looks nice!}}
:{{text|say|Majo|No, no, child. I cannot ride this one. He... he looks too bouncy! Look at his gait. My old bones could never handle such motion!}}

Third horse:
:{{text|say|Joma|I like this one. I think it's the prettiest! Dad?}}
:{{text|say|Majo|This is not the horse for me, my son. Look at the shine in her eyes when her gaze falls upon me. She craves my shell as food!}}

Maxwell:
:{{text|say|Joma|All right, Dad, we've waited long enough. You have to get on this horse!}}
:{{text|say|Majo|Al... alright, child. I guess it is time. My friend, can you help me?}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Majo|Okay, Joma. Please guide me to the training grounds. I think it shall be optimal for... learning the reins, if you will.}}
:{{text|say|Joma|You got it, Dad! Hold on tight!}}
:{{text|say|Majo|Okay, I think I can... handle...}}
:{{text|say|Majo|NOPE! I CAN'T HANDLE! TOO FAST!}}
:{{text|say|Majo|THE BEAST IS OUT OF CONTROL!}}
:{{text|say|Majo|DON'T LET GO DON'T LET GO DON'T LET GO!}}
:{{text|say|Majo|Wait... Joma! Joma, I'm doing it!}}
:{{text|say|Majo|This is... this is quite freeing!}}
:{{text|say|Joma|You're doing great, Dad!}}
