==Objectives==
Collect 4 Venomous Barbs from [[Barbtail Stingray]]s.
* [[Intact Venomous Barb]] (4)

==Description==
The [[Outriggers|Outrigger hunters]] exhibit the pinnacle of [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] brawn. But they would indubitably be unable to succeed in taking down the most impressive of their prey without my own inventions!

I present to you, the most ordinary of harpoons. However, with just a tad of gnomish ingenuity, this average weapon can become so much more!

All that I need are barbs from the rays in the harbor. Using them, I can fashion a poison that can stun even the most colossal of sea monsters!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Be careful with those stingers, <name>! They'd put someone of your frame down easily!

==Completion==
Well throw me a hammer and call me Nancy!

Thank you kindly pal. This should be plenty! I'll get to work!

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Cure from the Sea]] and [[Sharks in the Water]] before heading out.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Roasline Madison|Okri, what's the status of our supplies? I want to get out into the water as soon as we can. Time's wastin'!}}
:{{text|say|Okri Putterwrench|I only require a few more minutes, Rosaline. With the help of the enhanced harpoons, you shall triumph over your quarry!}}

Try to stay on the seafloor while gathering Harbor Seaweed, killing [[Barbtail Stingray]]s for their [[Intact Venomous Barb]]s and slaying [[Invading Dreadmaw]]s.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Roasline Madison|We're not waiting for your blessing any longer, Therold. We've got monsters to kill.}}
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|Let's go, Okri. The Outriggers are waiting.}}
