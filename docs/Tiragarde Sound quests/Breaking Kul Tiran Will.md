==Objectives==
Sail to Tiragarde Sound.
* Speak with [[Tattersail]] to sail to [[Tiragarde Sound]]

==Description==
Our partnership with the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] will soon be secured. Took a little longer than I expected... but such is the way of things.

Unfortunately, the [[Alliance]] seems intent on securing a [[Kul Tiran fleet|naval force]] of their own. That can't be allowed to happen.

We set sail for Tiragarde Sound when you're ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We're here. Now, to cause a bit of trouble for the locals.

<Nathanos looks at you, then at the rest of the group.>

We don't look too conspicuous, do we?
