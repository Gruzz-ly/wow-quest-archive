==Objectives==
Obtain 7 Lengths of Chain and 7 bolts of Sail Canvas from the outskirts of [[Bridgeport]].
* [[Length of Chain]] (7)
* [[Sail Canvas]] (7)

==Description==
Log cabins will do in a pinch, but... if we're going to be spending any time here, we might as well make ourselves comfortable.

The [[roughnecks]] left us no shortage of [[lumber]] and [[food]] supplies, but we'll need canvas and chains to set up some proper [[Forsaken]] [[tent]]s and [[banner]]s. Bridgeport sounds rather lootable, doesn't it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
With a name like Bridgeport, I have to assume that the town has plenty of supplies in transit, ready for looting.

==Completion==
I'll have the [[Dark ranger|rangers]] start working with these right away.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Remember - Bridgeport is a large settlement, and well-guarded. Try and stay on the edges of town... for now.}}
