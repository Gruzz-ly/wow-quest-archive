==Objectives==
Check 5 Barrels of Fish.
*[[Barrel of Fish (Tiragarde Sound)|Barrel of Fish]] checked (5)

==Description==
If one shipment was compromised, who knows how many of the others are.

Nearby, the fishpackers prepare shipments to be sent to the rest of [[Kul Tiras]]. We must check the rest of the shipments before this plague can spread!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I fear that if even a single worm-ridden shipment is allowed to leave Anglepoint, this plague will spiral out of control.

==Completion==
I am... aghast. How could this happen right under our very noses?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Evacuate the Premises]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|I will move to scout further in town. Pray that the people there are safe!}}

Barrels contain either an [[Infesting Mindeater]] or three [[Infesting Brainworm]]s.

[[Brother Therold]] has made it to [[Keegan Alby]]'s position further west. Approach them:
:{{text|say|Brother Therald|Alby? What's going on? Where is Lord Stormsong?}}
:{{text|say|Keegan Alby|You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Therold. It's a disaster.}}

==Progression==
{{The Shadow over Anglepoint}}

==Patch changes==
