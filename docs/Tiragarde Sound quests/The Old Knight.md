==Objectives==
Meet with [[Cyrus Crestfall]].
* Enter the [[Harbormaster's Office]]
* Speak with Cyrus Crestfall
* Hear Cyrus' tale

==Description==
These days Cyrus is the Harbormaster, but he used to be one of [[Daelin Proudmoore]]'s most trusted [[knight]]s!

I lost my mother when the [[Scourge]] hit [[Lordaeron]]. My father sent me here to be raised away from the war. I don't know much about him... just that he was a [[Stormwind (kingdom)|Stormwind]] knight who gave his life fighting the [[Lich King]].

Daelin hand-picked Cyrus to raise me and forced him to take a desk job. It's the only reason he wasn't [[Invasion of Durotar#Admiral's fall|at Theramore]].

He's probably checking in that other [[Alliance]] ship. Let's go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|70|}}
* 8,250 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Sorry, I should have mentioned he can be a bit... long-winded at times.

==Completion==
I've never seen Cyrus fired up like this!

Sounds like we have work to do.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|You'll feel at home here in no time. Now let's check in with Cyrus!}}

Jump down a level, and take a right to enter the [[Harbormaster's Office]].
:{{text|say|Taelia|Come on! The harbormaster's office is just through here.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Wait... What's going on?}}

Upon entering the office an [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|MFuc-i_v2sY|urlArgs=start=34&end=85}}
:''Just on the other side of Cyrus's office, Harbor Guards are preventing passengers of the Alliance ship, including [[Genn Greymane]], from disembarking. Cyrus is less than pleased.''
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Stand down! Don't you know who that is?}}
:{{text|say|Harbor Guard|But sir... [[Priscilla Ashvane|Lady Ashvane]] ordered--}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Lady Ashvane? Do you serve Lady Ashvane? Is that [[House Ashvane|Lady Ashvane's crest]] upon your shield?}}
:{{text|say|Harbor Guard|N-no, sir.}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|No! You serve [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]]! You wear the [[House Proudmoore|crest of Proudmoore]]! And you take your orders from ME.}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Now stand down and let them pass. We shall parley in my office.}}
:{{text|say|Harbor Guard|Aye, sir!}}
: ''The lead guard turns to the others.''
:{{text|say|Harbor Guard|Let them through!}}
:''Cyrus, Genn, and the party walk offscreen towards the office.''

On the other side of the cutscene Cryus welcomes Genn as they all walk into Cyrus's office:
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|King Greymane, it is an honor. You are free to remain in the harbor on my authority.}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Taelia! Prepare a full briefing for our guests.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Aye, sir!}}

Speak with Cyrus:
:You must be the Alliance emissary. I'm glad Flynn and Taelia were able to get you out of that damn prison.

:I am Sir Cyrus Crestfall. On behalf of the Proudmoore Admiralty, I welcome you to Kul Tiras.

:<Cyrus extends his massive hand warmly.>

:{{gossip|<Shake his hand.>}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|[[Katherine Proudmoore]] turned us away and had her own daughter cast out as a traitor.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Why would you help us?}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Hmph... Humor an old knight for a moment, would you?}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|I was in a battle many years ago. It was... the [[Second War]]? Tough to keep them all straight.}}
:''Cyrus turns and walks to the fireplace behind him.''
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|An orcish juggernaut struck our transport. Splinters from the gunnel ripped across the deck and tore into a friend of mine.}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Should have been his ticket home, but he was a stubborn one. Refused to leave before the war was won. So he patched himself up and told the healers he was fine.}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|A few days later, he woke up screaming and drenched in sweat. Infection had eaten away at his insides. My friend never saw another sunrise.}}
:''Cyrus tuns to face Genn.''
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|By the time he asked for help, it was too late.}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Kul Tiras still bears the scars of the [[Third War]]. No one feels this more deeply than Katherine Proudmoore.}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|But she is misguided. Her advisors have kept her blind to the infection that has spread throughout our kingdom.}}
:''Cyrus returns to his previous position in front of Genn.''
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|The land I love is falling apart... so I'm asking for your help. Kul Tiras needs the Alliance just as badly as you need us.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|I see. Than we shall prove to Katherine Proudmoore the same truth I learned at great cost...}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|In unity, there is strength.}}

Speak with Taelia to continue.

;Description
These days Cyrus is the Harbormaster, but he used to be one of Daelin Proudmoore's most trusted knights! Until I came along. You see, my mother was from Lordaeron and my father was a Stormwind knight. When he lost my mother to the Scourge, my father sent me here. Then he... well, all I've been told is that he gave his life to defeat the Lich King. Daelin hand-picked Cyrus to raise me. He would have never taken a desk job otherwise. Anyway, he's probably checking in your other ship. Let's go!

;Progress
Pleased to meet you.
