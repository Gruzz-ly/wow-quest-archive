==Objectives==
Drop Vile Bombardment on 100 pirates in Freehold.
*Pirates Bombed (100)

==Description==
The loud men are mean, but you seem nice!

Want to have fun fun?

The pretties love my special biscuits, but it makes them full full. Then they have to... go. You know?

Let's prank the mean men! Fly fly on the pretties and make them go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10x [[Polished Pet Charm]]
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Go! Go! Go!

==Completion==
That'll teach 'em!

==Notes==
Head just upstairs and interact with the [[Riding Macaw]] to hop on. It has one ability:
*{{abilities|Vile Bombardment|Covers the target in a vile substance, inflicting 0 Nature damage every 1.5 sec for 30 sec.|range=100|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant. Ground-targeted AoE}}

When pirates are hit, they occasionally respond:
*{{text|yell|Gyahhh! I'll pluck yer wings off ya flyin' rat!}}
*{{text|yell|The eyepatch! It does nothing!}}
*{{text|yell|Ack! Me mouth was open!}}

While on the quest, keep an eye out for four suspicious objects:
*[[Banana Hoard]] {{co|76.1|84.6|Tiragarde Sound}} on top of a house 
*[[Sweete's Feast]] {{co|73.4|83.9|Tiragarde Sound}} by the arena
*[[Cart o' Cutlasses]] {{co|75.0|82.9|Tiragarde Sound}}
*[[Blacktooth Brew]] {{co|76.7|81.8|Tiragarde Sound}}

Nail all four objects to earn the achievement [[Bless the Rains Down in Freehold]]. Should players not accomplish it while leveling, the world quest [[Swab This!]] provides another opportunity.
