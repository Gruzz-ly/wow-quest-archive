==Objectives==
Obtain 8 crates of Ashvane Explosives.
* [[Ashvane Explosives]] (8)

==Description==
First: we get as much of that gunpowder as we possibly can. Imagine the terror in the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]]' eyes when they realize the [[Horde]] has turned their own weapons against them.

Imagine it, <name>.

<Lilian's eyes briefly glaze over, and the corner of her lips turns upward in a half-smile.>

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

I've managed to round up a few crates myself. How did you do?

==Completion==
Excellent.
