==Objectives==
Collect 4 Blight Specialist Masks.
*[[Blight Specialist Mask]] (4)
*Find Rosaline Madison past the waterfall in Anglepoint Wharf

==Description==
The [[Outriggers]] have fought some pretty tough monsters and [[Horde]] savages aren't so much different. The [[Invading Blight Specialist|Blight Specialists]] they brought weren't especially tough, but they were the most dangerous.

Kill a few of them and bring back their face masks. [[Okri Putterwrench|Okri]] can work his mechanical wizardry and build us better masks of our own in case any Horde scum dare show their [[New Plague|blight]]-spreading faces around here again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite]] (350x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Did you get rid of those blighted wretches?

==Completion==
Thank you, mainlander. I'm sure Okri can make us some top-notch gear with these.
