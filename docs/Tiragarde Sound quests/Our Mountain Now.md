==Objectives==
Slay 10 Roughnecks in [[Timberfell Outpost]].
*[[Roughnecks|Roughneck]] slain  (10)

==Description==
<name>, go take care of those "roughnecks." They might fashion themselves as tough, but a bit of your unique brand of [[Horde]] savagery should have them running in no time.

[[Lilian]], scout the area. We need to know about any nearby threats.

[[Dark ranger|Rangers]], secure the perimeter. We'll reconvene in the roughneck camp once <name>'s work is done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Me? I'll go where I'm needed.

==Completion==
<Nathanos looks around the camp and nods to himself.>

This will do.

==Notes==
;On accept
''The three [[Dark Ranger (Tiragarde Sound)|Dark Rangers]] and Lilian run toward the outpost.''

Kill [[Roughneck Goon]]s and [[Roughneck Logger]]s.

When the objective is met, the remaining Rouchnecks turn unfriendly and run away as the [[Forsaken]] enter the outpost.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|The town we passed by, [[Bridgeport]], seems to be the largest threat in the area.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Good. They'll be our target, then.}}

==Progression==
{{The First Assault}}
