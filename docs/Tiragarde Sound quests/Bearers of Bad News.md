Quickly, let us make for Boralus!

It seems word of the attack has already reached Boralus.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|We need to get to Boralus. The Lord Admiral must be warned!}}

Interact with Galeheart:
:{{text|say|Taelia|I don't understand... Why would Lady Ashvane hire pirates to attack Daelin's Gate?}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Was it simply a test of her new weapons... or something more?}}
:''Galeheart makes it to Unity Square.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Wait, what's going on down there?}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|This can't be good.}}
