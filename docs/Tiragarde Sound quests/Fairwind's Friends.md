==Objectives==
Rescue [[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]] from the [[Ring of Booty (subzone)|Ring of Booty]].
* Enter the Ring of Booty {{co|74.3|83.5|Tiragarde Sound}}
* Untie Flynn {{co|73.8|83.4|Tiragarde Sound}}
* Survive [[Harlan Sweete|Harlan's]] game

==Description==
Someone must have recognized Flynn and ratted him out! A bunch of [[Irontide Raiders|Irontide]] thugs dragged him off to the Ring of Booty for a "special audience" with Captain Harlan Sweete.

Flynn doesn't like to talk about this, but he used to captain his own crew. With Harlan as his First Mate.

The two had a falling out after a messy job and Flynn lost all taste for freebooting. Just disappeared one day.

Harlan took the nastiest of the crew and formed the Irontide Raiders.

In other words; it's personal.

==Notes==
Head west to the [[Ring of Booty (subzone)|Ring of Booty]]. Upon entry, the pirates within turn hostile and will aggro.
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|That's it, boys! Work him over good.}}
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Things have changed, Flynn. I'm the captain now. And once the Proudmoores are out of the way, we'll be free to plunder all of Kul Tiras!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Nghh... run..}}
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Oh ho ho! Our newest "recruit" has arrived! This'll be fun!}}

Take them out and release Flynn. Alas, Flynn's in no shape to fight, as he immediately falls forward to the ground.

:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Hmm... What to do with a couple of mutinous rats... Why don't we let the dice decide?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Harlan rolls triple swords.}}
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Oooh! Bad luck for you, haha! Carve 'em up!}}

Three pirates spawn in and attack. Take note of the three [[:Azerite]] barrels around the arena. If they take damage they will do a significant amount of damage to the NPCs.

Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Nyah! Fine! Another round!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Harlan rolls two treasures and a compass.}}
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|What?! No, no, no. That's all wrong.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Harlan re-rolls to a cannon and two skulls.}}
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|That's better! Did I mention I don't play fair? Haha!}}

Two more pirates pop out while the cannon targets the player's position with cannon fire. Move out of the area of effect.

Defeat them:
:{{text|bossemote|Harlan dumps out an entire bag of dice, revealing mostly treasures.}}
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Gah! These dice are cursed! Just get in there!}}

Three more pirates, and the cannon. Take them all out:
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Enough! You're too late, anyway! Our attack on [[Daelin's Gate]] has already begun!}}
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|The Proudmoores are done for! And when Lady Ashvane takes the throne, I'll command her fleet!}}
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Ten thousand gold to whoever brings me their heads!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Flynn! Hold on!}}
:''Taelia swoops in on [[Galeheart]], who snags Flynn off the ground in one of her claws. Another gryphon picks up the adventurer.''
:{{text|say|Harlan Sweete|What?! That's not fair! THAT'S NOT FAIR!}}
