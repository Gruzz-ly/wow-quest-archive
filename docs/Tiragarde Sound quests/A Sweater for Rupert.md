==Objectives==
Collect [[Kolta|Kolta's]] materials.
* [[Sturdy Quill]] (2)
* [[Fuzzy Tail]] (4)

==Description==
The nights are cold in this area, and I am worried my poor [[bear|dog]] will freeze to death. I wish to sew [[Rupert (bear)|him]] a sweater, but I have no materials to make one with.

I would pay anyone who brings me a pair of porcupine quills and four raccoon tails.
