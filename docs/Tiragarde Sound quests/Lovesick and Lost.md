==Objectives==
Escort [[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]] to [[Freehold]].

==Description==
Ugh. My head. My HEART.

Feels like a good hangover and a bad breakup put together.

On the bright side, I think I know where we are. And where that ship was headed.

Freehold.

It's a... free town. For, uh... free folk. The only rule is that there are no rules. Lotta guys with peg legs and eye patches and exotic pets. Catch my drift?

There's a trail through the hills that'll take us there. Pretty sure I remember the way...

Let's get moving. Gotta walk off that damn siren's witchery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
Told you I knew how to find it!

==Notes==
Flynn is still on the ground, so talk with him again:
:I'll be honest with you... this isn't my lowest point.
:But it's pretty close.
{{gossip|<Help him up.>}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ugh, still a bit foggy. Just need a little drink to clear my head.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ahh, that hits the spot. Let's get movin'.}}
Keep up with Flynn. He won't go too far ahead, though.
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|<hic> Now, which way was it... left?}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|No, no. It was DEFINITELY right.}}
:''Flynn heads up into the [[Deathmist Hills]], and not the correct direction, left, which would've gone to Freehold.''

Plenty of [[Venomspine Saurolisk]]s will gladly aggro onto the player, and not Flynn, so help clear his path.
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Watch yourself. Some nasty critters out here.}}

Falling behind
*{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Hey, what are you waitin' for?!}}
*{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|*hic* Over here!}}
*{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I, uh... suppose I'll just wait.}}
*{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Hey, it's dangerous out here! <hic> You really should stick with me, you know!}}

Flynn reaches [[Skinner MacGuff]], who offers [[Toxic Community]]:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Blimey, what a hike. Just need another little sip...}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ahh. We're gettin' close. I can feel it.}}

Pick up MacGuff's quest or not, but keep up with Flynn, who stops in front of an idle saurolisk, or nothing if you killed it.
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|<hic> Hey, lizard.}}

He'll loop around the area, making his way back to Skinner MacGuff:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Ah-ha! This looks familiar. We <hic> must be going the right way.}}

At another fork in the road (not the one from earlier):
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Hmmm. We went right last time... so it MUST be left! Think my head's finally clearing up.}}
:''Flynn starts running.''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Here we are. Freehold.}}
:''Flynn takes another swig, then tosses the empty bottle on the ground.''
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|This is a rough town. Just <hic> let me do the talkin'.}}

This concludes the "Castaways and Cutouts" chapter of the [[Tiragarde Sound storyline]]. The quest chain continues with [[Freehold (quest)]].
