==Objectives==
Return to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] on [[the Banshee's Wail]].

==Description==
The majority of our [[warrior]]s survived and we have the [[Alliance]]'s [[:Azerite]] and weapons.

Be proud of yourself, <name>. You fought with honor today.

Go and inform Nathanos of our victory here. The Azerite should reach them shortly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +2000 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Completion==
I've heard of your victory. Well done. The Alliance will be reeling from this defeat.

The Azerite is being prepared as we speak for our next attack. The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]] trusts you will be willing to aid, when the time comes.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|[[Rexxar]]|You did well, Zelling. Until we meet again.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Thomas Zelling]]|Rexxar, wait. Is there... any news from my family? How are they doing?}}
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|Is it wise to dwell on your former life? Are you sure you want to know?}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|I do. More than anything.}}
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|Your family is well. Your wife purchased a small home within [[Arom's Stand]] in [[Drustvar]], and your children are well fed.}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|That's... good. But how? We spent everything we had before my death--I mean, my transformation.}}
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|You asked [[Lilian Voss]] that they be taken care of. She made sure they were.}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|Miss Voss... I will have to thank her. And you as well, Rexxar, for indulging me. It sets my mind at ease knowing they live well.}}
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|It is nothing. Stay safe, Zelling. And remember... this is now enemy territory for you.}}
:''Zelling and Rexxar walk opposite ways. Zelling starts walking, then turns to the Estate and pauses, then turns back and continues walking and despawns.''
