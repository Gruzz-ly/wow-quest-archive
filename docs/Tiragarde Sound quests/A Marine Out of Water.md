==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Awakened Guardian.jpg|Awakened Guardian|I'm not sure what that monstrosity is, but it's bigger than the others that attacked us.}}
Kill the Awakened Guardian.
* [[Awakened Guardian]] slain

==Description==
A giant one of those stone creatures killed quite a few marines while we were trying to evacuate the cave. It didn't chase us too far, but ignoring it outright is too big of a risk.

It needs to fall!

You will also receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Is there something you need?

==Completion==
I heard the falling of stone echo through the cave from here. Nice work.

==Notes==
At the [[Thovas Base-Camp]], pick up [[Chasing the Leader]] and [[The Ruins Fought Back]] and [[A Marine Out of Water]] before heading out.

Shortly after entering the cave of [[Gol Thovas]] proper, find some rather displeased members of the Explorers' League in the middle of an argument:
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|-to fix your mess!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|My mess? MY MESS? I believe YOU were the one to set it off, you insufferable pip-}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|Hyah!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|Ow! That was my shin!}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|You're lucky I can't kick any higher! Don't deny it! You set off the trap!}}

They offer [[I'm a Druid, Not a Priest]] and [[Salvaging a Disaster]].

The [[Awakened Guardian]] is found on the higher point of the cave, where it has trapped [[Officer Redfen]]. Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Officer Redfen|Thank you, <class>. I'll speak with you somewhere safer.}}
