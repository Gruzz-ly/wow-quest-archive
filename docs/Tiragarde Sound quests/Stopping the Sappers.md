==Objectives==
Kill Nebbik Megafuel, collect [[:Azerite]] [[bomb]]s, and bring them to [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] on top of the seagate.
* [[Nebbik Megafuel]] slain
* [[Large Azerite Bomb]] (40)
* Use [[Arcane Teleport Beacon]]

==Description==
The ice should keep the [[Horde]] out while we handle the [[sapper]] teams gathered on the beach.

I'm going to keep those Horde galleons busy. I need you to handle whoever is in charge and bring all the Azerite bombs you find back to me.

Then we'll handle disposing of their weapons.

(Nebbik Megafuel: Kill Nebbik Megafuel.)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to recover the bombs?

==Completion==
The seagates have protected the heart of [[Tiragarde Sound]] for generations. Today is not the day [[Anglepoint Wharf|Anglepoint]] falls.

As for those Azerite bombs... I have an idea.

:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Glad to hear it! What's the status of the weapon emplacements on the battlements?}}
:{{Text|say|Rosaline Madison|We were taking too much fire, so I pulled my people back. But if they could get there quickly, we could lay into those ships with harpoons.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I can help with that, Captain. Hold on!}}
:''Jaina teleports away.''

The Arcane Teleport Beacon teleports the player on the wall where the Outriggers and Taelia's squad are near Jaina who uses Ice Lances at the Azerite shots coming from the Forsaken ships.
