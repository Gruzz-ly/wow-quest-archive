==Objectives==
Rescue [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]]'s Roadside Assistance
* [[The Fizzle|Fizzle]] rescued
* [[Puggi Blasthops]] rescued
* [[Scowler Scampy]] rescued

==Description==
You know, all I wanna do is blow up [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]] and whatever airship he's ridin' in. Of course it ain't gonna be easy!

I need you to go rescue my roadside assistance so they can fix this mech! They're probably in the [[Alliance]] camp near here.

Meanwhile, I'm gonna cook us up a plan. We're gonna give Mekkatorque a real nice surprise!

And by real nice surprise, I mean we're gonna blow him up. Oh, and also his airship.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You get my guys back yet?

==Completion==
These guys work fast, look at this thing, it's almost brand new!

Almost.

==Notes==
Open the [[Prisoner Cage]]s to free the captured goblins:
*{{Text|say|The Fizzle|I'm free! Well, as free as Gallywix's personal insurance mechanic can get.}}
*{{Text|say|Scowler Scampy|Guess workin' for Gallywix is a little better than being captured by these guys. A little.}}
*{{Text|say|Puggi Blasthops|Well, guess I better go fix Gallywix's stuff.}}

==Progression==
{{Mekkatorque's Battle Plans}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.0|note=Added.}}
