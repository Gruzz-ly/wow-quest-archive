==Objectives==
Kill Quartermaster Ssylis in [[Krakenbane Cove]].
* [[Quartermaster Ssylis]] slain
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
Some [[pirate]]s took off with a supply crate that landed further away from this site then intended.

I don't think there was anything valuable in there, but now the pirates know we're here.

The leader was one of those big lizard men. The worker that kills him will get double pay for the week!

(Quartermaster Ssylis: The [[saurok]] is in charge. Not a small threat by any sense of the word.)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (115x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Is there something I can help you with?

==Completion==
Good work! Hopefully that means we'll be losing less supply drops now.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
