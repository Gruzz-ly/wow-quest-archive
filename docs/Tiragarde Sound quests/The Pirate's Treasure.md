==Objectives==
[[File:Lieutenant Elsbeth Wavecutter.png|thumb|upright|[[Lieutenant Elsbeth Wavecutter]].]]
[[File:Xal'atath (Freehold).jpg|thumb|upright|Xal'atath in Freehold.]]
Find the second relic.
* [[Freehold|Pirate's Den]] found
* [[Skeleton Key (quest item)]]
* [[Trident of Deep Ocean (quest item)]]

==Description==
I sense another relic. A trident thought lost to the depths. It calls to me, <name>. Do you hear it too?

Its song takes form. I see a harbor to the east. An ambitious pirate, greedy and proud. Completely unaware of the power hidden within her hoard of gold.

The would-be-captain's hubris will not permit her to simply hand over her prize. I fear she must be taught a rather harsh lesson.

But that is your specialty, is it not?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*22,300 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Is the trident in your possession?

==Completion==
I never doubted you for a moment.

==Notes==
This quest is done in the non-instanced version of Freehold.

:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|What delicious irony that a pirate keeps such a coveted prize... as a trophy.}}

Kill [[Lieutenant Elsbeth Wavecutter]] and loot the [[Skeleton Key (quest item)]], then unlock the [[Ocean Chest]] to loot the [[Trident of Deep Ocean (quest item)]]. Xal'atath appears on the nearby platform. Her dialogue before turning in:
