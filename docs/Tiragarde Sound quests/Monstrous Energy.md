Collect 6 Pulsating Extract from [[Venomscale Slitherer]]s in [[Rockskip Falls]].
* [[Pulsating Extract]] (6)

==Description==
Have you ever heard about [[eel]] juice? I don't know if it's safe for <race>s like you, but [[tortollan]]s love it! It gives us a burst of energy, and puts a spring in the step of even the oldest tortollan.

I saw some eels to the north of the estate when we were traveling. Can you go collect some of their venom for my dad?

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
My dad will be so excited when he sees his favorite drink!

==Completion==
Oh boy oh boy! He's gonna be pumped!

==Progression==
{{The Norwington Estate}}
