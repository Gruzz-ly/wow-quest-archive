==Objectives==
Search for [[Flynn Fairwind]].
* Ask [[Stabby Jane]] about Flynn
* Search the [[Wailing Tideway]] for Flynn {{co|90.0|74.5|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Lugeia]] slain

==Description==
Lookin' for a friend from the wreck, eh?

If he survived he may have wandered up the path to [[Castaway Point|our camp]].

Now if he ain't up there toastin' his buns by the fire, well... lotta poor souls fall victim to the song of the sirens. 

You should check the camp before you go wadin' out into the tideway. Ask our leader, Stabby Jane. She'd know for sure if a new survivor showed up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ugh... Was I... Was I crying?

Let's agree to never speak of this again.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Castaways (Alliance)]] before heading out. Then head up the hill to [[Castaway Point]] and check in with [[Stabby Jane]]:
:I'm Jane. I was a sellsword serving on a merchant vessel before the sirens dragged us in.
:These folks fished me outta the tideway, gave me a nickname, and have been family ever since.
:They may seem a bit odd, but they're good, honest people. For some of them, washing up here was a welcome change from whatever life they endured before. A chance to start over. Others are just trying to survive until they can get back home.
:{{gossip|<Ask if she has seen Flynn.>}}
:{{text|say|Stabby Jane|Haven't seen anyone like that. I'm afraid your friend may have been lost to the siren's call.}}

Don't forget to turn in [[The Castaways (Alliance)]] and pick up more quests: [[My Favorite Things (Alliance)]], [[Silencing the Sisters (Alliance)]], and [[Blood in the Tides (Alliance)]]. There's a flight master too!
