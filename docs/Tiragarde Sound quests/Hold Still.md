==Objectives==
Use the Goat Shears on 6 [[Gentle Goat]]s.
* [[Goat Fur]] (6)
* [[Goat Shears]] (provided)

==Description==
If you want to be a [[Roughnecks|Roughneck]], you're going to have to pass a few... trials. Every one of us has done 'em, so I don't want to hear any whining.

Take these clippers and get me some goat fur. You have to clip 'em while they're alive, because thems the rules. Oh, and cover your bits when you do it, they like to kick.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Got the fur?

==Completion==
You actually did it! Tell me, how did they like it? Any of 'em give you the horns? Hahaha!

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Bears and the Bees]] before heading out. There's also a wanted poster that begins [[WANTED: The Hornet (Alliance)]].

Gentle Goats have several reactions to being shorn:
*Turning hostile and attacking the player
*Running away in fear

Keep an eye out for [[Totes]] the goat, which croaks the [[Goat's Tote]]!

While searching for [[The Hornet]] over on the east end of the weald, look for [["Helpless" Henry]], hiding behind a rock near [[Brawr]]. He offers [[Helping Henry]].

On complete of [[Hold Still]] and [[The Bears and the Bees]]:
