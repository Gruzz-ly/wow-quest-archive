==Objectives==
Capture Greatfeather.
* [[Greatfeather (gryphon)|Greatfeather]] wrangled
* [[Tether Shot]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Rulf]] sent word that you're needed for another job.

A rich house cat is willing to pay top dollar for a male aerie alpha and there is only one that fits the bill, Greatfeather. I gotta head back to camp to help train a particularly wild female, so this is going to be a solo job.

Find Greatfeather and hit him with the Tether Shot. From there, you'll have to wing it.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Navigator's Walkers
|Freebooter Striders
|Outrigger Striders
|Sea Raider's Footguards
|Gryphon Rider's Ring
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Greatfeather isn't just going to walk himself down here.

==Completion==
I can't believe you did it, kid! I knew you'd be Roughneck material!

==Notes==
Greatfeather is patrolling the area just south of the quest giver. Use the [[Tether Shot]] when the gryphon loops back closer to the ledge.

While riding Greatfeather, players have access to three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Pull the Reins|Pull back on the reins, tiring the gryphon by a small amount.|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant. Deals 3% damage.|id=269492|icon=inv_misc_rope_01}}
#{{Abilities|Bronc Buster|Push the gryphon harder, tiring the gryphon by a large amount.|cd=8 sec|notes=Instant. Deals ~10% damage.|id=269491|icon=ability_hunter_beasttaming}}
#{{Abilities|Hold Tight|Grab the gryphon more tightly, strengthening your grip on the beast by 20.|cd=5 sec|notes=Instant|id=269442|icon=inv_misc_desecrated_leatherglove}}

Additionally, the alternate power bar appears - it ranges from 0-100.

The game provides a hint:
:{{text|bossemote|Weaken the gryphon but maintain your grip with {{text|red|[Hold Tight]}}}}

Use '''Bronc Buster''' and '''Hold Tight''' on cooldown, then spam '''Pull the Reins''' while waiting for the other abilities to come off cooldown.

When the gryphon reaches 20% health, it will give up and fly to the [[Roughneck Camp]]:
:{{text|say|Rulf|Ho, ho! Look at what the house cat dragged in! Unbelievable!}}
:{{text|say|Rulf|Quite a catch, my friend. Let's see how he flies. Hyah!}}
:{{text|say|Rulf|I'll get to work on the training. You go see Tagart, he's got more for you.}}
