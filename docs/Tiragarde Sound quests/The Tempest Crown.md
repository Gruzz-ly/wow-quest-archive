==Objectives==
Retrieve the third relic.
* [[Zul'Toa|Toatana's Cave]] found
* [[Toatana]] slain
* Retrieve the [[Tempest Caller (item)]]

==Description==
<[[Xal'atath]] breathes in deeply and smiles.>

My strength grows. I can see it clearly now... the third relic we seek. The crown known as Tempest Caller.

How fitting that after the fall of [[Atal'Gral]], the gluttonous Toatana would be the one to find the artifact. He was always scuttling about the depths, seeking treasures for his collection.

Toatana's greed has left him trapped within a cave he can never leave. The crown awaits us there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*22,300 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite]] (300x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
The crown is far more useful in our hands than in the claws of an oversized bottom-feeder.

==Completion==
Further proof that you and I can achieve great things together, <name>.

So many possibilities...

:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|But enough musing. Make your way to the shores of [[Vol'dun]]. That is where the third prize awaits.}}
