==Objectives==
Mount [[Cooper (horse)|Cooper]] to begin your show and score at least 150 points.
* Mount Cooper
* Score 150 Points

==Description==
It looks like you understand the basics. Now it's time to put everything together.

Head for the ring. Once you hear the starting pistol, you will have one minute to score as high as possible.

[[Gnoll]]s are worth one point. Run 'em through with the harpoon!

If you see a paper zeppelin, bag it with your bolas for fifty points!

Leaping fences gives you style. Style gives you more points when you skewer gnolls or down zeppelins. It's super important, so don't forget to keep jumping fences!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Kul Tiran riding is a true show of mastery and sport!

==Completion==
What a showing!

==Notes==
This is timed, but the timer is fairly generous.

Hop back on Cooper if not already riding, then enter the ring. As before, Cooper has these abilities:
#{{Abilities|Rapid Dash|range=20|Gain a bust of speed for 1 sec. During a Rapid Dash, Harpoon Jab will always land a critical strike.|notes=2.5 sec recharge. Max 2 Charges|id=252847|icon=ability_mount_charger}}
#{{Abilities|Harpoon Jab|range=15|cd=0.5 sec|Jab with your harpoon, striking targets in front of you. During Rapid Dash, Harpoon Jab will always land a critical strike.|notes=Instant.|id=253030|icon=inv_polearm_2h_kultirasquest_b_01}}
#{{Abilities|Bolas|range=40|cd=3 sec|Throw a bolas at the target. Riding over an enemy tangled in bolas will drag the enemy behind you.|id=253494|icon=inv_jewelry_necklace_92}}

Focus on jumping over fences at first, then jab the occasional gnoll, but focus on zeppelins when they appear. Norwington will call out when they are released.
