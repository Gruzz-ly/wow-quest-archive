==Objectives==
Use the [[Tangled Rigging]] to collect the [["Sea Dog" Grog]].

==Description==
I'm out here tryin' to enjoy my break, but I ran outta hooch.

Got some grog hidden in the water just off the dock, stashed in a crate tied up to some of the rigging. 

Do me a favor and fetch it, will ya? Rigging's pretty tangled so you might have to pull in a few lines before you get the right one.

I'd do it myself, but if they see me they're gonna force me back to work unloadin' them new weapons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You get my stash?

==Completion==
Ah, there she is! Good show.

Whaddya say to a toast?
