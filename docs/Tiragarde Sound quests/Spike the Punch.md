==Objectives==
Spike 6 Kegs of Grog.
* [[Keg of Grog (Tiragarde Sound)|Keg of Grog]] spiked (6)

==Description==
Step one in causing a mutiny? Make it seem like leadership is incompetent.

If the [[Captain Rhenik|captain]] wants to sell our [[soul]]s to the [[Ashvane Company|Ashvanes]], we're going to need to get dirty.

I hate to say it... but we've got to muck up the booze.

That'll make the crew angry at the captain before you can even blink.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's a dirty deed, but it's necessary.

==Completion==
That is not what I...

You know what? Sure. That works.

==Notes==
Destroying the kegs will force the nearby pirates to attack you.
