==Description==
The locals and the [[Explorers' League|league]] have been working together tae reclaim relics in this here cave up the hill. But it seems that we've angered the previous residents. I think the marines can keep the expedition safe fer now, but I dinna how long they can keep it up. 

We need yer help before things go south! Find Hilde Firebreaker, the leader of our expedition. She ran back into the cave fer somethin' or another.

==Notes==
At the [[Thovas Base-Camp]], pick up [[Chasing the Leader]] and [[The Ruins Fought Back]] and [[A Marine Out of Water]] before heading out.

Shortly after entering the cave of [[Gol Thovas]] proper, find some rather displeased members of the Explorers' League in the middle of an argument:
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|-to fix your mess!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|My mess? MY MESS? I believe YOU were the one to set it off, you insufferable pip-}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|Hyah!}}
:{{text|say|Birch Tomlin|Ow! That was my shin!}}
:{{text|say|Pendi Cranklefuse|You're lucky I can't kick any higher! Don't deny it! You set off the trap!}}

They offer [[I'm a Druid, Not a Priest]] and [[Salvaging a Disaster]].
