==Objectives==
Find the [[Explorers' League]] members at the [[Thovas Base-Camp]].

==Description==
A few days ago, a band of [[Alliance]] researchers that called themselves the "Explorers' League" took a contingent of Kul Tiran soldiers to the old [[Drust]] ruins down the road.

We haven't really heard from them since, and I'm growing a bit concerned. I can't leave my post, so can you check up on the team?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We might have a wee problem on our hands.

==Progression==
{{Gol Thovas}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
