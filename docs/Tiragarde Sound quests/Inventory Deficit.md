==Objectives==
Collect 5 Reclaimed Axes from dead [[Stormsong Forester|Algerson Lumberjacks]]{{sic}}.
* [[Reclaimed Axe]] (5)

==Description==
My employees say we're under attack. They say our workers are falling to beasts and men made of wood.

I say we're losing precious inventory!

Do you know how many company-issued axes must be getting dropped out there? That's a waste of my hard-earned money!

I'm going to need you to get those back for me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* [[Small Azerite Shard]] (100x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I spend my own money to get these workers the supplies they need and they just go ahead and lose them! How much more generous must I be?

==Completion==
Perhaps the cost of the axes should come out of their paychecks from now on!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Maximizing Resources]] before heading out. Just outside, find [[Benjamin Algerson]] rooted on the dock. He offers [[Time Off Requests]]. Pick it up too.

Defeat [[Timberbough Invader]]s and [[Timberfang Lurker]]s for their masks, "recover" axes from dead [[Stormsong Forester]]s, and free [[Entangled Lumberjack]]s.

Keep an eye out for the rare [[Lumbergrasp Sentinel]] in the area as well!

On return:
:{{text|say|Algerson Lumberjak|Now spiders are attacking in the woods! We can't chop trees when we're being killed, boss!}}
:{{text|say|Maynard Algerson|You're scared of spiders now? Just squish them under your foot!}}
