==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Chartusk.jpg|Chartusk|That beast will pay for taking my daughter's life.}}
Kill Chartusk in [[Foxhollow Woods]].
* [[Chartusk]] slain

==Description==
A year ago I lost my daughter to the largest boar in the forest.

I have tracked him since, trading blows back and forth. But this time...

Let's just say I don't have much time left.

All I wish for is vengeance. Please <class>, avenge us so that my soul can leave this plane and join my daughter, wherever she may be.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Though my lifeblood drains, all I yearn for is vengeance.

==Completion==
<Caleb's body is lifeless, still warm. His wounds claimed him while you were gone.

His face seems content, as though he knew you would finish the job.>

==Notes==
While in the [[Foxhollow Woods]] for [[The Stoat Hunt]], [[An Element of Danger]], and [[Bolas and Birds]], [[Caleb Batharen]] offers this quest.

While heading for Chartusk, keep an eye out for the rare [[Foxhollow Skyterror]].

==Progression==
