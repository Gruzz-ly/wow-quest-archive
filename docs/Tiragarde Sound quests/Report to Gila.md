==Objectives==
Meet up with [[Gila Crosswires]] in [[Boralus]].

I was quite fortunate that [[King Mechagon]] found me worthy! 

I will send my assistant Gila Crosswires ahead to Boralus to gather a new team. Meet up with her and help out as you can.

I will join both of you shortly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Tinkmaster has entrusted me with this task, so let's not mess it up!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Ms. Crosswires, please assemble a team in Boralus. I must send condolences to the families of those we lost.}}

:{{Text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Why are you still here? We have a team to assemble!}}
