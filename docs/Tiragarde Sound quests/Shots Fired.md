==Description==
Horde invaders keep sailing in through the seagate, but we have a nasty surprise for them!

Send 'em to the bottom of the harbor!

For [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]]! For the Lord Admiral!

Use the [[Outrigger Cannon]] to blast the boats. After blasting 10, speak with Jaina:
{{Dialogue|
Taelia and I were able to subdue the Horde on our side of the wharf. I see you've had some success here as well.

{{gossip|We keep shooting them out of the water but they keep coming! Can you stop their boats?}}
