==Objectives==
Speak with 4 [[Proudmoore Guard]]s in [[Unity Square]].
* [[Proudmoore Guard]] rallied (4)

==Description==
With the evidence you've gathered, we can prove that the [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane Company]] was behind the attack.

I would have preferred to do this in private, but I don't think we'll have the luxury. Look around - company men everywhere. 

Priscilla's got something up her sleeve...

Let's get some backup before we go in there and cause a scene.

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Completion==
Alright. It's time.

==Notes==
Run around with Taelia and speak with four Proudmoore Guards in Unity Square:
:Please remain calm. Everything is under control.
