==Objectives==
Collect a Satchel of Seaweed, a Bundle of Vellum, and some Seal Blubber from around [[Anglepoint Wharf]].
* Satchel of Seaweed {{co|41.9|30.3|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Bundle of Vellum]] {{co|43.2|29.7|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Seal Blubber]] {{co|41.8|30.0|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
We have read the tides, and never before have I seen them in such turmoil. They call to the [[tidesages]], begging for help.

A debilitating sickness is running rampant amongst the villagers, and it comes from the sea.

We are but few. There is only so much we can do!

Please, take this list and gather the listed reagents from around the pier while I attempt to calm these folks. I should be able to create a tonic that will help.

I hope.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
My day-to-day job usually just consists of blessing the ships, reading the waters, finding the best spots to fish.

I fear that this may be out of my league.

==Completion==
No seaweed? This will not do at all!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Rosaline Madison]]|Oi! Therod! Enough dallying. We need your blessing to go out for our hunt!}}
:{{text|say|Brother Therold|Rosaline, I'm sorry, but you must wait. We have more pressing matters than hunting on our hands today.}}

All quest items are nearby on the pier:

The Seal Blubber is in a [[Jar of Blubber]] close to a [[Diligent Tidesage]] and [[Hera Copeland]].

[[Hera Copeland]] should have some seaweed, but...
:So much to do, so little time!
:I must bless the fishermen and their equipment, read the tides for omens, pray for the return of our sailors...
{{gossip|Do you have any seaweed? Therold needs it for an antidote.}}
:{{text|say|Hera Copeland|I'm sorry, <class>. We're completely out of seaweed. Everybody has felt too ill to go into the water to harvest. Give Therold my apologies.}}

The [[Bundle of Vellum]] is just east up the hill sitting on a barrel near the building. Pick it up:
:{{text|say|Anglepoint Dockworker|Them Outriggers are so brave! I could never go out and face them monsters! I'm good on cargo duty.}}
