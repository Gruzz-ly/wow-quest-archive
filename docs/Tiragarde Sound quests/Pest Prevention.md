==Objectives==
Destroy 12 Mossfang Eggs.
* [[Mossfang Egg]]s destroyed (12)

==Description==
[[Fernwood Ridge|These woods]] have never been so densely littered with spider eggs.

If these are recent... they must also be corrupted! We cannot allow them to hatch into more of these aggressive spiders.

While you are in the woods, destroy those eggs. Any more spiders could lead to an uncontainable infestation!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
I will admit to not being the biggest fan of spiders. Fewer spiders sounds pretty good to me.

==Completion==
Thanks for that.

I uh... I think you got some spider egg goop on your cloak.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Required Webinar]] and [[Pest Prevention]] and [[Incident Reports]] before heading out.

Start killing [[Enthralled Mossfang]]s and [[Enthralled Ashclaw]]s, freeing Webbed Lumberjacks, and destroying [[Mossfang Egg]]s.
