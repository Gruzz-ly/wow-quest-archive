==Objectives==
Burn 5 Infested Cargo.
* [[Infested Cargo]] burned (5)

==Description==
By the time I realized what was happening, it was too late.

People had been acting strange, but I thought nothing of it. After all, they seemed to still be doing their jobs.

While inspecting some of the cargo, this grub jumped out in an attempt to latch onto my face. I managed to take it out, but it was too late.

All of the shipments are infected. Take this torch. Destroy them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
If I had only noticed sooner, perhaps some of this could be avoided.

==Completion==
All we can do now is try to contain the threat.

==Notes==
While in the [[Anglepoint Packing District]] for [[Possessive Headgear]], [[The Young Lord Stormsong]], [[Betrayal of the Guard]], [[Manager Yerold]] offers this quest and [[Enemy Within]].

Cargo, in the form of barrels, is all over the packing district.

==Progression==
