*[[Loaned S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera]] (provided)

==Description==
While us Fizzbrackets may not be goblins, we still know a business opportunity when we see one! The resort staff is getting trained, the place is getting cleaned up, now all we need is some quality marketing!

<Wulferd holds up a familiar looking box.>

Behold! The wondrous Gnomish engineering feat that is the [[:S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera]]! Now, if only there was a generous <race> willing to capture the radiance of this place.

Make sure you look like you're enjoying yourself out there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Over-Engineered Flash Bulb]]
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
If your smile isn't at least half of the picture, I don't want to see it!

==Completion==
These are perfect, you look dashing! Now I need to figure out how to get these out to our target customers.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Making Mysteries]] before heading out.

While in the area, there's also the bonus objective [[Spring Cleaning]].

To gain quest credit, stand facing the target, turn around, use the quest item, then use the Take Selfie ability:
*{{Abilities|Take Selfie|Takes a picture with your S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera|notes=Instant|id=257754|icon=inv_misc_enggizmos_27}}

Should a target not be in the shot, Wulferd will complain:
:{{text|say|Wulferd Fizzbracket|Remember, I've got a very specific list of things I need you to capture in a shot. If they aren't clearly noticeable, I can't use it.}}

[[Midland Stag]]s and [[Rustfur Wolf|Rustfur Wolves]] are common mobs in the area and should not be hard to find.
[[Unassuming Chicken]]s are all over the quest area, so just interact with them.

The Geyser is just in the middle of the big pond immediately southwest of Wulferd. The geyser must be actively erupting when taking the shot to gain credit.

The waterfall, and the rare turtle [[Tort Jaw]] are east of the resort.

Out and about, keep an eye out for the rare [[Raging Swell]] southwest of the main camp, and rare turtle [[Tort Jaw]] over by the waterfall.

Near the Ruined Robot, find [[Parin Tinklocket]], who offers [[Inspection Gadget]] and [[Reverse Tinkering]].
