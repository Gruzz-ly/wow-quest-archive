==Objectives==
Collect the Captain's Key, Apothecary's Key, and Navigator's Key on [[the Swift Vengeance]], then use them to open the Reinforced Cage.
* [[Captain's Key (quest item)]]
* [[Apothecary's Key]]
* [[Navigator's Key]]
* [[Reinforced Cage (Tiragarde Sound)|Reinforced Cage]] unlocked

==Description==
Three keys? It seems [[Sylvanas]] didn't trust any one member of this crew to have access to [[Derek Proudmoore|Proudmoore]].

We won't be able to rescue Derek Proudmoore if we can't get his [[cage]] open.

We'll need to keep an eye out for keys while we clear the ship.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This will all be for nothing if we can't open that lock...

==Completion==
We've done it!

I was worried I would have to try to bend the cage bars apart.

==Notes==
;After the cage is unlocked
:''Baine kneels and picks up Derek.''
