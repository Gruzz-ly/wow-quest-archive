==Objectives==
Follow the trail of Eddie Norwington.
* [[Hotshot]] found {{co|56.1|17.9|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Bag of Horse Treats]] found {{co|56.2|16.1|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Boneface's "Key"]] {{co|55.7|14.3|Tiragarde Sound}}
* [[Eddie Norwington]] freed {{co|55.6|14.6|Tiragarde Sound}}

==Description==
My life is equestrian. I'm not a fighter. I could maybe take a trogg or two, but not a whole tribe.

Please, go into [[Mistfall Cleft]] and see if you can find Eddie. [[Lord Aldrius Norwington|Lord Norwington]] would be furious if something happened to him, and nobody wants to bear witness to that!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Are... are you here to save me?

==Completion==
You saved me! Those troggs are really scary. They took Hotshot and dragged me through their camp!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Troublesome Troglodytes]] before heading out.

Head in, killing troggs along the way. [[Hotshot]] didn't make it, but there is a [[Recipe Rock]] nearby that offers [[Stone Soup (quest)]], and a captured [[saurolisk]] that offers [[Saurolisk Escape]].

Head up the hill to find the bag of horse treats, then enter the cave and defeat [[Boneface the Giant]], loot [[Boneface's "Key"]], and open the cage holding Eddie.

;Entering the cave
:{{Text|yell|Eddie Norwington|I'm over here! He has the key! Please, help me!}}

Interact with the [[Trogg Cage]] to free Eddie.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Eddie Norwington|Is... Is it safe to get out? Troggs are really scary!}}
:{{text|say|Eddie Norwington|I think I can make it to Melissa if you cleared me a path. Thank you so much for saving me!}}

==Progression==
{{The Norwington Estate}}
