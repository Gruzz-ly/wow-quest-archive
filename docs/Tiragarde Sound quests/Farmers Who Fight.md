==Objectives==
Recruit 6 [[Vigil Hill Farmer]]s into the militia.
*[[Vigil Hill Farmer]] recruited

==Description==
I was hoping for a squad of [[Proudmoore Academy]]'s finest, but I guess you'll have to do.

What we lack in manpower we make up for in courage! Even the [[farmer]]s here won't give up their land without a fight.

Send the bravest of them to me. They will fight better alongside our [[marine]]s than by themselves out in the fields!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
We need anyone willing and able to fight!

==Completion==
We'll get those volunteers paired up with the regulars and give 'em a fighting chance.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Air Raid]] and [[Numbing the Pain]] before heading out.

*They killed my cow!!
*Aye! They'll pay for this!
*I'll help however I can!

==Progression==
{{Defenders of Daelin's Gate}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
