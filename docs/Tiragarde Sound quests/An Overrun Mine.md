==Objectives==
Find [[Chief Miner Theock]] at [[Winterdeep Mining Camp]].

==Description==
It was horrible! I was in the mine nearby, just picking away at a rock and it jumped up and bit me in the neck! Since when can rocks walk around and bite people?

I hightailed it outta there, but some crazy fools are sticking around trying to take the mine back. If you're eager to punch rocks you can find them down the road to the south.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Why aren't you wearing a miner's cap!? It's dangerous out here! Here, put this on.

Now, I got a job for you. Real easy.

==Notes==
On complete, the player gains the Miner's Cap buff. Merely cosmetic.

==Progression==
