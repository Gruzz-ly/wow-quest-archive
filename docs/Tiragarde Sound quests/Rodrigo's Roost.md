==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rodrigo]] in [[Freehold]].
* Letter to Taelia sent

==Description==
We should check in with [[Cyrus Crestfall|Cyrus]] and [[Taelia]] before we get in too deep.

<[[Flynn Fairwind|Flynn]] pens a note on a scrap of parchment and tucks it into a small courier bag.>

This is all of the evidence we've gathered so far linking the [[Ashvane Trading Company]] to the weapons and pirates here in Freehold.

Take it to Rodrigo, on the rooftop just behind this tavern. He raises parrots that make great messengers. Some are even big enough to ride!

Rodrigo's a few planks short of a poop deck, but he's trustworthy!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Talk to Rodrigo and send that evidence off to Taelia.

==Completion==
Alright, now that the boss is updated, let's get back to work.

==Notes==
Rodrigo, the flight master, is just outside. He offers a quest, [[Flew the Coop]], and has a quest interaction:
:You like my pretty birds?
{{gossip|Can you send this letter to Taelia in Boralus?}}
:{{text|say|Rodrigo|Aye-aye! Letter will get there fast! Full speed ahead, pretties!}}
