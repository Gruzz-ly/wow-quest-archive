==Objectives==
Destroy [[Horde]] [[Zeppelin]]s in [[Anglepoint Wharf]].
* Get a [[:Jury-Rigged Hand Cannon]] from [[Okri Putterwrench|Okri]]
* Test the Jury-Rigged Hand Cannon
* [[Horde Bombardier]] slain (4)

==Description==
The Horde zeppelins proved to be problematic for our forces here. I tried to construct something quickly, but while the weapon had power, it didn't have the range necessary to take them out.

The [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lord Admiral]] has provided us with an expedient solution to the problem!

Use this jury-rigged hand cannon on the zeppelins. A quick application of high energy and heat will cause thermal shock and critical failure!

To simplify, blow them up while they're grounded!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If you could take out those Zeppelins before they can thaw and fly out of range, we'd be assured of victory!

==Completion==
Ha! The Horde's air forces aren't so superior now, are they?

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Okri Putterwrench|Success! Ingenuity prevails over brute force!}}
:{{Text|say|Okri Putterwrench|You bring the rest of the frozen zeppelins to an explosive end, <name>. I'm going to join Rosaline and the other Outriggers.}}

Use the extra button on the frozen bombardiers.
