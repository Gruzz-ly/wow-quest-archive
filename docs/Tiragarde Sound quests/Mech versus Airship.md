==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Alright, here we go! We got the fuel, we got the plan, and we got the hands to push the buttons to make it happen!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|We're gonna show Mekkatorque that we ain't so stupid after all. Once his ship's on fire, we'll land on it and send out one of them SOS things.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|He's gonna be flying back, and I bet he'll be all, oh no, I've been outwitted by Gallywix, he destroyed my ship, I better save everyone!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Then when he gets there, we'll tag team him! I'll take him from the mech, you do, uh, whatever is you do outside of it.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|That's the part where you and me blow him up on his burnin' airship. You can't get more dramatic than that!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|I'm so excited, all my chins are shakin'! One thing at a time, let's blow up that ship.}}

;Speaking with Gallywix
{{Dialogue|
Look at all the,{{sic}} the destruction! This is what gold and a taste for the dramatic get ya.

{{Gossip|Sound the fake SOS to lure Mekkatorque here.}}

;Fighting Mekkatorque
:''Mekkatorque lands on the ship. He has the Azerite Weakness debuff.''
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|Gallywix, <name>! I should've destroyed you when I had the chance, you'll pay for this!}}
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|This ship is coming apart... you won't be so lucky next time, Gallywix!}}
:{{Text|say|G.M.O.D|Oh, I ain't lettin' you go, we're finishin' this here and now!}}
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|Hah! Gallywix, my Proto Layered Optimal Titan Armor will keep me safe from any of your pitiful attacks!}}
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|Behold the ultra magnetizer! It'll keep you stuck on this ship and short-circuit your pitiful [[robot]].}}
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|It's been really NOT nice knowing the both of you, have fun in whatever afterlife you go to!}}
:''Mekkatorque flies away.''
:{{Text|say|G.M.O.D|HEY! What the heck kinda cheap.... an indestructible shield AND he disables us?! You ever have this happen to you, <name>?}}
:{{Text|say|G.M.O.D|Destroy that thing of his so I can get us outta here!}}

:''G.M.O.D has the Ultra Magnetized debuff from [[Ultra Magnetizor]].''
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|We almost had him, BAH! Stupid explodin' ship.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|I guess we should look on the bright side. We blew up a ship, killed a bunch of robots, and kept our [[Azerite]] safe!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Heh heh... I never woulda thought this is where things would end up, after I told [[Sylvanas]] about Azerite.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Y'know, every now and then I think, should I have really told Sylvanas about this whole Azerite thing?}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|If ya really think about it, if no one ever found out about the stuff, maybe we never woulda started [[Fourth War|this whole war]].}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Coulda avoided [[Burning of Teldrassil|burnin]]' down [[Teldrassil|that tree]], might still have the [[undead]] [[Undercity|city]]... it really makes ya think, don't it?}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|... HAH! I'm just kiddin'! Of course I don't care about that stuff, I'm flyin' a freakin' mech that shoots lasers made outta the [[Azeroth|planet]]'s blood!}}
