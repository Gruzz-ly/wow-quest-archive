==Objectives==
Kill Brawr.
* [[Brawr]] slain

==Description==
The [[Roughnecks]] told me to clear the rocks in the forest. I didn't know they meant THIS!

You look tough, you have to help me! I'll get killed if I get anywhere near that thing. I'm also super allergic to [[bee]]s...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
That thing sure hates bees...

==Completion==
Thanks so much! I'm off to my next task!

==Notes==
While in the [[Westwind Weald]] for [[The Bears and the Bees]], [[Hold Still]], and [[WANTED: The Hornet (Alliance)]], players may find [["Helpless" Henry]] looking at [[Brawr]], trying to swat the [[Goldcoat Stinger]]s swarming him.
