Meet up with [[Chen Stormstout]] at the entrance of the [[Stormstout Brewery]].

==Description==
Now, onward to the Stormstout Brewery! It's high time that I was reunited with the rest of the Stormstouts... and what better way to reunite than over a few mugs of [["The Emperor"|ale]]?

You know where the brewery is, right? Just follow this road to the west. You can't miss it. Of course, you're free to share the road with us - we'll be leaving any moment now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The door... it's boarded up?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Let's load these barrels into [[Beer Cart|the cart]], shall we?}}
:''Chen tosses barrels like they weigh nothing into the cart ~10 yards away.''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Onward to the Stormstout Brewery!}}
:''Chen steps into the yoke.''
:{{text|yell|Li Li|So long, Halfhill!}}
:''Li Li jumps up onto the top barrel.''
:''Chen starts walking, but quickly stops.''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Mudmug, are you coming?}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Oh, I dunno. This kinda seems like a family thing you're doin'...}}
:''Chen gets out of the yoke and talks to Mudmug.''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|It IS a family thing, Mudmug. And I want you to join us.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|No foolin'?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Of course not! We brewed beer together. That practically makes us brothers.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Y-yeah! Beer brothers!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Ugh! You guys are gonna make me throw up.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Seriously though, Mudmug. Don't be dumb.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Come on, help me pull this cart.}}
:''(It would be best if the player mounts up here.)''
:''The two yoke up and take off at walking speed, across the front of the [[Lazy Turnip]] and toward [[Halfhill Market]].''
:{{text|yell|Li Li|Is this the fastest you can go? Come on, fatsos! Move those legs!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Very well, I will put my belly into it...}}
:''The cart takes off faster than an epic ground mount, at approximately 221% run speed!''

They run to the [[Thirsty Alley]], stopping right in front of the west door of the [[Stormstout Brewery]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Huh! Looks like they're closed.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Yes, strange. This door was not here before.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Y'all think they're hiding' something inside?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|We will find out.}}
:''Chen walks up to the door and starts banging on it.''
:{{text|yell|Chen Stormstout|Stormstouts, open up! I have returned. And I brought beer!}}
:''Li Li turns left, where she spots a giant [[hozen]] walking down the Alley!'' 
:{{text|say|Li Li|Umm... guys...}}
:''Li Li slowly backs up.''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Settle down, Li Li. You know that I hate to be interrupted while I'm knocking on doors.}}
:''Only now does Mudmug notice it too.''
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Chen! It's a giant dang ol' hozen!}}
:{{text|yell|Ook-Ook|Who crashing Ook party!? Ook ook ook...}}
:''Ook-Ook tosses a barrel on to the player.  One fade to black later...''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Hozen attack!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Hold on, I will break you out of those barrels.}}
All three offer quests.
