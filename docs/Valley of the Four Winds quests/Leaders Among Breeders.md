*[[Aiyu the Skillet]] slain {{co|68.4|37.0|Valley of the Four Winds}}

*[[Frenzyhop]] slain {{co|64.6|40.6|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
Before any kegs are tapped, we have work to do. These [[virmen]] are no different than the virmen on the [[Wandering Isle]]... a nuisance that breeds as fast as the rabbits they resemble.

Sure, we could kill every last virmen we find, but what's the point in needless bloodshed? Let's just take out their alphas, and they'll slow down with their... reproduction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Turnip Punching Bag]]
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The virmen here have strange habits.  Stranger names.

==Completion==
<Chen nods.>

Good work, <name>. You're not bad in combat.

What do you say we team up for the next part?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Yellow and Red Make Orange]] before heading out. Head north into the [[Sunsoaked Meadow]] and start killing beasts (not virmen) for blood and loot marigolds off the ground. Further north, on the surface, are the named virmen.
