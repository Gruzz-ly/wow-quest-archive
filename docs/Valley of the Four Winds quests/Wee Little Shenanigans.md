==Objectives==
Kill 8 Tricky Maizers.
*[[Tricky Maizer]] slain (8)

==Description==
So... we bought some cheap grains in bulk. It turned out the grain was infested with [[sprite]]s.

I HATE sprites. With their wee beady eyes and constant smiling.

I would like to resolve this quietly. Can I buy your services to discretely eliminate some of these grain thieves?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 399 necklaces
|Grainlord's Amulet
|Grainlord's Pendant
|Grainlord's Necklace
|Grainlord's Choker
|Grainlord's Locket
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Oh good, they didn't turn you into a frog yet. I saw them do that once you know.

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, stranger! Hopefully we can deal with the rest on our own from here.

==Notes==
[[File:Tricky Maizer.jpg|thumb|[[Tricky Maizer]].]]
Pick up [[Taste Test]] and [[Out of Sprite]] before heading out.

Grain for Taste Test appears in big sacks on the ground. The regular sprites are on grain piles outside. The named is inside the building.
