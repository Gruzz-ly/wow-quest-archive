==Objectives==
Bring the Wayward Lamb to {{NPC||Francis the Shepherd Boy}}.
*[[Wayward Lamb]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm not the only one having trouble with his stock, it seems. One of Francis' sheep has wandered over to my [[ranch]], for the third time this week. I'm beginning to think he needs help tending to his flock.

You should check up on him, neighbor. And bring [[Wayward Lamb|this poor little thing]] with you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
* 12900 XP

==Progress==
Oh... you have one of my... my lambs?

==Completion==
You really shouldn't have brought the lamb back to me. He... he was safer in that pigsty than he is over here.

==Notes==
Head up the hill just to the southeast. Poor Francis is scared out of his mind.

==Progression==
{{Meeting Chen Stormstout}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
