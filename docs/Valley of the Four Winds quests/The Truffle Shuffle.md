==Objectives==
Obtain 8 Shadelight Truffles, and plant 8 Shadelight Spores.
*Shadelight Spore planted (8)
*[[Shadelight Truffle]] (8)
*[[Shadelight Truffle Spores]] (provided)

==Description==
I like to bake with truffles... when I can find them. They only grow up on the [[Skyrange]], and in very, very scarce amounts.

They're a fantastic ingredient, but we can't risk over-farming them. That's why we need to replace what we've taken. Bring me a handful of adult truffles, and plant some of these spores in their place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1|it=1}} and 1 point of Cooking skill
* 236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We won't need many truffles. They're for flavor only, really.

==Completion==
These will do nicely.

Now, <name>... stand closer. Let me show you a thing or two about baking...

==Notes==
Pick up the other daily quests before heading out.

Fly up to the outskirts of the [[Kunzen Village]] on the [[Skyrange]]. [[Shadelight Truffle]]s are orange-capped mushrooms that grow all over the area. Plant [[Shadelight Truffle Spores]] to replace the picked mushrooms. If you find a spot that another player planted all of their spores, you can wait for them to become truffles, while replacing them with your spores for another player.
