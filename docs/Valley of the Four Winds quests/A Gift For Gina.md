==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gina Mudclaw.jpg|Gina Mudclaw|<Sigh...>}}
Obtain a Goldenfire Orchid.
*[[Goldenfire Orchid]]

==Description==
Have you seen [[Gina Mudclaw]], the market girl? She has it all - looks, brains, and nice big tummy. Could you deliver a gift for me?

I wanted to pick some orchids that grow on top of the big hills to the west, but I can't climb that high. Could you pick a few and bring them to Gina?

Oh, and when you see her... tell her I said "hi".

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+1400 [[reputation]] with [[Gina Mudclaw]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Hey there!

==Completion==
These are beautiful! Did you get these for me?

Ahh... so they're from [[Andi]], are they? I think I know somebody who's getting a kiss on the forehead later this afternoon...

("Gina Mudclaw: I think she is very nice and pretty. Don't tell her that I said that!")

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

Note that the orchids do not grow on the [[Skyrange]], but instead on the high hills of the [[Heartland]] where the [[Monstrous Plainshawk]]s circle.
