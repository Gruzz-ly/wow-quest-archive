==Objectives==
Slay 14 Ik'thallik [[mantid]] in [[Stoneplow]].
*[[Ik'thik Swiftclaw]] or [[Ik'thallik Scout|Scout]] slain (14)

==Description==
I'm not from here. I've never even BEEN here before today. But even I can tell you that something's wrong.

[[Serpent's Spine|That wall]] over there was built to keep mantid off of pandaren lands. Now, the mantid are sending their winged scouts over the top, as if the wall wasn't even there!

The only reason those spindly scouts aren't dying is because they're attacking farmers, not soldiers. They wouldn't stand a chance against someone like you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If the flying mantid troops have always been able to fly over, why haven't they before now?

==Completion==
[[Lin Tenderpaw|Lin]] asked you to help us out? Rather presumptive of her.

Still, we are short-manned. We won't turn down your help... or the girl's. You have our thanks, <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Evacuation Orders]] from [[Loon Mai]] before heading out. Plenty of mantid to kill out by the wall.

==Progression==
{{Stoneplow}}
