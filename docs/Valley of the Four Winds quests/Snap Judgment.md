==Objectives==
Kill 16 Razorback Snappers at the [[Pools of Purity]].
*[[Razorback Snapper]] slain (16)

==Description==
These pools are very special: they nurture life like nothing else in Pandaria.

Unfortunately this means they draw all kinds of attention from local fauna. Recently, [[dragon turtle]]s have discovered that toadspawn pools are common on the tier just above us. They're running wild up there, trampling the lotuses and snapping at my workers.

They aren't much of a threat on their own, but in groups they can be pretty nasty. Please, if you can spare your strength, help clear them out.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
<Yue sighs.>

If only we'd kept up with our maintenance, the situation would not have come to this.

==Completion==
You have my gratitude, <name>.

Please take this as a token of my appreciation.

==Notes==
After picking up [[Ashyo's Vision]], [[Bottletoads]], and [[Watery Woes (quest)]], on the way up to the top tier of the pool, adventurers come across Zhang Yue, who offers this quest. Pick it up, as the dragon turtles up top will aggro on the player whether or not they're on this quest. After accepting the quest:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Don't forget to talk to that jinyu, down there by the river.}}

Ashyo is a few yards to the west of Zhang, so do his event, turn in Ashyo's Vision and pick up [[The Golden Dream]] from Yue.

Head up the hill to the top level of the Pools of Purity and pick up the sprig of dreamleaf behind the statue. Up near the dreamleaf, be on the lookout for [[Krosh]], a [[dragon turtle]] with 368,000 health. Kill it to loot [[Krosh's Back]] and start [[Guess Whose Back]]. The bottletoads/snap judgement quests can be completed up here as well. Turn in Snap Judgment on the way down to the lower level for Watery Woes. Kill the cranes and loot the glimmering flies, which are critters. Then turn in at New Cifera.

While out and about in the Gilded Fan, up in the northeast corner near the waterfall is a named [[crocolisk]], [[Manglemaw]]. Kill it to spawn his mother, [[Manglemaw's Mother]]. She drops an [[Enormous Crocolisk Tail]], which starts [[A Crocolisk Tale]].
