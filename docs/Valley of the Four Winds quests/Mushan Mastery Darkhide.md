==Description==
My boy here is a talented hunter... in training. Let's show him an old 'Nessy style hunt shall we?

I saw a mighty big mushan east of here with a hide dark as night. It looked like it had taken down a number of hunters in its day.

If you want a big game hunt, go try an' take it on.
