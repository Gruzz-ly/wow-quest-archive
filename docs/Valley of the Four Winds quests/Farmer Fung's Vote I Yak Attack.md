==Objectives==
Speak to [[Farmer Fung]] at [[Heartland|The Heartland]] or the [[Halfhill Market]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

==Description==
The next voting member on the Tiller's council is Farmer Fung, and it's easy to see why.

That man's vegetables are the biggest in the valley! I only hope that someday I can grow pumpkins as big as his.

If we hope to join the [[Tillers]], he would be the next person to convince.

You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 XP
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]
*+1000 reputation with [[Farmer Fung]]

==Completion==
Oh? You're with that new farmer in town, aren't you?

==Notes==
Fung will either be at Halfhill Market or next to [[Gardener Fran]] up at the [[Heartland]].
