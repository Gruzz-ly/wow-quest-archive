==Objectives==
Kill 12 Cliff Kites.
*[[Cliff Kite]] slain (12)

==Description==
I've identified another high risk target, one that most people would not suspect.

The cliff kites soaring above the hills to the east are quite dangerous.

I have seen them swooping down to the farms, snatching grain and seed when no one is looking.

In order to protect the farms, we must thin their numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|98|50|}}
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+3,750 [[reputation]] with Sho

==Progress==
How goes the mission?

==Completion==
I knew you would carry out the mission without any problems. Well done, <name>.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
