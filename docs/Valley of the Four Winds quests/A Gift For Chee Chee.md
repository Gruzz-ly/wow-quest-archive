==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Chee Chee.jpg|Chee Chee|Mah said hozen have filthy mouths. It looks pretty clean to me...}}
Obtain an Authentic Valley Stir Fry.
*[[Authentic Valley Stir Fry]]

==Description==
That crazy [[Chee Chee]] is actually pretty neat. Mah always said that [[hozen]] were nothing but trouble, but... I guess he's just a better hozen then the rest of them.

We should do something nice for him! Those mountain hozen in the west make some really fancy stir fry, and keep bowls of it inside their little hozen houses.

I bet Chee Chee would love some!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]
*+1400 reputation with [[Chee Chee]]

==Progress==
Mmm?

==Completion==
For me? Me, Chee Chee?

This brings Chee Chee back to when Chee Chee was little wikkin' baby. Chee Chee's mama used to make it just like this.

==Notes==
Pick up the other daily quests before heading out.

Fly up to [[Kunzen Village]] on the [[Skyrange]] to the west of the [[Heartland]]. The stir fry can be found either on the ground or on the corpses of {{NPC||Kunzen Collector}}s.

Wrap up the other daily quests before heading back.
