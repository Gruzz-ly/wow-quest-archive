==Objectives==
Plant 8 Scallion Seeds on [[Sunsong Ranch]].
*Plant [[Scallion Seeds]] x8

==Description==
<Yoon keeps the details of this order short, but detailed.>

Another request has come through for the Horde. The Sunreaver Onslaught, located out on the Isle of Thunder, has requested a bushel of scallions.

Though this Horde and Alliance conflict still gets my fur in a bristle, I won't turn away a hungry stomach.

==Completion==
Well, that's all you can do today! Now to wait for the harvest.

Your crops need only to be tended and prepared for packing tomorrow.

==Notes==
Plant 8 [[Scallion Seeds]]. Consider using a [[Bag of Scallion Seeds]] to plant 4 at a time!
