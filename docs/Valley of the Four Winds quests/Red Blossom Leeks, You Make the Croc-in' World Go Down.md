==Objectives==
Plant a [[Red Blossom Leek]] in [[Sunsong Ranch]]. You can purchase seeds from [[Merchant Greenfield]] in the [[Halfhill Market]].
*Plant [[Red Blossom Leek Seeds]]

==Description==
Grandpa once told me that the smell of leeks will keep [[crocolisk]]s off of your property. He must have had a point... he always grew leeks, and I never saw a crocolisk anywhere NEAR his farm.

We're pretty far from the water... but I suppose you can never be too sure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50|lcgf=1}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Come to think of it, Grandpa didn't live near the water either...

==Completion==
I'd like to see any crocolisks attack my farm now!

Ha HA!

==Notes==
Merely planting the [[Red Blossom Leek Seeds]] is enough to complete the quest.

The quest name is a reference to the {{wplink|Queen_(band)|Queen}} song, {{wplink|Fat Bottomed Girls}} (you make the rockin' world go 'round).
