==Objectives==
Slay 10 Ale-Addled Hozen or Mischievous Virmen.
*[[Ale-Addled Hozen]] or [[Mischievous Virmen]] slain (10)

==Description==
Are you seeing this? [[Virmen]], [[hozen]], and [[Sprite|water sprite]]s... all pouring out of [[Stormstout Brewery|the brewery]] doors and windows! What the heck is going on in there!?

There is another entrance, on the eastern side of the brewery. I'm going to run over there and try to figure out what's going on. In the meantime, see if you can't get rid of these creatures. There's nothing worse than a drunken hozen.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 399 trinkets
|Silkspawn Wing
|Plainshawk Feather
|Lucky "Rabbit's" Foot
|Viseclaw Carapace
|Tawnyhide Antler
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This brewery - it's a disgrace to the Stormstout name! Something needs to be done!

==Completion==
I've had just about enough of this brewery. I'm starting to think that you and I should just bust down the wall and clean house.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|See you on the other side, <name>.}}
*{{text|yell|Chen Stormstout|Mudmug, Li Li... follow me!}}
*{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I'd better catch up to Mudmug... he might not know where the brewery's rear entrance is.}}
*{{text|yell|Chen Stormstout|Li Li, wait up! I didn't tell you where the brewery's rear entrance is!}}
*{{text|yell|Chen Stormstout|Li Li, Mudmug, wait up!}}
:''Chen takes off.''
Pick up [[The Fanciest Water]] and [[Barrels, Man]] before taking off.

Ook-Ook, a level 89-elite hozen with 32.7 million health is running up and down the path, but will only throw barrels at players and not mash them in to a fine paste. Click on the bonus action button to escape from the barrel once Ook-Ook has passed.

Plenty of hostile hozen and virmen, neutral water sprites, and barreled pandaren in the area.
