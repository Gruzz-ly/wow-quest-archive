==Objectives==
[[File:Spideroot.jpg|thumb|Spideroot]]
[[File:Spider Mite.jpg|thumb|[[Spider Mite]].]]
Gather 6 Spideroot for [[Gai Lan]].
*[[Spideroot]] (6)

==Description==
So you need to whack some wily weeds?

No problem, neighbor! Only thing is, I'm running low on weed killer.

I make my own concoction - very potent, totally organic and good for the earth. Plants love it! Well... except for those pesky weeds. They hate the stuff!

If you bring me some Spideroot from the terraces just west of us, I'll make a fresh batch and go down to Yoon's farm myself.

I would gather some myself but... well... I hate spiders. You'll see what I mean.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
How did the root gathering go?

==Completion==
Well what do we have here? You harvested enough to last me a while.

Many thanks!

Head immediately up the hill just to the west. Spideroot can be found all over the terraces. Loot one to spawn five [[Spider Mite]]s, weak level 90 spiders with 39,394 health.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Gai Lan|You go on ahead. I'll gather my tools and meet you at [[Sunsong Ranch]].}}
Gai Lan buffs the adventurer with "Growing the Farm: Gai Lan is currently upgrading Sunsong Ranch." It lasts fifteen minutes, and while the buff is active, Gai Lan can be seen at Sunsong Ranch spraying weedkiller on the second plot of farmland. Also, Yoon sends a letter via the in-game mail system:
{{book|A Letter From Farmer Yoon|content=Hey <name>!

You've been getting on so well at the farm that I wanted to tell you some good news.

If you haven't stopped by the farm recently, you should pay me a visit. I think we're ready to finally clear those weeds from my field.

I also picked up these seeds at [[Halfhill Market]]. I hope you like them!

Farmer Yoon}}
Attached is a [[Basic Seed Pack]], which has four seeds.

Once the buff expires, run by [[Gina Mudclaw]] and purchase the [["Jinyu Princess" Irrigation System]], which starts the next quest.
