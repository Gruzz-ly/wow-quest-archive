==Objectives==
Talk to [[Grandmaster Jakkus]] to complete the scenario [[Finding the Secret Ingredient]].
* Ask Grandmaster Jakkus to tell you his story
* Find the Secret Ingredient

==Description==
Ah, being here again makes me hungry. Have I ever told you about the time I learned to cook from [[Sungshin Ironpaw]]?

Perhaps you can experience it for yourself. Say the word and I will take you to a version of this timeline where you--yes YOU--ran your own noodle stand!

It all began with the [[Lin Tenderpaw|Lin]] family's secret recipe...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|48}}
* 6,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Mmm, noodles...

==Completion==
So you see <name>, the secret ingredient wasn't in the food at all--it was the service that made those noodles special.

Let me know when you want to talk noodles again.

==Notes==
Speak to Grandmaster Jakkus:
{{Dialogue|
Are you ready to hear the story of the secret ingredient of the Lin family noodle soup?
