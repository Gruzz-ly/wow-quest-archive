== Objectives ==
[[File:Manglemaw's Mother.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Manglemaw's Mother}}]]
Bring the Enormous Crocolisk Tail to {{NPC||Yan}} at [[New Cifera]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].
*[[Enormous Crocolisk Tail (2)]] (provided)

== Description ==
How could this [[crocolisk]] have grown so large?

Certainly, rumors exist of very old crocolisks that have grown to enormous sizes... but this female can't be more than a dozen years old.

Perhaps someone in New Cifera can shed some light on the subject.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|10|20}}

== Progress ==
What's that you've got there?

== Completion ==
This tail came from a crocolisk? Funny, we don't get many crocs this far upstream.

Have you seen some of the enormous fruits and vegetables that our farmers can grow? Your crocolisk grew so large for the same reason - there's something in the water.

What it is, we're not quite sure... but we count it among our blessings. Humongous vegetables are great. The odd giant crocolisk every now and again is really just a side effect.

== Gains ==
* 129000 XP

== Notes ==
While in the [[Gilded Fan]] for [[Watery Woes (quest)]] or [[The Great Water Hunt]], head to the northeast corner to find a neutral {{NPC||Manglemaw}} playing with the corpse of a [[Glade Hunter]]. Kill him, and {{NPC||Manglemaw's Mother}} appears out of the water.
:{{text|emote|Manglemaw lets out a pitiful wail.}}
:{{text|yell|Li Li|Holy smokes, it had a mom. Look out, <name>!}}

Kill her, and she drops an [[Enormous Crocolisk Tail]], which starts this quest.
On complete:
:{{text|say|Yan|I suppose I'll just add this to the stew. We're short on meat anyways.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Sounds good to me! And maybe next time you could warn us about the GIANT MURDEROUS CROCODILE.}}
