==Objectives==
Use the Rusty Watering Can to water 2 Parched EZ-Gro Green Cabbages at [[Sunsong Ranch]].
*Parched EZ-Gro Green Cabbage watered (2)
*[[Rusty Watering Can]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Old Yoon|My grandfather]] used to say "[[Farmer Yoon|Yoonie]], a cabbage is like a woman: ignore her and she'll turn rotten. Pamper her and she'll grow big and plump and you can put a ribbon on her and take her to market to show her off to your frie-" look, he was from a different time, okay?

The point is, now that our cabbages have sprouted, they need attention! Today they look a little dry, so you should water them.

Here's the old watering can grandpa left. It will always be near the field if you need it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 112900 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Come to think of it, grandpa said a lot of really offensive things.

Maybe I should avoid quoting him from now on...

==Completion==
Great, the cabbages are tended and looking good!

Today they were thirsty, but you never know what they might need. Pay close attention to your crops and tend them accordingly.

I got all kinds of advice from my grandpa, so if you're ever unsure of how to take care of something, feel free to ask!

Just make sure it's strictly related to farming...

==Notes==
Once the cabbages are watered:
:{{text|say|Hey <name>, didya know that all kinds of things can happen to your plants? If you don't know how to deal with something, just ask me!}}
Walk back over to the planted seeds and use the watering can on them.  When you're done, you can simply throw it away from your bags and it will respawn from where you picked it up.
