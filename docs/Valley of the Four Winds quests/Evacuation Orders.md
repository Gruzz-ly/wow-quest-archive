==Description==
A few farmers remain in [[Stoneplow Fields|the fields]]... some perilously close to [[Serpent's Spine|the crumbling wall]]. I don't want any farmers pretending to be heroes. We will take care of this [[mantid]] swarm, and then they can return to their homes.

My [[Shado-Pan]] are too busy defending this town to organize evacuations. You want to prove yourself useful? Get those farmers out of harm's way.

==Progress==
Once these mantid are slain, we can get to work repairing the wall and restoring the town to its normal state.

==Completion==
A few stubborn ranchers want to make my job harder?

<The Watch Commander sighs.>

Fine. I will rob no pandaren of his right to defend his land.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stemming the Swarm]] from [[Lin Tenderpaw]] before heading out.

[[Haiyun Greentill]]:
:Stay back!
:Wait... you're not one of them. We're not accustomed to outsiders, and with the mantid breaking through the wall, I...
:Anyhow, what can we do to help you?
:{{gossip|Loon Mai has issued evacuation orders.}}
:{{text|say|Haiyun Greentill|I see. I'd hoped that we could wait out this invasion, but if the authorities want us to leave, we will leave.}}
:{{text|say|Haiyun Greentill|Ying, Huizhong... gather your things. We're leaving the farm until it's safe.}}
:{{text|say|Ying Greentill|Oh, honey...}}
:{{text|say|Huizhong Greentill|Daddy, is this nice person going to kill all the bad mantid soldiers?}}
:{{text|say|Haiyun Greentill|I don't know, dear.}}
:{{text|say|Haiyun Greentill|Are you?}}

[[Zhang Marlfur]]:
:How can I help you, <class>?
:{{gossip|Loon Mai has issued evacuation orders.}}
:{{text|emote|Zhang Marlfur sighs.}}
:{{text|say|Zhang Marlfur|I am a farmer, <class>. It's all I know.}}
:{{text|say|Zhang Marlfur|All we have is our land. And that commander wants us to give it up to the mantid?}}
:{{text|say|Zhang Marlfur|I will not do it. My grandfather knew what he was getting into when he first planted seed in the shadow of the Serpent's Spine.}}
:{{text|say|Zhang Marlfur|I have my wife, two strong daughters, and two strong sons. Thank you, but we can protect this farm ourselves.}}

[[Feng Spadepaw]]:
:What, another one? Did Commander Mai send you?
:How many times do I have to tell that bonehead - we're not evacuating!
:{{gossip|Yes, Commander Mai sent me, and I carry his evacuation orders.}}
:{{text|say|Shu-Li Spadepaw|Pshh... outsiders. You know nothing about the Stoneplow way.}}
:{{text|say|Shu-Li Spadepaw|We're proud. We're strong. We are descended from the blood of the Tiller himself... and we don't run from trouble.}}
:{{text|say|Feng Spadepaw|That's right. Now please, <race>, leave and let us defend our property.}}

[[Wei Blacksoil]] can be found immediately next to the wall:
:Yes?
:{{gossip|Loon Mai has issued evacuation orders.}}
:{{text|say|Wei Blacksoil|Oh, I don't know. I am old, and I have always...}}
:{{text|yell|Wei Blacksoil|Look out! Mantid!}}
:''A level 87 It'thalik Ambusher attacks!''
:{{text|say|Wei Blacksoil|I've reconsidered... it's too dangerous to stay here. No piece of land is worth losing your life over. Let me see those evacuation orders.}}

Speak to him again.
:Do you have those evacuation papers?
:{{gossip|Yes, they're right here. Let's go.}}
:{{text|say|Wei Blacksoil|I feared that this day would come. I will pack up my things.}}

Finish killing mantid and return to Loon Mai.
