==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Nana Mudclaw}} at [[Halfhill]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

==Description==
The next vote we'll need is from Nana Mudclaw. She's Haohan's grandmother, and she's been a Tiller longer than you and I have been alive!

She's still working at the Tillers building in Halfhill. Why don't you pay her a visit?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Completion==
Yes, Nana Mudclaw... that is me. I may be old, dear, but I haven't lost my memory. [[Old Man Whitewhiskers]], on the other hand, is another story.

==Notes==
Up to the center of Halfhill on the high hill.

==Progression==
{{Yoon's Farm}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
