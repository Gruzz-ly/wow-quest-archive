==Objectives==
Plant a [[White Turnip]] in [[Sunsong Ranch]]. You can purchase seeds from [[Merchant Greenfield]] in the [[Halfhill Market]].
*Plant [[White Turnip Seeds]]

==Description==
Grandpa often told me to "Keep my drawers clean and my dirt cleaner." It sounds like a joke, but he makes a good point.

Vegetables tend to leave behind bits of root that can contaminate your soil... but a nice, big, white turnip will clean that gunk right up. Think you could plant a white turnip for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50|lcgf=1}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Now keepin' your drawers clean, that's more of a personal thing.  Grandpa made a good point there, too.

==Completion==
Look at that dirt.  Practically sparkling.

Grandpa would be proud.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.
