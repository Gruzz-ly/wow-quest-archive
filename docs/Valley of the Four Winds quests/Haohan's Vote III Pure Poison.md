All right, <name>. This is our big chance!

Mr. Mudclaw's farm is in big trouble. Those mountain hozen are coming down at night, wrecking his crops and eating his hard-earned harvest.

We've got to get rid of them for good, and I know just how to do it.

Back in the day, my grandpa showed me how to mix a wounding poison to deal with the pests on the farm.

The virmen warrens to the north hold the key ingredients for my mixture.

Don't look so worried, <name>! I'm pretty sure this is going to work.

==Completion==
You got the ingredients? Good work!

Now I just need to make the concoction.
