==Description==
AAAIIIIEEUUGGHHHH!!!! This is the last straw!

Those stupid hozen on the mountain killed my [[Sheepie|SHEEPIE]]!

I know exactly who did this, and it is time for REVENGE.

If you are willing to help me, take this old sheepskin.

Use it to disguise yourself anywhere on the mountain to the north, wait for that little dooker Krungko to come out of hiding, and then break his bones!

*+3,750 [[reputation]] with [[Chee Chee]]

==Progress==
How did it go?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. It will not bring my Sheepie back, but at least this way, no more sheep will be lost.
