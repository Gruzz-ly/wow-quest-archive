*[[Stolen Sack of Hops]] (6)

==Description==
You and that [[Chen Stormstout|Chen]] fellow are good people, helpin' out with the [[virmen]] like you are. I don't like to ask for favors, but I ain't gonna turn 'em away, either.

While you're out there puttin' the hurt to those rabbit-men, you wouldn't mind keepin' an eye out for some bags o' hops, would ya? I'm pretty sure they lifted 'em last night.

Probably usin' em for pillows, knowin' how they are.

*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I done told those virmen to stay off my land.

==Completion==
Aww, thank ya kindly, <sir/ma'am>. You're a real gentleman.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Warren-Mother]] and [[Crouching Carrot, Hidden Turnip]] before heading out. Head down into one of the holes in the field to enter the [[Twisted Warren]]. Toss "carrots" to virmen and loot oats off the ground. In the middle of the warren at the bottom is Chufa, a level 86 elite virmen with 921k health.
