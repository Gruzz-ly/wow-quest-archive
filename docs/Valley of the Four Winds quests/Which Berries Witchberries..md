==Objectives==
Plant [[Witchberries]] in [[Sunsong Ranch]]. You can purchase seeds from [[Merchant Greenfield]] in the [[Halfhill Market]].
*Plant [[Witchberry Seeds]]

==Description==
That young'un over there, [[Andi]], is going to grow up to be a heck of a farmer some day.  I can tell just by lookin' at him.

I think I'll plant him some witchberries.  Kids love witchberries - it'll be a nice surprise.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50|lcgf=1}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
The trick to a good witchberry crop is to wait until they're nice and sweet.

It's not as easy as it sounds.  I remember when I was a just a{{sic}} cub, puckerin' on some not-even-half-ripe witchberries because I couldn't wait like Grandpa told me to.

==Completion==
Alright, witchberries!  I can't wait!

But I'm gonna have to.

==Notes==
Merely planting the [[Witchberry Seeds]] is enough to complete the quest.
