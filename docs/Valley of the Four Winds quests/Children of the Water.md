== Objectives ==
Slay Kracor, Thundergill, and Succula.
*[[Kracor]] slain
*[[Thundergill]] slain
*[[Succula]] slain

== Description ==
We are all children of the water here in the Valley of the Four Winds. It nourishes us, it grows our vegetables, it brings us life.

Some creatures, however, drink too deeply from the water. They grow too large, and must be eliminated before they cause havoc to those around them.

I am but a simple stonecarver. You, on the other hand...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|10|20}}

<!--== Progress ==
Bugged, showing no text as of 5.2.-->
== Completion ==
Let this be a lesson to you: don't drink too much of the water.

Why do you think we have such a big brewery?

== Notes ==
The three targets are found in the [[Gilded Fan]].
*Kracor is on a rock in the center {{co|55.8|33.9|Valley of the Four Winds}}. She can heal and send to sleep.
*Thundergill is underwater to the north of Kracor {{co|55.2|25.1|Valley of the Four Winds}}.
*Succula is in the narrow passage west of Thundergill {{co|51.5|27.1|Valley of the Four Winds}}. She is stealthed next to a dead [[Glade Hunter]].

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
