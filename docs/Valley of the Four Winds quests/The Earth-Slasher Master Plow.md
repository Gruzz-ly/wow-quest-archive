==Objectives==
Bring the "Earth-Slasher" Master Plow to Farmer Yoon at Sunsong Ranch.

==Description==
<The box art depicts a pandaren farmer of impossible physique standing proudly astride a widening rift in the earth, a mighty plow in his grasp. Cubs wrestle playfully on his shoulders and dangle from his muscular arms.

At his side, a stoic female - of equally impossible physique - balances a massive, overflowing cornucopia gracefully on her head while kicking a [[virmen]] in the face.>

"The Earth-Slash. Master the land. Master your life."

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
An Earth-Slasher master plow! I... I never thought I'd get to use one of these. Do you have any idea how much time this will save us?!

I heard if you push the Earth-Slasher through twenty yards of solid rock, you end up with a sandbox and a citation from the [[Shado-Pan]] for causing an earthquake scare!

This is going to be AWESOME.
