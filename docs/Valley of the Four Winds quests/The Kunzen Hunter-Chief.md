==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Maakah.jpg|Kunzen Hunter-Chief|Kunzen Hunter-Chiefs, while brave, will regularly fall off the edge of the [[Skyrange]].}}
Slay the [[#Notes|Kunzen Hunter-Chief]].
*Kunzen Hunter-Chief slain {{co|30.3|46.5|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
From what I've gathered, the Kunzen hozen have two chiefs. One is harmless - he deals with potions, medicines, and ancient fables. The other one is in charge of the Kunzen's hunters - and the only thing they've been hunting lately is our crops.

The Hunter-Chief is a problem waiting to be solved. I'm sure the local farmers would be grateful if you went up there and, you know, "took care" of him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+275 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Mm-hmm.

==Completion==
No doubt the hozen will have a big ritual tonight, promoting a new Hunter-Chief.

I'm just happy that my fellow farmers can rest easy in the meantime.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

There are several mobs that count for this quest. One from a pool of five ([[Jim-Jim]], [[Jokka-Jokka]], [[Kon-Kon]], [[Maaka (hozen)|Maaka]], and [[Teeku]]) will always spawn at the same spot at {{coords|30.3|46.5|Valley of the Four Winds}} south of [[Kunzen Village]] on the [[Skyrange]].
