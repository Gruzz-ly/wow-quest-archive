==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Buk-Buk.jpg|Kunzen-Legend Chief|I don't know what his name will be - they regularly elect new legend-chiefs.}}
Obtain a Kunzen Legend-Book from a Kunzen Legend-Chief.
*[[Kunzen Legend-Book]] {{co|31.5|28.7|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
I've heard people talk about the [[hozen]] like they're just some tribe of barely-functional idiots... but that's not true! They have brains, too - they just don't all like to use them that much.

I've heard that the Kunzen tribe has two chiefs - one in charge of fighting, and one in charge of stories, lore, and history.

What I wouldn't give to see what kind of stories they tell...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+2000 [[reputation]] with [[Fish Fellreed]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
I'll bet hozen legends aren't that much different than our own.

==Completion==
Wow! Look at this! It's...

<Fish flips through the pages, and her face sours.>

Oh, I think that's a dirty picture. But the rest of this is very interesting! I just love learning how other creatures think. Thanks, <name>!

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

Fly up to [[Kunzen Village]]. There, at {{co|31.5|28.7|Valley of the Four Winds}}, is a Kunzen Legend-Chief, any one of which will spawn from a pool of: [[Bimba]], [[Buk-Buk]], [[Lor-Lor]], [[Rit-Rit]], or [[Yammo]].
