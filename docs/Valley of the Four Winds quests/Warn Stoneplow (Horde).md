== Objectives ==
Travel to [[Stoneplow|Stoneplow Village]] in [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

== Description ==
So much death. And more to come, if {{NPC||Ambassador Han||Ambassador Han's}} stories of the [[mantid]] are to be believed.

We must help. We must do our part to save lives.

Travel to Stoneplow. Warn them of the coming mantid attack.

I will join you with what forces I can muster once I have laid Kor's body to rest.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
* 12900 XP

==Completion==
Mantid from the south? This is not a good day. 

==Notes==
Either take the flight path, or head west to reach [[Dustback Gorge]] then turn north to travel past [[Nesingwary's Safari]] and through the [[Stoneplow Fields]] to reach [[Stoneplow]]. Speak with [[Loon Mai]], near the village's eastern end (in front of the [[Stone Mug Tavern]]) to turn in.

This completes the [[Kang Bramblestaff]] portion of [[The Search for the Hidden Master]]. If players have not completed all of the other portions (ending with [[The Golden Dream]], and [[Training and Discipline]]), Loon Mai will say:
:{{text|say|Watch Commander Loon Mai|You have been an asset to Stoneplow, <name>. We may call upon you again in the future. Until then, you should speak with our flight master. He will take you wherever you need to go... free of charge.}}

Feel free to take a flight elsewhere and finish whatever quests need to be done.
