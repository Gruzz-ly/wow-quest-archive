{{shortcut|vfwquest}}
[[File:VZ-Valley of the Four Winds.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Valley of the Four Winds]] storyline''' takes place upon the conclusion of the [[Jade Forest storyline]] and runs in parallel to the [[Krasarang Wilds storyline]] during the [[Mists of Pandaria campaign]]. Players land just outside [[Pang's Stead]], where {{NPC||Chen Stormstout}} has stopped for a rest. The main storyline follows Chen and his travelling companions, {{NPC||Li Li}} and {{NPC||Mudmug}}, all over the valley to discover the [[Stormstout Brewery]]. Once the initial cleaning of the brewery is complete, players are sent to [[Stoneplow]] on the west side of the zone in the shadow of the great wall.

To advance the storyline from there, players should complete all of the [[The Search for the Hidden Master]]-started storylines to see what happens to Stoneplow. After saving Stoneplow (or as soon as adventurers reach level 87), {{NPC||Messenger Grummle}}s at [[Stoneplow]], [[Halfhill]] and the [[Grassy Cline]] bring news from {{NPC||Lorewalker Cho}} in the form of [[The Road to Kun-Lai]], who requests the adventurer's presence atop the [[Kun-Lai Summit]], starting the [[Kun-Lai Summit storyline]].

The progression of the storyline in this zone is tracked in the achievement [[Rally the Valley]].

After flying in from the Jade Forest, players land at a small pagoda just on the Valley-side of the border. Out of nowhere, {{NPC||Chen Stormstout}} is waiting on the road along with his niece, {{NPC||Li Li}}. This first series of quests sends players all over the [[Thunderfoot Fields]].

After relating his story of being chased off from the [[Stormstout Brewery]] in [[Broken Dreams]], Chen finds the resolve to make the best brew Azeroth has ever seen. After making the trek to [[Halfhill]], the center of commerce in the valley, Chen sends his traveling companions out on a quest for ingredients. This three-pronged quest sends players up to the [[Gilded Fan]] for water, through the [[Heartland]] for oats, and down to the [[Imperial Granary]] for barley. Ingredients acquired, Chen takes a great deal of time to create "The Emperor", and immediately sets back off to the Stormstout Brewery.

==Stormstout Brewery==

At the Stormstout Brewery, the front door has been barred, and {{NPC||Ook-Ook}} surprises everybody with an attack! The party recovers from the ambush and enters the brewery to start the cleanup process. Back outside, a message from [[Stoneplow]] has arrived...

{{Knocking on the Door}}

This ends the main storyline of the valley. However, near the beginning of the zone, back at [[Pang's Stead]], a series of side-quests opened up in search of the Hidden Master. That story continues with the trek to Stoneplow on  {{NPC||Lin Tenderpaw||Lin Tenderpaw's}} quarter of the story in [[Stoneplow Thirsts]] and [[Lin Tenderpaw (quest)]].

==The Hidden Master==

Early in Chen's storyline, this quest chain opens up. After witnessing the conversation at [[Pang's Stead]] between {{NPC||Xiao}} and his traveling companions, the party heads in different directions and Xiao sends adventurers after them. Two of the four quest forks occur in the valley, but the other half comprise the [[Krasarang Wilds storyline]].

{{Finding the Hidden Master}}

===Clever Ashyo===

On [[Li Li's Day Off]], which is offered shortly before Chen's party reaches [[Halfhill]], {{NPC||Li Li}} asks to look at [[New Cifera]] and the [[Pools of Purity]]. {{NPC||Clever Ashyo}} has found himself at New Cifera as well, where a few other locals offer quests. The two drop-started quests in the valley occur in this area as well.

{{Pools of Purity}}

===Lin Tenderpaw===

After completing the main [[Stormstout Brewery]] story, a message from [[Stoneplow]] arrives. After reaching Stoneplow, adventurers run in to {{NPC||Lin Tenderpaw}}, alarmed at the sight of the [[mantid]] invading from the [[Dread Wastes]]. After fending off the initial invasion, the leader of the town watch lets Lin in on the secret that the Hidden Master, {{NPC||Master Bruised Paw}}, is up at the [[Paoquan Hollow]].

===Ken-Ken and Kang Bramblestaff===

{{Main|Krasarang Wilds storyline}}

Assuming players stayed in the valley and have not completed [[Krasarang Wilds]] yet, upon conclusion of [[Training and Discipline]], the flight master offers to send adventurers to the location of {{NPC||Ken-Ken}} or {{NPC||Kang Bramblestaff}}. Choose to go to Ken-Ken's location at [[Zhu's Watch]] in the northeast corner of [[Krasarang Wilds]] to complete the [[Krasarang Wilds storyline]].

After shoring up the [[Zhu Province]], players will cross paths with Kang at either faction's first camp (the [[Incursion]] or [[Thunder Cleft]]) on the way to the [[Temple of the Red Crane]]. When adventurers are directed to travel to their faction's second camp ([[Sentinel Basecamp]] or [[Dawnchaser Retreat]]), they will pass {{NPC||Koro Mistwalker}} just north of the temple. Save some survivors and cleanse the [[sha]] invasion focused on {{NPC||Chi-Ji}}. Grateful, Chi-Ji offers some rewards, but don't forget about the other half of the storyline.

At the second faction camp, help push back the [[mogu]] out of the west side of the zone. While rescuing prisoners of the mogu, pandaren from Stoneplow tell the story of a [[mantid]] attack on their convoy to the crane temple, and that more are on the way to attack Stoneplow itself! Once the leader of the mogu invasion force, {{NPC||Groundbreaker Brojai}}, has been taken care of, players will be sent forward to Stoneplow during [[Warn Stoneplow]] at the conclusion of the story.

===Saving Stoneplow===

After finishing all of the valley and wilds storylines up to this point, a cutscene will play when the last Hidden Master quest is turned in to {{NPC||Loon Mai}} at [[Stoneplow]]. On the other side of the cutscene, the [[mantid]] have started pushing harder into Stoneplow as the {{NPC||Mantid Colossus}} blots out the sky just on the other side of the wall. Nearly all of the major players in the valley, along with {{NPC||Mei Barrelbottom}} from Zhu's Watch, have made it to Stoneplow to defend pandaren territory.

Complething this quest chain awards the achievement [[Savior of Stoneplow]].
