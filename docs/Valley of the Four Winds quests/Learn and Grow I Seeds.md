==Objectives==
Speak with [[Merchant Greenfield]] at [[Halfhill Market]] and acquire a Packet of Green Cabbage Seeds.
*[[Packet of Green Cabbage Seeds]] {{co|52.9|52.1|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
Well, first things first! I'm going to need lots of help 'round here.

If we're going to be partners, you've got to learn how to harvest crops, and if you wanna harvest crops you gotta plant seeds!

Now it's my understanding that a mister, uh... Grainfell? No, that wasn't it... Greedfill? That doesn't sound right...

Greenfield! That's his name! He's the man to see for seeds.

Greenfield's got a stall over at Halfhill Market, directly southeast of here - go see him and pick up some vegetable seeds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*112900 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
How'd it go, partner? Did you get those seeds from Groanfur?

Err... Greenfield?

==Completion==
He waved at me! And he gave you the first pack of seeds for free?

Well, what a nice guy!

You're doing a great job so far. Here's a little... seed money. Hah!

==Notes==
Head just southwest to the [[Halfhill Market]]. Greenfield is on the southwest side of the market, between [[Anthea Ironpaw]] and [[Merchant Cheng]]:
:My seeds grow the best veggies in the valley.  Guaranteed!

:{{gossip|''I'm here to pick up seeds for [[Farmer Yoon]].''}}

:Yoon, eh? Never heard of him...

:{{gossip|''He just inherited [[Sunsong Ranch]].  You can literally see him from where you are standing.''}}

:Ohh, of course!  The Sunsong place, just over yonder.  Was wondering who might be movin' in on that.

:<Greenfield squints over your shoulder and waves at Yoon.>

:When you come back to market with the biggest, juciest vegetables anyone's ever seen, you tell 'em where you got the seeds!

:{{text|say|Merchant Greenfield|First packet of seeds is on the house!  Come back to me anytime you want to buy more seeds, ya hear?}}

Head back to Yoon.
