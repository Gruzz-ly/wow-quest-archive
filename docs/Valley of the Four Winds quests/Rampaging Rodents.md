==Objectives==
[[File:Plump Marmot.jpg|thumb|[[Plump Marmot]].]]
[[File:Marmot Hole.jpg|thumb|Marmot Hole.]]
Move 6 Plump Marmots off of [[Thunderfoot Farm]], and fill in 6 Marmot Holes.
*[[Plump Marmot]] moved (6)
*Marmot Hole filled (6)

==Description==
I went off this morning to watch my papa fight the virmen. When I came back, the farm was full of marmots!

I don't want to kill them, but we need to get rid of them. Hey, I know! We can close the holes!

Fill in their holes with dirt, so they can't come out in our farm anymore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]
*[[Puntable Marmot]]

==Progress==
The marmots won't be happy when you try to fill in their holes.

==Completion==
Thank you, <sir/ma'am>! Now I can get back to my chores.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Taking a Crop]] before getting started.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Ana Thunderfoot|The marmots get mad if they see you ruining their holes. Just nudge them out of the way first, and they'll leave you alone.}}
Marmots spawn independently of the holes, so click on holes to aggro any nearby marmots and then quickly click on them to punt them.
