== Objectives ==
Have a drink with {{NPC||Chen Stormstout||Chen}}, {{NPC||Li Li}}, and {{NPC||Mudmug}}.

== Description ==
I'd say we've earned our reward. I can't wait to taste what Mudmug's been brewing.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
* 32000 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
I know Uncle Chen's coming back. I'm not worried.

Actually, this is probably my big chance to finally explore Pandaria! No fat uncle tying me down!

==Notes==
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Mudmug! This is fantastic! Strong, too!}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Thanks! Most folk 'round here prefer it over anything from that "Stormstout Brewery".}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Wait... did you say Stormstout Brewery?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|You know of more Stormstouts? Here, on Pandaria?}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Well shoot, of course! They're the biggest brewin' family in the whole valley!}}
:{{text|emote|Li Li smiles.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|A brewery ... my family ... my ancestral home!}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Wait a dang minute - you're a Stormstout?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Yes I am. Tell me - where is this "Stormstout Brewery?" I must see it for myself!}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|You just keep goin' down this same road, but...}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I am going. Li Li... you stay here. I will come back for you.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Promise me you will keep out of trouble while I am away?}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I... yeah, sure. Whatever.}}
:''Chen takes off.''
:{{text|say|Li Li|I can't believe he left me with the weird mud guy.}}
