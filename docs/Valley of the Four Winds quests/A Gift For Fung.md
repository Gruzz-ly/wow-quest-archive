== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Farmer Fung.jpg|Farmer Fung|[[Nomi]] said that he eats cubs.}}
Obtain a [[:Bloody Plainshawk Leg]] from a {{NPC||Monstrous Plainshawk}}, and then bring it to {{NPC||Kol Ironpaw}} in the [[Halfhill Market]].
*[[Grilled Plainshawk Leg]]

== Description ==
Farmer Fung is pretty mean, and just a little scary. Mah always said that he was one of the best farmers in the valley, though.

I think I know the perfect gift for a mean, kind of scary guy like him.

There's some big plainshawks that circle the hills to the west of here. You should get one, find a big piece of meat, and then ask Kol Ironpaw to grill it up!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +1400 [[reputation]] with [[Farmer Fung]]
* +150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

== Progress ==
Harrumph!

== Completion ==
Hey! Where'd you get that? I thought they were out of plainshawk!

{{NPC||Andi}} asked you to get this for me? Huh. Maybe I underestimated that kid.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Kol Ironpaw
{{dialogue|{{gossip|Chef... if I brought you a plainshawk leg, could you grill it for me?}}}}
{{text|say|Kol Ironpaw|Certainly.  If you brought me some meat - which you have not - then I would be able to grill it for you.}}

Pick up the other dailies before heading out. The hawks fly all over the [[Heartland]], some in packs, but more are circling bigger hills in the area. Kill one. It drops the [[Bloody Plainshawk Leg]]. Fly back to the [[Halfhill Market]] and speak with {{NPC||Kol Ironpaw}} at {{co|53.0|51.3|Valley of the Four Winds}} on the north side of the market:
{{dialogue|:Looking for meat? I've got plenty right here.
:On my grill, I mean.
:{{gossip|Chef, could you grill this plainshawk leg for me?}}}}
:{{text|say|Kol Ironpaw|Sure thing, <name>! Enjoy!}}

Take the now-[[Grilled Plainshawk Leg]] over to Farmer Fung, a few yards away.
