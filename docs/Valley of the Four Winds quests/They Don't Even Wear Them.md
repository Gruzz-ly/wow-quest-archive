==Objectives==
Obtain a Stolen Circlet, a Ransacked Ring, and a Burglarized Bracelet.
*[[Stolen Circlet]]
*[[Ransacked Ring]]
*[[Burglarized Bracelet]]

==Description==
A few weeks ago, a group of those jumpy little Springtail [[virmen]] broke into my lockbox and stole several handfuls of my jewelry. I've since found a few pieces, but they still have most of my collection.

If you're headed up to the [[Springtail Crag]], in the cliffs to the north, you should keep an eye out for them. I'd love to get my jewelry back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]
*+2000 reputation with [[Tina Mudclaw]]

==Progress==
Can you believe how irresponsible and juvenile those virmen are? Don't they know how much that jewelry COST?

==Completion==
Oh, <name>! I'd kiss you right here and now if you weren't... well, if you weren't covered in virmen dust.

Thanks, though!

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

Fly up to the [[Springtail Crag]] north of [[Cattail Lake]] and kill a path to the back of one of the virmen dens. Valid units include [[Springtail Burrower|burrowers]], [[Springtail Littlewhisker|littlewhiskers]], and [[Springtail Trapper|trappers]]. Continue killing virmen until all three quest items drop.
