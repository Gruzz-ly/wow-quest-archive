==Objectives==
Find [[Ang Thunderfoot]].

==Description==
Your help here is appreciated, <name>. I'd like to give you another job, if you're interested.

My son, Ang, runs the [[Thunderfoot Farm|small farm just down this hill]]. He should have some brought me some fruits and vegetables this morning, but I haven't seen him all day.

Would you go down there and see what's going on?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Wha-? Who the...? [[Pang Thunderfoot|My father]] sent you?

Pshh... he can be so nosy sometimes. I have everything under control here.

==Notes==
Ang is just down the hill to the southwest at the turnip farm, up in the house on stilts.

==Progression==
