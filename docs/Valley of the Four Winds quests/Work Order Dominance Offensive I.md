== Objectives ==
Plant 8 Red Blossom Leek Seeds on [[Sunsong Ranch]].
*Plant [[Red Blossom Leek Seeds]] x8

== Description ==
<Yoon's writing decorates the page though his feelings seem conflicted.>

I normally try to stay out of conflict, but an order is an order. Since you are of the [[Horde]] I decided to pass this order your way.

The [[Dominance Offensive]] has requested an order of [[Red Blossom Leek]]s.

The troops down there just can't seem to get enough of them!

== Completion ==
Well, that's all you can do today! Now to wait for the harvest.

Your crops need only to be tended and prepared for packing tomorrow.

== Notes ==
Plant 8 [[Red Blossom Leek Seeds]]. Consider using a [[Bag of Red Blossom Leek Seeds]] to plant 4 at a time!
