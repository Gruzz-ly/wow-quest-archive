==Description==
The old, faded leather is falling apart, but still legible.

Scrawled on it is some kind of map, and the following lines:


Deep in the valley where four winds blow,<br />The maiden laughs behind her golden fan.<br />At the feet of her ancestors' stair,<br />She whispers secrets into the echoing dark.

==Rewards==

==Completion==
Whoa! I think you found it, <name>! You found the map to Old Man Thistle treasure!

==Notes==
The Old Map only drops from the [[Enormous Cattail Grouper]] at [[Cattail Lake]] when you have earned [[Friends on the Farm]] and are {{rep|Exalted}} with [[Tillers|The Tillers]].
