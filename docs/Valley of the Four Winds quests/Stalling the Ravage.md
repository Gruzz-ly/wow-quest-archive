==Objectives==
Slay 12 Kunzen Hozen.
*Kunzen hozen slain (12)

==Description==
The [[Kunzen tribe|Kunzen hozen]], up in [[Skyrange|the mountains]] to the west, have been acting up, lighting their fires and shouting their chants. Based on what I've heard and seen around here, that means that a ravage is coming.

There's not much we can do to stop the ravage, but we can at least thin their numbers before they attack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+275 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
The ravage could come any time now. We have to be prepared.

==Completion==
They'll be attacking, but my farm - and the farms of my friends - should not be in any danger.

Not if we can help it, anyways. Right, <name>?

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

Fly up to [[Kunzen Village]] on the [[Skyrange]] to the west of the [[Heartland]]. Nearly all hozen in the village count: [[Kunzen Collector|collectors]], [[Kunzen Herdskeeper|herdskeepers]], [[Kunzen Hunter|hunters]], [[Kunzen Ravager|ravagers]], [[Kunzen Ritualist|ritualists]], and [[Kunzen Rockflinger|rockflingers]]. Note, however, that the [[Kunzen Soggybottom|soggybottom]] swimming in the pond does ''not''.
