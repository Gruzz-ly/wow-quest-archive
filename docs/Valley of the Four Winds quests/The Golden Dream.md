==Objectives==
Bring a Sprig of Dreamleaf to [[Yan]] in [[New Cifera]].
*[[Sprig of Dreamleaf]] {{co|65.3|26.2|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
[[Clever Ashyo|Ashyo]] must have experienced what we call the golden dream.

Many of us working here have seen it, too - often after a long day of toiling in the pools. It is said this vision—and the feeling of elation it brings—is a reward to the mind for working the body.

There IS an easier way, though we rarely resort to it anymore: a tea can be brewed using lotus root and dreamleaf, which grows around the shrine on the upper tier.

Bring the dreamleaf to Yan back in town and he can brew the tea for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes, did you need something?

==Completion==
Ah... dreamleaf! So you want to see the Golden Dream, do you?

Come to think of it, I haven't seen the Dream in years - not since I was a cub spending long hours in the pools. Long before I took up the culinary arts.

Looks like you brought enough dreamleaf for two cups of tea... so why not?

Here's to better days!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Wait a minute, now we need to go pick a flower for these guys?}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Seems kind of girly to me.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Besides... isn't it THEIR job to pick the flowers?}}
Head up the hill to the top level of the Pools of Purity and pick up the sprig of dreamleaf behind the statue.

On picking the dreamleaf:
;[[Herbalist]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|<Name>... you picked that flower like a champion!  You're like a... a professional flower-picker!  Have you done this before?}}

;Non-herbalist
:{{text|say|Li Li|Yikes, <name>, don't manhandle the thing.  Have you never picked an herb before?}}

Up near the dreamleaf, be on the lookout for [[Krosh]], a [[dragon turtle]]. Kill it to loot [[Krosh's Back]] and start [[Guess Whose Back]]. The bottletoads/snap judgement quests can be completed up here as well. Turn in Snap Judgment on the way down to the lower level for Watery Woes. Kill the cranes and loot the glimmering flies, which are critters. Then turn in at New Cifera.

While out and about in the Gilded Fan, up in the northwest corner is a named [[crocolisk]], [[Manglemaw]]. Kill it to spawn his mother, [[Manglemaw's Mother]]. She drops an [[Enormous Crocolisk Tail]], which starts [[A Crocolisk Tale]].

On complete, a cutscene begins:
:''The camera flies downriver in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] to the north toward [[Whitepetal Lake]]. It banks right and flies east over the [[Golden Pagoda]] between the two giant mogu statues to close in on [[Mogu'shan Palace]].''

:{{text|say|Yan|No... That's not right...}}
:{{text|say|Yan|It should be beautiful. It should be pristine!}}
:{{text|say|Yan|Perhaps I brewed the tea wrong? Yes, that must be it. I brewed the tea wrong. My apologies.}}

This completes the [[Clever Ashyo]] portion of [[The Search for the Hidden Master]]. If players have not completed all of the other portions (ending with [[Warn Stoneplow]], and [[Training and Discipline]]), they should do so at their earliest convenience to advance the [[Stoneplow]] phase.

===Cutscene===
{{Stoneplow cutscene}}

==Progression==
{{Pools of Purity}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.4.0|note=Yan now speaks about brewing the tea wrong, due to the vale's changes.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
