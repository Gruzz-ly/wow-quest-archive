==Objectives==
Harvest 2 EZ-Gro Green Cabbages from your field and bring them to [[Farmer Yoon]] in [[Sunsong Ranch]].
*[[EZ-Gro Green Cabbage]] (2)

==Description==
It's time for our hard work to pay off! Normally we'd have to wait a day before the crops are ready to harvest.

Fortunately, those seeds [[Merchant Greenfield|Greenfield]] gave us were specially designed to grow FAST. The yield won't be worth much, but they're good for stepping new farmers through the process.

Our cabbages should be ready to harvest. I'll let you do the honors, of course!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*112900 [[XP]]
*+700 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Look at those... err, what do they say around here? Oh yeah, b'yoots!

Look at those b'yoots!

I think I'm getting the hang of this farmer thing.

==Completion==
Well, those are the basics!

Till the soil, plant the seeds, tend to any threats, then wait for the results!

Today was easy, but stay on your toes: my grandfather told me all kinds of crazy stories about farming at Sunsong Ranch.

Farming ain't all giant turnips and roses, you know.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Those cabbages should be ready any minute now... wait for it...}}
:''They pop up!''
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|There we go! Ripe for the pickin's!}}
Walk over and pick them. The first will award the achievement [[Green Acres]].

''Complete:''
: {{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Just remember, real crops will take a day to grow, so after you've tilled and cared for your plants, come back the next day to harvest your bounty!}}
