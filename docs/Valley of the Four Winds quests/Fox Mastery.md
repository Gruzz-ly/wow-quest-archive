==Objectives==
Kill 15 Sly Foxes.
*[[Sly Fox]] slain (15)

==Description==
So, when I was scouting [[Wild Plains|east of here]] I saw a collection of foxes.  That's what I first learned to hunt when back on the [[Wandering Isle]].

If you want to see the challenge a young [[pandaren]] hunter faced when growing up, head east and face off against a bunch of foxes.  They tend to be clever and cunning so be on your guard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I used to go on fox hunts with my father.  If he could see me now!  Hunting in [[Pandaria]]!

==Completion==
Well done!  You outfoxed the foxes.  I will talk to Mr. Pleeb about getting you another trophy made.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Mushan Mastery: Darkhide]] before heading out northeast to the Wild Plains. [[Sly Pup]]s count too.

==Progression==
{{Nesingwary's Safari}}
