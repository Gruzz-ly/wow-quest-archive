==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Chufa.jpg|Chufa|You don't get to be a Warren-Mother by virtue of good looks.}}
Defeat Chufa, the Twitchheel Warren-Mother.
*[[Chufa]] slain {{co|67.9|37.4|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
We've dealt with the alpha males. Now, the alpha female.

[[Virmen]] aren't terribly selective when it comes to breeding, but most broods will still have a dominant mother figure. She's usually bigger, meaner, and tougher than anyone else in the brood.

You know, I wouldn't mind testing my skills against a warren-mother. Mind if I fight alongside you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*161000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ready when you are, <name>.

You go ahead.  I'll meet you down there.

==Completion==
That should take care of the virmen for a few weeks, at least. Enough time for Mudmug to get out a few good batches of beer, uninterrupted.

And isn't that what's really important?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Thieves to the Core]] and [[Crouching Carrot, Hidden Turnip]] before heading out. Head down into one of the holes in the field to enter the [[Twisted Warren]]. Toss "carrots" to virmen and loot oats off the ground. In the middle of the warren at the bottom is Chufa, a level 86 elite virmen with 921k health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic melee|5200-7500 on cloth}}
*{{abilities|Chufa's Armor Cannon|Deals 300 Fire damage|notes=Used in phase 2.}}
:{{text|yell|Chufa|You come to fight my brood?  You come to steal my treasures?}}

The first half of the fight starts out normal, but get her to 50% health:
:{{text|yell|Chufa|Time for Chufa's surprise!}}
:''Chufa runs to her stash and puts on a... flamethrower?''
:{{text|yell|Chufa|You're in for it now!}}

Chufa starts strafing the room, just keep attacking her as Chen finally strolls in:
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Did I miss anything?}}
:''He stops at the base of the ramp, looking at Chufa in awe.''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|What!?}}
:''Awe overcome, he runs in and helps finish her off.''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Looks like I made it just in time!}}
:{{text|say|Chufa|Uh oh... my battle armor... weakening...}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I'll let you clean up in here, <name>.  See you back at Mudmug's!}}

==Progression==
{{Mudmug's Place}}

==Patch changes==

*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
