==Objectives==
Harvest 8 Ripe Scallion plants and provide 40 Scallions for the [[Sunreaver Onslaught]].
*Harvest [[Ripe Scallions]] (8)
*[[Scallions]] (40)

==Description==
Once your scallions are ready to be picked, you'll need only to package them for pick-up.

Just think; your scallions will feed so many hungry soldiers on the front lines!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|11|40|}}
{{itembox||Lesser Charm of Good Fortune
}}
*12,320 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
The crate sits empty awaiting your crops.

==Completion==
Throw the scallions into the crate! A Sunreaver Onslaught [[Uda the Beast|representative]] will be along shortly for pick-up.

==Notes==
After planting the 8 [[Scallion Seeds]] the day before, harvest the ripe [[Scallions]] and put them in the [[Empty Crate]] just to the southwest of the plots.

;Upon completion

:{{Text|say|Uda the Beast|This is more than I expected, rogue. The Sunreaver Onslaught thanks you.}}
