==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Sho.jpg|Sho|I wouldn't want to live up in the mountains like her.}}
Obtain a bowl of Yu-Ping Soup.
*[[Yu-Ping Soup]]

==Description==
[[Sho]] - that girl who lives up in the mountains - is in town today. I saw her walking toward the [[Halfhill Market]].

Such a long walk... she must be hungry! And I think I know just the thing that she'll like.

The [[hozen]] up on the [[Skyrange]] cook a soup out of fish and apples. It sounds gross, I know... but it's awesome. You'll find it near their big, scary totem.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+1400 [[reputation]] with [[Sho]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Oh!  Hello, <name>.

==Completion==
I was famished!  How'd you know?  Who told you?

Andi, huh?  That kid's gonna grow up to be a real heartbreaker someday...
