== Objectives ==
Obtain 3 Spritewater Essences.
*[[Spritewater Essence]] x3

== Description ==
I've heard lots of cockamamie rumors about [[Stormstout Brewery|this here brewery]]. I thought they were all false... until I saw that {{NPC||Ook-Ook||giant hozen}}.

So, it got me thinkin', what if the other rumors are true? I heard this one rumor just the other day about some [[Sprite|water sprite]]s that run around inside the brewery, causin' a ruckus and whatnot. Their bodies are actually MADE OF WATER.

I reckon a man could make some mighty fine beer with some fancy water like that. If you find any, could you bring me some?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|10|20}}

== Progress ==
This is gonna be great. It'll just be like makin' beer, but instead of water, I'm gonna use water sprite meat.

== Completion ==
Looks like plain ol' water to me. It's hard to believe that it's actually the corpse of a real, honest-to-goodness walkin'-around living thing.

Can't wait to turn it into beer and drink it.

== Gains ==
* 129000 XP

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|The brewery's got a second entrance, over yonder.}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|I reckon I'll see you over there.}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|I suppose I'll be off then. You a-comin', Chen?}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|I suppose I'll be off then. You a-comin', Li Li?}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|Where'd those other two go? Did they leave me behind? Don't nobody care about Mudmug?}}
:''Mudmug takes off.''
Pick up [[Clear the Way]] and [[Barrels, Man]] before taking off.

Ook-Ook, a level 89-elite hozen with 32.7 million health is running up and down the path, but will only throw barrels at players and not mash them in to a fine paste. Click on the bonus action button to escape from the barrel once Ook-Ook has passed.

Plenty of hostile hozen and virmen, neutral water sprites, and barreled pandaren in the area.
