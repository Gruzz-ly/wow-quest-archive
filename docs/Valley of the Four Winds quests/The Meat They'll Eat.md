==Objectives==
[[File:Adolescent Mushan.jpg|thumb|[[Adolescent Mushan]].]]
[[File:Wyrmhorn Turtle.jpg|thumb|[[Wyrmhorn Turtle]].]]
Obtain 4 Mushan Shoulder Steaks and 80 Turtle Meat Scraps.
*[[Mushan Shoulder Steak]] (4)
*[[Turtle Meat Scrap]] (80)

==Description==
I told you earlier, my pigs are picky eaters. They need to eat meat to grow strong, but they don't like [[sheep|mutton]], they don't like [[yak]], and I'm not about to feed them any [[pig]] meat.

They do, however, eat meat off of the [[mushan]] beasts, and they're also quite partial to [[turtle]]. Both creatures can be found in abundance to the west.

My skills as a hunter are admittedly quite weak. Can you help out a young rancher and his pigs?

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It hurts my ears to hear their hungry squeals.

Once you've been a pig rancher for a while, you can distinguish hungry squeals from regular squeals.

==Completion==
<Liang sorts through the meat.>

You're not just a <class>, but you're a butcher, too?  You've got an eye for quality pig food, neighbor.

<Liang throws the meat into the muddy pit below.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Back to the Sty]] before getting started. Head down to the southwest to the combined [[Wyrmhorn Turtle|turtle]]-and-[[Adolescent Mushan|mushan]] area and get started. Each turtle will yield 6-10 Turtle Meat Scraps, but the Mushan do not always provide meat.  The pigs are also spread out in the area, but more-or-less fixed to one location. On the return to Thunderfoot Ranch, Chen and Li Li are in attendance. Li Li is still rather annoyed at Chen's pace:

:{{text|say|Li Li|Here we are, FINALLY setting foot in our ancestral home, for the first time in our lives, and you want to stop and rest by a PIG FARM?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Be patient, Li Li.  If we explore Pandaria too quickly, we will quickly run out of Pandaria to explore.}}
:''Chen chuckles, but Li Li is exasperated.''
:{{text|say|Li Li|That... barely even makes sense!  You're just saying that because you're lazy and old!}}

On complete:
:{{text|yell|Liang Thunderfoot|Here you go, girls! Courtesy of <name>!}}
