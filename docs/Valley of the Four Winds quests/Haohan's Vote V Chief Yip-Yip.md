==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Chief Yip-Yip.jpg|Chief Yip-Yip|The leader of the Kunzen hozen.}}
Kill Chief Yip-Yip at [[Kunzen Cave]] to the northwest.
*[[Chief Yip-Yip]] slain

==Description==
You ready for the final step of the plan?

The leader of the Kunzen [[hozen]] is a brute by the name of Chief Yip-Yip.  It's said that he is nearly impervious to pain.

I've injected the melons with a toxic mixture, so don't try eating them!

Once you get his attention, throw these melons onto the ground.  Yip-Yip won't be able to resist a sweet striped melon.

When he takes a bite, he'll be temporarily weakened, and you should find yourself an opening to attack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72||}} 
*294,000 [[XP]]
*+1,000 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Did it work?  Is Chief Yip-Yip slain?

==Completion==
The hozen chief is dead?  Our plan worked, <name>!

==Notes==
You will get an extra action button to Throw Melon.  Start attacking him.
