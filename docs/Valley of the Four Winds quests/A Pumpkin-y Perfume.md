==Objectives==
Plant a [[Mogu Pumpkin]] in [[Sunsong Ranch]]. You can purchase seeds from [[Merchant Greenfield]] in the [[Halfhill Market]].
*Plant [[Mogu Pumpkin Seeds]]

==Description==
I heard a rumor around the market that [[Gina Mudclaw]] loves the smell of pumpkin blossoms. Maybe if I grow some pumpkins in my farm, she might come and visit a little more often.

Could you plant a pumpkin for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50|lcgf=1}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Did you plant the pumpkin yet?

==Completion==
And now, we play the waiting game...

Sorry, that sounded a little creepy. Forget I said that.

==Notes==
Merely planting the [[Mogu Pumpkin Seeds]] is enough to complete the quest.
