Follow [[Chen Stormstout]] to [[Pang's Stead]].
*Follow Chen and [[Li Li]] to Pang's Stead

==Description==
My niece and I are new to [[Pandaria]]. Probably like yourself. We're visitors from the [[Wandering Isle]], and, to be honest, we have no idea where we're going.

That farm up ahead looks as fine a place as any to take off our shoes and enjoy a brew. What do you say, Li Li?

<Race>? Would you like to share the road with us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Welcome, welcome, visitors! You've come to sample some of my son's turnips? Perhaps purchase a few pigs?

Please, make yourselves at home. I have plenty of room.

==Notes==
Before accept, Li Li is getting bored out of her mind:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Come ON, Uncle Chen! What are we waiting for?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Relax, Li Li. We have all the time in the world to explore Pandaria. Take some time to enjoy the trip.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I would enjoy the trip more if we were actually GOING somewhere!}}
Or:
:{{text|say|Li Li|It feels like we were in [[Jade Forest|that forest]] forever. Let's go! We've got to explore [[Valley of the Four Winds|the valley]]!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Do not be too hasty, Li Li. This is how I traveled [[Kalimdor]]: one stop at a time.}}
: ''Li Li laughs.''
:{{text|say|Li Li|No wonder it took you so long, then. You can't explore anything sitting on your butt.}}

On accept:
:''Chen stands up.''
:{{text|say|Li Li|Finally!}}
:''They run up to Pang's Stead and stop in front of Pang Thunderfoot.''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I am called Chen, and this is my niece, Li Li.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|May we stay here at your farmhouse for a while? We don't have much in the way of money, but I will gladly share some of my famous ale with you.}}
:{{text|say|Pang Thunderfoot|Greetings, Chen, Li Li. You may stay, but I do not need any of your ale.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Thank you! We will not trouble you for long.}}
:''Chen walks downs the stairs and over a few yards then sits down.''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Interesting. He does not like beer? A very strange land, indeed.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Really, Uncle? We're stopping already? We only moved, like, ten feet.}}
:''A campfire spawns in front of Chen: ten feet or not, he's planning to relax.''

Speak with Pang:
* Hello, friend.  Care to purchase anything while you're here?
* You and all your friends are welcome to stay here for as long as you like.
:{{gossip|''Does all of this farmland belong to you?''}}
:I've put my son, [[Ang Thunderfoot|Ang]], in charge of my vegetable farm, just down the hill. My nephew [[Liang Thunderfoot|Liang]] runs the pig farm down to the west, and his father - [[Shang Thunderfoot|my brother]] - maintains a small sheep [[ranch]] to south of that.

:My farming days are over. These days, I just gather the harvested crops and sell them to folks headed down this road. Less time on my feet, more money in my pocket.

After complete:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Chen, I think I know why you like it here so much.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Why is that, Li Li?}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Because those two guys make you feel skinny.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Why would I want to feel skinny? Size is strength.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Look at {{NPC||Xiao}} over there. He understands the value of a big belly.}}
:{{text|say|Xiao|Mm-hmm.}}
Or:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Can we go yet? Are you done with your beer?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Almost.}}
:''Li Li waits a few moments.''
:{{text|say|Li Li|How about now?}}
:''Chen chuckles, a smile in his voice.''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Almost.}}
