==Description==
I love working in the market, although there's one aspect of this job I really dislike: collecting debts.

While most pandaren debts are simply due to laziness, there are a few unsavory characters around town who simply don't want to pay, and there's some who are just too poor.

A few people here in town owe me money. Could you go talk to them, and remind them about what they owe?

==Rewards==
You will receive:

* 236000 XP
* +150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]
* +2600 reputation with [[Gina Mudclaw]]

==Progress==
You know, it's kind of nice having a thug... er, I mean <class>... like you around.

==Completion==
I'm glad that nasty business is over with. Nobody gave you any trouble, did they?

==Notes==
No trek to [[Kunzen Village]] required this time.

[[Spicemaster Jin Jao]] is in his house near the highest point in [[Halfhill]]:
:Step inside, step inside! Is there anything I can get for you today?
:{{gossip|Hello!  I'm here on behalf of Gina Mudclaw, regarding your debt.}}
:''Jin Jao responds with one of these options:''
* {{text|say|Spicemaster Jin Jao|Absolutely!  I have her payment right here.  And send her my... regards.}}
* Gina?  That girl down in the marketplace?  Hah!<br/> Tell that pretty little thing to come collect the money personally.  I'm sure she and I can come to some sort of... agreement.
* My debt?  I owe that girl nothing.<br/> I'm pretty sure she... GAVE me those spices.  I saw her wink at me.  This sort of thing happens often when you're as handsome as I am.<br/> Are you still here?  Scurry off, little <race>.
*{{gossip|<Threaten him with violence.>  Do you want to get punched in the mouth?}}
:{{text|say|Spicemaster Jin Jao|Hey, hey!  No need to get physical!  Fine, I'll pay... but don't expect me to be happy about it.}}
*{{gossip|<Offer to pay off his debt.>  Don't worry about it.  I will pay your share today.}}
:''Are you sure you want to pay {{cost|1}}?''
:{{text|say|Spicemaster Jin Jao|That's more like it.  Now off you go.  Shoo!  You're scaring off the real customers!}}

The grummle [[Trader Jambeezi]] walks the path between [[Spicemaster Jin Jao]]'s house and the [[Lazy Turnip]] in Halfhill:
:It is a most auspicious day today, is it not?
:{{gossip|Hello! I'm here on behalf of Gina Mudclaw, regarding your debt.}}
:''Jambeezi responds with one of these options:''
*{{text|say|Trader Jambeezi|Oh yes!  The market girl!  Here you are!  A wise man pays his debts when an imposing-looking <class> is involved.}}
*A wise man pays his debts off immediately. A wiser man knows when he is being swindled.<br />Gina sits in the market and counts money all day. I walk the lonely roads and am lucky to make enough to scrape by. Why should I have to pay?
*Gina's father is very, very rich. If she wants money, she can always speak with him.<br />Why must she bother poor old Jambeezi?
*{{gossip|<Threaten him with violence.> A debt is a debt. Let's see the money.}}
:{{text|say|Trader Jambeezi|Now, now!  Bad luck to raise your fists in the middle of town.  I was just... just testing you.  Here is the money I owe.}}
*{{gossip|<Offer to pay off his debt.> Don't worry, Jambeezi. I will pay your share today.}}
:''Are you sure you want to pay {{cost|1}}?''
:{{text|say|Trader Jambeezi|You are as kind as you are intelligent.  It is very lucky to help a stranger.}}

{{NPC||Innkeeper Lei Lan}} is wandering around inside the Lazy Turnip, the inn of Halfhill:
:Come inside, and have a seat. Get off your feet... I'm sure you've been running around all day.
:Now, what can I do for you?
:{{gossip|Hello! I'm here on behalf of Gina Mudclaw, regarding your debt.}}
:''Lei Lan responds with one of these options:''
* {{text|say|Innkeeper Lei Lan|Of course you are!  Thanks for coming by.  Here's my payment.}}
*I understand, I owe money. I can pay you if I need to, but...<br />I NEED this money. Our inn is falling apart. If I don't have money to pay for repairs, I'll be out of a job... and a home.
*I wish I could pay today... but business has been so bad lately.  I just don't have the money.<br />The few pieces of gold I have were going to buy dinner for my family.  Please... there must be something you can do.
*{{gossip|<Threaten her with violence.> Not my problem. Pay up or face the consequences.}}
:{{text|say|Innkeeper Lei Lan|I understand. Here's the payment. I'm sorry to have taken so much of your time, <sir/ma'am>.}}
*{{gossip|<Offer to pay off her debt.> I'll pay your debt today. It's the least I could do.}}
:''Are you sure you want to pay {{cost|1}}?''
:{{text|say|Innkeeper Lei Lan|You are a good <man/woman>, <name>.  This act of kindness won't be forgotten.}}

{{NPC||Lolo Lio}} is sitting on a cart in the southeast part of Halfhill:
:All these folks comin' and goin' these days. It really gets you thinkin' about life.
:Like, maybe... I should be comin' and goin' somewhere, too.
:{{gossip|Hello! I'm here on behalf of Gina Mudclaw, regarding your debt.}}
:''He responds with one of these options:
*{{text|say|Lolo Lio|I remember Gina!  I bought some supplies from her, a few days back.  Here's the money.  Tell her I said hello.}}
*Uh-oh...<br />I probably shouldn't tell you, but I'm saving up my money to leave this town. I just can't stand staying in one place anymore.<br />You're an adventurer... you understand. Could you help me out?
*Oh... oh no. I'm gonna be in big trouble when ma finds out about this.<br />Could you pay my debt for me?
*{{gossip|<Threaten him with violence.> You need to be taught a lesson, kid. Pay up.}}
:{{text|say|Lolo Lio|Whoah! You... you're serious about this!  OK, fine... here's everything I've got.}}
*{{gossip|<Offer to pay off his debt.> I'll pay off your debt today. Next time, try to be more responsible.}}
:''Are you sure you want to pay {{cost|1}}?''
:{{text|say|Lolo Lio|R-really?  I won't forget this, <sir/ma'am>!}}
