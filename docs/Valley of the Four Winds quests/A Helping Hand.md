==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Unbudging Rocks.
*[[Unbudging Rock]] cleared x8

==Description==
I've been pushing and shoving and hammering all morning, but it's hopeless.

These rocks won't budge!

"It will be a breeze," Grandpa said. "Farming's like breathing!" he said. Maybe for him, but not for me!

How am I supposed to succeed at this whole FARMING thing if I can't even clear my farm for planting?

Hey, wait a minute. You look like you've got some muscle on you.

Would you be willing to help me out? Just until I can catch my breath.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 112900 [[XP]]
* +900 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
I really wasn't cut out for this type of work. I didn't exactly grow up in the country.

==Completion==
What? You cleared the rocks? That's great news!

Maybe now I can actually start growing something on this farm!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Take over for me... uh... what's your name?  <Name>?  Thank you, <name>.  I need a break.}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|You can find me in my house if you need me.}}
:''Yoon walks off and up the steps into his house.''

Walk over to a rock, click on it, repeat. Head in to his house to turn in, then follow him outside for a short script event:
[[File:A Helping Hand finale.jpg|thumb|Yoon, Haohan, Fung, Mung-Mung]]
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Hey, do I hear someone outside?}}
:''Yoon walks outside to find {{NPC||Haohan Mudclaw}}, {{NPC||Farmer Fung}}, and {{NPC||Mung-Mung}} walking up.''
:{{text|say|Haohan Mudclaw|Hey, Yoon!  Come out here!}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Oh, oh my! Mr. Mudclaw!  I didn't expect such an important visitor.}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|You are THE Haohan Mudclaw, right? Head of the [[Tillers|Tiller's Union]]? You are the master farmers in all of [[Pandaria]]!}}
:{{text|say|Haohan Mudclaw|So, you've taken over the ranch for good, eh?}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Yessir!  My grandfather left me this farm.  Just moved in the other day.  Nice to meet you, neighbor!}}
:{{text|say|Haohan Mudclaw|Let's get one thing straight.  You may be [[Old Yoon]]'s cub, but you're still a citypaw.}}
:{{text|say|Haohan Mudclaw|You even know how to run a farm?  Know what, I'll save you the trouble.  Sell me this here piece of land and go back where you came from.}}
:''Shocked, Yoon backs up a few steps.''
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|B-but it's my family farm.  I can't just sell it.}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Besides, once I've gotten the hang of this, I want to be a Tiller like the rest of you!}}
:{{text|say|Haohan Mudclaw|You?  Join the Tillers?  Ha!  You'd have to prove your farming skills to all five members of our Council.  They would never vote for you!}}
:''(If Haohan seems pretty sure of himself, it's because three members just happen to be standing in front of Yoon.)''
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Never say never, my grandpa always said.  I'm going to give it my best shot.}}
:{{text|say|Haohan Mudclaw|Do as you please, city boy, but I wager you won't last a week.  I mean, just look at this dump!}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|I give 'im five days.}}
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|Two days, tops!}}
:{{text|say|Haohan Mudclaw|Come on boys, let's leave him to his "farming."  Ho ho ho!}}
:''Laughing, the three walk away towards the market.''

Speak with Yoon again to continue:
:Did you hear what those Tillers said about me being a citypaw?

:Sure I grew up in [[Dawn's Blossom]], but I visited my grandpa a few times.  I know the difference between a carrot and a turnip!  One's orange and one's white, after all!

:After Grandpa passed, he left the farm to me, so I'm going to do my best for him!  But how can I prove that to those Tillers?

:{{gossip|What are you going to do, Farmer Yoon?}}

::You know what?  I'm going to show them that I can also become a master farmer!

::I'm going to turn this farm into one of the most prosperous in the Valley!

::It's too much work for one pandaren, though.  Whaddya say?  Want to help me?

{{rfb-section|Mists of Pandaria}}
:Look at the sky, <name>!  It's raining!  Should be good for the crops, eh?
