==Objectives==
Find [[Lin Tenderpaw]].

==Description==
Lin is more talented than she thinks she is. Strong of fist but weak of spirit. With more confidence, she could be better than all of us.

Perhaps she will find the surety she needs on her trip into the west. She's probably on her way to [[Stoneplow]] as we speak. Stop and speak to her, if you find yourself on that side of [[Valley of the Four Winds|the Valley]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

== Completion==
Oh, it's you!

No, I haven't found the Hidden Master yet. I probably wasted my time coming out here.

<Sigh...>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ken-Ken (quest)]], [[Clever Ashyo (quest)]], and [[Kang Bramblestaff (quest)]] before heading out. These quests will not be quickly completed, as they all lead to other zones, so focus instead on the quests around [[Pang's Stead]] with [[Low Turnip Turnout]].

Lin can be found at [[Stoneplow]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]]. Players are sent to Stoneplow via the breadcrumb [[Stoneplow Thirsts]] after Chen and company have done some work on the [[Stormstout Brewery]], nearly 60 quests after this one was picked up.
