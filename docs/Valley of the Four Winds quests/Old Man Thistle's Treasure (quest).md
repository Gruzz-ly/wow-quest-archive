|Old Man Thistle's Treasure}}

== Completion ==
The chest's lid slides off with the lightest touch. You peer inside...

== Notes ==
The mouth of the [[Cavern of Endless Echoes]] is found at {{co|37.2|23.8|Valley of the Four Winds}} northwest of [[Cattail Lake]], but below the virmen and hozen far above on [[Springtail Crag]] and the [[Skyrange]]. Watch out for the elite {{NPC||Mogu Infiltrator}}s in the area! The cave is blocked by a large pile of rocks, which can be interacted with.

On reaching the cave:
:{{text|say|Fish Fellreed|Wow! I never knew this was back here.}}
:{{text|say|Fish Fellreed|Oooooh, isn't this scary? Do you think there are ghosts in there?}}

Inside are weak {{NPC||Echoweb Cinderfang}}s, and {{NPC||Echoweb Spinner}}s. Spider eggs will spawn {{NPC||Echoweb Hatchling}}s if damaged or approached too closely. Kill them or avoid them, then keep moving through the cave. Take a left at the first fork to circle southwest toward the pond. Deep in the cave is the [[Hidden Treasure (chest)|Hidden Treasure]], guarded by an [[Echoweb Toxiclaw]], a level 90 spider with 1,181,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Poison Drip|range=40|Inflicts Nature damage.|notes=Instant. Random area damage in the room, hits for 4000 Physical, not Nature.}}
*{{abilities|Instant Poison|range=10|Instantly deals Nature damage to the target.|notes=Instant. Hits for 11,616 Physical.}}
*{{abilities|Cave In|Channels a cave in, dealing Nature damage to those who stand beneath the falling debris.|notes=Channeled. ~10 sec duration. Triggers...}}
**{{abilities|Cave In|range=40|Inflicts Nature damage.|notes=Instant. Debuff on affected units functioning as a warning. Will trigger...}}
***{{abilities|Cave In|range=40|Inflicts Nature damage while standing beneath a cave in.|notes=Instant. Hits for 4000 Physical, not Nature.}}
*{{abilities|Acid Breath|range=40|Continually spews poison in a 30 yard cone in front of the caster.|notes=1.2 sec cast. Ticks for 837 Physical every 0.5 sec.}}
*{{abilities|Sticky Webs|range=40|Jump to free yourself of the Sticky Webs!|notes=Instant. Will root the target. Jump to clear the debuff.}}

Nothing too crazy, just avoid the cave ins and frontal breath cone attacks.

Get close to the chest:
:{{text|say|Fish Fellreed|Jumping jackhoppers! We found it! We really found it! It's Old Man Thistle's hidden treasure! Oh boy oh boy oh boy!!!}}

Turn in to the chest and pick up the followup from it.
