==Objectives==
Obtain 18 Glade Glimmers and 5 Spindly Bloodfeathers.
*[[Glade Glimmer]] (18)
*[[Spindly Bloodfeather]] (5)

==Description==
I love fishing. I'd be enjoying myself much more, however, if I had my bait and my lures. They were thrown away in a... a misunderstanding with my wife.

<Jojo sighs.>

Should I let a whole day of fishing be ruined, just because of a little domestic squabble? No! All I need is bugs and feathers, after all, and this glade is filled with those two things.

Care to help a fisherman out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I refuse not to fish. Fishing's who I am.

==Completion==
Finally, someone who understands me. Fishing is what it's all about, right?

Maybe I should leave New Cifera... just pack up my things and join the Anglers, down in the south. Of course, I can't leave my family behind...

But still... a pandaren can dream, right?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ashyo's Vision]] and [[Bottletoads]] before heading out.

After accepting both Bottletoads and Watery Woes:
:{{text|say|Li Li|What, so we gather a couple of bugs, and a few bird feathers? No problem!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|This is fun, <name>. Way more fun than hanging out with a boring uncle.}}
Up toward the top is Zhang Yue, who offers [[Snap Judgment]]. Ashyo is a few yards to the west of Zhang, so do his event, turn in Ashyo's Vision and pick up [[The Golden Dream]] from Yue. Head up the hill to the top level of the Pools of Purity and pick up the sprig of dreamleaf behind the statue. Also, be on the lookout for {{NPC||Krosh}}, a [[dragon turtle]] with 368,000 health. Kill it to loot [[Krosh's Back]] and start [[Guess Whose Back]]. The bottletoads/snap judgement quests can be completed up here as well. Turn in Snap Judgment on the way down to the lower level for Watery Woes. Kill the cranes and loot the glimmering flies, which are critters. Then turn in at New Cifera.

While out and about in the Gilded Fan, up in the northeast corner near the waterfall is a named [[crocolisk]], {{NPC||Manglemaw}}. Kill it to spawn his mother, {{NPC||Manglemaw's Mother}}. She drops an [[Enormous Crocolisk Tail]], which starts [[A Crocolisk Tale]].
