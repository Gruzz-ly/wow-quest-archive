==Objectives==
Find the martial arts students, then help them defeat an Ik'thik Bloodrager, Incubator, Tendon-Slicer, and Fearmonger.
*[[Ik'thik Bloodrager]] slain {{co|8.9|54.1|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*[[Ik'thik Incubator]] slain {{co|8.9|51.0|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*[[Ik'thik Tendon-Slicer]] slain {{co|9.5|54.1|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*[[Ik'thik Fearmonger]] slain {{co|9.5|58.2|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
Those five students - the ones who were looking for the Hidden Master - they went up to the front lines, alone. I'd send Shado-Pan to aid them, but I haven't got any left.

There's dangerous creatures up there near the wall. If you find those students, make sure that they haven't fallen to any of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
*161000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
They can't keep fighting like this forever. Those kids are downright heroic, but I don't want them to die as heroes.

It's time to throw in the towel.

==Notes==
Head southeast toward the wall. The five are cycling between two points in the scar, one to the north and one to the south.  Xiao will call out:
:{{text|yell|Xiao|<Name>! Over here!}}

If you happen to find them dead in a pile, just kill the mobs near them and they will jump up alive and ready to go.
:{{text|say|Clever Ashyo|Return from where you came, mantid.}}
:{{text|yell|Ken-Ken|Yeah!  Get back over your wall, you jikkety-dooks!}}

Depending on when the player has caught up to them they will be fighting one of four mobs:

They run from the north to the scar to fight the tendon-slicer:
;Ik'thallik Tendon-Slicer
:{{text|yell|Ik'thallik Tendon-Slicer|For the pride of the mantid!}}
He vanishes like a rogue fairly frequently.
:{{text|say|Xiao|Which way did he go?}}
Victory:
:{{text|say|Clever Ashyo|For the jinyu!}}
:{{text|say|Ken-Ken|For the hozen!}}
:{{text|yell|Clever Ashyo, Kang Bramblestaff, Ken-Ken|For Pandaria!!}}
:{{text|yell|Lin Tenderpaw|For Pandaria!!!}}
:{{text|yell|Xiao|For Pandaria!}}
They will run to the south to the Fearmonger.

;Ik'thallik Fearmonger:
:{{text|say|Ik'thallik Fearmonger|I will show you the face of fear.}}
She summons big blue orbs that will cause whoever is hit to run in fear for 10+ seconds.
:{{text|yell|Ken-Ken|What the ook?  Look out!  Scary circle!}}
Victory:
* (If the Fearmonger was not the last one: {{text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|Let's keep moving!  I see another big one, down there!}})
:{{text|say|Xiao|That made me hungry.}}
:''Clever Ashyo chuckles.''
:{{text|say|Clever Ashyo|Everything makes you hungry, Xiao.}}
They will run back to the scar to fight the Bloodrager.

;Ik'thallik Bloodrager:
:{{text|yell|Ik'thallik Bloodrager|I will drain the red blood from your bodies!}}
He has a spin move:
:{{text|say|Lin Tenderpaw|Stay away from those claws - they look sharp!}}
And a fixate:
:{{text|yell|Ik'thallik Bloodrager|I will hunt you down, soft-skin...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Ik'thallik Bloodrager is chasing you.  Run!}}
Victory:
:{{text|say|Lin Tenderpaw|Woo hoooooo!}}
:{{text|say|Ken-Ken|These mankers messed with the wrong hozen!}}
:{{text|say|Clever Ashyo|Mankers?}}
:{{text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|No time, brothers!  We've got to keep fighting!}}
They run from the scar noth to fight the egg-matron.

;Ik'thallik Egg-Matron:
:{{text|yell|Ik'thallik Egg-Matron|Her Majesty's brood will sweep over this valley!}}
She spawns a large number of [[Ik'thik Scorpid Egg|eggs]]:
:{{text|say|Ik'thallik Egg-Matron|You cannot stop Her Majesty's brood!  Our numbers are endless!}}
:{{text|yell|Kang Bramblestaff|<Name>, take care of those eggs!  We'll focus on the big mama!}}

After killing the fourth:
:{{text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|We cannot fight like this forever.}}
:{{text|yell|Kang Bramblestaff|<Name>, go speak to [[Guard Captain Oakenshield]]. Tell him we need reinforcements!}}
