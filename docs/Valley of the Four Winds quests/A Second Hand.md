== Objectives ==
Speak to one of your best friends and ask them to work on [[Sunsong Ranch]].
* Hired a farm hand

== Description ==
Despite your best efforts, the work is starting to pile up around here.

Perhaps you could ask one of your best friends if they'd like to help out at Sunsong Ranch.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
* 118000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
It's a sturdy rake.

== Completion ==
The talismans on the shrine tinkle softly in the wind.

==Notes==
Any of the [[Tillers]] NPCs with [[individual reputation]] can be asked to join the farm once their relationship is at {{text|bestfriend|Best Friend}} level - see [[Tillers#Known members]] for a list of all ten of them. This requires completing their daily quests (whenever they are in the "rotation" that passes through Halfhill Market) and/or giving them gifts (a favorite meal, as well as the items found in [[Dark Soil]] among other locations).

If one of the Tillers has already been invited to join the farm before accepting the quest, someone will need to be invited again to receive quest credit. Furthermore, if they are the only {{text|bestfriend|Best Friend}} so far, they cannot be re-invited; another NPC must be raised to maximum reputation and invited to complete the quest. The first can be re-invited after that if desired.

==Progression==
