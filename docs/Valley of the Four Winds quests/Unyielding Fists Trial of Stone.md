==Description==
You have accomplished much in the short time you have been here, <name>. I would not normally offer this test so soon... but I feel that you're ready.

It is time you attempted the Trial of Stone.

*161000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This test will be trying. You will test your strength of your fists against the strength of stone. Steel yourself, <name>.

Not literally, of course.

Unless you normally wear steel gloves... in which case, you may literally steel yourself.

==Completion==
<Master Bruised Paw bows before you.>

Stone quivers and breaks beneath your fists. You have the power to move mountains, if you so desire.

There is nothing more I can teach you.

==Notes==
Speak with him again:
:Are you here for more training, <name>?
:{{gossip|I've done all that you've asked of me. I'm ready for the trail of stone.}}
:{{text|say|This test is simple. All you need to do is strike the stone, until it breaks.}}
:{{text|say|"But that's impossible!", you might say.}}
:{{text|say|You would be wrong. With clarity and focus, nothing is impossible.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Strike the [[Stack of Stone Blocks|stack of stone]] when the meter is full!}}

Good strike:
:{{Text|say|I could not have done better myself.}}

Bad strike:
*{{Text|say|Mind over matter, <name>.}}
*{{Text|say|Clear your mind, <name>.}}
*{{Text|say|Do not let the stone intimidate you. It is stone, you are <race>.}}
