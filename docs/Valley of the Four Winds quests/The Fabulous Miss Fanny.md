==Objectives==
Bring [[:Ang's Giant Pink Turnip]], [[:Ang's Summer Watermelon]], and [[:Pang's Extra-Spicy Tofu]] to {{NPC||Miss Fanny}}, and ask her to deliver them. The food must land on [[Thunderfoot Ranch]].
*Launch a pink turnip {{co|84.3|21.0|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*Launch a watermelon {{co|84.1|22.0|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*Launch the Extra-Spicy Tofu {{co|84.0|22.0|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
Most of these vegetables will be sold, but I'd like to keep some for my family. Specifically, my nephew Liang needs some to feed to his pigs.

Unfortunately, the pathway to [[Liang Thunderfoot|Liang]]'s farm is currently swarming with Snagtooth [[virmen]]. We're going to have to ask Miss Fanny to help us out.

Bring some of the food we've gathered to Miss Fanny, who stands next to my house. Then ask her - NICELY! - to send them down to Liang's ranch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|70}}
*97000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Not now, neighbor. I need to scrounge up some food for these pigs.

==Completion==
I understand you're the one who sent the food down from uncle's farm. Thank you.

My pigs are picky eaters, but those turnips and watermelons are some of their favorites.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Pang Thunderfoot|Look! Here comes Miss Fanny right now!}}
Cartfuls of turnips, watermelons and tofu are delivered by Miss Fanny, who walks up beside the house, at {{co|83.0|21.4|Valley of the Four Winds}} near [[Muno the Farmhand]]. Pick up one of each, then speak with Miss Fanny. She offers a multiple-choice quiz as Muno reacts to the player's choices. Option in bold is the correct one.

[[File:Ang's Giant Pink Turnip.jpg|thumb|Ang's Giant Pink Turnip]]
:<What would you like Miss Fanny to do to the turnip?>
*{{gossip|Hit it very softly.}}
*:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Miss Fanny, you stronger than that! Try and put a little more ook in it next time!}}
*{{gossip|'''Hit it with average power.'''}}
*:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Whoah. Nice shootin', Miss Fanny!}}
*{{gossip|Hit it as hard as possible.}}
*:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Whoah there, Miss Fanny. Maybe that was too hard.}}

[[File:Ang's Summer Watermelon.jpg|thumb|Ang's Summer Watermelon]]
Upon a successful launch, send a watermelon off next:
:<What would you like Miss Fanny to do to the watermelon?>
*{{gossip|'''Hit it very softly.'''}}
*:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Good bonk, Miss Fanny! You got nice control!}}
*{{gossip|Hit it with average power.}}
*:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Easy, Miss Fanny. You hit watermelons too hard... they go boom!}}
*{{gossip|Hit it as hard as possible.}}
*:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Easy, Miss Fanny. You hit watermelons too hard... they go boom!}}

[[File:Pang's Extra-Spicy Tofu.jpg|thumb|Pang's Extra Spicy Tofu]]
Finally, launch the tofu:
:<What would you like Miss Fanny to do to the extra-spicy tofu?>
*{{gossip|Hit it very softly.}}
*:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Ahhh ha ha ha ha! It barely even go halfway down the hill!}}
*{{gossip|Hit it with average power.}}
*:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Ahhh ha ha ha ha! It barely even go halfway down the hill!}}
*{{gossip|'''Hit it as hard as possible.'''}}
*:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Nice, Miss Fanny! You hit it strong!}}

Talk to Miss Fanny one last time:
:<Miss Fanny looks you in the eye and subtly turns her head. Does... does she want to launch YOU?>

:<Assuming that you have correctly interpreted her intentions, how hard should Miss Fanny hit you?>
*{{gossip|''Hit me softly!''}}
*{{gossip|''Hit me with average power!''}}
*{{gossip|''Hit me as hard as you possibly can!''}}
:{{text|say|Muno the Farmhand|Hey, <mister/miss>, what you doing? You gonna get yourself killed!}}

Turn in to Liang, just north of the pool.  And who should be here but Chen and Li Li... and once again, Li Li is frustrated at their progress.
