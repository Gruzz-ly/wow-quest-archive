==Objectives==
Lead [[Mudmug]] back to [[Halfhill]].

If you become separated from Mudmug, you can find him next to the giant banana in the [[Gilded Fan]].
*Lead Mudmug back to Halfhill

==Description==
No, no, no, don't you worry about pickin' 'em up. I can hold these here barrels.

I may not be the handsomest pandaren, or the smartest, or any fun to be around in the slightest, but I'm stronger than a mushan beast.

I'mma just need you to lead the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where's Mudmug?

==Completion==
Good! The water's here!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|I'm trustin' you not to lead me into any rivers, or animal mouths. Nothin' like that.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Wait... which way did you go?}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|You got any other errands you need to run? Don't you worry about ol' Mudmug... just poke me when we get there.}}
Wait a few seconds for Mudmug to start following, then feel free to ignore him and do other quests, like [[Hop Hunting]] and [[Li Li and the Grain]].

While out and about:
*{{text|say|Mudmug|You sure we're goin' the right way, neighbor?}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|Mmm-hmmm.}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|Yup.}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|I reckon we're almost there now.}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|I thought I could carry a lot... until I saw all the crud you carry around in those bags o' yers.}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|Still carryin' these barrels back here.}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|I'm trustin' you not to walk me off that big ol' cliff.}}
*{{text|say|Mudmug|Sure could go for a drink of water right now.}}

He also reacts in other areas as well. Keep him around for a while to see what he says—it's all documented on the other quest pages.

In case Mudmug despawns, return to {{Co|54.29|38.76|Valley of the Four Winds}} and speak with him again:
:Can't wait to try this beer that Chen's thinkin' about.

:He talks a big game, that one.

:{{Gossip|Let's head back to Halfhill, Mudmug.}}

On reaching Chen:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Told you I was strong. Didn't drop one barrel.}}
