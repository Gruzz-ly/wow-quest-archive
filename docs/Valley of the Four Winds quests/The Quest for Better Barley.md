Find the Malted Cave Barley at the base of the [[Winds' Edge]].
*Use the Cliff Harness {{co|51.3|77.5|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*[[Malted Cave Barley]] {{co|53.6|74.7|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
Looking for sweet grain? My father once mentioned a malted cave barley that sounds about right.

If you are willing to brave the peril, there is an ancient cave at the base of the Winds' Edge south of here.

There is even an old lift my father made when he would travel into the jungle.

In the cave is a bush as old as my family. From that bush you can pluck a grain so sweet it will humble your senses.

Just watch out for its guardians.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That jungle sounds spooky.

==Completion==
Now THIS smells like the right stuff!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Grain Recovery]] before heading out. To the southeast is the [[Plain of Thieves]]. Look for mobs actively carrying or guarding bags of grain. Attack them, loot the grain, then finish them off. After gathering the quota, cross the river to the south to reach the Winds' Edge. Look for [[Shai Cliffwatcher]], some light grain, and the rope, then click on the rope to rappel down. To the east is a mouth of a cave, the [[Dark Hollow]]. Enter and loot one of the [[Malted Cave Barley]] in the back to spawn a [[Cave Horror]]! Kill it, mindful of its combined stun/silence move, then exit and head back up.
