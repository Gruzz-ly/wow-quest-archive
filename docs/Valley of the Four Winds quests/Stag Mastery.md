==Objectives==
Kill 10 Wilderland Stags.
*[[Wilderland Stag]] slain (10)

==Description==
I always was a fan of a good stag hunt. Stags are tough, fast, and territorial.

They may be plant eaters but they can give any hunter a run for his money.

East of here is a whole mess of Wilderland Stags just waiting for a hunter like yourself to give 'em a good run.

Happy hunting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*112900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt?

==Completion==
I haven't seen stag hunting this good since [[Ashenvale]].
