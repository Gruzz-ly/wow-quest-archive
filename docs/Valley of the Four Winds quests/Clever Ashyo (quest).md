==Objectives==
Find [[Clever Ashyo]].

==Description==
I'm not sure where Clever Ashyo got his "Clever" title from. All [[jinyu]] are clever, and I wouldn't say that he's any more clever than most of them.

Quite the opposite, actually.

At least he's a capable fighter. He did well enough at [[Tian Monastery]] to be selected for our training mission.

If you want to help him look for the [[Hidden Master]], you can find him along [[Valley of the Four Winds|the Valley's]] northern border.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Where have I seen you before?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ken-Ken (quest)]], [[Kang Bramblestaff (quest)]], and [[Lin Tenderpaw (quest)]] before heading out. These quests will not be quickly completed, as they all lead to other zones, so focus instead on the quests around [[Pang's Stead]] with [[Low Turnip Turnout]].

Ashyo can be found at [[New Cifera]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]]. Players will be sent there while on [[Li Li's Day Off]], which takes place about 10 quest-steps from where this was picked up.
