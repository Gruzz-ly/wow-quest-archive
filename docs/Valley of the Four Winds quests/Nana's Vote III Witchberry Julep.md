==Objectives==
Plant and harvest 3 Witchberries, then deliver 15 Witchberries to [[Nana Mudclaw]].

Witchberry Seeds can be purchased from [[Merchant Greenfield]] at [[Halfhill Market]]. After tilling and tending your plant, you must wait until the next day to harvest ripe Witchberries.
*Plant [[Witchberry Seeds]] (3)
*Harvest Ripe Witchberries (3)
*[[Witchberries]] (15)

==Description==
Now that we have the water, I can almost taste the icy cold witchberry julep!

Now, we just need to find ourselves some sweet witchberries.

[[Haohan Mudclaw|My grandson]]'s berries this season have been total slop, so I need to seek a decent harvest elsewhere.

Say, do you have any witchberries in the ground this year? How about you bring me some from your farm?

If your berries are up to the standard, we'll make ourselves a grand old batch of the old juice!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+440 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Hurry it up, will ya? I'm an old woman. I don't have all the time in the world, and I want one more taste of the sauce before I croak!

==Completion==
<Nana Mudclaw scrutinizes a dark witchberry, then pops it into her mouth. Her face lights up.>

Lands alive! I haven't tasted such a sweet, juicy witchberry in years! Why, the only person who could grow berries like these was... [[Old Yoon]], {{NPC||Farmer Yoon||yer friend's}} grandpa.

<Nana Mudclaw blushes.>

Oh that man was such a scamp! I still remember the summer days when we were young, eating these berries by the bushel without a care in the world.

Thank you for reminding me of an old friend, <name>.

==Notes==
[[File:Nana's Vote III - finale.jpg|thumb|Nana and Yoon.]]
Plant three [[Witchberry Seeds]], do whatever it takes to get them growing, then come back tomorrow to collect them.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Nana Mudclaw|Anyone with such a talented green thumb needs to be a Tiller. I don't care what that hare-brained grandson of mine says! [[Haohan Mudclaw|Haohan]] is wrong about [[Farmer Yoon]]. You have my vote, <name>.}}

Head down to the farm:
:''Nana Mudclaw walks down the path from Halfhill to visit Farmer Yoon.''
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Y-y-you're N-N-Nana Mudclaw! I n-never thought I'd get a visit from the m-m-matron herself!}}

:{{text|say|Nana Mudclaw|You were stubborn enough to keep tilling this soil even though you didn't have much experience.}}
:{{text|say|Nana Mudclaw|You were brave enough to stand up to my grandson, Haohan.}}
:{{text|say|Nana Mudclaw|And you two have shown quite the knack for growing delicious fruits and vegetables.}}
:{{text|say|Nana Mudclaw|For that, you have earned my respect, my gratitude, and my vote. Well done.}}
:''After bowing, Nana kneels in front of the [[Tillers Shrine]] and inserts an incense stick vote into the fourth Offering Bowl.''
:''Nana starts heading back to town, but then stops and turns around.''
:{{text|say|Nana Mudclaw|Oh, and Farmer Yoon.}}
:{{text|say|Nana Mudclaw|I do believe your grandpa would be very proud of you.}}
