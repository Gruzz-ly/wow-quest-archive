==Objectives==
Speak with [[Chen Stormstout]] at the [[Thunderfoot Fields]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

==Description==
Things were not always like this, <race>. Oh no, they were much, much worse. Not three weeks ago, we were under siege by [[saurok]] bandits. They stole our jade, befouled our food stores, and terrorized our cubs.

We needed a hero, and a hero arrived.

He drove back their forces, defeated their leader, and returned our stolen jade. All he asked in return was a serpent ride for [[Li Li Stormstout|his niece]].

I was never able to thank him. If you are headed to the Valley of the Four Winds, would you relay our thanks?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You come from the [[Temple of the Jade Serpent]]? [[Elder Sage Rain-Zhu|Rain-Zhu]] sends his thanks?

Ai yah... really, that was nothing. I could have defeated that saurok without spilling my beer.

In fact, I believe I did.
