==Objectives==
Free 7 Barreled Pandaren.
:[[Barreled Pandaren]] freed (7)

==Description==
I can't believe that [[Ook-Ook|giant hozen]]! He's just throwing barrels everywhere!

Barrels, man!

It looks like he managed to get pretty much all the pandaren that were working out in front of the brewery. If I were you, I'd help some of them break out. Put some of those ridiculous muscles to use.

We're headed over to the brewery's rear entrance, to the east. Meet you there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Barrels.

==Completion==
What is it with monkeys and barrels, anyway?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Li Li|I'm going ahead to see if there's anything I can do to help.}}
*{{text|yell|Li Li|Uncle Chen, Mudmug! Race you there!}}
*{{text|yell|Li Li|Hey, you dumb old uncle! You left me behind!}}
*{{text|yell|Li Li|See you there, Uncle Chen!}}
*{{text|yell|Li Li|Hey, you old jerks! You left me behind!}}
Pick up [[Clear the Way]] and [[The Fanciest Water]] before taking off.

Ook-Ook, a level 89-elite hozen with 32.7 million health is running up and down the path, but will only throw barrels at players and not mash them in to a fine paste. Click on the bonus action button to escape from the barrel once Ook-Ook has passed.

Plenty of hostile hozen and virmen, neutral water sprites, and barreled pandaren in the area.

Before rescue:
*{{Text|say|Barreled Pandaren|Get me out of this barrel!}}

*{{Text|say|Unbarreled Pandaren|Thanks!}}
*{{Text|say|Unbarreled Pandaren|Better get out of here before he comes by again!}}
*{{Text|say|Unbarreled Pandaren|Thank you, kind... OH NO, HERE HE COMES AGAIN!}}
*{{Text|say|Unbarreled Pandaren|I suppose there are worse fates than being stuck forever inside a beer barrel.}}
*{{Text|say|Unbarreled Pandaren|I need a beer.}}
*{{Text|say|Unbarreled Pandaren|Ach! The light... it hurts our eyes...}}
