==Objectives==
Bring [["The Emperor"|beer]] to Zhu's Wardens, the Crane Wing Priests, the Shado-Pan, and the night elf settlers.
*Deliver beer to Zhu's Wardens {{co|17.4|50.3|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*Deliver beer to Crane Wing Priests {{co|15.1|55.4|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*Deliver beer to Shado-Pan {{co|10.7|55.6|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*Deliver beer to night elf settlers {{co|14.9|50.3|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
I been thinkin'.

We got all this beer that [[Chen Stormstout|Chen]] brewed, and we got all these people that you've gathered. We should bring the two together.

There's a bunch o' folks out there in the fields, riskin' their lives for [[Pandaria]]. You an' I should at least bring 'em a keg or two.

They might raise their mugs in victory. They might enjoy one last drink before gettin' skivvered by a [[mantid]]. Either way, I wouldn't want 'em to fight without a good brew in their belly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*161000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Nothing makes a pandaren happier than an untapped keg. Chen's beer may not have improved anyone's fighting skills today, but it certainly improved their morale.

==Notes==
After completing all of all of the [[Valley of the Four Winds storyline]] and the [[Krasarang Wilds storyline]] up to this point ([[The Golden Dream]], [[Training and Discipline]], and [[Warn Stoneplow]]), a cutscene happens in [[Stoneplow]] and the phase advances. This quest is offered when the cutscene ends.

On accept:
:{{text|yell|Mudmug|Grr-r-r-RRAHHH!}}
:{{text|yell|Mudmug|Let's go deliver some dang BEER!}}
Pick up [[The Mantidote]] and [[The Swarm Begins]] before heading out.

Head out and start killing the non-elite mantid. Use Ken-Ken's Mask on the elites to summon Manifestation of Fear, a level 87 sha with 214,000 health. Kill them and the elite will fly off. Mei's quest will complete automatically after the fifth sha has been killed, so feel free to turn it in out in the field.

Due north are {{NPC||Warden of Zhu||Wardens of Zhu}}, no longer despondent, led by {{NPC||Yi-Mo Longbrow}}.
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Ready your arrows, men!}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Notch your arrows, men...}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|We're firing another volley in 3... 2... 1...}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Ready... aim...}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Ready another round!}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Ready... aim...}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Take aim!}}

:{{text|yell|Yi-Mo Longbrow|FIRE!!}}
Deliver the beer:
:{{Text|yell|Yi-Mo Longbrow|The beer's here! Drink up, boys!}}
Further up the path to the northeast is the Incursion forces, led by Lyalia.
:{{text|say|[[Lyalia]]|Beer delivery, in the middle of a battlefield? Perhaps Pandaria will make a good home after all...}}
The Crane Wing Priests are due west in the middle of the Stoneplow Fields, led by Koro Mistalkwer:
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Ahh... beer. Just what my men needed. Thank you, <name>.}}
The Shado-Pan can be found on the southern side of the scar close to the wall.0a
:{{text|say|Fo Sho Knucklebumb|First we get into a fight, and then someone brings us beer! Can today get any better?}}
Once Mudmug has delivered all four:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|That's it for me! No more beer to deliver.}}
:{{Text|say|Mudmug|I reckon I'll head back to Stoneplow and rest my dang arms.}}
Mudmug's quest completes automatically, so feel free to turn in the instant it's done.

Finally, Oakenshield can be found near the end of the northern path around Stoneplow Fields, not far from the wall just north of the scarred earth. Turn in to him for The Swarm Begins.
