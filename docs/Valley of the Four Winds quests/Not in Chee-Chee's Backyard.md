Kill 8 members of the [[Kunzen tribe]] in the [[Kunzen Village]].
*Kunzen tribe member slain (8)

==Description==
Not all hozen are the same. Chee-Chee's tribe was [[Forest Hozen|forest hozen]]... came from [[Jade Forest]]. Pretty easy to get along with.

The Kunzen invaders... they come from mountains, far to the north. Not nearly as nice as Chee-Chee.

They come into our green land, take our things, leave big mess behind.

Chee-Chee wants to kill them. You like to help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 XP
*+2000 reputation with [[Chee Chee]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Completion==
Great! Chee-Chee knew you could do it!

==Notes==
Pick up the other daily quests before heading out.

Fly up to [[Kunzen Village]] on the [[Skyrange]] to the west of the [[Heartland]]. Nearly all hozen in the village count: [[Kunzen Collector|collectors]], [[Kunzen Herdskeeper|herdskeepers]], [[Kunzen Hunter|hunters]], [[Kunzen Ravager|ravagers]], [[Kunzen Ritualist|ritualists]], and [[Kunzen Rockflinger|rockflingers]]. Note, however, that the [[Kunzen Soggybottom|soggybottom]] swimming in the pond does ''not''.

Wrap up the other daily quests before heading back.
