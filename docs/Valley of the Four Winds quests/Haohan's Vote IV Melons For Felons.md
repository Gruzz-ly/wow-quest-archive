==Description==
All right, now I happen to know that those mountain hozen love a delicious, sweet melon.

Mr. Haohan's last harvest of melons got stolen, so we're going to have to grow some of our own.

Once we have our harvest, we'll use them to lure the nasty hozen's leader out of its cave!

Let's make sure we grow some good melons, <name>. Those crafty hozen only like the sweetest melons.

==Completion==

I don't know how I would run this place without you, <name>.
