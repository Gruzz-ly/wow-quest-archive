We have everything we need. It's time to start brewing.

Pay attention, <name>... you might learn a thing or two.

It takes more than three seconds to make beer, <name>. Even when your name is Chen Stormstout.

Thanks for waiting so long. You are as patient as you are brave.

==Notes==
Chen is surrounded by ingredients and materials needed for the brew: [[Grain Basket]], [[Hop Basket]], and [[Water Barrel]].

On accept:
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Very well, <name>. I will need your help making this beer.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|When I yell out the names of ingredients, you throw them in the pot...}}
:{{text|yell|Chen Stormstout|I am kidding!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I'm the best brewer across three continents. I think I can handle this part.}}
:{{text|yell|Mudmug|Damn straight you can!}}

==Trivia==
*Chen's directions for the player to run for ingredients and throw them into the pot was a reference to previous such quests, like [[Troll Patrol: The Alchemist's Apprentice]] and [[Still At It]].
