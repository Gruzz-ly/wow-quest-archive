==Objectives==
Ask Gardener Fran, Gai Lan, and Den Mudclaw for hops.
*Speak with [[Gardener Fran]] {{co|48.3|33.5|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*Speak with [[Gai Lan]] {{co|38.6|51.7|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*Speak with [[Den Mudclaw]] {{co|44.3|34.2|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
With Li Li fetching grain, and Mudmug handling our water, all we need is hops, and some good wood barrels. I'll handle the barrels... but I need you to gather the hops.

I don't know much about the hops from this land, but I'm sure the nearby farmers have something worth brewing with. Go see what you can rustle up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
After talking with the farmers, it seems like they all will be willing to part with some hops... provided that you help them out some way in return.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Li Li and the Grain]] and [[Doesn't Hold Water]] before heading out.

Head north out of Halfhill up the path to run across Mudmug. Turn in and pick up [[The Great Water Hunt]] from him. Do his quest, pick up the followup, [[Barreling Along]], then keep heading north to the [[Heartland]] to find [[Gardener Fran]]. She offers a quest, but first speak to her:
:May the road rise to meet you, traveler.
:What brings you here?
:{{gossip|I'm helping a friend brew some [["The Emperor"|beer]], and we need hops. Do you have any to spare?}}
:{{text|say|Gardener Fran|Nothing is free, <race>. You want hops, you need to work.}}
So pick up and complete [[Gardener Fran and the Watering Can]] from her. Complete her quest, then keep heading west along the path to find Den Mudclaw and Mung-Mung. Speak with Den first:
:Virmen! Gah! Their numbers are endless!
:{{gossip|Do you have any hops you can spare?}}
:{{text|say|Den Mudclaw|You'll have to ask Mung-Mung about that. He maintains our foodstores.}}
Pick up and complete Mung-Mung's quest, [[Enough is Ookin' Enough]]:
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|You say you want hops? No problem. You kill virmen for me. Mung-Mung send some hops to Halfhill for you.}}
Keep heading to the southwest in the Heartland to find {{NPC||Gai Lan}}. Speak to him:
:I'm keeping my fields fallow this season. A wise farmer knows when the land needs to rest.
:{{gossip|Can I buy some hops from you?}}
:{{text|say|Gai Lan|Would that I could, <class>, but I have a bit of a weed problem. Say... you wouldn't be willing to help out, would you?}}
Pick up and complete his quest, [[Weed War]].

This quest completes automatically after talking to the third farmer.
