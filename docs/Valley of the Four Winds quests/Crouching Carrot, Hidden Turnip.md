==Objectives==
Toss Orange-Colored Turnips in front of 12 [[Twitchheel Hoarder]]s.
*Virmen tricked with Orange-Painted Turnip (12)
*[[Orange-Painted Turnip]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Chen Stormstout|Uncle Chen]]'s still got his eye on me, which means I won't be wandering off any time soon.  I guess it's up to you to take these turnips... I mean, "carrots"... into the [[Twisted Warren]] and deliver them for me.

It should be pretty simple.  Just toss the vegetables in front of virmen, then watch their reaction when they find out it's really a turnip!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]
*[[Orange Painted Turnip]]

==Progress==
Go, torment those virmen, <name>!

==Completion==
Bah ha hah haaa!  I love messing with virmen.

==Notes==
The quest title is a reference to the movie {{Wp|Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon}}.

Pick up [[The Warren-Mother]] and [[Thieves to the Core]] before heading out. Head down into one of the holes in the field to enter the [[Twisted Warren]]. Toss "carrots" to [[Twitchheel Hoarder]]s and loot oats off the ground. In the middle of the warren at the bottom is Chufa, a level 86 elite virmen with 921k health. Hoarders appear in groups of three, and the turnip item is a ground-targeted AoE, so aim for the center of the group.
