== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Chen Stormstout}} at the [[Thunderfoot Fields]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

== Description ==
;Mists of Pandaria

An unusual pandaren came through town a few days back. He told a better tale than {{NPC||Pan}}, drank twice as much as {{NPC||Lee}}, and then beat me up in front of the bar. All while his {{NPC||Li Li||little niece}} made fun of us.

It was awesome.

They said they were headed to the Valley of the Four Winds. You should meet him! Just... watch out for that right hook.

;Adventure Guide
The land is ripe with rumors of an unusual [[pandaren]] [[monk]] whose power was matched only for his appetite for brew.

He was traveling with his [[Li Li Stormstout|young niece]] who's mouth seems to get them into a lot of trouble.

The locals say these two were headed to the Valley of the Four Winds. You should meet him! Just... watch out for that right hook.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
* 12900 XP

== Completion ==
Ha ha! You were sent by {{NPC||Bolo}}? The "Keg Mender," right? From the [[Drunken Hozen]]?

How is his eye healing? Is his friend still hung over?

Ahh... that was an enjoyable evening.
