== Objectives ==
Plant a [[Green Cabbage]] in [[Sunsong Ranch]]. You can purchase seeds from {{NPC||Merchant Greenfield}} in the [[Halfhill Market]].
*Plant [[Green Cabbage Seeds]]

== Description ==
Grandpa always said that the bellweather of a true farmer lies in the quality of his cabbage. Any time a new farmer came into town, he'd buy a few heads of cabbage to see what they knew.

Now, I'm the new farmer, and this is my big chance to prove myself. Could you plant some cabbage for me?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50|lcgf=1}}
* 118000 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

== Progress ==
Good farmers grow good cabbage. Bad farmers, bad cabbage. Pretty simple.

== Completion ==
Wait until they try these cabbages. Then they'll know I'm the real deal.

== Notes ==
Merely planting the [[Green Cabbage Seeds]] is enough to complete the quest.
