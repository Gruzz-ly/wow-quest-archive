==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Fish Fellreed.jpg|Fish Fellreed|Ha ha! Her name is Fish.}}
Obtain a Yak Statuette from the inside of a Kunzen hozen hut.
*[[Yak Statuette]]

==Description==
That [[Fish Fellreed]] is kind of weird. First of all, her name's Fish. That's weird.

Once you talk to her, though, she's really a nice lady. Did you know that she's an animal lover?

I've got an idea! The Kunzen hozen, in the mountains to the west, make little animal statues and put them in their huts to scare off bad guys. I bet Fish would LOVE something weird like that!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+1400 [[reputation]] with [[Fish Fellreed]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Hey, <name>! What's up?

==Completion==
Aww, look at him! He's ADORABLE! With his fuzzy little tail, and his...

<She composes herself.>

I mean, ah... thanks, dude. It's pretty cool.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

The yak statuette will be found in the entrance of any hozen hut in [[Kunzen Village]].
