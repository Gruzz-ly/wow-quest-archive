==Objectives==
Guide [[Mudmug]] to Swirling Pools within the [[Gilded Fan]], and help him collect 30 pawfuls of Gladewater.

If you become separated from Mudmug, you can find him next to the giant banana in the Gilded Fan.
*Gladewater gathered (30)

==Description==
Look at it, <name>: the Gilded Fan. I heared lots of good things about the water they got here. Lots of bad things, too.

No sayin' what kind of water [[Chen Stormstout|Chen]]'s gonna be needin', so what say we make him a little sampler platter?

Come on, let's get movin'. We'll go scoop up some water together.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 399 cloaks
|Embrace of Trees
|Dustback Cloak
|Tawnyhide Cape
|Mudmug's Cloak
|Cloak of the Grassy Cline}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That Stormstout feller says he's the best brewer that ever was. Might be true, couldn't tell ya one way or the 'nother as of yet.

==Completion==
Lookee that, neighbor! That is quite the collection of water we got here. With magical water like this, I'm sure that Chen'll make a [["The Emperor"|brew]] that really shines.

Or possibly a brew that lands someone in the outhouse for a month. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

Speak to him again:
:You ready to go water-huntin?
:{{gossip|I'm ready to go, Mudmug.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Let's head out into that glade. Look for dark, swirling pools of water... that'll be the good stuff.}}
At the first pool:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|This water looks pretty good over here.}}
At the second pool:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Somethin's a little funny about this here water...}}
:{{text|yell|Mudmug|Ouch!}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Somethin' pinched me! Get it, <name>!}}
Kill the [[Glade Pincher]].
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Looks like he's got a little bit o' that water stuck in his gills. I'll just scoop some of this up...}}
At the third pool:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Boy howdy! Look at this pretty little pool!}}
At the fourth pool:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Let's see here...}}
:{{text|yell|Mudmug|Hot damn!}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Water spider! Smush him, <name>!}}
Kill the [[Waterbite Creeper]].
:{{text|say|Mudmug|I'll just scrape some of this water from his little spider mouth-parts. A little bit o' poison never hurt no one, right?}}
At the fifth pool:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|This water seems a little too... what's that word? Oh yeah, clean.}}
At the sixth pool:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Now this is what I'm talkin' about! Ain't no spiders or crabs in this water.}}
:{{text|yell|Mudmug|Crap!}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Dang ol' croc nearly took off my head!}}
Kill the [[Toothrow Skulker]].
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Holey smokes, this fella swallowed a lot of water. I oughta pick some up. I bet that Chen never made no croc-belly-water beer.}}
At the last pool:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|This should be the last of it.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|I reckon we got enough.}}
Feel free to turn in to him immediately upon completion.

If adventurers haven't found Manglemaw yet, up in the northwest corner is a named [[crocolisk]], [[Manglemaw]]. Kill it to spawn his mother, [[Manglemaw's Mother]]. She drops an [[Enormous Crocolisk Tail]], which starts [[A Crocolisk Tale]].
