== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Mothallus.jpg|Mothallus|The mightiest of moths.}}
Bait and defeat {{NPC||Mothallus}}.
*Bait and kill Mothallus {{co|64.4|58.0|Valley of the Four Winds}}

== Description ==
The esteemed {{NPC||Journeyman Chu}} would appear to have created a monster. It is silken death with wings.

Mothallus.

You have already faced its brood. Now we ask that you help us face the creature itself.

Please, <class>, venture into the pit and rifle the bait. This will bring the beast to you.

Our mothfighters will assist you as you need, though silk tends to stick to them more than most so you may need to help them, should they become overwhelmed.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:

== Progress ==
Have you vanquished the beast?

== Completion ==
We are pursuing perfection in our art and in ourselves. Along the way many mistakes will be made.

I'm sure by tomorrow this field will be swimming with more mistakes. Still, we thank you for your help.
