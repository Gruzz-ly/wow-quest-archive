This is the final quest associated with leveling up Pandarian [[cooking]], transitioning the chef from an apprentice to a master. It becomes available after maximizing the skill in all six "Ways" taught by the Ironpaws at [[Halfhill Market]].

==Objectives==
Make Black Pepper Steak, Sea Mist Rice Noodles, Mogu Fish Stew, Steamed Crab, Chun Tian Spring Roll and Mad Brewer's Breakfast, then return to the Guide to the Ways.
*Cook [[Black Pepper Ribs and Shrimp]]
*Cook [[Sea Mist Rice Noodles]]
*Cook [[Mogu Fish Stew]]
*Cook [[Steamed Crab Surprise]]
*Cook [[Chun Tian Spring Rolls]]
*Cook [[Mad Brewer's Breakfast]]

==Description==
There will come a day when you have mastered all that we have to teach you. When that day comes, it will be time for you to teach others in turn. When you have proven to yourself that you have mastered all the Ways, come back and speak with me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14||}} (or {{cost|1|98|50|}} at max level)
*23,600 [[XP]]
*[[Ironpaw Token]] (10)

==Progress==
There will come a day when you must pass knowledge onto others, as we have passed knowledge onto you.

==Completion==
You have been a great student. Now you should share your knowledge with others. I hope you will speak with the Stock Master and take on an apprentice as soon as you can.

==Notes==
While this quest normally requires maximizing all six cooking styles, increasing cooking skill to the maximum level of 75 Pandaria Cooking (or 600 Zen Master Cooking in [[Classic]]) via the [[Darkmoon Faire]] quest [[Putting the Crunch in the Frog]] can bypass this requirement.

==Progression==
{{So You Want to Be a Chef...}}

Completing this opens up [[Nomi]]'s daily quests by allowing purchase of the [[Cooking School Bell]].
