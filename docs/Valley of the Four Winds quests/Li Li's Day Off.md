*Bring Li Li to the [[Silken Fields]] {{co|61.8|59.0|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*Bring Li Li to [[New Cifera]]
*Bring Li Li to [[Huangtze Falls]] {{co|74.9|42.6|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
[[Chen Stormstout|Uncle Chen]] asked me not to get into any fights while he was away... but that doesn't mean I can't go exploring. Finally, a chance to look around [[Pandaria]] without stopping every forty-seven steps for another rest!

You want to come with me? I'll bet there's all kinds of cool places we can visit, not too far away from here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You ready to go out yet?

==Completion==
That was great! You and I should go exploring again sometime.

And it looks like we finished before Uncle Chen got back, too. Perfect.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Li Li
* I can't believe Uncle Chen would rather sit down and drink beer than walk around and explore this place!
* Are you seeing all this stuff?  This place is great!
* Thanks for taking me out exploring with you, <name>.

{{gossip|Why aren't you helping me fight things?}}

Because Uncle Chen made me promise not to!

Listen, Chen may be a stupid, boring, lazy, fat old uncle, but that doesn't mean that I don't respect him.  He told me not to get into any trouble, and I'm not about to ignore him.

Besides, you seem to be doing just fine on your own.  You don't need a little girl to help you kill things.

Pick up [[Muddy Water]] before heading out. Li Li provides a Wishing-Stone to summon her in case she gets separated from the adventurer.  Li Li will comment on the quests mentioned in this guide as you accept them and turn them in.

The closest location is to the east up the [[Yan-Zhe River]] to the [[Huangtze Falls]].
:{{text|say|Li Li|Hey! Look at that waterfall!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I wonder if there's a cave behind it.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|You should always check behind waterfalls for caves.}}

No cave behind this waterfall, so head just a bit downstream and complete [[Muddy Water]].  After that, optionally head northwest to [[Halfhill]] for the breadcrumb quest [[Got Silk?]].  Then, return southeast (or, if you skipped the breadcrumb quest, go west from the river) to find the [[Silken Fields]]:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Check out all the cool silk!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Do you think that they really get this stuff from the silkworms' rear end?}}
:''She walks over to the feeding pit.''
:{{text|say|Li Li|Eww... they look like maggots.}}
Speak with [[Silkmaster Tsai]] to pick up a side quest, [[Where Silk Comes From]]. Journeyman Chu just to the northwest offers [[The Moth Rebellion]]. That is quickly followed up by [[Mothallus!]].

Finally, head to [[New Cifera]], which is also a quest hub.
:{{text|say|Li Li|Look at this!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|There's a village up here... and a big fish statue, too.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|You think the [[jinyu]] built this place?}}
{{NPC||Clever Ashyo}} is here as well. Feel free to turn in [[Clever Ashyo (quest)]], and pick up [[Ashyo's Vision]], as well as the side quests [[Bottletoads]], [[Watery Woes (quest)]], and [[Snap Judgment]] while at New Cifera.

Upon engaging [[Krosh]].
:{{text|say|Li Li|Look how big and ugly he is!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|It's a good thing my Uncle Chen told me not to get into any fights, otherwise you'd be dead meat, turtle!}}
:{{text|yell|Li Li|Are you listening to me, turtle?}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Look, here he comes now! How was the brewery, uncle?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Bah! I do not want to talk about it.}}

Speak with him to continue.

=== Li Li's area commentary ===
;[[Gilded Fan]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|Are you seeing this, <name>?}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|This place is like... ALL puddles.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I love puddles! No wonder all these birds like to hang out here.}}

;[[Halfhill]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|Huh! This must be where all those farmers sell their fruits, and vegetables, and grains, and beer.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I wonder if Uncle came through here on his way to the brewery.}}

;[[Halfhill Market]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|Can we buy something? I'm hungry.}}
:''Li Li runs over to [[Anthea Ironpaw]]'s stand and scarfs something down.''
:{{text|emote|Li Li burps.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|OK! Not hungry anymore. Let's keep exploring.}}

;[[Heartland]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|I'll bet they grow enough food here to feed pretty much everybody on Pandaria.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|It's just too bad that it's all vegetables. Why no giant meat?}}

;[[Imperial Granary]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|Oh cool! This must be where they store the grain for all the beer they make at that brewery.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I can't wait until I'm older, so I can finally find out what beer tastes like.}}
:{{text|emote|Li Li smiles and glances about nervously.}}

;[[Paoquan Hollow]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|Hey, where did this weird jungle come from?}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|It's just like, all of a sudden, out of nowhere... BOOM. Super-thick jungle.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|And it's kind of scary, too.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Well? Are we going in, or what?}}

;Paoquan Hollow - {{NPC||Master Bruised Paw||Master Bruised Paw's}} house
:{{text|say|Li Li|Someone LIVES back here?}}

;[[Pools of Purity]]
:{{text|say|Lotus Farmer|Hm... don't get many <class> up this way...}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Back off, flower-head. That's MY <class> you're talking about!}}

;[[Stoneplow]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|Check this place out!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|You know what, <name>?}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|You're way cooler than Uncle Chen.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Uncle Chen and I spent weeks wandering around that [[Jade Forest]], and all we saw were trees... and [[Serpent's Heart|ONE cool serpent thing]].}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I've only spent a day with you, and we've already seen this entire valley.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I guess what I'm saying is... thanks.}}

;[[Stormstout Brewery]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|Here it is: the Stormstout Brewery.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I'll bet Uncle Chen is inside, meeting our distant relatives, as we speak.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|That's exactly what I need... even MORE boring old uncles.}}

;[[Sunsong Ranch]]
:{{text|say|Li Li|Look at this! A little farm, right in the middle of a town.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Who would think to start a farm in the middle of a town? Hah!}}
