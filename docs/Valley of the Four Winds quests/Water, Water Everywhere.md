==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wing Nga]] to borrow a kite, then throw water onto 35 Dusty Spots in the [[Heartland]].
*Dusty Spots watered (35)

==Description==
How'd you like to make yourself useful?

The season's been awful dry lately. I need someone to water the crops out in the Heartland. Here's the thing: I need you to water ALL of the crops.

I keep a few kites with Wing Nga, the [[flightmaster]] across the way. Grab one of those kites, then throw water on any areas that look dry and dusty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+2000 [[reputation]] with [[Farmer Fung]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Just come back when you're done. And don't break any of my kites.

==Completion==
Hmph! I knew you were a good waterer when I first saw you. You've got good watering arms.

==Notes==
No trek to [[Kunzen Village]] or [[Springtail Crag]] required for this bombing run!

Head east out of the market to [[Wing Nga]], the flight master of [[Halfhill]]:
