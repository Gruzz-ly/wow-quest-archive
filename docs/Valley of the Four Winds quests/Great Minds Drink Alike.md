*Escort Chen and Li Li

==Description==
Hello again, <name>. What is this, the fourth time we've run into one another already?

Say... my keg is quickly becoming quite empty. I've heard mention of a brewery to the southwest, and that's where we're headed. Care to join us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|10}}
*64000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
If yer lookin' fer beer, you came to the right place, neighbor.

Just, ah... excuse the mess. Had me a bit of a problem with [[virmen]] the last few days.

==Notes==
Speak to him again.
:Greetings, <name>.  Are you as thirsty as I am?
:{{gossip|''I'm ready.  Let's hit the road.''}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Alright.  I suppose we have stayed here long enough.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|These Thunderfoots are good people, but they do not have enough ale between them to fill a cask.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Let's go find something to drink.  Shall we, Li Li?}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|If beer gets you off your butt, then... sure.  Let's go find you some beer.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Farewell, Shang!}}
:{{text|yell|Shang Thunderfoot|You kids have fun at Mudmug's!  And thanks again, <name>!}}
:''They start running down the path to the southwest, but see a male pandaren standing on the rise off to the side of the road in the distance.''
:{{text|say|Li Li|Uncle, look. There's somebody up ahead.  He looks... weird.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|We are the outsiders here, Li Li.  We probably look even weirder to him.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Pshh... only because we're traveling with this <race>!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Sorry, <name>, but you do kind of stand out.}}
:{{RaceIcon|Pandaren2|Male}}{{RaceIcon|Pandaren2|Female}} {{text|say|Li Li|What? We're all pandaren here! Just because we came from the turtle doesn't mean we look weird.}}
:{{RaceIcon|Pandaren2|Male}}{{RaceIcon|Pandaren2|Female}} {{text|say|Li Li|Well, <name> looks a little weird. Sorry <name>.}}
:''They reach the stranger, who is labeled "Mudmug".''
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Hallloooo stranger!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|We are looking for a brewer named Mudmug.  Do you know of him?}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|I'm Mudmug.  Who's asking?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I am called Chen, and this is my niece Li Li.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Hmph. Y'all any good at fightin' virmen?}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Heck yeah we are!  I've probably beaten up about a million virmen back on the [[Wandering Isle]]!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|You have a virmen problem?  We will be glad to help you, Mudmug.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Awright then!  My place is just around the corner.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Come on!  Let's get to that critter-whompin'!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I TOLD you he was weird.}}

Follow them to Mudmug's place and turn in. Mudmug has some gossip text:
:Greetin's! And, ah... salutations, I suppose.
:Sorry. Not quite sure what to say. I'm not used to havin' much in the way of company around here.
:That is, not unless they're here to buy some o' my brew, of course.
:{{gossip|''So, you're a homebrewer?''}}
:Yup. Been brewin' beer since I could drink it.
:Some folks say I'm wastin' my time, that I could just buy the beer that comes out o' that big ol' brewery down yonder, but... I dunno.  There's somethin' right nice about brewin' your own mug of ale.
:{{gossip|''Is Mudmug your real name?''}}
:Aw, heck no. That's just how I make my beer.
:Muddy water you see... it's got little bugs in it, that ferment your ale for you.  Some folks use real yeast, grown in a fancy brewery under controlled conditions and what have you.  I use muddy water.
:It's kind of my thing.
:I guess I'm just not what you'd call "cultured".
:{{gossip|''Ha ha.''}}

Chen and Li Li offer the next quests.
