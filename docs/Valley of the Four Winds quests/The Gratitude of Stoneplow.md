==Objectives==
Find [[the Commander's Cache]] and collect your reward.

==Description==
One last thing, <name>. Don't worry, it's not another favor. You've killed enough [[mantid]] today.

We recently received a shipment of high-quality armor from [[Kun-Lai Summit]]. I was planning to keep them for [[Shado-Pan|my men]]... but I can't think of anybody more deserving than you. You'll find them on the second floor of [[Stone Mug Tavern|the inn]], [[Stoneplow|here in town]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 419 boots
|Nayeli Treads
|Mortbreath Footguards
|Deepwild Sabatons
|Narsong Greaves
|Angkhal Treads
|Riverblade Boots
|Sarjun Sabatons
|Korjan Warboots
|Dojani Warboots}}

You will also receive:
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Peering inside, you find...

==Notes==
Upstairs in the inn.

The phase changes on complete—the friendly NPCs and the mantid are all gone, and Oakenshield and Loon Mai are back at their normal spots.

You can also find a large paper document nailed to the stair support strut of [[Stone Mug Tavern]], labeled "The Attack on Stoneplow".  Clicking on it allows the player to view the cutscene of when the mantid first breached the wall (although currently, the dead colossus will still be visible).  The one difference is that since the player is part of it, they will be shown wearing their current set of gear, and not what they were wearing when they did the quest.
