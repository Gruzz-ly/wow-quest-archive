*[[Barrel of Fireworks]] (provided)

==Description==
The hozen steal from us, and we keep stealing our stuff back. It has to stop sometime.

<[[Farmer Yoon]] hands you a barrel of fireworks.>

Find some of our stolen supplies in their mountain camp to the west, and place these fireworks beside them. Hopefully, if they see the explosions, they'll think our supplies are defective and stop stealing altogether.

It's worth a shot, right?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
* 236000 XP
* +275 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Good luck up there, <name>.

==Completion==
Hopefully they're put off from stealing any more of our supplies. I know I personally wouldn't want to drink any explosive beer, or use an explosive rake.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

Fly out to the [[Kunzen Village]] up on the [[Skyrange]]. Look for the object piles. Note that the Stolen Brew Kegs that can be targeted and have health are not the correct units for this quest.
