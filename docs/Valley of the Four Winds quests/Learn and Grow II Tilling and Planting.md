==Objectives==
Till 2 plots of Untilled Soil to create Tilled Soil. Then, use the EZ-Gro Green Cabbage Seeds on 2 plots of Tilled Soil.
*Soil Tilled (2)
*EZ-Gro Green Cabbage Seeds Planted (2)
*[[EZ-Gro Green Cabbage Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
Okay, now we've got our seeds, it's time to plant them.

First, we have to prepare the soil! You gotta till the soil and break it up to make a nice bed for our little sprouts.

Till those two plots of soil over there, then plant the seeds in them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 112900 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Well, go ahead - bust that soil up and plant the seeds!

You aren't giving up already are you? I need your help!

==Completion==
Nicely done.

Notice how those seeds sprouted immediately? That's part of what makes this valley so ideal for farming - something about the soil here just makes veggies grow like crazy!

The work's not done yet, though.

==Notes==
Head just a few yards to the northeast, click on the two Untilled Soil spots, use the [[EZ-Gro Green Cabbage Seeds]], then click on the two Tilled Soil spots.
