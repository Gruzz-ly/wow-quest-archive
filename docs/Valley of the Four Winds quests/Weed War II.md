Speaking to [[Gai Lan]]:
{{dialogue|
Well, aren't you going to pick the weeds?

{{gossip|What weeds?}}
}}

This applies Weed War, a three-minute tracking buff, and starts the quest event.
{{dialogue|class=plainlist|
*{{text|yell|Gai Lan|Look, there's a weed now! Go pull it!}}
*{{text|bossemote|Click on weeds to pull them!}}
*{{text|yell|Gai Lan|Some more weeds, over here!}}
*{{text|yell|Gai Lan|Keep it up, you're doing great!}}
}}

Some time later, little weeds start popping up:
{{dialogue|class=plainlist|
*{{text|say|Gai Lan|Just stomp on those little weeds. No need to waste your time picking them.}}
*{{text|bossemote|Walk over small weeds!}}
}}

Later:
{{dialogue|class=plainlist|
*{{text|say|Gai Lan|Here, I've got some spare Weed-B-Gone. This should help.}}
*{{text|bossemote|Pick up the Weed-B-Gone!}}
}}
Run over, pick it up, then use the new bonus action button to bring up the targeting reticle. Aim for as many weeds as possible.

Later:
{{dialogue|
{{text|yell|Gai Lan|Look out!}}
}}
Giant weed tentacles pop up and start knocking the player around. They can still be clicked on to be removed—no need to dismount to damage them. Or hit them with the Weed-B-Gone. Move quickly, as the buff is starting to run out by now.

Gai Lan will repeatedly toss more Weed-B-Gone on the ground:
{{dialogue|
{{text|yell|Gai Lan|Here's some more Weed-B-Gone!}}
}}

On success:
{{dialogue|
{{text|say|Gai Lan|Looks like things are finally starting to calm down.}}
}}
