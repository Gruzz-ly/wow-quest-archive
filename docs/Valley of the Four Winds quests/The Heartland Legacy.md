== Objectives ==
Take Old Man Thistle's Almanac to [[Seedkeeper Shing Sing]] at [[Halfhill]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].
* [[Old Man Thistle's Almanac]] (provided)

== Description ==
At the very bottom of the treasure chest, you find a stack of scrolls and a soft leather sack with seeds.

Unrolling the scrolls, you see they contain detailed farming notes, drawings of plants, numbers and calculations, locations of nearby water springs, and countless other snippets.

There might be someone at the Tillers Union who would like to see this.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|19|84|50}}

== Progress ==
What do you have there?

== Completion ==
Ah yes, I know the story of Old Man Thistle quite well, <race>.

There are all sorts of crazy tales about his quest for treasure.

But the truth of the matter is that he was a bit of a recluse, a bit eccentric, and an excellent farmer.

As he grew near the end of his life, he retreated up into the mountains and was never seen again.

He was just a man, and it seems that you have found his legacy.

But don't tell [[Fish Fellreed|Fish]] the truth. Some stories are best left tall in the telling.

== Notes ==
Keep circling around to the northeast for a shortcut back to the mouth of the cave. Hopefully the rocks can be interacted with once again to exit the cave. If not, it is possible to die close to the wall and run back from the outside and resurrect on the other side. Fly back to Halfhill and speak with {{NPC||Seedkeeper Shing Sing}}, hidden inside the peak of Halfhill.

Upon completing this quest, it will award the achievement [[Ain't Lost No More]].
:{{text|say|Seedkeeper Shing Sing|This is... remarkable, <name>! These notes provide invaluable knowledge to our farmers. We are truly in Old Man Thistle's debt for keeping such records, and in your debt for recovering them. Thank you!}}
