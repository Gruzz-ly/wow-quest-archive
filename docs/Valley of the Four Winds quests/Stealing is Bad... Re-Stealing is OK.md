==Objectives==
Re-steal 16 Stolen Vegetables.
*[[Stolen Vegetable]] (16)

==Description==
The [[hozen]], up in the mountains to the west, continue to steal vegetables from my fellow farmers. Being so close to [[Halfhill]], I very rarely suffer hozen attacks, but my friends have not been so lucky.

Seems to me like they steal way more than they can eat. If you can find any intact vegetables up there in those mountains... steal them back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+275 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Have you got them?

==Completion==
Thanks! I'll make sure these are distributed out to my fellow farmers.

==Notes==
Pick up the other daily quests before heading out.

Fly up to [[Kunzen Village]] on the [[Skyrange]] to the west of the [[Heartland]]. Stolen vegetables can be found in groups of 3-4 all over the ground. They will typically be guarded, so watch out.

Wrap up the other daily quests before heading back.
