*Harvest Ripe Juicycrunch Carrots (2)
*[[Juicycrunch Carrot]] (10)

==Description==
Mung-Mung don't care who steals carrots. Only care what [[Haohan Mudclaw|Mr. Mudclaw]] does to poor Mung-Mung when he finds his crop is ruined!

<Mung-Mung rubs his chin thoughtfully.>

Wait! Mung-Mung have bright idea. You go and grow some juicycrunch carrots. Then, we take your carrots and pretend they are Mr. Mudclaw's.

Yes!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}

*+400 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
[[Virmen]]s love carrots, but they hate turnips. I hate turnips, too.

==Completion==
Whoa, these carrots look crunchy and juicy, <name>! Mung-Mung did not know you had such a green thumb.

==Notes==
[[File:Mung-Mung's Vote III - finale.jpg|thumb|Mung-Mung and Yoon.]]
Purchase two [[Juicycrunch Carrot Seeds]], plant them, do whatever it takes to get them growing, then come back tomorrow to harvest them.

If you happen to have already planted two carrots the day before, those will also count for harvesting carrots.  You will then only have to plant two more in their place.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|Mung-Mung impressed, <name>.  You help me without asking for anything in return.  That's what being a Tiller is all about.  I'll meet you back on your farm.  Mung-Mung will give you his vote.}}

At Sunsong Ranch:
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Hey, isn't that Mung-Mung coming up the road?}}
:''Mung-Mung walks up from the road entrance to Sungsong Ranch, waving as he greets Yoon.''
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|Hey Yoonie!  It's me, Mung-Mung!}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Hello Mung-Mung.  How's everything at Mr. Mudclaw's farm?}}
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|Terrible, but don't tell him I said so.  [[Virmen|Vermin]] is running everywhere.  Crops ain't growing.  And something keeps eating the harvest.}}
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|But your farm is lookin' pretty good.  You know if you make friends with the folks around here, they might give you stuff to fancy it up even more.}}
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|Anyway, I just came by to thank you for those carrots.}}
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|They was real crunchy, and Haohan thought they were his best crop yet!  Haha!}}
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|You ain't so bad, Yoonie.  Here's my vote.}}
:''Mung-Mung walks over to the offering bowls and sticks incense in the second bowl.''
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|See ya later!}}
:''Mung-Mung runs back down to the road to head back to work.''
