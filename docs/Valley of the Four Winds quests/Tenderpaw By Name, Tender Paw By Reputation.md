==Objectives==
Gather 18 Jademoon Leaves.
*[[Jademoon Leaf]] (18)

==Description==
I'd like to go tell [[Xiao]], [[Kang Bramblestaff|Kang]], and the others that I've found the [[Master Bruised Paw|hidden master]], but now he won't let me leave! He says I have to pass that test of bamboo first.

<Lin whispers:> How'd you do that, by the way?

It looks like, for the time being, I'm stuck here practicing my punches against this rock. And my knuckles are about to cave in.

If you could gather some jademoon leaves, I could prepare an ointment and at least numb some of this pain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 XP

==Progress==
Ow! Ow! Ow!

==Completion==
<Lin pauses for a moment to rub the leaves on her swollen paws.>

Thank you! I can prepare a proper ointment later, but this will do for now.

==Notes==
Pick up [[They Will Be Mist]] and [[Fog Wards]] before heading out.

Mist horrors are all over the area. Try to kite them to any of the three wards and light the ward to nigh-instantly kill them. Leaves can be found on rocks near trees.
