== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Cornan.jpg|Cornan the Barley Barbarian|What happens when a [[forest sprite]] gets their hands on Pan's Miracle Gro formula.}}
Defeat Cornan the Barley Barbarian.
*[[Cornan]] slain {{co|51.4|64.5|Valley of the Four Winds}}

== Description ==
Just to be clear, what happened was an accident. What I did, I did for INDUSTRY!

There was no way I could have known that a [[sprite]] invasion would happen at any time, or that one of them would try to eat my new "Pan's Miracle Gro" formula.

Now not only do they have a big sprite leading them, but he's one angry beast.

If I pay you, will you take him out?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Oh why? Why did I have to tamper with the natural order of things? All I wanted was to make these grains grow faster and more numerous.

== Completion ==
Now that that's over I have some ideas on how to make a new concoction. We'll see.

Thank you for your help. Here is your reward.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Taste Test]] and [[Wee Little Shenanigans]] before heading out.

Grain for Taste Test appears in big sacks on the ground. The regular sprites are on grain piles outside. The named is inside the building.
