==Objectives==
Speak to [[Gai Lan]] at [[Heartland|The Heartland]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

==Description==
Hey <name>, I've been thinkin' recently about expanding my farm.

See that plot there that's just covered in weeds? If we can get rid of those weeds, we could use that land for planting.

I heard there's a farmer by the name of Gai Lan who knows a thing or two about weed whackin'.

His farm is just out west. Go talk to him and see if he'd be willing to help us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Completion==
Oh yeah, [[Farmer Yoon]]. I've seen him around town.

Seems like a nice enough fella.

==Notes==
Head west, to the southwest part of the [[Heartland]]. [[Gai Lan]] is still perched on the rock he was at for [[Weed War]].

==Progression==
{{Tillers Honored}}
