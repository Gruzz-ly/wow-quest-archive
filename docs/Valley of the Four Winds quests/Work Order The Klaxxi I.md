== Objectives ==
Plant 8 Mogu Pumpkin Seeds on [[Sunsong Ranch]].
*Plant [[Mogu Pumpkin Seeds]] x8

== Description ==
<Though Yoon's writing leaves something to be desired, it's nice to still have a little piece of him on the farm.>

An order came in this morning from the [[Klaxxi]]. Strangely enough they are requesting [[Mogu Pumpkin]]s for some kind of research.

I find it's best not to ask them too many questions...

Best get started on their order. I'd hate to see what a bug of that size could do to your crops if you don't!

== Completion ==
Well, that's all you can do today! Now to wait for the harvest.

Your crops need only to be tended and prepared for packing tomorrow.

== Notes ==
Plant 8 [[Mogu Pumpkin Seeds]]. Consider using a [[Bag of Mogu Pumpkin Seeds]] to plant 4 at a time!
