== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Loon Mai}} at [[Stoneplow]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

== Description ==
I'm going to withdraw what few forces I have. We may have to fall back to the [[Stormstout Brewery]], or even Halfhill. That call is Commander Loon Mai's to make.

You go ahead. Deliver word to the Commander. My [[Shado-Pan]] will be shortly behind.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|2}}

== Completion ==
I see.

Well, we gave it our all. It's time to evacuate, save lives, and reassess our strategy, before these mantid take over the entire valley.

== Gains ==
* 12900 XP

== Notes ==
Run back to the main part of Stoneplow.

On complete:
