==Objectives==
Speak with [[Li Li]] at the [[Imperial Granary]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

==Description==
I'll let you in on my brewing plan, <name>: I'm planning on making an [["The Emperor"|Emperor Stout]]. Done right, it should be dark, roasty, and high in alcohol.

<A frown appears on [[Chen Stormstout|Chen]]'s face.>

I just realized... I never told my plans to Li Li. She'll have no idea what type of grain to bring back!

Could you speak with her? I need her to bring back the sweetest malted grains she can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>? What are you doing here?

So, Uncle Chen wants sweet malts? No problem! Let's get to the taste testing.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hop Hunting]] and [[Doesn't Hold Water]] before heading out. Head north out of Halfhill up the path to run across Mudmug. Turn in and pick up [[The Great Water Hunt]] and [[Barreling Along]] from him. Then, head through the [[Heartland]] to do the farmers' quests for Hop Hunting. Finally, head south of Halfhill to the [[Imperial Granary]] to find Li Li.
