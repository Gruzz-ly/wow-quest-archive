==Objectives==
Plant and harvest 1 Scallion, then deliver 5 Scallions to [[Gina Mudclaw]].

[[Scallion Seeds]] can be purchased from [[Merchant Greenfield]] at [[Halfhill Market]]. After tilling and tending your plant, you must wait until the next day to harvest ripe Scallions.
*Plant Scallion Seeds
*Harvest Ripe Scallions
*[[Scallions]] (5)

==Description==
My business is doomed! You see all of the Ironpaws at their cooking stations?

Their tasty dishes draw many of the customers to this market, but they're all out of scallions!

It may not look like much, but the scallion is an essential cooking ingredient. Without it, foods are less savory, less flavorful, and less aromatic.

This is terrible. I'm not getting another scallion shipment for a week!

Wait a second. You're a farmer, aren't you? You think you could help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*112900 [[XP]]
*+1400 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]
*+6000 reputation with [[Gina Mudclaw]]

==Progress==
Don't overlook the scallion. It may be small and innocuous, but it creates truly marvelous flavors.

==Completion==
Well, I'll be! I've certainly seen larger scallions, but this will do quite nicely. You've just saved our hides, <name>!

==Notes==
Buy a pack of [[Scallion Seeds]] from Greenfield, run to the farm, till some soil, plant it, and do whatever's necessary to make them grow, then come back tomorrow.

:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Make sure to tend to those scallions.  After that, nothing to do but wait until tomorrow when they'll be nice and ripe.}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Come walk with me, <name>. I would like to pay Farmer Yoon a visit.}}
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|You know, you sure saved my hide with those scallions.}}
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Cooks are always looking for fresh vegetables. Anything you grow on your farm, you can use for cooking or sell to other cooks.}}
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Talk to any of the Ironpaws at the market if you want to improve your own cooking skill.}}
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Hey Farmer Yoon!}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Hey Gina! Didn't expect a visit from you.}}
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Listen, since you two did such a good turn by helping me out, I'm casting the first vote to help you join the Tillers.}}
:''Gina walks over to the first Offering Bowl and kneels in front of it, placing her vote - a burning incense stick - into it.''
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|There are four other votes you'll need to get, but that'll come in time.}}

;Pre-lvl90
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Settle yourselves in first. You'll be able to farm your fields, but I'm afraid you're too inexperienced to continue further.  Once you've seen more of [[Pandaria]], be sure to stop by.}}
;Lvl 90
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Settle yourselves in first. You'll be able to farm your fields, but I'm afraid you're still too inexperienced to help the folks at the market. Once you're stronger, be sure to stop by.}}
;{{rep|Honored}}
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Settle yourselves in and come by the market any day if you are looking for work.}}

:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Welcome to The Heartland!}}
:''Gina heads back to the market.''

The [[Tillers Shrine]] is now enabled, and will report on relationship status with the ten named NPCs.
