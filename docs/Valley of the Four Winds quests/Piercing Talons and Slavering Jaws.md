==Objectives==
[[File:Thieving Plainshawk.jpg|thumb|[[Thieving Plainshawk]].]]
[[File:Thieving Wolf.jpg|thumb|[[Thieving Wolf]].]]
Kill 5 Thieving Plainshawks and 6 Thieving Wolves.
*[[Thieving Plainshawk]] slain (5)
*[[Thieving Wolf]] slain (6)

==Description==
First the hawks came. You've probably seen some of them circling up above.

The wolves came shortly after. I think they smelled my weakness.

I'm not nearly as brave as Master Shang thought I was. The master will be quite cross with me if I don't do something about these beasts.

Can... can you help, <sir/ma'am>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|70}}
*97000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wish I were brave enough to fight them, but...

==Completion==
They... they're not stopping, but at least we fought back. Right?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Lupello (quest)]] before heading out. Head southeast and start killing. Lupello is on the other bank of the river just past the bridge. He is a level 86 wolf with 368,000 health and counts as a kill for the slavering jaws quest as well. He does not have a tap, so as long as some damage is inflicted, kill credit will be granted.

On completion of both:
:{{text|say|Francis the Shepherd Boy|Uh-oh... here comes the master now...}}
:''Shang Thunderfoot walks up.''
:{{text|say|Shang Thunderfoot|Francis! We need to talk!}}
He offers the next quest.
