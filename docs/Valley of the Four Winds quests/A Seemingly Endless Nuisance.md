==Description==
I apologize for the state of things around here. The [[virmen]] - those rabbity creatures, down the hill - have been pushing further and further into my family's farm, and our crops - which are normally bigger, and more delicious, by the way - have been suffering because of it.

I'm no soldier... but you might be! Would you mind pushing some of these virmen off of our land?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{itembox|Item level 399 legs
|Silkmasters' Satin Leggings
|Sunsoaked Legguards
|Huangtze Scale Leggings
|Paoquan Burnished Legplates
|Gilded Fan Silk Trousers
|Plainshawk Legguards
|Wild Plains Legguards
|Thunderfoot Heavy Legguards
|Sunsong Armored Legguards}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 XP

==Progress==
Have you pushed the virmen out yet, <class>? We need to bring in our crops soon, or they'll be lost for sure.

==Completion==
<Pang surveys the area around his farm.>

Well, they're not ALL gone yet, but there's less of them. And they aren't holding their ears quite as high anymore.

I'd guess they're scared of you, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Poor Grasp of the Basics]] before heading out.

Plenty of killing and gathering just away from the quest givers. Look around for Chattering Dirt Piles and interact with them. Five [[Virmen Pesterer]]s will pop out, weak level 86 [[virmen]] with 36,870 health.
