Bring the Exquisite Earring to [[Tina Mudclaw]] at Haohan's House or [[Halfhill Market]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].
*[[Exquisite Earring]] (provided)

==Description==
You unhook the earring off the furry creature's ear. It looks like he was having some fun wearing the dangly hoop. TOO much fun.

Perhaps the owner of this dainty bauble would like to see it returned. You don't have to tell her where you found it... or who was wearing it.

* 236000 [[XP]]
* +3750 [[reputation]] with [[Tina Mudclaw]]

==Completion==
Oh my earring! Why, it matches the one I'm wearing today!

<Tina hooks the earring onto her ear.>

Thank you, <name>!

==Notes==
Drops from any [[hozen]] on [[Skyrange]].
