==Objectives==
Speak to [[Haohan Mudclaw]] in [[Heartland|The Heartland]] or at [[Halfhill Market]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

==Description==
Now that we're officially members of the Tillers Union, Mr. Mudclaw said he'd be happy to help us upturn this big ole' rock in the middle of our field.

Once we clear away that stone, I've got something special planned.

Run down and give him a holler to let him know that we're ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yoon needs a neighbour to lend a hand, eh? Well I'll be happy to oblige.

''Complete:''
: {{text|say|Haohan Mudclaw|You go on ahead. I just need to get Thunder ready and I'll meet you at Sunsong Ranch in a jiffy.}}

==Notes==
At {{rep|exalted}} with the [[Tillers]], and once you have finished the questline for Haohan's vote, Yoon will offer this quest.  Regardless whether you got the vote, Yoon also sends a letter via the in-game mail system:
{{book|A Letter From Farmer Yoon|content=Wow, <name>!

I can't believe we did it!  We are real, actual members of The Tillers!  I could never have done it without you.  You should feel real proud!

Well, I couldn't get along without you anymore, so you should consider Sunsong Ranch yours just as much as it's mine.  Glad to have you on the farm, partner!

Anyways, it's high time we clear out that big boulder that's been blocking our last field.  Also, [[Gina Mudclaw|Gina]] keeps talking my ear off about this new tool she'll sell me, but only after we get that boulder out.

Oh, and I'm sending you some seeds I picked up at the market.  Come back soon and plant them!

Your friend,<br/>
Farmer Yoon}}

Attached is a [[Basic Seed Pack]] which contains two sets of two seeds.


It takes 15 minutes for [[Haohan Mudclaw]] to upgrade the [[Sunsong Ranch]] to a 4x4 plot of land. A buff will appear to display how long is left on the upgrade.  Remember that you MUST return to the farm to have the two spawn and start the upgrade.  You will also have to remain online until they finish.
