[[File:Kunzen Ritualist.jpg|thumb|[[Kunzen Ritualist]].]]
Throw 8 Kunzen Ritual Candles, kick 4 Blazing Embers, and slay 1 Kunzen Ritualist.
*Kuzen Ritual Candle thrown
*Blazing Ember kicked
*[[Kunzen Ritualist]] slain

==Description==
I've been watching those Kunzen hozen, and I've noticed a consistent pattern. Whenever they're getting ready to attack, they participate in strange, barbaric rituals around their totem.

If we can disrupt this ritual, not only will we put off any impending attacks, we can deal a huge blow to their morale! So get in there, rough them up, and make as much of a mess as possible!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+2000 [[reputation]] with [[Sho]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
What are you waiting for? Get up there and have some fun!

==Completion==
Hah! They'll be cleaning that mess up for days.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out. Fly up to the [[Skyrange]], south of the [[Kunzen Village]], to find the large hozen totem, eye-beaming a figure eight around a large rock and a huge cookpot. Candles litter the area and blazing embers appear in the trail of the eyebeam. Several ritualists are also in the area.
