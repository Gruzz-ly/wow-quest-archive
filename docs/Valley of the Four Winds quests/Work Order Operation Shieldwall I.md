== Objectives ==
Plant 8 Witchberry Seeds on [[Sunsong Ranch]].
*Plant [[Witchberry Seeds]] x8

== Description ==
<Yoon's writing decorates the page though his feelings seem conflicted.>

I normally try to stay out of conflict, but an order is an order. Since you are of the [[Alliance]] I decided to pass this order your way.

[[Operation: Shieldwall]] has requested a whole heap of [[Witchberries]].

I can't be sure, but I think they have an idea to use them in some sort of weapon.

== Completion ==
Well, that's all you can do today! Now to wait for the harvest.

Your crops need only to be tended and prepared for packing tomorrow.

== Notes ==
Plant 8 [[Witchberry Seeds]]. Consider using a [[Bag of Witchberry Seeds]] to plant 4 at a time!
