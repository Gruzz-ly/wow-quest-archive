==Objectives==
Bring Krosh's Back to [[Yan]] in [[New Cifera]].
*[[Krosh's Back]] (provided)

==Description==
<This [[dragon turtle]]'s massive shell is rock hard and covered in sharp edges. One of the locals could almost certainly make use of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My MY now look at THIS! What a beautiful shell!

You were wise to bring this to me, my friend. It will make a fantastic serving platter.

Please, take this for your troubles.

==Notes==
Up at the top level of the [[Pools of Purity]] for [[Bottletoads]] and [[Snap Judgment]], keep an eye out for [[Krosh]] at the northeast corner of the plateau. He is a level 86 dragon turtle with 368,000 health. Kill him, loot [[Krosh's Back]], then go back to questing before returning to [[New Cifera]] to turn in.

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Look how big and ugly he is!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|It's a good thing my Uncle Chen told me not to get into any fights, otherwise you'd be dead meat, turtle!}}
:{{text|yell|Li Li|Are you listening to me, turtle?}}

While out and about in the [[Gilded Fan]], up in the northwest corner is a named [[crocolisk]], [[Manglemaw]]. Kill it to spawn his mother, [[Manglemaw's Mother]]. She drops an [[Enormous Crocolisk Tail]], which starts [[A Crocolisk Tale]].
