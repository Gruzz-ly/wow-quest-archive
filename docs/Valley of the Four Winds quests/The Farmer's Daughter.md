==Objectives==
Find [[Mina Mudclaw]]. {{co|41.3|38.2|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
Brave <class>, you could not have arrived at a better time. My daughter is missing!

I've got a suspicion that the [[virmen]] took her down into that stinking little warren of theirs. I'm too old to fight virmen, and [[Mung-Mung|my farmhand]] is already exhausted from fighting them off all morning.

Could you look for her?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
No... no... get back... I don't want...

Wait, you're not a carrot. You're not a [[virmen]] either. You're here to save me?

==Notes==
Out and about for [[Hop Hunting]], head north to the Fruited Fields to find [[Gardener Fran]], then keep heading west along the path to find [[Den Mudclaw]] and [[Mung-Mung]]. Den offers this quest. Pick up [[Enough is Ookin' Enough]] before heading out.

Just to the southwest is a mouth to a virmen warren. Kill virmen and head inside. Don't focus on getting 100 teeth before finding Mina Mudclaw, inside the warren on top of the gigantic carrot, being forced to perform actions with... disturbing connotations with carrots. Immediately turn this quest in and pick up [[Seeing Orange]]. There will be plenty to kill on the way back out and on the surface.
