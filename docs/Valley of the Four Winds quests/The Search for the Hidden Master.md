==Objectives==
Listen to [[Xiao]] and his companions.

==Description==
Oh, hello. Are you looking for the owner of this place? Then look to the pandaren up at the top of the stairs.

I'm just a visitor... like you.

Now if you'll excuse me, my friends and I are trying to decide something. We can talk again afterwards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Were you listening in? Don't worry, I don't mind. You're welcome to search for the hidden master as well.

Though, if you do find him, I'd appreciate if you came back here and told me where he was.

==Notes==
;Before accept
:{{Text|say|Xiao|So, friends... how are we going to find the hidden master?}}

;On accept
:{{text|say|[[Lin Tenderpaw]]|So... do any of you know where the hidden master lives?}}
:{{text|say|Xiao|I'm pretty sure that's why he's called the hidden master, Lin.}}
:{{text|say|Lin Tenderpaw|Oh. Sorry.}}
:{{text|say|Lin Tenderpaw|So, where should we search first?}}
:{{text|say|[[Clever Ashyo]]|I can try asking the streams for guidance...}}
:{{text|say|[[Kang Bramblestaff]]|Ask the streams? You're no elder, Ashyo. You're not even a jinyu grown yet. It would be a waste of your time.}}
:{{text|say|[[Ken-Ken]]|Ken-Ken thinks we split up. Follow the four winds.}}
:{{text|say|Kang Bramblestaff|That's a much better idea, Ken-Ken. I volunteer to travel south, into [[Krasarang Wilds|the jungle]].}}
:{{text|say|Clever Ashyo|I will follow the north wind.}}
:{{text|say|Ken-Ken|Ken-Ken go chase east wind. Shortest walk.}}
:{{text|say|Lin Tenderpaw|I... I suppose I'll go west, then.}}
:{{text|say|Xiao|Very well. As the oldest and fattest among us, I will wait here for each of you to return.}}
:{{text|say|Xiao|Good luck, friends. Once we can find the Hidden Master, we can continue our training.}}
