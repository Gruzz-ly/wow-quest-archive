==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Tina Mudclaw.jpg|Tina Mudclaw|She already HAS everything!}}
Obtain an Uncut Chrysoberyl.
*[[Uncut Chrysoberyl]]

==Description==
That [[Tina Mudclaw]] is in the [[Halfhill Market]] today, visiting [[Gina Mudclaw|her sister]]. She's really nice, but she's really hard to get gifts for!

There's a little jewel that can be found in the cliffs to the north. It's called a chrysoberyl, and it changes color when you hold it. I'll bet she doesn't have one of THOSE!

Look inside the virmen caves. I bet you'll find one really fast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+1400 [[reputation]] with [[Tina Mudclaw]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Hey there, <name>! Nice to see you again.

==Completion==
<Tina holds the gem in her hands, and watches it change from a pale blue to a bright red.>

A chrysoberyl? That's so sweet! Was this [[Andi]]'s idea?

Of course I already have several... but this one is beautiful, too. I'll add it to the collection.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

Fly up to the [[Springtail Crag]] north of [[Cattail Lake]] and kill a path to the back of one of the virmen dens. At the back of any one of the three dens is a Chrysoberyl Outcropping. Interact with it to loot the [[Uncut Chrysoberyl]].
