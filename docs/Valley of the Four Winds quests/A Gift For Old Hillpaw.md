==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Old Hillpaw.jpg|Old Hillpaw|That old guy sure likes chickens.}}
Find a Blue Freshwater Pearl.
*[[Blue Freshwater Pearl]]

==Description==
[[Old Hillpaw]] has about a million chickens on his farm... but that's not what he REALLY loves.

I saw. He collects [[Blue Feather|blue feathers]].

I don't realy know where to get a blue feather around here, but I do know where to find some blue pearls!

Check the oysters in [[Cattail Lake]] to the northwest. I'm sure a blue pearl will look nice with his feather collection!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+1400 [[reputation]] with [[Old Hillpaw]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
<Name>!  You startled me.

==Completion==
Well would you look at that!  I'll have to keep this somewhere that the chickens can't get to.

Did [[Andi]] tell you to get this for me?  Funny kid, that one.
