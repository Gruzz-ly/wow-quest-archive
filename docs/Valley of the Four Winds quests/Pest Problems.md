==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wika-Wika]], then stomp on 25 Black-Nose Marmots.
*[[Black-Nose Marmot]] stomped (25)

==Description==
One of my farmhands, Wika-Wika, has been tilling the soil in my westernmost field. I understand he's had some problems with pests.

He's got plenty of pesticide to spray the bugs that eat my crops, but I'm afraid he has no way to deal with the marmots.

Would you lend him a hand? With rampant hozen and virmen attacks, I can't afford to lose crops to simple pests.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+3300 [[reputation]] with [[Haohan Mudclaw]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
Well, good. That that's taken care of. Neatly done, <race>.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out. Fly northwest to the [[Heartland]], where at {{co|39.6|45.4|Valley of the Four Winds}} [[Wika-Wika]] can be found on a cart wielding a rifle. Speak with it:
:You here to stomp on the mook-mooks?
:{{gossip|Mook-mooks?}}
:{{text|say|Wika-Wika|Look! There's a mook-mook right there!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Click on marmots to stomp them!}}
:{{text|say|Wika-Wika|More mook-mooks! Look out!}}

Adventurers are buffed with a tracking buff that lasts three minutes. While the buff is active, marmots, visible only to the player on the quest, appear. Click on them to jump at them automatically, faster than run speed. After stomping on the first, insect swarms appear:
:{{text|say|Wika-Wika|Uh-oh, stingin' bugs! Don't let them get near you! They bite!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Avoid insect swarms!}}
:{{text|say|Wika-Wika|I'll get 'em with my pesticide!}}

The swarms interfere with the fast jumping used when clicking on marmots. Try to avoid them. Wika-Wika will taunt the bugs during the process:
*{{text|say|Wika-Wika|Get out of here, dookers!}}
*{{text|say|Wika-Wika|Yeah! Get sprayed!}}
*{{text|say|Wika-Wika|Stay back, you ookin' bugs!}}
*{{text|say|Wika-Wika|You gonna get a mouth full of pesticide!}}
*{{text|say|Wika-Wika|Take it all, stingy bugs!}}
*{{text|say|Wika-Wika|Stay away from my crops!}}

After stomping on the last marmot, the bugs and marmots all disappear:
:{{text|say|Wika-Wika|Looks like the mook-mooks went away. For now. You should go talk to boss Mudclaw.}}

Head back to the market.
