== Notes ==
Grainsorter Pei can be found at the north end of Halfhill tending the grain silo:
:The farmers from the nearby fields bring their wheat, and we mill and sort the grains here.

:Some of the grains will be made into food, some of it is traded, but most of it is sent to the [[Stormstout Brewery]] for... you guessed it... beer!
{{gossip|''Can you make anything of these clues?''}}
:{{text|say|Grainsorter Pei|Hmmm, I reckon I don't know, <race>.  All I can understand is the part about the valley - that's right here!  The Valley of the Four Winds!}}

Stonecarver Mac can be found near the top of Halfhill outside the [[Tillers]] headquarters:
:Hello there, traveler.  I'm hard at work making my next masterpiece!
{{gossip|''Where can I find the ancestors' stair?''}}
:{{text|say|Stonecarver Mac|Oh, I HAVE heard of the ancestors' stair.  That's what some folks call those mountains to the north.}}

Mama Min can be found on the northeast side of Halfhill inside a small house:
:I told my son, I told Dion, don't take the yaks to the field when it's raining. And what does he do? He takes out the yaks when it's raining.
:It is no surprise that we now have sick yaks!
:Ai-ya! How did I raise such a foolish son?
{{gossip|''Have you ever heard of a maiden laughing behind a fan?''}}
:{{text|say|Mama Min|The maiden, eh?  Hmm, I remember that's what my father used to call that river to the north.  Other than that, I wouldn't have the slightest clue.}}

Old Man Whitewhiskers can be found upstairs in the Tillers headquarters, immediately behind Stonecarver Mac:
* My memory isn't what it used to be.
* What day is it?
* Eh?  What did you say?
* Who are you again?
{{gossip|''Where can someone whisper secrets into the echoing dark?''}}
:{{text|say|Old Man Whitewhiskers|What echoes and what's dark?  It's simple!  A cave!}}
