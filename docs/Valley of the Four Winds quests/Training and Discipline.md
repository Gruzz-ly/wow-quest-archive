== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Loon Mai}} at [[Stoneplow]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

== Description ==
I told myself that, if I ever made it here to the {{NPC||Master Bruised Paw||Hidden Master}}, I would learn everything I could from him. This is my chance, <name>. I'm not going to let it slip away.

Still, I fear that Stoneplow needs us. I left early, before we were able to push the [[mantid]] scouts back. I'd feel better if you would check in with the Watch Commander for me.

Oh, and if you run into the others, maybe you should tell them where the Hidden Master is...

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
* 12900 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
I'm glad to hear that Lin is well.

Our defenses are holding, for now. The mantid continue to send their scouts over the wall, but they haven't gotten much farther than that.

== Notes ==
Back down the path to the south.

This completes the {{NPC||Lin Tenderpaw}} portion of [[The Search for the Hidden Master]]. If players have not completed all of the other portions (ending with [[The Golden Dream]], and [[Warn Stoneplow]]), Loon Mai will say:
:{{text|say|Watch Commander Loon Mai|You have been an asset to Stoneplow, <name>. We may call upon you again in the future. Until then, you should speak with our flight master. He will take you wherever you need to go... free of charge.}}
Feel free to take a flight elsewhere and finish whatever quests need to be done:
:{{Gossip|I need to meet up with Chen Stormstout.}}
::Ah yes, I've heard about him. He's visiting Mudmug's Place, right?

::I can take you when you're ready.

::{{Gossip|Let's go.}}
::{{Gossip|I've changed my mind.}}

:{{Gossip|I need to meet up with Ken-Ken, the hozen.}}
::Ken-Ken... I think I heard a rumor that he was staying in Zhu's Watch.

::Shall I take you there?

::{{Gossip|Let's go.}}
::{{Gossip|I've changed my mind.}}

:{{Gossip|I need to meet up with Kang Bramblestaff.}}
:That Bramblestaff boy is down in the wilds, fraternizing with those "night elves" at the place they call "the Incursion". He's looking for trouble, if you ask me.

:You want to join him?

::{{Gossip|Let's go.}}
::{{Gossip|I've changed my mind.}}
