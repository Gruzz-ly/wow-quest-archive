I, umm... well...

Oh, never mind.  It was a stupid idea.

It's just that, I was thinking that maybe we can stop the [[Kunzen]] [[hozen]] from attacking us without having to, you know... KILL anything.  I noticed a few ropes on the side of the mountain.  I think they're using them to climb down to our farms and...
