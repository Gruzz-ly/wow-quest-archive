==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Dark Soil]] underneath [[Farmer Yoon]]'s house, then give a gift to [[Gina Mudclaw]] at the [[Halfhill Market]].
*[[Marsh Lily (quest item)]] {{co|52.8|48.0|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
All right friend, all of that farming was just for practice!

Are you ready to try the real thing?

There's a lady by the name of Gina Mudclaw who runs the Halfhill Market, which is across the street to the south.

I heard she's looking to buy some vegetables. Since it's your first time meeting her, you shouldn't go empty-handed.

Why don't you look around the [[ranch]] and see if there are any items hiding around?

Might be that we'll find a good gift to take to our new neighbor!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|10}}
*64000 [[XP]]
*+999 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]
*+3000 reputation with [[Gina Mudclaw]]

==Progress==
Hey, haven't seen your face around here before! What's your name?

==Completion==
Oh my, a marsh lily!

How did you know that these are my favorite? I just might take a liking to you, stranger.

Thank you!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Oh hey <name>... Gina's a voting member of the Tillers, so... try and make a good impression, okay?}}
Head up the hill behind Yoon and under his house. Loot the quest version of the [[Marsh Lily (quest item)]] from the Dark Soil, then head back to the Halfhill Market and give it to Gina.

On complete:
;Pre-lvl 90
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Now that we're acquaintances, <name>, let me give you a tip. Folks 'round here can help spruce up your farm, but you gotta become friends.  Unfortunately, you're too green to help them out or give gifts yet, so get stronger first!}}

;Lvl 90
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|Now that we're acquaintances, <name>, let me give you a tip. Folks 'round here can help spruce up your farm, but you gotta become friends with them first. Make friends by helping them out with daily tasks, or by giving them gifts like the one you just gave me.}}

Completing this quest will unlock your first four patches of soil.  If you are level 90 at this point, you will also now be able to do the Tillers daily quests.
