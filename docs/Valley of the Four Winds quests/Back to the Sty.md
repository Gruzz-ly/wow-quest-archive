==Description==
I try to keep an eye on my stock, but every once in a while some of them sneak away. With all the confusion these [[virmen]] are causing, I may have let my guard down for a few moments, and some of my pigs escaped.

Care to look for them? I'd start by looking down the hill, to the west.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found them? There should be three missing, I think.

==Completion==
There they are! Back into the sty with you three, now!

<Liang looks up at you.>

Thank you, neighbor. I'm truly grateful for your assistance.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Meat They'll Eat]] before getting started. Head down to the southwest to the combined turtle-and-mushan area and get started. The pigs are also spread out in the area, but more-or-less fixed to one location. On the return to Thunderfoot Ranch, [[Chen Stormstout|Chen]] and [[Li Li]] are in attendance. Li Li is still rather annoyed at Chen's pace:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Here we are, FINALLY setting foot in our ancestral home, for the first time in our lives, and you want to stop and rest by a PIG FARM?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Be patient, Li Li. If we explore Pandaria too quickly, we will quickly run out of Pandaria to explore.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|That... barely even makes sense! You're just saying that because you're lazy and old!}}
