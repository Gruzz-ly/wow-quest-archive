==Objectives==
Taste the Aged Grain, Light Grain, Fresh Grain, and Malted Grain.
*[[Aged Grain]] {{co|51.2|60.8|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*[[Light Grain]] {{co|54.1|62.4|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*[[Malted Grain]] {{co|50.7|61.9|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*[[Fresh Grain]] {{co|53.3|64.6|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
As long as you're here, you might as well help me out. I'm feeling pretty darn unqualified for the task, seeing as I've never drank a drop of beer in my life.

You should try a little sample of each of their grains. Let's see if any of this stuff is sweet enough for [[Chen Stormstout|Uncle Chen]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
None of this seems to taste sweet enough! What's the deal?

==Completion==
Huh. I guess none of that grain is going to work. Uncle Chen is pretty picky.

Maybe the [[Grainlord Kai|Grainlord]] knows where we can find something more... special.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Li Li? Is that you? Hello? Anybody gonna pay attention to ol' Mudmug?}}
Pick up [[Out of Sprite]] and [[Wee Little Shenanigans]] before heading out.

Grain for Taste Test appears in big sacks on the ground. The regular sprites are on grain piles outside. The named is inside the building.
*Light Grain: {{text|emote|This grain tastes too light and bouncy.}}
**Light Headed: Feeling light as a feather. (Slow Fall)
*Aged Grain: {{text|emote|This grain tastes too old, bitter, and angry.}}
**Curmudgeon: Increase physical damage dealt by 2 while in Valley of the Four Winds.
*Malted Grain: {{text|emote|This grain has too much zing.}}
**Zippy: Your natural speed is increased while in the Valley of the Four Winds.
*Fresh Grain: {{text|emote|This grain tastes too earthy and natural.}}
**Refreshed: Increase nature resistance by 10% while in Valley of the Four Winds
On complete:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Why is all of your grain so bland?}}
:{{text|say|Grainlord Kai|The grain we gather needs to be in large quanities for the brewery. But I may know of a grain that would suit your needs.}}

==Trivia==
Li Li states here that she has never drank beer.  However, this has been retconned in ''[[Pearl of Pandaria]]'', where she not only drinks it, but proves to be experienced enough to brew it too.
