==Objectives==
[[File:Kunzen Soupmaster.jpg|thumb|[[Kunzen Soupmaster]].]]
Prepare 20 bowls of Mushan Tail Stew over the bonfire in the [[Kunzen Village]].
*[[Mushan Tail Stew]] x20 {{co|32.4|24.0|Valley of the Four Winds}}
*[[Master's Pot]] (provided)

==Description==
Have you ever tried Mushan Tail Stew? Chances are, if you have, that it was stringy and tasteless. You see, there's a trick to making the perfect Mushan Tail Stew: you need to cook it at high elevation.

I've already gathered the ingredients. Take this pot up to the Kunzen Village, up in the mountains to the west, and prepare the stew over their bonfire.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1|it=1}}, and one point of [[Cooking]] skill
* 236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I used to make daily trips into the mountains, just to practice making this stew.

I was younger, then.

==Completion==
This is fantastic! You are quite the aspiring cook, <race>.

==Notes==
Pick up the other daily quests before heading out.

Fly up to [[Kunzen Village]] on the [[Skyrange]] to the west of the [[Heartland]]. Look for the large Bonfire in a clearing toward the northwest side of the village. Watch out for pathing elites, run up close to the bonfire, then use the Master's Pot. It starts a channel, creating a [[Mushan Tail Stew]] every half-second. At 20, the [[Kunzen Soupmaster]] spawns from the hut just northwest of the bonfire:
*{{text|yell|Kunzen Soupmaster|Ookin' <race>!}}
*{{text|yell|Kunzen Soupmaster|You in hot water now!}}
*{{text|yell|Kunzen Soupmaster|Get lost, tik-nooker!}}
*{{text|yell|Kunzen Soupmaster|I kill you, dooker!}}
*{{text|yell|Kunzen Soupmaster|You tik-digglin' jook-manker!}}
*{{text|yell|Kunzen Soupmaster|You get away from fire!}}
*{{text|yell|Kunzen Soupmaster|I'll cook you into my soup, you dook-wikket!}}
*{{text|yell|Kunzen Soupmaster|...}}

He is a level 90 hozen with 787,000 health and will link any nearby hozen not already aggroed.

Wrap up the other daily quests before heading back.
