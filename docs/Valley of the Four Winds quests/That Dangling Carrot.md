Plant a [[Juicycrunch Carrot]] in [[Sunsong Ranch]]. You can purchase seeds from [[Merchant Greenfield]] in the [[Halfhill Market]].
*Plant [[Juicycrunch Carrot Seeds]]

==Description==
Grandpa always said, "Carrots ain't nothin but a welcomin' mat for [[virmen]]."  I don't think I ever saw him grow a single carrot.

For once, I disagree with Grandpa.  I like to live on the edge.  Plus, I like to eat carrots.

I like to eat carrots on the edge.

Could you get some seeds and grow one for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
I ain't afraid of no virmen.

==Completion==
I can't wait to get my paws on those carrots.  Thank you, <name>.  See you again tomorrow?

==Notes==
Merely planting the [[Juicycrunch Carrot Seeds]] is enough to complete the quest.
