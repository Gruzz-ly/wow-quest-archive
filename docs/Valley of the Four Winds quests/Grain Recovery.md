==Objectives==
Bring 8 Sacks of Grain to [[Grainlord Kai]].
*[[Sack of Grain (Valley of the Four Winds)]] (8)

==Description==
Since you are heading south, can you try to recover some of the grain that these thieves made off with?

We saw birds and sprites running off with entire bags of our best bulk stock into the fields east and south of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Between birds and sprites we are never going to meet our quota to the [[Stormstout Brewery]].

==Completion==
Why thank you very much, stranger. This has not been a good day, but you certainly have helped us make it better.

Please, take this, you've earned it.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Quest for Better Barley]] before heading out. To the southeast is the [[Plain of Thieves]]. Look for mobs actively carrying or guarding bags of grain. Attack them, loot the grain, then finish them off. After gathering the quota, cross the river to the south to reach the Cliffs of Despair. Look for some light grain and some rope, then click on the rope to rappel down. To the east is a mouth of a cave, the [[Dark Hollow]]. Enter and loot one of the [[Malted Cave Barley]] in the back to spawn a [[Cave Horror]]! Kill it, mindful of its combined stun/silence move, then exit and head back up.
