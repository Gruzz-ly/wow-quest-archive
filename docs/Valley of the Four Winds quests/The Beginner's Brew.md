== Description ==
Can you keep a secret, <name>?

I've been trying my hand at brewing. All I've got is this old handmade still, but it still works pretty good.

I've got an idea for a new brew, but I need some ingredients.

I'm awful shy around the townsfolk, but I've seen you making friends all around. 

Would you be willing to ask the farmers for some ingredients for me?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|19|84|50}}

== Progress ==
I don't know what it is. Maybe it's staring at that brewery day in and day out, but I just feel... like I want to brew the best beer in the Valley... no... all of Pandaria!

Oh, it's a silly dream, isn't it?

== Completion ==
You got them! This is wonderful, <name>!

I'll get started on the brew as soon as I can.

== Notes ==
This quest becomes available on reaching {{reputation|Friendly|Reputation#Individuals|Buddy}} status with [[Ella]].

On speaking to Gina Mudclaw:
:{{gossip|Could I have a Fuzzy Peach for Ella?}}
:{{text|say|Gina Mudclaw|I was going to charge you a pretty penny for that peach, but Ella is such a good customer at my market, this one's on the house. Just this once, ya hear!}}

On speaking to Haohan Mudclaw:
:{{gossip|Do you have a spare Sweet Lakemelon?}}
