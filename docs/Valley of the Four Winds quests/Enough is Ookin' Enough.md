Obtain 100 Virmen Teeth.
*[[Virmen Tooth]] (100)

==Description==
[[Virmen]], they bite too much.

They bite [[Mung-Mung]]'s carrot. They bite Mung-Mung's pumpkin. Mung-Mung try to shoo them away, and the dookers bite Mung-Mung's tail and foot.

Enough is ookin' enough.

You fight way better than Mung-Mung does. Bring back their bitey teeth. Then we see who does the biting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You bring back those teeth, and maybe Mung-Mung will have some hops for you.

==Completion==
So many teeth! Maybe Mung-Mung will glue them together make a tiny rake.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mung-Mung|You say you want hops? No problem. You kill virmen for me. Mung-Mung send some hops to Halfhill for you.}}
:{{text|say|Mudmug|Was that a hozen I heared? Are we in Halfhill yet?}}
Out and about for [[Hop Hunting]], head north to the Fruited Fields to find [[Gardener Fran]], then keep heading west along the path to find [[Den Mudclaw]] and [[Mung-Mung]]. Mung-Mung offers this quest. Pick up [[The Farmer's Daughter]] before heading out.

Just to the southwest is a mouth to a virmen warren. Kill virmen and head inside. Don't focus on getting 100 teeth before finding Mina Mudclaw, inside the warren on top of the gigantic carrot. There will be plenty to kill on the way back out and on the surface.
