==Objectives==
Slay 15 [[Ik'thik Warrior]]s or [[Ik'thik Infestor]]s.
*Ik'thik Infestor or Warrior slain (15)

==Description==
Without the wall to protect us, we barely stand a chance. If you hadn't gathered so many people to help us, we wouldn't have a prayer.

Check in with [[Guard Captain Oakenshield|Captain Oakenshield]] - he should be up near the break in the wall. Kill as many mantid as you can on the way there.

If we win, we win. If we lose, we go down fighting. For [[Pandaria]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Look at the SIZE of [[Mantid Colossus|that thing]]...

==Completion==
My wall... I spent my life atop that wall...

==Notes==
After completing all of all of the [[Valley of the Four Winds storyline]] and the [[Krasarang Wilds storyline]] up to this point ([[The Golden Dream]], [[Training and Discipline]], and [[Warn Stoneplow]]), a cutscene happens in [[Stoneplow]] and the phase advances. This quest is offered when the cutscene ends.

Pick up [[The Mantidote]] and [[It Does You No Good In The Keg]] before heading out.

Head out and start killing the non-elite mantid. Use Ken-Ken's Mask on the elites to summon Manifestation of Fear, a level 87 sha with 214,000 health. Kill them and the elite will fly off. Mei's quest will complete automatically after the fifth sha has been killed, so feel free to turn it in out in the field.

Due north are [[Warden of Zhu|Wardens of Zhu]], no longer despondent, led by [[Yi-Mo Longbrow]].

*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Notch your arrows, men...}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|We're firing another volley in 3... 2... 1...}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Ready... aim...}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Ready another round!}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Ready... aim...}}
*{{text|say|Yi-Mo Longbrow|Take aim!}}

:{{text|yell|Yi-Mo Longbrow|FIRE!!}}
Deliver the beer:
:{{Text|yell|Yi-Mo Longbrow|The beer's here! Drink up, boys!}}
Further up the path to the northeast is the Incursion forces, led by Lyalia.
:{{text|say|Lyalia/Sunwalker Dezco|Beer delivery, in the middle of a battlefield? Perhaps Pandaria will make a good home after all...}}
The Crane Wing Priests are due west in the middle of the Stoneplow Fields, led by Koro Mistalkwer:
:{{text|say|Koro Mistwalker|Ahh... beer. Just what my men needed. Thank you, <name>.}}
The Shado-Pan can be found on the southern side of the scar close to the wall.
:{{text|say|Fo Sho Knucklebumb|First we get into a fight, and then someone brings us beer! Can today get any better?}}
Once Mudmug has delivered all four:
:{{text|say|Mudmug|That's it for me! No more beer to deliver.}}
:{{Text|say|Mudmug|I reckon I'll head back to Stoneplow and rest my dang arms.}}
Mudmug's quest completes automatically, so feel free to turn in the instant it's done.

Finally, Oakenshield can be found near the end of the northern path around Stoneplow Fields, not far from the wall just north of the scarred earth. Turn in to him for The Swarm Begins.
