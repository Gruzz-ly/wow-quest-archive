==Objectives==
Kill the Great Cliff Hawk.
*[[Great Cliff Hawk]] slain

==Description==
During my routine patrol of the mountains this morning, I spotted a huge white bird diving down to the [[farm]]lands.

It lifted an entire [[yak]] in its talons and disappeared among the cliffs.

Today a yak, tomorrow a farmhand!

We must eliminate this bird before it chooses its next victim.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+3,750 [[reputation]] with Sho

==Progress==
This mission is of utmost importance.

==Completion==
You did it, <name>! I feel at ease knowing the Valley safer now, because of you.
