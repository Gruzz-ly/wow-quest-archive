==Objectives==
Slay 12 Mist Incarnations.
*[[Mist Incarnation]] slain (12)

==Description==
The mist in [[Paoquan Hollow|this forest]] is a constant nuisance - one which I'm glad to hand off to trainees like you. Strange creatures lurk in the mist between these trees, and they must constantly be pushed back.

Consider this part of your training.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Living outside of society has its advantages. I can focus all my energies on training, without being shacked to the societal conventions of modesty, politics, and basic personal hygiene. Here in the woods, I am free to be myself.

==Completion==
You follow directions well, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fog Wards]] and [[Tenderpaw By Name, Tender Paw By Reputation]] before heading out.

Mist horrors are all over the area. Try to kite them to any of the three wards and light the ward to nigh-instantly kill them. Leaves can be found on rocks near trees.
