== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Clever Ashyo||Ashyo}} at the [[Pools of Purity]] and observe his ritual.
*Ashyo's Vision {{co|59.3|27.6|Valley of the Four Winds}}

== Description ==
Have a look at that!

<Ashyo motions at the massive waterfall to the north.>

This must be the water supply for the whole valley!

Think about it, <name>: the pandaren use this water to grow vegetables the size of a house. Where could it come from? What is so special about it?

The elders among my people know a technique for speaking with the water and divining the future. Perhaps this same technique can provide insight into the water's source...

It's worth a shot at least!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
* 129000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
What is that jinyu up to over there?

== Completion ==
I can't believe he was able to see that with a stick... perhaps there is more to "crazy jinyu rituals" than we thought.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Clever Ashyo|Meet me up in the pools whenever you're ready!}}
:''Ashyo runs off to the northeast up the path.''
:{{text|say|Li Li|Neat! A jinyu!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|I'm glad to see that there's still some left, after what happened in the Jade Forest.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Say, you think they're related to murlocs?}}
Pick up [[Bottletoads]] and [[Watery Woes (quest)]] before heading out. Up toward the top is Zhang Yue, who offers [[Snap Judgment]].

Ashyo is a few yards away from Zhang, looking at a large stone monument in the water. Speak with him:
:This seems like a good spot to consult the water!
:{{gossip|Go ahead and speak with the water, Ashyo.}}
:{{text|say|Clever Ashyo|I've only done this once before... Hopefully this works.}}
:{{text|emote|Clever Ashyo plunges the bottom end of his staff into the pool before resting his head on the top.}}
:{{text|say|Lotus Farmer|Jinyu and their crazy rituals...}}
:{{text|say|Clever Ashyo|What... what is this place? It is beautiful... But... something is not right.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|What's happening?}}
:{{text|say|Zhang Yue|Could it be? Could the jinyu really tap into the water's power that easily?}}
:{{text|say|Zhang Yue|I know what your friend has seen, <name> - he will need to rest for now. Come speak with me.}}

Ashyo has optional gossip text:
:I can't even begin tpo describe it... you have to see this, <name>.

Zhang Yue also has a gossip text:
:I've never seen anyone get a vision from these waters so easily.

:Then again, I can't remember the last time a jinyu came to visit us and then stuck his face in the water...
