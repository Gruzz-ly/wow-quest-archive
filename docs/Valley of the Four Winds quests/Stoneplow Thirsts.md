==Objectives==
Deliver a cask of [["The Emperor"|The Emperor]] to {{NPC||Loon Mai}} at [[Stoneplow]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].
*[[Chen's Full Keg]] (provided)

==Description==
Excuse me... <name>? Did I hear your name correctly?

I've come from Stoneplow, in the west.  They sent me to pick up some emergency beer rations, but the [[Stormstout Brewery]] is all boarded up!

It looks like your [[Chen Stormstout|handsome friend]] there - no, not [[Mudmug]], the other one - has a few casks with him.  Could you spare a keg for a town in need?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Greetings, <class>.

==Completion==
Finally!  [[Emmi]]'s come through.

I hope all is well at the Stormstout Brewery.  My men don't do well without beer.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I have a rule: anybody who calls me handsome gets free beer.}}
:''Chen tosses [[Chen's Full Keg]] in the player's direction.''
Exit town to the west and follow the path to reach Stoneplow. Pick up the flight path fron [["Dragonwing" Dan]]! [[Lin Tenderpaw]] is here, all the way from [[Pang's Stead]] at the beginning of the storyline. Turn in [[Lin Tenderpaw (quest)]] and continue with her chain.
