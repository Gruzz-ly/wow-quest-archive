==Objectives==
Speak with [[Barnaby Fletcher]] to learn more about Portal Shards.

==Description==
Before we enter into a business relationship, I am required by the terms of my rehabilitation program to inform you that I am a recovering potion addict.

There, now that THAT's out of the way, let's talk portals!

You see, the big portals in the cities - the ones running all day and night - leak tons of magical energy.  It crystallizes around the edges and is generally regarded as trash.

But I noticed during my, uh... hiatus in [[Dalaran Sewers|the sewers]] of [[Dalaran]], that these shards still had power.

Interested?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|98|50}} and [[Unstable Portal Shard]]
*23600 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Completion==
I knew you would be!

Here's the catch - the shards, in their current state, are unstable.  But the soil in this valley is renowned for its magical properties!  I am sure if you were to "plant" the shard, a very interesting reaction would take place.

It could stabilize, leaving you with a functioning portal!  Or... it might tear open a magical rift that spits out transdimensional horrors!

My gut tells me it will be a little of both, but there's only one way to know for sure.

Here, take a sample!

==Notes==
The quest automatically completes, which is useful.  Barnaby Fletcher now will also sell an [[Unstable Portal Shard]] for {{cost|3}} each.
