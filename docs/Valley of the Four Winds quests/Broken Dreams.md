== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Chen Stormstout}} and listen to his story.
*Listen to Chen's story

== Description ==
Yes, I found the [[Stormstout Brewery]]... although I didn't exactly get the warm reception I expected.

<Chen pours himself a mug of ale.>

Do you want to hear the story?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
* 161000 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
...

== Completion ==
Maybe I wasn't meant to settle down anyhow.

== Notes ==
Speak with Chen:
:<Chen acknowledges you with a nod but looks uncharacteristically sullen.>
:{{gossip|What happened, Chen?}}

Players follow in the footsteps of Chen as he appears inside the brewery. He has 4.7 million health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Stormfout Fu|range=10|Perform a dazzling feat of martial arts on your target.|noets=Instant.|cd=1 sec}}
*{{abilities|Drink|Restores health over time. Must remain seated while drinking.|notes=Instant.}}
:{{text|bossemote|I found the brewery and made my way inside.}}
:{{text|bossemote|I decided to look around for someone else from the Stormstout family.}}

Run up the stairs to see Uncle Gao, who is not in a happy mood.
:{{text|say|Uncle Gao|Sorry, we aren't accepting visitors right now.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I am no visitor, I am Chen Storm-}}
:{{text|say|Uncle Gao|You should leave.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|But we are family. I am a Stormstout! From the Wandering Isle...}}
:{{text|say|Uncle Gao|Are you deaf? We aren't allowing anybody in the brewery right now.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|There is no need to speak to me that way.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Waaaait - what is going on behind you!?}}
:''An {{NPC||Unruly Alemental}} is quickly growing in size!''
:{{text|say|Uncle Gao|Huh?! That's... that's nothing! Now GO AWAY!}}
:{{text|bossemote|I had no choice but to defend myself.}}

Spam 1.
:{{text|bossemote|I was shaken, but I did not give up. I pursued the strange old brewer to ask some more questions.}}

Run to the back right to head outside. Uncle Gao is standing at the base of a ramp heading upstairs.
:{{text|say|Uncle Gao|What, were you sent to check up on me? Everything's fine! It's all under control!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Come, speak with me! Let's sit down and talk. Have a beer together...}}
:{{text|say|Uncle Gao|There will be no sitting. No talking. And none of your horrible beer!}}
:{{text|say|Uncle Gao|Hey, what's that behind you?!}}
:''{{nPC||Wuk-Wuk}}, an 86-elite hozen with 1.5M health jumps on the deck!''
:{{text|yell|Wuk-Wuk|*hic* Gimme more of that ook-dooglin' BEER! *hic*}}

Spam 1.
:{{text|bossemote|Beer elementals, and now a hozen attack? Something was very wrong.}}
:{{text|bossemote|I decided to give him one more chance. I wasn't about to give up on family.}}

Keep running up and back inside.
:{{text|say|Uncle Gao|How many times must I tell you... GO AWAY!}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I don't understand, old man. What have I done to upset you?}}
:{{text|say|Uncle Gao|It's not what you've done, it's who you are. You are not welcome here, "Chen Stormstout."}}
:{{text|bossemote|That was all I needed to hear. Shunned... by my own blood! I turned and left.}}
:''Gao walks off screen to the right as Chen jumps over the banister to the lower level and runs out of the brewery.''
