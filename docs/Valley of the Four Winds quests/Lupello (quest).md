==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lupello.jpg|Lupello|Leader of wolves, devourer of lambs.}}
Slay Lupello.
*[[Lupello]] slain {{co|82.3|39.3|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
I've been thinking... the wolves might stop attacking if we kill their pack leader.

We call him Lupello, and he patrols the opposite riverbank.

<Francis' concentration is broken by another attack.  Perhaps you should go deal with Lupello yourself.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What will Master Shang say when he finds out?

==Completion==
I know I should be the one fighting them off. Maybe I'm not cut out for shepherding after all.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Piercing Talons and Slavering Jaws]] before heading out. Head southeast and start killing. Lupello is on the other bank of the river just past the bridge. He is a wolf and counts as a kill for the slavering jaws quest as well. He does not have a tap, so as long as some damage is inflicted, kill credit will be granted.

Lupello's abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic melee|6200-7400 on cloth.}}
*{{abilities|Savage Bite|range=Melee|Inflicts 110% weapon damage.}}

On completion of both:
:{{text|say|Francis the Shepherd Boy|Uh-oh... here comes the master now...}}
:''Shang Thunderfoot walks up.''
:{{text|say|Shang Thunderfoot|Francis! We need to talk!}}
He offers the next quest.

==Progression==
{{Meeting Chen Stormstout}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
