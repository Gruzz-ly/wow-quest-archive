==Objectives==
Harvest 8 Ripe Mogu Pumpkin plants and provide 40 Mogu Pumpkins for the [[Klaxxi]].
*Harvest Ripe Mogu Pumpkin (8)
*[[Mogu Pumpkin]] (40)

==Description==
Once your Mogu Pumpkins are ready to be picked, you'll need only to package them for pick-up.

I wouldn't dilly-dally if I were you. The Klaxxi aren't known for their patience!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
The crate sits empty awaiting your crops.

==Completion==
Throw the Mogu Pumpkins into the crate! A Klaxxi representative will be along shortly for pick-up.

==Notes==
After planting the 8 [[Mogu Pumpkin Seeds]] the day before, harvest the ripe [[Mogu Pumpkin]]s and put them in the [[Empty Crate]] just to the southwest of the plots.

On complete:
