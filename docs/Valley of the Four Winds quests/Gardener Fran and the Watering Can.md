:{{text|say|Mudmug|Who's that guy? The guy you were talkin' to? Can someone tell me what's goin on?}}
Out and about for [[Hop Hunting]], head north to the [[Heartland]] to find Gardener Fran, who offers this quest. Speak to her again:
:Sure, you can ride on a mount while you water the plants. Why should I care?
:{{gossip|I'm ready to go!}}
Fran will boss-emote where she wants watering done:
:{{text|bossemote|First, go water my Bright Green Spinach!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Good enough! Now go water my Giant Carrots!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Keep going! Water my Cabbages!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Don't stop moving! Water those Sugar Beets!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Go water my Huge Melons, further down the path!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Keep it up! Now water my Red-Leaf Lettuce!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Looks like my Sugar Beets still need more water! Turn back!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Water my Elephant Garlic!}}

Don't be lazy and water the same spot, though:
:{{text|bossemote|You just watered that spot! Don't get lazy on me!}}
On complete:
:{{text|say|Gardener Fran|You said you needed hops? Very well. I'll send some to [[Halfhill]].}}
Den Mudclaw can be found a bit further to the west up the path, alongside Mung-Mung. They offer the next quests, [[Enough is Ookin' Enough]] and [[The Farmer's Daughter]].
