==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Jogu the Drunk.jpg|Jogu|His breath smells like my uncle.}}
Obtain 8 of [[Yoon's Apple]]s and 50 of [[Yoon's Craneberry|Yoon's Craneberries]], then bring them to [[Bobo Ironpaw]] to brew into Apple-Berry Hooch.
*[[Apple-Berry Hooch]]

==Description==
Sometimes I feel sad for [[Jogu the Drunk|Jogu]]. He's the only [[jinyu]] around, and I don't think he has any friends. Other than his smelly bottle, of course.

You know what? I've got an idea. Farmer Yoon has a basket of craneberries inside his house, and a few apples as well. I'm sure you could bring them to the stillmaster in the [[Halfhill Market]] and get him to brew something special for Jogu.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
* 236000 XP
* +1400 reputation with [[Jogu the Drunk]]
* +150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Hmm?

==Completion==
<Jogu takes a long swig from the hooch.>

That'sh it!  I've got a new favorite drink.  An' it'sh this one!

You know what, <name>?  You're alright.  I mean it, man!

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

Talking to [[Bobo Ironpaw]]:
:Brew here!

:{{gossip|''What ingredients do you need to make Apple-Berry hooch?''}}

:{{text|say|Bobo Ironpaw|We'll need at least 8 apples.  And a few handfuls of craneberries - 50 should do it.}}


:{{gossip|''I've got all this fruit here.  Could you brew up some hooch for me?''}}

:{{text|say|Bobo Ironpaw|Any time, neighbor.  Any time.}}

==Trivia==
The quest's NPC shot for Jogu uses his beta skin.  Not only is it a different color, but the eyes have blank irises.
