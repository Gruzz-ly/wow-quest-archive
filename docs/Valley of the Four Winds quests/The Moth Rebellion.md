==Objectives==
[[File:Mutated Silkmoth.jpg|thumb|[[Mutated Silkmoth]].]]
Kill 6 Mutated Silkmoths and 8 Tiny Mutated Silkmoths.
*[[Mutated Silkmoth]] slain (6)
*[[Tiny Mutated Silkmoth]] slain (8)

==Description==
Oh... oh good! A <class>! Could you help me?

I created a strain of vile monsters during my experiments to improve silk output.

The result was a full-scale moth rebellion. Can you use your <class>iness and destroy some of these mutants?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Master Goh keeps telling me I need to relax and that failure is part of learning. But this is a dangerous failure.

The kind that might get people killed.

==Completion==
It seems like there's not QUITE as many corrupted moths out there. At the very least, you've bought me some more time before I get in big, big trouble.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Did he say "horrible monster"?}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|See... THIS is the type of adventure I can get behind.}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Come on, let's go kill some of those little guys first.}}

Pick up [[Where Silk Comes From]] before heading out. Kill moths to quota.

On reaching quota:
:{{text|say|Li Li|Alright, done with the little guys! Let's move on to this "horrible silk monster"!}}
:{{text|say|Li Li|Hurry up, <name>!}}

Master Goh offers the next quest.
