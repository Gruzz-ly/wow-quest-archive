==Objectives==
Pick up Hillpaw's Chickens until you find his Prize-Winning Chicken.
*[[Old Hillpaw's Prize Chicken]]

==Description==
Say, you there! <Name>, was it? I've got a problem, and I need someone with better legs than mine to help me solve it.

My prize-winning chicken has flown the coop! Now she's out in the open, mingling with the other hens, wild birds, and... <gulp> ill-intentioned roosters.

My farm is west of here, south of the [[Skyrange]]. Could you find her, and bring her back to me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+3000 [[reputation]] with [[Old Hillpaw]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
I swear, she's never done this before.

==Completion==
You found her! You've got an eye for fowl, kid. I'll hold onto her for now. Don't worry, I'll make sure she's punished later.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out. Fly up to Hillpaw's ranch at {{co|31|53|Valley of the Four Winds}} immediately south of the [[Skyrange]]. Dismount, snag one of [[Hillpaw's Chicken]]s, then follow the prompts by using the Bonus Action Button that appears:
