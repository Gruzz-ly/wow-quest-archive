==Objectives==
Plant a [[Scallions|Scallion]] in [[Sunsong Ranch]]. You can purchase seeds from [[Merchant Greenfield]] in the [[Halfhill Market]].
*Plant [[Scallion Seeds]]

==Description==
I heard [[Haohan Mudclaw|Haohan]] mentioning that he was going to plant scallions today. I'm not sure if today's the best day for scallions, but I'd like to hope that he knows what he's doing. He is the head of the [[Tillers|Tillers' union]], after all.

Could you plant a scallion for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50|lcgf=1}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
What do you mean, I have dirt on my nose? What's that supposed to mean, <name>? Are you calling me a brown-noser?

Oh, I see. I DID have a little bit of dirt on my nose. Thank you for the helpful tip.

==Completion==
I can already smell those scallions from over here. Can't wait to pick 'em and sell 'em tomorrow. Thanks!

==Notes==
Merely planting the [[Scallion Seeds]] is enough to complete the quest.
