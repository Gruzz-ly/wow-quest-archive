==Description==
Trainee.

Several wards surround us, hidden in the woods near my home. They are quite effective at dispersing the mist, but they require constant upkeep.

You will find one to the north, one to the west, and one to the south. Find these wards and light them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 399 necklaces
|Necklace of Three Sins
|Jhuuroon's Collar
|Necklace of Relative Peace
|Amulet of the Singing Marshes
|Otouxian Amulet}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
See if you can light one of the wards while one of the mist incarnations is nearby.

==Completion==
You honor your people, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[They Will Be Mist]] and [[Tenderpaw By Name, Tender Paw By Reputation]] before heading out.

Mist horrors are all over the area. Try to kite them to any of the three wards and light the ward to nigh-instantly kill them. Leaves can be found on rocks near trees.
