==Description==
Would you like to be a Silkmaster for a day?

The first thing you'll need are fresh mulberry leaves. You can find them in our grove of mulberry bushes to the northwest.

Next you will need to feed them to a hungry silkworm in our feeding pit to the west.

And finally you should get some raw silk from our processing hut on the south side of our farm.

Have fun!

:{{text|say|Li Li|This is kind of cool. A day in the life of a... a silk-gathering guy.}}

Pick up [[The Moth Rebellion]] before heading out.

On the north end of town is the mulberry area. Interact with a bucket to pick up some leaves.

Then head south to the feeding pit. Click on five to feed them.

Finally, enter the building just to the south of the feeding pit and loot one of the barrels.
:{{text|say|Loommaster Jeng|When the silkworm makes its cocoon, we use this device to extract the silk.}}
