==Objectives==
Return 5 Escaped Shagskins to [[Farmer Fung]]'s yak pen at the very north end of the [[Verdant Belt]].
*[[Escaped Shagskin]] recovered (5)

==Description==
You want my vote for [[Farmer Yoon]]? Ha! You're joking, right?

Listen, I'm not going to vote for some citypaw with no lick a' knowledge about farming the earth.

It would be an embarrassment to farm alongside you or that Yoon shmuck.

Now let me deal with my own problems. Some devil let my prize yaks loose, and now they're running wild northwest of [[Halfhill]].

If I could just get my yaks back, then maybe I'd be able to sleep at night.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]
*+7000 reputation with [[Farmer Fung]]

==Progress==
What do you want?

==Completion==
<[[Farmer Fung]] stares at you with his jaw on the floor.>

I... I can't believe... YOU recovered all of my prized shagskins!

Do you... do you know what this means to me?

My family's only been good at two things - raising enormous vegetables and raising yaks.

The shagskins you see are the result of generations of work.

You have saved my family's legacy, <name>.

==Notes==
Head out to the [[Verdant Belt]] between the [[Heartland]] and [[Halfhill]], jump on an [[Escaped Shagskin]], ride it in to the paddock, and repeat.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|It was mighty kind of you to help me, <race>. I'm in your debt.}}
