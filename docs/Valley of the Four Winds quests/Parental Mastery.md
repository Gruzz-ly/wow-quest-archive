:{{text|yell|Hemet Nesingwary Jr.|Step two: say the words.  "Heed my call, waters of pain, and bring forth, Torjari's Bane!"}}

:{{text|yell|Hemet Nesingwary|Junior!  Nooooo!}}
:{{text|yell|Hemet Nesingwary|Come on!  We need to save my boy!}}

Dive in and swim down to the underwater cave.  Hemet is already there beside his son. The player gets The Beast is Near debuff, and junior has the Mind Control debuff.

:{{Text|say|Hemet Nesingwary|<Name> is coming. They can help us get you out of here.}}

Talk with Junior:
:The master comes.

:{{gossip|<Try shaking Hemet.>}}

:{{text|say|Hemet Nesingwary|<Name>, watch the corners. I hear something comin'.}}
:''[[Torjar's Bane]], an elite elemental, appears out from a corner.''
:{{text|say|Hemet Nesingwary|You chose the wrong hunter to hunt!  <Name>, kite that thing a little further away so I can get a better shot.}}

:{{text|say|Hemet Nesingwary Jr.|Oh... what... who?  How did I get here?}}
:{{text|say|Hemet Nesingwary|Junior!  You're okay!}}
:{{Text|say|Hemet Nesingwary Jr.|Sorry I made such a mess o' things.}}
:{{text|say|Hemet Nesingwary|No, you were right.  You did put "BIG" into "big game hunting".  You done me proud son!}}

:{{text|say|Hemet Nesingwary|I love ya too, son.  Now let's go get us a pint!}}

They will now respawn at camp, so turn in there.
