== Objectives ==
Plant 8 White Turnip Seeds on [[Sunsong Ranch]].
*Plant [[White Turnip Seeds]] x8

== Description ==
<Yoon kept this order request short.>

The [[Golden Lotus]] have requested a large number of [[White Turnip]]s.

Their request mentioned something about trouble-making [[sprite]]s wreaking havoc on [[Mistfall Village]]. Apparently the sprites don't like turnips!

== Completion ==
Well, that's all you can do today! Now to wait for the harvest.

Your crops need only to be tended and prepared for packing tomorrow.

== Notes ==
Plant 8 [[White Turnip Seeds]]. Consider using a [[Bag of White Turnip Seeds]] to plant 4 at a time!
