==Description==
I can sense your anxiety, but you are not ready yet. Your training must continue before you perform the final test. As for your task... I need you to fetch me some eggs.

Yes, eggs. The marshland atop the hills to the east is home to a number of birds, all of which are generally peaceful in nature. You should have no trouble gathering enough eggs to last me several weeks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How is your egg hunt going?

==Completion==
Now you know why I don't gather the eggs myself.

Shall we continue your training?

==Notes==
Cross the little pond to the southeast and head up the big hill to reach the [[Singing Marshes]] up on high. Whitefisher Crane Eggs are large, white eggs on the open ground, but looting eggs will aggro any of the nearby neutral cranes. Emperor Tern Eggs are small pink eggs nestled in groups of 3-4 next to big rocks guarded by a handful of terns. The Hornbill Strider Egg is inside the cave to the northeast. Kill the guarding strider, loot the egg, then head back to the master.

On complete, another training montage.
