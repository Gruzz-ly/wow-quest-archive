== Objectives ==
Plant 8 Green Cabbage Seeds on [[Sunsong Ranch]].
*Plant [[Green Cabbage Seeds]] x8

== Description ==
<Yoon's writing seems rushed. He must have been excited.>

The [[Shado-Pan]] want crops from you! What an honor indeed!

A request came in this morning for [[Green Cabbage]]s. Apparently, they make a rather tasty cabbage soup with them.

Only the finest will do for the Shado-Pan!

== Completion ==
Well, that's all you can do today! Now to wait for the harvest.

Your crops need only to be tended and prepared for packing tomorrow.

== Notes ==
Plant 8 [[Green Cabbage Seeds]]. Consider using a [[Bag of Green Cabbage Seeds]] to plant 4 at a time!
