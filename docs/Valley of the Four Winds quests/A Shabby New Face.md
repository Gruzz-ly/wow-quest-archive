==Objectives==
Speak with [[Barnaby Fletcher]] in [[Halfhill Market]].

==Description==
A strange fellow in a pointy hat showed up this morning trying to sell some kinda special seeds.  Claimed they were magic.

I welcome a little competition - business is business, after all - but this gentleman had a certain... shabby look to him.  Oh, and he stunk somethin' FIERCE.

Would you check up on him, just to make sure he's on the level?  He's over there by [[Jian Ironpaw]], making a meal out of the samples.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|98|50}}
*23600 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Completion==
AUGHM... nomf... -slurp- mmmf...

<Barnaby looks up from the table, revealing a tangled beard dotted with melon seeds.  Juices rush down his chin as he greets you.>

Mmf... -cough-  A customer!  Hello!  Name's Fletcher.  Barnaby Fletcher - nice to meet you!

<He wipes a hand on his robe before extending it, still visibly sticky and flecked with pulp.>

==Notes==
Once you reach {{rep|Revered}} with the [[Tillers]], [[Merchant Greenfield]] offers this one-off quest whenever [[Barnaby Fletcher]] is at the market.
