==Objectives==
Use [[Ken-Ken]]'s Mask on 5 Ik'thik Wing Commanders, then defeat the [[Manifestation of Fear (sha)|Manifestations of Fear]] that come out.
*Use Ken-Ken's Mask on [[Ik'thik Wing Commander]]s (5)
*[[Ken-Ken's Mask (The Mantidote)]] (provided)

==Description==
<[[Mei Barrelbottom|Mei]] motions towards the battlefield.>

You see those huge [[mantid]] commanders out there? They have an aura about them that reminds me of the sadness we saw at [[Zhu's Watch]].

Perhaps... they're under the influence of the [[sha]], too?

I kept Ken-Ken's mask - the one he used to remove the sha from [[Yi-Mo Longbrow|Yi-Mo]]. I believe that, if we use it on the mantid, we can convince them to turn back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*161000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It looks like the mantid are definitely under the sway of the [[sha]]... the [[Sha of Fear|sha of fear]].

Perhaps they're not attacking after all - perhaps they are running away from something. What could possibly be on the other side of that wall?

==Notes==
After completing all of all of the [[Valley of the Four Winds storyline]] and the [[Krasarang Wilds storyline]] up to this point ([[The Golden Dream]], [[Training and Discipline]], and [[Warn Stoneplow]]), a cutscene happens in [[Stoneplow]] and the phase advances. This quest is offered when the cutscene ends.

Pick up [[The Swarm Begins]] and [[It Does You No Good In The Keg]] before heading out.

Head out and start killing the non-elite mantid. Use Ken-Ken's Mask on the elites to summon [[Manifestation of Fear (sha)|Manifestation of Fear]], a sha. Kill them and the elite will fly off. Mei's quest will complete automatically after the fifth sha has been killed, so feel free to turn it in out in the field.
*{{text|say|Ik'thik Wing Commander|What is happening? Why do we swarm so soon?}}
*{{text|say|Ik'thik Wing Commander|This is wrong. It is not yet time to swarm.}}
*{{text|say|Ik'thik Wing Commander|The pandaren were prepared. This attack was folly.}}
*{{Text|say|Ik'thik Wing Commander|Why am I... here...?}}
*{{Text|say|Ik'thik Wing Commander|Where are we? We were... swarming?!}}
*{{Text|say|Ik'thik Wing Commander|No, no... this swarm is too early. I must speak with the Adjunct!}}

Finally, Oakenshield can be found near the end of the northern path around Stoneplow Fields, not far from the wall just north of the scarred earth. Turn in to him for The Swarm Begins.
