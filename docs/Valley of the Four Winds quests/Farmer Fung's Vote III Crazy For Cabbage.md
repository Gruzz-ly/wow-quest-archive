*Harvest Ripe Green Cabbages (3)
*[[Green Cabbage]] (15)

==Description==
<Farmer Fung is beaming with a radiant smile.>

Thanks to you, I got my precious yaks back! Unfortunately, I noticed that their time out in the wild left them rather gaunt.

They must be starving, but I don't feed my prize yaks just any regular old grass.

No sir, they eat only the leafiest green cabbages you can find here in the Valley.

My stores are a bit low. If you bring me some cabbages for my yaks, I will reward you handsomely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]
*+7000 reputation with [[Farmer Fung]]

==Progress==
I have pet nicknames for all of my yaks. There's Hairy, and [[Shaggy]], and Fluffy, and Woolly, and...

==Completion==
I was expecting cabbages, but not cabbages of this quality! Oh my!

A perfectly round head, large waxy leaves, a perfect gradient of emerald color...

<Farmer Fung takes a bite out of the cabbage.>

Mmm, and sweet, crisp flavor! These is a beautiful cabbage{{sic}}, <name>. My yaks will certainly be spoiled by this tasty treat.

==Notes==
[[File:Farmer Fung's Vote III - finale.jpg|thumb|Fung and Yoon]]
As before, plant some cabbage, do whatever it takes to get them growing, then come back tomorrow.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|These cabbages convinced me, <name>. Anyone who can grow produce like this belongs in the [[Tillers]]. I'm casting my vote for you and [[Farmer Yoon]]. See you back at [[Sunsong Ranch|your farm]] in a bit.}}

Back at the farm...
:{{text|say|Farmer Yoon|Hey, look, someone's coming up the road. Helloooo Farmer Fung! Nice to see you!}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|Well met, Farmer Yoon. I had to come by and see your farm for myself.}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|Not too shabby. Looks like you've got room for more fields there, too.}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|Here's a tip from one farmer to another. There are lots of upgrades to buy at [[Halfhill Market]]. [[Gina Mudclaw]] sells tools, and [[Merchant Greenfield]] sells seeds.}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|Anyway, I just came by to thank you for those cabbages. Couldn't have grown better myself!}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|In fact, anyone who can grow such a perfect vegetable needs to be a Tiller, which is why I'm voting you in.}}
:''Fung walks over to the offering bowl and plants his incense.''
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|Hey, looks like you've only got two more votes to go!}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|You'll have to prove yourself to [[Nana Mudclaw|Nana]] and [[Haohan Mudclaw]]. Those two Mudclaws will be tough to sway, but I think you can do it.}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Fung|See you around.}}
