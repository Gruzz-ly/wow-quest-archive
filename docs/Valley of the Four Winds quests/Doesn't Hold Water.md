==Objectives==
Speak with [[Mudmug]] at the [[Gilded Fan]] in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>! You here to help out? That's mighty swell of you.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hop Hunting]] and [[Li Li and the Grain]] before heading out. Head north out of Halfhill up the path to run across Mudmug. Turn in and pick up [[The Great Water Hunt]] from him.
