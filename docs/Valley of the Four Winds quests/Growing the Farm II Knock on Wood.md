Sure! I know just the wagon that you're talkin' about!

True to her word, she'll be at [[Sunsong Ranch]] first. Find her inside the old cart, banging away at it. She'll toss up a 15-minute tracking buff. Once it expires, that part of the land will clear and she will increase the amount of plots up to 12.
