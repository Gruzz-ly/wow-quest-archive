==Objectives==
Obtain 10 Meadow Marigolds and 40 Vials of Animal Blood.
*[[Meadow Marigold]] (10)
*[[Vial of Animal Blood]] (40)

==Description==
[[Chen Stormstout|Uncle Chen]] says we're going to help [[Mudmug|this guy]] out with his [[virmen]] problem. Fine by me! I LOVE messing with virmen.

Here's the plan: we're going to paint some turnips orange, and then we'll try to convince the virmen that they're carrots.

This can only end in comedy.

I'll gather turnips. You find something that we can use to make edible orange paint.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Turnip Paint "Gun"]] and {{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You have the stuff ready for the paint?  I went ahead and gathered some turnips.

==Completion==
Whoah, whoah, WHOAH!  You brought back BLOOD? I guess I should have looked around for a half second before I asked you to bring me something red.

Yeesh!

<nowiki> <Li Li turns back to the ingredients, spends a moment crushing the flower petals, and then mixes in some of the blood.> </nowiki>
