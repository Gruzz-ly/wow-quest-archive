==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Springtail]] vermin.
*Springtail vermin (12)

==Description==
I was sent to this valley to protect [[The Heartland]] from any potential threats.

I've identified a high priority target.  The Springtail vermin burrow into the mountain cliffs, high above the farmlands.

Left unchecked, their numbers will multiply, and they will make their way down to the fields below.

They must be eliminated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|94|50|}}
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+3,750 [[reputation]] with Sho

==Progress==
What do you have to report?

==Completion==
The targets are eliminated?  Well done, <class>.

==Notes==
Any of the [[Springtail Trapper]]s, [[Springtail Burrower]]s, or [[Springtail Littlewhisker]]s will do.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
