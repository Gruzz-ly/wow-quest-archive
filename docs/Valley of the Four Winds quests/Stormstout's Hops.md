==Objectives==
Return to [[Chen Stormstout]] in [[Halfhill]].

==Description==
All three farmers have delivered their hops to Halfhill. Perhaps you should check in with Chen to make sure that he received them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Look at all these hops! This is quality stuff, too.

We're making headway, <name>. Soon we'll have all the ingredients to finally start brewing.

==Notes==
After completing all of [[Hop Hunting]], [[Gardener Fran and the Watering Can]], [[Enough is Ookin' Enough]], and [[Weed War]], this quest automatically starts. If Li Li's quests have not been completed (starting with [[Li Li and the Grain]]), do those before heading back to Halfhill.
