Speak with {{NPC||Master Bruised Paw}}, then successfully strike the Stack of Bamboo Reeds 3 times.
*Strike the Stack of Bamboo Reeds × 3

== Description ==
We will start with a test: The Trial of Bamboo.

Your friend {{NPC||Lin Tenderpaw||Lin}} failed this test.

Follow me, and listen carefully to my instructions.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|10|20}}

== Progress ==
If you cannot pass this test, then there is probably no reason to continue our training.

== Completion ==
You show promise, <name>. We will continue.

It is now time for your first round of training.

== Gains ==
* 129000 XP

== Notes ==
Speak to him again:
:You wish to train? YOU!?
:{{gossip|I'm ready for the trial of bamboo.}}
:{{text|say|Master Bruised Paw|Ahhh... this test is simple. All you need to do is strike the bamboo, until it breaks.}}
:''Bruised Paw and the player walk over to the bamboo stand.''
:{{text|say|Master Bruised Paw|"But it's too thick around!", you might say.}}
:{{text|say|Master Bruised Paw|That is part of the test. Yes... to succeed, you must focus all your energy into one fist...}}
:{{text|say|Master Bruised Paw|..then, STRIKE!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Strike the [[Stack of Bamboo Reeds|stack of bamboo]] when the meter is full!}}
Players are using the vehicle UI and now have access to two abilities:
*{{abilities|Unyielding Fist}}
*{{Abilities|Stop Training}}
A circle is filling in the middle of the screen and will light up when it is above 90%. Strike then.

Successful strike:
*{{Text|say|Yes, just like that!}}
*{{Text|say|You learn quickly.}}
Bad timing:
:{{Text|say|Wait until the moment is right... THEN you strike!}}

On complete, a training montage showing the player and Bruised Paw training. It can be "reviewed" by talking to Bruised Paw again. He and Lin both offer quests.
