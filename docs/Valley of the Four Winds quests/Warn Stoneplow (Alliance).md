== Objectives ==
Travel to [[Stoneplow|Stoneplow Village]] in [[Valley of the Four Winds]].

== Description ==
{{NPC||Lorekeeper Vaeldrin||My father}} gave me his life. {{NPC||Tyrande Whisperwind||Tyrande}} gave me her trust. My [[sentinels]] gave me their allegiance.

It is time I repaid them all.

With {{NPC||Groundbreaker Brojai||Brojai}} dead we can mop up the remaining [[mogu]]. The next threat is the mantid.

Go north to Stoneplow and lend them your help. Tell them I will be bringing what sentinels I can muster to aid in the defense of their city against the mantid.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
* 12900 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
Mantid from the south? This is not a good day.

== Notes ==
Either take the flight path, or head west to reach [[Dustback Gorge]] then turn north to travel past [[Nesingwary's Safari]] and through the [[Stoneplow Fields]] to reach [[Stoneplow]]. Speak with {{NPC||Loon Mai}}, near the village's eastern end (in front of the [[Stone Mug Tavern]]) to turn in.

This completes the {{NPC||Kang Bramblestaff}} portion of [[The Search for the Hidden Master]]. If players have not completed all of the other portions (ending with [[The Golden Dream]], and [[Training and Discipline]]), Loon Mai will say:
:{{text|say|Watch Commander Loon Mai|You have been an asset to Stoneplow, <name>. We may call upon you again in the future. Until then, you should speak with our flight master. He will take you wherever you need to go... free of charge.}}
Feel free to take a flight elsewhere and finish whatever quests need to be done.
