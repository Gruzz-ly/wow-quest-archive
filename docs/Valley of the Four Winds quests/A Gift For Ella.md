==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ella (Valley of the Four Winds).jpg|Ella|I can hear her stomach growling from way over here!}}
Obtain Spicy Shrimp Dumplings.
*[[Spicy Shrimp Dumplings]]

==Description==
That poor [[Ella]]. She's so shy! I saw her standing in the [[Halfhill Market]], looking really hungry, but afraid to talk to any of the chefs.

We should bring her some food! And not any boring food - something special.

The Kunzen hozen make spicy shrimp dumplings from ingredients they've stolen from our farms. I don't like spicy food, but Ella might!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+1400 [[reputation]] with [[Ella]]
*+150 reputation with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
Oh, umm... hi.

==Completion==
You didn't have to do this! I didn't need any... any...

<Ella eyes the dumplings, and her mouth begins to water.>

Well, maybe I was a little hungry. Thanks, <name>. And give my thanks to [[Andi]] as well.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out. Fly up to the [[Skyrange]] and start killing hozen.
