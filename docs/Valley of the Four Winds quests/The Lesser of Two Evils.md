==Objectives==
[[File:Springtail Warren-Mother.jpg|thumb|[[Springtail Warren-Mother]].]]
Slay the Springtail Warren-Mother.
*[[Springtail Warren-Mother]] slain {{co|48.7|18.7|Valley of the Four Winds}}

==Description==
Like any farming community, we have the occasional [[virmen]] troubles.

The most powerful Springtail virmen live high up in the [[Springtail Crag|cliffs to the north]], and only come down when they run out of veggies to nibble on.

Frankly, I've dealt with virmen before. They're nothing but a pest that must be kept in check, and there's no better way to do that than by killing their warren-mother. Easy as that.

("Springtail Warren-Mother: Till and kill, neighbor. Till and kill.")

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+275 [[reputation]] with [[The Tillers]]

==Progress==
I've had plenty of experience with virmen in the past. Just show them you're stronger than they are, and they'll back off.

==Completion==
There, that's done with. Now we shift our focus back to farming, for a change.

==Notes==
Pick up the other dailies before heading out.

Fly up to the [[Springtail Crag]] and enter the westernmost virmen din. In the back of the den is the [[Springtail Warren-Mother]], pathing a circle in front of some stolen sugar beets, watermlons, and hot peppers.

The warren-mother, a level 90 virmen with 787,000 health, has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Tail Spring|range=Melee|Hits target enemy with his tail, inflicting Physical damage and knocking the target away.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~8300 Physical on cloth.}}
*{{abilities|Putting My Foot Down!|Stomp the ground, inflicting Physical damage and blinding enemies within 7 yards with a dust cloud.|notes=Instant. Hits for 14 Physical.}}
*{{abilities|Frenzied Hop|Madly hops up and down, dealing 11 Physical damage to all enemies within 7 yards every 0.50 sec for 5 sec.|notes=Channeled. Hits for 1882-1883 Physical on cloth.}}

Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Springtail Warren-Mother|This virmen land!}}

At some percentage of health lost, she will run to one of the stolen vegetable piles and munch on them, gaining an ability:
:{{text|say|Springtail Warren-Mother|Fighting make me... HUNGRY!}}
