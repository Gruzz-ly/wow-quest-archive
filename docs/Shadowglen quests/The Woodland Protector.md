==Objectives==
Seek out the [[dryad]] known as [[Tarindrella]] within the [[Shadowthread Cave]] at the northern end of [[Shadowglen]].

==Description==
I must ask something more dangerous of you. Strange news has traveled to me through the whisperings of the forest spirits. The mysterious woodland protector, [[Tarindrella]], has returned to Shadowglen again.

The dryad's presence has not been felt in the forests since before the [[Teldrassil#Stormrage|blessing of Teldrassil]]. Something is surely amiss if she has journeyed back to this land.

Seek out Tarindrella in the Shadowthread cave to the north. It is dangerous, but we will be prepared with this antidote just in case.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
I see you found me, young <race>.&nbsp; [[Dentaria Silverglade|Dentaria]] was wise to have sent you.

==Notes==
[[Tarindrella]] will appear as soon as you cross the threshold into [[Shadowthread Cave]]:
