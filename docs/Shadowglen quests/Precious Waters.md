== Objectives ==
Bring the filled crystal phial to [[Tenaron Stormgrip]] at the top of [[Aldrassil]] in [[Shadowglen]].
* [[Filled Crystal Phial]] (Provided)

== Description ==
Tenaron Stormgrip oversees all that happens in this glade. He presides at the top of Aldrassil.

If you look to your south, you will see the underside of the ramp that leads up to him. Ascend this ramp and complete your training.

It was wonderful to have met you, <name>. I swell with pride knowing that among young [[Night elf|night elves]], there are some so selfless and full of life as you are. You will do great things for our people. You will do great things for this world.

Until we meet again.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Woodland Shield
|Woodland Tunic
|Woodland Robes
|Woodland Chainmail
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

== Progress ==
The [[moonwell]]s hold the waters of the [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|Well of Eternity]], the ancient source of magic that has wrought so many horrors upon our world.

The [[druid]]s take advantage of its properties, the [[Sentinels]] revere the wells as shrines to [[Elune]], and now even the returning [[Highborne]] look to the wells longingly.

== Completion ==
So you have heard the first part of the aftermath of the [[Battle of Mount Hyjal]]. There is much more for you to learn and the task you have begun here will continue through the rest of your journey through [[Teldrassil]] and into [[Darnassus]].

== Notes ==
*This quest's description calls the player character a night elf regardless of their actual race. This is probably because it was originally a night elf-only quest.
*The progress and completion text are based on those of the removed quest [[Crown of the Earth]].
