==Objectives==
Collect 7 Moonpetal Lilies.
* [[Moonpetal Lily]] (7)

==Description==
Our friend [[Iverron]] has fallen to poison from the nearby [[Webwood Spider|webwood spiders]]. I can tend to him to keep his state from deteriorating, but I need someone to gather an ingredient to prepare him an antidote.

All around the ponds you should find Moonpetal Lilies. These flowers have great healing properties, and I can use them with the ingredients I already have to restore Iverron to better health.

Would you gather them for me? There should be many just in sight of here, near the water's edge.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Sedgeweed Britches
|Barkplate Vest}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Our dear friend is not doing well, even with my mending. Have you brought the supplies I require?

==Completion==
These will do perfectly. Thank you, <name>. Your swiftness is appreciated.

==Notes==
