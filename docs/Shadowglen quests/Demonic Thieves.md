==Objectives==
Recover Melithar's Stolen Bags near the [[grell]]kin to the west.
*[[Melithar's Stolen Bags]] (5)

==Description==
Vicious little grell! They've been stealing from our foodstores again.

If you wouldn't mind lending a hand, they are sure to have my stolen bags within their camps to the west. I would be glad to reward you if you can bring them back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*[[Melithar's Supply Bag]]

==Progress==
I don't have any spare supplies for my customers until my stolen goods are recovered. Have you had any luck?

==Completion==
[[Elune]] be praised! And you as well, young <class>.

There are many young night elves in need of these, but I'd be more than happy to give you one of the bags as a reward. I'm sure it will come in handy.

Safe travels to you.
