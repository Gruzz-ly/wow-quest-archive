==Objectives==
Kill 6 Young Nightsabers.
*[[Young Nightsaber]] slain (6)

==Description==
Greetings, <name>. I am Ilthalaine. My purpose in Shadowglen is to train young <class>s like you and to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained.

The spring rains were particularly heavy this year, causing some of the forest's beasts to flourish while others suffered. Unfortunately, the nightsaber numbers grew too large, and they will devastate the other populations if they are not culled.

Journey forth, young <class>, and thin saber populations so that nature's harmony will be preserved.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Glen Culler's Grips
|Archery Training Gloves
|Stemleaf Bracers}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
There is still work to be done, <name>. Return to me once you have thinned the nightsaber population.

==Completion==
You performed your duties well, <name>.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|say|Ilthalaine|I'm sorry, Huntress. None of our new <class>s are ready. They still have much to learn.}}
:{{text|say|[[Huntress Sandrya Moonfall]]|I fear time may not be on our side, Ilthalaine. The battle may carry to Teldrassil itself if we do not act soon.}}
:{{text|say|[[Dentaria Silverglade]]|We will leave you to your training, Ilthalaine. This is your area of expertise.}}
:{{text|say|Dentaria Silverglade|Study well, <name>. We may need you fighting by our side before the next moon fills.}}
