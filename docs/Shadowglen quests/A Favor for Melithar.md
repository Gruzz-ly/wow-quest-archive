'''A Favor for Melithar''' is an optional [[breadcrumb quest]] that appears if the player completes [[Fel Moss Corruption]] without picking up [[Demonic Thieves]]. It's likely meant to guide new players who may not realize that both Fel Moss Corruption and Demonic Thieves must be completed to move on.

== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Melithar Staghelm]] in [[Shadowglen]].

==Description==
You should speak with Melithar. I believe he had some troubles with the [[grell]] already.

I expect he can offer you a well needed place to store more of your goods should you aid him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Ilthalaine sent you? He was wise to do so. I am indeed in need of help.

==Progression==
{{:Night elf starting experience}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
