== Objectives ==
Bring the Partially Filled Vessel to [[Corithras Moonrage]] in [[Dolanaar]].
*[[Partially Filled Vessel]] (Provided)

== Description ==
While there is more I could speak to you of the [[moonwell]]s and of [[Teldrassil]], I must send you along. [[Corithras Moonrage]] will be expecting you. I have poured the phial of water you brought to me into this vessel to bring to him.

Seek out Corithras. You will find him at the moonwell in [[Dolanaar]]. Follow the road south from [[Aldrassil]] out of [[Shadowglen]], and continue to follow the cobblestones as the road turns west.

Mind you stay on the road though, <name>. There are dangerous beasts in the forests of late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

== Progress ==
Greetings, <class>. For what purpose do I owe the pleasure of our meeting?

== Completion ==
Ah, I see. You were sent by Tenaron. Well then, it would seem we have much to talk about, much to do.

Before we get to the task at hand, you should take in the lesson of this moonwell.

==Notes and trivia==
