==Description==
As part of a ritual to complete your training here in Shadowglen, you must learn about our recent history.

There is a task you must perform. Go to the moonwell to our northeast and retrieve a phial of its water. While there, you will witness a glimpse of our magics and learn of our past.

When you are done there, bring the water back to me, and I will direct you further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Our recent history is fraught with strife and violence. There is still much with which we must come to terms.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. You have one task left for you before you depart Shadowglen for the open wilds of [[Teldrassil]].
