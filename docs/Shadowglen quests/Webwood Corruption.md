== Objectives ==
Kill 12 Webwood Spiders.
*[[Webwood Spider]] slain (12)

== Description ==
I'd hoped to never return to [[Teldrassil]] for such grim business. I'd hoped that its corruption had been wiped away completely. Something foul lingers.

These spiders suffer much more deeply from the corruption than the other nearby wildlife. They are becoming a danger to your people and a danger to the forest. We must thin their numbers, but more importantly, we need to find the source of the corruption that plagues them.

I will come with you and aid you in this.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|{{nowrap|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:}}
|Thistlewood Maul
|Thistlewood Dagger
|Thistlewood Staff
|Thistlewood Blade
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
This is grim work. It pains me to have to inflict such violence on creature{{sic}} of the forest, corrupt or not.

== Completion ==
This corruption these spiders suffer from is not simply surface deep. It cannot be magic or subtle mal intent. It is bred into them.

It seems our next task is clear.

==Notes==
With each slain [[Webwood Spider]], Tarindrella may say one of the following:
*{{text|say|Tarindrella|Corruption this deep could not have come from outside.}}
*{{text|say|Tarindrella|His body screams for death, but his soul screams for mercy.}}
*{{text|say|Tarindrella|I weep at these atrocities we commit. It is almost unbearable.}}
*{{text|say|Tarindrella|It almost seems as if he was born with this corruption inside of him.}}
*{{text|say|Tarindrella|My dear friends... I'm so sorry...}}
*{{text|say|Tarindrella|The corruption goes much further than these spiders. I fear the true source is not within this cave.}}
*{{text|say|Tarindrella|The corruption is buried deep within him.}}
*{{text|say|Tarindrella|They are surely unredeemable, but it still hurts to see them die.}}
