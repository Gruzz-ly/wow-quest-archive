== Objectives ==
Kill Githyiss the Vile at the northen{{sic}} end of the [[Shadowthread Cave]].
*[[Githyiss the Vile]] slain

== Description ==
If [[Webwood Spider|these spiders]] are born with corruption in their veins, then their broodmother must be at the root of this evil.

Let us make our way to the far north end of the cave and seek out Githyiss the Vile. The answers we seek lie with her.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Draped Cloak
|Blackened Leather Belt
|Web Covered Mail Belt}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

== Progress ==
I adore these forests. I want to see the corruption purged from them completely. When next I return, I want to do so with a lighter heart.

== Completion ==
Githyiss and her brood were being corrupted by [[Gnarlpine Corruption Totem|this totem]]. This is a furbolg totem.

This is very troubling indeed. This means the [[Gnarlpine]] are still a danger to these forests. We let our guard down too soon.

==Notes==

:''Tarindrella approaches the nearby [[Gnarlpine Corruption Totem]].''
:{{text|say|Tarindrella|This totem has been corrupting the eggs! It seems a greater threat looms. The Gnarlpine remain tainted by something most foul.}}
