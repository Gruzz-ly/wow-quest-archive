*Pink Marmot delivered {{co|64.5|22.8|Bizmo's Brawlpub}}

==Description==
Now, I could tell you who Connelly is, but that would be too easy! To catch a spy you have to think like a spy.

You have to pass the test first!

The small things can say a lot about a person. It's all in the details.

I'm going to give you a drink to deliver. I will give you a small detail about something the recipient is wearing. From there it will be up to you.

Be careful who you pick to give drinks to. People here tend to get pretty hostile if you give them the wrong order!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Progress==
You learn to look at the details when you barkeep.

==Completion==
You have a keen eye, <class>. I think you are ready to meet Connelly.

==Notes==
Speak with her again:
:{{gossip|I'm ready for the first clue.}}
:{{text|say|Barkeep Townsley|They say the eyes are the window to the soul. If that's the case, I'm guessing this guest and their soul have something to hide.}}
Townsley hands over [[The Pink Marmot]] and several NPCs pop up gossip bubbles: {{NPC||Tasha Windpaw}}, a pandaren immediately to the south of Townsley at the bar, [[Keith "The Party" Westin]], a human to the north in a booth, and [[Twix Gearspark]], a gnome overlooking the ring from the northwest:
;[[Twix Gearspark]] {{co|49.6|34.8|Bizmo's Brawlpub}}
:Something about watching people fight to the death really warms my heart!
:{{gossip|Is this your drink order?}}
:{{text|say|Twix Gearspark|Look at me! Do you I look like I would order that?!}}
;[[Keith "The Party" Westin]] {{co|64.5|22.8|Bizmo's Brawlpub}}
:There is not nearly enough dancing in this club!
:{{gossip|Is this your drink order?}}
:{{text|say|Keith "The Party" Westin|It's about time! I'm parched over here!}}
;[[Tasha Windpaw]] {{co|67.4|59.7|Bizmo's Brawlpub}}
:Can't a girl just get a drink without being hassled?
:{{gossip|Is this your drink order?}}
:{{text|say|Tasha Windpaw|Why in the world would I order that?!}}

Keith is wearing sunglasses, so he is the correct target. Run back to Townsley and pick up [[The Rusty Dagger]]:
:{{gossip|Ok, hit me with another clue!}}
:{{text|say|Barkeep Townsley|This guest wears a memento of a love lost. I guess it's true what they say; every love story has its thorns, just like every night has its dawn.}}
:{{gossip|You didn't happen to order a Rusty Dagger did you?}}
*{{text|say|Tasha Windpaw|How dare you!}}
*{{text|say|Keith "The Party" Westin|Yuck! That looks disgusting!}}
*{{text|say|Twix Gearspark|It's about time you showed up with this!}}
Twix is wearing a rose in her hair, so choose her, then run back to the barkeep to pick up [[The Mogu Melon Twist]]:

:{{gossip|I got this! Give me the last clue.}}
:{{text|say|Barkeep Townsley|It's best not to get on the bad side of those that prepare your food. However, I'm not sure this patron has anything but a bad side...}}
:{{gossip|Does this drink belong to you?}}
*{{text|say|Twix Gearspark|Get that out of here before you spill it on me!}}
*{{text|say|Keith "The Party" Westin|You know the service down here just keeps getting worse and worse!}}
*{{text|say|Tasha Windpaw|Of course it's my drink! I invented this ya know!}}
Tasha is wearing a [[Chef's Hat]], so give her her drink, then turn back in to the barkeep.
