==Objectives==
[[File:Professor Kilt.jpg|thumb|[[Professor Kilt]].]]
Find [[Professor Kilt]] in the [[Boom Room]] in [[Bizmo's Brawlpub]].
*Professor Kilt located {{co|23.8|81.8|Bizmo's Brawlpub}}
*[[Bizmo's Boom Room Invitation]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright, I'll tell you how to find Connelly.

Agent Connelly is currently posing as the high roller, Professor Kilt. He spends most of his time in the Boom Room. Rumor has it he's after one of the fighters for some long forgotten betrayal.

Unfortunately, the lounge is by invitation only. Lucky for you I just happen to have an invitation.

Try not to look too obvious when you walk past the bouncers. If you get caught you didn't get this pass from me.

In fact you and I have never met!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 XP
* +400 reputation with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
So the [[SI: 7]] needs a reminder in what the word retirement means?

I suppose they wouldn't be comin' to me if the situation weren't dire.

I'll help, but I'll need a few days to gather some intel.

==Notes==
Ignore the gossip bubble for now - the entrance is at {{co|36|20|Bizmo's Brawlpub}} in the northwest corner of the Brawlpub, guarded by two [[Boom Room Bouncer]]s. Run up the second level to the southwest corner of the room to find [[Professor Kilt]] sitting at a table.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Professor Kilt|So ye want me to go join the Alliance front in this... [[Pandaria]]... eh?}}
:{{Text|say|Professor Kilt|Alright, I'll go.  But this is the last time I'm going to infiltrate the [[Horde]]!  And I mean it.}}
:{{text|say|Professor Kilt|I'm off to gather supplies and reconnect with old contacts.  If I need backup in Pandaria, I'll send for ya!}}
This completes the "The Man With a Thousand Faces" portion of [[Operation: Shieldwall Campaign]].

Additionally, Agent Connely sends a letter via the in-game mail system:
{{book|Back in the Service|content=Hello friend!

It's me, Connelly, the agent you sleuthed out in the [[Deeprun Tram]].  Per {{NPC||Varian Wrynn||the King's}} instructions, I've travelled to Pandaria and embedded myself with a group of [[Horde]] scouts.

This land ain't nothing like what I'd come to expect.

You've been here longer than me.  Word is you might've gone a little native.  Good!  I may have need of your skills soon.  I'll send for you at [[Lion's Landing]].
