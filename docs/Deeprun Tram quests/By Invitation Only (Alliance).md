'''By Invitation Only?''' starts the {{g|tww}} season of the [[Brawler's Guild]]. Begin by speaking with the [[Babbling Brawler]] outside [[Mythic Aspirations]] in central [[Dornogal]] to begin.

After accepting the quest, teleport to Stormwind, then enter the [[Deeprun Tram]] at {{co|66|34|Stormwind City}} in the [[Dwarven District]]. Find Pick Butterworth inside, between the two platforms.

==Objectives==
Talk to [[Pick Butterworth]] near [[Bizmo's Brawlpub]] in the [[Deeprun Tram]].

==Description==
Fancy yourself a Brawlpub contender do you, <class>? They don't let just anyone in there, you know. Certainly not without an invitation.

That said... just between you and me, if you know where to look and you've the means they say anyone can have their moment in the spotlight these days.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||86|50}}

==Completion==
Looking for a Brawler's Guild invitation are you?

Very hard to come by those, or expensive, or both!

But maybe we can work out a deal.

==Patch changes==
