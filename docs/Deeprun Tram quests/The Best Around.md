==Objectives==
Report to undercover agent [[Barkeep Townsley|Townsley]] in [[Bizmo's Brawlpub]] in the [[Stormwind]] side of [[Deeprun Tram]].
*Bizmo's Brawlpub Located {{co|52.0|45.6|Deeprun Tram}}
*Agent Townsley located {{co|69.9|47.1|Bizmo's Brawlpub}}

==Description==
We're going to need help if we hope to figure out [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]]'s plans for [[Pandaria]].

I have someone specific in mind, but he will not be easy to convince.

[[Agent Connelly]] considers himself retired, but one does not simply leave the [[SI: 7]]. We've had an undercover agent following his every move for months.

Currently, he is disguising himself as a high roller at Bizmo's Brawlpub. Something about settling an old debt.

Meet with our undercover agent in the Brawler's Guild.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Progress==
So you think you are going to talk Connelly out of retirement? Good luck!

==Completion==
Following Connelly has been interesting to say the least. The man is a master of disguise!

Talking him into joining you won't be the hard part, <class>. Figuring out which of these lively individuals is him will be next to impossible.

==Notes==
Taylor will offer this quest once at or above 950/6000 {{rep|Friendly}} with [[Operation: Shieldwall]].

On accept:
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Time is of the essence, <name>. [[Proveditor Grantley]] may be able to help you get back to [[Stormwind]]. Of course, everything has a price.}}

Said price is {{costitem|5|Domination Point Commission}} to purchase [[Portal Reagents: Stormwind]] from him.

You may of course also simply fly across the bay to [[Paw'don Village]].

Get close to Grantley:
:{{text|say|Proveditor Grantley|Hey <class>, you looking to go to Stormwind? Travel fast with one of my portals! If you ain't got the commissions, you'll have to get there on your own.}}
Buy one or not, but get to Stormwind's [[Dwarven District]] and enter the [[Deeprun Tram]]. On the near side of the two tram lines is a new red light over a path leading down. Run in. [[Barkeep Townsley]] is behind the bar. Speak with her.
:Can I get you something to drink?
:{{gossip|Are you the agent that is following Connelly?}}
:{{text|say|Barkeep Townsley|Shhhhh! You'll blow my cover!}}

You do NOT need to have been invited to the Brawler's Guild to do this quest.

==Progression==
