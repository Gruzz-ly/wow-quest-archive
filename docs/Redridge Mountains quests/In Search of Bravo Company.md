== Objectives ==
Search [[Alther's Mill]] for a member of the [[Bravo Company]].

== Description ==
If you and {{NPC||John J. Keeshan||Keeshan}} are going to defend [[Lakeshire]], we're going to need to find his old battalion. Last I heard all of 'em - Messner, Jorgensen, Krakauer and Danforth - were captured by [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]]. Now I don't know where they could possibly be or if they're even alive, but I'd be a damned fool if I didn't ask you to try and find 'em.

Search Alther's Mill, east of here, for any clues.

== Completion ==
Keeshan? You mean JOHNNY'S ALIVE? You bet your sweet behind I'll help, but first you gotta get me out of this damned cage.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Weapons of War]] before exiting the town hall. Outside, Oslow and Marris both offer quests: [[Surveying Equipment]] and [[Render's Army]].

Inside the lumber mill at Alther's Mill is Messner at {{co|47.5|41.9|Redridge Mountains}} in a cage.
