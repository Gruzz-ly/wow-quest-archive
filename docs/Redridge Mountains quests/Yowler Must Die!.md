== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Yowler.jpg|Yowler|Yowler, Son of Yowler}}
Kill Yowler and recover the Blackrock Invasion Plans.
*[[Yowler]] slain
*[[Blackrock Invasion Plans]]

== Description ==
<The gnomecorder hums.>

You need to find Yowler, <name>. He'll be located somewhere in the northern region of [[Redridge Canyons]]. Kill that mongrel and search his corpse for the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] invasion plans. Should you succeed, bring the plans to me over at the town hall in [[Lakeshire]].

Solomon, out.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Escalation Britches
|Mongrel Leggings
|Legguards of Invasion
|Mongrel Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||30|45}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Do you have the Blackrock invasion plans?

== Completion ==
<Magistrate Solomon takes the plans from you and begins reading.>

Shadowhide army!? Damn those orcs to hell! These invasion plans speak of a massive build up of orcish and gnoll forces in the east. Looks like {{NPC||Gath'Ilzogg}}, the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] general, is preparing to march his armies across Lakeshire and attack [[Stormwind]] directly!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Saving Foreman Oslow]] from the back of the cave. The Canyon Ettin can be used to kill Yowler, which is good. Yower is at {{co|26.8|22.1|Redridge Mountains}} in [[Yowler's Den]]. Kill him then head back to town.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Magistrate Solomon|We're finished! I might as well call for an evacuation now and clear out Lakeshire before the orcs march.}}
:{{text|say|Magistrate Solomon|And right when we finally finished building that damned bridge! What hope is there, <name>?}}
:''Colonel Troteman walks up to Solomon.''
:{{text|say|Colonel Troteman|There is hope, Solomon.}}
:{{text|say|Magistrate Solomon|What hope, colonel? What could possibly save us from the impending assault?}}
:{{text|say|Colonel Troteman|He served 248 consecutive tours of duty across the First, Second and Third Wars.}}
:{{text|say|Colonel Troteman|Captured five years ago by a battalion of filthy, pig sucking Blackrocks, five clicks out from the southern DMZ.}}
:{{text|say|Colonel Troteman|Tortured and kept alive as a urinal for young orc warriors. For FIVE YEARS.}}
:{{text|say|Colonel Troteman|JOHN J. KEESHAN.}}
:{{text|say|Magistrate Solomon|Keeshan's alive? I thought he died.}}
:{{text|say|Colonel Troteman|He's alive alright, and been living like an outcast in Lakeshire for the past five months. Or hadn't you noticed? Now enough chatter. We've got people to save!}}
