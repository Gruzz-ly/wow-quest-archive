== Objectives ==
Go to the [[Lakeshire]] Graveyard to tune the Gnomecorder.
*Test the Gnomecorder at the Lakeshire Graveyard {{co|32|39|Redridge Mountains}}

== Description ==
The gnomecorder looks to be in working order. I've got you all hooked up, now we just need to tune the gnomecorder for reception.

Head north out of Lakeshire and follow the road up to the graveyard. Once you reach the graveyard I'll attempt to transmit.

== Progress ==
What are you waiting around here for?

== Completion ==

<The gnomecorder crackles and pops.>

Can you hear me, <name>? Is this thing on? Ah, yes, I see you there now.

Let's get to work!

== Notes ==
While exiting Lakeshire to circle around to the north to the graveyard, stop by {{NPC||Marshal Marris}} overlooking the "rescue" operations just north of the bridge over [[Lake Everstill]]. He offers [[Like a Fart in the Wind]]. Pick it up on the way to the graveyard, which is a few hundred yards north of the bridge, just off the road to the west.

The Gnomecorder is effectively a two-way camera feed and object teleporter, as a vision of whoever is using it appears next to the quest display, along with a line or two of bonus text. Here, it's "Coming in loud and clear!" The bonus text varies for both offer and completion stages of quests. If present, it will be the last line of the section in both parentheses and quote marks.
