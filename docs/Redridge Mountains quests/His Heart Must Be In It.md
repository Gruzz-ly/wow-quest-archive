==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Colonel Troteman.jpg|Colonel Troteman|They shaved him... dry.}}
Recover Keeshan's Red Headband and Keeshan's Jade Amulet.
*[[Keeshan's Red Headband]]
*[[Keeshan's Jade Amulet]]

==Description==
<The gnomecorder clicks.>

His gear alone won't be enough, <name>. His heart must also be in this battle. To capture that, we need items of sentimental value. The [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] orcs of [[Render's Camp]], located in the north, hold two such items that belong to Keeshan.

Get up there and search their coffers for Keeshan's headband and a jade amulet left to him by his wife - who was brutally killed during a Blackrock orc invasion.

Bring them back to me should you succeed.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Vest of the Changing Heart|Troteman's Bracers|Hauberk of the Changing Heart}}

You will also receive:
*1,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Did you locate the headband and amulet?

==Completion==
I hope with these items and with his crew all rescued he'll have a change of heart. We can't do this without Keeshan.

==Notes==
To Render's Camp! Be sure to finish [[Breaking Out is Hard to Do]] and pick up [[Jorgensen (quest)]] before leaving the mill. Head north to the border with Burning Steppes and kill Utroka before heading to Render's Camp. Then, free [[Jorgensen]], pick up [[Krakauer]] and enter the cave, [[Render's Rock]], to find the coffer which is with [[Ritualist Tarak]] and [[Krakauer]], who can be found by taking a right at the first fork.
