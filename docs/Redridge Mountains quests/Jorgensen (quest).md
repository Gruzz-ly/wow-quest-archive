== Objectives ==
Retrieve Jorgensen's Cage Key.
*[[Jorgensen's Cage Key]]

== Description ==
I don't know where {{NPC||Krakauer}} or {{NPC||Danforth}} are, but {{NPC||Jorgensen}} was being held at [[Render's Camp]], northwest of here. I was in the same crap-filled cage with him before they relocated me to [[Alther's Mill]].

If we're gonna get him out we'll need the key. A stone cold witch known as {{NPC||Utroka the Keymistress}} holds on tight to that thing. We'll have to kill her if we're going to get Jorgensen's cage key. She's up north in the valley leading to the [[Burning Steppes]].

Let's go, kid.

== Progress ==
Messner! Damn, it's good to see a friendly face. Get me out of here!

== Completion ==
I know where they're holding Krakauer and Danforth. We gotta hurry. They were prepping those two for a sacrifice!

== Notes ==
To Render's Camp! Make sure to finish [[Weapons of War]] and pick up [[His Heart Must Be In It]] before leaving the mill. Don't take a left to enter the camp, but instead keep following the road north to the Burning Steppes. Utroka is a level 17 elite female orc warlock, with 1750 health and a felhunter minion on top of a hill at {{co|43.6|10.8|Redridge Mountains}} just south of the border. Kill her, then head southwest to the camp. Jorgensen is outside the cave, locked in a cage at {{co|33.5|11.9|Redridge Mountains}} alongside {{NPC||Ticky the Alchemist}}, a neutral [[goblin]].
