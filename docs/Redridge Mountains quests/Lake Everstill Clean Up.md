==Objectives==
Kill any 10 Murlocs in [[Lake Everstill]].
*Lake Everstill Murloc slain (10)

==Description==
Headed out to Lake Everstill? You'll be happy to know that we currently have a bounty on [[murloc]]s. Kill as many as you can and be rewarded! Any murloc will do. All you need to do is kill indiscriminately.

You'll find Lake Everstill directly east of Lakeshire. It's the lake. Has water in it... Any of this ring a bell?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shield of the Lesson
|Indiscriminate Wand
|Belt of Recurring Raids
|Bailiff's Gloves
|Chain of Recurring Raids
|Everstill Hewer
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Have you killed all the murlocs?

==Completion==
That ought to teach those murlocs a lesson. Hopefully the next time they decide to raid our town they'll think twice.

We both know that won't happen.

==Notes==
Pick up [[We Must Prepare!]] before heading out. Head east past the bridge. There's a murloc camp on the north shore of the lake and there are plenty of murlocs in the water.

==Progression==
{{Redridge Mountains storyline}}
