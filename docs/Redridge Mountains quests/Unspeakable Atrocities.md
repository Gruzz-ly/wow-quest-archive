== Objectives ==
Deliver Brubaker's Report to {{NPC||John J. Keeshan}} at [[Camp Everstill]] in [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]].
*[[Brubaker's Report]] (provided)

== Description ==
<You unfold the note and begin reading.>

Keeshan, if you're reading this note, I'm dead. Likely that my position was compromised.

[[Orc]]s are committing unspeakable atrocities against their prisoners. Yes, prisoners, Keeshan. They've got cages full of P.O.W's. If you're gonna blow up this valley, you'll need to free the prisoners first.

Tell my wife I love her and to take out the damned trash.

-Brubaker

PS - They've got [[black dragon]]s.

Take Brubaker's report back to Keeshan.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||10}}

== Progress ==
They got Brubaker?

== Completion ==
<Keeshan reads the report.>

DAMN IT! This just got complicated. We've got prisoners of war to rescue before we can blow up the valley.

Not to mention the orcs have black dragons on their side.

Are you ready, <name>?

== Notes ==
After picking up this quest, finish off [[Hunting the Hunters]] and [[Bravo Company Field Kit: Camouflage]] by heading west toward the Redridge Highway to start killing and collecting.
