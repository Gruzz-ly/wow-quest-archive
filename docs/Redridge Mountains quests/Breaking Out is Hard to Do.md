==Objectives==
Retrieve Messner's Cage Key.
*[[Messner's Cage Key]]

==Description==
The key to this cage is stored in a pouch over at the worg den, just north of our location. The problem is that the pouch is resting safely atop a tree stump amidst a sea of bloodthirsty man-killing worgs.

You've got one shot to get that key without waking up any of those sleeping worgs. Head to the worg den and find a way to the center. Tread carefully and watch out for the Blackrock worg captain. Get the key and return to me.

If you got a pet, I'd recommend telling it to stay back!

==Progress==
Did you get the cage key?

==Completion==
IT'S PAYBACK TIME!

==Notes==
Head north. The pit is full of [[elite]] [[Blackrock Battle Worg]]s and guarded by the elite [[Blackrock Worg Captain]]. If players attempt to enter the pit with their pet not staying put, the game displays a warning:
:{{text|bossemote|You should have your pet wait for you here. Beware the Blackrock Worg Captain!}}

Aggroing one worg will aggro nearly every worg in the pit, so be careful!

Exiting the worg pit:
:{{text|bossemote|Don't forget to command your pet to follow you!}}

Completing the quest breaks Messner out of the cage. He will follow players about as a guardian, with quotes!

* {{text|say|Danforth|You know, I've always wondered why they call themselves orcs.}}
:{{text|say|Danforth|It's an ugly word, you know?  It's a word I'd use to describe defecating.  For example:}}
:{{text|say|Danforth|After that [[Pilgrim's Bounty]] dinner, I took a huge smelly orc.}}
:''The collected company laughs.''
:{{text|say|Messner|I really missed you, Danforth.}}
