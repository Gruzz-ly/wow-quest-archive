== Objectives ==
Recover the Key of Ilgalar.
*[[Key of Ilgalar]]

== Description ==
We got lucky with some vital intelligence from locals of this valley. Those two behind us, the Ranthals, have informed me that the [[gnoll]]s in [[Galardell Valley]] are being controlled by a powerful magus in the tower of Ilgalar. The problem is that the tower is sealed by a magical force field.

The first thing we need to do is get the key that will get you insde. The gnoll general, Fangore, has your ticket inside. Kill {{NPC||General Fangore}} and get the key.

I'll be in touch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
I hear you loud and clear, <name>.

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Keeshan at Flamestar Point.jpg|John J. Keeshan|Fangore was a chump.}}
<Keeshan comes in over the Bravo Company field kit.>

Now the easy part is over, it's time for phase two.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Shadowhide Extinction]] before heading out. Follow the road north past the [[Tower of Ilgalar]]. As it curves to the west, turn north to find a small cave at {{co|67.6|28.7|Redridge Mountains}} where Fangore awaits.

==Progression==
