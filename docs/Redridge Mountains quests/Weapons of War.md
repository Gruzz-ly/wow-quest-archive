== Objectives ==
Recover Keeshan's Bow and Keeshan's Survival Knife.
*[[Keeshan's Bow (quest item)]]
*[[Keeshan's Survival Knife]]

== Description ==
What I'm about to ask of you isn't going to be easy to accomplish, <name>. {{NPC||John J. Keeshan||Keeshan}} left everything back there in that orc prison, and I'm not just talking about his soul or his will to live.

If we're going to get Johnny ready for war, we need to recover his prized possessions. The orcs now hold Keeshan's bow and his survival knife.

Head over to [[Alther's Mill]], east of here and look for two orc lieutenants, {{NPC||Murdunk}} and {{NPC||Homurk}}. They've got Keeshan's gear. Get it back.

I'll be in touch via gnomecorder.

== Progress ==
Did you terminate Murdunk and Homurk?

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Colonel Troteman.jpg|Colonel Troteman|You send that many, don't forget one thing. A good supply of body bags.}}
<The gnomecorder buzzes with energy.>

Come in, <name>. Do you copy? {{NPC||Colonel Troteman||Troteman}} here. Great job on getting Keeshan's weapons back! Now there's one final mission you have to run. Are you up to the challenge?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[In Search of Bravo Company]] before exiting the town hall. Outside, Oslow and Marris both offer quests: [[Surveying Equipment]] and [[Render's Army]].

Free Messner first. After saving him, head to the east of the mill proper at {{co|51.4|41.3|Redridge Mountains}} to find Murdunk and Homurk. Kill them both and loot their items.
