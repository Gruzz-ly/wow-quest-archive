== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Colonel Troteman}}.

== Description ==
They asked me to fight in those wars. I didn't ask them! I did what I had to do to win. So I ended up getting captured by those filthy, crap-swilling, maggot orcs and for five long years they use me as a toilet. Finally I break out and head back to my hometown and what do I get? People spitting on me, protesting me, calling me a baby orc killer and all kinds of vile crap!

No, I don't think I'll be helping you. You go back to Troteman and you tell him that this ain't my war.

== Completion ==
<Troteman sighs.>

I'm not giving up on him, <name>, and I'm not giving up on [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]]. We need to boost his spirits... Rouse the slumbering monster within him!
