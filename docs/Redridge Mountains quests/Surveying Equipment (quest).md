==Objectives==
Recover 5 Blackrock Spyglasses.
*[[Blackrock Spyglass]] x5

==Description==
Ah, my savior! I've heard that you're on a mission to save [[Lakeshire]]... and my bridge. Yep, worked too damned long on that thing to let it get destroyed by an army of marauding orc monsters!

Listen, if you're heading up north towards [[Render's Camp]], would you do me a solid and get me some spyglasses from the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] trackers up there? I could sure use 'em for my new surveying gear.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sandals of the Neverending Bridge|Lakeshire Gloves|Blackrock Shield|Lakeshire Handwraps}}

==Progress==
Did you recover the spyglasses?

==Completion==
Fantastic work, <name>! These will come in handy for our next project, the Lakeshire SUPER BRIDGE, meant to traverse the length of Lake Everstill. It should be done in 20 or so years. Give or take a decade or two.

==Notes==
After picking up [[Weapons of War]] and [[In Search of Bravo Company]], inside the town hall, pick both this and [[Render's Army]] up outside near the bridge.

Don't worry about picking up spyglasses until getting sent up toward Render's Camp in a few quests on the Bravo storyline.
