== Objectives ==
Use the {{NPC||Bravo Company Siege Tank}} to kill 200 Blackrock soldiers.
*Blackrock Invader slain (200)

== Description ==
[[File:Reinforcements in Shalewind.jpg|thumb|Air lift]]
I'm here to help you and Bravo Company end this mess.  You're to get in the Bravo Company siege tank and clear a path to [[Keeshan's Post]] on the other side of the valley, north of here.

This is a high alert situation soldier as the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]] are now aware of your location and sending a large force to meet you head on.  Terminate them all with extreme prejudice.

I'll see you on the other side.  May the Light have mercy on your soul.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Bravo Company Mantle|Bravo Company Monnions|Bravo Company Shoulderguards|Bravo Company Pauldrons}}
You will also receive: {{cost||35}}

== Progress ==
We're ready for the final assault.

== Completion ==
The only thing left to deal with now are the orcs holding out at [[Stonewatch Keep]].

== Notes ==
[[File:Blackrock zerg.jpg|thumb|250px|There should be no shortage of targets.]]

Hop in the steam tank. Most of the company is inside, but [[John J. Keeshan]] is on top holding [[Keeshan's Gun]]. The tank has 12,100 health and one ability:
*{{abilities|Ram|Rams any enemies in front of the siege engine within 13 yards, dealing 471 to 528 Damage and knocking them back.|notes=Instant}}
Head ''north'' through the valley past the [[Tower of Ilgalar]], north to [[Keeshan's Post]] at {{co|60.6|36.7|Redridge Mountains}} between [[Stonewatch]] and [[Alther's Mill]].

While in the steam tank, orcs will continuously spawn and aggro on Keeshan. However, Keeshan is a one-man killing machine, taking out anything that moves with epithets along the way:

*{{text|yell|John J. Keeshan|RUN TO YOUR DARK GODS, YOU FILTHY ANIMALS!}}
*{{text|yell|John J. Keeshan|AAAHHHH!}}
*{{text|yell|John J. Keeshan|AAHHHHHHHHH!!!!}}
*{{text|yell|John J. Keeshan|AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!}}

*{{text|yell|John J. Keeshan|BLOOD AND THUNDER, RIGHT!?}}
*{{text|yell|John J. Keeshan|I CAN'T FIND YOUR LEGS, JOEY! I CAN'T FIND YOUR DAMNED LEGS!}}

After killing 200 and getting safely to the post with Troteman, get out of the vehicle to stop the event.
