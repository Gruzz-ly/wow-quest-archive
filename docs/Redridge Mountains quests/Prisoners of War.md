==Objectives==
Free the Prisoners of War locked up in the prison in [[Render's Valley]].
*Prisoners of War Freed
*[[Bravo Company Field Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
The Bravo Company field kit is ready, <name>. I'm gonna equip you with it and you're gonna enter Render's Valley, southeast of here, and free our P.O.W.s. I'm sending [[Jorgensen]] with you to watch your back.

Now the prisoners are being held on the northeast side of the valley in a large cage, but the key to the cage is in a cave on the south side of the valley. You'll have to steal the key, create a distraction, and free the citizens.

Good luck, <name>! I'll be in touch through the field kit. 

==Progress==
<Name>?

==Completion==

<The radio on the Bravo Company field kit crackles.>

Looks like the P.O.W.s are free. Time to initiate Operation: End All.

Accepting the quest brings Jorgansen back as a guardian. Also, players now have the field kit with them. Toggle it to bring out its abilities and a quick explanation:
:{{text|bossemote|Bravo Company Field Kit ACTIVE. New abilities are now available on your action bar. Toggle Bravo Company Field Kit to DEACTIVATE.}}
#{{abilities|Camouflage|range=20|Covers the user in fox poop and leaves. Hides them from sight.|notes=Instant|cd=5 sec}}
#{{abilities|Distraction|range=30|Creates a distraction that any orc within 30 yards will investigate.|notes=Instant|cd=5 sec}}
#{{abilities|Chloroform|range=5|Knocks out a Blackrock orc. May only be used from behind the target.|notes=2 sec cast}}

Players are also buffed with "Bravo Company Field Kit: Toggle to deactivate", which they can right-click off if necessary.

Leaving camp headed toward the valley
:{{text|bossemote|Activate your Bravo Company Field Kit now.<br/>Stealth your party using Camouflage.}}
Closing in on Render's Valley:
:{{text|bossemote|We're nearing Render's Valley. These orcs are rough. Make sure you are camo'd!}}
The orcs are ''all'' elites, so fighting them is an ill-advised idea. However...
:{{text|bossemote|Create a distraction so that you and Jorgensen can slip by unnoticed.}}
Done properly, nothing untoward happens. However, Blackrock Guards can cast truesight, which sees through stealth, so be careful!
:{{text|bossemote|Blackrock Guard casts stealth detection. Keep your distance!}}
In the cave is a solitary guard.
:{{text|bossemote|Sometimes you just need to take out one target. Use chloroform while behind the enemy!}}
After looting the key, head northeast to the other end of the valley to find the Blackrock Holding Pens. Make a distraction to keep the orcs busy then free a pen.
:{{text|yell|Kidnapped Redridge Citizen|We're free! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!}}
The citizens should have enough time to get away if the span between distracting and freeing was short.

Jorgansen has some useful advice:
*{{text|say|Jorgensen|Make sure we always have camouflage up. The orcs in Render's Valley will kill us both if we're spotted.}}
*{{text|say|Jorgensen|While camouflaged, we are harder to detect when we are BEHIND creatures.}}
*{{text|say|Jorgensen|Sometimes a distraction can backfire and cause the orcs to become suspicious. In those instances the orcs will actively search for us. It's best to keep a good distance from any orc detecting stealth.}}
*{{text|say|Jorgensen|Once in a while we'll come up against a lone orc that stands between us and victory. Chloroform is often best used in those situations. Just remember to apply chloroform we have to be behind the enemy.}}
And some standard paladin bitching:
*{{text|say|Jorgensen|{{NPC||Messner}} kills bad guys so fast. I wish I could kill as fast as him. WHY can't I shoot [[fireball]]s? What does the [[Light|LIGHT]] have against fireballs?}}
*{{text|say|Jorgensen|My heals really don't have the 'OOMPH' that they used to, <name>.  You know what I'm saying?}}
*{{text|say|Jorgensen|One time, {{NPC||John J. Keeshan||Keeshan}} told me that he could take on five of me at once. Why am I so weak?}}
*{{text|say|Jorgensen|Being a paladin is rough.  The Light behaves so erratically.  Some days I wake up and it feels like all of my powers have been weakened.}}
*{{text|say|Jorgensen|I don't know, maybe the grass really is greener on the other side, you know? {{NPC||Krakauer}} and {{NPC||Danforth}} really kick butt as [[warrior]]s. Maybe I should drop this [[paladin]] thing and try out being a warrior.}}
