==Objectives==
Drink the Humanizing Potion, then question the [[Commoner|citizens]] of [[Redridge Mountains]].
* Drink the [[:Humanizing Potion]]
* [[Redridge Garrison Watchman|Guards]] questioned
* [[Darcy Parker]] questioned
* [[Innkeeper Brianna]] questioned
* [[Official-Looking Note|Search rooms for clues]]
* [[Humanizing Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
If [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] was headed in this direction, it would have been difficult for him to avoid the [[Three Corners]] watchpost. 

We could simply walk in there and demand information, but I have a feeling that they would not part with it willingly.

So we will take another approach.

I have procured this potion from our [[alchemist]]s. It will turn us into--ugh--[[human]]s for a while.

We can then question the guards. Perhaps someone saw something.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's find out everything we can.

==Completion==
So, [[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] was involved? [[SI:7]]... again.

Perhaps a coincidence, perhaps not. 

We have little to go off of. Let us assume Saurfang continued his path eastward, off of the main trails.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|Let's get to it.}}

Drink the [[Humanizing Potion]]. You turn into [[Sophia]] while Lyana becomes [[Marion Sutton]].
:{{Text|say|Marion Sutton|Hah! Look at you... how sickeningly sweet. It's perfect.}}

Approach the two guards of [[Three Corners]]'s entrance at {{Coords|14|63|Redridge Mountains}}.
:{{Text|say|Marion Sutton|Won't you please help us?}}
:{{Text|say|Marion Sutton|My poor sweet daughter lost her puppy!}}
:{{Text|say|Marion Sutton|It ran away last night. Did you see it?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Redridge Garrison Watchman]]|Last night? Don't much remember about last night, do we? Hah!}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|Come on! No need to tell 'em about that!}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|It's fine! Why, [[Mathias Shaw|Mr. Shaw]] himself paid us a visit! It's not every day the leader of [[SI:7]] gives you the night off.}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|Truth be told, it wasn't so much the night off as it was a full bottle of very fine rum... and a lack of orders that we shouldn't drink it all in one sitting.}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|Next thing you know, this one's so deep in his cups he can't hardly stand!}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|They don't need to hear any more about that...}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|Decides that he's gonna inform Miss [[Darcy Parker]] that he's gone and caught feelings for her.}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|My heart couldn't take it anymore! A man's got no defenses when he's doing in his bottles.}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|He takes one look at the franks and beans she's got boiling in the pot, and before you know it, his lunch makes a repeat appearance.}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|Had the poached fish and taters. Not a meal I'll soon forget.}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|Instead of the wooing of a lifetime, poor Darcy had to put a sick man to bed and scrub the floor.}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|Let me tell you, nobody knows how to tuck in a man the way she does.}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|Don't give up on her, now! You've got a big heart, and that counts for something.}}
:{{Text|say|Redridge Garrison Watchman|So to answer your question as quick as I can, I don't think we saw any [[dog]]s last night. Least not that I can recall.}}

Enter the [[Tower Watch]] and speak with [[Darcy Parker]]. Choose any option to complete the objective.

{{Dialogue|
Oh aren't you just the cutest? Look at those cheeks!

{{Gossip|The guard told me you took care of him last night, that was nice!}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Oh, yes, poor thing.

I couldn't make out a word of what he was saying on account of all the time slurring and stumbling he was doing. Something about beans?

I put him in bed over there at the [[Lakeshire Inn|inn]] in [[Lakeshire]].

Hope he's not feeling too horribly today.
}}
{{Gossip|What happened last night?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Oh, sweet thing, nothing to worry about. Were you scared?

One of the guards just had a little too much fun and he needed to lie down and take a nap.

I put him right to the bed in the inn, don't you worry.
}}
{{Gossip|Glory to the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]]!}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<Darcy gives Lyana a worrying glance.>

Good little girls don't say things like that, dear.

<Darcy turns to face Lyana.>

I'm sure it's just a phase.
}}}}

Leave the tower and go to [[Lakeshire Inn]] which is full of [[Guard Brant]], [[Guard Cosley]], [[Guard Farrow]], [[Guard Locke]], [[Guard Michaels]], and [[Guard Wilson]]. Before entering the village and the inn, don't forget to use the potion if your disguise is off. Talk to [[Innkeeper Brianna]]. Choose any option to complete the objective.

{{Dialogue|
Hello, little one, please get out of the way. We're kind of busy here.

{{Gossip|Are any guards staying at this inn?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Yes, actually, quite a few. Head upstairs if you want to see for yourself.

Sorry, but I need to get back to the other customers.
}}
{{Gossip|Isn't that a bit rude?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
You little brat! Hasn't your mother taught you better than to question adults?
}}
{{Gossip|We want a room, please.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Sorry, they're all taken up by local guards right now.

Not sure where they got the gold, they filled up the rooms last night, even the [[Watch Captain Parker|captain]] was here.

At least one of them left me a mess to clean up in the morning, too.
}}}}

Go upstairs and investigate [[Official-Looking Note]]. Upon completion of the quest, Lyana turns into her undead form.
