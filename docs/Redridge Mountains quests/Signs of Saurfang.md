==Objectives==
Follow the trail of [[Varok Saurfang]] in [[Redridge]].
* Area investigated
* [[Ripped Webbing|Ripped webbing]] found
* [[Dead Tarantula Broodling|Dead tarantula]] inspected
* [[Spider Ichor (object)|Ichor]] inspected
* [[Injured Bristlequeen]] slain

==Description==
With the guards drunk at their posts, and others out of position, Saurfang would have had little trouble passing [[Three Corners]] undetected.

The path splits just south of town. The back roads of Redridge are poorly patrolled, and are infested with [[gnoll]]s and [[spider]]s. In other words, perfect for an [[orc]] trying not to be noticed.

His most likely path is [[Lakeridge Highway]]. We should continue our investigation there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well? What are you waiting for?

==Completion==
Well, that was invigorating. 

Based on the size of that spider and how injured it was, I'd venture a guess that we are on the right track.

And I think I know where to head next.

==Notes==
Go to [[Lakeridge Highway]] at {{Coords|23|66|Redridge Mountains}}.
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|These back roads would make an ideal route for someone trying to avoid attention. Let's look around.}}

Investigate some [[Ripped Webbing]] at {{Coords|26|65|Redridge Mountains}}.
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|Ripped webbing. Someone definitely passed through here--and it wasn't a gnoll.}}

Inspect some [[Dead Tarantula Broodling]] at {{Coords|28|66|Redridge Mountains}}.
{{Dialogue|
<This tarantula has seen better days.

It appears to have been punched to death.>

;Lyana
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|They're dead. Based on the print pattern, I'd say it was only a minor scuffle.}}

Investigate the [[Spider Ichor (object)|Ichor]].
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|That's a lot of ichor. More than I'd expect from one of these young tarantulas.}}
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|Which means that our quarry must also have encountered...}}

[[Injured Bristlequeen]] appears. Kill it.
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|...their mother.}}
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|Such a shame. I quite like spiders.}}
