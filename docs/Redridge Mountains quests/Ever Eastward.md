==Objectives==
Find [[Dark Ranger Lyana]] at [[Redridge Pass]] in [[Redridge Mountains]].

==Description==
All signs point to our quarry heading farther east. 

To what end, I am not sure. But I have my suspicions.

I am going to scout the area from the air. Let's meet up at Redridge Pass.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is one of the few pathways through the Redridge Mountains. If [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] came this direction, it was through this pass.
