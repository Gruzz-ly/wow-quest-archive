==Objectives==
Kill Grand Magus Doane.
*[[Grand Magus Doane]] confronted
*[[Key of Ilgalar]] (provided)

==Description==
<The Bravo Company field kit vibrates.>

Good work, kid. I've got some vital intel for you. The [[mage|magus]] in the [[Tower of Ilgalar|tower]] is a [[human]] named Doane. Damned traitor is working for the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]]. I want him dead.

Use the key of Ilgalar and get inside that tower. Work you way to the top and show Doane what Bravo Company does with traitors.

Rendezvous back at [[Shalewind Canyon]] when the deed is done.

Keeshan, over and out.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Treacherous Treads
|Shalewind Belt
|Treacherous Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I hear you loud and clear, <name>.

==Completion==
He teleported away? Mentioned [[Darkblaze]]? What the hell is going on here.

Looks like it's time to strap in and finish this nonsense.

==Notes==
Head back south to the Tower of Ilgalar, killing gnolls all the way. Unlock the door, then kill a path up to the top. Grand Magus Donae appears to be a level 20 human mage with nearly 2000 health. However, during the fight, he summons in a level 20 abomination and teleports out before players can finish him off. Head back down the tower and kill a path back to the valley if 20 gnolls haven't been killed yet.
