*Keeshan's Riverboat Ride Complete
*Speak with John J. Keeshan at Camp Everstill in Redridge.

== Description ==
Those [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] orcs are gonna need an army to handle the Bravo Company and you, <name>. When you're ready to go, meet us at the dock facing [[Lake Everstill]] and we'll set off on my riverboat for Camp Everstill on the other side of the lake.

See you there, <name>.

== Completion ==
It's orc killin' time.

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest advances the phase as the members of Bravo Company all disappear. Head out to the river boat and hop on.
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Take us out, Messner.}}
:{{text|say|Messner|You got it, Johnny!}}
:''Messner lights up some kind of fire attack and uses the reaction from it to propel the boat across the lake. On reaching the other side...''
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|We're here, everybody out!}}
:''The company disappears.''

Walk up the hill and pick up the flight path, then close in on the group to listen to the script.  Keeshan is kneeling over a set of tactical maps set on the ground.
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Danforth, report.}}
:{{text|say|Danforth|The Blackrock orcs blew up the bridge leading to Stonewatch Keep. Frontal assault is out of the question.}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Krakauer?}}
:{{text|say|Krakauer|Two ways to get behind enemy lines, Johnny. Three if you count bein' dead.}}
:{{text|say|Krakauer|North through [[Alther's Mill]], but we'd have to cut through an army of bloodthirsty [[worg]]s or south through [[Render's Valley]].}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Jorgensen, what do you have on Render's Valley?}}
:{{text|say|Jorgensen|Blackrocks all over the damned place, Johnny. One main tower at the choke and two smaller huts. It's a death trap.}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Death trap, eh? Messner, I got a plan. Gonna need some [[seaforium]].}}
:{{text|say|Messner|Seaforium? Where the hell am I gonna get seaforium from, Johnny?}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Not my problem, Messner. Make it happen.}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|<Name>, get your crap ready. I'm sending you out in the field.}}
