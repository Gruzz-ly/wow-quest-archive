==Objectives==
Kill Ritualist Tarak.
*[[Ritualist Tarak]] slain

==Description==
[[Krakauer]] is up on the chopping block as we speak! The orcs brought in a [[Gurubashi tribe|Gurubashi]] witch doctor to perform a dark ritual on him. We need to kill that [[troll]] to free Krakauer!

Let's go! He's just inside the cave here. Hang a right at the first fork.

==Progress==
<Krakauer groans>.

==Completion==
Wha... Where am I? What happened? [[Messner]]? [[Jorgensen]]?

OH MY GOSH! We have to get to [[Danforth]]! It might already be too late!

==Notes==
As Jorgensen says, enter the cave, Render's Rock, and take the first right. Tarak and Krakauer are at the end of the cave, and the Blackrock Coffer is just in front of them.

Krakauer, once freed, has some quotes too:
