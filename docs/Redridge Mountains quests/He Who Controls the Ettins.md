== Objectives ==
Kill Ardo Dirtpaw.
*[[Ardo Dirtpaw]] slain

== Description ==
You've stumbled upon a [[gnoll]] document. The gnoll that wrote this propaganda is semi-literate:

BROTHERS OF {{NPC||Yowler||YOWLER}}, HEAR DIRTPAW! DIRTPAW GIVEN ORB FROM [[orc|ORCS]]! DIRTPAW CONTROL [[ettin|ETTIN]] THINGS! DIRTPAW CRUSH [[human|HUMIES]]! COME GET DIRTPAW PAW-O-GRAPH IN [[Rethban Caverns|RETHBAN CAVE]]. CAVE IS WEST, HIDDEN IN [[Redridge Canyons|CANYON]]!

<There's a paw print as the signature.>

<There also appears to be a bite taken out of the scroll.>

You should probably investigate.

== Progress ==
<The orb emanates powerful magic>

== Completion ==
<The orb hisses as you touch it.>

== Notes ==
While killing gnolls for [[Canyon Romp]] and [[Like a Fart in the Wind]], the Dirt-Stained Scroll stands a chance of dropping. The followup to Canyon Romp, [[They've Wised Up...]] also directs players to Rethban, so accept and keep moving that way. The entrance to the caverns is north of the westernmost camp of the canyons at {{co|20.1|31.8|Redridge Mountains}} north of Lakeshire. Head to the northwest corner of the cave, kill Ardo and interact with the [[Ettin Control Orb]].
