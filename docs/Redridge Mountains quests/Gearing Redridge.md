==Pre-requisites==
*Must be a [[Blacksmithing|Blacksmith]] with at least 60 skill.

==Objectives==
[[Tormus Deepforge]] wants you to bring 4 [[Runed Copper Belt]]s and 4 [[Heavy Copper Maul]]s to [[Verner Osgood]] in [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]].

*[[Runed Copper Belt]] (4)
*[[Heavy Copper Maul]] (4)

==Description==
We [[Dwarf|dwarves]] aren't the only ones fighting. Our [[human]] allies have their hands full too!

Redridge is under periodic attack from [[Blackrock clan|blackrock]] [[orc]]s, and their supply of equipment is always low. If you were to help them out, I'm sure their resident [[Smith|blacksmith]], Verner Osgood, would teach you a trick or two.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Plans: Ironforge Breastplate
}}

You will also receive:
*120 - 1,150 XP
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I hope you're here with good news from [[Ironforge]]. Because I'm at my wit's end!

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. This will help me out tremendously. With the [[Blackrock Clan|Blackrock orcs]] attacking from [[Stonewatch Keep]] and the Redridge gnolls lurking in the foothills to the north, I'm always fixing armor and making new weapons for our troops.

The supplies you brought will give me a moment's peace. I will have enough time to teach you something...

==Notes==
*Though the quest can be picked up with only 60 skill, if you plan to craft the items yourself then you'll need 65 skill to learn the plans for [[Heavy Copper Maul]] and 70 skill for [[Runed Copper Belt]].
*In total, crafting four belts and four mauls requires 88x [[Copper Bar]], 8x [[Weak Flux]], and 8x [[Light Leather]].
