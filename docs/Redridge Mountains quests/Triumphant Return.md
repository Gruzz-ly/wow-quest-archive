== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Magistrate Solomon}} at [[Lakeshire]] in [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]].

== Description ==
Return to Lakeshire and let Solomon know that the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] invasion has been stopped. Make sure he understands the cost at which our freedom came - that we lost five of our finest heroes to save Redridge and ultimately, [[Stormwind]].

You are the last surviving member of Bravo Company, <name>. It is up to you to keep its legacy alive.

Dismissed.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Keeshan's Dagger|Keeshan's Bow|Bravo Company Signet}}
You will also receive: [[Keeshan's Bandana]]

== Completion ==
They will never be forgotten, <name>. What you and the rest of Bravo Company sacrificed in order to save Redridge will be a tale told for ages to come.

While I can in no way make up for the loss of your friends, I feel that you must be rewarded for such a heroic deed. These are Keeshan's possessions - the only things we found when we dredged the lake for his body. Troteman has informed me that Keeshan would have wanted you to take something as the lone surviving member of Bravo Company. Remember them, <name>!

== Notes ==
While on this quest, there are no orcs at [[Alther's Mill]], so take this opportunity to run safely back to Lakeshire, and in the town hall, the annoyed citizens are gone.

This concludes the Redridge storyline. Next up is Duskwood in [[Hero's Call: Duskwood!]] (which is available at level 19).
