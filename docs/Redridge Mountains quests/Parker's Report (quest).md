== Objectives ==
Deliver Parker's Report to {{NPC||Magistrate Solomon}} at [[Lakeshire]] in [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]].
*[[Parker's Report]] (provided)

== Description ==
<{{NPC||Watch Captain Parker}} hands you a report.>

Here it is, <name>. Take my report to Lakeshire, located north of this tower, and deliver it to Magistrate Solomon. Inform him that we need a more comprehensive solution for dealing with the [[gnoll]]s. Suggest explosives. Lots of explosives.

And stick to the road if you know what's good for you.

What's good for you is staying alive, by the way. In case you didn't know what was good for you. You now know... Oh never mind!

== Progress ==
Where did I put my monocle?!  {{NPC||Bailiff Conacher||Conacher}} is that you?

== Completion ==
<Magistrate Solomon puts on his monocle.>

Oh, you're not Conacher. What have you got there?

<Magistrate Solomon takes Parker's report from you.>

Oh for pity's sake. {{NPC||Yowler}}? AGAIN?

== Notes ==
Follow the road to Lakeshire. Pick up the flight path before crossing the bridge over Lake Everstill that, after five years, is finally complete! However... there's a Huge Boulder that's pinning {{NPC||Foreman Oslow}} down. The six bridge workers are trying to get it off under {{NPC||Marshal Marris}}'s watchful, if rested, eyes. Enter the [[Lakeshire Town Hall]] to come across a line of angry Redridge Citizens upset at Solomon's inactivity.

==Progression==
