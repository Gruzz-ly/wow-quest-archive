== Objectives ==
Enlist the help of {{NPC||John J. Keeshan}} at the [[Lakeshire Inn]] in [[Lakeshire]].

== Description ==
You ever heard of John Keeshan, <name>? I was his commanding officer throughout all three great wars. Let me tell you, that man has killed more orcs than any man alive. If ayone can stop the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orc]] invasion, it's JOHN J. KEESHAN. We need to get him to help us or Lakeshire will be nothing more than a mound of rubble and ash after that massive Blackrock Army marches through to [[Elwynn Forest|Elwynn]].

I heard he was fighting in the underground fight club at the Lakeshire inn. Find him and tell him everything you know.

== Completion ==
Help you? Help these people? These people that would rather spit on me than crack a smile?

== Notes ==
Head to the inn and then go downstairs. Keeshan is in a fist fight with {{NPC||Big Earl}}.
