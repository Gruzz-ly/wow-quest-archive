== Objectives ==
Recover the Blackrock Orc Missive.
*[[Blackrock Orc Missive]]

== Description ==
<The gnomecorder crackles and pops.>

It would appear that the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]] have finally wised up. I'm getting reports that they're joining forces with the [[gnoll]]s and planning an attack. I want details, <name>!

I need you to check out [[Rethban Caverns]], located in the western region of [[Redridge Canyons]]. Look for orcs with dark skin. Kill any that you encounter and search their corpses for information.

Solomon, out.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||8}}

== Progress ==
What have you found out?

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Magistrate Solomon.jpg|Magistrate Solomon|Fluent in orcish.}}
<The gnomecorder buzzes and whirs.>

Just put the missive in the little compartment and I'll read it. I am fluent in [[Orcish (language)|orcish]].

<You hear a distraught yell in the background.>

It looks like these orcs are here under the direct command of [[Yowler]]. That means Yowler must have the orc invasion plan.

== Notes ==
The entrance to the caverns is north of the westernmost camp of the canyons at {{co|20.1|31.8|Redridge Mountains}} north of Lakeshire.
