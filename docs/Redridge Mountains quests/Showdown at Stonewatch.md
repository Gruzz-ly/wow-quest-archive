== Objectives ==
Kill Tharil'zun and Gath'Ilzogg.
*[[Tharil'zun]] slain
*[[Gath'Ilzogg]] slain

== Description ==
Only the [[High Command#Blackrock high command|Blackrock high command]] remains, <name>. They're all holed up in [[Stonewatch Keep]], directly south of our position here at [[Keeshan's Post]]. I want you and the rest of Bravo Company to enter Stonewatch and put an end to the Blackrock orc invasion.

<Name>, no survivors.

== Progress ==
This doesn't look good.

== Completion ==

<The Bravo Company field kit beeps loudly.>

Come in, <name>.  Are you there? If you can hear me: Blackrock has the upper hand.  I repeat.  Blackrock has the upper hand.  GET BRAVO COMPANY OUT OF TH...

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest puts the company in the player's party, which is a good thing as the only orcs remaining are elites! 

Waiting outside the keep proper at {{co|60.3|47.5|Redridge Mountains}} is Tharil'zun with two guards.

Gath'Ilzogg is ''not'' in the keep, but southwest of it at {{co|57.8|56.3|Redridge Mountains}} standing on the very edge of the broken bridge.
:{{text|say|Gath'Ilzogg|Your corpses will feed the Blackrock war machine.}}
He's a [[death knight]], though... That's odd. Killing both of them completes the quest automatically.
