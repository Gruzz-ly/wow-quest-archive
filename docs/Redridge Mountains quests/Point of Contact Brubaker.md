== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Brubaker}}.

== Description ==
Before we do a damned thing we need to get a field kit together. You'll help with that, <name>. There's also a matter of scouting. Thankfully for that we got some help from [[Stormwind]]. An old war buddy of mine, Brubaker, was sent here by [[SI:7]] to scout around for us. You're to meet him in the field, just south of here.

Meet up with Brubaker and find out what he knows.

== Completion ==
Brubaker is dead. It looks like the orcs are attempting to send a message with this grizzly display. Upon closer examination you notice something in Brubaker's pouch.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Hunting the Hunters]] and [[Bravo Company Field Kit: Camouflage]] before heading out. Brubaker got himself killed directly south of camp. He's strung up to a skin of some kind in front of a rock.

Even though Brubaker is dead, his eyes still blink.
