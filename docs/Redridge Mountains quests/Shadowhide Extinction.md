==Objectives==
Kill any 20 [[Shadowhide Gnoll Clan|Shadowhide Gnolls]].
*Shadowhide Gnoll slain x20

==Description==
Now that every [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orc]] south of [[Lake Everstill]] is nothing more than ash and cinder, we can turn our attention to the Shadowhide gnoll army of [[Galardell Valley]], directly north of here.

I want you to head out there and kill 'em all, <name>! Initiate Operation: Extinction, soldier. For Bravo Company and for the Alliance!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shadowhide Boots
|Danforth's Breastplate
|Shadowhide Footguards
}}

You will also receive:
* 800 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Are they all dead?

==Completion==

<Danforth's voice comes in over the Bravo Company field kit.>

Hello? Is this thing on?

<You hear Keeshan's voice in the background, and some muffled scrapes as they adjust the signal.>

There we go. Good work, <name>. We're closing in on the [[High Command#Blackrock high command|Blackrock high command]]. There's nowhere left for those dogs to run.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Dark Tower]] before heading out. Don't focus on killing gnolls!

Fangor is all the way to the north at {{co|67.5|28.9|Redridge Mountains}} in a small cave. Then head back to the [[Tower of Ilgalar]] and up to the top to confront [[Grand Magus Doane]] in [[The Grand Magus Doane]].
