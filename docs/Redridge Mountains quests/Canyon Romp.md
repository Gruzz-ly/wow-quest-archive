== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Magistrate Solomon.jpg|Magistrate Solomon|Watch out for canyon ettins!}}
Collect 10 Redridge Gnoll Collars.
*[[Redridge Gnoll Collar]] x10

== Description ==
<The gnomecorder hums.>

The first order of business is a romp through the [[Redridge Canyons]], directly north of [[Lakeshire]]. Kill every [[gnome]] that you see... woops, did I say gnome? I meant [[gnoll]]. Kill every GNOLL that you see and take their collars as proof of deed.

I must warn you, <name>; while you are out there, watch out for [[ettin]]s. My scouts have reported seeing huge, bloodthirsty ettins roaming the canyons lately. Stay out of their way if you want to remain alive.

Solomon out. I'll be in touch.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||16}}

== Progress ==
Did you recover those collars?

== Completion ==
<The gnomecorder crackles and pops.>

Good work, <name>. I've just been handed some important information. It would appear that our most hated enemy, the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]], have wised up...

<The gnomecorder whirs as a compartment opens up.>

I've transferred a few silver over to you for the gnome, erm, gnoll kills.

("These gnolls have wised up!")

== Notes ==
Look north of the graveyard, then start killing and collecting crates. Also, while killing gnolls, keep an eye out for the [[Dirt-Stained Scroll]], which starts [[He Who Controls the Ettins]].
