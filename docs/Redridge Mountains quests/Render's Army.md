== Objectives ==
Kill any 25 [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock Orcs]] in [[Alther's Mill]] or [[Render's Camp]].
*Blackrock Orcs of Alther's Mill or Render's Camp slain x25

== Description ==
Heading up north, eh? How about you wage your own little war against those Blackrock monsters? What do you say, <name>?

Kill any Blackrock orc that you see at Alther's Mill or Render's Camp. Kill until your skin turns red from their blood spatter and then come back to me and I'll pay you handsomely.

It might not stop the Blackrock invasion, but it'll be sure to put a kink in their plans.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

== Progress ==
How goes the orc slaughter?

== Completion ==
You've probably bought us another day, maybe two. Nice work, <name>.

== Notes ==
After picking up [[Weapons of War]] and [[In Search of Bravo Company]], inside the town hall, pick both this and [[Surveying Equipment]] up outside near the bridge.

Don't focus on killing every orc in sight. There are going to be plenty of orcs to kill in this trip out and back.
