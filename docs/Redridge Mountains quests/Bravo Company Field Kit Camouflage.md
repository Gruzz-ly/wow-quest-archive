== Objectives ==
Gather 5 Piles of Leaves and 5 pieces of Fox Poop.
*[[Pile of Leaves (Redridge Mountains)]] x5
*[[Fox Poop]] x5

== Description ==
We're gonna need some supplies before we take out the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] army and save [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]]. That's where you come in, rookie.

{{NPC||John J. Keeshan||Keeshan}} put me in charge of getting camouflage together for the Bravo Company field kit. What I need you to do is head south and do a little "gardening." There are two parts to this little adventure that you should know about: (1) Leaves and (2) Fox poop. We need 'em both.

What did you think camo was made of?

Head south and gather what I asked for, pal.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||10}}

== Progress ==
Leaves and poop - that's what I need.

== Completion ==
Nice job, rookie. I'm gonna go ahead and put the camo in the box. We should be ready soon.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Point of Contact: Brubaker]] and [[Hunting the Hunters]] before heading out. Head southwest to the [[Lakeridge Highway]] and start looking around. Fox poop is everywhere and piles of leaves are under trees...

==Progression==
