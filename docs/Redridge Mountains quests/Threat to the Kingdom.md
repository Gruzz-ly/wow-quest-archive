== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Magistrate Solomon}} at [[Lakeshire]] in [[Redridge]].

== Description ==
There is no doubt that the [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] pose a great threat to the kingdom, but we certainly cannot enter their hideout and hope that everything will work itself out. No, an assault against the Defias is going to take time and planning. I want you to leave the logistics to me. Our kingdom has other threats that must be dealt with immediately!

Travel east through [[Elwynn Forest|Elwynn]] to Redridge and report to Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire. I will call for you when we are ready to attack the Defias.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Completion ==
I heard about the Defias making a return. Terrible news. I wish I had better news, but it would appear that Lakeshire is under attack! We are losing citizens left and right. Our own guard are spread far too thin to handle the situation. We need a hero to step up!

== Notes ==
Players should be eligible for [[Hero's Call: Redridge Mountains! (NPC)|Hero's Call: Redridge Mountains!]] at this point. Pick it up. Players will be passing past [[Three Corners]] in Redridge to get to Lakeshire to turn in to Solomon.

Players should receive the [[Eastvale Logging Camp]] flight path at time of character creation. Fly there and head east to Redridge.
