# Redridge Mountains questing guide

This is a questing guide detailing an efficient method to obtain and complete quests in the [[Redridge Mountains]].

For a list of all Redridge quests in table format, see [[Redridge Mountains quests]]. 

[[File:Icon-warning-22x22.png|Note]] '''Note''': This guide is not meant for power-leveling purposes. Rather, it is meant to show a player an efficient way to complete many quests available for a particular zone. If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired).

== Level 18-19 ==

Redridge Mountains are officially listed as appropriate for levels 15 to 25. However in practice it makes most sense to visit this zone around level 18 or 19 and before hitting the [[Deadmines]] Instance. By this time you'll have finished much of [[Westfall]] and [[Loch Modan]], but could use a bit of toughening before digging into the [[Wetlands]] and [[Duskwood]].

This guide assumes you'll want to do the Deadmines and picks up the prerequisite quests on that understanding. See [[The Deadmines walkthrough]] when you're ready.

* Head east into the Redridge Mountains. Talk to Guard Parker.
* Before the bridge, turn in one quest and get flight path.
* In Lakeshire, grab more quests.
* From now on, kill any Great Goretusk, Tarantula and Dire condor you see.
* From the end of dock, swim east going under the bridge until you find "Glinting Mud", looking like a pile of dirt on lake bottom. Loot the necklace. It's possible for the mud to be west of the dock, too.
* Southwest of Lakeshire are gnoll camps. You don't need to complete all your kills at this time.
* Head to Guard Parker near Elwynn Forest entrance.
* East is a dirt path going south and east. Follow for more gnoll camps. Now you should complete [[Assessing the Threat]]
* When you got all the Tarantula drops, head north to Lake Everstill. About in the middle (41,54) you'll find a sunken row boat with the chest next to it. Loot the chest for Oslow's tools. Watch out for the Lake Threasher!
* Swim to the southern shore to hunt more condors. These are scarcer and you might need to travel considerably east to find all necessary.
* If you need more Goretusks, there should have respawned south of Lakeshire by now.
* Return to Lakeshire and turn in quests.
* Martie Jainrose is just west of the Inn to get the follow up [[Delivering Daffodils]] before you return to Darcy.

* Kill any [[Black Dragon Whelp (Redridge Mountains)|Black Dragon Whelp]] you spy.
* Head east to the Murloc camp. Kill them until you complete [[Murloc Poachers]] and [[Selling Fish]].
* Head north along the road. When you find the path heading west, find a gnoll camp and kill to complete [[A Baying of Gnolls]] and [[The Everstill Bridge]]. There are more mystics northwest if you need them.
* Return to the road and follow it north, but don't enter the camp at (44,18) yet. Instead you'll head south, through the pass east of the road, killing Blackrock Orcs this way until you come back to Lakeshire. Repeat this circle, killing Whelps and Orcs until you complete both quests.
* Return to Lakeshire and turn in quests. Sell trash and repair.

After the easy and efficient questing is done in [[Redridge Mountains]], you'll want to review the [[Duskwood questing guide]] for hints about that zone and other adventures for the level 20-30 character.
