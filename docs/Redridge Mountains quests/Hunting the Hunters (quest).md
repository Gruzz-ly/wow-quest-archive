== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Blackrock Hunters.
*[[Blackrock Hunter]] slain x8

== Description ==
Just south of here on the [[Lakeridge Highway]] are a group of [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] orcs that stalk the forests under cover of darkness and ambush the unitiated. That group is the first line of defense for the Blackrock army. They're scouts, reporting everything they see back to their central command. They need to be taken OUT or our mission here could be compromised.

Head south and kill every Blackrock hunter that you see.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||10}}

== Progress ==
NO MERCY!

== Completion ==
Great work, <name>. We need to move quickly before they send for reinforcements.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Point of Contact: Brubaker]] and [[Bravo Company Field Kit: Camouflage]] before heading out. Go southwest to the Lakeridge Highway and start killing. The hunters are very weakly stealthed using Camouflage.
