== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Muckdweller Glands.
*[[Muckdweller Gland]] x8

== Description ==
The first part of this mission is all covert ops, <name>. To that end, we need to be able to incapacitate the enemy without making any sounds. To do that we're going to need chloroform.

The {{NPC||muckdweller}}s at the bottom of [[Lake Everstill]] hold chloroform in their glands. I'm going to need you to go underwater and recover muckdweller glands. Think you can handle it?

Come back to me once you've recovered enough glands.

Where's the lake you ask? Open your eyes, dummy. Directly west.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vial of Chloroform
|Muckdweller Gloves
|Everstill Breastplate
|Muckdweller Handguards
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Did you recover the glands?

== Completion ==
Perfect. Those orcs won't know what hit 'em - literally. I'll need a few minutes to get these in working order and then I'll put them in the Bravo Company field kit.
