==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Watch Captain Parker}} at [[Tower Watch]] in [[Redridge Mountains]].

==Description==
While the situation here is dire, other parts of the region are literally quaking from the [[Cataclysm (event)|great upheaval]].

I have here a report from Watch Captain Parker of Redridge Mountains, one of our territories east of [[Elwynn Forest]]. He is asking for a hero to come to their aid.

We are spread so thin here that I don't know how we can afford to send any more military. Would you check up on Parker and see what he needs? You will find Watch Captain Parker atop the tower at [[Three Corners]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Parker's Yardstick
|Belt of Unsolvable Problems
|Doody Boots
|Unfortunate Treads
|Doody Shoes
}}

You will also receive: 
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Heard [[Westfall]] was in some deep doody.

<Parker doesn't even turn to face you.>

Well, we got our own set of problems here. See them [[gnoll]]s out there? Looks like they're actin' up again. I don't like it. Don't like it one bit.
