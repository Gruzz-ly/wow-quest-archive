:{{text|say|Grand Magus Doane|Did you truly believe that the orcs had the presence of mind required to plan an invasion of this magnitude?}}
:{{text|say|Grand Magus Doane|No matter. You will die now, a paltry offering to [[Deathwing]] as our march upon Stormwind begins.}}

Aggro him and he returns to dragon form:
:{{text|yell|Darkblaze|Feed the master's rage! COME AND DIE!}}
:''The fight progresses as normal, until ~10% health:''
:{{text|yell|Darkblaze|I grow tired of these games!}}
:{{text|yell|Darkblaze|Suffer in flames!}}
:''Darkblaze hovers, unleashing his breath attack, dealing 2000 Fire damage to all enemies, instantly killing Krakauer, Danforth, Jorgensen and Messner.''
:{{text|yell|John J. Keeshan|You gutless bastard! You've killed 'em all! Now I kill you!}}
:''Keeshan jumps into Darkblaze's mouth, who, heavily wounded, starts to fly away over Lake Everstill.''
:{{text|yell|Darkblaze|You will die with me, Keeshan! This world has enough heroes!}}
:''Nearing the bridge, Darkblaze succumbs to his wounds and dies, falling into the lake.''
Head back to Troteman at Keeshan's Post to turn in. There are no enemies in or around [[Stonewatch]] to interfere.
