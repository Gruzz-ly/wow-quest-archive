==Objectives==
Recover 8 Redridge Supply Crates.
*[[Redridge Supply Crate]] (8)

==Description==
We were raided last night, or perhaps it was the night before. I'm not really sure when it was as I haven't had a wink of sleep in three days. I'm probably delusional at this point.

Listen, [[gnoll]]s raided our supply stores and took off with everything! Just like a fart in the wind, they were in and they were OUT! My soldiers saw them running back toward the [[Redridge Canyons|canyons]], northwest of here. Recover our supplies, <class>!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Breadwinner's Gloves
|Ventillated Leggings
|Starvation Vest
|Cloak of Insomnia
|Starvation Leggings
|Ventillated Vest
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|30}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Did you recover the supplies?

==Completion==
Thank you, citizen. Without you, we would have starved or worse, been forced to go out and get food ourselves.

==Notes==
Players are offered this quest while heading to the graveyard during [[Tuning the Gnomecorder]]. Which is great, because the followup to "Tuning" is [[Canyon Romp]], which also involves a trek to the canyons to the north... Look north of the graveyard, then start killing and collecting crates. Also, while killing gnolls, keep an eye out for the [[Dirt-Stained Scroll]], which starts [[He Who Controls the Ettins]].
