==Objectives==
Find Nida's Necklace, and return it to [[Nida]] in [[Lakeshire]].

*[[Nida's Necklace]]

==Description==
My friend [[Nida]] lost her necklace, and we can't find it. We've been fishing all day right here, and we looked around here already. 

The only thing I can think of is that it fell into the lake. Our parents don't want us to swim in the lake... my mom says there's some mean things underwater, but you look like you aren't scared of mean things.

Could you find it for her, please?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Hi. I miss my necklace. My daddy got it for me. Daddy says that there are monsters in the lake. Did you beat up any monsters?

==Completion==
Thank you for finding my necklace <mister/miss> <class>... you are very kind! My kitty thanks you too - isn't that right [[Effsee]]?

==Notes==
The Necklace itself can be found in a pile of [[Glinting Mud]] at the bottom of the lake's western section.

On complete:
