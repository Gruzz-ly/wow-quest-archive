== Objectives ==
Steal the Gnoll Battle Plans, Gnoll Orders and Gnoll Strategy Guide.
*[[Gnoll Battle Plans]]
*[[Gnoll Orders]]
*[[Gnoll Strategy Guide]]

== Description ==
Damned worthless [[gnoll]]s are up to no good. I can feel it in my bones. Gnoll activity in the area has tripled in the past two weeks. I fear they might be mounting up to make an assault on [[Lakeshire]].

I need you to head to each of the gnoll camps of this area and gather any information you come across. Check the camps directly north of here, east of here and southwest of here. Bring back whatever you find.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Yowling Cloak
|Boots of the Prolific Sire
|Belt of the Sons
|Striders of the Prolific Sire
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|30}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

{{itembox||Message Carrier
}}

== Progress ==
Did you find the gnoll plans?

== Completion ==
I knew it! Looks like {{NPC||Yowler}} is behind this uprising - which is incredible, because we keep killing gnolls named Yowler. I don't know how many sons the original Yowler had, but it's got to be close to a hundred.

Well, looks like we got ourselves another Yowler to kill.

{{NPC||Magistrate Solomon}} must be notified.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[WANTED: Redridge Gnolls]] before heading out.
