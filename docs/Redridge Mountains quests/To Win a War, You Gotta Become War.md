==Description==
[[File:Fox Poop Disguise.jpg|thumb|They'll never see you coming with your fox poop disguise.]]
<The Bravo Company radio beeps.>

Do you understand yet, <name>? Do you now see what we gotta do to win a war against these monsters? YOU GOTTA BECOME WAR! NO MERCY!

With the P.O.W.s freed you're clear to plant the seaforium. Carefully make your way into each of the structures out there and plant a cahrge.

Plant a seaforium charge at the Blackrock munitions hut and the Blackrock tower. Once you're done come meet up with me and the rest of the Bravo Company at [[Shalewind Canyon]], east of [[Render's Valley]].

==Completion==
And now, we blow the whole damned thing up.

Accepting the quest gives players another ability with the field kit:

*{{abilities|Plant Seaforium|range=10|Places Seaforium Charge at desired location.|notes=Instant|cd=3 sec}}

Carefully, CAREFULLY, get to the top of the tower. It will take a distract at the base for the four outside, a chloroform for the one guard inside on the first floor, then a distract on the top floor for the three guards in front of the flag room. Distract, get in, plant the seaforium, then get out!
:{{text|bossemote|You have successfully planted the seaforium at the Blackrock tower.}}
Same process for the munitions hut, but this time there's only one set of guards to avoid.
:{{text|bossemote|You have successfully planted the seaforium at the munitions hut.}}

Head east, then up the hill to Shalewind Canyon to find the Bravo Company and the kidnapped citizens. Don't forget to pick up the flight path!
