==Objectives==
Drink the Humanizing Potion, then question Hunter McAlister at [[Redridge Pass]] in [[Redridge Mountains]].
* Drink the [[Humanizing Potion]]
* Hunter questioned
* [[Hunter McAlister]] slain
* Speak to Dark Ranger Lyana at Redridge Pass in Redridge Mountains.
* [[Humanizing Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
Look there, down the hill. One of the [[Alliance]] [[hunter]]s that roam the area.

No one knows these pathways like them. If our quarry passed through here, that hunter would certainly have seen the tracks. His [[dog]]s may even have caught [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]]'s scent.

Here is another dose of the potion. Let us question this one while he is alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's find out everything we can.

==Completion==
Thank you for your assistance in this investigation, champion. We have all but confirmed Saurfang's current location.

I must report back to the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|warchief]] before we make any further moves. We will summon you if we require your assistance again.

==Notes==
Drink the potion. You are transformed into [[Sophia]], Lyana becomes [[Marion Sutton]]. Approach [[Hunter McAlister]] who is accompanied by [[Danger]], [[Franklin]], [[Wallaby]], [[Drooble]], and [[Bernard (mastiff)|Bernard]].

;Potion drank
:{{Text|say|Marion Sutton|Ugh! I'll never get used to the taste of this vile concoction.}}

;Approaching McAlister
:{{Text|say|Marion Sutton|My good sir, can you help us?}}
:{{Text|say|Marion Sutton|A filthy [[orc]] raided our [[Farm|farm]] in the night. He stole a priceless family heirloom!}}
:{{Text|say|Marion Sutton|Have you seen any signs of such a monstrous brute travelling over the pass?}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter McAlister|Found some huge tracks just this morning. They led over the mountain pass and into the swamp.}}
:''One by one, the dogs slowly approach Marion Sutton.''
:{{Text|say|Franklin|Grrr...}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter McAlister|If that was your orc, he's a big one. Best watch yourselves.}}
:{{Text|say|Danger|Rrrr... rouf!}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter McAlister|Must've been your orc that got my dogs all riled up last night.}}
:{{Text|say|Drooble|Ar-ooof!}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter McAlister|They were barking and growling up a storm. They do that whenever one of those [[Horde]] scoundrels comes around.}}
:{{Text|say|Wallaby|Rrrrrr...}}
:{{Text|say|Franklin|GRRRR...}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter McAlister|Come to think of it, sorta like they're doing right now...}}
:{{Text|say|Danger|ROUF!}}
:{{Text|say|Bernard|Bark!}}
:{{Text|yell|Hunter McAlister|Hey! You're with the Horde, aren't you!? Get 'em, boys!}}

McAlister throws a flare, removing the disguise, and he and his dogs immediately attack you. If McAlister is killed, and the dogs are alive, they run away.
:{{Text|say|Franklin|Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!}}
:{{Text|say|Danger|Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!}}
:{{Text|say|Drooble|Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!}}
:{{Text|say|Wallaby|Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!}}
:{{Text|say|Bernard|Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!}}

;Quest completion
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Lyana|I must report back to the warchief. You are to take no further action until you hear from me again. Understood?}}

Lyana rides away, but [[Zekhan]] appears!

:{{Text|say|[[Zekhan]]|Ey mon, over here! I be needin' your help!}}

===The choice===
Now the player is presented with a choice on how to continue the questline. After choosing one option, you will '''NOT''' be able to do quests from the other side. The choice:
#accept the quest [[Zekhan]] offers, [[Grim Tidings]], and side with Varok. End of the questline rewards [[Worn Cloak (toy)]].
#choose the dialogue option and side with Sylvanas. End of the questline rewards [[Glowing Azerite Geode]].

Speak with [[Zekhan]] to make a choice:
{{Dialogue|
Da [[Battle for Lordaeron]] was me first fight. Seein' dat [[Alliance]] army outside da walls be... Well, it got me nerves up, dat's for sure.

Den I saw Saurfang. Dat orc won him a thousand battles! Dem eyes of his didn't look scared... But maybe jus' a bit empty.

Da High Overlord, he give me courage. We remind each other dat da Horde be worth fightin' for.

No way I be lettin' him stand alone. Saurfang need us, champion!

{{Gossip|I will not betray my Warchief, troll.}}
}}

Choosing the dialogue option instead of the quest shows the following window:
:WARNING: This choice will prevent you from completing the main Fate of Saurfang quests, and will grant you an alternative quest instead.

:You will not be able to obtain the Worn Cloak toy, but other rewards will be obtainable.

:Zekhan will remember this, are you sure?
