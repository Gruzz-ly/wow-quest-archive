Starts from [[Kvaldir Attack Plans]], which drops from any of the Kvaldir at Hrothgar's Landing.

==Objectives==
Recover the Heart of the Mists and bring it and the Kvaldir Attack Plans to [[Justicar Mariel Trueheart]] at the [[Argent Tournament Grounds]]. 
* [[Kvaldir Attack Plans]] (Provided)
* [[Heart of the Mists]]

==Description==
Looking over the captured attack plans, you find a map of the [[Eastern Kingdoms]] and [[Kalimdor]] with major settlements marked. Reading over the orders, you learn that [[Kvaldir]] captains have drafted plans for a series of devastating raids.

According to the orders, the attacks are to begin after [[Mistcaller Yngvar]] "consults the Heart of the Mists." Perhaps you could delay the attacks by capturing the omen from the Mistcaller's Cave on the western side of [[Hrothgar's Landing]] and notify Justicar Mariel Trueheart. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{Cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
What is it that you've found, <name>?

==Completion==
<Mariel accepts the orders and the captured seeing crystal and examines both.>

Good work, <name>, and quick thinking. I'm sure the theft of this trinket won't slow them down for long, but I think you've bought us time to warn the leaders of the Horde and Alliance about the impending attacks.
