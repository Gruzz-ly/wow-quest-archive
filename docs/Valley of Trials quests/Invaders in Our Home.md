== Objectives ==
Slay 7 Northwatch Scouts.
* [[Northwatch Scout]] slain (7)

== Description ==
You're not just another grunt - you seem to be a serious <class>. Good, because that's exactly what I need.

Try not to let the word out, since I don't want to cause a panic... but there have been reports of more humans nearby. This is an egregious betrayal of the peace that we negotiated with that miserable [[Jaina Proudmoore]]! We can't allow humans here in [[Durotar]], and especially not here in the Valley.

You will find them to the south. Slay them quickly, before their numbers increase any more.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Aversion Leggings
|Scout Hunter Vest
|Hearth Defender Bracers
|Valley Defense Hauberk
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Quickly, <name>. Dispatch of these humans in our valley.

== Completion ==
Executed with quickness and discretion.  A job well done. 

==Progression==
{{Orcish starting experience}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Valley Defense Hauberk]] added as a reward.}}
