You are asked by [[Hana'zua]], a dying troll, to kill the beast he could not, the beast whose stinger inflicted his mortal wound - [[Sarkoth]].

{{questportrait|Sarkoth.jpg|Sarkoth|Be ready to dodge his poison, friend.}}
==Objectives==
Kill [[Sarkoth]] and bring his claw back to [[Hana'zua]].
*[[Sarkoth's Mangled Claw]]

==Description==
<Class>! I thought I would die out here with none to know of it. While I was hunting the [[Scorpid Worker|scorpids]] of the [[Valley of Trials|Valley]], I came across a particularly vicious-looking one. Hurling myself at it, I managed to inflict a massive blow to its [[Sarkoth's Mangled Claw|claw]] before it closed around my leg.

I wasn't ready for its stinger though, and it sliced down and into my chest, cutting into my flesh and letting my blood. Please, you must kill the scorpid for me! My honor must be upheld! I fought it up on the plateau to the south.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||90|}}
* 45-450 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Ahhh… my father always said I would never amount to much, and here, lying beneath a tree as life seeps away, I'm afraid it looks like he was right.

At least I wish to die knowing that my last enemy in life lays dead.

==Completion==
My blow was not enough to kill him, but looking at the damage I inflicted gives me some small measure of pride.  That small measure will be all I have to sustain myself if I die, and in that light, the short list of my life's accomplishments fills me with anger.

==Notes==
As the quest description says, [[Sarkoth]] can be found on the plateau to the south of [[Hana'zua]]'s location.  Look for a ramp leading up.  [[Sarkoth]] roams all over the plateau, and there is a small rise on the right side of the ramp that [[Sarkoth]] wanders over to.  If he is at that location when you come up the ramp, he will surprise you from behind the rise.

[[Sarkoth]] is not that hard to kill - he is a level 4 [[scorpid]] and has more hit points than the level 3 [[Scorpid Worker]]s nearby, but he doesn't do significantly more damage.  A level 3 character can easily kill him.
