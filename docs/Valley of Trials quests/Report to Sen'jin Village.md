Your efforts against the [[Burning Blade]] in the [[Valley of Trials]] have come to an end.  You are to leave the [[Valley of Trials|valley]] and head to [[Sen'jin Village]] to find out if the [[Burning Blade]] has reached them.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Master Gadrin]] in [[Sen'jin Village]].

==Description==
Your trials against the [[Burning Blade]] are finished... here in the Valley.  But I want you to report your findings.

Go to the [[troll]] village of Sen'jin and seek out [[Master Gadrin]].  [[Sen'jin Village]] is east out of the valley, then right at the fork.

Tell Gadrin of the Burning Blade, and that they have reached the [[Valley of Trials]].  Discover from him if they have yet reached Sen'jin.

Go, <name>, and be swift.  I fear the evil found in the [[Burning Blade Coven]] is but the herald of a larger threat...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||50}}
*230 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
Hm... your report comes at a bad time.  The Burning Blade is no longer seen here in Sen'jin, but we will be vigilant in our efforts to prevent their return to the area.

The [[orc]]s are friends of the [[Darkspear Trolls]].  Honorable friends.  We want to help the orcs, but... we need help too.

==Notes==
Leave the [[Valley of Trials]] and stay on the road until you come to the main [[Durotar]] north/south road.  Turning right (south) will lead you to [[Sen'jin Village]].
