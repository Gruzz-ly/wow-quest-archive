==Objectives==
Bring the news of [[Hana'zua]]'s plight to [[Gornek]] at the [[Den]].

==Description==
Seeing the deed you have done for me steels my heart. I cannot fall so easily! I must endure!

But it remains that I cannot make the trek back to the Den unassisted. Please, <name>, return to the Den and tell Gornek of my situation. Perhaps he can help me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Armbands of Praise
|Gloves of the Helping Hand
|Girdle of Honor
|Aid-Lender's Grips
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||15}}
* 50 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +25 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]
*[[Dusty Bag]]

==Completion==
From your description of the beast, I believe you must be speaking of [[Sarkoth]]! It is no wonder that Hana'zua was overtaken by it. Aid will be dispatched to him immediately, trouble yourself no more with Hana'zua's plight.

However, I must say, I am most impressed to hear that you brought Sarkoth to death. It is a feat to be proud of, <name>. And that you would fight for a stranger's honor, while other tasks occupied your time, your own honor is heightened.
