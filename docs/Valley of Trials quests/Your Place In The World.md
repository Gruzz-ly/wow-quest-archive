== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Gornek]].

== Description ==
Finally, you are of age, <name>... of age to battle in the name of the Horde. To conquer for the glory of the [[Warchief]].

Yes...

<[[Kaltunk]] looks you over.>

You will do nicely.

No doubt you wish to find a great dragon or demon and strangle it with your bare hands, but perhaps it would be wise to start on something less... dangerous.

<Kaltunk laughs.>

Report to Gornek, he should be able to assign a task better suited to a young <class>. You will find him seated at the fire behind me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 100 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Completion ==
Another one of Kaltunk's recruits, hm?

A sorry state of affairs we find ourselves in if this is the best the Horde can produce. No matter. By the time we think you're ready to leave the [[Valley of Trials|Valley]], you'll be a proud warrior of the Horde.
