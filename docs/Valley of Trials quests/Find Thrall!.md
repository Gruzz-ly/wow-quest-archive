==Objectives==
Find [[Thrall]] by using Vol'jin's Hearthstone.
*[[Vol'jin's Hearthstone]] (provided)

==Description==

Find Thrall.

<With an effort, Vol'jin thrusts a hearthstone into your hands and then passes out.>

You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]

*+250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
You have come a long way to see me, <race>. Speak.

==Completion==
<Thrall stares at the stone you have handed him.>

Vol'jin's hearthstone? My friend, has it come to this?

==Notes==
Use the hearthstone to teleport to the [[Valley of Trials]]. [[Aggra]] is kneeling besides an [[Durak|orc baby]], and [[Thrall]] is standing by the bonfire in front of [[Attentive Pupil]]s.
