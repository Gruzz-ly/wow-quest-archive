# Orcish starting experience

[[File:WorldMap-ValleyofTrialsStart.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''orcish starting experience''' takes place in [[Valley of Trials]], in southwestern [[Durotar]]. In this questline, players are sent out into the Valley to collect various materials and kill various enemies to prove themselves to [[Gornek]]. After [[Sting of the Scorpid]], the player's class trainer asks for them and they leave Gornek behind to continue their training. Players finally help [[Zureetha Fargaze]] cleanse the Valley of the [[Burning Blade clan]] starting in the quest [[Vile Familiars]]. After clearing out the Burning Blade, Zureetha sends players to [[Sen'jin Village]] and the [[Durotar storyline]] begins!
