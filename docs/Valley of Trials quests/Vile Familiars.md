The [[Burning Blade]] is a covert organization that works to undermine the [[Horde]]. They have infiltrated the [[Valley of Trials]] and brought their demonic corruption with them. [[Zureetha Fargaze]] wants you to go to the [[Burning Blade Coven]] and cull the [[Vile Familiar]]s that are spilling out of it.

==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Vile Familiar]]s.
*[[Vile Familiar]] slain (8)

==Description==
I trust the [[Valley of Trials]] will teach you much, young <class>.

I was sent to the Valley to guide you, but I have discovered a growing taint here...

One of the [[Burning Blade]] - a foul, demon-worshipping cult - has made camp here in the Valley of Trials. He skulks in a cave to the north, and his vile familiars have spilled from its mouth to cause havoc.

As your first task against the Burning Blade, I bid you, defeat these familiars. Slay many and, if you survive, return to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You may choose one of the following:|Vile Slippers|Vile Boots|Vile Greaves|Vile Jersey}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||1|50}}
*540 [[XP]]
*+350 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]] 

==Progress==
To prove yourself against the Burning Blade, you must first defeat its Vile Familiars.  Return to me when you have done this.

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>.

Although the Vile Familiars were merely pets of the darker powers within the Burning Blade, your success against them foretells greater deeds ahead.

==Notes==
;Approach Zureetha Fargaze
:{{Text|say|Zureetha Fargaze|<Class>, I have an important mission for you.}}

The [[Burning Blade Coven]] is located north and east of [[the Den]], beyond the [[Mottled Boar]]s and [[Scorpid Worker]]s. On your main map, you will see a cave in that general area - that is the [[Burning Blade Coven]]. There you will find [[Vile Familiar]]s - level 3-4 humanoids - around the entrance to the cave, as well as inside the cave. You will not need to enter the cave to kill 8 [[Vile Familiar]]s as enough are found outside. Be warned - their respawn rate is somewhat fast, so be careful of enemies reappearing behind you.

For beginning orcs and trolls, [[Vile Familiar]]s introduce a new type of attack - ranged. Their ranged attack is [[Fireball]], which causes 3-4 damage. It is not a DoT ([[Damage over Time]]) attack.

==Progression==
{{Orcish starting experience}}
