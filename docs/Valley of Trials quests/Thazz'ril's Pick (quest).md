[[Foreman Thazz'ril]] has left his favorite [[Thazz'ril's Pick|pick]] behind in the [[Burning Blade Coven]] and could not retrieve it because of the [[Vile Familiar]]s and the [[Felstalker (mob)|Felstalker]]s.  He wants you to retrieve it for him.

==Objectives==
Bring [[:Thazz'ril's Pick]] to [[Foreman Thazz'ril]].
*[[Thazz'ril's Pick]]

==Description==
<Name>, you are a dependable <race>.  Can I count on you for another task?

Some time ago I was surveying the [[Burning Blade Coven|cave]] to the north for minerals, and I left my favorite [[Thazz'ril's Pick|pick]] behind.  When I later returned to retrieve it I found the cave was filled with vicious beasts!  Will you go into the cave, the [[Burning Blade Coven]], and get my pick?

I left it in a chamber with waterfalls.  My [[Thazz'ril's Pick|pick]] has a spell on it so you can see it in the dark, so you won't have to worry about finding it... just what's guarding it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|50}}
*450 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*+350 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you entered the [[Burning Blade Coven]], <name>?  Did you find my [[Thazz'ril's Pick|pick]]?

==Completion==
Great, you got it!  Thanks a lot, <name>.  This is my favorite pick!  Now if my [[Lazy Peon|peons]] ever finish chopping down these trees, maybe we can find a nice cave to mine!

===Notes===
[[File:Route to Thazz'Ril's Pick.png|thumb|Route to pick.]]
The cave [[Foreman Thazz'ril]] is referring to is the [[Burning Blade Coven]] - the cave in the area where you killed the Vile Familiars for the quest [[Vile Familiars]] - north and east of [[The Den]].  The cave entrance is at (45,56).  It is full of level 3-4 [[Vile Familiar]]s (humanoids) and [[Felstalker (mob)|Felstalker]]s (demons).

Continue inside, and you will soon come to a point where the cave splits into three sections - take the middle one.  Head roughly west from the point where you entered the large chamber, and you will see the glow of [[Thazz'ril's Pick]] in the back, in front of a rock pillar near some waterfalls.  The coordinates for the pick are {{co|43|53|Durotar}}.

The [[Thazz'ril's Pick]] can be found inside the [[Burning Blade Coven]] {{co|44|54|Durotar}}.  On entering the cavern, it jack-knife's to the left.  You are then confronted by three tunnels, take the center tunnel. The pick can then be seen near the water area.  There is a 10 second respawn time.

==Progression==
{{Orcish starting experience}}
