==Objectives==
Slaughter 6 Mottled Boars.
* [[Mottled Boar]] slaughtered (6)

==Description==
The first order of business will be to put a little strength in your backbone. I could send you out to the [[Barrens]] to hunt [[kodo]], but well, in all honesty, you're more useful to us alive than dead.

I believe you'll be of more use to us slaughtering the [[boar]]s you'll find in the farms to the north and northeast of here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mottled Bracers
|Boar Hide Belt
|Bragger's Gauntlets
|Cord of Accomplishment
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
I hope you haven't returned to try and convince me that you have completed your task, <name>. No, of course not. I would think better of you.

==Completion==
Hmmm, not bad, <name>. But don't let it get to your head...you'll fight tougher than boars in your career.

Nonetheless, you've proven yourself well, and your next trial will be against a considerably more dangerous opponent, so you'll need some extra protection.

==Progression==
{{Orcish starting experience}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Cord of Accomplishment]] added as a reward.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Updated for ''Cataclysm''. No longer rewards [[Battleworn Leather Gloves]] and [[Soft Wool Boots]].}}
