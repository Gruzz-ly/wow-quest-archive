== Objectives ==
Use the Foreman's Blackjack on 4 [[Lazy Peon]]s when they're sleeping.
* Peons Awoken (4)
* [[Foreman's Blackjack]] (provided)

== Description ==
[[File:Lazy Peons TCG.jpg|thumb]]
Cursed [[peon]]s! They work hard gathering [[lumber]] from the [[tree]]s of [[Valley of Trials|the valley]], but they're always taking naps! I need someone to help keep the peons in line.

You look like the right <race> for my task. Here, you take this blackjack and use it on any lazy peons you find sleeping on the job. A good smack will get them right back to work! Return the blackjack when you're done.

Look for them underneath the trees in the valley. Lousy slacking peons...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|50}}

== Progress ==
No good lazy...

Eh? Do you have my blackjack? Did you catch any peons sleeping on the job?!

== Completion ==
Good, good. Maybe they'll think twice before slacking next time! Thanks for the help!

== Notes ==
The [[Lazy Peon]]s are supposed to be cutting wood, but are lazing (obviously) around the large trees in the [[Valley of Trials]]. They go from sleeping, to cutting wood, back to the wood pile, cutting wood, and then sleeping again.  It takes a minute or two for them to cycle through their activities, so if you come across them actually working, just wait a bit for them to take a nap and then whack them.

When you hit them with the [[Foreman's Blackjack]], they say:
:{{text|say|Lazy Peon|Ow! OK, I'll get back to work, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Lazy Peon|Sleepy... so sleepy...}}
:{{text|say|Lazy Peon|OK boss, I get back to tree-hitting.}}

[[Lazy Peon]]s can be found all over the [[Valley of Trials]], both north and south of [[the Den]].  Look for the large trees, and they will be nearby. Here are specific coordinates where you can find some of them:
