==Objectives==
[[File:Konkhular.jpg|thumb|Konkhular]]
Find and slay [[Konkhular|the beast]], then bring back proof to [[Scout Tomul]].
*[[Pelt of Konkhular]]{{Co|78.3|35.17|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Bring the Pelt of Konkhular to [[Scout Tomul]].

==Description==
<You find a large pawprint sunk into the dirt. Looking around, none of the nearby creatures have paws, let alone of that size.

Perhaps the [[centaur]] will be impressed if you hunt this great beast.>

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Drakefire Shield
|Code of the Maruuk
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|52|42|}}
* 11,700 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Do you return from your hunt?

==Completion==
<Tomul looks the pelt over before offering a small nod.>

You defeated Konkhular, then. Not bad, two foot. He has evaded our hunters for many moons. His pelt always blended in well with his surroundings. Perhaps now our hunters can use his camouflage to their own advantage.

==Notes==
A series of [[Mysterious Paw Print]]s similar to the one that starts the quest lead south from the [[Wanderer's Steppe]] to a cave by a river where [[Konkhular]] waits.

==Progression==
{{Into the Plains}}

==Patch changes==
