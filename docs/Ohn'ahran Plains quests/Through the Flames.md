==Objectives==
Collect 4 Smoldering Blossoms while crossing the bridge towards [[Fyrakk]] and [[Vyranoth]].
*Approach the flower {{co|20.4|80.9|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Speak with [[Shandris]]
*[[Smoldering Blossom]] (4)
*Reach the hiding spot

==Description==
[[Druids of the Flame]]...

<Shandris frowns deeply, eyes shut as she holds back her anger.>

To think that they still exist. That any of our people would join Fyrakk and his--

<She stops, releases a heavy breath, and continues.>

We have a mission to complete.

We need to cross the bridge to get close enough to [[Primal Incarnates|the Incarnates]] that we can overhear their conversation. I will shroud us so that we can move between the [[elemental]]s still guarding the way forward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
We need be as close to the Incarnates as we can.

We cannot afford to miss a single word of their conversation.

==Completion==
This is as close as we can get without revealing ourselves.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Do you see that flower near the bridge? Let us take a closer look.}}

Approach the flower on the right side of the path to the bridge:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The druids are not destroying the flora here, they are... pouring their burning magic into it.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|We should take this back to [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]], along with any other samples we find. Let me know when you are ready to begin.}}

Speak with Shandris:
{{book|content=
Those elementals ahead are guarding the bridge leading directly to Fyrakk and Vyranoth.

We cannot risk drawing the attention of the Incarnates, thus destroying the elementals is out of the question.

I can shroud us, but my [[magic]] will not protect us from the fires if we come too close to the elementals. Nor will my magic be able to shroud your drake, should you take to the skies.

Are you ready?

{{gossip|What are Druids of the Flame?}}

The Druids of the Flame are a [[cult]] once led by Archdruid [[Fandral Staghelm]] before his death in the [[Firelands]].

They worshipped [[Ragnaros]] the Firelord, and believed that his power would consume [[Azeroth]] in eternal flame.

{{gossip|How are they different from [[Primalists]]?}}

They both harbor a deep hatred for the [[dragonflight]]s. The difference lies in their goals.

When [[Teldrassil]] emerged, Fandral Staghelm asked the [[dragon]]s to bless it as they once had [[Nordrassil]]. This would have restored our [[immortal]]ity, but the dragons did not believe it wise. Fandral and his [[druid]]s resolved to reclaim their immortality by submitting themselves to the flame, even if it meant the rest of the world would burn.

The Primalists wish to see Azeroth rid of the influence of the [[titan]]s, including the dragons and all they stand for. Their shared hatred may have forged this alliance.

{{gossip|Weren't they wiped out in the Firelands?}}

I had believed we had killed every one of them. Some must have escaped into the Firelands and rekindled their cult.

No matter. We will hunt them down once more.

{{gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Grab this flower, then we can sneak our way towards the Incarnates. Remember to avoid the flames.}}

The adventurer has the Sentinel's Shroud buff. Interact with the flower:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Protective mist... These patches could shield us from the flames wherever we find them.}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|You told me not to harm their beloved children.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|So, you ally with these-- flame zealots?}}

Flying over the bridge to Fyrakk will cause him to notice his enemies with Fyrakk's Burning Gaze:
:{{Text|yell|Fyrakk|Worms belong in the dirt!}}
:''Fyrakk shoots the adventurer with a fireball.''

Approaching them on foot alarms them as well. They both cast a spell and the player is teleported back at the bridge.
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|I have no patience for games.}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|Come out and play, little coward.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|That was close. Be careful.}}

Throughout the quest, Shandris also offers teleport back:
:If you become uncertain of our positioning, I can return us to a safe location.

:{{Gossip|Take us back to a safe spot.}}

The bridge is a bullet hell of [[Revealing Flame]]s and fireballs from a [[Channeling Flamewarden]] moving this way and that. Just before the bridge on the left side is a [[Boon of the Firelands]] jar that serves as quest aid and controls the Lava Slime. Interacting with it pops this prompt:
:Drinking this potion will allow you to pass some of the hazards on the bridge, but will significantly reduce your movement speed.
:{{text|red|It is not required to complete this quest.}}
:Do you want to drink it?

Drink it, or don't, then push northeast along the bridge, dodging the fireballs and elementals. Loot the second flower:
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|We need a path into this [[Emerald Dream|Dream]]. They know the way.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|They do not share our cause. What have you promised them?}}

The third:
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|They do not need such incentives.}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|They seek immortality in the living flame and delightful destruction!}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Ugh. Why can't you ever just have some fun?}}

The fourth is past the bridge just before the steps up to Fyrakk and Vyranoth. Don't enter his flame circle!
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|We can hide in the bushes up ahead. Stay far away from the Incarnates.}}
:''Fyrakk and Vyranoth walk to the northeast.''
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Do you not fear we are losing sight of our goals?}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Nonsense! Victory is within our grasp!}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|With our new allies, we will be more powerful than ever.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|That is not what I mean, Fyrakk.}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Stop fretting and follow me. There is something I want you to see.}}
:''They stop south of the steps, looking at four [[Enflamed Summoner]]s channeling into [[Keeper Larodar]].''

Once the Incarnates stop, find the safe spot east of them and off the path in some bushes:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|We should be safe here, so long as their attention remains on each other.}}

Shandris has new gossip in the hiding spot:
{{book|content=Now it is time to see what Fyrakk is doing in [[Lunedane]].}}
