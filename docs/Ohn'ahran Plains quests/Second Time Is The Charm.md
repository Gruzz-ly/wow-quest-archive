==Objectives==
Determine the origin of the [[:Odd Round Object]].

==Description==
<[[Voraxian]] bounces the Odd Round Object in his hands a few times.>

Hmm, it lands in the hand well, like it was made for this. Let us talk to [[Veritistrasz]] and see if he knows more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let us hope it is something exciting this time!

==Completion==
By the Titans... talk about putting my claw in my jaw. 

Sorry <name>, I will sit here for a bit with Veritistrasz and wait until he is ready to talk again. 

If you find anything else of interest, please do bring it along.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Veritistrasz, have a look at this. It is a small ball, with 3 divots in it. They are clearly intended for small claws, likely drake sized?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Oh, this is quite the find.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|What is it? Some [[arcane]] creation of [[Deathwing|Neltharion]]? A long lost item of [[Titan]]ic significance?!}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|It is an old [[Talon Toss|Lish Llrath]] training ball.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Wait... The game they are starting to play in [[Algeth'ar Academy]]?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Are they now? I was quite good back in the day. Huge crowds came out to watch the games. The stadiums were packed and the roars of the crowd were incredible.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Have you ever heard hundreds of dragons roaring at once? It hits you in the chest and... oh that feeling, it was like a bolt of pure energy! You will never feel so alive!}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|That sounds incredible! Why did you stop playing?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|... When the [[Black dragonflight|black dragons]] fell to corruption, we had other things to worry about than sports.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Oh...}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Would... you like to go and see one of the matches?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|... Maybe another time.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|... Right.}}
