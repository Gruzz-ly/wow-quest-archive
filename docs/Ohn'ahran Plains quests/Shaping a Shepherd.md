==Objectives==
Teach Taivan to herd [[argali]] at the [[Mallakh]].
*Talk to [[Taivan]]
*Command Taivan to herd (3)
*Chase Argali into pen

==Description==
You want me to train your [[bakar]] in shepherding? Well, that's certainly what we do here, but I've never trained one quite so BIG before...

The argali don't seem to be bothered by his presence, though, and they're very good judges of character. Trust me.

I'm willing to give him a shot, but a herding bakar needs to not only be gentle, but smart, too. And if they aren't able to take charge of the herd, the argali won't obey them. It's harder than it looks! Go on and give it a try, I'll watch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Go on and try to command Taivan to herd the argali. I'll be able to tell if he has the potential for it or not.

==Completion==
Hmm... Taivan still seems confused. He just doesn't seem to be grasping this.

You did great, though! Are you in the market for a new career?

==Notes==
Speak with Taivan:
:<Taivan seems to want to interact with the argali and other bakar, but not without permission, so he fidgets while staying seated.>

:{{Gossip|Are you ready to give this a try, boy?}}

The Command Taivan to Herd [[Extra Action Button]] becomes available:
:{{Abilities|Command Taivan to Herd|Command Taivan to herd the target Argali.|range=30|id=383879|icon=ability_hunter_pet_goto|notes=2 sec cast}}

Use it on [[Aylaag Argali]] in the area:
:''Taivan runs up to a nearby argali.''
*{{Text|emote|Taivan isn't sure what to do.}}
:{{Text|emote|Taivan tries to follow your command, but fails.}}

After which, the argali responses:
*{{Text|emote|The argali ignores Taivan and continues grazing.}}
*{{Text|emote|The argali ignores Taivan and walks away.}}
*{{Text|emote|The argali looks at Taivan, snorts, and then goes back to grazing.}}

After three attempts:
:{{text|yell|Shepherd Tevatei|He doesn't seem to understand your commands, <name>. Try showing him what to do yourself!}}

The Extra Action Button changes to Herd Them Yourself!:
:{{Abilities|Herd Them Yourself!|Roar at target Argali, allowing you to chase them into the pen at the Mallakh.|id=389571|icon=warrior_disruptingshout|range=5|notes=2 sec cast}}

Use it to herd an argali to the pen by running up behind it and letting it run away from the player. Try to make sure that 'away from the player' is also 'toward the pen'.
