==Notes==
Upon becoming eligible for this quest by completing all of [[Honoring Our Ancestors]], [[Omens and Incense]], and [[Unwelcome Outsider]], [[Aru]] spawns next to the player to offer this quest.
:{{Text|say|Aru|A message from Sansok Khan!}}

On accept, he salutes, runs off, and despawns.

Talk to Sansok in the city center:
:<As Sansok Khan signs, [[Okir]] vocalizes.>

:While there are many clans among the plains, the four you have formally met hold the most power. It is vital to your peaceful stay in our lands that you know their specialities.

:It is time to test what you have learned. Do you feel prepared?

:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}

This is a simple quiz to see if the player has been paying attention while questing. Each question has the same four possible answers. The correct answer is marked with '''bold type''' below. It's not particularly punishing: if the player picks the wrong answer, Sansok will inform them and they can immediately pick another answer.
