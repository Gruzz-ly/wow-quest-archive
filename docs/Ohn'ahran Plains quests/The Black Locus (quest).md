==Objectives==
Bring the Black Locus to the [[Telemancer Aerilyn]].
*[[The Black Locus]] (provided)

==Description==
It really is quite enticing, isn't it? The Locus was too much for the [[Sundered Flame]]. However, it fits just right in my hands. Funny, that.

<[[Skyscribe Adenedal|Adenedal]] shakes his head.>

Perhaps not. Not this day. Not again. Take it from me. It is not my burden to bear.

Good bye, dear friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|10|50}}
*3,750 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
*[[Renewed Proto-Drake: Spiked Throat]]
*[[Drake Archaeologist's Shawl]]

==Progress==
Do you have something to show me?

==Completion==
This was found at the [[Nelthazan Ruins]]? Fascinating. 

Its markings are ancient, but they bear a resemblance to other artifacts we have discovered in and around the ancient machinations of [[Deathwing]].

Further study is necessary.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|say|[[Telemancer Aerilyn]]|Just how much more of Neltharion's legacy is out there to be found?}}
:{{text|say|[[Telemancer Astrandis]]|I do not believe this will be the end of it. We must be prepared when the time comes. We have work to do.}}

Completing the quest also awards the "Nelthazan Ruins" criterion of [[Sojourner of Ohn'ahran Plains]].
