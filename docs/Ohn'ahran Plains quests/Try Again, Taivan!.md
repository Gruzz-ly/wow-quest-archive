==Objectives==
Return to [[Healer Selbekh]] in [[Maruukai]] and deliver the bad news.

==Description==
Return to the [[Clan Teerai|Teerai]] and tell them that not even I can train [[Taivan]] to be a hunter. He simply does not have it in him.

He is the most un-ferocious [[bakar]] I have ever seen, and I bet he would even try to make friends with the wild game if we let him! Hah!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Taivan just returned. They could not have trained him so quickly could they? No... I suppose not.

<She sighs deeply and looks at Taivan.>

He doesn't seem to be taking it well, either. I have one more idea, and if this doesn't work, we will have to make some difficult decisions.
