==Objectives==
Kill [[Primalist Storm-Summoner]]s to close the [[Storm Corridor]] portal.
*Storm Corridor deactivated {{co|24.9|35.0|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
You fight well for one who must balance on only two legs!

It matters not how hard we fight so long as the [[Primalists]] continue to draw reinforcements. We must close that portal, the Storm Corridor!

Fight your way into the nearby cavern and slay the Primalist Storm-Summoners holding it open. I will aid you if I am able.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
All this is pointless if that portal remains open!

==Completion==
Now that we have cut off our enemy's reinforcements, the battle will enter its final stage. Great work, <name>.

==Notes==
Head to the cave on the northern end of the beach and kill the three [[Primalist Storm-Summoner]]s to deactivate the portal.

==Progression==
{{Bonds Renewed}}

==Patch changes==
