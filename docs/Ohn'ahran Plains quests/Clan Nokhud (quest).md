'''Clan Nokhud''' is one of the three opening quests for the "Maruukai" chapter of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]]. The other two are [[Clan Ohn'ir (quest)]] and [[Clan Teerai (quest)]].

==Objectives==
Accompany [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]] to [[Guard Bahir]].

==Description==
<As Sansok Khan signs, [[Okir]] vocalizes for her.>

[[Clan Nokhud]] is the newest to rise to power. Their late [[khan]], [[Jhakan Khan|Jhakan]], raised a mighty army to seize territory from [[Clan Toghus|their predecessors]]. Such is the way of our people.

While Jhakan had earned his respect, his son has not. [[Balakar Khan|Balakar]] killed his father and took control of the clan. They have grown ever more insular since. But to know the [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]], you must know them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have the great unpleasantness of introducing you to Bahir, one of Balakar Khan's thugs.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Okir|Clan Nokhud can be quite... aggressive. Tomul, accompany our friend to make their introductions.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Yes, my khan.}}
:''Tomul runs toward the Nokhud encampment.''
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|First I get stuck being your keeper, and now I have to introduce you to the Nokhud? You're testing my limits, two-foot.}}
:''She walks up to Guard Bahir at the encampment entrance.''
:{{Text|say|Guard Bahir|Go play with your [[Ohuna|birds]], [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]].}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|I am not here by choice. We should just get this over with.}}

On completion, Tomul walks back to the Shikaar rise.
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Time for me to depart. Enjoy your time with these thugs, <name>.}}
