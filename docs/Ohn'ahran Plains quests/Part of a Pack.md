==Objectives==
Hunt the Ravenous Drake with [[Taivan]] and the pack of hunting [[bakar]].
*[[Ravenous Proto-Drake]] slain

==Description==
Perhaps your bakar needs to be shown the proper way to hunt by his own kind.

You may borrow some of our trained bakar. Take them and bring down the drake that circles the area.

Let us see how [[Taivan]] behaves in a pack!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Have you brought down that drake yet? My bakar should be more than enough for your quarry.

==Completion==
<Jadar shakes his head.>

Very disappointing. I'm afraid Taivan just does not have it in him to hunt like a [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]]. Even with other bakar fighting beside him, he could not shake his unwillingness to attack his enemy.

What a waste!

==Notes==
Upon accept, Jadar calls several [[Hunting Bakar]] that join the adventurer and Taivan. Attack the proto-drake, but Taivan is Cowering in Fear:
