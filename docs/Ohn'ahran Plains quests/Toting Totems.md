==Objectives==
Gather 8 Bundles of Totems from the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] at [[Ridgewater Retreat]].
*[[Bundle of Totems]] (8)

==Description==
[[Boku]] asked why I sent a message calling all mystics to Ridgewater Retreat.

I sent no such message. [[Balakar Khan|Balakar]] purposefully drew my mystics into a trap to cripple [[Clan Ohn'ir]].

But there may be a second reason. The Nokhud are gathering mystic totems, as many as they can find. These totems are blessed by [[Ohn'ahra]].

The Nokhud motives in this are unclear, but we cannot allow them to take Ohn'ahra's gifts. Recover as many totems as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The totems are infused with Ohn'ahra's wind magic.

Yet the Nokhud have abandoned her teachings. What are they up to?

==Completion==
So many totems. So many fallen mystics.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both Toting Totems and [[Taken By Storm]]:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|My khan, I have failed as a mystic. I cannot commune with Ohn'ahra, and the Khanam Matra needs her help.}}
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|We cannot hear the Windmother's song either. The storm has cast a cloud over her.}}
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|It is not your fault, Boku.}}

The totems drop from [[Nokhud Marauder]]s and [[Nokhud Mystic-Hunter]]s around Ridgewater Retreat.

Upon returning after completing both quests' objectives:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|I am unworthy of this task. Should it not fall to you?}}
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|I must rally Clan Ohn'ir. You, Boku, must find Ohn'ahra.}}

==Progression==
{{Ohn'ahra's Blessing}}
