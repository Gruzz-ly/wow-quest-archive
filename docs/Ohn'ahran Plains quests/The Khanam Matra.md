==Objectives==
Report to [[Khansguard Akato]] to join [[Gemisath]]'s audience with [[Khanam Matra Sarest|the Khanam Matra]].
*Speak to Khansguard Akato{{Co|60.29|37.89|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
I cannot linger in [[centaur]] lands; I must return to [[Emerald Gardens|the gardens]] as soon as I am able.

The Khanam Matra has agreed to hear our plea for aid. She awaits my arrival at the top of the [[krutal]], the central building of [[Maruukai]].

Though I must speak with her on my own at first, you are more than welcome to join us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|10|50}}
*4,700 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The Khanam Matra is waiting for you.

==Completion==
That traitorous fool.

<Akato spits on the ground.>

==Notes==
On accept, Gemisath heads up the hill and despawns.
:{{Text|say|Gemisath|I must speak with the Khanam Matra. I implore you to join us when you are able.}}

Akato waits at the top of the krutal, outside the entrance to [[Khanam Matra Sarest]]'s chamber. Gemisath, [[Tigari Khan]], [[Sansok Khan]], [[Okir]], and [[Basran]] are already inside. Speak to Akato:
:State your business with the Khanam Matra.

:{{Gossip|I'm ready for my audience.}}

A cutscene begins.
{{#ev:youtube|lZQ0HVXLzfA}}
:''Gemisath, the khans, and the player character stand gathered around the table.''
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|The [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]], too, have been plagued by these [[Primalists]].}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|If [[Ohn'ahra]] wills it, I will blow the [[Horn of Drusahl]] on the morrow to signal our accord with the [[green dragonflight]].}}
:''Meanwhile, outside, [[Balakar Khan]] leads row upon row of [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] warriors up the path to the krutal.''
:{{Text|say|Gemisath|[[Merithra of the Dream|Merithra]], daughter of [[Ysera]], is grateful for your...}}
:''Balakar walks into the chamber with [[Koroleth]] in tow.''
:{{Text|say|Balakar Khan|Grateful? Ha! Dragons only respect dragons.}}
:{{Text|say|Balakar Khan|No Maruuk blood will be spilled for them.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|You are not the Khanam Matra, Balakar.}}
:{{Text|say|Balakar Khan|A true leader would never surrender this land to outsiders.}}
:{{Text|say|Balakar Khan|You desecrate the memory of [[Maruuk|Maruuk Thousandbones]], Sarest.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Stand down!}}
:{{Text|say|Balakar Khan|No. These plains belong to the Maruuk.}}
:{{Text|say|Balakar Khan|And Maruukai belongs to the Nokhud!}}
:''Balakar summons a storm cloud above the krutal. A single lightning bolt strikes Gemisath, killing her. The player character stares first at her body, then at Balakar, who is brimming with storm magic and looks into the camera as more Nokhud warriors march into the chamber.''

On the other side of the cutscene, Sarest, Akato, and the khans have gathered on the platform outside the chamber to look down on Maruukai, which has been engulfed in chaos. Most of the normal NPCs have disappeared; instead, [[Khansguard Warrior]]s, [[Shikaar Hunter]]s, [[Shikaar Huntdog]]s, and [[Ohn'ir Windsage]]s are battling [[Nokhud Betrayer]]s, [[Nokhud Reaver|Reavers]], and [[Nokhud Storm Adept|Storm Adepts]]. Two exceptions are [[Qariin Dotur]], who is defending herself with a spear, and [[Healer Selbekh]], who is protecting a trembling [[Taivan]]. The Shikaar, Ohn'ir, and Nokhud districts are unaffected.
