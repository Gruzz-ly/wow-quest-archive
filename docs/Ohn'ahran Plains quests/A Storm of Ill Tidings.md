'''A Storm of Ill Tidings''' concludes the "Ohn'ahra's Blessing" chapter of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]].

==Objectives==
Deliver your report to [[Khanam Matra Sarest|the Khanam Matra]] in [[Maruukai]].
*Speak to the Khanam Matra at Maruukai{{Co|60|37.48|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
<name>, we need to tell the Khanam Matra everything that's happened, including the capture of [[Ohn'ahra]].

You must go to Maruukai as quickly as you can. You'll have to go alone. I was hurt in the fall, and I'd just slow you down.

Don't worry about me. I'll catch up later. Go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ohn'ahra's Carving]]
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well? Speak.

==Completion==
This is dire news, <name>, but we cannot lose focus. We are bruised but not beaten.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Quickly, <name>, you must tell the Khanam Matra all that has happened.}}

If the player speaks to Boku again:
:Do not worry about me. I just need to rest here for a little while...

Upon returning to Sarest's chamber atop the [[krutal]] (where [[Tigari Khan|Tigari]] and [[Sansok Khan|Sansok]], [[Okir]], and [[Basran]] are waiting like before):
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Welcome back to Maruukai. What news?}}

Speak to Sarest:
:Have you rallied my forces? Have the mystics called upon Ohn'ahra?

:{{Gossip|The [[Primalists]] have captured Ohn'ahra and have allied with [[Clan Nokhud]].}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Even outnumbered and without Ohn'ahra, we will fight on. We cannot surrender to [[Balakar Khan|Balakar]], and we will not bow to his Primalist masters.}}

Completing the quest also awards the "Ohn'ahra's Blessing" criterion of [[Ohn'a'Roll]].
