==Objectives==
Meet [[Khanam Matra Sarest|the Khanam Matra]] at [[Watering Hole (Ohn'ahran Plains)|the watering hole]].
*Green dragons found{{Co|72.4|50.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Speak to the Khanam Matra{{Co|72.53|50.33|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Listen to the discussion

==Description==
Those dragons went down over the plains to the west. We must get to them quickly before the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] do.

We would not want them to think of all [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]] as their enemies because of [[Balakar Khan|Balakar]]'s actions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The dragons need our help, outsider. We should hurry!

==Completion==
Our ancestors said the [[green dragon]]s were tempered and wise. We are fortunate they restrained their anger long enough to hear our side of the story.

Now that we know the [[Primalists]] and Nokhud are our common enemy, it is time to take them down.

==Notes==
[[File:Green Dragon Down start.jpg|thumb|Tomul and Sarest]]
On accept, [[Scout Tomul]] comes running from around the north side of the hill.
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Khanam Matra! <Name>!}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Was that the Horn of Drusahl? It was loud enough to wake the dead!}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Yes, [[Koroleth]] forced [[Ohn'ahra]] to bless Balakar. He blew the horn to lure the dragons into a trap.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Tomul, return to [[Maruukai]] and inform the khans.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Rally our forces, and begin the march towards the [[Emerald Gardens]].}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|It is time to prove our allegiance to the dragons, or both of our people will perish.}}
:''Tomul salutes.''
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|At once, Khanam Matra!}}
:''She runs back the way she came.''
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|The winds have abated. You can reach the dragons quickly by [[Dragonriding|riding your drake]] from a high point nearby.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|I will meet you there. Go with haste!}}

Head south to the [[Watering Hole (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Watering Hole]], where Sarest waits in front of [[Merithra]], [[Gerithus]], and the impaled corpse of [[Solethus]]. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Gerithus|Solethus! He's... gone.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|We cannot lose any more....}}

Gerithus' gossip text:
:We came to answer the Horn of Drusahl, and now Solethus is slain. What is the meaning of this betrayal?

Talk to Sarest:
:By Ohn'ahra's winds! <Name>, I had heard the stories about the ancient dragons, but to see them up close... They are truly magnificent creatures.

:But first, we must untangle this mess Balakar has put us in. We must make it clear that we wish to aid the dragons.

:{{Gossip|Let's explain ourselves.}}

:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Merithra, we mean you no harm. The death of your brethren saddens our hearts as much as the death of our own kind.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Balakar did this! Balakar and his clan, the Nokhud! They have shown their weakness and their cowardice by working with the Primalists.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|We hoped to resolve our civil war, but now I see there is only one path forward: we must vanquish them.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Three clans stand with you, daughter of the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]]. [[Clan Teerai|Teerai]]. [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]]. [[Clan Ohn'ir|Ohn'ir]]. We must join you to repel the warmongers from our land.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|I accept your offer to stand with us, Khanam Matra.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|My kin's sacrifice will not be forgotten. We fight together.}}

After turning in to Sarest, she has new gossip text:
:Merithra has accepted our offer of peace. I hope her faith in us does not waver. Regardless, I will do everything I can to prove our word can be trusted.
