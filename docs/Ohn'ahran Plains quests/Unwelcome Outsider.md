==Objectives==
Defeat 6 Nokhud centaur.
*[[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] [[centaur]] defeated (6)
*Return to [[Scout Tomul]].

==Description==
Hah! Look at you. Weak. Just like those [[Clan Shikaar|puny hunters]] that brought you here.

You want to know the Nokhud? We speak through battle.

Our battle ritual is called "the [[tabarr]]." We train. We spar. And it hardens us. Now there is no weakness in our clan.

Enough talk. Go spar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Bahir gets under my skin even more than you do.

==Completion==
The Nokhud prefer brute strength and power over all else.

We do not see eye to eye on many things.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Guard Bahir|Go. Prove you're not as weak as you look.}}

[[File:Unwelcome Outsider.jpg|thumb|Balakar about to kill Garuman while Koroleth watches]]
When the player enters the Nokhud encampment, an event plays out between [[Balakar Khan]] and [[Koroleth]], who are standing above the central pit, and [[Windsage Garuman]].
:{{Text|say|Windsage Garuman|You dare bring that outsider here. You insult [[Ohn'ahra]], Balakar Khan! Step away from this path!}}
:{{Text|say|Balakar Khan|The Nokhud deserve the power of the storm! We will show the [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]] how far they have fallen.}}
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|My khan, this interloper has no place amongst your Nokhud. We must cleanse ourselves of any weakness.}}
:''Balakar summons a burst of storm magic to knock Garuman off the ledge, killing him.''
:{{Text|say|Balakar Khan|Let the storm envelop you, windsage.}}

Garuman's body remains where he fell. The player can optionally interact with him to take his talisman, unlocking new dialogue with [[Tigari Khan]] and [[Windsage Contan]] in the [[Clan Ohn'ir|Ohn'ir]] area.

Neutral [[Nokhud Brute]]s, [[Nokhud Fighter]]s, and [[Nokhud Spearthrower]]s are located throughout the camp. Talk to them (or skip the talking and attack directly):
:Speak, outsider.

:{{Gossip|Let's spar.}}

On aggro:
*{{Text|say|Go back to playing with your [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]].}}
*{{Text|say|Hah! The little outsider wants to play.}}
*{{Text|say|You don't belong here.}}
*{{Text|say|I won't even break a sweat.}}
*{{Text|say|Go back to playing with your Shikaar.}}

They drop out of combat when damaged to around 33% health:
*{{Text|say|Hmph. You're lucky I have to hold back.}}
*{{Text|say|I'm done with this useless fight.}}
*{{Text|say|You are not worthy. I have better things to do.}}
*{{Text|say|You'd be trampled under my hooves in a real battle.}}
*{{Text|say|You're wasting my time.}}

At the turn-in area, there are a few side quests: [[Trouble In The Pines]] from [[Beastmaster Tirren]], [[The Fields of Ferocity]] from the [[Fields of Ferocity]] wanted poster, and [[Bloodlines, Sweets, and Teerai]] from [[Hunter Narman]].
