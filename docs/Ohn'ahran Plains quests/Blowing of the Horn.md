==Objectives==
Witness [[Balakar Khan|Balakar]] and [[Koroleth]]'s plans.
*Talk to [[Khanam Matra Sarest]]{{Co|76.7|40.93|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
Why would they have brought [[Ohn'ahra]] here? Unless...

<Name>! I do not think Balakar intends to destroy [[Horn of Drusahl|the Horn]]. I think this is a trap! We must find a way past this wind, quickly!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
No, Balakar!

==Completion==
I will not rest until Balakar answers for the crimes he committed here today. The slaughter of [[Clan Teerai|my people]], the [[blasphemy]] against Ohn'ahra, the treachery against our [[Green dragonflight|ancient ally]]...

Vengeance will have to wait. There are more pressing matters. We must help the green dragons.

==Notes==
Talk to Sarest again:
:We must find a way to push through this wall of wind! Quickly, before they can blow the horn!

:{{Gossip|I am ready!}}

A cutscene plays.

:''Koroleth drains storm magic from the incapacitated Ohn'ahra before channeling it into Balakar, who takes a deep breath and blows the Horn of Drusahl. As Balakar keeps blowing, Koroleth walks out onto the cliff. Far away in the [[Emerald Gardens]], three dragons—[[Merithra]], [[Gerithus]], and [[Solethus]]—take to the sky. Balakar walks up next to Koroleth as the dragons come into view, flying toward the Horn from the west.''
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|Almost there...}}
:''Koroleth raises her arm, then moves it in a signal to a centaur operating the [[Dragonkiller ballista|Dragon-Killer Weapon]] on the ground below.''
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|Now!}}
:''The weapon fires a huge bolt at Merithra.''
:{{Text|say|Gerithus|Mother!}}
:''Just before the bolt hits Merithra, Gerithus and Solethus fly in front of her. The bolt impales Solethus, who plummets to the [[Watering Hole (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Watering Hole]] in the south. Merithra and Gerithus immediately fly after him.''
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|Let the winds carry us onward! The [[Emerald Gardens]] will fall!}}
:''Ohn'ahra flies past Koroleth and Balakar, teleporting them away in a gust of wind magic mixed with storm magic.''
