==Objectives==
Free 6 Children of Ohn'ahra and eliminate 6 Primalists at [[Windsong Rise]].
*[[Child of Ohn'ahra (Windsong Rise)|Child of Ohn'ahra]] freed (6)
*[[Primalists]] slain (6)

==Description==
We've discovered why the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] want mystic totems. They can be used to capture the Children of Ohn'ahra. Though the Nokhud have stolen the totems, the Primalists are the ones behind this blasphemy.

The Children of Ohn'ahra are sacred [[ohuna]], blessed by the [[Ohn'ahra|Windmother]] herself. Please, <name>, free any ohuna you see! And if you come across any Primalists...

<Boku trails off, but his expression is one of grim determination.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The Children of Ohn'ahra bear the spirits of the honored dead to the beyond.

==Completion==
After all Ohn'ahra has done for us, we must do all we can to help her children. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Upon accepting all of Eagle-itarian, [[Weather Control]], and [[Fowl Sorcery]], Boku runs off and despawns:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Something is at the top of the rise. I will take a side route. Meet me up there!}}

Interact with [[Ohuna Binding Totem]]s to destroy them and free captive Children of Ohn'ahra. [[Primalist Instructor]]s, [[Primalist Stormsmith]]s, and the bonus objective [[Prozela Galeshot]] all count for the Primalists objective.

After finishing all the objectives, find Boku on the top of the rise, near where [[Koroleth]] is holding Ohn'ahra captive. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|How is this possible? They have captured Ohn'ahra herself!}}

==Progression==
{{Ohn'ahra's Blessing}}
