*{{cost|28|9|}}

==Progress==
Everyone is curious about [[Lizi]], but the truth is, she sticks out like a sore hoof. Lizi herself is starting to wander more and more, as if she's looking for something.

She mostly rests by the water on the mud. I'm sure it's fine, but I know thunderspines like to make a bedding from grasses.

I've got an idea better than grasses. Will you help me gather wool from [[Ohn'ahran Plains|the plains]]? I'll weave her a blanket and some toys.

==Completion==
Perfect! This will do! I've not met an animal that doesn't like soft things.

==Notes==
;Upon completion

:{{Text|say|Initiate Radiya|Kothani, I'm making a few things from this wool... do you have extra thread and buttons? Some dye?}}
:''Lizi runs away!''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Radiya|Lizi! Where are you going?}}
:''Radiya runs after her.''
:{{Text|say|Kothani|Hm... there she goes.}}
