==Objectives==
Deactivate Barrier Moorings in [[Ancient Bough]].
*Deactivate [[Barrier Mooring]]s (6)

==Description==
There must be a way to lower the barrier from within this grove. I sense several points around us that strengthen it.

If you can deactivate enough of those, we should be able to lower it the rest of the way so the others may join us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the barrier moorings?

==Completion==
That should do it. The barrier is about to come down.

Soon the others will be able to join us in the [[Emerald Dream]], and we can fight together again.

==Notes==
Barrier Moorings are all over the quest area.

==Progression==
{{The Dreamer}}
