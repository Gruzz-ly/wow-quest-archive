==Objectives==
Meet [[Merithra]] and [[Rymek]] at the [[Leafy Repose]] in the [[Emerald Gardens]].

==Description==
Rymek was sent here by the [[blue dragonflight|blue flight]] to learn about and protect our gardens. 

I am glad for their support. We are few in number, and our losses have been great. The blue dragonflight commands powerful magic, so we can learn a great deal from each other.

Come. Let us demonstrate the [[green dragonflight]]'s important role here in the [[Dragon Isles]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is so peaceful here.

This is [[Somnikus]]'s favorite place to rest, but... he has been morose since [[Solethus|his son]] was killed in the [[centaur]] attacks. 

But we shall focus on the present. Let us show Rymek our purpose here in the groves.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Rymek|I look forward to seeing the wonders of these groves.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|The Emerald Gardens are a place of beauty and rest. Meet us down at the Repose, <name>.}}
