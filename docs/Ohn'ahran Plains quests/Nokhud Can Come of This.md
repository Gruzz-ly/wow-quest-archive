==Objectives==
[[File:Warmonger Kharad.jpg|thumb|Warmonger Kharad]]
Enter the village with [[Khanam Matra Sarest]] and reclaim it from the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]].
*Retake the village from the Nokhud (100%)
*[[Warmonger Kharad]] slain{{Co|76.14|40.88|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
For thousands of years, the [[Clan Teerai|Teerai]] have guarded the [[Horn of Drusahl]], our most sacred relic. By sacking this village, [[Balakar Khan|Balakar]] has betrayed everything it means to be [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]]. There can be no redemption for him now.

We must retake the Horn before Balakar can destroy it and rescue any Teerai who yet live. I am going with you to personally bring that false [[Khan]] to justice. The Nokhud will know the wrath of the Khanam Matra!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Teerai Watcher Spaulders|c1={{ClassIcon|Demon hunter}}{{ClassIcon|Druid}}{{ClassIcon|Monk}}{{ClassIcon|Rogue}}
|Nokhud Reaver Shoulderguards
|Ohn'ir Initiate Mantle
|Shikaar Scout Pauldrons
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
There is no time to lose! We must re-take the village and defend the Horn of Drusahl!

==Completion==
What are they doing to [[Ohn'ahra]]? Balakar and [[Koroleth]] will pay dearly for this!

==Notes==
[[File:Nokhud Can Come of This - Balakar.jpg|thumb|Balakar preparing to blow the Horn]]
On accept, Sarest starts accompanying the player. [[Khansguard Akato|Akato]], [[Khansguard Hojin|Hojin]], [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]], and [[Khansguard Jebotai|Jebotai]] stay behind.

:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Stay and defend this position as we advance. This is nowhere near the full forces of Clan Nokhud.}}
:{{Text|say|Khansguard Jebotai|As you command, Khanam Matra.}}

Interact with [[Teerai Survivor]]s to bandage them and kill Nokhud ([[Nokhud Raider]]s, [[Nokhud Scavenger|Scavengers]], and [[Nokhud Stormlasher|Stormlashers]]) and [[Primalists|Primalist]] mobs ([[Primalist Stormfury|Primalist Stormfuries]] and [[Primalist Tempest|Tempests]]) to fill up the bar. Upon reaching 100%:
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|We have saved who we can. We must get through Balakar's lieutenant, Kharad, to reach the Horn.}}
:{{Text|yell|Warmonger Kharad|Come and try it, little Khanam Matra! The Primalists have made me strong!}}

Defeating Kharad
:{{Text|say|Warmonger Kharad|How... the Nokhud... are supreme...}}
[[File:Nokhud Can Come of This end.jpg|thumb|Sarest on the path to the Horn]]
Kharad guards the path to the top of the hill. A field of ceaseless wind covers the top of the hill, pushing the player away if they try to get too close. Atop the hill, Balakar Khan stands in front of the mouthpiece of the Horn itself, while [[Koroleth]] is holding Ohn'ahra captive with lightning nearby.
:{{Abilities|Lightning Prison|id=244044|Imprisoned in a sphere of lightning.|icon=ability_vehicle_electrocharge}}

Upon killing Kharad, Sarest runs further up the path but stops in front of the wall of wind.
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Good riddance. Wait, what is that up ahead?}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|It is Ohn'ahra!}}
