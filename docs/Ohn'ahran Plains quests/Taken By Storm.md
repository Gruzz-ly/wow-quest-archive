==Objectives==
[[File:Shela the Windbinder.jpg|thumb|Shela the Windbinder]]
Rescue [[Altan]] and search for clues about the outsider.
*Altan freed{{Co|48.9|69|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Ridgewater Retreat Orders]]{{Co|48.9|69|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
According to reports, the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] were accompanied by an outsider wielding never-before-seen magic. This outsider tore through our ranks like a tempest.

If the Nokhud have allies who can wreak this much havoc, we must find out as much as we can about them.

I have sent my [[ohuna]], Altan, to find this outsider. She has not flown back, and I am concerned. <name>, can you search for clues about this outsider and see what has become of Altan?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Teerai Watcher Gloves
|Nokhud Reaver Crushers
|Ohn'ir Initiate Gloves
|Shikaar Scout Grips
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|52|42}}
*11,700 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
I have my suspicions about the identity of these new Nokhud allies, but I must be sure.

==Completion==
So, we are at war with both the Nokhud and the [[Primalists]]. Now it is even more critical that we get Ohn'ahra and [[green dragonflight|the dragons]] on our side.

Thank you for your assistance, <name>, and thank you for saving Altan.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both Taken By Storm and [[Toting Totems]]:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|My khan, I have failed as a mystic. I cannot commune with Ohn'ahra, and the Khanam Matra needs her help.}}
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|We cannot hear the Windmother's song either. The storm has cast a cloud over her.}}
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|It is not your fault, Boku.}}

Altan is held captive by [[Shela the Windbinder]] on an islet south of Ridgewater Retreat. Kill Shela to free Altan and loot the [[Ridgewater Retreat Orders]] from her body.

On engaging Shela:
:{{Text|say|Shela the Windbinder|The wind will bow to the storm!}}
On defeating Shela:
:{{Text|say|Shela the Windbinder|You cannot... save her...}}

Upon returning, Altan is now perched on her usual spot on Tigari's arm. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|I am unworthy of this task. Should it not fall to you?}}
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|I must rally Clan Ohn'ir. You, Boku, must find Ohn'ahra.}}

==Progression==
{{Ohn'ahra's Blessing}}
