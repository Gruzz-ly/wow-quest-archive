==Objectives==
Collect 2 Perfectly Tender Turtle Meat, 6 Reptilian Eggshells, and 15 Sourbloom.
*[[Perfectly Tender Turtle Meat]] (2)
*[[Reptilian Eggshell]] (6)
*[[Sourbloom]] (15)
*Give ingredients to [[Felina Starrunner]]

==Description==
My sister's idea is charming, but [[Theramus]] needs a real pick-me-up.

That would be a generous serving of sourbloom. We can make it into a paste to slather onto his favorite food: [[turtle]] meat!

Will you help me collect the ingredients?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Do you know why sourbloom grow under the coastal trees?

The tree roots trap an abundance of nutrients from the waves, which then feed the sourbloom. This gives them incredible nutritious value.

==Completion==
The meat to sourbloom ratio is just right.
