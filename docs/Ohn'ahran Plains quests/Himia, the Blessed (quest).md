==Description==
The Elements lay claim to this land and do not welcome our intrusion.

O, Elements, have you forgotten our protector--Air! Invisible, yet omnipresent and vital for all existence! Forgotten, as easy as you breathe it. After facing me, you will never forget again.

You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Blessed by the wind, Himia ensured the centaur's acceptance by the rest of the plains' elementals.

==Completion==
So you have witnessed Himia, the Blessed.

==Notes==
Speak to Himia again:
:Are you ready to face the elements?

:''Himia starts channeling.''
:{{Text|say|Himia, The Blessed|Fire, burning bright and indiscriminate, your hunger never satisfied!}}

Three [[Primal Fire Elemental (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Primal Fire Elementals]] spawn. Kill them:
:{{Text|say|Himia, The Blessed|Water, jealously watching over all that you've given life to!}}

A [[Water Fury]] and six [[Elementary Drop]]s spawn. Kill them:
:{{Text|say|Himia, The Blessed|Earth, the plains itself, you will not yield your land freely.}}

An [[Earth Elemental (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Earth Elemental]] spawns. Kill it to complete the objective, then return to [[Elder Nazuun]]. Before leaving, Himia has new gossip text:
:O' Elements of the Plains, you shall accept the centaur. We are blessed by Wind, your kin.

:Young one, return to the Elder who gave you the knowledge to witness me, Himia, the Blessed.
