==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Rymek Primalist.jpg|Rymek|He tricked his way into [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]]. Now it's time for him to leave.}}
Defeat Rymek.
*[[Rymek]] defeated {{co|20.1|81.3|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Meet [[Merithra]] at [[Lunedane]].

==Description==
<[[Somnikus]] struggles to breathe as he slowly freezes.>

I managed... to stop him from reaching the tree. I hope it was enough.

Rymek must fall, now. It is up to you.

Tell [[Ysera]] and Merithra that I am sorry... for being a foolish old dragon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Rymek is defeated, but there are still too many [[elemental]]s and [[Primalists]] roaming through the Dream.

I suppose... now we find out who the Dreamer really is.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''The barrier protecting Rymek falls.''
:{{text|yell|Rymek|You are too late to stop us now! Come then!}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|It is not yet your time, old friend. Open your wings once again.}}
:''Ysera channels a spell into Somnikus, who takes flight.''

Aggro him:
:{{text|yell|Rymek|The Incarnates will feast on your Dream!}}

Rymek will wind up a Glacial Whirlwind attack, which fixates on the player:
:{{text|bossemote|Rymek is targeting you with Glacial Whirlwind! Bring him into Ysera's Breath of Death!}}
:{{text|yell|Ysera|Use my breath to heal them and to weaken Rymek.}}
Ysera spawns a purple void zone. Run into it to stop the Glacial Whirlwind. When Rymek hits it, he is briefly debuffed to take +200% damage, and deal -50% damage.

At 65%:
:{{text|yell|Rymek|These Titanspawn are unworthy!}}

He'll also cast Frost Chains. Ysera will spawn a green void zone this time. Run into it to break the debuff and get some bonus healing.

At 15%:
:{{text|yell|Rymek|No, they lie to you! You cannot trust the dragons!}}

Finish him off:
:{{text|yell|Rymek|I was... so close...}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|It is done. Now we must see to healing the Dream.}}

==Progression==
{{The Dreamer}}
