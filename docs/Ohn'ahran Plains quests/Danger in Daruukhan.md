==Objectives==
Talk to the Teerai Messenger to hear [[Healer Selbekh|Selbekh]]'s urgent request.
*Talk to the [[Teerai Messenger]]

==Description==
I guess there's nothing to be done but send you and [[Taivan]] back to [[Maruukai]]. 

Wait... who is that approaching? Not another stranger with a giant [[bakar]], I hope!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I guess you should see what all the fuss is about!

==Completion==
Oh, <name>! Thank [[Ohn'ahra]] the messenger found you. We have our hands full here!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''A Teerai Messenger runs toward you.''
:{{Text|say|Teerai Messenger|<Name>!}}
:{{Text|say|Teerai Messenger|<Name>! I have urgent news from Healer Selbekh!}}

;Speaking with the messenger
:I have just come from a village in the north called [[Daruukhan]]. It has been sacked by [[Nokhud]] raiders! 

:Selbekh sent me to find you and ask for you to come right away!

:{{Gossip|I will leave for Daruukhan at once.}}
:{{Text|say|Teerai Messenger|Taivan, Selbekh has ordered you to stay put with Tevatei.}}
:{{Text|say|Teerai Messenger|She said she doesn't want him getting in the way.}}
:{{Text|emote|Taivan whimpers pathetically.}}
:{{Text|say|Shepherd Tevatei|Don't worry, boy. You'll be safe here with me until the emergency is over.}}
:{{Text|say|Shepherd Tevatei|You had best be getting on, <name>. Whatever happened at Daruukhan sounds serious. I'll send Taivan home later.}}

Tevatei also has a new gossip:
:Don't worry, I'll make sure Taivan doesn't get into trouble. You go and help those villagers!

So does the messenger:
:I must return to Maruukai and warn the others of this attack. May Ohn'ahra watch over you.
