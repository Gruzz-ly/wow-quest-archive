'''The Nokhud Offensive: The Final Ancestor''' concludes the optional "Elder Nazuun" storyline in [[Teerakai]].

==Objectives==
Defeat [[Balakar Khan (tactics)|Balakar Khan]] and collect the Medallion of the Ancestors in the [[Nokhud Offensive]].
*[[Medallion of the Ancestors (quest item)]]
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
You've proven yourself an ally to us, with genuine interest in our values and way of life. There is one more ancestor I'd like to tell you about, but it will be dangerous.

Kill the traitorous Balakar, leader of [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]], son of none. He wears a precious medallion at all times. Bring it back to me, and I will be forever in your debt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Medallion of the Ancestors]]
*{{cost|104|84|}}
*15 000 [[XP]]
*+750 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Balakar never parts with the pendant. You'll have to kill him.

==Completion==
...I thought I'd never see the day.

==Notes==
On completion, Nazuun turns around, walks into her hut, and gives a bow before sitting down on the carpet.
:{{Text|say|Elder Nazuun|We may honor this ancestor in my home.}}
:{{Text|say|Elder Nazuun|Blessed be [[Jhakan Khan|Warlord Jhakan]], First Under the Sky, the Great Unifier, the Thunder of the Plains...}}
:{{Text|say|Elder Nazuun|...and the love of my life. Ride on, Jhakan. Our child no longer stains the land.}}

Nazuun permanently remains inside the tent and gets new dialogue in which she explains her backstory.

Completing the quest also awards the "Elder Nazuun" criterion of [[Sojourner of Ohn'ahran Plains]].
