==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Jamoku.jpg|Jamoku|Jamoku was responsible for the attacks on the tauren and the death of Bovan Windtotem, among others.}}
Slay Jamoku.
*[[Jamoku]] slain {{co|33.0|38.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
<Baine is still breathing heavily from his recent battles.>

I will not leave... until Jamoku pays... for what he has done...

I will avenge [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]]... no matter the cost...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Jamoku is dead, as are many of the [[centaur]]. We have avenged Bovan and the others.

<Baine grimaces as he touches a wound on his side.>

In hindsight, perhaps we should not have taken on the entire [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] army. Luckily, Tomul's timely arrival helped even the odds.

<Baine glances at [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]].>

A centaur fighting to save a [[tauren]]... I never would have believed it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Come, <name>. Let us end this monster once and for all.}}
:''Baine runs off.''

Find [[Jamoku]] outside the main forge of [[Nokhudon Hold]] and aggro him:
:{{text|say|Jamoku|More outsiders come to meet their fate!}}
:''Baine spawns and runs in.''
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|This ends now, centaur!}}

Baine will tank. Get out of the frontal, but otherwise nuke the boss. Every now and then, Jamoku will summon a few elementals and go immune until the big one is defeated:
*{{text|say|Jamoku|The [[dragon]]s shall fall! The Nokhud shall reign supreme!}}
*{{text|say|Jamoku|I have mastered the forbidden magics! Feel the might of the storm!}}

At 30%, Jamoku stuns Baine and the player and ends the fight:
:{{text|say|Jamoku|Enough of this! I will strike you down where you stand!}}

A [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|JdLi1ZFzLOs}}
:''Jamoku, storm magic in his right hand, lands a strike on Baine, bringing the tauren to his knees. As the centaur gets ready to strike, javelins fly in and distract him. Scout Tomul and two Shikaar rangers charge in, launching more projectiles. One of them strikes true, wounding Jamoku. In retaliation, the Nokhud centaur winds up his storm magic attack but Baine swings his mace, knocking Jamoku out.
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Well struck.}}
:''He turns to look at Tomul.''
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I... did not believe you would come.}}
:''Tomul crosses her arms.''
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Honor is of great importance to my people.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Yes... as it is to mine.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Come. Let us gather our dead.}}
:''Tomul and Baine walk away from Jamoku as the scene fades to black.''

On the other side of the cutscene, Baine and the player are back at [[Bovan Windtotem]]'s corpse, and [[Scout Tomul]] has appeared.

On complete, Baine has new gossip:
:I will take Bovan back to his people. He deserves a proper funeral... and the [[Windtotem tribe|Windtotem]] deserve the opportunity to say goodbye.

Before starting the next quest, so does Tomul:
:<Tomul is somehow both expressionless and smug.> 
:What? Did you really think I would leave you to do this alone? I said I would get help and I got it. 
:After I left the Ohn'iri Springs, I went straight to Sansok Khan to rally the rangers. Few were available, but there were enough for a surgical strike into Nokhudon Hold. 
:<Tomul's expression turns grim.> 
:I lost two rangers on this rescue mission. Perhaps now Baine will know what our words are worth.
