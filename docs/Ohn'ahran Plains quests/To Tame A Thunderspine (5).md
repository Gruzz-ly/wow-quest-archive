==Objectives==
Collect Meluun's Green Curry in the [[Ohn'iri Springs]] and 150 Dragon Isles Supplies.
*[[Meluun's Green Curry]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supplies ]](150)

==Description==
I guess this is [[Lizi]]'s new favorite spot. She hasn't been interested in coming back home. After all, she is a wild beast.

I have to tell you... I haven't spoken to [[Ohn Meluun|Meluun]] since we saved Lizi. I know she was right, but I don't know how to approach her. She doesn't seem to approve of anything I do. I know I have to focus more on my training.

Meluun makes a stomping good curry that Lizi would love. Do you think you could ask her for it? She's usually working in the Ohn's house west of the springs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9|}}
**,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you talk to Meluun yet?

==Completion==
I can smell the curry from here! Oh, by the ancestors, Lizi will be so happy! I'll take this as a sign that Meluun hasn't cast me out of her good graces completely.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Ohn Meluun
:Ah, I recognize you. You visit us often.

:May the importance and beauty of the Ohn'iri Springs be impressed upon your mind.

:{{Gossip|Radiya told me about your green curry.}}
::She did, did she? Well, it's a fine curry. Perfecting it is my hobby.

::I'll guess she wants to share it with a particular beast who has a liking for fish based dishes? Well, you may bring this bowl to them.

::<Name>, I know Radiya is your friend. Remember this. She possesses strong spirit and talent, and it is my duty to train her well, even if it means being strict. Especially if it means being strict.

::Radiya left her childhood, her home, all that she knew and loved--so that she may become Ohn'ir. You must know I am infinitely proud of her.
