==Objectives==
Ride with [[Gerithus]] and [[Merithra]].
*Fly with Gerithus{{Co|72.31|50.7|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
So the [[Primalists]] have recruited [[Clan Nokhud]] as allies.

We have held off the Primalists until now, but the Nokhud have brought a new weapon: a [[dragonkiller ballista]]. I fear [[Solethus]] will not be the first dragon to fall to its foul storm magic.

Come. I will take you to the dragons' haven at [[Shady Sanctuary]]. You can tell me what you know of the Nokhud while [[Khanam Matra Sarest|the Khanam Matra]] gathers her forces. We must prepare for our next move.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We have arrived, mortal. Welcome to the [[Emerald Gardens]].

==Notes==
[[File:With the Wind At Our Backs end.jpg|thumb|Merithra and Gerithus in the Shady Sanctuary]]
Talk to Gerithus:
:My mother is kind and trusting, but I will keep my eye on you.

:We will travel west to the green dragons' grove. It is a long journey. Are you ready?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready to go.}}

Picking the dialogue option causes the player to hop up on Gerithus' back. Merithra picks up Solethus' body, bolt and everything, after which the two dragons start flying west.
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Shortly after we returned to our ancient grove to the west, the Primalists attacked.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|We destroyed them, time and again. The Primalists knew they needed the [[centaur]] on their side to defeat us.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Clan Nokhud's dragonkiller ballista is the key to their victory.}}
:{{Text|say|Gerithus|The Nokhud are relentless. With their help, [[Koroleth]]'s Primalist army has found a way to break our defenses.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|The barrier to the [[Ancient Bough]] must not fall. Within it lies our portal to the [[Emerald Dream]]. I shudder to think what they wish to do to it.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Our sanctuary lies ahead. Meet me there. We will rally the remainder of our forces.}}

The dragons land at the western edge of the [[Shady Sanctuary]] and turn into their humanoid forms, with Gerithus ejecting the player.
