==Objectives==
Mark the [[Primalist Pylon]]s with Enchanted Seeds.
*First Primalist Pylon marked{{Co|23.9|39.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Second Primalist Pylon marked{{Co|23.2|37.46|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Third Primalist Pylon marked{{Co|21.35|37.6|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
With those [[Dragonkiller ballista|vile weapons]] destroyed, the [[green dragonflight]] can join the fray in force.

We are much more familiar with the situation on the ground. We need to light up some targets, so [[Merithra]] and her dragons can strike from above.

Merithra gave me these enchanted seeds. Place them near the [[Primalists|Primalist]] pylons. We will use their light to call in attacks from airborne dragons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
I would appreciate if you did not stand so close to me with those enchanted seeds. Thank you.

==Completion==
I will remain forever grateful that the dragons were on our side during this battle.

==Notes==
The Primalist Pylons are distributed across the beach. Upon getting close to one, the player gets an extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Call Merithra|Mark this location, calling Merithra to destroy the nearby Primalist pylon.|icon=inv_herbalism_70_yserallineseed|notes=3 sec cast.}}

This causes Merithra to strafe over the area, breathing poison mist that causes the pylon to shatter. Upon marking the first pylon:
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Well done. I see the pylon!}}

Second pylon:
:{{Text|say|Merithra|There it is!}}

Third pylon:
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Good. I will take it from here.}}

==Trivia==
Like the [[Talador]] quest [[We Must Construct Additional Pylons]], this quest's name is a reference to [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-must-construct-additional-pylons the phrase] uttered when a {{StarCraft|protoss}} player in ''[[StarCraft franchise|StarCraft]]'' tries to build a unit without having sufficient supplies.

==Progression==
{{Bonds Renewed}}

==Patch changes==
