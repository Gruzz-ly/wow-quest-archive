==Objectives==
Help [[Windsage Dawa]] and [[Hunter Narman]] with their proposals.
*Speak to Hunter Narman{{Co|63.62|40.46|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Meet Narman and Dawa by the water.{{Co|46.7|60.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
There is a small pond by the [[Mirror of the Sky]] where Narman and I first met during my initiate training.

Initiates travel up there to be closer to [[Ohn'ahra]] so they may feel the wind. I first saw him in the reflection of the water when a sudden breeze opened my eyes. It is the most beautiful sight in all of the plains.

It will be the perfect place for our proposal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|52|42|}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

|Lover's Bouquet
}}

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

Dawa and I will always remember what you have done for us.

==Notes==
On accept, Dawa runs off to the south and disappears.
:{{Text|say|Windsage Dawa|Send for Narman. He will know the place.}}

Speak to Narman on the [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]] rise:
:You have great timing, <name>.

:As per tradition, I have received the blessing of both families. I am ready to proceed.

:There is a small pond by [[Teerakai]] where Dawa and I used to meet. Send him there and I will be waiting.

:{{Gossip|Dawa is already headed towards the pond.}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter Narman|Already? Then I must hurry! Meet us there when you are able.}}

Narman runs off and disappears as well. When the player arrives at the pond, the lovers come running from different directions and stop in front of each other.
:{{Text|say|Hunter Narman|Dawa! I must ask-}}
:{{Text|say|Windsage Dawa|Narman! I've brought you here to ask-}}
:{{Text|emote|Dawa pauses for a moment in confusion and then laughs.}}
:{{Text|emote|Narman erupts in laughter.}}
:{{Text|say|Windsage Dawa|Did we just?}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter Narman|We did. Want to get married?}}
:{{Text|say|Windsage Dawa|More than anything. I love you.}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter Narman|And I, you. More than anything.}}
:''They walk closer to stand side by side.''

Upon turning in to Narman, the two start walking back to [[Maruukai]] in tandem.
:{{Text|say|Windsage Dawa|Come, Narman. We have much to plan.}}
:''They start running.''
:{{Text|say|Hunter Narman|Yes! We must tell our clans!}}

==Progression==
{{Dawa and Narman}}

==Trivia==
*In the Russian version of the game, the quest plotline was rewritten from a same-sex proposal to a sworn brotherhood proposal due to legal circumstances (to avoid a possible ban due to Russia's harsh anti-LGBT laws in media).

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
