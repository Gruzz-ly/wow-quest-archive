==Objectives==
Rescue the innocent creatures from the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] at [[Ridgewater Retreat]].
*[[Raidu the Rabbit (item)]] rescued
*[[Taichek the Timbertooth (item)]] rescued
*[[Dumen the Duckling (item)]] rescued
*[[Ongke the Ottuk (item)]] rescued

==Description==
Please don't hurt me...

What? You're here to help? You must save the animals!

The Nokhud attacked without warning. We all fled for our lives! I barely escaped death by diving into the lake.

The animals! We left them behind. Please, I beg you, rescue the creatures. Who knows what cruelty the Nokhud have in store for them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Rock of Appreciation]]

==Progress==
As initiates, we practice our healing arts by rehabilitating wounded creatures. 

Four creatures were under our care. However many you can rescue will be a relief.

==Completion==
You saved them! They're a bit worse for wear, but they're alive and will recover.

Thank you stranger. Please take this, as a token of our everlasting gratitude.
