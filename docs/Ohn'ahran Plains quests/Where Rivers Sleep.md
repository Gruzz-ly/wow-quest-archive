==Objectives==
Collect reagents from [[Mirewood Fen]].
*[[Fragrant Bloom]] (8)
*[[Mudfin Pouch]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Mirewood Fen|Mirewood]] contains key reagents often used to converse with the ancestors. Unfortunately, the [[Mudfin tribe]] swarms the area, making it difficult for us to forage the area.

If you could gather some of the blooms within the marsh, along with some of the Mudfin's own resources, I would appreciate it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
Have you found everything?

==Completion==
I thank you. These will be put to good use.
