==Objectives==
Kill [[Nokhud Desecrator]]s and [[Ukhel Gravestirrer]]s, and recover the ancestral weapons they have taken.
*Desecrating centaur slain (10)
*[[Risen Hero's Weapon]] (3)
*Meet with Zorig further in the Eternal Kurgans.

==Description==
[[Cathan the Determined|My mother]] was a hero. She deserves peace and rest, not this... enslavement! None of our heroes do.

They must pay for this. And our ancestors must rest once more with their weapons, with honor. Take the weapons back from those desecrators!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Did you get the weapons back from those graverobbers?

==Completion==
This is a good start. I can use these weapons to free their owners... I hope.

==Notes==
On accept, Zorig equips the [[Exhumed Hunter's Spear]], runs off to the west, and despawns.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|I will make my way to the other side and work out how we might release the spirits from this magic.}}

The weapons are [[Karha, the Serene Wind]], [[Josanak, the Certain Victory]], and [[Tsegzaya, the Brambled Bow]]. All three drop from the [[Nokhud Desecrator]]s and [[Ukhel Gravestirrer]]s.

Zorig waits at the northwestern edge of the kurgans.

==Progression==
{{The Eternal Kurgans}}
