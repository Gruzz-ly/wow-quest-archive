==Description==
Ah, the Ohn'ahran Plains. Wide open spaces, gusting winds, endless vistas... and more race courses!

Just as in the [[Waking Shores]], if you find any of my bronze colleagues, speak to them about their race course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 11,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Excellent flying, <name>! Your control of your [[drake]] shows how far you have come as a dragonrider.

And such speed! I trust now you know how truly freeing it is to fly like a [[dragon]]!

Now! There are more places to see and more races to run. Next stop: the [[Azure Span]]!

==Progression==
