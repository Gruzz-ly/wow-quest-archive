==Objectives==
Defeat Sherath and Taresh.
*[[Sherath]] slain
*[[Taresh]] slain
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
You know, for it being the [[Dragon Isles]], I haven't seen too many [[dragon]]s. We did get a duo of [[dragonkin]] that requested to be signed up for this competition together though.
 
They seem plenty eager to prove themselves though, so good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|52|42|}}
* 11,700 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
You need to speak with Gurgthock to start the round, then defeat the fourth competitors of the Field of Ferocity.

==Completion==
... Wuzzat? Is the fight over? I think I fell asleep in the middle of it for some reason.

I'm guessing you won if you're standing in front of me?

==Notes==
;Speaking with Gurgthock
:Are you ready to rumble?

:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|These two have climbed the ranks with a string of technical knock outs.  Because technically they have put all their challengers into a coma with the power of the [[Emerald Dream]].}}
