==Objectives==
Speak with Roska to start the dig, then excavate artifacts from the riverbed.
* Tell [[Roska Rocktooth|Roska]] to start the dig
* Finds Unearthed (2)
* Major Find Unearthed
* [[Archivist's Water Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Hope you brought your boots, 'cause this is gonna be a wet one!

This river carries artifacts down from the mountains, and they wash up here in the silt. The centaur have found loads of stuff here over the years.

We're here to take a deeper look and see if there's anything interesting below the surface.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nothing like silt, eh <name>? Never know what you'll find!

==Completion==
<Roska lets out a low whistle.>

Now that's something you don't see every day. Let's get her out of there.

==Notes==
On accept, a [[Helpful Water]] elemental appears and Roska has dialogue:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|My splashy friend here should help you navigate the marsh.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Let me know when you're ready to get digging!}}

Talking to Roska:
:{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to start digging!}}
:''Roska channels on [[Roska's Earth Totem]] to cause an earthquake.''
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Let's  give this place a little rumble and see what shakes out, eh?}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|That ought to do it. Don't get stuck in the mud!}}

Find Disturbed Earths and discovering an [[Ancient Centaur Find]]. Repeat the process from the tutorial, now with Sturdy Earth. Roska yells one of the following lines:
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Would you look at that!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That's why we're out here!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That's a big chunk of history right there!}}
*{{Text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That's one for the thesis!}}
*{{Text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|This one's gonna be a real treat, I can feel it!}}
*{{Text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Whoa! That's quite a find!}}

Upon unearthing the find, you can receive one of the following items: [[Wooden Caravan Spoke]], [[Leather Bakar-Sized Shoe]], [[Fishbone Needle]].

Upon unearthing an [[Aggravated Silt]], Roska yells one of the following lines:
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That's no find!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Whoa! Watch out!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|We dug too deep!}}
*{{Text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|We've got trouble!}}
*{{Text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Whoa! Look out!}}

Upon unearthing a rock, you get [[Just a Rock]] and Roska yells one of the following lines:
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Well, that's disappointin'}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Boo! Try again?}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Sometimes life throws rocks at ya!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Nothing to do but keep digging!}}

Find 10 [[Just a Rock]]'s gives you the [[When a Rock is Just a Rock]] achievement.

Upon harvesting the second find the ground shakes:
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Do you feel that? What could that be?}}

Unearthing the Major Find uncovers an Ancient Centaur Corpse and leads to [[The Body on the Banks]].

Once the [[Ancient Centaur Corpse]] is discovered, Roska has new gossip:
{{book|content=
{{gossip|What can you tell me about this incredible find?}}

There's no telling &#039;til we can excavate it, but I suspect we've got a bog body on our hands!

Sometimes, the bodies of folks who died long ago will be perfectly preserved when all the normal forces that decompose them can't reach &#039;em. Usually it happens in bogs, but it can happen anywhere.

If that's the case, we'll want to be extremely careful and only excavate when conditions are absolutely perfect.

This lady's been waiting a long time to return to her people. We need to take the job seriously!
