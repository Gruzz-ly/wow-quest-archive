==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sugarbough]] at the [[Shady Sanctuary]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Description==
Enjoying the greenery around our little scenery, <name>?

It reminds me of a dish I once tasted from a pair of [[dryad]] sisters and their kind [[treant]] friend. Sugarbough was their name! A resident of Shady Sanctuary on the western coast of the Plains.

It was a medley of fresh herbs, veggies, and spices. At the heart of this dish was the most delicious layer of sea kelp you have ever tasted!

What? Never tasted sea kelp before? Well you simply must seek some out. And bring back enough to share, please!

* {{cost|14|4|50}}

Do you require assistance?

:{{Text|say|[[Chef Guff]]|Tell me, Rumi, what is it about this kelp's flavor that you're after?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Rumiastrasza]]|Its flavor is formed by the heat of the [[Waking Shores]] to the north, the chill of the [[Azure Span]] to the South, and magic of the [[Green dragonflight|green flight]] to the west.}}
:{{Text|say|Chef Guff|Extraordinary! Consider me intrigued!}}
