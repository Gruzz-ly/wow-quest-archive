==Objectives==
Try to comfort the [[centaur]] orphan Chimei.
*Try to Talk to [[Chimei]]
*Try to Talk to Chimei Again
*Wait to see what [[Taivan]] does

==Description==
Do you see that young one, sitting by themselves over on the bank of the stream?

<She points to the northeast, where you see a young-looking Centaur staring at the water.>

Chimei lost both of their parents in the Nokhud attack. I have healed all of their physical wounds, but they have not eaten or said a word to anyone since we found them. They just sit and stare.

This is beyond my skills, and I am at a loss. Will you try to talk to them, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|52|42}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* [[Taivan's Trumpet]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
<Selbekh's eyes still glisten with tears.>

Taivan... So this is his true gift. 

How could I have been so blind? He is different from other [[bakar]], yes, but he has proven himself a valuable member of [[Clan Teerai]]. He will stay by my side for the rest of his days, rescuing who he can, and healing who I cannot.

Please, come and visit us anytime you'd like! We are both truly grateful for all you have done for us!

==Notes==
Speak with Chimei:

:<Chimei does not respond.>

:{{Gossip|<Try tapping Chimei on the shoulder.>}}

:{{Text|emote|Chimei is unresponsive.}}
:''Suddenly, Taivan runs toward Chimei!''
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Taivan, where are you going?}}
:''Taivan lies down next to Chimei.''

After a while...
:''Chimei starts petting Taivan as Selbekh walks up.''
:{{Text|say|Chimei|Hi there, pup. What's your name?}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|By the [[Ohn'ahra|Windmother]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|This is Taivan, and I am Selbekh. You're safe in Maruukai now.}}
:{{Text|say|Chimei|Hi Taivan. I'm Chimei.}}
:{{Text|say|Chimei|Miss Selbekh?}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Yes, Chimei?}}
:{{Text|say|Chimei|Can I have something to eat?}}
:{{Text|emote|Selbekh bursts into tears.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Of course you can, child! Of course you can.}}
