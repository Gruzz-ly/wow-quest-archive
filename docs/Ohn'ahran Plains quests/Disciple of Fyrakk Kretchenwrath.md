==Objectives==
Collect the Head of [[Kretchenwrath]].
*[[Head of Kretchenwrath]] (provided)

==Description==
<[[Fyrakk]]'s disciple has fallen. Perhaps the remains of this beast will bring some comfort to those whose land has been ravaged.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|421|35}}
*[[Maruuk Centaur Insignia]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]])

{{Rfg-section|10.2.0}}
*[[Drake's Shadowflame Crest]]

==Progress==
I heard you faced a disciple of Fyrakk.

==Completion==
So this is the beast who would swear their loyalty to such an Incarnate. Their zealotry has festered for ages upon ages of this world. 

I cannot even begin to fathom such a deep seeded hatred.

Thank you for ending this flame of wrath upon our plains.
