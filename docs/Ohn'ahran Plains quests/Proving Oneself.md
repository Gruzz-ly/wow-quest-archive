:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Even a young [[hunter]] can aid in a proto-drake hunt. Let us see what you've got, outsider.}}

The proto-dragon is in a nearby scorched clearing. A hunting party consisting of a [[Shikaar Beastmaster]], [[Loyal Bakar]], [[Shikaar Hunter]], [[Shikaar Preyseeker]], [[Shikaar Ranger]], and [[Shikaar Ohuna]] stand ready to fight it. Upon aggroing the drake, they join in and help the player defeat it.
:{{Text|say|Shikaar Beastmaster|Down the beast!}}

Upon killing it, the centaur cheer and the Shikaar Hunter salutes the player.
:{{Text|say|Shikaar Hunter|A worthy hunter indeed.}}
:{{Text|say|Shikaar Hunter|Well fought, outsider.}}
:{{Text|say|Shikaar Ranger|Looks like you've taken down a proto-dragon or two in your day.}}
