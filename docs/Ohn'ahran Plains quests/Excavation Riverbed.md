==Objectives==
Meet [[Roska Rocktooth]] at the Riverbed dig site in [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Description==
There's a Riverbed near [[Maruukai]] in Ohn'ahran Plains that's teeming with local lore about a lost [[caravan]]!

Meet me there as quick as you can! And wear your best, old, mud-ready boots!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We'll shake up the centaur world with this find!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Catch you at the site!}}

At the excavation site, Roska has new gossip:
{{book|content=
Nothing better than standing in the dirt, knowing that just beneath your feet could be a little piece of history.

{{gossip|What can you tell me about the history of this place?}}

The local [[centaur]] sometimes call this place the treasury of the river on account of how often folks find stuff in it!

I'd guess the artifacts are being washed here from upstream up in the mountains. That explains the grab-bag of finds--tools, weapons, and centaur votive statues from all eras.

Some of the richest finds have been from very early history and I'm hoping to find more of that.

The folks up at Maruukai gave the Archive the go-ahead to dig here, so let's get started!

{{gossip|What can you tell me about the geology of this place?}}

These banks collect artifacts, sure, but they also collect sediment! Lots of soft, spongy silt washes up here, burying anything that winds up on the shore.

Not only that, but the layers and layers of silt and buried plant matter, combined with the chill of the glacier water, means that these banks are anaerobic. Buried stuff won't decay like it usually does.

That means we might unearth finds that would ordinarily rot away like fabric, wood, who knows what! We could find anything!
