==Objectives==
[[File:Suffusion Crucible.jpg|thumb|Suffusion Crucible]]
Loot a Suffusion Crucible and a Suffusion Mold.
* [[Suffusion Crucible]] looted
* [[Suffusion Mold]] looted
* Forgemaster Slain

==Description==
[[File:Suffusion Mold.jpg|thumb|Suffusion Mold]]
[[Fyrakk]] has made a deal with the dragon hunting [[djaradin]]!

Their blacksmith, [[Igira]], has sent her finest crafters under the aegis of Fyrakk's [[Primalists]]. They are gathering materials for the construction of... something. 

Find a way to access their Suffusion Crucibles and Molds. Keep what you find but we must learn more about what they are doing. The forces appear to require special wards to access the Crucibles and Molds. Start there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 50x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you found in the Crucibles and Molds? 

All of this shadowflame about makes my scales crawl.

==Completion==
Shadowflame! They are suffusing every ingredient and component with shadowflame!

What are they crafting? It must be something far more dangerous than simply outfitting the army here.

Well done hero. We trust you to put those materials to better use than these beasts.

==Notes==
See the [[Fyrakk Assaults]] article for a walkthrough on getting enough [[Ward of Igira]] and [[Ward of Fyrakk]] to loot the Suffusion Crucibles and Mold.

Completing this quest is the criteria of [[Through the Ashes and Flames]].
