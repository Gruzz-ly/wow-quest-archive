==Objectives==
Collect Radiant Flecks of Ash from powerful pieces of gear throughout the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].
* [[Radiant Fleck of Ash]] (20)
* [[Ashen Dowsing Rod]] (provided)

==Description==
I've heard that in the [[Emerald Dream]], a coarse ash with strong properties of [[shadowflame]] tends to cling to powerful pieces of equipment. The only way to harvest that powerful dust is by disassembling the equipment.

Here, use this rod I've enchanted. It should allow you to siphon off the dust you need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Prototype Order Vellum]]

==Progress==
Don't give up! This process doesn't just help with crafting. It builds character! Remember that!

==Completion==
I hope the dowsing rod helped! Now for our next step...
