==Objectives==
Meet [[Merithra]] in the [[Ancient Bough]].

==Description==
Your part in this has not escaped me, mortal. It is in large part due to your bravery that we were able to defeat the [[Primalists]].

I have invited the [[centaur]] to join me under the Ancient Bough. You, along with [[Khanam Matra Sarest|the Khanam Matra]] and her people, are welcome in our home.

Follow this path through the archway across the water and into the trees beyond. I will wait for you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to the Ancient Bough. You stand before the [[Emerald Oathstone]] of the [[green dragonflight]].

==Notes==
[[File:The Isle of Emerald start.jpg|thumb|Merithra and the centaur heading to the isle]]
On accept, Merithra and [[Gerithus]] shift into their dragon forms, and all of the gathered centaur and dragons head through the barrier onto the eastern part of the isle, where they gather around the dormant Emerald Oathstone.
