==Objectives==
Slay Sirena the Fangbreaker.
*[[Sirena the Fangbreaker]] slain
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
Our next path is through [[Nokhud]] territory. Historically, we have been at a tentative peace with their clan, but times have changed.

If we do not act first, we leave ourselves open while we're vulnerable. My [[scout]]s have reported that one of their war leaders has been spotted near [[Dragonsmeet]]. Take the fight to her directly - do not let her gather the forces to assault us on the move.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 11,700 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]
*[[Maruuk Centaur Commendation]]

==Progress==
I cannot afford any mistakes. There are too many lives counting on me.

==Completion==
Thank you, this will give me some peace of mind as we prepare for our journey.

==Notes==
Sirena the Fangbreaker at the [[Horn of Drusahl]].
