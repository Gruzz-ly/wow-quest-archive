==Objectives==
Aid [[Ohn Seshteng]] in her ritual.
*Speak to Ohn Seshteng{{Co|69.9|38|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Totem placed (3)
*Ritual completed

==Description==
[[Ohn'ahra]] does not speak in language as we do. Her voice carries through the very winds. [[Clan Ohn'ir|We mystics]] are trained to feel her presence, follow her call, and interpret her messages.

I have used the materials you gathered to bind totems to this particular call. Aid me in a ritual to center her voice, then I will interpret her song.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nokhud Reaver Stompers
|Ohn'ir Initiate Slippers
|Shikaar Scout Sabatons
|Teerai Watcher Moccasins
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|13|10|50}}
* 4,700 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Ohn'ahra's voice is all around us. You just have to listen.

==Completion==
The storm is an omen of grim portent. Trouble is brewing.

==Notes==
Speak to Seshteng:
:Ohn'ahra's voice is fleeting. Are you ready to aid in the ritual?
:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Come, <name>. Help me place these totems for the ritual.}}

Three ghost Ohn'ir Totems appear nearby. Seshteng walks over to them and starts channeling wind into the space between them. Place the first totem:
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Lifeblood of a beast, ready for runes in her elegant script...}}

Second totem:
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Feathers of the waterfowl, creatures of sky and river...}}

Third totem:
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Reeds of the river, here to whistle her song...}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|The wind is your song, Mother Eagle. Show me!}}
:''Seshteng and the totems' wind channeling is interrupted by a burst of lightning. The totems disappear.''
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|A storm. We must prepare.}}
:''She walks back to her old spot.''

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|The storm is Ohn'ahra's most dire warning, an affront to her gift. We must be wary.}}

{{Into the Plains}}
