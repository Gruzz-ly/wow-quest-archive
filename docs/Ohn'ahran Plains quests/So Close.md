==Objectives==
Enter the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]] portal grove with [[Rymek]].
*Speak to Rymek in [[Ancient Bough]] {{co|19.9|49.3|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Ezralor]] slain {{co|21.4|48.7|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Merithra Arrived
*Speak to Merithra outside of the Dream portal grove.

==Description==
I must take a moment to thank you, <name>, for all your help. 

Truly, I never thought I would have a chance to admire the Dream within Ancient Bough! Not as a humble emissary! How very kind.

[[Somnikus|Lord Somnikus]] has graciously invited me to set foot inside the grove and see the portal. I would be honored if you would join me.

I will remember this moment for the rest of my life. Share it with me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I... can't believe...

This cannot be...

I failed. I trusted Rymek and [[Blue dragonflight|his dragonkin]], and they betrayed us all.

==Notes==
On accept, Rymek, Gerithus, and the two blue dragonspawn take off north along the path in the direction of the portal.

Catch up with them and speak with Rymek:
:At last. I never thought I would see this place with my own eyes.

:<A sharp grin spreads across Rymek's face, and his cold eyes gleam with anticipation.>

:{{gossip|What do you think?}}

An in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|7qtpotlVrjQ}}
:''Rymek channels a lot of frost power and transforms into a primalist! As Gerithus realizes, he knocks the adventurer back with his tail away from the portal.''
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Champion!}}
:''The guards all get ice blocked as an ice wave radiates out from Rymek and countless ice and storm elementals charge the portal.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the path is frozen shut as [[Ezralor]], the Herald of Frost, stands guard. Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Ezralor|The power in the Dream will be ours!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Ezralor|We will... find it...}}
:''Merithra and Somnikus fly in, then shift to their visage forms.''
:{{text|say|Merithra|No! They are in the Dream! And Gerithus...}}
:{{text|say|Somnikus|He... tricked me. And... and I let him in.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Merithra|I have failed to protect that which I swore to keep safe. Come. There is something you both should know.}}
