'''The Trouble with Taivan''' becomes available during the [[Chasing the Wind]] chapter of the Ohn'ahran Plains Campaign.

==Objectives==
Help [[Healer Selbekh]] prepare [[Taivan]] for training.
*Taivan brushed
*[[Pelt Bundle]] picked up
*Pelt Bundle placed
*Taivan sent to [[Hunter Jadar]]
*Meet Hunter Jadar at the [[Watering Hole]]

==Description==
Hello, friend. Welcome back to [[Maruukai]]. I am Selbekh, [[healer]] of [[Clan Teerai]].

Are you good with [[animal]]s, <name>? Perhaps the influence of a newcomer is just what I need.

Taivan here, while a very good companion, has become something of a burden on my clan. I'm afraid if we can't find a good use for him, I may have to send him away. Will you help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]] are renowned for their ability as [[hunter]]s and as [[bakar]] trainers. Hopefully they will know what to do with Taivan.

==Completion==
What brings you to the Shikaar hunting grounds, stranger?

The Teerai would like us to train your bakar as a hunter? We do not usually accept such requests from other [[clan]]s, but I will consider it. Her gift is quite generous, and a fully-trained beast of his size would be a sight to behold. I bet he could take down a bull [[mammoth]] all on his own!

Hmm... I will have to see him in action before I make my decision.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Thank you for agreeing to help, <name>. Would you mind brushing him for me?}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Taivan, stand up please.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|I am sending him to train with the Shikaar, and he needs to look his best.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Taivan has just never really been good at anything. He's huge, clumsy, and requires so much food every day.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|My kind has no use for mounts like yours, and it is the [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]] way that everyone in the clan must contribute. Even our animals.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|He has been a wonderful companion, however, so I pray to [[Ohn'ahra]] that we finally find something for him to do, or I will have to make some difficult decisions.}}
:{{Text|emote|Taivan whimpers softly.}}

;Taivan brushed
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Ah, now that he's groomed, will you bring that bundle of pelts over and place it on Taivan's back?}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|I am sending this gift to Hunter Jadar, in hopes that he accepts Taivan as a trainee.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|The Shikaar clan are renowned hunters and bakar trainers. If anyone can turn him into a real hunting dog, they can.}}

Click on the nearby Pelt Bundle and place it on Taivan.
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Ok, he's ready! Go ahead and tell him to go to Hunter Jadar, near the Watering Hole. Let's see if he obeys your commands.}}

;Speaking with Taivan
:<Taivan looks at you expectantly. His tail loudly swishes back and forth in the air.>

:{{Gossip|Go find Hunter Jadar, Taivan. I will meet you there.}}
:{{Text|say|Taivan|Aroooo!}}
:''Taivan runs away.''
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Oh! I haven't seen him this excited since he was a pup! I hope this works...}}

;Approaching Jadar
:{{Text|say|Hunter Jadar|Does he belong to you? My, what a large bakar you have, stranger.}}
