[[File:What Words Are Worth.jpg|thumb|The vision of Bovan and Jamoku]]

==Objectives==
Place the items in the incense burner and witness the vision.
*Items placed
*Vision witnessed

==Description==
Let me just grind these flowers and... there we are, all ready! 

Take these items and place them in the incense burner. Together with [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]]'s [[Tauren Necklace|necklace]], I can entreat [[Ohn'ahra]] to help us find him. 

With luck, she will give us a vision.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let us hope this works.

==Completion==
At least I have one reliable ally. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Windsage Boku|Place the items in the incense burner, <name>, then step back.}}

The Incense Burner between [[Scout Tomul]], [[Boku|Windsage Boku]], and [[Baine Bloodhoof]] lights up. Interact with it:
:{{text|say|Windsage Boku|Oh Ohn'ahra, grant us your aid! Show us where we may find Bovan Windtotem!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Bovan! He looks badly hurt... who is that [[centaur]] with him?}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|I was afraid of this. His name is [[Jamoku]]. He is a powerful [[Nokhud]], an ally of the [[Primalists]] who leads a large army.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|It means your friend is in Nokhudon Hold. This mission has now become too dangerous for just us to handle. I must speak with Sansok Khan.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|There is no time! Did you not see Bovan? We must reach him now!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|That place is the seat of Jamoku's power. We cannot rescue your friend alone against an army! It would be foolish to even try!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|We can make our way in undetected! I have a few potions that will mask our presence. We have no time to find aid--we must go now or Bovan will die!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Even with those potions, the Nokhud [[Bakar|wardogs]] will sniff us out in a second! I will not throw my life away for a lost cause!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|So this is how you aid me? By fleeing at the first opportunity? [[Tagar Bloodhoof|Tagar]] was right! Your words are worth nothing--go then, coward!}}
:{{text|emote|Tomul trembles with rage and stomps the ground.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Fine! If you truly insist on getting yourself killed, I will not stop you!}}
:''Tomul runs off.''
:{{text|say|Windsage Boku|Tomul, wait! Don't go!}}
:''Boku runs off after her.''
