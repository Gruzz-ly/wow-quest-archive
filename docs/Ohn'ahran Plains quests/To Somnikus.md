==Objectives==
Meet [[Somnikus]] with [[Rymek]] near the [[Emerald Oathstone|Oathstone]] in [[Ancient Bough]].

==Description==
Somnikus has been melancholy and agitated since the death of his son.

Though we have all endured loss, I cannot imagine what I would feel were something like that to happen to [[Gerithus]].

Go with Rymek to the isle, and see if there's anything we can do. Somnikus suspects that the [[Primalists]] are on the verge of another attack. I fear that he may do something rash.

Do not worry. Because of your help with the Emerald Oathstone, you can cross the barrier easily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to [[Ancient Bough]], young one. 

Did [[Merithra]] send you to check on me? I am far too old for her to be worrying about me.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Rymek hops on his arcane disk and flies off.''
:{{text|say|Gerithus|I think my theory will work. But a significant sacrifice is required for it to succeed. I have not found a way around it.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Well done, my son. And if it comes to that, we will be ready to pay the price.}}

At the [[Ancient Bough]], Rymek has new gossip:
:Here we stand in one of the most important places to the [[green dragonflight]]. Never did I think that I would be so close to the Emerald Dream.

==Progression==
{{Garden of Secrets}}
