==Objectives==
Fish with [[Threshrak]].
*Fished from pond (3)

==Description==
Hail, dracthyr. Few stop to say hello, let alone stay for a time. Most are in a rush to their next destination.

Would you like to fish with me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
If I could tell my younger self one thing, I'd say: try fishing.

==Completion==
Return whenever you like, young one.

==Notes==
;[[Tangled Roots]] caught
:{{Text|say|Threshrak|My line snags on roots all the time, even after years of fishing. They remind me of our own tangled origins.}}
:{{Text|say|Threshrak|We were born to fulfill someone else's ambition. Now, what do you do without the hand that raised you?}}

;[[Old Crabshell]] caught
:{{Text|say|Threshrak|We could learn from the humble crab that molted its shell to make a bigger one.}}
:{{Text|say|Threshrak|Perhaps when you are ready to move on from your past, you will find the space to grow.}}

;[[Oliveye Fry]] caught
:{{Text|say|Threshrak|Ah! A young fish. Let it be free.}}
:{{Text|say|Threshrak|Give it time to mature and explore the gardens. You might do the same, <name>, and find paths wondrous beyond imagination.}}

Enter the pond and use the Release Fish extra action button.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Threshrak|I was wondering why you decided to stay awhile with me, an old and weary drakonid stranger.}}
:{{Text|say|Threshrak|Maybe you sensed we shared something in common. Maybe you thought I'd be full of wisdom, hah!}}
:{{Text|say|Threshrak|Whatever the reason, I'm glad you did. May you find peace and purpose, young dracthyr.}}
