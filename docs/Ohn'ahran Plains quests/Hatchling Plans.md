'''Hatchling Plans''' becomes available after reaching Renown level 8 with the [[Maruuk Centaur]]. Completing this quest is required to purchase [[Hoofhelper]] from Quartermaster Huseng.

==Completion==
My friend, get this thing away from me. Trade for it. Please. They call it a "Hoofhelper" but it's really just a nuisance. Always getting in the way. Not nearly big enough to be useful yet. I want it gone.

What? No, I can't just give it to you. [[Agari Dotur|My wife]] would never forgive me.
