==Objectives==
[[File:Oh No, Ohn'ahra - rescue attempt.jpg|thumb|Boku channeling on a [[Primalist Binding Stone]]]]
Defeat enemies as [[Boku]] tries to free [[Ohn'ahra]].
*Protect Boku from enemies (100%)
*Ohn'ahra freed

==Description==
[[Koroleth|That Primalist]] is restraining Ohn'ahra, but just barely. She doesn't seem to notice us.

[[Tigari Khan]] would say, "Even the slightest breeze can topple a teetering stone." If I can disrupt her spell, even just a little, Ohn'ahra might be able to break free.

Keep the guards distracted. I have an idea.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|52|42}}
* 11,700 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Completion==
We took quite a tumble. We're lucky to be alive.

==Notes==
On accept, Boku runs up to near Ohn'ahra and one of the four Primalist Binding Stones holding her captive.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Follow me. We must free Ohn'ahra!}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|This will draw attention, so keep the guards busy!}}

He starts channeling wind magic on the Binding Stone. While Boku works, mobs will continuously spawn to attack the player: [[Agitated Essence]]s, [[Agitated Initiate]]s, [[Alerted Goliath]]s, and [[Alerted Stormsmith]]s. Kill them to fill up the progress bar and keep them off of Boku. In addition, friendly [[Child of Ohn'ahra (Windsong Rise)|Children of Ohn'ahra]] will periodically fly in and drop [[Healing Sphere (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Healing Spheres]] that the player can pick up to gain a healing effect:
:{{Abilities|The Child's Gift|id=386054|Heals the caster for 35% of their maximum health.|notes=Lasts 5 sec.|icon=inv_misc_gem_pearl_13}}

After 40 seconds, Boku dispels the first Binding Stone and moves to the second.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|The first rune is dispelled!}}

Around 40 seconds more, and he moves to the third:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Another rune down. Hold fast, Windmother!}}

Approximately 80 seconds more, and he starts to move to the fourth and last one:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|One more to go. We will succeed!}}

However, he is interrupted by a cutscene:
{{#ev:youtube|N6o9c5LxuCQ}}
:''Koroleth stops channeling on Ohn'ahra and looks down at Boku as he channels on the last Binding Stone. The player character runs up next to Boku. Koroleth floats down in front of them and lifts her hand, trapping Boku and the player in whirlwinds.''
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|Halt!}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Get away from... do not...}}
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|Is this what passes for a mystic of the [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]]?}}
:''She starts gathering storm power in her hands.''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Ohn'ahra... I am sorry.}}
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|Pathetic.}}
:''With a swing of her hand, Koroleth releases a shockwave that sends Boku and the player flying off the nearby cliff edge. The player lands on the camera rump-first and the screen cuts to black.''

[[File:Oh No, Ohn'ahra - end.jpg|thumb|Boku after the fall]]
On the other side, the player automatically wakes up and gets to their feet on a slope{{Co|61.4|62.94|Ohn'ahran Plains}} just below the cliff. Boku is kneeling, wounded, just next to them. Up on the rise, the storm has cleared and Koroleth and Ohn'ahra have left.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|You are awake! I am glad to see you are okay.}}

==Progression==
