==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Burning Flamespeaker]]s or [[Blazing Overseer]]s.
* Fyrakk's forces slain (8)

==Description==
This area is swarming with far more [[Primalists]] than I expected. [[Fyrakk]] does not generally travel with guards, so I doubt the Primalists are here to accompany him.

They seem to be trying to establish a foothold here. But why?

Perhaps whatever [[Primal Incarnates|the Incarnates]] are discussing will answer that question.

In the meantime, let us thin out the Primalists guarding this area. We cannot risk having them in full force behind us as we cross the bridge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
We will need to work quickly. We cannot risk drawing the attention of the Incarnates.

==Completion==
<[[Shandris]] looks back at the bodies of the [[druid]]s. She appears bewildered, but there is pain in her eyes.>

[[Druids of the Flame]]?

Fyrakk has conscripted them into his service?

Why would any [[night elf]] agree to this...?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|We will thin out only enough Primalists to safeguard ourselves. This is an intelligence mission, not a battle.}}

After killing four targets:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Wait-- These aren't Primalists...}}

After killing eight:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|These are druids!}}

==Progression==
{{The Coalition of Flames}}
