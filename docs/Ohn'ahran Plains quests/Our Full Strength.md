==Objectives==
Free Emerald Scaleguards and Wardens.
*Collect [[Volatile Frostfire]]
*Free [[Gerithus]] {{co|20.3|49.1|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Free [[Emerald Scaleguard]]s or [[Emerald Warden|Wardens]] (4)

==Description==
We need reinforcements, and quickly. But [[Merithra]] cannot yet join us in [[Ancient Bough|the grove]] because of the barrier. We will need to manage both from here within the Dream.

Slay these [[Primalists]] and take anything you need from them, so we can melt those ice prisons and free the grove guards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That was too cold. Close. Too close.

==Completion==
Thank you for breaking me out! I can't believe that [[Ysera]] is actually here, back in the [[Emerald Dream]]! Just like in my theory. 

I'd dearly love to ask her ten thousand questions, but I have to focus. There's still the problem of [[Rymek]].

And I saw where he was headed, too, just as he caught me in ice.

He's after something in the Dream, something powerful. I don't know what, but we have to reach him before he finds whatever it is!

==Notes==
Remember that saved [[Renewed Dream]] from [[Step Into the Life]]? Open one now to obtain a [[Volatile Frostfire]]. More [[Slumbering Dream Fragment]] also drop from [[Icebound Tarasek]], and the [[Frost Shackler]]s and [[Hydro Pugilist]]s drop frostfire directly. Use the items on frozen drakonid and dragonspawn.

Freed Scaleguards and Wardens can say one of:
*{{Text|say|It's Ysera! She's back!}}
*{{Text|say|Thank you! We have to hurry, the primalists haven't found whatever they're looking for yet.}}
*{{Text|say|The Primalists are after something in the Dream!}}
*{{Text|say|What's wrong with Ysera? Why is she different now?}}

Find Gerithus:
:{{text|yell|Gerithus|Thank you. Is that... Grandmother! It worked! You're back!}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|But you are different. What happened to you?}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Hello, grandson. We will speak of that soon. But tell me, where is the one who betrayed you?}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Rymek went to Lunedane. Why would he go there?}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|He must seek what Merithra has hidden just beyond. We must hurry.}}

Upon completing the quest, Gerithus has the following gossip:
:We must reach Rymek before he finds what my mother hid in the Dream.
