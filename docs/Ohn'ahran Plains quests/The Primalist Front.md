[[Khanam Matra Sarest|The Khanam Matra]] sent word that she and her forces have arrived in the [[Emerald Gardens]]. They've located [[Koroleth]] and her [[Primalists]]. It appears a massive enemy invasion is gathering on a beach to the north.

==Notes==
[[File:The Primalist Front - leaders.jpg|thumb|Viranikus, Merithra, and Sarest at the Storm Scar]]
While mounted on a Dragonriding mount, the player can optionally jump into the [[:Winds of the Isles]] effect behind Merithra to get a boost that helps them fly north faster.

[[Aru]] and [[Belika]] are waiting in a grove, surrounded by the corpses of [[Nokhud Skirmisher]]s. Aru's gossip text:
:The [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] chose the path of betrayal. They broken{{Sic}} our ancient vow. These are the consequences.

Talk to Belika:
:With the clans gathered as one, our vengeance is at hand.

:{{Gossip|Merithra sent me to hear your report.}}
:{{Text|say|Belika|Our report? Ha! Our report is that the rear flank is secure. You stand amidst the carnage that secured our victory.}}

[[Boku]] waits further northwest, standing on a cliff overlooking the barrier around the [[Ancient Bough]].
:Glad to see you again, <name>. Do you see the barrier surrounding the Ancient Bough? Beyond it, the green dragons defend sacred territory. I do not know what the green dragons are protecting, but whatever it is, the Primalists want it.

:{{Gossip|I'm here to hear your report.}}

A brief cutscene plays.
{{#ev:youtube|at9yqQ2nWIU}}
:''The camera pans out to give the player a better view of the barrier.''
:{{Text|say|Boku|See those stone pillars? They are part of a barrier that keeps anyone from approaching. We must protect them, or the island's defenses will fall.}}

Continue north, past an [[Emerald Warden]] and [[General Chartrue]], to a ledge overlooking the Storm Scar where [[Viranikus]], Merithra, Sarest, and some [[Shikaar Ranger]]s await. On the battlefield below, centaur and dragon forces are battling Nokhud and Primalists. [[Ohn Seshteng]] is standing on a lower outcropping, accompanied by [[Avvara]]:
:The Khanam Matra asked us for more details on enemy positions. Bond with my eagle once more to see through its eyes. Are you ready?

:{{Gossip|Sounds like a breeze. I'm ready!}}

The player sees through Avvara's eyes as the bird takes off and flies over the battlefield.
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Become the eagle!}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|The Primalists have not only enhanced the Nokhud's abilities but also joined their ranks. Look at the size of those [[Stormbound Colossus|Stormbound Colossi]]. This does not bode well for us.}}
:''Avvara flies into the cave containing the [[Storm Corridor]] portal.''
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|That portal must lead to where the Primalist reinforcements await. I wonder if slaying those summoners would disrupt it. Perhaps it would collapse.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Quickly, Avvara, return before they see you.}}

Avvara suddenly dies and falls to the ground.
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|No!}}

The player's vision gets yanked back to where they're standing next to Seshteng.
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Return to the winds, Avvara... blessed child of Ohn'ahra...}}

If the player talks to Seshteng again:
:Avvara was a noble creature. A longtime friend.

:Her sacrifice will not go to waste.

Head up the ledge and talk to Merithra:
:The battle has begun. Whatever happens, we must not allow the Primalists to set foot within the Ancient Bough.

:{{Gossip|Show me what you see.}}

Another cutscene plays.
{{#ev:youtube|jsnphy_lpDU}}
:''Merithra and the player walk closer to the edge of the cliff as the camera pans out and focuses on one of the [[Primalist Pylon]]s channeling storm magic into Koroleth, who is in turn mounted on a [[Stormbound Proto-Drake]] and etching storm magic into one of the barrier pillars.''
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Do you see? Those pylons empower Koroleth's destructive power. If we cannot stop her, she will destroy the pillar, and the ward that protects the Ancient Bough will fall!}}

Completing this quest unlocks [[The Storm Scar (bonus objective)]], which the player can work on during subsequent quests.
