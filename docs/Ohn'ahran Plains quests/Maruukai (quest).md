'''Maruukai''' concludes the "Into the Plains" chapter of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]].

==Objectives==
Travel into [[Maruukai]].
*Travel with the caravan (Optional)
*Arrive in Maruukai{{Co|61.45|39.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
<[[Okir]] vocalizes as Sansok Khan signs.>

Maruukai rests beside [[Ohn'ahra's Roost|a mountain]] near this grove. Our journey is almost over.

The [[Khural]] is a time of truce amongst the [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]], but [[Ohn Seshteng]]'s omen is troubling. We must stay on our guard.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Maruuk Centaur Renown|id=395358|icon=ui_majorfaction_centaur|Unlock [[Renown]] levels for the Maruuk Centaur faction.}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|62|10}}
*1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Maruukai.

==Notes==
Back on the road again, this time due west through the grove and up the hill to Maruukai. As with both times before, the player can choose to run ahead or stay with the caravan.
:{{Text|say|[[Okir]]|Maruukai is just ahead. It is a grand and sacred meeting place. [[Centaur]] from all around the plains gather there.}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|Each season we meet for the Khural, a time of truce and communion. Clans large and small come together, sharing our resources and our stories.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|I do look forward to reconnecting to my peers. Perhaps [[Tigari Khan]] can help me decipher this omen from the river.}}
:{{Text|yell|[[Shikaar Scout]]|The caravan from [[Timberstep Outpost]] approaches. The final [[khan]] has arrived!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scout Tomul]]|I am going to avoid the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]]. They antagonize everyone at these things.}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|The rest of the Shikaar should have already arrived from the other camps. Our rise should be well settled by the time we arrive.}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|It seems the other clans beat us here. Between our outsider and the green dragon emissary, this should be a Khural to remember.}}

Upon entering the city, most of the caravan turns south, up the hill to the Shikaar rise, whereas Sansok, Okir, [[Basran]], and Tomul stop in the central clearing.

Completing the quest also awards the "Into the Plains" criterion of [[Ohn'a'Roll]]
