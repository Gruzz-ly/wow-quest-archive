==Objectives==
Investigate the scene.
*Speak with Khasar {{co|87.0|27.3|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Inspect [[Remains of a Fallen Shikaar|pile of ashes]]
*Inspect [[Spear of a Fallen Shikaar|broken spear]]
*Speak with [[Sabellian]] {{co|87.4|27.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
[[Khasar|This centaur]] practically attacked us upon our arrival. He seems quite protective over this burning pile of ashes.

I know you have worked alongside [[Clan Shikaar|the Shikaar]] before. Would you speak to him? I would like to confirm what happened here.

There is no chance that this is all a coincidence. If it connects to [[Primal Incarnates|the Incarnates]] at all, we must learn all we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Have you learned anything of value?

==Completion==
I begin to see why Fyrakk was sealed away...

Your assistance, as always, has been invaluable.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Khasar|<Name>! Yours is a most welcome face. Are these dragons with you?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Well! More like <he/she> is with us, but yes.}}
:''Khasar lowers his spear and walks back to the ash pile. With a whistle, the bakar return to Khasar's side and Wrathion lowers his hands.''
:{{text|say|Khasar|Very well. Let us talk. I may have need for your assistance again.}}

Speak with Khasar:
:These two descended upon me without warning while I tended to my fallen comrade.
:If they are with you, then I am willing to lower my guard.
:{{gossip|quest=|What happened here?}}
:There was a great calamity last night. I know not the cause of it, but the earth quaked like we have never felt before.
:All of us at [[Timberstep Outpost|Timberstep]] were accounted for except for a single guard, [[Shalkeel]]. We sent search parties into [[Mirewood Fen|the Mirewood]], but found no trace of him. Not until this morning when I came to this cliffside...
:This is all that's left. A pile of ashes. 
:I was only able to identify him by engraving on his spear. I attempted to move the ashes, but they won't stop burning. I've never seen anything like it before.
:Our only option is to bury him here at the site of his death. I asked [[Roscha]] to aid me in the burial, but there are too many repairs to make in the village.
:Would you help me instead, <name>?
:{{gossip|quest=|Did you see anything else?}}
:[[Primalists]]. Many of them. A horde trampled their way through [[Cascades Canyon|the canyon below]] and into [[Iridikron's Gambit|that hole in the earth]].
:The look on your face tells me you'll be following their trail. I can only warn you to be wary and to be prepared.

Interact with the [[Remains of a Fallen Shikaar]]:
:<The pile of ash wafts pungent scents of sulfur and death up to your nostrils. Its flames refuse to subside.
:The only solace for the poor soul this ash used to be is that the overwhelming ferocity of their attacker ensured a quick death.>
:{{text|say|Khasar|The flames will not subside. The ash cannot be moved. He must be buried here where he fell, or his spirit won't be led to Ohn'ahra.}}

And the [[Spear of a Fallen Shikaar]]:
:<A Shikaar spear that's been thoroughly singed. Its wielder must have dropped it before being fully engulfed in flame.
:The only identifiable marks are the artisan-tier etchings of the centaur language upon the shaft.>
:{{text|say|Khasar|The etchings on the spear tell us this warrior's feats, as well as his name: Shalkeel.}}

Sabellian is still kneeling, focused on the gaping hole in the chasm:
:Ebyssian dawdles while the Incarnates breathe destruction on our land. I tire of waiting for him to arrive.
:{{gossip|quest=|Have you learned anything?}}
:The tunnel beneath us was recently bored. So recently, in fact, that I can still feel the heat coming off it from here.
:There are also impressions of ice and earth on the edge of the cliffside. It is as if the ground itself has been manipulated and turned into pure element.
:There is no doubt. This is the work of the Incarnates.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|We can only assume this brutality was the work of Fyrakk.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I will leave you to it, <name>. Take what time you need.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|This tunnel is massive. Was it just for Fyrakk, or did he bring an army with him?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|And he seems to be wasting no time now that he is free.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|We wait upon Ebyssian then.}}

Sabellian starts the next campaign quest, [[The Patience of Princes]], but [[Khasar]] offers an optional follow-up: [[Rest Well, Warrior]].
