==Objectives==
Meet [[Baine Bloodhoof]] outside [[Nokhudon Hold]].

==Description==
I should have known I could not trust the [[centaur]]. They may provide token amounts of aid, but they would never risk themselves for us.

Let us focus on the matter at hand. We cannot allow [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]] to remain in centaur captivity! I will set out immediately for Nokhudon Hold. 

Meet me there as quickly as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have arrived. Good.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I will meet you outside Nokhudon Hold, <name>.}}
:''Baine runs off.''

Find Baine at the northeastern end of [[Nokhudon Hold]] looking at the village.

==Progression==
{{Baine 10.0.7}}

==Patch changes==
