==Objectives==
Investigate [[Suspicious Permafrost]] and slay Glacial Tunnelers.
*[[Glacial Tunneler]] slain (8)

==Description==
[[Merithra]] needn't worry about me. I'm fine. My son's death... I'm fine.

If you really want to help put my mind at ease, there is something you could do. I suspect [[Primalists]] will try to invade these lands again. Unlike last time, I doubt they'll attack the [[Ancient Bough]] directly. They know we'd defeat them.

See those rocks over there? Those off-color, slightly smelly rocks? I hear something moving underneath them. Perhaps Primalists are lurking nearby! Could you investigate? Squash whatever you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can hear them skittering around under the rocks. Who'd dare to summon creatures like that so close to the portal?

==Completion==
I knew there had to be something there. And to think, they were so close to the portal. Now I can contemplate... other things.

While you were hunting, [[Rymek]] and I had a lovely conversation. He's quite understanding and sympathetic. In a way, he reminds me of [[Solethus]]...

He asked if he could see the portal to the [[Emerald Dream]] with his own eyes. I see no reason why not, especially since you've cleared [[Ice spider|those spiders]] away. I'm sure he'll be quite impressed.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Rymek|I understand that you lost a child. Yet you press on with your duties. I find that commendable.}}
:{{text|say|[[Somnikus]]|My son... He was very brave and would have wanted me to continue. And so I shall.}}
:{{text|say|Rymek|How can I help, my friend?}}

Interact with [[Suspicious Permafrost]]s to uncover [[Glacial Tunneler]] spiders. Take out eight.

Return to Somnikus and Rymek. If the objectives of both this quest and [[Guarded Appreciation]] are achieved, [[Gerithus]] flies in:
:{{text|say|Somnikus|No, that can only be done from within the Emerald Dream.}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Greetings. How are things here?}}
:{{text|say|Rymek|It has been most rewarding. And Lord Somnikus has graciously offered to let me see the Dream portal for myself!}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Has he? Well I... suppose...}}

==Progression==
