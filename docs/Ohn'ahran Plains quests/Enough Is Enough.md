;Speaking with Theramus
:<Theramus takes note of you without fanfare.>

:You're still around? There's nothing remarkable to see today. The gardens are a mess. You take care of a weed today, and it just pops up again tomorrow.

:<Theramus closes his eyes and sighs.>

:Nothing I do seems to matter. Very little matters nowadays.
