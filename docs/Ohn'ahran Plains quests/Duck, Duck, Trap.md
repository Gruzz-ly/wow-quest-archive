==Objectives==
Reset the [[Clan Aylaag]] hunting traps at the [[Primordial Vale]].
*[[Sprung Trap (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Traps]] reset (6)

==Description==
The grove called the Primordial Vale is rich with the [[magic]] of the old [[dragon]]s. A type of [[slyvern]] there are prized by my kin for their fur, but they are elusive and hard to find.

Instead of having you try to track them down, you can find some of our hunting traps in the area. Use meat from the nearby waterfowl to reset them - I will send some of our clan to retrieve whatever gets caught.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
The fowl in the area are the preferred source of food for the slyverns.

==Completion==
Thank you. Our clan will hopefully be able to use the resulting pelts for trade.

==Notes==
Kill [[Bluebill Waddler]]s to loot [[Bluebill Meat]], then interact with the traps.

==Patch changes==
