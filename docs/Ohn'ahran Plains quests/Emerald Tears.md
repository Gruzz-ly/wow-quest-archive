==Objectives==
Collect 8 Emerald Tears.
*[[Emerald Tear]] (8)

==Description==
We may've only recently returned to the [[Emerald Gardens]], relatively speaking, but we carry our long-lasting feelings with us.

Many of us are still reeling from the death of [[Ysera]], my grandmother. Including myself. I wish I had gotten to spend more time with her and to learn more from her. What amazing things she's seen in her life!

In places like the Emerald Gardens, when we shed tears, they can crystalize and carry great power within them. I have an idea for how this galvanized grief could help us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you collected some of the Emerald Tears in the garden?

==Completion==
These are beautiful examples, <name>. Now let's see what we can do!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Our tears will look like crystals under the trees. You'll know them when you see them.}}
:{{text|say|[[Rymek]]|Your tears... absorb [[Green dragonflight|your flight]]'s power?}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Yes. Once that power is harnessed, I believe their magic can be used to call to Ysera. It's just a theory, though.}}
:{{text|say|Rymek|Tell me more.}}

Gerithus has new gossip here:
:There's so much potential to be explored.

:{{gossip|What's your theory about Ysera?}}
::As the Dreamer, Ysera has immense power over the [[Emerald Dream]]. I guess since she died, we haven't really had a Dreamer...

::Anyway, nature spirits from [[Azeroth]] who go to [[Ardenweald]], will pass through the Emerald Dream on their way to being reborn.

::So if we can get Ysera that far, and if we can anchor her there somehow, then maybe she came come back. I just don't know how she can leave Ardenweald, if she's bound to the [[Winter Queen]].

::Maybe if someone takes her place. But that's not a nice thought.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
