==Objectives==
Travel with the [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]] caravan to the river crossing.
*Listen to the Shikaar stories (Optional)
*Arrive at the second stop{{Co|69.9|38|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
I hope you don't mind getting your feet wet. The next leg of our journey will take us across two rivers.

[[Ohn Seshteng]] would like to share a story with you about our blessed watcher, [[Ohn'ahra]]. I happily leave you under her watch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|62|10}}
*1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I sense something on the wind.

==Notes==
On accept, the caravan returns to the road and gets going again, following the road south across a ford, turning west past the [[Horn of Drusahl]], and finally coming to a stop on an islet in the river south of [[Clearwater Basin]]. As before, the player can choose whether to rush ahead or walk in step with the caravan (manually or by mounting the [[Stout Riding Bakar]]).

:{{Text|say|[[Aru]]|The Horn of Drusahl will be visible once we cross the bridge. You must see it, two-foot!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Okir]]|Ah, yes. The Horn represents the ancient pact formed by [[Teera]] and a [[green dragon]] named [[Merithra of the Dream|Merithra]]. Their friendship ended a long enmity between dragons and [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]].}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|Afterward, the centaur hunted the plains, and the dragons tended the gardens. But they agreed to help one another in times of need. The Horn of Drusahl was built as a physical manifestation of their oath.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|But then, the dragons left. And after ten thousand years, they return to these lands! I am interested to hear what the [[Khanam Matra Sarest|Khanam Matra]] says about that.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|We are guided by Ohn'ahra, Tomul. It was she who granted us these lands, who arbitrated with the dragons. She knows the way.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Ohn'ahra, the Windmother, is the ancestor of all [[ohuna]]. She led our founders, [[Maruuk]] and Teera, to the plains. [[Clan Ohn'ir|My clanmates]] interpret her songs to advise our people.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Hold! I hear her call. Ohn'ahra will sing to me here.}}

While at the second stop, the [[Pack Musken]] take the opportunity to graze and drink from the river.
