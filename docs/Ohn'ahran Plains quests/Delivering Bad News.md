[[File:Delivering Bad News.jpg|thumb|The tauren occupying [[Toghusuq Village]]]]

==Objectives==
Speak to the [[tauren]] and identify to whom the items you found belonged.
*Find the owner of the axe {{co|73.2|56.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Find the owner of the necklace {{co|72.3|57.2|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Find the owner of the headdress {{co|72.4|55.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
As soon as we arrived, [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] was whisked away. [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]] is still missing, so he is speaking to someone named [[Tagar Bloodhoof|Tagar]].

Of course I've been left out here in the cold. It seems they still don't trust me.

In any case, you should go in and speak with the tauren. Take the items you found and try to identify who they belonged to. At the very least, you can let the families know what we've discovered so far.

But... be gentle, <name>. For some of them, this may be the worst day of their lives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,570 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Tagar has known me since I was a child. He was [[Cairne Bloodhoof|my father]]'s second-in-command for many years.

Long ago, he was responsible for sending [[Rexxar]], [[Rokhan]], and [[Chen Stormstout]] on a mission to rescue me from the [[centaur]].

But they needed aid to complete that mission... and that is when they met Bovan Windtotem.

==Completion==
Thank you for what you have done for these people.

As for [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]], I hate to admit it, but she seems to be proving her worth.

Despite her grating personality.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Well, I'm sick of standing around. I'll head over to Pinewood Post. Check in with Baine when you're done. Tell him I have an idea of where Bovan might be. Perhaps that will catch his attention.}}
:''Tomul walks off to the southeast while the two braves return to the village.''

[[Ironhoof]] is tending to a [[Weary Pack Kodo]] in the northeastern part of the village:
:I know we are in dire straits because of the centaur, but I do not hate them as some of my people do.

:I choose my enemies based on their actions, not their ancestry.

:{{gossip|<Ask about the axe you found.>}}
:{{text|say|Ironhoof|This axe belonged to my friend [[Nawa]]. She would never willingly part with it. If you did not see a body, then chances are she may yet live.}}

[[Tam Windtotem]] is speaking with a [[Bloodied Brave]] at the southern end of the village:
:The centaur are a plague that should be wiped off the face of Azeroth. Bovan was foolish to lead us here.

:{{gossip|<Ask about the necklace you found.>}}
:{{text|say|Tam Windtotem|This necklace belongs to Bovan! I would lead a search party if I could, but we are in no condition to leave the village.}}

[[Koya Windtotem]] is in the northeastern part of the village:
:Many went missing in the last attack, including my husband. He wears a headdress like mine -- a gift I made especially for him.

:Please, if you find him out there, tell him where we are so he can find his way back to us.

:{{gossip|<Ask about the headdress you found.>}}
:{{text|say|Koya Windtotem|My husband is... gone. My daughter will grow up without a father because of the centaur. Just as I did.}}

She has additional gossip:
:I thank you for the news of my husband.

:Please... I would like to be alone now.
