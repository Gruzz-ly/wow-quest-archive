==Description==
I shared with [[Tigari Khan]] the omen we received before entering [[Maruukai]]. She expressed her concern, as the wind felt cold to her as well.

We cultivate certain flowers here, blooms that can be ground and burned to elicit a trancelike effect. They are used to deepen our connection to an omen.

I request that you collect some so that we may make an incense to burn. With my [[khan]]'s help, perhaps we can learn more of [[Ohn'ahra]]'s plight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Tigari Khan is most well-versed in reading omens. With her aid, we can learn more about this omen.

==Completion==
A betrayal threatens Ohn'ahra herself. We must stand tall, <name>. Now is a time for allies.

==Notes==

Loot 5 [[Sweetsuckle Bloom]] from [[Sweetsuckle]]s around the pools, then use them to create [[Sweetsuckle Incense]] and interact with the [[Incense Burner (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Incense Burner]] in Tigari's tent. This creates a vision: an orb of wind rises from the burner and an image of an [[ohuna]] flies toward it, only to be killed by a lightning strike.

Three side quests are also in the area: [[A Disgruntled Initiate]] from [[Windsage Ordven]], [[Shikaar Giver]] from [[Windsage Dawa]], and [[Emberwatch (quest)]] from [[Windsage Kven]].
