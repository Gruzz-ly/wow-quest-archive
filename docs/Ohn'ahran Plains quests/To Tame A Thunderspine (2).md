*[[High-Fiber Leaf]] (20)
*[[Dragon Isles Supplies]] (150)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[Lizi]] is healed, but she's still nervous about leaving her spot. In the wild, she'd forage about a [[musken]]'s weight of plants a day. It's impossible for me to do that! We need her to move out of the water and to the grasses.

I'll keep trying to coax her out, but in the meantime, could you help me forage? I hear there are especially nutritious high-fiber leaves in the [[Emerald Gardens]]. Please bring back any you can find!

==Completion==
This should tide her over until she can forage by herself again.
