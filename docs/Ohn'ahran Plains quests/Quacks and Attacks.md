'''Quacks and Attacks''' is a PvP world quest. Much like forced-PvP world quests of past expansions, players can complete objectives by killing enemies in the [[Stonefray Falls]] should there not be flesh-and-blood targets active.

==Objectives==
* Subdue [[Duck]]s or Kill [[Player]]s (0/100%)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Malicia]]|These birds look innocent... too innocent. I suspect they hide great power beneath those feathers. See if you can harness it.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 11,350 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with the [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Malicia|That was quite interesting. I'll keep it in mind for later.}}

==Notes==
Attack [[Feather Ruffling Duck]]s and [[Dubious Duck]] and get them to 20%, after which they can be mounted.

Using the [[Soft Foam Sword]] at max-level stops the player from killing the ducks instantly.

==Criteria of==
*[[Malicia's Challenge]]

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
