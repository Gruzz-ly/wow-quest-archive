[[File:The Patience of Princes.jpg|thumb|The Throughway, blockaded by Primalists]]

==Objectives==
Delve underground and fell the [[Primalists|Primalist]] blockade.
*Travel through the tunnel

==Description==
[[File:VZ-Throughway.jpg|thumb|Area map]]
The centaur's report of Primalist forces pushing into the underground after Fyrakk changes the situation. Wrathion and I believe it would be a tactical mistake to dawdle here any longer, waiting for Ebyssian and his protige to arrive.

We still wish for you to join us. If you are ready, then we three should proceed together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Stone Breaker]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 27,700 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
To say you smell lost is an understatement!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Every moment we delay works to our foe's advantage.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|By the time Ebyssian finds his dracthyr friend, the Primalists will have completed their schemes.}}
:''Sabellian and Wrathion shift back to their dragon forms and fly into [[Iridikron's Gambit]].''

Mount up and follow them down.

If players are quick enough, they can spot this gossip from Sabellian:
:Ebyssian dawdles while the Incarnates breathe destruction on our land. I tire of waiting for him to arrive.

:{{Gossip|(Teleport to Scenario) I am ready to return to the Underground.}}

Mount up and follow them down. Midway through [[Iridikron's Gambit]], a cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|bY50usydG2k}}
:''The black dragons in visage forms are hiding behind a rock overlooking the Primalists.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|See, Wrathion? They have been marshaling a defense while we tarried.}}
:''Wrathion is looking away, focused on something he can't see.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Wrathion?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Did you hear that? A voice--}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|WRATHION!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Pay attention!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Yes! Of course...}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|These Primalists do not stand a chance.}}

This starts the Patience of Princes scenario.

===Stage 1: What's Beneath the Surface===
:The Zaralek Caverns are crawling with Primalists!
*Discuss the plan with Sabellian
:{{text|say|Sabellian|There are quite a number of them. Let me know when you are ready to discuss a plan, <name>.}}

Speak with Sabellian:
:Fyrakk is our prey. These peons are just stalling us.
:{{gossip|So what's the plan?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Keep low. We have not been spotted--}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I usually prefer the stealthy approach as well, but now is the time to let dragons be dragons! Remind these weaklings who they are dealing with!}}
:''Wrathion steps forward.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Wrathion no! You are just going to--}}
:''Sabellian runs up.''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Going to terrify them? Make them revaluate their life choices? Agreed!}}
:''

===Stage 2: Amateurs of Earth===
[[File:The Patience of Princes stage 2.jpg|thumb|Sabellian taking potshots at Primalists]]
:Defeat Primalist forces and Cliffkeeper Bouldani.
*Earth Primalists slain (0/100%)
*[[Cliffkeeper Bouldani]] slain
:''The Monstrous Mud and Summitshaper Lorac appear.''
:{{text|say|Summitshaper Lorac|Ha ha! I knew you order-addled fools would come!}}
:{{text|say|Summitshaper Lorac|Remember the name Lorac! I ensure these caverns... will be your tomb!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|You think dragons fall so easily?!}}
:''Wrathion shifts to dragon form and takes off, unleashing his breath attack on a wave of attacking primalists.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Stop! He is baiting us, Wrathion!}}
:''Sabellian takes flight as well.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|That blasted-- We have lost the element of surprise. <name>, take on the ground forces and I will support you from the air!}}

While in the scenario, players are buffed and debuffed with:
:{{Abilities|Earth Warder's Protection|Wrathion and Sabellian imbue you with power for the fight ahead. Health and damage increased by 100%, damage taken is reduced by 40%, and heal a few seconds after being hit.|id=406600|icon=inv_misc_head_dragon_black}}
:{{Abilities|Hostile Airways|Dragon riding is not possible with so many hostile Primalists nearby.|id=406608|icon=ability_dragonriding_airbornetumbling01}}

Kill [[Stonebreath Summoner]]s, [[Earthborne Charger]]s, [[Stonebreath Landslider]]s, [[Lumbering Boulder]]s and [[Restless Pebble (Zaralek Cavern)|Restless Pebbles]]. [[Earthquake Totem (Zaralek Cavern)|Earthquake Totems]] can be destroyed as well to make moving forward easier.

Sabellian is flying around, keeping the stonebreath primalists occupied. Take them out and push forward:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Whelp! Stop your showboating! Fall in line and listen to my strategy!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Your endless whining about a strategy will not win you the throne!}}

Earth elementals attack. Sabellian strafes them with another breath attack, severely weakening them. Finish them off as well.

[[File:The Patience of Princes - Bouldani and Wrathion.jpg|thumb|Bouldani and Wrathion]]
Further west, Cliffkeeper Bouldani summons a barricade and Wrathion joins in to help:
:{{text|say|Cliffkeeper Bouldani|I was taught by Lorac, himself! You'll never pass his greatest acolyte - ME!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Let us take this lackey out together, <name>!}}

Finish Bouldani off to advance the phase, regardless of how many earth primalists are defeated:
:{{text|say|Cliffkeeper Bouldani|Master will... kill me for this...}}

===Stage 3: Fyrakk and Brimstone===
[[File:The Patience of Princes - Cimbra and Wrathion.jpg|thumb|Cimbra and Wrathion]]

:Defeat fire Primalist forces and Portalkeeper Cimbra.
*Fire Primalists slain (0/100%)
*[[Portalkeeper Cimbra]] slain

:{{text|say|Wrathion|Stay back, old man. Allow me to clear the way for you.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Insufferable...}}

A wave of fire primalists attack. Wrathion will do his strafe attack thing to weaken them as well. Defeat them, then keep pushing west to reach [[Portalkeeper Cimbra]]:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Now they try to best the black dragonflight with fire? How cute.}}
:{{text|say|Portalkeeper Cimbra|I trained in the [[Firelands]]. You cannot defeat me.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Indeed. Their grasp of effective stratagem is only surpassed by yours, Wrathion.}}

Finish Cimbra off to continue:
:{{text|say|Portalkeeper Cimbra|The Firelands was... not this hot...}}

===Final Stage: Ants Beneath My Claw===
[[File:The Patience of Princes - Lorac.jpg|thumb|Summitshaper Lorac astride the Monstrous Mud]]
:Slay Summitshaper Lorac.
*[[Summitshaper Lorac]] slain

:{{text|say|Wrathion|Now, shall we kick the braggart off his walking mountain of mud?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|This filthy fool seems to be the only one left standing against us. Should we not have some fun?}}
:''Wrathion and Sabellian both move forward as the firewall falls.''

Catch up and the Monstrous Mud and [[Summitshaper Lorac]] spawn in:
:{{text|say|Summitshaper Lorac|Lord Fyrakk was unconcerned, but I knew you'd follow. I am a planner! I am prepared!}}
:{{text|say|Summitshaper Lorac|This is the part where you die! Attack them, my mud minion!}}
:{{text|say|Summitshaper Lorac|Why won't you die? Killing you should have been easy.}}

Finish them off:
:{{text|say|Summitshaper Lorac|I didn't... plan for this-}}

===Finale===
[[File:The Patience of Princes - after.jpg|thumb|[[Elder Honeypelt]] and the player trapped in crystal]]
A cutscene starts as Lorac dies:
{{#ev:youtube|ipn0Q-K_BRM}}
:''Sabellian, Wrathion, and the champion walk away from the corpses of Lorac and the monstrous mud.''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Ugh! I've got muck in my boots. Disgusting!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Hah! I must admit, Wrathion... You acquitted yourself well in the fight!}}
:''As they walk offscreen, the camera keeps focusing in the direction of the corpses. The cave lights up with fire before the scene cuts away to show them stopping overlooking [[Deephollow Lake]].''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Well, I... Thank you, Sabellian.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Once we have dealt with this flame incarnate, I will be sure to find a place for you among my troops.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Your troops?!}}
:''Noticing something, Wrathion pulls his sword.''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Sabellian!}}
:''They spot Fyrakk flying through the Throughway as he launches a fireball at them. The three land on the ground, unconscious, and Fyrakk keeps flying away, seemingly unaware of their existence. From behind the camera, two giant claws reach toward the champion and the scene cuts to black.''

After a loading screen, the next cutscene starts immediately:
{{#ev:youtube|iY7yZKYZbpc}}
:''Regaining consciousness, the champion blinks a few times and looks around, spotting dead niffen on the ground nearby. The champion realizes that they're encased in crystal. A sound from offscreen catches the champion's attention, and they turn to see a deepflayer consuming another niffen corpse.''
:''The champion hears another noise, this time from above, and they turn to spot another crystal, looking like it's about ready to fall. The deepflayer notices too, but the champion smacks their crystal cage to distract it. It leaps over to the champion and roars, then the crystal from above falls and knocks it out!''
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|That'll do it.}}
:''The champion looks down at the deepflayer, then looks up to spot [[Elder Honeypelt]] hanging from a stalactite.''
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|The key is to bonk them in just the right spot... with a ten ton crystal.}}
:''Honeypelt lets go and drops to the ground, landing on the corpse of the deepflayer.''
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Hnhk!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Oof! My joints will be hurting later tonight. Anywhoo...}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|You look like you're new around these parts.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Welcome, uplander! I'm Honeypelt.}}

On the other side of the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|You're an uplander aren't ya? You've gotten yourself into quite the bind. Would you like some help?}}

;Objectives
*Speak with Sabellian
*Delve into Zaralek Caverns!
*Break through the Primalist blockade

;Description
I will not tolerate [[Ebyssian]]'s dawdling any longer. These [[Primal Incarnates|Incarnates]] grow stronger every second, as does my impatience.

[[Wrathion]] and I are in agreement. You may choose to waste your time in wait for our slow-winged sibling, but we would much rather you join us.

I have a feeling you are not the waiting type either.
