==Objectives==
Meet the Keeper of Renown and Renown Quartermaster in Maruukai.
*[[Agari Dotur|Keeper of Renown]]
*[[Quartermaster Huseng|Renown Quartermaster]]

==Description==
<As [[Sansok Khan]] signs, [[Okir]] vocalizes for her.>

The Maruuk as a people are not staunchly against outsiders, but we do require any potential allies to prove their worth. As you meet the clans and aid in our ventures, word will spread of your support.

On the lower level of the krutal on the hill you will find one of the Khanam Matra's daughters, who can help you see where you stand with our people. Be sure to introduce yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]
* +12 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
I look forward to seeing how you contribute to the Maruuk.

==Completion==
I look forward to seeing how you contribute to the Maruuk.

==Notes==
[[Agari Dotur]] and [[Quartermaster Huseng]] are both in the main building just up the hill. Speak with Dotur:
:{{text|say|Agari Dotur|Between gossip amongst the clans at the Khural and news from my mother, the Khanam Matra, I have a good sense of how my people feel. If you ever wish to know your standing with the Maruuk, come to me.}}

Speak with Huseng:
:{{text|say|Quartermaster Huseng|I'm the quartermaster for the Maruuk. If you prove useful to us then maybe I can supply you with some of our goods. We'll see. Don't get any big ideas.}}
