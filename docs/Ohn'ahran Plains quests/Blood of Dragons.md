==Objectives==
Slay Karkidan.
*[[Karkidan]] slain
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
As you've no doubt seen, this land contains creatures which grow beyond their normal size.

We consider these beasts as blessed by the [[god]]s of the wild, and they are often considered honorable targets for [[hunter]]s to prove their strength. One of these beasts, which we call Karkidan, is nearby. I would be most impressed if you managed to take it down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11,700 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
How goes your hunt?

==Completion==
Admirable work! You match the prowess of [[Teerai]]'s finest hunters.

==Patch changes==
