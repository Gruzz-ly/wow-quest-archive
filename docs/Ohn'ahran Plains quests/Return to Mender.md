==Objectives==
[[File:Tombcaller Ganzaya.jpg|thumb|[[Tombcaller Ganzaya]].]]
[[File:Exhumed Spear.jpg|thumb|[[Exhumed Spear]].]]
Investigate the [[Clan Ukhel|Ukhel]] ritual at the nearby mound.
*[[Tombcaller Ganzaya|Ritual Interrupted]]{{Co|37.1|65.7|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Exhumed Hunter's Spear|Spear Retrieved]]{{Co|37.05|65.47|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Return the spear to Zorig.

==Description==
I can't see what they're doing from here, but I fear they're desecrating the [[kurgan]]s.

Please go to the nearest tomb, and see if you can stop the ritual they're performing.

And if you find anything that may tell us their purpose here, please bring it back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Did you stop the ritual? Any clues as to what it was about?

==Completion==
This spear... it belonged to my mother, [[Cathan the Determined|Cathan]]. She was a great hunter. When she got sick, I... I couldn't save her.

Like all great Maruuk centaur, she was buried with her weapon. But this means the Ukhel are using these weapons to raise spirits and bind them to their service - including my mother!

==Notes==
[[File:Cathan the Determined subdued.jpg|thumb|[[Cathan the Determined]] subdued by Ganzaya.]]
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|I will stay here, where I cannot be seen.}}

[[Tombcaller Ganzaya]] roams back and forth at the nearest kurgan to the west. On aggro, he immediately summons the spirit of [[Cathan the Determined]].
:{{Text|say|Tombcaller Ganzaya|Rise! Go and fight for the Ukhel!}}
:{{Text|say|Cathan the Determined|Never! I serve...[[Clan Shikaar]].}}
:''Ganzaya casts "Subdue Spirit" on Cathan.''
:{{Text|say|Cathan the Determined|I... must fight for Clan Ukhel.}}
:''She runs off and Ganzaya attacks the player.''

Kill Ganzaya, then loot [[Exhumed Hunter's Spear]] from the nearby [[Exhumed Spear]]. Upon returning to Zorig:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|Were you able to stop the ritual, <name>?}}
