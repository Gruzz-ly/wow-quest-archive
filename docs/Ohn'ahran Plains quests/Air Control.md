==Objectives==
Slay or knock Primal Nightflames form the air with [[Whirling Surge]].
* [[Primal Nightflame]]s grounded (4)

==Description==
We will never make progress while those shadowflame drakes have us pinned down from the air.

Get up there and knock them from the skies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]
* +150 reputation with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
They are not the only ones who can fly.

==Completion==
The skies are clearer already.

==Notes==
Mount up and use #3 ([[Whirling Surge]]) to take out proto-drakes. With good aim it's possible to take out more than one at a time!

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
