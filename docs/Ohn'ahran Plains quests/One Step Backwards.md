==Objectives==
Protect yourself from The Call.
*Adenedal's Purse Opened
*[[Ancient Mana Gem (Dragonflight)|Ancient Mana Consumed]]
*[[Adenedal's Tidy Purse]] (provided)

==Description==
My friend, it is with great sorrow that I must say that I am familiar with the plight facing your kind in [[Nelthazan Ruins|these ruins]]. If you proceed any further, you too will surely succumb to their madness.

Be it through your nurture or your nature, the call you hear is a physiological one. You have a craving that must be sated.

It brings me great shame to say that I possess the means to feed this malediction. It will not quite be the same, but you will be able to function... For now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|10|50}}
* 3,750 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
I regret that it came to this.

==Completion==
Perhaps [[Dracthyr|your people]] and mine are not so different after all.

==Notes==
[[Adenedal's Tidy Purse]] is automatically given. Open it to loot [[Ancient Mana Gem (Dragonflight)]].
:{{Text|say|Skyscribe Adenedal|This will not be pleasant.}}
:{{Text|say|Skyscribe Adenedal|You must replace this craving with another.}}

Use it. The Call is replaced with Mana Addicted.

==Progression==
{{Nelthazan Ruins}}
