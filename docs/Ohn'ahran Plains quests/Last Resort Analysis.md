==Objectives==
Inquire about the [[:Stormtouched Shards]] in [[Pinewood Post]].
*[[Basaan]] inquired
*[[Nakeena]] inquired
*[[Sondo]] inquired

==Description==
<[[Scout Watu|Watu]] mumbles to himself, eyes closed and arms crossed.>

Of course I get gored by a [[stag]], of all creatures. Now I'm just another one who needs help. My brother will get all the credit, and no one back home will be surprised.

<Watu looks up.> What? What's that you've got there? Glowing rocks? I'll look at one, but take the rest to somebody else. I'm a [[hunter]], not an archaeologist. <Watu snorts, glaring at his leg.> Maybe this is a sign for me to switch jobs. Go on, you've proven more useful than I.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
<A strange look has overcome Watu. He barely registers your presence, infatuated with turning the shard over in his hands.>

You see how it glows, like new lightning?

==Completion==
<Watu stares at shock at his leg, newly bloody and pierced with the shard.>

==Notes==
;Speaking with Basaan
:{{Gossip|Do you know anything about this shard?}}
::<Basaan takes a shard and knocks it against a piece of iron.>

::It's tough. I could sharpen that and put it on the end of a spear.

::<He hands the shard back and wipes his hands roughly on his leather apron.>

::I don't like touching it. Doesn't give me a good feeling at all.

;Speaking with Nakeena
:{{Gossip|Do you know anything about this shard?}}
::Haven't seen anything like that from my travels, nor from my travelers. It's certainly not from these plains.

;Speaking with Sondo
:{{Gossip|Do you know anything about this shard?}}
::Sorry. My specialty is foodstuffs.

::Though you say this grew in an animal? That's unnatural. I'd burn it and bury it.

After speaking with all three, Watu stands up.
