==Objectives==
Accept [[Lizi's Reins]].

==Description==
I think [[Lizi]] is ready to be a beast of the plains again. She's so friendly to you and I now, but I can tell she wants to return to the wild.

One day, when I am a Windsage, I will explore all of the world beyond these springs. But first--my midseason initiate trials! How time flies.

I made a saddle and reins from the wool you gathered. Lizi will be happy to come at your call.

Please take her on all the adventures, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
