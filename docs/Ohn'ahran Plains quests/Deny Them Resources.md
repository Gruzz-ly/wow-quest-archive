==Objectives==
Recover infusion supplies from [[Fyrakk]]'s forces.
* [[Suffused Ingots]] (6)

==Description==
This entire invasion has been carried out with the sole objective of infusing raw materials with elemental power on an unprecedented scale.

While we may not know Fyrakk's ultimate goal, frustrating his efforts seems straightforward enough.

If he wants these materials, we will deny them to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Leave him nothing.

==Completion==
Excellent. Anything we can take from him buys us time.

==Notes==
Loot Infusion Supplies chests for their [[Suffused Ingots]].

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}

==Patch changes==
