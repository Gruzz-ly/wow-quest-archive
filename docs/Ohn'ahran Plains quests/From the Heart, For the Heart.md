'''From the Heart, For the Heart''' becomes available after reaching Renown 24 with the [[Maruuk Centaur]].

==Completion==
Ah, dragonrider. I have something for you.

<Huseng holds up chest armor, sized for a <race>.>

We had to, uh, scale it down to fit you. It is fine make. Too fine to simply give it away. But I can sell it to you for the cost of materials.

You have proven yourself an ally of [[Maruuk Centaur|the Maruuk]]. Time for you to look the part!
