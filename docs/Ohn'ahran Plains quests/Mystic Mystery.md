==Description==
[[File:Unidentified Centaur.jpg|thumb|The Unidentified Centaur]]
I'm sorry, I've failed to commune with [[Ohn'ahra]]. You will need someone else to fulfill [[Khanam Matra Sarest|the Khanam Matra]]'s request.

Several days ago, my [[Clan Ohn'ir|fellow mystics]] were called to [[Ridgewater Retreat]] on an urgent request from [[Tigari Khan]]. They should still be there.

Meet me outside of town. The least I can do is show you the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|10|50}}
*4,700 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
<Name>, you're alright! Thank Ohn'ahra.

Oh! These are my totems.

==Completion==
I barely escaped that ambush with my life. I'm afraid my fellow mystics weren't so lucky....

==Notes==
On accept, Boku walks down the path from the shrine and despawns.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Meet me outside Teerakai when you are ready. I will guide you to Ridgewater Retreat.}}

Head east down the road. At the entrance to [[Szar Skeleth]], Boku is nowhere to be found, but [[Boku's Belongings]] are lying on the road. Interact with them:
:<Boku's belongings are strewn about the area. Perhaps they were dropped in a hurry. One of Boku's totems is missing.

:There are more hoof prints nearby. It looks like Boku fled and was pursued by several other centaur.>

:{{Gossip|<Collect Boku's belongings.>}}

This puts a [[Boku's Belongings (item)]] item in the player's bag. Follow the road east to where a dead [[Unidentified Centaur]] is lying. Interact with the body:
:<This is not Boku.

:Some of the centaur's wounds look like they were inflicted with magic. Perhaps he is one of Boku's attackers.

:The dead centaur's hand is clutching an object. Prying it loose will take some work..>{{Sic}}

:{{Gossip|<Take the object.>}}

This puts [[Boku's Totem]] in the player's bag and causes two [[Nokhud Marauder]]s spawn and attack.
:{{Text|say|Nokhud Marauder|The outsider is aiding the Khanam Matra!}}

Interacting with the Unidentified Centaur again simply yields:
:<This is one of [[Balakar Khan|Balakar]]'s men. There is nothing else of importance on the body.>

[[File:Mystic Mystery.jpg|thumb|Boku and the other mystics]]
After killing the Marauders, continue east along the road. Boku waits with [[Tigari Khan]], a [[Wounded Initiate]], and two [[Badly Wounded Mystic]]s on the side of the road just north of Ridgewater Retreat. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|And so, the storm begins.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|What can we do?}}

Interacting with the Wounded Initiate yields the following gossip
:<The mystic's wounds are are bloody and severe. She grunts painfully as she looks at you.>
:We thought we were answering a summons from Tigari Khan to meet at Ridgewater Retreat.
:It was a trap.
:Only a few of us managed to escape. The Nokhud showed no mercy.

Interacting with the Badly Wounded Mystics yields the following gossip
:<This mystic is covered in wounds and... burns? It looks as if he was struck by lightning.>

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|We must delay the Nokhud as long as possible to buy time for the Khanam Matra's plan.}}
