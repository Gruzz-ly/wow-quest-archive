==Objectives==
Slay hornswogs and territorial proto drakes with [[Toluiqi]].
*[[Hornswog]]s slain (10)
*[[Territorial Proto Drake]] slain (5)

==Description==
You there, outsider! You have killed [[proto dragon]]s before, yes?

So it stands to reason that your experience combined with my hunting prowess, we can take down quite a few! There are springs around here that attract draconic beasts.

Help me prove to my foolish other half that I am the better hunter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt?

==Completion==
We return victorious! No doubt this will prove my superiority to the clan.

==Notes==
[[Brackish Hornswog]]s and [[Gargantuan Hornswog]]s count.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
