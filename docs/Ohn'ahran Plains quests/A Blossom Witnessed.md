'''A Blossom Witnessed''' begins the final chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]]. It unlocks after defeating [[Fyrakk the Blazing]] in [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]], or the week of 12 December 2023 for all players regardless of raid progress.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Merithra]] at the [[Ancient Bough]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].
* Speak to [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]]

==Description==
[[Amirdrassil]] has bloomed beyond the confines of [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]].

Let us venture to the [[Dragon Isles]] and see where this new [[World Tree]] has taken root.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is magnificent!

==Completion==
<Merithra's face lights up.>

Champion, we are among the very first to see Amirdrassil here on [[Azeroth]]. This is truly a precious moment.

==Notes==
Don't immediately head east back to the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]] yet, but speak with Tyrande at the quest-starting location:

{{Dialogue|
We will stand and defend Amirdrassil, even if it means that we must travel deep into the heart of fire itself.

The [[Fyrakk the Blazing]] finale [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cinematic]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|bGpzdIMHSSU}}
:''A wave of energy passes through the five [[Dragon Aspects]] and [[Vyranoth]] on their platforms, knocking them all unconscious. The camera tracks around to [[Alexstrasza]] and focuses in on her face. She opens her eyes, revealing a golden glow as the scene cuts to black.''

After that, head east out to the Ohn'ahran Plains through the [[Ancient Bough]] portal, then head to the southwestern corner of that island. [[Vyranoth]], [[Alexstrasza]], [[Merithra]], [[Ysera]], [[Ebyssian]], [[Kalecgos]], and [[Nozdormu]] are all there, in their dragon forms, looking west at the new World Tree.

The dragons that were part of the [[Fyrakk the Blazing]] encounter reprise their gossip here.
