==Objectives==
Learn about the situation in the [[Emerald Gardens]].
*Offer aid to the [[Green dragonflight|Green Dragonflight]]{{Co|61.04|40.44|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
I will admit that I have not left the Emerald Gardens in all my life, and as such, I have never met a [[centaur]], let alone a mortal from the mainland.

However, I am not here as a kindly visit, but rather to plead for the centaur's aid in securing [[Emerald Oathstone|our oathstone]] and protecting our charge.

I am glad to see you are here to help as well. There is much to discuss.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Ohn'ir Initiate Vestments
|Nokhud Reaver Chestplate
|Shikaar Scout Hauberk
|Teerai Watcher Vest
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The Green Dragonflight has lost much over the years. We need the aid of mortals where possible.

==Completion==
More friendly faces are welcome indeed.

==Notes==
Speak to Gemisath again. She offers several gossip options for more exposition, but only one that advances the quest:
:It is a new age for the [[Dragon Isles]], <name>.
:{{Gossip|quest=|I am here to help restore the Green Oathstone.}}
:{{Text|say|Gemisath|Your support is welcome. Our forces are small in number. There are a few defenders among us but we are gardeners, not fighters.}}
:{{Text|say|Gemisath|Within our gardens stands a portal to the [[Emerald Dream]]. We cannot empower our Oathstone without forces to defend our charge from [[Primalists|Primalist]] attacks.}}
:{{Text|say|Gemisath|[[Merithra of the Dream|Merithra]] hopes that [[Khanam Matra Sarest|the Khanam Matra]] upholds her ancestors' pact to aid us in this time of need.}}
