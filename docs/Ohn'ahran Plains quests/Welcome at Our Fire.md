==Objectives==
Meet with [[Scout Tomul]] at [[Timberstep Outpost]].

==Description==
You have fought alongside our hunters and earned a place at our fire.

[[Sansok Khan|Our khan]] is at our hunting post in [[Mirewood Fen|the swamp]], readying our upcoming caravan. I will notify her of your arrival and purpose.

Surely you can find your way on your own.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You outsiders seem to have a habit of meddling in the affairs of others.

==Notes==
On accept, Tomul runs off again, disappearing down the road through the [[Mirewood Fen]].
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|My khan is at our outpost nearby. Follow this path through the swamp... and try not to get eaten.}}

The [[Timberstep Archer]] guards at the outpost's western entrance comment on the player when they pass through.
:{{Text|say|Timberstep Archer (1)|Another outsider. This one must be Tomul's.}}
:{{Text|say|Timberstep Archer (2)|Ha! Do not let Tomul hear you say that.}}

As the player arrives in the outpost, [[Sansok Khan]] is having a meeting with [[Koroleth]] and two [[Primalist Ideologue]]s while Tomul waits at the bottom of the hill.
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|It has been ten thousand years since the dragons were last in the [[Dragon Isles|Isles]]. They are invaders upon your land. Join the [[Primalists]]. Embrace the storm. We will aid you in the battles to come.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Okir]]|Are you, too, not invaders? The [[Khanam Matra Sarest|Khanam Matra]] welcomes the dragons to our [[Khural]]. Take your leave. The storm has no place in the lands of [[Ohn'ahra]].}}
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|Your Khanam Matra leads you to servitude. We offer a future of strength. When you see your error, we will be waiting.}}
:''Koroleth and the Ideologues turn around, walk off, and despawn.''

A number of side quests are available at the outpost, including [[Nergazurai (quest)]], [[Sole Supplier]], and [[Thieving Gorlocs]], of which the latter two start the "Mudfin Village" side storyline.
