'''Chasing the Wind''' begins the "Bonds Renewed" chapter of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]].

==Objectives==
Listen to [[Scout Tomul]]'s report.
*Report heard{{Co|60.1|37.64|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Talk to Khanam Matra Sarest{{Co|60|37.48|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Taivan]] ridden (Optional){{Co|61.14|40.01|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Meet Khanam Matra Sarest outside the [[Horn of Drusahl]]{{Co|73.03|40.59|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
We must take a moment to pause and consider our strategy.

We need [[Ohn'ahra]]'s blessing to sound the [[Horn of Drusahl]] and summon the [[Green dragonflight|green dragons]]. Without their aid, we cannot win this war. The [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] already outnumber the other clans, and their forces are now bolstered by the [[Primalists]]. We must therefore find Ohn'ahra before the Nokhud can launch their final attack and encircle [[Maruukai]].

I will send all of our scouts to find her at once. I only hope we can find her in time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We are too late. The Nokhud have overrun the Horn of Drusahl and slaughtered my people.

This act of aggression will not go unanswered.

==Notes==
On accept, [[Scout Tomul]] spawns at the entrance to the chamber. She runs past [[Khansguard Akato]], who salutes her. Upon stopping in the doorway, she gives a salute of her own.
:{{Text|say|Khansguard Akato|Scout Tomul approaches!}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Ah, [[Clan Shikaar|your clan]] is as motivated as ever, [[Sansok Khan]].}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Enter, Tomul. The khans eagerly await your report.}}
:''Tomul walks into the chamber, stops in front of the war table, and salutes again.''
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Honored khans! We have spotted a warband of Nokhud headed toward the Horn of Drusahl.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|[[Balakar Khan|Balakar]] is leading them himself.}}
:{{Text|emote|Sansok Khan furrows her brow as she signs.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Okir]]|How large is the warband? We should be wary. This might be a diversion.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Enough to overwhelm the village at the base of the hill, but far from all their forces.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Tigari Khan]]|What of [[Koroleth]]? Have you seen her or Ohn'ahra?}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|No, not yet. We are still looking for them.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|We must assume the Nokhud want to destroy the Horn to prevent us from calling the green dragons.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Sansok is correct. This may be a diversion. We cannot commit all of our forces, even if it is to defend our most sacred artifact.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|I will take the [[khansguard]] and confront Balakar myself.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Tomul, outsider, you will come with me.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Tigari Khan, Sansok Khan, gather your clans and prepare for battle.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Once Ohn'ahra has been found and the green dragons have been called, we will march on [[Nokhudon Hold]].}}

Talk to Sarest:
:The Horn of Drusahl is one of our most sacred relics. We must assume Balakar has abandoned our ways. He will destroy it to prevent us from calling the green dragons. If we are to have any hope of saving it, we must make haste.

:Since you will not keep up with us on those two legs of yours, we have prepared a mount for you. [[Taivan]] is our largest [[bakar]]. He can carry you swiftly to the Horn, or you can take that [[Dragonriding|tamed drake]] of yours and meet us there.

:{{Gossip|I understand.}}

The player can choose to head directly to the Horn on their own, or ride on Taivan to hear more exposition. Taivan sits waiting in his usual spot in front of [[Healer Selbekh]] in the city center:
:<Taivan tilts his head to the side, his tongue dangling.>

:{{Gossip|Good boy! Let's ride!}}

:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Take good care of our new friend, Taivan!}}

Taivan starts loping, taking the road to the east. Sarest, Tomul, Akato, [[Khansguard Hojin|Hojin]], and [[Khansguard Jebotai|Jebotai]] appear, running down the hill from the [[krutal]], to gallop in procession alongside Taivan. Along the way, they have a conversation with the player.
[[File:Chasing the Wind end.jpg|thumb|Waiting outside the village]]
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|We must hurry, <name>. The Horn of Drusahl must be protected at all costs.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|I don't think an outsider can really understand the gravity of the situation, Khanam Matra.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Then I will educate them.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|The Horn is our most sacred relic, built generations ago by [[Teera]] herself as a symbol of the friendship between the Maruuk and the dragons.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Before the dragons departed, a ceremony was held at the site. "In times of great strife, blow the Horn, and we will answer," the dragons said.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Ohn'ahra herself blessed the Horn, summoning great winds to blow through it. That was the only time the Horn has sounded in our great history.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Though it has been centuries since the green dragons left these lands, they entrusted the Maruuk with protecting them.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|I have to believe that the dragons will still honor our pact of friendship and come to our aid when we sound the Horn.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|But that pact, and our entire way of life, is now threatened by that fool Balakar and his selfish bid for power.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Let us hope the [[Clan Teerai|Teerai]] who guard the Horn have held out...}}

Upon approaching the Horn, the centaur and Taivan leave the road to instead hide behind a small outcropping west of the village. Sarest, Tomul, and the khansguard take up positions and the player automatically dismounts from Taivan (who despawns).
