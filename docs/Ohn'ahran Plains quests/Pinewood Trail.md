==Objectives==
Meet up with [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]] and [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] at [[Pinewood Post]].

==Description==
If [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]] is not dead, and he is not here, then either he is still out there... or he has been captured. Given Tomul's message, I fear it's the latter.

The [[Windtotem tribe|Windtotem]] are safe for now, but with an attack possible at any moment, they can't spare any [[brave]]s to go after Bovan.

It looks like it is up to us. Let us head to Pinewood Post.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Tomul wanted me to wait for you in her encampment, but I... politely declined to do so.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Tagar, I will be going after Bovan. Tomul says she might have a lead on his whereabouts.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tagar Bloodhoof]]|Baine... she is a [[centaur]]. How can you trust that she is not leading you into a trap?}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|If she had wanted that, she could have done it already. She has sworn to help save Bovan, and thus far she has upheld her end of the bargain.}}
:{{text|say|Tagar Bloodhoof|She may not be an enemy, but the centaur are still unreliable and without honor. Perhaps she will help for now, but will she stand with you in your hour of greatest need?}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I have my doubts. But I will give her the opportunity to dispel them. One way or another, we shall see what her words are worth. Farewell, my friend.}}
:{{text|say|Tagar Bloodhoof|[[Earthmother]] watch over you, Baine.}}
:''Baine walks off.''

Head across the river to the northeast to catch up with Tomul and Baine just outside [[Pinewood Post]]:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|This is ridiculous! The centaur in this outpost are my clansmen. They are not about to do anything to you!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I will not enter a centaur outpost unless it is to do battle!}}

Tomul has gossip:
:Trying to convince Baine we are here to help is like trying to move a rock by talking to it.

==Progression==
{{Baine 10.0.7}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.7|note=Added.}}
