==Objectives==
Use the Water Elemental to diffuse fires in the Suffusion Camp.
*[[Water Spout Totem]] activated {{co|75.6|68.7|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Fires extinguished (0/100%)

==Description==
[[File:Volunteer Fire Fighters - fire.jpg|thumb|The camp alight]]

We must contain the fires these rituals are causing.

We are too far from the river to take advantage of the waters there but luckily we have two... volunteers... from beyond the plains that claim they can help. They need another pair of hands.

Please go find the goblin and gnome. I appreciate their help but they need a third party to direct them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]
* +150 reputation with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Quickly, before they spread.

==Completion==
A useful trick, to be sure. Now if those two would just see more eye to eye.

==Notes==
Find [[Zooti Fizzlefury]], [[Senior Journeyman II Goldmine]], and a water elemental with a totem stuffed into it just to the north:
:{{text|say|Zooti Fizzlefury|I have strong reservations about this.}}
:{{text|say|Senior Journeyman II Goldmine|Why? This elemental can't feel it. It is like sheering a sheep. It probably would be thanking us if it could talk.}}
:{{text|say|Zooti Fizzlefury|No! I meant about that amateur spell stick you shoved in its back.}}

Players can earn the achievement [[We Didn't Start the Fire (achievement)]] by abandoning and restarting this quest a few times.

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}
