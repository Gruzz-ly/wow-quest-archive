==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ysera]] to lower the barrier.
*Speak with Ysera

==Description==
That should be enough. I can sense the others just on the outside of the grove, ready to enter [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]].

When you're ready, speak to me and I will break the ice walls and bring down the dome. I hope that my changes will not dishearten the flight. 

We will not be done, but we will be all together again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I cannot believe it. All that I could have hoped for... 

She is here.

But I can tell that she's changed. I do not know what this means, and I fear we do not have much time to ponder it. We must go after Rymek.

==Notes==
Speak with Ysera:
:We are so close now. The Primalists must be stopped and the Dream restored.

:Even if it is not I who has the power to restore it.

:{{gossip|I'm ready.}}
An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|1p2TtjC4hm8}}
:''Ysera glances at the adventurer and Gerithus, then unleashes a breath attack, sweeping across the field and destroying the ice. With that, the barrier above fades, and Merithra and two other dragons fly in as [[Nightsong]] starts playing. Meithra and Ysera shift to their visage forms.''
:{{text|say|Merithra|<Breathing heavily>}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Mother...}}
:''Ysera smiles and brings her palm to Merithra's cheek.''
:{{text|say|Merithra|<Sighs>}}
:''They hug.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the script continues:
:{{text|say|Merithra|Something is... different. You have been touched by Death.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Come, we must fly with all haste to Lunedane. That is the last line of defense, where our enemy's fate will be sealed.}}
:{{text|say|[[Somnikus]]|Rymek must pay for what he's done. I will not let him reach [[The Sisters' Tear|the World Tree]].}}
:''Somnikus flies off.''
:{{text|say|Merithra|We should all fly together, Somnikus!}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Let him go. Only he can absolve his anger now. We each have our own part and our own power.}}
