==Objectives==
Introduce yourself to members of [[Clan Shikaar]].
*Speak to [[Ohn Seshteng]]{{Co|85.6|20.8|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Speak to [[Aru]] and [[Belika]]{{Co|85.7|26.6|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Speak to [[Beastmaster Nuqut]]{{Co|83.93|25.88|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Report to [[Scout Tomul]].

==Description==
<As [[Sansok Khan]] signs, [[Okir]] vocalizes for her.>

It has been countless generations since an outsider like you reached our lands. With [[Primalists]] treading on our lands and peddling forbidden [[magic]]s, my people are understandably wary.

If you are to travel with us, you must make yourself known. Introduce yourself to the members of my clan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Good. The khan is putting you to work.

==Completion==
The rest of our attending clan has already traveled to [[Maruukai]] to prepare our site. The caravan from this outpost will be the last to arrive.

==Notes==
;Ohn Seshteng
[[Ohn Seshteng]] is in a solitary tent north of the outpost.{{Co|85.6|20.8|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
:[[Ohn'ahra]] whispered of your arrival, traveler.
:{{Gossip|I am <name>. I will be joining your clan for the Khural.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|The winds carried word of interesting times, but the arrival of your people has caused more of a stir than I expected.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|I look forward to learning more of your ways as we travel.}}
:''Seshteng walks back to the outpost and despawns.''

;Aru and Belika
[[Aru]] and [[Belika]] are up on the eastern outskirts of the outpost.{{Co|85.7|26.6|Ohn'ahran Plains}} On approach:
:{{Text|say|Aru|I will be the greatest hunter this clan has ever seen!}}
:{{Text|say|Belika|You wish, Aru. Which of us killed their [[Proto-dragon|proto-drake]] faster?}}

Speak to either Aru:
:Hunting is all about precision. A clean kill leaves more usable material. It's not about how many creatures you can kill, but how many resources you can bring back to your clan.
:{{Gossip|I am <name>. I will be joining your clan for the Khural.}}

Or Belika:
:Being a good hunter is all about speed. The faster you can take down a beast, the faster you can move onto your next target!
:{{Gossip|I am <name>. I will be joining your clan for the Khural.}}

Both give the same result:
:{{Text|say|Aru|Wow! I have never seen someone like you. How are your hunting skills?}}
:{{Text|say|Belika|I bet we can out-hunt you. I will out-hunt both of you!}}
:''The two run down the path into the outpost and despawn.''

;Beastmaster Nuqut
[[Beastmaster Nuqut]] is on the western outskirts.{{Co|83.93|25.88|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
:I tend to our beasts of burden.
:{{Gossip|I am <name>. Will you be joining the caravan for the Khural?}}
:{{Text|say|Beastmaster Nuqut|Hmmm, no. I'm afraid my hooves no longer take me to Maruukai, but my beasts of burden are vital to the caravan. I shall ready my [[musken]] to pull the wagons.}}

==Progression==
{{Into the Plains}}
