The ancestors are gripped by this dark magic. They will fight before they follow. The [[Clan Ukhel|Ukhel]] raised our fiercest warriors and hunters. Stopping them will be no easy task.

I'm going to come along and help. It's time I put [[Exhumed Hunter's Spear|my mother's spear]] back to use.

Once they are defeated, use this totem I've crafted to help the subdued spirits find their way back to the [[kurgan]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Hurry. We must free these spirits.

==Completion==
I'm so relieved that my mother is at peace again. Thank you, <name>!

==Notes==
On accept, Zorig starts following the player.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|I could not do this without your help, outsider.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|Let us hope the totem works as I expect.}}

The player needs to kill the spirits of [[Cathan the Determined]], [[Zaphil the Defiant]], [[Ganmat the Wise]], and [[Dihar the Unyielding]], then interact with them to cast "Restored Respite" and release their spirits with the totem. All four roam around the main kurgan in the southwestern corner of the subzone. Zorig has unique dialogue after releasing each spirit.

Upon engaging Zaphil:
:{{Text|say|Zaphil the Defiant|I welcome a challenge! I hope you can provide one.}}
Upon defeat
:{{Text|say|Zaphil the Defiant|But... I've never been defeated.}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|Centaur children tell stories around campfires of all the battles that Zaphil won.}}

Upon engaging Ganmat:
:{{Text|say|Ganmat the Wise|A strong opponent is a great teacher! Are you prepared to learn?}}
Upon defeat
:{{Text|say|Ganmat the Wise|You have taught me... a great deal.}}
Upon using the totem
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|Every [[Clan Ohn'ir|initiate]] learns the Six Insights of Ganmat. What an honor to lend him aid!}}

Upon engaging Dihar:
:{{Text|say|Dihar the Unyielding|You cannot outrun my bow.}}
Upon defeat
:{{Text|say|Dihar the Unyielding|But... no one can withstand so many arrows!}}

:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|According to our legends, no centaur ever fired as many arrows as Dihar.}}

Cathan (who normally does not have an aggro line) has unique aggro dialogue during this quest:
:{{Text|say|Cathan the Determined|No! I cannot... I will not fight my son!}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|You always did the right thing, no matter how difficult. So will I, Mother.}}
Upon defeating Cathan
:{{Text|say|Cathan the Determined|I have never before been relieved to lose.}}

Unlike the other three, who simply disappear in a burst of wind when the player casts Restored Respite on them, Cathan's spirit briefly reappears after being freed:
:{{Text|say|Cathan the Determined|You have given me yet another reason to be proud of you, Zorig.}}
