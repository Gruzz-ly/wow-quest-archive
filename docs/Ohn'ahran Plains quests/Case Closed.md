[[File:Case Closed.jpg|thumb|Funeral pyres with [[tauren]] and [[centaur]] looking on at [[Toghusuq Village]]]]

==Objectives==
Meet [[Scout Tomul]] and [[Baine Bloodhoof]] at [[Toghusuq Village]].

==Description==
You are lucky we arrived when we did. We intercepted [[Clan Nokhud|the Nokhud]] reinforcements about to flank you during your fight with [[Jamoku]].

We lost two of our number in that battle. Their bodies have already been recovered. [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan's]] is the last.

The Nokhud will not take long to rally and hunt us down. We must leave now.

Head to Toghusuq Village, where the tauren are encamped. We will meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Baine hasn't said much since we left Nokhudon Hold. I did not realize just how much this Bovan meant to him until now.

As for me, I will head back to Maruukai after this funeral. My khan's command has been fulfilled, even if this was not the outcome we would have liked.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Tomul walks over to Baine, as Baine picks up Bovan.''
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Baine, it's time for us to leave.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I know.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|<Name>, my rangers and I will escort Baine. Meet us at Toghusuq Village.}}
:''They all walk off.''

At [[Toghusuq Village]], the tauren and centaur have set up funeral pyres. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Glad to see you made it out in one piece, <name>.}}

Present are [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Scout Tomul]], [[Koya Windtotem]], [[Tagar Bloodhoof]], [[Nawa]], [[Ironhoof]], and unnamed [[Bloodied Brave]]s, [[Child of Ohn'ahra|Children of Ohn'ahra]], [[Exhausted Spiritwalker]]s, [[Shikaar Ranger]]s, [[Windtotem Sojourner]]s are looking on. [[Tam Windtotem]] is looking at a distance.

All named characters have gossip:
;Baine Bloodhoof
:<Baine looks deep in thought. Perhaps you should not disturb him.>
;Scout Tomul
:It was I who suggested that we honor our dead together. I hoped to show the tauren that these centaur lost their lives recovering their leader from the Nokhud.
:If that doesn't convince them that we are not their enemies, I don't know what will.
;Koya Windtotem
:I admit, I initially objected to this shared funeral. I do not think I will ever forgive the atrocities committed by centaur against my family.
:But if this helps build a world where tauren and centaur can coexist in peace... then I support it, for my daughter's sake.
:I think my husband would have wanted that.
;Tagar Bloodhoof
:Decades ago, I asked Bovan to help save Baine from the centaur. I owed him a great debt for that. 
:But... I failed to do the same for him. I must bear that for the rest of my life. 
:My only path forward now is to honor his memory by protecting his people.
;Nawa
:Thank you for rescuing me, <name>. I never would have made it out without you.
:<Nawa glances at the centaur nearby.>
:I have never met a friendly centaur before. It is almost a contradiction for me.
:<Nawa smiles weakly.>
:But I will try to get used to it.
;Ironhoof
:As you can see, my people are still not comfortable around the centaur. 
:Generations of tauren and centaur fought and died for centuries in [[Kalimdor]]. And even though these centaur have never been to Kalimdor, old scars run deep.
:But I hope in time they will be able to overcome their traumatic past and see beyond the surface, as I have.
;Tam Windtotem
:I will not be fooled, <name>. There may be talk of peace for now, but the centaur are a devious people. 
:They will strike when our guard is down. Murder. Plunder. It is in their blood and very being.
:I will not let my people suffer at the hooves of the centaur. Not now. Not again.
