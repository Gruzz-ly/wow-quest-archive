==Objectives==
Gather 60 Nelthazan Artifact Fragments.
*[[Nelthazan Artifact Fragments]] (60)

==Description==
The [[Sundered Flame]] are here. Would you trust anyone claiming to be sundered with precious artifacts?

I did not think so. Regardless, we need to know what they are here for if we are to proceed. Gather what you can recover from them and report back to me with your findings.

There are more pieces to this puzzle than what we will find in the ground.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|10|50}}
* 3,750 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
[[Nelthazan Ruins|These ruins]] are ruined enough.

==Completion==
They are still looking for something? Then why did you bring me this garbage?

We have to find it before they do!

==Notes==
All of the mobs in the area are afflicted by {{Abilities|The Call|An enchanting melody calls to this <unit name>.|id=392206|icon=ability_warrior_dragonroar}}
