==Objectives==
Find Theramus again.
*Follow [[Celina Crunchyleaves|Celina]] and [[Felina Starrunner|Felina]]
*Speak to [[Theramus]]
*Shrine restored

==Description==
Oh, no! Now I think I understand. Theramus...he misses [[Ysera]], and she can't come back.

Come! I suspect I know where he went. We won't bother him further, but it'll be good to tell him that we're sorry, and that we'll give him the space he wants.

We are here for each other, within the nature all around us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

:{{Text|say|Celina Crunchyleaves|I didn't know that that was on his mind.}}
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|Me neither.}}
:{{Text|say|Celina Crunchyleaves|It's been so long, though. Since she left. Since things have changed.}}
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|Time does not heal all wounds, sister.}}
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|Right up this path, <race>. Let's go.}}

;Speaking with Theramus
:Ysera and I built this shrine together before she left. She infused the gardens with [[magic]], so a part of her would always remain.

:But now that magic, and Ysera herself, are long gone.

:{{Gossip|I understand.}}
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|We are sorry for bothering you so much, Theramus. We didn't know.}}
:{{Text|say|Celina Crunchyleaves|We'll help you restore this overgrown shrine.}}
:{{Text|say|Celina Crunchyleaves|Ergh--by the trees, help me, Felina!}}
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|The growth is too deeply rooted!}}
:''Theramus transforms into his dragon form and assist the dryad in their cleansing ritual, succeeding in restoring the shrine.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Celina Crunchyleaves|Wow! Theramus, you did it!}}
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|It's so beautiful.}}
:{{Text|say|Theramus|We did it, my friends. Thank you.}}
:''Celina and Felina run behind the shrine to look at the view.''
:{{Text|say|Celina Crunchyleaves|[[Glade Hopper|Those hoppers]] should've worked.}}
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|Maybe if you'd caught a dozen more.}}
:{{Text|say|Celina Crunchyleaves|W-well! Maybe you should've added about one pound less of [[:sourbloom]] to his--}}
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|I'm kidding, sister. You're the sweetest dryad I know.}}
:{{Text|say|Celina Crunchyleaves|...Hmph. Yes, I am.}}
:{{Text|say|Theramus|You two are precious. I owe you both my deepest gratitude.}}
