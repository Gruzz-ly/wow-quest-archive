==Objectives==
Slay centaur within [[Nokhudon Hold]].
*Slay [[centaur]] within Nokhudon Hold (0/100%)

==Description==
[[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]]. [[Gelkis clan|Gelkis]]. [[Magram clan|Magram]]. [[Kolkar clan|Kolkar]]. They are all the same...

They plague the land. They murder [[Tauren|my people]]. No more!

I will end this [[centaur]] threat. Here! Now!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will make them pay for what they have done.

==Completion==
<After cutting through dozens of centaur, Baine is visibly fatigued. He is breathing hard and covered in wounds.>

[[Jamoku]]... was responsible for all of this...

I will not... let him escape...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|yell|Baine Bloodhoof|NOKHUD! I am Baine Bloodhoof! Son of [[Cairne Bloodhoof]]! I will have justice for [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]]... and all the lives you have taken!}}

Baine joins the adventurer as a bodyguard, providing a buff to players:
:{{Abilities|Baine's Justice|Helping Baine enact justice on the Nokhud centaur. Damage done increased by 25%. Kills restore 50% of maximum health.|id=401029|icon=achievement_character_tauren_male}}

Kill anything that moves. Baine will handle most of it, as he has quite a repertoire of abilities:
*{{abilities|Executing Charge|id=404778}}
*{{abilities|Heroic Leap|id=404796}}
*{{abilities|Mortal Strike|id=404526}}
*{{Abilities|War Stomp|id=404736|Knocks enemies near the caster up into the air and stuns them for 3 sec.|icon=ability_warstomp}}
*{{abilities|Warbreaker|id=404529}}
*{{abilities|Whirlwind|id=404753}}

While in combat, Baine has these barks:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Face my wrath, centaur!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|For Bovan!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I send you to your ancestors!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Justice is served!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|You will pay for what you've done!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Your rampage ends here!}}

Get the bar to 100% by killing [[Nokhud Sentry|Nokhud Sentries]], [[Nokhud Stormcaller]]s, [[Nokhud Huntmaster]]s, [[Ravenous Bloodbeak]]s, [[Nokhud Wardog]]s, and [[Nokhud Brute]]s:
:{{text|yell|Jamoku|Who dares challenge the might of Jamoku?! Come and face me outsiders!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Jamoku! He is mine!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Face my wrath, centaur!}}

==Progression==
{{Baine 10.0.7}}
