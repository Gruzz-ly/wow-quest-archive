==Objectives==
Meet [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]] and [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] on the eastern road near the [[Watering Hole]].

==Description==
Since the [[dragon]]s returned, we've seen an overwhelming number of outsiders passing through the plains. Normally we keep a close eye on our borders, but their sheer numbers, combined with the Nokhud threat, have made it difficult to track them.

One scout reported a group of outsiders that matched your description traveling along the eastern road. We should start our search there.

As for your friend, [[Sansok Khan|my khan]] gave me a command. A huffy companion won't stop me from carrying it out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|80|90}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It seems the centaur here are not all that different from those in [[Kalimdor]].

<Baine eyes Tomul suspiciously.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Listen two-foot. If you want to find your friends, you'll need me. I know the land and the people. So if you're done with your tantrum, let's go.  I don't have all day.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Hmph. Fine. But make no mistake centaur--I'll be watching you.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|You can watch me leave for all I care. I have a job to do.}}
:''Tomul walks off to the east, with Baine following.''

Catch up with them and an [[Injured Windtotem Survivor]], several more dead tauren, a dead (and burning) pack kodo, and more burning supplies to the southeast:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|My clan had nothing to do with this...}}
:{{text|say|Injured Windtotem Survivor|Lies! If my arm were not broken, I would strike you down where you stand!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Enough! Let us deal with the immediate issue.}}

The survivor has gossip:
:Shortly after we entered the plains, we saw our first centaur. They feigned friendship so they could assess our strength and numbers, then signaled their comrades to attack.

:We have been harried by them ever since. Their latest attack was in force, and it took all we had to repel them.

:This Tomul has offered to help, but we have an old saying--"beware the centaur bearing gifts".

As does Tomul:
:I don't think I've ever been met with so much hostility in my life. 

:And for me, that's saying something.
