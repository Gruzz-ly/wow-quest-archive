Ah, dragonrider. Welcome back. Here's some dust. No, I don't know what it really is either. The [[Ohn'ir]] [[mystic]]s say it's supposed to help you commune with our ancestors. That the ancestors are all around us. Seems optimistic, if you ask me.

I can't claim to understand the Ohn'iri. The sky's honest truth is that I don't really want to. They're good people, mostly, but they're strange. Unnerving. But also allies, and they asked me to give it to you. And to make more available if you want it. So I do.
