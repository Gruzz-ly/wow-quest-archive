[[File:Maruuk's Spear.jpg|thumb|upright|Maruuk's Spear placed.]]
Enter the [[Nokhud Offensive]], defeat [[Teera and Maruuk]], and place their weapons in the Teerakai [[kurgan]].
*Retrieve [[Sarantuya the Ever-True|Teera's Bow]]

==Description==
[[Teera]] and [[Maruuk]]'s weapons were removed before we stopped [[Tombcaller Arban]]. Our greatest ancestors may fight again in these plains... for the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]].

Go to the Nokhud Offensive. Find Maruuk and Teera. When you have subdued them, bring their weapons back to the Teerakai burial mound. We will lay them back to rest with the honor they deserve, in a place we can protect more easily.

==Progress==
Were you able to defeat the legendary spirits of our founders?

==Completion==
I would never have expected such help from an outsider before. You have my thanks.

==Notes==
On accept, Zorig leaves the player's side, runs off, and despawns:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|While you free Maruuk and Teera, I'll update [[Elder Yuvari|Yuvari]] on what's happened.}}

He permanently moves to Teerakai, where he stands next to Elder Yuvari with Cathan's spear in hand.

[[File:Teera's Spirit.jpg|thumb|upright|Teera's Spirit.]]
Defeat the [[Teera and Maruuk]] encounter in the [[Nokhud Offensive]], then loot [[Sarantuya the Ever-True]] and [[Batubar the Relentless]] from the [[Ancestors' Treasure Trove]]. Return to [[Teerakai]] in the open world, enter the southeastern side of the kurgan, and interact with the ghost image of Teera's Bow in the innermost right-hand chamber. This causes [[Teera|Teera's Spirit]] to briefly appear:
:{{Text|say|Teera's Spirit|It is good to know [[Clan Teerai]] still thrives! You have my gratitude for saving me from fighting against my own people.}}

[[File:Maruuk's Spirit.jpg|thumb|upright|Maruuk's Spirit.]]
Do the same with Maruuk's Spear in the opposite chamber, causing [[Maruuk|Maruuk's Spirit]] to appear:
:{{Text|say|Maruuk's Spirit|Many thanks, friend, for returning me to my rightful resting place. It is good to know the centaur have more friends than when we first chose to leave our homes.}}

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Elder Yuvari|Zorig?}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|Yes, Elder Yuvari?}}
:{{Text|say|Elder Yuvari|You're more than ready to face the trials to become a windsage.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|I agree. I no longer fear the trials.}}
:{{Text|say|Elder Yuvari|Very well. I'll speak to the Ohn.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|Thank you. <name>, please accompany me. I need to put my mother's spear in a safe place.}}
:''Zorig runs down the path to the kurgan.''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|We'll restore the [[Eternal Kurgans]], and protect them. Still, I'd like to place my mother's spear closer to home where I can watch over it.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|I was not able to heal my mother when she fell ill, but I can ensure her protection and honor her now.}}
[[File:Founders Keepers.jpg|thumb|Cathan and Zorig in the kurgan.]]
:''Zorig slows down to a walk upon entering the mound. He walks into the first chamber on the left and places the spear on top of the coffin there. The spirit of [[Cathan the Determined]] appears in front of him.''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|Mother! I... I am sorry. I couldn't heal you. And I'm sorry that when you were dying, I never told you the things I needed to say.}}
:{{Text|say|Cathan the Determined|Zorig, you have nothing to apologize for! You did your best, and you saved me from an afterlife enslaved to those necromancers.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|I... I never thanked you for being such a strong and kind mother. You taught me how to serve my family and my clan.}}
:{{Text|say|Cathan the Determined|I knew. But I was even more proud to have you as a son. You'll do great things for the [[Clan Ohn'ir|Ohn'ir]], Zorig - you already have.}}
:''Cathan fades away.''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|I love you, Mother. Thank you for everything.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|And thank you, <name>. My mother is at peace again because of you.}}
:''Zorig walks out of the kurgan and back to his old spot next to Yuvari.''
