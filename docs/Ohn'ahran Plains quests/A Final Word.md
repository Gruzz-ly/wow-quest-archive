'''A Final Word''' concludes the "Old Hatreds" chapter of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]].

==Description==
I have sent a message to [[Mayla Highmountain|Mayla]] in [[Valdrakken]], relaying what has happened here. I suspect she will be relieved to hear from me... and in knowing she was right to send you.

Before you leave, I would like to speak with you a moment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Ancestral Bloodhoof Totem]] (tauren only)
* [[Display of Strength]]
* [[Ancestor's Might]] (tauren only)
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]] (50x [[Dragon Isles Supplies]])
* [[A New Beginning (achievement)]]

==Completion==
;Non-tauren
: <Name>, there are few who would have gone to the lengths you have to aid me in this endeavor. You had no personal stake in this matter, yet you risked your life for my sake.

: For this, you have my deepest gratitude. Should you one day require my assistance, you need only ask.

: <Baine bows deeply.>

: And now there is one last person I must speak to.

;Tauren
: <Name>, without you this journey would have ended differently. Thank you for staying by my side during this ordeal.

: Beyond that, you have opened my eyes to a new path forward. A path I never dreamt possible for our people. This is worthy of a special gift.

: These totems are inscribed with the history of our people. A history steeped in the blood of the centaur.

: But you have taught me that though we must not forget our past, we need not be chained by it.

: Take these totems with my deepest gratitude.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|[[Scout Tomul|Tomul]]... I owe you an apology. Fear and old hatred clouded my eyes, and I let it affect my judgment. For that, I am sorry.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Thank you. We all grapple with past traumas and grudges, but it takes strength to move forward from them.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|We are not that different, you know. Both of our peoples value balance, nature, peace, and honor. Perhaps there is still room for friendship?}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Perhaps. For now... I wonder if you could show me your home. I would like to learn more about your people.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|It would be my honor. You are my second favorite two-foot after all.}}

Once complete, check back in the village after the next weekly reset, the village is phased again to contain additional NPCs and new gossip texts, including [[Rexxar|several]] [[Rokhan|old]] [[Chen Stormstout|familiar]] [[Misha|faces]].
