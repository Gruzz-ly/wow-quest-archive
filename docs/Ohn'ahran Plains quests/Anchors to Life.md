==Objectives==
Empower the [[Inert Anchor]]s with the [[Emerald Tear]]s.
*Empower First Anchor
*Empower Second Anchor
*Empower Third Anchor
*Wait for [[Merithra]] to Arrive

==Description==
Based on my research, I believe there's a way to reestablish [[Ysera]]'s ties to the [[Emerald Dream]], so we can bring her closer to [[Azeroth]].

When Ysera died, the [[Winter Queen]] used her own power to restore her in [[Ardenweald]]. For now, she's bound there, but I think if we can just get Ysera over into the Emerald Dream, we can use these anchors to keep her there.

But I'm getting ahead of everything.

First, we have to infuse these anchors with the power of those Emerald Tears.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is so much potential within ourselves.

==Completion==
That's it! I can feel the power in the anchors.

Now, of course, there's just the one tiny problem of how to get Ysera to cross from the realms of death into the realms of life. One thing at a time.

For now, I'll get these anchors to the [[Shady Sanctuary]] for safekeeping.

[[Merithra|My mother]] is here. She must have more that she wants you and [[Rymek]] to see.

==Notes==
Three Inert Anchors appear around Gerithus. Interact with them in any order, turning them to [[Infused Anchor]]s:
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Once Ysera has crossed out of the realms of death, I believe the power of these anchors will help her remain in the Dream.}}
:{{text|say|Rymek|But the Dreamer is dead, my friend. How do you plan to bring her back?}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|That... I don't know. But I'm confident that I can figure out a way.}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Even now, [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] and [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]] are exploring the depths of Ardenweald, searching for possibilities.}}
:''Merithra flies in and shifts to her visage form.''
:{{text|say|Merithra|Hello again. Have your discussions been enlightening?}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Hello, Mother. I was just telling Rymek about my theory.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Rymek|I have learned much here today. But what do I see there, over the water?}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|That is the [[Ancient Bough]], a portal to the Emerald Dream.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|[[Somnikus]] guards the [[Emerald Oathstone|Oathstone]] there. He has been withdrawn of late. Perhaps a visit from a blue emissary will cheer him.}}
