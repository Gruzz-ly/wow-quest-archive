'''Return to Roscha''' concludes the optional "Mudfin Village" storyline at [[Timberstep Outpost]].

==Objectives==
Return the supplies to [[Farrier Roscha]].
*[[Shikaar Supplies (object)|Supplies]]

==Description==
[[Baba]] is rested, and Roscha's supplies are recovered. We can return without upsetting her further.

Take some boxes when you go. I will send warriors for the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
What took you so long?

==Completion==
You have the supplies? Good.

Leave them by the forge.

<Roscha looks around and frowns.>

==Notes==
Interact with the crate of [[Shikaar Supplies (object)|Shikaar Supplies]] at the back of the cave. Doing so puts a crate on the player's back.
:{{Abilities|Supply Crate|id=371722|Carrying Shikaar Supplies.|icon=inv_crate_05}}

Khasar gets the same buff and starts walking out of the cave with Baba.
:{{Text|say|Khasar|Come, Baba. Let us return to Roscha with the supplies!}}
:{{Text|emote|Baba barks.}}
:{{Text|say|Khasar|See you soon, <name>!}}

They both then run out of the cave and despawn. Back at [[Timberstep Outpost]], the captured [[bakar]] that the player rescued have all rejoined their owners. The player can also optionally inform [[Batu (bakar)|Batu]] and [[Sarnai]]'s owners, [[Ranger Bolor]] and [[Gatherer Zaya]], of their dogs' death.

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Farrier Roscha|Where in the Ohn'ahran Plains is Khasar!?}}
:''Khasar and Baba run up to Roscha. Baba starts running in circles around [[Apprentice Ehri]].''
:{{Text|say|Khasar|No need to worry for me, Roscha. All is well now.}}
:{{Text|say|Farrier Roscha|Worry? I was annoyed, not worried!}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Ehri|I'm glad you're safe, Khasar. And so is Roscha. Come! Let's get back to work.}}
:{{Text|emote|Baba yips.}}
:''Khasar and Baba walk into a nearby tent and sit down.''

Completing the quest also awards the "Mudfin Village" criterion of [[Sojourner of Ohn'ahran Plains]].
