==Objectives==
Set up the Scary Effigies. You may unlock only one extra fishing net per day.
*Place Effigy (5)

==Description==
Greetings friend!

I've been looking for a good place to set up fishing nets around here, but it seems like the population of waddlers around here is too dense - they're eating away most of the juvenile fish before they get a chance to mature.

I've made some effigies to scare at least some of those ravenous birds away. This will help us sustain the abundance of fish across the [[Roaring Dragonsprings|Dragonsprings]].

Can you help me set those up?

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Restock Fish|id=384012|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}
*{{Abilities|Extra Net - Roaring Dragonsprings|id=390723|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}

You will also receive:
*[[Ominous Conch]] (1)
*{{cost|2|57|40}}
*1,150 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Did you set up enough effigies?

==Completion==
Well done, my friend! Feel free to set another fishing net now, there should be enough us all.
