==Objectives==
Befriend [[Wish (bakar)|Wish]] with food, and use Wish's Whistle to save 5 Lost Argali in the [[Sagecrest Pines]].
*[[Diced Meat]]
*Treat Wish
*[[Lost Argali]] saved (5)
*[[Wish's Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
How frustrating. A rabid [[stag]] did this while my brother [[Sentinel Olekk|Olekk]] and I were scouting.

<Watu gestures at his bloody leg and winces.>

Are you here to help? After the [[primalists]] attacked, our herd of [[argali]] scattered into the pines. Their wool and milk are essential to the camp's functions.

Take this whistle, which commands Wish to herd the argali back home. [[Sondo]] the butcher has her favorite treats if she needs extra encouragement.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Make haste. Argali are a favorite snack for the local--well, local everything.

==Completion==
So our argali live. Give Wish an extra pat for me, will you? I would do it myself, but I can't move. <Watu sighs.>

==Notes==
Buy the meat from [[Sondo]] and interact with Wish.
:The bakar snoozes deeply on a bed of fur.

:{{Gossip|<Offer the diced meat.>}}
:''Wish runs away from the camp.''
