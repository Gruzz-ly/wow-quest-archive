==Description==
The [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] are powerful and have many allies. It will take all we have to withstand them.

<Name>, you have [[Khanam Matra Sarest|the Khanam Matra]]'s trust. Her orders were to rally our friends and prepare our people.

I need your help. Seek Hojin to mobilize the remaining [[khansguard]]. Alert Scout Khenyug to possible Nokhud incursions. Inform Agura to expect wounded, and tell Gensai to prepare our provisions.

As for [[Clan Ohn'ir|the mystics]], I believe they left recently. I will see if any remain in Teerakai.

==Progress==
It is rare for us to meet outsiders. It is even more rare to have them helping us, as you are. Thank you.

==Completion==
I did not wish to cause a panic, but the people must be ready. Clan Nokhud is not known for mercy.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Khansguard Jebotai|The [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]] have not seen such a massive conflict for generations. This war will spread across the entire plains.}}

:A handful of fragrant flowers can brighten anyone's day!

:{{Gossip|War is coming. Jebotai asks you to prepare for casualties.}}
:{{Text|say|Herbalist Agura|What terrible news. Why must our beautiful plains be soaked in blood?}}

If spoken to again:
:War smells of blood and ash. Battlefields reek of death and decay.

:I much prefer the scent of flowers.

;Quartermaster Gensai

Talk to him:
:I haven't seen your kind before. How can I help you?

:{{Gossip|Clan Nokhud has declared war. Jebotai asks that you provide provisions.}}
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Gensai|War? Why? Are we safe here?}}
:{{Text|say|Assistant Subame|Is everything all right, Father?}}
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Gensai|Just some trouble on the roads. Best we stay in Teerakai for a while.}}

If spoken to again:
:We've dealt with clan conflicts before, but a centaur war...

:<Quartermaster Gensai takes a glance at his daughter.>

:Let us hope it ends quickly, before our children pay the price.

If Assistant Subame is spoken to:
:What did you tell my father? Why does he look so worried?

Talk to him:
:Are you lost, stranger? What are you looking for?

:{{Gossip|Balakar has declared war on the Khanam Matra. Jebotai wants you to ready the khansguard.}}

:{{Text|say|Khansguard Prospect (1)|Yes, sir!}}
:{{Text|say|Khansguard Prospect (2)|Yes, sir!}}
:{{Text|say|Khansguard Prospect (3)|Yes, sir!}}

If Hojin is spoken to again:
:<Khansguard Hojin drops his voice to a whisper.>

:Morale is high, and the khansguard are strong, but I know the Nokhud. We are badly outnumbered.

:We may need Ohn'ahra herself to win this war.

Just outside the training area, a wanted poster starts [[WANTED: Mara'nar the Thunderous]].

:{{Gossip|Clan Nokhud has declared war on all Maruuk.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Khenyug|Nokhud? Those violent upstarts are ambushing my scouts? Well, then. Our spears will greet them at dawn.}}
