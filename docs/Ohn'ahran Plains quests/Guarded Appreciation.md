==Objectives==
Give 6 guards Rymek's Gift.
*Give Rymek's Gift to Emerald Guards (6)
*[[Rymek's Gift]] (provided)

==Description==
I know it can be quite exhausting work to defend such an important locale. And often, we [[drakonid]]s and [[dragonspawn]] get very little thanks for our dedication.

I wish to bestow some of my own appreciation to the guards here in [[Ancient Bough]].

Here, offer them these gifts from me, as a sign of friendship. I hope my heartfelt gesture properly expresses my gratitude.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you given the guards my gifts?

==Completion==
Very good. I hope they like those gemstones. I made them myself, just for this special occasion.

==Notes==
[[Emerald Scaleguard]]s and [[Emerald Warden]]s are all over the area. Speak with them:
* Step softly.
* The Dream is near, here.
* Yes?
* Welcome to Ancient Bough.

*{{text|say|That's... colder than I expected.}}
*{{text|say|Wow, that's cold. To the touch, I mean. It's a nice enough gift.}}
*{{Text|say|No one ever gives me anything. This is great!}}
*{{Text|say|A gift, for me? Thanks!}}
*{{Text|say|What's this for?}}

Return to [[Somnikus]] and Rymek. If the objectives of both this quest and [[The Chittering Rocks]] are achieved, [[Gerithus]] flies in:
:{{text|say|Somnikus|No, that can only be done from within the [[Emerald Dream]].}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Greetings. How are things here?}}
:{{text|say|Rymek|It has been most rewarding. And Lord Somnikus has graciously offered to let me see the Dream portal for myself!}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Has he? Well I... suppose...}}

==Progression==
