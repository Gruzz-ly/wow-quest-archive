==Objectives==
Return the Medallion to [[Farrier Roscha]].
*[[Medallion of a Fallen Friend]] (provided)

==Description==
When we join [[Ohn'ahra]] in the wind, we leave these medallions behind.

Although I helped craft this medallion, I am not its rightful owner.

It should be returned to Roscha. It is the last memory of her betrothed.

Take it to her so she may mourn and be at peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Roscha's Band of Remembrance]]
*{{cost|13|10|50}}
*3,750 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Completion==
Is this... ah. It is. My beloved is in the sky, then, running with Ohn'ahra. I will join her... in time.

Thank you, <name>.

I will remember what you have done for [[Clan Shikaar]]. And for me.
