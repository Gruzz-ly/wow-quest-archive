==Objectives==
Consult [[Storykeeper Jaru]], [[Farrier Rondare]], and [[Tigari Khan]] for guidance on how to treat the ancient corpse.
*Storykeeper Jaru Informed
*Farrier Rondare Informed
*Tigari Khan Informed
*Meet Tigari Khan at the riverbed site

==Description==
This gal has been here for a long, long time. It's a wonder she's in such good condition.

It's one thing to dig up pottery shards in the mud, but something like this requires more care and expertise than you and I have combined! [[Maruukai]] isn't far from here...

We should tell the centaur about this. They can decide how best they'd like to proceed, eh?

While we're at it, I bet some of their expert artisans can tell us about her gear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
* +150 reputation with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
We've got a proper dig now here!

==Completion==
It doesn't get better than this, <name>. New chapters of history unfolding, whole communities rallying around a find...

They'll be talking about this dig for years!

Makes all the stomping around in the mud worthwhile, doesn't it?

==Notes==
;[[Storykeeper Jaru]]
:{{Gossip|quest=|<Share your archaeological finds.>}}
:{{text|say|Storykeeper Jaru|There is one such tale... Long ago, in times of strife between dragons, a Khanam Dochra in the mountains-- a favored daughter, heir to the Khanam, sought to lead her tribe to safety.}}
:{{text|say|Storykeeper Jaru|Her hope burned brightly but could not warm the cruel chill of a sudden winter storm. Her caravan was never recovered.}}
:{{text|say|Storykeeper Jaru|Perhaps the elements have finally seen fit to set her free. I will go see to her.}}

;[[Farrier Rondare]]
:Yes? I have much work to do.

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Share your archaeological finds.>}}
:{{text|say|Farrier Rondare|Hmm. If what you say is true, then...}}
:{{text|say|Farrier Rondare|This armor looks to be of ancient make for which the technique is lost.}}
:{{text|say|Farrier Rondare|I will determine if it is authentic. Meet me at the riverbed.}}

;[[Tigari Khan]]
:{{Gossip|quest=|<Share your archaeological finds.>}}
:{{text|say|Tigari Khan|She has travelled far to return to us.}}
:{{text|say|Tigari Khan|Let us learn what we can. And then grant her rest at last.}}

Upon going back to the location of the corpse, Tigari Khan has new gossip:
{{book|content=It is good you brought us here. These rites are long-awaited.

{{gossip|quest=|Let's finally put her to rest.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Tigari Khan|Khanam Dochra, favored daughter whose name is lost to time, your journey is finally at an end.}}
:''The corpse is put to flames.''
:''Tigari Khan, Storykeeper Jaru and Farrier Rondare bow''
:{{text|say|Tigari Khan|Long have you lied beneath the earth. Now let this flame lift you and carry you to rest with Ohn'ara.}}
:{{text|say|Tigari Khan|Thank you for bringing us to her, Roska... and <name>. [[Ohn'ahra]] guide your path.}}
