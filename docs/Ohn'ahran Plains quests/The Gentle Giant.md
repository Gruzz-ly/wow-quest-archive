==Objectives==
Send Taivan to Shepherd Tevatei at the Mallakh to be trained.
*Talk to [[Taivan]]
*Meet [[Shepherd Tevatei]] at the [[Mallakh]]

==Description==
If Taivan is really as "un-ferocious" as [[Hunter Jadar|Jadar]] says he is, perhaps he'll be better suited as a herding [[bakar]]!

[[Clan Aylaag|The Aylaag]] are expert [[argali]] shepherds, and aren't so proud that they require lavish gifts to help another [[clan]].

Please send Taivan to Shepherd Tevatei at the Mallakh, a spot between two hills in the south-west where they train their bakar.

[[Ohn'ahra]], please let this work. If it doesn't, I'm all out of ideas.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found Shepherd Tevatei yet? I believe he trains bakar in a place called The Mallakh, south-west of here.

==Completion==
Well hello there, newcomer. What can I do for you and your very large friend?

==Notes==
Speak with Taivan:
:<Taivan does not seem his normal happy self. He seems to have realized he let Selbekh down, and is determined to not let it happen again.>

:{{Gossip|Go find Shepherd Tevatei, Taivan. I will meet you there.}}

:{{Text|say|Taivan|Aroooo!}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|He had quite the look of determination on his face! I wonder if he understands how important this is.}}
