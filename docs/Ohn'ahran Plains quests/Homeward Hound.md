==Objectives==
Ride Taivan back to Maruukai.
*Talk to [[Taivan]]
*Ride Taivan to [[Maruukai]]

==Description==
We have everyone stabilized, thanks to you and Taivan, but many of these villagers will need to heal for a while longer in Maruukai.

Why don't the two of you lead our train back? You are both the heroes of the day, after all!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We're ready to depart. Go ahead and mount Taivan when you're ready.

==Completion==
And here we are. Home again, safe and sound.

I can't begin to express how grateful I am that you and Taivan arrived when you did. You saved many lives today!

==Notes==
;Speaking with Taivan
:<Taivan can barely contain his excitement. He fidgets back and forth and thumps his massive tail against the ground.>

:{{Gossip|Let's go home, boy!}}
:''The player hops on Taivan.''
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Lead the way, Taivan!}}
:''The group starts walking.''
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Look at him. He's so proud of himself.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Oh, you want to race back? Is that it, boy?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Windsage Duusalkhi]]|Go on ahead, Selbekh. I can lead the wounded back.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Why not? It's been a while since I've let myself have fun. Let's go!}}
:''Selbekh and Taivan start racing.''
:{{Text|say|Taivan|Aroooooo!}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|I admit I feel quite foolish, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|I was just about ready to send Taivan away, when he just needed the chance to prove himself.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|He is very strong; strong enough to move heavy debris and strong enough to carry a full-grown centaur.}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|And he is very brave. Brave enough to charge right through hot flames!}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|These qualities will make him an excellent rescue bakar. A perfect companion for a healer like myself!}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|How closed minded I have been!}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Thank you for opening my eyes, <name>.}}

;Gossip back in Maruukai
:<Taivan is excited to see you! His massive tail thumps against the ground and he sloppily licks your face with his huge tongue.>
