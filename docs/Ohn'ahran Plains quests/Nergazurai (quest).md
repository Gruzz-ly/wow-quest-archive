'''Nergazurai''' is an optional side quest at [[Timberstep Outpost]].

==Objectives==
Bring an Ottuk Heart, a Rockfang Femur, a Hornstrider Scale, and a Vulture Gizzard to [[Muqur Rain-Touched]] in [[Timberstep Outpost]].
*[[Ottuk Heart]]
*[[Rockfang Femur]]
*[[Hornstrider Scale]]
*[[Vulture Gizzard (Ohn'ahran Plains)]]

==Description==
My uncle told me many tales of his battle with a [[hornstrider]] named [[Nergazurai]]. He told me of its fuchsia scales weaving through the hills of the plains as it seeks its prey, its razor-sharp talons and venomous bite.

While I was out hunting I saw the flash, but it was too late; it left me with a nasty bite in my shoulder. He was as terrible as my uncle described, but I came out alive.

I need to clean the infection from his bite. Please, collect the reagents I need. Time is of the essence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
My fever grows worse, friend. I fear if I do not clean the infection soon, it will be the death of me.

==Completion==
Thank you. With these reagents I should be able to stop the infection from spreading, then hopefully clear it completely. I owe you a life-debt.

Be wary of Negazurai{{sic}}, traveler. His thirst for blood is unyielding.

==Notes==
All of the required items are rather rare drops and will take a number of kills to obtain. [[Rockfang Femur]] and [[Vulture Gizzard (Ohn'ahran Plains)]] drop from [[Ravenous Rockfang]]s and [[Ravine Vulture]]s in [[Rockfang Ravine]], [[Ottuk Heart]] from [[Clearwater Ottuk]] in [[Reedwhistle Bay]], and [[Hornstrider Scale]] from [[Swift Hornstrider]]s near the [[Waking Shores]] border.

Upon completion, Muqur rises from his wounded position to stand upright.

==Trivia==
*This quest is a callback to the original version of the [[Mulgore (Classic)|Mulgore]] quest [[Mazzranache (Classic)]]. Both involve gathering four rare animal parts so the quest giver can clean an infected bite from a hornstrider/[[tallstrider]], who can also be encountered as a rare mob. Large portions of the text for this quest are identical to Mazzranache's quest text.

==Patch changes==
