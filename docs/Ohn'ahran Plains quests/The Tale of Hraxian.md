'''The Tale of Hraxian''' is offered by [[Veritistrasz]] at [[Dragonscale Camp]] the next daily reset after completing [[Stain Removal]], the capstone of the "Medicinal Fungi" optional storyline of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]]. Players must have also completed the full "Verbal Archaeology" questline from the [[Zskera Vaults]] in the [[Forbidden Reach storyline]], concluding with [[A Dusty Vase]], for Veritistrasz to offer this quest.

==Objectives==
Listen to the tale of [[Hraxian]].
* Listen to the tale of Hraxian

==Description==
Hello <name>, it is good to see you.

Would you like to join us around the fire? I think it is time we heard a positive story about the [[Black dragonflight|obsidian flight]] of old.

I once promised yourself and [[Voraxian]] I would tell you the story from the vase you found in the [[Zskera Vaults]]. I believe it is that time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* [[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]] (30x [[Dragon Isles Supplies]])
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is always a pleasure, <name>.

==Completion==
<Veritistrasz sits in silence for a short while.>

Thank you for listening, <name>. I have forgotten much over my life, but not this.

I hope Hraxian's story gives the obsidian flight hope after the discoveries we made here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|What [[Lead Researcher Sytorian|Sytorian]] did... not all the obsidian flight were depraved, there was good in them too. I will tell you of a hero who defended the weak and saved many.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Tellywin, could you write this down? I want my flight to hear of this as well.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tellywin Sharpfizzle]]|Of course.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|This is a tale set in the final battle with the [[djaradin]] elders, where [[Neltharion]] banished them.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|This is the tale of Hraxian, and how he died.}}

Speak with Veritistrasz:
*{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} Tell us of Hraxian.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|He always put up with the antics of the young with a smile and a wink and he was loved for it.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Hraxian was one of the oldest [[black dragon]]s. It was said only the Earth-Warder surpassed him in strength among his flight. But for all that, he was a gentle soul.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|He would sneak whelps treats when others were not looking, and he would lift the mood of any he spoke to.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|What happened in the battle?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|The draconic army faced off in a final stand against the djaradin elders. The army needed to buy Neltharion time to enact his plan.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|The battle went... poorly. The djaradin elders' mastery over earth and fire was catastrophic; they laid waste to the draconic forces.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|One of our flanks crumpled under a devastating attack. As the djaradin closed on our medical wing, Hraxian flew to help.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|As he landed, he looked towards the wounded and the noncombatants.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|He looked towards me.}}
*{{gossip|I may return later. I have other business first.}} (completes the quest)

Speak with Veritistrasz again:
*{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} You were there?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I was a young dragon assigned to healing duties. Hraxian was my idol growing up. Heh, I was one of the whelps he used to sneak treats to.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|You know, I do not remember what the treats were anymore. It was such a long time ago. I have a vague memory of lemon... and tart hochenblume?}}
:{{text|say|[[Chef Butterfingers]]|After this, let's talk. See if we can recreate it.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I would very much like that.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|What did Hraxian do?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|The djaradin have a need to prove themselves the strongest - a weakness Hraxian exploited.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Hraxian roared a challenge of single combat to the djaradin: a challenge they readily accepted.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Hraxian slew his opponent with one swipe of his claw and bellowed the next challenge.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|One by one the djaradin faced Hraxian, and one by one they fell.}}

Continue the story:
*{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} How did the djaradin react?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|As the first djaradin strode towards him, I could feel the djaradin armies roar deep in my chest.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I could feel their hate, their lust for his blood, their yearning for his skull.}}
:{{text|say|[[Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental]]|They sound like absolute louts, no different from the oafish djaradin of our time.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|You are not wrong. Though they started confident, as each champion facing Hraxian fell, the cheers of the djaradin died a little until they began facing him in silence.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|What did you do?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Nothing, I could only watch. Breaking single combat was not an option. Many of us tried to heal him, but he warned us back every time.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Hraxian fought for what felt like hours, though... it cannot possibly have been that long.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Scores of djaradin weapons had left their mark; his blood and scales littered the ground.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Even so, he made them pay for it. Each challenger had to clamber over their dead to meet Hraxian.}}
:{{gossip|quest=|How did he die?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|It was not a djaradin who killed him - not an individual one at least.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|After his final battle, he stood silent. The djaradin waited for his next challenge, but it never came.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Hraxian died on his feet, with his eyes open, staring them down.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Each battle had drained his blood and his life until there was none left.}}
:{{gossip|quest=|What happened after he died?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|As the djaradin waited for the next challenge, Neltharion banished the elders, and the djaradin fled.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|However, a few djaradin advanced. They collected the weapons of the fallen and planted them in the ground around Hraxian.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Then they left, leaving his body untouched. It is the only time I have seen djaradin behave in such a way to a dragon.}}
:{{gossip|quest=|Thank you for the tale, Veritistrasz.}}
:{{text|say|[[Earthmender Narvra]]|Why is it we always lose the best of us...}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I know how you feel. We hold onto the dark memories, where we remember those we loved and lament we could do nothing to prevent them leaving us.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|We miss them. We miss their laughter, their smile, their quirks. We focus on our loss, and the fact they are no longer with us.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I have lost so many. But thanks to <name>, I am trying to change how I think.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Instead of lamenting that loss, I try to be glad I had those memories in the first place.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Trying to break my old patterns is a battle every day. I do not always succeed. Since meeting <name>, Voraxian, and all of you though? I am finding it easier.}}
