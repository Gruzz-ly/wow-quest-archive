==Objectives==
Collect seeds from various [[Lasher]]s and give them to [[Sister of the Garden|Sisters of the Garden]].
*{{item|Garden Seed|s}} delivered to Sisters (12)

==Description==
The [[Primalist]]s' attack left its mark on the [[Emerald Gardens]]. I wish to see it grow and flower once again.

In this part of the garden, we have an overabundance of lashers. Their seeds can be used by the Sisters of the Garden to cultivate vegetation in those damaged glades.

Thin out the lashers to collect their seeds, and then give those seeds to the Sisters. They sometimes struggle to inflict harm on any creature, even when it is in the best interest of the gardens overall.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the seeds?

==Completion==
Thank you. Do not fear, the lashers always grow back at a remarkable rate. Their numbers will rebound quickly.

==Notes==
Defeat any [[lasher]] in the area, including [[Giant Lasher]]s, [[Vigorous Lasher]]s, and [[Sprouting Lasher]]s for their [[Garden Seed]]. Collect any amount (including all twelve), then find a [[Sister of the Garden]] to turn them all in at once:
*It's a beautiful day in the garden.
*It's so nice to have so much activity in the garden again!
*These lashers are such trouble!
*Do you have something for me?

*{{text|say|Sister of the Garden|Thank you!}}
*{{Text|say|Sister of the Garden|Time to plant things!}}

However, [[Cormillia]] has been frozen to death in the center of the quest area:
:<Shards of fresh, spiked ice are already melting from the dryad's wounds.>

Return to Merithra and Rymek:
:{{text|say|Rymek|It must be difficult at times to continue your work without your Aspect.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|It is oftimes a heavy burden. But we grow stronger every day. And we are not alone.}}

Merithra has this to say:
:Something strange is happening in the garden. But I do not see any Primalists attacking like they did before.

:Keep an eye out, <name>.

:{{gossip|<Report that you found a dead dryad too.>}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|No... another dryad lost. Have the Primalists breached the gardens again?}}
:{{text|say|Rymek|I will be on the lookout for anything unusual, Lady Merithra. Whoever is responsible will not get away with this.}}
