==Objectives==
Return the excess [[Arcane|Order magic]] to Shalasar's Sophic Vellum.
* Order magic returned to Shalasar's Sophic Vellum.
* [[Resolved Element]] (20)
* [[Shalasar's Sophic Vellum (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
The Order and [[shadowflame]] [[magic]]s are competing with each other. The enchantment will never be able to funnel [[Fyr'alath]]'s power if we can't channel the excess Order magic being forced away from it.

If you can channel the enchantment, your allies can catch any excess Order magic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Attuned Sophic Vellum]]

==Completion==
Hard work, but well worth it. Use this vellum well.

==Progression==
{{Fyr'alath}}
