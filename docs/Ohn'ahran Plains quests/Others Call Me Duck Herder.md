==Objectives==
Feed 4 ducklings and return to [[Gracus]].
*[[Duck]]lings fed (4)

==Description==
My days grow shorter... Still my duties are not done.

The brood should all be by the creek. I leave them there hoping they will grow more independent. Soon they will have to fend for themselves.

Today they will rely on you. Please bring them the food you caught, and then the ducklings to me. Be wary of [[Pilot]], she is always jumping off something.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Be careful of [[Firequackers]].  He will bite your finger.

A surprisingly strong bite for such a young duck.

==Completion==
My beautiful ducklings! You look so strong!

Pilot, come. Play time is over.

<Pilot refuses to leave your side and tries to hide behind your legs. Until Gracus scoops her up.>

Seems she likes you.

==Notes==
The ducklings are [[Moonshine]], [[Firequackers]], [[Bits]], and [[Jet]]. After feeding them, they start following you.
