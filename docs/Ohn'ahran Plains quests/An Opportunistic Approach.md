==Objectives==
Retrieve weapons and slay Nokhud forces at the [[Nokhud Approach]].
*[[Nokhud]] forces slain (10)
*[[Nokhud Armament ]](8)

==Description==
[[Clan Shikaar|The Shikaar]] have formed an offensive line against the Nokhud to the north. While I do not like stooping to scavenging, it is unfortunately a necessary evil for our supplies. Brave the battlefield and return with weapons, and I will reward your efforts.

If you could focus said efforts on the Nokhud side of the line, perhaps the ancestors will judge me less harshly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
Weapons will be the most useful thing - I apologize for asking this of you.

==Completion==
Ancestors forgive me. If I were stronger, we would not need to resort to such a questionable method for resources.

==Notes==
Kill [[Bloodcrazed Warhound]]s, [[Nokhud Harrier]]s, and [[Nokhud Commander]]s.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
