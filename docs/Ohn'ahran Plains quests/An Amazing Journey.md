==Objectives==
Find the missing [[animal]]s.
*[[Sassa]] saved
*[[Zaya]] saved
*[[Suder]] saved

==Description==
A few of [[Clan Aylaag|the clan]]'s pets ended up getting lost along the last journey between camps. They're not hunting animals so I doubt they can take care of themselves properly out there!

Do you think you could go search for them? They may not be hunting partners, but they're important members of the clan regardless!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
Did you find them? Their partners are becoming increasingly concerned.

==Completion==
They all returned before you. Thank the winds!

==Notes==
To rescue Sassa, pick her up and carry her to [[Trader Urtusk]] on the coast.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
