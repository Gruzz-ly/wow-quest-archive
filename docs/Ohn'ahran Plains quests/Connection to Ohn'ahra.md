==Objectives==
Collect 4 River Reeds, 8 Fowl Tailfeathers, and a Salamanther Heart from the river banks.
*[[River Reeds]] (4)
*[[Fowl Tailfeathers]] (8)
*[[Salamanther Heart]]

==Description==
The wind is restless here, <name>. [[Ohn'ahra]] is reaching out. I must answer her call.

I need reagents for my ritual: reeds from the riverbanks, feathers from the tails of [[Duck|mallards]], and the heart of a [[salamanther]]. Gather these materials from the river so that I may heed her voice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Ohn'ahra's song is fleeting. We must work quickly.

==Completion==
Excellent. I will use these materials to interpret her song.

==Notes==
[[River Reeds]] grow along the edges of the water. [[Fowl Tailfeathers]] are obtained by interacting with [[Jadethroat Mallard]]s to pluck them (they cannot be looted from dead Mallards). This is successful most of the time, but sometimes the Mallard instead becomes hostile and attacks. [[Salamanther Heart]] is a relatively rare drop from [[Mudwalker Salamanther]]s and normally takes a number of kills to obtain.

==Progression==
{{Into the Plains}}
