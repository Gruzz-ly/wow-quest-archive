[[File:The Search for Bovan Windtotem.jpg|thumb|A Bloody Axe and a dead Pack Kodo]]

==Objectives==
Search the surrounding area for the missing [[tauren]].
* [[Bloody Axe]] found {{co|71.4|44.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
* [[Unique Headdress]] found {{co|72.8|50.9|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
* [[Tauren Necklace]] found {{co|74.5|53.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
* [[Windtotem Survivor]]s found (3) {{co|71.9|47.7|Ohn'ahran Plains}} {{co|74.8|48.3|Ohn'ahran Plains}} {{co|76.5|51.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
According to [[Injured Windtotem Survivor|this survivor]], the [[centaur]] took them completely by surprise. [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]] led many of the [[brave]]s against the centaur, hoping to buy time for the others to escape.

He succeeded, but Bovan and most of the braves have not returned. We must find him, <name>.

I need you to search the surrounding area. If you find survivors, tell them to make their way back here.

If you find fallen tauren... take something recognizable to bring back to their families.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
I have spoken to the survivors, and no one has seen Bovan since the battle.

This headdress you found on the deceased tauren does not belong to him, so he is either still missing... or captured.

<Baine's expression hardens.>

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Since I'm not particularly welcome at the moment, I think I'll go help <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|You will go nowhere centaur!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|You will explain everything you know about this situation. And if I find you are lying to me, I want you close at hand.}}

[[File:Bloody Axe.jpg|thumb|Bloody Axe]]
The relevant items and objects are marked on the map. The [[Bloody Axe]] is next to a [[Pack Kodo (Ohn'ahran Plains)|dead Pack Kodo]] in the north of the quest area:
:<This distinctive looking axe appears to be tauren in origin.

:A flower is engraved on the hilt. The handle itself is covered in blood, but the axe head is clean.

:It seems whoever wielded this axe lost their fight.>

:{{gossip|<Collect the axe.>}}

[[File:Unidentified Tauren.jpg|thumb|Unidentified Tauren]]
A dead [[Unidentified Tauren]]<!-- later identified as Karuul --> is immediately to the southeast of the Watering Hole itself:
:<This tauren fell in battle. Given the number of wounds on the body, he clearly fought to the bitter end.

:The tauren is wearing a unique headdress. The other tauren might be able to identify their deceased kin with it.>

:{{gossip|<Collect the headdress.>}}

[[File:Discarded Necklace.jpg|thumb|upright|Tauren Necklace]]
A [[Discarded Necklace]] lies on the ground at the southeastern corner of the quest area, not far from the river:
:<A tauren necklace lies in the dirt next to this hut. The cord is severed, as if it was snapped off.

:Tauren and centaur hoofprints lead from here to the nearby river. It is likely these tauren were captured and moved somewhere else.>

:{{gossip|<Collect the necklace.>}}

[[File:Windtotem Survivor.jpg|thumb|Northwestern Windtotem survivor]]
The northwestern [[Windtotem Survivor]] is lying on the ground:
:Ugh... who is there?

:<This brave is hurt but alive. He should be able to make it back on his own.>

:{{gossip|<Tell the brave how to get back to Baine.>}}
:{{text|say|Windtotem Survivor|The centaur told us they were friends... we fell for their lies once again...}}

[[File:Windtotem Survivor northeast.jpg|thumb|Northeastern Windtotem survivor]]
The northeastern survivor is sitting next to a fallen tree and a dead [[Nokhud Raider]]:
:Have we not suffered enough at the hands of the centaur?

:<The brave is covered in blood but has no serious injuries.>

:{{gossip|<Tell the brave how to get back to Baine.>}}
:{{text|say|Windtotem Survivor|Bovan's visions led us to this forsaken place. Why?}}

[[File:Windtotem Survivor southeast.jpg|thumb|Southeastern Windtotem survivor]]
The southeastern survivor is cowering in fear in some bushes behind a rock near a big bloodstain:
:<The brave has no injuries but seems overwhelmed. He keeps whimpering what sounds like a nursery rhyme.>

:If dust shall rise,<br> Above the skies,<br> Run, my children, run...

:By beat of drum,<br> The centaur come,<br> For mercy, they have none...

:When hoofbeats sound,<br> Upon the ground,<br> flee, my children, flee...

:To find the land,<br> Where tauren stand,<br> Do not come back for me...

:{{gossip|<Tell the brave how to get back to Baine.>}}
:{{text|say|Windtotem Survivor|Save us from the centaur, [[Ohn'ahra|Windmother]]! Please!}}

[[File:The Search for Bovan Windtotem - after.jpg|thumb|Survivors gathered and fires put out]]
On return, the fires have been put out and Baine and Tomul are wrapping up a conversation:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Are there any other questions? Or is this little inquisition over?}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Hmph. We will soon discover the truth of all this.}}

Baine has gossip after completing this quest:
:Bovan... my friend, I will find you.
