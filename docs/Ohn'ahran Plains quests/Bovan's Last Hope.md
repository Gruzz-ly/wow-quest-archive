==Objectives==
Find [[Boku]] at the [[Ohn'iri Springs]].

==Description==
If [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]] is not here, [[Clan Nokhud|the Nokhud]] could have taken him anywhere. We might have one last chance to find him, but it's a long shot.

We still have Bovan's necklace. One of [[Clan Ohn'ir|the Ohn'ir]] mystics might be able to use it to help divine his location. I've only heard about this ritual, so I have no idea if it will work.

Go to the Ohn'iri Springs and look for Boku. I'm sure he will help us.

Baine and I will make sure the [[tauren]] we rescued get back safely. We'll meet you at the Ohn'iri Springs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Tomul has filled me in on what you need!

==Notes==
On accept:
:''[[Nawa]] and Baine walk up to Tomul.''
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|It feels different... being back here.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Tomul. Was this your home?}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|It was. Until the Nokhud launched a surprise attack and put it all to the torch. Now my home is gone and my people are scattered across the plains.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I... know how you feel. When I was young, I never had a place to call home. Home was where my people were.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Then perhaps we have more in common than you thought. Come, let us take the tauren... home.}}
:''They exit the tent and run southwest.''

Catch up with Tomul and Boku at the [[Ohn'iri Springs]]:
:{{text|say|Windsage Boku|Of course! I'm sure we can find your missing friend.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|You know, ever since you were promoted, you've become far too optimistic for my taste.}}
