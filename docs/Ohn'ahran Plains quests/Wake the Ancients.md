==Objectives==
Use [[Merithra]]'s Borrowed Breath to wake Ancient Guardians in the [[Emerald Gardens]].
*[[Quercus]] woken {{co|30.1|52.9|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Dalicus]] woken {{co|28.6|51.8|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Asercus]] woken {{co|30.1|50.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Borrowed Breath]] (provided)

==Description==
There are many ways to keep the gardens safe, and we have allies to help us.

A few [[Ancient]]s rest dormant in these glades. They are giant trees sworn to defend the forest and the creatures within. 

Use this fragment of my breath to wake them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you awakened the Ancients?

==Completion==
One of the ancients was slain? By frost?

This does not bode well. We must be alert. The [[Primalists]] could be preparing another assault on the garden.
