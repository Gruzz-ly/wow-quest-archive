==Objectives==
Speak to [[Initiate Radiya]] at [[Ohn'iri Springs]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Description==
I received an interesting letter from Ohn'iri Springs.

As for the letter's contents, it details, quote, horrid imprisonment, controlling mentors, and extreme boredom. It is formally signed by Initiate Radiya. There's also a sketch of an [[eagle]]... kicking a [[centaur]] named [[Ohn Meluun|Meluun]] off a cliff.

Well. I suppose this is a call for help, if you are so inclined to see for yourself. To be frank, I think Radiya is probably okay. She sends me such letters often.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Who are you? [[Windsage Ordven|Ordven]] sent you? He actually reads my letters?!

<Radiya snorts with surprise and pleasure.> Thank Ohn'ara!

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|[[Windsage Togotseng]]|I'm sure she just wants a change of scenery now and then. You know how restless she can be.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Meluun|Learning to be idle is a great skill. My word is final, Togotseng. She is to focus on her studies, and any excursions must be approved by me.}}
