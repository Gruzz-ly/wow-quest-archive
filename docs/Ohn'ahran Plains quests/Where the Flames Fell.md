==Objectives==
Meet [[Sabellian]] and [[Wrathion]] in [[Cascades Canyon]].

==Description==
[[Dragon Aspects|The Aspects]] have requested our help. As protectors of [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]] and [[dragon|dragonkind]], we are more than willing.

I must locate [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] and ask her to join. I believe I can recruit her to our cause as long as we remain committed to hers against the [[Sundered Flame]] in the future.

Meet Sabellian and Wrathion at the site of the Incarnates' devastation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,375 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Perfect timing, <name>!

It would seem my efforts to investigate the area are not welcome. Would you mind helping me straighten out this situation?

==Notes==
On accept:
:''The three black dragons start walking south.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I must recruit Emberthal to our quest. Wait for me at the entrance.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Why? Surely we four are more than enough.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I made a promise to her. That we would assist each other in our pursuits.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Then make haste, Ebyssian. We cannot let this Incarnate slip through our grasp.}}
:''They shift to their dragon forms and fly off.''

Fly to the [[Cascades Canyon]] between [[Thaldraszus]] and [[Ohn'ahran Plains]]. There, Wrathion is being held at spearpoint by [[Khasar]], [[Baba]], and [[Raidon]] overlooking a still-burning pile of ash:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|We only want to examine that pile of ash, friend. No harm intended.}}
:''Sabellian flies in and shifts to his visage form, looking at [[Iridikron's Gambit]].
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Stop wasting time, Wrathion. The giant hole bored through bedrock should be our primary concern while Ebyssian forces us to wait.}}

==Progression==
{{Underground 1}}
