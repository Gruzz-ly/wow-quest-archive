==Objectives==
Kill 8 Stormtouched Beasts in [[Sagecrest Pines]].
*Stormtouched beasts (8)

==Description==
If you're venturing out into the pines, please slay any stormtouched animals. This is not easy for me to ask, but they're clearly in pain, unable to be helped, and spreading the aggression.

I suspect it's the [[primalists]]' doing. It must be coming from their outpost nearby, where I saw a strange magical altar at work.

I'm going to go investigate again. If I'm not back by the time you return, can brief you on additional tasks. We're grateful for any help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
I'd be out there with you if my leg wasn't hurt.

==Completion==
The pines should be a little safer now.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Sentinel Olekk|Thanks, <name>. I'll be back soon, hopefully with more information about the primalist outpost. Stay sharp.}}

Kill [[Craggy Stag]]s, [[Insatiable Vulture]]s, [[Pinehoof Doe]]s, and [[Rumbling Blackpaw]]s.

==Progression==
