==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Frenzied Grovetalon.jpg||This bird of prey... is it preying on more than it ought?}}
Slay the Frenzied Grovetalon
*[[Frenzied Grovetalon]] slain {{co|27.9|45.2|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
I have noticed that these gardens have rather diverse defenses, from the [[dragon]]s to the [[drakonid]] and [[ancient]]s... and even the wildlife!

But there is one defender that seems to have become rather too zealous in its protectiveness. It even tried to swoop at me when I arrived!

And since we know something has been killing within these groves, it cannot hurt to be too cautious.

Unfortunately, this creature must be slain before it can do more damage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found and put down that overzealous bird?

==Completion==
The gardens are more peaceful already, are they not?

You are quite capable, <race>.

==Notes==
The [[Frenzied Grovetalon]] is circling over the corpses of four [[Arctic Saboteur]]s in the northwest of the quest area, who all have this gossip:
:<This primalist was ripped to shreds by a large bird's talons.>

Curious. Regardless, the quest says to defeat the grovetalon, so defeat it.
