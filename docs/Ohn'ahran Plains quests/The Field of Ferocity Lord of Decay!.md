==Objectives==
Defeat Nightrot.
*[[Nightrot]] slain
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
I tried to get one of those nasty [[gnoll]]s for this gauntlet. Unfortunately, none of my associates know how to speak with them.
 
We did manage to catch one of their freaky creations though. That should serve as a good opponent! Let me know when you want to start the second round!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|52|42|}}
* 11,700 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Well, what are you waiting for?  Speak with Gurgthock to start the round, then defeat the second competitor of the Field of Ferocity.

==Completion==
I'm glad you dealt with that as quickly as you did. The stench was starting to reach the podium here.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Gurgthock
:Are you ready to rumble?

:{{Text|yell|[[Huntmaster Amaa]]|Truly a challenge of the senses. Bring honor to your ancestors, heroes.}}
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|Round two, fight!}}
