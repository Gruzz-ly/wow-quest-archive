==Objectives==
Search [[Nokhudon Hold]] for [[Bovan Windtotem]].
*[[Borrowed Potion of Invisibility]] used (Optional)
*[[Prisoner Transfer Notes]] found {{co|35.1|36.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Interrogation Notes]] found {{co|35.0|38.8|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Prisoner Update Notes]] found {{co|36.1|40.8|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
[[File:Prisoner Transfer Notes.jpg|thumb|Prisoner Transfer Notes]]
Time is against us, <name>. We must find Bovan as quickly as possible.

This hold is teeming with [[Clan Nokhud|centaur]]. Our search will go faster if we split up--and it will be easier to slip by the patrols.

Take one of these potions I brought. It should help you go undetected, but beware of the Nokhud [[Bakar|wardogs]]. If [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]] spoke correctly, they will sniff you out.

Search the area for Bovan. If you find him, get him out. Do not wait for me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I was too late...

==Completion==
I was too late...

==Notes==
[[File:Interrogation Notes.jpg|thumb|The Interrogation Notes situation]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Here is the potion. Remember, the Nokhud wardogs can sniff you out. Be careful, <name>.}}
:''Baine quaffs a potion then stealths forward into the hold.''

Consider using the provided [[Borrowed Potion of Invisibility]] to gain an untimed invisibility buff:
:{{Abilities|Borrowed Potion of Invisibility|An invisibility potion that can help you stay undetected in Nokhudon Hold. Ineffective against Nokhud Wardogs.|id=400915|icon=spell_magic_lesserinvisibilty}}

As warned, the [[Nokhud Wardog]]s have truesight, and their detection radius is marked on the ground. Steer clear to reach the [[Prisoner Transfer Notes]] on the ground out in the open with [[Huntmaster Kroshk]] patrolling nearby. Interact with them, which will not break the invisibility:
:Three prisoners were brought from the Shikaar Highlands for interrogation.
:They may hold information about enemy movements and plans.
:<The rest of the report is missing. It looks to have been bitten off by a dog of some sort.>

The [[Interrogation Notes]] are in the center of the main clearing, guarded by patrols of [[Nokhud Huntmaster|huntmasters]], [[Nokhud Sentry|sentries]], and [[Nokhud Wardog|wardog]]s orbiting around the notes. Interact with the notes:
:Have yet to gain any useful information from the prisoners.
:Two died under interrogation. One yet lives.
:<The rest of the report is covered in mud and illegible.>

A veritable minefield of wardogs lies between the interrogation notes and the [[Prisoner Update Notes]] to the southwest:
:<The first half of this report is illegible.>
:...Jamoku wishes to oversee his interrogation personally. 
:He will talk, or he will die.

Head southwest to find [[Baine Bloodhoof]] overlooking the corpse of [[Bovan Windtotem]]. Entering the circle will dispel the invisibility, so make sure the patrolling [[Water Elemental (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Water Elemental]], [[Primalist Flowbreaker]], and [[Primalist Iceslinger]] aren't close!

On complete, a [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|X5RugRCGkVQ}}
:''Baine is on one knee looking at Bovan's corpse.''
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|When I was young... the centaur took me.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|It was Bovan who found me, and aided in my rescue.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Without him, I never would have...}}
:''The weather shifts - a downpour starts.''
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|It was my turn to rescue him.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|And they have robbed me of it.}}
:''Baine smashes his left hand on the ground in anger, then gets to his feet and walks a few steps away.''
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|<Agonized cry of loss and fury>}}
:''He also lets off a [[War Stomp]] and starts walking past the player as he pulls his weapon from his back.''
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|They will never hurt anyone again.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, the phase changes. It's storming and different hostiles are present.
