==Objectives==
Collect the pages of [[Reclaimer Makko|Makko]]'s Journal from [[gorloc]]s in [[Szar Skeleth]].
*Pages Recovered (6)
*Return the journal pages to [[Toddy Whiskers]] outside of Szar Skeleth.
*[[Makko's Journal - Page One]] (provided)

==Description==
The gorloc clutches a journal, its cover marred by moisture and lack of care. The faded symbol of the [[Sundered Flame]] peeks proudly from behind the tears and discoloration.

If you find the missing pages, perhaps you can gain insight into Reclaimer Makko and the madness that has fractured her mind.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Makko's Complete Journal]]

==Progress==
A journal? Written by who?

==Completion==
Thanks, but you can keep it.

<[[Toddy Whiskers|Toddy]] rolls her eyes.>

And I thought the Sundered Flame were crazy before...

==Notes==
Loot the following pages from the gorlocs at the ruins:
*[[Makko's Journal - Page Two]]
*[[Makko's Journal - Page Three]]
*[[Makko's Journal - Page Four]]
*[[Makko's Journal - Page Five]]
*[[Makko's Journal - Page Six]]
