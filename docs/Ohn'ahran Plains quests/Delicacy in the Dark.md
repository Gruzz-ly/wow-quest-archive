==Objectives==
Collect 12 river whelks for [[Hadari]].
*[[River Whelk]] (12)

==Description==
Due to the nature of [[Clan Aylaag|our clan]], some resources are in short supply. We do not have the luxury of time to claim the land's [[metal]] resources.

The late [[khan]] established multiple [[Merchant|trade]] connections with a variety of individuals, and I see no reason to discontinue their services.

The nearby bay contains buckets where we catch whelks - they're considered a delicacy for some of our neighbors. Bring a collection back to me for use in trade.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]
*[[Ottuk Hide Sash]]

==Progress==
Take care with the traps, they may contain some more aggressive nuisances.

==Completion==
Ah, this will be helpful.

It is hard for me to rely on outsiders for such a key resource, but I cannot think of an alternate route.

==Notes==
River Whelks are in the river.

==Patch changes==
