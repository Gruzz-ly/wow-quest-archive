[[File:Verbal Archaeology - the view.jpg|thumb|The view of Voraxian and Veritistrasz]]

'''A Difficult Legacy''' concludes the Verbal Archaeology storyline for the [[Zskera Vaults]] during the [[Forbidden Reach storyline]]. After completing the "Medicinal Fungi" optional storyline of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]] at [[Dragonscale Camp]] in [[Zaralek Cavern]], [[Veritistrasz]] will offer [[The Tale of Hraxian]].

==Objectives==
Talk to [[Voraxian]] and [[Veritistrasz]] at [[Rusza'thar Reach]].
* Find out what the Vase is
* Listen to Voraxian and Veritistrasz

==Description==
Let us talk to Veritistrasz about this vase, <name>. 

I want to temper your expectations though. It is just a vase, but you never know. It could be exciting.

Maybe it could point us to a cache of weapons?

==Progress==
It is always a pleasure, <name>.

==Completion==
Thank you for being here, <name>. You have both given me a lot to think about.

I will stay with Veritistrasz for now, but I look forward to when we next meet.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Veritistrasz, <name> found a vase. Is it anything special? It has a [[black dragon]] fighting a [[djaradin]] on it.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Show me... Oh... This vase depicts the last stand of Hraxian, during the final battle with the djaradin elders.}}

Speak with Veritistrasz:
:Helllo{{sic}} <name>, nice to see you again. 
:I went to Valdrakken to find Ebyssian, but it turns out he had already left, so I came here for the view instead. 
:Do you want to stay a while?
*{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} I would like to hear the story of Hraxian.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|It is a sad tale that is worth telling, but not today.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I will need to ready myself if I am to tell it properly.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I... would also like to hear the tale when you are ready to tell it.}}
*{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} Who were the djaradin elders?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Djaradin of unbelievable power. Their mastery over Earth and Fire was incredible, rivalling [[Neltharion]] himself.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|They united the djaradin armies and cut a bloody swath through dragonkind that still echoes in our numbers today.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Eventually, they were defeated by Neltharion. I know not how, the Earth-Warder was ever secretive.}}
*{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} The djaradin elders that were defeated by Neltharion?}} (available if you have heard [[Tarjin the Blind]]'s tales.)
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Yes, I am impressed with your knowledge of draconic history <name>, well done.}}
The last two lines of dialogue are the same as from the default option.
*{{gossip|quest=|Thank you for looking at the vase for us, Veritistrasz.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|A shame though, I was hoping we would find something of power in the vaults.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|This is history. The kind [[Distyia]] would have loved. She would go on about the brush work and glazing. This is... amazing.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|But... I want to help my flight and be a great warrior, as we were in the past.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I am not as strong as the others, I thought I could find something to make the difference.}}

Speak with Voraxian now:
:I will stay here with Veritistrasz, he has some interesting stories.
:I suppose it is a nice view, if you like that sort of thing.
:{{gossip|quest=|Why do you want to be a great warrior?}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|We were monsters in the dark for ten thousand years. I want to show dragonkind we can be useful.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I need to show we can fight for good. That we have changed.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|We need to regain our legacy; we need regain our strength.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Oh Voraxian... Neltharion had so much strength, look where that led him...}}

Back to Veritistrasz:
:{{gossip|quest=|What do you think is the legacy of the [[black dragonflight]]?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Courage, not strength. Before the fall, your flight was known for their courage in all things, not just combat.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|But... What is courage without battle?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Many of the first draconic artists and philosophers were black dragons. They pushed the boundaries of what we knew, what we accepted.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|We are a long-lived race, too often we revert to what is comfortable. Distyia used to always show me new experiences and new ideas. That spark is what we need from you.}}

And to Voraxian:
:{{gossip|quest=|Voraxian you seem troubled, what's wrong?}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|In [[Outland]] we were so focused on fighting, on beating the [[gronn]]. Strength and survival were all that mattered.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I had not dreamed there was more to us than that.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|You... Think this more valuable than being able to fight?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Sometimes fighting can protect your friends, your family, your way of life.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Changing your way of life though, that requires courageous ideas, challenging the normal everyone has accepted.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Both have value, it is not one or the other.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I... Thank you. Both of you. I feel like I have had a weight lifted from my shoulders.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Could... I stay here and listen to a few more tales?}}
:{{text|emote|Veritistrasz smiles.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I would like that.}}

On complete, Veritistrasz has a new gossip option:
:{{gossip|<Decide to stay a while.>}}

This will plant the player between Voraxian and Veritistrasz. Use the "Cancel" button or click off the "Stay a While" buff to exit. Veritistrasz can now be asked to tell older tales:
:{{gossip|<Ask to listen to older tales.>}}
:Certainly, which would you like to listen to?
*{{gossip|The Egg Tending Device.}}
:''Repeats the script from [[Verbal Archaeology]].''
*{{gossip|The Lish Llrath training ball.}}
:''Repeats the script from [[Second Time Is The Charm]].''
*{{gossip|When we brought the vase to you.}}
:''Repeats the "on accept" and "thank you for looking at the vase" gossip options of this quest.''
*{{gossip|The legacy of the black dragonflight.}}
:''Repeats the "Why do you want to be a great warrior?" and "What do you think is the legacy of the black dragonflight" scripts.''
*{{gossip|Voraxian's revelations.}}
:''Repeats the "Voraxian you seem troubled, what's wrong?" script.''
