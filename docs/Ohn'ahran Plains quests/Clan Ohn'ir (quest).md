'''Clan Ohn'ir''' is one of the three opening quests for the "Maruukai" chapter of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]]. The other two are [[Clan Nokhud (quest)]] and [[Clan Teerai (quest)]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Ohn Seshteng]] at the mystic pools.

==Description==
<As Sansok Khan signs, [[Okir]] vocalizes for her.>

The mystics of our lands, like Ohn Seshteng, belong to [[Clan Ohn'ir]]. The clan is not made up of families, but rather of [[centaur]] from across the plains with an innate connection to [[Ohn'ahra]]. They spend their lives building that connection and honing their skills. Eventually, they receive assignments to advise different clans and protect our lands.

Ohn Seshteng went to speak with her [[khan]] about the omen she received. Join her to learn about the Ohn'ir.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is good to be back with my clan.

==Notes==
Seshteng waits with [[Tigari Khan]] in the tent at the north end of the mystic pools. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|A cold front precedes the storm. The chill seeps into my bones.}}
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|We cannot stop the wind, Seshteng, nor reverse its course. We must be guided by it, even into tumult.}}

==Progression==
{{Maruukai}}
