Speak to [[Sentinel Olekk]] at [[Pinewood Post]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Description==
There's been a [[primalist]] attack in the [[Shikaar Highlands]].

If you have information or think you can help, head over to Pinewood Post and look for Olekk. Tell him I sent you. <Tirren chuckles.> I sure hope the dusty hoofer remembers me.

Keep to the roads, <name>. The plains are not as peaceful since all this change arrived.

Tirren? He's still hoofing around, is he?

Thank you for coming. We can use all the help we can get.
