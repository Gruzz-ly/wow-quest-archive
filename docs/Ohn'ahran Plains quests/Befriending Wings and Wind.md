'''Befriending Wings and Wind''' becomes available at Renown level 14 with the [[Maruuk Centaur]].

==Completion==
You're just in time, dragonrider. I have a special acquisition from the [[Clan Ohn'ir|Ohn'ir]].

With our [[clan]]s spread so far apart, we often rely on [[ohuna]] to relay critical messages. This will allow you to call upon our eagle mail carriers wherever you go. They're not the swiftest, but they are reliable.

Normally I would require a trade, but this is too important a boon. You may have need of it.

==Rewards==
