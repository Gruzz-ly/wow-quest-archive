'''Get on the Horn''' becomes available after reaching Renown 23 with the [[Maruuk Centaur]].

==Completion==
Friend, the [[Shikaar]] have asked me to offer you their ritual hunting horns. They insisted the horns were only for you, and that I was not to use them.

Hmph! I'm an excellent [[hunter]]. Perhaps the best they will ever see! They just don't know it yet.

<Huseng laughs.>

So here you are. My stock is open to you, should you want any others.
