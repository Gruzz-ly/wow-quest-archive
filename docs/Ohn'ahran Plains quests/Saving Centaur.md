==Description==
The treachery of the [[Nokhud]] knows no limits! Only craftsmen live in the village of Daruukhan. They stood no chance against the raiders.

We desperately need your help, <name>. The Nokhud are still nearby, and we must tend to the wounded!

Search the village, and carry any survivors you find to me. We will triage and stabilize who we can!

* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
We're overwhelmed here! Please, save anyone you can!

==Completion==
That... that seems to be everyone!

Taivan! That was incredible! I had no idea he had this in him!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Windsage Duusalkhi]]|[[Chimei]]? Chimei! Can you hear me?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Teerai Rescuer]]|I only see minor injuries, but they seem to be in shock. What happened?}}
:{{Text|say|Windsage Duusalkhi|I'm so sorry, Chimei. I wasn't able to save them...}}

Enter the village and click on [[Heavy Beam]]s on the injured centaur, which causes Taivan to appear and drag the beam away.

:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|What is that howling sound?}}
:{{Text|say|Taivan|Aroooooo!}}
:{{Text|say|Healer Selbekh|Taivan?! You were supposed to stay put!}}

Once done, click on the centaur, and Taivan drags them back to the healers.

When you have the Taivan is Moving debuff, you'll have to wait. If he is missing, speak to Selbekh:
:How could the Nokhud do this?! The Khanam Matra will hear of this!

:{{Gossip|Can you call Taivan for me?}}
