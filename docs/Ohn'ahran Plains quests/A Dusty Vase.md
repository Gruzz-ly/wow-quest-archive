Bring the Dusty Vase to [[Voraxian]] in [[Rusza'thar Reach]].

==Description==
<You have found a vase. It appears to represent a [[black dragon]] fighting what could be a [[djaradin]]. It could be something Voraxian is interested in.>

You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Voraxian holds the vase up to eye level and squints at the carvings.>

Hmm, yes, I think you are right <name>. It does look like a djaradin. 

It is a vase though. Unlikely to be too exciting. Do not get your hopes up.
