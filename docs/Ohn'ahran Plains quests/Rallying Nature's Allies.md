'''Rallying Nature's Allies''' begins the second half of the Renown 19 chapter of the [[Valdrakken Accord]] campaign.

==Objectives==
Muster the [[druid]]s and gather the empowered anchors in [[Shady Sanctuary]].
*Speak to [[Aronus]] For a Lift to Shady Sanctuary (Optional) {{co|22.0|50.3|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Infused Anchor]]s collected (3) {{co|30.5|56.8|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Speak to [[Koda Steelclaw]] {{co|29.3|55.9|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Speak to [[Scout Tomul]] {{co|30.0|58.2|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Speak to [[Hamuul Runetotem]]
*Meet [[Somnikus]] in Shady Sanctuary.

==Description==
We cannot give into despair now. We must push forward. We must think of another way through the barrier.

First, we need our allies. Countless [[elemental]]s summoned by [[Rymek]] are pouring through the portal. We will need an army that can move in [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] like we can, or one that can be brought in easily.

Rally the druids and centaur in Shady Sanctuary. It is time to call upon their oaths to preserve the grove.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are you ready to cross to [[Ardenweald]]?

==Completion==
I will go with you into Ardenweald. I will tell [[Ysera]] that we need her back, and we know a way to do it.

I should be the one who makes this sacrifice. I've lived a long life. I never wanted to live longer than my son. This way, I can atone for Rymek's betrayal and bring back our Aspect.

Are you with me?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Merithra|A small hope remains. There is more than one way into the Dream. Our way in [[Life]] is closed, but from [[Death]]...}}
:{{text|say|Somnikus|You mean the theory [[Gerithus]] had? Could we do it? Could we bring Ysera back, so she could vanquish them all?}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Yes, but the price will be great. Someone must take her place in Ardenweald.}}
:{{text|say|Somnikus|Then I should be the one to go. I will tell Ysera. Perhaps I'll join my son in the realms of Death.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|I will remain. And Somnikus, when you see my mother, tell her... tell her that we will be ready when she returns.}}

Merithra has new gossip:
:I swore that I would keep it safe. And my worst fears have come to pass.

:{{gossip|What's the plan again?}}
::Rymek and his followers have cut us off from entering Ancient Bough. We cannot reach it from [[Azeroth]] or from the Dream. But in the middle of the grove, there is a portal. Perhaps that could serve as a back door.

::There is another way into the Emerald Dream: traveling through the [[Shadowlands]]. Specifically, through Ardenweald.

::If my mother can travel through the Dream and enter Ancient Bough from the other side, then the way can also be opened for us, so we can follow Rymek.

::We have to try.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

[[Aronus]], somehow not frozen despite being inside the ice block of a nearby guard, offers to fly players to the Shady Sanctuary:
:Care for a lift?

:{{gossip|Take me up to Shady Sanctuary.}}

Take the ferry, or not, then chat with three druids. [[Koda Steelclaw]], [[Arthur Tradewind]], [[Lyessa Bloomwatcher]], [[Celestine of the Harvest]], [[Thisalee Crow]], and [[Zen'kiki]] are in the vicinity of Aronus:
:To see a grove as ancient as this, so near the heart of the green dragons, it is an honor to be present.

:{{gossip|<Rally to join the fight at Ancient Bough.>}}
:{{text|say|Lyessa Bloomwatcher|We go to the defense of the Dream.}}
:{{text|say|Koda Steelclaw|We will go at once. Good luck.}}

Lyessa also has gossip before leaving:
:A great power rests somewhere just out of sight here. It is both calming and wondrous.

Just southeast, near some of the vendors, are the three infused anchors. Pick them up, then head south to find [[Scout Tomul]] not far from the flight master:
:We swore an oath to the dragons that we'd help them protect their groves, and we're ready to do just that.

:{{gossip|<Rally to join the fight at Ancient Bough.>}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|I'll alert the khans! We will be there to uphold our pledge!}}
:''Tomul runs off.''

Southeast, inside the [[Greenscale Inn]], [[Hamuul Runetotem|Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem]], [[Zen'Aliri]], and [[Bashana Runetotem]] are having a conversation. Speak with Hamuul:
:Nature flourishes here. But we must always be ready to defend it.

:{{gossip|<Rally to join the fight at Ancient Bough.>}}

:{{text|say|Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem|Merithra will have our might at her back!}}

They run out, alongside [[Wardruid Loti]] and [[Zen'tabra]], take to their flight forms, and fly off.
