==Objectives==
Kill the Storm Extractors and rescue Lizi the Thunderspine in [[Kaighan Camp]].
*[[Storm Extractor]] slain
*[[Lizi|Lizi the Thunderspine]] soothed

==Description==
It's you! Thank [[Ohn'ahra]]. I was pretending to be hurt to fool the next brute who dared come in here. Ugh--the hoof lickers put some binding spell on me. I'll figure it out.

They've got Lizi in the cave. Please save her. I'll figure out how to free myself.

Do what you have to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Anyone whose{{sic}} laid a hoof on Lizi will pay!

==Completion==
<[[Initiate Radiya|Radiya]] is unusually quiet and trembling slightly as she looks upon the tortured beast.>

==Notes==
Kill the extractors in the cave. Once done, Lizi escapes outside the camp. Interact with her:
:<Lizi is exhausted from being subject to storm extraction. Her large glassy eye fixates on you, and her body is tense and slightly hunched. She clearly does not trust your presence yet.>

:<Then... Lizi noses at your pack where you have an extra bushfruit.>

:{{Gossip|<Gently offer the bushfruit.>}}

As Lizi recuperates, Radiya runs toward you.

;Lizi's gossip healing
:<Lizi looks more settled. She remains interested in your pack.>

==Progression==
{{Initiate's Day Out}}
