'''Renewal of Vows''' concludes "Bonds Renewed", the final chapter of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]].

*[[Shikaar Spear|Sansok Khan's offering]] accepted{{Co|22.28|50.89|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Ohuna Feather|Tigari Khan's offering]] accepted{{Co|22.37|51.05|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Horn of the Khanam Matra|Khanam Matra]]'s offering accepted{{Co|22.34|50.96|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Everblooming Soil|Merithra's offering]] given{{Co|22.15|51|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
Centuries ago, I made a vow of friendship and cooperation with the first [[centaur]]. Although much has changed, I feel it is time for us to renew that vow again.

A recitation was composed to help future generations of centaur remember their bond with the [[green dragonflight]]. Each verse must be answered with an offering from the [[khan]]s. I hope the centaur can still remember the original meanings.

The choice of gift is critical. Choose the right offering, and our allegiance is bound.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Emerald Shroud of Loyalty]]
*[[Renewed Proto-Drake: Curled Horns]]
* {{cost|78|63}}
* 14,050 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The recitation is as follows:

From [[Clan Shikaar|the hunters]] who value skill above all, a rite of passage: a first.

From [[Clan Ohn'ir|the mystics]] who commune with [[Ohn'ahra|the wind]], her lightest touch: a lift.

From [[Clan Teerai|the descendants]] of [[Teera|the matriarch]], a drop of unbroken progeny: a line.

==Completion==
Now that our bonds are renewed, nothing can stand in our way. By wind and wing, so be it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Merithra|From the hunters who value skill above all, a rite of passage. A first.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|From the mystics who commune with the wind, her lightest touch. A lift.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|From the descendants of the matriarch, a drop of unbroken progeny. An ancient line, unforgotten.}}

The player has to suggest what each khan should give as an offering, from three possible options. Only one option is correct, but there is no penalty for picking an incorrect option; that option will simply disappear from the dialogue window, and the player can pick a new one. The correct option is marked with '''bold type''' below.

[[File:Shikaar Spear.jpg|thumb|upright|Sansok Khan's offering: [[Shikaar Spear]]]]
Talk to Sansok:
:<Sansok frowns, deep in thought.>

:{{Gossip|'''<Suggest a trophy from her first hunt.>'''}}
::{{Text|say|Okir|Yes, that makes sense. After their first hunt, a young hunter of [[Clan Shikaar|our clan]] receives a ceremonial spear. Take mine.}}
:{{Gossip|<Suggest she offer Okir.>}}
::{{Text|say|Okir|Absolutely not! Try again.}}
:{{Gossip|<Suggest she offer her first kill.>}}
::{{Text|say|Okir|My first kill was quite some time ago. Nothing of it remains.}}

Upon picking the first option, Sansok holds out a [[Shikaar Spear]]. Interact with it to pick it up, then carry it to Merithra:
:Do you have something for me?

:{{Gossip|Here is the weapon Sansok Khan earned after her first hunt.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|This spear is proof of your skill. I accept this offering.}}

[[File:Ohuna Feather.jpg|thumb|upright|Tigari Khan's offering: [[Ohuna Feather]]]]
Talk to Tigari:
:With [[Ohn'ahra]] in captivity, I wonder what [[Clan Ohn'ir|our clan]] has to offer the dragons.

:{{Gossip|<Suggest she offer the wind.>}}
::{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|I like your enthusiasm, but I do not think that is right.}}
:{{Gossip|<Suggest she offer a song.>}}
::{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|I do not think it is that sort of verse. We should think of something else.}}
:{{Gossip|'''<Suggest she offer an eagle feather.>'''}}
::{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|As all [[ohuna]] are the offspring of Ohn'ahra, this feather should suffice.}}

Upon picking the third option, Tigari holds out an [[Ohuna Feather]]. Carry it to Merithra as well:
:Do you have something for me?

:{{Gossip|Here is a feather from Ohn'ahra, lifted upon the wind.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Ohn'ahra's spirit blesses us all. I accept your offering.}}

[[File:Horn of the Khanam Matra.jpg|thumb|upright|The Khanam Matra's offering: [[Horn of the Khanam Matra]]]]
Talk to Sarest:
:Ancestors guide us. We must show Merithra we can be trusted to uphold our vow.

:{{Gossip|<Suggest she offer a child.>}}
::{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Tempting, but no. Perhaps when they were ill-tempered young babes, I could have been swayed.}}
:{{Gossip|<Suggest she offer a verse.>}}
::{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|That does not make sense to me. Perhaps something else?}}
:{{Gossip|'''<Suggest she offer blood.>'''}}
::{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|A bloodline... I have an idea.}}
::{{Text|emote|The Khanam Matra draws a blade across her palm, allowing a few drops of her blood to fall into a cup.}}
::{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Here, take this.}}

Upon picking the third option, Sarest is shown equipping a dagger and cutting her hand before holding out the [[Horn of the Khanam Matra]]. Carry it to Merithra as well:
:Do you have something for me?

:{{Gossip|Here is proof of the unbroken lineage of [[Clan Teerai]], direct descendants of the centaur [[Teera]].}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|I remember Teera well. You are... so much like her. I accept your offering.}}

[[File:Everblooming Soil.jpg|thumb|upright|Merithra's offering: [[Everblooming Soil]]]]
Merithra then holds out a bowl of [[Everblooming Soil]]. Interact with it and carry it to Sarest:
:Ancestors guide us. We must show Merithra we can be trusted to uphold our vow.

:{{Gossip|Please accept Merithra's gift to the centaur clans.}}

A cutscene plays.
{{#ev:youtube|QFnv9p2JZrc}}
:''With the Everblooming Soil placed on the ground next to her, Sarest steps forward, while Merithra stands in front of the Oathstone holding the Horn of the Khanam Matra. During the entire scene, Sansok looks at Okir, who translates for her.''
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|I, the Khanam Matra Sarest, accept this gift to honor the ancient oath made by our most sacred ancestor.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|All centaur under Ohn'ahra's wings will aid the green dragonflight in times of need.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|And I, Merithra, daughter of [[Ysera]], accept this gift to honor my oath to your ancestor Teera.}}
:''Sarest inclines her head.''
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Together, dragons and centaur will protect the Ohn'ahran Plains.}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Should the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]] be threatened again, know that the [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]] will fight beside you.}}
:''Sansok salutes and Tigari inclines her head.''
:{{Text|say|Merithra|The bond that united us in ages past has been renewed.}}
:''Merithra turns around to look up at the Emerald Oathstone.''
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Let this oathstone serve as a symbol of our covenant.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|I vow to protect the Emerald Dream, and the green dragonflight, with my life.}}
:''The oathstone reawakens, shooting a beam of green energy into the sky. Sarest, Tigari, Sansok, and Okir bow.''

Completing this quest concludes the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]] and rewards [[Ohn'a'Roll]]. Merithra offers [[Into the Azure]] to begin the [[Azure Span storyline]], while Sarest offers the optional dungeon quest [[The Nokhud Offensive: The Wind Belongs to the Sky]].   Back in [[Emerald Gardens]], [[The Lonely Scout]] becomes available, given by [[Scout Santuun]].
