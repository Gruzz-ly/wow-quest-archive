==Objectives==
Seek out [[Shalasar Glimmerdusk]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Description==
I know of a [[sage]] who can help temper [[Fyr'alath]]. Shalasar Glimmerdusk is an expert in intellectual matters, often pondering theories for controlling volatile [[magic]]s. Few understand sophic matters as well as she does.

Seek her guidance in managing [[shadowflame]]. I suspect her solution may include a sprinkle of Chromatic Dust!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, yes! Thank you for making the journey here. 

Others warned me not to isolate myself from academia, but I knew being sequestered in this remote natural locale would come in handy someday.

==Progression==
{{Fyr'alath}}

==Patch changes==
