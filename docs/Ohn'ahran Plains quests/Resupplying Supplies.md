==Objectives==
Collect 40 Fresh Plains Meat from the area surrounding [[Toghusuq Village]].
*[[Fresh Plains Meat]] (40)

==Description==
The [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] have been striking at outsiders crossing into the plains. This is no doubt their handiwork.

This survivor says that most of their food supplies were destroyed in the ambush. We should try to help out.

Let's collect meat from the plentiful game around the [[Watering Hole]]. That should be enough to cover their immediate needs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How much have you collected?

==Completion==
Good, this should be plenty.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Since I'm not particularly welcome at the moment, I think I'll go help <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|You will go nowhere centaur!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|You will explain everything you know about this situation. And if I find you are lying to me, I want you close at hand.}}

Most [[beast]]s in the area drop [[Fresh Plains Meat]], including [[Broadhoof Bull]]s, [[Grazing Broadhoof|Grazing Broadhooves]], [[Horned Plainstomper]]s, [[Mosshair Mammoth]]s, [[Plains Rockfang]]s, [[Rockfang Cub]]s, and [[Young Mosshair]]s.

On return, the fires have been put out and Baine and Tomul are wrapping up a conversation:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Are there any other questions? Or is this little inquisition over?}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Hmph. We will soon discover the truth of all this.}}

==Progression==
{{Baine 10.0.7}}

==Patch changes==
