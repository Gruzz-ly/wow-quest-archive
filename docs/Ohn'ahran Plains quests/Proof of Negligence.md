==Objectives==
Find and then show evidence of the Lilac Ramble's damage to [[Theramus]].
*[[Decayed Flower]]
*[[Injured Cub]]
*[[Pulsating Thorn]]

==Description==
We can't give up. He must understand what's happening out here! If he won't leave the cave, we'll show him directly.

Anything will do, I'm sure. There's so much going wrong, from the corrupted flora to the antagonized wildlife!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
It's terrible to see the grove, and Theramus, in such a state.

==Completion==
You've returned!

==Notes==
;Speaking with the Injured Cub
:<The heavily wounded cub is oddly still. She emits a half whine, half growl as you approach.>

:{{Gossip|<Attempt to pick up the cub.>}}
