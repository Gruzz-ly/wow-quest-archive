==Objectives==
Return to Radiya in Ohn'iri Springs.
*Return to [[Initiate Radiya|Radiya]] in [[Ohn'iri Springs]]

==Description==
This is [[Lizi]]... she's my secret friend. I've been taking care of her since she was rejected by her mother.

This isn't looking good. Whatever they did to her is beyond my knowledge. I have to bring her home. My Ohn may ground me for the rest of time, but Lizi must get help. I am ever grateful to you, <name>. I'm sorry this was more trouble than you signed up for.

If you wouldn't mind one more adventure... please face my Ohn's wrath with me? Meet me back at the springs.
