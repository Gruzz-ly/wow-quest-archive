==Description==
<The shards are smooth and slightly hot to the touch. Lightning sparks deep within their core.>

<The thought of parting with the shard fills you with compulsion to hold the shard close. To keep it forever.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Completion==
<Watu doesn't register your presence. He remains sitting, favoring the injured leg, and has his eyes closed.>

==Progression==
{{Pinewood Post}}
