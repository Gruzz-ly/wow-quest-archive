==Objectives==
Collect Shadowed Dreamleaf from completing objectives in the [[Superbloom]].
* [[Shadowed Dreamleaf]] (200)

==Description==
When [[Fyr'alath]]'s power is at its limit, you will need a grip that can cool itself. It is like standing your ground when a beast charges you: as the battle heats up, you need a way to stay focused.

Various leathers throughout the [[Dragon Isles]] have that cooling property, but I know of something better. Foliage that is routinely exposed to [[shadowflame]] would be the best choice for binding the components together. Let us gather what you need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Prototype Dreamleaf Grip]]

==Progress==
Did you find what we need?

==Completion==
Excellent.

You hunt for something long enough, you will always find it. I am glad we found precisely what you needed.

==Progression==
{{Fyr'alath}}
