|Aylaag Windstone Fragment

==Completion==
Dragonrider! [[Clan Aylaag|The Aylaag]] understand that navigating to their camp can be challenging. And you know them--they welcome anyone who will follow their ways.

One of their nomads dropped off these windstones for you. They are not well-enchanted, but will transport you to the [[Aylaag Camp|Aylaag camp]]. A few times, at least. Should that enchantment fade, they could likely make more!
