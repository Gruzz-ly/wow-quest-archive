==Objectives==
Speak with [[Nirobin]] at his office in [[Thaldraszus]].

==Description==
Perhaps there is more to investigate, but I need time to go over our findings here first.

Our colleague, Nirobin, the one arcane projecting himself into the headquarters, should be ready for your assistance by now. He's got his own office at the [[Algeth'ar Academy|Academy]] in Thaldraszus that he tends to squirrel himself away in.

I'm positive he'll be there... Mostly because he never leaves it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Are you the new recruit?

Since you're late, I simply assumed you had been swallowed up by the outside... like I am in my ever-reoccurring nightmares.

It's nice to meet you in person, I suppose.

==Notes==
Upon approaching Nirobin's office:
