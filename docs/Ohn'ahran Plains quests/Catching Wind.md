==Objectives==
Meet [[Boku]] at [[Windsong Rise]].

==Description==
The [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] are collecting totems. The [[Primalists]] are capturing [[ohuna]]. And [[Ohn'ahra]] is silent.

Whatever the Nokhud plans are, we must foil them. You and Boku must travel to Windsong Rise. Our enemies are likely there already.

Search for Ohn'ahra there. If her children are in danger, she will undoubtedly go to them, and we must help. The Windmother is powerful, but I fear what these Primalists are capable of.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Balakar Khan|Balakar]] and these Primalists have trampled on our most sacred beliefs.

==Notes==
On accept, the [[Wounded Initiate]] and [[Badly Wounded Mystic]]s get to their feet, and Boku gives Tigari a salute.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|By your leave, my khan, I will find Ohn'ahra.}}
:{{Text|say|Tigari Khan|I have faith in you, Boku. We all do.}}

Tigari and the mystics walk down to the road and disappear to the west, while Boku takes the road east and despawns.

During this stage of the questline, Windsong Rise is phased to be engulfed in a thunderstorm—and at the apex of the hill, [[Koroleth]] is holding Ohn'ahra herself captive. Boku waits near the bottom of the rise on the southwest side, in front of a fried [[Stormcaller Initiate]] body. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|This cannot be! Even Balakar would not dare.}}

==Progression==
{{Ohn'ahra's Blessing}}
