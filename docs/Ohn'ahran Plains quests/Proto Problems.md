==Objectives==
Acquire the Locus and defeat the [[Proto-dragon|protodrake]] that protects it.
*[[The Black Locus]]
*[[Hypoxicron]] slain

==Description==
I hold no love for the [[Sundered Flame]], but even I cannot stand idle while they rip themselves apart like this. It is all too familiar.

Whatever this Locus is, it is safer in our hands than in their clutches. Follow the trail of bodies and I suspect we will find it.

Do be careful, <name>. I worry we will find that the nest is not quite as abandoned as it appears.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
I am glad you made it out safely. Do you have the Locus?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

You have been most helpful.
