==Notes==
Enter the den on the northeastern side of the great [[kurgan]] and interact with the [[Offering Basket]]. This causes a vision of [[Rellen, The Learned]] to appear atop the nearby coffin and jump down on the floor, while three ghostly beasts appear at the den's entrance: a [[Primal Shadespinner]], [[Primal Thunderspine]], and [[Primal Slyvern]].
:{{Text|say|Rellen, The Learned|I am Rellen!}}
:{{Text|say|Rellen, The Learned|Plains monsters! The centaur will prevail against you.}}

Interact with the Torch that's appeared on Rellen's right and use the resulting extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Witness Rellen|id=384389|Rellen will learn to use fire.|icon=inv_torch_lit}}

This causes the Primal Shadespinner to rush at Rellen. He kills it with a few swings of the torch.
:{{Text|say|Rellen, The Learned|I set fire to your traps! Begone, into the land's crevices where you belong!}}

Next, interact with the Spear on Rellen's left:
:{{Abilities|Witness Rellen|id=384564|Rellen will learn to use the spear.|icon=ability_monk_spearhand}}

The Primal Thunderspine runs at Rellen. He throws the spear at it, knocking it back and killing it.
:{{Text|say|Rellen, The Learned|I've made a spear from your own scales to penetrate your armor!}}

Finally, interact with the Bow lying next to the Spear.
:{{Abilities|Witness Rellen|id=384588|Rellen will learn to use the bow.|icon=inv_archaeology_70_tauren_stonewoodbow}}

The Primal Slyvern slowly flies toward Rellen, but he raises his bow and kills it with a single shot.
:{{Text|say|Rellen, The Learned|The centaur cannot fly, but we'll stand our ground!}}
:{{Text|say|Rellen, The Learned|Now the centaur are learned. We are your worthy rivals, and you shall share the land with us.}}
