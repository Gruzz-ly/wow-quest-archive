==Objectives==
Search the nearby caves and find Theramus.
*Caves searched (3)
*[[Theramus]] found
*Return to [[Celina Crunchyleaves]].

==Description==
<Race>! Are you here to visit the beautiful [[Lilac Ramble]]? I'm so sorry about its current state. I promise it's not usually this untended!

Theramus, the garden's keeper, was supposed to meet us today and tackle the issues together. He's been struggling with the upkeep lately, so Felina and I are helping out. But we can't do it all.

Would you help us look around for him? Maybe he did forget.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
You found him! It looks like he's really down in the dumps today.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|[[Felina Starrunner]]|Where is he? He was supposed to meet us here.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Celina Crunchyleaves]]|I'm sure he's just running late.}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Celina Crunchyleaves|Wonderful! We'll regroup with you.}}
:''Celina runs into the forest.''
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|I have to warn you that Theramus hasn't been feeling well.}}
:{{Text|say|Felina Starrunner|We don't know what's wrong, but I'm glad you're here.}}
:''Felina follows suit.''

Search the three caves, and Theramus is in the last one. Speak with him:
:<The druid does not acknowledge your presence. His aura is sullen and distant. He gazes at nothing in particular.>

:{{Gossip|Are you Theramus?}}
:{{Text|say|Theramus|Did those dryads send you?}}
:{{Text|say|Theramus|Tell them to leave me alone.}}
