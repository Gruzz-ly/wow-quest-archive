==Objectives==
Heal 6 Wounded Guardians using the provided bandages or your own abilities.
* Allies healed (6)
* [[Enchanted Bandage]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, our forces were not prepared for such an onslaught.

These [[djaradin]] fight with more furor than the forces we have faced in the past. We have wounded behind enemy lines.

If you possess knowledge of how to heal than I ask you employ it. If you do not, we have bandages to aid with the wounded. 

Please help bring our people out of the fire.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Our healers cannot be everywhere at once. Nor will they last long behind enemy lines.

==Completion==
Many have fallen to these invaders who desecrate our sacred plains. Thank you for stemming the tide of death today.

==Notes==
Look for [[Wounded Guardian]]s with the blood marker over their heads, then use player healing abilities or the provided [[Enchanted Bandage]] on them:
*{{Text|say|Wounded Guardian|Be careful. These are not normal djaradin.}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Guardian|I did not see that last spike until it was too late.}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Guardian|My thanks, two foot!}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Guardian|Thank you, two foot!}}

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
