==Notes==
Location: [[Roaring Dragonsprings]], [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

Interact with [[Brackish Hornswog]]s, which gives them the Swabbing debuff.
:{{Text|emote|The hornswog emits a deep thrum as you disturb it.}}
:{{Text|emote|The hornswog warbles in confusion.}}
:{{Text|emote|The hornswog croaks angrily at you.}}

Trying to interact with them again yields:
:{{Text|bossemote|You already swabbed this swog!}}

[[Gargantuan Hornswog]]s are also eligible, but they first become Perturbed, then Riled Up and attack.
