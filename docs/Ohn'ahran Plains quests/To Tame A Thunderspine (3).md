*[[Dragon Isles Supplies]] (150)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[Lizi]]'s doing so much better. She's moving around with ease and consuming everything edible in sight.

I learned today that thunderspines enjoy eating [[fish]]--especially [[piranha]]s! How fascinating! It is how they keep the piranha population in check at home.

Will you go fish some? Mind your fingers!

==Completion==
Those piranhas sure look...crunchy. I'm glad a predator exists for them.

==Notes==
