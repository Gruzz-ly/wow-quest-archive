==Objectives==
Recover the Insight of Tyr.
* [[Reclaimer Makko]] slain {{co|44.6|64.7|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
* [[The Insight of Tyr (item)]] Recovered

==Description==
Did ya see [[Szar Skeleth]] on your way in? It's that ruined tower to the northeast.

We've got a bit of a good news, bad news situation there. The good news is the stone's already been found. Bad news is it was found by the [[Sundered Flame]], specifically a magic-using [[dracthyr]] named Makko. And they're using it to control [[gorloc]]s.

Did I mention the dracthyr's misuse of the stone drove them mad?

Well, good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Turns out gorlocs don't make for good bodyguards, eh? I wonder how dangerous she could've been if she held on to her sanity.

==Completion==
You've got it! Don't worry about me. We should be safe to handle it unless we try to do something crazy. Like mind-controlling little fish monsters.

==Notes==
The minimap points to the inside of the tower, but [[Reclaimer Makko]] tends to wander around the ruins.

Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Reclaimer Makko|Interloper! Crumble beneath the power of my intellect!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Reclaimer Makko|I did not... foresee this.}}

Complete all three forks to continue.
