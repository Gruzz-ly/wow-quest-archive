Interact with [[Kaiana]] at the marked spot on the zone map, and it releases Clue Seekers all over. Go to each blue spot and use the Gain Clue extra action button to fill the bar. Also be on the look out for [[Juicy Clue]]s.

Completing this world quest adds a page to the [[Tome of Archived Isles Research]] at {{co|58.5|36.7|Thaldraszus}} in [[Nirobin]]'s office at [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]]:

{{book|content=Information acquired from the The Riverbed, Ohn'ahran Plains, Dragon Isles, Azeroth:

Data from the Riverbed site suggests a caravan left Maruukai on a diplomatic endeavor led by their Khanam Dochra, or "Favored Daughter."}}

After completing the world quest a second time, the page is filled in with more information:

{{book|content= They traveled to Iskaara territory at the behest of tuskarr leaders where long days of discourse and diplomacy took place at an encampment near Traitor's Rest.}}

After completing the world quest a third time, the page is completed:

{{book|content= The tuskarr requested martial support against an anticipated attack from Neltharion, but the Maruukai were stalwart and stubborn in their stance of passivity. They believed their involvement would only make them enemies of dragonkind.

Fate frowned upon the Dochra's group. As they traveled back to their territory, they were wiped out by a vicious storm.}}
