'''To Tame A Thunderspine''' becomes available after reaching [[Renown]] 9 with the [[Maruuk Centaur]]. You must also have completed the "Initiate's Day Out" questline, which begins with [[A Disgruntled Initiate]] and ends with [[Sneaking In]].

==Objectives==
Collect 20 Fluorescent Fluid from insects around the [[Dragon Isles]] and 150 Dragon Isles Supplies.
*[[Fluorescent Fluid]] (20)
*Collect: [[Dragon Isles Supplies]] (150)

==Description==
I'm so happy that [[Lizi]] is safe and sound with us.

However, her wounds are healing slower than expected. I hope that the [[magic]] inflicted upon her didn't cause permanent damage.

Could you help me gather insect ichor? I know, it sounds gross! It's actually the base of many healing ointments.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you returned with more ichor? I hate to see Lizi still in pain.

==Completion==
I'll go apply it to her wounds right away. It should offer immediate relief.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Initiate Radiya|Lizi! Come. This will soothe you.}}
:{{text|say|Initiate Radiya|There you go, good girl.}}
:''Radiya approaches Lizi, gives her medicine, and Lizi begins Healing.''
