==Objectives==
Unleash the power of the [[Dream Locus]].
*Speak to [[Merithra]]

==Description==
We have fought so hard to reach this point, and only one thing remains. The power in [[Lunedane]] will only respond to someone who can command the [[Emerald Dream]] from within.

I had thought that it could only be my mother, but... I see how she has changed. 

I do not know if that difference is better, but it is real and I must acknowledge that.

Come, let us face this moment together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am the Dreamer.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ysera|It is time, Merithra. Step out from the shadow of my wings and spread your own.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|It has always been you. I am not ready for this.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Few ever think they are, when their time comes. Go, my daughter.}}

Interacting with the Dream Locus:
:<The locus thrums with the shifting power of the Dream.>
:{{gossip|<Witness the restoration.>}}
This plays the same cutscene as if you spoke with Merithra.

Speak with Merithra:
:Since my mother's death at [[Val'sharah]], the [[Green dragonflight|Emerald Flight]] and the Dream have not been the same. I thought that with her return, it would return to as it did before.

:But everything has changed. It is time to accept that and to move forward with the power we have.

:{{gossip|We're ready.}}
An in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|jjvEoeo2nZ4|urlArgs=start=37&end=65}}
:''Merithra walks forward to the Dream Locus and interacts with it. A blast of energy obliterates all of the elementals.''
