==Objectives==
Weaken the portals' defenses.
* [[Primalist Portal]]s weakened (3)

==Description==
The [[Primalists|Primalist]] portals must be destroyed if we are to prevent them from infusing these raw materials with [[elemental]] energy.

Unfortunately, their structures are too heavily warded for any single attack, whether mortal or draconic, to do lasting harm.

Together, though, there is a way.

Take this seed. Use it to weaken their defenses and we be able to strike before they have a chance to react.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +10x [[Flightstones]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]
* +150 reputation with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
We are counting on you, <class>.

==Completion==
Well done. That should put them behind schedule.

==Notes==
Look for Primalist Portals (much like the ones in [[Storm's Fury]]) and interact with them to channel a spell on them as Somnikus uses [[Whirling Surge]] on them to destroy the portals.

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}

==Patch changes==
