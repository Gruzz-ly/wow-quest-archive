Slay Guard Bahir.

*Return to [[Khanam Matra Sarest]].

==Description==
The [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] drool over war stories of our kind's ancient past. In truth they are weak, playacting children. And with one strike of lightning, they have severed their connection to [[Ohn'ahra]].

Well! If they will walk the path of corruption to seek war, then we will indulge them.

Of course, Bahir was left in command to cover his escape. Her blood will soon stain the ground.

==Progress==
<Sarest surveys the battlefield, eyes narrowed.>

==Completion==
Balakar was an easy target for [[Koroleth]]'s corrupting influence.

The storm has arrived.

Bahir waits at the western entrance to the city. On aggro:
