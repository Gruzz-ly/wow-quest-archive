==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Windtotem Captives.
*[[Windtotem Captive]]s freed (6)
*Meet up with [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] and [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]] inside the [[Shikaar Highlands]].

==Description==
[[Scout Tomul|Tomul]] says the attacks on the [[Windtotem tribe|Windtotem]] were carried out by an enemy clan known as the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]].

Just down this road is their closest outpost, and the most likely location where [[tauren]] [[prisoner]]s would be taken.

The task is simple--rescue the captives. We do not know how many there are, or how long they have been here, so we must hurry.

I speak from experience when I say [[centaur]] do not keep their captives for long.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the captives?

==Completion==
We have scoured the camp and saved who we could, but [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]] is not among the captives.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Well then Tomul, lead the way.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|When we fight the Nokhud, remember -- I'm the "good" centaur. Don't hit me!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I... shall do my best.}}
:''They walk off to the northeast.''

Find [[Windtotem Captive]]s in the village:
#{{text|say|Windtotem Captive|The centaur are interrogating us for information! But we don't know anything!}}
#{{text|say|Windtotem Captive|They think we're [[druid]]s, sent to help the [[dragon]]s! I'm no druid, I can't even take care of a plant!}}
#{{text|say|Windtotem Captive|They want to know if we're here to help [[Khanam Matra Sarest|Sarest]]! I don't even know who that is!}}
#{{text|say|Windtotem Captive|They interrogated me about the other centaur! About their strength and defenses!}}
#{{text|say|Windtotem Captive|A [[Primalist]] asked about the [[Emerald Gardens]]! I didn't know anything so they hurt me!}}
#{{text|say|Windtotem Captive|They took Bovan prisoner, but when he said he was the leader, they took him somewhere else!}}

[[File:Joint Rescue Operation.jpg|thumb|[[Scout Tomul]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]] and [[Nawa]]]]
Catch up with Baine, Tomul, and [[Nawa]] in a small tent south of the main village:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Have you seen Bovan? Does he yet live?}}
:{{text|say|Nawa|They took him... I don't know where....}}

Nawa has this to say:
:Our captors have interrogated us about the dragons, the other centaur, why we are here... when Bovan revealed he was the leader, they took him away....

Baine has new gossip too:
:<Baine looks perturbed and anxious.>

:I never wanted to be back in a centaur camp. Too many memories. Too many nightmares.
