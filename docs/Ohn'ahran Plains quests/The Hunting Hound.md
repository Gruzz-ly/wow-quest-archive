==Objectives==
Hunt dangerous beasts with Taivan to prove he is worthy of training.
*Talk to [[Taivan]]
*Hunt dangerous beasts with Taivan (5)

==Description==
Go and hunt the nearby beasts with your giant [[bakar]]. The bigger, the better. I will observe from here, and decide if he is worthy of [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]] training. 

Be warned, I will only accept the best.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Go and hunt the nearby beasts with your bakar. I will be watching.

==Completion==
Your bakar, while massive and strong, does not seem to have the will to do what needs to be done in the hunt. He is too soft!

I will give him one more chance, but this is it!

==Notes==
Speak with Taivan:
:<Taivan looks a little concerned about all the large animals wandering around the watering hole.>

:{{Gossip|Let's hunt, boy!}}

Attack any beast in the area.
*{{Text|emote|Taivan whimpers, unwilling to fight back!}}
*{{Text|emote|Taivan is alarmed that you are hurt, and growls!}}

Kill five:
:{{text|yell|Hunter Jadar|I've seen enough. Come on back, <name>.}}
