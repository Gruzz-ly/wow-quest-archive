'''Thieving Gorlocs''', along with [[Sole Supplier]], starts the optional "Mudfin Village" storyline at [[Timberstep Outpost]].

==Objectives==
Return the stolen supplies from the [[Mudfin Village]].
*[[Shikaar Supplies]] (30)

==Description==
Is Farrier Roscha invited to the caravan? No! But who must provide shoes for the caravan? Farrier Roscha. And from whom do the [[Mudfin tribe|Mudfins]] steal? Of course, Farrier Roscha. Pah.

I would send [[Khasar]], but who knows where he has wandered this time?

Find my supplies. Teach those thieving creatures not to steal from Farrier Roscha.

Go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
There are too many [[gorloc]]s around us. We're not safe here.

==Completion==
Roscha sent you? She must be furious.

She has been through so much already. I could not return without securing all that was lost.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sole Supplier]] before heading out. [[Shikaar Supplies]] drop from most of the Mudfins in Mudfin Village. Turn in to the imprisoned [[Khasar]] at {{Co|80.57|30.74|Ohn'ahran Plains}}.

==Progression==
{{Mudfin Village}}
