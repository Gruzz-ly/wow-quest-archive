==Description==
Oh, <name>.

Do you feel comfort under the sun? Do you feel safe under its bright caress? Does each new day represent hope for the future and a chance to live your life as you've always dreamt it?

Then you know love as I do.

[[Hunter Narman|Narman]] of [[Clan Shikaar]] is my sun. He is my warmth. He is my light. He is my hope.

A man like him deserves a proposal worthy of stature.

We must seek guidance from an Ohn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Narman deserves a gesture as great as he is.

==Completion==
[[Old Arbhog|Arbhog]]'s horns? They'll do just fine.

Arbhog was once the mightiest [[musken]] on the plains. These are a fitting gift for the mightiest hunter. I am sure Narman will appreciate them.

Perhaps one day he will teach me to hunt. An [[Clan Ohn'ir|Ohn'ir]] huntsman. Ha! Imagine that.

==Notes==
Speak to [[Ohn Arasara]], who's sitting nearby.{{Co|63.85|35.9|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
:{{Gossip|<Ask about Dawa's proposal.>}}

:How wonderful!

:Tradition would suggest you fetch some sweets for family. [[Hearthkeeper Erden]] makes a fine pudding.

:Keep it concise. A short gesture is a strong gesture.

Buy [[Yak Milk Pudding]] from [[Hearthkeeper Erden]] at the inn,{{Co|62.19|35.7|Ohn'ahran Plains}} then speak to [[Provisioner Zara]]{{Co|63.56|41.08|Ohn'ahran Plains}} on the [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]] rise:
:{{Gossip|I have brought you sweets on behalf of Windsage Dawa.}}

:Oh, how delightful!

:Such treats must be shared with the entire clan.

:That Dawa is kind to follow tradition, but we Shikaar have different values. We pride ourselves on mastery in our own crafts.

:To love my son is to love the hunt itself. A gesture of the hunt would be more appropriate. Dawa is no hunter, however. There is no shame in it. His duty is to answer to a higher call.

:There is a large gruff musken by the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] enclave. Seek it out and bring the horns to the Windsage. They will make mighty ornaments for Narman and the rest of us will feast from the remains.

Finally, kill [[Old Arbhog]] west of the Nokhud camp{{Co|57.2|42.75|Ohn'ahran Plains}} and loot [[Arbhog's Horns]].

==Progression==
{{Dawa and Narman}}

==Trivia==
*In the Russian version of the game, the quest plotline was rewritten from a same-sex proposal to a sworn brotherhood proposal due to legal circumstances (to avoid a possible ban for homosexual propaganda among minority).

==Patch changes==
