==Objectives==
Deploy the enchanted tools to 5 [[Waygate Rubble|piles of rubble]].
*Tools deployed (5)
*[[Enchanted Tools]] (provided)

==Description==
Good. I was just thinking that I am in need of an [[adventurer]] like you. Strong. Sturdy. Willing to work for a trivial sum.

It is as if I willed you into existence. Well done, me. [[Nelthazan Ruins|These ruins]] seem to have brought the attention of others. We cannot rely on them to excavate it properly. They will taint the samples!

Take this. Deploy it around artifacts of interest around the ruins. It is enchanted to perform any necessary duty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
I think I shall write a bit of poetry. Or, rather, instruct the book to write it for me.

==Completion==
We will gather everything in time.

==Notes==
Interacting with the rubbles summons [[Enchanted Pick]]s.

==Progression==
