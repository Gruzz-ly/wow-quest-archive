==Description==
Our ancestors walk beside us upon the winds of [[Ohn'ahra]], guiding and protecting us. All [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]], dead and living, gather under truce at the [[Khural]].

The scent of this meal calls the ancestors to our fire. When they arrive, the Khural begins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 350 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Recipe: Thrice-Spiced Mammoth Kabob]]

==Progress==
The Maruuk have returned to [[Maruukai|this spot]] for generations upon generations. We walk alongside our ancestors.

==Completion==
Our ancestors risked much for our future. It is right to invite them to gather alongside us.

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Qariin Dotur|[[Aru|Two]] [[Belika|young]] [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]] delivered some game from your travels. Bring it here.}}

Interact with the [[Raw Game Meat]] on the nearby wagon, then interact with the ghost image on Qariin's table to place it.
:{{Text|say|Qariin Dotur|Now we must season the meat. Grab some spice from our stores.}}

Interact with the [[Jar of Spices]], return to the table, and use the [[Extra Action Button]]:
:{{Abilities|Apply Jar of Spices|id=375680|Apply a small amount of spice to the game meat.|icon=inv_misc_powder_copper}}
:{{Text|say|Qariin Dotur|Our foals eat more spice than this. Get more.}}

Repeat the process with the [[Basket of Spices]]:
:{{Abilities|Apply Basket of Spices|id=375765|Apply a large amount of spice to the game meat.|icon=inv_misc_basket_05}}
:{{Text|say|Qariin Dotur|It tastes better, but I can still feel my tongue. Bring over the biggest container of spice.}}

And again with the [[Pot of Spices]]:
:{{Abilities|Apply Cauldron of Spices|id=375771|Apply an overwhelming amount of spice to the game meat.|icon=inv_alchemy_70_cauldron}}
:{{Text|say|Qariin Dotur|Well done. Now that's enough spice to bring [[Maruuk]] and [[Teera]] to the fire!}}
:{{Text|say|Qariin Dotur|You have the honor of charring the roast. Do not remove it from the fire until it is past blackened.}}

Interact with the now [[Spiced Game Meat]], then head to the row of cooking fires.
:{{Abilities|Roasting|id=375932|Roasting an offering of traditional spiced game to the Maruuk ancestors, way past the char point.|icon=spell_fire_fire}}
:{{Text|say|Qariin Dotur|Good, the scent is strong. It will be easily carried to our ancestors on the wind. Place it on the offering table.}}

Finally, interact with the ghost image on the offering table.
:{{Text|say|Qariin Dotur|Ancestors! Be welcome at our Khural. Watch over us as we follow in your hoofprints.}}
:{{Text|say|Qariin Dotur|May Ohn'ahra's winds carry this tribute to you so you may join us.}}
:''Two [[Maruukai Ancestor]]s appear, descending from the sky to hover near the table. They offer a salute before fading from view.''
