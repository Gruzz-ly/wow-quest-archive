==Objectives==
Seek out [[Erden]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Description==
I know a crafter who could help temper [[Fyr'alath]]. Erden of [[Clan Shikaar]] is extremely resourceful. He's performed many experiments with various reagents throughout the [[Dragon Isles]].

[[Hunter]]s are only as good as their weapons. Erden is known for crafting exquisite weaponry with exotic materials. His expertise in various flora and fauna should prove quite informative.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see. 

That axe would certainly be painful to wield. Let me think for a moment.

==Progression==
{{Fyr'alath}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.2.0|note=Added.}}
