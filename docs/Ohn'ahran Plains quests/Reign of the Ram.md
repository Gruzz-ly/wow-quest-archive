==Objectives==
Command [[Taivan]] to confront the herd's Stubborn Ram.
*[[Stubborn Ram]] confronted

==Description==
Since the [[argali]] don't seem to have much respect for Taivan, we should see if he can handle the herd's [[ram]] next.

He's the boss of all the argali here, and quite the stubborn thing. If Taivan can assert dominance over the ram, the herd will start obeying him.

You can find him just over there, on the hill. Good luck, Taivan. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid there's not much hope for him being a herder!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The herd's ram is on the hill just over there. Hopefully Taivan handles this task a little better.

==Completion==
That could have gone better. Sorry, friend, but I don't think Taivan is cut out for this. 

He's a very nice [[bakar]], but doesn't quite seem smart enough to figure out how to get the argali into the pen, or aggressive enough to take command of the herd away from the ram. 

I'm afraid I'm going to have to send you back to [[Healer Selbekh|Selbekh]] with bad news.

==Notes==
The player gains access to the Command Taivan to Confront [[Extra Action Button]]:
:{{Abilities|Command Taivan to Confront|Command Taivan to assert dominance over the Stubborn Ram.|range=5-30|id=383881|icon=ability_hunter_killcommand|notes=1.5 sec cast}}

Head northeast to the [[Stubborn Ram]] and use it:
:{{Text|emote|Taivan looks like he's trying to play with the ram!}}
:''The ram becomes angry, gains Dominance, and attacks!''
:{{Text|emote|The Stubborn Ram readies itself to fight for dominance of the herd!}}

Fend off the ram! Taivan, alas, is still unwilling to fight back:
*{{Text|emote|Taivan is alarmed that you are hurt, and growls!}}
*{{Text|emote|Taivan whimpers, unwilling to fight back!}}

Knock the ram down to 25% health:
:{{Text|emote|The ram calms down, but is still unimpressed with Taivan.}}
:''The ram stops fighting and walks away.''

Upon completion, Taivan has new gossip:
:<Taivan sits and mopes. He seems to be very upset.>
