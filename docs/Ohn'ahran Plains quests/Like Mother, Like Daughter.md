'''Like Mother, Like Daughter''' concludes the "The Dreamer" chapter of the [[Valdrakken Accord]] storyline.

==Objectives==
Witness the ascension of [[Merithra]].
*Witness the Ascension of Merithra
*Speak to Merithra at [[Lunedane]].

==Description==
From the moment I stepped into [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] again, I knew that things were different. But now that we have beaten [[Rymek]] and his [[Primalists]], I must consider all of the implications of what has happened.

My daughter has worked to keep the [[green dragonflight]] together after my death. It is only fitting that she be the one to ascend now.

Merithra must lead the Emerald Flight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* [[Merithra's Blessing]]

==Completion==
Where my mother once flew, I must fly now and in the future. Where her breath brought peace and life, so must mine.

I pledge that I will do my best as the leader of the green dragonflight. I promise that I will do whatever it takes, as [[Ysera]] did for so many millennia.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Merithra walks to Ysera.''
:{{text|say|Merithra|Mother, I will return this mantle to you in a heartbeat, if you want it.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|It is not mine to want or to take back. In my stead, you have grown as a leader, and I am proud of you.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|You are the leader of the green dragonflight. And when we regain our full power, you will be the Aspect.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Then I accept. But first, I would very much like it if we could fly together again.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Let us take to the skies together.}}

On complete:
:''Merithra and Ysera take to the skies.''
:{{text|say|Somnikus|I never thought I would see her fly over the gardens again. I thought this would rightfully be my end.}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|There's a fair amount to look forward to now.}}
:{{text|say|Somnikus|Yes. There is.}}
This completes the "The Dreamer" criterion of [[Friend of the Dragon Isles]].

[[Gerithus]] has gossip:
:I'd say that worked pretty well, in the end!

:{{gossip|What's next?}}
::What's next? I don't exactly know! 

::For now the tree that Tyrande and mother planted in the Emerald Dream will grow, safe and protected. But I have a feeling the Primalists won't give up on it. Now that they and everyone else knows it's there.

::But for now, I'm just happy that Grandmother's back. We missed her terribly.

As does [[Somnikus]]:
:It looks like I get to stick around a little longer. I was so sure that my time had come and gone.

:But Ysera said it was not my time yet, and I believe in her.

:I have seen many years and many things, but to see her fly over the Dragon Isles again is... magnificent. I'm glad I'm here to see it.

Off to the west, [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] has gossip too:
:<Tyrande stares across the water, seemingly at nothing.>

:{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:''Ysera flies in and shifts to her visage form.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|You can almost feel it growing, can't you?}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|[[Malfurion Stormrage|He]] would want to be here with me. The [[Shadowlands]] become ever more difficult to reach, and yet there he remains.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|We have lost so much, Ysera, and still, I am asked to sacrifice.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Malfurion's love for you endures beyond the veil. And when the time comes, he will be there at your side again. I promise.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|But when? When will [[Night elf|my people]] see their home restored? When will we know peace like we did before?}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Know this. I may not be the Aspect of Dream any longer, but I swear I will see the fruition of all our work.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I trust you, my dear friend. And I long to see it with my own eyes.}}
:''Ysera walks away.''
