'''And Yet So Far''' concludes the "Garden of Secrets" chapter of the [[Valdrakken Accord]] campaign at Renown 19. The next chapter, "The Dreamer", begins immediately after, starting with [[Rallying Nature's Allies]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Merithra]].
*Speak to Merithra

==Description==
I cannot slip into [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] here as I once did. With the bough defenses activated, we are essentially blocked from the grove.

But I'm afraid it only gets worse, <name>.

I believe [[Rymek]] did not merely trick us to gain access to the Dream. I suspect he is looking for something within it... something precious and powerful that I swore to protect. 

Not even [[Gerithus]] or [[Somnikus]] knew of its existence, but now, my hand is forced. You must know the truth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Our situation is dire. Rymek has left us few options.

He has forced our hand. Now we must make great sacrifices.

Though we may not be able to enter the grove from this side, there is a way in... from beyond the realms of life.

==Notes==
Speak with Merithra:
:I swore that I would keep it safe. And my worst fears have come to pass.

:{{gossip|What is hidden in the Dream?}}
A [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cutscene]] plays, "A Seed of Hope":
{{#ev:youtube|BHjFnYdg4AE}}
:''Some time ago. Tyrande, Malfurion, and Merithra stand before the portal to the Dream, with Tyrande cradling [[The Sisters' Tear]]. She sighs to herself as Malfurion looks at her with concern writ large.''
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande|This seed is everything.}}
:''Tyrande stares at the tear, brushing it with her right hand.''
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande|So many beloved souls entrusting their fate, their hopes, to us.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Malfurion|Are we certain it will be safe?}}
:''They turn to look at Merithra, who simply glances at the two Kaldorei with a smile.''
:{{text|bossemote|Merithra|Come.}}
:''She leads them forward through the portal. A flash of white as their eyes adjust. In the dream, some glowing green energy lies in the center of a field.''
:{{text|bossemote|Merithra|Here, by Elune's grace, this gift will be kept hidden from those who would wish it harm.}}
:''Tyrande walks to the spot and falls to one knee as she cradles the tear above it.''
:{{text|bossemote|Merithra|Yet the time will come when it must leave the cradle of the dream... and take its place in our world.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Malfurion|And when it does, its protection will fall to us.}}
:''Tyrande brings the seed to her forehead.''
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande|My beloved [[Night elf|Kaldorei]]. All you have suffered, all you have given, will not be in vain.}}
:''She gently places the tear in the spot.''
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande|This I swear to you.}}
:''The tear floats just above the ground, held up by the magic, before being taken into the ground. As the magic fades, the ground looks much like any other. Tyrande closes her eyes and lets out a big breath, as if holding it since taking possession of the seed. She rises to her feet and hugs Malfurion.''
:{{text|bossemote|Malfurion|What is it, my love?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande|Just a feeling... that this time will be different.}}
:''The camera tracks forward to where the tear was "planted", and a few leaves sprout out of the ground before the scene cuts to black.''

This completes the "Garden of Secrets" criterion of [[Friend of the Dragon Isles]].
