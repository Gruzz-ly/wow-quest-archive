'''Sole Supplier''', along with [[Thieving Gorlocs]], starts the optional "Mudfin Village" storyline at [[Timberstep Outpost]].

==Objectives==
Search the woods for [[Khasar]].
*Khasar found{{Co|80.57|30.74|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
Poor [[Farrier Roscha|Roscha]]! She has toiled endlessly to prepare for the caravan, only for her supplies to be stolen by nasty [[gorloc]]s.

She has lost so much already. I am doing my best to assist her.

Khasar likely went after her supplies alone, telling no one. It is his way. But he has been gone too long. Many [[Bakar|dogs]] are missing as well.

Would you please check on Khasar and the dogs, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|10|50}}
*3,750 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Let's get to work.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Thieving Gorlocs]] before heading out. Khasar is found locked in a cage in the western end of [[Mudfin Village]]. On approach:
