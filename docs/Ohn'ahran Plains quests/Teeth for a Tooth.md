==Objectives==
Slay 10 rockfangs with Toluijin.
*[[Ravenous Rockfang]] slain (10)
*[[Sutaan]] slain

==Description==
[[Toluiqi|Toliqui]]{{sic}} has been claiming that just the other day she killed a [[rockfang]] without any assistance. Given our connected souls, I don't want to call her as a liar. So instead... 

I want to prove to her, and everyone else, that I'm the better half of our soul! The nearest rockfang quest is to the northeast - meet me there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
I cannot let Toliqui continue to leave me in her shadow.

==Completion==
[[Clan Aylaag|The clan]] will be talking about this for weeks!

==Notes==
Find the rockfans at the [[Rockfang Ravine]]. Toluijin joins you.

==Patch changes==
