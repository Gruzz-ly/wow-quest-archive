==Objectives==
Destroy the [[Primalists]] and their source of storm [[magic]].
*Primalist Forces (4)
*[[Storm Pylon]]

==Description==
<[[Scout Watu|Watu]] rips the shard out and gasps for air.>

I...completely lost control. [[Sentinel Olekk|Olekk]] was right. This terrible magic has to be the primalists' doing. Please, stop them!

I must get my brother back to camp.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Go with haste! That kind of power must be kept in check.

==Completion==
You've returned! I felt the destruction of the source from here.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Scout Watu|Olekk? Can you stand?}}
:{{Text|say|Sentinel Olekk|Errughh...}}
:''Olekk stands up.''
:{{Text|say|Scout Watu|Lean on me. Come on.}}
:''The centaur brothers walk toward the camp.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Scout Watu|I sent an [[Ohuna|eagle]] to [[Maruukai]] with information about the shards and primalists. This is bigger than what we could handle ourselves.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Watu|I'm sorry, Olekk.}}
:{{Text|say|Sentinel Olekk|As I understand it, you weren't completely yourself.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Watu|The shard amplified my desire to act, not think. I lost my rationale.}}
:{{Text|say|Sentinel Olekk|In that case, I accept your apology, little brother. We'll keep you far away from such shards in the future.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Watu|I wouldn't touch one with a ten foot spear.}}
:{{Text|say|Sentinel Olekk|But if you do, try not to fry me like a [[tallstrider]]'s egg again.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Watu|I swear by our ancestors.}}

Completing the quest also awards the "Pinewood Post" criterion of [[Sojourner of Ohn'ahran Plains]].
