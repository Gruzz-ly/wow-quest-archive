==Description==
<Name>, to me! We are within reach of victory!

The [[Primalists|Primalist]] ranks are broken, and their war is all but through. Everything we have achieved hinges on this final battle against the Primalist leader, Koroleth.

Let us finish this, you and I! Together! To battle, <brother/sister>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|52|42}}
* 11,700 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Completion==
At last, it is done. Our sacred isle is safe once more. Thank you for all you have done for my kind, <name>.

==Notes==
Koroleth is found riding a hovering [[Stormbound Proto-Drake]] at the nearby barrier pillar. On aggro, the drake lands on the ground:
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|Insolent worm! The storm consumes all!}}

Upon being brought to 50% health, the drake becomes stunned. Koroleth dismounts, runs some distance away, and starts channeling on the drake:
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|No... I will not be defeated! Give me your strength, beast!}}

After a few seconds, this causes the drake to die. Koroleth gains the "Power of the Storm" buff and becomes attackable:
:{{Abilities|Power of the Storm|id=385793|Increases damage done and maximum health by 10%.|icon=spell_nature_lightningoverload}}
:{{Text|yell|Koroleth|You've accomplished nothing. Once I've dealt with you, nothing will stand between us and the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]].}}

Kill her with Sarest's help:
:{{Text|say|Koroleth|No! I have failed. The Dream must be ours...}}
:{{Text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|My purpose here is fulfilled, <name>. Let us meet again soon.}}

Sarest leaves the player side, running off and despawning. [[Gerithus]] flies in, stopping at the southern end of the pillar. Talk to him:
:You've done it, <name>! The [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] [[centaur]] are already falling back, and the Primalists are scattering without their leader.

:Don't worry - we should be able to clean things up here.

:{{Gossip|Take me to Merithra.}}

The player hops up on Gerithus' back and he flies south.
:{{Text|say|Gerithus|Come, little one. The Primalists have been dealt with. Our forces will make quick work of any foolish enough to linger.}}
:{{Text|say|Gerithus|Without our allies, we could not have achieved this victory. Merithra is summoning their leaders to an audience.}}
:{{Text|say|Gerithus|She asked for you as well, <race>.}}

Gerithus drops the player off at the ford between the [[Emerald Gardens]] and the [[Ancient Bough]], where a gathering is happening. Merithra, in humanoid form, is addressing a centaur crowd, with [[Okir]], [[Sansok Khan|Sansok]], Sarest, [[Tigari Khan|Tigari]], and [[Altan]] in the front and generic [[Ohn'ir Windsage]]s and [[Shikaar Hunter]]s in the back. Hovering above are [[Viranikus]], [[Berinus]], [[Hesthera]], [[Fernarus]], and a number of generic [[Green Dragon (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Green Dragons]]. Gerithus shifts into humanoid form and goes to stand next to Merithra.
:{{Text|say|Merithra|This day, you have proven yourself to the green dragonflight.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|It is a deed of kindness and sacrifice my people will not soon forget.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Against hatred and chaos, the greatest weapon we wield is fellowship. So come, friends. Join me under the Ancient Bough.}}
