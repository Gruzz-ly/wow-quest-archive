==Objectives==
Kill 3 Nokhud Warmongers and destroy 3 Dragon-Killer Ballistae.
*[[Nokhud Warmonger]] slain (3)
*[[Dragon-Killer Ballista]] destroyed (3)

==Description==
So long as a single [[green dragon]] draws breath, these [[Primalists]] will not defile the [[Ancient Bough]] without a fight.

We are eager to do our part in this battle, but as long as those [[dragonkiller ballista]]e are on the field, we cannot approach. The [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]]'s strongest warriors guard them, so you will need to take down the warriors as well.

Destroy the ballistae and Nokhud Warmongers. Eliminate this threat, and the green dragons will turn the tide of battle.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Ohn'ir Initiate Wraps
|Nokhud Reaver Armguards
|Shikaar Scout Bracers
|Teerai Watcher Bindings|c4={{ClassIcon|Demon hunter}}{{ClassIcon|Druid}}{{ClassIcon|Monk}}{{ClassIcon|Rogue}}
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Make haste, mortal. I will not commit dragons to battle while those ballistae remain.

==Completion==
Good riddance to those awful weapons. May no other dragon suffer as [[Solethus]] did.

==Notes==
On accept, [[Khanam Matra Sarest]] starts accompanying the player. [[Nokhud Warmonger]]s are usually, but not always, found next to one of the three Ballistae. Upon destroying all three:
:{{Text|say|Merithra|The last ballista is down! Now the green dragonflight can take to the skies and join the battle!}}

Turn in to Sarest.

==Progression==
