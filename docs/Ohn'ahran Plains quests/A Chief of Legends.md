==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Chief Grrlgllmesh.jpg|Chief Grrlgllmesh|The mightiest of gorlocs, Grrlgllmesh has nothing more to conquer but his own despair.}}
Kill Chief Grrlgllmesh.
*[[Chief Grrlgllmesh]]{{Co|82.08|31.53|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
The [[gorloc]]s of [[Mirewood Fen|this swamp]] were once simple creatures. Pests, perhaps, but never raiders, [[Thief|thieves]], or [[Bakar|dog]]-eaters.

It is their [[Chieftain|chief]], Grrlgllmesh, who has led them away from their nature.

Put an end to him, and the gorlocs will threaten us no more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|52|42|}}
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Chief Grrlgllmesh is a scourge to these lands.

==Completion==
With their chieftain slain, the gorlocs will no longer bother us.

I am astounded by how strong they became under Chief Grrlgllmesh.

I have never seen such primitive creatures rise up against a mighty civilization like ours before. Are we not so different? So much further evolved? I suppose not...

==Notes==
Grrlgllmesh is located in the center of the village with his pet, [[Trrsha]]. Upon death, he drops [[Medallion of a Fallen Friend]], which starts [[Medallion of a Fallen Friend (quest)]]. On completion:
:{{Text|say|Khasar|The Chief is slain!}}
:{{Text|say|Khasar|Now we can get out of this cave.}}

==Progression==
{{Mudfin Village}}
