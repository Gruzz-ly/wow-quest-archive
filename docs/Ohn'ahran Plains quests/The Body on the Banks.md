==Objectives==
Speak to Roska to begin carefully excavating the [[Centaur|centaur]] corpse.
*Speak to [[Roska Rocktooth|Roska]] to start the excavation
*Body Excavated
*[[Archivist's Water Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
<The state of the corpse of this [[Khanam Dochra|centaur woman]] is surprising.

Her clothing is in a style unfamiliar to you, and her skin is emblazoned with intricate tattoos.

Her body is intact, so it seems as though she could not have been dead long... or could she? Conditions here may have led to better preservation.

Roska will want to have a look at this!>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nothing like silt, eh <name>? Never know what you'll find!

==Completion==
Would you look at that! I bet this poor gal has been buried under all that silt for hundreds of years if not more.

Bogs and riverbeds like this tend to preserve what's been left in them.

But now that she's out, we can find out more about who she was and how she got here!

==Notes==
On accept, Roska shows up nearby and says:
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Whoa! That's quite a find!}}

Roska has new gossip here
{{book|content=
{{gossip|What can you tell me about this incredible find?}}

There's no telling 'til we can excavate it, but I suspect we've got a bog body on our hands!

Sometimes, the bodies of folks who died long ago will be perfectly preserved when all the normal forces that decompose them can't reach 'em. Usually it happens in bogs, but it can happen anywhere.

If that's the case, we'll want to be extremely careful and only excavate when conditions are absolutely perfect. 

This lady's been waiting a long time to return to her people. We need to take the job seriously!

Upon talking to Roska and selecting {{gossip|quest=|Let's start excavating!}}:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Start washing the dirt off her with my totem, but be careful!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|If she's too exposed, bury her a little more until she's stable again.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Only excavate when conditions are just right!}}

If too much earth is present:
*{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|She's gonna collapse! More water--quick!}}
*{{Text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Wash that dirt off her before she gets buried!}}

If too much water is present, Roska will say one of the following lines:
*{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|The river's washing her away! Grab some dirt to stabilize her!}}
*{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|The tide's coming! Dirt! We need dirt!}}

When conditions are perfect:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|That looks stable! Let's get digging before conditions change.}}

Examining the body after the excavation yields a [[Quilted Tent Scrap]] or [[Wooden Caravan Spoke]].
