==Objectives==
Free the [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]] [[Bakar]].
*Bakar freed (5)
*Bakar Collar (2)

==Description==
I have heard the familiar howls and barks of bakar that are missing from [[Timberstep Outpost|camp]].

Our beloved dogs are trapped in cages, waiting to be ripped apart by those... [[Mudfin tribe|those things]].

We have a duty to our companions. Free them and witness the true might of a Shikaar bakar!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Bag of Biscuits]]
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The gorlocs of this village will learn to fear our bakar.

==Completion==
Magnificent beasts, aren't they?

Every bakar holds a special place in Clan Shikaar. They are our fellow hunters, guards, and our most cherished friends.

==Notes==
There are seven named bakar throughout [[Mudfin Village]]. [[Pesca]], [[Tseg]], [[Fogl]], [[Zephyr (bakar)|Zephyr]], and [[Elaichi]] are locked in [[Bakar Cage|cages]] and will accompany and fight alongside the player for 1 minute after they are freed.<!-- all four with ID 186756 --> [[Batu (bakar)|Batu]] and [[Sarnai]] are lying dead. Interact with them to loot [[Batu's Collar]] and [[Sarnai's Collar]].
