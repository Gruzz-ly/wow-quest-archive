==Objectives==
Kill 8 Stormbound Essences and 6 Stormcaller Initiates.
*[[Stormbound Essence]] slain (8)
*[[Stormcaller Initiate]] slain (6)

==Description==
This unnatural storm is heavy with magic. By the looks of it, the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] are learning to manipulate the sacred essence of [[Windsong Rise]] to create storm elementals. Some have had more success than others...

<Boku gestures to the unfortunate Nokhud initiate nearby still smoking from lightning burns.>

<name>, we can't allow them to continue.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The Nokhud will regret abandoning [[Ohn'ahra]] for the [[Primalists]]!

==Completion==
I don't want to spill blood, but the Nokhud must be stopped.

==Notes==
Upon accepting all of Weather Control, [[Eagle-itarian]], and [[Fowl Sorcery]], Boku runs off and despawns:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Something is at the top of the rise. I will take a side route. Meet me up there!}}

Essences and Initiates are found around the rise. After finishing all the objectives, find Boku on the top of the rise, near where [[Koroleth]] is holding [[Ohn'ahra]] captive. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|How is this possible? They have captured Ohn'ahra herself!}}

==Progression==
{{Ohn'ahra's Blessing}}
