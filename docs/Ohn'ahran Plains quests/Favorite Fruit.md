==Objectives==
Forage Wild Bushfruit from the [[Ohn'ir Geysers]] and feed them to 6 Lounging Mudstompers.
*[[Wild Bushfruit]] (6)
*[[Lounging Mudstomper|Mudstomper]]s fed (6)

==Description==
[[Mystic]] training is so boring. I'm watching water be wet half of my days. My brothers are already out in the wild hunting [[drake]]s and [[primalists]], and making a difference in the [[Azeroth|world]].

Anyway, I promised I'd show you something cool! Did you know mudstompers love bushfruit? It grows nearby, among the geysers. Go pick some and we can feed them together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
I used to really like bushfruit until I had too much one day.

My whole body was shivering, like a bad cold, and my breath was minty for days after.

==Completion==
Seems like they like you! Or just the fruit. That's okay too. <Radiya winks.>

==Notes==
Wild Bushfruits are near the waterfalls. Once collected head back and feed the mudstompers.

==Progression==
