==Objectives==
Collect 5 Camp Provisions from around [[Timberstep Outpost]] and 4 Feralbloom Pods from the nearby woods.
*[[Feralbloom Pod]] (5)
*[[Camp Provisions]] (4)
*Report to [[Scout Tomul]].

==Description==
<As [[Sansok Khan]] signs, [[Okir]] vocalizes for her.>

While you travel with us, you must pull your weight. [[Mudfin tribe|Unruly gorlocs]] have been raiding our medical supplies recently, and we must restock. Gather the orange blooms around the outpost so we can create more poultices.

There are supplies around the outpost that need to be brought to the caravan as well. I would like you to gather them while you are out.

Once you have everything, bring it to [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Nokhud Reaver Waistguard
|Ohn'ir Initiate Sash
|Shikaar Scout Buckle
|Teerai Watcher Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Don't bother me until you have the caravan provisions.

==Completion==
<Scout Tomul looks over the gathered provisions.>

Everything seems to be in order.

==Notes==
Feralbloom Pods are looted from [[Medicinal Feralbloom]]s around the outpost, while Camp Provisions are looted in the form of four different items: [[Bundle of Pelts]] on a table inside Sansok's tent, [[Crate of Horseshoes (Ohn'ahran Plains)]] next to [[Apprentice Ehri]], [[Shikaar Weaponry]] from a [[Weapon Rack (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Weapon Rack]] in the northern end of camp, and [[Basket of Dried Fish]] at the southern lakeshore next to [[Ranger Otyuk]].

==Progression==
{{Into the Plains}}
