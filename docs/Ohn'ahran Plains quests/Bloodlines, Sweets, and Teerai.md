==Description==
I have hunted with [[khan]]s, outrun our fastest [[bakar]], and wrestled a full grown [[bruffalon]] bull bare-handed. As a hunter, I've nothing left to prove.

However, as a partner, I still have much to learn.

[[Windsage Dawa]] of [[Clan Ohn'ir]] is my heart and my joy. I wish only to prove worthy of his love, but I know nothing of traditions and rituals. I require the wisdom of the elders in [[Maruukai]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*7,500 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
What if I am not good enough for Dawa's love?

==Completion==
I would sooner ask all the stars of the night sky to admire me back than claim to be wholly worthy of Dawa's love.

Nonetheless, I will find the courage to proceed. When the time comes, will you assist me with a grand proposal?

==Notes==
Speak to [[Elder Odgerel]] at the base of the [[krutal]].{{Co|60|37.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
:{{Gossip|<Ask about Narman's proposal.>}}

:A proposal? Nonsense.

:Tradition is very clear on this matter. Fetch some sweets for the matchmaker! A nice tart will do.

:There are many ceremonies to be done.

:{{Gossip|Thank you.}}

Buy [[Honey Plum Tart]] from [[Hearthkeeper Erden]] in the Ohn'ir area,{{Co|62.19|35.7|Ohn'ahran Plains}} then speak to [[Matchmaker Osila]]{{Co|55.37|38.38|Ohn'ahran Plains}} at the [[Field of Ferocity]]:
:{{Gossip|I have brought some sweets for you, matchmaker.}}

:Sweets? Bahaha.

:<Osila takes a large bite of the tart.>

:Did Odgerel send you? She knows I can't resist a good tart. While tradition does dictate an exchange of offerings between families, true compatibility comes from ancestral guidance.

:Fetch some Cirrus flowers and place them before the [[Kurgan|burial mound]]. We will consult the bloodline.

:{{Gossip|Thank you.}}

Gather 8 [[Cirrus Flowers]] from the small field area to the east, then interact with the ghost Cirrus Flowers image on the altar at the burial mound halfway up the road to [[Maruukai]]. This causes [[Saran Khan]] to appear atop the mound while Narman, Odgerel, and Osila run up to the altar.
:{{Text|say|Saran Khan|Who dares to awaken Saran Khan?}}
:{{Text|say|Elder Odgerel|Pardon, great Khan. We beseech your blessing in betrothal.}}
:{{Text|say|Matchmaker Osila|Go on, then. Ask.}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter Narman|Great Khan! I come before you for your blessing in seeking the hand of your grandson.}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter Narman|I am among the mightiest of Shikaar hunters of the current day. I can hit the eye of a bruffalon from 60 paces. I am faster than--}}
:{{Text|say|Saran Khan|Enough! I care not for your accomplishments. Is your love true?}}
:{{Text|say|Hunter Narman|It is.}}
:{{Text|say|Saran Khan|Then you have my blessing. Stay true as you claim your arrow to be, hunter.}}
:''Saran's spirit runs off and disappears.''
:{{Text|say|Elder Odgerel|Love? This is far from traditional.}}
:''Narman runs back to Maruukai, followed by Odgerel, while Osila walks back to the Field of Ferocity.''

==Progression==
{{Dawa and Narman}}

==Trivia==
*In the Russian version of the game quest plotline was rewritten from a same-sex proposal to a sworn brotherhood proposal due to legal circumstances (to avoid a possible ban for homosexual propaganda among minority).

==Patch changes==
