When you are ready to leave, find me at the caravan. Don't keep us waiting.

On accept, Tomul runs out of the tent and despawns.
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|The caravan will be waiting at the gates. Do not hold us up.}}

A long caravan line waits at Timberstep Outpost's western entrance. From front to back, it consists of Tomul and a [[Loyal Bakar]], a [[Pack Musken]] pulling a [[Caravan Wagon]], a [[Shikaar Hunter]] and their [[Shikaar Ohuna]], [[Ohn Seshsteng]], [[Basran]], [[Sansok Khan]] and [[Okir]], another Hunter, a [[Stout Riding Bakar]], another Pack Musken and Wagon, [[Aru]] and [[Belika]], and finally a [[Shikaar Preyseeker]] and [[Shikaar Beastmaster|Beastmaster]].

Talk to Tomul to get the show on the road:
:The caravan travels slowly. Even you should be able to keep up.
:{{Gossip|I'm ready to go.}}

[[File:Toward the City - first stop.jpg|thumb|The first stop: Wanderer's Steppe]]
The caravan is, indeed, very slow. It follows the dirt path west out of [[Mirewood Fen]] until it reaches the bridge where the player first met Tomul, at which point it turns south along the main road. The player can choose to run ahead and wait at the first stop or even leave to do other activities and catch back up later, or they can choose to travel with the caravan and listen to their stories. The player can ride on the Stout Riding Bakar if they don't want to manually keep pace with the caravan.
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|Walk with us, <name>. We have many stories to share.}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|The Maruuk centaur include many individual clans across the plains.}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|There are four of us who hold the most power: Clans [[Clan Teerai|Teerai]], [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]], [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]], and [[Clan Ohn'ir|Ohn'ir]].}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|Clan Teerai are the keepers of our traditions. Their leader, the [[Khanam Matra]], is the cultural [[khan]] of all Maruuk. All khanam matras can trace their bloodlines back to our first matriarch, [[Teera]].}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|We of Clan Shikaar are the strongest hunters. You can find our camps spread throughout the plains, following the patterns of wildlife and game.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Clan Nokhud has recently come to power. A generation ago, [[Jhakan Khan]] led his people to defeat [[Clan Toghus]], taking their place of power amongst the plains.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|His son, [[Balakar Khan]], now leads this clan. His father was a man of honor, but Balakar Khan did not inherit his father's patience or wisdom.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|My clan, Clan Ohn'ir, is made up of those who feel a direct connection to our god, [[Ohn'ahra]]. She guided our founders, [[Maruuk]] and Teera, to the [[Dragon Isles]], and she has watched over our people ever since.}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Seshteng|The [[mystic]]s of Clan Ohn'ir are initiated from many different clans, but we all followed Ohn'ahra's call to serve her and our people.}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|The clans have their differences, but we share one culture. No matter our strengths and weaknesses, we are all Maruuk.}}
:{{Text|say|Belika|Two-foot, you've fought many foes in your time, yes? You will have to share some stories.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Have I ever shared the tale of my first kill, Belika? A mighty [[hornstrider]] with horns as tall as its legs were long! I keep its horn as a trophy.}}
:{{Text|say|Okir|It was a good kill, Tomul. My first was a mighty [[bear]] of ice and snow, deep in the frozen tundra of the [[Azure Span]]. My [[bakar]] and I knew no equals. We were the talk of the Khural!}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Ah, we have reached our first stop. Circle the wagons, Shikaar. It is time for a hunt.}}
