==Objectives==
Assist [[Khasar]] with [[Shalkeel]]'s burial.
*[[Shovel (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Bury]] the brave Shikaar

==Description==
Shalkeel deserves to be seen off properly.

I want to dress his burial area and say a few words. I know your time is precious, but would you take the shovel and bury his ashes while I perform the rites?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Shalkeel's Remembrance]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If I were able to handle his ashes, I'd have poured them out over the stream he and I played in when we were children.

==Completion==
I wish I could compensate you for this act, but I have no diplomatic medals or legendary weapons to bestow, <name>. 

Just know that I... I could not have shouldered the weight of this day alone. A heart hollowed by loss takes time to fill again.

Be well. And thank you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Khasar|I brought a shovel, but... I find myself quite fragile. Would you mind taking this burden, <name>?}}

Interact with the [[Shovel (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Shovel]]:
:{{text|say|Khasar|Shalkeel was a true master of the spear. Prodigious, even.}}
:{{text|say|Khasar|It is fitting that he ensured his weapon's safety, even when confronted by death.}}
:''Khasar picks up the spear, repairs it, and plants it in the ground at Shalkeel's head. As the player finishes channeling, the ashes are buried.''
:{{text|say|Khasar|His skill was born, of all things, from his uncertainty. Uncertainty of his martial aptitude, of his ability to protect our home, and of the admiration his loved ones gave.}}
:{{text|say|Khasar|Ever-relentless training allowed Shalkeel to hide from those that cared for him. It made him as great as he was lonely.}}
:{{text|say|Khasar|If only you had known how welcome you were. Was the thought of opening up to friends more frightening than a fight with the [[Incarnates]]?}}
:{{text|say|Khasar|Ah, I am being unfair. You fought for our people, even when you could not do so for yourself. That was how you showed your love, and I will question it no further.}}
:{{text|say|Khasar|Brave Shalkeel of the [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]]! Let the strength of your spear and the howl of your companion fill you with pride!}}
:{{text|say|Khasar|Pride... and peace. Goodbye, my dear friend.}}
:''Raidon lies down beside the ashes as Khasar sits down.''

What's left of Shalkeel's spear has been planted as a grave marker, now the [[Tribute to a Brave Shikaar: Shalkeel]]:
:Here lies Shalkeel, prodigy of the spear, brave warrior of the Shikaar, first to stand against [[Fyrakk]], the Incarnate of Fire.
:May his spirit live on to protect travelers of the Plains from harm. 
:May his memory live on to protect his loved ones from sorrow.

Khasar has new gossip as well:
:Shalkeel is at rest now. 
:His friend, his [[bakar]] companion, and a stranger were witnesses to his burial. A burial which had to be performed at the spot of his death because of a dreadful foe's magic.
:Life here was less complicated, less violent, before we were exposed to the Incarnates and the rest of [[Azeroth]]'s people. Do not take this poorly, but I often wish the [[Dragon Isles|Isles]] had never come out of hiding. Shalkeel and many other friends may still be here, if we hadn't.
:Or perhaps [[Balakar Khan|Balakar]] and the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] would have conquered the Shikaar completely had none of you arrived. Perhaps I would have had no one to help as I shed tears over this grave. Perhaps...
:Perhaps I am too filled with thoughts and feelings just now. Apologies, <name>. Be well.
