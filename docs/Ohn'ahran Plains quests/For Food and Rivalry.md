==Objectives==
Collect 30 Fresh Game Meat from wildlife in [[Wanderer's Steppe]].
*[[Fresh Game Meat]] (30)

==Description==
[[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk]] travel from all across the plains to attend the [[Khural]], and the gathering lasts many days.

Feeding that many [[centaur]] is no simple feat. [[Clan Shikaar]]'s [[hunter]]s provide meat for all of the shared meals. It is our tradition to hunt on our way to [[Maruukai]].

You must pull your weight as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|21|}}
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Our youngest hunters are passionate and determined. Be sure they don't show you up.

==Completion==
You hunt as strangely as you fight. I hope [[Aru]] and [[Belika]] observed your technique.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Scout Tomul|Aru! Belika! Show the two-foot how we hunt.}}
:{{Text|say|Belika|The hunt is on, <name>!}}
:{{Text|say|Aru|Whoever brings back the most game wins!}}
:''Aru and Belika run off in different directions.''

[[Fresh Game Meat]] drops in varying quantities from the [[mammoth]]s ([[Plainswalker Calf|Plainswalker Calves]], [[Plainswalker Mammoth]]s, and elite [[Plainswalker Bull]]s), [[rhino]]s ([[Sunhide Stomphoof]]s), and [[argali]] ([[Fleecepelt Argali]]) on the steppe. Stronger beasts drop more meat. If the player kills a flock of Fleecepelt Argali, Aru will criticize them:
:{{Text|say|Aru|Argali are hardly honorable kills, outsider. If you want to earn respect, you must hunt more dangerous game!}}

Aru himself can be found at {{Co|78.5|32.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}, next to a dead Plainswalker Bull. On approach:
:{{Text|yell|Aru|This bull could feed a whole camp! Think you can do better?}}
:''He runs off and despawns.''

Belika can be found at {{Co|76.1|34.28|Ohn'ahran Plains}}, next to a dead Sunhide Stomphoof, Plainswalker Mammoth, Plainswalker Calf, and Plainswalker Bull. On approach:
:{{Text|yell|Belika|That's three more, Aru and <name>! Try to keep up.}}
:''She runs off and despawns.''

On completion, Aru and Belika run back in from the steppe to rejoin the caravan.
:{{Text|say|Belika|I won! I won!}}
:{{Text|say|Aru|No, I am better than you! Sure, you killed more, but most of your game cannot be used!}}

==Progression==
