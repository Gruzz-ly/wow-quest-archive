'''Signs of the Wind''', along with [[Land of the Apex]], starts the optional "Elder Nazuun" storyline in [[Teerakai]].

==Objectives==

Gather wind tokens and give them to the [[Offering Vessel (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Offering Vessel]] near the [[singing stone]].
*Wind Tokens (8)

==Description==
When the elements, true primals of the world, challenged the [[centaur]], [[Himia, the Blessed|Himia]] met them with our given gift. The wind.

A singing stone stands strong in the plains. There, you can offer tokens of the wind to evoke her memory. Such tokens may be found all around us--a bird's feather, a plant spore, a river's reeds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The singing stone is a morning's ride from here.

==Completion==
<There are ashen remains of previously offered wind tokens in the iron container.>

<You place what you've gathered on top.>

==Notes==
Wind Tokens are obtained by interacting with [[Fern Spores]] around the small pond northeast of [[Teerakai]], [[Avian Feather]]s on the rocks near the road, and [[Hollow Reeds]] in [[Thunderspine Thicket]]. There is no looting of items involved; simply interacting with the objects gives quest progress.

Completing the quest causes the ghost of [[Himia, The Blessed]] to appear next to the Offering Vessel.

==Progression==
{{Elder Nazuun}}
