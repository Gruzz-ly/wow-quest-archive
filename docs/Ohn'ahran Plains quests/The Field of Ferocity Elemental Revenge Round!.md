==Objectives==
Defeat the Primalist champion.
*[[Primalists|Primalist]] champion slain (1)
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
We're changing the roster at last minute. Some Primalist bigwig wants to join in on the competition to face you. And I'm not saying no to an angry [[elemental]] [[dragon]].
 
I'm sure you'll be fine. If not, then... well, you signed the waiver, right?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|52|42|}}
* 11,700 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
You need to speak with Gurgthock to start the round, then defeat the fifth competitor of the Field of Ferocity.

==Completion==
I now understand the rumors I have heard about you and your crew. You have gotten further than I would have ever expected.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Gurgthock
:Are you ready to rumble?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready to begin the fight.}}
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|This one is going to be a good one. This powerhouse muscled into this competition not for honor, but for revenge!}}
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|Powered by the elements, this drake certainly packs a punch. They have vowed to show no mercy to defenders of the Aspects!}}
:{{Text|yell|[[Huntmaster Amaa]]|And you should show no mercy for the fool in return.}}
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|Yeesh, okay then. Round five, fight!}}

You find one of the proto-dragons: [[Veshrak of the North]], [[Chalsec of the Earth]], [[Gethrel the South Wind]], and [[Rakkesh of the Flow]].

;Aggro
:{{Text|say|The elements will consume you!}}

;Dragon defeated
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|Looks like the drake was out of their element. Eh?}}
:{{Text|yell|Huntmaster Amaa|Stop. No. Get help.}}
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|Only one fight left for our intrepid competitors!}}
