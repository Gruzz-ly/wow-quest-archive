==Objectives==
Shear cliffhoof [[argali]] for their wool.
*[[Wild Argali Wool]] (8)
*[[Aylaag Skinning Shear]] (provided)

==Description==
While most of our wool comes from our own argali flocks, we do sometimes need to pull from the land when the flock grows thin.

The nearby plains are home to wild argali - they tend to be more temperamental than [[Clan Aylaag|our clan]]'s flock. If you could take this blade and attempt to shear their wool, it would be a great service to Aylaag.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
Take care to avoid the horns. They're as sharp as any knife.

==Completion==
I will get this wool to the artisans who can use it. Thank you.

==Notes==
Use the quest item on [[Wild Cliffhoof]]s.
