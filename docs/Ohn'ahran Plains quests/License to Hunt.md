==Objectives==
Complete the [[Grand Hunt]] training tasks.
*Hunt Creatures (100%)
*[[Injured Baby Salamanther]] revived (5)
*[[Invasive Clearwater Snapper]] slain (3)
*[[Nubagh]] slain

==Description==
Ah, finally ready to prove yourself as a hunter? Keep in mind this is not as simple as running around and hunting everything that moves. The [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]] hunt with purpose. We hunt to feed and clothe the clan, to prove our strength against mighty foes, and to balance nature.

We do not hunt the land barren, we sow the seeds for future Grand Hunts as we go. Prove yourself capable of following these instructions and you may join us.

However I do not have confidence in your friend there succeeding.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9|}}
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your training?

==Completion==
Excellent! You are ready to join the Grand Hunts!

Please inform this [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.|Nesingwary Jr]]. that there is more to hunting than mindless killing and that he is unwelcome to join us.

==Notes==
To fill up the bar, kill [[Spotted Prowler]]s (14%), [[Shifty Salamanther]]s (13%), [[Clawfisher Eagle]]s, [[Sprightly Hornstrider]]s (9%), [[Sunwing Ohuna]], and [[Swift Hornstrider]]s.

In the same area, Hemet also hunts:
