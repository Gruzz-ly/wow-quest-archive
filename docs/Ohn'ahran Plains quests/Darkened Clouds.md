==Objectives==
Clear out the [[Primalist]] presence from Windsong Rise.
*[[Windsong Rise]] forces slain (12)
*[[Storm Scepter]]s destroyed (6)

==Description==
The Primalists have infected Windsong Rise with their nonsense teachings. Our kin there are foolish to entertain their ideas.

If we assist with clearing this sacred ground of their presence, perhaps the other [[clan]]s will come to our aid in time of need. Do you think you could assist?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
With such few numbers, there is only so much Aylaag can do...

==Completion==
Thank you.

==Notes==
Kill [[Stormcaller Initiate]]s, [[Nokhud Goliath]]s, [[Primalist Stormsmith]]s, and [[Primalist Instructor]]s.

==Patch changes==
