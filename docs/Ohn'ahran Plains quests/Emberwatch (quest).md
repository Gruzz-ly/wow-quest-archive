'''Emberwatch''' is an optional breadcrumb to the "Nelthazan Ruins" storyline at [[Emberwatch]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Ohn'ir Wind Chimes to [[Emberwatch]].
*[[Ohn'ir Wind Chimes]] (provided)

==Description==
Hail, outsider.

The winds tell me of a group taking shelter in the ruins of Emberwatch. They seem only interested in the past while we [[centaur]] choose to live for the present under the grace of [[Ohn'ahra]].

Nonetheless, they are guests in our home. I have fashioned for them these wind chimes so they may hear Ohn'ahra's presence. May it bring their hearth some joy and comfort.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|55|25}}
*2,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's this?

How fascinating. It must be an ancient artifact of great importance.

We will need some time to study it.
