==Objectives==
Use Boku's Wind Totem to destroy the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] wagons.
*Wagons destroyed (4)

==Description==
It is said that [[Ohn'ahra]] infused [[Batubar the Relentless|the spear]] of our ancestor, [[Maruuk]], with her power. [[Balakar Khan]] must have told the [[Primalists]] about that legend.

They have stolen the magic from Ohn'ahra's children, polluted it with storm sorcery, and infused it into [[Dragonkiller ballista|ballista bolts]]. Why would the Nokhud need such weapons?

We shouldn't wait to find out. These storm bolts are being loaded into wagons for transport. Take my totems and place one atop each wagon you come across. My wind magic will smash them to pieces.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
You might want to run after placing a totem.

==Completion==
I'm sure there's more out there, but we destroyed what we could. Hopefully, this will at least slow them down.

==Notes==
Upon accepting all of Fowl Sorcery, [[Eagle-itarian]], and [[Weather Control]], Boku runs off and despawns:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Something is at the top of the rise. I will take a side route. Meet me up there!}}

There are four wagons around the rise,{{Co|58.18|67.34|Ohn'ahran Plains}}{{Co|59.23|65.46|Ohn'ahran Plains}}{{Co|61.74|66.66|Ohn'ahran Plains}}{{Co|58.69|61.87|Ohn'ahran Plains}} each with a Boku's Wind Totem ghost image. Interact with the images to place the totems, creating a burst of wind that destroys the wagon and knocks the player back.

After finishing all the objectives, find Boku on the top of the rise, near where [[Koroleth]] is holding Ohn'ahra captive. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|How is this possible? They have captured Ohn'ahra herself!}}

==Progression==
{{Ohn'ahra's Blessing}}
