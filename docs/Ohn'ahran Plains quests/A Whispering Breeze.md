Approach [[Ohn'ahra]] in [[Ohn'ahra's Roost]].
*[[Stolen Breath of Ohn'ahra]] (3)
*[[Exultant Incense]]
*[[Essence of Awakening (item)]]

==Description==
<[[Godoloto]] cocks her head quizzically, nods at you, and finally holds your gaze. After a long moment, she casts her eyes up towards the sky... and the mountain just beside [[Maruukai]]. You sense that she wants you to travel up to Ohn'ahra's Roost.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Divine Kiss of Ohn'ahra]]

The [[Kissed by the Wind]] achievement is also rewarded.

==Progress==
<Ohn'ahra looks at you appreciatively.>

==Completion==
<As you approach, the great ohuna spirit settles on the ground and gazes at you. Gently, she lowers her head to touch your forehead with her own. In that moment, a comfortable warmth spreads within you. The winds are now within your reach.>

==Notes==
*The quest will be offered when the player currently has all the items listed in the Objectives on hand.
