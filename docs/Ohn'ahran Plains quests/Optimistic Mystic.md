[[File:Optimistic Mystic.jpg|thumb|A [[Geyser Salamanther]] and a [[Geyser Flower]]]]

==Objectives==
Collect a Strong Salamanther Heart and 8 Geyser Flowers.
*[[Strong Salamanther Heart]]
*[[Geyser Flower]] (8)

==Description==
[[File:Geyser Salamanther.jpg|thumb|Geyser Salamanther]]
I'm sure I can find this [[Bovan Windtotem]] -- but I will need a few items from you.

First, I need a selection of flowers that grow at the base of [[Ohn'iri Springs|the springs]]. They have the specific properties we are looking for.

Next, I require the heart of a salamanther. A stronger heart will better our chances -- look for the strongest you can find!

I can gather the rest of the materials on my own.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find everything?

==Completion==
Yes, this will do nicely! Since [[Baine Bloodhoof|your friend]] does not wish to enter the springs, I've set up here.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Windsage Boku|I'll just collect my things, then we can meet at the...}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Actually, we will have to do the ritual outside the camp. Baine is... uncomfortable around us.}}
:{{text|say|Windsage Boku|How strange! Why would anyone be uncomfortable around us?}}
:''They walk off.''

Defeat [[Geyser Salamanther]]s for a [[Strong Salamanther Heart]], and [[Geyser Flower]] specimens are growing all over the [[Ohn'ir Geysers]].

Baine, Boku, and Tomul are north of the village:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|How many times have you performed this ritual?}}
:{{text|say|Windsage Boku|Counting this time? Twice.}}

Tomul has gossip here:
:Baine is still skittish, but at least he's not so huffy anymore.

:Maybe my charming personality is starting to win him over.

:<Tomul gives an amused snort.>

As does Baine Bloodhoof:
:We must hurry, <name>.

:If the Nokhud are anything like the centaur from my youth, Bovan does not have much time.
