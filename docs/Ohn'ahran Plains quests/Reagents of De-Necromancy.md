==Objectives==
Gather 4 Intact Skulls from risen companions and 6 Clumps of Sacred Soil.
*[[Intact Skull]] (4)
*[[Clump of Sacred Soil]] (6)
*Meet with Zorig further in the Eternal Kurgans.

==Description==
I fear the spirits will be unable to find their tombs, even if we release them from the [[Clan Ukhel|Ukhel]]'s grip.

The Ukhel are also raising the ancestors' animal companions who guided and protected them in life.

Bring me the skulls of those animals, and the sacred soil disturbed by these enemies. Combined, these reagents should help the ancestors find peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Do you have the reagents? We must free the ancestors before Clan Ukhel takes them away from the Kurgans.

==Completion==
Perfect! I should be able to use these to release them from the Ukhel. Then they can return to the rest they deserve.

==Notes==
On accept, Zorig equips the [[Exhumed Hunter's Spear]], runs off to the west, and despawns.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|I will make my way to the other side and work out how we might release the spirits from this magic.}}

[[Intact Skull]]s drop from [[Risen Bakar]] and [[Risen Ohuna]], while [[Clump of Sacred Soil|Clumps of Sacred Soil]] are looted from piles of [[Disturbed Sacred Soil]].

Zorig waits at the northwestern edge of the kurgans.
