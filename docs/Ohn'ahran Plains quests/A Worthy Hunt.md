==Description==
Wisdom is not gained. It is earned. If you wish to prove yourself worthy, you will do so in the manner of my people: learning as we act.

Find and hunt Thousandmile, the Elderbull, he who has escaped hunt for generations.

From this, you will gain the wisdom you seek.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:

You will receive:

==Progress==
Do you return victorious? A great hunt comes with great reward.

==Completion==
The path to mastery is slow but steady. Honor the journey.

If you seek additional wisdom, continue the good hunt. There will always be quests in the world, creatures to hunt and learn from.

And I shall be here to help you understand the knowledge you gain.
