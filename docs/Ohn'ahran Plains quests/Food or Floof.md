==Progress==
Go, before the meat gets old!

==Completion==
Oh dear. We heard his outburst. Are you okay?

==Notes==
;Speaking with Theramus
:{{Gossip|I brought your favorite food.}}
:{{Text|say|Theramus|Turtle meat? I suppose I can't say no.}}
:{{Text|say|Theramus|BLECGH. What in [[Eonar]]'s name did you do to it?}}

;After releasing the glade runners
:{{Text|yell|Theramus|What--I'm deathly allergic! Shoo, shoo! Out!}}

The quest is completed at this point, but Theramus has a new gossip:
:I don't know what you're doing here, visitor. The gardens are not open today, and I am in no mood to talk. Please go away.
