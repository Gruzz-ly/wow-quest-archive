==Notes==
[[File:Blessing of Merithra.jpg|thumb|The visual effect of Blessing of Merithra]]
On accept, Merithra casts the "Blessing of Merithra" buff on the player, causing them to glow with life energy.
:{{Abilities|Blessing of Merithra|Entrusted with the authority of the word of Merithra.|icon=inv_misc_lifeblood}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|With this blessing, <name>, my people will know that you speak with my voice. Now go, quickly!}}

;Guard-Captain Alowen
Alowen is guarding the northern path down from the sanctuary with a group of [[Emerald Scaleguard]]s and [[Emerald Warden]]s, in front of several scorched [[Primalist Invader]] corpses.
:The Primalists seem to have paused their attack. Do you bring news of their movements?

:{{Gossip|The Primalists are on the move. Merithra calls the flight to battle!}}
:{{Text|say|Guard-Captain Alowen|More bloodshed it is, then. My forces will head there at once. See you in the fray, <class>.}}
:''Alowen and her forces run down the path to the west.''

;Sariosa
Sariosa the flight master is standing just to the northeast of Merithra, next to a flock of [[Messenger Mallard]]s—three adults and one duckling.

:Greetings! Oh my, I see that you've come on behalf of Merithra. Is something wrong?

:{{Gossip|The Ancient Bough is in danger! Please help deliver the message.}}
:{{Text|say|Sariosa|Your message will be sent on the swiftest wings to the farthest reaches of the groves. Everyone must help!}}
:''She walks over to the Messenger Mallards. The adults fly away while the duckling hops and runs away on foot.''

In the area, [[Gracus]] offers a side quest: [[Some Call Me Bug Catcher]].

;Sidra the Mender
Sidra is found in the northern part of the grove, healing the wounded [[Vermera]]. She is surrounded by several other wounded Emerald Scaleguards and Wardens, one of whom is being healed by a [[Sister of the Garden]]. On approach:
:{{Text|emote|Vermera roars in pain.}}
:{{Text|say|Sidra the Mender|Easy, 'Mera. The more you stay still, the easier this will be to heal.}}

Talk to Sidra:
:The Primalists attacked us without mercy. We held our own, but it came at a heavy cost.

:{{Gossip|You are needed at the front.}}
:{{Text|say|Sidra the Mender|My sisters and I will answer Merithra's call. We will be right behind you to care for the wounded.}}

;Viranikus
Viranikus is located atop [[Merithra's Watch]] overlooking the sanctuary. [[Aronus]] offers transports to the platform if the player doesn't want to fly there on their own. Hovering in front of Viranikus are three more dragons: [[Berinus]], [[Hesthera]], and [[Fernarus]]. Talk to Viranikus:
:The Primalists are scattered for the time being. Peace descends on the Ancient Bough once more. Thank you, <race>.

:{{Gossip|The centaur clans have declared their support. Rally your troops!}}
:{{Text|say|Viranikus|You heard the <race>! To battle, dragons! Do your flight proud.}}
:{{Text|emote|Berinus roars.}}
:''The three dragons fly off to the north. After a moment, Viranikus flies after them.''
