==Objectives==
Craft or obtain [[Erden]]'s Glowspore Grip.
* [[Erden's Dreamleaf Grip]]
* [[Erden's Notes on Symbiotic Spores]] (provided)

==Description==
To craft something workable, we'll need a substantial amount of Zaralek Glowspores and some leather.

Here are my notes on the Symbiotic Glowspore Grip. Sharing this with a friendly leatherworker should give them enough info to complete a Crafting Order for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Tracking this down is a lot of work, but the quarry is worth the hunt.

==Completion==
Time for the final step. This might be a little... unpleasant.

==Progression==
