==Objectives==
Place the air totems in [[Ohn'iri Springs]] and then inform Radiya.
*[[Wind Totem|Wind totems]] placed (3)
*[[Initiate Radiya|Radiya]] informed
*Meet up with Radiya by the [[Mirror of the Sky]].

==Description==
I'm grounded indefinitely! Doesn't my Ohn know I'm turning sixteen next spring? I should be able to leave when I want to.

You look like you could help me out. I do have an escape plan: by channeling these totems, I'll concentrate the air and create quite a stir. But I can't go around placing them, because I'm under maximum wind watch. Even [[Windsage Togotseng|Togo]] won't help me.

But with your help... Please! I promise I'll show you something cool.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
If you rat me out, I'll haunt you with the windiest ghost--FOREVER! Don't do it!

==Completion==
Whew, thank you! Freedom!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Initiate Radiya|Breezy! After all's said and done, come back and I'll work my magic.}}

;Speaking with Radiya
:Fellow adventurer!

:Please save me from this torturous place they call the Ohn'ir training springs for promising young centaurs.

:{{Gossip|What will you do with these totems?}}
::Worrywart, are you? Just like my Ohn.

::The totem technique is taught to Ohn'ir Windsages. I snuck into Togo's class and picked it up on my first try.

::Relax! I'm not going to hurt anybody.

::<Radiya huffs. She looks eager for you to get going.>

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

:{{Gossip|Why are you grounded?}}
::Do I look like a criminal to you? I just wanted to see my friend. I didn't even travel that far--I could still see the geysers.

::Everyone is so strict since [[Clan Nokhud|the Nokhud]] declared war. [[Ohn Meluun]] doesn't let me do anything on my own.

::<Radiya grounds the dirt with her hooves, collecting herself.>

::So are you going to help me or not?

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

After placing the three totems in the camp, another gossip option becomes available:
:{{Gossip|The totems are placed.}}

:{{Text|say|Initiate Radiya|Time to make our escape...}}
:{{Text|say|Windsage Togotseng|What--! Where did this come from?}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Radiya|It worked! Let's hoof it!}}
:''Radiya runs out of the camp.''
:{{Text|say|Windsage Togotseng|Initiates! Contain this squall!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Initiate Chenai]]|Yes, Windsage!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Initiate Gerju]]|On it, Windsage!}}
:{{Text|say|Ohn Meluun|I know the aura of this wind...}}
:{{Text|yell|Ohn Meluun|Radiya. Face your Ohn, now. Radiya?}}
:''[[Godoloto]] flies away, in the same direction as Radiya.''
