==Objectives==
Collect 6 Flyspawn Beetle Parts.
*[[Flyspawn Beetle Parts]] (6)

==Description==
Ah, young <race>, I could use your help. I have raised generations of life here.

None more my favorite than the [[duck]]lings. But my body has grown old and weak... still that does not stop the cycle.

I need you to catch food for my brood.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is a beginning and end to all creatures. It does not matter how long or how short.

==Completion==
Oh...  Back so soon?  It only felt like a moment.

You got the good parts as well!

[[Firequackers]] and [[Pilot]] are going to love the chitin.

==Notes==
Kill [[Flyspawn Beetle]]s and loot [[Flyspawn Chitin]], [[Flyspawn Mandibles]], and [[Flyspawn Thorax]] that count as Flyspawn Beetle Parts on turn in.
