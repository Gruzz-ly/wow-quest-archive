==Objectives==
Empower the grip while surviving its union with [[Fyr'alath]].
* Survive the union with Fyr'alath.
* [[Empowered Restorative Symbiote]] (10)
* Apply [[Erden]]'s [[:Adaptive Cooling Salve]] (Optional)
* [[Erden's Symbiotic Glowspore Grip]] (provided)

==Description==
You will have to trust me. We need to activate the reagents embedded in the grip.

Wrapping the grip around Fyr'alath's haft should work, as long as you can survive the onslaught that follows. You're going to need to make adjustments as you go, and you won't get it the first time. The spores need to adapt to the axe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Attuned Glowspore Grip]]

==Progress==
Keep at it. All this hard work is going to pay off.

==Completion==
Good work. This grip should serve you well.

==Progression==
{{Fyr'alath}}
