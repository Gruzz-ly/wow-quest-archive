==Objectives==
Destroy the [[Frost Core]]s and reach [[Somnikus]].
*First Frost Core destroyed {{co|21.1|76.6|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Second Frost Core destroyed {{co|21.9|78.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*[[Frostdrake]] slain
*Speak to Somnikus in [[Lunedane]].

==Description==
We have to do something about this snow! If we're to give you proper support against [[Rymek]] and his minions, we can't have our wings freezing off.

I sense powerful Frost Cores nearby. They're probably sustaining this blizzard. If you can destroy them, we can take out Rymek's minions in short order.

And Somnikus is out there too. He flew off for Rymek like a dragon possessed. We need to get to him as soon as we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Everything hurts.

==Completion==
<Somnikus's breathing is labored and pained. He shivers with cold.>

I held him off... as long as I could.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Rymek|Hold them back! This power is almost mine!}}
:{{text|say|Somnikus|No! We can still stop him!}}

The two frost cores are on either side of the path, each guarded by an [[Azure Dragonspawn]]. Destroy both:
:{{text|say|Rymek|Don't let them past the bridge!}}
:''A Frostdrake flies down, channeling a spell.''

Get close to it and Ysera will stun it from the air:
:{{text|say|Ysera|Keep fighting!}}

Defeat it to get to Somnikus, who is not in good shape.
