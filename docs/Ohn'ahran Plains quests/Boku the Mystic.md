==Objectives==
Find [[Boku]] in [[Teerakai]].

==Description==
[[Clan Ohn'ir|The mystics]] were called away to [[Ridgewater Retreat]] a few days ago, but one [[mystic]] remains. His name is Boku. He can be found on top of the hill at the [[Ohn'ahra]]n shrine.

He's just an initiate, but he should be able to commune with Ohn'ahra and acquire her blessing. With Ohn'ahra on our side, we might be able to win this war before it starts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|62|10}}
*1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Who are you? Did Ohn'ahra send you?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Khansguard Jebotai|I should warn you. Boku has a bit of a self-confidence problem. Rest assured, he's an excellent mystic. I think.}}

Jebotai has special gossip text here:
:The other mystics were called to Ridgewater Retreat by an urgent message from [[Tigari Khan]] a few days ago.

:I thought Tigari Khan was in [[Maruukai]] the past few days but perhaps she had a change in schedule.

The shrine is at the western end of town. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Ohn'ahra, where is your song?}}

==Progression==
{{Ohn'ahra's Blessing}}
