==Objectives==
Meet [[Gerithus]] deeper in the [[Emerald Gardens]].

==Description==
The [[green dragonflight]] has many duties, not solely in the tending of the garden. We also defend the [[Emerald Dream]], and some extend their attention even further.

My son Gerithus, for example, has always had interest in all kinds of magic.

You and [[Rymek]] should seek him out, to see what he is working on and help where you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome! I appreciate that my mother has been interested in my research. Even if it's a little far-fetched.

Though I'm sure Rymek, as an emissary of the [[blue dragonflight|blue flight]], will have a much greater understanding of magic than I do. I hope that we can make some real progress.

Let's begin!

==Notes==
