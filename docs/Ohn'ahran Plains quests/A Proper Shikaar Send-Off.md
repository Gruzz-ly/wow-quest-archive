[[File:A Proper Shikaar Send-Off.jpg|thumb|Dead [[Nokhud Raider]]s with [[Shikaar Banners]] in their corpses]]

==Objectives==
Plant a Shikaar Banner on 15 slain [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] centaur or their allies.
*[[Shikaar Banners]] planted (15)
*Meet up with [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] and [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]] inside the [[Shikaar Highlands]].

==Description==
We're here to rescue the captive [[tauren]], but I have a personal request.

The place we are assaulting was once my home. The Nokhud took over after a surprise attack during the civil war.

Take these [[Clan Shikaar|Shikaar]] [[banner]]s. When you kill a Nokhud or one of their allies, plant a banner on their corpse. I want to send a message--if they continue to occupy our home, they will pay in blood.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How many banners did you place?

==Completion==
I saw the banners all across the highlands. It will not change what happened, but it puts a smile on my face.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Well then Tomul, lead the way.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|When we fight the Nokhud, remember--I'm the "good" centaur. Don't hit me!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I... shall do my best.}}
:''They walk off to the northeast.''

Use the provided [[Shikaar Banners]] on the corpses of the [[Nokhud Dominator|dominators]], [[Nokhud Galebringer|galebringers]], [[Nokhud Raider|raiders]], and [[Primalist Stormsage|stormsages]] in the occupied village in the [[Shikaar Highlands]].

Catch up with Baine, Tomra, and [[Nawa]] in a small tent south of the main village:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Have you seen Bovan? Does he yet live?}}
:{{text|say|Nawa|They took him... I don't know where....}}

Nawa has this to say:
:Our captors have interrogated us about the dragons, the other centaur, why we are here... when Bovan revealed he was the leader, they took him away....
