==Objectives==
Extinguish fires across the djaradin camp.
*Extinguish Fires (0/100%)

==Description==
The [[djaradin]] are setting [[Ohn'ahran Plains|the Plains]] ablaze with the reckless use of fire magic. We must act before these small sparks grow into a raging wildfire.

A deep pool of fresh water can be found not far from here. Skim the surface on your drake to collect as much as you can carry, then fly over the djaradin camp to douse any flames beneath you.

This won't be enough to put out the larger blazes, but it will buy us time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Quickly, before the blaze spreads!

==Completion==
I could see the plumes of steam from here. Excellent work, <name>.

==Notes==
The nearest water is in the river to the south. Skim over it while dragonriding, then fly back over camp and use the extra action button near fires.

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
