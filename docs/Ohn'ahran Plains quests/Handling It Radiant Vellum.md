==Objectives==
Craft or obtain Shalasar's Sophic Vellum.
* [[Shalasar's Sophic Vellum]]
* [[Shalasar's Notes on Sophic Magic]] (provided)

==Description==
We can refine my creation by embedding the enchantment with [[Arcane|Order magic]].

Here are my notes on Concentrated Sophic Vellum. Sharing this with another friendly enchanter should give them enough info to complete a Crafting Order for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've seen students become... disenchanted... with this type of task, but I know you're made of sterner stuff.

Sorry. I've been in isolation for a long time, and I don't get to use that "joke" very often.

==Completion==
We're almost there. Now we just need to coax the competing shadowflame and Order magic to cooperate.

==Progression==
