==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Overseer Zambul.jpg|Overseer Zambul|Overseer Zambul leads the Nokhud effort to recover ancient weapons in the Eternal Kurgans.}}
Defeat [[Overseer Zambul]].
*[[Overseer Zambul]] slain

==Description==
Good work. Those desecrators cannot force any more of my ancestors to fight for them. But the brute yelling out their orders must be handled.

That is their overseer, Zambul. He must be stopped.

Take him down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|53|82|96}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Did you give Zambul the end he deserves?

==Completion==
An [[Clan Ohn'ir|initiate]] must not take pleasure in the death of another Maruuk. But Zambul makes that a challenge.

==Notes==
