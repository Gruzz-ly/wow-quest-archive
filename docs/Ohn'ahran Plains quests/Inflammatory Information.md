==Objectives==
Eavesdrop on [[Fyrakk]] and [[Vyranoth]].
*Eavesdrop with [[Shandris]]
*[[Larodar]] defeated

==Description==
<Shandris whispers to you.>

Do you see that up ahead? The [[Druids of the Flame]] have captured what appears to be a [[Keeper of the grove|keeper]]--a guardian of nature, sacred to [[Night elf|our people]]. If their power is already enough to...

<Shandris shakes her head, then gestures at the dense shrubbery nearby.>

Stay hidden with me and we will listen to [[Primal Incarnates|the Incarnates]], and perhaps discern what the druids intend to do with the keeper.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I will hold off any reinforcements that come. Deal with the keeper!

==Completion==
I had feared what we might learn today, but this...

<Shandris tightens her grip on her bow to steady herself.>

This is beyond anything we could have prepared ourselves for.

==Notes==
Stand in the [[Concealing Shrubbery]] between Shandris and the Incarnates to start [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|an in-engine cutscene]]:

:{{text|say|Fyrakk|The burning might of our new allies.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|What have you done to this creature?}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Imbued it with the living flame.}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|The very flame we will infuse into the heart}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|of their precious [[Amirdrassil|world tree]].}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|[[Iridikron]] entrusted us to deny [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]] their prize,}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|not twist it into some vile abomination.}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Iridikron isn't here anymore.}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Besides, he is the one who set me free.}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Who begged me to drink deep of the [[shadowflame]].}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|He knew what was necessary to win this war.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|We took up arms together to free [[Azeroth|the world]] from the [[titan]]s' meddling.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|That is the war I fight.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|That is the victory I seek.}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|(growls)}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|We CANNOT achieve victory}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|with our hands bound by your ideals!}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Indeed.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Then our course is set.}}

After the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Those druids have opened portals here! We cannot return the way we came.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I will hold off anything that comes through. Dispatch the keeper quickly! Then we can escape.}}

Run northeast up the hill, where [[Larodar, Keeper of the Flame]] attacks! During the fight, Shandris will keep [[Enflamed Summoner]]s who appear through the portals at bay.
:{{text|say|Larodar, Keeper of the Flame|Arise, my children! Unleash your raging flames! Feed these lands with the ashes of those who oppose us!}}
Attack the four [[Rupturing Firevine]]s around him to fend him off:
:{{text|say|Larodar, Keeper of the Flame|[[Emerald Dream|The Dream]]... calls to me... I must answer...}}
:''Larodar casts Dreamway of the Flame and teleports away.''
