==Objectives==
Speak to [[Gerithus]], and fly with [[Merithra]] and [[Ysera]] to [[Lunedane]].
*Speak to Gerithus
*Meet Gerithus at Lunedane.

==Description==
If we are to eradicate the [[Primalists]] from the [[Emerald Dream]], the one place we must secure is Lunedane. According to my son, that is where [[Rymek]] has gone.

It is the last line of defense for the nascent Tree. There, an ancient artifact shields the Tree from being found. And, it is powerful enough to expel all our enemies at once.

I do not know if my mother has the power to command and use it anymore. But we will deal with that once we have found and stopped Rymek.

Fly with us, as one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This place is our last line of defense.

==Completion==
We've made it. But Rymek has already started his assault. We can't let him break through!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Let's go! My scales are starting to freeze.}}
:''Ysera and Merithra walk a few steps away, shift into their dragon forms, and take off.''

Speak with Gerithus:
:We must reach Rymek before he finds what my mother hid in the Dream.

:{{gossip|I'm ready to fly to Lunedane and face Rymek.}}
:''The player hops on Gerithus's back and the dragon takes off, catching up to Ysera and Merithra, flying in formation with them.''
:{{text|say|Merithra|The ancient defense at Lunedane is all that stands between Rymek and [[The Sisters' Tear|the World Tree]].}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|And it will be his undoing. But only the Dreamer can unleash its full potential.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Then we must get you there at once.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|No. It is clear that I am no longer connected to the Dream as I was. Someone new must rise.}}
:{{text|say|Gerithus|There! The battle is already raging!}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|I see [[Somnikus]] on the bridge. He is injured. He needs our help!}}
:''Gerithus breaks off, dropping off at the ledge.''
:{{text|say|Gerithus|Taking you down, <name>. We will keep the skies clear while you engage on the ground.}}

The adventurer is in the [[Emerald Dream]] version of [[Lunedane]]. In the skies, an [[Ice Protodragon]] is engaged in combat with [[Merithra]], while [[Turbulent Gust]]s fight against [[Emerald Drake (Ohn'ahran Plains)|Emerald Drakes]] and [[Emerald Serpent]]s.
