[[File:A Place of Refuge.jpg|thumb|[[Scout Tomul]] and some [[Bloodied Brave]]s outside [[Toghusuq Village]] with [[Baine Bloodhoof]] and [[Tagar Bloodhoof]] in the background.]]

==Objectives==
Meet [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] and [[Scout Tomul|Tomul]] at [[Toghusuq Village]].

==Description==
Our next priority is to catch up with the others who fled during [[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan's]] stand. Hopefully, Bovan and the other [[brave]]s have regrouped with them.

This Tomul says the most likely place the [[tauren]] would seek refuge is an abandoned village to the southeast.

While her reasoning is sound, this is also the perfect location for a trap.

<Name>, I know you vouch for her, so I will give her the benefit of the doubt.

Let us hope your trust in her is not misplaced.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The good news is that we have found the other tauren.

The bad news is that this Bovan he seeks isn't here.

The irritating news is that everyone wants me dead.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Are you always so distrustful of people you've just met?}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Only when they are centaur. Or [[murloc]]s.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|Sounds like there's a story behind that. Care to share?}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Hmph. Not today.}}
:''The centaur and collected tauren walk south.''

Catch up with Tomul just outside [[Toghusuq Village]], where two [[Bloodied Brave]]s are prohibiting her entry:
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|There you are! I was beginning to worry. As you can see, we've found more people who don't like me.}}
