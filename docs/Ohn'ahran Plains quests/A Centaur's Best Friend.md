==Objectives==
Free [[Khasar]] and meet him in the cave.
*Free Khasar{{Co|80.57|30.74|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Free [[Baba]]{{Co|83.4|32.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
It isn't safe for us to remain in the open, <name>.

The [[gorloc]]s forced my hunting companion, Baba, into a cave to the east.

Set me free, then we shall rescue Baba. I will meet you in the cave when the path is clear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|10|50}}
* 3,750 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
Together, Baba and I are one hunting unit greater than all the rest.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. We are safe in here and can speak freely.

I will protect Baba from any gorlocs that dare venture in while he rests.

==Notes==
Interact with [[Khasar's Cage|the cage]] to open it. Khasar walks off to the south and despawns.
:{{Text|say|Khasar|Thank you, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Khasar|Wait just a little longer, Baba! I will save you!}}

Baba is locked in a cage in a cave at the southern end of the village. As soon as the player frees him, Khasar enters the cave and Baba starts excitedly jumping and running around him.
:{{Text|say|Khasar|Baba!}}
:{{Text|emote|Baba jumps with excitement.}}
:''Khasar walks further into the cave and sits down. Baba continues running in circles around him.''
:{{Text|say|Khasar|Rest now, Baba. Here we are safe. I will protect you.}}
:''Baba lies down next to him.''
