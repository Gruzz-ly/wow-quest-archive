==Objectives==
Herd the lost [[argali]] back to [[Clan Aylaag]].
*[[Aylaag Shepherd]] spoken with
*[[Wandering Argali]] returned to the herd

==Description==
Some of the clan's argali have wandered away from our flock again.

The ridge around us is too dangerous for our shepherds to search for them. It would be a great boon if you could take one of our [[bakar]] and bring back the argali. Our shepherds can point you in the right direction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Maruuk Centaur Commendation]] (+75)
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
Have you found them?

==Completion==
We must be vigilant about our livestock. We are limited in resources to begin with. To lose an argali is a setback we would much like to avoid.

==Notes==
;Speaking with an Aylaag Shepherd
:Ah, the traveler who has pledged their assistance.

:Take one of our bakars and search for the clan's missing sheep. Lead them back here.

Interacting with them provides an [[Aylagtu Sheepdog]] as a companion. Find the missing argali further west and direct it back to the targeted areas.
