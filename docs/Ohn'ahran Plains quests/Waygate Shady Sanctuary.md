'''Waygate: Shady Sanctuary''' is one of several quests that can be chosen when you unlock an additional [[Ancient Waygate]] beyond the first two. Waygate unlocks happen at Renown levels 8, 10, 15, 17, 20, and 23 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].

==Objectives==
Locate the [[Dormant Waygate]] at the [[Shady Sanctuary]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].
*Waygate activated
*[[Enchanted Arcana Vessel]] (provided)

==Description==
Our expedition reports a dormant stone out in the lush hillsides to the southwest. It's quite a journey, but worth sendin' someone with yer knowledge tae investigate.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Ancient Waygate: Shady Sanctuary|Unlocks access to the Shady Sanctuary waygate.|id=391652|icon=ability_socererking_arcanewrath}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well? Get on with it!

==Completion==
Looks like it worked!

I'll keep the vessel safe in case we'll be needin' it again.

==Notes==
Interacting with the Dormant Waygate will cause you to channel {{abilities|Effuse Arcana|id=390525|icon=ability_socererking_arcanereplication}} on it for 8 seconds. After the cast finishes:
:{{text|emote|The waygate whirls with arcane energy as it activates.}}
