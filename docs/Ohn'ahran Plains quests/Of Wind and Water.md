==Objectives==
Collect reagents from the [[Roaring Dragonsprings]].
*[[Springborn Core]] (8)
*[[Windtossed Feather]] (5)

==Description==
To the east is a great dragonspring which serves as a nesting area for wild [[eagle]]s. The feathers they shed still contain their [[magic]] for quite some time and are used in many rituals.

The area also hosts raging spirits of the elements, and their cores are of some use as well.

Bring a collection of both back to me - and remember that the eagles are sacred, I will not accept feathers that are gathered from their harm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]
*Gear piece

==Progress==
Have you found everything?

==Completion==
These reagents will be used to initiate new members into [[Clan Aylaag|our tribe]]. I will repay this debt.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
