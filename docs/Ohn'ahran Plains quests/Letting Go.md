[[File:Letting Go.jpg|thumb|The funeral pyres lit]]

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Baine Bloodhoof]] about the funeral.
*Speak to Baine
*First pyre lit
*Second pyre lit
*Third pyre lit
*Final pyre lit
*Funeral concluded

==Description==
[[Clan Shikaar|The Shikaar]] lost two of their own during the battle. All of [[Scout Tomul|Tomul's]] reinforcements... they volunteered to help, of their own will.

I... have much to consider.

After speaking with the Shikaar, we decided to honor our dead together. We have blended our funerary rights into one ceremony for this occasion.

We would be honored if you would stay and participate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These [[centaur]]... may the [[Earth Mother]] embrace them.

==Completion==
[[Bovan Windtotem|Bovan]] is gone, but his people remain. Why did he bring them here? What did he see in his visions?

The [[Windtotem]] have always been nomads. Perhaps he saw that they might finally find a home.

Or... did he know what would happen with the centaur? Did he bring us here to make peace with them? Or to make peace with the hatred in our own hearts?

All I know for certain is I must continue to live according to his ideals. In that, I can honor his life and memory.

==Notes==
Speak with Baine again:
:We should begin shortly. Do you have time to join us?

:{{text|say|[[Tagar Bloodhoof]]|We are here together in the sight of the ancestors to honor our fallen. Bovan Windtotem, Karuul Windtotem, Borke of the Shikaar, and Joshi of the Shikaar.}}

Light the [[Centaur Pyre|pyres]]:
#{{text|say|[[Shikaar Ranger]]|[[Joshi]] was my mentor. Though strict and severe, he had a kind heart. He taught and cared for the orphans of the clan. I will carry on his legacy.}}
#{{text|say|Shikaar Ranger|My sister [[Borke]] loved animals. She would nurse any injured animal back to health, whether [[bakar]] or [[ottuk]]. Her compassion will live on in me. This I promise.}}
#{{text|say|[[Koya Windtotem]]|My husband [[Karuul Windtotem|Karuul]] filled our lives with silly jokes and laughter. I hear his voice in my daughter's laughter, and I will remember him always.}}
#{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Bovan... my friend. He once rescued me from certain death. He asked for nothing in return. I live a life dedicated to courage, humility, and honor, because of him. I can never repay him. But I hope that my words and my deeds honor his memory, always.}}

Let the funeral finish:
:{{text|say|Tagar Bloodhoof|Honored ancestors, welcome our loved ones at your hearth. May their spirits know peace, their deeds be remembered, and their memories live on through us.}}
