==Objectives==
Place incense and clear out [[ghost]]ly beasts from the [[Eternal Kurgans]].
*[[Aylaag Incense]] placed (6)
*Risen beasts slain (8)

==Description==
One tradition for [[Clan Aylaag|the Aylaag]] as we stay at this camp is for our members to make the pilgrimage to the Eternal Kurgans to ask for journeys safe from that which plagued our ancestors. The presence of the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] has made this pilgrimage perilous.

If you do not mind, I would ask you would uphold our tradition for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
Clan Nokhud and [[Clan Ukhel|Ukhel]] desecrate the spiritual land just by their presence.

==Completion==
I owe you much. It is hard to ask an outsider for help with something so important to our clan, but I do not see another option.

==Notes==
Kill [[Risen Bakar]] and [[Risen Ohuna]].
