==Objectives==
Collect 4 totems from [[gorloc]] [[shaman]]s.
*[[Mudfin Totem]] (4)

==Description==
Of all the madness in [[Mudfin Village|this gorloc village]], I have discovered none so troubling as the gorloc shamans.

They are particularly vicious and play recklessly with storm magic with no regard for the consequences.

This must be put to an end. Slay them, and bring me their totems. Our mystics will be interested in them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 7,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
The gorloc shamans have gone too far.

==Completion==
<Khasar frowns at the totems.>

These totems are for storm magic. Storm magic is sacrilege to the gift of winds given by [[Ohn'ahra]] herself.

I will deliver these to the mystics.

==Notes==
The totems drop from [[Mudfin Shaman]] throughout the village.

==Progression==
{{Mudfin Village}}
