'''The Nokhud Offensive: The Wind Belongs to the Sky''' is an optional dungeon quest offered after completion of [[Renewal of Vows]] at the end of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]].

==Objectives==
Defeat [[Balakar Khan (tactics)|Balakar Khan]] and rescue [[Ohn'ahra]] in the [[Nokhud Offensive]].

My scouts report that Balakar has withdrawn into [[Nokhudon Hold|his stronghold]], where he is holding Ohn'ahra. This is unacceptable!

Meanwhile, his Nokhud raiders storm across the plains wreaking havoc. While we engage them in battle, you could infiltrate the Nokhud stronghold and rescue Ohn'ahra. Will you do this for us?
