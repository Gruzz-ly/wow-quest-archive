==Objectives==
Mount an Overladen Mammoth and return it to your lines.
* Liberate an [[Overladen Hauler]]
* Return the mammoth to safety

==Description==
The [[djaradin]] have loaded a mammoth with the spoils of their labor here for delivery to [[Fyrakk]].

Redirect that shipment. We can make use of whatever supplies they've gathered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|684|53}}
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
It should be hard to miss. They are quite large, after all.

==Completion==
Excellent, this should put a mammoth dent in their operations.

==Notes==
Find an unfriendly [[Overladen Hauler]] north of the quest area. Hop on, then run it back to the Khanam Matra. Occasionally:
:{{text|bossemote|A tarasek boarder is attempting to dismount you! Knock it off by attacking it first!}}

A [[Tarasek Boarder]] hops on and winds up Throw Off!:
:{{abilities|Throw Off!|Throw a mammoth thief off their stolen mount!|id=405784|image=|notes=6 sec cast}}

Attack it and it'll stop.

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}
