'''Up to No-khud''' is an optional breadcrumb to "The Eternal Kurgans" storyline in the [[Eternal Kurgans]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Initiate Zorig]] at the Eternal Kurgans.

==Description==
The [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] and [[Clan Ukhel|Ukhel]] clans have overtaken the Eternal Kurgans. Their purpose can only be malign. Our most esteemed ancestors are buried there.

I sent Initiate Zorig to investigate. He still has not returned.

He is capable, but lacking in confidence. Please help him put a stop to their foul activities!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
Clan Ukhel dishonors itself with dark magic. Now they have moved into the [[kurgan]]s with their Nokhud allies. Neither clan should be here! I've been watching from here, where I'm safely out of sight.

==Notes==
Upon approaching Elder Yuvari
:{{Text|say|Elder Yuvari|Outsider! We need your help to prevent an atrocity!}}

Zorig is in a small camp by the lake on the eastern end of the Eternal Kurgans. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|What should I do?}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Zorig|What would Yuvari do if he were trying to stop this?}}

==Progression==
