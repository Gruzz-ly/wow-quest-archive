==Objectives==
[[File:Empowerment Totem.jpg|thumb|An Empowerment Totem]]
Place the Empowerment Totems around [[Boku]].
*[[Empowerment Totem]]s placed (4)

==Description==
War? [[Dragon]]s? You need me to contact [[Ohn'ahra]]?

I can't. I can't hear Ohn'ahra at all. I'm just an initiate, and it seems like Ohn'ahra has withdrawn her blessings from me. Maybe I'm not good enough...

<Boku starts digging through a satchel.>

When [[Tigari Khan|my mentor]] assigned me to [[Clan Teerai|this clan]], she gifted me with these totems. She said they would empower me if ever I doubted myself.

Will you help me place them? I will try to call upon Ohn'ahra one more time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|10|50}}
*4,700 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Completion==
Still nothing. Not even a sigh from Ohn'ahra.

==Notes==
On accept, Boku starts channeling wind magic:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Place the totems while I try again to commune with Ohn'ahra.}}

Interact with the four ghost [[Empowerment Totem]]s around the shrine to place them. First totem:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Ohn'ahra, heed me. Your people need you!}}

Second totem:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|Have I offended you, Windmother?}}

Third totem:
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|I am just a lowly initiate. I need your guidance!}}

After placing the fourth totem, Boku stops his channeling.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Boku|I hear nothing. I'm not fit to be a [[mystic]].}}

==Progression==
{{Ohn'ahra's Blessing}}
