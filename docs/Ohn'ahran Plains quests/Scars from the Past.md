[[File:Scars from the Past.jpg|thumb|[[Scout Tomul]] and [[Baine Bloodhoof]]]]

==Objectives==
Ask the [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk centaur]] about the disappearance of [[Bovan Windtotem]].
*Speak to the [[Khanam Matra Sarest|Khanam Matra]] {{co|60.0|37.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Speak to [[Sansok Khan]] {{co|63.4|41.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
*Speak to [[Scout Tomul]] {{co|62.4|41.7|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
A [[Windtotem tribe|tribe]] of [[tauren]] came to the [[Dragon Isles]] led by a close friend of mine, Bovan Windtotem. No one has heard from them since they entered these plains.

If they have gone missing, then I must find them. Unfortunately, I underestimated the size of this place.

You have an existing relationship with the [[centaur]]. Will you go speak with them and see if they have any information on Bovan or his tribe?

Perhaps they can help narrow down my search.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|4|50}}
*4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Thank you for your help. I would be... uncomfortable dealing with the centaur directly.

==Completion==
I sent you to get information, not to invite one of them to join us! Can you not just send her home?!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I will wait here. I... prefer to avoid centaur camps. Difficult memories.}}

[[Khanam Matra Sarest]] is at her usual spot upstairs in the main building of [[Maruukai]]:
:This is not a good time, <name>. What is it?
:{{gossip|quest=|<Ask about Bovan Windtotem and his tribe.>}}
:{{text|say|Khanam Matra Sarest|Unfortunately I cannot help you. Despite [[Balakar Khan|Balakar]]'s death, the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] are still a thorn in our side. Most of the plains is contested territory and my forces are stretched thin. Perhaps Sansok Khan can offer some aid.}}

[[Sansok Khan]], [[Okir]], and [[Basran]] are at their usual spot on the southeastern rise of Maruukai. Speak with Sansok:
:<As Sansok Khan signs, Okir vocalizes.>
:It is good to see you again, friend. What brings you to Maruukai?
:{{gossip|quest=|<Ask about Bovan Windtotem and his tribe.>}}
:{{text|say|Okir|I know nothing of your missing friends, but Tomul might. She has led our scouting efforts and would best be able to aid you. Tell her that she is to assist you in this matter with whatever you need.}}

[[Scout Tomul]] is at her usual spot just downhill to the west by [[Trainer Frodrum]]:
:Let me guess, more trouble.
:{{gossip|quest=|<Ask Tomul about the missing tauren and relay Sansok Khan's request.>}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|We have our hands full with these Nokhud hit and run raids, but if the khan commands it, then I will help. Let me gather some scouting reports. I will meet you and your friend outside the city.}}
:''Tomul runs off.''

Catch up with Tomul and Baine where Baine was previously:
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Absolutely not! I will not have you following us about like a watchdog!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Tomul|You don't want me here. I don't want to be here. But my khan commanded me to help you with this, and that is exactly what I am here to do.}}

After turning in, Baine has gossip:
:Centaur cannot be trusted!

As does Tomul, when she starts the next quest:
:Your friend doesn't seem to like me. To be honest, few people do.

:<Tomul shrugs.>
