'''A Useful Curiosity''' becomes available at [[Renown]] Level 11 with the [[Maruuk Centaur]].

==Completion==
<Name>, you are in luck. One of our crafters created shoes we think you could use. Sky only sees why, but your service to the clan has inspired at least one of us.

However, as much as I'd like to, we can't simply give them away. It was costly to create just a single pair of your unusual footwear. But they will be here if you should need them.
