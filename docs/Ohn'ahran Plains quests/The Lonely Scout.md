==Objectives==
Speak to [[dryad]]s in [[Shady Sanctuary]].
*Speak to [[Sister of the Garden|Sisters of the Garden]] (2)
*Speak to [[Erynna]]
*Return to [[Scout Santuun]].

==Description==
I know, I know, it's silly. A [[centaur]] and a dryad, right? We can't be more different.

But ever since I first laid eyes on the [[Emerald Gardens]], I really have wanted to get to know one better. I just can't seem to say or do anything to keep them interested in me.

I've heard they're into... plants. And cute baby [[animal]]s. And maybe killing [[poacher]]s, but I don't even know where to start.

Please, you can talk to them, right? Could you ask around and find out what they like? Then maybe I can have a shot.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|10}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck? Please tell me there's hope.

It would just be so nice.

==Completion==
Flowers!!

<[[Scout Santuun]] smacks her palm on her forehead.>

It's so obvious. I was overthinking it, like I always do.

Thank you, <name>, you're the best!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Scout Santuun|Do dryads like hunting trophies? Ballads? Pet [[squirrel]]s? By the talons of [[Ohn'ahra]], how am I going to catch a pet squirrel?! Oh this might be hopeless.}}

Head to section with [[Tryanikus]] and speak with the Sisters there:

:{{Gossip|<Ask if dryads like centaurs rescuing cute baby animals.>}}
::Don't worry about the baby animals! We've got that covered! I would worry about those big centaur hooves accidentally stomping on one...

:{{Gossip|<Ask if dryads like impressive hunting trophies.>}}
::No! Don't kill the poor animals just for a trophy! That's horrible.

:{{Text|say|Erynna|What's this about a centaur?}}

;Speaking with Erynna
:{{Gossip|<Ask what dryads like if, hypothetically, a centaur wants to impress one.>}}
::<Laughs brightly.> Oh that's easy! I would be very impressed if a centaur brought me flowers!

::<Erynna lowers her voice.> You can tell her that all of my favorites are blue.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Scout Santuun|Blue flowers... blue flowers... have to find some blue flowers. Thanks again!}}
:''Santuun runs away.''
