==Objectives==
Slay [[primalists]] in the [[Storm Scar]].
*[[Howling Heart]] (8)

==Description==
I've heard words on the wind of outsiders allying with [[Clan Nokhud]] in an effort to defeat our [[dragon]] neighbors. These Primalists are a blight on the plains of our ancestors.

Slay them, and bring me the cores of the [[elemental]]s they command.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
*[[Maruuk Centaur Commendation]] (+75)
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
The dragons and our kin have long held peace. This threat to such cannot be ignored.

==Completion==
Hopefully that keeps [[Clan Aylaag|Aylaag]] safe from the dragons' ire. Unfortunately we cannot offer anything beyond this meager assistance.

==Notes==
Kill [[Primalist Stormsurger]]s, [[Primalist Stormfury|Primalist Stormfuries]], and [[Primalist Storm-Summoner]]s.

==Patch changes==
