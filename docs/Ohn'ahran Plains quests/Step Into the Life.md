==Objectives==
Fight your way across the [[Emerald Dreamway]] with [[Ysera]] and enter [[Ancient Bough]].
*Cross into the Emerald Dreamway
*Emerald Dreamway cleared (0/100%)
*First Infused Anchor placed {{co|65.8|50.5|Emerald Dreamway}}
*Second Infused Anchor placed {{co|46.5|39.6|Emerald Dreamway}}
*Third Infused Anchor placed {{co|58.6|81.9|Emerald Dreamway}}
*Cross Over Into Ancient Bough {{co|31.8|22.7|Emerald Dreamway}}
*Meet Ysera in Ancient Bough via Ardenweald and the Emerald Dreamway.

==Description==
We mustn't delay. I can feel the energies of rebirth surging in me. I am ready to cross back into the [[Emerald Dream]].

From the realms of [[Death]] into [[Life]].

Follow me through the gate of Awakening, and we will race across the Dreamway to Ancient Bough. I expect there will be some resistance within, so be on your guard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must reach the other side of the Dream.

==Completion==
It is worse than I feared. I can destroy the ice that surrounds the grove, but there are too many enemies upon us. And we need to find a way to bring down the barrier that keeps the others out.

We must work quickly and vanquish these foes, so Merithra and the others can reinforce us.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ysera|Stand back, <name>. I think it's time to spread my wings.}}
:''Ysera shifts into her dragon form.''
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|The cycle is renewed. Death and Life in harmony once more.}}
:''Ysera flies south into the Emerald Dreamway as the Winter Queen walks east a few steps before teleporting away.''

Head south to the Emerald Dreamway, where an [[Extra Action Button]] appears:
:{{Abilities|Cross Over|Cross over into the Emerald Dream.|id=373025|icon=inv_legion_faction_dreamweavers}}

Use it to cross over into the Emerald Dreamway, set within the Dreamgrove:
:{{text|say|Ysera|Place the anchors, and I will try to find my way to you in the Dream.}}

While in the Dream for this quest, players are buffed with Dreaming:
:{{Abilities|Dreaming|In the Emerald Dream, can walk on water, healing for 5% every 4 seconds.|id=373030|icon=inv_legion_faction_dreamweavers}}

Take advantage of this to fill the bar by killing [[Arctic Summoner]]s (7-8%), [[Drenched Rager]]s (5-6%), and [[Freezing Front]]s (5%), and destroying [[Frost Shard (Emerald Dreamway)|Frost Shards]] (4%). All enemies drop a [[Slumbering Dream Fragment]]. Combine five into a [[Renewed Dream]], which contains an [[Emerald Green Apple]] and a [[Mote of Dreams]]. Save some Renewed Dreams for the next quest, however.

Make sure to interact with the [[Infused Anchor]] ghosts to place them, in any order:
:{{text|say|Ysera|The enemy's forces spread. They are searching for something. But this place is a verdant labyrinth, and it will take time to find what they seek.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Strange. My connection with the Dream feels different somehow.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|There. That is the path to the Ancient Bough. Let us break their grasp on the grove.}}

Once the bar is full and the three anchors have been placed, head to the northwest corner of the map and interact with the Dream Portal to cross back to the [[Ancient Bough]]. There, Frost Shacklers are winding up pot-shots on Ysera, but she blasts them with a breath attack to obliterate them.
