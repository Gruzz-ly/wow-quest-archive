==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] forces.

==Description==
[[Balakar Khan|Balakar]] disgraces his clan. He leads them into the storm, blinded by his lust for power.

Their betrayal reveals their fragility. Cut them down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|21|}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]

==Progress==
To attack [[Khanam Matra Sarest|the Khanam Matra]]... it is a rejection of our ways.

==Completion==
The path they have chosen is now stained with blood.

[[Scout Tomul]] tried to warn us this might happen. She may have further suspicions.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Balakar Khan|You pathetic excuses for [[centaur]] are beneath me. [[Guard Bahir|Bahir]]! Take care of these weaklings.}}

[[Nokhud Betrayer]]s, [[Nokhud Reaver|Reavers]], and [[Nokhud Storm Adept|Storm Adepts]] all count for the quest. [[Scout Tomul]] at the base of the [[krutal]] offers [[Covering Their Tails]].
