'''The Price of Peace''' concludes the storyline of ''[[Battle for Azeroth]]''.

==Objectives==
Witness [[Anduin Wrynn|King Wrynn]]'s address.
* Speak with [[Mathias Shaw]]

==Description==
The king will be addressing us shortly with news from his diplomatic mission to the [[Horde]].

The other leaders of the [[Alliance]] have already arrived. I am sure they are eager to hear what King Wrynn has to say.

Speak with me when you are ready, and we will greet the king together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Speak with me when you are ready, and we will greet the king together.

==Completion==
Hmm... the meeting did not seem to go quite as the king expected. We know where [[Genn Greymane|Genn]] and [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] stand, but I wonder what the others have to say.

==Notes==
Speak with Shaw again:
:It's good to be back in [[Stormwind]]. [[Kul Tiras]] has its charms, but these walls will always be home.
{{gossip|I am ready to meet with King Anduin and the leaders of the Alliance.}}
:''A cutscene plays as the adventurer and Shaw walk in to the embassy. The leaders of the Alliance and allied factions are present: [[Genn Greymane]], [[Prince Erazmin]], [[Gelbin Mekkatorque]], [[Aysa Cloudsinger]], [[High Exarch Turalyon]], [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], [[Shandris Feathermoon]], [[Muradin Bronzebeard]], [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Falstad Wildhammer]], [[Prophet Velen]], [[Captain Fareeya]], [[Jaina Proudmoore]], and [[Valeera Sanguinar]].''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The armistice is signed. At long last, the [[Fourth War]] is over.}}
:''The leaders clap for a moment before Tyrande unleashes some of her Night Warrior powers, darkening the room for a second.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|No. Not while the [[Army of the Black Moon|Black Moon]] still cries out for vengeance. Not until the Horde has answered for its treachery.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Further bloodshed will not bring back the fallen. We must renew our hope and forge a future for those who survived.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|And when the next [[warchief]] musters an army, will hope save you if it is [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] that burns?}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I know it's difficult to trust, but there are signs of change within the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|In place of a warchief, there is now a [[Horde Council|council]] led by Baine, Thrall, and the others. I believe they can--}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Your faith is naive, lion son. I will sign no treaty unless it is written in the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee]]'s blood!}}
:''Tyrande storms off, Shandris on her heels, and the other leaders follow her lead to exit, leaving just Anduin, Genn, and Jaina.''
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|There is truth in her words, Anduin.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Peace may be on the table today, but soon enough the Horde will sound their drums and march for war.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|When that day comes, no scrap of parchment will hold them back.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The path to peace will not be easy, and not all will choose to walk it.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But this is the only way to build a better future. I believe it will work, Genn.}}
:''Genn clenches his fist and walks away. Anduin speaks once more, if only to himself.''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It has to.}}

[[File:Valeera and Shaw.jpg|thumb|Master Mathias Shaw and Valeera Sanguinar]]
On complete:
:{{Text|say|[[Valeera Sanguinar]]|The bitter war is over, yet it seems few among us are in the mood for celebration. Our young king least of all.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|A great weight rests upon King Anduin's shoulders. I fear his burden won't get lighter anytime soon.}}
:{{Text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|And what of you, Shaw? What is there for Stormwind's spymaster to do in a time of peace?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|You know as well as I that a true spy never rests. There is always a new conspiracy to uncover. That said, I may find a bit of time for myself.}}
:{{Text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|Just yourself?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|There is [[Flynn Fairwind|someone]] I would like to... get to know better. But such things are best taken slowly. Carefully.}}
:{{Text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|Spoken like a true spy. Just remember, happiness is a fleeting thing. Find it while you can, Shaw.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Perhaps I will, Valeera. Perhaps I will.}}

===Additional dialogues===
====Gossip====
Most of the NPCs have special gossip:
;Anduin Wrynn
:We have faced much together, <name>. You have always been a noble friend and ally.
;Genn Greymane
:In order to preserve peace, we must prepare for war.
;Tyrande Whisperwind
:I will not stand idle while Sylvanas roams free and the crimes against my people remain unpunished.
;Shandris Feathermoon
:Although the Kaldorei suffered greatly in this war, it is time for us to heal and rebuild.
:We can still look to the future without forgetting the past...
;Muradin Bronzebeard
:Peace with the Horde?
:I'd be lyin' if I told ye that I trust 'em after all they've done...
:But who knows? Maybe with the Banshee Queen gone, they'll finally be able tae live peacefully. An' if they do go back tae their old ways, the Bronzebeard Clan will be here to put 'em in their place!
;Moira Thaurissan
:The Alliance an' Horde have both suffered terribly in this war, an' mistakes were surely made on both sides.
:What matters now is how we move forward! Do we learn somethin' from all o' the bloodshed an' loss, or do we keep on repeatin' the past?
;Falstad Wildhammer
:So it's peace now, eh? After all that?
:Ach, well, it's worth a shot I guess. I can forgive... but a Wildhammer never forgets!
;Jaina Proudmoore
:This moment of peace was hard fought and so much was sacrificed to bring it to fruition. It must not go to waste.
;Prophet Velen
:I once told you that each of us must forge our own fate in this world.
:The time has come for the Horde to forge their own fate as well. Without a warchief to command them, they must learn to walk a new path.
:Will it be a path of peace or a path of war? Only time can tell where it will lead.
;Valeera Sanguinar
:If history has anything to teach us, it is that peace between the Alliance and Horde is perilously short-lived.

====Shandris and Tyrande====
[[File:Shandris and Tyrande.jpg|thumb|Shandris and Tyrande]]

Shandris and Tyrande, in a lean-to by the bonfire, have a dialogue:
:{{Text|say|[[Shandris Feathermoon]]|You spoke harshly to King Anduin, Tyrande. The [[Night elf|kaldorei]] can ill afford to shun the Alliance. They have provided aid and comfort to us in these dark times.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The young king is foolish to trust our enemies. Harsh words should be the least of his fears.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The Banshee Queen no longer leads the Horde. Those who do seem more inclined toward peace than war.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|If the wolf is rabid, it matters not who rides it. Sooner or later, the beast will bare its fangs.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You are dearest to my heart, Tyrande. I beg you, let go of the Black Moon's rage and embrace the mother's light once again. I could not bear to lose you to darkness.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Know this. My hunger for vengeance will not be sated so long as Sylvanas Windrunner remains free--and until I know why [[Elune]] abandoned her children.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Tyrande! Do not say such--}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I will tarry no longer in this city of men. Let us leave for the boughs of [[Nordrassil]].}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|From there we will dispatch the [[Sentinels]] to every corner of [[Azeroth]]. Let no one rest until the Banshee is found!}}

====Jaina and Anduin====
[[File:Jaina and Anduin.jpg|thumb|Jaina and Anduin]]
Jaina and Anduin, in the tent by the innkeeper, have several dialogues:

;About Taelia
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I saw you speaking with a messenger from Kul Tiras, Jaina. Is everything alright?}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Nothing to worry about. It was a letter from a [[Taelia|certain eager cadet]] asking to see Stormwind... and to learn more about [[Bolvar Fordragon|her father]].}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Taelia. Please tell her that this isn't a good time for visitors.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|She deserves to hear the truth, Anduin. From you.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|[[Tirion Fordring]] himself made us swear that we would keep the secret of Bolvar's fate. You made that vow just as I did.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|I remember [[Varian Wrynn|your father]] once telling me that the hardest thing about a promise isn't keeping it, but knowing when it's right to break it.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Bolvar was a noble man. To know that he [[Lich King|sits frozen]] upon that [[Frozen Throne|accursed throne]], devoting his very life to keeping the [[Scourge|monsters]] at bay...}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It breaks my heart. I can't bear to see it break Taelia's, too.}}
: ''Jaina exhales a sigh through her nose.''
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|The decision is yours, Anduin. But if she learns that the truth was kept from her, it will hurt her all the more.}}

;About troubles
:{{Text|say|[[Jaina Proudmoore]]|The [[N'Zoth|Old God]] has been vanquished. The Alliance and Horde have ended hostilities.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|This should be a day of celebration, Anduin. Yet you wear your troubles like a crown.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'm so glad that after all you endured, you have found peace within your heart, Jaina. I can't say the same about myself, though. Not yet.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Sylvanas is out there somewhere. Until she's brought to justice, I don't think Tyrande or Genn will truly consider the war to be over.}}
:{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|The [[Kul Tiran fleet]] is scouring the seas, and Shaw has spies searching every dark corner of Azeroth. She can't hide for long.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I don't believe she will. Which is exactly what concerns me.}}

====Alleria and Turalyon====
[[File:Alleria and her statue.jpg|thumb|Alleria and her statue in the Valley of Heroes]]
In the [[Valley of Heroes]], [[Alleria Windrunner]] and [[High Exarch Turalyon]] are standing by Alleria's statue. Speak with her:
:<Alleria's eyes drift from the statue's cold stone visage down to [[Ranger Captain Alleria Windrunner#Valley of Heroes monument|the plaque engraved with her epitaph]].>
{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{text|emote|Alleria sighs, her brow furrowed.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I thought I'd find you here. It's a place you often visit when something's on your mind.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Perhaps these statues remind me of a... simpler time.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|So much has happened since our return to Azeroth. The wounding of the world... the war against the Horde...}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|War I understand. We both do. But I expected to be fighting with two sisters at my side. Instead, I faced one of them in battle--or at least, what remains of her.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Has the downfall of the Old God brought you at least a measure of peace?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The whispers did not end with his defeat. In fact, it seems new voices have joined the chorus. When I think of the nightmares he forced into my mind...}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I witnessed them, too. But they didn't shake my faith in you. Not for a moment.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Nor mine for you, my love. Enough reflection. We have a job to do--hunt down Sylvanas... and make her pay.}}
