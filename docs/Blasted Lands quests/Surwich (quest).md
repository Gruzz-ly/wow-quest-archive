==Objectives==
Report to [[Mayor Charlton Connisport]] at [[Surwich]] in Blasted Lands. 

==Description==
Other than what you've seen, the [[Dark Portal|Portal]]'s been surprisingly quiet. There isn't much more work I can give to you, I'm afraid.

If you're looking for trouble, you might try the [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilnean]] fishing village to the southwest. [[Surwich]], I think it was.

I know we're supposed to be friends with the Gilneans, but really? [[Worgen]]? I had enough trouble getting used to the [[draenei]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||45}}

==Completion==
Welcome to Surwich, <race>.  Please, have a look around.
