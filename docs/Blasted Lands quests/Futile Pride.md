==Objectives==
Kill a Dreadmaul Ambusher in [[Dreadmaul Hold]].
*[[Dreadmaul Ambusher]] slain

==Description==
This is actually an old [[orc]] city... one of the oldest on [[Azeroth]]. That is, it was until the [[ogre]]s pushed us out.

Today's [[Horde]] refuses to be pushed over by ogres. My troops and I took the town back by force, and the ogres who once lived here now work as my servants. Now, our real work begins.

You look strong enough, but I'd like to see some proof. Kill one of the ogres that still besiege us, and return to me.  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40|}}
*4,050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Is that ogre blood I smell?  It had better be...

==Completion==
Well done, <race>.  You've proven that you can take down an ogre... no small feat.  Now let's see if you can take down an Alliance iron mine... 

==Progression==
{{Dreadmaul Hold quest chain}}

==Notes==
During the {{expac|Cataclysm}} beta, Dreadmaul Hold was renamed [[Rockard]], and the quest text stated, "Rockard is actually an old orc city...". When the town was renamed back to Dreadmaul Hold, the name was removed from the quest text.
