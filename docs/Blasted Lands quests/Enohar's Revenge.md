== Objectives ==
Poison the [[Dreadmaul tribe|Dreadmaul ogre]] food supply.
*Poisoned [[Cooking Pot (Blasted Lands)|cooking pot]] x3

== Description ==
They... they killed [[Keri Thunderbrew|my sister]]. Those beasts marched right through the front gates and... it was horrible.

The Dreadmaul ogres stood beside them during the attack. They will all suffer. Here take this poison, place a couple drops in their rat stew. The poison will slowly eat away at their insides. Causing a prolonged and painful death, just like they deserve.

Please, for my sister.

*{{cost|11|40}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to drop the poison into their food supply?

== Completion ==
I wish I could be there to watch their faces as they suffer. I hope they all die a slow horrible death.

== Notes ==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Enohar Thunderbrew|Those ogres deserve a slow painful death. This poison will insure that happens.}}

Pick up [[Toothsmash the Annihilator (Alliance)]] and [[Death to the Dreadmaul (Alliance)]] before heading out.

West into [[Dreadmaul Post]]. Plenty of ogres to kill on the surface, as are the three ogre cookpots, which are arranged in a roughly north-south line. [[Toothsmash the Annihilator]] is between the two southern cookpots.
