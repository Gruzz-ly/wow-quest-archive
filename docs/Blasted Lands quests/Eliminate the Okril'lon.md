== Objectives ==
Slay 9 Okril'lon Infantry at the [[Nethergarde Supply Camp]].
* [[Okril'lon Infantry]] slain (9)

== Description ==
The [[Horde]] are a nuisance that we will deal with, but they are proving more difficult than previously expected. You are to put a stop to this. 

To the west of [[Nethergarde Keep|Nethergarde]], the Okril'lon main forces press on our defenses. They currently hold the [[Nethergarde Mines]], and they mean to move into the supply camps and, eventually, the Keep. Thin their numbers and delay their advance, <name>. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Nethergarde Bracers|Nethergarde Belt|Nethergarde Boots|Nethergarde Gloves}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|65}}

==Progress==
What are you waiting for, <name>? Get out there and FIGHT!

==Completion==
You're an excellent asset to the [[Alliance]] and the [[Kirin Tor]], <name>.  Well done.

With time, our forces will retake the mine and press these Horde dogs out of the [[Blasted Lands]]. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[Nethergarde Reigns]] and [[Remove Their Arms]] before leaving.

Kill infantry while doing the other two quests. Most of them will be occupied with Nethergarde's troops, so you can fight at your leisure.
