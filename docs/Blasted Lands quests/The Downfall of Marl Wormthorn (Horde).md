==Objectives==
Kill [[Marl Wormthorn]] at [[Maldraz]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].  You can use the [[Demoniac Vessel]] to pull him out of his trance.

==Description==
Wormthorn's unnatural forest threatens our excursion's progress. His trees' roots break our picks, his moss grows over our excavation sites, and his animals attack my men. When it comes to digging, I'll take a demon-infested wasteland over a forest any day.

Take the demoniac vessel and use it on Marl Wormthorn to pull him from his trance. Return to me when he is no more.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pauldrons of the Trove
|Shoulderguards of Tarnished Healing
|Sunveil Breastplate
|Wormthorn Gloves#Horde}}
You will also receive: {{cost|2|65}}

==Progress==
I haven't time for this, <name>. You came here for a reason, and it wasn't to chat. Get back to work.

==Completion==
Hopefully, with this [[druid]] out of the picture, we can get back to our digging. The world is full of powerful artifacts, <name>. You just need to be willing to do what it takes to get to them.

Feel free to take one of these. The [[Reliquary]] is always happy to share some of its trove with fellow members of the [[Horde]].
