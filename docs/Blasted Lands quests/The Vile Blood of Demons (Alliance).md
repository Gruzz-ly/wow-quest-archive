==Objectives==
Obtain 7 bottles of Vile Demonic Blood.
*[[Vile Demonic Blood]] (7)

==Description==
[[Kasim Sharim|Sharim]] wants demon blood. Speaking personally, the stuff does not even seem like blood to me - more like liquid rot - but that is of no consequence.

Luckily for you, the area around the [[Dark Portal]] is crawling with [[demon]]s. [[Infernal]]s, [[felhound]]s, [[felguard]]s... they've all got what you need, in copious, pustulent amounts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||85}}
*10,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Ugh, what's that smell?  Is that you, or the blood?

==Completion==
There is no doubt about it, you have found demon blood.

Kasim's requests aside, I am sure that my [[Watch Commander Relthorn Netherwane|Watch Commander]] is thankful for your efforts.  They have been struggling to deal with these demon distractions for some time now.
