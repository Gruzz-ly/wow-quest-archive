== Objectives ==
Kill an Okril'lon Scout outside of [[Nethergarde Keep]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Okril'lon Scout]] slain

== Description ==
[[Nethergarde Keep|Nethergarde]] has stood steadfast for years against the [[demon]] onslaught that plagues this land. Our watch is never-ending, our vigilance unfaltering, and our courage bottomless.

We have held these lands since the [[Dark Portal|portal]] opened, but now these [[Horde]] insects have the insolence to stand in our way!? We have protected THEM as well as we have protected ourselves!

<Lungertz looks you over.>

Let's see if you've got a hand for combat. Slay one of the Horde's Okril'lon scouts that nibble at our perimeter.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||60}}

== Progress == 
What's the matter, too scared to fight?

I should have known not to trust an outsider <class> like you. Best leave Nethergarde's defenses to its own men.

== Completion ==
Hmm... not bad.  You're quicker than many of my men.  Stick around, <name>... I may have use of you yet.

== Notes ==
The scouts are just outside the western walls of the keep. They are stealthed.
