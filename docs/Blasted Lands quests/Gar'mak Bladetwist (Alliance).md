== Objectives ==
Kill Gar'mak Bladetwist.
*[[Gar'mak Bladetwist]] slain {{coords|40.2|11.3|Blasted Lands||1}}

== Description ==
With the intelligence you have gathered we have learned this assault is being led by a powerful [[Iron Horde]] orc named [[Gar'mak Bladetwist]]. He is bunkered down inside [[Okril'lon Hold]].

Killing him will not win this war, but it will surely breakdown the Iron Horde's communication. This will buy us valuable time while we gather more forces and outline a battleplan to deal with this new threat.

== Rewards ==
All abilities will be unlocked.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

== Progress ==
I fear this war has only just begun.

== Completion ==
It was an honor fighting alongside of you, <name>.

== Notes ==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|I will meet you at Okril'lon. We will take down Gar'mak together.}}

To the northwest. Enter [[Okril'lon Hold]] and get to the top floor of the keep to find [[Gar'mak Bladetwist]]. Aggro him and Maraad will run up the stairs:
:{{text|yell|Vindicator Maraad|This madness ends now, Gar'mak!}}

Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Gar'mak is dead. You fought well today. Meet me back at camp.}}

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|With Gar'mak dead the Iron Horde will be in disarray until they appoint a new leader here on Azeroth. Althought we have won this battle, I fear the war has just begun.}}
