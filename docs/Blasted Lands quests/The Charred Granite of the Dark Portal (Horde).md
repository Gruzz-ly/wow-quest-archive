==Objectives==
Obtain 24 Charred Granite Chips.
*[[Charred Granite Chips]] (24)
*[[Portal-Sentry's Mining Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
Loramus wants us - er, YOU - to gather granite chips from these chunks of rock around the Dark Portal. I don't know what he'd want rocks for, but I have my suspicions, and they're not pleasant ones.

Use this pick and look for small outcroppings of rock along the edge of the portal's blast radius.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||85}}
*10550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
Keep it down, would ya?

==Completion==
I hope this is what he needs.  We probably don't have time for you to return and mine any more.
