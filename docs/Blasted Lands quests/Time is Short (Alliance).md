==Objectives==
Deliver the Discordant Rune to [[Watcher Grimeo]] at the [[Dark Portal]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Discordant Rune]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Razelikh]] plans to return to the Blasted Lands and overwhelm [[Azeroth]] with his [[demon]]s. Even now, he is preparing to summon his legions to eliminate us. With these three amulets, we have the method to summon him... but no way to destroy him.

<The [[gnome]] quickly draws a rune in the air, then hands it to you.>

Deliver this to Grimeo at the Dark Portal, to the southeast. He will guide you. Quickly! Time is short! And so am I!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||21}}

==Progress==
Do I know you, good <race>? 

==Completion==
No, no, no... not [[Kasim Sharim|Kasim]] again!  This is madness!

Please, remain quiet.  If my commander learns that I still work for the short one, do you know how quickly I will be removed from the watch?

<Grimeo takes the rune from you, presses it to his chest, closes his eyes, and sighs.>

I see you speak the truth.  Let us begin our business quickly, so that it may end even quicker.
