==Objectives==
Use Buttonwillow's Hand Grenade on 8 Okril'lon Weapons Crates in the Nethergarde Supply Camp.

Make sure to use the grenades from afar, or you will be blasted.
*Okril'lon Weapons Crate (8)
*[[Buttonwillow's Hand Grenade]] (provided)

==Description==
Say there... <name>, is it? I've got a proposition for you which involves explosions. Interested?

I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with the [[Quartermaster Lungertz|quartermaster]]. You see... I've been working on an explosive device. It's not very effective against other creatures, but devastating against artillery. If you're heading back into the field to visit those [[orc]]s, find some enemy supplies and give this thing a try. Who knows... maybe they like explosions too.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
How did it go out there?

==Completion==
Ahh, the sound of things going boom makes my heart pitter-pat.  You've made this [[gnome]]'s day, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Nethergarde Reigns]] and [[Eliminate the Okril'lon]] before leaving.

The weapons crates are all throughout the Nethergarde Supply Camp. They are wooden crates with the red [[Horde]] symbol on them. The grenade has a minimum distance, so you will need to be somewhat far away to be able to blast the crate.
