==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Razelikh the Defiler.jpg|Rakh'likh|Your knowledge of his true name shall prove to be his undoing.}}

Speak with the [[Deathly Usher]] north of the [[Rise of the Defiler]]. Once atop the Rise, destroy [[Razelikh]]'s body, then use the Stone Knife of Sealing to imprison his soul.
*Razelikh's body destroyed
*Razelikh's soul imprisoned
*[[Stone Knife of Sealing]] (provided)

==Description==
Hero, listen well.

First, we must travel to the Deathly Usher, who waits at the northern foot of the Rise of the Defiler, to our northwest. The usher will take us to the top of the rise. Once there, you will help me defeat Razelikh, for I fear I am not strong enough to defeat him alone.

Most importantly, I need you to hold the stone knife, and do not use it until I tell you to. The knife will trap Razelikh's soul within its new, eternal prison.

If we succeed, speak with [[Watcher Grimeo|Grimeo]], the [[draenei]].

==Progress==
You again? Has Kasim found more work for me?

==Completion==
Loramus, resurrected!?  And then he trapped the demon inside his own body... by the [[Light]]...

I see.  So this was Kasim's plan all along.  I suspected correctly, but I suppose I refused to believe it.

Ah, one last thing!  Kasim left one more instruction for me within his rune.  I did not understand it at first, but given the events that have taken place today, it now makes much more sense:

He asked me to let you choose from one of these.

==Notes==
The [[Deathly Usher]] is located in the northeastern part of the [[Rise of the Defiler]]. Once you have found him, speak to him:
:''I am bound eternally to this cursed world. What is it you desire, mortal?''
::{{gossip|I wish to face the Defiler.}}

Choose the gossip option to be transported to the top of the Rise, where Rakh'likh awaits. After the fight, you can return here by jumping down the north face partway, where there is a bright blue rune on the ground. Step on the rune to be transported back to the ground.

;Before the fight begins:
:{{text|say|Loramus Thalipedes|Demon! I have returned from beyond the grave to destroy you!}}
:{{text|say|Loramus Thalipedes|Death has not erased my memory. I still know your name...}}
:{{text|yell|Loramus Thalipedes|RAKH'LIKH! Come, and know demise!}}
:{{text|yell|Razelikh the Defiler|Fool of a demon hunter.  How many pieces must I cut you into this time?}}

Rakh'likh will turn hostile, and can potentially attempt to knock the player off the Rise. If this occurs, Loramus will pull the player back:
:{{text|yell|Loramus Thalipedes|Hold on!}}
:{{text|yell|Loramus Thalipedes|Return to me!}}
:{{text|yell|Loramus Thalipedes|Ah! Get back over here!}}

Eventually, Razelikh will stop the fight and address Loramus directly.
:{{text|yell|Razelikh the Defiler|Enough games!}}
:{{text|say|Razelikh the Defiler|What's this? Loramus... I see, they used the [[Altar of Storms (Blasted Lands)|Altar of Storms]], didn't they?}}
:{{text|say|Razelikh the Defiler|You must feel it already then... the demonic energy entering your heart, your lungs, your soul...}}
:{{text|yell|Razelikh the Defiler|Allow me to speed up the process a bit!}}

Razelikh will then possess Loramus, who becomes Loramus the Defiled and turns hostile.
:{{text|say|Loramus the Defiled|Now, heroes! Finish me, while Rakh'likh possesses my body!}}
:{{text|yell|Loramus the Defiled|[Demonic] Lok zenn Za enkil refir mordanas lok zenn (SWEET SASSY MOLASSEY THE PAIN!)}}

After wearing down Loramus the Defiled, the following will occur:
:{{text|say|Loramus the Defiled|Quickly! Use the knife on me! Time runs short!}}
:Use the [[Stone Knife of Sealing]] to defeat Loramus the Defiled!
:''When used, the player leaps forward, stabbing the knife into Loramus' chest.''
:{{text|say|Loramus the Defiled|It is done. Leave me here, then, while I wrestle with Rakh'likh in the next world. Your job here is done, heroes.}}
