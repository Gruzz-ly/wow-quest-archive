==Objectives==
Kill 3 [[Ironmarch Executioner]]s
*Stop the Executions (3) {{coords|59|27|Blasted Lands||1}}

==Description==
We arrived as soon as we could... but we are too late. [[Nethergarde]] has fallen. The [[Iron Horde]] has taken a number of Nethergarde warriors prisoner.

No doubt they are trying to squeeze vital information out of our troops.

I fear once they are done with their interrogation they will not hesitate to execute their prisoners. Time is running out.

==Rewards==
You will gain the following spells:
*Advanced Combat Mechanics
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 XP

==Progress==
Did you kill the Ironmarch Executioners?

==Completion==
The prisoners are shaken up, but they are free. Their families are in your debt, <name>.

==Notes==
:''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Bodrick Grey|Nethergarde has lost so much already, I can't stand to see them lose more.}}

Pick up [[Subversive Scouts (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Head northwest towards [[Nethergarde Keep]]. In a small area south of the keep in a ravine, look for [[Ironmarch Executioner]]s with [[Nethergarde Prisoner]]s in their sights. Take out the executioners.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Bodrick Grey|Hopefully the prisoners you saved will have an opportunity to rebuild Nethergarde to its former glory.}}
