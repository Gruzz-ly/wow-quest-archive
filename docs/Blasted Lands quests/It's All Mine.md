'''It's All Mine''' is a Horde quest completed alongside [[Pick Your Fate]] in the [[Blasted Lands]]. Together, they task the hero with sabotaging the [[Alliance]] mining operation in the [[Nethergarde Mines]].

As of December 2024, multiple players have reported extremely slow respawns for the Ore Heap objectives of this quest. Together with the small number of spawn locations, it is impossible to complete it in one sweep through the mines. A break of about 10 minutes is necessary for the Ore Heaps to respawn.

==Objectives==
Use the Concentrated Solvent on 6 Ore Heaps in the [[Nethergarde]] Mines.
*Ore Heap dissolved (6)
*[[Concentrated Solvent]] (provided)

==Description==
All over this cavern you'll find unguarded piles of ore, just waiting to be tampered with. Our first choice would be to steal the ore, obviously, but that requires mine carts, protection, and labor... three things we just don't have. So instead, we're just going to ruin this little mining party with a little bit of highly corrosive solvent.

Take this bottle - CAREFULLY - and pour it onto those heaps of ore. 'Cause if we can't have this ore, then neither can they.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||85}}
*8170 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
I wouldn't store that solvent where I store my potions, if I were you.

==Completion==
There's nothing quite like a big fat kick in the wallet, is there, you [[Alliance]] lunkheads?!

==Progression==
