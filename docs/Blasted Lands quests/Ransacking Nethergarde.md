== Description ==
After the [[Iron Horde]] took [[Nethergarde Keep|Nethergarde]] we attacked. While we killed the [[Iron Horde]] at Nethergarde they brought more forces through the portal and took [[Okril'lon Hold]]. So many souls stripped of their bodies by those savages.

We must not forget those that gave their lives at Nethergarde. If you find any mementos of the fallen, bring them back to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

== Progress ==
Did you find anything?

== Completion ==
Throm-Ka, <name>. These mementos will forever remind us of our champions.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Lunatic Lieutenants (Horde)]] and [[Attack on Nethergarde]] before heading out.

Northeast to Nethergarde. [[Rukah the Machinist]] is outside the west entrance, and she drops [[Rukah's Battleplan]]. Head inside and look to the right (south) by the picnic table next to the wall. On the ground is [[Neka's Poison Flask]] next to [[Neka]]. Enter the still-standing keep to the north, but before going in, plant the flag just outside, then head inside the keep and upstairs to the throne room to find [[Gar Steelcrush]], who drops [[Gar's Battleplan]]. Exit the keep to the northeast and enter the [[Blacksmith|smithy]] to find [[Strumner Flintheel]] with [[Strumner's Sword]] in his back. Behind the smithy to the north, find [[Mokrik Blackfingers]]. Back to the south, plant the next flag outside the ruined keep, then head further south to plant the last flag at the ruined entrance. Finally, loop back to the northwest to find [[Krolan's Shield]] on the ground in the ruined keep next to [[Sergeant Krolan]].
