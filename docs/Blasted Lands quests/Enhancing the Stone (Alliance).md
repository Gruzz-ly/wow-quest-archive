==Objectives==
Bring Grimeo's Package to [[Kasim Sharim]] at the [[Serpent's Coil]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Grimeo's Package]] (provided)

==Description==
<Grimeo finishes packing the materials up in a neatly-wrapped package.>

That's all the [[gnome]] asked of us. When you see him, make sure you let him know that this task ends my debt. I will not suffer his requests any longer.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progress==
You've returned, <class>.

==Completion==
This is sufficient.  If you see Grimeo again, you may tell him that he performed satisfactorily, but no... his debt is not yet cleared.  I will get to work on fashioning the stone knife of sealing.  There is no need for questions now.  All will be revealed in time.

While I work, I have another task for you to complete.

Don't look so upset!  This task will be fun... it involves collecting body parts.
