==Objectives==
Kill the [[Tainted Black Bear]]s, [[Tainted Nightstalker]]s, and [[Tainted Screecher]]s in the [[Tainted Forest]], and try to assemble their parts into a [[:Demoniac Vessel]].

==Description==
We need a way to get [[Marl Wormthorn|Wormthorn]]'s attention.  Something to break him out of his trance.  Something that's guaranteed to work.

The few types of wildlife that managed to make a foothold in the Tainted Forest are, without a doubt, affected by the land's latent energies.  Your task is to collect their body parts and find a way to combine them into a vessel.  If Wormthorn's trance is [[druid]]ic, or even if it is [[demon]]ic, a large enough vessel of tainted animal flesh should be able to break it.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|75}}

==Progress==
Dawnflight's plan is a good one. Do you have the vessel, <name>?

==Completion==
Brilliantly done, <name>. We have what we need to break the [[worgen]]'s trance.

==Progression==
