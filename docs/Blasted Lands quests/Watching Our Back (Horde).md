==Objectives==
Examine the Alliance Plans at the [[Dark Portal]] without getting caught.
*Examined the [[Alliance Plans]]

==Description==
<[[Warlord Dar'toon]] speaks in hushed tones.>

I have orders from... higher up... that you would be suitable for. I've seen the [[Alliance]] periodically referring to a stack of papers on that barrel over there. I'd like you to take a look at those papers and find out what it is that they're plotting. My duty and station prevent me from such a questionable task, but a newcomer like you might be able to slip in unnoticed...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dar'toon's Cloak
|Gloves of Foolish Innocence
|Harmless Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
Did you get a look at those plans, <name>?

==Completion==
You're certain nobody saw you?  Good.

<Dar'toon listens to your recount of the information you saw.>

Hmph... fairly harmless stuff.  Either the Alliance are foolish enough to NOT be planning something against us... or they're hiding their information better than I expected.  Either way, well done, soldier.
