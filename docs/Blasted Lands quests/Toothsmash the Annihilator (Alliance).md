== Objectives ==
Kill Toothsmash the Annihilator
*[[Toothsmash the Annihilator]] slain {{coords|43.7|36.3|Blasted Lands||1}}

== Description ==
If the battleplans you brought back are true, the [[Dreadmaul tribe|Dreadmaul ogres]] are as much to blame for this devastation as the [[Iron Horde]]. It's time we send those ogres a message.

It looks like the Iron Horde's main contact is a large ogre in Dreadmaul named Toothsmash. Killing him will put a dent in their battleplans.

== Rewards ==
You will unlock Level 15 talents.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

== Progress ==
Did you kill Toothsmash?

== Completion ==
Toothsmash is dead? Good, I'm sure it will take the Iron Horde a while to find another ogre smart enough to help them with their efforts.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Death to the Dreadmaul (Alliance)]] and [[Enohar's Revenge]] before heading out.

West into [[Dreadmaul Post]]. Plenty of ogres to kill on the surface, as are the three ogre cookpots, which are arranged in a roughly north-south line. [[Toothsmash the Annihilator]] is between the two southern cookpots.
