==Objectives==
Sabotage 3 Iron Demolishers.
*[[Iron Demolisher]]s destroyed (3)

==Description==
Those [[Iron Horde]] cannons are laying waste to our troops. I'm not sure how much more of this we can handle. Our forces are already spread too thin.

There has to be a way to stop those war machines.

==Rewards==
You will gain the following spells:
*Sustained Combat
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 XP

==Progress==
Those war machines are decimating us.

==Completion==
It will take the Iron Horde quite a while to get those demolishers operational again. Throm-ka, <name>.

==Notes==
:''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Thrall|We cannot win this battle if those Iron Horde war machines remain operational.}}

Pick up [[Attack of the Iron Horde (Horde)]] before heading out. Then go northeast to the [[Shattered Front]] and start killing and interacting with three siege tanks.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Thrall|With those machines destroyed we can focus our next move.}}
