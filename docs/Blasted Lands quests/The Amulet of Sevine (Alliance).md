== Objectives ==
Obtain the Amulet of Sevine from {{NPC||Salt-Flop}} near the [[Shattershore]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Amulet of Sevine]]

== Description ==
The second amulet, Sevine's amulet, is in the hands of a [[murloc]], far to the south, on a shelf that overlooks the Shattershore. How it ended up in that murloc's possession, I cannot say, but I can state with certainty that you will find it there.

Bring her amulet to me, along with the rest.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Sevine's amulet... along with the others, we can summon the Defiler. 

== Completion ==
<Kasim hefts the amulet.>

A [[warlock]]... and a powerful one at that.  I will hold onto this until the time is right. 

== Notes ==
On reaching the top of the shelf, you will see [[Salt-Flop]], a friendly murloc surrounded by baby murlocs. 

:{{gossip|Murloc, I know that you hold the Amulet of Sevine. I need it.}}
::Fine! Amulet take, but <race> help Rockpool.

He will give you the amulet without protest. His quests can be done now or saved for later.
