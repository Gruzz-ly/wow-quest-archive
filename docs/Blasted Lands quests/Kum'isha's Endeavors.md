== Objectives ==
Bring the Flawless Draenethyst Sphere to [[Kum'isha the Collector]] in [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Flawless Draenethyst Sphere]]

==Description==
A glimmering sphere sits before you. You sense that this item would be of great value to someone within the Blasted Lands.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Emerald Encrusted Chest
}}

==Progress==
Have you found a flawless [[draenethyst]] sphere?

==Completion==
Simply amazing.  I had doubted that anyone could find another sphere, yet here it is, pulsating in my hands.

Well done, <name>!

Should you find anymore--and I believe this to be an impossibility--return them to me and I shall reward you again.
