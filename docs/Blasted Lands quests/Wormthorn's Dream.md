==Description==
Not surprisingly, most of our citizens in [[Surwich]] did not come to the [[Blasted Lands]] for the pleasant atmosphere. They came following the dream of an idealistic [[druid]]: [[Marl Wormthorn]]. Wormthorn believed that the [[Tainted Scar]] could be healed, and attempted to grow it back.

It looks like he was wrong. He grew his forest, but the land is still plagued by [[demons]], and his great-tree is twisted and gnarled.

I'm still hopeful. Maybe if we head into the Tainted Forest and clear out some of the taint... 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|75}}

==Progress==
<Charlton is thinking to himself.>

Marl, what have we done?

==Completion==
You say the demons were worshipping the tree?

<The mayor sighs.>

It is as I feared, then.
