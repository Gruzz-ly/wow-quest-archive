== Description ==
No number of [[naga]] deaths will bring back the Rockpool tribe, but any amount of revenge will help the spirits of my people rest more easily.

Many of the more powerful Bloodwash have set up a fortress in the caverns to the northwest. Slay them, in the name of the Rockpool. The remaining Bloodwash have erected gladiatorial pools and Azsh'ir altars on our beach, where they pit my people against one another and worship their false god. Slay them, in the name of [[Neptulon|the Tidehunter]].

== Progress ==
Revenge, <race> friend, is my final request.

== Completion ==
The last Rockpool may be taken hostage today and killed tomorrow, landwalker... but they will pass into the underworld knowing that a brave <race> avenged their death.  Thank you.
