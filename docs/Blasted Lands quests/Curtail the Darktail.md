==Objectives==
Use Enohar's Explosive Arrows to slay 20 Darktail Bonepickers in the [[Shattershore]].
*[[Darktail Bonepicker]] slain (20)
*[[Enohar's Explosive Arrows]] (provided)

==Description==
The other thing that concerns me about those shipwrecks is all the vultures that they've attracted. Knowing how those birds operate, they've already picked the bones clean, but still... we can't allow them to further desecrate the bodies of our friends.

Before I brewed, I hunted. Here, take this bow, and more importantly, these arrows. They've been laced with a little concoction that should give those bonepickers a surprise.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Bonepicker Bracers|Darktail Belt|Enohar's Old Hunting Boots|Gloves of Compassion}}

You will also receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress== 
It breaks a [[dwarf]]'s heart to think about those poor travelers.

==Completion==
It's a tragedy, what happened on the Shattershore.  They weren't even soldiers... just people looking for a new home.

I think we've done all we can, <name>.

==Notes==
Be sure to pick up [[Our Fallen Friends]] before heading out.

Kill ghosts at the shore. Once you've cleared out a safe area near the ships, stop to take out Bonepickers with the bow. Target the birds flying in the sky; they're far away, but the bow has quite a long range and may be able to reach the required number from a single spot. It should one-shot them, although it can miss; if it does, it will [[aggro]] the vulture. The bow can be fired again after a short cooldown to try to one-shot it again before it reaches the attacker, or else it can be killed through normal combat. They only drop loot if killed normally.
