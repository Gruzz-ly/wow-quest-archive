==Objectives==
Kill the [[Tainted Black Bear]]s, [[Tainted Nightstalker]]s, and [[Tainted Screecher]]s in the [[Tainted Forest]], and try to assemble their parts into a Demoniac Vessel.
*[[Demoniac Vessel]]
*[[Tainted Hide]] (4)
*[[Nightstalker Leg]] (20)
*[[Screecher Brain]] (2)

==Description==
We need a way to get [[Marl Wormthorn|Wormthorn]]'s attention. Something to break him out of his trance. Something that's guaranteed to work.

The few types of wildlife that managed to make a foothold in the Tainted Forest are, without a doubt, affected by the land's latent energies. Your task is to collect their body parts and find a way to combine them into a vessel. If Wormthorn's trance is druidic, or even if it is demonic, a large enough vessel of tainted animal flesh should be able to break it.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|75}}

==Progress==
Shayana's plan is a good one. Do you have the vessel, <name>?

==Completion==
<Mayor Charlton Connisport looks warily at the device you've assembled.>

Very well, <name>.  We have what we need to break Marl's trance and put an end to both him and his experiment.
