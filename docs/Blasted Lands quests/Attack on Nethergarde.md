== Objectives ==
Plant the Horde flags inside [[Nethergarde Keep]].
*Flag planted at Nethergarde entrance {{coords|63.0|22.5|Blasted Lands||1}}
*Flag planted in the center of Nethergarde {{coords|61.6|18.5|Blasted Lands||1}}
*Flag planted outside of the main keep {{coords|59.9|15.8|Blasted Lands||1}}

== Description ==
The [[Iron Horde]] controls [[Nethergarde Keep]], but they are fools if they think we will let them retain such a strategic position.

My best troops are more than eager to spill the blood of those savages, but we need a champion like yourself to lead the charge.

== Rewards ==
You will gain the following spells:
*Cooldowns
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
How goes the battle, <class>.

== Completion ==
The Iron Horde will learn to fear us, as they should.

== Notes ==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Thrall|Plant the Horde flags inside Nethergarde. Our men will do the rest.}}

Pick up [[Lunatic Lieutenants (Horde)]] and [[Ransacking Nethergarde]] before heading out.

Northeast to Nethergarde. [[Rukah the Machinist]] is outside the west entrance, and she drops [[Rukah's Battleplan]]. Head inside and look to the right (south) by the picnic table next to the wall. On the ground is [[Neka's Poison Flask]] next to [[Neka]]. Enter the still-standing keep to the north, but before going in, plant the flag just outside, then head inside the keep and upstairs to the throne room to find [[Gar Steelcrush]], who drops [[Gar's Battleplan]]. Exit the keep to the northeast and enter the smithy to find [[Strumner Flintheel]] with [[Strumner's Sword]] in his back. Behind the smithy to the north, find [[Mokrik Blackfingers]]. Back to the south, plant the next flag outside the ruined keep, then head further south to plant the last flag at the ruined entrance. Finally, loop back to the northwest to find [[Krolan's Shield]] on the ground in the ruined keep next to [[Sergeant Krolan]].
