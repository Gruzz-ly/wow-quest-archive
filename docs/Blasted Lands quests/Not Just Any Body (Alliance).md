==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Loramus Thalipedes.jpg|Loramus Thalipedes|The demon hunter in life.}}
Find Loramus' Head, Loramus' Torso, and Loramus' Legs.
*[[Loramus' Head]]
*[[Loramus' Torso]]
*[[Loramus' Legs]]

==Description==
We need [[Loramus Thalipedes]], the [[demon hunter]]. He knows [[Razelikh]]'s true name, and as you know: if you know the name of the [[demon]], you have power over it. The problem is that Loramus has been killed, and his body torn apart.

If you bring me the pieces, we still have a recourse. All three pieces are in the west... the [[Dreadmaul]] [[ogre]]s hide them in their caves. Move quickly, for much like [[Watcher Grimeo|Grimeo]], Loramus also owes me a debt...

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
Trust me... whatever happened to Loramus, we can fix.  The limits of [[blood magic]] are still undefined.

==Completion==
I see... yes, I can work with this.

<Kasim looks at the [[night elf]]'s head.>

Loramus Thalipedes, demon hunter.  I look forward to our reunion.

==Notes==
On leaving [[Kasim Sharim]]'s cave, head west to the road, then south around the hill and to the area west. Once in the ogre camp, there will be three caves. Each cave holds a body part. The caves to the north and south are small. The one to the west is larger; after entering take a left to find the body part.
