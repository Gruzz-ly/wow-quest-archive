==Objectives==
Bring Loramus' Body to the [[Altar of Storms (Blasted Lands)|Altar of Storms]], then protect it while the ritual completes.
*[[Loramus Thalipedes|Loramus]] resurrected
*[[Loramus' Body]] (provided)

==Description==
Up on the bluffs to the west lies a powerful altar. A powerful DEMONIC altar, guarded by cultists, but powerful nonetheless. If you can reach it, you can use it to bring Loramus back to us.

The altar will likely resist your efforts, so you'll have to protect Loramus' body while the ritual completes. Bring the [[demon hunter]] back to me afterwards.

==Rewards==

You will also receive: {{cost|2|55}}

==Completion==
You... you fool!  What have you done?

==Notes== 
The path up to the altar is past the ogre camp, at the south edge. On reaching the altar, use it and prepare to fight off several weak mobs. While the ritual is ongoing:
