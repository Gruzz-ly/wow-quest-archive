==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Ashmane Steaks from [[Ashmane Boar]]s in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Ashmane Steak]] (5)

==Description==
Contrary to popular belief, ancient and powerful [[blood mage|bloodmages]] do NOT drink blood. We eat normal food like everybody else - something which can be hard to come by in the recesses of a hostile cultist stronghold.

The Ashmane Boars in the central valley of the Blasted Lands are, if nothing else, convenient for eating, as their meat does not require any cooking. Would you hunt these boars and help me replenish my ever-dwindling foodstores?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ashmane Bracers|Stained Shoulderguards|Boots of the Blasted Lands}}
You will also receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
I'm famished!  If you don't hurry, I might actually resort to drinking our reagents.

==Completion==
These are perfect, <name>.  I will eat well for the next several days.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The First Step (Blasted Lands)|The First Step]] before leaving. 

Once outside the cave, head west. Kill and loot every boar, hyena, and basilisk you can find until you've gotten everything.
