==Objectives==
Kill 8 Ironmarch Grunts.
*[[Ironmarch Grunt]] slain (8)

==Description==
We received reports of the [[Dark Portal]] turning red right before the attack. They call themselves the Iron Horde, yet they seem to have no affiliation with the Horde we know.

Their army is extremely well equipped, and their numbers appear to be unending.

They have already taken [[Nethergarde Keep]]. Our troops on the frontlines could use your help, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 515 rings|Invader's Scarlet Seal|Portal-Breaker's Band|Blackstone Signet|Ruby-Eye Seal|Sapphire Seal}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 XP

==Progress==
Who is this Iron Horde?

==Completion==
Good form, champion. I'm sure your presence on the field was inspiring for our troops.

==Notes==
:''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|We must hold the frontline!}}

Pick up [[Under Siege (Alliance)]] and [[Peeking into the Portal (Alliance)]] before heading out. Then go just southeast to the [[Shattered Front]] and start killing and interacting with three siege tanks. After that, head southwest across the Shattered Front. On top of a hill is a giant looking glass with Scout Pazerp dead on the ground at its base. Interact with the telescope to get a good view of the Iron Horde streaming out of the Dark Portal.
