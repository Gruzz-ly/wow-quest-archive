==Objectives==
Report to [[Bloodmage Lynnore]] in the back of the [[Dreadmaul Furnace]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].

==Description==
I meant what I said, <race>. You helped me, now I'll pass on what I know.

A [[Loramus Thalipedes|demon hunter]] recently came through here, but only briefly. He was headed south, speaking of [[demon]]s. Normally I'd have slain the [[night elf]] on sight, but he didn't seem to be [[Alliance]] scum, and anybody who kills demons is useful to me for the time being.

You should check in with [[Bloodmage Lynnore|Lynnore]] and [[Bloodmage Drazial|Drazial]], a pair of [[blood mage]]s I sent down that way. They've camped in the back of an [[ogre]] cave.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*{{cost||85}}
*8,170 experience
*250 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*250 reputation with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
[[Okrilla]] sent you?  Okrilla the killa'?

<Lynnore listens to your tale.>

Loramus was his name?  I'm sorry to say that we have not seen your [[demon hunter]]... but we have ways of finding him.
