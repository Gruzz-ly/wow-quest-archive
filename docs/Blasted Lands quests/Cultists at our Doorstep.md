==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Intact Shadowsworn Spell Foci from [[Shadowsworn Spellblade]]s and [[Shadowsworn Occultist]]s in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Intact Shadowsworn Spell Focus]] (6)

==Description==
You may have already run into some of the [[Shadowsworn]] cultists that dwell in the caves just to the southwest of [[Nethergarde Keep|Nethergarde]]. They do not impress an immediate danger upon our fortress, but I fear that they are planning something more dreadful than you can imagine.

The low-ranking members carry spell foci that might hold an answer. Bring some back to me intact, if you can wrench them from the cultists' hands.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sandals of the Shadowsworn|Spell Focus Shoulderguards|Belt of Occult Horrors|Mahar's Gift}}

You will also receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
The cultists will not part easily with their foci.  Slay them quickly before they suspect our intent.

==Completion==
Ably done, <name>.  Now we see if my suspicions are correct.

<The watcher selects a spell focus and focuses intently on its shadows. After a moment, he turns back to you with a look of horror on his face.>
