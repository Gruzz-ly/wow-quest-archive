==Objectives==
Slay 6 [[Dreadmaul Mauler]]s and 5 [[Dreadmaul Warlock]]s.
* [[Dreadmaul Mauler]] slain (6)
* [[Dreadmaul Warlock]] slain (5)

==Description==
I saw [[Futile Pride|your handiwork]] down there, <race>. How'd you like to hunt some more [[ogre]]s?

We only enslaved the ones we could catch. Most of the strongest ogres still brood in [[Dreadmaul Post]], plotting our demise. Our guards can handle the scattered [[Dreadmaul Ambusher|ambushers]], but we are not yet firmly entrenched, and will buckle quickly under a coordinated attack.

Go south to Dreadmaul Post and send a message, <name>. Slay the strongest before they get any ideas.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Aitokk's Belt|Boots of Intimidation|Dreadmaul Bracers|Gloves of Purchased Time
}}

You will receive:
*{{cost||85}}
*8,170 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
The less we have to worry about ogres, the more we can focus on our true mission here.

==Completion==
You've done well today, <name>.  Not only have you purchased more time before the next ogre attack, but I think you scared some of the captives into working harder.

==Notes==
This quest may be picked up after completing [[Futile Pride]], but should probably be completed while completing [[A Bloodmage's Gotta Eat Too (Horde)]].
