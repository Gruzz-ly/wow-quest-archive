==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kasim Sharim]] and participate in his ritual.
*Participate in Kasim Sharim's ritual

==Description==
The knife is ready. [[Loramus Thalipedes|Loramus]] is present, and he knows what he must do. I must now take the three amulets and use their enchantment to grant you access to [[Razelikh]], the amulets' creator.

I am prepared to perform the ritual on you and Loramus. Speak with me when you are both ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||21}}

==Progress==
Quickly, friend. This is but the calm before the storm.

==Completion==
It would seem that we are prepared to face our [[demon]], <name>.  We have the amulet's blessing, we have the stone knife, and I alone know the demon's true name: Rakh'likh.  Together, this may be enough to defeat the Defiler.

==Notes==
On speaking to Kasim:
