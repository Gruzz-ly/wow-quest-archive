==Objectives==
Obtain 24 Charred Granite Chips.
*[[Charred Granite Chips]] (24)
*[[Portal-Sentry's Mining Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Kasim Sharim|Kasim]] wants you to gather granite chips from these chunks of rock around the [[Dark Portal]]. I don't know what he'd want rocks for, but I have my suspicions, and they're not pleasant ones.

Use this pick and look for small outcroppings of rock along the edge of the portal's blast radius.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
Please, lower your voice.

==Completion==
I hope this is what the [[gnome]] wanted.
