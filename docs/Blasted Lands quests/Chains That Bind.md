==Objectives==
Bring 5 infernal chain links to [[Bloodmage Lynnore]] in the {{C|Blasted Lands}}.
*[[Infernal Chain Link]] (5)

==Description==
I have seen this creature you call "[[Calefactus the Unleashed|Calefactus]]" many times in my field studies. By all accounts, it appears to be an nigh-invulnerable [[core hound]] made from [[Fel]] energies.

However, if what you say is true, and the [[Twilight's Hammer]] were planning to enslave it, then there may be a way to subdue the beast.

The [[Shadowsworn]], to the south-east, are known to perform dark rituals, including the enslavement of fel creatures. Perhaps members of their order carry a clue to weakening Calefactus?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found a tool to weaken Calefactus, <race>?

==Completion==
Interesting... yes, I can work with this.

==Progression==
{{The Burning Beast}}
