==Objectives==
Fly to the [[Tainted Scar]] in the [[Blasted Lands]] and get information from [[Daio the Decrepit]].
* Take the Portal to [[Karazhan]] (Optional)
* Fly to the Tainted Scar and find Daio
* Speak with Daio
* Survive Daio's Challenge
* Get the [[Demon Stone]]
*[[Blasted Lands Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
That text lists someone named Daio as being instrumental to the [[demon]]ic ritual. They can't possibly mean Daio the Decrepit!

I never knew he was [[Kirin Tor]]. I only know him as an elderly [[warlock]] who trains young recruits in the infernal arts. This would certainly explain his change of occupation.

He most likely holds key information for this to work. Though retired, I believe he is still out in the Tainted Scar in the Blasted Lands. You should seek him out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, what did Daio have to say?

==Completion==
Our order suffered a great loss that day. It is a shame we chose to hide it instead of study it.

You have another critical element to the ritual, and we are one step closer.

==Notes==
To reach the Tainted Scar, take the portal to [[Krasus' Landing]] from the [[Hall of the Guardian]], then take the Karazhan portal from the [[Portrait Room]] in the center of [[Dalaran]]. Once at Karazhan, fly due south until you reach a demonic altar in the northern part of the Tainted Scar and speak with Daio.
:You are certainly a long way from home, <race>.
:''{{gossip|I have come to ask you about [[Arrexis]] and his ritual. I must face [[Balaadur]] and I need to get his attention.}}''
:Ah, that ritual. The one where Arrexis was dragged screaming into the [[Twisting Nether|Nether]] and his entire cadre of [[mage]]s were slaughtered. The ritual that caused me to give up the [[arcane]] and begin my personal quest to understand demons and their [[fel]] energies.

:Balaadur is extremely dangerous and you seem... young. Are you sure you are prepared?
:''{{gossip|I have the aid of [[Meryl Felstorm]] and the spirit of [[Alodi]], and we know what we face this time.}}''
:Balaadur and his minions have slain many mages over the years, they have perfected their craft. Before I help you with the ritual I will need to see your ability for myself. If you can face what I summon, I will give you the aid you require.

:Are you prepared to face demons?
:''{{gossip|I will face your demons, warlock.}}''
:{{text|say|Daio the Decrepit|Very well! Let us begin. Perhaps something easy to start. A few [[imp]]s, perhaps?}}

Daio summons a pack of seven [[Fiendish Trickster]]s. Use [[AoE]] spells to take them down quickly.
:{{text|say|Daio the Decrepit|Easily defeated, but deadly in large numbers. Perhaps something that hits a little harder...}}

Daio summons an [[Empowered Wrathguard]]. Use abilities like [[Frostbolt]] and [[Frost Nova]] to slow it down or freeze it to prevent it from getting in melee range of you.
:{{text|say|Daio the Decrepit|I expected no less from one who wields crippling ice magic. But how about a foe as skilled in spellcasting as yourself?}}

Daio summons an [[Eredar Mage]]. Avoid standing in its "Fel Flamestrike" ability.
:{{text|say|Daio the Decrepit|Well fought, but Balaadur has been hunting mages for untold ages. Facing him will require mastery of all of your abilities.}}
:{{text|say|Daio the Decrepit|For the final piece of the puzzle... a simple stone. A stone from Balaadur's realm, left here by chance during one of his many ambushes.}}
Daio places a [[Demon Stone]] in your inventory.
:{{text|say|Daio the Decrepit|I gave Arrexis a piece so he could attune his ritual to demonic energies. You may have what remains of the stone. May it bring better luck to you.}}

If you haven't done so already, head to the [[Abandoned Kirin Tor Camp]] west of Karazhan for [[The Deadwind Site]]. Otherwise, use [[Teleport: Hall of the Guardian]] to return to Meryl.

==Progression==
{{Mage artifact and class hall}}
