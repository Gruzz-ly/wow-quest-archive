== Objectives ==
Obtain Grol's Amulet from the [[Shattershore]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
* [[Amulet of Grol]]

== Description ==
Grol... the [[ogre]].

<Kasim laughs.>

It would seem that Grol's body no longer rests with the ogres. His body, along with his amulet of power, is in a wrecked ship off the Shattershore, to the east. His amulet is the last... once combined, the three will give us access to [[Razelikh]], and therein lies our chance to stop his madness.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ogre-Hunter Boots|Serpent Coils|Shattershore Cloak|Strengthening Belt}}

You will also receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
The third amulet, from Razelikh's third lieutenant. 

==Completion==
<Kasim clutches the third amulet.>

He was a powerful warrior, this one.  I will keep the amulet until we are ready to proceed.

== Notes == 
Check inside the ship that is completely offshore, but peeking out of the water. On investigating the  head of Grol, the hostile [[Spirit of Grol]] will be summoned. The amulet can be looted from his spirit's corpse.

On touching Head of Grol:

:{{text|yell|Spirit of Grol|Grol will kill you!}}
