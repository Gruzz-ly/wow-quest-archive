==Objectives==
Kill 13 Drowned Gilneans on the [[Shattershore]] to release their spirits.
*[[Drowned Gilnean Spirit]] Freed (13)

==Description==
Based on what you're telling me, it sounds like there aren't many survivors... just restless spirits. The least we can do is give them their rest.

<Enohar takes a long draw off of a mug of black ale.>

Head back to the Shattershore and vanquish the [[worgen]] [[ghost]]s that still remain. Doing so should release their spirit from this world and allow them to pass into the next.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|65}}

==Progress==
The [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneans]] need us, <name>. Get back out there and give them their respite.

==Completion==
<Enohar takes a sip off of a freshly-refilled mug.>

Aye, you've done well, lad.  You do the Alliance proud.

==Notes==
Be sure to pick up [[Curtail the Darktail]] before heading out.

Kill the following ghosts at the shore: [[Drowned Gilnean Merchant]]s, [[Drowned Gilnean Sailor]]s and [[Drowned Gilnean Settler]]s. Their freed spirits will be in their human form, and wave goodbye to you as they raise up in a pillar of light. Once you've cleared out a safe area near the ships, stop to take out Bonepickers with the bow.
