== Objectives ==
Slay Captain Metlek at the [[Nethergarde Supply Camp]].
*[[Captain Metlek]] slain

== Description ==
[[Quartermaster Lungertz|Lungertz]] is a strong leader, but he is proud. He understates the pressure that the [[Horde]] is really putting on us. Without our mine... Nethergarde is penniless.

We need to move the Horde forces from the supply camp NOW, and doing so means killing their commander, Captain Metlek. He's not a strong leader, and prefers to bark orders from the back lines, but even so, his death might buy us the victory we need.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Are you lost? You'll find Metlek riding a black [[wolf]] behind the front lines.

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>.  Thanks to your efforts, I am confident that with time, we will take back the [[Nethergarde Mines]]. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eliminate the Okril'lon]] and [[Remove Their Arms]] before leaving.

Metlek is at the western side, just past most of the battle.

==Progression==
