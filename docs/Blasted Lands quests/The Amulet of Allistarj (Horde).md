==Objectives==
Obtain the Amulet of Allistarj from the [[Serpent's Coil]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Amulet of Allistarj]]

==Description==
When my master helped me to take my eyes out, he gave me the [[Spectral sight|gift of sight]]... a sight much greater than yours, or even of these blood-craving elves. My sight allows me to see objects of demonic power, such as the Amulet of Allistarj.

[[Allistarj]] himself is dead, but he locked his amulet up in a trove inside the Serpent's Coil, to the east. Along with the other amulets, this relic will give us access to [[Razelikh]]'s perch.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
Allistarj left a piece of himself in that amulet.  Even now, I can sense his evil. 

==Completion==
<[[Bloodmage Lynnore|Lynnore]] examines the amulet.>

He was an [[archmage]], I can feel it.  I will hold the amulet for you while you collect the rest.
