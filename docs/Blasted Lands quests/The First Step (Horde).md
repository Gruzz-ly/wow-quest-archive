==Objectives==
Obtain 9 vials of Snickerfang Hyena Blood and 9 vials of Redstone Basilisk Blood.
*[[Snickerfang Hyena Blood]] (9)
*[[Redstone Basilisk Blood]] (9)

==Description==
To perform the ritual you've requested - and perhaps some more rituals in the near future - we're going to need blood. The [[Blasted Lands]] are filled with every type of reagent we might need for our [[blood magic]]... it's just a matter of the correct combination.

<Lynnore quickly confers with [[Bloodmage Drazial|Drazial]] for a moment.>

[[Basilisk]]s and [[hyena]]s, even amounts. And we're going to need plenty of it. Head east, to the center of the Blasted Lands. And don't forget... you can use that teleporter!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
[[Ogre]] blood only takes you so far.  Do you have it? 

==Completion==
<Lynnore eyes the blood hungrily.>

More than enough, and still warm!  Now, let's get this ritual started, shall we?
