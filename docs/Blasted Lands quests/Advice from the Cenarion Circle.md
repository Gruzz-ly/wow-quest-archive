==Objectives==
Report to [[Cenarion Observer Shayana]] at the [[Surwich]] in the [[Blasted Lands]]. 

==Description==
I believe that the taint of the Blasted Lands has finally exerted its influence over my friend [[Marl Wormthorn|Wormthorn]]. His experiment is failed, and his great-tree now only serves as a focus for the [[demons]] to rally around.

The tree must come down, and Wormthorn with it. Speak with the Cenarion Observer on the other side of town; she should have some idea how to proceed.

<name>: the act we are about to commit must not be made known to the townspeople of [[Surwich]]. Morale is low enough as-is. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||9}}

==Completion==
While I'm surprised that [[Mayor Charlton Connisport|Connisport]] is willing to go forward with his plan, I'm also relieved. I've seen the demons rallying around [[Maldraz]], and I share his fears.
