==Objectives==
Report to [[Elijah Dawnflight]] at the [[Sunveil Excursion]] in the [[Blasted Lands]]. 

==Description==
Your [[demon]]-slaying down there bought our scouts enough time to get a good look at that [[druid]]. My intelligence tells me that his name is [[Marl Wormthorn]]... a rogue [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilnean]] druid of substantial power. He resides in [[Maldraz]], the large, twisted tree at the center of the forest, and is protected from harm by some strange force. Whether that force is demonic or natural sources, we have yet to determine.

Speak with Elijah. He may have some more information for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||9}}

==Completion==
Rohan's sending YOU to slay his druid? Very well.

You should know: Marl Wormthorn is as much demon as he is druid. Even a druid of his power doesn't have a chance against the demonic energies that run so deeply through this land. That does not, however, make him any less of an obstacle.
