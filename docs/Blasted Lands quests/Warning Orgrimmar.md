==Objectives==
Speak with [[High Overlord Saurfang]].

==Description==
We have slowed the [[Iron Horde]] down, but this war is far from over... I'll stay here and continue our efforts to hold back the Iron Horde.

The Warchief needs to know about what we have accomplished here today, and the threat we face in the future.

It is probably best if you report to High Overlord Saurfang yourself, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 520 trinkets|Talisman of the Invader|Bloodcaster's Charm|Ironmender's Totem|Bladespike Charm|Bloodburn Protector}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|22|80}}
* 17110 XP
*[[Iron Starlette]]

==Completion==
;Saurfang
This is more trouble than I imagined. The Iron Horde is strong, but none match the might of the true Horde!

;Vol'jin
This is more trouble than I first tink. Da Iron Horde be strong, but we are da true Horde, and we be stronger.

I fear this is da start of much bloodshed, before we go ta war, we be needin' a plan.

==Notes==
Don't forget the standing port to Orgrimmar at the [[Shattered Landing]].

This was the last part of the quest chain until ''Warlords of Draenor'' was released, at which point [[Warlords of Draenor: The Dark Portal]] will open up from from the [[Warchief's Command Board]]s in capital cities.

On completion between [[patch 6.0.2]] launch and the release of ''Warlords of Draenor'',<ref>{{ref web|url=http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882118463#2|author=Lore|date=2014-10-15|title=Iron Starlette question|archiveurl=http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344793-iron-starlette-question/|archivedate=2014-10-15}}</ref> players were awarded the feat of strength [[The Iron Invasion]], awarding the title <name> of the Iron Vanguard.
