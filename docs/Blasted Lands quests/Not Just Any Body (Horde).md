==Objectives==
Find Loramus' Head, Loramus' Torso, and Loramus' Legs.
*[[Loramus' Head]]
*[[Loramus' Torso]]
*[[Loramus' Legs]]

==Description==
[[Loramus Thalipedes]] is dead. Well, let me step back... that's an assumption on my part, but I do know that his body lies in three pieces.

<Lynnore ponders for a moment.>

If you bring me the pieces, we still have a recourse. All three pieces are nearby... the Dreadmaul ogres hide them in their caves. In fact, one of them is in that chest, down the ledge behind me...

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
Trust me... whatever happened to Loramus, we can fix.  The limits of [[blood magic]] are still undefined.

==Completion==
I see... yes, we can work with this.

<Lynnore looks at the night elf's head.>

Loramus Thalipedes, demon hunter.  I look forward to meeting you.
