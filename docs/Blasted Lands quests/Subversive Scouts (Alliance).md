*13700 XP

==Progress==
If you see any of their scouts, kill them.

You killed how many scouts? No wonder we have been unable to execute our plans...

''On accept'':

Scouts are stealthed all over the area.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|With those scouts dead we have a greater chance of catching the Iron Horde by surprise. Execllent work, <name>.}}
