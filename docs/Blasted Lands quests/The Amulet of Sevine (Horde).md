==Objectives==
Obtain the Amulet of Sevine from [[Salt-Flop]] near the [[Shattershore]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Amulet of Sevine]]

==Description==
[[Sevine]]'s amulet is in the hands of a [[murloc]], far to the east, on a shelf that overlooks the Shattershore. How it ended up in that murloc's possession, I cannot say, but I can state with certainty that you will find it there.

I feel a stronger connection with Sevine than with the rest of [[Razelikh]]'s servants... possibly because she built the [[Altar of Storms (Blasted Lands)|Altar of Storms]], upon which you resurrected me. Bring her Amulet to [[Bloodmage Lynnore|Lynnore]], along with the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
Sevine's amulet... along with the others, we can reach the [[Rise of the Defiler]].

==Completion==
<Lynnore hefts the amulet.>

A [[warlock]]... and a powerful one at that.  I will hold onto this until the time is right.

==Progression==
