== Objectives ==
Kill 8 [[Dreadmaul|Dreadmaul Ogres]].
*Dreadmaul ogres slain (8)

== Description ==
The stupidity of the Dreadmaul ogres never ceases to amaze me. The [[Iron Horde]] is clearly using them to further their own nefarious agenda.

Regardless, we must show the ogres what happens when you confront the true Horde. I think it's time we send the Dreadmaul ogres a message.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
How many Draedmaul ogres did you kill?

== Completion ==
It's important that our enemies understand what happens when you attack the true Horde. I'm glad you could be there to show them.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Toothsmash the Annihilator (Horde)]] and [[Okrilla's Revenge]] before heading out.

West into [[Dreadmaul Post]]. Plenty of ogres to kill on the surface, as are the three ogre cookpots, which are arranged in a roughly north-south line. [[Toothsmash the Annihilator]] is between the two southern cookpots.
