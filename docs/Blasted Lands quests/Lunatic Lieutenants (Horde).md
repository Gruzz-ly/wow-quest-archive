== Objectives ==
Collect Iron Horde battleplans.
*[[Mokrik's Battleplan]]{{Coords|62.8|13.1|Blasted Lands||1}}
*[[Rukah's Battleplan]]{{Coords|56.9|17.4|Blasted Lands||1}}
*[[Gar's Battleplan]]{{Coords|60.2|13.7|Blasted Lands||1}}

== Description ==
It is time we learned more about our new enemy.

Our scouts have identified a number of the [[Iron Horde]]'s lieutenants. Their attack is too organized to be run by tribal knowledge alone. Surely their lieutenants have access to secret battleplans.

You are the only soldier I can trust with this mission, <name>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 515 necks|Skulltooth Collar|Necklace of Celerity|Gnawing Tooth|Emberfury Choker|Chain of Evasion}}

You will gain the following spells:
*Control Mechanics
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

== Progress ==
Were you able to gain access to any battleplans?

== Completion ==
Let's take a look at these battleplans.

== Notes ==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Thrall|Bring those battleplans back to me and we can begin to dismantle this Iron Horde.}}

Pick up [[Attack on Nethergarde]] and [[Ransacking Nethergarde]] before heading out.

Northeast to Nethergarde. [[Rukah the Machinist]] is outside the west entrance, and she drops [[Rukah's Battleplan]]. Head inside and look to the right (south) by the picnic table next to the wall. On the ground is [[Neka's Poison Flask]] next to [[Neka]]. Enter the still-standing keep to the north, but before going in, plant the flag just outside, then head inside the keep and upstairs to the throne room to find [[Gar Steelcrush]], who drops [[Gar's Battleplan]]. Exit the keep to the northeast and enter the [[Blacksmith|smithy]] to find [[Strumner Flintheel]] with [[Strumner's Sword]] in his back. Behind the smithy to the north, find [[Mokrik Blackfingers]]. Back to the south, plant the next flag outside the ruined keep, then head further south to plant the last flag at the ruined entrance. Finally, loop back to the northwest to find [[Krolan's Shield]] on the ground in the ruined keep next to [[Sergeant Krolan]].

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Thrall|Hmm... it appears the Iron Horde has formed an alliance with the Dreadmaul ogres. This is going to be more difficult than I thought.}}
