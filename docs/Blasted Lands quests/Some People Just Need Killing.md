==Objectives==
Slay Chief Prospector Hondo. Use the [[Inconspicuous Box]] to disguise yourself along the way.
*[[Chief Prospector Hondo]] slain

==Description==
The tunnel ahead, headin' west, will take you straight to Chief Prospector Hondo's office. He's the big cheese around here, and [[Tak'arili]]'s heard tell that he's a darn fine miner. That's why he's gotta die.

There's just one problem: the pathway is completely FILLED with those pesky [[Nethergarde]] flunkies. That's why you gotta disguise yourself. Hop inside this box here, and sneak down the pathway. Hopefully you won't draw too much suspicion on your way to da killin'.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|65}}
*12,250 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*+350 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Hondo ain't gonna know what hit him.

==Completion==
Nice work, mon!  Without Hondo, these guys are helpless.  Dis mine'll be ours soon enough!

==Notes==
As the objective and description state there is an Inconspicuous Box that you can get into and acts like a vehicle. While in it, the Alliance-friendly Nethergarde mobs in the mine will not aggro you, so you can walk to Chief Prospector Hondo at 52.4,2.4{{coords|52.4|2.4|Blasted Lands}}. Along the way Engineers and Foremen will spout random quotes. The following is a list of those quotes<ref>Comment by user "cilla" on Wowhead.com on the quest page.</ref>

As said by random Nethergarde Foremans:
*"Hmm..."
*"Get back to work! Oh wait... you're just a box, never mind."
*"What in tarnation?"
*"How peculiar."
*"A box that walks? I should ask Hondo about this... nah, maybe later."
*"I do declare... a moving box. The engineers have really done it this time!"
*"Oh my."
*"Was that box there a second ago?"

Nethergarde Engineers' lines:
*"Hey! Somebody's ambulatory cube is escaping!"
*"Heavens to Betsy!"
*"Looks like somebody's getting a special delivery."
*"I think I've been down in this mine too long."
*"Look out! It's a box-demon!"
*"Gadzooks! Would ya look at that?"

And Hondo:
*"Is that box walking on its own? Am I going mad? Quick, someone check the canary!"

Miners don't respond.
