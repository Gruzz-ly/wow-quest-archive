==Objectives==
Kill 5 Doomguard Destroyers, 5 Dreadlord Defilers, 5 Corrupted Darkwood Treants, and 3 Felspore Bog Lords in the [[Tainted Forest]].
*[[Doomguard Destroyer]] slain (5)
*[[Dreadlord Defiler]] slain (5)
*[[Darkwood Treant]] slain (5)
*[[Felspore Bog Lord]] slain (3)

==Description==
The [[Reliquary]] is focused on the acquisition and preservation of magical artifacts. Our particular excursion is focused on the [[demon]]ic artifacts that are hidden in what used to be the [[Tainted Scar]].

A [[worgen]] [[druid]] has taken residence in the scar and is coaxing a [[Tainted Forest|forest]] to grow. He seems to be failing, however, as the area is still infested with demons. 

Anyhow, his forest stands in the way of our excursion, as do these demons. Slay the tainted ones, then return to me so we can deal with the druid.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|75}}

==Progress==
The forest is not yet cleared of the taint, <name>. Do as I say, and then we may proceed with our mission.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. 

I should be a bit more up-front with you. The demons were a nuisance, but they are not the real problem. That worgen druid is our problem.
