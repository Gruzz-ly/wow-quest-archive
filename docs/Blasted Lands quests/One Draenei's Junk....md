Return the Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment to Kum'isha the Collector in Blasted Lands. 
*[[Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment]]

== Description ==
A shard of glimmering rock sits before you. You sense that this item would be of value to someone within the Blasted Lands.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Kum'isha's Junk}}

== Progress ==
Well? [[Draenethyst]]?

==  Completion ==
Just a shard? Pfuh! This gets me nothing! Take your reward and get out of my sight.

Sounds familiar? It should, because I say it a thousand times per day.

Oh how I loathe this world.
