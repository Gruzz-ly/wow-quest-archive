== Objectives ==
Destroy 8 Azsh'ir Idols on the [[Red Reaches]].
*Azsh'ir Idol destroyed (8)

== Description ==
[[Neptulon]] the Tidehunter is our god. He was the god of the Bloodwash, too, but they have turned their back on him, it seems. They now choose to worship only [[Azshara]], their [[naga]] queen. You will see likenesses of Azshara littered around their settlements, carved out of seastone.

<The murloc spirit eyes your weapon.>

That weapon will do. Send it through their Azsh'ir idols. They need to be reminded that our father Neptulon is the only one who truly rules the seas.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Neptulon guide you, landwalker.

== Completion ==
You make an old murloc proud, <race>.

Thank you, and may the waves ever lap at your feet.
