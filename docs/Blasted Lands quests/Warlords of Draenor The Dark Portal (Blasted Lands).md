'''The Dark Portal''' is an alternate quest that begins the post-Warlords expansion launch quest chain in an instanced version of [[Tanaan Jungle]], the [[Assault on the Dark Portal]], itself the second half of the [[Warlords of Draenor intro experience]].

Initially, more copies of Khadgar were found in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms' shrines. As of ''Shadowlands'', the quest can only be accepted from Khadgar in the WoD version of the Blasted Lands, however, the main version, [[Warlords of Draenor: The Dark Portal]], must be abandoned to make this version available.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Archmage Khadgar]] at the foot of the [[Dark Portal]] in [[Blasted Lands]].
*Speak with Archmage Khadgar {{co|54.9|50.2|Blasted Lands}}

==Description==
<Name>, is it? I'm glad you're here. We can use every able-bodied <class> that we can get.

I am assembling a coalition of [[Azeroth]]'s strongest to step through this Dark Portal and stop the [[Iron Horde]] invasion. This may be the only way to save Azeroth.

Will you join us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|70}}
* 6850 XP

==Completion==
Looks to me like we ended up in the right place.

==Notes==
Take the standing port to the [[Shattershore]] next to the [[Warchief's Command Board]] outside in the [[Valley of Strength]], or get there manually. From Shattershore, fly south to the [[Dark Portal]] and speak with [[Khadgar]]:

:<The archmage focuses intently on the portal.>
:Look. Their numbers are abating, however briefly. This may be our chance.
:Are you prepared to face whatever's on the other side of that portal?
''{{gossip|FOR AZEROTH!}}''

A second check appears:
:You are about to embark on a dangerous mission, and you may not be able to return immediately. Are you sure?

After hitting accept, cinematic plays:
:'''Archmage Khadgar''' {{text|bossemote|This is our chance. Storm the portal!}}

Possessing this quest will block access to the Blasted Lands quests that follow the breadcrumb quest "Iron Horde Invasion!". You can either drop this quest to finish the Blasted Lands quests, or complete the quest chain through the Tanaan Jungle and then return to the Blasted Lands to complete the quest chain there.
