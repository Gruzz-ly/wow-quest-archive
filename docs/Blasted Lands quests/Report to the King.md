==Objectives==
{{questportrait|King Anduin sitting in Stormwind Throne.jpg|King Anduin Wrynn|Military leader of the Alliance.}}
Speak with [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin Wrynn]].

==Description==
We have slowed the [[Iron Horde]] down, but this war is far from over... I'll stay here and continue our efforts to hold back the Iron Horde.

The King needs to know about what we have accomplished here today, and the threat we face in the future.

It is probably best if you report to King Wrynn yourself, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 520 trinkets|Talisman of the Invader|Bloodcaster's Charm|Ironmender's Totem|Bladespike Charm|Bloodburn Protector}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|22|80}}
*17110 XP
*[[Iron Starlette]]

==Completion==
This is worse than I imagined.

The Iron Horde is proving to be a massive threat to our people... I don't want any more bloodshed, but I fear we are out of options.

We need a plan before we strike.

==Notes==
Don't forget the standing port to Stormwind back at the [[Shattered Beachhead]].  The quest arrow will point you to Stormwind - which is a long flight.  A short trip due east to the portal will get you there fast.

This is the last part of the quest chain until ''Warlords of Draenor'' is released, at which point [[Warlords of Draenor: The Dark Portal]] will open up from the [[Hero's Call Board]]s in capital cities.

On completion between [[patch 6.0.2]] launch and the release of ''Warlords of Draenor'',<ref>{{ref web|url=http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882118463#2|author=Lore|date=2014-10-15|title=Iron Starlette question|archiveurl=http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344793-iron-starlette-question/|archivedate=2014-10-15}}</ref> players were awarded the feat of strength [[The Iron Invasion]], awarding the title <name> of the Iron Vanguard.
