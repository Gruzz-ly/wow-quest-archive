==Objectives==
Find [[Scout Pazerp]] and use her telescope.
*Use the [[telescope]] {{coords|61.7|36.7|Blasted Lands||1}}

==Description==
I sent Scout Pazerp to get a better look at the portal. She should have reported back by now; what could be taking her so long?

She is one of my best scouts, I hope she is alright.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
Scout Pazerp still hasn't reported back.

==Completion==
Poor Pazerp... this news is unsettling to say the least. The Iron Horde seems to have an unending supply of troops.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Bodrick Grey|If Pazerp doesn't return soon I'm going to have to send a scout to find my scout. That will be awkward for everybody involved.}}

Pick up [[Attack of the Iron Horde (Alliance)]] and [[Under Siege (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Head southwest across the [[Shattered Front]]. On top of a hill is a giant looking glass with [[Scout Pazerp]] dead on the ground at its base, a few dead Ironmarch Grunts, and [[Archmage Khadgar]]:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I was a moment too late. Your scout is dead... this is worse than I could have imagined. The Iron Horde invasion has begun. Take a look for yourself.}}

Interact with the telescope to get a good view of the Iron Horde streaming out of the Dark Portal.
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I must tell King Wrynn at once. Keep alert, <class>. Dark times lay ahead.}}
:''Khadgar converts to raven form and flies away.''

''On complete''
:{{text|say|Bodrick Grey|We have lost too many lives already. This battle is getting out of hand.}}
