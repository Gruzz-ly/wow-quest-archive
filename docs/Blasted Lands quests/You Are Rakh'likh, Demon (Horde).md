'''You Are Rakh'likh, Demon''' is the final quest in the [[Blasted Lands storyline]]. In it, the player assists [[Loramus Thalipedes]] in banishing [[Rakh'likh the Defiler]].

==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Deathly Usher]] north of the [[Rise of the Defiler]]. Once atop the Rise, destroy Razelikh's body, then use the [[Stone Knife of Sealing]] to imprison his soul.
*Razelikh's body destroyed
*Razelikh's soul imprisoned
*[[Stone Knife of Sealing]] (provided)

==Description==
Hero, listen well.

First, we must travel to the [[Deathly Usher]], who waits at the northern foot of the [[Rise of the Defiler]], to our northeast. The usher will take us to the top of the rise. Once there, I need you to help me defeat [[Rakh'likh the Defiler|Razelikh]], for I fear that I am not strong enough to defeat him alone.

Most importantly, I need you to hold the [[Stone Knife of Sealing|stone knife]], and do not use it until I tell you to. The knife will trap Razelikh's soul within its new, eternal prison.

If we succeed, speak with [[Watcher Wazzik|Wazzik]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Band of Noble Deeds
|Band of Sacrifice
|Band of Selfless Acts
}}

You will also receive:
*{{coppercost|34700}}
*17460 [[XP]]
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Horde]]

==Completion==
I see.  So this was Loramus' plan all along.

I suspected correctly, but I suppose I refused to believe it.  And now, his final instruction for me makes much more sense:

He asked me to let you choose from one of these.

==Notes==
The [[Deathly Usher]] is located in the northeastern part of the [[Rise of the Defiler]]. Once you have found him, speak to him:
:''I am bound eternally to this cursed world. What is it you desire, mortal?''
::{{gossip|I wish to face the Defiler.}}

Choose the gossip option to be transported to the top of the Rise, where Rakh'likh awaits.

;Before the fight begins:
:{{text|say|Loramus Thalipedes|Demon! I have returned from beyond the grave to destroy you!}}
:{{text|say|Loramus Thalipedes|Death has not erased my memory. I still know your name...}}
:{{text|yell|Loramus Thalipedes|RAKH'LIKH! Come, and know demise!}}

Rakh'likh will turn hostile, and can potentially attempt to knock the player off the Rise. If this occurs, Loramus will pull the player back:
:{{text|yell|Loramus Thalipedes|Hold on!}}

Eventually, Razelikh will stop the fight and address Loramus directly.
:{{text|yell|Razelikh the Defiler|Enough games!}}
:{{text|say|Razelikh the Defiler|What's this? Loramus... I see, they used the [[Altar of Storms (Blasted Lands)|Altar of Storms]], didn't they?}}
:{{text|say|Razelikh the Defiler|You must feel it already then... the demonic energy entering your heart, your lungs, your soul...}}
:{{text|yell|Razelikh the Defiler|Allow me to speed up the process a bit!}}

Razelikh will then possess Loramus, who becomes Loramus the Defiled and turns hostile.
:{{text|say|Loramus the Defiled|Now, heroes! Finish me, while Rakh'likh possesses my body!}}
:{{text|yell|Loramus the Defiled|[Demonic] Lok zenn Za enkil refir mordanas lok zenn}}

After wearing down Loramus the Defiled, the following will occur:
:{{text|say|Loramus the Defiled|Quickly! Use the knife on me! Time runs short!}}
:Use the [[Stone Knife of Sealing]] to defeat Loramus the Defiled!
:{{text|say|Loramus the Defiled|It is done. Leave me here, then, while I wrestle with Rakh'likh in the next world. Your job here is done, heroes.}}
