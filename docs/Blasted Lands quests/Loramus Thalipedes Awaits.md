==Objectives==
Speak with Bloodmage Lynnore and participate in her ritual.
* Participate in ritual

==Description==
The enchantment on these amulets was not complex. Together, their power will grant you access to [[Razelikh]], the amulets' creator.

I am prepared to perform the ritual on you and [[Loramus Thalipedes|Loramus]]. Speak with me when you are both ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||21|}}
*2110 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Speak with Lynnore, and quickly, friend. This is but the calm before the storm.

==Completion==
It would seem that we are prepared to face our demon, <name>.  We have the amulet's blessing, we have the stone knife, and I alone know the demon's true name: Rakh'likh.  Together, this may be enough to defeat the Defiler.

==Notes==
