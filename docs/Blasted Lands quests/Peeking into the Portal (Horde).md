Pick up [[Subversive Scouts (Horde)]] and [[Ending Executions (Horde)]] before heading out.

Head northwest up the road through the [[Shattered Front]]. On a rise just north of the road, find [[Scout Pazaztick]] dead on the ground next to a big telescope.

:{{Text|say|[[Archmage Khadgar]]|I was a moment too late. Your scout is dead... this is worse than I could have imagined. The Iron Horde invasion has begun. Take a look for yourself.}}

Interact with the telescope to get a good view of the Iron Horde streaming out of the Dark Portal.
