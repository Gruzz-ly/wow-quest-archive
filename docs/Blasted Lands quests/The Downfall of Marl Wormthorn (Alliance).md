==Objectives==
Kill [[Marl Wormthorn]] at [[Maldraz]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].  You can use the [[Demoniac Vessel]] to pull him out of his trance.

==Description==
When word gets out about what we've done... there's no saying what the citizens of Surwich will do.  They cling so closely to Wormthorn's dream...

...but still, it must be done.  Take the demoniac vessel and use it on Marl Wormthorn to pull him from his trance.  Return to me when he is no more.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

==Progress==
Get back out there, before I change my mind.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.  I, and the people of Surwich, are in your debt.

Feel free to take one of these.  While we haven't got much, we're happy to reward those that protect us.
