==Objectives==
Journey to the [[Blasted Lands]] and speak with [[Enohar Thunderbrew]] in [[Nethergarde Keep]].

==Description==
We appreciate your assistance here in this swamp, <name>. I would like to inform you that I have received correspondence from Nethergarde Keep.

Enohar Thunderbrew has requested help in investigating the shipwrecks of the [[Red Reaches]], but we have had none willing to make the journey, and I could not leave the Harborage.

Nethergarde Keep sits in the Blasted Lands, south of the [[Swamp of Sorrows]]. Do not journey too close to [[Stonard]] on your way.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Completion==
Ah, has [[Anchorite Avuun|Avuun]] sent ye? Good, good...

==Notes==
The breadcrumb to Blasted Lands for the Alliance, meant to be taken at the end of the [[Swamp of Sorrows storyline]].

Follow the path southwest out of the Harborage, take a left heading southeast at [[Splinterspear Junction]], then take a right at the next fork to turn south and enter the [[Blasted Lands]], passing the [[Fallen Hero of the Horde]] along the way.

Once in the Blasted Lands, take the first left heading east through the [[Nethergarde Supply Camps]], besieged with Horde troops from [[Dreadmaul Hold]], to reach Nethergarde Keep. Enohar is outside of the southern keep, on its northern end. Make sure to pick up the flight path past Enohar behind the keep.
