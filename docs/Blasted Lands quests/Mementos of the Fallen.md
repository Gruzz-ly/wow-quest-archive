== Description ==
There was so many of them. The guards couldn't stop them... nobody could stop them. So many souls stripped of their bodies by those savages.

We must not forget those that gave their lives to try and defend [[Nethergarde]]. Please, if you find any mementos of the fallen, bring them back to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

== Progress ==
Did you find anything?

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>. These mementos will forever remind us of the day we lost so many of our loved ones.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Lunatic Lieutenants (Alliance)]] and [[For Nethergarde!]] before heading out.

Back to Nethergarde. [[Rukah the Machinist]] is outside the west entrance, and she drops [[Rukah's Battleplan]]. Head inside and look to the right (south) by the picnic table next to the wall. On the ground is [[Keri's Mug]] next to [[Keri Thunderbrew]]. Enter the still-standing keep to the north, but before going in, plant the flag just outside, then head inside the keep and upstairs to the throne room to find [[Gar Steelcrush]], who drops [[Gar's Battleplan]]. Exit the keep to the northeast and enter the [[Blacksmith|smithy]] to find [[Master Aitokk]] with [[Aitokk's Axe]] in his back. Behind the smithy to the north, find [[Mokrik Blackfingers]]. Back to the south, plant the next flag outside the ruined keep, then head further south to plant the last flag at the ruined entrance. Finally, loop back to the northwest to find [[Overseer Struk's Shield]] on the ground in the ruined keep next to [[Overseer Struk]].
