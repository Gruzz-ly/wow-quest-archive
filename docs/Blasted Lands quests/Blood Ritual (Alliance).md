== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Kasim Sharim]] to begin the blood ritual.
*Speak with Kasim Sharim to begin the blood ritual
*Return to Kasim Sharim at the Serpent's Coil in the Blasted Lands.

== Description ==
I suppose you want to know what we're doing. Here's the short version - a version at which I happen to be an expert:

The [[Shadowsworn]] cultists wish to summon the [[demon]], [[Razelikh]], back to the Blasted Lands. We cannot allow this to happen. So we're going to summon him ourselves, and then kill him. A task not as simple as it sounds...

Let me know when you are ready to begin the blood ritual, and then stand back.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||21}}

== Progress ==
The blood ritual is not yet complete.

== Completion ==
The blood ritual was a success; I can clearly see where we are going next.

I'm sorry, I misspoke.  What I meant to say is, I can see where YOU are going next...

== Notes ==
{{gossip|''I would like to start the Blood Ritual, Kasim.''}}
:{{text|say|Kasim Sharim|Very well. Stand back... this may get messy.}}
:''Kasim casts a spell that momentarily creates a circle of flame that moves around him.''
:{{text|say|Kasim Sharim|The blood ritual is complete... and I can now see where three amulets await you.}}
