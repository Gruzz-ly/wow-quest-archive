==Objectives==
Obtain Grol's Amulet from the [[Shattershore]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Amulet of Grol]]

==Description==
[[Grol]]... the [[ogre]] who tore me apart.

<[[Loramus Thalipedes|Loramus]] laughs.>

It would seem that Grol's body has changed hands several times since we died together, but it no longer rests with the ogres. His body, along with his amulet of power, is in a wrecked ship off the Shattershore, to the east. His amulet is the last... once combined, the three will give us access to [[Razelikh]], and therein lies our chance to stop his madness.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Ogre-Hunter Boots|Serpent Coils|Shattershore Cloak|Strengthening Belt}}

==Progress==
The third amulet, from Razelikh's third lieutenant.

==Completion==
<[[Bloodmage Lynnore|Lynnore]] clutches the third amulet.>

He was a powerful warrior, this one.  I will keep the amulet until Loramus is ready to proceed.
