==Objectives==
Kill 3 [[Ironmarch Executioner]]s

==Description==
We arrived as soon as we could... but we be too late. Da [[Iron Horde]] has taken our warriors prisoner.

No doubt they be trying ta squeeze info out of da troops.

*Advanced Combat Mechanics
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 XP

==Progress==
Did ya kill da Ironmarch Executioners?

==Completion==
Da prisoners be shaken up, but they are free. We be in your debt, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Rokhan|Okril'lon has lost so much already, I can't stand to see them lose more.}}

Pick up [[Subversive Scouts (Horde)]] and [[Peeking into the Portal (Horde)]] before heading out.

Head northwest. North of the road just past the telescope, find a handful of [[Ironmarch Executioner]]s with prisoners in their sights. Take them out.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Rokhan|Hopefully the prisoners you saved will have an opportunity to rebuild Okril'lon to its former glory.}}
