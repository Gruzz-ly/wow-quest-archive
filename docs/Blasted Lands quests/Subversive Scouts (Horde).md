==Objectives==
Kill 5 [[Iron Horde]] [[scout]]s.
*[[Ironmarch Scout]] slain (5)

==Description==
We have been unable to execute a vast majority of our battleplans. We are definitely being watched.

The Iron Horde must have scouts planted throughout the [[Blasted Lands]]. Victory is slipping away from us. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 XP

==Progress==
If you see any of their scouts, kill them.

==Completion==
You killed how many scouts? No wonder we have been able to execute our plans...

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Thrall|We cannot win this battle if the enemy is always one step ahead of us.}}

Pick up [[Ending Executions (Horde)]] and [[Peeking into the Portal (Horde)]] before heading out.

Scouts are stealthed all over the area.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Thrall|With those scouts dead we have a greater chance of catching the Iron Horde by surprise. Aka'Magosh, <name>.}}
