==Objectives==
Obtain 7 bottles of Vile Demonic Blood.
*[[Vile Demonic Blood]] (7)

==Description==
Thalipedes wants demon blood. Personally, the stuff doesn't even seem like blood to me - more like liquid rot - but that's neither here nor there.

Luckily for you, the area around the Dark Portal is crawling with demons. Infernals, felhounds, felguards... they've all got what you need, in copious, pustulent amounts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||85}}
*10550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Ugh, what's that smell?  Is that you, or the blood?

==Completion==
There's no doubt about it, you found demon blood.

Loramus' requests aside, I'm sure Dar'toon is thankful for your efforts.  They've been struggling to deal with these demon distractions for some time now.
