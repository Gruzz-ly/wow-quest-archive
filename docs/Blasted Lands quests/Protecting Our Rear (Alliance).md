== Objectives ==
Kill Jarroc Torn-wing, Shahandana, and Gomegaz.
* [[Jarroc Torn-Wing]] slain
* [[Shahandana]] slain
* [[Gomegaz]] slain

== Description ==
The only reason you see me standing aside Horde soldiers is because our duty outweighs our enmity... however slightly. We have been charged with protecting the [[Dark Portal]] from unauthorized travel, and with the recent [[Shattering|cataclysm]], we are particularly susceptible to an attack. We've already heard reports of [[Teremus the Devourer|black dragons]] in the area...

With my men focused on their duty, we need someone to keep the area demons in check. Around the portal you will find three demon lieutenants. Slay them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|70}}

== Progress ==
You have not yet killed these demons.  <Name>!  Get back to the field!

== Completion ==
Your work is appreciated, soldier.

<The commander leans in close, and whispers:>

<Race>... if you're still interested, I have one more small task for you...
