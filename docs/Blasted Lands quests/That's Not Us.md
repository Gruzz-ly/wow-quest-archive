==Objectives==
Find and slay whatever is frightening the miners in the [[Nethergarde Mines]].
*[[Illycor]] slain

==Description==
First things first... it looks like we got ourselves a problem. These miners down the pathway to the right have been runnin' around like a chickens without they heads on. My best guess is that they dug too deep and found somethin' nasty... a demon, an elemental, or some kind o' tentacley beast.

[[Tak'arili]] don't like surprises. Find out what the problem is and take care of it, then we get ourselves back on track. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||85}}
*10,200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*+250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
What was it, mon?  You get a close enough look?

==Completion==
So it was a demon?  Those miners never seen a demon before?  We're in the Blasted Lands, mon!  Demons are everywhere!
