== Objectives ==
Obtain the Amulet of Allistarj from the [[Serpent's Coil]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Amulet of Allistarj]]

== Description ==
To summon our [[demon]], we need three amulets, and the first is the Amulet of Allistarj.

[[Allistarj]] himself is dead, but he locked his amulet up in a trove inside this very cave. Along with the other amulets, this relic will give us access to [[Razelikh]]'s perch.

<Kasim concentrates for a moment.>

The amulet is close to the entrance. I recommend using the teleporter.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Allistarj left a piece of himself in that amulet.  Even now, I can sense his evil. 

== Completion ==
<Kasim examines the amulet.>

He was an archmage, I can feel it.  I will hold the amulet for you while you collect the rest. 

== Notes ==
The amulet is just inside the cave, near the first group of sleeping mobs.
