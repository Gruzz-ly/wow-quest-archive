== Objectives ==
Scout out the crashed ships on the [[Shattershore]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*Scout the ships on the Shattershore

== Description ==
We've seen countless ships sail past the shore to the southeast, but most pass by inconspicuously. Several days ago, however, a powerful storm carried several of the ships to shore and left them wrecked.

I'd bet a pint of {{item|Nethergarde Bitter}} that they were [[Horde]] ships if I didn't love Nethergarde Bitter so much. I can pay you gold, though, if you'll go check out those ships and report back.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
What news from the Shattershore, <name>?

== Completion ==
You saw [[worgen]]?  That's bad.

Worgen ghosts?  That's even worse.

Those weren't Horde ships... they were [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilnean]].  And they must have been headed down to [[Surwich]], at the bottom of the [[Tainted Forest]].  That makes a lot more sense.

We've got to try to help them, <name>!  The worgen are our allies! 

== Notes == 
Taking the southern exit out of [[Nethergarde Keep]] leads straight to the Shattershore.
