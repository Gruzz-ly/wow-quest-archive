==Objectives==
Report to Rofilian Dane at the [[Nethergarde Mines]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].

==Description==
We don't have any hope of taking the Nethergarde Mines from the [[Alliance]]... at least not yet. [[Nethergarde Keep|Nethergarde]] is well-defended, and their supply routes are established and strong. Our goal, then, is to damage their economy. We can't take the mine by force, but with surgical strikes we can drastically reduce the mine's efficiency.

I have men creating a distraction outside the mines. Head east, sneak into the mines, and speak with Rofilian Dane for your assignment.  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40|}}
*4,050 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
Finally... another operative shows up.  I hope you're loosened up... it's time to tango, partner.
