== Objectives ==
Obtain 9 vials of [[Snickerfang Hyena]] Blood and 9 vials of [[Redstone Basilisk]] Blood.
*[[Snickerfang Hyena Blood]] (9)
*[[Redstone Basilisk Blood]] (9)

== Description ==
Like any good bloodmage, I perform my [[blood magic|magic]] with blood. All blood is different, and the [[Blasted Lands]] has several useful flavors, if you know where to look.

For our purposes? Basilisks and hyenas, even amounts. We're going to need plenty of it. Head west, to the center of the Blasted Lands. And don't forget... you can use that teleporter!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Do you have it? 

== Completion ==
<Kasim eyes the blood hungrily.>

More than enough, and still warm!  Now, let's get this ritual started, shall we?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Bloodmage's Gotta Eat Too]] before leaving. 

Once outside the cave, head west. Kill and loot every boar, hyena, and basilisk you can find until you've gotten everything.
