==Objectives==
Bring the [[fel]] lifeblood of [[Calefactus the Unleashed]] to [[Bloodmage Lynnore]] in the {{C|Blasted Lands}}
*[[Fel Lifeblood]]
*[[Infernal Lasso (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
I have fashioned a tool from the chain links you found. Those of your vocation might call it a "lasso" of sorts.

The energy within this chain is best suited for binding [[demon]]s, but seeing as Calefactus may be from beyond the [[Dark Portal|dark portal]], I suspect it will work on him as well.

If you take him down bring me a sample of his fel lifeblood. Such an anomalous being warrants further study.

Calefactus' current location among these wastes is unknown, but I trust you'll track him down, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4700 [[XP]]
*{{cost||75}}
*[[Infernal Lasso]]
*[[Rune of the Ravenous]]

==Progress==
Find that core hound quickly, <name>. Before the [[Twilight's Hammer]] finds him first.

==Completion==
Such an exquisite sample! Who knows what mysteries lie in the essence of a beast from beyond the portal?

As thanks, you may keep the lasso. I doubt I'll ever have use for such a thing, anyway.
