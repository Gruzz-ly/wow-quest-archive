==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kasim Sharim.jpg|Kasim Sharim|Blood wizard and eccentric recluse.}}
Report to [[Kasim Sharim]] in the back of the [[Serpent's Coil]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[A Letter to Kasim Sharim]] (provided)

==Description==
I need you to pass on a message for me.

Kasim Sharim is an old [[blood mage]] that knows a great deal about the [[demon]]s of the Blasted Lands. Though you wouldn't know from looking at him, he's quite old, and very powerful... if a little eccentric. As of late, he spends his days in the back of the Serpent's Coil, a cave not far from where you killed those cultists.

Please, deliver this message to him. He will know what it means.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
I don't know you.

==Completion==
Hah!  You [[Nethergarde]] nincompoops are always two steps behind me, and I'm nowhere near as fast as I used to be.

I don't need [[Watcher Mahar Ba|Mahar]]'s note to know what's going on.  Why do you think I'm cooped up in the back of this cave?  What I do need, however, is a strong <race> like you.

==Notes==
The cave is full of hostile mobs. You should be able to avoid fighting the ones that are sleeping. Don't worry -- you won't have to fight your way back out.

==Progression==
