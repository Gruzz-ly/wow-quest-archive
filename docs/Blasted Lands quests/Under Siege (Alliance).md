==Objectives==
Sabotage 3 Iron Demolishers.
*[[Iron Demolisher]]s destroyed (3)

==Description==
Those [[Iron Horde]] cannons are laying waste to our troops. I'm not sure how much more of this we can handle. Our forces are already spread too thin.

There has to be a way to stop those war machines.

==Rewards==
You will gain the following spells:
*Sustained Combat
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 XP

==Progress==
Those war machines are decimating us.

==Completion==
It will take the Iron Horde quite a while to get those demolishers operational again. Excellent work, <name>.

==Notes==
:''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|We cannot win this battle if those Iron Horde war machines remain operational.}}

Pick up [[Attack of the Iron Horde (Alliance)]] and [[Peeking into the Portal (Alliance)]] before heading out. Then go just southeast to the [[Shattered Front]] and start killing and interacting with three siege tanks. After that, head southwest across the Shattered Front. On top of a hill is a giant looking glass with Scout Pazerp dead on the ground at its base. Interact with the telescope to get a good view of the Iron Horde streaming out of the Dark Portal.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|With those machines destroyed we can focus our next move.}}
