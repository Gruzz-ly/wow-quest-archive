==Objectives==
Deliver the Discordant Rune to [[Watcher Wazzik]] at the [[Dark Portal]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Discordant Rune]] (provided)

==Description==
I was hunting a [[demon]] named [[Razelikh]], when his [[ogre]] lieutenant [[Grol]] assaulted me. I was caught unaware, and I died... but so did Grol.

Razelikh plans to return to the [[Blasted Lands]] and overwhelm the lands with his demons. Even now, he is preparing to summon his legions to eliminate us.

<The [[demon hunter]] quickly draws a [[rune]] in the air, then hands it to you.>

Deliver this to [[Watcher Wazzik|Wazzik]] at the [[Dark Portal]], to the southeast. He will guide you. Quickly! We haven't much time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|2100}}
*2110 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Do I know you, good <race>?

==Completion==
What?  [[Loramus Thalipedes|LORAMUS]]?!

Oh blast, keep it down, would ya?  If my boss gets word that I worked for Loramus, do you know how quickly I'd be on my rear end?!

<Wazzik takes the rune from you, presses it to his chest, closes his eyes, and nods.>

Well, you weren't lying.  Let's get to work.
