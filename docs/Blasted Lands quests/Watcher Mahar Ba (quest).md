== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Watcher Mahar Ba}} in the [[mage tower]] at [[Nethergarde Keep]]. 

== Description ==
It's time for you to visit the Watcher. He's been in a bit of a mood lately, and I'm not quite sure why.

Head up to the top of the mage tower and check in with him. I don't have any work for you here, but I'm certain that he will.

== Completion ==
My associates were correct to send you to me.  I have a problem which may threaten the sanctity of Nethergarde, and I need someone more capable than most.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||8}}

==Progression==
