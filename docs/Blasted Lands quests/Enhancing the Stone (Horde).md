==Objectives==
Bring Wazzik's Package to [[Loramus Thalipedes]] at the [[Dreadmaul Furnace]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Wazzik's Package]] (provided)

==Description==
<[[Watcher Wazzik|Wazzik]] finishes packing the materials up in a neatly-wrapped package.>

That's all that Loramus asked of us. When you see him, make sure you let him know how much of a help I was. I fear he will not see my hand in this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*4200 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
<Class>... you return...

==Completion==
This is sufficient.  If you see Wazzik again, you may tell him that he performed satisfactorily.  I will get the [[Blood magic|bloodmage]]s to work on fashioning the stone knife of sealing.  There is no need for questions now.  All will be revealed in time.

While they work, I have another task for you to complete.  Actually, make that three tasks.
