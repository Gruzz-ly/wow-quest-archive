==Objectives==
Return to [[Kalecgos]] in the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
It has been so many years since [[Shandaral]] has known true silence. With luck, our actions today will allow the echoes of this cursed place to fade.

You are due back in [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]], no doubt--and I think it is high time I fly there as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}

{{itembox||q1=5|Drake's Shadowflame Crest Fragment
|q2=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
The aftermath of the conflict in Shandaral has hung over [[Blue dragonflight|our flight]] like a pall for so many years. To think that [[Lanigosa]] has been toiling all this time to lay those [[Ghost|spirits]] to rest...

Thank you for lending her your aid, <name>. You have once again shown yourself a true ally to my people.
