==Objectives==
Speak to [[Lanigosa]] in [[Crystalsong Forest]].

==Description==
I have some idea of what Lanigosa might be doing in Crystalsong Forest, although I cannot imagine why she has taken it upon herself to do it.

That forest conceals within it the [[ruins of Shandaral]], a former [[highborne]] [[settlement]] and the site of one of the mortal [[race]]'s first clashes with the [[blue dragonflight]]. If Lanigosa truly is in Crystalsong, then it may well have something to do with Shandaral.

Seek her out there, <name>, and try to convince her to return to us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 5,950 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
Forgive me, <class>. I mistook you for a tormented [[arcane]] apparition.

...do not give me that look! You would be surprised at how easy a mistake that is to make out here.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Kalec opens a [[Portal to Crystalsong Forest]].''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Crystalsong's arcane corruption makes it difficult to ground a portal, but I should be able to get you close!}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Best of luck, my friend. Give Lanigosa my regards and tell her she is dearly missed here.}}

Take the portal to materialize at [[Zul'Drak]]'s entrance. Take the stairs below to find Lanigosa in an [[Unbound Thicket]] ruin there. Next to her is an [[Enchanted Logbook]].
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|Log entry three-hundred eighty-six. The echoes seem docile today. My search for the remaining relic shards continues.}}
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|With luck, my work will soon reach its end, so long as -- hold on a moment. You are actually alive, are you not? Well, that is certainly a refreshing change.}}
