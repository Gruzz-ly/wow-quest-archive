==Objectives==
Grant the echoes of [[Shandaral]] their final rest.
*Begin the ritual (Optional)
*[[Ghost|Spirits]] of Shandaral put to rest

==Description==
The time is upon us, <name>. With your help, most of the restless echoes of Shandaral have been quelled. However, some yet remain whose rage and sorrow burns too brightly to be eased by mere words.

Using [[Crystal Focus Fragment|the shards]] that you recovered, I have managed to recreate a facsimile of the [[Crystal Focus|crystal focus]] that brought Shandaral to ruin. Using it here should bring the anchored spirits to bear and give us an opportunity to grant them final rest.

Be on guard. I do not know how their long-held sorrows will manifest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}

{{itembox||q1=15|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
This will not be a happy ending--but it will be an ending all the same.

==Completion==
At last, the [[magic]] that was binding these tormented memories to this ruin has been broken.

It will be some time before the lesser echoes fully dissipate. Still, with their source finally banished and the relic's fragments removed, the fragments of memory that remained trapped here will finally be relieved of their torment.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Lanigosa is casting a spell.''
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|After all these years... These pieces you've brought me should finally be enough.}}
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|I have enchanted this new crystal focus with a beacon spell. Use it near a wellspring of [[arcane]] energy, and the remaining restless spirits will flock to it. The [[Great Tree|great crystal tree]] nearby should do nicely.}}
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|Shatter the crystal once the spirits have gathered within it, and the enchantment that binds them to these ruins should at last be broken.}}

Head toward the southern great tree and approach the Crystal Focus silhouette, which makes the extra action button appear:
*{{Abilities|Crystal Focus|id=406518|Infuse the Crystal Focus with [[mana]] to begin the ritual.|icon=inv_datacrystal07}}

Two waves of [[Discordant Echo]]es appear. 
*{{Text|say|Discordant Echo|Release us from this torment!}}
*{{Text|say|Discordant Echo|So many years... Again and again...}}
*{{Text|say|Discordant Echo|No! We cannot fail!}}
*{{Text|say|Discordant Echo|Cry torment! Our voices form as one!}}

Defeat them and the [[Amalgam of Desperation]] appears. During the fight, it summons several [[Arcane Detritus]].
:{{Text|say|Amalgam of Desperation|Years of torment, all for naught!}}

==Progression==
{{The Veiled Ossuary}}
