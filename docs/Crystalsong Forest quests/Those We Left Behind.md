==Objectives==
Ease the restless echoes of [[Shandaral]].
*Echoes soothed (6)

==Description==
In attempting to defend their home against the fury of the [[blue dragonflight]], Shandaral's [[mage]]s condemned the souls of their people to an eternity of crystalline torment.

Now their echoes wander aimlessly, reliving their civilization's doom again and again for more than ten thousand years.

I have found that some of the shades yet retain a shred of sentience. Perhaps they can be reasoned with--convinced to free themselves from the mire of their own ancient fear and pass on at last.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
The people of Shandaral were ensnared in a moment of supreme desperation. Their [[Ghost|spirits]] will not be easily assuaged.

==Completion==
This crystalline prison is not easy to escape. Still, with luck our work here will let the spirits that yet linger find some modicum of peace.

==Notes==
Head further and speak with the night elf ghosts. Based on the conversation option, they either attack, or simply vanish, both of which count toward the objective.

::{{Text|say|I stand for Shandaral!}}
::''The ghost turns hostile and attacks.''
:{{Gossip|Your [[Captain (rank)|captain]] sent me to relieve you. You can rest now.}}
::Rest? But the dragons fly for Shandaral! We have to stop them! I have to stop them!

::{{Text|say|Go away. Go away!}}
::''The ghost turns hostile and attacks.''
:{{Gossip|Shandaral has been gone for thousands of years.}}
::Gone? How can it be gone?

::{{Gossip|Think back. What do you really remember?}}
:::{{Text|say|I remember shadows on the horizon. Then stillness... Always stillness.}}
:::''The ghost dissapears.''
::{{Gossip|Well, it's kind of a long story...}}
::*{{Text|say|No, no, no, no...!}}
::*{{Text|say|No! Get away from me!}}
:::''The ghost turns hostile and attacks.''
::{{Gossip|What, afraid a dragon is going to swoop down and snatch you up?}}
::*{{Text|say|No, no, no, no...!}}
::*{{Text|say|Go away. Go away!}}
:::''The ghost turns hostile and attacks.''

;[[Wrathful Memory (Crystalsong Forest)|Wrathful Memory]]
:Wretched pawn of dragons! You will die by my hand!

:{{Gossip|Forgive me! I meant no offense in coming here.}}
::{{Text|say|Your kind are not welcome in Shandaral!}}
::''The ghost turns hostile and attacks.''
:{{Gossip|Ha! You think you scare me? Stand down.}}
::{{Text|say|You will not stand in the way of our legacy!}}
::''The ghost turns hostile and attacks.''
:{{Gossip|All that anger, and for what? What have you accomplished here?}}
::What do you mean? We -- we've defended Shandaral. I defended Shandaral.

::{{Gossip|Enough talk. Have at you!}}
:::{{Text|say|You will not stand in the way of our legacy!}}
:::''The ghost turns hostile and attacks.''
::{{Gossip|Look around. Shandaral fell by your own peoples' hands. Do not use your rage to shroud the truth.}}
:::{{Text|say|Perhaps you're right. For all my rage... I am so tired...}}
:::''The ghost dissapears.''
::{{Gossip|Oh, my mistake! Carry on, then.}}
:::{{Text|say|You cannot fool me! Die, dragon-servant!}}
:::''The ghost turns hostile and attacks.''

;On returning to Lanigosa
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|Log entry three-hundred eighty-seven. [[Kalecgos]] has sent a [[Adventurer|mortal]] to retrieve me. Truth be told, I had assumed they had forgotten about me. It is... nice, to be remembered.}}
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|I think I have run out of ideas. If reforging the [[Crystal Focus|crystal focus]] does not work, then I do not know what I will -- oh! Welcome back. Did you find anything?}}

==Trivia==
*The quest text says that the ghosts have been reliving the doom of the area for more than ten thousand years, but these events happened only 6,000 [[BDP]], not 10,000.
