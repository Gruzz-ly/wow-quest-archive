==Objectives==
Retrieve the fragments of the [[Crystal Focus]].
*[[Crystal Focus Fragment]] (6)

==Description==
[[Shandaral]]'s reckless use of the crystal focus placed too much stress on the relic, causing it to shatter. Its fragments have been scattered amidst the crystalline permafrost.

I can recreate the focus, but I will need you to collect enough of those shards to give me something to go on. You should be able to find them amidst the piles of crystal refuse scattered throughout the area.

Take heed, <class>. Those shards may still hold fragments of the [[mage]]s's memories from that fateful day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
[[Malygos]]'s rage fed Shandaral's desperation. Now [[Blue dragonflight|our flight]]'s failure is frozen in crystal for the world to see.

==Completion==
Malygos believed that we alone were capable of stewarding the myriad truths of the [[arcane]]. His--and our--failure to consider the potential of mortals led to the tragedy you see here.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|You have my thanks, friend. These echoes have been left to their self-inflicted torment for far too long.}}
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|I shall begin preparing the ritual needed to grant these [[Ghost|spirits]] their final rest. Return to me if you are able to find the shards I seek.}}

Looting [[Crystalline Remains]] has a chance to spawn [[Crystalbound Memory|Crystalbound Memories]]. Two crystals collected:
:{{Text|say|Crystalbound Memory (1)|Our [[scout]]s have returned from the forest's edge. There are [[Blue dragon|dragons]] on the horizon!}}
:{{Text|say|Crystalbound Memory (2)|They mean to reclaim their relic by force, then. And there are far too few of us to stand against the Blue Flight.}}
:{{Text|say|Crystalbound Memory (2)|Send word to the magi. We must use the relic; it is the only way we stand a chance against the fury of Malygos' brood.}}

Four crystals collected:
:{{Text|say|Crystalbound Memory (1)|You must be mad! We've barely scratched the surface of the focus's capabilities. It was never our goal to make it a weapon!}}
:{{Text|say|Crystalbound Memory (2)|What choice do we have? Malygos's brood flies to Shandaral. We know all too well how the Blue Flight responds to those who would dare expose their precious secrets.}}
:{{Text|say|Crystalbound Memory (2)|If we do not act now, then our plans will all have been for naught. The blue dragons cannot be reasoned with. We have to make a stand.}}

All crystals collected:
:{{Text|say|Crystalbound Memory (1)|The dragons are retreating! This power shall be Shandaral's salvation!}}
:{{Text|say|Crystalbound Memory (2)|Captain! The spell is too powerful! We cannot stop it!}}
:{{Text|say|Crystalbound Memory (2)|Stop channeling energy into the focus! At this rate, it will --}}
:''An arcane explosion occurs.''

;On returning to Lanigosa
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|Log entry three-hundred eighty-seven. [[Kalecgos]] has sent a [[Adventurer|mortal]] to retrieve me. Truth be told, I had assumed they had forgotten about me. It is... nice, to be remembered.}}
:{{Text|say|Lanigosa|I think I have run out of ideas. If reforging the crystal focus does not work, then I do not know what I will -- oh! Welcome back. Did you find anything?}}
