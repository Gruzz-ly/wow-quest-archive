==Objectives==
Collect 3 Pristine Skins from [[Primal Snapjaw]]s in [[Nazmir]].
* [[Pristine Crocolisk Skin]] (3)

==Description==
[[Xanjo]] asked dat I gather de materials for him to make some ceremonial armor.

He requested several pieces of [[crocolisk]] hide, but all de hides I have are flawed or scarred.

I need you to bring me a handful of fresh crocolisk hides dat are pristine.

De best source dat I know of are de primal snapjaws in Nazmir, as their hide is usually thick enough to avoid getting scarred when dey fight.

If you do dat for me, I will show you how to better harvest scales from, well... scaly creatures.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Skinning Technique: Scale Gathering (Rank 2)

==Progress==
Have you got de skins?

==Completion==
Excellent!

Dese are good! Well, usable... for de most part.

I will need to clean dem up before I can pass dem along. Regardless, look here and I will show you how to get more out of skinning things with scales.

<Rana uses the skins you brought to exemplify small tweaks to be made to your technique to yield better results.>
