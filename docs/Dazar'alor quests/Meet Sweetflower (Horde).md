Find [[Xun Xun Sweetflower]] in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
You have seen and learned much from these islands, but [[Zandalar]] is not de only place where you can learn. I have heard of a [[Winter's Kiss|flower]] dat cannot grow on dese islands.

If you want to know more about it, you will need to find someone more knowledgeable dan myself. Fortunately for you, I know of someone who may be able to help you.

Her name's [[Xun Xun Sweetflower]], and last I heard she set up shop on the outskirts of [[Anyport]] over on de human island of [[Drustvar]].

==Completion==
Oh, you'd like to learn about harvesting winter's kiss?  Well that's very fortunate, for both of us...
