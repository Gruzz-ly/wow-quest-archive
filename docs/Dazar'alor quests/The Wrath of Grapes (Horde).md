==Description==
You look familiar. Do you owe me money? Wait... no, that's not it.

If you are here to learn, I could show you my secret mining technique, bu- Ugh...

I am currently busy trying to see straight right now, amongst other things. Ugh... it feels like someone is swinging a pick at my skull.

De best cure for a hangover is pickle juice and a big greasy breakfast.

Tell you what, get me those things, preferably quickly and quietly, and I will teach you whatever want.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Storm Silver Seam (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
Dese shadows are loud. Can you fix dat, too?

==Completion==
Dis is just what I needed.

<Biru spends several moments shoveling food into his mouth.>

Mmm... Right! If I recall correctly, you were asking about de [[Storm Silver Ore|storm silver]] seams?

Let me tell you my secret technique, not even [[Secott the Goldsmith|Secott]] knows. De metal is prone to stress fractures, but instead of scoring de metal where it meets de rock and breaking it off, just remove de rock.

The metal naturally forms prisms, and can be easily pulled out of the stone without wasting anything once it is loosened up.
