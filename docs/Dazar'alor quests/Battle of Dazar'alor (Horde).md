==Description==
[[Zandalar]] is already under attack! [[Zandalari troll|My people]] are fleeing and de [[Alliance]] are infesting my streets.

[[Rakera]]'s [[scout]]s say dat Jaina Proudmoore is leading de assault.

She and her kind will pay for dis brazen assault on my people.

Gather your allies and push de Alliance back. We must protect [[Rastakhan|my father]] and destroy de Alliance!

==Progress==
We cannot afford any more setbacks.

==Completion==
To say that this attack was catastrophic would be an understatement. We have lost our major weapon in [[Fourth War|this war]].

You did manage to give us some victories, though. [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]] is dead, and Jaina Proudmoore badly injured.

Get your rest. [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas]] has been informed of what has happened and is forming a counterattack as we speak.
