:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|I should speak with de priesthood. Dey are not de ones who brought dis turmoil upon us.}}
:{{Text|say|High Prelate Rata|In due time, Princess. De sooner de loa grant you de throne, de better for Zandalar.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|My new council awaits you above, <name>. Rata and I will be along shortly.}}

;Approaching the council members
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|What do you think of my new council, <name>?}}
:''Rata joins them as well.''

;Wardruid Loti
This new pack of ours is growing stranger every day.

;General Rakera
After that business with G'huun and de siege of de city, Talanji needed someone who could maintain order.

Jakra'zet was many things, a firm hand among them. I hope I can fill his role without de more unsavory parts of his character.

Talanji brought me back from exile and gave me his job. I became General Rakera, much to Kaja's delight. Now in addition to leading Zandalar's armies, I am to give voice as one of de Zanchuli Council

It is an honor, and a chance to right de wrongs of de past.

;Hexlord Raal
It is good to see you agan{{sic}}, <name>.

<Hexlord Raal gestures to the other councilors gathered nearby.>

These are strange times for de Zandalari. Ordinarily I would be opposed to an exile AND a Tortollan among our ranks, but after all that has happened, perhaps change is what we need most.
