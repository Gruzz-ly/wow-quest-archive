==Objectives==
Bring the Exquisitely Crafted Brooch to [[Secott the Goldsmith|Secott]].
* [[An Exquisite Brooch (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
You find a bloody brooch that features impeccable craftsmanship.

The design and quality of work reminds you of [[Secott's Old Hand|rings]] you previously recovered for Secott.

Perhaps this is another item he lost and would like to see returned.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Monelite Seam (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
Wow, dis is a nice brooch. Good craftsmanship in it.

Whoever it used to belong to, it is mine now.

<Seeing the disapproval on your face, Secott sighs heavily while rolling his eyes and gives you a sidelong glance.>

Tell ya what, in exchange for dis, I guess I can tell you the rest there is to know about mining [[Monelite Ore|monelite]] seams.

<Secott explains in depth, several techniques which will allow you to mine monelite from seams more effectively.>
