==Objectives==
Travel to the location marked on your map and investigate the shrine in [[Vol'dun]]. Do what you can to repair the shrine, should the need arise.

==Description==
Dere are two more shrines here on [[Zandalar]]. Dis next one resides within Vol'dun, near [[Bonetrail Gulch]].

Hopefully de [[Faithless]] haven't defiled de shrine.

Here are de notes on dat location. Should dat shrine also need fixing, I think your skills with jewels will probably be enough to fix it.

* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Surveying the shrine, you believe that the sandy winds in this area have worn down the embedded gems, producing odd shapes and cracks in some.>
