==Objectives==
Return to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] on the [[Banshee's Wail]]. [[Muka Stormbreaker]] can give you a ride.
*Speak to Muka Stormbreaker

==Description==
[[Warfang Hold]] is our most secured of the footholds we hold in [[Kul Tiras]].

[[Centurion Kaga Warmstone|Kaga]] and her forces will be able to keep fortifications running, thanks to you. The [[Alliance]] will never see us coming!

Tell Nathanos that we have succeeded in our mission. I will help here until I am needed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250 [[Azerite (resource)]])

*[[Honorbound Artificer's Robes]]
