==Objectives==
Kill 8 Bloodbelly Flyers.
* [[Bloodbelly Flyer]] slain (8)
* [[Blood troll|Blood Troll]] slain (8)

==Description==
<Name>! I have some actual work that you could do for me.

Since your mining skills are still not what [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] consider "decent", in exchange, I will show you how to mine monelite better.

De blood trolls of [[Nazmir]] have dese enormous ticks that they keep as pets and I have heard dat dey have managed to get within de borders of [[Zuldazar]] to de north. Dis does not sit well with me.

Thin their numbers for me, so I can happily die by being eaten by a [[pterrordax]] or something else respectable instead.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Mining Technique: Monelite Deposit (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Commendable effort, and you seem no worse for wear. I need to remember dis next time I need something exterminated.

I doubt you have noticed that monelite is extremely maleable, ya? Otherwise I would not have to teach you dis method. But you can exploit its malleability, even before smelting it.

By using your pick to deform the metal while it is still in the vein, you can cause it to heat up and get a bigger haul using the other technique I taught you.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Blood Troll (mob)|Blood Trolls]], [[Reckless Cutter]]s, [[Savage Cursespitter]]s, and [[Blood Hexxer]]s.
