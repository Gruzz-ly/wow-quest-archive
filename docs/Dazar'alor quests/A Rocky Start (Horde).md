==Objectives==
Bring the book to [[Chronicler Grazzul|Grazzul]] and see if he can translate the text.
* [[Ancient Journal]]

==Description==
<As you thumb through the book, you see odd-looking runes carved out of jewels embedded in the stone pages. [[Seshuli]] notices you looking and approaches you.>

Ah, dat's been a treasure of mine for many years. Beautiful, isn't it? No clue what it says, but I've always reveled at de thought of something being written in jewels.

Come to think of it, I wonder if Grazzul would know what it says. <Name>, would you mind taking it over to him and see if he can translate it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What do you need?

<You hand the book over to Grazzul and ask for it to be translated. As he turns each page, wondrous expressions cross the [[scribe]]'s face.>

I've only heard of such books in existence but I've never seen one before. Do you know what dis is?

Dis is ancient earthen. And dis book is centuries old!

Of course I'll help to translate it, only... well... my ancient earthen isn't so great. I'll need some things to do dis.
