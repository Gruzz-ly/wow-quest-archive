==Objectives==
Speak to [[Baine Bloodhoof]] within [[Zuldazar]].
* [[Rokhan]] flight path

==Description==
[[Nazmir]] be havin' problem after problem, <name>. I not be knowin' how it can get much worse dan an [[Old God]] tryin' ta take over.

I be makin' me way back ta [[Zul'jan Ruins|Zul'jan]] ta lead our efforts ta keep Nazmir safe.

Ya should return ta Zuldazar and let Baine know what be goin' on here. Maybe he be likin' dis here [[underrot]], who knows?

I can get ya outta here and back ta Zul'jan, if ya be needin' it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
*[[Bwonsamdi's Golden Gong]]

==Completion==
So, an Old God lurks beneath the swamp and it's barely being contained?

Unbelievable. Princess [[Talanji]] was right in calling [[Rastakhan|her father]] a fool. How could he let such a thing stay so close to [[Zandalari Empire|his empire]]?

I will ensure that the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|warchief]] knows of your victory... and of our new problem.
