==Objectives==
Gather 100 War Resources. War Resources can be obtained from many sources, including [[quest]]s and treasure chests.
*[[War Resources]] (100)

==Description==
First things first. Remember... this is a war.

We accomplish nothing by simply adding the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] to our ranks. We eventually need to crush the [[Alliance]].

You and I will be leading operations in [[Kul Tiras]]. But first, we need resources.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have gathered enough war resources to begin the assault on Kul Tiras.

==Notes==
This introduces the [[Garrison Resources]] and [[Order Resources]] analog of ''Battle for Azeroth''.

Don't grind it all out this instant - the resources will come while working on the main storyline quests.

==Progression==
{{Mission from the Warchief}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Completion
<Nathanos looks over the gathered resources.>

This should do it.

==Patch changes==
