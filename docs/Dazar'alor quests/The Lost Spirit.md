==Objectives==
Speak with Princess [[Talanji]] in the [[Port of Zandalar]].

==Description==
It high time you an' I had a talk about ol' [[Vol'jin]]'s missin' [[Ghost|spirit]]. 

Dis goes beyond simple bargains and rights of passage. Spirits don' just go missin'.

You gotta few friends dat are gonna help ya track Vol'jin's spirit down. Dem who was friends to him in life should have da strength to find him in death. And if not, Talanji gonna help ya. 

Go to Talanji's ship in da Port of Zandalar. It be dat banged up ship ya came in on. You gonna do a little seance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]
* +10 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Completion==
I am here because [[Master Gadrin]] and [[Rokhan]] asked for my aid and it is my gratitude for their deeds and yours that makes me willing to do this.

NOT because [[Bwonsamdi]] insisted.

If he can't keep track of his own spirits that is a "him" problem, not a "me" problem.
