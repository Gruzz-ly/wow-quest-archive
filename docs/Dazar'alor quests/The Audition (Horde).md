==Objectives==
Craft 3 Drums of the Maelstrom and bring them to [[Atikka "Ace" Moonchaser|Atikka Moonchaser]].
* [[Drums of the Maelstrom]] (3)

==Description==
[[Xanjo]] has spoken highly of your skills, but I need to be certain of what you can do. I mean no offense, this is as much for your benefit as it is our own, as if you are not ready the task could kill you.

If you are willing, I would like to provide you with a test to see how well you can work leather.

Bring me three Drums of the Maelstrom that you have crafted yourself. This will prove your skill and consistency.

If your work is up to par, I will inform you of my plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Atikka breathes audibly in anticipation of your return.>

Have you got the drums?

==Completion==
Tight stitching. Even tension. No tears or holes.

You'll do nicely.

<Atikka leans in as he whispers.>

My plan is to make a set of drums from rare and powerful components. The drum's design will let you harness the raw, primal might of the slain beasts, and allow you to teach those [[Alliance]] dogs a lesson they won't soon forget. 

Using the drums will require a special mallet, but fear not. Once our work is done, I will teach you how to craft a mallet for yourself.

==Progression==
{{Instruments of Destruction (Horde)}}
