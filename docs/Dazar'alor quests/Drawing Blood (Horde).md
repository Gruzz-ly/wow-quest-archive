==Objectives==
Sign the Bloodbound Ledger.
*Bloodbound Ledger Signed

==Description==
Hey, <name>! I have something exciting to tell you about, but I need you to keep it secret. Just between us scribes.

<[[Chronicler Grazzul|Grazzul]] gives you a nod and pulls out a large tome.>

Dis is de Bloodbound Ledger. Signing your name in it let's you learn how to craft "blood contracts" which are rather dangerous, but worth de risk.

I only know one of dem and it is quite de rush when I use it because it... well, you'll see.

So what do you say? Interested?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's only a little bit of blood. Unless you have a REALLY long name...

==Completion==
Let me make sure you did it right.

<Grazzul finds your signature and nods.>

Yes, everything looks in order and it looks like de spell has already taken effect on you.

You are now worthy of knowing how to craft de "blood contracts".

But be careful with dem, <name>. I said it before and I'll say it again. They're dangerous things to play with.
