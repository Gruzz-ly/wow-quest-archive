==Objectives==
Talk with Captain Krooz to travel to [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]].
* Talk to [[Captain Krooz]]

==Description==
Whatever's waiting for us on the shores of Mechagon, we're going to be ready for it with this crew.

I don't hold any misconceptions about how that [[King Mechagon|crazy king]] is going to welcome us. Guns blazin', I'm sure.

So we're going in quietly on this [[Greasy Eel|submarine]]. Low profile'll keep us all safe.

When you're ready to go, talk to Captain Krooz.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Don't let the grass fool ya. Look at those bots on the shoreline. That city up ahead. That constant buzz of machinery and smog in the air.

This place is a technological gold mine.
