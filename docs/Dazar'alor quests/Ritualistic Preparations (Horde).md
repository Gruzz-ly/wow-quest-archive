==Objectives==
Mine [[:Unsanctified Storm Silver Ore]], smelt it into [[Unsanctified Storm Silver Ingots|Unsanctified Storm Silver Bars]], and get them blessed by [[Wavesinger De'zan]].
* Use Forge to smelt Unsanctified Storm Silver Ore into Ingots
* Storm Silver Ingots Blessed

==Description==
I have received a request for a shipment of [[Storm Silver Ore|storm silver]]. It is a fine metal, lightweight and resistant to corrosion. We use it althroughout our ships. It is so strong even de [[naga]] use it in some of their weapons!

However, any parts that go into de ship have to be blessed by a [[wavesinger]]. I can not be bothered with dat nonsense. I do not believe it needs these extra blessings, but what do I know?

Harvest a bucketful of ore and get it blessed for me, and I will teach you how to mine it easier.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Storm Silver Deposit (Rank 2)]]

==Completion==
Nice, dis looks good. Dey should not be able to tell dat I didn't gather it myself.

These bars will be used as part of our next [[warship]]. Well, after dey get gold plated.

What? You did not think dat de ornaments were solid [[gold]], did you?  Ha! Dat would cause dem to weigh tons!

Now then, you scratched my back, and I will scratch yours. Storm silver is very brittle naturally. When you mine it, use several small swings instead of one big one. Dis keeps de metal from being chipped away.
