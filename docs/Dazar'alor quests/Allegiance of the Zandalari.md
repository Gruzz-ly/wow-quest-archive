De Zandalari will join de Horde.

Our path together has been a long and difficult one. We have lost much together. De Horde has sacrificed for de Zandalari, and vice versa. I can do nothing to honor that commitment except pledge our loyalty.

Collect [[Sylvanas Windrunner|your Warchief]] and send them to my throne. I will extend de offer myself.

Without you, none of this would have been possible. You have done well, my champion.
