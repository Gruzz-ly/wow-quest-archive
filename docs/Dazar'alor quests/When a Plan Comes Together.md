==Objectives==
Listen to Nathanos' plan, then travel to Plunder Harbor.
* Listen to [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]]' plan
* Speak with [[Tattersail]] to sail to [[Tiragarde Sound]]
* Meet Nathanos in [[Plunder Harbor]]

==Description==
Having [[Derek Proudmoore]]'s body in our possession is a greater boon than we had planned for.

[[Marshal M. Valentine|Valentine]] is risen, but I think it best to allow Derek to lay dead for a bit longer.

It's time to use our new allies to our advantage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
And now, we wait.

==Notes==
{{Gossip|Tell me your plan, Nathanos.}}

:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|We have Derek Proudmoore's body. We do not need to raise any more [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] corpses. For now.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|It is time to move onto the next stage of our plan.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Zelling, would you do the honors?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Thomas Zelling]]|Yes, Blightcaller.}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|[[House Stormsong]] - my former [[tidesage]] brethren - possess a powerful artifact.}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|The [[:Abyssal Scepter]].}}
:''Thomas conjures an image of the Abyssal Scepter.''
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|To wield the Abyssal Scepter is to wield the very power of sea and storm.}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|This artifact is held under lock and key in the heart of the Kul Tiran capital of [[Boralus]].}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|And the [[Horde]] is going to steal it.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Very good. <name>, tell Tattersail we are ready to depart.}}

;Arriving to Plunder Harbor
:{{Text|say|[[Goblin Sapper]]|Do ya see the Kul Tirans yet?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Fogsail Pirate]]|Yes! That's the flagsh-- wait, nope... that's just a spot on the glass.}}

;Approaching the cave
:''[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] is standing near the entrance. Above it is the body of [[Derek Proudmoore]].''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|A bit... grisly, isn't it? I suppose if we wanted to get [[Katherine Proudmoore|Lady Proudmoore]]'s attention...}}

;Entering the cave
:{{Text|say|[[Lilian Voss]]|Come in, <name>. Nathanos will catch you up to speed.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Our mission here is to retrieve the Abyssal Scepter, located deep inside the [[Stormsong Monastery]] in Boralus.}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|The Scepter is an artifact of immense power over the sea. We will be able to use it to gain quite the advantage over the [[Kul Tiran fleet]].}}
:{{Text|say|[[Captain Amalia Stone]]|How are you going to sneak in? You cannot exactly just waltz into Boralus...}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|I sent [[Marshal M. Valentine|Valentine]] into Boralus to get a message to Lady Proudmoore, at any cost: We have your son.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Any time now, Proudmoore's elite forces should arrive here in an attempt to retrieve Derek's body.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Once the strongest of the guard has been drawn out, our friend Oculeth will open a portal for <name> and Zelling to go through and retrieve the scepter.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Captain Owings]]|Nathanos, I told you your Horde could make base in my harbor. I did not give you permission to lead the Proudmoore fleet to my very door!}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|We will pay you plenty for your trouble.}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Owings|Hmph.}}
