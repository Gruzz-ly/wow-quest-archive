==Objectives==
Collect 12 Heaping Handfuls of Damp Pollen.
* [[Heaping Handful of Damp Pollen]] (12)

==Description==
It looks like some beast managed to lap up all de pollen with it's tongue. It is curious as to what creature could have done dis, I doubt it matters.

You should be able to do dis yourself without needing any sort of rare or dangerous reagents.

Next time you find a [[Siren's Pollen|siren's sting]], wet your glove so the pollen will stick to it. Water, wine, blood... It should not matter.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Siren's Pollen (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
It may not be the most ideal gathering method you've ever experienced, but maybe this could work.

==Completion==
It seems like Jahden's theory was right. By wetting your gloves, you've managed to collect copious amounts of pollen.

==Progression==
