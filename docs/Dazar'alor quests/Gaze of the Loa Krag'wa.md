==Objectives==
"Witness" Krag'wa's trial.
* Speak to [[Krag'wa]]
* Krag'wa's trial complete

==Description==
Hello again, small one.

I see [[Talanji]] has chosen a worthy witness. I must test Talanji's willingness to sacrifice for [[Zandalari troll|her people]]. I will weigh her commitment to defending the weak. Many great rulers have failed this challenge and still gone on to make powerful monarchs.

But the most beloved, those that find themselves surrounded by loyal followers, always understand the value of devotion to their people.

You will help me with this trial. Speak to me when you are ready to begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is my hope that Talanji will honor your faith in her this day.

==Completion==
I would allow no harm to come to you, <name>. Fortunately for you, an intervention was not needed.

==Notes==
