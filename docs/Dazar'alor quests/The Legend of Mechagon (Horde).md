==Objectives==
Meet [[Gazlowe]] at the [[Abandoned Junkheap]] in [[Tiragarde Sound]].

==Description==
Heya, <name>. I was just tellin' [[Skaggit]] that I was hoping I'd run into you up here!

I caught wind of an [[Alliance]] operation into some old vault that opened in Tiragarde Sound.

In typical [[gnome|gnomish]] fashion, [[Tinkmaster Overspark]] is overreacting like crazy, claiming it's some lost connection to the gnome fairytale land of [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]].

<Gazlowe scoffs.>

I don't buy that for a second, but I am very interested in getting my hands on whatever tech's in that vault. You in?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Keep your head down! The Alliance beat us here!
