==Objectives==
Bring the Enormous Anchor Pod to [[Jahden Fla]].
* [[Enormous Anchor Pod#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
In all the gathering you've done, you have never come across an [[Anchor Weed|anchor pod]] of this size. Whatever the reason that it has gotten so large, there is much that can be learned from it.

Your mind wanders back to [[Jahden Fla|Jahden]], and if there is anything about it in the [[A Treatise on Anchor Weed|book]] you picked up earlier.

==Completion==
Hmm... Dis certainly appears larger than usual, even de book does not have anything on a giant seed pod. I have a thought...
