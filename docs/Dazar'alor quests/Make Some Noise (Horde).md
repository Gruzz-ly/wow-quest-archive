==Objectives==
Craft 6 Drums of Primal Might.
* Talk to [[Atikka "Ace" Moonchaser|Atikka]] to begin the ritual
* [[Drum of Primal Might]] (6)

==Description==
We have everything we need to craft the drum, except the [[Earth Mother]]'s blessing.

The drum is but a vessel, like a cup. We need her to imbue the drum with power, filling the cup so that we may drink.

It will not be easy to convince her to assist us in creating a weapon of war, but I will implore her to protect her children.

While I'm doing that, you will need to craft the drum itself.

Not too big, though. The larger the vessel, the more power it can hold, but the harder it becomes to carry. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Clearly exhausted, Atikka is trying to remain composed.> 

==Completion==
<Atikka lets out a beleaguered breath, before turning his head to face yours, smiling weakly.>

We've done it, <name>. 

==Notes==
Speak with Atikka to begin the ritual.
:{{Gossip|Begin the ritual.}}

You will be given the training recipe to make the drums, while Atikka kneels in prayer.

:{{Text|say|Atikka "Ace" Moonchaser|Grace us with your benevolence.}}
:{{Text|say|Atikka "Ace" Moonchaser|Bestow us with your gifts, so we may better protect your children.}}

Loot the [[Supple Hides]], [[Cleaned Brilliant Scales]], and [[Etched Bones]] in order to craft the drums.
