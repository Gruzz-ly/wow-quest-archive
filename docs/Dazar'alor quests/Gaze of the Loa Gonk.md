==Objectives==
Complete Gonk's trial.
* Follow [[Talanji]]
* Speak to [[Gonk]]

==Description==
The Lord of the Pack has requested to be the next to speak to Talanji. He is just up the steps on the next terrace.

I do not think he will require quite as much of you as I did, but I believe his words will be relevant to your purposes here.

<Krag'wa winks one massive eye.>

Do not think we are not aware of your intentions, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hello again, <name>.

==Completion==
<The [[raptor]] [[god]] eyes you speculatively.>

You will serve to remind Talanji of her priorities, if she is to answer the question I have posed to her.

==Notes==

;Speaking with Gonk
:I would like to pose a question to Talanji. Will you stand by while I do so?

:{{Gossip|As you wish.}}

:{{Text|say|Gonk|And what of the [[Horde]]?}}
