==Objectives==
Meet with [[Boss Mida]] at [[Warfang Hold]] in [[Stormsong Valley]].

==Description==
;Dark Ranger Alina
The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]] has important work for you, <name>.

Preparations are beginning for a meeting of the [[Horde]]'s leadership at [[Warfang Hold]]. I trust I don't need to emphasize that security is of the highest import for this gathering.

The [[goblin]], [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]], has sent his underlings to make sure the area is swept of any... unwanted guests. I need you to make sure they succeed in their task.

;Nathanos Blightcaller
<name>, the Dark Lady has need of your services once more.

The traitor, [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]], is being brought before the leaders of the Horde at Warfang Hold. Preparations are underway as we speak to secure the area.

The efforts are headed up by Gallywix's minions, who I wouldn't trust to secure a [[kennel]]. You will need to go to Warfang Hold and make sure the area is locked down.

We are counting on you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So Nathanos thinks we don't have the situation under control? Well, he's right. 

Just don't tell him that. Smug jerk would never let me hear the end of it.
