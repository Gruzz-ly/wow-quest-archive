==Notes==
;Speaking with Raal
{{Gossip|Ready to patrol.}}

:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|[[Wardruid Loti|Loti]]'s method is too grounded for my tastes. I prefer a [[pterrordax]]'s-eye view.}}
:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|It is like my loa always says: if you cannot see de source of corruption, go higher.}}

Click [[Ata the Winglord]]. She has two abilities:
#Farseer Totem
#Return to the Terrace

:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|I will call out de best spots, and you can have de honor of tossing down a [[sentry ward|sentry totem]].}}
:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|A few years back, dis whole land shook during da [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]]. Our northern gates fell, and swarms of [[blood troll]] savages poured through.}}
:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|Dat was when we got our first taste of real blood magic. Not dat petty nonsense practiced by de lesser tribes.}}
:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|Our defenses grow weaker. [[Princess Talanji]] has been asking for more troops. When her father did not act fast enough, she turned to de [[Horde]].}}
:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|Not a week goes by dat we don't see some Zandalari turning to blood magics learned from dose heretics of Nazmir.}}
:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|Hmm, something feels... different. I sense a great power resonating inside Zanchul.}}
:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|I will leave you with Loti. Let her know de cause of all dis trouble may lie within Zanchul itself.}}
