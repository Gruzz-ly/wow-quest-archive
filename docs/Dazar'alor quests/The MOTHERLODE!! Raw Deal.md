==Objectives==
Send a permanent--fatal--message to [[Mogul Razdunk]] in [[The MOTHERLODE!!]]
* [[Mogul Razdunk (tactics)|Mogul Razdunk]] slain

==Description==
Nobody, and I mean NOBODY double-crosses me and gets away with it!

The [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]] betrayed us in a deal for [[:Azerite]] refining techniques. We need pay 'em what we owe 'em.

If you're not pickin' up what I'm puttin' down, I mean we need to kill that backstabbin' upstart Mogul Razdunk.

You take care of him; I'll take care of gettin' what we're owed.

I s'pose we oughta tell [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Blightcaller]] about this, huh? When he tells us what to do, just smile and nod. We'll handle it our way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|21|40|}}
* 17,150 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
I'm mad as a... as a... I'm just MAD, okay?!

Look, I realize Blightcaller told you to get the refining techniques, but I'll take care of that.

You just kill Razdunk, got it? 

==Completion==
Ya really did me a solid there, <name>. May that green bastid rot in a squalid grave.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Hey, Mr. Blightcaller. I got some bad news...}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Mogul Razdunk double-crossed us! It was crazy! I nevah seen the green bastid back out of a deal like that. You wouldn't beli--}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Pull yourself together, Trade Prince. Such babbling does not befit a leader of the [[Horde]].}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Well excuuuuuuse me, Banshee Prince. Sorry if I'm rattled after nearly getting killed... in a deal that I was against making in the first place!}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief]] will not be pleased. We were counting on Razdunk's methods of refining Azerite in our war against the Alliance.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|That deal was more trouble than it was worth. There is an easier way to get what we want... by cuttin' out the middle man, if you get my drift.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Indeed. <Name>, head to [[Kezan]]. Acquire the Azerite refining techniques we were promised... and make Mogul Razdunk suffer for breaking his word to the Dark Lady.}}
:''Gallywix walks back.''

==Trivia==
*Gallywix's comment, "Well, excuuuuuuse me, Banshee Prince", is a reference to ''The Legend of Zelda'' segments of ''{{wp|The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!}}'' animated series, where the hero Link often replied "Well, excuuuuuuse me, princess!" to Princess Zelda as a catchphrase. Gallywix's tone is also similar to Link's.
