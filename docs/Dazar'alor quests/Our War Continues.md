==Objectives==
Speak with Sylvanas Windrunner aboard [[the Banshee's Wail]] in Zuldazar.
* Speak with [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] in [[Zuldazar]]

==Description==
;Sylvanas

The work to stop the [[Alliance]] is far from over, <name>. But thanks to you, we have the methods necessary to break them.

The [[:Abyssal Scepter]] has been delivered to King [[Rastakhan]], earning us more of his favor.

There is a matter of greater importance that I would speak to you about... but not here.

Meet me aboard the Banshee's Wail within Zuldazar.

;Nathanos
The work to stop the Alliance is far from over, <name>. 

King Rastakhan now possesses the Abyssal Scepter that you recovered from the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]]. He has placed it... in his treasury. 

The Dark Lady wishes to speak with you regarding the corpse you found at the bottom of the ocean. [[Derek Proudmoore]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
;Sylvanas
Derek Proudmoore's corpse will serve us well. In the meantime, we have more work to do.

;Nathanos
Our plans are in motion to bring down the Alliance and their allies.

We have much to do.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Sylvanas
:''Sylvanas is on the Banshee's Wail looking at the corpse of Derek Proudmoore that is being tended to by [[Dedicated Embalmer]]s. [[Kyra]] is above them.''
:Derek Proudmoore... yes, you'll do nicely.
:{{Gossip|What did you want to speak to me about, Warchief?}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Behold the fruit of your labors. Derek Proudmoore... the corpse you recovered from the depths of the [[Great Sea|sea]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|It shall prove a valuable weapon in our war against Kul Tiras. A dagger to plunge into the very heart of [[House Proudmoore]]... when the time is right.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|And thanks to your efforts, the [[Horde]] has secured the might of the [[Golden Fleet|Zandalari fleet]]. All that remains is to finish breaking our foes... then we will have victory in this war.}}
