==Objectives==
Take the [[Disgustingly Damp Flower]] to {{npc|Horde|Jahden Fla}}.
* [[Disgustingly Damp Flower#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
Rummaging for pollen as usual, you use the harvesting technique you learned from the [[Wasp|wasps]]. However, when you pull your hand away from the flower, you find that there is no pollen to be seen.

Looking inside the swirl of petals, despite it being a mature flower, you see that there is no pollen at all. Upon closer inspection you see that the flower is filled with a viscous liquid. Could the flower have done this?

While unpleasant to touch, you carefully pluck the flower to show [[Jahden Fla|Jahden]].

==Completion==
Hmm... Dis flower does not seem to have any pollen left. I cannot say that I have heard of a plant doing that before. Dis must be the work of some other creature.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Siren's Pollen (Rank 3)]]

==Progression==
