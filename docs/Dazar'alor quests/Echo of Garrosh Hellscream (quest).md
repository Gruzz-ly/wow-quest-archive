*Meet Anachronos outside Orgrimmar
*[[Echo of Garrosh Hellscream]] slain

==Description==
Our final destination will take us to the depths beneath your city of Orgrimmar.

The way there is barred, but I can get us inside.

Meet me outside the gates of Orgrimmar and we will descend together.

==Progress==
There are still some who believe Garrosh was a great leader.

==Completion==
Yes, this thrums with power! This is precisely what I needed.

==Notes==
Meet Anachronos at [[Rocktusk Farm]] outside of Orgrimmar at {{co|40.7|16.3|Durotar}} and speak with him:
{{Dialogue|
I would not be aiding you with this task if I did not believe it was important.

{{Gossip|I am ready to seek the Echo of Garrosh.}}

Anachronos teleports the adventurer into the [[Inner Sanctum (Siege of Orgrimmar)|Inner Sanctum]] in the [[Siege of Orgrimmar (instance)|Siege of Orgrimmar]].

:{{text|say|Anachronos|Garrosh Hellscream... Such a pity how things turned out.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|In countless potential timelines, he was seen as a great hero of his people. Some called him the Horde's greatest warchief.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|What you saw here was one of his worst possible incarnations. A waste.}}

Leap down into the room and click the [[Time Rift (Siege of Orgrimmar)|time portal]].

:{{text|say|Echo of Garrosh Hellscream|I am your death.}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Garrosh Hellscream|My people should have taken this world long ago during the First War, but they fell to corruption. In their weakness, they allowed the pitiful races of Azeroth to join the Horde. I will succeed where they have failed, and no power in this world can stop me!}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Garrosh Hellscream|For the True Horde!}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Garrosh Hellscream|Blood and Thunder!}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Garrosh Hellscream|Witness the power of the True Horde's arsenal!}}

Should the player die:
:{{Text|yell|Echo of Garrosh Hellscream|Weak.}}

Defeat the echo while avoiding his whirlwinds and the Kor'kron iron stars.

:{{text|yell|Echo of Garrosh Hellscream|No... It cannot end...like this...What I... What I have seen...}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Even as a reverberation of the past, Garrosh was a formidable foe.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|I sense the threads of fate upon you. You are indeed worthy of what is to come next.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Had there been any doubt, I would never have allowed the shard to fall into the wrong hands. Not again.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Go. Return to Oculeth. With the shard restored, he can send you to the place you seek.}}

Return to Oculeth in the [[Hall of Ancient Paths]] in [[Dazar'alor]] on your own.

*This version of the Siege of Orgrimmar has no map, instead it shows the Azeroth world map.
*Should you die, you spawn in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]], but it won't allow you to enter with the regular Siege of Orgrimmar portal, nor can you teleport yourself back to the scenario since upon dying you are removed from the group. Instead, you have to revive yourself at the Spirit Healer and return to Anachronos in Durotar.
