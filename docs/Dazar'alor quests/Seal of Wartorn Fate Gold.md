Required money: {{Cost|2,000||}}

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|Seal of Wartorn Fate
}}

==Progress==
Do you ever wish to retry your fate?  Perhaps, for a special armor piece, a weapon or a trinket of great power?

For a price, I will provide you a seal that twists fate and grants an extra result at a past chance. 

Once you possess a seal, it will activate after defeating powerful foes in difficult dungeons and raids.

Choose how you want to pay wisely, for two seals a week is all the power you can manage.

==Completion==
A good choice.  Remember, only two seals a week.
