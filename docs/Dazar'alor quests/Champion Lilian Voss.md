==Completion==
I have fought alongside you in [[Horde War Campaign|this campaign]] for some time now, <name>.

We have witnessed firsthand the lengths that the [[Horde]] will go to to win. It may not always be pretty, but in the end we have achieved the upper hand.

I am curious to watch what [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] does next. I am also curious to watch you.

You are an honorable man, <name>. Allow me to continue this fight by your side.
