==Objectives==
Meet with [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
* Speak with Sylvanas in Orgrimmar
* Listen to [[Dark Ranger Lenara|Lenara]]'s Report

==Description==
The Dark Lady requests your presence in Orgrimmar, <name>.

It seems the rats have finally come out of hiding. Which will make it all the easier to exterminate them.

Do not delay. We have waited for this moment long enough.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
These traitors will be dealt with. No more leniency. No more weakness.

==Notes==
Sylvanas is standing in [[Grommash Hold]] with Dark Ranger Lenara by her side.

Upon finding Sylvanas:
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Ah, <name>. Ever the loyal soldier.}}

Speak with Sylvanas:
:The traitors have made themselves known. It shall be easy to purge their disloyalty from the [[Horde]].

:{{gossip|Reporting for duty.}}

:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|My [[dark ranger]]s have vital information to share with you.}}

Speak with Lenara:
:I have been tracking [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] and [[Thrall]] after we let them escape. Their treason knows no bounds. They now conspire with our sworn enemies.

:{{gossip|(Quest) What is Saurfang's plan?}}

The cinematic [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DjwOglqONg The Negotiation] plays:

:''[[Anduin Wrynn]], accompanied by [[Valeera Sanguinar]] and [[Master Mathias Shaw]], rides through [[Dustwallow Marsh]] to the ruins of [[Theramore Isle|Theramore]], answering a letter from Saurfang...''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Anduin. Sylvanas' actions have threatened us all and day by day, her power grows.}}
:''Anduin dismounts [[Reverence]] outside a ruined watchtower, where he is greeted by [[Baine Bloodhoof]] and [[Jaina Proudmoore]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|If our world is to survive we must strike while we still can. Meet with me and we will speak.}}
:''Anduin ascends the ruined tower to meet with Saurfang, looking out at the encampment of Horde soldiers following him.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|So few...}}
:''Saurfang gives a slight grunt of agreement.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|How many can you provide?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Enough for one final assault. If that fails... we're done.}}
:''Anduin looks up at Saurfang.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|If we end her reign, what kind of warchief will you be?}}
:''Saurfang holds the necklace of [[Dranosh Saurfang|his fallen son]] in his hand.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|The [[Old Horde|Horde]] I joined was birthed in blood. Tainted by [[Fel|corruption]]. The road that led to the [[Dark Portal]] was long and wide paved with the bones of [[draenei|innocents]]. We called it the [[Path of Glory]].}}
:''Saurfang pounds his hand against the stone.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|That was the great lie upon which the Horde was founded... that anything we did was honorable. Thrall, [[Vol'jin]]... they were not the true heirs to [[Blackhand]]'s bloody legacy. Sylvanas Windrunner is.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|No. No, this is the Horde. Led by you. Someone who has...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Honor...}}
:''Saurfang snorts in derision.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|I've never known honor. They deserve more. But the Horde is doomed to be shackled by the chains of the past.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|The Horde has no exclusive claim to regrets. [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]], [[Daelin Proudmoore|Daelin]]... The ghosts of the past haunt us as well.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|We could not fill the chasm between the Horde and Alliance if we labored 1000 years. You know this.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Then what are we fighting for?}}
:''Saurfang is silent as he heads down outside the tower, Anduin following him. As he exits the tower, he grabs his axe.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Soldiers! On your feet!}}
:''The Horde troops stand, including [[Lor'themar Theron]], [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]], Thrall, and [[Rexxar]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Start breaking camp immediately!}}
:''[[Zekhan]] looks up at Saurfang questioningly.''
:{{text|bossemote|Zekhan|Lord Saurfang?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Zekhan... Where is our home?}}
:''Zekhan thinks for a moment.''
:{{text|bossemote|Zekhan|Orgrimmar?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Not our city. Our home.}}
:''Saurfang puts a hand on the young troll's shoulder. Zekhan realizes what he is asking.''
:{{text|bossemote|Zekhan|[[Azeroth]].}}
:''Anduin turns to Jaina.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|And ours?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Azeroth.}}
:''Anduin raises his voice so all can hear him.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Right now, there are only two forces in this world that matter. One bent on harming our world.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|And one that will protect her.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Zekhan|So... what are we doing?}}
:''Saurfang glances at Anduin with a smile.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Breaking the cycle.}}
