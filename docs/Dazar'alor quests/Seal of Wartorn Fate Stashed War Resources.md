==Progress==
Tempting fate yet again? The cost has increased and I offer other cheaper ways to pay. 

However, if you want to pay this fee, who am I to stop you?

Choose how you want to pay wisely, for two seals a week is all the power you can manage.

==Completion==
A good choice.  Remember, only two seals a week.
