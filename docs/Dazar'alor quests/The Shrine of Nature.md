==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Shrine of Nature]] in [[Zuldazar]].

==Description==
Another shrine resides right here in Zuldazar.

According to de journal, de [[earthen]] talks about creating green hued jewels dere. I wonder if dat's anything like de [[:viridium]] we find in de ore we mine.

Go and see if de shrine still stands. Hopefully, we can still make use of it.

I'll continue to study de journal for more information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<As you observe the shrine, it's quite clear that the central jewel is badly broken and in need of replacement.>

==Notes==
The dirt path to the shrine starts at {{co|42.2|66.8|Zuldazar}}.

==Progression==
{{A Rocky Start (Horde)}}

==Patch changes==
