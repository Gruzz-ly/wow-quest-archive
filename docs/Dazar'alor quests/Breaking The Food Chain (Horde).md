==Objectives==
Kill 12 Ravenous Jacunda.
* [[Ravenous Jacunda]] (12)

==Description==
De extra [[Riverbud|riverbud]] you planted has helped, but it has not been enough. Some of de local beasts are consuming de riverbud before dey can mature. We need dese plants to germinate, or we could risk losing it entirely.

The largest group of young riverbud consumers are de jacunda. If we are going to give de riverbud a chance to survive dis, you will need to thin their numbers.

Do dat and I will teach you everything I know about riverbud.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Riverbud (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Thank you for putting de fish down. I do not regret dis action, as dey would have starved if de riverbud ran out, so at least dey had a quicker death.

The secret to riverbud is dat dere are additional bulbs in de root system. Just pull de plant by de vine firmly with steady pressure.
