==Objectives==
Slay 15 Dockside Ruffians.
*Dockside Thugs slain (15)

==Description==
Where are de guards? 

Princess [[Talanji]] has convinced King [[Rastakhan]] to permit outsiders in our port. For de first time in centuries, we have allowed non-[[troll]]s to set foot on our shores and peddle their wares.

And now trolls of lesser [[tribe]]s seem to think dey can take advantage of these [[merchant]]s?

I will not allow dis sort of behavior. While I investigate why de merchants are not protected, I want you to work your way through de [[Grand Bazaar|bazaar]] and slay any thugs you find.

Send dem a message.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
If Zuldazar is to once again be a shining jewel, we must learn to work with de other races.

==Completion==
You have my thanks. I think having someone of de Horde dispense dis justice was extra fitting.

De fact dat we have left our harbor so unprotected worries me greatly.

==Notes==
Kill: [[Amani Thug]]s, [[Gurubashi Thug]]s, and [[Sandfury Thug]]s.

==Progression==
{{Port of Zandalar}}

==Patch changes==
