==Objectives==
Bring the Exceptional Platinum Shard to [[Secott the Goldsmith]].
* [[Exceptional Platinum Shard#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
Out of dumb luck, you've managed to extract an exceptionally large shard of [[Platinum Ore|platinum]], instead of several smaller chunks.

You wonder to yourself if [[Secott the Goldsmith|Secott]] could teach you to harvest this much every time.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Platinum Deposit (Rank 2)]]

==Completion==
Hey, dis is actually pretty impressive. A decently sized shard of platinum in a single piece.

I can only assume dat dis was done unintentionally?

Let me save us both some time, I will tell you everything I know about platinum. If you have any further questions, take dem to someone else.

De ore forms with striations, like de grain in wood. Keep your pick aligned with de strata when you swing and it will keep de chunks intact, instead of breaking apart.
