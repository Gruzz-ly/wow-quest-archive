==Objectives==
Return to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] on the [[Banshee's Wail]]. [[Erul Dawnbrook]] can give you a ride.
*Speak to Erul Dawnbrook

==Description==
Look at [[Plunder Harbor|dis place]], boss-mon! We got da [[Fogsail Freebooters|pirate]]s, a location close to da [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] [[Boralus|capital]]...

I tink we should be bein' pretty proud of dis one.

We should get goin' back and tell Nathanos about our success. Maybe we can even get him to crack a smile.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
That's quite a location [[Shadow Hunter Ty'jin|Ty'jin]] scoped out.

The [[pirate]]s are another boon. If we ever need some bodies to fall on swords for us... they will do.

==Progression==
