==Objectives==
Observe Sylvanas's discussion with Princess Talanji.
* Observe Lady [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] and Princess [[Talanji]]
* Speak with Lady Sylvanas Windrunner at the [[Banshee's Wail]]

==Description==
I'll admit, I did not think the [[Anduin Wrynn|Little Lion]] had it in him to kill King [[Rastakhan]]. Blood has been spilled, and vengeance must be had.

Give me a moment to express my condolences, then come with me. We have more to do to win this war.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +2000 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Completion==
[[Derek Proudmoore]] will be twisted to become a weapon against [[Katherine Proudmoore|Katherine]] and [[Jaina Proudmoore]].

The [[Alliance|Allliance]]{{sic}} brought an army to kill Rastakhan. All we'll need is one [[Forsaken]] to kill their leaders.

I will contact you when your aid is further needed. In the meantime, continue the fight against the Alliance, we must survive until this plan is ready.

==Notes==
;Upon acceptance
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|My condolences on your loss, princess. Excuse me... Queen Talanji.}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Titles mean little to me now. I must know... with de [[Golden Fleet|Zandalari navy]] in ruins, does de [[Horde]] intend to abandon us?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|We do not turn our back on our allies, Talanji. The war campaign has taken an unfortunate turn, to be certain... but our cause is not lost.}}
:''[[Nathanos Blightcaller]] walks to Sylvanas.''
:{{text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|My queen... reports are coming in from all outposts. The Alliance is tightening its grip. Victory is within their grasp.}}
:{{text|say|[[Baine Bloodhoof]]|Perhaps we can open negotiations--}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|The Alliance slays the leader of the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]], and you speak of negotiations?}}
:''Sylvanas turns and steps closer to the crowd.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|No. This war will not end until we stand victorious. Until the Little Lion kneels before my throne.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Meet me aboard the Banshee's Wail. I have a plan to ensure the [[House Proudmoore|Proudmoore family]] pays dearly for Rastakhan's death.}}
:''Sylvanas leaves, followed by Nathanos and Baine. Baine made a salute to Talanji before leaving.''

;Aboard the Banshee's Wail
:''Sylvanas, Nathanos and [[Kyra]] gather around the coffin which contains the corpse of Derek Proudmoore. [[Eitrigg]] is also present.''
Speak with Sylvanas:
:Good, you're here. We will begin.
:The Proudmoore family was behind the death of King Rastakhan.
:It is only suiting that we deal with them first.

===Cutscene===
:''Baine appears.''
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Sylvanas!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|What reason could you possibly have for this madness?!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Derek Proudmoore was a hero to the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|They are sure to stage a rescue attempt when they learn of his fate.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|And once his mind has been properly conditioned, we will allow the Proudmoores to recover their long-lost prince...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|... so he can slaughter them in their sleep.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|This is too far!}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|How many times must we forsake our honor?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|There can be only victory or [[death]] for us, Baine.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|And death is mine to master.}}
:''Kyra resurrects Derek.''
:{{text|say|Derek Proudmoore|What...what is this? Why am I... What have you done to me?!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Why Lord Proudmoore, I've given you a chance to reunite with your family.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|You should be grateful.}}
:{{text|say|Derek Proudmoore|<Derek Wailing>}}
