==Description==
You can see me?

Oh, thank goodness! I thought I was lost in the folds of time...again!

But for one to see through the folds of time's fabric... you must be a very talented [[Tailoring|tailor]], indeed.

Would you bring me some cloth, then, tailor? I believe I'll be able to place just when I am with your help and right myself.

* {{cost|5|85|}}
* 4,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
When in [[Azeroth]] am I...?

==Completion==
You're back! That was fast...or, was it?
