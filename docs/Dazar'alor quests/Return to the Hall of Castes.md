==Objectives==
Take [[Azala]] back to the [[Hall of Castes]] in [[Zuldazar]]. Make sure to call for her if she is not present when you get there.
* [[Casteless Zandalari Whistle]]

==Description==
I can't believe I got to visit so many places. I've never even left Zuldazar before!

I may be casteless, but now dat I've met so many [[loa]], maybe I can follow one and have a future off of de streets.

But for now, we should go back to de Hall of Castes. De caretakers must be waiting for me.

* [[Slimy Pouch]]

* [[Well-loved Figurine]]

You will also receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]
