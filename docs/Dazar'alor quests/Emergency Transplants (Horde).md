==Objectives==
Plant 10 Riverbud Seeds in rivermud.
* [[Rivermud|Riverbud Seeds]] planted (10)

==Description==
[[:Riverbud]] is a precious resource for us. Not only does it have potent magical properties, but it also feeds many of de beasts we train or eat ourselves.

However, de [[Blood troll|Blood Trolls]] have been dumping a lot of cursed blood in de rivers. It may not be their goal, but if we do not act soon, de pollution may wipe out all de riverbud.

I need you to take dis handful of seeds, and plant dem in de rivermud. In exchange, I will teach you how to harvest it more effectively.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Riverbud (Rank 2)]]

==Completion==
I cannot thank you enough. Riverbud is absolutely critical to both de [[Zandalari]] and to de wildlife. Regardless, I said I would teach you, and I am true to my word.

De riverbud you have harvested looks blown out.  When you go to pick the bulbs, do not just rip dem off of the plant.  Instead, twist dem first so they pinch de stem closed. It will keep de fluid from draining out.
