==Objectives==
Report to [[Throk]] in [[Zuldazar]].

==Description==
Our focus must expand beyond [[Kul Tiras]]. The [[Alliance]] still presses against our forces in other parts of the globe.

We are most interested in the [[Arathi Highlands]], near [[Stromgarde]]. We've set up an encampment in the area, with the intent of capturing Stromgarde.

Speak with Throk, the recruitment officer for the division in charge of this particular [[warfront]]. He could use a good <class> like you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're <name>, with the [[Honorbound]]?

Welcome. We've heard about you. Let's get to work.

==Progression==
{{Horde Warfront}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
