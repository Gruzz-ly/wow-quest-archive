==Objectives==
Return the Ancient Skinning Knife to [[Rana the Cutta]].
* [[Ancient Skinning Knife]]

==Description==
Within the scarred flesh of the beast, you find a notched golden blade embedded under its skin.

Carefully extracting the blade, you can't help but feel like this is an old [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] skinning knife.

You should show this to Rana the Cutta.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*Skinning Technique: Leather Gathering (Rank 3)

==Completion==
Ha ha! If I did not know better, I  would say dis was de skinning knife of my old master.

He went out to collect some pelts a couple years ago, and never came back. I figured de idiot got crushed by a log.

If dis was in it's skin, he must have thought he killed it, only to have it wake up and finish him off.

I needed dat laugh. Thank you for dat. Lemme make it up to you.

<Continuing to chuckle to herself, she uses her master's knife to show you a trick to harvesting leather from a kill.>
