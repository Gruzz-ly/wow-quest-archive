==Objectives==
Report to [[Captain Rez'okun]] at the [[Port of Zandalar]].

==Description==
Our [[spies]] have intercepted an [[Alliance]] message describing an outcropping of [[:Azerite]] out in the [[Great Sea]].

The [[Banshee's Wail]] isn't quick enough to get us there before they do. Lucky for us, I've arranged to have a [[Zandalari]] ship rigged and ready to go for opportunities like this.

Go speak with Captain Rez'okun on the western side of the docks. He's been briefed, and should be waiting for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You da [[Horde]] [[Adventurer|champion]] I'm waitin' for? Let's get to work.

==Progression==
{{Mission from the Warchief}}

==Patch changes==
