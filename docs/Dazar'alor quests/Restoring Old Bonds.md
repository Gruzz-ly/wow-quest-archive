==Objectives==
Speak with [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Oculeth]] to travel to {{Au|Draenor}} and meet with the {{Au|Mag'har}}.

==Description==
We must speak to {{Au|Grommash Hellscream}} and remind him of his debt to us. Everything rests on this mission, <name>.

I hope your skills in diplomacy are greater than mine.

Be on your guard; we do not know what to expect on the other side.

==Completion==
We're not dead yet. I suppose that's a good sign.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|The streams of time and reality are ever-shifting. The anchor to the world you seek will be tenuous.}}
:{{text|say|[[Eitrigg]]|Can you hold the way open long enough for us to bring the orcs of Draenor through?}}
:{{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|I will send the shard through with you. When you are ready, it will bring you home.}}
:{{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Go. But take care not to lose yourself amongst the strands of fate.}}

Talk to Oculeth:
:{{Gossip|I am ready to go to Draenor.}}
''Note: You will be placed in a special [[Phasing|phase]] of Gorgrond and will be unable to fly (even if you have earned [[Draenor Pathfinder]]).''

Oculeth teleports the player and Eitrigg to [[Brimstone Springs]] in [[Gorgrond]]. The Mag'har guards tense up and raise their weapons while a [[Mag'har Outrider]] approaches, followed by {{Au|Lantresor of the Blade}}.

:{{text|yell|Mag'har Outrider|Intruders!}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Stay your hand! We come in peace to speak to your warchief.}}
:{{text|yell|Lantresor of the Blade|Silence! The overlord will decide your fate. Bind them!}}

The player and Eitrigg are bound to the Outrider by ropes. Follow the Outrider into camp.

:{{text|say|Mag'har Outrider|Green skin... disgusting! I have heard tales of this corruption, but never seen it.}}
:{{text|say|Lantresor of the Blade|Be wary. For all we know, they are spies sent by the [[draenei]].}}
:{{text|say|Mag'har Outrider|The overlord will know what to do.}}

The party enters [[Hellsreach Citadel]], the new fortress of the Mag'har. As they approach the main hall, [[Overlord Geya'rah]] approaches.

:{{text|say|Lantresor of the Blade|Overlord Geya'rah! We have prisoners.}}
:{{text|say|Mag'har Outrider|They are Lightbound spies! Filthy traitors!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|We will see. Speak, intruders. Who are you?}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|I am Eitrigg of the [[Blackrock clan]]. We come from [[Azeroth]] on behalf of our warchief.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|There is but one warchief... and you are no Blackrock! But let us put your words to the test.}}
