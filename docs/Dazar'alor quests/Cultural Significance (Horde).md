==Objectives==
Learn the importance of [[Sea Stalk|sea stalks]] from people in the [[Port of Zandalar]].
* Ask [[Wavesinger De'zan]] about Sea Stalks
* Ask [[Captain Rez'okun]] about Sea Stalks
* Ask [[Dockmaster Cobo]] about Sea Stalks

==Description==
I have noticed dat your skill with harvesting plants has improved, but I have also noticed dat you just treat each flower and leaf as a commodity. De flora of dese islands have a rich history, with a deep cultural significance to us.

Go down to the Port of Zandalar, and ask some of the men and women what a sea stalk means to them. Learn from us, and l will make it worth your while.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Sea Stalk (Rank 2)]]

==Completion==
De sea stalk has a unique magical property dat allows de stalk to provide de flower water, even if de flower is cut off.

Sailors will give their loved ones a flower and keep de stalk on themselves, so if dey fall over board, de salt water kills de flower. What you hold is more dan a stick, it is a family member's life.

As for your lesson, unlike most other magic plants, de best material to harvest for magical essence is de stem, not de leaves or flower.

==Notes==
;Wavesinger De'zan
:{{text|say|[[Wavesinger De'zan]]|My mother died when I was very young, leaving me to be raised by my father. He used to be a sailor, and always left de flower of a sea stalk with me when he went to sea.}}
:{{text|say|[[Wavesinger De'zan]]|When it wilted, I knew I was on my own, so I immediately got a job here on de docks. Dat flower kept me from becoming a vagrant, like so many others.}}

;Captain Rez'okun
:{{text|say|[[Captain Rez'okun]]|[[Sea Stalk|Sea stalk]], eh? Some of my crew makes sure dat their other half always has one when we ship out. I do not blame dem for wanting to keep their family from agonizing over their fate should something happen.}}

;Dockmaster Cobo
:{{text|say|[[Dockmaster Cobo]]|Bah! Cursed things! De only thing sea stalks mean to me are good sailors not coming home and cargo sitting at de bottom of de sea.}}
