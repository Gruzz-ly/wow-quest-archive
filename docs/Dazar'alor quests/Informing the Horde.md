==Objectives==
Speak with [[Baine Bloodhoof]].

==Description==
[[General Jakra'zet]] has been defeated, but his plan to summon [[Mythrax]] succeeded despite our best efforts.

Were it not for the mercy of [[Sethraliss]], I doubt we would have made it out of [[Atul'Aman]] alive.

We must inform our allies of what has transpired in [[Vol'dun]].

I'll speak with [[princess Talanji]] myself. You should go and speak with the [[Horde]]. We need all the help we can get now.

I'm sure our paths will cross again, <name>. It was an honor fighting with you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|1|94}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I shall inform the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]] of your activities in Vol'dun at once. She will know how to best proceed against this new threat.

==Notes==
Baine is located at the [[Great Seal]] in [[Dazar'alor]]. This quest can be followed up by [[Nazmir (quest)]] and [[Zuldazar (quest)]] if the player hasn't completed those already.

==Progression==
{{Atul'Aman}}
