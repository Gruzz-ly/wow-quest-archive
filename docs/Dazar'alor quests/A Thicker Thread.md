==Objectives==
Loot 5 Strands of Thick Webbing from [[Jungleweb Crawler]]s in [[Vol'dun|Vol'Dun]]{{sic}}.
* [[Thick Webbing]] (5)

==Description==
<Name>! I was hoping you would show up!

[[Xanjo]] is nearly finished with de suit of ceremonial armor he has been working on, but dere is a problem.

He says dat de thread he used is too thin, and dat de weight of de leather is ripping out de stitching.

He asked me to get something dat will hold, and de best thing I can think of is de thick webbing of jungleweb crawlers.

You can find dem in northern Vol'dun. Bring me back some strands of their thick webbing, and my knowledge of scales is yours.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Skinning Technique: Scale Gathering (Rank 3)

==Progress==
So, did you get de silk?

==Completion==
Yes, dis should do nicely.  Once de thread is replaced with dis webbing, dat armor is never going to fall apart!

Although... dis is stickier dan I was expecting. I will have to ask Xanjo if dat is going to be a problem.

But first, your lesson. Learn quickly, my pupil.

<Rana picks up a skin covered in scales, and shows you how to more effectively remove the skin without damaging the scales.>
