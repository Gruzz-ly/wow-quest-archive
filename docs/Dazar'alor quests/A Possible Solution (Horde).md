==Objectives==
Travel to [[Nazmir]] and seek out [[Zukashi]].

==Description==
None of dese things are working. I can't believe I'm saying dis, but I think you're gonna have to find Zukashi.

Maybe you could convince him to give up de other half of de recipe. He's pretty full of himself, but he isn't unreasonable.

Last time I heard, he's staying in Nazmir near [[Gloom Hollow]]. Maybe it's best to tell him dis isn't about me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Who are you? Another one of [[Clever Kumali|Kumali]]'s apprentices coming to learn de true art of alchemy?

Or is dere someting else you're interested in?

<You explain to Zukashi that you're researching a special transmutation stone and that he might be able to help you.>

Oh, dat thing, eh? Heh. Ya, dat's a fine thing to have.

But if you want de knowledge I have, you're gonna have to help me with someting first, little mixah.
