* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I see you've received my message.

==Completion==

Good, now we can proceed.

==Notes==
;Report to Nathanos
:{{Gossip|Baine Bloodhoof has requested that I help him with a secret task.}}

:{{Gossip|Nevermind. <Don't report Baine's request.>}}
::''Dialogue box: Hiding this information will surely draw Sylvanas' ire. Are you sure you want to keep this from Nathanos? (Accept) (Cancel)''
::''If you selected Accept:''
:::Do not waste my time, <class>.

:::Come back when you have something worth listening to.
