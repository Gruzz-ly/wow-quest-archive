'''Time to Fly''' is automatically received the first time a player visits [[Zuldazar]] with a Horde character that meets the quest's level requirement.

==Objectives==
Find [[Beast Handler Kalatak|Beast Master Kalatak]].

==Description==
[[Zandalar]] is home to many [[pterrordax]]es. One will accompany you into the skies.

Visit Beast Master Kalatak at [[Dazar'alor]] in [[Zuldazar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|50}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]

I'm glad you came. This pterrordax is unruly and yearns to see the world beyond [[Zandalar]]'s shores. I cannot train such a beast.

You take it. May it bring you good fortune in your journey.
