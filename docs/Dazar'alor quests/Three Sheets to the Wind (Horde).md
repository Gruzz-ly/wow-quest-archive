==Objectives==
Bring Biru The Drunk a drink he likes to learn his mining secrets.
* Give [[Biru The Drunk]] his favorite drink

==Description==
You want to know more about storm silver?

Fine, if you are mining from a seam and make a mistake, you can make a deadly cloud of powderized metal. Now go.

<After a moment Secott's face softens.>

I am very busy, but if you insist on not dying, you should talk to my former apprentice, Biru. He is a drunk at Spirits Be With You, but he has some knowledge.

Talk to Ximo, de Innkeeper, and buy him a drink. If he likes it, he'll talk, if not... well, I hope you have enough coin for more drinks.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Storm Silver Seam (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
<Biru rambles almost incoherently, explaining the mechanics of mining storm silver from a seam>

... and dat is how you... get de most of mining... Zzz...

<As Biru drifts to sleep amidst a pungent cloud of brandy vapors, you think of the advice he provided.

Eager to experiment with your new mining technique, you leave the sleeping troll laying where he is.>

==Notes==
*Go to [[Spirits Be With You]] and get [[Mojo'ito]] from [[Ximo the Callous]] (Inn Keeper at /way 52 85). Go over to [[Biru The Drunk]] (Laying on the bed at /way 53 84).  He will drink the Mojo'ito and give you the next part of the quest, teaching level two proficiency in mining [[Storm Silver Seam]].
