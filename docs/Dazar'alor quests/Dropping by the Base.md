==Objectives==
Speak with [[Torv Dubstomp]] in [[Thunder Totem]].

==Description==
When the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|was attacking]], I met with a member of the [[Highmountain tauren|Highmountain Tauren]] who had a knack for making and playing drums.

Torv usually keeps to himself, but he is as brilliant as he is insane.

If there is anyone who would know where we could get the raw materials for something of this magnitude, it would be him.

Head to Thunder Totem, and ask Torv Dubstomp if he can think of a suitable source of scales. Preferably something still living, so its power is still fresh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Atikka sent you? Ha! How is the old steer?!

Hmmm... scales you say.

<His eyes flick back and forth as he looks off into the distance. His expression quickly shifts from a grimace to one of delight.>

I got it!
