==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sheza Wildmane]] in [[Thunder Bluff]].

==Description==
When I heard that the [[Alliance]] [[Battle of Dazar'alor|attacked]] [[Dazar'alor]], I couldn't help but think of those lost when they attacked [[Camp Taurajo]]. No longer can I sit idly while they continue to slaughter us!

I need you to go to Thunder Bluff, find Sheza Wildmane on the [[Elder Rise]], and ask for some of her personal collection.

I won't go into detail, but she owes me a life debt, and seeing her would... bring back too many painful memories... for both of us.

Find her, tell her I sent you, and that this absolves her debt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You explain your mission and relation to [[Atikka "Ace" Moonchaser|Atikka]].>

I see. Of course I'm more than willing to help, especially since it's Atikka.

However, doing so is going to take a bit more work on your end, if you don't mind.

==Progression==
