==Objectives==
Collect 9 Mature Anchor Pods from anchor weed.
* [[Mature Anchor Pod]] (9)

==Description==
I need you to bring me a handful of mature anchor pods.

You see, dis [[Enormous Anchor Pod (Horde)|seed pod]] is massive, but it is still just a seed pod. If we dissect it and take careful notes, we can learn about de normal, smaller seed pods and easily see how de anatomy works.

I need you to bring me more of dese mature anchor pods. If my theory is correct, den we could actually have a factual record for de future.

==Progress==
I just finished with my notes from dissecting de massive seed pod. Do you have de other seed pods for comparison?

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Anchor Weed (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
I am still unsure as to how dis thing got so big, but I am willing to believe dat it is a gift from de [[Loa]].

Dat said, when I was dissecting de big pod, I noticed dat what I thought were just thick walls along de exterior of de pod were actually a separate chamber full of seeds! See? If you carefully trim and peel back de skin on de normal pod, you can harvest some extra seeds.
