==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Enforcer Malzon.jpg|Enforcer Malzon|A Rastari Enforcer responsible for stirring a riot in the Zocalo.}}
Confront Enforcer Malzon in the [[Zocalo]].
* [[Enforcer Malzon]] confronted

==Description==
This situation can be swiftly dealt with if we take out de one that incited this violence.

I heard reports of an enforcer rousing de vagrants and drudges against de [[Vendor|shopkeepers]] and [[guard]]s in de Zocalo.

One of my own would not do this without cause. See if you can determine de reason for this sudden change.

I am told her name is Malzon. I hope for her sake that she surrenders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you deal with de instigator?

==Completion==
If I understand de situation correctly, her concerns did not arise by chance. Be wary, <name>.

==Notes==
Enforcer Malzon is located in the [[North Rastari Garrison]]. In front of her are two dead [[Rastari Enforcer]]s and an [[Eye of Samara]].

;Aggro

:{{Text|say|Enforcer Malzon|Spare me! De White Widow filled my heart with lies... I see de truth now.}}
:{{Text|say|Enforcer Malzon|De Horde are not de enemy. Forgive me.}}

On returning to Talanji, the Zocalo and Zanchul are in chaos, having been under the attack of [[Mutinous Zanchuli Devout]]s.
