Being near the trashpile shows the Disturbingly Divine Presence debuff. The player has the Curse of Jani buff. You can speak with Jani:

:{{Gossip|Release me.}}
:{{Gossip|I need a new disguise.}}

You have the Sprint ability. Use it to avoid the [[Rastari Enforcer]]s and [[Eye of Yazma|Eyes of Yazma]]. If they catch you, Jani responds:
:{{Text|say|Jani|Beware of spiders, my little saurid. I may be de god of secrets, but Yazma be de mistress of spies. She loves ta keep her skittering pests within my domain, always huntin' me children.}}
:{{Text|say|Jani|Silly saurid, ya be dead again.}}

Once near Nokano, click on him.
