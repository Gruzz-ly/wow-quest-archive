==Objectives==
Speak with [[Chronicler Ash'tari]] at [[Dazar'alor]].

==Description==
Richmon, you bring me many shiny things. You helped some of those that no one else would. And ya dumb enough to keep comin' back to me trash piles.

I like ya style.

Now for da big one. Go to the steps of Dazar'alor, and find the Chronicler Ash'tari. Her chisel makes da shrines there. Tell her to build me a shrine and I will grant you my boon.

Unlike the flappy [[Pa'ku]] or running [[Gonk]], I just gonna let ya scrap your trash in my pile and I'll give ya stuff back. Anywhere my trash piles be. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34|}} (at level 120)
*1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well, I don't have any extra statues to [[Jani]] lying around. It is not as if that... thing... has ever asked for one before. How about I just clear a spot to throw trash down on our sacred shrines?

Are you sure this is not a prank?

Fine! But just know that if you want to put a proper loa's statue back up, speak to me.

==Notes==
Completing this quest will replace your prior boon for Dazar'alor, but you can speak again to Chronicler Ash'tari to change it back.

;On completion
:''Chronicler Ash'tari walks over to the loa statue and replaces it with [[Jani's Junkpile]], then returns to her post.''
