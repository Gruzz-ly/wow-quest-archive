'''The Bones of Xibala''' is an optional breadcrumb to [[Xibala]], requiring [[The King's Gambit]], although the next quests can be started at any point before.

==Objectives==
Travel to [[Xibala]] and speak with [[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher]].

==Description==
Far to the south you will find the bones of an ancient creature. This is Xibala, the progenitor, first of the [[devilsaur]]s. She was mother to [[Rezan]], mother to all that came after. The [[Zandalari]] do not live there, as it belongs to beasts now.

I have heard rumors of some of your [[Horde]] arriving in search of something among her bones.

This is ill advised. Look into it, won't you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Completion==
I've waited for such a find all my life. I will make my father proud.

==Progression==
{{Xibala Horde}}
