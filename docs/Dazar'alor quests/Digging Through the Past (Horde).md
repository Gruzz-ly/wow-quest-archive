Let's see, Examiner Alerinda has a book on ancient runes and carvings. I think Koatini has a few scrolls he brought with him from [[Ulduar]].

OH! And Chronicler Shoopa found a codex de last time he ventured out. I remember seeing de runes on it and dey look a lot like de ones in dis book.

<You hand the book over to Seshuli and she begins to read it.>

Dis is incredible. Dis earthen was able to create jewels with de light. And dose shrines he's built, I mean, he mentions building several of dem but...

<Seshuli pulls out a few maps and begins scaninng{{sic}} them.>

==Notes==
Examiner Alerinda is located within the [[Vault of Kings]] (the same room containing the [[Mythic+]] weekly chest).
:{{Gossip|I'm looking for a book you have on runes and carvings. Could I borrow it?}}
::{{Text|say|Examiner Alerinda|Oh yes, I believe it's here somewhere...}}
::''Alerinda walks over and searches a shelf.''
::{{Text|say|Examiner Alerinda|Here it is!}}
::{{Text|say|Examiner Alerinda|And here you go. Please be careful with it, it's very old.}}

Koatini is located at the [[Grand Bazaar]]. Take the flight point to [[Port of Zandalar]] and go down a floor using the nearby stairs. The quest item will cost {{cost|20}} if you have no faction reputation with the [[Kalu'ak]].
:{{Gossip|I'm looking for some scrolls you may have?}}
::I do! But, and I mean no disrespect, I speak in coin if you catch my drift?

::For the right price, they're all yours.

Chronicler Shoopa is not too far away. Staying on the same floor level, travel east until you reach the [[Little Tortolla]]. 
:{{Gossip|I was told you came across an ancient earthen codex in your recent travels. Could I please borrow it?}}
::Why yes, I did. And quite the read it is.

::However, I came across other books as well. One you may be more interested in as it contains a tale of heartbreak and adventure!

::The protagonist is this man, "[[Marcus (paladin)|Marcus]]" and it follows his tale as he woos women, and travels the world!

::It's quite a naughty read.

::{{Gossip|That does sound interesting, however I'd really just like to borrow the codex, please.}}
::{{Gossip|That does sound exciting! Tell me more.}}

:::Well it starts off with this Marcus fellow having been captured by pirates. He manages to persuade them to let him out after some time, though.

:::Along the way, the boat is attacked by none other than a kraken!

:::After a lot of fighting and some language not fit for the faint of heart, the ship is brought down and Marcus falls into the briny deep!

:::{{Gossip|Very interesting so far, but about that codex...}}
:::{{Gossip|Oh, and then what happens?}}

::::Later he wakes up on the shores of a rather large island. His wounds were wrapped in seaweed and not too far off he could the most beautiful voice humming a song.

::::When he looked up to see who it was, well, this would never happen in real life but it was a [[naga]]!

::::{{Gossip|Very interesting so far, but about that codex...}}
::::{{Gossip|That's crazy! A naga?!}}

:::::Very much so! And then the naga came over and asked how he was feeling. And do you know what he said to her?

:::::<Toopa{{sic}} pulls out the book and thumbs through the pages. He clears his throat and begins to recite from the book.>

:::::"For a moment I thought I was rescued, but staring into those eyes of yours I'm apparently still lost at sea." And then she flirts back with him!

:::::A naga and a human, conversing and cajoling each other. This is the reason why fiction is so fun to read, wouldn't you agree?

:::::{{Gossip|While I'd love to hear more, I really would like to get that codex and be on my way.}}

::::::Young shells, always in a hurry. Very well, here's the codex.

::::::If you ever want to hear the rest of the story about Marcus, you know where to find me.

Return to the [[Terrace of Crafters]] to speak with [[Chronicler Grazzul]] now that you have all the necessary reading materials.
:{{Gossip|Here are the books you asked for.}}
::{{Text|say|Chronicler Grazzul|You got dem all?! Exellent{{sic|Go check if it is really a typo in the game.}} work, <name>. Now to translate dis journal.}}
::{{Text|say|Chronicler Grazzul|OH! So DAT'S what dat rune is. Interesting...}}
::{{Text|say|Chronicler Grazzul|Yes? Yes! Dat's it! Now where are my empty books at...? Ah, here's one.}}
::{{Text|say|Chronicler Grazzul|And here you are, <name>. De translation of your journal. Quite de page-turner if you ask me.}}

The translated book will appear on the bench beside Grazzul. Retrieve the book and take it to [[Seshuli]] in the [[Hall of Glimmers]].
