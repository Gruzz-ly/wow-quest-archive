==Objectives==
Go with [[Lilian Voss]] to find [[Thomas Zelling]].
* Thomas Zelling found

==Description==
Let's move. Zelling is probably with his family now.

Either they're happily reunited and he helps us find [[Marshal M. Valentine|Valentine]]... or he just helps us find Valentine.

Let's go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,930 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (800x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
Excellent work. I was wondering why [[Kyra]] was summoned away. Lucky for Lilian it was for a worthy cause.

Our new ally is getting acclimated to his new life. We'll soon be ready to find Marshal Valentine.
