==Description==
Hey, <name>! Come here. Shh. Closer.

<Rana's voice drops to a whisper.>

I have something I want you to do for me. It may be just a touch sacreligous, but... well...

Rezan was once de [[loa]] of kings, but he has been taken to [[Atal'Dazar]], and it grieves me what has happened to him.

I want you to go dere, and bring me back a bone of his. Not even a whole bone. A splinter. I don't care how small.

Please do dis for me, and I will teach you everything I know about gathering bones while skinning.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Skinning Technique: Bone Gathering (Rank 3)

==Progress==
Did you get it?

==Completion==
<Rana begins speaking in a whisper and places the bone fragment in a small pouch of a necklace she is wearing.>

Dis means a lot to me. 

While I will never be a king, I will have de Loa of Kings watching over me for de rest of my days.

<Rana dusts off her hands as she returns to her normal volume.>

If I recall correctly, I promised to teach you everything  I know about gathering bones, yes?

<Rana begins explaining which bones can be easily removed from the socket without breaking the bones.>
