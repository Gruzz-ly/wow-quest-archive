Collect 100 Stolen Storm Silver Bars.
* [[Stolen Storm Silver Bar]] (100)

==Description==
<Name>, I just got word dat one of our ships was attacked and a large amount of [[Storm Silver Ore|storm silver]] stolen!

De sacred materials can not be replaced. Once it is blessed by de [[wavesinger]], it is buried underwater for a year. While I do not care for such nonsense, others do, and will not sail on dat ship.

From what I heard, a group of [[naga]] followed de ship to see where the metal was buried on de sea floor before killing de crew and taking her cargo.

Kill de naga, and get me dat metal!

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Storm Silver Deposit (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
[[Loa]] damn de naga!

Have you found de bars?

==Completion==
Ah!  Dis is fantastic news! I will have someone run these out to da docks right away.

I was starting to fear dat you might not make it. Not dat I care, I just did not want to have to explain myself twice.

Dat said, you have avenged my people.  In exchange, let me show you the finer points of harvesting storm silver.

<[[Secott the Goldsmith|Secott]] takes the next several minutes to explain what he knows about harvesting storm silver deposits.>
