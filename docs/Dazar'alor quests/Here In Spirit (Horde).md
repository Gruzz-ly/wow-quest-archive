==Description==
If you are up to de challenge, I have a task dat I believe is up your alley.

De spirits of dis land are screaming out in anguish. However, dey are either unwilling or unable to talk to me in their current state.

I need you to get some fresh star moss, which will help anchor and calm their spirits. Once dey are calm, we will be able to give dem de help dey need.

Do dis, and I will teach you how to harvest [[Star Moss|star moss]] more effectively.

==Progress==
De spirits are restless. Have you managed to get de fresh star moss yet?

==Completion==
You have done well. I will begin the ritual as soon as I can.

In de mean time, you are owed a lesson on how to harvest star moss.

The magic of star moss is sensitive to emotions, which is why it helps ground those dat have passed on.

When you go to harvest, clear your mind and think of those you've lost. Dat feeling of loss, reverence, and de joy dey once brought will keep de bloom from wilting.
