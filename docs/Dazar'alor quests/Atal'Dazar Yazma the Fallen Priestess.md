==Objectives==
Defeat [[Yazma]] in [[Atal'Dazar (instance)|Atal'Dazar]].
* [[Yazma (tactics)|Yazma]] slain

==Description==
[[Zul]] knows dat we cannot let de [[Dazar|first king]] rise from his grave. Dazar would be more than a figure head for Zul's dream [[troll]] [[empire]], he would be a force dat could rival de very [[loa]].

But I cannot just let Zul get away. I and mine will follow Zul, but I want you and yours to enter Atal'Dazar. Yazma is trying to buy time and keep de tombs sealed away. You will need to fight your way through to her and you will need some allies to do so. Slay her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|131|65|}}
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
And here I always thought Yazma was just rude. I never expected just how far she had fallen.

==Completion==
Yazma's betrayal was vile beyond words.

It may take us some time to find our way deeper into Atal'dazar{{sic}}. In de meantime, we have more work to do.

==Progression==
{{March of the Loa}}
