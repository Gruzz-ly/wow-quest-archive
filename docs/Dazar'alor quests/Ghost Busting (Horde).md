==Description==
I have spoken with de spirits. Most of dem were willing to bare their souls, calling for help from de living as dey are under attack from de [[Blood troll|blood trolls]] evil magic.

Dere was one, however, who seemed more angry dan most. It was furious dat we had not acted yet, dat we allowed things to get dis bad.

Go to de [[Spirits Be With You]] inn at de port north of here and put dis spirit down, and in return I will teach you everything else I know about gathering [[Star Moss|star moss]].

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Star Moss (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
I owe you my thanks, <name>. Now that the spirit has been been put to rest, I can get back to work.

You have shown, once again, dat I can rely on you. In exchange, I will tell you the best kept secret of star moss.

Dis is going to sound crazy, but engage with it. Before you pick de flowers, talk to it, sing, hum, anything. I'm not sure why, but since I started, I have noticed one or two extra flowers will bloom before my eyes!
