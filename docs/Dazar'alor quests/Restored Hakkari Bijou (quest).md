'''Restored Hakkari Bijou''' starts from the [[Restored Hakkari Bijou]], created by combining the [[Shattered Hakkari Bijou]] and the [[Fragmented Hakkari Bijou]] inside the [[Altar of the Blood God]] in [[Zul'Gurub (instance)|Zul'Gurub]].

==Objectives==
Find somebody interested in the [[:Restored Hakkari Bijou]].

==Description==
<The bijou fragments fit together with ease; drawn toward each other with minimal intervention.

It thrums gently with remnants of an ancient power. Too much to be of no consequence, yet too little to be of much use.

Someone, somewhere, would surely be interested in seeing your discovery.>

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Relics of a Fallen Empire|id=401546|Unlocks the ability to discover ancient secrets of Zul'Gurub for all characters on your account.|icon=inv_zulgurubtrinket}}

You will also receive:
*[[Gold Hakkari Bijou]]
*[[Relics of a Fallen Empire]]

==Completion==
An old [[Hakkari Bijou|Hakkari bijou]], eh? I dare not ask HOW you came into possession of it, but there is no mystery to its origin.

Should you find yourself within the walls of [[Zul'Gurub (instance)|Zul'Gurub]] again, keep an eye out for other treasures... and bring them to me.

I will be seeing you again soon.
