Retrieve the Treatise on Anchor Weed from within [[Waycrest Manor]].
* [[A Treatise on Anchor Weed]]
* [[Gorak Tul]] slain

==Description==
One of de most sacred plants on dis island is [[Anchor Weed|anchor weed]]. Legend says dat it was a gift from de [[Loa]] and it can do anything from regrow limbs to granting immortality.

If you are looking for facts as to what it can do or how to harvest it, you will need to go elsewhere. 

The spirits tell me dat dere is a book, dat contains de information you seek. Look for it deep within the Waycrest Manor.

Dey ask dat in exchange for dis knowledge, you kill whatever is causing a rift in de spirit world.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Anchor Weed (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved da book?

==Completion==
Dis thing is in terrible condition. Did it have dis much blood on it when you found it?

<Several moments pass as Jahden flips through the pages>

Hmm... It is hard to tell from dese pictures, but it looks like de seed pods open when the plant is disturbed.

However, if de first cut is at de base, dat drains a reservoir of water dat is used to open and close de pods.  So, start at the bottom, working your way up, and you should get a better harvest.
