==Objectives==
Go to [[Slough|The Slough]] and transmute [[:Barberry Shrubs]] into Shrubbery Bubbles and gather 6 of them.
* [[Shrubbery Bubble]] (6)

==Description==
Or maybe de problem is dat we don't need regular reagents. Maybe we need something dat only comes from being transmuted.

Anything's worth a shot at dis point. Here is a recipe [[Zukashi|my old partner]] left behind.

He used to go out to de Slough and change de shrubs into bubbles, ya see.

Why, you might ask? 'Cause he loved transmuting everything. Part of de reason we never saw eye to eye.

Anyways, bring me back some of dose bubbles and we'll see if we can use dem to make dis stone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've seen him using dem in lots of his projects, so there has to be some alchemical qualities to dem.

==Completion==
Dese bubbles seem...odd. But den again so is [[Zukashi]].

==Notes==
The barberry shrubs can be nestled among the regular shrubbery, with their leaf color being a darker shade of green.

==Notes==
