==Objectives==
Receive the [[Zanchuli Council]]'s blessing.
* Zanchuli blessing given
* Survive the ambush
* [[Samara]] slain

==Description==
Now that you see who I have chosen for my council, it is time to receive their blessing.

It is a symbolic demonstration of support, but I believe there is power in words as well as deeds. When they declare themselves to me, de eyes of de [[loa]] are also upon them.

I hope they like what they see, <name>. I know I do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I will not dwell now on de [[Samara|White Widow]]'s words, but I am not dismissing her criticisms out of hand. I only wish she had chosen to speak to me instead of attacking from de shadows.

We could have worked together to solve de many problems of de [[Zandalari]].
