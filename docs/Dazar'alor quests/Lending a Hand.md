==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Secott the Goldsmith|Secott's]] Rings.
*[[Secott's Old Hand]]

==Description==
If you are looking for some work, I have something you can do.

I went mining recently and a [[diemetradon]] managed to bite off my hand before I could get away from it.

I do not care about the hand, I have already regenerated dat, but I did lose a couple rings dat I made.

If you go get them back, I will show you how to harvest more [[Monelite Ore|monelite]] from a seam. Or not. I do not care, but if you were looking for a chance to finally impress me, dis could be it.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Monelite Seam (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
For de record, those rings are worth more den your life. Empirically speaking, of course.

==Completion==
<Secott places the rings on his new hand.>

Good! As a goldsmith without jewelery, I was beginning to feel naked.

Very well, your lesson is that when you are mining monelite from a seam, it behaves very differently than a normal deposit.

<Secott spends as little time as necessary explaining the different techniques of mining monelite seams.>
