[[Jakra'zet]] refused to patrol dis area. [[Yazma]]'s spies did not warn us of de evil lurking beneath our city. And [[Zul]] did not foresee [[blood magic]]s festering under our noses.

These are serious allegations, and de evidence is in your hands. Present dem to Zolani, Blade of the King. She will know best their meaning and how best to present dem to de king.

*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (100x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
Blood magic being practiced in open daylight? Dis cannot stand.

You have done well in bringing me dis information. I will present it to King Rastakhan at de first opportunity when his council is away.
