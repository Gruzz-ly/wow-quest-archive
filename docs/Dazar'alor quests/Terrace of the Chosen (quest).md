==Objectives==
Meet [[Kaza'jin the Wavebinder]] near the [[Terrace of the Chosen]].

==Description==
This betrayal has cut deep into the heart of [[Zandalar]]. Half of the [[Zanchuli Council]] and their followers have sided with [[Zul]] and his... [[G'huun|blood god]].

Lucky for us not all of Zandalar is behind this betrayal.

We need to topple Zul's cultists before they can rally too many to their cause. [[Zanchul]] is the place to start.

Go and see if you can muster any of the [[Zandalari]] still loyal to [[Rastakhan|their king]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Completion==
<Name>, glad to see you are not dead yet.

==Progression==
{{Web of Lies}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
