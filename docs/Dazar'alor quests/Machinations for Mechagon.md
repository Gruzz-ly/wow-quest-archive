==Objectives==
Ride the Greasemonkey Skysneaker to [[Zuldazar Harbor]].
* Ride the [[Greasemonkey Skysneaker]]
* Gyrocopter Ready

==Description==
So [[Mechagon]] ain't just a fairy tale? Gotta admit I'm surprised.

But, if the [[Technology|tech]] on that [[King Mechagon|king]] is any indication of what they've got out there for us to swipe, I am very, very happy to be wrong!

We can't rush into this. A good crew died today. That ain't happening again on my watch.

Meet me and [[Skaggit]] back in Zuldazar Harbor, and we'll build this expedition up right.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Feels good to be back on [[Horde]] turf.
