==Objectives==

==Description==
The [[War Resources|resources]] you gather can be used to recruit new troops for the war effort.

Return to me periodically to issue new recruitment orders for your missions.

The war effort rages on even as we speak. We have need of fresh recruits.

Good. Your new recruits will be available for missions once they have finished their training.
