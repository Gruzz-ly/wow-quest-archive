==Objectives==
Pay respects to King Rastakhan.
* Pay respects to King [[Rastakhan]]

==Description==
King Rastakhan is dead, the [[Golden Fleet|Zandalari fleet]] has been decimated, and we have lost valuable [[soldier]]s.

The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]] is on her way from [[Orgrimmar]] to assess the situation. We must figure out our next move before the [[Alliance]] strike again.

I believe protocol now would be to pay respects to the fallen king. We will determine our next move afterwards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good, you're all here. Let's begin our discussions.

King Rastakhan's body is on [[Rastakhan's Altar]]. Around it are [[Talanji|Princess Talanji]], [[Rakera|General Rakera]], [[Wardruid Loti]], [[High Prelate Rata]], and [[Hexlord Raal]]. [[Baine Bloodhoof]] and [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] are kneeling. They are surrounded by [[Zandalari Prelate (War Campaign)|Zandalari Prelates]].
