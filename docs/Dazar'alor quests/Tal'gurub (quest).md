==Objectives==
Meet [[Zul the Prophet]] in [[Tal'gurub]].
*Fly to Tal'gurub with [[Hexlord Raal]] (Optional)
*Meet Zul at Tal'gurub

==Description==
My prophet is a loyal servant, but he has his own ideas of how things must be.

I am sending him to Tal'gurub to deal with a mess of his own making. One of his pupils, a [[witch doctor]] by de name of [[Vol'jamba]], has taken de [[Gurubashi tribe|Gurubashi]] enclave as his own and has ousted my guards.

Meet Zul at Tal'gurub and ensure dis nuisance is dealt with. Do not let him get... distracted.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==

You are here to enforce de king's will. I would hate for ol' [[Rastakhan]] to become disappointed with you, especially after your performance in [[Stormwind]].
