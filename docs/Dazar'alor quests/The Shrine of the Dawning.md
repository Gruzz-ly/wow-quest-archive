==Description==
Yea, I believe there are a few here on [[Zandalar]]. You should find dem, <name>, investigate dem. See if what dis book says is true.

Dis particular shrine sounds like it might be in Nazmir. If my calculations are correct, it should be just south of [[Torga's Rest]].

Dat loa was a mighty one. It is truly sad dat it is no longer with us.

Here are de notes on dat one. And I've marked its location for you on your map. Loa be with you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Upon inspection of the shrine, you notice something... familiar.

The cut of the gems looks like a primitive or simple version of the way you've learned to cut [[rubellite]]s.>

==Notes==
Before heading out to [[Gloom Hollow]] in Nazmir, make certain that you have four [[Rubellite]] either in your inventory or bank. You will need them for the next quest.
