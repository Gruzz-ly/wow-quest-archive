==Objectives==
Speak with [[Timeweaver Delormi|Delormi]] when you're ready to leave and investigate the disturbance.

==Description==
I feel odd... weak. As though something is affecting my very existence.

Would you come with me, <name>? I may need your help. At the very least, you could be a witness to whatever happens should something dire occur.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well, this doesn't look good...

==Notes==
;Delormi
:I believe I know when and where we must investigate first. Let me know when you're ready to go.

:{{Gossip|I'm ready, Delormi.}}
