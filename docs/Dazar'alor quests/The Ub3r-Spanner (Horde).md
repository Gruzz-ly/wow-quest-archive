==Objectives==
Wait for Shuga Blastcaps to decode the schematic.
* Wait for [[Shuga Blastcaps]] to decode the schematic

==Description==
It's a shame that [[Dataguru Gryzix|Gryzix]] had to die. Those [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]] make all of us enterprising types look bad!

At least we can still decode the Ub3r-Spanner schematic. Here, hand me that schematic and his decoder and I'll get this whipped up in just a second.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: {{Abilities|Schematic: The Ub3r-Spanner|id=290863|icon=inv_misc_wrench_01}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Here you go, <name>. Go forth and unleash your creations!

==Notes==

Shuga also receives a new gossip option, but it is not necessary to use it.
:{{Gossip|I am ready to decrypt the schematic.}}

==Progression==
{{It's Scrap Work...}}
