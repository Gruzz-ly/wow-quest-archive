==Objectives==
Find and rescue the missing crew members.
* [[Captain Dawnsail]] found
* [[Captain Holgresh]]{{Coords|60|18|Nazjatar}} found
* [[Captain Jalazko]] found

==Description==
I can't believe it. Almost the entire fleet.. lost!

We need to have ships out there on missions supporting our efforts, but how am I supposed to do that now?

If we are going to recover from this, I'm going to need my top people. I know the chances are low, but I need you to get out there and try to find them. Alive if possible.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Follower: Captain]] ([[Dread-Admiral Tattersail]])

==Completion==
Well, I suppose that's better than nothing. Let's get to work.
