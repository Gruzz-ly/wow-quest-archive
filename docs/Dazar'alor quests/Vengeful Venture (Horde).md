* Find the [[Venture Company|Venture Co]]. In [[Vol'dun]]
* [[Gryzix's Decoder]]
* [[Encrypted Ub3r-Spanner Schematic]]

==Description==
<You pick up the note and deduce that the Venture Co. are the killers of [[Dataguru Gryzix]]. You search his corpse, and find that his decoder and the Ub3r-Spanner schematic have been stolen.

You need to retrieve his decoder and the schematic and bring them back to [[Shuga Blastcaps]] to have any hope of crafting the Ub3r-Spanner.

That [[Mecha-Golem|mech]] you have following you should prove itself useful.>

* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's up, <name>? Did Gryzix handle that schematic for you?

==Completion==
He's dead? Poor sap, he was a damn fine engineer.

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
;Venture Co. Letter
:< As you approach the beach, you find Dataguru Gryvix has been slain. A note has been left on his corpse. >

:{{Gossip|Read the note.}}

::To Whom It May Concern:

::I hope this serves as a good enough warning. The Ub3r-Spanner schematic is and will remain property of the [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]]

::Oh, and don't even think about looking for us in the ruins south-east of here. Because you won't find anything there but some rocks.
