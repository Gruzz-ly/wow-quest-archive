==Objectives==
Deliver [[Zolani]]'s report to [[Habutu]] at the [[Golden Throne]].

==Description==
[[Blood magic]]s practiced in de [[Dazar'alor|city]], guards missing, and our chief [[spy]], [[Yazma]], is acting suspicious. We must present dis to [[Rastakhan]], but without Yazma interfering.

Luckily, Rastakhan is a clever king, which is something his opponents often forget.

I have prepared a report in a code made by King Rastakhan and known only to myself and my brother, Habutu. Bring it to Habutu and he will see dat it gets to de king's ear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]
*50 [[War Resources]]

==Completion==
Hmm. Zolani speaks highly of your deeds. Perhaps we may not need to kill you yet.

==Notes==
;Accept
:{{text|say|Yazma|Yes, yes. So perhaps we have a teensy bit of a problem down here. It is nothing we need to bother de king with.}}
:{{text|say|Yazma|I will inform Zul. He will decide whether it is worthy of Rastakhan's attention.}}

;Upon completion on all three quests
:{{Text|say|[[Zul the Prophet]]|My king, you are in great peril. I see encroaching enemies claiming de throne for themselves.}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Dey near Warport Rastari as I speak. We should retreat to Zanchul while it is still an option.}}
:{{Text|say|[[King Rastakhan]]|[[Habutu]], [[Zolani]], take de Speaker of de Horde and ensure de Warport is safe. Today is not de final day of my reign.}}

==Progression==
{{Port of Zandalar}}
