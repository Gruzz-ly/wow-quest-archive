==Objectives==
Send [[Arcanist Valtrois]] on a [[The Shadow War (Horde)|mission]].
*"The Shadow War" mission completed

==Description==
I have begun to assemble heroes for our cause. Perhaps you already know Arcanist Valtrois? We will need to recruit more in the future, but this is a promising beginning.

Our missions will be those of subterfuge, reconnaissance, assassination, and other focused strikes against our enemies.

Let us test the mettle of this [[nightborne]], shall we?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will not deviate from my mission.

==Completion==
Yes, this will do. The shadows will be stained blue with [[Alliance]] blood.

==Progression==
{{Mission from the Warchief}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
