==Objectives==
Meet with [[Nathanos]] on [[the Banshee's Wail]].

==Description==
I'm all set here, I'm just gonna play around with the mech, I think I got a good idea how it works thanks to ya.

Nathanos "[[prince]] of all that's death and destruction" Blightcaller is gonna want you back on that boat, the Banshee's Scream or whatever it is.

He'll be happy to know we took care of business. Then again, I got no idea if he even feels happy anymore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +2000 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Completion==
Good work. We can breath a little easier knowing our major supply of [[:Azerite]] is safe.

The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]] has further plans that will require your aid. We have a promising lead on someone who can help us destroy [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] from within.

Keep up the fight against the [[Alliance]] in the meantime. We cannot afford to let down our guard.
