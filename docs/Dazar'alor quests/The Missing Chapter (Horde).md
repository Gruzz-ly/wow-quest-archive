==Objectives==
Travel to the location marked on your map and see what you can find.
* Travel to [[Dustwallow Marsh]]
* Search for Clues
* Locate the Cave and investigate
* [[Vault Guardian (Dustwallow Marsh)|Vault Guardian]] slain
* [[The Missing Chapter]]
* Take the Missing Chapter to [[Chronicler Grazzul|Grazzul]]

==Description==
<[[Seshuli]] puts down the journal and looks back up at you.>

While trying to figure out where de shrines reside, I came across an entry dat mentioned him exploring an area dat sounds very similar to Dustwallow Marsh.

It could be a long shot, given when dis earthen roamed [[Azeroth]], but maybe if you retrace his final steps, you may find something.

I'll mark his last location for you on your map.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[:Jewelhammer's Focus]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Who knows what you'll find out dere. Hopefully something...

==Completion==
Did you find anything?

<You hand the final chapter and its transcription over to Seshuli. As she reads through it, she reaches the page with the design for the lens and her eyes go wide.>

You found it, <name>! We can make a lens now and use it with de shrines.

Although, de reagents for dis design are quite... rare. Still, you've done it!

It was an honor to work with you on dis, <name>.

==Notes==
Take a portal to [[Orgrimmar]] and fly to [[Brackenwall Village]]. From there, go northeast to [[Dreadmurk Shore]] and look for a small land outcropping with a diving helmet-wearing skeleton. Read the [[Weathered Journal (Dustwallow Marsh)|Weathered Journal]].{{co|65.8|17.9|Dustwallow Marsh}}

Put on the diving helmet and make your way to the north side of the waters off of [[Alcaz Island]]. Swim down and you should see a huge underwater cave entrance. Enter it and go southeast to find the entryway to the vault. Looks like there's company...
:{{Text|yell|[[Vault Guardian (Dustwallow Marsh)|Vault Guardian]]|WHO DARES ENTER THE VAULT?!}}
:{{Text|yell|Vault Guardian|You shall not recover my master's treasure. Prepare yourself for annihilation, intruder!}}

After dispatching the guardian, loot the [[Jewelhammer's Chest]] for [[The Missing Chapter]]. Return to [[Dazar'alor]] and speak with Chronicler Grazzul.
:{{Gossip|Can you translate this, please?}}
::{{Text|say|Chronicler Grazzul|You found another chapter?! Lucky for you, I haven't returned [[Digging Through the Past (Horde)|dose books]] yet!}}
::{{Text|say|Chronicler Grazzul|I'll have this done for you quick, <name>!}}
::{{Text|say|Chronicler Grazzul|Finished! Here you go.}}

Return to [[Seshuli]] to complete the quest.
