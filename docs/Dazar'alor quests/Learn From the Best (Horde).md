==Objectives==
Drink [[Jahden Fla|Jahden]]'s potion and allow wasps to harvest your pollen.
* Pollen Harvested
* [[Jahden's Potion of Plant Shape]] (provided)

==Description==
You want to learn how these [[wasp]]s are so good at harvesting pollen, but dey will defend their territory once you set foot inside it. Dis would be a problem, but I think I have a solution.

Take dis potion and go to [[Vol'dun]], to de [[Prickly Grove]], and drink it to turn a plant.

Here's the deal: you go out and drink the potion, you'll see firsthand how the wasps do what they do. After the potion wears off, you tell me what happened.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Sea Stalk (Rank 2)]]

==Completion==
It is good dat you experience dat first hand. It sounds like dey used their wings to stir up de pollen.  With dem being so close to de flower, de pollen had no where to go but to get stuck on the wasp.

Hmm, next time you've got a [[Siren's Pollen|Swarma' Sting]], try placing your hand over most of the mouth of the flower and gently blowing into it.  That might replicate what the wasps were doing.
