==Objectives==
Collect 18 Unwaning Bones.
* [[Unwaning Bones]] (18)

==Description==
When I was sailing in, I noticed the remains of an unbelievably large beast on the nearby peninsula.

Whatever it was, it must have been strong, making it the perfect source for the bone elements of the drums.

Go to the peninsula, '[[Xibala]]' I've heard it called, and fill a bag with the bones you find.

If you come across any of those damned [[Alliance]], show them no mercy. They did this to themselves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get the bones?

Did the Alliance give you any trouble?

==Completion==
These look good.

It makes me even happier knowing this was something the Alliance was after, and that you mucked that up for them! Heh!

==Notes==
Travel from [[Dazar'alor]] to [[Xibala]] and kill any [[Dark Iron Grenadier]]s and [[Dark Iron Earthbreaker]]s you come across. You can also sometimes find a [[Box of Harvested Bones]], which will contain several bones. Be careful to avoid the PvP-flagged Alliance NPCs nearby.
