==Objectives==
Seek out [[Kronah]] at the [[Smuggler's Cove]] in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
Dere are blood scribe masters all over de place who'll teach you what you need to know. De first master I'd recommend seeking out is Kronah.

She's a bit... eccentric to say de least. One of de few [[tortollan]] who've experienced a thing or two.

She's de one who taught me de blood contract I know how to invoke!

She prefers to hang out at de Smuggler's Cove on de western coast of Drustvar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Kronah eyes you up and down warily.>

Say ahhh for me, would you lass?

<Kronah peers inside your mouth.>

Nice teeth you have there. Would fetch a fine price. But that's not really what you're here for, is it?

No, you're one of those who think they can handle the trials of the blood contracts, aren't you? Very well.

==Notes==
Speak to [[Dread-Admiral Tattersail]] at the ''[[Banshee's Wail]]'' to travel to [[Anyport]] in Drustvar, where you will find Kronah.
