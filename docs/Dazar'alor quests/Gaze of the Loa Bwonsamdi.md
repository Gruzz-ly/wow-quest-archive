==Objectives==
Complete Bwonsamdi's trial.
* Follow [[Talanji]]
* Speak to [[Bwonsamdi]]

==Description==
<[[Pa'ku]]'s levity subsides.>

Ordinarily the final trial would be given by [[Rezan]]. But the [[loa]] of [[king]]s is no more.

It seems ol' [[Rastakhan]] picked a new favorite to take his place.

<Pa'ku sneers.>

Enjoy that. Bwonsamdi waits for you in the temple.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Talanji nods to you.>

Thank you for standing beside me through all of this. Some choices were easier than others, but I am confident in all of them.
