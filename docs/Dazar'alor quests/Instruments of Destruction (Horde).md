==Objectives==
Place the Drums of Primal Might throughout [[Zandalar]] and [[Kul Tiras]].
* Drum placed at [[Timberfell Outpost]]
* Drum placed at [[Krazzlefrazz Outpost]]
* Drum placed at [[Warfang Hold]]
* Drum placed at the [[Terrace of the Devoted]]
* Drum placed at the [[Port of Zandalar]]
* Drum placed at [[Zul'jan Ruins]]
*Return to [[Atikka "Ace" Moonchaser]] in [[Zuldazar]].

==Description==
Our work is almost finished.

These drums, while powerful, are practically useless here in port.

If you want to get the most benefit from them, you'll need to spread them out. I'd suggest one for each territory here and in Kul Tiras, to help you when you are on a quest and to keep you at your strongest when you're behind enemy lines.

Look for someplace centralized in each territory to place drums.

Once you return, I'll show you how to make the mallet needed to utilize the drums.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[:Mallet of Thunderous Skins]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Remember to either hide the drums or leave them well guarded.

We don't want these to be destroyed or fall into the wrong hands.

==Completion==
I'm glad to see you back in one piece.

In hindsight, I suppose I could have shown you how to make the mallet before you left, but everything seems to have worked out well.

Now then, let me show you how to make the Mallet of Thunderous Skins...
