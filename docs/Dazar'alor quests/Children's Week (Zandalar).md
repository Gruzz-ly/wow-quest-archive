==Completion==
Who are you? My name's Azala.

My ma'da and fa'da died when I was little. I've been living here since den, with de other [[Casteless Zandalari|casteless kids]].

Since we deon't have castes, we gotta try real hard to have good lives when we're grown. If we don't got a connection to de [[loa]] or skills dat we can use in battle, we're on our own.

I'm not much of a [[fighter]], but I like de loa. Take me around Zandalar to meet de different loa so dat I can make a connection to dem!
