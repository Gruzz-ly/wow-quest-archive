==Description==
Champion. For a brief moment after the battle with [[G'huun]], the [[Ghost|spirit]] of our old [[warchief]], [[Vol'jin]], appeared in view of all in [[Zuldazar]].

I had a hundred questions to ask my old friend, but his spirit faded before I could muster my voice.

I have asked Talanji to perform her seance once more, so that I might speak with the spirit of Vol'jin.

Will you collect the [[Glaive of Vol'jin]] from its resting place at the base of the pyramid and then join us at Zanchul?

* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

* +10 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you brought the [[glaive]]?

==Completion==
[[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] has been an excellent advisor in dese trying times. It is my honor to aid him in his search for answers.

==Notes==
In the Hall of High Priests are Talanji, Baine, [[Rokhan]], [[Master Gadrin]] and [[Spiritwalker Ebonhorn]].
