==Objectives==
Speak with Dread-Admiral Tattersail.
* Speak with [[Tattersail]] to sail to [[Stormsong Valley]]

==Description==
Front and center, <name>!

As of last night, we received word that [[Rexxar]]'s force at [[Warfang Hold]] in Stormsong was surrounded by a [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] army and an attack is imminent.

As soon as you have your things packed, go speak with Dread-Admiral Tattersail and we'll get underway. There's no time to waste!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I don't know what foul sorcery those Kul Tirans used upon our [[ship]]s, but right now our men are being pushed to the shore with nowhere to evacuate!

No time to puzzle things over, we have to act now!
