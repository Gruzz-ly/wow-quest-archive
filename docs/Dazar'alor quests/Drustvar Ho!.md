==Objectives==
Speak with Eitrigg and Dread-Admiral Tattersail.
* Speak with [[Eitrigg]]
* Speak with [[Tattersail]] to sail to [[Drustvar]]

==Description==
[[:Azerite]]'s in the air, <name>. Can ya smell it?

Drustvar--way over in [[Kul Tiras]]--apparently has a real big seam o' Azerite beneath it. Azerite means profit, and profit means winning [[Fourth War|this war]] against the [[Alliance]]... which means even more profit.

We gotta get that Azerite!

Check in with Eitrigg an' Tattersail so we can get going soon. Time is money!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Here we are. Time to see what the Alliance is up to.

;Speaking with Eitrigg
:Don't let that goblin mislead you, <name>. Our assignment is to gather INTEL on the Alliance, not to simply grab as much Azerite as possible.

:Are you ready to leave?

:{{Gossip|Yes, I'm ready to go to Drustvar.}}
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|Pay no mind to Gallywix. We are headed to Drustvar to scout our enemy's positions. Profit is a secondary concern.}}
