==Description==
My own [[prelate]]s are among them that revolted against [[Talanji]]. This is an unspeakable [[Heretic|heresy]].

I will not tolerate it! 

<She gestures to the prelate before her with her spear.>

This one has wisely told me who is to blame. My second, Kaj'ra.

I would have heard her, had she used any other means to make her concerns known. Now she must be disposed of.

You will find her in de [[Terrace of the Chosen|Terrace of de Chosen]].

Death is too good for that heretic.

[[Bwonsamdi]] keep her.
