==Objectives==
Meet the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] [[Ambassador|emissary]] at [[Great Seal|The Great Seal]] in [[Dazar'alor]].
* Use the portal to [[Zuldazar]]
* Meet the [[Natal'hakata|Zandalari emissary]]

==Description==
You wish to hear how the Zandalari joined the [[Horde]]? My people have had a... difficult history with the Zandalari.

However, I believe we dealt with the Zandalari of the past. The now Queen [[Talanji]] is much different from her father.

I'm rambling, my apologies. Our tale begins after the Alliance sacked the city of Zuldazar and killed King [[Rastakhan]].

The Horde had been invited by the then Princess Talanji to witness her coronation in Zuldazar...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There you are. De ceremonies are about to begin. De princess has requested your attendance at de steps of Zanchul.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Natal'hakata
:Queen-to-be Talanji directed me to acquire you.

:{{Gossip|Where is everyone?}}

::They all have gone down to de steps of Zanchul to witness Talanji's crowning.

::This is a momentous occasion. One not seen in living memory. Commit this to memory, <name>, for de kings and queens of de Zandalari are notoriously long-lived.

After all dat we been through with de Zandalari, we know they belong in de [[Horde]].

But [[Talanji]] and her people have suffered a great deal after de sacking of Zuldazar. Dey have mourned de loss of [[Rastakhan]] and raged over de affront against deir [[loa]].

Today, dey will make Talanji deir [[queen]]. Today, dey celebrate. She has invited us to witness dis.

When she is queen, she will ally with us. I be sure of it.

Come, let's not keep de queen-to-be waiting. We go to Zuldazar.
