==Objectives==
Talk to [[Eitrigg]] to start researching an upgrade.
*Choose an upgrade to pursue

==Description==
This war will not be won with strength and might alone. Take in your surroundings while you fight and turn it into an advantage against the enemy.

I have a list of modifications for you to choose from. Any one of these might feel small on its own, but together they might just be all the advantage we need.

Let me know what you would like us to pursue.

==Progress==
What is your decision?

==Completion==
Excellent. We will see to it right away.

==Notes==
You will need 15 [[War Resources]] to chose the first tier.

==Progression==
