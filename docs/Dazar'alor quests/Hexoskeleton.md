==Objectives==
Collect an Unbroken [[Makrura]] Carapace.
* [[Unbroken Makrura Carapace]]

==Description==
I have a bet going with [[Xanjo]] over what [[leather]] is de best for armor in regards to resisting piercing and slashing attacks.

He says scales are the best, but I have something better in mind.

I feel de makrura's exoskeleton could be treated to act as a natural [[plate armor]].

Bring me de carapace of a [[bittertide]] makrura, and I will teach you how to harvest bones more effectively from creatures you're skinning.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Skinning Technique: Bone Gathering (Rank 2)

==Progress==
Do you have de carapace?

==Completion==
Nice.

These plates are very thick, and TECHNICALLY leather. My victory is almost guaranteed.

As for your lesson... makrura don't have bones.

<Rana smiles.>

Fine, fine! I will teach you something useful, too.

<Putting the carapace on the ground, Rana shows you how to feel if a bone is broken before removing it.>
