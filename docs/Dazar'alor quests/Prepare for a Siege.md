==Objectives==
Speak with [[Baine Bloodhoof]].

==Description==
It would seem we must make ready for a siege. For now, return to your [[Horde]] in [[Dazar'alor]]. Prepare for de coming conflict.

Should de forces of [[Nazmir]] surge, I will send word.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Completion==
Though [[Sylvanas Windrunner|our warchief]] may balk at further delays, I believe we are honor-bound to assist the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]]. 

This is about more than gaining an ally in wartime. The Horde was founded on the idea of aiding those facing their hour of need.

Just as [[Thrall]] once came to the defense of my people, so we must help save [[Zandalar]].
