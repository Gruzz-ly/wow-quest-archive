==Objectives==
Kill [[Bonescreamer]] and bring the 'Ancient Artifact' to [[Rana the Cutta]].
* [[Rana's 'Ancient Artifact']]

==Description==
Hey, <name>, would you be interested in getting back a personal possession?

Dere is a [[raptor]] in [[Xibala (subzone)|Xibala]] dat took an ancient and valuable artifact from my people. My attempts to negotiate with de beast have not gone well, resulting mostly in mutual screaming and biting.

Find de raptor Bonescreamer, kill it, and bring me de lost artifact.

In return, I will show you how to skin dese beasts of de land more effectively.

==Progress==
Have you slain de beast yet?

<Rana chuckles as she smiles slyly.>

==Completion==
Ah ha! Would you look at dat! I thought I would never see you again!

<Rana snuggles the small stuffed raptor happily.>

What is with dat face? I told the truth.

I lost it when I was a child, so that is practically a lifetime ago, it has tremendous sentimental value to me, and I am one of my people.

But, you did do as I had asked, so I will teach you a little something.

<Rana joyfully explains some of the more elusive techniques to harvesting leather.>
