==Objectives==
Deliver the token to the [[Olly|shady character]].
* [[Token of Shadiness#Horde]] (Provided)

==Description==
Your followers tell of a smuggler of wit and guile, who was able to charm them with stories of lands far and wide.

Though it cost a fair sum to retrieve, they managed to obtain a token which when displayed to the smuggler, will allow the bearer to purchase his wares.

==Progress==
Do you really think you should be talking to me?

==Completion==
Well alright then, looks like you check out.

Yea I got pets, they aren't easy to come by though, so don't expect me to give them away.
