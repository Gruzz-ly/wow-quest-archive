==Description==
I know my [[priest]]s, <name>. Such an uproar did not appear out of thin air.

There is much I have to atone for, but I am not yet ruler. I have not had de time to do what is needed for de faithful of [[Zandalar]]. That does not mean they deserve to suffer.

Go into de Terrace of de Chosen and find them that refuse to fight. See that they get out safely. I will hold none of them accountable for de actions of others.

You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
