==Objectives==
Search through patches of sea weed to find a memento of the lost [[sailor]].
* [[Sailor's Necklace]]

==Description==
I have a task dat I can not really trust to anyone else, and I feel you could handle it with de reverence it deserves.

An old friend came to me today, bringing a wilted sea stalk flower with her. Her husband was on a ship off the coast of [[Nazmir]]. I am unsure if de ship went down because of de [[naga]], de [[Alliance]], or a squall, but she said she did not want revenge. Only closure.

If you could go get her something to remember him by, I will tell you everything I know about sea stalks.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Sea Stalk (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
Have you had a chance to search de wreckage?

==Completion==
I can not thank you enough for dis.

Death seems to always haunt dis land, but it is somewhat lessened by de thought dat we can still hold on to de memories of those departed.

As for your lesson, de last bit of advice I can give you is simple. To help you get de most of each sea stalk, instead of cutting the stem off from de plant, carefully pull it out of de sand and tear off de roots.
