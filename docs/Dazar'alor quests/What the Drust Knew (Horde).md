==Objectives==
Carefully remove the enchantment from the Ancient Drust relic to learn about its construction.
* Speak to [[Enchantress Quinni]]
* Remove enchantment from the Ancient Drust relic

==Description==
[[Thalassian#Thalassian primer (official translations)|Bal'a dash]], <name>.

If you have a moment, I could use your assistance. I've recently received a shipment of [[Drust]] relics that were smuggled out of [[Kul Tiras]].

Most have our usual enchantments, but there is one that is unique. Just holding it makes my hair stand on end. 

With you being my best pupil, I was thinking that it would be enlightening if we disenchanted it together, to see how it was made.

What do you say?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm sorry, <name>, I didn't think that the enchantment would be so complex. I thought I could maintain the incantation.

I guess that's it. With the relic destroyed the technique behind its construction is lost.

A shame, really. It's not often that I'm left dumbfounded by another enchanter.
