==Objectives==
Meet Nathanos Blightcaller outside Barrowknoll Cemetery. 

Dread-Admiral Tattersail can bring you to Drustvar.
* Speak with [[Tattersail]] to sail to [[Drustvar]]
* Meet [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]] at [[Barrowknoll Cemetery]]

==Description==
Our next stop is in Drustvar.

There, along with some help, we shall identify and extract the body of a [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] war hero.

With his aid, we will learn much of the [[Kul Tiran fleet]]. Enough to break it with ease.

We shall meet you outside Barrowknoll Cemetery.

Do try not to waste time, would you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah <name>. You're here.

You remember [[Captain Amalia Stone|Captain Stone]], don't you? I think you shall find her quite a bit more... agreeable now.
