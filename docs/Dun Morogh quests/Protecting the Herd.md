==Objectives==
Obtain Vagash's Fang.
*[[Fang of Vagash]]

==Description==
We heard the cries in the middle of the night. Then this morning, sure enough, the herd was missing two [[ram]]s. That dastardly beast known as [[Vagash]] has been preying on our livelihood. With [[Ironforge]]'s troops already spread thin, there is no one to keep Vagash at bay.

Perhaps you are brave enough to seek out the beast and slay him. Bring me one of his fangs and I will reward you. Vagash lurks just above the ranch here, but be warned, he is deadly.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Rancher's Trousers
|Hard Leather Tunic
|Vagash Breastplate
|Ram Rescue Vest
}}

You will also receive:
*700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|20}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]
*+250 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Vagash still terrorizes the herd! &nbsp;Please help us by killing the wretched beast. 

==Completion==
Very well done! &nbsp;[[Veron Amberstill|Veron]] will be so happy when he hears the good news. &nbsp;To kill Vagash is no easy task. &nbsp;I imagine one day you'll be fighting alongside [[Magni Bronzebeard|King Magni]]'s men on the [[Alliance]] Front. 

==Old description==
We heard the cries in the middle of the night. Then this morning, sure enough, the herd was missing two rams. That dastardly beast known as [[Vagash]] has been preying on our livelihood. With most of [[Magni Bronzebeard|King Magni]]'s army off in distant lands fighting with the [[Alliance]], there is no one to keep Vagash at bay.

Perhaps you are brave enough to seek out the beast and slay him. Bring me one of his fangs and I will reward you. Vagash lurks just above the ranch here, but be warned, he is deadly. 

==Notes==
*Face the house with the quest giver in front of it. Turn 45deg to your left. There's two pine trees up the hill. Go up behind those two trees, a little to your right, then left and bang you're right in front of the cave.
