==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Carvo Blastbolt}} in [[Gnomeregan]].

== Description ==
I'm going to start preparing my men to leave this place. We can't hold out here any longer. I want you to move to a forward position in the middle of the large room ahead.

You should find Carvo Blastbolt there. He'll give you further instructions. Good luck, <name>, and I'll see you on the surface.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||2}}

== Progress ==
I'm sure I don't need to remind you to stay alert down here.

== Completion ==
Did Nevin send you ahead? That means he's getting ready to end the mission, but there are still survivors to be rescued. We have to help them!

== Notes ==
Head east out of the [[Old Dormitory]] and up the ramp to find Carvo.

==Progression==
