== Objectives ==
Kill 6 Helm's Bed Surgers at [[Helm's Bed Lake]].
* [[Helm's Bed Surger]] slain x6

== Description ==
The elements are in turmoil, <class>. The [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]] stirred up the long-dormant [[Water elemental|water spirits]] of Helm's Bed Lake, just to the south. They're angry, confused, and unwilling to hear my pleas.

I have tried everything I know to calm them, to persuade them to stop lashing out and attacking the sergeant's mountaineers.

It pains me to say this, but no other options remain -- we must kill the elementals.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|30}} (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Something has to be done. We can't leave the lake like this.

== Completion ==
It is never easy to countenance violence against the very elements whose powers I wield, but sometimes there is no other solution. Our duty to the people of [[Dun Morogh]] comes first.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Entombed in Ice]] before heading out.

==Progression==
