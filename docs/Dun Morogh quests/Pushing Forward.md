==Objectives==
Use the Rune of Fire to destroy 4 Constriction Totems in the [[Frostmane Front]].
* Constriction Totems burned x4
* [[Rune of Fire]] (provided)

==Description==
Most of the mountaineers and steam tanks in [[Dun Morogh]] are battling along the Frostmane Front, which is approaching us from the southeast. We can barely hold the trolls back, let alone advance into their village and take on their leader.

They've blocked our path of approach with mysterious totems that choke mountaineers who come in range, leaving the victims helpless against their enemies. This stone is inscribed with a rune of fire; it should be able to destroy the totems and free our mountaineers.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Camping Knife
|Sharp Axe
|Gnarled Short Staff
|Snubnose Blunderbuss
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
Was the rune able to destroy the totems? Were we too late?

==Completion==
Finally, some good news from the Frostmane Front. I'll have the mountaineers press their attack immediately. Now, we must signal our gnomish allies at [[Steelgrill's Depot|Steelgrill]] to start their advance.

==Notes==
Head southeast out of Kharanos. Mountaineers are busy fighting off Frostmane scouts and scavengers. Constriction Totems have snagged the odd mountaineer, so use the rune to free them.

Free four, then return to Tharran.
