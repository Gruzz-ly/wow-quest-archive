'''Gnomeregan's New Guardians''' is part of the [[Gnomeregan (pet battle)|Gnomeregan pet battle scenario]].

== Objectives ==
Defeat [[Pulverizer Bot Mk 6001]] in [[Gnomeregan (pet battle)|Gnomeregan]].
*Ask [[Micro Zoox]] to teleport you inside of Gnomeregan
*Pulverizer Bot Mk 6001 defeated.

== Description ==
My personally-modified Mayhem Detection Device has been giving readings off the charts for the last few days. You might be thinking that mayhem and Gnomeregan are synonymous, and to an extent they are, but these readings are beyond anything I've seen before!

I'm not totally sure what's going on inside of Gnomeregan, but something is different. If you are feeling brave enough, I can teleport you deep in there and you can see for yourself.

Let me know when you are ready.

== Rewards ==
You will learn:
*{{abilities|Manapoof Link: Gnomeregan|[[Manapoof]] can now teleport you to [[Gnomeregan]].|icon=spell arcane portalironforge|id=286079}}

You will also receive:
*[[Ultimate Battle-Training Stone]]
*{{cost|93|60}}
*35,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can teleport you in. Getting out might be more of a challenge.

== Completion ==
Someone stole a schematic from one of [[Thermaplugg]]'s inventions?  This isn't good, we've heard that a mischievous group has been collecting odd parts from the [[Wailing Critters|Wailing Caverns]] and the [[Deadmines: Pet Edition|Deadmines]] as well. What crazy thing could they be doing? Who is this group? We better start finding some answers, and soon. 

== Progression ==
#[[Trouble in Gnomeregan]]
#'''Gnomeregan's New Guardians'''
#[[Pet Battle Challenge: Gnomeregan (quest)]] (repeatable weekly)
