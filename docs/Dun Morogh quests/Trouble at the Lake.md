== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Sergeant Bahrum}} at {{NPC||Bahrum's Post}}.

== Description ==
You've been a great help in securing the mines and rescuing the trapped miners.

The [[Senate of Ironforge|Senate]] will be heartened to hear that you and {{NPC||Captain Tharran}}'s mountaineers have made progress in securing Dun Morogh.

What worries me is that I haven't seen any reports from Sergeant Bahrum and his detachment. They were sent east, along the road toward [[Helm's Bed Lake]], and ordered to set up a small outpost. Would you go to Bahrum's Post and check in on the sergeant?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}} (or {{cost|||60}} at max level)

== Completion ==
It's a good thing the Senator didn't come out here on his own. It's dangerous, and we're going to need all the help we can get to get the situation under control.

== Notes ==
Keep following the main road to the northeast. Bahrum's Post is just off the road north of Helm's Bed Lake.

==Progression==
