[[Ragnar Thunderbrew]] in [[Kharanos]] wants 4 Tender Boar Ribs and a mug of Rhapsody Malt.

==Description==
Nothing my tavern patrons enjoy more than some Beer Basted Boar Ribs! Only problem is, the local trapper who used to bring me supplies enlisted in the King's Army to help with the war on the [[Alliance]] front.

Maybe you can help me out? If you bring me some boar ribs and a Rhapsody Malt from the tavern here, I'll give you the family recipe for my famous Beer Basted Boar Ribs, not to mention a free sample! The secret's in the Malt!

==Progress==
I'm going to need those crag boar ribs and a mug of Rhapsody Malt, <name>. 

==Completion==
The Malt is brewed, the Boars are dead<br>
And before all is done and anything said<br>
We will have to fight for first dibs<br>
On these savory Beer Basted Boar Ribs!

The [[Tender Boar Ribs]] are found on the following four mobs in '''Dun Morogh''': [[Crag Boar]], [[Large Crag Boar]], [[Elder Crag Boar]], [[Scarred Crag Boar]]. These boars are found in their highest concentration in the immediate vicinity of [[Kharanos]].

Cooking skill is not required.
