==Pre-Requisites==
Must be a [[Blacksmithing|Blacksmith]] with 30 skill.

==Objectives==
Bring 6 [[Copper Axe]]s and 6 [[Copper Chain Belt]]s to [[Thorvald Deepforge|Thorvald]] in the southern [[guard tower]] of [[Loch Modan]].

* [[Copper Axe]] (6)
* [[Copper Chain Belt]] (6)

==Description==
The mountaineers of [[Loch Modan]] are fighting [[trogg]]s, and having a busy time of it! They need constant supplies of new armor and weapons if we're ever to get a handle on those troggs.

That's why my colleague Thorvald is there, trying to keep the mountaineers in good gear. So if you were to make some copper axes and copper chain belts and bring them to Thorvald, he would be obliged. He might even share his knowledge with you.

Thorvald is in Loch Modan's southern guard tower.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*90-900 [[XP]]
*[[Plans: Heavy Copper Longsword]]

==Progress==
I have no time to chat. Do you have business with me?

==Completion==
Ah, apologies! I didn't realize you were here to help resupply our troops. The stuff you made will be a big help!

Here are plans for some armor. I hope you find them useful.

==Notes==
To find the southern guard tower, follow the road south out of [[Thelsamar]]. The tower should be on the right side of the road as you head south into the mountains. Thorvald's coordinates are 24,74.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Reward changed from [[Plans: Copper Chain Vest]] to [[Plans: Heavy Copper Longsword]].}}
