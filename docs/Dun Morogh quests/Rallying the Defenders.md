==Objectives==
Plant 8 Ironforge Banners in mounds of [[Loose Snow]] throughout the Ironforge Airfield.
*Ironforge Banner's planted (8)
*[[Ironforge Banner (Dun Morogh)]] (provided)

==Description==
While our [[engineer]]s work on getting the [[bomber]]s ready to fly again, our guards and [[mountaineer]]s continue to fight the invaders.

They've been out there since the incursion began, without so much as a chance to catch some sleep or have a meal. [[Ironforge]]'s defenders are among the best on [[Azeroth]], but even they have limits.

Take these banners and plant them in banks of loose snow. Remind the men what they are fighting for and help keep their morale high.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}} (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)

==Progress==
We must do what little we can to keep the defenders' spirits high.

==Completion==
The men are finding hidden reserves of strength and courage to deal with the Dark Iron onslaught. The airfield will not fall on our watch!

==Notes==
Head south past the airfield proper to the battlefield. Plant the banner in a pile of loose snow and the friendly combatants will be buffed with "Rally Airfield Defenders: Fighting with Renewed Vigor".
