==Objectives==
Use the Teleport Beacon to teleport 6 Survivors to safety.
*[[Survivor]]s Rescued (6)
*[[Teleport Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
If we don't do something quick, neither [[Nevin Twistwrench|Nevin]] nor the survivors will make it out of here alive. I'm going to give you [[Survivor Assistance Facilitation Expedition|my squad]]'s emergency teleport beacon. We still have enough strength and ammunition to fight our way out of here, but these survivors are in no condition to make a run for it.

Use the beacon on survivors to arrange for them to be teleported out of here to the safe area my men have set up. Once you've done that, report back to me and we'll make arrangements to get you out of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||15}} (or {{cost|||60}} at max level)

==Progress==
Nevin's team found a lot of survivors this time, but he's cutting it awful close.

==Completion==
I know Nevin will be pleased with all the survivors you managed to help. I still can't believe you managed to stay so strong down here in the radiation. You've seen the shape the other survivors are in.

Let's get you to the [[Loading Room|loading room]] for decontamination.

==Notes==
Survivors are hidden behind pillars and around corners. Teleport out six, then return to Carvo up top in on the raised platform.
