That Direbrew is a piece o' work. He's been a contrarian since before [[Council of Three Hammers|we even joined]] the [[Alliance]]. I'm not surprised he's still attackin'.

All he thinks about is brew and causin' chaos! Not to say that I don' love those things too, but there are other things in life!

Thanks for takin' care o' him.
