== Objectives ==
Break open six {{NPC||Icy Tomb}}s to free the Frozen Mountaineers trapped inside at [[Helm's Bed Lake]].
*{{NPC||Frozen Mountaineer}}s freed x6

== Description ==
{{NPC||Khurgorn Singefeather||Khurgorn}} tells me the [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]] upset the balance of the elements all over the world. Helm's Bed Lake, to the south, used to be beautiful and tranquil, but it is now overrun with agitated [[water elemental]]s. When they started to leave the confines of the lake, I sent my troops in to keep them busy, but most have been frozen in blocks of ice.

If we can break them free, they have a good chance of recovering. I cannot spare the men for a second expedition out onto the lake. Would you be willing to try?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}} (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Were you able to help any of the mountaineers?

== Completion ==
You've done it! The mountaineers are returning to camp and our medics will have their hands full. We are all in your debt, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dealing with the Surge]] before heading out.
