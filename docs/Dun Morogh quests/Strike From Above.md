==Objectives==
Use the Signal Flare to call in airstrikes at the northern and southern ends of [[Frostmane Retreat]].
* Attack on Northern Frostmane Retreat
* Attack on Southern Frostmane Retreat
* [[Signal Flare]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Delber Cranktoggle|Delber]]'s technicians have been up day and night helping us prepare for this strike. Aside from building and tuning the personnel launcher, his men have prepared the [[Gnomeregan Covert Ops|covert operations]] air wing for a strike on Frostmane Retreat. They'll be waiting for a signal to begin their strikes.

Take this flare with you, and set it off near the cluster of buildings at the northern end of the village, and the buildings at the southern end of the village. The [[Covert Ops Flying Machine|flying machines]] will make a quick strike at each site.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||2|25}} (or {{cost||4|20}} at max level)

==Progress==

Did you signal the air wing to take out the troll buildings?

==Completion==
Both you and the air wing performed admirably. There's no way that the Frostmanes will remain here now. All that remains is to begin mopping up the survivors.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eliminate the Resistance]] and [[The View from Down Here]] before heading out.

Stand in front of the two buildings at either end of the main camp.
