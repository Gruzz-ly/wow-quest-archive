==Objectives==
Bring Gremlock's List to [[Brolan Galebeard]] in [[Kharanos]].
*[[Gremlock's List]] (provided)

==Description==
I see a lot of young [[Dwarf|dwarves]] at my door, eager to learn the trade of [[cooking]]. And if there's one thing a cook needs more than anything, it's a cleaver!

I have a list of students who scored high in their lessons and earned an honorary cleaver. Take my list to [[Golnir Bouldertoe]] in [[Ironforge]]. He'll get the cleavers ready.

The fastest way to Ironforge is on a [[gryphon]], so bring the list to our [[gryphon master]], [[Brolan Galebeard]], and speak with him about transport to Ironforge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*475 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]
*+25 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Have you had your fill of Kharanos so soon?  Are you ready to leave for another city?

==Completion==
You have to get this to Ironforge, eh?  For a small fee I can put you on the back of one of my gryphons, and it'll take you there.  How does that sound?

==Notes==
This quest may not be available to you if you have completed a similar quest in another race's starting area.
