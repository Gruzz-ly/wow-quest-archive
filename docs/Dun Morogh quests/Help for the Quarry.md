== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Foreman Stonebrow}} at the [[Gol'Bolar Quarry]].

== Description ==
Thank you again for all your help here, <name>.

I have a cousin who used to work in the mines beneath the Gol'Bolar Quarry, but he hasn't been able to work since [[trogg]]s flooded into the mines and took control. The quarry and its camp are just to the southeast of the [[Amberstill Ranch|ranch]]. Would you be willing to check in with the foreman there and see if there's anything to be done?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||30}} (or {{cost|||60}} at max level)

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Sergeant Flinthammer}}? I'm not familiar with the name, but, aye, there is a Flinthammer among the miners. He's one of the ones lucky enough to make it out of the mine, but most of my men are still trapped down there.

== Notes ==
Keep following the main road to the southeast. The quarry is south of the road. Don't forget the flight path!

==Progression==
