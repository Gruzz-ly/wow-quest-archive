== Objectives ==
Relay [[Captain Tharran]]'s orders to [[Mountaineer Dunstan]], [[Mountaineer Lewin]], and [[Mountaineer Valgrum]] in the [[Grizzled Den]].

* Convey orders to Mountaineer Dunstan
* Convey orders to Mountainer Lewin
* Convey orders to Mountainer Valgrum

== Description ==
The [[cataclysm]] drove the [[trogg]]s to the surface in hordes, forcing the [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmane trolls]] to flee for their lives. Unfortunately, they've decided to settle right on our doorstep and make trouble for us.

I deployed Mountaineer Dunstan and his squad to the Grizzled Den just southwest of town to keep an eye on the [[wendigo]]s that live there, but now I need to recall them to [[Kharanos]]. Find them and tell them to deploy those remote observation bots the [[gnome]]s provided, then return to Kharanos. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}} (or {{cost||3|90}} at max level)
You will also gain +250 [[reputation]] with both [[Ironforge]] and [[Gnomeregan]].

== Progress ==
Did you find Mountaineer Dunstan and the rest of his squad?

== Completion ==
Thank you for your help, <name>.  Our forces are deployed thinly these days and three mountaineers could be the difference between defending Kharanos and being overrun.

== Notes ==
The three mountaineers are all inside the [[Grizzled Den]].  The remote observation bots all appear to be of the standard [[Alarm-o-bot|Alarm-o-Bot]] design, at least in appearance.

Dialog: ''"Captain Tharran wants you to deploy your remote observation bots and withdraw to Kharanos."''

Mountaineer Dunstan:
* {{text|say|Mountaineer Dunstan|Tell Captain Tharran that I'll be back in Kharanos as soon as I've verified that the bot is working correctly.}}

Mountaineer Lewin:
* {{text|say|Mountaineer Lewin|I can't wait to get out there and help in the fight against those trolls.}}

Mountaineer Valgrum:
* {{text|say|Mountaineer Valgrum|We've been fighting nonstop since the cataclysm.  It'll be nice to get a rest, if a brief one.}}

Oddly, this quest re-uses the database ID of a pre-cataclysm quest ([[The Grizzled Den (quest)]]), which few other quests do.

== Trivia ==
Interestingly, in an earlier quests [[Whitebeard Needs Ye]] it is conveyed that [[troll]]s are far more powerful than [[troggs]] ("Troggs may be a pain, but trolls are a whole other type of trouble."). But this quest suggests that troggs forced trolls "to flee for their lives".
