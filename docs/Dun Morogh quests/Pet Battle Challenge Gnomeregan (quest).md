'''Pet Battle Challenge: Gnomeregan''' is the weekly repeatable quest for the [[Gnomeregan (pet battle)|Gnomeregan pet battle scenario]]. This quest is the only source for {{item|Pristine Gizmo|icon=}}s, which are used to buy [[battle pet]]s and battle pet-related items from [[Micro Zoox]].

== Objectives ==
Defeat [[Pulverizer Bot Mk 6001]] in [[Gnomeregan (pet battle)|Gnomeregan]].
*Ask [[Micro Zoox]] to teleport you inside of Gnomeregan
*Pulverizer Bot Mk 6001 defeated.

== Description ==
Gnomeregan's at Mayhem Level Maximum again. Those machines just don't give up, and keep coming back.

I can teleport us in there again, but all of those crazy robots are back. You sure you want this? I don't. I mean, maybe I want to watch robots smash things for some entertainment. I'm sure you will be fine. Lets go! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Pristine Gizmo]]
*{{cost|23|40}}
*17,850 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
I can teleport you in. Getting out might be more of a challenge.

== Completion ==
Someone stole a schematic from one of [[Thermaplugg]]'s inventions?  This isn't good, we've heard that a mischievous group has been collecting odd parts from the [[Wailing Critters|Wailing Caverns]] and the [[Deadmines: Pet Edition|Deadmines]] as well. What crazy thing could they be doing? Who is this group? We better start finding some answers, and soon. 

== Progression ==
#[[Trouble in Gnomeregan]]
#[[Gnomeregan's New Guardians]]
#'''Pet Battle Challenge: Gnomeregan'''
