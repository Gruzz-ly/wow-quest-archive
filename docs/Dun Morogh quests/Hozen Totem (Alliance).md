==Objectives==
Talk to [[Arcti]] in the [[Brewfest Grounds (Dun Morogh)|Brewfest grounds]].

==Description==
<The [[hozen]] have been successfully chased away, and [[Brewfest]] saved once again.

The question asks itself, though: How did hozen get to [[Dun Morogh]]? Perhaps you should ask somebody who has experience in navigation and travel.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Brewfest Prize Token]]

==Completion==
Just because I arrived to Azeroth on a [[Exodar|ship]] that flew through the stars doesn't mean that I know how... navigation works. 

I've never ever seen a hozen, ket alone one with wings!

Perhaps they held hands as they flew through the sky? Your guess is as good as mine.
