==Objectives==
Kill 5 Frostmane Seers and 7 Frostmane Snowstriders on [[Shimmer Ridge]].
*[[Frostmane Seer]] slain x5
*[[Frostmane Snowstrider]] slain x7

==Description==
The [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]] has thrown the balance of power of [[Dun Morogh]] into question, <name>. Without warning, a wave of [[trogg]]s emerged from the caves near [[Gnomeregan]] and overran the [[Frostmane troll]]s. The trolls have been migrating east ever since.

There has always been a Frostmane presence up on Shimmer Ridge, to the northwest, but with the migration, the trolls now surround us. We can't allow the trolls to use this position to their advantage. While my men hold the line in the east, strike against Shimmer Ridge.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}} (or {{cost||3|30}} at max level)
and [[Stone Buckler]]

==Progress==
How is the situation on Shimmer Ridge?

==Completion==
We should be able to focus our efforts on the rest of the trolls to the east, but there's still the matter of the [[wendigo]]s in the [[Grizzled Den]].

==Notes==
Tharran, Glynna and the Covert Operative are holding a war conference:
:{{text|say|Tharran|We're getting bogged down in the fight against the Frostmane trolls.}}
:{{text|say|Tharran|Most of our steam tanks are out of commission and we're losing mountaineers quickly.}}
:{{text|say|Glynna|It won't be long before we're out of supplies too, Captain. Between the trolls and the yeti raids, we'll be down to half rations within a week.}}
:{{text|say|Tharran|We can't keep up the operation much longer. Delber and his team must launch their attack from Steelgrill's Depot as soon as possible!}}
:{{text|say|Covert Operative|Delber and his men are working overtime, captain. He has devised a means of delivering an assault team to the rear flank of the battle.}}
:{{text|say|Covert Operative|We've also secured air support for the operation and will be ready to deploy soon. If any of your men want to join the assault team, just send them to Delber.}}
:{{text|say|Tharran|Glad to hear it. I'll send Delber any forces I can spare.}}

Head northwest along the road to Gnomeregan, but turn north before reaching the gate, heading along the base of the ridge to find the path up. Take out the required numbers then return to [[Kharanos]].
