== Objectives ==
Take Stonebreaker's Report to {{NPC||Moira Thaurissan}} in [[Ironforge]]'s [[High Seat]].
* [[Stonebreaker's Report]] (provided)

== Description ==
So just how did all those [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] warriors end up here, on the doorstep of Ironforge, on the verge of invading our city?

Does not 'Empress' Moira, a member of our esteemed [[Council of Three Hammers]], rule the Dark Iron? This cannot have happened without her knowledge and consent. This was no ragtag band of rebel dwarves, but a well-organized and fully equipped invasion force.

I have prepared a report on the battle for the airfield. Take it to Ironforge, to the High Seat and confront her!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Progress ==
What is the meaning of this intrusion?

== Completion ==
And just what is this?

<Moira takes the report and the color drains from her face as she reads.>

This is impossible!

== Notes ==
Take {{NPC||Rixa's Flying Machine}} back to [[Gol'Bolar Quarry]], run south a few yards to {{NPC||Dominic Galebeard}}, the Gryphon Master, and hop on a gryphon at Gol'Bolar to Ironforge. Run southwest around the [[Great Forge]] to the High Seat, where the council is in session.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|How dare you storm into my throne room and attempt to spread this conspiratorial nonsense!}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I will not let you and this treasonous {{NPC||Commander Stonebreaker}} steal my son's birthright!}}
:{{text|say|Muradin Bronzebeard|That is quite an accusation, Moira. It's hardly your throne room in the first place.}}
:{{text|say|Muradin Bronzebeard|I know Commander Stonebreaker and I will vouch for his loyalty and his honesty. We must take his word.}}
:{{text|say|Muradin Bronzebeard|What cause do the Dark Irons have for taking up arms against Ironforge? Are you unable to control your own people, Moira?}}
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Muradin has a point. If you cannot govern your own people, you have no place at this table.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Both of you know I would never order such a thing! Why would I set one half of my son's inheritance against the other?}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|No, this is the work of a traitor to both our peoples. Despite my best efforts, some Dark Irons remain in the grip of [[Twilight's Hammer]].}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|The cult must have someone in the city to coordinate this kind of attack. That only leaves one suspect, {{NPC||Ambassador Slaghammer}}!}}
