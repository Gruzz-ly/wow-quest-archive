== Objectives ==
Board {{NPC||Mathel's Flying Machine}} at the [[Gol'Bolar Quarry]].

== Description ==
According to the plans you captured, the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] are planning a large-scale attack on the [[Ironforge Airfield]]! The council has moved most of our forces down into [[Dun Morogh]] to deal with the instability brought by the [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]], leaving our defenses weakened at the airfield.

We need a way to get you to the airfield quickly. Take the road back west toward Gol'Bolar Quarry and find {{NPC||Mathel Rustwrench}}. He should have a [[flying machine]] you can use. Go!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||85}} at max level

== Completion ==
Thank goodness you're here, <name>. The airfield's been attacked by the Dark Irons and I don't think we can hold out much longer.

== Notes ==
Back to the west. Ignore the quest arrow on the minimap for now, as the airfield is not accessible by foot. It is accessible by flying machine, however. Mathel Rustwrench and his flying machine are at {{co|75.2|52.8|Dun Morogh}} on the northern end of the quarry. Hop on the flying machine to take a trip up to the airfield!

The Dark Irons are raiding! Speak to {{NPC||Commander Stonebreaker}} to the southeast.
