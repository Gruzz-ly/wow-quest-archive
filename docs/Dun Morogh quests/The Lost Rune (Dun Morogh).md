==Description==
The [[warrior]]s of the [[Alliance]] have much to teach you, <name>, but you must also seek out new techniques on your own.

There is a cave full of Frostmane trolls south of here. Another fledgling warrior ventured inside some time ago, but never returned. He was experimenting with engraving mystical runes onto his equipment to improve his combat prowess.

Find the rune among the trolls, one of them is likely carrying it, and learn this technique yourself. Return to me when you have done so.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*{{Race|Dwarf|notext}}+50 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
*{{Race|Gnome|notext}}+50 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles]]
*[[Tarnished Chain Gloves]]

==Progress==
Did you find the rune, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout [[Azeroth]]. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.
