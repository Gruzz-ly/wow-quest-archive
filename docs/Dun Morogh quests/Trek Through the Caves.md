==Objectives==
Recover the stolen rune from the cave of [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmane]] [[Ice troll|trolls]] in [[Coldridge Valley]]. Use the rune to learn a new ability, then report back to [[Thorgas Grimson]] in [[Anvilmar]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Chimera Shot (hunter rune)]]

==Description==
[[Hunter]]s are a hardy lot, <name>, even among [[Dwarf|Dwarves]]. We set out across [[Azeroth]] to explore lands unknown, and hunt all sort of dangerous and exotic quarry. Many times on your journey, you will find yourself alone in hostile territory, surviving only by your wits.

The Frostmane trolls have stolen a rune of great power from us. They have likely stashed it away in their cave to the south. Recover the rune, and use it to learn a new combat technique. Return to me once you have done so.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
*[[Cracked Leather Gloves]]

==Progress==
Have you found the rune, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout Azeroth. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Frostmane Hovel]] cave at {{Co|26.66|79.40|Dun Morogh (Classic)}} and find the [[Frostmane Loot Cache]] at {{Co|30.81|80.14|Dun Morogh (Classic)}} in the back near [[Grik'nir the Cold]] and loot it for [[Rune of the Chimera]] which learns the spell.
