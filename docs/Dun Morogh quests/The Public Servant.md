==Objectives==
Distribute Runes of Return to 7 Trapped Miners in the [[Gol'Bolar Quarry]] Mine.
*[[Trapped Miner]]s rescued (7)
*[[Runes of Return]] (provided)

==Description==
As a member of the [[Senate of Ironforge|Senate]] and the [[Explorers' League]], I've taken it upon myself to investigate conditions at the quarry. The troggs have run wild!

They've made a mess of the Gol'Bolar quarry. As we dug deep into the earth, they poured out, destroying our equipment and trapping many of the miners below ground.

We have to get them out of there. I've had mages working overtime to enchant these runes of return. If you can get them to the trapped miners, they can return to the surface in safety.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gol'Bolar Miner's Belt
|Senator's Dignified Pants
|Stonehallow's Arm Bands
|Senator's Handsome Leggings
|Stonehallow's Pressed Cuffs
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||3|50}} (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)
*840 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
*+250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
We have to get the miners to safety before the troggs grow tired of toying with them.

==Completion==
What a relief! I'm glad to see that you were able to save so many miners, <name>. I will make sure that their families are notified immediately.

The Senate will know of your role in winning back the mines.

==Notes==
