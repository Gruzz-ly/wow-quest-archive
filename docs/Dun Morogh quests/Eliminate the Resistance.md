== Objectives ==
Slay Battok the Berserker and 5 Frostmane Warriors in Frostmane Retreat.
* [[Battok the Berserker]] slain
* [[Frostmane Warrior]] slain x5

== Description ==
The Frostmane chieftain died in the initial trogg onslaught, but they've been led by a well-respected warrior ever since. Battok the Berserker was the one who organized the Frostmane retreat, the construction of the new village, and the strikes against [[Kharanos]] and the mountaineers.

If we remove Battok, the Frostmanes' organization should crumble, leaving the mountaineers free to pick off the survivors. Battok will be in the village, just east of here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Frostmane Belt

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

== Progress ==
Did you find and kill Battok the Berserker?

== Completion ==
Excellent job, <name>. With Battok dead, I'll send the signal to {{NPC||Captain Tharran}}. This should be the end of the Frostmane threat.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Strike From Above]] and [[The View from Down Here]] before heading out.

Battok can be found at {{co|63.8|55.7|Dun Morogh}} dancing in the middle of the retreat.
