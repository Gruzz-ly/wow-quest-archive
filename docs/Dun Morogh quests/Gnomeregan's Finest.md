Speak up, soldier!

Time to give you all your briefing.

==Notes==
The members of G.E.A.R. are located throughout New Tinkertown. [[Emaedi Autoblast]] is in a tall building at {{Coords|38|38.8|New Tinkertown}}. Take the elevator up to find her sitting on a bed with a rifle in hand.
:So you're the one everygnome around here has been talking about.
:<Emaedi extends her hand.>
:Emaedi. Emaedi Autoblast. Sharpshooter and scout for the [[7th Legion]]. If you need anything related to explosions, I'm your gnome. I'd linke to think I'm a pretty good shot, too.
:{{Gossip|<Introduce yourself.>}}
::{{Text|say|Emaedi Autoblast|Excited to be working with you, Commander.}}
::''Emaedi jumps off the bed, salutes, and despawns.''

[[Fizzi Tinkerbow]] is standing under a tent{{Coords|38|34|New Tinkertown}} with a paintbrush in hand next to her [[mechanostrider]], [[G.H.O.S.T.]].
:Isn't he beautiful? I've been working on various modifications to [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]]'s newest mechanostrider plans in hopes of making them even more useful. So far, I've been able to reduce shock damage of long distance jumps to the accelerator by twenty percent and set the headlight's luminosity control to automatically respond to the current light. Right now I'm testing out a new coat of paint pigments that provide better insulation...
:<The gnome continues on for a few minutes.>
:Oh, sorry. I'm Master Tinker Fizzi! I was one of Mekkatorque's many assistants. It's an incredible honor to be chosen for this opportunity.
:{{Gossip|Report, Tinker!}}
::{{Text|say|Fizzi Tinkerbow|I've really been looking forward to this. I can't wait to get started!}}
::''Fizzi salutes. She and G.H.O.S.T. walk off in the direction of Captain Sparknozzle.''

[[Herk Winklespring|Cog Captain Winklespring]] is standing outside a smaller building at {{Coords|40.2|37.8|New Tinkertown}}.
:There you are, Commander.
:Herk Winklespring reporting for duty! I was a captain in Mekkatorque's personal squadron, serving directly under the [[High Tinker]] himself.
:It's an honor to work with you, commander.{{Sic}}
:{{Gossip|<Introduce yourself.>}}
::{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|You can count on me, Commander.}}
::''Winklespring salutes and walks off toward Captain Sparknozzle.''

Once all the gnomes have been talked to, head back to Sparknozzle's platform to find the G.E.A.R. members lined up behind the captain.
