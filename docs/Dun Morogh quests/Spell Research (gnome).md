==Objectives==
Find the stolen spell notes at the trogg camp to the southwest of Anvilmar, then use them to learn a new ability. Afterwards, return to Marryk Nurribit in Anvilmar.
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Ice Lance (mage rune)]]
*[[Comprehension Primer]] (provided)

==Description==
As a mage, researching the arcane will lead you to astonishing power. Studying notes left by Azeroth's greatest mages is an excellent place to start. I had recently discovered some myself, but they were stolen by those pesky troggs to the southwest.

Recover the spell notes from the troggs' camp and use this primer to make sense of them. Return when your research is successful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles (faction)|Gnomeregan Exiles]]
*[[Tattered Cloth Gloves]]
*[[Comprehension Charm]] x3

==Progress==
How is your research progressing, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Take these Comprehension Charms. They will help you decipher any more arcane writings you find.

Continue to seek out spell notes across Azeroth and use them to further your research. If you need more charms, pay a visit to a reagent vendor.
