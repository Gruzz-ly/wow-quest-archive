==Description==
For just a few coins, one of my gryphons will take you to Ironforge. From there, deliver Gremlock's list to Golnir Bouldertoe. You'll find him in the [[Deep Mountain Mining Guild]]. That's in the [[Great Forge]] District of Ironforge, which is right where my gryphon will drop you off!

Speak to me again when you're ready for the journey.

You will receive:
*{{cost|||85}}
*475 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
*+75 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
What can I do for you, <sir/my lady>?

==Completion==
Ah, the latest list of Gremlock's best pupils.  I have a batch of honorary cleavers ready to go.  I just need to engrave the names of the students...
