==Objectives==
Use the [[Ultrasafe Personnel Launcher]] to deploy to [[Frostmane Retreat]].

==Description==
The [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]] has brought our enemies closer to home, so the chief of [[Gnomeregan Covert Operations|Gnomeregan covert operations]] asked me to build a device to dispatch personnel quickly and quietly to any corner of Dun Morogh.

Behold, the ultrasafe personnel launcher!

With a jolt of electricity and the benefit of a VLD parachute system, uh, that's 'very late deployment' for you laymen, this baby'll get you to the front in no time. Just hop aboard and prepare for flight! [[Slamp Wobblecog]] will be waiting for you in the drop zone.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}} (or {{cost||3|30}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did you survive the deployment?

==Completion==
Don't worry, the feeling of being zapped won't stay with you for more than a few minutes. All in all, it's not a bad way to get where you're going. That parachute system needs some work, though. Very late deployment, indeed. Sometimes, too late. Anyway, we have a mission to carry out.

==Notes and trivia==
*Step over to the device in the middle of the depot and interact with one of the personnel launchers, giant sparks of electricity. The player is launched a few miles up and to the southeast in the direction of Frostmane Retreat. Moments before landing, the parachute finally kicks in and safely drops players on the ground.
*There is a dead gnome on the ground in the landing zone, presumably a victim of the Very Late Deployment parachute system. And if a player wait long enough, they can witness gnome covert operatives falling to their death.
