==Objectives==
[[File:Firefighting Gear.jpg|thumb|A gnome priest, modeling the Firefighting Gear.]]
Using the Firefighting Equipment, extinguish 6 fires at the [[Ironforge Airfield]].
* Fires extinguished (6)
*[[Firefighting Gear]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] attack took us by surprise. Their saboteurs managed to damage most of our aircraft, [[steam tank]]s, and supplies. We were only able to get a few of our [[bomber]]s airborne.

Every technician, recruit, and guard I can spare is scrambling to get the others repaired and flight-ready. Our infantry can only hold out for so long. Take this equipment and help extinguish the burning bombers.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}} (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)

==Progress==
We need to hurry and get those bombers airborne!

==Completion==
Well done! My men are working hard on getting our flying machines and steam tanks back into the fight.

==Notes==
Anything on fire counts. It doesn't have to be a bomber.
