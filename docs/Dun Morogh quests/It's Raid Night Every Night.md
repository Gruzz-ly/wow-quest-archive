==Objectives==
Help {{NPC||Sergeant Flinthammer}} and his mountaineers defend [[Amberstill Ranch]] from {{NPC||Frostmane Raider}}s.
* Defend Amberstill Ranch

==Description==
The reports I'm sending Captain Tharran can't really convey the amount of trouble the Frostmanes have created for us. Your assault on the village has started to relieve some of the pressure. The raids are still frequent, but the trolls don't have the numbers they once did.

Even so, my men are tired and their morale is flagging. Would you help us keep watch for the Frostmane raiders? They could turn up at any time.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Robes of Endless Raiding
|Boots of the Weary Raider
|Bracer of the Nightly Raid
|Well-Worn Raider Treads
}}

You will also receive: {{cost||3}} (or {{cost||4|80}} at max level)

== Progress ==
We're glad to have your help, <name>.

== Completion ==
With your help, we've managed to weaken the raiders considerably. They haven't suffered such losses since the raids began. Now is the time to press our advantage.

== Notes ==
On accept, a script event starts:
:{{text|say|Sergeant Flinthammer|The Frostmane trolls have been raiding the ranch continuously.}}
:{{text|say|[[Amberstill Mountaineer]]|Does anyone hear something strange?}}
:''The trolls stealth past the guards and into the [[stables]].''
:{{text|say|Sergeant Flinthammer|As it is, there are barely enough of us to keep them from taking everything.}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Flinthammer|They just take the rams and go. The herd can't take any more.}}
:{{text|say|Amberstill Mountaineer|There it is again! I know I heard something!}}
:{{text|yell|Sergeant Flinthammer|One of the mountaineers has seen something. Keep your eyes open!}}
:''The five raiders mount up and run out of the stable.''
:{{text|yell|Amberstill Mountaineer|Frostmane raiders! Sound the alarm!}}
:{{text|yell|Amberstill Mountaineer|To arms, mountaineers! Take back those rams!}}
:''The trolls stop, form a line, and taunt the mountaineers.''
:{{text|yell|Frostmaine Raider|If you want your rams back, come get them, cowards!}}
The raiders are now attackable, so help the mountaineers finish them off. When the fourth raider dies, the last breaks for it, making his way to safety.
