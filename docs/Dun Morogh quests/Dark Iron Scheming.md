== Objectives ==
Kill 5 Dark Iron Spies and capture the Dark Iron Attack Plans from {{NPC||Captain Beld}} at [[Ironband's Compound]].
* [[Dark Iron Spy]] slain (5)
* [[Dark Iron Attack Plans]]

== Description ==
A cadre of [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] spies have taken over Ironband's Compound to the south, beyond [[Helm's Bed Lake]]. The mountaineers are normally able to keep them from getting into [[Dun Morogh]], but everything is in disarray right now.

The Dark Iron dwarves would be fools if they didn't take advantage of the chaos. We have to find out what they're planning and stop them before they do any damage.

Will you see if you can discover what they're doing down at Ironband's Compound?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Belt of Dark Schemes
|Dark Iron Infiltrator's Bracer
|Dark Iron Hobplate Boots
|Dark Iron Spy-Bands
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

== Progress ==
What are the Dark Irons up to?

== Completion ==
I knew they weren't here to see the sights.

<The sergeant examines the plans you captured, his eyes wide.>

This is more serious than we thought! This is no mere raid. The Dark Irons intend to cripple the defense of [[Ironforge]] itself!

== Notes ==
Due south of the lake is Ironband's Compound. Go spy-killing. Captain Beld can be found inside the building at the compound's southern end, at {{co|85.2|60.6|Dun Morogh}} on the lower floor.
