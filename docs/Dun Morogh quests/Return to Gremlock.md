==Objectives==
Buy a gryphon to [[Kharanos]] from the [[Flight master|gryphon master]] [[Gryth Thurden]], then bring the Honorary Cleavers to [[Gremlock Pilsnor]] in [[Kharanos]]. 
*[[Honorary Cleavers]] (provided)

==Description==
For a small fee you can buy a gryphon ride to Kharanos... as long as you've already been there. Gryphons will only fly you to places you've already been, so be sure to speak with every gryphon master you see so you can fly to him later.

You've already been to [[Brolan Galebeard|Brolan]], the gryphon master of Kharanos, so now you can return to him. And once in [[Thelsamar]], you can deliver the picks to Gremlock Pilsnor.
Speak with me when you're ready to go. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*625 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|90}} at level 85)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]
*+350 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Ah, <name>.  Have you returned from Ironforge? 

==Completion==
You brought the cleaver. &nbsp;Great! &nbsp;I'll get these to my students. &nbsp;I'm sure they're eager to use them on some fresh boar meat.

Thank you for your help, &lt;name&gt;. &nbsp;I am in your debt, but I hope this money will at least cover your travel costs.
