==Objectives==
Bring 7 Shimmerweeds to [[Rejold Barleybrew]] in the [[Brewnall Village]]. 
*[[Shimmerweed]] (7)

==Description==
I'm on a quest to make the perfect stout.  I know I can do it -- brewing's in my blood.  I just need to find the right recipe...

The [[Frostmane troll]]s grow a plant, shimmerweed, up on [[Shimmer Ridge]] to the northwest.  They use it in their strange, tribal rituals.  We haven't found much use for it, but it has a unique taste... and I want to experiment with it in my brews!

Obtaining the shimmerweed will be dangerous, but I'll pay well for any you can "borrow" from the baskets in the troll village.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ivy-Weave Bracers
|Shimmerweed Boots
|Herb-Stained Gauntlets
|Shimmerweed Brewer Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
Do you have that shimmerweed?  I almost have a batch of stout ready to brew, and I want to try throwing the weed in with this mixture.

==Completion==
Great! &nbsp;I can't wait to use these in some of my recipes.  There's one in particular I think it'll work great in...
