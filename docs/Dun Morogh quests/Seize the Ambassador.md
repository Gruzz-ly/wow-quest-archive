==Objectives==
Go to the [[Dark Iron Embassy]] and use the Sturdy Manacles to arrest Ambassador Slaghammer.
* Arrest [[Ambassador Slaghammer]] and bring him to the [[High Seat]]
*[[Sturdy Manacles]] (provided)

==Description==
The ambassador's betrayal will long haunt me. You must arrest him before he can do further harm, or worse, before he can escape and start planning the next attack. Ironforge is not safe with Ambassador Slaghammer free inside the city.

Take these manacles and go to the Dark Iron embassy. It's just to the north of the High Seat, around the rim of the Great Forge. Arrest Ambassador Slaghammer and return with him.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|The Slaghammer
|Battleaxe of the Sober Dwarf
|Ambassador's Duplicitous Dagger
|Ambassador's Deceitful Dagger
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
We must stop the ambassador before he causes more harm.

==Completion==
The ambassador will trouble us no more. He is not the only Dark Iron dwarf whose heart still belongs to Twilight's Hammer. We must remember that and remain vigilant against their schemes, else my son will inherit only ruins and ashes.

==Notes==
The Blizzard quest tracker is wrong. Exit the high seat and turn north, then immediately west. Just to the right of the tunnel to the commons is the Dark Iron Embassy. Slaghammer is at {{co|36.6|43.2|Ironforge}} on the second floor.

Use the manacles on him:
:{{text|say|Ambassador Slaghammer|I go willingly, <class>. My purpose in the master's plan is fulfilled.}}

Run past the two guards in front of the door to the High Seat:
:{{text|say|Left Guard|Glad to see that Dark Iron scum is finally getting what he deserves!}}
:{{text|say|Right Guard|Quiet! Moira's in a foul mood and if she hears you, she'll have your head...}}

Enter the High Seat and Slaghammer will walk to the center and kneel before the collected rulers:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|If we were in [[Shadowforge City]], I would have you tossed into the [[Ring of Law]] for your transgressions, Ambassador. The darkest dungeons of Ironforge will have to do for now.}}
:{{text|say|Ambassador Slaghammer|Do as you will with me. I am not afraid. That halfbreed runt will never be my emperor! Long live Twilight's Hammer!}}
:{{text|say|Ironforge Guard|I'll escort you to your new 'accomodations', your Excellency.}}
:''The two walk off and disappear.''

This concludes the [[Kharanos quest chain]], and thus, the [[Dun Morogh storyline]]. Up next is [[Reinforcements for Loch Modan]], offered by [[Mountaineer Barleybrew]], also in the High Seat.

==Progression==
{{Gol'Bolar Quarry quest chain}}
