==Objectives==
Bring the Honorary Cleavers to [[Gryth Thurden]] in [[Ironforge]]. 
*[[Honorary Cleavers]] (provided)

==Description==
Here are the honorary cleavers for Gremlock's students. If you've already been to [[Kharanos]], then you should fly a gryphon back there!

Take the cleavers to our gryphon master, Gryth Thurden, and speak with him about a ride back to Kharanos.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*475 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]
*+25 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
You look like you have somewhere to go.  Need one of my gryphons? 

==Completion==
You have to get these to Kharanos, eh?  That won't be a problem.  As long as you've already been to Kharanos and spoken to Brolan Galebeard, then you can take one of my gryphons back to him.

==Progression==
