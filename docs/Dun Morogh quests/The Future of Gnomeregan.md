;All classes but warlock: <Class>s like you will play an important part in the future of Gnomeregan. To that end, our leader, {{NPC||Gelbin Mekkatorque||High Tinker Mekkatorque}}, has assembled a team of trainers to help you learn your arts.
;Warlock: We're going to need all the help we can get to reclaim our home and rid ourselves of the [[trogg]]s and [[leper gnome|irradiated gnome]]s. To that end, our leader, High Tinker Mekkatorque, has assembled a team of trainers to help your learn your, uh, "arts".

;Hunter: {{NPC||Muffinus Chromebrew}} will help oversee your training and adjustment to life on the surface.  He's waiting for you on the stands across the road.
;Mage: {{NPC||Bipsi Frostflinger}} will help oversee your training and adjustment to life on the surface. She's waiting for you on the ground floor of the tall building to the east.
;Monk: [[Xi, Friend to the Small|Xi, Friend of the Small]]{{sic}} has visited us from [[The Wandering Isle|a faraway land]] and will help oversee your training and adjustment to life on the surface. She's waiting for you on the small practice field across the road.
;Priest: {{NPC||"Doc" Cogspin}} will help oversee your training and adjustment to life on the surface. She's waiting for near the cluster of buildings to the east.
;Rogue: {{NPC||Kelsey Steelspark}}, a key member of [[Gnomeregan Covert Ops]], will help oversee your training and adjustment to life on the surface. She should be in the council tent to the east.
;Warlock: {{NPC||Alamar Grimm}} has taken up residence in the building just southwest of this one. He possesses powers similar to yours and can help you get adjusted.
;Warrior: {{NPC||Drill Sergeant Steamcrank}} will help oversee your training and adjustment to life on the surface. He's waiting for you on the small practice field across the road.

''On accept:''

:{{text|say|S.A.F.E. Guide|Follow me, <name>, and I'll introduce you to your trainer, <trainer>.}}
:{{text|say|S.A.F.E. Guide|<Trainer's rank or first name>, allow me to introduce <name>, who helped us rescue survivors in Gnomeregan.}}

==Completion==
;Hunter: For a gnome who has spent so much time inside Gnomeregan, you look positively fit and healthy, <name>.  That's good.  Before we can complete what [[Operation: Gnomeregan]] began, we're going to need more hunters like you.
;Mage: <Name>, isn't it? It's a pleasure to finally meet you.  While you were getting cleaned up, Nevin's team told me about your escape from Gnomeregan. 
;Monk: Why, you look great!  I've heard bad things about what happens down there.
:Well, are you ready to start your training in the ways of the monk?
;Priest: It's good to meet you, <name>.  I'm sure your time in Gnomeregan afforded you ample opportunity to practice your arts.  Things are somewhat safer here, but your talents will never go to waste. 
;Rogue: It's good to meet you, <name>.  Nevin tells me that you managed to survive the dangers in Gnomeregan by using your wits.  That's exactly what we need up here.  Clever minds and quick blades. 
;Warlock: So, another one of Nevin's "rescued" survivors, eh?  More than likely, you saved his life from the troggs down there.  Did he stumble over his words when he mentioned me?  The man has a healthy respect for the [[demon]]ic powers we channel.
;Warrior: For a gnome who has spent so much time inside Gnomeregan, you look positively fit and healthy, <name>.  That's good.  Before we can complete what Operation: Gnomeregan began, we're going to need more warriors like you.
