== Objectives ==
Bring the Sample Casks to {{NPC||Innkeeper Belm}} at the [[Thunderbrew Distillery]] in [[Kharanos]].
*[[Sample Casks]] (provided)

== Description ==
I was supposed to be bringing these casks of ale to the [[inn]] in Kharanos. They contain a mysterious new ale produced by an upstart brewery in [[Brewnall Village]]. As I was leaving town, I was attacked by a [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmane troll]] raiding party. It's going to take me days to repair the wagon!

I don't suppose you'd be willing to do me a favor, will you? These big kegs aren't going anywhere, but I have some smaller sample casks. Would you bring them to Kharanos for me? Just follow the road to the southeast.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{| class="darktable zebra col1-center"
|- 
| {{qty|5}} || [[Tough Hunk of Bread]]
|- 
| {{qty|5}} || [[Refreshing Spring Water]]
|}
You will also receive: {{cost|||10}} (or {{cost|||30}} at max level).

== Progress ==
Welcome, visitor. Have you come to the inn to rest, or do you need a new hearthstone?

== Completion ==
These look promising. I've heard great things about the [[Short and Stout Brewery]], but I haven't had the chance to try their ale until now.

While you're here, relax a little. If you need a spare hearthstone or wish to make Kharanos your home, just speak to me and I'll be happy to help.

== Notes ==
While on the road to Kharanos during [[On to Kharanos]], players will run across Ciara Deepstone just off the road after passing the gnomish gate. Pick up this quest, then continue along the road to reach town.

This quest is the only one non-gnomes can also get.

==Progression==
{{Gnomish starting experience}}
