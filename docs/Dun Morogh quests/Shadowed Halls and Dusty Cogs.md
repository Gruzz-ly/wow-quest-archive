==Objectives==
Find the Prototype Arcane Engine within the [[Engineering Labs]] of [[Gnomeregan]].
* Enter Gnomeregan through the [[Workshop Entrance]]
* [[Prototype Arcane Engine]]

==Description==
An elite aerial unit wouldn't be complete without the newest innovations in [[flying machine]] [[technology]].

There's just one small problem.

The innovative new engine we built was left behind when we evacuated Gnomeregan. We need that prototype if we want these [[bomber]]s to safely get off the ground!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Excellent! I've sent [[Fizzi Tinkerbow|Tinkerbow]] and [[Emaedi Autoblast|Autoblast]] ahead to prepare for{{Sic}} the engine for installation.

==Notes==

On accept, Tread begins pacing back and forth on the platform to deliver a briefing to Tinkerbow, [[Herk Winklespring|Winklespring]], and Autoblast:
:{{Text|say|Captain Tread Sparknozzle|You are Gnomeregan's finest soldiers. Paragons of gnomanity. The best examples of gnomish ingenuity and determination.}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Tread Sparknozzle|And so, you four will be the first to take to the skies as Gnomish Aerial Elite Rangers, and--}}
:{{Text|say|Emaedi Autoblast|Elite Aerial Rangers, sir!}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Tread Sparknozzle|Excuse me, soldier?}}
:{{Text|say|Emaedi Autoblast|You said Aerial Elite Rangers, which would be G.A.E.R. If you wanted G.E.A.R.--}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Tread Sparknozzle|I know what I said! Anyway, you are the first Gnomish Elite Aerial Rangers. And you will show [[Azeroth]] everything we gnomes can accomplish.}}
:''Tread returns to his previous position.''

Head down into Gnomeregan, where members of [[Survivor Assistance Facilitation Expedition|S.A.F.E.]] are busy clearing out the [[Loading Room]], the [[Train Depot]], and the [[Old Dormitory]]. [[Leper gnome]]s are nowhere to be seen. Instead, [[Sanitation Technician]]s can be seen all over the area, spraying water with the help of [[GS-10x Multi-Bot]]s, scrapping metal in large machines, tinkering with [[GS-5x Cargo-Bot]]s, or overseeing teams of [[Gnomish Excavating Machine]]s. [[GS-2x Demo-Bot]]s are pummeling away at piles of debris, and [[G-5 CANARY]] bots are running around scouring the area for any remaining signs of radiation.

[[File:WorldMap-Gnomeregan2.jpg|thumb|Map of Gnomeregan. You start off in the eastern end of the tunnel on the right side of the image.]]
Head north through the Train Depot until you get to the [[Workshop Entrance]]. Click the [[Workshop Door]] to open it, then head through the instance portal to enter a special phased version of the [[Gnomeregan (instance)|Gnomeregan dungeon]], specifically the back tunnel leading to the [[Engineering Labs]]. Upon entering:
:{{Text|say|Fizzi Tinkerbow|Testing. One, two, three. Can you hear me, Commander?}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|Looks like your communication device is working, tinker.}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|Commander, the last gnomes to visit this wing were my own unit on their way to [[Sector 17]]. Watch out for any steam pipes or [[gnomebot]]s in disrepair.}}

The halls are filled with hazards in the form of roaming [[Dust Crawler]]s, stationary [[Broken Robot]]s, and broken pipes. Broken Robots will periodically emit an electric pulse in a large area around them, dealing around 20% of your health in damage, while broken pipes will regularly emit clouds of steam, knocking you back and dealing a significant amount of damage if you try to run through it or jump over it. Dispatch any Dust Crawlers you encounter and time your movements such that you can get past the robots and pipes without taking damage.

At the [[Engineering Labs]], a pack of four [[Leperous Rat]]s will fall down from the ceiling and attack you. The western circuit path is blocked off by a closed gate while an impassable energy field prevents you from heading down into the center of the labs, so continue down the southern path while avoiding hazards and killing more rats and Dust Crawlers.

Eventually, upon reaching the western side of the Engineering Labs, you will enter a small workshop containing a [[Broken Teleporter]] and the [[Prototype Arcane Engine]], guarded by a sleeping [[mechanical wolf]] named [[LASS-E x12]].
:{{Text|say|Fizzi Tinkerbow|My old workshop! The engine should be on the other side of the room. But I don't detect my old combat suit. How odd...}}

LASS-E will aggro as soon as you get close:
:{{Text|say|LASS-E x12|GUARD MODE ACTIVATED.}}

The wolf periodically casts ERROR, bombarding the area with damaging sparks, with the duration increased by 1 second after each use. Kill the wolf:
:{{text|say|LASS-E x12|WAS I A G-GOOD B-B-B-BOY...}}

...and then loot the Protoype Arcane Engine. The moment you do so, the city's security system will activate:
:{{Text|yell|Gnomeregan Security System|Warning! Warning! Intruder alert! Intruder alert!}}

The system will keep repeating its warning roughly every 12 seconds. Luckily, you can now interact with the nearby Broken Teleporter to fix it and instantly teleport back to the surface of New Tinkertown. Head back to Captain Sparknozzle, who is now all by himself; the other members of G.E.A.R. have left.
