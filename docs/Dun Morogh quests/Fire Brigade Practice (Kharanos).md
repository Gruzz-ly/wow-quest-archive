[[File:HallowsEndWaterBarrel.jpg|thumb|Fire brigade water barrel]]
The brave [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Kharanos]] can form a fire brigade in an instant, now that the [[Headless Horseman]] is around.  Do you want to help?

South of here, the mountaineers set up a small area to practice fighting fires.  Go there and throw buckets onto the blazes.  You can fill a bucket from the water barrel here.

Good bye, <name>.  When you're done with fire brigade practice, please visit us again!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Hallow's End Pumpkin Treat]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Ironforge}}

== Progress ==
Hello, <name>. Have you been perfecting your fire fighting techniques? Don't forget about the practice area to the south!

==Completion==
You're smudged with soot! You must have been extinguishing fires!

Well done! As an honorary member of the Kharanos Fire Brigade, I beg you to return here if ever the village needs you!
