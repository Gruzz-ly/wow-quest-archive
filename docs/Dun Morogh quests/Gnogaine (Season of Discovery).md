==Objectives==
Use the Empty Leaden Collection Phial on Irradiated Invaders or Irradiated Pillagers to collect radioactive fallout.  Once it is full, take it back to [[Ozzie Togglevolt]] in [[Kharanos]].
* [[Full Leaden Collection Phial]]
* [[Empty Leaden Collection Phial]] (provided)

==Description==
Since the accident, all [[Gnoarn]] thinks about or talks about is cleansing [[Gnomeregan]] of the [[trogg]] infestation and finding a cure for the sickness that plagues it, <name>.

Luckily, [[Razzle Sprysprocket|Razzle]] and I are close to some kind of cure - either that or the recipe for a really powerful rum.  We won't know until we test!  Naturally, in order to test our theory, we're going to need a few things; namely, fallout from the irradiated troggs in Gnomeregan.  Fill up this phial with the green glow and bring it back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||50}}
*  3150 XP
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles]]

==Progress==
Can't you see we're trying to cure an entire species of gnomes here??! We need more of the green glow!

==Completion==
Excellent work!  The time has come to test the new formula.  If this works, not only should that captured leper gnome be cured, but I should have a full head of hair!  Stand back!

==Notes==
You need to <u>'''Use'''</u> the [[Empty Leaden Collection Phial]] on one of the troggs that glows green (Irradiated Invaders and Irradiated Pillagers).  There are many of these outside the instance.  You can harvest the radiation from a corpse, but it can fail; you may need to try a few times.

You may want to either leave Gnomeregan when you complete this quest, or complete this quest prior to entering, as you get a follow-up quest that requires you to enter the actual instance.

==Progression==
#[[The Day After]] (optional)
#[[Gnogaine (Season of Discovery)]]
#[[The Only Cure is More Green Glow (Season of Discovery)]]
