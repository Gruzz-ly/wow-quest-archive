==Objectives==
Use the [[:Alcohol-Free Brewfest Sampler]] to hit S.T.O.U.T. 5 times.
*[[Self-Turning and Oscillating Utility Target|S.T.O.U.T.]] Hit (5)

==Description==
Hey there! You look like you can handle your brew.

But can you handle your brew mug?

We've been having a bit of trouble with [[Alemental|the ale]] causing chaos around the camp. We've found the best way to stop it is to recapture any living ale by throwing a mug at it!

Looks like you could use some practice. If you can hit S.T.O.U.T., you can probably help out next time the ale springs to life again. Pick up a sampler, take a drink, and toss!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*8,950 [[XP]]
*10x [[Brewfest Prize Token]]

==Progress==
Tosss one back, then toss one forward. S.T.O.U.T. can take the abuse, it's why I built him.

==Completion==
Do you know what that was? [[Gnomish engineering]] at its finest! S.T.O.U.T. took the abuse like a champ!

I think you're ready now to take on the Dark Irons if they show up again.

==Notes==
Walk into the tent near the tables. Pick up a mug. Face S.T.O.U.T and drink. Pick up another mug. Repeat.

;Objective
Use the [[Alcohol-Free Brewfest Sampler]] to hit S.T.O.U.T. 5 times, then talk to [[Boxey Boltspinner]].

;Description
Hey there! You look like you can handle your brew. But can you handle your brew mug?

The [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] have come back with a vengeance to ruin our celebration. Tossing mugs at them is the best way to stop them, but first, let's see if you can toss one at old S.T.O.U.T. here.

It's easy, pick up an alcohol-free sampler and take a drink. Just make sure you're facing S.T.O.U.T. Talk to me after you've hit him 5 times.
