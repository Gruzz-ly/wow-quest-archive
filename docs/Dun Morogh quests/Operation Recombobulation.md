==Objectives==
Bring [[Razzle Sprysprocket]] in [[Kharanos]] 8 Gyromechanic Gears. 
*[[Gyromechanic Gear]] (8)

==Description==
I should go back to Gnomeregan and continue researching a cure for irradiated gnomes.

But, I stayed behind in Kharanos because the town is my home and I wanted to help defend it from the Frostmane attacks.  I've been working on maintaining and repairing the steam tanks.

For some reason, Frostmane Scavengers have taken a liking to the gyromechanic gears I need to complete the repairs.  They're all over the Frostmane front to the southeast of town.  Will you help me get those gears back?

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards

You will also receive:
*450 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]
*250 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Those pilots can't wait to get back into their steam tanks and take to the field again.  Let's not let them down.

==Completion==
These gyromechanic gears are perfect!  These two tank pilots are well on their way to being back in the fight!
