==Objectives==
Board the [[Repaired Bomber]] and use the Iron Hammer Bomb to kill 30 [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] attackers. You may kill any of the Dark Iron dwarves or their allies at the [[Ironforge Airfield]].
* Dark Iron attackers slain x30
* [[Iron Hammer Bomb]] (provided)

==Description==
My chief engineer tells me that he's managed to get one of the bombers repaired and airworthy. Take these bombs with you, and look for the repaired bomber at the start of the runway.

Once you're airborne, use the bombs to do as much damage to the attacking Dark Iron dwarves as you can. I've heard rumors that they're preparing to deploy a new kind of war golem. Keep your eyes peeled for those golems and make them your highest priority targets.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}} (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)

==Progress==
At last, we finally have a chance to hurt the Dark Iron attackers.

==Completion==
The momentum is starting to shift, <name>, largely due to your efforts. Now, it is time to strike at the Dark Iron leadership.

==Notes==
*Head northwest to the northern end of the runway. There, at {{co|77.1|18.5|Dun Morogh}} is the Repaired Bomber. Hop in! Drag the bomb to an action bar and use it to display a targeting reticule on the ground. Take out anything that moves. After killing 30, the bomber will automatically return to the runway.
*The enemies are [[Dark Iron Invader]]s, [[Dark Iron Pyromancer]]s and [[Dark Iron Golem]]s.
