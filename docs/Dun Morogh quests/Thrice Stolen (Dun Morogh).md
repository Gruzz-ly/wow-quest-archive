==Objectives==
Recover the stolen rune from the cave of [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmane]] [[Ice troll|trolls]] in [[Coldridge Valley]]. Use it to learn a new ability, then return to [[Solm Hargrin]] in [[Anvilmar]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Shadowstrike (rogue rune)]]

==Description==
I'm ashamed to admit it, <name>, but those Frostmane buggers got the drop on me. They stole a magical rune I... uh, 'borrowed' from the treasury. I figured it would give me a leg up, so to speak, but I couldn't crack how to make it work.

Go to their cave in the south, and see if you can snatch it back from their stash, would ya? When you find it, try to use the rune yourself. You seem like a bookish sort. No offense.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*{{Race|Dwarf|notext}}+50 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
*{{Race|Gnome|notext}}+50 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles]]
*[[Cracked Leather Gloves]]

==Progress==
Any luck, <name>?

==Completion==
A fine bit of larceny there, <name>. Consider that rune a present from yours truly.

If anyone asks, we never had this conversation, yeah?
