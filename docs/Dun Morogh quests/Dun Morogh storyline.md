'''[[Dun Morogh]]''' is a level 1-20 zone, intended for starting [[dwarf (playable)|dwarves]] and [[gnome (playable)|gnomes]]. For the quests in Dun Morogh before the Cataclysm, see [[Dun Morogh (Classic) quests]].

Encircled by jagged mountain peaks, the snowy region of Dun Morogh has been the cultural heart of [[Ironforge]]'s dwarves for ages. Not long ago, quakes roused numerous [[trogg]]s from their subterranean dwellings, and caused the savage [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmane]] [[Ice troll|trolls]] to abandon their usual holdings on [[Shimmer Ridge]] and encroach upon dwarf-occupied areas.<ref>[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/races/dwarf World of Warcraft Website - Dwarf Race description]</ref>

==Kharanos==
Upon arriving in [[Kharanos]], the [[adventurer]]s are recruited by its citizens to deal with the local [[wendigo]]<ref>[[Culling the Wendigos]]</ref> and Frostmane<ref>[[Frostmane Aggression]]</ref> threats, which were everyday encroaching further upon dwarven lands.<ref>[[Forced to Watch from Afar]]</ref> With the help of the [[Gnomeregan Covert Ops]] stationed at [[Steelgrill's Depot]],<ref>[[Help from Steelgrill's Depot]]</ref> and their Ultrasafe Personnel Launcher,<ref>[[The Ultrasafe Personnel Launcher]]</ref> the adventurers are deployed at the newly built [[Frostmane Retreat]] and deal with the remnants of the troll tribe.<ref>[[Eliminate the Resistance]]</ref>

Leaving the mountaineers to clean up the last of the trolls, the heroes are sent east, to [[Amberstill Ranch]], to check out reports about troll raids on the ranch.<ref>[[A Hand at the Ranch]]</ref> As soon as they arrive, a party of raiders sneak into the stables to steal the [[ram]]s, so they help [[Sergeant Flinthammer]] fending the trolls off.<ref>[[It's Raid Night Every Night]]</ref> Afterwards, they recover the stolen rams from the [[Tundrid Hills]],<ref>[[Rams on the Lam]]</ref> and kill a large wendigo that had been preying on the rams known as [[Vagash]], taking one of his [[Fang of Vagash|fangs]] as proof of the deed.<ref>[[Protecting the Herd]]</ref>

With the ranch safeguarded again, Flinthammer sends the adventurers south to [[Gol'Bolar Quarry]], which had been deactivated since the troggs invaded the mines.<ref>[[Help for the Quarry]]</ref>

==Help for the Quarry==
At the quarry, the adventurers deal with the troggs<ref>[[Those Blasted Troggs!]]</ref> and rescue trapped miners.<ref>[[The Public Servant]]</ref> Once the place is secured, attentions are turned to [[Helm's Bed Lake]] where [[Sergeant Bahrum]] and his detachment are camped. Bahrum has not sent any reports for a very long time, and the adventurers are sent to investigate<ref>[[Trouble at the Lake]]</ref>. They quickly learn the mountaineers were frozen by the [[Water Elemental|water elementals]] at the lake<ref>[[Entombed in Ice]]</ref> and work to release them. Bahrum reveals that with all the chaos in Dun Morogh, the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] had taken over [[Ironband's Compound]] to the south, beyond the lake. Stealing the attack plans from [[Captain Beld]], the sergeant learns the Dark Irons intentions - to cripple Ironforge's defense.<ref>[[Dark Iron Scheming]]</ref>

According to the plans, the first attack would happen on the [[Ironforge Airfield]]. The adventurers quickly head back to Gol'Bolar and hop on [[Mathel Rustwrench]]'s [[Mathel's Flying Machine|flying machine]] to get to the airfield.<ref>[[Get to the Airfield]]</ref> Once they get there, the attack is already occurring.<ref>[[Extinguish the Fires]]</ref> However, using one of the[[Repaired Bomber|repaired bombers]], they manage to repel the Dark Irons and their [[golem]] constructs<ref>[[Striking Back (Dun Morogh)]]</ref> and finally kill [[General Grimaxe]] to end the assault.<ref>[[Grimaxe's Demise]]</ref>

The [[Council of Three Hammers]] had to be informed of the Dark Iron clan's betrayal. The adventurers take [[Stonebreaker's Report]] to the [[High Seat]] in Ironforge, and confront [[Moira Thaurissan]].<ref>[[Demanding Answers]]</ref> Turns out the Dark Irons had been betrayed from within, and some of the dwarves remained loyal to the [[Twilight's Hammer]] cult. [[Ambassador Slaghammer]], the dwarf behind the attacks, is arrested before he could escape the city and brought to the dungeons of Ironforge. However, he was certainly not the only dwarf allied with the Twilight's Hammer, and Moira reminds the council they must remain vigilant against the Twilight's neverending schemes.<ref>[[Seize the Ambassador]]</ref>
