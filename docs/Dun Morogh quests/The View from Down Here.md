==Objectives==
Use the Viewpoint Equalizer on 5 Frostmane Builders in [[Frostmane Retreat]].
* [[Frostmane Builder]]s shrunk x5
*[[Viewpoint Equalizer]] (provided)

==Description==
We need to halt the construction on this Frostmane village. If we let them get too entrenched, it will be more difficult to keep them from settling here permanently.

It's time to give those brutes a gnome's-eye view of the world! Take this gnomish viewpoint equalizer and use it on the Frostmane builders to bring them down to our level. They won't be able to lift their tools and construction will come to a standstill.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}} (or {{cost||3|90}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did you show them what it's like to be a gnome?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. That'll teach them not to mess with us in our home!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eliminate the Resistance]] and [[Strike From Above]] before heading out.

The buildiers are neutral, so even after equalizing them, they won't attack.
*What you do to me?
*Take curse away!
*Can't... lift... tools...
*Why everyone else get so big?
*No make me small!
