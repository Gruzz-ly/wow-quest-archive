==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sergeant Flinthammer]] at [[Amberstill Ranch]].

==Description==
[[Captain Tharran]] asked me to pass along his thanks for your help and congratulations on a successful mission. He and his men are cleaning up the last of the [[Frostmane tribe|trolls]] and tending to the wounded.

He also wanted me to ask you to check out reports about troll raids on the Amberstill Ranch to the north. Ask for Sergeant Flinthammer when you arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]] (or gain {{cost|||30}} at max level)

==Completion==
So you're the one who's been helping Captain Tharran beat back the Frostmane trolls? I've seen your name in the reports. It's good to finally meet you. You might be just the <class> we need to help secure the ranch.

==Notes==
Head to the northeast to reach the main road, then follow it to Amberstill, which will be on the left.
