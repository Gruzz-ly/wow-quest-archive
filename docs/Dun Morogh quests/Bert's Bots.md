==Objectives==
Defeat Bert in a pet battle.
* Defeat [[Environeer Bert|Bert]]

==Description==
If I'm going to clean up [[Gnomeregan]], I've got to be ready to battle all manner of [[rat]], [[roach]], and potentially even the dreaded mutant rat-roach.

What I'm saying is that I need to put these bots to the test! A real, live-action field demo.

Are your pets up for a code review?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*80 [[XP]]
*[[Leprous Sack of Pet Supplies]]

==Progress==
Better bots, by Bert!

==Completion==
I'm going to have to go back to the drawing board!

==Patch changes==
