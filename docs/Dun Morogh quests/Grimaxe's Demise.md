== Objectives ==
Kill General Grimaxe at the [[Ironforge Airfield]].
* [[General Grimaxe]] slain

== Description ==
With you leading the way, we've finally broken the momentum of the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] attack. General Grimaxe, the Dark Iron leader, is attempting to rally his troops from the center of their lines on the frozen lake to the south.

He stands atop one of their new dark iron golems, shouting orders to his men. If he succeeds in rallying them, they may still be able to overpower us. You must prevent that, <name>. Destroy the golem guarding him, then kill General Grimaxe himself. He is the key to our victory.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Airfield Defender's Garb
|Tunic of Dark Leather
|Grimaxe's Black Breastplate
|Stonebreaker's Gauntlets
|Vest of Dark Chainmail
|Grimaxe's Chainmail Breastplate
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||12|}}
* 3,950 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

== Progress ==
If we can defeat General Grimaxe, the Dark Iron forces won't be able to regroup.

== Completion ==
We've done it! Without your help, Ironforge Airfield would surely be occupied by the enemy and the Dark Irons would have a clear road to [[Ironforge]] itself.

The [[Council of Three Hammers]] must be informed of what happened here.

== Notes ==
Grimaxe and the Dark Iron Golem he's riding on can be found at {{co|78.5|34.4|Dun Morogh}} near the north end of the lake. Take out the golem, then take him out!
