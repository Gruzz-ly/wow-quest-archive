== Objectives ==
Retrieve 6 Pilfered Supplies from the [[Grizzled Den]].
*[[Pilfered Supplies]] x6

== Description ==
With the Frostmanes making trouble to our east, the [[wendigo]]s have sensed our weakness and grown bolder in their raids. Only one of the four most recent supply wagons has made it here safely. The wendigos made off with the rest, stashing it in the Grizzled Den, a cave southwest of town. If you're willing to go down there and recover the stolen supplies, you would have the gratitude of all the townspeople and the mountaineers defending [[Kharanos]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Grizzled Den Boots
|Wendigo Leggings
|Wendigo Pantaloons
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

== Progress ==
Did you find any of the missing supplies?

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>. The mountaineers will be glad to hear that half-rations are at an end. They'll need all their strength to continue fighting the [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmanes]].

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Culling the Wendigos]] before heading out. Head due west and down the hill to the grizzled den. Young wendigos are outside, but the adult wendigos and the pilfered supplies are inside, so head in and start collecting. Supplies can be found in the form of pony kegs or crates.

==Progression==
{{Kharanos quest chain}}
