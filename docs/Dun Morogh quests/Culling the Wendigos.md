== Objectives ==
Kill 10 [[Wendigo]]s in the [[Grizzled Den]]. You may kill {{NPC||Wendigo (mob)||Wendigos}} or {{NPC||Young Wendigo}}s.
* Wendigo slain x10

== Description ==
The wendigos in the Grizzled Den to the southwest of town have long been a thorn in our side. They're never quite strong enough to threaten [[Kharanos]] directly, yet they prey on travelers, mountaineer patrols, and supply convoys.

I'm going to be withdrawing my observers from the Grizzled Den because I need them on the troll front. Would you help my men finish culling the wendigo population? Without strength of numbers, they won't be able to attack us.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}} (or {{cost||3|30}} at max level)

== Progress ==
How goes the fight against the wendigos?

== Completion ==
Now that you've dealt with the wendigos, we should be able to focus our efforts on the [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmane trolls]] to the east.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Pilfered Supplies (quest)]] before heading out. Head due west and down the hill to the grizzled den. Young wendigos are outside, but the adult wendigos and the pilfered supplies are inside, so head in and start collecting. Supplies can be found in the form of pony kegs or crates.
