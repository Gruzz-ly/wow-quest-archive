*[[Teldrassil Pink Elekk]] slain (3)
*[[Elekk Dispersion Ray]] (provided)

==Description==
Getting drunk is a time-honored tradition at Brewfest -- it's damn near required!  Thing is, I'm getting reports across [[Azeroth]] saying the celebration's plagued by hallucinations!  We can't have that!

These elekks can't be harmed by normal weapons -- they pass right through 'em -- so take this fabulous piece of gnomish machinery, visit the other beer gardens, and zap 'em to oblivion.

Remember, you have to be wearing Synthebrew Goggles to see 'em!  Tell me if you need a pair.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Are those pesky pink elekks gone yet?

==Completion==
Good work!  Pink elekks... what a preposterous notion!

==Notes==
If you're at one of the beer gardens mentioned (Stormwind, Darnassus, or Exodar), and you don't see the Elekks, you aren't drunk enough. Take another drink. It takes 3 'standard alcoholic beverages' to see the elekks.

Even though the quest giver appears in a "classic" zone, it requires players to visit [[Burning Crusade]] zones. Therefore, players whose accounts are not upgraded with the first expansion set are unable to even pick up this quest.

If it happens to be convenient, you can also go to the beer garden in [[Shattrath City]] for the Teldrassil Pink Elekks there.
