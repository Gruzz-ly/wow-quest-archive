==Objectives==
Recover the rune from the group of [[Trogg]]s, southwest of [[Anvilmar]], and use it to learn a new ability. Then, return to [[Alamar Grimm]] in Anvilmar.
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Haunt (warlock rune)]]

==Description==
I've been experimenting with a new type of magic - a rune which can channel fel energy to fuel powerful spells. I would share this power with you, but it was stolen by one of those pesky troggs.

There is a camp of those [[Rockjaw]] vermin to the southwest. See if you can find my rune stashed among their possessions, likely in a chest of some kind. Once you find it, learn its magic and report back to me. I would like to see my experiment put to use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles (faction)|Gnomeregan Exiles]]
*[[Tattered Cloth Gloves]]

==Progress==
Well, <name>? Any progress?

==Completion==
You seem to have taken well to this new magic, <name>. Find more runes like this and engrave them to your equipment. Wield this power against those who would oppose you.

Someday, perhaps your power will even eclipse my own.
