'''Gathering the Grub''' begins the mandatory [[Brewfest Banquet]] quests at [[Brewfest]].

==Objectives==
Collect Bags of Brewfest Ingredients and deposit them at the wagon.
* [[Bag of Brewfest Ingredients]] (5)
* Ingredients deposited (5)

==Description==
Ah, ye're here! Brewfest is here and we've got a small problem. We can't have a proper feast without the food, but some pesky hozen thought it'd be fun to steal our bags of grub. I'm sure they're just lookin' to fill their own bellies, but it's messin' up our plans!

So here's what I need ye to do: hunt down those hozen and take back the bags they've snatched. There's a good chance ye'll find a few bags just sittin' on the ground too. When ye return, just add the recovered bags to that wagon back there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||5}}
* 30 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Brewfest Prize Token]]

==Progress==
The feast won't come together without those ingredients!

==Completion==
Ah, ye've done it! The cooks will be pleased.

==Notes==
Once the bags have been collected from [[Brew Thief|Brew Thieves]] and [[Barrel Bandit]]s, head to the [[Ingredient Wagon]] and use the {{Abilities|Deposit Resources|id=||icon=}} extra action button.
