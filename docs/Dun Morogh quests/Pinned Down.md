==Objectives==
Kill 6 Crazed Leper Gnomes.
*[[Crazed Leper Gnome]] slain (6)

==Description==
My name is [[Nevin Twistwrench]] and I'm the commander of the [[Survivor Assistance Facilitation Expedition]], or S.A.F.E.

I don't know how you managed to survive the radiation [[Gnomeregan|down here]], <name>, but most of the others haven't fared so well. My team is rounding up the survivors, but the radiation-addled [[leper gnome]]s are too numerous for us to hold back much longer. They've lost their minds!

If you're still strong enough to wield a weapon or cast a spell, would you help us clear out some of these leper gnomes?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||15}} (or {{cost|||60}} at max level)

==Progress==
Help my men get the way cleared out so we can help the other survivors get out of here!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. My men can take it from here. Let's focus on getting the other survivors out now.

==Notes==

This starts the [[gnomish starting experience]]. Freshly-created gnomes wake up in the [[Old Dormitory]] of [[Gnomeregan]], facing {{NPC||Nevin Twistwrench}}. There are a few actively hostile crazed leper gnomes attacking the dormitory from the [[Train Depot]]. Plenty more can be found wandering the depot, lost in their own worlds. Kill six then head back to turn in.

Gnome characters created before Patch 4.0.3a can also accept this quest line.
