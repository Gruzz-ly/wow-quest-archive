# Tanaan Jungle storyline

[[File:WorldMap-TanaanJungle.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]
The '''Tanaan Jungle storyline''' was added in [[patch 6.2.0]]. It deals with the heroes of Azeroth taking the fight to [[Tanaan Jungle]], the seat of the [[Iron Horde]], now under control of {{Au|Gul'dan}} as the [[Fel Horde]].

Much like the [[Garrison Campaign]] before it, some parts of Tanaan Jungle storyline are weekly-gated and offered at random: in this case '''Bane of the Bleeding Hollow''', '''Dark Ascension''' and '''The Fate of Teron'gor''' are offered at random, and '''The Cipher of Damnation''' is offered once all three are done.

Completing the storyline awards the achievement [[In Pursuit of Gul'dan]].
