==Objectives==
Assault the {{Au|Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow}} at [[Zeth'Gol]] in [[Tanaan Jungle]]. 
*Assault the Bleeding Hollow at Zeth'Gol

==Description==
The Bleeding Hollow provide significant reinforcement to the [[Iron Horde]] in Tanaan. From their home in Zeth'Gol they relentlessly pursue our scouts, disrupt our operations, and gather more power for {{Au|Gul'dan}}'s [[magic]].

We should consider a direct raid on Zeth'Gol to make them pull back their forces across the valley. This should give us some breathing room... for a time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|20}}
*600x [[Oil (currency)]]
*2000x [[Apexis Crystal]]
*22,610 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of the Prophet]]

==Progress==
Have you completed the raid yet, general?

==Completion==
Well done, commander! The Bleeding Hollow are sending their best warriors back to Zeth'Gol to defend it.

This should give us an advantage, albeit temporarily.

==Patch changes==
