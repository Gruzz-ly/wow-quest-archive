'''Bringing Down the Iron Horde''' is a daily quest that is randomly offered by [[Parvink]] for each region.

== Objectives ==
Slay 25 [[Iron Horde]] orcs in [[Tanaan Jungle]].
* Iron Horde Orc Slain (25)

== Description ==
Ever since we humiliated 'em at [[Blackrock Foundry]], the Iron Horde has been on the run.  {{Au|Gul'dan}} is converting them all into [[fel orc]]s, but I ain't scared.  A bloodlusting orc is twice as strong but twice as stupid.

Hey!  Let's wade into the battlefields of Tanaan and lay waste to as many orcs as we can.  Orc or fel orc - doesn't matter to me.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|15|40}}
|q1=100|item1=Garrison Resources
}}

== Progress ==
They're not so intimidating after you hack 'em off at the knees.

== Completion ==
<You and Parvink compare stories of your battles throughout the jungle.  Finally, she hollers:>

GLORY TO THE ALLIANCE!!

<...Loud enough to frighten birds from the trees.>

== Gains ==
* 15,070 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Hand of the Prophet]]
