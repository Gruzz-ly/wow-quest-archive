==Objectives==
Assault the {{Au|Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow}} at [[Zeth'Gol]] in [[Tanaan Jungle]].
*Assault the Bleeding Hollow at Zeth'Gol

==Description==
The Bleeding Hollow provide significant reinforcement to the [[Iron Horde]] in Tanaan. From their home in Zeth'Gol they relentlessly pursue our scouts, disrupt our operations, and gather more power for {{Au|Gul'dan}}'s [[magic]]. We should consider a direct raid on Zeth'Gol to make them pull back their forces across the valley. This should give us some breathing room... for a time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Oil (currency)]] (600)
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (2000)
*{{cost|46|20|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Vol'jin's Headhunters]]

==Progress==
Have you completed the raid, general?

==Completion==
I already have reports of Bleeding Hollow [[hunter]]s falling back to Zeth'Gol. This will give us a good edge in the battles to come.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.2.0|note=Added.}}
