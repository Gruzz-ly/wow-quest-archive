==Description==
Demons!  Hate 'em!

{{Au|Gul'dan}} is spinning up more summoning portals with each passing hour.  There's only one way to stem the tide, <name>.

<Parvink smashes her gauntleted fist against her open palm.>

Smash 'em!

The [[Temple of Sha'naar]] is a good place to start, or head up to the {{Au|Throne of Kil'jaeden}} if you're looking for a real challenge.

==Progress==
<Parvink looks at some hatch marks she scribbled on a scrap of paper.>

I'm up to 17 demons killed today.  You?

==Completion==
Nice!  You're quite the slayer, <name>.  Gimmie a low-five!
