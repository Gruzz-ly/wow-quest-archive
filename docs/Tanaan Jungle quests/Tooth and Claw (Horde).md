'''Tooth and Claw''' is a daily quest that is randomly offered by [[Nimi Brightcastle]] for each region.  It is the only one to reward {{item|Blackfang Claw|s}}, and only one of two quests to give reputation with the [[Saberstalkers]].

== Objectives ==
Collect 100 Tanaan Jungle Teeth from the various wildlife within [[Tanaan Jungle]].
* [[Tanaan Jungle Tooth]] (100)

== Description ==
Beyond the meager shelter of these fortress walls, the jungle closes in.  Can you feel it?  That is the untamed wilderness, <class>, calling forth our primal instincts.  There is no better way to feel alive than to court death.

Join me in the hunt, <name>!  Collect teeth from the wild beasts.  The [[ravager]]s in [[Thornmire]], the [[raptor]]s in [[Zorammarsh]] - even the sea creatures along [[Scuttler's Coast|the strand]] and the little [[podling]] plants themselves all have teeth.  Bring them to me!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=100|item1=Blackfang Claw
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|16|98}}
*1,350 [[XP]]
*+1,500 reputation with [[Saberstalkers]]

== Progress ==
I trust the hunt goes well?

== Completion ==
Oh, this is quite the collection.  How many of these sunk into your flesh?  Exhilarating, isn't it?

==Notes==
*The Blackfang Claws from this quest do not count towards the [[I Came, I Clawed, I Conquered]].
