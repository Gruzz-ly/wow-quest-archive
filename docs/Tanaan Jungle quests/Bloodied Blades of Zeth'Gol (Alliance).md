==Objectives==
Collect 25 Bleeding Hollow Ritual Blades from {{Au|Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow}} orcs in [[Zeth'Gol]].
*[[Bleeding Hollow Ritual Blade]] (25)

==Description==
The Bleeding Hollow clan is infamous for their [[Blood magic|blood rituals]]. The brutes carve sigils into their flesh and create potions from the blood of their strongest warriors.

The curved ceremonial blades they use have a power all their own. Gather some of these for me. We will deprive them of these weapons and learn something about our enemy at the same time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (500)
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of the Prophet]]

==Progress==
We [[draenei]] have had little contact with the Bleeding Hollow before this war. They were an insular clan living in one of the most hostile parts of {{Au|Draenor}}.

==Completion==
What terrible instruments these are! We will learn what we can from these and then destroy them.

==Patch changes==
