==Objectives==
Meet with [[Reshad]] at [[Atkar's Post]].
*Meet with Reshad at Aktar's Post
*Ride to Aktar's Post secured

==Description==
Iskar disappeared and now the Shadow Council is at our throats. These can't be unrelated events. We need to go to the last place he was seen, the ruins of Kra'nak.

I've asked a friend to set up a camp nearby. I say we head there to continue our search. 

==Completion==
Ah, <name>. You're just in time.

Aktar says the Shadow Council are teaching the Sethekk their vile ways. There are even a group of High Arakkoa that have joined the Shadow Council's banner!

I wonder how does Iskar factor into this?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|54|}}
