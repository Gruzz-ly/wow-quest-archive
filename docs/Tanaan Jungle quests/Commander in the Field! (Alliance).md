==Objectives==
Get reports from various scouts in Tanaan Jungle.
*[[Altauur|Speak with the scout in southwest Tanaan Jungle]]
*[[Rangari Laara|Speak with the scout in northwest Tanaan Jungle]]
*[[Amber Kearnen|Speak with the scout in northeast Tanaan Jungle]]

==Description==
This battle will be won, but it will be hard fought. Our {{Au|rangari}} did manage to get a few scouts out to the rest of the jungle though.

Perhaps it is best you collect this intelligence yourself and see what this jungle holds for us all.

''On accept:''
: {{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Go now commander.  We will continue to put pressure on this front.}}

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|30|80|}}
*[[Oil (currency)]] (25)

== Progress ==
There's a lot to see here isn't there?

==Completion==
This will be a difficult campaign to be sure.

== Notes ==
=== Altauur ===
We meet again, friend.  This place is not [[Gorgrond]], but I do not miss the giant beasts that shake the earth!

I have reports on [[Zeth'Gol]], the [[Temple of Sha'naar]], and the [[Zorammarsh]].

''{{gossip|Tell me of Zeth'Gol.}}''
: These [[Bleeding Hollow clan (alternate universe)|Bleeding Hollow]] are fearsome hunters and trappers.  They have lived well in this jungle.  Deep inside their village they practice dark [[blood magic]].  That cannot be good for us, so I must recommend reducing this village to ash at the earliest opportunity!

''{{gossip|What is happening at the Temple of Sha'naar?}}''
: They destroyed this village some time ago and replaced it with training grounds, demon summoning, and corrupting the wildlife into [[fel]] weapons.

: The people that died here must be avenged, commander!

''{{gossip|What do you know of Zorammarsh?}}''
: Nobody owns the swamp, it is a death trap.  [[Raptor]]s, giant [[bat]]s, giant [[snake]]s... and something else.  There's some kind of giant shadow that prowls there.  I felt its eyes on me while I inspected a mutilated corpse.

: Needless to say I did not linger.

=== Rangari Laara ===
The hunt continues here, commander.  I have reports on [[Aktar's Post|Aktar's Watch]]{{sic}} just to the northwest and the [[Ironmonger's Hold]], that big tunnel to the southeast.

''{{gossip|[[Arakkoa]] in Tanaan?  Tell me more of Aktar's Watch{{sic}}.}}''
: [[Arakkoa Outcasts|The outcasts]] are concerned about their brethren.  Some lost souls are being trained by the {{Au|Shadow Council}} in fell magics and demon summoning.  They have even recruited some high arakkoa as well but that area is significantly more dangerous, you will need allies to clear that particular area out.  We should clear out this poisonous nest soon.

''{{gossip|How defended is that [[Iron Horde]] tunnel?}}''
: The hold still has forces in it, but with the recent "landscaping" from the citadel, they have apparently been breached by more of those [[Pale orc|Pale]].

: We could probably leave it alone and let the Iron Horde and Pale fight it out in there, but I suspect there may be useful resources to "acquire" as well.

=== Amber Kearnen ===
I'm not sure if I've ever been in an area that was more determined to kill me!

That being said I have some early information on [[Ironhold Harbor]] just to the northwest, the [[Fel Forge]] to the southeast, and the [[Throne of Kil'jaeden (alternate universe)|Throne of Kil'jaeden]] up on the mountain right behind you.

''{{gossip|Lots of ships coming into that harbor, what's going on there?}}''
: It appears the Iron Horde is summoning all of its farflung holdings back here.  Most Iron Horde troops disembark at the harbor and immediately go to get converted.  The rest stay and bring in munitions and other resources to feed their army.

: If {{Au|Gul'dan}} is allowed to convert the entire Iron Horde he will have an unbeatable army!

''{{gossip|The Fel Forge looks completely corrupted, what are they building there?}}''
: Combine typical Iron Horde mass weapons building with fel corruption and you have that mess down there.

: They are building tanks, cannons, and infantry weapons infused with fel energy.  Also something bigger further in, something we should really stop them from building.

''{{gossip|Fel corrupted water is just pouring down from the mountain.  What is going on at the Throne of Kil'jaeden?}}''
: I didn't get a great look but I didn't need to, it is a [[Burning Legion]] paradise up there.  Giant demons being summoned, [[infernal]]s raining down from the sky, cultists continuing the flow of corrupted water...

: You should be really careful up there, everything there is big and mean.  I highly recommend you bring friends before you take any offensive actions there.


Near by Amber is [[Goi'orsh]] with [[A Message of Terrible Import]].
