==Objectives==
Place 5 Pentangulate-o-tron 2000s.
*[[Pentangulate-o-tron 2000]] (5)
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
<Sir/Ma'am>, we built a vehicle to bypass [[Vol'mar|the Horde camp]] and take you to the [[Throne of Kil'jaeden (alternate universe)|Throne of Kil'jaeden]]!  There's one problem, the concentrated [[fel]] energy up there is causing the navigation system to go haywire!

I'll need you to place some sensors along the edge of the summit.  With them in place we can stabilize the flight controls.

Just be sure to have some friends with you, the [[demons]] up there look especially vicious!

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 experience

== Progress ==
Do you have those sensors in position?

==Completion==
Welcome back!

We're getting a strong feed from those sensors!  The crew locked the navigation system on to the signal and everything should be good to go!

We set the machine up next to [[Skyguard Thann]].

==Patch changes==
