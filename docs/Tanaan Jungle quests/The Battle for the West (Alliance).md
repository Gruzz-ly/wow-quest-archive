==Objectives==
Go to the Iron Front and speak with Exarch Maladaar.
*Talk to Thann to fly to the Iron Front
*Speak with Maladaar

==Description==
Our base is barely built and already the Iron Horde sets up defenses against us. Still the plan worked and we fight on two fronts.

I have received word that Exarch Maladaar has finally breached the western gates as well, but is bogged down in a pitched battle. You should go see the situation for yourself.

==Completion==
Now you see what we face here. We will keep as much pressure here as we can so your base can remain free to attack all over the jungle.

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|11|60|}}
*[[Oil (currency)]] (25)

==Notes==

;Speak with Exarch Maladaar
Our losses were almost more than I could bear... but we made it through.  To this!

{{Gossip|What's the situation?}}

:Our siege began the moment you took the boats.  It looked like it would be a long battle until a large part of their forces departed suddenly, most likely when you attacked from the east.

:Then we hit them with everything.  [[Thaelin Darkanvil|Thaelin]] brought in a massive powered ram and the gates fell quickly.  Then we ran into this new foe... the fel orcs.  They press us sorely and we can make no headway.  I hope you are having better luck in the east.
