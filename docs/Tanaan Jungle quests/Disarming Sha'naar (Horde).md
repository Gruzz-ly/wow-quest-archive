Collect 8 Unrefined Draenic Crystals from the mines located within the [[Temple of Sha'naar]] in [[Tanaan Jungle]].
*[[Unrefined Draenic Crystal]] (8)

==Description==
[[Draenei]] at the Temple of Sha'naar would mine these mountains for perfect crystals used to channel their [[magic]]s. Now [[demon]]s be lootin' the place. We gotta keep those crystals out of demonic hands, commander!

Attack the mines behind the temple and grab them crystals.

==Progress==
What you find up there, commander?

==Completion==
They don't look like much, do they?

I put these in safekeeping, commander. The [[Blood elf|blood elves]] might know what to do with 'em.
