Up in the hills of Tanaan Jungle, the Sargerei have converted a once-sacred temple into a den of [[demon]]ic summoning.

We must attack them now, before their rituals complete.  The longer we delay, the stronger our enemy grows.

You will receive:
*{{cost|46|20}}

*2000x [[Apexis Crystal]]
*22,610 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of the Prophet]]

How goes the attack, sir?

Welcome back, commander.  Our scouts just returned with word of your success.

Well done!
