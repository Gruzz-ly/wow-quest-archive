==Objectives==
Collect the Black Candle, the Tome of Protection, and the Shadowblade at the Fel Forge and bring them to Oronok.
*Steal [[The Black Candle]]
*Steal [[The Tome of Protection]]
*Steal [[The Shadowblade]]

==Description==
The ritual site is already prepared, and it is protected by a barrier... one that I created. I can destroy the barrier, but I will need three items currently in use at Forge Camp Vengeance.

If you can get those ritual items, I will meet you at the Corrupted Refuge and remove the barrier. Even if it kills me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Not a moment too soon. He has summoned something, I fear the ritual is close to complete.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.2.0|note=Added.}}
