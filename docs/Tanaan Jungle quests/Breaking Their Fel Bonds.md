==Objectives==
Collect 20 Vials of Fel Blood from fel orcs throughout Tanaan Jungle.
*[[Vial of Fel Blood]] (20)

==Description==
Gul'dan's fel poison turns already ferocious orcs into hateful, vicious creatures with no soul. But were he here to guide us, Prophet Velen wouldn't give up on the whole race. If you could find samples of their blood, maybe we can reverse the process?

You'll find fel orcs all over Tanaan, but the Iron Front, the Fel Forge, and the Throne of Kil'jaeden are the most densely populated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (500)
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of the Prophet]]

==Progress==
Were you able to secure some blood samples? I will not inquire as to your methods, commander.

==Completion==
Thank you, commander. Our scholars will study these samples at once!

We mustn't give up hope. Our eredar brothers are seemingly lost forever, but orcs from the world of Azeroth managed to break free from the Burning Legion....
