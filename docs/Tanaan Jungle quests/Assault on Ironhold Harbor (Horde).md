==Objectives==
Assault the [[Iron Horde]] reinforcements at [[Ironhold Harbor]] in [[Tanaan Jungle]].
*Assault the Iron Horde forces at Ironhold Harbor

==Description==
The Iron Horde continues to bring in reinforcements from all over {{Au|Draenor}} to reinforce their position at {{Au|Hellfire Citadel}}. If we don't cut off the flow of supplies then we risk losing control of our plans in Tanaan.

A strategic attack to the supply lines at Ironhold Harbor is just the thing to keep the Iron Horde on the defensive and maintain our momentum.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Oil (currency)]] (600)
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (2000)
*{{cost|46|20|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Vol'jin's Headhunters]]

==Progress==
How goes the assault, general?

==Completion==
Word of your success has already been passed on by our scouts. 

Lok'tar!
