==Objectives==
Collect 20 Vials of Fel Blood from fel orcs throughout Tanaan Jungle.
*[[Vial of Fel Blood]] (20)

==Description==
Orcs that drink Gul'dan's poison turn into fel beasts. Soulless savages.

Lady Liadrin an' the Blood Knights think maybe there be a way back. They be wantin' samples of blood from freshly turned orcs. Get their blood, <name>!

You be findin' fel orcs all over Tanaan, but the Iron Front, the Fel Forge, and the Throne of Kil'jaeden is where you find the most.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (500)
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Vol'jin's Headhunters]]

==Progress==
You bleed 'em dry, commander?

==Completion==
I get these to Lady Liadrin then.

You really think there be a way back for these monsters, commander? You got a brighter outlook then me, mon.
