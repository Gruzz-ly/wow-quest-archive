==Objectives==
Place 5 G-X3 Telemetry Beacons.
*[[G-X3 Telemetry Beacon]] (5)
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
<Sir/Ma'am>, we built a vehicle to take ya up to the {{Au|Throne of Kil'jaeden}} but whenever we try a test flight the navigation system goes crazy!

In my expert opinion it's 'cause of that crazy [[demon]] magic the [[Iron Horde]] is playing around with up there. If you could travel up there and place these telemetry beacons we can program the vehicle and give you a stable flight all the way up. Just be sure to have some friends with you, the demons up there look especially vicious!

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 experience

==Completion==
Hey welcome back! The signal's coming in loud and clear and the ship's good to go!

When you're ready to head back up just take the rocket for the fastest ride on {{Au|Draenor}}! We set it up over near [[Gargash the Diver|Gargash]].
