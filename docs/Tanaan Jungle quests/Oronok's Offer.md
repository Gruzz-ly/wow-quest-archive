== Completion ==
I am glad you trusted me, <name>. I feel like a great weight has been lifted from me.

I still owe Draenor a great debt for the part I played in Gul'dan's plot. My sons will aid the shamans in rebuilding and hiding the shards. Also, if you will allow it, I want to help you remove Gul'dan from this world.

I will serve you... Commander.
