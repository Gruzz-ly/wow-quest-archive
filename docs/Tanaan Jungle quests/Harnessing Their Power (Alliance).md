==Objectives==
Collect a Wargronn Harness from an [[Iron Wargronn (Tanaan Jungle)|Iron Wargronn]] at the [[Iron Front]] in [[Tanaan Jungle]].
*[[Wargronn Harness]]

==Description==
We have always believed that the primal creatures of {{Au|Draenor}} could not be tamed. And yet, the [[Iron Horde]] found a way to weaponize the [[gronn]]. It would be to our advantage to learn how.

Venture to the Iron Front, slay a Wargronn, and retrieve its harness. You may want to find help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (500)
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Hand of the Prophet]]

==Progress==
{{Au|Exarch Maladaar}} reports that the battlefield is in chaos. Were you able to persevere?

==Completion==
My word, that device is enormous. Thank you for carrying it all the way back here.

There is so much my people can still learn about this world!

==Patch changes==
