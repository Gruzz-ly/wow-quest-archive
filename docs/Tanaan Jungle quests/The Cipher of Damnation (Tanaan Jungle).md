==Objectives==
Get Oronok and your ally to destroy the barrier, then stop Gul'dan.
*Speak with your allies and break the barrier
*Enter the [[Corrupt Refuge]]
*Destroy [[Cyrukh]]

==Description==
Your ally and I will remove this barrier now, though it will take a greater part of our strength. What lies beyond will not be easy. Gul'dan will have empowered an elemental lord with the Cipher, driving it insane. He will use it to destroy the link between the elements and Draenor. If you destroy that elemental, we could recover the Cipher.

==Completion==
;Alliance
You have saved us all. The Cipher has become fragmented with Cyrukh's death. This means its guardians can hide the shards all over Draenor so the chances of piecing it together will be impossible.

This great victory will give us more time to stop Gul'dan but I shudder to think of what his next plan may be...

;Horde
You have saved us all. The Cipher has become fragmented with Cyrukh's death. This means its guardians can hide the shards all over Draenor so the chances of piecing it together will be impossible.

This victory will echo through the halls of your warriors and spur them to greater deeds. Gul'dan can continue plotting... he will fail...

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You receive {{cost|46|20}}|Baleful Tunic|Empowered Apexis Fragment}}

==Gains==
*22,610 experience
*{{Alliance}} 2,500 reputation with [[Hand of the Prophet]]
*{{Horde}} 2,500 reputation with [[Vol'jin's Headhunters]]
