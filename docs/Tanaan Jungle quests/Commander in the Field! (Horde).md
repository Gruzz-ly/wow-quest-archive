==Description==
We have been stopped by these new fel orcs, but we will ultimately prevail. Draka and I did manage to get a full scouting group out into the jungle to gather what else we will have to deal with.

You should seek them out, gain a full understanding of what we face here.

*{{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Vol'jin's Headhunters]]
