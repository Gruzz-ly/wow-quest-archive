==Objectives==
Go to the Iron Front and speak with Durotan.
*Talk to [[Gargash the Diver|Gargash]] to fly to the Iron Front
*Speak with Durotan

==Description==
Our base is barely built and already the Iron Horde sets up defenses against us. Still the plan worked and we fight on two fronts.

I have received word that Durotan has finally breached the western gates as well, but is bogged down in a pitched battle. You should go see the situation for yourself.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|60|}}
*[[Oil]] (25)
*11,300 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Vol'jin's Headhunters]]

==Completion==
Now you see what we face here. We will keep as much pressure here as we can so your base can remain free to attack all over the jungle.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.2.0|note=Added.}}
