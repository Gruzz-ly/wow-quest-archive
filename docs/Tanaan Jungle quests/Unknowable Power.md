==Objectives==
Collect a Fel-Corrupted Apexis Fragment from any Treasure or from any Rare or Rare Elite creature in [[Tanaan Jungle]].
*[[Fel-Corrupted Apexis Fragment]]

==Description==
The one they call {{Au|Gul'dan}} has ruined his own people, and now seeks to ruin what remains of [[Arakkoa|mine]] as well. The fallen outcasts at [[Ruins of Kra'nak|Kra'nak]] have already pledged themselves to Gul'dan in a false promise of a return to the skies. He has given the most powerful of his minions the power of the [[Apexis]], but twisted in a way that I cannot explain. Bring one of these fragments to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|ac=1500}}
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+1500 [[reputation]] with [[Order of the Awakened]]

==Progress==
This is simply the beginning of what you must do to save what remains of the Arakkoa.

==Completion==
As your [[Khadgar|archmage]] told me, the power that has warped these crystals comes from far beyond [[Draenor (alternate universe)|this world]]. I will need more help in discovering how to turn back the darkness inside my people.

==Patch changes==
