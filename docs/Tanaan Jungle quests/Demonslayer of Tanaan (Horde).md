==Objectives==
Slay 20 [[demon]]s in [[Tanaan Jungle]].
* Demons Slain (20)

==Description==
Look to the north, <class>. The sky is turning a sickly green. Gul'dan's summoning portals are not yet at full strength, but already the stench of demon is on the wind.

Slay them, <name>. Destroy as many beasts as you can before they find a way to Azeroth. The Temple of Sha'naar is infested, as is the Throne of Kil'jaeden, although you may find others wandering about jungle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Vol'jin's Headhunters]]
*100x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
How many demons were slain by your capable hands?

==Completion==
How does it feel, <name>? To look the Burning Legion directly in the eye and to tell them... "Not today."
