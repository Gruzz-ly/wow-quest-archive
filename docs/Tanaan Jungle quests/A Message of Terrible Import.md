==Objectives==
Go to the [[Vault of the Earth]] and speak with [[Lagar the Wise]].
*Go to the Vault of the Earth
*Speak with Lagar the Wise

==Description==
Your scout... he got me out of that hellish place.  [[Fel orc]]s surprised us out in the jungle and dragged us up the mountain.  They tortured us... killed all but me.  I fear one of us may have given up our secret before the end.

I must ask you to go to the home of our order.  Speak with Lagar, my leader, tell him... tell him {{Au|Gul'dan}} knows.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80}}
*18,840 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is most unfortunate.

==Completion==
We will speak more of this later, but thank you.

==Notes==
;Speak with Lagar
''{{gossip|You are Lagar?  I bring word from a [[shaman]] of your order.  He says... Gul'dan knows.  May I ask what this means?}}''

: Thank you friend.  It means that an ancient secret has been revealed to the worst person possible.

: I will need to summon the rest of my order to defend it.

: You lead the army that opposes Gul'dan?  You are welcome here and we will assist where we can.  We are few, but are well respected by the [[Elemental spirit|elemental forces]] of {{Au|Draenor}}.

: We will speak of this secret later.  Go in peace.
