Collect 20 Shadow Council Missives from {{Au|Shadow Council}} representatives in the [[Ruins of Kra'nak]] or the {{Au|Throne of Kil'jaeden}}.
*[[Shadow Council Missive]] (20)

==Description==
{{Au|Gul'dan}} has been building a [[spy]] network for himself - the so-called "Shadow Council". As they struggle to control [[Tanaan]], the Shadow Council has grown careless. Their members are out in the open, recruiting arakkoa at the Ruins of Kra'nak or summoning [[demon]]s at the Throne of Kil'jaeden.

Find members of the Shadow Council and acquire any intelligence they were foolish enough not to destroy!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (500)
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of the Prophet]]

==Progress==
What have you learned?

==Completion==
Yes, yes, so many papers... Ah, some of this is in code. It's all very crude, though. Our scholars will learn much from this. Well done commander!
