==Objectives==
Assault the Iron Horde reinforcements at [[Ironhold Harbor]] in [[Tanaan Jungle]].
*Assault the [[Iron Horde]] forces at Ironhold Harbor

==Description==
The Iron Horde continue to bring in reinforcements from all over {{Au|Draenor}} to reinforce their position at {{Au|Hellfire Citadel}}. If we don't cut off the flow of supplies then we risk losing control of our plans in Tanaan.

A strategic attack to the supply lines at Ironhold Harbor is just the thing to keep the Iron Horde on the defensive and maintain our momentum.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|20}}
*22,610 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of the Prophet]]
*600x [[Oil (currency)]]
*2000x [[Apexis Crystal]]

==Progress==
How goes the assault, sir?

==Completion==
Welcome back, commander.  Our scouts just returned with word of your success.

Well done!
