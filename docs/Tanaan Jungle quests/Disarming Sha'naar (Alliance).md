==Objectives==
Collect 8 Unrefined Draenic Crystals from the mines located within the [[Temple of Sha'naar]] in [[Tanaan Jungle]].
*[[Unrefined Draenic Crystal]] (8)

==Description==
[[Draenei]] at the Temple of Sha'naar would mine these mountains for perfect crystals to power our arcane devices. Sadly, the temple is lost to us - we have been betrayed by the [[Sargerei]].

<Name>, it is imperitive that you venture into those mines and secure those crystals before the Sargerei use them in their demonic rituals. If you must kill our former brothers and sisters, so be it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (500)
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of the Prophet]]

==Progress==
That temple was once a place of peace and solitude. I fear it is forever corupted{{sic}}.

==Completion==
Very good, <name>. Our scholars will be able to use these crystals to protect and empower our people.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.2.0|note=Added.}}
