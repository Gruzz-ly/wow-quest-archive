'''Tooth and Claw''' is a daily quest that is randomly offered by [[Parvink]] for each region.  It is the only one to reward [[Blackfang Claw]]s, and only one of two quests to give reputation with the [[Saberstalkers]].

== Objectives ==
Collect 100 Tanaan Jungle Teeth from the various wildlife within [[Tanaan Jungle]].
* [[Tanaan Jungle Tooth]] (100)

== Description ==
These wimps lugging wood around the jungle keep talking about how dangerous it is.  You know, between the [[Thornmire|ravager den]] to the south or the [[raptor]]s that stalk [[Zorammarsh]] - hey, even the [[Lobstrok|beach creatures]] or [[podling]]s have teeth!

What do you say you and I do a little hunting?  Collect teeth from wild beasts.  The bigger the beast, the more teeth.  Meet me back here and we'll compare our haul!

== Rewards ==

== Progress ==
Ready to compare notes?

<Parvink is covered in bleeding scratches and shredded leaves.>

Hey, not bad!  We'll call it a tie.  This jungle don't scare me for nothin'.

Maybe we can hunt some more tomorrow?
