==Objectives==
Recover volumes of the tomes kept within the [[Sepulcher of Knowledge|Sepulcher]].
*[[Guide To Marching]]
*[[Krexus's Guide To War]]
*[[World of Crafting War]] (2)
*[[War, Is It Art?]] (2)
*[[Beginner's Guide to Polearms]] (2)
*[[Pretend To Win]] (3)
*[[How Not To Lose]] (3)
*[[Alver's Annals of Strategy]] (5)

==Description==
Now that the door to the Sepulcher is unlocked, we can venture inside.

And by "we", I mean "you". Until it's safe, at least.

The volumes within contain the collected wisdom of the greatest military minds of [[Maldraxxus]]. For the good of the [[Necrolord]]s, do whatever is needed to gather these precious volumes.

It is safe to assume that the books will be protected by traps. The [[Primus]] wouldn't want just anyone laying their hands on this knowledge.

Once you clear a path, I'll join you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|50|40}}
* 12,500 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
Were you successful?

==Completion==
Fine work so far.

Access to the secret archives is almost ours!

==Notes==
Click on the Tower Door to enter the tower and start interacting with the books, which lie scattered in and around the shelves throughout the various floors. Watch out for the various traps: hostile, roaming [[Tome of War|Tomes of War]], [[Spinning Bookshelf|Spinning Bookshelves]] that shoot out book projectiles, and—as you ascend further up—[[Library Trap]]s that spit out damaging orbs that roll down the stairs and [[Defense Protocol]] lasers that damage and knock you back if you're caught in them.

On a platform halfway up the stairs, the broker appears. At this point, you should have all the books. If not, you need to run back down.
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|Ah, it appears safe enough to join you. Couldn't let you face the dangers ahead alone, after all.}}
