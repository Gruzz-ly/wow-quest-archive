==Objectives==
Enter the [[Maw]].
* Jump into the [[Soul Pillar]] from the [[Ring of Transference]]

==Description==
Take [[:Amulet of the Horsemen|this amulet]]. One like it is carried by each of the [[Four Horsemen]].

The amulets are imbued with a power that links them to one another. That connection should help you locate [[Darion Mograine]].

No doubt Darion has witnessed countless horrors in the Maw. Perhaps he has caught sight of the [[Alexandros Mograine|missing baron]].

Let us hope he can lead you to our [[Azeroth]]ian allies as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|57|}}
* 7,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The area is quiet. There is no sign of your allies.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Go carefully, champion. Find Darion and he will aid your hunt for the missing baron.}}
:{{text|say|[[Attendant Protector]]|Attention, <name>. Please follow me.}}

Bolvar has unique gossip text during this quest:
:Be on your guard within the Maw, lest your soul be lost forevermore.

The Attendant Protector walks into the center of the [[Ring of Fates]].
:{{text|say|Attendant Protector|The teleportation pad will take you to the Ring of Transference.}}
:{{text|say|Attendant Protector|From there, you may leap into the Soul Pillar. It is the stream of souls funneling into the Maw.}}
:{{text|say|Attendant Protector|I imagine your journey will not be a pleasant one. Ah, well. Good luck!}}

Use the transport rune to go to the Ring of Transference, then take a flying leap off the ring through the center to arrive at [[Ve'nari's Refuge]] in the Maw.

The quest completes automatically, and the followup also starts automatically: [[The Hunt for the Baron]]

;Description
Take this amulet. Each member of the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Ebon Blade]] carries a similar one.

[[Darion Mograine|Darion]] is one of my horsemen, as such, this amulet should be able to track his [[soul]]. Find him first, and maybe he has some idea on where we can find any of our missing companions.
