==Objectives==
Meet [[Alexandros Mograine]] at the [[House of the Chosen (subzone)|House of the Chosen]] in [[Maldraxxus]].

==Description==
[[Vyraz]]... all this time...

This cannot stand, <name>. We must avenge [[Margrave Krexus|Krexus]] and cut him down!

He must have sent you to the [[Maw]] expecting that you would never return. He underestimated you. A fatal mistake.

Go with Mograine and claim Vyraz's head. I will warn our forces at the [[Seat of the Primus]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|45|70}}
* 920 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I cannot allow this wound to fester any longer. I will burn it closed here and now!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|We depart for Maldraxxus at once, <name>. Vyraz will answer for his crimes.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord [[Darion Mograine]]|I must return to Azeroth and tell our allies what we've learned, father. But when duty allows it, I will stand once more at your side.}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|There will be time for us to speak later, my son. I swear it.}}
:''Darion walks off to the southeast while Alexandros and Draka head into the [[Ring of Fates]] and despawn.''

There's no quest-provided way to return to Maldraxxus. Consider the flight path to the [[Spearhead (Maldraxxus)|Spearhead]]. Alexandros is waiting at the main entrance to the House of the Chosen, which is now empty of NPCs.

This concludes the "Ritual for the Damned" chapter of the [[Maldraxxus storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[In Death We Are Truly Tested]].

==Progression==

;Objectives
Return to [[Maldraxxus]].

;Description
[[Alexandros Mograine|Alexandros]] seems to know something we don't. If he truly thinks the situation is dire, then we should follow him.

;Completion
I cannot allow this wound to fester any longer. It threatens Maldraxxus as a whole.
