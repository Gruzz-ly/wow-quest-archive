==Objectives==
Prepare to interrogate [[Mephiles the Loyal]].
* Anima-charged Crystals planted (3)
* Ritual triggered
* Ritual witnessed

==Description==
You have proven a useful ally, <name>.

Mephiles undoubtedly possesses a wealth of information for us. However, the [[House of Rituals]] is unforgiving when it comes to betrayal. He will not talk.

Not that it matters. The [[House of Eyes]] has ways to... extract a prisoner's knowledge without the use of words.

Place the charged crystals around me. They will facilitate the interrogation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Mind-Torn Band]]
* {{cost|2|43|35}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let us reveal the truth.

==Completion==
[[Draka]] may be content to forget [[Akarek|our master]], but I will not rest until he is avenged.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Let us begin. Set the crystals in place.}}
:{{text|say|Mephiles the Loyal|Cursed witch... I will never talk!}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Who said anything about "talking"?}}

Three "Place Anima-charged Crystal" doodads light up. Interact with all three, then speak with Vashj:
:I grow anxious to act.
:{{gossip|I'm ready. Begin the ritual.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|We know many ways to pry information from the unwilling...}}
:{{text|say|Mephiles the Loyal|AAAAAAAAGH!}}
:''An image of Mephiles kneeling before [[Mor'Bitan]] appears.''
:{{text|say|Mor'Bitan|With the House of Eyes eliminated, our secrecy has been assured. None remain who will impede our work.}}
:{{text|say|Mor'Bitan|Our [[Kel'Thuzad|new baron]] bids that I complete the ritual personally. Harvest the anima before my arrival. Do not fail me, Mephiles!}}
:''The images disappear. Vashj kills Mephiles.''
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|A secret ritual. The perfect bait to draw him out.}}

;Description
You have proven a useful ally, <name>. How the tides have turned...

With this prisoner, we have a wealth of information in our hands. However, the [[House of Rituals]] is...should we say, "unforgiving" when it comes to betrayal. He will not talk.

But in the [[House of Eyes]], we have ways to learn all we need without words.

Place the charged crystals around me. I shall draw from them to enact the interrogation.

;Completion
Draka may be content to forget our master, but I will not rest until the score is settled.

;Objectives
Bring Mephiles the Loyal to Vashj.
* [[Mephiles the Loyal|Mephiles]] brought to [[Vashj]]
* Ritual triggered
* Ritual witnessed

;Description
You have proven a useful ally, <name>. I will offer my transparency.

Three houses remain in [[Maldraxxus]], and the one I'm scouting--the [[House of Rituals]]--has remained suspiciously quiet in the wake of this destruction.

Luckily, the [[House of Eyes]] thrives on quiet.

[[Vashj's Devoted|My devoted]] captured a [[Maldraxxi necromancer|necromancer]] who strayed from the nest just north of us. He has yet to share anything.

Bring him to me. Perhaps we can change his mind.

==Trivia==
*"War is deception" is a line spoken by Vashj's onetime master [[Illidan Stormrage]] in the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdXl3QtutQI original announcement cinematic] for ''[[Hearthstone (game)|Hearthstone]]''.
