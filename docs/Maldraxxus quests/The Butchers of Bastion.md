:Did these fiends show my kin mercy when they attacked [[Bastion]]? When they tore my brothers and sisters limb from limb and used them to create more of these... these things?!

;Kyrian

==Notes==
Targets include: [[Lesser Amalgam]]s, [[Repurposed Parts]], [[Maniacal Infuser]]s, [[Animated Scraps]], and [[Abhorrent Butcher]]s.

In the center of the quest area, look for the [[Tattered Scroll (Maldraxxus)|Tattered Scroll]], which starts [[Dark Developments]].

Consider dragging a few enemies to a Maldracite core and interact with it to take advantage of Xandria's one-shot when she destroys the core.
