==Objectives==
Kill 7 Fatal Coalescences in the [[House of Rituals]].
* [[Fatal Coalescence]] slain (7)

==Description==
Acolyte, we could use a hand here!

It seems one of your fellow pupils botched their ritual in spectacular fashion. Now destructive necromantic energies are running rampant throughout the house.

This threat must be dealt with. Can you assist?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Discarded Grimoire]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of the threat, acolyte?

==Completion==
Well done, acolyte. The rest should dissipate with time.

Take this, it was left behind by the feckless adept that created this mess. I hope you will put it to better use.

==Notes==
In the [[House of Rituals]] on the Necrolords Campaign, [[Captain Prateq]] offers this optional side quest once players have unlocked the Illusory Guise in [[A Fitting Guise]].

==Progression==
