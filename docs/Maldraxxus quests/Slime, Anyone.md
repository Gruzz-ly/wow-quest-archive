* [[Jar of Venom|Venom]] imbued
* [[Cauldron of Creation|Cauldron]] stirred
* Concoction mixed

==Description==
While I know we're both eager to complete our potion, I believe the best lesson I can share with you is patience.

Patience and [[ooze|slimes]], of course!

With the help of slimes, we'll have our laboratory back in working condition. It's just as I taught you: combine your ingredients in the cauldron. Mix until the viscosity is just right...

Oh, listen to me--acting as if you've never concocted your own sentient being!

Go on, my apprentice! The slimes are calling!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Plagueborn Slime (companion)]]
* {{cost|2|43|35}}
* 910 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Go on, now! You can do it!

==Completion==
What a precious slime!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|I have prepared the cauldron for you. Begin when ready!}}

Near Marileth, three objects stand out, a [[Cauldron of Creation]], a [[Pile of Spores]], and a [[Jar of Venom]]. Interact with them in any order. Marileth has something to say after you interact with each one.

Cauldron of Creation:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|The mixture must not congeal too early!}}

Jar of Venom:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|A splash of venom for viscosity!}}

Pile of Spores:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Some spores to act as a catalyst!}}

Finally:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Excellent! Stir the cauldron once more to complete your work!}}

Stir the pot. Once the channel completes, a [[Plagueborn Slime]] pops out:
:{{text|emote|Plague Deviser Marileth applauds you with pride!}}

:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|I've prepared a cauldron for you. Whenever you're ready, my apprentice!}}

Cauldron
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Stirring the cauldron first? Hm... You make me consider my form, apprentice!}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|How novel! Perhaps disturbing the mixture at this stage will produce new tendencies.}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|...and finally, combining the mixture. Tremendous work, dear apprentice!}}

Venom
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Imbuing your mixture with the venom before all else? Inspired!}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Adding the venom at this stage, while the cauldron bubbles just so... Remarkable, my apprentice!}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|...and just a splash of venom to catalyze the mixture. Brilliantly done, apprentice!}}

Spores
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Ah, starting with spores... You seek a lively creation!}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Now, the spores! Marvelous distribution, too!}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|...and a dusting of spores to bring the concoction together. Excellent form, apprentice!}}

Finally:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|I can sense your creation, apprentice! Stir the cauldron once more... bring your work to fruition!}}
