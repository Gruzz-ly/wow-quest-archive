==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|We'll hold the line! Open the door!}}

Look for a glowing green circle on the ground on the platform. Stand in it to be granted a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Unlock Door|id=331794|icon=ui_sigil_necrolord|range=40|note=Channeled}}

Use it and a cutscene plays:
:''Far from the Bleak Redoubt, Vyraz walks across the bridge toward the Seat.''
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Slay the mortal! Bring me that runeblade!}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Raise your sword, champion! For Maldraxxus!}}
:''The player raises the [[Blade of the Primus]], igniting all five runes on the [[Sanctum Door]] and causing it to open.''
:{{text|say|Voice of the Primus|The foes of the worthy shall be vanquished.}}
:''Swirls of energy gather within the orbs that the hands of the enormous statue above the Seat rest upon. Immense beams of energy begin shooting out, destroying Vyraz's forces.''
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Fall back!}}
:''Vyraz and his surviving troops turn around and flee north. Atop the Bleak Redoubt, Draka, the player, [[Bonesmith Heirmir|Heirmir]], and [[Vashj]] rejoice.''
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|The Seat of the Primus is ours!}}

Run south into the [[Seat of the Primus]]. At the far end is a [[Stone Altar]] in front of a statue of the [[Primus]]. Interact with it to place the Blade of the Primus in the stone and complete the quest, triggering a message from the Primus. As the message plays, several of the player's allies filter in one by one to kneel before the statue—first Draka, then Heirmir and Vashj, and finally a number of [[Prime Shieldguard]]s and [[Hand of Vashj|Hands of Vashj]]—before rising and filtering out again in the reverse order.
:{{text|say|Voice of the Primus|I am the Primus. Your presence within my sanctum means a darkness has fallen upon Maldraxxus... and all the [[Shadowlands|realms of Death]].}}
:{{text|say|Voice of the Primus|Ages ago, the [[Eternal Ones]] punished our brother [[Zovaal]] for his treachery. He was bound within the inescapable [[Maw]], to be forevermore its Jailer.}}
:{{text|say|Voice of the Primus|Now I fear that Zovaal did not act alone. I suspect he had ancient allies... and will seek to win others to his cause.}}
:{{text|say|Voice of the Primus|That you are hearing this message means my suspicions proved true. Zovaal has forged his chains into a weapon... and brought about my defeat.}}
:{{text|say|Voice of the Primus|There is but one hope to save the Shadowlands. The Eternal Ones must stand together once more, before the Jailer escapes the Maw.}}
:{{text|say|Voice of the Primus|Bring my warning to the [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]], the [[Winter Queen]], and the [[Denathrius|Sire]]. They must see to our defenses. Do not let Zovaal reach the sepulcher.}}
:{{text|say|Voice of the Primus|The [[Arbiter]] is the final key. Protect her, or all is lost.}}

This concludes the [[Maldraxxus storyline]], awarding the achievement [[Blade of the Primus (achievement)]]. Draka continues the quest chain by sending players back to [[Oribos]] in [[Words of the Primus]] on a brief interlude before heading to [[Ardenweald]].
