==Objectives==
Collect 30 abomination parts from around [[Maldraxxus]].
*[[Abomination Parts]] (30)

==Description==
I am acquainted with a few fleshcrafters who work outside of the [[House of Constructs (subzone)|House of Constructs]]. If we can find reagents for them, they can supply our war effort with constructs.

The House of Constructs has plenty of excess body parts. Find them and bring them back here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
*3x [[Grateful Offering]]

One from potential rewards:
*X Anima item (35)

==Progress==
We'll take any quality of parts you can find.

==Completion==
I will give these to the fleshcrafters. If we don't have enough soldiers, we will just have to build some.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
