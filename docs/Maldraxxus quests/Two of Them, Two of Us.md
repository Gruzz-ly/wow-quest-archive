==Objectives==
[[File:Sharrex the Fleshcrafter.jpg|thumb|upright|Sharrex the Fleshcrafter]]
[[File:First Apprentice Malkrex.jpg|thumb|upright|First Apprentice Malkrex]]
Defeat Sharrex the Fleshcrafter and First Apprentice Malkrex.
* [[Sharrex the Fleshcrafter]] slain {{co|29.0|22.3|Maldraxxus}}
* [[First Apprentice Malkrex]] slain {{co|29.1|22.2|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Soulfused Construct]] examined {{co|28.9|22.0|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
A construct made entirely of [[kyrian]] flesh...

This betrays everything [[Maldraxxus]] stands for! We are meant to defend the [[Shadowlands]] and all within it, not slaughter and exploit them!

Come, <name>! We end this now!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flesh Architect's Chainmail
|Cruel Executioner's Chestplate
|Deceitful Agent's Vest
|Corpse-Stitcher's Robe
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I sense something within this construct... something familiar...

==Notes==
Mevix joins the party upon accepting the quest. On accept:
:{{Text|say|Secutor Mevix|Cut those traitors down!}}

Run into the room:
:{{text|say|First Apprentice Malkrex|It appears someone has come to steal the secrets of my genius!}}

Nothing too fancy. Sidestep out of the frontal cone. Defeat them:
:{{text|say|First Apprentice Malkrex|My genius... must... endure...}}

Once they're both dead, inspect the [[Soulfused Construct]] on the platform:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Now to destroy their pet project!}}
:''Thales runs up to the construct.''
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|Wait! Do not harm it!}}

==Progression==
{{House of Constructs}}

==Beta version==

;Description
I didn't believe it at first, but that construct is made out of [[Kyrian]]s!

This is not the [[Primus]]'s way!

It's an even fight <name>, let's end this now!

;Completion
The construct is not normal, I sense something unusual about it.
