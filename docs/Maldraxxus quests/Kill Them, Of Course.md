==Objectives==
Slay 8 Enraged Gluttons.
* [[Enraged Glutton]] slain (8)

==Description==
These mindless monstrosities hail from the farthest reaches of the [[Shadowlands]]. The [[anima]] drought has fueled their relentless hunger, driving them to seek new sources.

Their presence here is inconvenient, to put it mildly.

They tear at the land searching for any anima they can find. We must thin their numbers and buy time to safeguard the knowledge locked within the [[Sepulcher of Knowledge|Sepulcher]].

Exactly the sort of work you're accustomed to, yes?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|50|40}}
* 12,500 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
How did the hunting go?

==Completion==
Nicely done. You've bought us precious time.

==Progression==
{{Sepulcher of Knowledge}}

==Beta version==

;Description
These gluttonous monstrosities are usually only seen in the farthest reaches of the [[Shadowlands]]. The lack of [[anima]] though has driven them inward searching for new sources.

They tear at the land searching for any anima they can find. We need to thin them out, and buy some time for the Sepulcher.

Do what you can outsider.

;Notes
[[Colossal Feaster]]s also counted.
