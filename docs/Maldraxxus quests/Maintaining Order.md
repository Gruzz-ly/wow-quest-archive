==Description==
Communication is the key to victory. The greatest strategists are rendered useless if their orders go unheard.

Deliver my orders to Summoner Perex, Drill Sergeant Telice, and Secutor Mevix.

And do it quickly. Every moment we waste is one our enemy will have to their advantage!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You are wasting time.

==Completion==
That should ensure we stand ready for war.

==Notes==
On accepting both Maintaining Order and [[The Hills Have Eyes]]:
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Get moving, recruit! We are at war!}}

Perex is off at the western end of the quest area:
:Why do you trouble me? Can't you see I'm busy?!
:{{gossip|I have orders from Baron Vyraz.}}
:{{text|say|Head Summoner Perex|More orders? What now?}}
:{{text|say|Head Summoner Perex|"Summon [[Mortanis]]"... in this drought?! Preposterous!}}
:{{text|yell|Head Summoner Perex|You there! Tell the baron to scrounge up some [[anima]] if he wants his boneguard!}}
:{{text|say|[[Chosen Warcaster]]|As you command!}}

Telice is southeast of Perex on the [[Ragebringer Terrace]], overseeing a sparring match between two [[Chosen Ragebringer]]s:
:{{text|yell|Drill Sergeant Telice|Strike harder! Show no mercy!}}

Speak with her:
:You're bold to interrupt my lessons.
:{{gossip|I have orders from Baron Vyraz.}}
:{{text|yell|Drill Sergeant Telice|Listen up! You lose, you haul metal to the forge! Now fight!}}

Cut northeast to reach the [[Unfallen's Sanctum]] and find [[Secutor Mevix]] with a group of [[Chosen Vanguard]]s:
:What is it, recruit?
:{{gossip|I have orders from Baron Vyraz.}}
:{{text|yell|Secutor Mevix|New orders! We march to the west! Move out!}}
:''Mevix and the Vanguards march a short distance to the west before despawning.''

;Description
Communication is key in times of strife. We must ensure our orders are disseminated quickly and effectively.

I have orders that need to reach the hands of three officers: Summoner Perex, Drill Sergeant Telice, and Secutor Mevix.

Now move. Every moment we waste is one our enemy will have to their advantage!

;Completion
That should ensure we are not vulnerable.
