==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|yell|Alexandros Mograine|Vyraz! Show yourself!}}
:{{text|whisper|Voice of the Primus|The relentless pursuit of victory.}}

Players are granted a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Claim Rune|Claim the final rune.|id=331450|icon=70_inscription_vantus_rune_azure|notes=Instant.}}

Use the ability and a brief cutscene plays of the player brandishing the [[Blade of the Primus]] and activating its final rune. On the other side of the cutscene, Vyraz appears and walks out of the citadel.
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|So the mortal returns, along with our wayward baron. The constructs failed to finish you, and so did the Maw. How disappointing.}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|Your schemes have brought about your own ruin. Now we will end you!}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Foolish Mograine, always valuing loyalty over might. But victory lies in one's choice of allies. And with their help, I now claim the mantle of margrave!}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|I will bury my blade in your skull, traitor! For Krexus!}}

Aggro Vyraz and Mograine will tank him.
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Ah, you completed the runeblade! Then I will take it from your corpse!}}

During the battle, Vyraz will summon [[Vicious Warbanner]]s, [[Bladesworn Traitor]]s, and [[Bladesworn Enchanter]]s. Take out the Bladesworn, stand near the Warbanners to increase your damage and keep focusing on Vyraz: 
:{{text|yell|Baron Vyraz|I bested Krexus himself! You two are nothing!}}
:{{text|yell|Alexandros Mograine|We will avenge him here and now!}}

At 95%:
:{{text|yell|Alexandros Mograine|You cannot win, Vyraz! You are outnumbered!}}
:{{text|yell|Baron Vyraz|Fool! All the houses of Maldraxxus stand against you!}}

At 90%, Vyraz pops a shield and goes immune as a large amount of unattackable Bladesworn Traitors and an [[Unfallen Warhound]] run in.
:{{text|yell|Baron Vyraz|Enough games! Guards! Slaugther these weaklings!}}
:{{text|yell|Alexandros Mograine|Honorless coward!}}

[[Draka|Baroness Draka]] swoops in on a [[flayedwing]] and carries the player back to the [[Bleak Redoubt]]. Alexandros follows on his own flayedwing.
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Ashbringer! Maw Walker! With me!}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|The Seat of the Primus is under siege! We must defend it!}}

When the player and Draka arrive, the Bleak Redoubt is engulfed in battle. Most of the normal NPCs are gone. Instead, a number of NPCs the player has encountered throughout the Maldraxxus storyline are holding off rapidly respawning waves of enemies in groups:
{{Col-begin}}
{{Col|2}}
*[[Aspirant Thales]], [[Kou]], and [[Koa]]
*[[Chosen Defender]]s
*[[Deathfang]] and the [[Soulfused Construct]]
*[[Hipokos]]
*[[Plague Deviser Marileth]], [[Kevin]], and [[Plaguey]]
*[[Khaliiq]]
*[[Secutor Mevix]]
{{Col|2}}
*[[Bladesworn Traitor]]s
*[[Construct Soldier]]s
*[[Rotwing Construct]]s
*[[Screeching Flayedwing]]s
*[[Wretched Deathroc]]s
{{Col-end}}

Draka, [[Bonesmith Heirmir|Heirmir]], and [[Vashj]] are holding off waves of Bladesworn Traitors and Construct Soldiers at the top of the stairs to the [[Sanctum Door]]. Talk with Draka to turn in.

;Description
Vyraz is the one who tricked me into the [[Maw]]. He had been meeting with one of the members of the [[House of Rituals]] prior to my entrapment. He must have received the trap from them.

By sending you after me, he no doubt wished for your death as well.

Vyraz is no ally of yours or [[Draka|Baroness Draka]]. Speak with me, and we will challenge him together.

;Notes
;Speaking with Mograine
:Vyraz will answer for his crimes.
:Let me know when you are prepared to face him.
{{gossip|I am ready.}}
