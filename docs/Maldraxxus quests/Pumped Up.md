==Objectives==
Collect 15 Salvaged Gear by using the Sludge Pump near bubbling sludge.
* [[Salvaged Gear]] (15)
* [[Sludge Pump]] (provided)

==Description==
When this [[necropolis]] collapsed, plenty of its parts got submerged in the riverbed flowing just outside. I hope you're really dedicated to fixing this place, because we're gonna dredge those parts back up!

Take this pump. If you find any places bubbling in that sludge, that's a good sign parts will be there!

Just be careful with whatever you pull up! You could face some resistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
*3x [[Grateful Offering]]

And one from potential rewards:
*[[Corpsehide Breeches]]
*[[Gorewrought Shank]]
*X Anima items (35)

==Progress==
Have you recovered anything useful?

==Completion==
You love to see it!

==Notes==
Placing the Sludge Pump on a [[Bubbling Sludge]] spawns two-three [[Irritated Sludge]]s that drop [[:Salvaged Gear]] on the ground to loot the following items: [[Portable Spy Kit]], [[Runic Fastener]], [[Sealed Scrolls]], [[Specialized Gutting Knife]], [[Mysterious Hooks]], [[Sludge-Camouflaged Pants]], [[Sludge-Covered Belt]] and [[Vanishing Ink]] that count toward the Salvage Gear criterion.
