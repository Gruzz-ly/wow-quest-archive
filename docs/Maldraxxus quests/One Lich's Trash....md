==Description==
It is said that one person's trash, is another's treasure. When it comes to relics, the adage is particularly true.

The [[House of Rituals]] is notoriously secretive, which means any knowledge we can glean from them will be all the sweeter.

If we sift through their detritus, I'm sure there are all sorts of treasures we will find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

;Description
It is said that "One person's trash, is another's treasure" and when it comes to relics this is particularly true.

The [[House of Rituals]] is particularly silent of their own affairs, which means anything we can learn about them will be all the more sweet to discover.

You have been there before, yes? If we could look amongst their scraps, I'm sure there are all sorts of treasures we can find.

;Rewards
10x [[Malleable Flesh]]
