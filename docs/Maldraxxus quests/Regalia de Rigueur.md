==Objectives==
Collect 10 Amethystine Powder from the [[House of Rituals]].
* [[Amethystine Powder]] (10)

==Description==
Ah, if it isn't [[Kel'Thuzad]]'s favorite [[acolyte]]? I simply cannot understand how a baron like him would surround himself with such... homely company.

When was the last time you even chanced at a looking glass? Those faded robes do your station no justice.

I would take it upon myself to update your drab apparel, if I weren't sufferring such a shortage on the house's preferred amethystine tint.

You could always fetch some yourself. The sorcerers usually have some stashed among their tomes and altars.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Amethystine Dye]]
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 11,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will need large quantities of amethystine powder if I am to fix...

<Moret gestures at you broadly.>

...this.

==Completion==
It brings me great relief that your pallid vestments will no longer offend my vision.

Do try keep them in better repair henceforth.

==Notes==
In the area for [[Heart of the Forest (quest)]], [[Cage Free Spores]], Moret the Vogue offers this quest. The objects are small and blend in, but look on bookshelves, on altars, and near big cauldrons, including inside the two buildings at either end of the quest area. One powder is guarded by [[Ru'i]] and two [[Enchanted Oculus]]es, so watch out for that one.

After completing this quest, Moret has some extra gossip:
:As an added reward for your assistance, you are welcome to make use of my styling mannequin. 
:It will allow you to further customize your attire, although you will need to acquire further accessories yourself.

The [[Mannequin]] next to her now provides options:
:This mannequin is used by Moret the Vogue to model new regalia for the acolytes of the House of Rituals.
:You can use it to alter the appearance of your Necrotic Acolyte disguise.
