==Objectives==
Search for survivors near the [[House of Plagues]].

==Description==
The [[House of Plagues]] was the first to fall in this conflict. We believed its demise was the result of a careless accident. If only we had known the truth sooner...

But perhaps not all their knowledge was lost. Before you arrived, our scouts reported signs of movement near the wreckage of their necropolis.

If any survivors remain, we'd be wise to add them to our ranks. But approach with caution. The toxic fallout may have left them mad... or worse.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|43|35}}
* 910 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My apprentice! I have been searching everywhere for you!
