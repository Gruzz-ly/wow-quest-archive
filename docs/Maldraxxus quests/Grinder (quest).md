==Objectives==
Collect 12 Sharpening Stones and 3 Bonesheared Grinders.
*Recruit [[Guillotine]]
*[[Chosen Razorstone]] (12)
*[[Bonesheared Grinder]] collected (3)
*[[Call Guillotine]] (provided)

==Description==
It's tough keeping these hands of mine razor sharp. With all the hacking and cleaving, they can grow dull so quickly. What's a girl to do?

The [[House of the Chosen]] makes some very fine quality sharpening stones. I doubt they will just hand them over, but I'm sure my blades can persuade them otherwise.

How about we pay them a visit and see how many stones they can spare?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,450 [[XP]]
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

==Progress==
Did you kill them all?

==Completion==
I see Guillotine's "negotiations" were successful.

Thank you, Maw Walker. These sharpening stones will be useful.
