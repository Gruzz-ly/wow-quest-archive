==Description==
Hey, its my good pal <name>! Listen, I'm in a bit of a bind here. I've been trying to negotiate a deal with the [[broker]] [[Au'larrynar]] and he needs a little something, a job done before he'll accept.

The deal is he had an associate who went missing with a rare item. He's asked that I... we... locate and return the missing property.

The associate was last seen in Ardenweald. I know, strange place, way too bright for me. But, I... we... really need this deal to go through!

So, You ready to go?

* 9,450 [[XP]]

Let him know I'll count this toward the repayment of his debts.

;Speaking with Tabithia
:Just... leave me alone.

:{{Gossip|I was told you have something for Au'larrynar...}}
::I guess you're here to collect for that Broker, huh?

::You're too late, a damned gorm ate it. 

::{{Gossip|A gorm ate it?}}

:::Yeah, a huge one! It crawled out of the ground right under my furniture. I guess the egg must have some sort of scent because the Gorm ignored everything else, it just grabbed the egg and swallowed it.

:::Unless you have an extremely keen sense of smell, good luck ever finding the thing. You might as well let the Broker know that his precious bauble is gone. 

:::Now, if you will excuse me, I have to get back to wallowing in my misery.

:{{Text|say|Atticus|I've just the item that could help. Check my inventory.}}

After using Nidore Ocularis, follow the green glow to find [[Izik the Dissolver]]. Kill it for the Egg.

After retrieving the egg, Tabithia has new gossip:
:You were able to find it?
:Well, good for you.

:Know what? You deserve something...

:<Tabithia makes an exaggeratedly slow, single clap.>

:There, now go away! I'm kind of busy here, you know... in the wreckage of my house.
