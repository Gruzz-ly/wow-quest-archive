On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|The trap is set, <name>. Lure the lich to his demise.}}

Interact with the Ritual Focus in the center again, and a cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|The trap is set. Now we lure Mor'Bitan to his doom.}}
:''Vashj summons a crystal in her hands and uses it to mimic [[Mephiles the Loyal]]'s voice.''
:{{text|say|Mephiles the Loyal|Master, our preparations are complete. We await your arrival.}}
:''Mor'Bitan teleports in next to the obelisk and attempts to start the ritual.''
:{{text|say|Mor'Bitan|Finally! The power our new baron promised shall now--}}
:''The three crystals around the obelisk break, disrupting the ritual.''
:{{text|say|Mor'Bitan|No! The ritual... it is ruined!}}
:{{text|say|Mor'Bitan|Mephiles! You incompetent fool!}}
:''Vashj and the player walk up toward the lich.''
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|It is you who are the fool, Mor'Bitan.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|And your folly has brought your demise.}}
:{{text|say|Mor'Bitan|Wretched spy! Curse you and [[House of Eyes|your fallen house]]!}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|For Akarek!}}

On the other side, [[Mor'Bitan]] stands at the obelisk at 70% health. Attack him:
:{{text|say|Mor'Bitan|Insects! You will fall, just like your margrave!}}

Vashj assists in the fight with her bow. Defeat the lich:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Be'lemer an-delei! Such is the price for your treachery!}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|But... what power still lingers in the air?}}

The [[Rune of Guile]] is left behind. Interact with it, and the same showing the held-overhead item cutscene plays:
:{{text|whisper|Voice of the Primus|The guile to outwit your opponents.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|[[Blade of the Primus|That runeblade]]... it is of the [[Primus]]'s make...}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|This... changes things. Perhaps [[Draka]] holds some small hope of victory.}}
