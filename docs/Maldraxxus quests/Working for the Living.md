* [[Broker Portal]] used
*[[Shattered Grove]] secured
* [[Khogov the Expunger]] captured

==Description==
I see you are wondering where we acquire all of the challengers we supply to this arena.

We scour countless realms in search of opponents to provide the [[Maldraxxus|Maldraxxi]] with firsthand combat experience.

Currently, I am in the process of procuring a new combatant--and with it, a lucrative betting opportunity.

Would you make use of our portal and assist [[Zo'umlo]] in capturing Khogov the Expunger? You will be appropriately compensated, of course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|50|40}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
Have you successfully captured Khogov the Expunger?

==Completion==
Competing in the arena is but one way to contribute to this venture. There are many other tasks to perform, as well. 

==Notes==
*To fill up the bar, kill [[Scrounging Animite]]s (5%), [[Anima-Gorged Feaster]]s (5%), [[Dread Glutton]], and [[Harrowing Glutton]]. [[Broker Cagetrap]]s (7%) can be placed as well.

;Description
I see you wondering, where do all these challengers for the arena come from?

I scour the [[Great Dark Beyond|known cosmos]] in search of opponents, that allow the Maldraxxi, to gain first hand combat experience.

I am making an arrangement right now to acquire a new opponent, and with it a lucrative betting opportunity. Would you use our [[Broker]] [[Portal]] and assist Jumlo in capturing Khogov The Expunger?
