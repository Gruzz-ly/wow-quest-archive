==Objectives==
Jump from [[Sepulcher of Knowledge|the tower]].
* Jump from the tower
* [[Volume of Victory: Vol 1]]

==Description==
Let us ponder the meaning of [[The Archivist (Maldraxxus)|the Archivist]]'s last words: "Victory only belongs to those brave enough to fall."

Hmm. It could be reference to the [[Volume of Victory]]. That is the most well-known of all the writings said to be kept in this tower.

That book is priceless, <name>. I mean that almost literally. We must do whatever is necessary to find it!

But, uh... What do you suppose "brave enough to fall" refers to?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Corpse-Stitcher's Slippers
|Deceitful Agent's Treads
|Flesh Architect's Galoshes
|Cruel Executioner's Stompers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|36|50|40}}
* 12,500 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
You have it?

==Completion==
This is it... the Volume of Victory! The single most important compendium of [[Maldraxxus]] military history ever assembled.

It must be mine! Uh, ours. I mean ours!

==Notes==

[[File:Volumes of Victory- Vol 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Volumes of Victory: Vol 1]]
Run out on the tower's balcony and jump off. A large rune is floating in mid-air halfway between the balcony and the ground. Upon falling through the rune, the player is transported with Ta'eran to an underground chamber where [[Volumes of Victory: Vol 1]] is floating next to a [[Library Teleporter]].
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|There it is--The Volume of Victory! Won't you do the honors, <name>? In case it's a deadly trap or something.}}

Loot [[Volume of Victory: Vol 1]] and then turn in to the broker.

;Description
What was the meaning of her last words?

"Victory only belongs to those brave enough to fail"

She must have been speaking of the Volume of Victory. We must find it!

What does she mean by fail?
