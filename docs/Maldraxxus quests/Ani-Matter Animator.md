==Objectives==
Recruit 15 animates.
* Animates Recruited (15)
* [[Ani-Matter Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
This area is rich with the remains of fallen [[soldier]]s... some of which still carry a spark of potential.

I've created what I call the "Ani-Matter Orb," with which you can reanimate the skeletal matter littered throughout the foundry.

Let us see how many of the new animates would join our cause.

As for those who don't... well, they should be quite accustomed to being slain by now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
*+20 [[reputation]] with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
Do we have enough animates?

==Completion==
These reanimated troops will be put to good use.

==Notes==
Use the quest item on [[Bone Remains]] and dead [[Ossein Boneshaper]]s that has a chance to summon hostile or friendly animates. Speak with the friendly ones to recruit them.

==Progression==
...

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
During development, the quest was named '''The Aetherlife'''.

;Description
This area is rich with forgotten bone ready to be shaped into structures and vehicles. Some of this bone has a nature to take on animated forms, suitable for combat troops. I've created the Aetherlife orb so you can animate bone remains into troops. Some will become violent, most will be usable fodder, but occasionally there is greatness in the bone and it becomes more! Use the orb on bone remains and slain violent animates
