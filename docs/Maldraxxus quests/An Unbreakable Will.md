==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Theater of Pain]] in [[Maldraxxus]].

==Description==
We're clearly dealing with someone who is using terrible [[magic]] to suspend his own [[death]].

There's another force we know of that uses magic in this fashion. The [[Maldraxxi]] are intimately familiar with the trappings of death, and equally familiar with how to subvert it. Perhaps one of the Houses knows of a way to help us.

Go there, and seek out power that can break this unnatural loop.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
We're not in Quel'Thalas anymore.

Let's get what we need as quickly as we can--we've got no time to waste!
