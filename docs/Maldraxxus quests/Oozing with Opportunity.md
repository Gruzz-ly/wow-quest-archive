==Description==
They called me mad! As a matter of fact, they still do!

Ah, but none of them have the mental acuity of Doctor [[James Mortimus]] of the very much in-tact [[House of Plagues]], nor his handsome smile! Fools!

With the catalyst you have so kindly provided, dear...whatever you are...certainly not a [[kyrian]]...

I digress!

We shall get to whatever it is you wanted in a moment, for now is the time of SCIENCE! Come, come, let me show you the wondrous fruits of my labors!

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{Abilities|Trial: Mad Mortimer|id=336655|icon=achievement_dungeon_thenecroticwake_stitchflesh}}

You will receive:
* {{cost|6|17|50}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What are we doing not doing science right now?!

==Completion==
It appears you were successful. Well done, as always.

:{{Text|say|Ortim|I'm--we're--all me? We're all me!}}
:{{Text|say|Imer|No time like the present, <name>. Use that mirror of yours and let's get this over with!}}

:{{Text|say|Ortim|Best of luck with your arena or whatever it is you were going on about.}}
