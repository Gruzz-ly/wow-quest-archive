==Description==
Gaining entrance to the [[Sepulcher of Knowledge|Sepulcher]] is no easy feat, <name>!

Not only were guardians put in place, but an elaborate magical lock was created to seal the door.

To open the way, the two obelisks which control the lock must be fed anima. Fortunately, there are some empowered crystals in the area we can use for this purpose.

Locate the focus crystals and redirect their anima flow into the obelisks. Then the secrets of the Sepulcher will soon be ours!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|50|40}}
* 12,500 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
Have you activated the two obelisks?

==Completion==
You have done it! The door is unlocked!

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|Careful alignment of the crystals and the anima flow will unlock the door!}}

Find the western and eastern [[Power Crystal (Maldraxxus)|Power Crystals]] and approach them to automatically activate their anima streams, then click on them and the various [[Activated Necrocrystal]]s as many times as is required to redirect the anima flow into the two [[Unlocking Obelisk]]s and open the Library Door.

There is anima flowing in the focus crystals again!

We need to activate the two Unlocking Obelisks, but to do this we must feed anima into them.

Locate the focus crystals and redirect the anima beams to connect with these two Obelisks here.
