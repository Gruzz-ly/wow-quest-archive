==Objectives==
Collect information on the [[kyrian]] from the [[Temple of Humility]].
*[[Scroll of the Path]] (8)
*[[The Roles of Kyrian and Their Importance to the Shadowlands: Volume 1]]
*[[Call Professor]] (provided)

==Description==
The kyrian are known for their collections of scrolls and writings. I'm particularly interested in their texts regarding those who have joined their ranks.

Why is it that some of the greatest fighters are sent to [[Bastion]] and not to [[Maldraxxus]]?

Perhaps research can divine the answer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

==Progress==
Let's see, where did that paper go?

==Completion==
This will be very helpful. It's a shame so many people aren't willing to share their knowledge. Hoarding it is simply foolish.
