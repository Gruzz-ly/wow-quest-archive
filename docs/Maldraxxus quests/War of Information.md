==Description==
Ah, the anointment oil. I had expected one of [[Polemarch Adrestes|Adrestes]]' recruits.

No matter. You seek my [[memory]] for your trials, yes? I am afraid mere oil will not suffice.

With our house gone, we are left to fend for ourselves. Though this tower offers some protection, we are left cornered to any who may desire our end.

Information is the key to survival. Use my anointed talisman to give me eyes across all the realms...even in Bastion. Follow the list precisely--no questions.

Then can we resolve payment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
There will be no negotiation in this matter.

==Completion==
Already my vision grows. The pact is sealed.
