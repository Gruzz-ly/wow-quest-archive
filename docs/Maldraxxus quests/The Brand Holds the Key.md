==Objectives==
Find the key to free Darion.
* Find "[[Brethlun the Brand|the Brand]]" and [[The Brand's Key|Claim the Key]] {{co|35.8|44.9|Maw}}
* Free [[Darion Mograine]] {{co|38.4|48.5|Maw}}

==Description==
<Darion is unresponsive. The cage is locked, and doesn't appear easily broken.

Perhaps the holder of the key is this "Brand" he mentioned.>

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
* {{cost|24|57}}
* 9,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are you willing to listen to my proposition?

==Completion==
My, my. Today certainly has been full of surprises!

Now, mortal, I'm curious what has brought you back to the Maw.

==Notes==
Loop clockwise to the northwest and head up the stairs to find [[Brethlun the Brand]]. Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Brethlun the Brand|You will fall, and I will claim another weapon for my collection.}}

Defeat him, loot the key, then return to Darion's cage and free him:
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|My thanks, <name>. Now that I am free, I should soon regain my strength.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|How long have I been trapped in the Maw? A day? An eternity?}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|Careful. [[The Jailer]]'s eyes are everywhere.}}
:''Darion walks outside. Suddenly, a [[Mawsworn Myrmidon]] lands in front of him.''
:{{Text|yell|Mawsworn Myrmidon|You will never escape the Maw!}}
:''Moments later, Darion, the player, and the Myrmidon are stunned for a few seconds as a [[broker]] swoops in.''
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Ah, I was curious what the [[Mawsworn]] were searching for. You are that mortal who swept through and thwarted the Jailer's festivities.}}
:''The Myrmidon disintegrates. Darion and the player are freed.''
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I am Ve'nari, a humble broker trapped in this land of torment. I have a proposition for you. Come!}}
:''Ve'nari and Darion walk to the west.''
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|Why would you aid us, broker?}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Your presence here draws attention. The sort of attention that's bad for my business dealings. No offense, of course.}}

Talk to Ve'nari to turn in.
