==Objectives==
Return to [[Draka|Baroness Draka]] with your runeblade.

==Description==
It's been some time since I had a chance to craft a weapon that powerful! Good to know that the skills I learned from the [[Primus]] haven't dulled.

You'd best get back to the baroness with that runeblade. I'm sure [[Margrave Krexus|the margrave]] will want to know you wield it, as well.

The Primus was notorious for thinking ten paces ahead of everyone else. I suspect he knew that someone like you would take up that blade.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|43|35}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You wield a fine weapon. Now you must put it to use.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|I've forged you a weapon without equal. You break that blade, and I'll break you.}}

Approach Draka:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|I take it Heirmir had much to say.}}

==Progression==
{{House of the Chosen}}

==Beta version==

;Description
Hah! That's a tricky blade if I've ever known one! But now you wield a sword that could cleave the whole house in two.

You'd best get back to the baroness with that. I'm sure she'll be surprised as I was to see you wielding that weapon.

Who knows? Maybe the [[Primus]] was waiting for the likes of you to arrive here. He always did think a few paces forward.

;Completion
You wield a fine weapon. I'm eager to see how you use it.
