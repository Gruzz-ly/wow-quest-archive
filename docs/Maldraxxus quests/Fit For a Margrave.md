Nearby, two [[Anima Catalyst]]s light up. Interact with them to cause them to start launching bolts of [[anima]] at the [[Potion Chamber]], then interact with the chamber. You are then stunned for 50 seconds as a blue-green haze covers the screen and [[Margrave Stradama]] and two [[Plaguefall Ward]]s rise out of the slime in front of the platform.

The [[Rune of Insight]] is now hovering over the Potion Chamber. Interact with it to pick it up and play another cutscene of brandishing the [[Blade of the Primus]].
