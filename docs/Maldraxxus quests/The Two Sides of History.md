You [[mortal]]s always say history is written by the victors. But in the [[Shadowlands]], I have found that to be untrue.

Everyone has their own version of events. I would like to know them all.

There was an author of history books who made her abode in [[Revendreth]]'s [[Darkwall Tower|Darkfall Tower]]{{sic}}. She wrote from the [[venthyr]]'s perspective of various incursions and battles alongside the [[Primus]]. 

If we could find copies of her works...

You [[Azeroth]]ians always say "history is written by the victors" but in the [[Shadowlands]], I have found that to be untrue.

Everyone has their own version of events. I would like to know them all. You can travel to [[Revendreth]] correct? There was an author of history books there, in a place called [[Darkfall Tower]]. She wrote from the [[Venthyr]]'s perspective of various incursions and battles alongside the [[Primus]]. If we could find copies of her works...

At the very least we can check?
