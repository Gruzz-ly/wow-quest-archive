==Objectives==
Read the rune stones of the five houses, then honor them by performing the correct /emote at each stone.

* [[Echo of the Spy]] slain /sneak
* [[Echo of the Chemist]] slain /bleed
* [[Echo of the Magus]] slain /kneel
* [[Echo of the Crafter]] slain /flex

==Description==
The [[Primus]] placed guardians in the area around the [[Sepulcher of Knowledge|Sepulcher]] to protect the knowledge within. Each embodied the virtues of one of the five houses.

To gain entrance, you must prove yourself worthy by besting these protectors.

Seek out the rune stones that represent the houses of [[Maldraxxus]]. Pay attention to the words inscribed on each stone, then pay deference each house's values.

If you honor the stone, its protector will come forth. Defeat each of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Signet of the Learned]]
* {{cost|36|50|40}}
* 12,500 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
The Primus was clever indeed.

==Completion==
Now that those guardians are dispatched, we can focus on unlocking the door.

==Notes==
Five runestones are scattered around the valley. At each one, the player needs to perform a specific emote mentioned in the stone's inscription in order to summon the corresponding echo.
