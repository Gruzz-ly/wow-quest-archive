==Objectives==
Rally 8 demoralized soldiers.
* [[Hesitant Soldier]]s rallied (8)
* [[Attack Battlehorn]] (provided)
*Meet up with Secutor Mevix.

==Description==
When it comes to warfare, strength of will is as critical as strength of arms. A demoralized [[soldier]] is a defeated soldier!

We have the numbers to overwhelm the [[House of Constructs|constructs]] with a full scale assault, but only if our forces are fully committed to the charge. Some may fall, but their sacrifice will secure our victory!

Take this battle horn and rally our troops. Remind them of their duty to the [[House of the Chosen|Chosen]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you rallied the troops?

==Completion==
Our forces stand ready to fight once more!

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Mevix! Wreak havoc on those cowards!}}
:{{text|say|[[Secutor Mevix]]|We'll blast them to pieces!}}

Look for [[Hesitant Soldier]]s and [[Demoralized Soldier]]s and use the [[Extra Action Button]] that appears when you approach them: {{Abilities|Signal To Advance|id=329690|Signal troops to press the attack.|icon=inv_misc_horn_05}}

;Description
This is my battlefield, and want it cleared right now!

We have enough [[soldier]]s that we can overwhelm the constructs with a frontal assault! We'll swarm their defenses, if some of us die, the rest will break through!

Get out there and use my battle horn to motivate any troops that seem hesitant to attack!

;Completion
The forces you've rallied are ready to help with a strike against the commander.
