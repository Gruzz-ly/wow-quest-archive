==Objectives==
Follow Ta'eran to the [[Sepulcher of Knowledge]] and hear his proposal.
* Listen to [[Ta'eran]]'s proposal.
*Meet Ta'eran in front of the Sepulcher of Knowledge.

==Description==
Ah, mortal, how fortunate that I, humble Ta'eran, happen to be standing here just as you, the outsider everyone is talking about, happens to wander by!

In the spirit of cooperation and mutual interests, there is a matter I wish to discuss.

A nearby structure called the Sepulcher of Knowledge was built as a repository for military strategy. I fear the knowledge contained within may soon be lost.

If you would do me the honor of escorting me to the Sepulcher, I can share what else I know.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|50|40}}
* 12,500 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Completion==
Mortal, are you ready to help me save these valuable writings?

==Notes==
;Speaking with Ta'eran
:I am most excited to meet you!

:{{Gossip|Tell me about this opportunity.}}

:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|Excellent. Walk with me, won't you?}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|The Sepulcher of Knowledge stores the writings of the greatest tactical minds who have ever served [[Maldraxxus]].}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|After the disappearance of the [[Primus]], the Sepulcher was magically sealed.}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|The remnants of this power have attracted [[devourer]]s, ravenous creatures who feed on the energies they find.}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|They are tearing at the foundations of the facility. Soon they will destroy the structure and everything within.}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|With your help, I could enter the Sepulcher and salvage key military knowledge before it is lost forever.}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|Rumor has it that once inside the tower, there are numerous traps to be avoided. I'm sure they will present no trouble to someone as skilled as you, though!}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|I fear time, as you mortals say, is of the essence. Let us hurry.}}
