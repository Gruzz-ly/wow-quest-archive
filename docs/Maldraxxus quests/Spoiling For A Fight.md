==Objectives==
Defeat Sabriel the Bonecleaver in the [[Theater of Pain]].
*[[Sabriel the Bonecleaver]] slain
*Suggested players [5]

==Description==
Your contribution of anima has aided our operation here greatly. Several of our more famous competitors have come here lured by the flow of new anima.

Would you like to test yourself versus the famous Sabriel? There could be much profit for everyone, if you were to defeat her.

I can add her to the schedule, she will appear soon if you defeat the other challengers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Your victory was expected.

==Notes==
*Requires the player to be a member of the [[Necrolord Covenant]], have an [[Anima Conductor]] upgraded to rank 3, and channeling anima to the [[Theater of Pain]].
*Sabriel is not immediately queued. You will first need to kill a few of the elite arena combatants before she will appear in place of [[Azmogal]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
