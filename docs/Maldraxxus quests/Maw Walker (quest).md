==Objectives==
Attune with Darion and Morgraine and assist them in leaving the Maw.
* Attune to [[Alexandros Mograine|Alexandros]] and [[Darion Mograine|Darion]] at [[Waystone to Oribos|the waygate]] {{co|42.4|42.1|Maw}}
* Escape the [[Maw]]

==Description==
I believe now it is time for you to leave.

You are a [[Maw Walker]], one who can activate the waystone between the Maw and the lands beyond. While your friends may not hold the same title, there is a way to send them through the gate.

[[Soul]]s can be connected. In theory, if you let someone attune themselves to your soul while you activate the waystone, you both should be able to leave. Even fleeting connections may produce some result.

Go with your other two guests and see if my hypothesis is correct.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Risen Journeyman's Visage
|Vicious Reclaimer's Cover
|Forgotten Pursuer's Cowl
|Fallen Protector's Headguard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|24|57|}}
* 7,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You return in one piece. And with not just Darion, but his father as well. You continue to succeed, Maw Walker.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Farewell. Please do not tell anyone you saw me. And if you find yourself leaping into this maelstrom of gloom again, I do hope you'll bring along something interesting to trade.}}

Head west back up the hill to [[Cocyrus]] and the [[Waystone to Oribos]]. Interact with the waystone to activate it, then interact with it again to teleport to the outer western part of Oribos. An [[Attendant Protector]] is present to witness your arrival.
:{{text|say|Attendant Protector|You return, and with others this time! That's astounding. No soul has ever returned once, let alone twice with allies! A Maw Walker indeed!}}

Escort the Mograines back to the [[Enclave]], where [[Draka|Baroness Draka]] is now standing next to Fordragon:
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|Highlord Fordragon! We have escaped the Maw. Thank you for your aid.}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|Draka! We must return to [[Maldraxxus]] at once. [[Margrave Krexus]]--}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Our margrave has been slain, Ashbringer. The [[House of the Chosen|Chosen]] need your blade, now more than ever.}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|No... then my warning comes too late! We have been betrayed by one of our own!}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|It was [[Vyraz]] who had me trapped within the Maw. There can be no doubt that it was his hand that struck down our margrave.}}
