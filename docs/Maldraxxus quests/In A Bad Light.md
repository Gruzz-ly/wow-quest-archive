==Objectives==
Use Roseboil's Regenerative Molt to cure 15 Light-Seared Exiles.
* Recruit [[Roseboil]] (Optional)
* [[Light-Seared Exile]] cured by Roseboil (15)
* [[Call Roseboil]] (provided)

==Description==
I've heard about the chaos in Revendreth. Reports of exiles driven mad and burned in the Desiccation.

The very thought of all that suffering fills me with the urge to do something about it.

If you are headed there, please let me accompany you. I simply must help as many as I can!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

==Progress==
Did we cure them all?

==Completion==
Suffering is commonplace among those in Revendreth, but you and Roseboil were able to help a few of them nonetheless.

Well done.
