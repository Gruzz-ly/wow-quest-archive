==Objectives==
Destroy the Southwestern, Northwestern, and Northeastern [[Astral Projector]]s.
* Southwestern projector destroyed {{co|24.9|37.4|Maldraxxus}}
* Northwestern projector destroyed {{co|25.5|33.1|Maldraxxus}}
* Northeastern projector destroyed {{co|27.9|33.0|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
My [[Spy|spies]] have identified several astral projectors that [[Margrave Gharmal]] uses to rally <his/their> troops in the [[Stitchyard]].

I do not wish for a swarm of frenzied constructs to descend upon us during the final confrontation. Surely you see the wisdom in cutting their fervor.

See to it that these projectors are destroyed. We believe them to be along the yard's perimeter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}

==Progress==
A blow inflicted to the enemy's morale can be as effective as traditional combat.

==Completion==
Gharmal's influence runs deep in this place, but it will fade more quickly thanks to your efforts. 

==Notes==
The three Astral Projectors are located on the southwestern, northwestern, and northeastern perimeters of the Stitchyard. Each one displays an image of Margrave Gharmal that says something on approach.

;Southwestern
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|[[Bastion]] was only the beginning. Soon all will be bound to our flesh!}}

;Northwestern
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|Our new allies have granted us power beyond imagining. [[Margrave Sin'dane|Sin'dane]]'s [[Kel'Thuzad|new baron]] spoke true!}}

;Northeastern
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|Our [[Bilebloat Juggernaut|kyrian juggernauts]] will vanquish all who dare oppose the House of Constructs!}}
