==Objectives==
Follow Ve'nari to [[Perdition Hold]].
* Speak with [[Ve'nari]] {{co|36.2|55.7|Maw}}
* Follow Ve'nari

==Description==
It's quite a thrill to have a mortal for a business partner! [[Amulet of the Horsemen|The amulet]] really is intriguing.

What's that? Oh yes, [[Alexandros Mograine|that baron]] you're searching for...

Well it so happens that I learned of a Maldraxxi warlord being held in the lower courtyard of [[Perdition Hold]]. As you might guess by the name, it's not the most charming of places.

I would prefer to avoid the attention of [[the Jailer]]'s forces. Fortunately, I have just the thing.

Give the word, and I will conceal us from the [[Mawsworn]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|57|}}
* 7,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My father... Alexandros Mograine. The Ashbringer.

I never expected to see him again.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I can conceal us long enough to find your wayward baron. Come along!}}

Speak with Ve'nari again:
:Let me know when you're ready and I'll activate the device. It won't cover us for long.
:{{gossip|Let's go.}}

Ve'nari activates Anima Shroud, creating a [[Shroud of Concealment]]-like area of effect around her that keeps Darion and the player in [[stealth (mechanic)|stealth]] as long as they remain within its circle.
:{{Abilities|Anima Shroud|id=325541|Hidden from most eyes by Ve'nari's magic.|icon=ability_mage_invisibility}}

Ve'nari and Darion start heading south across the [[Face of Oblivion]]. Follow them.
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Stay close. I do not wish to draw attention with a fight.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|How long have you been trapped here?}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Longer than you have, mortal. That is all you need to know.}}

Halfway through the trek, a [[Stygian Giant]] appears nearby.
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Hold!}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Wait for the beast to pass.}}

As soon as the giant has walked past the group, Ve'nari and Darion set off again.
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|The Mawsworn are certainly eager to find you. We need to make this quick.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|Do not rush us, broker. There are others who must be saved along with the Maldraxxi baron.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Ah, you speak of the mortals left behind [[Stand as One|when your friend here escaped]].}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I fear they've been taken to [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]], that tower looming in the distance. The Jailer keeps his most prized possessions within.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|Then show us a way to breach that tower!}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|It would be folly to go after them now. Remain focused. There will be time for theatrics later.}}

Ve'nari and Darion enter the lower courtyard of Perdition Hold. A familiar face is chained to the northern wall.
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|This must be your missing baron, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alexandros Mograine]]|Who... is there? Must... warn [[Margrave Krexus|the margrave]]...}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|I know that voice! Can it be? The baron is... my father?!}}
: ''Darion hurries forward and kneels by Alexandros.''
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|Darion! After all this time...}}

;Description
Maldraxxus is not known for sending [[soul]]s to the [[Maw]]. I can only think of one.

There is a Maldraxxi being held in the lower courtyard of Perdition Hold to the south.

I would rather avoid the attention of [[the Jailer]]'s forces. Stay near me, I will hide us from the [[mawsworn]]s' sights.
