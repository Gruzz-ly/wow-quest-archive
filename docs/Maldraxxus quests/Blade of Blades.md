==Objectives==
Find Foe Cleaver amongst the forgotten weapons.
* [[Forgotten Weapon]] (10)
* [[Foe Cleaver]]

==Description==
The finest sword in existence has been lost!

Never in your pitiful adventures have you encountered such a blade, mortal. Foe Cleaver was forged to strike down the titans themselves!

I have wielded it against countless adversaries. Emissaries of the [[Light]], minions of the [[Void]], meddlers from the [[Gardens of Life]]... all have fallen before me! Soon the very planes of reality will kneel to my greatness!

Once I find my weapon, that is.

I insist you help me reclaim it. I know it's here somewhere!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|10|20}}
*8,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found Foe Cleaver? Well? HAVE YOU?! 

==Completion==
Foe Cleaver! Now my crusade of conquest begins!

You... you act as if you've seen finer swords, mortal. How dare you!

Just you wait. You'll kneel before me just like all the rest!

<The animate mutters and grunts.>

Quest was named: '''One Thing, Not Like The Others'''

===Description===
I lost my sword!

It was just not any sword, it was my sword, "Foe Cleave!"

Forged by the [[Titan]]'s themselves! I had it when we stormed the breach of [[Light]], hundred's died to its edge!

You need to help me find it, it's got to be here somewhere!
