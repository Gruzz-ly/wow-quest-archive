==Objectives==
Deliver the potion to Scrapper Minoire.
* [[Necessary Enhancers]] purchased from Au'larrynar
* Deliver the Enhancers to [[Scrapper Minoire]]
*Consult with Overseer Kalvaros

==Description==
Scrapper Minoire's use of enhancers creates unpredictable betting implications. It is quite unhealthy... for our profits!

For a nominal fee, [[Au'larrynar]] can provide you with a "special" enhancer that Minoire will not be able to resist: a potion that turns the one who imbibes it into the ultimate combatant... and teaches them a lesson in restraint, as well.

I cannot wait to see Minoire's next match in the arena!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|43|35}}
* 910 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is an unexpected turn of events.

==Completion==
Scrapper Minoire will have to forfeit her spot in the contest.

==Notes==

;Description
Scrapper Minoire using enhancers creates unpredictable betting implications. This continual use is unhealthy for our profits!

Au'larrynar will sell you the Necessary Enhancer. A potion that turn its drinker into the ultimate combatant, and teaches them a lesson in restraint as well.

I can't wait to see Minoire's next performance in the Arena!
