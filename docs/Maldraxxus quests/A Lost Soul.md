==Objectives==
Bacilia the Lost slain.
* [[Bacilia The Lost]] slain

==Description==
Many of us struggled to free ourselves when [[Gharmal]] imprisoned our [[soul]]s here, but none more than Bacilia.

She was a great [[Champion (rank)|champion]], but the confinement drove her mad and darkness consumed her soul. Though we tried to reason with her over the course of eons, it is clear that there is no coming back for her.

Please end her misery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you completed this task?

==Completion==
I sense that her suffering has ended.

==Patch changes==
