==Objectives==
Collect 6 Bloated Venom Sacs.
*[[Bloated Venom Sac]] (6)

==Description==
[[Margrave Stradama]] eagerly awaits the completion of our latest potion!

However, I seem to have misplaced my stockpile of venom sacs. How embarrassing! I have felt a touch out of sorts lately...

Would you please do me a favor and fetch some more? We cannot continue our work without them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Now where did I put my venom sacs...

==Completion==
You found my venom sacs! What a helpful apprentice you are!

==Notes==
Pick up both quests, then head southwest into the [[Valley of a Thousand Legs]]. Kill the [[Virulent Pest]]s for their venom sacs, and interact with Stringy Spores, then run away from them to pull them out of the ground.

==Progression==
{{House of Plagues}}

==Beta version==

;Description
[[Margrave Stradama]] anticipates our potion, apprentice. We must complete it with haste!

Grant me a favor, my apprentice? I've felt out of sorts lately...

I swore I left my venom sacs in the cupboard with the other reagents, but I can't find them. Perhaps my scatterbrain scattered them all about!

Would you please fetch more? They will come in useful for our project, I assure you!

;Completion
My apprentice, you've found my venom sacs!
