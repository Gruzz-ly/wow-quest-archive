==Objectives==
Protect Darion while he frees Alexandros.
* Aid [[Alexandros Mograine|Alexandros]] {{co|32.9|66.4|Maw}}
* Area secured
* [[Deslan the Torturer]] slain {{co|33.8|67.4|Maw}}

==Description==
Since crossing into the [[Shadowlands]], I've been so focused on our mission that I never even considered the souls of my family being here somewhere.

Whatever this realm called [[Maldraxxus]] is, I hope it is worthy of my father's service!

We must free him, <name>. There is... much I need to say to him.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
* {{cost|24|57}}
* 9,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Every moment spent here tears at one's soul.

==Completion==
I cannot thank you enough, <name>.

==Notes==
Interact with Alexandros to free him, and [[Deslan the Torturer]] flies in at the other end of the courtyard:
:{{text|yell|Deslan the Torturer|Did you think your presence would go unnoticed? You will not leave this place!}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Trapped. Hmph. Well, go on then! Show us that vaunted might, mortal.}}

Defeat four [[Entropic Stygia]], after which Deslan flies over to fight you personally.
:{{Text|yell|Deslan the Torturer|Drown in terror!}}

Defeat her, then turn in to Darion.

==Progression==
{{Ritual for the Damned}}
