==Objectives==
Kill 15 bonefused forces.
*Bonefused forces slain (15)

==Description==
There's still a lot of us here, trying to survive in these ruins.

These constructs have been encroaching on us constantly. They steal what they can, and haul off any of us they capture to be recycled in their labs.

The solution here requires an extensive use of violence, by you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
*3x [[Grateful Offering]]

One from the potential rewards:
*[[Vial of Caustic Liquid (rare)]]
*X Anima item (35)
*{{Cost|295|66}} (replaces the base gold reward)

==Progress==
I still see a lot of abominations walking around.

==Completion==
You can kill more of them if you want.

==Notes==
The majority of mobs at [[Akarek's Tears]] counts toward the objective.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
