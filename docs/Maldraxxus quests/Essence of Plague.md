==Description==
Your [[Plague Eater|little friend]] there looks hungry! Not to worry, I know just what to feed it. Soon it will grow big and strong and be able to eat all the plague it can.

There are various concoctions nearby that will give it bolstering properties. And every color is a different flavor!

I will take the plague sample you brought me deeper into the House of Plagues, to see what else we can learn. Meet me there, and let your plague eater dine in style!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Every color is a different flavor!

==Completion==
Did you see that? What a fearsome plague sample you brought me!

It hit me in the head and quite nearly killed your friends, apprentice. Marvelous!
