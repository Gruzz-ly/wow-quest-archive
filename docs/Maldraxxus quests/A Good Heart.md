==Objectives==
Place a heart in [[Emeni]]s'{{Sic}} construct.
* Heart collected
* Heart placed in Emeni's construct.

==Description==
Despite the beliefs of most people, Emeni has a kind heart. Err...at least she will have one, once you give it to her!

I can think of no one better than you, [[Maw Walker]], to give Emeni a new heart. Perhaps this will warm her blood towards you. You might become friends or even [[soulbind]]s!

Please select and place a heart in Emeni's construct.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope you chose well!

==Completion==
You've done it, the construct is completed. The Slaughter Daughter lives again!

==Notes==
[[File:A Good Heart.jpg|thumb|Emeni and the powered-up Construct]]
Three hearts are hanging on chains behind Rathan: a [[Kind Heart]], a [[Strong Heart]], and a [[Ruthless Heart]]. The choice of heart has no effect on the rest of the questline, so pick whichever one you prefer. Regardless of your choice, Emeni says the following when you pick it up:
:{{Text|say|Emeni|We will be powerful allies, Maw Walker. But not friends. I do not have "friends".}}

Carry the organ over to the Construct body, which is now surrounded by energy.
:{{Abilities|Carry Heart|id=318066|You are carrying a heart, large enough for use in the body of a construct.|icon=inv_misc_organ_01}}

Upon getting close enough, you automatically toss the heart at the Construct. Turn in to Rathan. On completion, Emeni's soul enters the construct, transforming her into an [[abomination]], now with the title of <The Slaughter Daughter>.
:{{Text|say|Emeni|You are speaking to a princess!}}

She quickly shuffles over to you and offers the next two quests, [[The Slaughter Daughter]] and [[Bottled Up Inside]]. The [[Curious Soul]]s around the area chime in with comments about Emeni's return:
*{{Text|say|Curious Soul|Emeni, back in a construct? Someone's going to die!}}
*{{Text|say|Curious Soul|Emeni is back!}}
*{{Text|say|Curious Soul|I can't believe Emeni is back!}}
*{{Text|say|Curious Soul|[[Margrave Gharmal|The Margrave]] is in trouble!}}

==Progression==
{{Soul Survivors}}
