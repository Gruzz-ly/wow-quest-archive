==Objectives==
15 Warstitched forces slain.
* Warstitched forces slain (15)
*Meet up with Secutor Mevix.

==Description==
[[Baron Vyraz|Vyraz's]] assault on the [[House of Constructs]] may have failed, but we can still make them bleed now that we're inside.

Slaughter as many as you can. I will hunt down the masterminds behind these new production efforts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Every foe we slay here is one we won't have to face on the battlefield.

==Completion==
Complacency is every soldier's worst enemy. No one is safe in times of war, not even within the walls of their own fortress.

==Notes==
On accept of both of Mevix's quests:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|This reeks of [[Surgeon Stitchflesh|Stitchflesh]]'s handiwork. Create a distraction while I hunt down his disciples!}}
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|Are all Maldraxxi so bloodthirsty?}}

Pick up [[A Burden Worth Bearing]] from [[Aspirant Thales]] before getting started.

Kill [[Warstitched Surgeon]]s, [[Warstitched Guard]]s, [[Warstitched Salvager]]s, and [[Warstitched Hound]]s, but not [[Soulless Construct]]s to advance the quest.

==Progression==
{{House of Constructs}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Description
Vyraz's plan to seize the House of Constructs won't be happening today, but we're inside and we're going to cause some damage.

Take out as many of their guards as you can, while I find out what they're really doing here.

;Progress
Every soldier we kill here is one less soldier on the battlefield later.

;Completion
Every soldier understands their life is on the line at any given moment. Only the foolish grow complacent, and this land does not allow them to continue.
