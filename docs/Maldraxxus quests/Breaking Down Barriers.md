[[File:Salvaged Praetor.jpg|thumb|upright|The Salvaged Praetor]]
[[File:Shielding Lattice.jpg|thumb|upright|The Shielding Lattice]]

* Speak with [[Aspirant Thales|Thales]] {{co|30.1|24.0|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Salvaged Praetor]] directed {{co|30.0|23.9|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Spewer Valve|Bile Spewer]] disabled (4)
* [[Shielding Lattice]] disabled {{co|29.3|23.0|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
As I suspected, [[Surgeon Stitchflesh|Stitchflesh's]] assistants are carrying on his work. Whatever they're building, we need to destroy it.

They've secured the chamber with a soul barrier and several bile spewers. We must find a way through!

Thales said he may have a suggestion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|16|80}}
* 3,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is the barrier down?

==Completion==
It seems these kyrian are more stalwart than I expected. Let us avenge their fallen kin.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Secutor Mevix|We need a way through. Thales?}}

Speak with Thales:
:We need to escape and inform the Archon of what we have seen here.
:{{gossip|How would you breach the barrier?}}
:[[Hipokos]] found and repaired a [[Centurion#Praetor|praetor]] among the fallen [[kyrian]]. Since it does not possess a [[soul]], it should be able to pass through the barrier.
:With your guidance, you can use it to shut down the defenses and clear the way for us.

Speak with the [[Salvaged Praetor]]:
:How may I be of assistance?
:{{gossip|I need you to follow my directions.}}

Now in the [[vehicle]] interface, players have one ability:
:{{Abilities|Impervious|Protects the Praetor from hazardous environmental damage.|cd=5 sec|icon=ability_warrior_shieldmastery|id=331036|notes=Instant. 3 sec duration}}

Walk through the barrier and interact with the first Spewer Valve. The second is on the far side of the glowing goop, so use '''Impervious''' to get through it. In the meantime, [[First Apprentice Malkrex]] and [[Sharrex the Fleshcrafter]] are having a conversation about the [[Soulfused Construct]] at the end of the corridor:
:{{text|say|First Apprentice Malkrex|When Stitchflesh returns he will know that I, Malkrex, have completed his research. Forging kyrian flesh into the ultimate construct!}}
:{{text|say|Sharrex the Fleshcrafter|He will also notice that you failed to purge the flesh of its memories before assembly!}}
:{{text|say|First Apprentice Malkrex|Nonsense! Once we embed a Maldraxxian soul, it will squelch any remaining echoes of [[Bastion]] brainwashing!}}
:{{text|say|Sharrex the Fleshcrafter|Uh... I just saw it move! Those kyrian parts are fighting to take control of the construct!}}
:{{text|say|First Apprentice Malkrex|Well, uh, there are many complicated factors that go into successful flesh preparation. Perhaps I needed a touch more--}}
:{{text|say|Sharrex the Fleshcrafter|Ah-HAH! So you DID botch the procedure!}}

Two more glowing streams of goop, and the last two Spewer Valves are downstairs off to the right. Once the valves are closed, cross to the left and interact with the Shielding Lattice. The screen fades to black and the player is automatically transported back to Mevix and the others, where the Soul Barrier is now gone.

==Progression==

;Description
I don't see [[Surgeon Stitchflesh|Stitchflesh]], but his two assistants are in there. They're building something, and my instincts says{{sic}} we need to stop it.

They've secured the chamber with a [[soul]] barrier and those bile spewers. We need to find a way to get past!

Perhaps you should speak with the [[kyrian]], he may have an idea.

;Completion
These survivors may be able to help us after all. Let's see now if we can help them.

;Speaking with Thales
{{gossip|How would you breach the barrier?}}
:I believe the answer to this problem may lie in the Praetor [[Hipokos]] found.

:It has no soul, with your direction it should be able to cross the barrier and disable it from the other side.
