* [[Morbid Boneguard's Head]]
* Heads displayed

==Description==
I am no stranger to courts, [[Maw Walker]]. Having attended on [[Queen Azshara]] herself, and then later serving my [[Illidan Stormrage|Lord Illidan]].

That does not mean, however, that I accept every invitation I receive.

<Baroness Vashj smirks.>

Impress me with your strength, <name>, and I will believe [[Prince Renathal]] has power that is worth my time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Baroness Vashj]]

==Progress==
Where are the heads of your enemies?

==Completion==
<Baroness Vashj nods approvingly at the display of heads you placed before her.>

With your power behind the Prince's efforts, I suppose that I had better pay attention.

Very well. I will pay a visit to Prince Renathal and attend his Ember Court.

;Gossip upon completion at 'Stranger' reputation level
:I have witnessed many princes play court throughout the ages, Maw Walker.
:It is more likely to go poorly than well, even in the best of circumstances.
:Your Renathal would do well to listen to his critics more closely than his flatterers.
:Courts always have both. Do you wonder which I shall be?
:<Baroness Vashj smirks.>
