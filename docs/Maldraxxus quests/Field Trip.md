==Objectives==
Bring the Catalyst of Creation to [[Mad Mortimer]] in the [[House of Plagues (subzone)|House of Plagues]] in [[Maldraxxus]].
* [[Catalyst of Creation (rare)]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you have the catalyst, you need only bring it to Mortimer in Maldraxxus. Our last correspondence indicates that his laboratory is still in-tact within the former House of Plagues.

Exercise caution in your journey--what remains of the house is fraught with danger, and Mortimer himself has earned a less than pristine reputation among his peers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, yes! You must be the one from Bastion! Marvelous!

==Progression==
{{Path of Ascension - Mad Mortimer}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
