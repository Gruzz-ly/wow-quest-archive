==Objectives==
Capture [[Thran'tiok]]'s memory through the [[Phylactery of Pain]].
* Memory captured
* [[Soul Mirror (usable)]] (provided)

==Description==
This [[phylactery]] holds the [[soul]] of Thran'tiok... her very essence.

Be quick in whatever you need to do. I must get this piece of her soul away from here before she returns.

Her paranoia shall truly be her end.

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{Abilities|Trial: Thran'tiok|id=340371|icon=achievement_dungeon_thenecroticwake_amarth}}

You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Have you found success?

==Completion==
It is fortunate that you were able to capture the [[lich]]'s memory without encountering her herself.

Such a powerful being is not to be underestimated.

==Notes==
