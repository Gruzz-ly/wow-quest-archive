==Objectives==
Collect 12 Bloodtusk Skulls and deliver them to Marcel Mullby.
*[[Bloodtusk Skull]] (12)
*Deliver skulls to [[Marcel Mullby]]
*[[Louison's Gristle Cutter]] (provided)

==Description==
An eager rookie who wants to be champion of the arena? People love a story like yours, but the first step is to get you noticed.

Here's the plan. Marcel Mullby needs [[bloodtusk]] skulls, but it takes a real fighter to get those!

You go kill some bloodtusks, use my knife to collect their heads, and deliver them to Mullby. That should get you recognition.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 7,220 [[XP]]
*{{cost|36|50|40}}
*+135 [[reputation]] with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
You deliver those skulls?

==Completion==
Good work, you're getting some recognition. I hear people talking about how you killed all those bloodtusks!

==Notes==
Kill [[Predatory Bloodtusk]]s and [[Bloodtusk Alpha]]s and use [[Louison's Gristle Cutter]] on their corpses.

;Talk to Marcel Mullby
Louison said you'd be stopping by.
