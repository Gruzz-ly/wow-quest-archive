==Objectives==
Recover the Broker Bauble.
* Recruit [[Atticus]] (Optional)
* [[Broker Portal]] used
* [[Broker]] [[Corpse]]s searched (4)
* [[Broker Bauble]] recovered from [[Chilled Crustburster]]
*Deliver the Bauble to [[Au'narim]]
* [[Call Atticus]] (provided)

==Description==
Hey, <name>. I've found a lucrative business proposition that'll help me... us... greatly! See, Au'narim is willing to give us supplies if we can help him recover from a trade deal that went sideways.

Apparently, several of his cohorts never returned from a job. He needs us to follow their path and recover the item they failed to deliver. Simple, right?

To ensure we don't have any mishaps, I've taken the liberty of acquiring a few items that may be of help to us.

So, you in?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

After using the portal, the player appears in the [[Chill's Reach]]. Find the dead [[Acquisition Facilitator]]s, [[Specimen Purveyor]]s, and [[Profit Evaluator]].

;Gossip text for broker bodies
*<This broker appears to have died fighting.>
*<They put up a good fight, but seemed unprepared for battle.>
*<The snow bank offered little protection for this broker.>
*<This injured broker almost reached the portal before they died.
:There is no sign that he managed to find anything of value.>
