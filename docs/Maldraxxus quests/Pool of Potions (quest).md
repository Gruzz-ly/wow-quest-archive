==Objectives==
Deliver three Oozing Ingredient: Viscous Oil to the Pool of Potions.
* [[Oozing Ingredient: Viscous Oil]] delivered to [[Pool of Potions]] (3)

==Description==
I shall teach you about the [[Pool of Potions]]. The potions we create here have a variety of beneficial effects.

Kill the [[Ooze|slimes]] in the surrounding ruins and collect the [[Oozing Ingredient: Viscous Oil]] they may drop. Each slime can produce a great quantity of oil, so you'll only be able to carry one slime's worth at a time. 

Deliver this oil to the Pool of Potions and toss it in

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Spiritual Healing Potion|q1=3
|Spiritual Mana Potion|q2=3
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you brought enough oil?

==Completion==
We shall all share in this fabulous brew you have created!

==Notes==
The nearby [[Burning Extract]]s have a chance to drop [[Oozing Ingredient: Viscous Oil]] on the ground when killed. Interact with the oil to collect it, then return to the Pool of Potions to throw it in.

Each pile of Viscous Oil can be interacted with repeatedly within a time limit; once you deliver any oil you're carrying, you can return to the same spot and the Viscous Oil will have reappeared.

On complete:
