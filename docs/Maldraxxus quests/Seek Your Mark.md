==Objectives==
Prepare the ritual.
* Fractured Crystal placed (3)
* Binding Sigil drawn {{co|73.8|44.0|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
I see why [[Draka]] sent you in her stead--you accomplish what she could not.

We have all the pieces. Now, we must simply put them together.

The steps to the ritual are simple: place our fractured crystals in formation around the obelisk.

Then comes the sigil--*our* sigil. Use the [[maldracite]] powder to draw a binding glyph at the obelisk's base.

When you are through, return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|16|80}}
* 3,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Work swiftly.

==Completion==
Vengeance is nearly ours.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Prepare the "ritual". Our ruse must be convincing if we are to deceive Mor'Bitan.}}

Three Tainted Crystal doodads light up. Interact with all three, then with the Ritual Focus at the center and turn in to Vashj.
