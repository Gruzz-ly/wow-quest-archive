==Objectives==
Slay 10 elite contenders.
* Elite combatants defeated (10)

==Description==
I'm impressed you made it this far. But don't get too full of yourself.

Most of the fodder you plowed your way through were amateurs at best. Only one combatant will leave this arena a champion.

Each of the five... uh, three houses has fighters in the field. Most merely seek to test their own limits or earn a bit of favor. Only a few have a real chance at claiming victory.

Seek out those challengers if you wish to claim true glory this day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are they finished?

==Completion==
Still walking on two legs? My hopes for you are rising.

==Notes==
The quest name provides a clue here. Look for elites that are already in combat with other mobs. Let them whittle each other down, then sneak in for the killing blow.

Targets this time include [[Bladesworn Combatant]], [[Stitched Pitfighter]], [[Master Necromancer (Maldraxxus)|Master Necromancer]], and [[Bannersworn Combatant]]s.

Same as the last quest, Vole will chime in on occasion with the same bonus abilities as before.

==Progression==
{{Champion of Pain}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section}}
Only one [[warrior]] walks out of the arena a champion. Those you fought before were just small fry.

Each of the three houses has members fighting on the field. For some, like those you fought before, they simply aim to test their own limits. For others, they truly seek to rise to champion.

Seek out those challengers if you wish to claim any sort of true glory today.
