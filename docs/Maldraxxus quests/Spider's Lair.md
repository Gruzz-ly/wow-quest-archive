==Objectives==
Slay 8 Razorweb Weavers and Manipulator Zalisar.
*[[Razorweb Weaver]] slain (8)

==Description==
When [[House of Eyes|our house]] fell in ruins, [[Manipulator Zalisar]] seized the opportunity to reform the house under his leadership. He found few followers and soon vanished into the ruins nearby.

He has begun to manipulate the [[spider]]s and train them to be his soldiers. Spiders under his control have begun to prey upon our forces. We need to deal with this threat before it grows any worse.

I need you eliminate Manipulator Zalisar and his spider forces.

You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
*3x [[Grateful Offering]]

And one from potential rewards:
*5x Anima item (35)

Your help is always welcome, Maw Walker.
