==Objectives==
Empower the Rune of Might at the [[Seat of the Primus]].
* Empower the [[Rune of Might]]

==Description==
The runes on [[Blade of the Primus|that blade]]... they are the same as the ones etched on the door to the [[Seat of the Primus]]. 

And one of them just began to glow...

Is this what I think it is, <name>? Do you have the means to unseal the Seat? 

If so, then perhaps [[Baron Vyraz|Vyraz's]] gambit was not for nothing. This could turn the tide of the entire war!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|16|80}}
* 3,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Come! Victory awaits!

==Completion==
By blood and thunder, we will crush our foes.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|I will report to Vyraz and then join you at the Seat of the Primus.}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Yours is a legend I wish to witness myself.}}
:''Mevix walks off to the southeast.''

No need to return to the [[Bleak Redoubt]] if the other two quest chains aren't complete yet. Near the overlook are [[Forgotten Supplies (Maldraxxus)|Forgotten Supplies]] starting [[Broker Business]].

Outside the door, Mevix has arrived:
:{{text|emote|Secutor Mevix salutes you.}}

Use the bonus ability again.

This concludes the "House of Constructs" chapter of the [[Maldraxxus storyline]]. Draka previously started [[A Common Peril]] and [[The House of Plagues]], which started two other forks of the campaign. Complete all three forks to continue.

Once all three forks are complete, Draka will continue the Maldraxxus campaign with [[Among the Chosen]].

==Progression==
{{House of Constructs}}

==Beta version==

;Description
I have heard the tales of a great [[warrior]] foretold by age-old [[Prophecy|prophecies]]. I had assumed it'd be one of our own, but... I suppose our own could not accomplish what you have.

Then this means the Seat awaits you, doesn't it? Why do we linger here?!

Come! We must return at once!

;Progress
We can't afford to waste a moment!

;Completion
This will be our victory, <name>. A victory well-earned.
