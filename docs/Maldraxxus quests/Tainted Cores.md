==Objectives==
Fracture the three Depleted Anima Crystals, then charge the [[Fractured Anima Crystal]]s with deceased [[Morbid Ritualist]]s.
* [[Depleted Crystal]] fractured (3)
* Corpse siphoned of [[anima]] (12)
*Bring the charged Fractured Anima Crystals to Baroness Vashj at the ritual site.

==Description==
[[Mor'Bitan|This lich]] seeks a reward for his assault on the [[House of Eyes]]. But the power he craves will be his downfall.

We will use our knowledge of his secret ritual to lure him out of the [[House of Rituals (subzone)|House of Rituals]]. 

Take these crystals, <name>. Charge them with anima reclaimed from Mor'Bitan's slain minions.

But fracture them first, so that they shatter as the ritual nears completion... but not before Mor'Bitan believes that it has begun.

That is when we will strike.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
Well executed.

==Notes==
On accept of both of Vashj's quests:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|I will await you at the ritual site to the north. Work quickly.}}

Pick up [[Vaunted Vengeance]] from [[Khaliiq]] before getting started.

Interact with the three anima crystals to acquire the [[Fractured Anima Crystal]]. Head east into [[Glutharn's Decay]], kill [[Morbid Ritualist]]s, and use the quest item on their corpses. [[Jar of Ground Maldracite|Jars of Ground Maldracite]] litter the quest area. Watch out for the [[Morbid Boneguard]]s!

Find Vashj and Khaliiq to the northeast on the [[Rotting Mound]]:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|This area is secure. Do you have what we require?}}

==Progression==

;Description
[[Mor'Bitan|This lich]] seeks empowerment for his assault on the [[House of Eyes]]. But he does not deserve reward.

He neglected to end me... and I crave vengeance.

If he wants empowerment, we shall draw him out with that promise. Take these crystals, <name>. Charge them with [[anima]] from the bodies of his disciples.

First, though, I'll ask that you fracture them. Doing so will make the anima you collect highly volatile.

It will be useful later, but for now, take caution.
