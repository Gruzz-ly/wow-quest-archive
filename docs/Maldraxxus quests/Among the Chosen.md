'''Among the Chosen''' begins the "Ritual for the Damned" chapter of the [[Maldraxxus storyline]]. To have reached this point, players must have completed the "Matron of Spies", "House of Constructs", and "House of Plagues" storylines started by Draka earlier in the campaign.

==Objectives==

Return to the House of the Chosen.
* Return to the [[House of the Chosen (subzone)|House of the Chosen]]
* Find [[Margrave Krexus|Krexus]]

==Description==
Only one rune remains...

We should return to the House of the Chosen and report to Margrave Krexus. He will want to know of our progress.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|57|}}
* 7,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I will have my soldiers honor Krexus as he deserves.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Draka mounts a [[flayedwing]].''
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|We will report to Krexus. Hold this ground until we return.}}
:{{text|emote|[[Vashj|Baroness Vashj]] scoffs.}}
:{{text|say|[[Secutor Mevix]]|As you command, Baroness.}}
:{{text|say|[[Plague Deviser Marileth]]|See you soon!}}
:''Draka takes off for the southwest.''

Get back to the House of Chosen. The central parts of the citadel are littered with [[House of the Chosen|Chosen]] and [[House of Constructs|Construct]] corpses, while the rest of the citadel has been emptied of NPCs entirely. On the way in, [[Vyraz]] is inspecting the corpses of a bunch of [[Construct Soldier]]s. On approach:
:''Draka runs in.''
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Vyraz! What happened here?}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|The Constructs... retaliated... there were too many...}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|They... destroyed [[Vortrexxis|the necropolis]]. Krexus, he...}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|<Name>, with me! Now!}}

Further in, [[Margrave Krexus]] has fallen as well! Draka is kneeling by his body.
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Without Krexus, victory is out of reach. We must open the [[Seat of the Primus]]!}}
:''Baron Vyraz walks up.''
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|And what if that hall stands empty? No. The Seat is a fool's errand.}}
: ''He kneels by Krexus's body.''
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|We are Chosen. We rely on strength of arms. We must gather our mightiest soldiers... even our [[Alexandros Mograine|missing baron]].}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Was he not lost to the [[Maw]]?}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|This mortal claims to have escaped the Maw's clutches once before! Let us put their words to the test.}}

==Progression==
