==Objectives==
[[File:Lost Kyrian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lost Kyrian]]
[[File:A Burden Worth Bearing.jpg|thumb|Koa and Kou carrying the Lost Kyrian]]
Help Kou and Koa retrieve 6 Lost [[Kyrian]].
* Locate Kyrian equipment {{co|32.7|28.2|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Lost Kyrian]] recovered (6)
* Bring [[Kou]] and [[Koa]] to [[Aspirant Thales|Thales]] {{co|30.1|24.0|Maldraxxus}}
*Find Thales at the Flesh Stitchery

==Description==
[[Secutor Mevix|Mevix]] may be here for blood, but what I want is to spare my fallen kin from a terrible fate.

Most of my fellow [[kyrian]] were either slain in combat or shortly after arriving here. If their corpses were bound for this pit, then perhaps we can recover them before they are thrown into it.

Take the [[steward]]s with you and gather the bodies of my brethren. I will not allow them to be made into monsters.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were there any left?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Though they are lost, at least their remains will not be defiled.

==Notes==
On accept, the three stewards join the party. Just to the southeast are some kyrian javelins and a gurney. Interact with the gurney and [[Koa]] and [[Kou]] will hold it between them while [[Hipokos]] stays behind to tinker with a [[Destroyed Praetor]]:
:{{text|say|Koa|Hipokos, maybe you can fix one of these praetors!}}

Look around for the corpses of [[Lost Kyrian]] and interact with them to toss them on the gurney. Koa and Kou will react with dismay to the added weight each time a new kyrian is tossed on:
*{{Text|say|Koa|Oof!}}
*{{Text|say|Kou|Heavy!}}
:{{Text|say|Koa|Don't let go, Kou!}}

The stewards will not follow the player if they head down into the ripening pond, but will catch back up as soon as the player exits the pit. Once enough have been gathered, turn in to Thales:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|Thank you, mortal. They deserved better than this.}}
:''Thales casts a spell that causes the kyrian bodies to disappear in a flash of blue light.''

;Description
Mevix is here to take lives, but sometimes it's more important to save them.

Most of the [[Ascended]] were killed immediately upon our arrival in [[Maldraxxus]]. I-I don't know what they did with them after that and I don't want to know. But some of them may still be saved. We can't just leave them here!

Take Kou and Koa with you, find my brethren, please have the two bring them back to me. I-I'll figure out some way to save them from this.

;Completion
The smallest of spark of hope remains. You have done well.
