==Objectives==
Collect 3 [[Anima]]-charged [[Maldracite]].
* [[Anima-charged Maldracite]] (3)

==Description==
My mission cannot progress without a supply of [[anima]]. 

Fortunately, the [[Maldraxxi necromancer|necromancers]] nearby have been kind enough to gather some into their maldracite crystals.

You will relieve them of those crystals. They may be reluctant to part with them, but I trust you can be... persuasive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do not fail me.

==Completion==
Yes, these will do nicely.

==Notes==
On accept of both, if you have ''not'' defeated [[Lady Vashj (tactics)|Vashj's encounter]] in [[Serpentshrine Cavern]]:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|[[Mephiles the Loyal|Mephiles]] stands between us and [[Mor'Bitan]]. But not for long.}}

If you ''have'' defeated her:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Mephiles stands between us and Mor'Bitan. Just as I impeded your path to [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]].}}

Head southwest to [[Glutharn's Decay]]. Prisms of [[Anima-charged Maldracite]] are channeling green spheres surrounding a [[Frightened Fungret]] or two. Looting the maldracite will cause the spheres to dissipate, but the fungrets continue to cower in place.

==Progression==

;Description
As with everything in [[Maldraxxus]], my operation demands anima.

To reach the next step of this plot, I need the power of three charged crystals.

In an unexpected gesture of kindness, the [[Maldraxxi necromancer|necromancers]] in this growth have prepared charged maldracite for us to use.

If my training in etiquette has taught me anything, it is that refusing a gift is most reprehensible.

;Progress
I anticipate your success.

;Completion
A most powerful boon.
