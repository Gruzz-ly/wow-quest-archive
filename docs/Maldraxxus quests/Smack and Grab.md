==Description==
Bonetooths are the backbone of [[Maldraxxus]]'s armed forces. Those that have been trained well are in demand amongst all of the houses.

I always need new bonetooths to train, but they can be rather difficult to collect.

Bring me some of the younger ones, and I will reward you greatly. Be advised that you may need to weaken them before you are able to capture them.

You will receive:
* {{cost|36|15|30}}

Bring me back some bonetooths!

==Completion==
I am pleased with your work!

==Notes==
Attack Neonate Bonetooths and bring them to 40%, after which they become dazed and can be clicked on.
