==Objectives==
Report the situation to Baron Vyraz.
* Report to [[Baron Vyraz]] {{co|36.3|60.2|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
Look around you, <name>. [[House of the Chosen|This army]] is all that remains to defy the treachery of the other [[House of Constructs|two]] [[House of Rituals|houses]].

I must regroup with [[Margrave Krexus|the margrave]] and discuss strategy. War will soon be upon us.

I would ask that you prepare for the coming battle alongside the rest of our forces. We cannot afford for a single soldier to falter.

Seek out Baron Vyraz. He has earned countless victories for Maldraxxus. I fear his blades must soon be turned upon our former allies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*  {{cost|2|43|35}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What are you waiting for?

==Completion==
Mark my words, recruit. We will crush the other houses for their acts of treason.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Don't keep Vyraz waiting. He's not known for his patience.}}
:''Draka walks onwards to the platform beyond and uses the Necropolis Teleporter.''

Head northwest to find Vyraz in his tower:
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|The battle awaits us, soldiers! Ready our defenses!}}
:{{text|say|[[Bladesworn Soldier]]|Yes, sir!}}
:''Two Bladesworn Soldiers salute Vyraz and then walk out of the building.''

Speak with Vyraz:
:Speak up, recruit!
:{{gossip|Reporting for duty. I'm to prepare for war against the other houses.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Those spineless traitors are fools to challenge the might of the Chosen!}}

==Progression==

;Description
Take in your surroundings, <name>. This army is all that stands between [[Maldraxxus]] and extinction.

I must regroup with the margrave to discuss these developments. I would have you join me, but his focus must remain on the coming war{{sic}}

In the meantime, we'd be wise to report the situation to the rest of our forces.

Baron Vyraz has earned countless victories for Maldraxxus. See what can be done to earn victory against it.
