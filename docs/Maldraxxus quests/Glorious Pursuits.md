==Description==
Perhaps [[Draka]] has forgotten her loyalties, but I will fulfill my mission.

My enemy--the [[lich]] [[Mor'Bitan]]--hides within the [[House of Rituals (subzone)|House of Rituals]]. For some reason, his underlings skulk in [[Glutharn's Decay|this marsh]].

We have not learned why they are here, but my devoted have spotted Mor'Bitan's second-in-command, Mephiles the Loyal. He will have our answers.

Collect him for me. Once you capture him, slay his kin. Weaken his resolve.

I will prime my base for his interrogation.

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
A simple task for such a storied hero.

==Notes==
[[File:Glorious Pursuits.jpg|thumb|The Hands of Vashj entangling Mephiles]]
On accept of both, if you have ''not'' defeated [[Lady Vashj (tactics)|Vashj's encounter]] in [[Serpentshrine Cavern]]:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Mephiles stands between us and [[Mor'Bitan]]. But not for long.}}

If you ''have'' defeated her:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Mephiles stands between us and Mor'Bitan. Just as I impeded your path to [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]].}}

Head southwest to [[Glutharn's Decay]]. Prisms of [[Anima-charged Maldracite]] are channeling green spheres surrounding a [[Frightened Fungret]] or two.

Find [[Mephiles the Loyal]] in the southwestern part of the quest area outside a [[ziggurat]]. Get him to 50%, then use the quest item to summon two [[Hand of Vashj|Hands of Vashj]] to entangle him:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Excellent. Now show him what will happen if he does not cooperate.}}

Mephiles is now dragged behind the player with a rope: {{Abilities|Dragging Mephiles|id=320178|Dragging an unwilling necromancer.|icon=ability_bossfelorcs_necromancer_purple}}

Kill six [[Morbid Disciple]]s. Upon killing the sixth one:
:{{text|say|Mephiles the Loyal|Slay as many as you wish. I will tell you nothing.}}

Return to Vashj:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Mephiles. How good of you to join us.}}
