==Objectives==
Collect the lost pages of [[Plague Deviser Marileth|Marileth's]] journal from Plague-doused Remnants.
*[[Marileth's Journal - Page One]] found
*[[Marileth's Journal - Page Two]] found
*[[Marileth's Journal - Page Three]] found
*[[Marileth's Journal - Page Four]] found
*Return the pages to Marileth in the House of Plagues.

==Description==
<What appears to be an old journal sits on Marileth's table, now mangled and missing pages.

The entries that are legible seem to have been written by Marileth when he was still sane, before the fall of his house.

Perhaps if you find the journal's missing pages, you will gain more insight into what befell the [[House of Plagues]].>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What is it, my apprentice?

==Completion==
Oh--and what are these?

==Notes==
Pick up both of Marileth's quests before heading out.

Kill [[Plaguedoused Remnant]]s and [[Diseased Remnant]]s to loot the journal pages in turn.
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|In the [[Primus]]'s absence, civil war is surely on the horizon. [[Margrave Stradama]] confides her fears in me. Without [[anima]], our work--and thus our power--has stagnated.}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|The [[House of Rituals]] has offered to provide us with anima. Stradama and I both suspect duplicity... but our house is in no position to refuse. We must remain vigilant.}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|None can openly accuse the [[lich]]es of treachery, so I have instead devised a new potion--a last resort to protect Stradama should the need arise. I pray that it never does.}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|The House of Plagues... annihilated! Where is Stradama? I must craft the potion... I--I must...}}

Once all objectives are done, head southwest past the entrance to the [[Plaguefall]] dungeon to reach Marileth atop [[Plague Watch]]:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|This way, my apprentice!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Have our colleagues misplaced these notes? How disorganized!}}

;Description
<What was once a journal sits on Marileth's table, now mangled and missing pages.

The recordings you can make sense of come from Marileth's sane mind, likely before the fall of the [[House of Plagues]].

Maybe if you find the lost pages, you will gain more context for what happened here.> 

;Notes
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|The Primus has left Maldraxxus. The other houses isolate from us, or perhaps we from them. Our craft struggles without anima, though Stradama grants all she can. She confides her fears in me. I pledge myself to assuage them.}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|The liches have broken the silence. Margrave Sin'dane sent an ambassador. We suspect deception, but shunning them would imply hostility. The stress keeps Stradama in her quarters. I fear for her... and for us all.}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|The liches' anima sustains us. I fear duplicity still, but Stradama cannot spurn her peers. Between assignments, I devise a potion to preserve her should my fears manifest. I pray she'll never need it... or that I craft it in time.}}
#{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Our house... annihilated... where is Stradama? I must craft the potion... I-I must...!}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Have our colleagues misplaced these notes? I'll hold onto them. Thank you, apprentice!}}
