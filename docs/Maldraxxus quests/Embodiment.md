==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lordaeron Blight.jpg||The plague sample 'enlived' by Marileth, and meaner than expected.}}
Slay the Lordaeron Blight.
*[[Lordaeron Blight]] slain

==Description==
What a nasty little plague you've brought me, apprentice. Must've been concocted by a true sadist.

To study the sample, I gave it form. But the ungrateful thing turned on me and attacked, completely unprovoked!

It's shuffled a bit further on into the House. I hate to say it, but I believe this one must be put down before it is allowed to grow any stronger... or larger.

Look on the bright side. If your plague eater manages to survive, it'll be attuned to your particularly terrible form of blight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you disposed of that manifestation?

==Completion==
Despite all the trouble that sample gave us, I think I actually have a little bit of hope now.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|That plague sample you brought put up quite a fight! I'm afraid you'll have to deal with it now.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Take the plague eater with you. If it survives that monstrosity, we'll know we've got the right formula.}}

;Fighting the blight
:{{Text|bossemote|[Slimewaves] crash across the battlefield!}}

As the blight dies, the Plague Eater casts Absorbing.
