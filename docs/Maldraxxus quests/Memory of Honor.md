==Objectives==
Read 3 Faded Epitaphs.
* [[Faded Epitaph]]s read (3)

==Description==
<A tablet sits embedded in the ground near a broken armor display.

The runes on the epitaph conjure images of an ancient warrior in your mind. Clearly [[Maldraxxus]] honors the history of those who claimed great victories here.

Similar memorials seem to be spread throughout [[Iron Trench|the trench]]. Perhaps they can offer more insight into the denizens of this realm.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Many strive for greatness in Maldraxxus. Few truly achieve infamy.

Let us see if our names will one day be remembered.

The three epitaphs are marked on the minimap and are in the Iron Trench.

{{co|44.8|58.3|Maldraxxus}}
{{book|Faded Epitaph|align=center|content=Lady Quinby<br>
House of Rituals

Her sorcery knew no equal. She spoke words of power and her foes crumbled into dust. Though her phylactery was destroyed, she defended the Shadowlands until her final moments.}}

{{co|45.9|61.7|Maldraxxus}}
{{book|Faded Epitaph|align=center|content=Mesil the Phantom<br>
House of Eyes

No shadow could obscure her sight. Valuable intelligence she purchased with blood and sacrifice brought Maldraxxus victory against the [[Void]]. Such is the greatest achievement of espionage.}}

{{co|44.0|61.5|Maldraxxus}}
{{book|Faded Epitaph|align=center|content=Rakel the Vile<br>
House of Plagues

His concoctions poisoned all who touched them. He melted flesh from bone, filled lungs with bile, and struck fear into hearts of steel. Few have ever created such potent weaponry.}}

==Progression==
{{Champion of Pain}}

==Trivia==
*During the beta, accepting this quest would cause Draka to say: {{text|say|The writings on this tablet refer to Belivera. A general for the House of Constructs. She led a combined defense against the Light ages past}}. In the final game, there are no references to Belivera.
*During the beta, all of the epitaphs originally had different text. See the [[Faded Epitaph]] page for details.

==Patch changes==
