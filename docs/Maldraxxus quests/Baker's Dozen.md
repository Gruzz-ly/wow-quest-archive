==Objectives==
Travel to [[Ardenweald]] and collect 13 Hatchready [[Gorm]] Eggs.
* [[Hatchready Gorm Egg]] slain (13)

==Description==
Under this very tent, I've prepared delicacies that would make [[demigod]]s cry tears of joy. I'm always in need of more baking supplies!

The [[broker]]s usually sell me eggs from parts near and far, but maybe this time you could help me out instead.

You familiar with Gorm? Big insect-like things native to Ardenweald. Well, if you find me some eggs of theirs, I'll bake you up something nice in return!

Mama will even send [[Starchy]] to help you out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

It has a chance to award [[Tomalin's Seasoning Crystal]].

==Progress==
Did you find the eggs?

==Completion==
Perfect! Mama just knew you had the skills to handle such a task!
