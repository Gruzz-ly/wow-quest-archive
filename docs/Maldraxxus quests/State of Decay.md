==Description==
{{text|say|[[Zo'sorg]]|This tower is of strategic value to the Maldraxxi. It would benefit the cartel greatly to reclaim it.}}

* 47,250 [[XP]]
* +125 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Completion==
{{text|say|Zo'sorg|Mercenary work is not my typical purview. But that is why we are in business together.}}

==Notes==
*Location: [[Spike|The Spike]], [[Maldraxxus]]{{co|66.6|57.8|Maldraxxus}}
*Objectives:
**[[Slimed Skeleton]]s (5%)
**[[Unslimed Skeleton]]s (5%)
**[[Slimed Queen]] (25%)
**Players (25%)

The [[Toxic Slime]]s in the tower can be picked up and thrown at targets to increase damage taken by 20%. This doesn't count toward the objective, but it can give you an edge against enemy players or allow you to kill mobs faster.
