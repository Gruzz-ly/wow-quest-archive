==Description==
Excellent work, my apprentice! Our laboratory is back in working order!

Now, there is one final ingredient we require to complete our potion for [[Margrave Stradama]].

You will need to run along to the greenhouse. I've cultivated a sprig of dreadshade that should be ready to harvest.

I will prepare the other reagents while you're away. Be safe, apprentice!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found it?

==Completion==
Come, my apprentice! Our efforts nearly bear fruit!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Dreadshade is Margrave Stradama's favorite reagent. Meet me at the laboratory once you've acquired it!}}

Nearby, [[Judas Sneap]] offers an optional side quest: [[A Plague on Your House]], which leads to the weekly [[Pool of Potions (quest)]].

Head southwest across the House of Plagues area to find the [[Blossoming Dreadshade]]. Nothing too special.

On return to Marileth:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Hmm... No primers, no toxoids... [[Plaguey]], did you absorb my arsenic?!}}
