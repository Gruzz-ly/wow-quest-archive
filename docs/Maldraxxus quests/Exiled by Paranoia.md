==Objectives==
Find [[Karaxi the Defector]] in the [[Challenger's Promenade]] in [[Maldraxxus]].
* [[Soulseeker Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[lich]]es of the [[House of Rituals]] were an instrumental piece in the Maldraxxi attack on [[Bastion]]. They are not currenty{{sic}} our allies, and it would be difficult to convince one to let us capture their memory for our training purposes.

We have made contact with a [[Maldraxxi necromancer|necromancer]] who has a score to settle with one of the liches. Find her and she will aid you in capturing this memory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
<Karaxi is sifting through a book very carefully.>

==Completion==
My plan is truly coming to fruition. An outsider, here to help me enact my revenge!

==Progression==
{{Path of Ascension - Thran'tiok}}

==Patch changes==
