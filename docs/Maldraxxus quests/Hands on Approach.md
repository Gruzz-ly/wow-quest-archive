==Description==
When I was imprisoned in the [[Etheric Vault]], the anima scroungers would come to steal what little strength my soul still had. I swore I'd have revenge upon them should I ever escape.

Now, with my blade hands... it's time for my revenge!

I've seen [[anima]] scroungers near the [[House of Constructs (subzone)|House of Constructs]]. I want their leader dead and the anima they took from me recovered!
