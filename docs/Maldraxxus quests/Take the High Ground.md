==Objectives==
Destroy the three enemy positions.
* First Charge placed {{co|35.8|50.3|Maldraxxus}}
* First Charge detonated
* Second Charge placed {{co|36.1|48.4|Maldraxxus}}
* Second Charge detonated
* Third Charge placed {{co|36.1|46.4|Maldraxxus}}
* Third Charge detonated
*Meet Secutor Mevix at the forward position.

==Description==
The [[Commander (rank)|commander]] of the [[House of Constructs|constructs]], [[General Alver]], is a master tactician. A frontal assault has no chance of victory against him. It will be a bloodbath.

His forces have flanked us and secured the high ground. From that position, he can rain destruction upon us unopposed.

We will take the ridge from him before that can happen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
With that ridge clear, we'll be safe to advance.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Mevix! Wreak havoc on those cowards!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|We'll blast them to pieces!}}

Don't focus on the killing and the rallying on the low ground at the start. Head west across the field to reach the ridge. At the south end of the ridge, find [[Lobber Jalrax]]. Interact with the doodad:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|I'll set the charge!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Keep them off me, mortal!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Done! Get clear!}}

While working on clearing the ridge, start killing constructs and rallying demoralized soldiers. After the ridge has been cleared, finish up the other quests while moving to the northeast to find Mevix.

Just to the north is the second:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|This one should pack a punch!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|We have incoming!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|The charge is set! Get back!}}

Further north is the third, guarded by [[Strategist Ocra]] and a [[Steelskin Reader]]:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Time for some mayhem!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Cover me!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Clock's ticking! Move!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|We've taken the ridge! Meet me on the field below!}}

==Progression==

;Description
The [[Commander (rank)|commander]] of the construct forces, [[General Alver]], is a military genius. We won't beat him with a frontal attack, we must outthink him.

His forces have taken the high ground on our flank. From that position he will slaughter our troops if we attack.

You and I are will secure the flank for our attacking troops.
