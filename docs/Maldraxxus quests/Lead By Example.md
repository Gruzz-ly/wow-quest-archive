You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}

On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|[[Secutor Mevix|Mevix]]! Wreak havoc on those cowards!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|We'll blast them to pieces!}}

Don't focus on the killing and the rallying on the low ground at the start. Head west across the field to reach the ridge. While working on clearing the ridge, start killing constructs and rallying demoralized soldiers. After the ridge has been cleared, finish up the other quests while moving to the northeast to find Mevix.
