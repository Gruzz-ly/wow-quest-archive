==Objectives==
Collect 25 bloody tusks from the [[Bloodtusk|boar]]s in [[Maldraxxus]].
*[[Bloody Tusks]] (25)

==Description==
The boars around Maldraxxus have a peculiar trait. Their tusks absorb liquid. Depending on where it has been, these bones may contain a powerful compound of poisons or other alchemical rarities.

It takes a trained eye to tell what the bone is made of, so just bring back a large amount of them. From there I will see if any of them are valuable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
*3x [[Grateful Offering]]

And one from potential rewards:
*X Anima item (35)
*[[Corpsehide Wristwraps]]

==Progress==
Take care not to let any of the bones touch your skin for too long. They may cause irritation.

==Completion==
A fine amount. There will surely be something useful in this collection.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
