==Objectives==
Meet Secutor Mevix near the House of Constructs.
* Meet [[Secutor Mevix]] at the [[House of Constructs (subzone)|House of Constructs]] {{co|36.1|34.9|Maldraxxus}}
* Escape the corpse pile {{co|33.8|31.4|Maldraxxus}}
*Meet Aspirant Thales.

==Description==
Mevix will lead the attack, but you will finish it. There are no reinforcements, no cavalry.

Only you and [[Blade of the Primus|your runeblade]].

Show me the might you wield, outsider. Lay siege to the [[House of Constructs]] and bring them to ruin!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|16|80}}
* 3,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Your voice... you are not one of the Maldraxxi?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|You heard the baron! We push forward!}}

Mevix and the [[Boneplated Phalanx]]es begin running north, despawning a short distance up the road.
*{{text|say|Boneplated Phalanx|Onward toward to their gates!}}
*{{text|say|Boneplated Phalanx|Advance!}}
*{{text|say|Boneplated Phalanx|To battle!}}

Follow the road north until the fork, then head northwest. Mevix is kneeling on a small hill just outside the [[House of Constructs (subzone)|House of Constructs]], wounded and surrounded by dead Chosen and construct soldiers. Interact with him, and a cutscene plays:
:''[[Margrave Gharmal]] and a number of abominations emerge from the entrance to the House of Constructs.''
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|Constructs! Hold this ground! Our victory is at hand!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|We can't fight our way in. There's too many of them.}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|This calls for a change of strategy.}}
:''The camera shows a group of abomination leftovers scavenging parts from the nearby corpses.''
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Play dead. If they think you're a lifeless husk, they'll collect you for parts.}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Go on. I'll create a diversion.}}
:''Mevix runs up in front of Gharmal.''
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Face me, traitors! The House of Constructs will fall!}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|Capture that fool!}}
:''Mevix manages to cut down two of the abominations but is brought to his knees by a blow from the third.''
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|Mevix will suffer for his defiance!}}
:''Gharmal begins walking toward Mevix. The camera shows the player lying still among the corpses from the earlier battle.'
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|The rest of you, scour the field. Bring me fuel for the [[Body Banks]]!}}

[[File:Corpse Pile.jpg|thumb|The Corpse Pile.]]
On the other side of the cutscene, the player wakes up in the [[Hall of Chains]] under a pile of corpses, mostly [[kyrian]] and [[steward]]s. Interact with it to shove corpses off one by one, until...
:{{text|say|[[Aspirant Thales]]|Wait! I am not yet a corpse!}}
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|The others... can you help me find them?}}

Thales runs over to the entrance of the nearby hall. Speak with him to turn in.

==Progression==
{{House of Constructs}}
