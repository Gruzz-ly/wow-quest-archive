==Objectives==
Collect 12 Weapons of the Fallen.
* [[Weapons of the Fallen]] (12)

==Description==
A lot of competitors meet their end in the [[Theater of Pain]]. But their weapons are still good as new!

It can get expensive to equip a fresh recruit, especially if you're not sure they'll survive their first bout. That's why we outfit them with "slightly used" armaments.

Gather them up for me, would you? Can't let a good weapon go to waste!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|36|50|40}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]
*+135 [[reputation]] with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
The weapons you collect could be wielded by a future champion!

==Completion==
These weapons will be put to good use. Hopefully, we won't have to collect some of them again.

;Description
Through the eons, many have fallen in the Theater of Pain. The weapons of the fallen contain a lineage of greatness.

We place these weapons in the hands of new recruits, so they may add to their glorious history.

Time for you to honor our tradition. You will collect weapons of the fallen. It is a task every combatant has performed before fighting in the Theater of the Pain.
