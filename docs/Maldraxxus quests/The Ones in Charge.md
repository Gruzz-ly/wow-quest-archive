[[File:Leacher Cvan.png|thumb|upright|Leacher Cvan]]

*Find Secutor Mevix, and the other survivors in the House of Constructs.

==Description==
They have been collecting [[kyrian]]... and our corpses... for some dark purpose.

Whatever they are planning, we must put a stop to it.

I have overheard mention of three individuals who seem to be in charge. We need to find them and eliminate them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Deceitful Agent's Wristwraps
|Cruel Executioner's Wristwraps
|Flesh Architect's Wristwraps
|Corpse-Stitcher's Wristwraps
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It seems [[Baron Halis|one of the house's barons]] is overseeing this operation... and he is unaware that we are free. 

We have a chance to strike him down!

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|Those who perpetrate these horrors must face justice.}}

Head north into the [[Separation Chamber]]. To the northeast is [[Tabulator Hymeris]]:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|The tabulator counts bodies like currency.}}

Just to the east inside the [[ziggurat]] (enter from the south) is [[Doctor Hivvil]]:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|They... experiment on us...}}

Further east is [[Leacher Cvan]]:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|This magic... What are they doing to my brethren?!}}

Upon defeating all three:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|It is done. I must rejoin the others!}}

Head southeast to the [[House of Constructs (subzone)|House of Constructs]] proper to find the survivors hiding behind a platform next to a pit where [[Baron Halis]] is patrolling:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|All these atrocities... how are we to trust you?}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Trust me or don't. This is not what the Maldraxxi stand for.}}

==Progression==
{{House of Constructs}}

==Trivia==
During the alpha, it rewarded [[Repurposed Abomination Choker]].

;Description
They've been taking [[kyrian]], living and dead, to do who knows what with them!

We need to find out what is going on here, and put a stop to it.

I heard a voice mention three people that seem to be in charge of this area. We need to find these people, and put an end to their actions.

;Completion
One of their Barons is here, he seems unaware that we're free. We have an opportunity here!
