==Objectives==
Return to the [[Seat of the Primus]] with [[Blade of the Primus|your runeblade]].
* Empower the Rune of Guile {{co|50.4|67.7|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
[[Mor'Bitan]] has met his end... and a painful one at that.

Your fortitude contributed in no small part to my success. You have earned my allegiance... for the time being.

There is much left to do, should you truly desire ownership of this realm.

Let us regroup at the Seat.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Corpse-Stitcher's Treads
|Deceitful Agent's Boots
|Flesh Architect's Footguards
|Cruel Executioner's Warboots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|12|16|80}}
* 3,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you successful?

==Completion==
It is good to have allies. Even ones so stubborn.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|So you hold the key to the [[Seat of the Primus]]. Then I will meet you there.}}

If you have ''not'' defeated [[Lady Vashj (tactics)|Vashj's encounter]] in [[Serpentshrine Cavern]]:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Together, we will exterminate the traitors who infest Maldraxxus.}}

If you ''have'' defeated her:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|It pleases me to know your power has not waned. I would hate to have been slain by a weakling.}}

No need to return to the [[Bleak Redoubt]] if the other two quest chains aren't complete yet.

At the door, Vashj (accompanied by [[Khaliiq]]) and Draka say hi:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|It is good to fight beside you again, Vashj.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Save your pleasantries.}}

This concludes the "Matron of Spies" chapter of the [[Maldraxxus storyline]]. Draka previously started [[The House of Plagues]] and [[Baron of the Chosen]], which started two other forks of the campaign. Complete all three forks to continue.

Once all three forks are complete, Draka will continue the Maldraxxus campaign with [[Among the Chosen]].
