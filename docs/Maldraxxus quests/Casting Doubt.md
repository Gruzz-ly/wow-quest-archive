==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Sorcerer Vutral.jpg|Sorcerer Vutral|A necromancer whose suspicions could unravel your plans in the House of Rituals.}}
Defeat Sorcerer Vutral in the [[Vault of Souls]].
* [[Sorcerer Vutral]] slain {{co|60.4|78.2|Vault of Souls}}
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
<A note has been left here for [[Kel'Thuzad]]. It does not appear that he has read it.>

Baron, I do not trust your new favorite [[acolyte]]. Something has been off about them ever since they returned from their ritual with the [[Kyrian]] remains.

Your work is too important to allow such discrepancies. The acolyte should be disposed of.

Faithfully,

Sorcerer Vutral

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Sorcerer's Blade]]
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 11,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Sorcerer Vutral has been silenced, and with him the suspicions of your ruse.>

==Notes==
Southeast end of the vault. Though the quest suggests three players, it's soloable with good play. Clear out the guards first.

Defeat:
