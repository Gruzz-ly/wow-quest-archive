==Objectives==
Locate the lost baroness in the [[Renounced Bastille]].
* Deliver the summons to the lost baroness {{co|67.7|45.9|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Summons of the Chosen]] (provided)

==Description==
Each house in [[Maldraxxus]] has two barons. Before the fall of my first house--the [[House of Eyes]]--[[Akarek|our margrave]] sent my fellow baroness to investigate suspicious behavior in the [[House of Rituals]].

I have not heard from her since. Either she has found something... or has become another casualty of their treachery. 

Her orders took her to [[Glutharn's Decay|the Decay]] in the east. If you can find the baroness, give her this summons. 

We were not friends, she and I, but she is a formidable combatant. We could use her might.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Someone new...but someone familiar.

==Completion==
Be thankful I am the one you found here.

Others in Maldraxxus may not have seen the potential in your strength.

==Notes==
On accept of all three of [[A Common Peril]], [[The House of Plagues]], and [[Baron of the Chosen]]:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|[[Baron Vyraz|Vyraz]] is brash, but he's right. We need reinforcements.}}

Far to the northeast is the [[Renounced Bastille]]. There, [[Baroness Vashj]] is taking a report from a [[Ritualistic Necromancer]], but it does not go well for the necromancer...
:{{text|say|Ritualistic Necromancer|[[Mephiles the Loyal|Mephiles]]! Mephiles knows everything...}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Then you have nothing left to offer.}}
:''Vashj kills the necromancer.''
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|And what do you--}}

Vashj's next line differs depending on whether you have defeated [[Lady Vashj (tactics)|her encounter]] in [[Serpentshrine Cavern]]. If you have ''not'' defeated her:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Ah, you are from Azeroth. This should prove interesting.}}

If you ''have'' defeated her:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Well, well. I have anticipated our reunion for quite some time.}}

Speak with Vashj:
:I grow anxious to act.
:{{gossip|I have a summons from Draka.}}
:''Vashj reads the note.''
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Draka abandons us and then demands our loyalty? Unlike her, I will not leave my task unfinished.}}
:''Vashj tosses the note into the campfire behind her.''

If you have ''not'' defeated her:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Lend your strength to my cause and I will answer her pleas for help.}}

If you ''have'' defeated her:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|If memory serves, you excel at slaying your enemies. Perhaps you can be of use.}}</span>

;Description
In times of strife, allies are all we have.

Every house has two [[baron]]s. Before the fall of my old house--the [[House of Eyes]]--our [[margrave]] sent my opposite to investigate the [[House of Rituals]].

I have not heard of her since. Knowing her, this absence means she's found something.

Her orders took her to the Decay in the east. Find her and give her this summons.

Her influence could go a long way to win this war.
