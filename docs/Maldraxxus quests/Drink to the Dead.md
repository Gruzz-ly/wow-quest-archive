==Objectives==
24 Purified Nectar and 2 Stewards collected
* Recruit [[Naxx]]
* Kyrian Stewards recruited (2)
* [[Purified Nectar (quest item)]] (24)
* [[Call Naxx]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Forsworn]] are ravaging the temples of [[Bastion]], and the aspirants are leaving behind their supplies as they flee.

All those wonderful bottles of nectar falling into the hands of the Forsworn? I think not!

There's no way we can save all of the aspirants, but we can keep the Forsworn from taking those supplies. Besides... we could all use something to drink around here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]
