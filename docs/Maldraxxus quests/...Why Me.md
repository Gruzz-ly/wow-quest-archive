==Objectives==
Deliver the Reclaimed Vessel to [[Overseer Kalvaros]] at the [[Challenger's Promenade]].
*[[Reclaimed Vessel]]

==Description==
<The dense, chunky liquid inside the vessel emits a horrendous odor.

The initials O.K. are etched into the side. It seems someone stole Overseer Kalvaros' canteen.> 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|48|20|40}}
*[[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Completion==
I've been wondering where my canteen went. Where did you find this, <name>? Did you take a drink before returning here?

No matter, I suppose.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|say|Overseer Kalvaros|All this talking often leaves these old bones quite parched, and one must stay hydrated when wrangling all of these combatants.}}
