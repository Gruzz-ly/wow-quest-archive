Have you finished choosing our gift slimes yet, apprentice?

==Completion==
You've done very well apprentice!

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Is that the sound of a naive apprentice approaching that I hear?}}

;On accept
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Kevin will meet you over by our new friends after taking his own shortcut. Just herd them toward him and he will do the rest!}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|I'm so pleased. A research outing is just what Kevin needs and I'm sure our colleagues will appreciate our thoughtfulness in bringing them more slimes!}}

;On completion gossip at 'Stranger' reputation level
:Your career trajectory troubles me, <name>.
:I have never had a former apprentice of mine go on to host courts.
:Most irregular...
:Kevin seems taken with the idea, however, so I guess I won't stand in the way of progress.
:When is the next Ember Court, by the way?
