==Objectives==
Deliver any combination of Mephitic Goo, Viscous Oil or Miscible Ooze to the Pool of Mixed Monstrosities.
*Oozing Ingredients collected from slimes (3)
*Oozing Ingredients thrown into Pool of Mixed Monstrosities (3)

==Description==
I witnessed your success with the [[Pool of Potions]], and I think you could be of help. Within this larger pool, we create more dangerous mixtures!

There are three different oozing ingredients we mix together in different combinations to create violent creatures. When enough ingredients have been added to the pool, the mixture takes shape and a creature will emerge!

Bring any combination of these ingredients, Mephitic Goo, Viscous Oil, or Miscible Ooze to the Pool of Mixed Monstrosities.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|36|50|40}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
Have you completed the mixture?

==Completion==
You may continue to add as many ingredients as you wish. The more we add, the more we create!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Foul-Tongue Cyrlix|You may find Mephitic Goo and Miscible Ooze difficult to find.}}
