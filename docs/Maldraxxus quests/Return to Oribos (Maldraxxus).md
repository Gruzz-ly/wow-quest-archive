==Objectives==
Speak to [[Tal-Inara]] in [[Oribos]].

==Description==
I wouldn't be a tactician if I didn't recognize when the mission is complete.

Much remains to be done before [[Maldraxxus]] can stand tall once again, but that day will come thanks to your efforts.

There are other realms in need of your skills more than us. You should return to Oribos and see to it that they receive it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Completion==
You have done well in Maldraxxus. Their path forward is clear.

==Progression==
{{The Threads of Fate}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
