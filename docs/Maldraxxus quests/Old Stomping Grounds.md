==Objectives==
Collect 15 Lost Animacones. Use Toothpick's World Shaker to unearth them.
*Recruit [[Toothpick]]
*[[Lost Animacone]] collected (15)
*[[Call Toothpick]] (provided)

==Description==
Once, long ago, I journeyed to [[Ardenweald]] to assist in putting down a threat now long forgotten.

I remember that while there, I saw small creatures taking tiny clusters of [[anima]]--[[animacone]]s, the [[Night Fae|fae]] called them--and buried them under the soil.

If those clusters are still there, we must gather them for ourselves!

I should be able to unearth any of the animacones we encounter. Let's go hunt for them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Superior Parts

==Progress==
Did you find the anima?

==Completion==
Thank you, Maw Walker. This extra anima will tremendously aid our efforts.
