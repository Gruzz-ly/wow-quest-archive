==Objectives==
Collect 15 Lost Anima Caches.
*Recruit [[Toothpick]]
*Lost [[Anima Cache]] collected (15)
*[[Call Toothpick]] (provided)

==Description==
The thin pale ones of Revendreth have been hoarding anima.

I've heard they've been hiding it away, digging holes in the woods and just leaving it there. Anyone could come along and take it.

I say it should be us!

Let's go get some anima.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,450 XP
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

{{itembox||Superior Parts|Salvaged Supplies (Stitchmasters)}}

It also has a chance to award [[Stitched Wraith's Armguards]].

==Progress==
Did you find the anima?

==Completion==
Thank you for the supplies. I'll see about setting some aside for you at regular intervals.

==Notes==
In the [[Banewood]], position yourself to the center of the quest circles, then use World Shaker to dig up [[Anima Cache]]s. Sometimes [[Disturbed Mite]]s appear.
