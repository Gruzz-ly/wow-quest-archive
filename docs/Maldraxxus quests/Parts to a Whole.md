;Description
Damien has some great dreams, but without more [[abomination]]s, this training facility will not succeed!

I have a plan though! If we can't recruit more abominations, then we shall make them ourselves!

I need you to make some corpses, then mark them for harvesting with a flag. I will do the rest.
