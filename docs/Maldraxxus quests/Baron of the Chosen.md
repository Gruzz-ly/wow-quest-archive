==Objectives==
Meet with [[Baron Vyraz]] at the [[Spearhead (Maldraxxus)|Spearhead]].

==Description==
Our forces at the Spearhead are under siege from [[Margrave Gharmal]]'s vanguard. If Vyraz himself is leading the defense, then the situation must be dire.

The [[House of Constructs]] shapes flesh to forge bodies for its forces. They were once an indispensable ally, but have become a fearsome enemy.

[[Margrave Krexus]] trusts your might. No doubt you will have need of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|43|35}}
* 910 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I expect much of you, mortal. Help lead our frontal assault on the construct forces!

==Notes==
On accept of all three of [[A Common Peril]], [[The House of Plagues]], and [[Baron of the Chosen]]:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Vyraz is brash, but he's right. We need reinforcements.}}

Each quest starts a separate chapter of the [[Maldraxxus storyline]]. For this chapter, in the [[House of Constructs]], head northwest to the [[Spearhead (Maldraxxus)|Spearhead]] to find [[Baron Vyraz]] and [[Secutor Mevix]]:
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Push forward! Break their line with a frontal assault!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|But sir... that will result in a massive number of casualties.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Such is the price of victory!}}

==Progression==
{{House of Constructs}}
