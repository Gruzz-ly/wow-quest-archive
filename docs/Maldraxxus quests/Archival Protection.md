==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|image=The Archivist.jpg|name=The Archivist}}
Defeat the Archivist.
* [[The Archivist (Maldraxxus)|The Archivist]] slain

==Description==
The rarest volumes are kept at the top of [[Sepulcher of Knowledge|this tower]], protected by an entity called the Archivist.

This stoic guardian is incorruptible. Intractable. Completely uninterested in striking a fair bargain!

Its utter lack of business acumen is really quite upsetting.

Ah, well. I fear we have no choice but to dispatch this impediment. Shall we?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|50|40}}
* 12,500 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Completion==
The volumes are not here!

The Archivist's final words must have meant something. A clue, perhaps?

==Notes==
On accept, Ta'eran begins accompanying you and assisting you in combat. The Archivist is waiting in the chamber at the top of the tower along with a few [[Tome of War|Tomes of War]].

;Aggro
:{{Text|say|The Archivist|So long your climb, can you face failure now?}}

;Death
:{{Text|say|The Archivist|Victory only belongs to those brave enough to fail.}}

After killing it, turn in to Ta'eran. While you're in the room, you can loot the [[The Necronom-i-nom]] toy from one of the bookshelves.

;Description
The Archivist resides at the top, guarding access to the rarest volumes.

They are but a summoned guardian. They can not be reasoned with. They have but one purpose... guard the volumes.

We will have to dispatch them.
