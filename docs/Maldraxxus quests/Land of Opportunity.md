==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Grandmaster Vole|Only two gladiators remain! One legend will grow, and the other will end!}}

Players are buffed with {{Abilities|Rising Champion|Damage taken reduced by 75%. Damage done increased by 150%.|icon=achievement_bg_killflagcarriers_grabflag_capit}}

The arena is empty with the exception of [[High Champion Meskal]]. Don't stand in the frontal cleave. Run over the weapon that appears on the ground when it appears, and destroy the banner each time Meskal drops it.

Once Meskal falls, a cutscene begins:
[[File:Land of Opportunity - confrontation.jpg|thumb|Confrontation of the margraves.]]
:''[[Margrave Gharmal]] teleports into the arena.''
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|A victor emerges!}}
:''[[Margrave Sin'dane]] and [[Margrave Krexus]] teleport in.''
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|But where are their banners?}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|Which house do they fight for?}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|Look closer, Gharmal.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|We have a living mortal in our midst. Intriguing...}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|Sin'dane, is this the meddler who thwarted our attack?}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|The very one.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Krexus|So this mortal witnessed your treachery!}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Krexus|Your houses invaded Bastion--an act that betrays everything the Primus stood for!}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|The Primus is long gone, Krexus!}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|Where is your hunger for glory?}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Gharmal|Or has the [[House of the Chosen]] lost its appetite?}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Krexus|We are meant to defend the Shadowlands, not conquer it!}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Krexus|You will recall your forces... or you will answer to my blade!}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|I think not, Krexus. Your blade... shall be broken.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|Slay them all.}}
:''Forces from the [[House of Rituals]] and [[House of Constructs]] rush into the arena.''
:{{text|say|Margrave Krexus|Chosen! To arms!}}
:''Soldiers from the House of the Chosen rush in to clash with Gharmal and Sin'dane's forces. All three margraves teleport out.''

On the other side of the cutscene:
[[File:Land of Opportunity - pursuit.jpg|thumb|Draka's mount being chased by the Rotwing Construct.]]
:{{text|yell|Master Boneweaver|Leave none standing!}}
:''[[Draka|Baroness Draka]] flies in on her [[Draka's Flayedwing|flayedwing mount]], swoops the player off the ground, and exits the arena, but the group is pursued by a [[Rotwing Construct]].''
:{{text|yell|Baroness Draka|Outsider! Hold on! We're getting out of here!}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|I am Baroness Draka. The House of the Chosen stands with you.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|No time for talk. We move, now!}}

Shortly after getting out of the arena, another cutscene plays.
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|We can't get away! Brace yourself!}}
:''The Rotwing begins firing necrotic bolts at Draka's mount. The flayedwing manages to dodge two of them but is struck by the third bolt, knocking it, Draka, and the player out of the sky.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the player awakens in the [[Iron Trench]] next to Draka, who is kneeling next to the dead flayedwing. Talk to Draka to turn in. On completion:
:{{Text|say|Baroness Draka|Our enemies surround us. Stay off the main road.}}
