==Description==
Scunner, a roiling mass of flesh and slime, has crawled out of the ruins of the [[House of Plagues]].

He emits a toxic vapor that impairs the functions of those who attempt to fight him. You can try it, [[Maw Walker]], but it's doubtful you could hurt him on your own.

Constructs are built to fight creatures like Scunner. So gather a force of them and eliminate the threat.
