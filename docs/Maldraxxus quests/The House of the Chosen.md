==Objectives==
Head to the House of the Chosen with [[Draka]].
* Enter the [[House of the Chosen (subzone)|House of the Chosen]]
* Speak with Draka

==Description==
<Draka gestures to the sky.>

Look there, mortal. That is [[Vortrexxis|the necropolis]] of [[Margrave Krexus]], who leads the [[House of the Chosen]]. It is my honor to serve as his baroness.

Let us ride to our fortress. There we can gather our strength and make ready for the battle to come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|41|}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
The Chosen are all that remains of what the [[Primus]] stood for.

We are the last hope of this realm.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|The Chosen fight with strength and honor. We will crush the traitors and end this war.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Come. This is our only path to the House of the Chosen.}}

Head southeast to reach the [[House of the Chosen (subzone)|House of the Chosen]]:
:{{text|say|Margrave Krexus|Chosen! Our enemies move against us! War is at hand, and victory will be ours!}}

Approach Krexus:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Margrave Krexus is the strongest of us. Show him no fear. Only respect.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Krexus|You did well to pull the mortal from [[Theater of Pain|the arena]]. We could not let our enemies take them.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|They have shown resilience and strength. Qualities we need in these dire times.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Krexus|Agreed. Put the mortal through their paces. Then join me in the necropolis. We have a war to wage.}}

Afterward, speak with Draka and select the gossip option to view ''[[Afterlives|Afterlives: Maldraxxus]]'':
:Welcome to the last bastion of honor in Maldraxxus. Your arrival here was nearly as chaotic as my own.
:{{Gossip|Tell me your story.}}

This concludes the "Champion of Pain" chapter of the [[Maldraxxus storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[The First Act of War]].
