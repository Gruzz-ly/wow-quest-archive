==Objectives==
Help Bonesmith Heirmir forge your [[runeblade]].
* Speak with [[Bonesmith Heirmir]] {{co|36.3|71.1|Maldraxxus}}
* Protect Heirmir {{co|36.4|70.5|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Glowing Runeblade]] {{co|36.4|70.4|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
That's everything I need. Time to get to work.

I'd stay close, if I were you. Forging a weapon is never a simple task when the [[Primus]]'s handiwork is involved.

If he taught me anything, it was to expect the unexpected.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Fleshcraft]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|48|67|20}}
* 10,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Stay close, now.

==Completion==
The Primus was always fond of his trials. It seems you've passed this one. Well done.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Well? Are you ready to start or not?}}

Speak with Heirmir again:
:Everyone always has need of the forge. New weapons, new armor. They should learn to properly maintain their equipment instead.
:{{gossip|I am ready to start forging a rune weapon.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|The Primus may have taught me a lot about the forge, but I've learned a thing or two myself since then!}}
:''Heirmir places the blade on her anvil and starts hammering on it. Necromantic energy starts swirling around the area.''
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Ah, he enchanted the blade. Of course he did. You might want to get ready for a fight.}}

An [[Ephemeral Necromage]] and an [[Ephemeral Warrior]] spawn. Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Keep those things off me while I work! This is a test of your skills as well as mine!}}

Three [[Fragmented Echo]]es spawn. Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Just how many souls did he forge into this thing?!}}

The [[Guardian of the Blade]] spawns:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|The enchantment's final guardian! Vanquish it and claim your runeblade!}}

Defeat it:
:''Heirmir gets blasted away from the anvil as the finished [[Glowing Runeblade]] starts hovering in the air.''
:{{text|whisper|Voice of the Primus|The ambition to rise above all others.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Gah! Well, I forged it... but clearly you are the only one meant to wield it. Go on, then.}}

Loot it, and a small cutscene plays as the camera tracks around to zoom in on the player holding the sword aloft with a rune hovering above it.
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Looks like taking up the blade empowered one of its runes. Knowing the Primus, that's just the start of something more.}}

;Description
All right. You got everything I need. Now it's time to work my magic.

Stay near, won'tcha? This blade has a strange feeling about it.

If [[Primus|my master]] taught me anything, it's to expect the unexpected.

;Completion
What a mess! Ah, well. 'Least you got what you came for, huh?

;Heirmir's gossip
:Everyone just wants more armor or more siege weapons. Maybe if we didn't keep goin' to war with ourselves, we'd have better equipment.

;Voice of the Primus' whisper
:{{Text|whisper|Voice of the Primus|The ambition to rise above your foes.}}
