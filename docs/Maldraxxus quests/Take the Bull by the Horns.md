==Objectives==
Ride 5 Bloodskin Tauraluses back to Dundae.
* [[Bloodskin Tauralus]] returned (5)
* [[Bone Splinter]] (provided)

==Description==
I've carved out quite the reputation as a [[tauralus]] wrangler. Everyone needs a tauralus!

You do some work for me, and people will know who you are as well.

Take this bone splinter and poke a few juicy nibblers. Use them to lure a tauralus to you, then ride it back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|15|30}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
You want to be famous? Get the tauraluses I wanted?

==Completion==
These are some good tauraluses. Thanks for the help, mortal!

==Notes==
First, find [[Juicy Nibbler]], then use [[Bone Splinter]] on the [[Bloodskin Tauralus]] (they get the Focused Frenzy buff) to mount them and bring them back to [[Dundae]].

;Five bonetooths delivered
