==Objectives==
Defeat Devmorta in the [[Theater of Pain]], when he appears.
*[[Devmorta]] slain
*Suggested players: 5

==Description==
Dear [[Maw Walker]]... my friend... you're going to lose. Everyone knows you can't compete in the arena.

The entire [[Challenger's Promenade]] knows it, the [[broker]]s in [[Oribos]] know it, even [[Zo'umlo]] knows it.

I've brought in a special challenger just to prove the point. Face Devmorta in the Theater of Pain and prove us wrong... or prove us right.

We will be betting, so don't disappoint.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|61|}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[The Undying Army]]
