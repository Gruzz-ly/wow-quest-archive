==Objectives==
Destroy 10 Vestigial Animates.
*[[Vestigial Animate]] destroyed (10)
*[[Harvesting Hook]] (provided)
*Meet up with Secutor Mevix.

==Description==
The corpses are brought to this pit for processing. Their flesh is liquified and congealed before being shaped into new constructs.

We can hinder their production by extracting the animates from the pool prematurely. Use this hook to do so.

Do not let [[Baron Halis]] catch you. He has a reputation for cruelty, even within his own house.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The weak make way for the strong, such is the way of Maldraxxus.

==Completion==
Slowing the production of new constructs should earn our soldiers some reprieve, however brief.

==Notes==
On accept of both of Mevix's quests:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|This reeks of [[Surgeon Stitchflesh|Stitchflesh]]'s handiwork. Create a distraction while I hunt down his disciples!}}
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|Are all Maldraxxi so bloodthirsty?}}

Pick up [[A Burden Worth Bearing]] from [[Aspirant Thales]] before getting started.

Steer well clear of [[Baron Halis]] while in the center. He moves slowly, but packs a punch. Interact with the [[Vestigial Animate]]s stuck in the ground to pull a few out. Defeat them and repeat until enough have been destroyed.

==Progression==
{{House of Constructs}}

==Beta version==

;Description
After the spoils of war are processed, they're thrown into this pit. Here they congeal into a solid form that is used as a base starting point for all new construct.

Use a Harvesting Hook and pull the animates from the pool. An early harvest should slow their production.

Baron Halis likes to oversee this process personally, don't let him catch you.

;Completion
While we cannot fully shut down this operation, this should be enough damage to give our soldiers a bit of reprieve on the front.
