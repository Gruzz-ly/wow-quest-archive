;Objective
Eliminate [[Strategist Orco]], [[Lobber Jalrax]], and [[Munitioner Vizic]]

;Description
The [[abomination]]s are well organized and well supplied. We've not been able to gain any ground.

A little disorganization in their supplies and reinforcements might give us an edge.

I need you to work you way behind their lines and eliminate three abominations handling their supplies.
