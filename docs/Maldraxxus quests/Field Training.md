Though it was not by our hand, Maldraxxus has dealt a great injustice to the kyrian of Bastion. We must do all that we can to make amends.

The Forsworn menace continues to be a thorn in their side. Sounds like the perfect opportunity to both show our support and for our recruits to gain some combat experience.
