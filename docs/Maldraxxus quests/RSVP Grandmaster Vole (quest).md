==Objectives==
Convince Grandmaster Vole by bribing him or slaying players of the opposite faction.
*[[Grandmaster Vole]] convinced
*Bribe paid: {{Cost|250}} (optional)
*[[Alliance]]/[[Horde]] players slain (5) (optional)

==Description==
I'm busy, so I'll get right to the point.

The only way I'm going is if you pay me enough coin to make it worth my while or you amuse me.

As interesting and enjoyable as the [[Ember Court]] may be, I lose money every time I am away from here. That said, I do love a good slaughter.

So, coin or deaths. Take your pick.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Grandmaster Vole]]

{{itembox||RSVP: Grandmaster Vole

==Progress==
You need to cough up the coin or get killing.

==Completion==
That works. I'll be there. It will be a nice vacation.

==Notes==
*This quest becomes available after using the [[Guest List Page]] rewarded by [[The Ember Court (quest)]].

;Gossip upon completion at 'Stranger' reputation level
:How could your Ember Court compete with a spectacle like this, Maw Walker?
:Will your next court have Azmogal or big Urtz here stomping on the cake?
:<Vole motions at the massive molten giant below.>
:I wouldn't recommend trying. I doubt the flimsy venthyr could handle him.

;Gossip upon completion at 'Buddy' reputation level
:<Name>, I was just telling some of the others about you and the SECOND-BEST entertainment in the Shadowlands.
:When is the next Ember Court, by the way? I promised a few of the up and coming prospects that I'd let them tag along.
