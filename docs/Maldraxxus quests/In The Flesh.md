==Objectives==
Take control of the Soulfused Construct and escape the [[House of Constructs (subzone)|House of Constructs]].
* Take control of the [[Soulfused Construct]] {{co|28.9|22.0|Maldraxxus}}
* [[House of Constructs|Constuct House]] Forces destroyed (0/100%)
* [[Baron Halis]] slain {{co|31.2|29.5|Maldraxxus}}
* House of Constructs escaped {{co|34.2|33.8|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Rune of Might]]
*Regroup with Aspirant Thales and the others at the Spider's Watch overlook.

==Description==
The souls of the fallen [[kyrian]]... I can sense their pain and confusion. They yet exist within the construct!

Please, we must not destroy it. Doing so would consign the souls within it--the souls of my brethren--to oblivion. 

Perhaps... perhaps they can aid us in escaping to freedom. I will soothe the souls within the construct while you direct its actions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My fallen kin...

==Completion==
We escaped!

We will recuperate here for now. At least until we find a way to return to [[Bastion]].

Thank you for showing me what courage is, my friend.

==Notes==
[[File:Rune of Might.jpg|thumb|The Rune of Might]]
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Aspirant Thales|Trust what remains of my fellow kyrian! They will bear us to safety!}}

Interact with the [[Soulfused Construct]] to take control of the vehicle. The player, Mevix, Thales, [[Kou]], and [[Koa]] all jump up on the abomination to ride on its shoulders.
:{{Text|say|Secutor Mevix|Such incredible power! We could even slay their baron!}}
:{{Text|say|Aspirant Thales|And claim justice for my fallen kin.}}

The construct has three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Big Blue Fist|Strikes the target twice for X Physical damage.|id=331161|icon=spell_deathknight_icetouch|cd=2 sec|notes=0.8 sec cast}}
#{{Abilities|Purifying Spew|Inflicts Holy damage to all enemies in front of the caster.|id=321705|icon=spell_fire_blueflamebreath|cd=12 sec|notes=1 sec cast}}
#{{Abilities|Strength of Many|Heals the caster for 10% of maximum health every 1 for 5 sec.|id=321700|icon=spell_animabastion_buff|cd=30 sec|notes=1.5 sec cast}}

Targets include: [[Warstitched Guard]]s (8%), [[Warstitched Surgeon]]s (3%), and [[Soulfilled Construct]]s (6%).

The baron is in the center of the area, same as before. Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Baron Halis|Ah, the errant corpses have returned. Time to harvest your parts!}}

Kill the Baron and get to 100% on the progress bar, then exit to the southeast:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|Quickly, up the hill!}}

The construct automatically turns northeast and runs up the small path to [[Spider's Watch]], where it drops off its passengers. In front of Thales and Mevix is the [[Rune of Might]].
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|I feel... power... thrumming in the air...}}

Interact with it and another small cutscene plays, with the player brandishing the [[Blade of the Primus]] with a rune above it.
:{{text|whisper|Voice of the Primus|The might to crush your foes.}}

On the other side of the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|That blade... it was forged by the [[Primus]]!}}

==Progression==
{{House of Constructs}}

;Objectives
*Rune of Banded Strength

;Description
I can sense [[kyrian]] [[soul]]s in a great deal of confusion and pain. I believe this creature was created incorrectly. Somehow fragments of the souls it was made from, remain bound within the flesh construct.

We can not destroy it, we must save it, and with it save ourselves.

I will calm it, while you try to direct its actions.

;Progress
Yes?

;Completion
We escaped!

I think we'll lay low here for a while. At least until we figure out how to get back to [[Bastion]].

Thank you for showing me what courage is, friend.
