Slay Charthox in the [[Dredgewood]] of [[Revendreth]].
*Recruit [[Guillotine]]
*[[Charthox]] slain
*[[Call Guillotine]] (provided)

==Description==
Idle hands are a wasted opportunity. I need to keep my hands busy, or else these blades wouldn't be worth anything!

I hear there's a [[devourer]] in Revendreth that's as tall as a house. Let's show the other constructs a thing or two by taking that monster out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Superior Parts

==Progress==
Did you kill it?

==Completion==
Good work, both of you!

Guillotine's efforts have not gone unnoticed. I've seen the others redouble their efforts to follow her example.

Thank you both, again.
