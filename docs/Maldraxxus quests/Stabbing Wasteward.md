==Objectives==
Slay the Satiated Sawtooth.
* [[Satiated Sawtooth]] slain

==Description==
I've been finding a lot of [[tauralus]] corpses lately, and I know it's all because those bonetooths [[Caleesy]] loves so much!

I spotted the one that's responsible for the slaughter just west of here. Get rid of it!

And don't mention this to Caleesy!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|15|30}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
I hope you put an end to that creature.

==Completion==
You've done fine work! Just don't tell Caleesy about it.

==Progression==
{{Wasteland Work}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
A lot of [[Tauralus|Taularus]]{{sic}} have been turning up dead. I know it's all those flying creatures [[Caleesy]] loves so much!
