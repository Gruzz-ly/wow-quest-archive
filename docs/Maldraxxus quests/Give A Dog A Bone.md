==Objectives==
Collect 12 Marrowgrub Flesh from [[Giant Marrowgrub]]s.
* [[Marrowgrub Flesh]] (12)
* [[Tasty Bone]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Louison]] lent me [[Dog Bone]] to help uncover some marrowgrubs, but I'm busy here with the stoves. Could you be a dear and go hunting for me?

Dog Bone loves to pounce on the smaller nibblers, and makes a lot of noise doing it. That'll scare the larger marrowgrubs into making a run for it. That's when you'll need to make your move.

Just use this bone to lure Dog Bone near the nibblers. Oh, and don't forget to harvest the flesh from the marrowgrubs! That's what you're really after.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

==Criteria of==
*[[Abominable Lives]]

==Notes and trivia==
Throw the bone at [[Marrowgrub Nibbler]]s around the eastern half of the Theater of Pain. [[Dog Bone]] will run to retrieve the bone and then [[Giant Marrowgrub]]s spawn that drop Marrowgrub Flesh.
