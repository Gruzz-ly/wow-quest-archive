==Objectives==
Find someone at the [[Challenger's Promenade]] who has enhancement potions.

==Description==
I've conceived a task befitting of your "talents".

Have you heard of the [[House of Plagues|House of Plague]]{{sic}}? Crafters of toxins and potions. They suffered a tragic accident--a true, true shame.

Herein lies the problem: I have long used the work of the plague devisers to bolster my arena performance. Without a potion of their creation, I'd find the fight unnecessarily taxing.

The [[broker]]s do have such potions, but they "do not like my face." Could you obtain such a potion for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|45|70}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I know Scrapper Minoire sent you. She always enhances herself to win the fight.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Scrapper Minoire|Make haste--I can promise great rewards if you deliver my potion swiftly.}}

You can speak with the scrapper again for additional gossip:
:You have deemed yourself worthy of my attention?

:{{Gossip|Isn't this cheating?}}
::Oh, how very sweet... You truly are one of [[Draka]]'s little pets.

::There is no concept of "cheating" in [[Maldraxxus]]. One wins, or one loses--nothing else matters.

::The means are irrelevant. Victory is the goal, and one must not let the biases of morality impede that goal.

::Now run along, fetch my potion. Then you can tell Draka you've done a good deed today.

:{{Text|Say|[[Au'narim]]|The Maw Walker to the rescue! I am betting on your success in this matter.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[So'narynar]]|This one could bring us profit.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Au'larrynar]]|Perhaps a chance to recoup some of our losses.}}
