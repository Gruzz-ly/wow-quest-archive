==Objectives==
Find [[Echthra]] in the [[House of Eyes]] in [[Maldraxxus]].
* [[Anointment Oil (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
Echthra has taken residence in one of the few remaining structures in the former House of Eyes in Maldraxxus.

Bring the anointment oil to her, and she should allow you to capture her memory. Take caution, for she is well-known both as a master marksman and--perhaps more notably--for her quick trigger finger.

Good luck, [[Maw Walker]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Be cautious. There are many in the [[House of Eyes]] who would not tolerate your presence.

==Completion==
Let us have words quickly--before I change my mind.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{text|say|Echthra|Who dares enter my domain?}}
:{{text|yell|Echthra|That is far enough!}}
The player is stunned, poisoned, and two nearby [[Seething Deadeye]]s with guns aim at you.
:{{text|say|Echthra|Wait... hold fire! I know of this one.}}
:{{text|say|Echthra|Come--I shall give you a chance to explain why you have entered my lair.}}
