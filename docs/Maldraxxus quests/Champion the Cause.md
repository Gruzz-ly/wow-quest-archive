==Objectives==
[[File:Champion Rin'mar.jpg|thumb|upright|Champion Rin'mar]]
Slay Champion Rin'mar and Champion Gutrend.
* [[Champion Gutrend]] slain {{co|49.1|47.8|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Champion Rin'mar]] slain {{co|51.8|46.6|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
Now you're starting to show potential! I'm guessing your name was well known on [[Azeroth|whatever mortal world you hail from]].

But don't rest on your laurels. The harder you fight, the harder others will strive to strike you down. That's the Maldraxxi way!

Nothing wins the favor of the crowd like taking down a former champion. Two are in attendance today, attempting to recapture their past glories.

Slaughter them!

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
Good, the crowd's on your side.

Now there's just one last test.

==Notes==
Look for the two named elites, Gutrend and Rin'mar. Same as before, use the other NPCs (and players!) in the area to distract the quest targets.

On complete, a brief cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Grandmaster Vole|Clear the arena! The final clash is about to begin!}}

When the cutscene ends, all of the combatants have disappeared from the Theater, and [[High Champion Meskal]] now stands at the far end of the arena floor.

==Progression==
{{Champion of Pain}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section}}
;Description
For a [[mortal]] you sure have a [[Maldraxxus|Maldraxxi]] spirit! I'm guessing your name is well known on whatever world you came from.

A few individuals have been standing out from the crowd. They are one of your last obstacles for claiming glory.
