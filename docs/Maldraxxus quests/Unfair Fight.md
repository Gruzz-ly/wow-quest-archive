==Objectives==
Prove your strength to Fightlord San.
*Speak to [[Fightlord San]] to begin combat
*[[Frisson]] defeated

==Description==
A cowardly pest that cheats his way out of the glory of death? Bah!

I have something that'll cut him down where he stands. But such an enhancement requires one who is strong enough to wield it properly.

Show me your mettle and fight! If you can prove yourself, I'll empower that ranseur of yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
You want to prove yourself, don't you?

==Completion==
Here, take the power we've honed and use it to defeat your hardest-to-kill enemies.

If [[Vorath|that san'layn]] ever shows up here, well... he'll have an appropriately warm welcome.

==Notes==

;Speaking with San

Attack Frisson. Salandria buffs the player with Blessing of Might, and her Retribution aura also applies to the player character.
