'''If You Want Peace...''' begins the [[Maldraxxus storyline]].

==Objectives==
Enter [[Maldraxxus]].
* Speak to [[Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi|Roh-Avonavi]] to Travel to Maldraxxus {{co|62.0|32.9|Oribos|1}}

==Description==
Maldraxxus is a land which revels in strife and conflict. But they should also be bound by honor.

If their honor has been tossed aside, then they may move their forces beyond just [[Bastion]].

Take care, danger lies beyond that gate. It is a [[Plane|realm]] of heroes as well as a realm of villains.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|41|}}
* 890 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well? Why aren't you out there fighting?

==Notes==
Speak with [[Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi]]:
:The way is open. You may now pass through to Maldraxxus.
:{{gossip|I am ready. Send me to Maldraxxus.}}

On the other side, players land in an alcove on the northern side of the [[Theater of Pain]]. Head in and speak with [[Grandmaster Vole]]:
:{{text|say|Grandmaster Vole|Keep training! If you want to fight, then prove your strength!}}
:{{text|say|Grandmaster Vole|Maldraxxi! Why are you still in here? Grab a blade and enter the arena!}}

==Progression==
{{Champion of Pain}}
