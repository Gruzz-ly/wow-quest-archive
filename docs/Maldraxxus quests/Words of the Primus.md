==Objectives==
Return to [[Oribos]].

==Description==
Even in his absence, the wisdom of the [[Primus]] rings true. This message must have been put here to await one who proved worthy of hearing it.

<Draka peers at you.>

You came to [[Maldraxxus]] to learn why [[Bastion]] was invaded. Now you know that there is treachery in our ranks. And that there are noble souls here who will set things right.

Tell your allies in Oribos all you have witnessed. See that the warning of the Primus reaches the [[Eternal Ones]].

It would be an honor to fight by your side again, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|45|70}}
* 940 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am glad of your return, mortal.

I pray you were successful in preventing the advent of war between Bastion and Maldraxxus.
