==Objectives==
[[File:Draka's Flayedwing.jpg|thumb|Draka and the player flying to the Seat]]
Go with Draka to the Seat of the Primus.
* Fly with [[Draka]] to the [[Seat of the Primus]] {{co|37.1|68.4|Maldraxxus}}
* Empower the Rune of Ambition {{co|50.4|67.7|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
This cannot be a coincidence. It is clear that [[Blade of the Primus|your runeblade]] is somehow connected to the Seat of the Primus.

I will not pretend to know the [[Primus]]'s agenda. But I would not be surprised if he left behind a way for the worthy to open the door to his sanctum.

Draka will bring you to the Seat of the Primus. If you hold the key, mortal, then our victory is all but assured.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bonefused Shortsword
|Bonefused Bonesaw
|Bonefused Sword
|Bonefused Shank
|Bonefused Greatsword
|Bonefused Crusher
|Bonefused Greatstaff
|Bonefused Crossbow
|Bonefused Warblade
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|12|16|80}}
* 3,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What is it?

==Completion==
We cannot lose sight of the battles ahead of us. The door will have to wait.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Margrave Krexus|Vyraz, Draka. Bring the mortal to the Seat of the Primus. Let us see what unfolds.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|I will scout ahead. Do not tarry, soldier!}}
:''Vyraz mounts up on a [[flayedwing]] and flies away.''

Speak with Draka:
:Maldraxxus will stand united again.
:{{gossip|I'm ready. Let's fly to the Seat of the Primus.}}

Draka and the player jump up on [[Draka's Flayedwing]] and fly out of the necropolis.
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|The Seat of the Primus has been locked shut since he went missing. Many have tried to open it.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|The Primus was a legendary weaponsmith. If we hold the key to his vault, then his arsenal will be ours.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|It won't be long before the other houses learn of the blade. Be ready for a fight.}}

Draka drops off the player next to Vyraz at the [[Bleak Redoubt]]. Stand in the glowing green circle between them and use the bonus ability: {{Abilities|Resonate|Let your runeblade resonate with the Seat of the Primus.|icon=spell_animamaldraxxus_buff|id=333335}}

Another cutscene plays, showing the player brandishing the [[Blade of the Primus]] and causing one of the five runes on the [[Sanctum Door]] to light up:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Krexus was right. We hold the key to the Seat of the Primus!}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|It will do us no good if our house falls in battle first. We must not lose focus on the war.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Report to the [[Spearhead (Maldraxxus)|Spearhead]], recruit. We have a battle to win!}}
:''Vyraz mounts his flayedwing again and leaves.''

This concludes the "House of the Chosen" chapter of the [[Maldraxxus storyline]]. The campaign continues with a three-way fork: [[A Common Peril]], [[The House of Plagues]], and [[Baron of the Chosen]]. 

==Progression==
{{House of the Chosen}}

== Trivia ==
At the beginning of ''Shadowlands'', Vyraz used a regular flayedwing which in comparison was comically small for his size, but this was later appropriately enlarged to match.

==Beta version==

;Description
We have little time.

The other houses will soon discover this revelation. Go with Draka to the Seat of the Primus.

If what I believe is true, we will have our last hope.

;Completion
As much as I'd like to open this door right now, we have more urgent problems.

;Draka's gossip text
:Maldraxxus will be whole again.
