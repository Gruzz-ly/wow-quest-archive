==Objectives==
Follow [[Ve'nari]].
*Orb of Teleportation

==Description==
So, mortal, you are here looking for someone. Well it just so happens that, clever as I am, it's quite possible I know where they are.

Allow me to propose a trade. [[Amulet of the Horsemen|That amulet]] you carry... it holds an interesting power.

You give me the amulet, and I will help you find this [[Alexandros Mograine|Maldraxxi baron]].

And then you will leave. I don't mean to be rude, but I really prefer to keep a low profile.

Allow me to speed things along.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|45|70}}
* 920 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Keep up. We have little time.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I have picked up a few tricks to help me survive here. [[The Jailer]] will [[Eye of the Jailer|take notice]] if you engage his forces, so it is wise to go around them whenever possible.}}

The player has the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]] debuff. Interact with the [[Orb of Teleportation (Maw)|Orb of Teleportation]] to zip across to the [[Face of Oblivion]]. Ve'nari and Darion travel across shortly after the player.

==Progression==
{{Ritual for the Damned}}

==Trivia==
*This quest's title is an early hint to the identity of the Maldraxxi baron; "Hope never dies" are the last words spoken by [[Alexandros Mograine]]'s spirit in the [[Dust to Dust (comic)|last issue]] of the ''[[World of Warcraft: Ashbringer|Ashbringer]]'' comic.

==Alpha version==

;Description
That amulet... it holds an interesting power.

While you owe me for saving you, I will not undersell such an artifact. Perhaps we can come to another trade agreement? You are here looking for something or someone. And I might know where they are. If you give me the amulet, I will help you reach your goal.

And then you will leave. I will not have my existence threatened by some unknowing fool.
