==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|name=Marrowjaw|image=Marrowjaw.jpg|text=A captured beast from the House of Constructs. Nigh impossible to subdue.}}
Slay [[Marrowjaw]] and collect an Empowered Bone from its corpse.
* [[Empowered Bones]] {{co|41.4|67.2|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
A potent blade requires potent components. I know of something that would suit our needs.

Recently a monstrosity trained by [[House of Constructs|the constructs]] was snared by our soldiers at the eastern side of [[House of the Chosen (subzone)|our stronghold]]. [[Baron Vyraz|Vyraz]] insists we can siphon "intelligence" from the beast's mind.

Hmph. The will of the [[Primus]] trumps the desires of an ambitious baron!

The bones of that beast would forge the perfect hilt for this blade. I say you lay claim to them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 8,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Brave enough to manage this?

==Completion==
Good! I knew that beast would prove no challenge for you.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Nothing is given. Everything is earned. That includes the materials for your hilt.}}

[[Marrowjaw]] is found to the northeast of Heirmir on the [[Unfallen's Sanctum]], trapped in a rune at half health. Defeat it and return to Heirmir.

==Progression==
{{House of the Chosen}}

==Alpha version==

*Name: '''A Trial of Terror'''.
;Description
A powerful blade takes powerful parts. As fate would have, I know the place to get some material.

Our [[soldier]]s snared a construct beast on the eastern side of the house. I been wanting its bones, but that [[Baron Vyraz|Vyraz]] claims we can siphon "intelligence" from the beast's mind!

Might as well ask [[Margrave Gharmal]] themself to bend knee--you'd have the same luck!

But the bones of that beast will forge the perfect hilt for this blade. I say this matters more than the ego of stubborn warlords!
