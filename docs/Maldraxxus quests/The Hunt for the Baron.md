==Objectives==
Charge the Amulet of the Horsemen.
* [[:Amulet of the Horsemen]] charged

==Description==
<The amulet [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]] gave you flickers with a faint red light, then grows dim.

To be useful in finding [[Darion Mograine]], you must find a way to restore its potency.

You recall an area called [[Zovaal's Cauldron]] that was teeming with dark magic.

Perhaps the amulet's power could be restored there.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|57|}}
* 7,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The amulet glows red.>

==Notes==
It turns out players landed near the [[Waystone to Oribos]], when they escaped from the Maw in [[Stand as One]]. Head downhill into [[Zovaal's Cauldron]] and start killing to fill the progress bar. Any mob in the area counts. The bar's tooltip reads: "Charging Bolvar's amulet. Kill [[mawsworn]] within the Cauldron to siphon their essence."

==Progression==
{{Ritual for the Damned}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section}}
;Description
<The amulet [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]] gave you glows with a faint red light before dimming again.

The amulet is imbued with similar [[magic]] to the creatures around [[Zovaal's Cauldron]]. Killing them may give the enchantment energy.>
