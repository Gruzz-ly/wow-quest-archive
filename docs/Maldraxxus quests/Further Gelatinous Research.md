*{{cost|272|18}}

==Notes==
Speak to [[Project Lead Allen]] to obtain the accumulator.
:Hello! Plague Deviser Marileth has sent me out here to test this equipment. We're gathering the living slimes in this area. Or samples of them at least. Want to help?
:{{gossip|I will assist you.}}

While you have an accumulator, the area's usual mobs will be replaced with slimes, which spawn 1 to 3 [[Slimelet]]s when killed. Use the accumulator to gather the little guys up.
