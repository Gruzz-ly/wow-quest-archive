==Objectives==
Collect 6 [[Anima]] Vials from the [[Arena Spectator (Maldraxxus)|arena spectators]].
* [[Anima Vial]] (6)

==Description==
I run a myriad of businesses here. Betting rings, performance enhancers... whatever the customer is willing to purchase.

However, a few of those customers are late with their payments. And a customer who does not pay is a customer without value.

Please ask them to surrender what they owe. I trust you know what to do if they refuse.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|85|50}}
* 7,350 [[XP]]
* +135 [[reputation]] with the [[Undying Army]]

==Progress==
Do not try to cheat me out of anything I am owed. I will know.

==Completion==
Yes, you are more valuable than I first surmised.

==Notes==
;Talk to Arena Spectators
What do you want?

{{Gossip|Au'narim claims you owe her anima.}}

''Spectators will then either get rowdy or comply.''

;Description
I run a myriad of businesses here, betting rings, performance enhancers... whatever the customer is willing to pay for.

A few of those customers are late on their anima payments and I could use some help with retrieval.

If they don't pay up front, then, well you know what to do.
