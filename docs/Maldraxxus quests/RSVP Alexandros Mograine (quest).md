==Objectives==
Collect 9 Ossein Staves and 3 Ossen Battleaxes from the [[Ossein Foundry]].
* [[Ossein Staff]] (9)
* [[Ossein Battleaxe]] (3)

==Description==
It would be an honor to represent [[Maldraxxus]] at the [[Ember Court]] of [[Prince Renathal]].

But before I leave my post, I must ensure my comrades will be safe while I am away.

Fight your way into the Ossein Foundry and retrieve weapons from our rivals there.

I will have them distributed among the troops while I make ready to depart.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +300 reputation with [[Alexandros Mograine]]

A strong advantage. We gain additional arms and deprive our foes of the same.
