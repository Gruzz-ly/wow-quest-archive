==Objectives==
Collect 4 Maldraxxi Bone Marrow.
* [[Maldraxxi Bone Marrow]] (4)

==Description==
I want to cook something warm, savory, and gooey! 

That's right! I want to make a lovely bone marrow pie! When it's done, you'll be as full as a tick. I guarantee it! 

Now, just any old marrow won't do. I need the very best and rarest marrow. 

And that's where you come in! I need you to help Mama out and dig that marrow up. Yes... dig. 

Oh and be ready to knock some heads. Maldraxxus doesn't take kindly to being carved up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]

==Progress==
Is there any kind of pie that's not just the best? Blood pie, bone marrow pie, bone marrow jelly...

==Completion==
Well, if this isn't the best batch of marrow I've ever seen!

Mama is going to cook you a feast today!

==Criteria of==
*[[Abominable Lives]]

We make [[Tauralus|Tarualus]]{{sic}} Bone Marrow normally, but this week is a special occasion!

I want to make a lovely bone marrow pie. Any old marrow won't do! We need the very best and rarest marrow.

That's where you come in! I need you to go to dig it up. Yes dig. It only grows deep in [[Maldraxxus]]. Be prepared for a fight. Maldraxxus is alive, in some sense of the word. It doesn't like having it's{{sic}} pieces removed.
