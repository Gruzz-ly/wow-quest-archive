==Objectives==
Collect [[Volumes of Victory]]{{Sic}}
* Several volumes collected (5)
* More Volumes taken (72)

==Description==
This is only volume one?

We can't just take the first volume. A rare item like this is only useful if it's in a complete set!

Grab as many of the other volumes as you can, I will have to prepare a larger expedition to remove all of these volumes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|36|50|40}}
* 12,500 [[XP]]
* +135 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
Did we get all the volumes?

==Completion==
So much valuable knowledge saved, and it would not have happened without your help.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|I can't tell you how grateful I am to have your help acquiring these additional volumes.}}

Loot five [[Volume of Victory (item)]] from [[Volumes of Victory: Vol 38]], [[Volumes of Victory: Vol 49]], [[Volumes of Victory: Vol 52]], [[Volumes of Victory: Vol 98]], [[Volumes of Victory: Vol 102]], and [[Volumes of Victory: Vol 583]], scattered around the room. Once all five have been collected:
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|No, no, this won't do. I must have them all! An opportunity like this may not come again.}}

Now start looting [[Additional Volumes of Victory]] from the [[Additional Volumes]] lying in stacks on the floor and the Additional Volumes of Victory objects flying around near the ceiling. Each object contains 6-8 volumes. Once you have all 72, turn in to Ta'eran.

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Ta'eran|This has been a most profitable venture, <name>. I do hope we work together again in future endeavors.}}
:''Ta'eran walks up to the [[Library Teleporter]] and despawns.''

This concludes the "Archival Protection" chapter of [[Sojourner of Maldraxxus]]. Use the Library Teleporter to get back to the surface.
