==Objectives==
[[File:Animated Flesh.jpg|thumb|upright|Animated Flesh]]
Collect 40 Pulsating Hide Scraps from [[Overgrown Mass]]es.
* [[Pulsating Hide Scraps]] (40)

==Description==
The [[Primus]] forged a fine blade, but it will do you no good in its current state.

Fortunately for you, I possess the skill to finish his work!

That being said, I will require materials. The other [[House of the Chosen|Chosen]] have been too preoccupied with their combat drills to assist me at the forge, even as they demand more weapons and armor.

That's where you come in. You want a new blade? You'll have to earn it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Corpse-Stitcher's Leggings
|Flesh Architect's Leggings
|Deceitful Agent's Breeches
|Cruel Executioner's Legguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 8,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Can't be that difficult, can it?

==Completion==
You work quickly, don't you? I could use more assistants like you.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Nothing is given. Everything is earned. That includes the materials for your hilt.}}

Blobs of [[Overgrown Mass]] will spawn an [[Animated Flesh]] mob or two. Defeat it to loot 4-6 Pulsating Hides.

==Progression==
{{House of the Chosen}}

;Description
That's a fine blade, but it's nowhere near the power it could possess.

Count yourself lucky you found the best [[smith]] in all [[Plane|realms]]!

If this blade is to reach its full potential, I'll need plenty of supplies. Been awful dry at the forge without helpers around.

S'pose that's where you come in! You want this sword finished, you bring me some pulsating hides to get the job done!

;Completion
You work quick! Been a while since I had reliable help.
