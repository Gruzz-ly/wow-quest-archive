==Objectives==
Collect 8 jars of Maldracite Dust.
* [[Maldracite Dust]] (8)
*Bring the Maldracite Dust to Baroness Vashj at the ritual site.

==Description==
It would seem we have a means of luring [[Mor'Bitan]] to us. But what good is a web if the prey can run free?

For these rituals to work, the [[lich]]es require a [[magic]]al conduit. They draw [[rune]]s with finely ground [[maldracite]] to channel [[anima]].

I have no doubt Mor'Bitan's [[Maldraxxi necromancer|necromancers]] have ground maldracite in the area. If we gather enough, we can draw a rune of binding to trap our target.

Work with haste, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm waiting.

==Completion==
He will not escape this time.

==Notes==
On accept of both of Vashj's quests:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|I will await you at the ritual site to the north. Work quickly.}}

Pick up [[Vaunted Vengeance]] from [[Khaliiq]] before getting started.

Interact with the three anima crystals to acquire the [[Fractured Anima Crystal]]. Head east into [[Glutharn's Decay]], kill [[Morbid Ritualist]]s, and use the quest item on their corpses. [[Jar of Ground Maldracite|Jars of Ground Maldracite]] litter the quest area. Watch out for the [[Morbid Boneguard]]s! The named quest mobs also count as valid corpses for Tainted Cores.

Find Vashj and Khaliiq to the northeast on the [[Rotting Mound]]:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|This area is secure. Do you have what we require?}}
