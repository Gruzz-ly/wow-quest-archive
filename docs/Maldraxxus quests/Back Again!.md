Defeat Gorgantus the Gutter

Gorgantus just won't give up!

We've defeated her several times already, but the scavengers salvage the body, fix her up and send her right back in here!

She thinks this time she will defeat us... prove her wrong.

* 8,150 [[XP]]
*3x [[Grateful Offering]]

One from the potential rewards:
*Anima item
*[[Flame of Battle]]

==Progress==
Did you deal with her?

==Completion==
You made that look easy. Let's hope she learned his lesson this time.
