==Objectives==
Help Gas Bag collect Rotbloom Petals.
*Recruit [[Gas Bag|Gasbag]]{{sic}} (Optional)
*[[Rotbloom Petal]] (18)
*[[Call Gas Bag]] (provided)

==Description==
My gas is the most potent in all of [[Maldraxxus]], but I've heard some of the others saying my gas isn't the strongest in the [[Shadowlands]].

They claim there are some plants in [[Ardenweald]] with a bloom that is far more pungent than my gas. Nonsense!

Let's go and check these plants out. If their stench is as strong as the stories claim, I might even be able to mix them in with my own gas!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 7,100 [[XP]]
* +750 [[reputation]] with [[Stitchmasters]]
