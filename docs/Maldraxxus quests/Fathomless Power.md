==Objectives==
Meet [[Plague Deviser Marileth|Marileth]] at the [[Seat of the Primus]].
* Empower Rune of Insight {{co|50.4|67.7|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
Forgive me, apprentice... I felt a bit woozy for a moment! But you've done it! You've crafted the potion!

I'm so proud of you. What joy your work brought to [[Margrave Stradama|our margrave]]!

What manner of teacher would I be were I to ask for your help and not offer my own in return? If you have research you must conduct, you have my full support!

Let us venture to your laboratory, then. I wait with bated breath to behold your future achievements!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|16|80}}
* 910 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see you've made a new ally... of a sort. And another rune has been empowered.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|I'd be delighted to help you with your own project! I'll meet you soon, my apprentice.}}

No need to return to the [[Bleak Redoubt]] if the other two quest chains aren't complete yet.

At the redoubt, between Marileth and Draka (and [[Kevin]]) is the green circle. Stand in it and use the bonus ability again. Another cutscene plays. Turn in to Draka.

:{{Text|emote|Plague Deviser Marileth applauds your hard work.}}

This concludes the "House of Plagues" chapter of the [[Maldraxxus storyline]]. Draka previously started [[A Common Peril]] and [[Baron of the Chosen]], which started two other forks of the campaign. Complete all three forks to continue.

Once all three forks are complete, Draka will continue the Maldraxxus campaign with [[Among the Chosen]].
