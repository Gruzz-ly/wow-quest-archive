==Objectives==
Defeat 30 contenders in the [[Theater of Pain]].
* Competitors defeated (30)

==Description==
What's this? You fly no colors! Where is the pride in your house, gladiator?

Bah, this drought has left us with slim pickings indeed, if this is the best [[Maldraxxus]] can muster!

I remember the old days. The strongest souls arriving, then being divided among the five houses...

No matter. [[Contest of Conquest|The tournament]] beckons. Enter the arena! Fight for glory!

By the look of you, it's likely you won't last long. Try to make a name for yourself in the time you have left.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What are you waiting for? Put on a show!

==Completion==
You survived? Really...

I admit, that was unexpected.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Grandmaster Vole|Fight well! All of Maldraxxus is watching.}}

Head south into the arena and interact with the Arena Gate to open it. Kill anything that moves, including [[Necromancer Competitor]]s, [[Skeletal Competitor]]s, and [[Construct Competitor]]s. Avoid aggroing the elite champions [[Champion Bloodrot|Bloodrot]], [[Champion Gutrend|Gutrend]], and [[Champion Rin'mar|Rin'mar]].

Every few kills, Vole chimes in with one of the following:
*{{text|say|Grandmaster Vole|A blow well struck!}}
*{{text|say|Grandmaster Vole|Another challenger falls!}}
*{{text|say|Grandmaster Vole|One combatant rises above the rest!}}
*{{text|say|Grandmaster Vole|The strong survive, and the weak are culled!}}

Each time Vole says something, players will be granted a buff (Favor of the Crowd) and a bonus ability that deals point-blank damage to enemies and occasionally has other effects, including:
*{{Abilities|Bladesworn's Favor|icon=inv_sword_1h_pvpdraenors2_d_02|id=326737|Inflicts X Physical damage to enemies within 8 yards.}}
*{{Abilities|Construct's Favor|icon=inv_misc_monsterfang_02|id=326739|Lash out at nearby enemies, inflicting 20 Physical damage to enemies within 8 yards and restoring health for every enemy hit.}}
*{{Abilities|Ritualist's Favor|icon=spell_necro_deathrift|id=326735|Inflicts X Nature damage to enemies within 10 yards of the impact.}}

As you kill enemies, you gain stacks of the Rising Champion buff.

==Progression==
{{Champion of Pain}}
