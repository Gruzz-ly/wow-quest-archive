==Objectives==
[[File:Plague Refuse.jpg|thumb|Plague Refuse]]
Collect 6 pieces of Laboratory Equipment.
*[[Laboratory Equipment]] (6)
*Bring the Laboratory Equipment to Marileth in the House of Plagues.

==Description==
Ah, [[Ooze|slimes]]: the dearest of friends and infinitely useful! They will help us craft our potion.

But it seems our tools have been scattered around, doused in toxic refuse. [[Margrave Stradama]] would be so disappointed at my lack of respect for lab safety!

Your slime can comb through the refuse, diluting the plague's harmful agents. Simply pull the cleaned equipment from the body of your slime!

Slimes... what would we do without them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Has your slime been useful? I'm sure it has!

==Completion==
You and your slime are bonding!

==Notes==
On accept of both of Marileth's quests:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|Meet me in the House of Plagues when you are done, apprentice. Our work continues!}}

Don't forget [[Applied Science]] from [[Marileth's Journal]] before heading out.

Southeast in the Blighted Scar, interact with piles of [[Plague Refuse]] to have the Plagueborn Slime retrieve equipment:
:{{text|emote|Your slime moves towards a pile of refuse!}}
:{{text|emote|Plagueborn Slime dissolves the refuse and finds a piece of lab equipment!}}

Interact with the slime to loot the equipment.

Once all objectives are done, head southwest past the entrance to the [[Plaguefall]] dungeon to reach Marileth atop [[Plague Watch]]:
:{{text|say|Plague Deviser Marileth|This way, my apprentice!}}

==Progression==
{{House of Plagues}}
