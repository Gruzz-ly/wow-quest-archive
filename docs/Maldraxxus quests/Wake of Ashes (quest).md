==Objectives==
Escape from the Maw and report to [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]] in [[Oribos]].
* [[Ve'nari's Portal]]
*Speak with Ve'nari at Ve'nari's Refuge.

==Description==
It feels as if the [[Maw]] itself is sentient... and [[Eye of the Jailer|taking notice]] of our presence.

We must leave at once. Bolvar must be informed of what is happening here.

I will bring my father with us. Lead the way out of here, <name>. With haste.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|28|50}}
* 7,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Now to get you and your... associates out of here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I suggest a tactical retreat. I will take us to a small alcove near [[Waystone to Oribos|the waystone]] that enabled your [[Stand as One|previous exodus]].}}
:''Ve'nari opens [[Ve'nari's Portal]].''
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|Son...}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|Save your strength, father. We will have time to speak later.}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|Wait. My sword... [[Fatebringer]]. I will have need of it soon.}}
:''Alexandros picks up Fatebringer, then takes the portal.''

The portal takes the player and the Mograines to [[Ve'nari's Refuge]]. Despite what the objective says, turn in to Ve'nari.
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I believe this concludes our business arrangement. The waystone is just up that way.}}
