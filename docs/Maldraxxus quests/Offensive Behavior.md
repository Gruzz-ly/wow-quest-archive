==Objectives==
Kill General Alver.
* [[General Alver]] slain {{co|37.3|43.6|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Attack Battlehorn]] (provided)
*Report back to Secutor Mevix.{{sic}} at the forward camp.

==Description==
Fine work <name>. We've advanced with minimal casualties.

From this new forward position, we can strike directly at the enemy commander. The troops you rallied will join the attack. Together, we will bring this battle to a decisive end.

Locate General Alver and sound the horn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Salvaged Mercenary's Drape]]
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Our success depends on you.

==Completion==
Your leadership is inspiring. These troops would follow you anywhere!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|We strike when you sound the horn. For the [[House of the Chosen|Chosen]]!}}

Speak with Mevix again:
:Well fought, <name>! Give the order, and we will launch the next assault!
:{{gossip|How should I signal you?}}
:Scout ahead and locate General Alver. When you are ready, use this horn to signal us to attack.

Head northeast to find Alver. Use the [[Extra Action Button]] to summon a group of [[Boneplated Sharpshooter]]s and [[Boneplated Phalanx]]es:
:{{Abilities|Signal the Attack|id=329006|Signal troops to attack General Alver.|icon=inv_misc_horn_05}}

... then aggro him:
:{{text|say|General Alver|You'll make a fine practice dummy!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|General Alver|But you... are... inferior...}}

Head back to the forward position, where Mevix's troops are rejoicing:
*{{Text|say|Boneplated Phalanx|They were no match for us!}}
*{{Text|say|Boneplated Phalanx|Victory!}}
*{{Text|say|Boneplated Phalanx|We have them on the run!}}

Talk to Mevix to turn in. On complete, Vyraz walks up from the road:
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Well fought, Mevix!}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|This is our chance to strike at the [[House of Constructs]]!}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|A direct assault will catch [[Margrave Gharmal|Gharmal]] unprepared and crush their army in one fell swoop!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|But we need reinforcements!}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Hah! This outsider is worth a hundred soldiers! Go, and claim our victory!}}

Vyraz offers the next quest, [[Army of One]].
