==Objectives==
[[File:Justice from Above.jpg|thumb|upright|Flames of Courage]]
Destroy 5 Maldracite Cores.
* [[Maldracite Core]] destroyed (5)

==Description==
Our forces above cannot fully descend upon this area while the [[Margrave Gharmal|Margrave]]'s crystals cover the sky in destructive blasts.

The Margrave's foul butchers work even now to extract the remaining [[anima]] from the [[kyrian]] they abducted in their assault on [[Bastion]]. We must advance at once.

I shall imbue you with the flames of courage so that you may mark the crystals. Once marked, I will destroy them from afar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must not delay.

==Completion==
You have done a great service here. 

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Xandria|We must join the fight above. May the Flames of Courage guide your blade.}}

In the center of the quest area, look for the [[Tattered Scroll (Maldraxxus)|Tattered Scroll]], which starts [[Dark Developments]].

Cores are all over the area. Interacting with one causes it to be set on fire by the Flames of Courage, after which Xandria descends on and destroys it. Consider dragging a few enemies to a Maldracite Core and interact with it to take advantage of Xandria's one-shot when she destroys the core.

Destroying cores:
*{{Text|say|Xandria|This place shall be purged!}}
:{{Text|say|Xandria|I will break all of you!}}
*{{text|say|Xandria|This ground will be cleansed!}}
*{{text|say|Xandria|My vengeance upon you!}}
*{{text|say|Xandria|This has no place here!}}
*{{text|say|Xandria|Face the wrath of Courage!}}
