==Objectives==
Harvest 8 Stringy Spores.
* [[Stringy Spore]] collected (8)

==Description==
My brightest apprentice, you return to me at last!

You worried me--you see, I heard the loudest clatter while working on one of my experiments... Before I knew it, I was here, and you'd disappeared!

Wherever you went is no matter. You're back now, and we have much to do!

Come, my apprentice--we must fetch our ingredients first.

Can you smell the spores germinating around us? We should pull some up to use in our endeavors!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What marvelous spores have you to show me?

==Completion==
Such marvelous spores, my apprentice!

==Notes==
Pick up both quests, then head southwest into the [[Valley of a Thousand Legs]]. Kill the [[Virulent Pest]]s for their venom sacs, and interact with Stringy Spores, then run away from them to pull them out of the ground.

==Progression==
{{House of Plagues}}
