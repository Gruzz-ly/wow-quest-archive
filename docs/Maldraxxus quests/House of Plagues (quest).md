* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|Before I take my leave, Margrave, may I speak to you concerning the nature of [[undeath]]?}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|You will find no one with greater knowledge on the subject than I, mortal. Proceed.}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|The [[Forsaken]] were raised through [[necromancy]], and this shared origin has provided them a sense of unity.}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|I, however, was raised by the [[Light]]. That difference has caused me to wonder if I can ever truly find a place among them.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|Necromancy is the art of animating unliving flesh. Here in [[Maldraxxus]], we use the [[magic]] of [[Death]] to accomplish our craft.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|But whether these rituals are empowered by Death or Light or any other magic, necromancy is necromancy. You perceive a difference where there is none, child.}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|Then perhaps I have found my purpose...}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|Thank you, Margrave. Your perspective has been a great help.}}

;On arrival at the House of Plagues
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|We brought [[Plague Eater|this tiny plague eater]]. Can you make it stronger?}}
