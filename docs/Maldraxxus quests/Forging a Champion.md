==Objectives==
Speak with Bonesmith Heirmir about your runeblade.
* Speak with [[Bonesmith Heirmir]] about your [[runeblade]] {{co|36.4|70.5|Maldraxxus}}
* Convince Bonesmith Heirmir to speak with you

==Description==
Of all the [[soul]]s who have reached that stone, only you discovered its true purpose.

I am no zealot, but clearly there is a deeper meaning in this. We would be wise to investigate further.

Find Bonesmith Heirmir at her [[forge]]. She is the most renowned [[smith]] in [[Maldraxxus]], and the last remaining apprentice of the [[Primus]] himself.

She will know what course to take.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Something else?

==Completion==
This is going to take a bit of work.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Heirmir was once the Primus's apprentice. She might know more about the blade.}}

Loop around to the south and up the hill to find Heirmir:
:Everyone always has need of the forge. New weapons, new armor. They should learn to properly maintain their equipment instead.
:{{gossip|What do you know about this blade?}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Hmph. Can't you see I'm busy?}}

Use the bonus ability: {{Abilities|Listen Up!|Show your blade to get Heirmir's attention.|icon=inv_sword_1h_maldraxxusquest_b_01|id=330552}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Is that... it can't be...}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|So this was the cause of all that commotion. A blade and a message from the Primus himself...}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Hmm. Whatever his reason, a blade's no good without a hilt. Time to get to work.}}

==Progression==
{{House of the Chosen}}

==Beta version==

Heirmir's gossip
:Everyone just wants more armor or more siege weapons. Maybe if we didn't keep goin' to war with ourselves, we'd have better equipment.
