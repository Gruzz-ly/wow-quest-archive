[[Margrave Krexus]] was pleased to hear of your service to our house. He senses great potential within you.

Potential that must be tested.

A stone stands at the center of our citadel, surrounded by magma. Reaching the stone is a challenge of endurance and fortitude.

Go on, then. Prove your worth.

Immediately to the southwest underneath the floating necropolis is a large lava pool. In the center is a small island with a [[Standing Rock]] on it. Just like any lava pool, swimming in it will deal damage, so quickly get to the island. Upon interacting with it, the player is stunned and lifted up into the air for 40 seconds:

A vision of the Primus appears in front of the player as his voice is heard:
:{{text|yell|Voice of the Primus|The realms of Death awash in darkness.}}
:{{text|yell|Voice of the Primus|Treachery begets chaos. Bonds frayed must be restored.}}
:{{text|yell|Voice of the Primus|The key shall honor the worthy.}}
:''The stone shatters, revealing the Unfinished Blade inside.''

Interact with the Unfinished Blade and an Orb of Teleportation appears nearby. Use it to return to the platform, where Draka now stands surrounded by a large number of [[Chosen Protector]]s and [[Chosen Siegecrafter]]s.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|That blade was forged by the Primus! How long has it been hidden in that stone?}}

;Description
I spoke with [[Margrave Krexus]]. He has given me your next trial.

A stone stands in the center of our house, surrounded by a magma fount. Reaching the stone is a great challenge--one many have succumbed to.

We usually reserve the trial for our most renowned souls, but Margrave Krexus has instructed you to attempt the rite immediately.

;After waking up
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|The stone! What did you do?!}}
