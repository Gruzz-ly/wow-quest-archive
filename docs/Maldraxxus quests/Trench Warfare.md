==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|image=Malifis.jpg|name=Malifis|text=Ambient energy left from constant battles has created living masses of necromancy.}}
Use the Baron's Warhorn to defeat Malifis.
* [[Malifis]] slain {{co|44.4|62.5|Maldraxxus}}
*[[Baron's Warhorn]] (provided)

==Description==
These would-be recruits seek a way to prove themselves. Let us give them the chance.

The specter known as Malifis has grown in strength by consuming our [[anima]] reserves. In this time of drought, we cannot afford to lose any of our most precious resource. 

This threat needs to be dealt with immediately.

Use this horn to signal the [[Displaced Scavenger|scavengers we've recruited]]. Let us see how well they fight under [[House of the Chosen|our banner]]!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Reclaimed Maldraxxi Choker
|Maldraxxian Warhorn
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|24|10|20}}
* 8,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Take care, our quarry is formidable.

==Completion==
A threat removed for the House of the Chosen, and new recruits that show potential.

Good work.

==Notes==
Get to within 15 yards of [[Malifis]], then use the quest item to spawn a decent amount of [[Armed Scavenger]]s. Let them tank. Sidestep out of the tornadoes. The quest item has a 15-second cooldown, so feel free to use it again if Malifis is still active.

==Progression==
{{Champion of Pain}}

==Alpha version==

;Description
If these scavengers truly wish to prove themselves, then we will let them.

The specter known as Malifis has overstayed its welcome. If we leave it be, it will no doubt turn to the [[House of the Chosen]] for [[anima]]. It is a threat. One that needs to be dealt with immediately.

Use this horn to signal the scavengers we've recruited. Let them act under their new [[banner]].
