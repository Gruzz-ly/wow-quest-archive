==Objectives==
Save the souls in the Holding Pens.
* [[Kou]] and [[Koa]] saved {{co|36.2|30.6|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Hipokos]] saved {{co|34.9|30.5|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Kynthia]] saved {{co|35.3|28.9|Maldraxxus}}
* [[Secutor Mevix]] saved {{co|35.6|28.1|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
Most of the aspirants were slaughtered and dismembered on arrival. They were the lucky ones. 

The lead surgeon decided that the only things worth taking from me... were my eyes. I was discarded afterward and left to my rot. [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]] save me, the screaming...

I think there are other survivors being held nearby. Can you aid me in freeing them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Only four survivors... I know I should be grateful that there were any at all, but...

What sort of monsters would do this to anyone, let alone to their own people?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|This way! We must free the survivors!}}

Loot [[Prisoner Cage Key]]s from [[Hulking Fleshwarden]]s to open the cages. Each cage will need its own key.

To the southeast are [[Kou]] and [[Koa]], with the latter balancing on the former's shoulders:
:{{text|say|Kou|Can you reach the top?}}
:{{text|say|Koa|Left a bit!}}
:{{text|say|Koa|Left! Right! Your other right!}}

Free them:
:{{text|yell|Kou|Run!}}

[[Hipokos]] is to the south.
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|Hipokos! What... did they do to you? Can you speak?}}
:{{text|emote|Hipokos shakes his head and then points to where his tongue should be.}}

Once freed, Hipokos picks up a nearby inactive [[centurion#Praetor|praetor]] and carries it off.
:{{text|emote|Hipokos hums a noise of thanks.}}

Just north is [[Kynthia]], held by an [[Orb of Power (Maldraxxus)|Orb of Power]]. When freed:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|Kynthia! Thank the Archon!}}
:''Kynthia flies off deeper into the House of Constructs.''
:{{text|say|Kynthia|These monsters will know my wrath!}}

Further north is Mevix:
:{{text|say|Aspirant Thales|A Maldraxxi soldier? They are the enemy!}}

When freed:
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|Good, you're still in one piece!}}
:{{text|say|Secutor Mevix|I'll secure a position outside!}}

==Progression==
{{House of Constructs}}

;Description
When we first were brought here, most of the aspirants were killed outright. They were the lucky ones. The lead surgeon decided that the only thing worth taking from me was my eyes. I've been left out to just fade away. [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Archon]] save me, there's been so much screaming!

Based on the noises, I think we're next to some sort of holding cells. Perhaps there are still survivors inside. Can you aid me in freeing them?
