==Objectives==
Kill 20 warriors of the House of the Chosen.
*[[House of the Chosen]] [[warrior]]s slain (20)

==Description==
The stronger members of the House of the Chosen tend to take a fairly specific form. No doubt you've seen the larger warriors in the house?

They are the greatest threat in their collective force. Thin them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*3x [[Grateful Offering]]

One from the potential rewards:
*{{cost|293|83}}
*X Anima item (35)

==Progress==
Did you finish the deed?

==Completion==
I must thank you. We are no match for the Chosen when it comes to brute strength.

==Notes==
The warriors refer to [[Maldraxxi gladiator]]s, so any at the [[House of the Chosen (subzone)|House of the Chosen]] and [[Ossein Foundry]] count.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
