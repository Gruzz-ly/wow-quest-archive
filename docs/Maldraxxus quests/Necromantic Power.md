==Objectives==
Charge the Soulseeker Crystal by defeating foes in the [[House of Rituals]], then use it to find [[Thran'tiok]]'s [[phylactery]].
* [[Soulseeker Crystal]] charged
* [[Phylactery of Pain|Phylactery]] located

==Description==
My old master, Thran'tiok, is the epitome of paranoia. She believes everybody will turn on her, and it led to my exilement from not only her service, but the [[House of Rituals]] as a whole.

I had no intent to cross her... but that has changed.

Take the crystal casing you have built and slay my old colleagues to infuse it with [[necromantic]] energy. It shall lead you to Thran'tiok's phylactery, which should be exactly what we both seek.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Thran'tiok thinks I am a threat...

I will show her what that word truly means.

==Completion==
We do not have much time. Thran'tiok will appear herself soon.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Karaxi the Defector|Thran'tiok hid her phylactery outside of the House of Rituals after it was discovered. You must find it... for the both of us.}}

To charge the bar of the crystal, kill [[Stitched Abomination]]s, [[Animated Drudge]]s, [[Lichsworn Guardian]]s, [[Necrotic Sorcerer]]s, [[Necrotic Acolyte]]s, and [[Lichsworn Failures]].

When done, Necromantic Trail extra action button appears to show a green trail to the phylactery. Entering a building at the [[Forgotten Wounds]], an [[Image of Thran'tiok]] appears and immobilizes the Maw Walker.
