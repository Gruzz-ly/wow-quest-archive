==Objectives==
Collect 15 animated catalysts from the [[slime]] around [[Maldraxxus]].
*[[Animated Catalyst]] (15)

==Description==
The living slime within naturally produces a powerful catalyst used in many of the [[House of Eyes]]'s poisons. There is always a need for the substance.

It would be of great help if you could retrieve some for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
*3x [[Grateful Offering]]

One from the potential rewards:
*[[Gorewrought Drape]]
*[[Corpsehide Breeches]]
*{{Cost|300|17}} (replaces the base gold reward)

==Progress==
Worry not, despite its appearance the catalyst is not toxic on its own.

==Completion==
A respectable amount. We will make good use of this.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
