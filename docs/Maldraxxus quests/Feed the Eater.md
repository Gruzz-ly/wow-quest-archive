==Objectives==
Slay [[Ooze|Slimes]] and Plaguerocs in the House of Plagues.
*[[House of Plagues (subzone)|House of Plagues]] cleared (0/100%)
*Meet Calia Menethil deeper in the House of Plagues.

==Description==
The House of Plagues has suffered calamity, much like [[Lordaeron]]. I hope that our work and effort here will reverse some of that destruction.

But first, we must reach farther into the House of Plagues so we can strengthen the capabilities of [[Faranell]]'s [[Plague Eater|plague eater]].

Any slime or creature you slay will surely help it gain fortitude.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
We all have something we can contribute.

==Completion==
The Plague Eater is looking so much stronger already. I think [[Master Apothecary Faranell]] would be pleased.

==Notes==
On accept, Calia casts Holy Shield on the player character.

Kill [[Concentrated Plague]]s, [[Undiluted Plague]]s, and [[Plagueroc]]s.

==Progression==
{{Return to Lordaeron}}
