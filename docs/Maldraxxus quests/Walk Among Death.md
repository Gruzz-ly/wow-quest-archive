==Objectives==
Kill 8 Unbound Deathwalkers.
* [[Unbound Deathwalker]] slain (8)

==Description==
[[Iron Trench|This trench]] echoes with necromantic energies unleashed in the countless battles waged here. That power has coalesced into chaotic entities we call [[deathwalker]]s.

In simpler times, we would have sent troops out to subdue them to serve the [[House of the Chosen]]. But with war brewing, there is no time for that.

Eliminate this potential threat, before our enemies turn them against us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Everything in this land is dangerous. There is no room for weakness.

==Progression==
{{Champion of Pain}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section}}
;Description
The [[anima]] left from the battles here has slowly coalesced into chaotic entities we call [[deathwalker]]s. With the recent shortages within the [[Shadowlands]], they have strayed further from their original sources. If we can slay some of them here, it will help the [[House of the Chosen]].
