==Description==
Come closer, my apprentice... I have a mission of dire import!

A [[Maldraxxi necromancer|necromancer]] came to our house recently, sent by the [[lich]] [[Margrave Sin'dane]]! He seemed so polite, always eager to lend a hand in [[Margrave Stradama|my lady]]'s most volatile creations.

But I grew wise, my apprentice. The way he skulked around, prodding for our most sensitive experiments...

He was trying to steal our [[Ooze|slimes]]! I know it!

You should admonish him quite harshly. Show that no harm will come to our friends!
