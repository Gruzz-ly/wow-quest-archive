==Objectives==
Collect 6 Stitchflesh Designs.
* [[Stitchflesh Design]] (6)

==Description==
The scroll you recovered details all manner of horrific ways to 'integrate' fallen [[kyrian]] into [[Margrave Gharmal|Gharmal]]'s [[abomination]] constructs.

It is also incomplete. There must be more of these among [[Surgeon Stitchflesh|Stitchflesh]]'s remaining followers.

I saw a number of surgeons and their lackeys retreat into the [[Hall of Chains]] just ahead as we arrived. I suspect they hold more of these scrolls.

We must ensure they are never read again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This foul work must be destroyed. 

==Completion==
Well done. I will see that these are destroyed personally. 

==Notes==
Most mobs in the area have a chance of dropping the quest items.

When you return, the NPCs around Xandria are now all standing in combat positions, and [[Kynthia]] is standing in front of the Paragon:
