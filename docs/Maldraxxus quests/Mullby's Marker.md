==Objectives==
Return the marker to the [[Challenger's Promenade]] in [[Maldraxxus]].
* [[Marcel Mullby's Marker]] (provided)

==Description==
The Marker looks like it might be important to this [[Marcel Mullby|Mulby]] fellow. Returning it to him in Maldraxxus might net you a finder's fee.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|82|36|80}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have something for me? Oh my!

<In a quieter voice.>

How did you get this? Of course I will compensate you for bringing it back to me, that [[Grandmaster Vole]] would not have parted with it until he rung me dry. You have no idea what you saved me from.

Oh, can you not mention this to [[Elsie Mullby|Elsie]], she would never let me hear the end of it, I swear my betting days are over.
