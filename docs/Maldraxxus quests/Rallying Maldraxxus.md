==Objectives==
Aid [[Maldraxxus]] by completing Side Quests, Bonus Objectives, World Quests, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in Maldraxxus dungeons.
*Aid the [[Necrolord Covenant|Necrolords]]

==Description==
We need all the help we can get! It's taking all we have to hold our ground against the other houses, let alone gain any ground against them.

Truth be told, your blade will be welcome anywhere. There are no shortage of battles to be won, foes to be toppled, or weary soldiers to be relieved.

Help us regain control of Maldraxxus, and in the name of the [[Primus]] I will see you are amply rewarded.

==Progress==
Fight well. For honor and glory!

==Completion==
All who have reported back to me have said the same--you have brought victory upon victory to the [[House of the Chosen]]!

On behalf of all who serve the [[Primus]], you have my eternal gratitude.

==Notes==
*For [[Necrolord Covenant]] members, [[Secutor Mevix]] is inside the [[Seat of the Primus]]. For all other players, he's outside at the [[Bleak Redoubt]].
