==Objectives==
[[File:Displaced Scavenger.jpg|thumb|upright|Displaced Scavenger]]
Arm 8 Displaced Scavengers with weaponry scattered around the [[Iron Trench]].
* [[Displaced Scavenger]]s armed (8)

==Description==
This trench is strewn with the remnants of countless attacks upon the [[Seat of the Primus]] by forces which threatened the [[Shadowlands]].

Each time, [[Maldraxxus]] claimed victory.

Now scavengers pick at scraps in hopes of buying their way into one of the three remaining houses. In these desperate times, we must gain every advantage possible over our rivals.

If we arm these scavengers and offer them a second chance at glory, we can bolster the ranks of [[House of the Chosen|the Chosen]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|10|20}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There should be plenty of weapons found on this old battlefield.

==Completion==
And now we test them.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Walk Among Death]] and [[Memory of Honor]] before heading out. On accept, Draka begins accompanying the player:
:{{Abilities|Draka is Near|id=326106|Draka is escorting you to the House of the Chosen.|icon=inv_jewelry_frostwolftrinket_02}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Come. This is our only path to the [[House of the Chosen (subzone)|House of the Chosen]].}}

Look for [[Battered Weapon]]s scattered around. Pick up the first:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Maldraxxus is home to those who lived for combat. Here, strength is valued and rewarded.}}

Third:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|We are the sworn defenders of the Shadowlands. But our leader, the [[Primus]], has gone missing.}}

Sixth:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka| Now, the five houses are at war. Two have fallen. I won't let the Chosen be next.}}

Target a nearby [[Displaced Scavenger]] and use the quest item on it to arm it.

==Progression==
{{Champion of Pain}}

==Trivia==
*During the beta, Draka would say {{Text|say|[DEPRECATED] Stand tall, soldier}} when all eight Displaced Scavengers had been armed.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
