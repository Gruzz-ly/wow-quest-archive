==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]] in [[Oribos]].

==Description==
<Name>, your arrival has set [[Maldraxxus]] ablaze. If you have any honor, you will do as I ask.

I believe I know where our answers may lie. [[Alexandros Mograine|The baron]] preceding [[Draka]] was lost to the [[Maw]]. It is said you have entered that dark abyss... and returned.

If the baron survived, he may know our next course of action.

You came here from [[Oribos]]. Return there, and see if you can find a way back to the Maw.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|45|70}}
* 920 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What news from Maldraxxus, <name>?

<Bolvar listens to your tale.>

==Notes==
Get back to [[Oribos]] and return to the [[Enclave]].

:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|It would seem you must brave the horrors of the Maw once again, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|I know not how to locate this missing Maldraxxi baron, nor our living allies. But I believe I can help you find [[Darion Mograine]]. That's a start, at least.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Honored Voice, we seek entrance to the Maw.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tal-Inara]]|There is but one path to that dark realm. The same route all souls destined for damnation must take.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|But be warned, mortal. Though you escaped the Maw once, you may not be so fortunate a second time.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|We know the risk. There is no choice but to try.}}
