==Objectives==
[[File:Masked Infiltrator.jpg|thumb|upright|A Masked Infiltrator]]
Uncover hidden [[Spy|spies]] with the [[Chosen Corpsehound]].
* [[Masked Infiltrator]] slain (6)

==Description==
The other houses have yet to launch a full scale assault, but do not mistake their cowardice for incompetence.

Any tactician worth their weight in [[maldracite]] knows the value of espionage. I suspect that the agents of our foes skulk within our own ranks as we speak.

Take one of my hounds. It will know our enemies by their scent. Once the pests have been discovered, exterminate them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|33|60}}
* 7,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Get moving!

==Completion==
If they cannot properly evade detection, then they do not deserve to survive.

==Notes==
On accepting both The Hills Have Eyes and [[Maintaining Order]]:
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Get moving, recruit! We are at war!}}

The player is automatically accompanied by a Chosen Corpsehound. Start running around the compound and look for [[Chosen Protector]]s. When the hound detects an infiltrator in disguise, it will howl, start to glow, and run up to the infiltrator, causing them to start glowing as well.
*{{Text|emote|The corpsehound seems to be on high alert.}}
*{{Text|emote|The corpsehound starts pawing at the ground...}}
*{{Text|emote|The corpsehound starts to growl...}}

Speak with the NPC that receives the Mark Target buff to reveal them as a hostile Masked Infiltrator:
:What do you want?
:{{gossip|You're acting suspicious.}}
*{{text|say|Chosen Protector|You will not compromise my position!}}
*{{text|say|Chosen Protector|Maldraxxus will be ours!}}
*{{text|say|Chosen Protector|I will know your secrets!}}

==Progression==
{{House of the Chosen}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
*[[Corpsehound Whistle]] was provided.

;Description
The cowards in the other houses have yet to launch a full assault, but that doesn't mean we aren't being prodded for weaknesses.

Any tactician worth their weight in [[maldracite]] must know their foe's preparedness. I suspect we house enemies hidden in plain sight.

Lucky for you, I've prepared for this contingency. Take one of my hounds to scout the area. They will uncover the treachery that you cannot.

;Completion
If they cannot properly hide, then they do not deserve to live.

==Trivia==
*This quest's title is a reference to the {{Wp|The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|1977 horror film}} of the same name.

==Patch changes==
