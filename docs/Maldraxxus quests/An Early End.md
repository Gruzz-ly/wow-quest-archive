==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Inert Butchers.
* [[Inert Butcher]]s destroyed (6)

==Description==
Within the [[Hall of Chains]] lie more [[abomination]]s that are nearly complete. As we speak the [[Margrave Gharmal|Margrave]]'s forces work fervently to graft the last pieces of flesh to their horrific visages.

If they are allowed to finish their work, the constructs we have destroyed so far will mean little in the final conflict. Our flank will be overrun by a fresh wave of horrors, and the day will be lost.

That must not come to pass. Destroy any abominations you come across.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
May your blade strike true.

==Completion==
Every abomination denied is one less foe to contend with when we face Gharmal. 

==Notes==
The abominations for this quest are not yet active. Interact with them to destroy them.

When you return, the NPCs around Xandria are now all standing in combat positions, and [[Kynthia]] is standing in front of the Paragon:
