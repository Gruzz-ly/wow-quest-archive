==Objectives==
Eliminate Chelicera and obtain the Key of Eyes.
* [[Key of Eyes]]
* [[Chelicera]] slain
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
I seek a mercenary of unparalleled might to venture into the House of Eyes and procure the "Key of Eyes".

Above average compensation is assured for the one who can both deliver the key and regale me with the story of its previous owner's demise.

Be warned that the grounds once belonging to the House of Eyes are extremely dangerous and lone exploration is highly discouraged.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 11,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So, you've seen my posting?

==Completion==
Ah, very good! And a million eyes appeared, you say? How frightening!

Glad she's gone and the key's in my hands now! She used it to break into many a locked door, you know? A very powerful item! Very profitable too.

And now it's mine!
