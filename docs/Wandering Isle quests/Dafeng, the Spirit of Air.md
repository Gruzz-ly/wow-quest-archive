==Objectives==
Speak to [[Dafeng]], the spirit of the air, in the [[Chamber of Whispers]].
* Locate Dafeng

==Description==
If you listen long enough, the wind will carry the answer to you.

Dafeng has been scared from the skies by [[Zhao-Ren]], the Onyx Serpent. He hides within the Chamber of Whispers, at the south side of the plateau.

Go to him. [[Ji Firepaw|Ji]] and I will join you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Completion==
Dafeng looks frightened as you approach, but settles a bit at the sound of your voice.

==Notes==
Head south through the village and down the ridge. The Chamber of Whispers is whipping up a storm.
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Wait!}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|We need to wait for the winds to settle, then make a break for the cover of the far hallway.}}
Wait for the wind to die down, then sprint through. The wind will do damage to players as a proportion of their health, but the damage will not appear in the combat log. Making it to a safe spot will quickly regenerate health.

After reaching the middle:
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudinger|Wait for another opening. I'll meet you on the far side.}}

After reaching Dafeng:
:{{Text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Dafeng! What's wrong? Why are you hiding back here?}}

Speak with Aysa to continue.
