==Objectives==
Defeat Zhao-Ren, the Onyx Serpent with the aid of Ji's fireworks.
* [[Zhao-Ren]] slain

==Description==
[[File:Zhao-Ren.jpg|thumb|Zhao-Ren]]
[[Dafeng]], the spirit of air, is terrified by Zhao-Ren, the Onyx Serpent. We must help him face that fear, or face it for him ourselves.

When I told [[Ji Firepaw|Ji]] of the serpent, he said he had an idea and would begin preparations outside of the chamber. Despite his rash nature, I must admit, I envy his passion and conviction.

Find Ji outside and confront the Onyx Serpent.

==Rewards==
[[File:Stolen Fireworks.jpg|thumb|One of many [[Fireworks Launcher]]s in the area]]
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}
|Cloak of the Fiery Skies}}

==Completion==
You have helped Dafeng find his courage! The final spirit has been restored.

==Notes==
Dafeng is not causing wind issues, so exit the chamber at any pace. Outside on the ridge is the Onyx Serpent, a boss-level dragonkin with 1980 health, circling the area. Conveniently, Ji has placed a number of [[Fireworks Launcher]]s on the ground along the dragon's path. Trigger the fireworks as the dragon flies overhead to deal damage. 
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|That's the way to do it!}}

As it circles, Zhao-Ren has a breath attack that will leave a pool on the ground in its wake, causing damage over time. Needless to say, if you're caught in the pool get out as quickly as possible.

At some point, Zhao-Ren will descend, allowing Aysa and Ji to engage it in melee combat:
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|You've done it! Now quickly, lets{{sic}} attack it while it's grounded.}}

If Zhao-Ren still lives and takes to the air again, resume setting off fireworks. It will again descend:
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|It's down! Let's finish it off.}}

Once the boss has been defeated, [[Master Shang Xi]] will appear near its corpse. Speak with him to continue.
