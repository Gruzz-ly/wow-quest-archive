==Objectives==
Request [[Shu]]'s help in waking [[Wugou]], the spirit of earth.
* Ask Shu for help
* Wake Wugou

==Description==
Alright <name>, I was thinking about what we'd try next if the whole gong thing didn't work, and it came to me just like that! Water in the face always worked on me. It's got to be twice as effective for someone so dry and earthy!

Mind going over and asking Shu, the spirit of water, if he'll help us out? He should be playing in the pool next to the waterfall, just on the other side of that tree.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
If I know Shu, he'll be happy to do this whether it works or not. It's just his kind of fun.

==Completion==
YEAH!!! <Name>, we make quite a team. Persistence over planning, I always say!

==Notes==
[[File:Not In the Face.jpg|thumb|Shu tormenting frogs at the waterfall.]]
Behind Ji, Wugou, and the gong is a waterfall to the north, where Shu is "playing" with [[Mossback Toad|frogs]] like he did with you at the [[Pool of Reflection]], launching them into the air. Head north and talk to him.

<Shu looks at you expectantly.>

{{gossip|Shu, can you wake up Wuguo{{sic}} for me?}}

Shu immediately runs to the center of town, lines up about 10 yards away from Wugou, and pulls the trigger, blasting him with a stream of water to the face. Wugou gives Shu a dirty look as Shu laughs, then quickly takes off before Wugou starts chasing him.

Ji's gossip text is updated:
{{dialogue|
And there we have it, just add water! Wish I would have thought of that one a little sooner.
