==Objectives==
Retrieve the Sun Pearl.
* [[Sun Pearl]]

==Description==
[[Shu]], the spirit of water, is eternally young, as are all the spirits of [[Shen-zin Su]]. I have been friends with Shu all of my life, but I no longer have it within me to play with him. I am old, and lack the energy.

For all his complexities, Shu is simple to please: he desires friendship. When I returned to play with Shu each season, I would always bring a Sun Pearl as a gift, and then we would play together. You can find a Sun Pearl in the pools to the southeast. Perhaps you can be his new friend.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sun Pearl Gloves
|Sun Pearl Vest
|Sun Pearl Bracers
|Sun Pearl Chainmail
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Progress==
The decision to not return to the pools was a hard one. I don't think Shu ever truly understood. He does not know what it is to get older and weaker.

==Completion==
Shu's desires are not so different from our own. He does not want to be alone. Unwanted, unloved. He longs to be needed, and to share his life with others.

Knowing that, earning his trust is not terribly difficult. He just wants company.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Sting of Learning]] before heading out. Back down the ramp, then take a left, heading southeast, and start killing water pincers. After killing six, keep heading southeast into the deep pool with [[Barbed Ray]]s and [[Fang-she]], a named [[sea serpent]]. The serpent is guarding the [[Ancient Clam]], which contains the [[Sun Pearl]]. Get back to the path and keep following it east to find [[Old Man Liang]].

==Progression==
