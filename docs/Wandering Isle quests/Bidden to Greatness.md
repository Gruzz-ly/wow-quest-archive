==Objectives==
Open the gates to [[Pei-Wu Forest]].
*Open the Mandori Village Gate
*Open the Pei-Wu Forest Gate

==Description==
It is up to all of you to remove the thorn from the side of Shen-zin Su. Do not let your differences come between you. Trust in each other.

Within the Pei-Wu Forest is a [[Wei Palerage|lone hermit]]. Head directly to [[Forlorn Hut|his hut]]. He knows intimately of the dark things that now lurk in the trees. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Completion==
Evil is rising form the seas and filling the forest. It's not just [[tiger]]s anymore... [[Deepscale tribe|something]] far more sinister lurks in the shadows, waiting to take any [[pandaren]] unwise enough to stray out alone.

You are not safe here.

==Notes==
Upon reaching the first gate in [[Mandori Village]]:
:{{text|say|[[Aysa Cloudsinger]]|<Name>'s here. Let's go.}} (voice: "All right. Let's go.")
:''They open the gate and resume running downhill. At the next gate...''
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Wha...}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|The gate is jammed.}}
:{{text|say|[[Ji Firepaw]]|Let me try.}}
:''Ji tries and fails.''
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Did they prop this door up against a boulder? It won't budge!}}
:''[[Jojo Ironbrow]] suddenly yells, and with the [[:Jade Tiger Pillar]] in hand slams open the door.''
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Well done, Jojo!}}
:''The trio continue running, reaching the Forlorn Hut, where some suspicious non-pandaren wait.''
After arriving at the [[Forlorn Hut]]:
:{{text|say|[[Korga Strongmane]]|Wei, are these friends of yours?}}
:{{text|say|[[Wei Palerage]]|Never met them before in my life. Pandaren don't really come in any bad flavors though.}}
:{{text|say|Korga Strongmane|Korga Strongmane, once prisoner of the [[Alliance]], now free and woefully unarmed [[tauren]]. Good to meet you, pandaren.}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|The Alliance? If the crashed ship is theirs, we need to contact them. Jojo, would you come with me?}}
:''Aysa and Jojo run off.''
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|We need to dislodge that ship, Korga. If we help your crewmates, can you help us?}}
:{{text|say|Korga Strongmane|Gladly, my new friend. [[Makael Bay|Our engineer]] is still in the wilds though - we'll need to rescue him first.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Well, we've got a master person-finder here, eh <name>? We're on it.}}

Speak with Wei to continue.
