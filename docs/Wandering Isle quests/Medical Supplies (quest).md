==Objectives==
Recover 8 Crates of Medical Supplies.
* [[Alliance Medical Supplies]] (8)

==Description==
We need supplies to tend to our wounded, but the supply crates containing them were scattered in the crash. If you can bring back any crates you find, I would be very grateful.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
Did you find the boxes I spoke of? 

==Completion==
These will do perfectly. I'll get my medics to work immediately.

Thank you.

==Notes==
Pick up [[None Left Behind]] and [[From Bad to Worse (The Wandering Isle)]] before heading out.

More of the same with the killing of [[Deepscale Tormentor]]s and collecting of [[Alliance Medical Crate]]s. Additionally, picking up [[Injured Sailor]]s in and around the ship will give the adventurer a 3-minute buff, during which time he or she should bring the wounded soldier back to camp before it despawns. Only one sailor may be carried at a time.
