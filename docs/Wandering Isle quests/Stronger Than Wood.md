==Objectives==
Gather 12 Discarded Wood Planks.
*[[Discarded Wood Plank]] (12)

==Description==
Gather me wood planks from construction near the [[Ki-Han Brewery]].

You do not yet know the extent of my strength, so I shall display it to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
Have you done as I've asked?

==Completion==
Good.

My head, it is harder than the densest wood.

Step back, and let me dispel your doubts.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Missing Mallet]] before heading out. Head southwest along the path and take a left to reach the brewery. Find [[Raggis]], a level 7 named [[virmen]] with 274 health, in front of the brewery. Kill Raggis to acquire the [[Dai-Lo Recess Mallet]]. Gather planks in the area, two at a time, then head back to town.

On completion:
