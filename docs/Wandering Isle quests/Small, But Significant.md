==Objectives==
Retrieve 8 Kun-Pai Ritual Charms.
* [[Kun-Pai Ritual Charm]] (8)

==Description==
[[File:Kun-Pai Ritual Charm.jpg|thumb|A ritual charm hanging from a tree.]]
I am tired, <name>. I must rest.

We have a ritual to perform, but we require some of the charms from this grove. If you wander the grove, you should see them all over hanging from the trees.

If it does not offend one as young as you, will you permit me to sit and recover my strength while you gather these charms?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||2|25}}

==Progress==
Rest feels good. The burdens of life have become a great weight after so many years.

==Completion==
You come through, as you always have. You are truly one of my greatest students. I think you will be something the likes of which the world has never seen.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Unwelcome Nature]] before heading out.

North or south, kill and loot. The ritual charms are hanging from trees.

==Progression==
{{Morning Breeze Village}}
