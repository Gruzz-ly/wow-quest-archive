==Objectives==
Speak to [[Delora Lionheart]] at the [[Wreck of the Skyseeker]]. 

==Description==
I'm sure [[Aysa Cloudsinger|Aysa]] won't love this plan, but it's the only plan we've got. Would you mind being the bearer of bad news for me, <name>? She needs to know what we're doing so she can get everyone to safety.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Completion==
Your [[Aysa Cloudsinger|friend]] is out fighting to save my crew. Fiercely I might add. I'm afraid your message may have to wait.

==Notes==
Head down the path to the southeast, cut through what's left of the ''Skyseeker'' and keep heading east to reach the Alliance triage area. Alas, Aysa is out in the field, but the captain is here to help.

==Progression==
