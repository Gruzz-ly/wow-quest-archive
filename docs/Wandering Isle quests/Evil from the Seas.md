Kill 8 [[Darkened Horror]]s or [[Darkened Terror]]s.

==Description==
I do not know what this evil is that is infesting the forest, <name>, but I know exactly how to deal with it. So do you, I think.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Protector's Robes

==Progress==
In all of my years on [[Shen-zin Su]], I've never witnessed something so dark as these creatures. I shudder to think of the abyss that they crawled forth from.

==Completion==
You make me proud, <name>. You make all of us proud.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Handle With Care (quest)]] before heading out. More killing and looting in the same area.
