==Objectives==
Defeat 6 Tushui Monks atop the balance poles.
* Defeat [[Tushui Monk]]s (6)

==Description==
I require peace to perform my meditation. Practice your arts while I meditate on [[Shu]]'s location.

Other monks practice balance and combat upon the balance poles in the surrounding pools. Engage them and defeat them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1}}

==Progress==
Only through discipline can we find harmony. Only through harmony can we reach our true potential as warriors.

==Completion==
Even now, your skills increase. Your footing becomes more sure. Your blows strike with more force.

Discipline and practice are the keys to reaching our full potential.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Lesson of Dry Fur]] before heading out. Remember to keep looking for [[Hard Tearwood Reed]]s in the pools.

Head southwest from Aysa's position and cross under the bridge to reach the Pool of Cursed Frog. Players must be on dry land in order to jump onto the balance poles. Players who miss the poles and land in the pool are turned into frogs. Cranes find frogs delicious and are hostile to any adventurers-come-frogs near them. Escape the water to resume humanoid form in order to fend them off.

While on the poles, defeat six [[Tushui Monk]]s, then keep jumping toward the [[Training Bell]] on the west side of the pool surrounded by poles. Making it to one of the surrounding poles will cause the player to jump to the rock in the middle with the bell. Interact with the bell to ring it, then jump back toward land.

[[Stronger Than Reeds]] is required to continue, so make sure to gather all eight reeds.

You do not actually have to stand on the poles. Attacking the monks from the water will do just fine.

==Trivia==
*Fighting on a pole over a cursed pools that turn people into the animals that died there is a reference to the manga ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranma_1/2 Ranma ½]''.
