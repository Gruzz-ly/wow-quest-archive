==Objectives==
Recover 8 Stolen Firework Bundles.
*[[Stolen Firework Bundle]] (8)

==Description==
The monkeys have been stealing from the village during their attacks. We should be fine without some of the extra food stores, but the idea of monkeys with fireworks... I'm a little bit concerned. Not to mention, who knows when some fireworks will come in handy?

Help me recover the stolen fireworks from their village, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Progress==
I'm somewhat impressed they hadn't set their village on fire with these things.

==Completion==
<Name>, I'm thinking we should celebrate with these later. What do you think?

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Direct Solution]] and [[Do No Evil]] before heading out.

Head back to town and circle clockwise to the northwest to reach [[Fe-Feng Village]]. Ji Firepaw will join the party just outside town. Immediately outside town is a [[Jade Tiger Pillar]]. Interact with it to pick up [[Stronger Than Bone]] before continuing in to town.

[[Stolen Fireworks]] litter the ground, probably guarded by [[Fe-Feng Firethief|Fe-Feng Firethieves]]. [[Fe-Feng Ruffian]]s are also all over town. Don't go out of the way to kill hozen, as enough will get in the way while collecting fireworks and finding Ruk-Ruk. [[Ruk-Ruk]] can be found all the way off at the western end of the village. He is a level 7 hozen with 1,233 health and no special abilities.

While running back to Morning Breeze, turn in all three quests to Ji. Turn Stronger Than Bone to Jojo to continue.

==Progression==
