==Objectives==
Kill 20 hozen in [[Fe-Feng Village]].
* Fe-Feng Hozen slain (20)

==Description==
Alright <name>, this is the second time we've had to deal with ravaging [[hozen]]. I think it's time we take care of this problem the [[Huojin Pandaren|Huojin]] way. No more patience. No more mediation. We go to the source.

We're going into the hozen village to the north and we're punishing those smelly troublemakers. I've been looking forward to a chance to fight by your side again, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Progress==
The time for kindness is done. We have monkeys to kill.

==Completion==
Invigorating! A good fight always makes me feel better!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Do No Evil]] and [[Monkey Advisory Warning]] before heading out.

Head back to town and circle clockwise to the northwest to reach [[Fe-Feng Village]]. Ji Firepaw will join the party just outside town. Immediately outside town is a [[Jade Tiger Pillar]]. Interact with it to pick up [[Stronger Than Bone]] before continuing in to town.

[[Stolen Fireworks]] litter the ground, probably guarded by [[Fe-Feng Firethief|Fe-Feng Firethieves]]. [[Fe-Feng Ruffian]]s are also all over town. Don't go out of the way to kill hozen, as enough will get in the way while collecting fireworks and finding Ruk-Ruk. [[Ruk-Ruk]] can be found all the way off at the western end of the village. He is a level 7 hozen with 1,233 health and no special abilities.

Don't worry about there being too many hozen on your way. Let Ji tank them &mdash; he is quite a killing machine and will immediately respawn with full health if he goes down. However, you will only get credit for those hozen you personally dealt at least some damage to.

While running back to Morning Breeze, turn in all three quests to Ji. Turn Stronger Than Bone to Jojo to continue.
