'''A New Fate''' ends the instanced portion of the [[Wandering Isle storyline|pandaren starting experience]] on the [[Wandering Isle]]. Upon conclusion of the quest, players must make the one-time-only decision of which faction to ally with, Horde or Alliance.  Once the decision has been made, they will permanently leave the Wandering Isle and join the rest of the game world.  It will be impossible to change that decision via in-game means. Also, players are (after a cutscene) teleported out of the instance to either the entrance between [[Elwynn Forest]] and [[Stormwind City]] or to one of the zeppelin towers in [[Orgrimmar]] to meet with their newly-allied faction's leader.

==Objectives==
Speak to the [[Spirit of Master Shang Xi]], and choose whether you leave with the [[Alliance]] or the [[Horde]].
*Choose your faction

==Description==
These new allies have shed light on a great and important truth: it is not just [[Shen-zin Su]] that is ailing, but all of the land beyond the clouds. The world needs healing, and I think that you should be the ones to heal it.

I would like you, [[Ji Firepaw|Ji]], and [[Aysa Cloudsinger|Aysa]] to leave and bring your strength and wisdom to the world. These Alliance and Horde have different ideals, but at the core of both lies noble intent.

I will leave the choice of who you wish to accompany to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||85}}

==Completion==
And so it is done... here we are, in our new home.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Spirit of Master Shang Xi]]|You've all accomplished a great thing in saving Shen-zin Su. You do us all proud.}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Master Shang Xi|It seems your journeys are not done. These new allies of ours come from a [[Cataclysm (event)|broken world]] that could use our help.}}
:{{text|say|[[Aysa Cloudsinger]]|Master Shang Xi, I would like to accompany the Alliance back to their home.}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Master Shang Xi|What of you, Ji? Will you join the Horde in their journey back?}}
:{{text|say|[[Ji Firepaw]]|Yes... perhaps that is for the best. I like what I've seen of them, and it sounds as though their world could use my help.}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Master Shang Xi|And you, my young student? Where will you go?}}

When ready, speak with the Spirit of Master Shang Xi:
{{dialogue|There's a broken world that could use your help, my student. Have you decided who you would like to accompany in your journey?

{{gossip|I'm ready to decide.}}}}

As soon as players complete this quest, they are required to make a one-time-only decision as to which faction they choose to ally to, the Alliance or Horde. Once the decision has been made, they will permanently leave the Wandering Isle and join the rest of the game world. It will be impossible to change that decision via in-game means.

A [[Mists of Pandaria in-game cinematics|cutscene]] will play, showing the spirit of Master Shang Xi saluting his students one last time before disappearing. The [[Shang Xi's Hot Air Balloon|hot air balloon]] transporting them will fly over various areas of the Wandering Isle, and the player will wind up looking at the [[Stormwind City]] gates or on one of the [[Orgrimmar]] [[zeppelin]] towers. Speak with Aysa ([[Joining the Alliance]]) or Ji ([[Joining the Horde]]) to continue.
