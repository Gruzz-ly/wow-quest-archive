*Protect Aysa while she meditates {{co|57.9|36.5|Wandering Isle}}

==Description==
It's a pleasure to meet you, <class>. I am Aysa, of the Tushui.

I've spent much time in thought since [[Master Shang Xi|Master Shang]] told me we would be searching for [[Huo]], the spirit of fire. I know where he resides, but not how to reach him. The answers are close, however.

Come with me to the [[Cave of Meditation]] nearby. It is a place of great wisdom. I will meditate there, open my mind, and the path shall find us.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Initiate's Robes
|Initiate's Vest (leather)
|Initiate's Breastplate
|Initiate's Chestpiece
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Completion==
Your path is set before you. You will be the one to rekindle the spirit of fire and bring it to the safety of the temple.

This will not be the only time you and Aysa work together. She is strong and wise. You can trust her.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Meet me up in the cave if you would, friend.}}
:''Aysa jumps up over the rocks and disappears heading toward the cave.''

Circle clockwise down to the southeast to reach the [[Cave of Meditation]]. Hostile [[Amberleaf Troublemaker]]s are streaming into the cave. Ignore them and run in to reach Aysa, who is sitting by a large scroll. Inside the cave, an event starts. A progress bar starts counting up to 90 as the troublemakers will aggro on the player. The two [[Tushui Monk|monks]] can help take them out.
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Keep those creatures at bay while I meditate. We'll soon have the answers we seek.}}
:{{text|emote|Master Li Fei's voice echoes, "The way of the Tushui... enlightenment through patience and meditation... the principled life."}}
:{{text|emote|Master Li Fei's voice echoes, "It is good to see you again, Aysa. You've come with respect, and so I shall give you the answers you seek."}}
:{{text|emote|Master Li Fei's voice echoes, "Huo, the spirit of fire, is known for his hunger. He wants for tinder to eat. He needs the caress of the wind to rouse him."}}
:{{text|emote|Master Li Fei's voice echoes, "If you find these things and bring them to [[Shrine of Inner-Light|his cave]], on the far side of [[Wu-Song Village]], you will face a challenge within."}}
:{{text|emote|Master Li Fei's voice echoes, "Overcome that challenge, and you shall be graced by Huo's presence. Rekindle his flame, and if your spirit is pure, he shall follow you."}}
:{{text|emote|Master Li Fei's voice echoes, "Go, children. We shall meet again very soon."}}
:{{text|emote|Master Li Fei fades away.}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|And so our path lays before us. Speak to Master Shang Xi, he will tell you what comes next.}}

After the progress bar fills up, the event will complete and the sprites will fade away as [[Master Shang Xi]] appears at the mouth of the cave. Speak with him to continue.
