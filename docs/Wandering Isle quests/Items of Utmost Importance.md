==Objectives==
[[File:Amberleaf Scamp.jpg|thumb|[[Amberleaf Scamp]].]]
Recover 6 Training Supplies from [[Amberleaf Scamp]]s.
*[[Stolen Training Supplies]] (6)

==Description==
Amberleaf scamps swarmed my cart and stole most of the training supplies I was bringing up to the training grounds. They've always been troublemakers, but they've never been this aggressive before. I don't know what happened.

Please, help me recover my supplies.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||50}}

==Progress==
You needn't worry about hurting the sprites. They're really just living plants when it comes down to it - they'll resprout later.

==Completion==
Thank you! You're an honorable <class>. They've taught you well.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Missing Driver]] before heading out. Head north up the hill. [[Amberleaf Scamp]]s are level 2 [[sprite]] elementals, stealing barrels. Kill them to collect their barrels. After collecting six, circle clockwise to the northwest around the hill. On the west side of the hill is [[Min Dimwind]], the driver, trapped by five scamps. Simply run up to Min to "rescue" him, then return to [[Merchant Lorvo]] back at [[Fu's Pond]] to continue. [[Aysa Cloudsinger|Aysa]] has finished with her task and is waiting next to the merchant:
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|A challenge in compassion and humility. By helping Merchant Lorvo, it would seem you've passed, <class>. Master Shang would be pleased.}}
