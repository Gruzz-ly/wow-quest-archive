==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Master Li Fei|Speak to me when you are ready for combat, young <class>.}}
:''Master Li Fei knocks the adventurer to the center of the arena.''

Master Li Fei, a boss-level pandaren, has 12,240 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic melee|23-27 on cloth}}
*{{Abilities|Flying Shadow Kick|Appear behind your target and deliver a swift flying kick knocking them away and stunning them for 2 sec.|id=108936|icon=ability_monk_roundhousekick}}
*{{Abilities|Feet of Fury|Swiftly kicks target enemy, inflicting 20 Physical damage every .5 secs for 3 secs.|id=108958|icon=ability_monk_standingkick}}
*{{Abilities|Flying Shadow Kick|Stunned.|id=108944|icon=spell_frost_stun}}

However, the three braziers provide adventuring pandaren with buffs of their own:
*{{abilities|Blessing of the Blue Flame|Increases mana regeneration significantly.}}
*{{abilities|Blessing of the Red Flame|Increases health and health regeneration significantly.}}
*{{abilities|Blessing of the Purple Flame|Increases damage done significantly.}}

Players jump from around 200 health to around 1,200 health, and damage dealt is multiplied by a factor of around 30. Additionally, the health and mana regeneration rates are so highly increased it is impossible to die as players will outheal any damage Li Fei deals out. Take this opportunity to do damage levels not seen for another 10-15 levels!

On victory:
:{{text|say|Master Li Fei|You have earned the right to proceed. Huo lies beyond.}}
