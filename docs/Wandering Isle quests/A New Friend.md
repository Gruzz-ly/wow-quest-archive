==Progress==
This is your task, <class>. See it through.

==Completion==
I have to admit, that looked pretty fun from my angle.

And you seem to have made a new friend.

==Notes==
This quest is automatically accepted. Shu is jumping around from one rock to another. Once at a rock, he will start a several-second cast targeting some water near his position. Get to it before he finishes the cast and he will launch players up into the air. The water is perturbed enough to break water walking, so as to not break legs. Jump to get back to the surface and find the next spot that is about to be launched.

Aysa and Liang are by the edge of the pool on completion.
