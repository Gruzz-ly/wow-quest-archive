[[File:WorldMap-TheWanderingIsle.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Wandering Isle]] storyline''' is the [[pandaren (playable)|pandaren]] level 1-20 starting experience. Freshly-created pandaren start out ''neutral'', in their own instance. Once players reach the end of the chain, they will be forced to make a one-time-only decision as to which faction they wish to ally with, [[Alliance]] or [[Horde]]. Once the decision has been made, players will not be able to change that decision via in-game means (though out-of-game tools like Faction Change still function).

==Training with fire==

Pandaren start out life as [[adventurer]]s at the [[Shang Xi Training Grounds]] on the [[Wandering Isle]] looking in the direction of {{NPC||Master Shang Xi}}. He quickly puts young pandaren through their paces in challenges of increasing difficulty. Confident that the adventuring pandaren can survive life outside the training grounds, the master sends them out to meet {{NPC||Aysa Cloudsinger}} and {{NPC||Ji Firepaw}} in an effort to recover the four elemental spirits. The first spirit found is {{NPC||Huo}}, the ancient spirit of fire, who is then quickly taken to the [[Temple of Five Dawns]] at the center of the Wandering Isle.

==Moving water and earth==

Master Shang Xi next sends adventuring pandaren east to the [[Singing Pools]], to find {{NPC||Shu}}, the ancient spirit of water. Shu is sad that {{NPC||Old Man Liang}} is no longer playing with him, so it is up to the adventurer to make friends with him. Once that has been accomplished, Aysa sends adventurers forward to Ji at the [[Dai-Lo Farmstead]], which has been overrun by [[virmen]]. After Ji's ideas fail to wake {{NPC||Wugou}}, the ancient spirit of earth, Shu lends some assistance.

==To the air and beyond==

No time to rest at the temple as the master quickly launches adventurers upstairs where Ji leads them to the [[Morning Breeze Village]] to solve the [[hozen]] problem once and for all. Not that slaughtering hozen has anything to do with finding {{NPC||Dafeng}}, the ancient spirit of air. Aysa realizes that Dafeng has been driven into hiding by {{NPC||Zhao-Ren||Onyx Serpent}}, who must be killed in order to ease Dafeng's fears. All four spirits recovered, Master Shang Xi has one final task for adventurers to accomplish by clearing the [[Wood of Staves]] of [[sprite]]s. That accomplished, he has one last piece of wisdom to impart on the young pandaren. Use that knowledge when riding the hot air balloon to speak with [[Shen-zin Su]] and discover the source of his pain.

==Finding safety and strife==
Realizing that the source of Shen-zin Su's pain is the ''[[Skyseeker]]'', a crashed gunship, the adventurer and Master Shang Xi's disciples head into the forbidden [[Pei-Wu Forest]]. There, the party helps triage members of the [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]], as well as fend off new horrors from the depths. This culminates in a boss fight with {{NPC||Vordraka, the Deep Sea Nightmare}}. Immediate threat taken care of, Ji decides to blow up what's left of the [[Wreck of the Skyseeker|''Skyseeker'']]! Shockingly, this plan actually works, to a point. Shen-zin Su now has a river of blood pouring into the sea and it's up to the healers of both the Alliance and Horde to stitch him up, but not without what's left of the invading forces harassing the healers. Defend the healers long enough for them to do their job, then move on to the next problem&mdash;the Alliance and Horde forces are at each other's throats!

==Choosing Alliance or Horde==

Back at the [[Temple of Five Dawns]] for the last time, pandaren adventurers must now make the most important decision of their lives. The time has come to decide which faction to ally with. Upon completing A New Fate, adventurers will be whisked to their new capital city in order to meet their new leader.

===Alliance===
Alliance members find themselves outside of [[Stormwind City]] in [[Elwynn Forest]] along with {{NPC||Aysa Cloudsinger||Aysa}} and {{NPC||Jojo Ironbrow||Jojo}} to meet {{NPC||Varian Wrynn}}:

{{Speak With Varian}}

===Horde===
Horde members will find themselves at the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]] just outside the gates of [[Orgrimmar]] alongside {{NPC||Ji Firepaw||Ji}} to meet {{NPC||Garrosh Hellscream}}:

{{Speak With Garrosh}}

Adventurers then have the choice of any 10-20 leveling zone accessible to their new faction:
