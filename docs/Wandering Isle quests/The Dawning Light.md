==Objectives==
Accompany [[Fearsome Jang]] and await the masters' announcement.
* Accompany Fearsome Jang
* Establish the [[Order of the Broken Temple]]

==Description==
It was a miracle that you were able to survive, <name>. It is with great sorrow that I have to say that [[Grand Master Hight]] was not so lucky. His spirit now rests with the ancestors.

Now we must look to a new leader for our order, our broken temple. I have spoken with the other masters and we are all of one mind on this.

We all agree that the new leader should be you, <name>. You have shown strength, wisdom, courage, and kindness beyond measure.

Walk with us to the temple and we will announce our decision.

==Rewards==
Changes [[Zen Pilgrimage]] to teleport to [[Temple of the Five Dawns]].

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Congratulations, Grand Master <name>!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|emote|Fearsome Jang motions for you to follow.}}

Walk with Jang up the stairs, meeting with [[Chen Stormstout]], [[Li Li Stormstout]], [[Iron-Body Ponshu]], [[Number Nine Jia]] and [[Wise Scholar Lianji]].
:{{text|emote|Fearsome Jang nods approvingly.}}
:{{text|say|Number Nine Jia|Excellent! I have everything prepared inside. Follow me.}}
:''The group walks inside and stands at the statue.''
:{{text|say|Number Nine Jia|To all members and students of our combined schools, I offer you my thanks for joining us.}}
:{{text|say|Number Nine Jia|The attack at the [[Peak of Serenity]] shows that the [[Burning Legion]] wishes to shatter our order. They will destroy our homes, defile our sacred temples, and strive to break our spirit.}}
:{{text|say|Fearsome Jang|But as we teetered upon the brink of annihilation, <name> stayed with Grand Master Hight and fought the [[demon]]s to ensure our survival.}}
:{{text|say|Fearsome Jang|Grand Master Hight has passed on to join the ancestors, and we are left with a void in our ranks.}}
:{{text|say|Fearsome Jang|It seems fitting that the hero who fought at his side, who displayed courage and valor immeasurable, should succeed him.}}
:{{text|say|Number Nine Jia|Let us all give honor to Master <name>! May <he/she> lead us with strength and wisdom.}}
:{{text|say|Number Nine Jia|Monks, our greatest challenge still lies ahead. Under our new master, we will send a message of defiance to our enemies. They will not take our home without a fight!}}
