Kill 8 Thornbranch Scamps.
* [[Thornbranch Scamp]] slain (8)

You faced [[Sprite|forest sprites]] in the [[Dawning Valley]], but the forest sprites in this grove are a different breed. Crueler and more dangerous.

If you would clear some of these sprites out, the spirits would thank you.

You will receive: {{cost||2|25}}

==Progress==
It seems that everywhere I turn, the land is troubled. Your efforts have already helped to ease it's{{sic}} pain, but something greater awaits you before all of this suffering truly behind{{sic}} to subside.

==Completion==
The spirits thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Small, But Significant]] before heading out.

North or south, kill and loot. The [[Kun-Pai Ritual Charm|ritual charms]] are hanging from trees.
