Snatch the flame from Master's Shang Xi's palm, then burn the Edict of Temperance.
* Snatch [[the Master's Flame]]
* Burn the [[Edict of Temperance]]

==Description==
Every wisdom has a time and place, and times are changing for those of us living here on [[Shen-zin Su]]. For this lesson, I would ask two things of you.

For the first, I hold a flame in my hand. Gather your wits, and when you think you are ready, attempt to snatch the flame.

Should you succeed, I want you to then climb to the top of this temple and burn the Edict of Temperance that you find there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}}

==Progress==
There will come time when you must trust your instincts and simply act.

==Completion==
The fact that you were able to snatch the flame so easily is no small feat.

The Edict of Temperance is a scroll of wisdom passed down from my elder's elders. Wisdom from a more peaceful time.

Every lesson has it's time and place, and with darkness on the horizon, the time for this particular wisdom has passed.

The burning of the scroll is an acceptance of tidings to come and a promise to action. Your hand carried the flame, and I suspect that it will continue to do so in the future.

==Notes==
Without leaving the temple, head up two flights of stairs. The Edict of Temperance can be found on a ledge on the southern edge of the building. Interact with the scroll to burn it, then return to the first floor to continue.

After accepting the quest, Shang Xi had a flame in his left hand. Clicking on it while the mouse cursor was a glowing open hand was necessary to acquire [[The Master's Flame]]:
