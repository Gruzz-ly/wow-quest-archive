==Objectives==
[[File:Huojin and Tushui trainees.jpg|thumb|Huojin and Tushui trainees]]
Defeat 6 [[Huojin Trainee]]s or [[Tushui Trainee]]s.
*Sparring Trainees defeated (6)

==Description==
Facing a living opponent is a very different thing from the stationary targets in the yard. Living opponents strike back. There is the very real fear of failure, and sometimes, even death.

You must have the courage to overcome those fears.

Challenge the other trainees within the temple or down the steps below, and defeat them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Initiate's Rope Belt]] (mage/priest)
*[[Initiate's Belt]] (monk/rogue/shaman/hunter)
*[[Initiate's Braided Belt]] (warrior)
*[[Initiate's Plate Belt]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost||1|65}}
*300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Progress==
There is a time for meditation and contemplation, and there is a time for action. Diving the balance between the two is one of the greatest wisdoms we seek.

==Completion==
Intriguing, my young pupil.

Most of the other trainees have been here for quite some time, but you are able to match them even within this first hour.

This speaks well of you, but there are yet other lessons I would see you learn.

==Notes==
Trainees can be found inside the now-unlocked building at the bottom of the hill. Defeat six, then Master Shang Xi will appear inside the building to save a run back up the hill.

On victory, trainees say one of any of the following:
*{{text|say|I have never seen a trainee with such skills as yours. I must tell the others.}}
*{{text|say|My skills are no match for yours. I admit defeat.}}
*{{text|say|Thank you for reminding me that I must train more diligently.}}
*{{text|say|That was a good match. Thank you.}}
*{{text|say|You are an honorable opponent.}}
*{{text|say|You fight honorably, friend.}}
*{{text|say|You fought well. I must learn more from you in the future.}}
*{{text|say|Your skills are too great. I yield.}}

==Progression==
{{Much to Learn}}

==Patch changes==

*{{Hotfix|date=2012-10-04|bluenote=Trainees will now properly concede defeat.}}
