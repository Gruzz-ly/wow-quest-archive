On accept:
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Hop in.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Or if you want to wander the woods a while, Aysa and I can hang out here. You know... just the two of us.}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Don't listen to him. We've got work to do.}}

After boarding the balloon:
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|<Name>, where's [[Master Shang Xi|Master Shang]]?}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|...Ji, they were in the [[Wood of Staves]]. You know where Master Shang is now.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Bah, let a pandaren hope, would you? I'm going to miss the old man.}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Ji, be respectful when we speak to Shen-zin Su.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|When am I not respectful? You hurt me, Aysa.}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|I might if you embarrass us.}}
''The balloon comes around to the head of Shen-zin Su. The zone is now marked as the [[Great Sea]].''
:{{text|yell|Aysa Cloudsinger|Shen-zin Su, we are the descendants of [[Liu Lang]]. We've sensed your pain, and we want to help.}}
:{{text|yell|Aysa Cloudsinger|What ails you Shen-zin Su? What can we do?}}
''Shen-zin Su raises his massive head from the sea.''
:{{text|say|Shen-zin Su|I am in pain, but it warms my heart that Liu Lang's grandchildren have not forgotten me.}}
:{{text|say|Shen-zin Su|There is a thorn in my side. I cannot remove it.}}
:{{text|say|Shen-zin Su|The pain is unbearable, and I can no longer swim straight.}}
:{{text|say|Shen-zin Su|Please grandchildren, can you remove this thorn? I cannot do so on my own.}}
:{{text|yell|Aysa Cloudsinger|Of course, Shen-zin Su! But your shell is large, and I do not know where this thorn could be.}}
:{{text|say|Shen-zin Su|It is in [[Pei-Wu Forest|the forest]] where your feet do not walk. Continue along the mountains and you will find it.}}
:{{text|yell|Aysa Cloudsinger|We will find it, and we will remove it. You have our word!}}
:{{text|say|Shen-zin Su|Thank you, grandchildren.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|A thorn? And I left my tweezers at home.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|How could such a thing cause pain to something so large?}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|We'll known soon enough.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Are you seeing what I'm seeing?! Is that a boat?!}}
''The balloon gets to the side of the turtle, where the [[Wreck of the Skyseeker|crashed ''Skyseeker'']] is. Blood is flowing from Shen-zin Su and the Alliance have set up a camp.''
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|It is a boat... a whole airship! That's a bigger thorn than I was expecting.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|And those aren't pandaren down there. They've got no fur.}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Someone has crashed into our island. Removing this thorn may be more complicated than we thought.}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|We should let [[Elder Shaopai]] know and then plan our next move.}}

You land at the inn of [[Mandori Village]]. Head downstairs to exit the building, stop by the blacksmith on the way out and then head up to the [[Temple of Five Dawns]] to find Elder Shaopai.
