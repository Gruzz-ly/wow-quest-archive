==Objectives==
Kill 6 Water Pincers.
* [[Water Pincer]] slain (6)

==Description==
There are dangers in the pools. The latest and most vicious are the [[Water Pincer|water pincers]]. A time has come for their numbers to be diminished, and I am no longer up to the task.

If you could clear out some of the water pincers, I would be very appreciative. Beware their numbers... sometimes it's best to lure them from the pool-side rather than wading all the way in.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1}}

==Progress==
Balance is a delicate thing. It leans strongly on the wisdom of the elders. The lessons they preach are not always apparent to younger minds, so you must trust that their knowledge of the past will help us preserve the present.

==Completion==
The water pincers are strange creatures. They seem to be drawn to still water.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Sun Pearl]] before heading out. Back down the ramp, then take a left, heading southeast, and start killing water pincers. After killing six, keep heading southeast into the deep pool with [[Barbed Ray]]s and [[Fang-she]], a named [[sea serpent]]. The serpent is guarding the [[Ancient Clam]], which contains the [[Sun Pearl]]. Get back to the path and keep following it east to find [[Old Man Liang]].

==Progression==
