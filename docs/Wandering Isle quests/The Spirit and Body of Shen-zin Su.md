==Objectives==
Bring [[Shu]] and [[Wugou]], the spirits of water and earth, to the [[Temple of Five Dawns]]. A [[Delivery Cart|cart]] is waiting near the road to take you there.

==Description==
Well, that wraps it up here, doesn't it <name>? Now that we've got these two roused and all friendly towards you, we just need to get them back to the Temple of Five Dawns.

You go ahead. I'm going to say my goodbyes, then I'll follow you up shortly.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Robes of the Water Spirit
|Bindings of the Earth Spirit
|Gauntlets of Earth and Water
|Bracers of the Earth Spirit
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Completion==
You have done well, young student. Three of the four spirits have been returned to the temple. We are closer to the answers we seek.

==Notes==
Head southwest from Ji's position to find another [[Delivery Cart Tender]]:
:{{text|say|Delivery Cart Tender|Hello friend! You're welcome to use my cart if you like. It will take you to the Temple of Five Dawns.}}
It is again a fairly long run should adventurers not take this free ride. Wugou will ride along as Shu follows behind.

On completion:
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|You've returned with the spirits of water and earth. You make an old master proud.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|Wugou and Shu are welcome here. We will care for them well.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|The only remaining spirit is [[Dafeng]], who hides somewhere across the [[Dawning Span]] to the west.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|I can carry you to the top of the temple. Ji awaits you there to lead the way.}}
