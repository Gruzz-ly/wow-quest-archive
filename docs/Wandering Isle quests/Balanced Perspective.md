==Objectives==
Cross the ropes and speak to [[Aysa Cloudsinger]] on [[Morning Breeze Lake]].

==Description==
Aysa has been meditating on the lake since we've arrived, all her thoughts focused on [[Dafeng]]. I don't know what she hopes to discover out there, but she's no fool, and [[Master Shang Xi]] has entrusted this task with her.

You will need to cross the ropes leading from the end of the dock to reach her. It shall test your balance, but I think you're up to the task, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Completion==
I'm impressed. Most students that are even capable of reaching this spot do so soaking wet.

==Notes==
[[File:Visions of Dafeng and Zhao-Ren.jpg|thumb|Vision of [[Zhao-Ren]] chasing [[Dafeng]].]] 
Once you accept the quest:
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|See you at the dock!}}

When you arrive at Aysa, you can see that her meditation bore its fruits: visions of [[Zhao-Ren]] and [[Dafeng]] can be seen in the sky, the Onyx Serpent chasing after the spirit of the air.

==Progression==
