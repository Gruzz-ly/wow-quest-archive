==Objectives==
Recover 3 Uprooted Turnips, 3 Stolen Carrots, and 3 Pilfered Pumpkins.
* [[Uprooted Turnip]] (3)
* [[Stolen Carrot]] (3)
* [[Pilfered Pumpkin]] (3)

==Description==
The [[virmen]] to the south have been running off with all of our crops, but they're taking more than they can eat. They must be stockpiling them somewhere - the ones they like anyway.

Will you go out and recover any of the uprooted crops you can find? I've got [[Wandering Isle|an island's]] worth of people to feed, and every single vegetable makes a difference.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Homespun Leggings
|Soft Britches
|Comfortable Greaves
|Padded Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Progress==
Ever since [[Wugou]], the spirit of earth, fell asleep, the dirt is drying out and it's getting harder and harder to get new seeds to sprout. We need to hold on to any food we can, or the island will have hard times ahead.

==Completion==
Some of these have mouth-sized chunks bitten out of them! Ah well, we can still make use.

Thank you for your help, friend.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Rascals]] before heading out. Head southeast into the fields and get cracking. Turnips are found down to the southwest, more carrots can be found underground in the [[Teeming Burrow]], and the pumpkins can be found past the eastern end of [[The Rows]] in the [[Virmen Grotto]].

Also in the burrow are [[Plump Carrotcruncher]]s, which also count for Rascals.
