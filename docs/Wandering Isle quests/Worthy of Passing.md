==Objectives==
Escort [[Master Shang Xi]] through the [[Elders' Path]].
* [[Guardian of the Elders]] slain

==Description==
The four [[Pandaren spirit|elemental spirits]] will help you speak with the land and uncover its plight, but first, I have one small task to ask of you.

Join me, my pupil. Accompany this old pandaren to the western grove.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||2|25}}

==Completion==
I do not have the strength of body or will that I once did. I'm glad there are noble pandaren like you to fight on for our people. You've come far, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|Come child. We have one final journey to take together before your training is complete.}}
:''Shang Xi takes off at a run to the northwest, slowing to a walk before the [[Elders' Path]].''
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|Beyond the Elders' Path lies the [[Wood of Staves]], a sacred place that only the worthy may enter.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|Of the many ways to prove your worth, I require the simplest of you now. I must know that you will fight for our people. I must know that you can keep them safe.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|Defeat the Guardian of the Elders, and we may pass.}}
:''Shang Xi walks forward, stopping off to the side of the guardian.''

The [[Guardian of the Elders]] is a level 7 elite statue with 411 health and no special abilities. Defeat it and Shang Xi takes off again:
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|You've become strong indeed, child. This is good. You will need that strength soon.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|And here we are. Help me with a couple small tasks while I prepare, if you would.}}
