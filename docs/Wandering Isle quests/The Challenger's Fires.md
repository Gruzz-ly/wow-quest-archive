Light your Unlit Challenger's Torch at the Brazier of Flickering Flame, then use it to light the 3 braziers near Master Li Fei.
* Challenger Torch lit
* Red Brazier lit
* Blue Brazier lit
* Violet Brazier lit
* [[Unlit Challenger's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
You're strong of mind and strong of will, but you lack the skills to face me in combat. You must fight with your body, but in truth, it is your character that is being tested.

Let us even the playing field.

Take this torch, light it in the brazer next to me, and then use it to light the three unlit braziers around the pool.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||75}}

==Progress==
You are not yet ready to face me. First, you must light the braziers.

==Completion==
These fires will give you the strength that you've not yet obtained. They will illuminate your potential.

==Notes==
Immediately to Master Li Fei's left is a [[Brazier of the Flickering Flame]]. Interact with it to light the [[Unlit Challenger's Torch]], turning it into the [[Torch of Prismatic Flame]]. Then, interact with the three unlit braziers on the same level as Li Fei, by the edge of the water. Light all three, then return to Li Fei.
