==Objectives==

Defeat Jaomin Ro.
*Defeat [[Jaomin Ro]] {{co|67.7|22.8|Wandering Isle}}

==Description==
<Name>, I see great strength and great courage in you, and an unsurpassed purity of soul.

The hour is young, but I think you may be ready to face a greater challenge.

Go to the bottom of the stairs, and cross the bridge. There, you will find Jaomin Ro, one of our eldest students. Challenge and defeat him in honorable combat, and this phase of your training will be complete.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Initiate's Gloves
|Initiate's Handguards
|Initiate's Gauntlets
|Initiate's Grips
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|65}}
* 300 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Progress==
Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in getting up every time we do. Jaomin Ro knows this. He finds strength in every defeat.

You may yet learn that lesson.

==Completion==
You truly impress, <name>. It seems certain that the path of the <class> is indeed the path for you.

==Notes==
Exit the building and head southeast, down the stairs. Pass to the left of [[Trainee Nim]] and cross the bridge to find [[Jaomin Ro]] in the [[Tranquil Grotto]], marked with a skull on the minimap. Ro is a level 3 pandaren with 497 health and the following abilities.
*{{abilities|Basic melee|3-4 Physical on cloth}}

*{{abilities|Hawk Diving to Earth|cd=10 sec|notes=1 sec cast. Hits for 10 Physical with a knockdown component. Stuns Ro for a few seconds as well}}

Defeat Jaomin Ro and return to the bridge, where [[Master Shang Xi]] has relocated to. Turn in and move on.
