==Objectives==
Speak to [[Old Man Liang]] at [[Liang's Retreat]] in the [[Singing Pools]].

==Description==
It seems [[Shu]], the spirit of water, had a play companion when he came to the pools throughout the years. An old pandaren we know as Old Man Liang.

Liang moved away from the main town and stopped practicing in the pools some time ago. I am told he lives in a small house northeast of here, up the hill.

Liang may know what has driven Shu away, and where the spirit might be found.

Go to Liang. Ask of Shu.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||25}}

==Completion==
Visitors are rare up here, but you are welcome. It is nice to meet you, young <class>.

==Notes==
[[File:Vision of Liang and Shu.jpg|thumb|Vision of Young Liang and Shu.]]
As you are about the complete the previous quests leading to Finding an Old Friend, something has changed in the pool where Aysa resides: her meditation has brought forth a vision of a [[Old Man Liang|young pandaren]] and the spirit of water playing together.

Head to the northeast, up the path to Liang's Retreat.
