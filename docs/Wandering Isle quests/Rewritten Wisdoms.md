==Objectives==
Burn 5 Defaced Scrolls of Wisdom.
*[[Defaced Scroll of Wisdom|Defaced Scrolls of Wisdom]] burned (5)

==Description==
<Name>, we must help [[Elder Shaopai]]. There are few more deserving of our kindness.

On the way here, you surely noticed the scrolls of wisdom hanging in the [[Ridge of Laughing Winds|grotto]] to the south. The [[hozen]] have defiled many of them, and sadly, they are not recoverable. We will deal with the problem directly - burn the defiled scrolls. Wipe the hozen writings away entirely.

Do not worry for Elder Shaopai. The people shall come together and help him rewrite the wisdoms in time. I shall see to that.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of the following:
*[[Gloves of Wisdom]] (cloth)
*[[Gloves of Verity]] (leather)
*[[Handgrips of Verity]] (mail)
*[[Unvarnished Vambraces]] (plate)

You will also receive:
*{{cost|||55}}
*200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Progress==
Elder Shaopai has long been responsible for documenting the great wisdoms of our people and hanging them for all to see. What amazes me is his fortitude in the light of the great sacrilege these hozen are committing. Many years of work destroyed, and yet he remains calm.

I must admit, that is a quality that I do not possess.

==Completion==
You're a good <man/woman>, <name>. You have proven that again and again, and I am glad to stand beside you.

==Notes==
[[Defaced Scroll of Wisdom|Defaced Scrolls of Wisdom]] hang from rocks in the [[Ridge of Laughing Winds]] south of [[Morning Breeze Village]]. Interact with them to burn them.

Burning a scroll will display a piece of hozen wisdom on-screen:
*{{text|bossemote|Don't pull own tail when there are other tails to pull.}}
*{{text|bossemote|Don't roll in own poo unless want to smell like poo all day.}}
*{{text|bossemote|Don't throw banana peel where going to walk.}}
*{{text|bossemote|Firecracker for throwing, banana for eating.}}
*{{text|bossemote|Mouth only hole that banana go in.}}
*{{text|bossemote|Peel banana first, eat second.}}
*{{text|bossemote|Poo not good to eat, but very good to throw.}}
*{{text|bossemote|Wet fur not fun to sleep on.}}

==Progression==
