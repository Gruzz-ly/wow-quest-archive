==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ji Firepaw|Ji]] at the [[Dai-Lo Farmstead]]. A cart is waiting near the road to take you there.

==Description==
We have done as [[Master Shang Xi|Master Shang]] asked of us. I will return to the temple to inform the master of our progress. You should continue south on the road to the farmlands to seek out [[Wugou]], the spirit of earth.

Ji awaits you at the Dai-Lo Farmstead, and he'll surely need your help. I must warn you, Ji can be reckless in his directness. Remember well the things I have taught you: discipline and patience.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||25}}

==Completion==
<Name>! I wondered when I would see you again!

Well, the plus side is that finding Wugou, the spirit of earth, was easy enough. Waking him... not so much. I think he's going to wake quite sore from all the pushing and hitting I've done trying to rouse him.

==Notes==
Run more or less due south to reach the road. Before a long bridge, a [[Delivery Cart Tender]] is waiting with a [[Nourished Yak]] and a [[Delivery Cart]]. He calls out:
:{{text|say|Delivery Cart Tender|Hello friend! You're welcome to use my cart if you like. It will take you to the Dai-Lo Farmstead.}}
Interact with the cart for a free trip down there. The trek is quite long on foot, otherwise.

When you arrive at the Dai-Lo Farmstead, you can see that Ji easily found Wugou, the spirit of earth. The elemental spirit is asleep however, and the Huojin monk has a hard time trying to wake him up.

:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|I will break you, little rock man!}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Wake... up... DANGIT!}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|This is ridiculous...}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|You sleep like a rock!}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|There's no way you'll sleep through THIS.}}
:''Ji kicks the gong Wugou is sleeping against, to no avail.''
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Seriously?}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Why...}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|won't...}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|you...}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|just...}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|WAKE UP?!}}
