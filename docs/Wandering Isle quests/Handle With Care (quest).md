==Objectives==
Recover 6 Packed Explosive Charges.
* [[Packed Explosion Charge]] (6)

==Description==
We can help you get your ship free, but we'll need more of the explosives we were trying to take back from the [[Alliance]] to make it happen.

I ordered the men to grab all the explosives they could before making our escape. If you sift through the wreckage and bodies to our south, there should be some explosive bundles among them, those that didn't already blow up anyway.

Get me enough of them and I think I can put something together for ya.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
You're in one piece. That's a good sign.

Did you get your hands on what I asked for?

==Completion==
More than enough. I've got the main control panel constructed. We should be ready very soon!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Evil from the Seas]] before heading out. More killing and looting in the same area.

==Progression==
{{Bidden to Greatness}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
