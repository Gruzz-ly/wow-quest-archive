==Objectives==
Speak to [[Makael Bay]] in the [[Pei-Wu Forest]].

==Description==
To dislodge the alliance ship, we need to find our engineer. He parted ways with us when we were escaping the wreckage.

You should be able to find him somewhere in the western forest. Tell him Korga sent you and he'll get in line to help.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Completion==
Korga sent you, eh? Well, I wouldn't mind doing a number on that ship for my own reasons anyway, but it's going to take some work.

Give me a moment to think...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Let's go find this engineer. Maybe getting this thorn removed won't be as hard as we thought.}}
:''Ji takes off down the path to the west.''
Follow the path west. Makael Bay is at a small Horde camp not far to the northwest of the airship.

==Progression==
