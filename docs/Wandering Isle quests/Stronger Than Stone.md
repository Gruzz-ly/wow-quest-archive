==Objectives==
Gather 12 Abandoned Stone Blocks.
*[[Abandoned Stone Block]] (12)

==Description==
Gather me stone blocks from the [[Ridge of Laughing Winds]] to the south.

You have seen my strength twice, yet I still spy doubt within your eyes. It will not last.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Progress==
The strength of the body cannot exist without the strength of the mind.

==Completion==
Good.

My head, it is harder than the strongest stone.

Step back, and let me dispel your doubts.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Rewritten Wisdoms]] and [[Tools of the Enemy]] before heading out.

Head south to the [[Ridge of Laughing Winds]]. [[Defaced Scroll of Wisdom|Defaced Scrolls of Wisdom]] are hanging from the rocks dotting the valley. Interact with them to burn them. [[:Abandoned Stone Block]]s litter the field, so collect them two at a time. Kill [[Fe-Feng Wiseman|Fe-Feng Wisemen]] to collect [[Paint Soaked Brush]]es. After hitting all three quotas, head back to turn in.

On completion:
:''Jojo Ironbrow sets up a [[Stack of Blocks]].''
:{{text|say|Jojo Ironbrow|These are the densest stones across all of Shen-zin Su, yet they are as nothing before my mighty head.}}
:''Jojo Ironbrow destroys the stone blocks.''
