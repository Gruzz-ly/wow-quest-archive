==Objectives==
Gather 10 Broken Bamboo Stalks.
* [[Broken Bamboo Stalk]] (10)

==Description==
My men are malnourished, injured, and exhausted, but they are [[Horde]]. Every one will fight to their dying breath. As our new ally, we will stand by you when the time comes, but we would stand stronger with weapons.

I have my men out gathering bamboo stalks to fashion into spears. If you can spare the effort, we could use the extra pair of capable hands.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
The Horde does not back down from a fight.

==Completion==
These are excellent! We'll have them crafted into weapons in no time.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Preying on the Predators]] before heading out. Broken Bamboo Stalks and tigers litter the area.

==Progression==
{{Bidden to Greatness}}

==Patch changes==
