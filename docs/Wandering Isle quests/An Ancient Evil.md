==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Vordraka, the Deep Sea Nightmare.jpg|Vordraka, the Deep Sea Nightmare}}
Defeat the{{sic}} Vordraka, the Deep Sea Nightmare.
*{{mob|Vordraka, the Deep Sea Nightmare}} slain

==Description==
<Name>, I was looking for you!

One of the escaping sailors just spotted [[Aysa Cloudsinger|Aysa]] in the [[Wreck of the Skyseeker|wreckage of the ship]], facing some enormous beast. She might need your help - you should go to her, quickly!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Completion==
<Aysa is clearly exhausted from the fight.>

Your skills in battle... are unquestionable... <class>.

<Aysa catches her breath for a moment.>

Did you save the escaped prisoners? ...Where is [[Ji Firepaw|Ji]]? Is he okay?

==Notes==
Head back to the ship to see Vordraka, the Deep Sea Nightmare, a level 10 elite [[saurok]] with 4,752 health, being tanked by Aysa. It has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic melee|39-48 Physical}}
*{{abilities|Deep Sea Smash|range=25|A brutal overhead power attack that increases melee damage by 66 to 77.|notes=3 sec cast. Hits for ~56 Physical}}
*{{abilities|Deep Sea Rupture|range=10-40|Erupts a line of stone towards the target, dealing 12 Physical damage and tossing them into the air.|notes=2 sec cast.}}

:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Thank [[Shen-zin Su]] that you're here. I could use your help!}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Get clear when it when it{{sic}} raises its weapon, it's even stronger than it looks.}}

Aysa should be able to tank him for the entire fight. However, the Deep Sea Rupture ability will target other units on his aggro table. Additionally, during the fight, weak [[Deepscale Aggressor]]s with 172 health will come out aggro on the player. 

:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|It's calling allies! I'll keep him busy while you handle them.}}
Take them out, then go back to focusing on the boss.

:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|We're wearing him down. Keep it up!}}
:''At Vordraka's defeat:''
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|I don't know what I would have done without you. It's good that you came.}}

Once the boss has been defeated, find Aysa on the west side of the ship.
