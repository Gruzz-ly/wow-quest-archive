== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Merchant Lorvo]] by [[Fu's Pond]].

==Description==
In such a short time, you've shown me that you have the potential to be a great <class>. The training grounds are behind you, but now you must prove yourself by facing a far greater challenge, one that none of my students have accomplished.

I want you to return [[Huo]], the spirit of fire, to the [[Temple of Five Dawns]].

My two other most gifted students will help you in this task. The first is [[Aysa Cloudsinger]]. Seek her out at the pool to the west.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||8}}

== Completion ==
You came for Aysa? You... you really shouldn't interrupt her until she finishes her exercises. She doesn't speak to anyone until her routine is done.

In the meantime, could you maybe help me? I had some bad luck with forest [[sprite]]s.

==Notes==
Take a left at the fork where [[Trainee Nim]] waits and follow the path to the southwest. Turn left at the second fork to reach [[Fu's Pond]], where [[Merchant Lorvo]] awaits at the dock.

Passing [[Trainee Guang]]:
:{{text|say|Trainee Guang|You're departing so soon? I am envious of your prowess, <class>. Good luck to you.}}

Approaching [[Merchant Lorvo]]:
:{{text|say|Merchant Lorvo|Shhhh! Come quietly. She's practicing.}}

==Progression==
