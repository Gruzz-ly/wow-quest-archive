==Objectives==
Speak to [[Aysa Cloudsinger]] in the [[Singing Pools]].

==Description==
It is crucial that we bring all of the three remaining spirits back safely. I am too old to do this myself, and for all their strengths, both Aysa and [[Ji Firepaw|Ji]] are single-minded in their ideals.

You possess all the qualities of a hero, and a balance that they do not. It is you that must do this.

[[Shu]], the spirit of water is somewhere in the singing pools to the east. Find Aysa there and work with her to locate him. We are all depending on you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||25}}

==Completion==
It's good to see you again, <name>.

This is the [[Singing Pools#Pools|pool of the skunk]], as I'm sure you noticed.

Over the many ages of [[Shen-zin Su]], animals have died in some of these magical pools. Through their deaths, their spirits were infused into the waters, and anyone touching those waters will take their form.

There are several cursed pools here, some more dangerous than others.

==Notes==
Head east out of the temple. Along the way, [[Cai]] and [[Deng]] attach themselves to the player:
:{{text|say|Cai|Hey there! Are you the one that brought back the fire spirit?}}
:{{text|say|Deng|Was he hot? I bet he was hot!}}
:{{text|say|Cai|Of course he was hot! Don't be dumb, Deng.}}
:{{text|say|Deng|I bet you're really strong, huh? You could probably kick that bridge right in half if you wanted to!}}
:{{text|say|Cai|Nuh uh. Bet they could for sure kick you over that hill, though! Hah!}}
:{{text|say|Cai|Okay bye.}}
:{{text|say|Deng|Bye!}}

Along the way to Aysa is [[Jojo Ironbrow]], a [[monk]] surrounded by many [[Mesmerized Child]]ren and [[Excited Onlooker]]s. Speak with him to pick up [[Stronger Than Reeds]]. Don't go out of the way to find the quest items he is looking for just yet.

==Trivia==
*The cursed pools that turn people into the animals that died there is a reference to the manga ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranma_1/2 Ranma ½]''.
