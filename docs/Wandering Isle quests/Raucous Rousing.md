==Objectives==
Ring the gong.
* Ring the [[Break Gong|town gong]]

==Description==
You ready for this, <name>? I'm thinking maybe we should have looked for something to cover our ears, but it's a bit late for that now. Just remember that the intense ringing you'll be hearing for the next few hours is the ringing sound of victory!

The honor's all yours, <name>. Ring the gong whenever you're ready!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
Come on, <name>! The suspense is killing me!

==Completion==
Huh... well... that's definitely the ringing I expected, but I was hoping for a bit more from Wugou. This guy's a deep sleeper, that's for sure.

It's alright, <name>. I've got another idea, and there's not much preparation needed at all - just how I like it.
