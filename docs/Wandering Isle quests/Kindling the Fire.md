==Objectives==
Gather 5 Dry Doogwood Roots.
*[[Dry Dogwood Root]] (5)

==Description==
Now that that's done with, let's get to it then!

[[Huo]], the spirit of fire, hungers for dry dogwood root kindling. It grows among the trees south of the village. It should be easy enough for you to gather some.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||75}}

==Progress==
I hope you're not shy about getting your hands dirty.

==Completion==
<Name>! You've returned, roots in hand! You're a down-to-business kind of <guy/gal>, aren't you? I like that!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fanning the Flames]] before heading out. Head southwest, mindful of the wandering [[hozen]]. [[Loose Dogwood Root]]s are at the base of the trees surrounding the [[Shrine of the Summer Breeze]]. Interact with the roots to collect the quest items, then use the [[Wind Stone]] item near the Shrine object in the middle of the trees to spawn a [[Living Air]], a level 3 air elemental with 213 health. Destroy it, collect the [[Fluttering Breeze]] from its corpse, then return to the village.

[[Master Shang Xi]] has again made his appearance next to [[Ji Firepaw]]. Speak with him to continue.
