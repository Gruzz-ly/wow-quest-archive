==Objectives==
Retrieve 8 Paint Soaked Brushes.
* [[Paint Soaked Brush]] (8)

==Description==
The [[hozen]] have stolen our brushes and are painting over our scrolls of wisdom with their own wisdoms, if you can call them that. If you're here to help, stop them and bring our brushes back before they can do more harm.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Progress==
I do not wish to disparage the hozen for their aspirations - each race must walk its own path. In this moment, however, they are bringing harm to our bodies and our culture. That is a line that cannot be crossed.

==Completion==
I am very thankful, young one. I will soon begin the slow tasks of documenting all of our wisdoms again, so that the scrolls can be hung for the benefit of all to come.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Rewritten Wisdoms]] and [[Stronger Than Stone]] before heading out.

Head south to the [[Ridge of Laughing Winds]]. [[Defaced Scroll of Wisdom|Defaced Scrolls of Wisdom]] are hanging from the rocks dotting the valley. Interact with them to burn them. [[:Abandoned Stone Block]]s litter the field, so collect them two at a time. Kill [[Fe-Feng Wiseman|Fe-Feng Wisemen]] to collect [[Paint Soaked Brush]]es. After hitting all three quotas, head back to turn in.

==Progression==
