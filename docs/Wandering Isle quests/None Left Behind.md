==Objectives==
Rescue 3 Injured Sailors.
* [[Injured Sailor]]s rescued (3)

==Description==
[[Aysa Cloudsinger|Your friend]] has been doing everything she can to save my crew. I'm deeply appreciative.

We're still dealing with more than we can handle here: quenching the fires on the wreckage, getting my people out, fighting off these evil sea creatures, and trying to prevent the prisoners from escaping. We're simply in over our heads.

I still have men on the ship that we need to get clear before the wreckage collapses on them. I know this is asking a lot, but can you help?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Survival Leggings
|Vest of Compassion
|Gauntlets of Mercy
|Empathetic Mail
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Progress==
This island wasn't on any of our charts... we came through a thick mist and ploughed straight into the forest. We didn't see it coming.

==Completion==
I have no idea who you people are, but fate surely smiled on us this day. Many more would be dead if not for the help of you and your friends. I am in your debt.

==Notes==
[[File:Rescue_injured_sailor.jpg|thumb|You want me to carry this human along with 8 crates of medical supplies?? No problem!]]
Pick up [[Medical Supplies (quest)]] and [[From Bad to Worse (The Wandering Isle)]] before heading out.

More of the same with the killing of [[Deepscale Tormentor]]s and collecting of [[Alliance Medical Crate]]s. Additionally, picking up [[Injured Sailor]]s in and around the ship will give the adventurer a 3-minute buff, during which time he or she should bring the wounded soldier back to camp before it despawns. Only one sailor may be carried at a time.
