== Objectives ==
Rescue the {{NPC||Min Dimwind||Cart Driver}}.
*Rescue the Cart Driver {{co|54.1|20.9|Wandering Isle}}

== Description ==
My driver went running off after the sprites just after they attacked. I don't think they'll really do him any harm, but I need him back to help me clean up the mess by the cart.

He chased them off towards the cliffs to the north. If you head that direction, you should find him quickly.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Cloak of the Compassionate
|Merchant's Satchel}}

You will also receive: {{cost|||50}}

== Progress ==
I should have been more careful.

== Completion ==
You are too kind, <class>.

==Notes==
[[File:The Missing Driver.jpg|thumb|Min back at the cart]]
Pick up [[Items of Utmost Importance]] before heading out. Head north up the hill. [[Amberleaf Scamp]]s are level 2 [[sprite]] elementals, stealing barrels. Kill them to collect their barrels. After collecting six, circle clockwise to the northwest around the hill. On the west side of the hill is [[Min Dimwind]], the driver, trapped by five scamps. Simply run up to Min to "rescue" him:
:{{text|yell|Amberleaf Scamp|Look out! Its friendses are coming!}}
:{{text|yell|Amberleaf Scamp|Run away!}}
:''They scatter.''
:{{text|say|Min Dimwind|[[Master Shang Xi|Master Shang]] has trained you well. Thank you, friend!}}
:{{text|say|Min Dimwind|I couldn't have fought them off alone. Now, if you'll excuse me, I should go find my cart.}}
:''Min starts running to the southwest, stops for a moment and calls out.''
:{{text|yell|Min Dimwind|Cart!}}
:''Not seeing his cart, he resumes running further southwest and calls out again.''
:{{text|yell|Min Dimwind|Cart!}}
:''Still no luck, he runs back along the path to find the cart, still upended.''
:{{text|say|Min Dimwind|Hello, cart. Still upside-downed, I see.}}
:''Min walks to the other side of the cart and waits.''
Return to [[Merchant Lorvo]] back at [[Fu's Pond]] to continue. [[Aysa Cloudsinger|Aysa]] has finished with her task and is waiting next to the merchant:
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|A challenge in compassion and humility. By helping Merchant Lorvo, it would seem you've passed, <class>. Master Shang would be pleased.}}
