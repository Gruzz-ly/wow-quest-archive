==Objectives==
Bring the Jade Tiger Pillar to [[Jojo Ironbrow]] in [[Morning Breeze Village]].
*[[Jade Tiger Pillar]] (provided)

==Description==
[[File:Jade Tiger Pillar.jpg|thumb|The Jade Tiger Pillar]]
This giant jade tiger pillar doesn't seem to fit in amidst the [[hozen]] buildings.

What it does seem is very hard. Very solid.

You know just the person to bring this to.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Jade Hilted Dagger
|Jade Crossbow
|Jade Shield
|Jade Hilted Sword
|Humble Cudgel
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Completion==
GOOD! A true challenge. Let us put this pillar to the test!

==Notes and trivia==
While running to [[Fe-Feng Village]] for [[The Direct Solution]], [[Do No Evil]], and [[Monkey Advisory Warning]], players will run across a [[Jade Tiger Pillar]] just outside town. Interact with the pillar to accept this quest and pick up the pillar, then complete the other three quests before heading back to [[Morning Breeze Village]] to turn in. Ji continues the storyline with [[Balanced Perspective]].

:{{text|say|Jojo Ironbrow|There is only one thing to do. I must smash it! Once and for all, all shall know the power of my mighty brow.}}
:''Jojo Ironbrow sets up the [[Tiger Pillar]] on the [[Tiger Pillar Stand]].''
:''Jojo unleashes his fury, but the pillar just laughs his feeble strikes off.''
:{{text|say|Jojo Ironbrow|Oh... my head... it hurts so badly! I've... the pillar must contain enormous power... perhaps stronger even than my brow...}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Ironbrow|I'm... I'm just going to lie down for a while.. until this headache goes away.}}
:''Jojo falls forward on his knees and passes out before the pillar.''
