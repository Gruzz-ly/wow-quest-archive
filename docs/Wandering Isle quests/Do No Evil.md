==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ruk-Ruk.jpg|Ruk-Ruk}}
Kill Ruk-Ruk.
*[[Ruk-Ruk]] slain

==Description==
<Name>, I need you to understand that the way of the [[Huojin Pandaren|Huojin]] is not the way of violence. When fighting is needed, we will not hesitate, but when fighting is not needed, neither do we instigate. However, the direct solution is often cutting the head off the snake, as they say.

The [[hozen]] have a leader instigating these attacks. If we remove Ruk-Ruk, we won't have to wipe the hozen out entirely.

I know you are not of the Huojin, but are you with me in what must be done, <name>? 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}
*[[Dagger of the Hozen]] (rogue)
*[[Staff of the Hozen]] (hunter/mage/monk/priest)
*[[Sword of the Hozen]] (monk/rogue/shaman/warrior)

==Progress==
Following the Huojin discipline often means making the hard decisions. This is one of those moments.

==Completion==
<Name>, I think you've got a bit of Huojin in you. Stick with me and I'll bring you around, I think.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Direct Solution]] and [[Monkey Advisory Warning]] before heading out.

Head back to town and circle clockwise to the northwest to reach [[Fe-Feng Village]]. Ji Firepaw will join the party just outside town. Immediately outside town is a [[Jade Tiger Pillar]]. Interact with it to pick up [[Stronger Than Bone]] before continuing in to town.

[[Stolen Fireworks]] litter the ground, probably guarded by [[Fe-Feng Firethief|Fe-Feng Firethieves]]. [[Fe-Feng Ruffian]]s are also all over town. Don't go out of the way to kill hozen, as enough will get in the way while collecting fireworks and finding Ruk-Ruk. [[Ruk-Ruk]] can be found all the way off at the western end of the village. He is a level 7 hozen with 1,233 health and no special abilities.

While running back to Morning Breeze, turn in all three quests to Ji. Turn Stronger Than Bone to Jojo to continue.
