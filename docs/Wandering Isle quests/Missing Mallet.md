==Objectives==
Recover the Dai-Lo Recess Mallet at the [[Ki-Han Brewery]].
* [[Dai-Lo Recess Mallet]]

==Description==
<Name>, I've got it! It's simple really. Let's make a ruckus so loud that there's no way he can sleep through it.

Why look at that, a conveniently placed gong! Makes me think this may just be how they've awoken him in the past. We just need the matching mallet to get it ringing as loud as possible.

The [[Gao Summerdraft|village leader]] tells me the mallet is over at the Ki-Han Brewery on the river, to the southwest. It's not far. Mind picking it up for me while I give the village some fair warning? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Silk Shoes
|Summer Shoes
|Dancing Boots
|Ringing Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Progress==
Well, they're as warned as they're going to get. Do you have the mallet?

==Completion==
Hah, <name>! Now that's a mallet if I've ever seen one! Let's make some noise.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stronger Than Wood]] before heading out. Head southwest along the path and take a left to reach the brewery. Find [[Raggis]], a level 7 named [[virmen]] with 822 health, in front of the brewery. Kill Raggis to acquire the [[Dai-Lo Recess Mallet]] sitting behind him. Gather planks in the area, two at a time, then head back to town.
