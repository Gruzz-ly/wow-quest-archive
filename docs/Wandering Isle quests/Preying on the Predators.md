==Objectives==
Kill 9 Pei-Wu Tigers.
* [[Pei-Wu Tiger]] slain (9)

==Description==
The forest has become far more dangerous ever since [[Shen-zin Su]] began shaking. The [[tiger]]s are agitated and have begun attacking the refugees, and on occasion, me as well.

If these injured and weak survivors are to make it to safety here at the [[Forlorn Hut|hut]], we need to help clear the forest for them. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
Grim work. I've lived in peace with these tigers for as long as I can remember.

==Completion==
These survivors are in your debt, <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stocking Stalks]] before heading out. [[Broken Bamboo Stalk]]s and tigers litter the area.

[[Pei-Wu Tiger Cub]]s do not count for this quest.

==Progression==
{{Bidden to Greatness}}
