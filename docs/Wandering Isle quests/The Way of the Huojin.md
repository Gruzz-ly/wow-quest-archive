Kill 8 Fe-Feng attackers.

==Description==
We call those vicious monkeys swinging into town [[hozen]]. They keep to themselves normally, but they know something bad is coming, so they're here to steal our supplies.

In situations like these, the clear answer is the only answer. These monkeys will leave when we force them to leave! To not defend our town and those we love would be the only true crime. Thus is the way of the [[Huojin Pandaren|Huojin]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Initiate's Leggings
|Initiate's Britches
|Initiate's Legguards
|Initiate's Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|||55}}
*200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Progress==
To not act is to abandon reason.

==Completion==
You've got some fight in you! I think I like you!

==Notes==
Any invading hozen count: plain [[Fe-Feng Hozen|hozen]], [[Fe-Feng Brewthief|brewthieves]], and [[Fe-Feng Leaper|leapers]].
