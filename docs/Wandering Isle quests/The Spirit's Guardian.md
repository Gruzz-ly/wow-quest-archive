== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Master Li Fei]] in the [[Shrine of Inner-Light]].

== Description ==
You've done very well this far, my student. You have the materials you need to rekindle [[Huo]], the spirit of fire.

In the cave to southwest he awaits, but he is guarded by Master Li Fei, the pandaren elder you met in the [[Cave of Meditation]]. Go to Master Li Fei with the offerings. Prove yourself, then meet with Huo.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||20}}

== Completion ==
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself. There is a path before you, but you choose the trials you will face, and the trials you will overcome.

== Notes ==
Head southwest to find another cave, the [[Shrine of Inner-Light]] at the end of the path. Just inside is a {{NPC||Huojin Monk}}:
:{{text|say|Huojin Monk|The fire spirit is upset. It's dangerous to enter the shrine now...}}
Gouts of fire are shooting up from the ground. Avoid them while progressing through the tunnel. The ground lights up several seconds before the gout appears, so be careful as the fire ticks for 28-35 damage, several times a second!

Past the fire tunnel, head up the ramp to find Master Li Fei. Speak with him to continue.
