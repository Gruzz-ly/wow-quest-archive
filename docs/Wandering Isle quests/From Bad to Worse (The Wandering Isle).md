==Objectives==
Defeat 8 Deepscale Tormentors.
*[[Deepscale Tormentor]] slain (8)

==Description==
After their ship crashed, evil creatures swept up from the sea to pick through the wreckage. Our aid may seem but a drop in the pond at the thought of the misfortune they've faced today.

Defeat their tormentors. These people desperately need our help.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
This is a grim site indeed.

==Completion==
You are a fear to behold upon the battlefield.

==Notes==
Pick up [[None Left Behind]] and [[Medical Supplies (quest)]] before heading out.

More of the same with the killing of [[Deepscale Tormentor]]s and collecting of [[Alliance Medical Crate]]s. Additionally, picking up [[Injured Sailor]]s in and around the ship will give the adventurer a 3-minute buff, during which time he or she should bring the wounded soldier back to camp before it despawns. Only one sailor may be carried at a time.
