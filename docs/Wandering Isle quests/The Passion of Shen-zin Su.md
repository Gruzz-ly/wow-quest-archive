==Objectives==
Bring the Spirit of Fire to the [[Temple of Five Dawns]].
*Bring the Spirit of Fire to the Temple of Five Dawns

==Description==
<[[Huo]] bounces around excited, ready to follow you.>

<[[Master Shang Xi]] fold you to bring Huo to meet him at the Temple of Five Dawns in the center of the island. Your next destination lies before you.>

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||50}}, and one of:
* [[Shield of Blazing Will]] (shaman/warrior)
* [[Sword of the Burning Spirit]] (warrior)
* [[Dagger of Silent Flame]] (mage/priest/rogue)
* [[Flameheart Crossbow]] (hunter)

==Completion==
<Name>, you've done very well. Huo, the spirit of fire, is here. The temple flames are reignited. You accomplished the challenge I put before you, and with seeming ease.

There is a greater purpose in bringing Huo to the temple. It is time that I tell you more of things to come.

==Notes==
[[File:Chia-Hui, Lin, and Zhen.jpg|thumb|Chia-Hu, Lin, and Zhen]]
From Huo's position, take the right path, a quicker route to the mouth of the cave. Huo's presence blesses adventurers with faster movement speed (150% of run speed), so take advantage of this to make good time. Exit the cave and turn right, heading southeast. Follow the path past the [[Shrine of the Summer Breeze]] to the base of the [[Dawning Stair]], where [[Chia-hui Autumnleaf]], [[Brewer Lin]], and [[Brewer Zhen]] are having an animated conversation before noticing the adventurer dragging a certain fire spirit around:
:{{text|say|Chia-hui Autumnleaf|Is that... is that Huo?}}
:{{text|say|Brewer Lin|It is! Well done, <name>!}}
Head up the stair to reach the [[Temple of Five Dawns]]. [[Master Shang Xi]] is inside. As Huo reaches Shang Xi, he flies to the center of the room and light up the torches and braziers:
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|Welcome, Huo. The people have missed your warmth.}}

After this, [[Ji Firepaw]] and [[Aysa Cloudsinger]] will arrive. On complete:
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|You have conquered every challenge I put before you, <name>. You have found Huo and brought him safely to the temple.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|There is a much larger problem we face now, my students. [[Shen-zin Su]] is in pain. If we do not act, the very land on which we stand could die, and all of us with it.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|We need to speak to Shen-zin Su and discover how to heal it. And to do that, we need the four elemental spirits returned. Huo was the first.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|Ji, I'd like you to go to the [[Dai-Lo Farmstead]] in search of [[Wugou]], the spirit of earth.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|On it!}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|Aysa, I want you to go to the [[Singing Pools]] to find [[Shu]], the spirit of water.}}
:{{text|say|Aysa Cloudsinger|Yes master.}}
:{{text|say|Master Shang Xi|And <name>, you shall be the hand that guides us all. Speak with me for a moment before you join Aysa at the Singing Pools to the east.}}
