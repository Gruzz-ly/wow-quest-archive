==Objectives==
Retrieve a Fluttering Breeze.
* [[Fluttering Breeze]] {{co|47.3|31.5|Wandering Isle}}
* [[Wind Stone]] (provided)

==Description==
Strange thing about wind, it can be hard to wrap your hands around it.

Best practice for me has been finding some sort of living wind. If it can punch you, you can punch it back, and it won't slip through your grasp.

Head over to the [[Shrine of the Summer Breeze]] to the south and summon just such a living wind using this wind stone. Best it, gather a Fluttering Breeze from it, and come back over this way so that we can figure out what's next.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||75}}
* [[Initiate's Slippers]] (mage/priest)
* [[Initiate's Footgear]] (monk/rogue/shaman/hunter)
* [[Initiate's Boots (mail)]] (warrior)
*[[Initiate's Sabatons]]

==Progress==
When opportunity rises, it is our responsibility to reach out and grab it. Second guessing is as good as giving up.

==Completion==
You know what it is to seize opportunity. I think you and I are kindred spirits, <name>.

==Notes==
[[File:Living Air.jpg|thumb|The [[Living Air]] possessing the [[Fluttering Breeze]].]]
Pick up [[Kindling the Fire]] before heading out. Head southwest, mindful of the wandering [[hozen]]. [[Loose Dogwood Root]]s are at the base of the trees surrounding the [[Shrine of the Summer Breeze]]. Interact with the roots to collect the quest items, then use the [[Wind Stone]] item near the Shrine object in the middle of the trees to spawn a [[Living Air]], a level 3 air elemental with 213 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic melee|~7 Physical}}
*{{abilities|Lightning Bolt|range=40|Blasts an enemy with lightning, inflicting Nature damage.|notes=3 sec cast. 10-11 Nature damage}}
*{{abilities|Lightning Cloud|range=30|Creates a cloud of lightning that lasts 15 sec., blasting all enemies in a selected area for 37 to 41 Nature damage and inflicting 25 additional damage every 5 sec.|notes=3 sec cast}}
Destroy the Living Air, collect the [[Fluttering Breeze]] from its corpse, then return to the village.

[[Master Shang Xi]] has again made his appearance next to [[Ji Firepaw]]. Speak with him to continue.
