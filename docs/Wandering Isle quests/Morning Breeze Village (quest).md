==Objectives==
Meet with [[Ji Firepaw]] in [[Morning Breeze Village]].

==Description==
The fourth and final spirit is [[Dafeng]], the spirit of air. When he is not in the skies, he can be found on the [[Ridge of Laughing Winds]] to the west. I've sent both [[Aysa Cloudsinger|Aysa]] and Ji to help you find him.

When you are ready, I will summon winds to carry you to the top of the temple. From there, cross the bridges to the west and find Ji in Morning Breeze Village.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Completion==
<Name>, give me a hug! Our parting was not so long this time - I quite prefer it that way!

You've been working with Aysa, have you not? Our disciplines have always kept us apart, so I know little of her. Watching her perform her exercises now, I must confess that she possesses a grace and discipline that is strangely alluring.

There are more pressing thoughts though, aren't there? <name>, let's take care of this monkey problem while we search for Dafeng.

==Notes==
With [[Shu]] now at the temple, rain starts pouring on the [[Legacy of Liu Lang]]. On accept, Master Shang Xi will envelop the adventurer in a whirlwind, depositing the player up at the top of the temple, where Ji Firepaw awaits:

:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Hey <name>! This way to Morning Breeze Village.}}

Exit the temple and take the southwest bridge. Cross the [[Dawning Span]] over the valley far below to the [[Ridge of Laughing Winds]]. While you cross the bridge, you can see [[Zhao-Ren]] the Onyx Serpent flying in the sky. [[Lorewalker Zan]] also invites you to a room in order to see a private lesson about the story of [[Liu Lang]] by [[Lorewalker Amai]].

:{{text|say|Lorewalker Zan|Hello <name>! The Lorewalker is beginning her lesson just down these stairs if you want to listen in.}}

When you are finished go north to the [[Morning Breeze Village]]. Ji is down on the dock by the lake near the huge hot air balloon.
In response to reading his completion text, if you hug Ji Firepaw, he will respond with:
:{{Text|Emote|Ji Firepaw warmly hugs you back.}}
