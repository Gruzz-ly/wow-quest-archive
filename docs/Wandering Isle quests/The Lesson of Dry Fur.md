==Objectives==
Cross the balance poles and ring the training bell.
* Ring the [[Training Bell]]

==Description==
Through meditation, I intend to find a route to locating [[Shu]]. In the meantime, you would benefit from practice and discipline.

Your first is the task of all trainees entering the pools: cross the balance poles to the west and ring the bell without falling into the pool.

Should you fall, the pool's curse will make it [[Singing Pools#Pools|difficult]] to get on a pole again, so you will need to return to the edge of the pool to start over.

Oh, and beware the [[crane]]s.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Unmarred Cord
|Unmarred Waistband
|Unmarred Belt
|Unmarred Chain
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shang Xi's Academy]]

==Progress==
Have you done as I asked of you?

==Completion==
Good. You're a quick study.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Lesson of the Balanced Rock]] before heading out. Remember to keep looking for [[Hard Tearwood Reed]]s in the pools.

Head southwest from Aysa's position and cross under the bridge to reach the Pool of Cursed Frog. Players must be on dry land in order to jump onto the balance poles. Players who miss the poles and land in the pool are turned into frogs. Cranes find frogs delicious and are hostile to any adventurers-cum-frogs near them. Escape the water to resume humanoid form in order to fend them off.

While on the poles, defeat six [[Tushui Monk]]s, then keep jumping toward the [[Training Bell]] on the west side of the pool surrounded by poles. Making it to one of the surrounding poles will cause the player to jump to the rock in the middle with the bell. Interact with the bell to ring it, then jump back toward land.

[[Stronger Than Reeds]] is required to continue, so make sure to gather all eight reeds.
