==Objectives==
Kill 10 Virmen.
*[[Plump Virmen]] slain (10)

==Description==
I'll keep trying to find ways to wake this stubborn little guy up, but there is no shortage of trouble on the island it seems. The crops to the south are infested with [[virmen]], [[rabbit]]-like thieves and pillagers.

Rascals!

They breed faster than we can kill them! I have the perfect solution for such a situation: kill them faster! With you here, <name>, that shouldn't be a problem.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
We need to kill them down to the very last one! We can leave that one alive I suppose, but if there's more than one, our troubles are going to start all over again!

==Completion==
<Name>, that's the way to do it! You show up, and problems start getting solved. That's just one of many reasons I like you!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Still Good!]] before heading out. Head southeast into the fields and get cracking. Turnips are found down to the southwest, more carrots can be found underground in the [[Teeming Burrow]], and the pumpkins can be found past the eastern end of the [[Rows]] in the [[Virmen Grotto]].

Also in the burrow are [[Plump Carrotcruncher]]s, which also count for Rascals.
