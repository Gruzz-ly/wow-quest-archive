==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ji Firepaw]] in [[Wu-Song Village]].

==Description==
Another of my most talented students is awaiting you in Wu-Song Village to the northwest. He is of a different mind than Aysa, but in their differences, they bring balance to each other.

Ji Firepaw will instruct you on gathering the offerings for the spirit of fire. Trust in his wisdom.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||13}}

==Completion==
Hello! You look poised and confident... I like that!

I've heard some rather impressive whispers about you from the [[Shang Xi Training Grounds|training grounds]]. If you're half as capable as they say, I think you and I are going to be good friends!

==Notes==
Head north out of the cave, turn left and head east on the path, then turn right at the big fork and head north to reach the village. Ji Firepaw is standing guard, as [[Fe-Feng Hozen]] are raiding the village! Speak with him to continue.
