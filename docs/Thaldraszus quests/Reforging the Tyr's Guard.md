==Objectives==
Meet [[Travard]] at the [[Tyr's Guard]] camp in [[Brackenhide Hollow]].

==Description==
After [[Tomb of Tyr|the tomb]] was destroyed and the [[:Silver Scale]] failed to bring [[Tyr]] back, I made the decision to rededicate my life to [[Tyr]].

And I made the even harder decision to leave the past behind and reforge Tyr's Guard.

I had faith Tyr would need me again soon. And, after consulting with the [[Knights of the Silver Hand|Silver Hand]], [[Koranos]] and I believe we have found four worthy Tyr's Guard recruits.

Come with me to Brackenhide Hollow, and assist me in their final training. Then we can venture into the [[timeways]] to find Tyr's disc.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Now that you're here, we can get started with my recruits' final trials.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Chromie]]|Thanks for coming back so quickly, Travard! I didn't want to interrupt you training your recruits. Especially since we need them... now.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Eternus]]|Sending untested [[paladin]] recruits to set the beacons? This is the plan?}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|"Untested" is not quite true, Eternus. My four recruits have gone through rigorous training.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|They are now ready for their last assignments in Brackenhide Hollow before they become full-fledged members of Tyr's Guard.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|With <name> to help them finish their training, they should be just the help we need to deploy these beacons.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Meet me in Brackenhide Hollow, <name>. We must make my recruits ready for the task at hand.}}
:''Travard mounts his white gryphon and flies off.''

;Travard's gossip
:Koranos has been very helpful for recruiting paladins into the Tyr's Guard.

:Seeing a [[titan watcher]] in the flesh... er, stone... makes Tyr seem all the more real.

Head to Brackenhide Hollow and find the paladins at {{co|17.60|31.46|Azure Span}}.

;Upon approach
:{{Text|say|Travard|Tyr knew then that he and Zakajz were evenly matched.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|He gathered all the Light within him and unleashed it at the C'thraxxi, destroying him. But Tyr perished as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|He sacrificed himself for the vrykul! What a selfless thing to do!}}
