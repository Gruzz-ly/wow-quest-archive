==Objectives==
Use [[Senegos]]'s Arcane Ball to roll up the creatures lurking in the [[Veiled Ossuary]].
*Arcane ball activated
*Veiled Ossuary cleaned up
*Speak with Senegos further within the Veiled Ossuary.

==Description==
I remember having so much fun rolling these creatures up with my spells. Unfortunately, I fear these old bones will not let me move as quickly as I once did.

I would love for you to give it a shot. Let me live vicariously through you!

The more creatures you roll up, the bigger the ball becomes. The bigger the ball, the bigger the creature you can roll out.

Speak to me and I shall give you my special [[arcane]] ball to roll up the creatures around here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones

==Completion==
Fine work! Ah, to be young again.

==Notes==
Speak with Senegos:
:I have so many memories of this place... though I fear I've forgotten far more than I remember.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready to use the Arcane Ball to clean up the Veiled Ossuary.}}

You control the [[Rolling Sphere]] and the Arcane Energy bar appears. Walk through the nearby [[Skittering Boneborer]]s to collect their energy. Avoid [[Veiled Damselfly|Veiled Damselflies]] and [[Darkclaw Scythid]]s that knock you back.

;Energy collected
:{{Text|say|Senegos|You're getting the hang of it now! I spent so much time rolling up creatures in my youth...}}
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Grandfather, this seems highly inefficient. Don't you have spells to clear the creatures out instantly?}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|My dear Stellagosa, when you live as long as we do, you must sometimes favor enjoying life over being efficient.}}
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Hrm... I admit the charm is growing on me a bit.}}

Now with the bigger ball, it is possible to collect the damselflies as well. Collect the mobs until the ball gets even bigger, which lets you to collect the scythids.

:{{Text|say|Senegos|Very good! Bring the ball closer to the top tomb entrance and launch it into the sky.}}

The Launch! ability button appears. Bring the ball to the Arcane Launcher power circle on top of the ossuary and launch it in to the air.

Enter the main chamber:
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|If the blue dragons frowned upon your ball escapades, why were you allowed to continue doing it?}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Malygos was quite amused by it. He even joined me a few times when time allowed it... and when he was a much more lighthearted Aspect.}}

This quest is likely a reference to the ''{{wp|Katamari Damacy}}'' video game series.
