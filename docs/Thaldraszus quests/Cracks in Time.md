==Objectives==
Use the East and West crystals to further empower your Timewalker Staff.
*West Crystal yanked {{co|58.4|83.2|Thaldraszus}}
*East Crystal yanked {{co|60.8|80.5|Thaldraszus}}
*Temporal energy collected (100)

==Description==
When the temple locked down, the Wardens got sealed up with the temple doors. We need to pop that stasis bubble to get them out! Unfortunately, that'll need a fully empowered Timewalker staff...

I know! You can drain the crystals here on the platforms! That should power up your staff enough.

They have their own stasis fields, so just yank them out and absorb their energy with your staff.

And don't feel bad if they shatter--the power is still there, even if it's in pieces!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Highland Drake: Spiked Tail]]
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I've been meaning to order a new pair of crystals from Valdrakken anyway.

==Completion==
Excellent work!

You should be cooking with more than enough time juice to release the Wardens now!

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|<Name>! I require your assistance as well!}}

He starts [[Quelling Causalities]].

At the southwestern and northeastern extent of the quest area are Bronze Power Crystals, in time bubbles. Don't try to walk into one, as it'll knock the player away.

An [[Extra Action Button]] appears while near it:
:{{Abilities|Termporal Destabilizing Beam|Disrupts Bronze stasis bubbles.|range=10|notes=Channeled|id=373029|icon=inv_staff_1h_drakonid_c_01}}

Use it, and a tether appears:
:{{text|bossemote|Pull on the timestream to free the crystal!}}

Run away from the crystal to yank it off the stand it's on, but...
*{{text|say|Chromie|Whoops! Don't worry we can replace those crystals... At least, I think we can.}}
*{{text|say|Chromie|It's okay! Just use your staff on the shards instead!}}

It shatters into several [[Temporal Crystal Chunk]]s, so loot them to continue.
