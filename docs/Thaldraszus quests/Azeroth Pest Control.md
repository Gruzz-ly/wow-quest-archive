'''Azeroth Pest Control''' begins the "Gardens of Unity" chapter of the [[Thaldraszus storyline]]. This chapter's ultimate reward is the [[Lord Basilton]] pet.

==Objectives==
Kill 8 Agitated Seedlings in [[Gardens of Unity|the Gardens]].
*[[Agitated Seedling]] slain (8)

==Description==
You there! Hatchling!

Lend me a hand, won't you? These [[podling]]s are ripping up all my plants!

All kinds of [[elemental]]s have invaded the gardens, and they seem to be... affecting the wildlife. It's like their energy has driven these podlings mad! More mad than usual!

I've got my hands full with just these three. Please! Before they rip up all my flower beds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62|}}
*8,200 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I'm too old to be fighting podlings!

==Completion==
Thank the [[Titan]]s you showed up! Otherwise I don't know if I'd ever get these pests to leave.

So what do you say to helping an old Drakonid out with the rest of the gardens?

==Notes==
[[Garden Filly|Garden Fillies]], [[Garden Herdmare]]s, and [[Fierce Herdstallion]]s also count.

On return, Gryrmpech has managed to fend off the podlings attacking him.

==Progression==
{{Gardens of Unity}}

==Patch changes==
