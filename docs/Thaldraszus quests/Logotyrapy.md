'''Logotyrapy''' begins a week after completing [[Time to Process]]. [[Valunei]] will send players the [[Letter from Valunei]] using the in-game mail system to start this quest.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Tyr]] at [[Tyr's Rest]].
*Speak with Tyr
*[[Letter from Valunei]]

==Description==
Dear <name>,

It seems almost wrong to say, but I am worried about Tyr. When he arrived at Tyr's Rest, he spent many days talking with us. We all asked him many questions, learning about the [[titan]]s, ancient history, and what it means to be good.

But recently, Tyr has been speaking less, and the answers he does give are shorter and some have an edge to them.

I'm not sure what's wrong, but something is different. Will you come speak with him?

For Tyr,<br>
[[Valunei]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
*[[Tabard of the Tyr's Guard]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Tyr seems restless. Perhaps you could talk to him, <name>?

==Completion==
I hope, <name>, that we can find the greater purpose for which we've been reforged. For both Tyr, and the [[Tyr's Guard]].

Perhaps that search is the next step of our journey.

==Notes==
Speak with Tyr:
:{{Gossip|quest=|Is something the matter, Tyr?}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|I am pleased to see that my legacy lives on in your Tyr's Guard and the [[Knights of the Silver Hand|Silver Hand]].}}
:{{Text|say|[[Travard]]|Of course! [[Azeroth|The world]] needs order. Your dedication to that and the titans inspires many people!}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|This world is alien to me now. My last battle was long before your kind appeared. The [[dragon]]s walk their own path. I have no place on Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|I... I disagree. All that has led up to this point--finding [[Silver Scale|the Scale]], seeing your memories, the Guard being blessed by the [[Light]]...}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|All of that points to some greater purpose. We... we just haven't found it yet.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|Perhaps. I hope you are right, Captain Travard.}}
