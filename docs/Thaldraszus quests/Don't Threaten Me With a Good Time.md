==Objectives==
Collect 100 Arcane Residue from [[Volatile Arcana]] in The [[Cascades]].
*[[Arcane Residue]] (100)

==Description==
[[Emberthal]] seems worried, but I'm sure she'll come back. And when she does, she'll pick a [[visage]] form!

[[Chromie]] told us all about the celebrations [[dragon]]s used to have for [[Visage Day]].

So, [[Kalecgos]] and I are going to blow stuff up! Fireworks, mostly.

We'll need some [[arcane]] residue to make them, though.

Conveniently, there are some [[arcane elemental]]s just outside the [[Gardens of Unity]] that are ripe for the harvest.

The three of us have some other preparations to make here in Valdrakken.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These volatile elementals make the perfect base for fireworks!

==Completion==
Now we're talking!

==Notes==
Head south of Valdrakken and around {{co|39.1|71.4|Thaldraszus}} kill [[Volatile Arcana]] to loot the residue.

==Progression==
{{Identity Crisis}}

==Speculation==
*The title of the quest may be a reference to the song of the same name by the band Panic! at the Disco

==Patch changes==
