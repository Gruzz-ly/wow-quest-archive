==Objectives==
Kill 8 Screechflight Witherers and 10 Screechflight Hexclaws.
*[[Screechflight Witherer]] slain (8)
*[[Screechflight Hexclaw]] slain (10)

==Description==
I was curious about [[Harpy|these strange, winged creatures]] and attempted to introduce myself. I would have been eaten if not for [[Harleen Chirpsnide|Professor Chirpsnide]] and her [[Full-Winged Peckinator|large mechanical fowl]]!

Could you help us deal with these "[[Screechflight]]"? The native [[Bluefeather Roc]]s are having a difficult time defending their nests from them.

Also, I'd hate for anymore introductions to go the way mine did with them...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|27|62}}
*8,200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
The only thing I can thank these harpies for is giving me the chance to meet the professor!

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>!

I've been assisting the good Professor while you've been gone. I'm afraid to say I've made things worse for her...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Segallia|Is this how all harpies are? They're surprisingly bloodthirsty for being so sentient!}}

The enemy mobs are just outside the cave.

==Progression==
