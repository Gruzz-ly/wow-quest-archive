==Objectives==
Extract time-lost essence from slain time-lost creatures in the [[Shifting Sands]].
*[[Time-Lost Essence]] (30)
*[[Epoch Extractor]] (provided)

==Description==
I need you to fetch me some time-lost essence. The creatures around here are filled to the brim with the stuff.

Snuff them out and then use this epoch extractor to collect their essence. We'll make good use of it for our next step!

And yes, this is going to be a multi-step process. You know how crazy these time shenanigans get!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,500 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
What's this? Time-lost essence? An epoch... extractor?

==Completion==
Not sure what this all is, but I suppose I'll find some use for it. Best to not let it go to waste.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Text|say|Future Chromie|Thanks for doing these tasks for me! It's REALLY helpful!}}
:{{Text|say|Future Chromie|With your help, [[Nozdormu]] won't have to worry about a thing. Trust me on that.}}
:''Chromie enters a time portal.''

Kill the Time-Lost mobs in the Shifting Sands and use the Epoch Extractor on their corpses to obtain the essence.

Turn in east of the [[Temporal Conflux]] on a small ridge. There, [[Chromie]] is looking at [[Future Chromie]]:
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Who ARE you?}}
:{{Text|emote|Future Chromie stares silently.}}
:''Future Chromie turns away and enters a time portal.''
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Now <name> is here? What is going on?}}

Chromie has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Can you please explain what's going on? I came here to find out who's twisting our timeways, only to find myself! Well, not me me, but another me.
