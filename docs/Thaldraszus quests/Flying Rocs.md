==Objectives==
Assist 8 Injured Bluefeather Rocs.
*Mend [[Injured Bluefeather Roc]] (8)
*[[Ornithological Medical Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
The name is Professor [[Harleen Chirpsnide]], infamous ornithologist extraordinaire! I came here to study the mythical [[Bluefeather Roc]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]], but I suppose we've got bigger fowl to fry.

I bet these [[Harpy|harpies]] flew in from [[Kalimdor]] when the Isles opened up. They're highly invasive and feasting like a [[pack]] of [[ogre]]s at the [[Bilgewater Casino]] buffet.

Let's give the native [[roc]]s here a fighting chance. Take this medical kit and use it to get the injured ones back on their feet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62|}}
*8,200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Don't worry about using up my supplies. I'm good pals with the clerks at the [[Dragonscale Expedition|Expedition]]'s reimbursement office.

==Completion==
A full-feathered job, <name>!

I would have helped you with the healing and the slaying, but I'm more of an 'ideas [[goblin]]' these days.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|[[Segallia]]! Don't you dare break my [[:Feather-Plucker 3300]] when you go into that cave!}}
:{{Text|say|Segallia|I'll guard it with my life, Miss Professor Chirpsnide, Ma'am!!}}
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|No "Ma'am". Just call me Professor, and you can save the "Ma'am" for crunch time.}}

The injured rocs are just outside the cave.
