==Objectives==
Gather 6 enchanted quills.
*[[Enchanted Quill (Thaldraszus)|Quills]] apprehended (6)

==Description==
<Name>, we need to stop the quills from inciting [[Flightless|the rebels]] long enough for us to be heard.

Their leader, [[Instigator Belaphon|Belaphon]], seems to be giving the quills a degree of autonomy with that glowing staff. Gather up as many as you can, so they can't keep reproducing her words.

Once they're out of commission, we'll confront her directly - but we don't want the quills to scatter and continue spreading these messages.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 51,350 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
How many quills have you found, <name>?

==Completion==
If we didn't gather up those quills, they'd keep inciting [[dragonkin]], and we'd keep having more rebels to deal with. Thank you for putting a stop to them.

==Progression==
{{Rebel Dragonkin}}
