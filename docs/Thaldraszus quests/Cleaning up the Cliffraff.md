==Objectives==
Meet [[Maldra Flametongue|Maldra]] and [[Investigator Erima|Erima]] at the [[Rebellious Cliffs]].

==Description==
<Name>! Maldra has been going through the propaganda you retrieved, using ciphers she knew from her days as a [[Flightless|rebel]].

She found a coded message that led her to another rebel camp, where [[Instigator Belaphon|Belaphon]] is stirring up rebellion among anyone she can.

Maldra and Inspector Erima are already there - go join them and let's see if we can finally put a stop to this rebellion!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 5,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The rebels are finding their way here from [[Scalewatch Caverns|Scalewatch]] and other locations, based on the same ciphers Maldra found, <name>. Now there are far too many rebels for us to stop Belaphon without your help.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Captain Drine|I hope this excursion proved useful, my queen.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]]|Indeed. <name> helped me understand the rebels' mindset more clearly.}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Drine|Will that help us to finally defeat them?}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|No. But these rebels are from [[Dragonflight|our flights]]; it is my hope that we will not need to "defeat" them.}}
