==Objectives==
Retrieve the Primary Security Disc and Secondary Security Disc within [[Tyrhold]].
*[[Primary Security Disc]] {{co|57.8|53.6|Thaldraszus}}
*[[Secondary Security Disc]] {{co|57.7|63.7|Thaldraszus}}
*[[Tyrhold Conduit]] (provided)

==Description==
The security in the forge is stricter than in another other area of Tyrhold. This will be quite a challenge for us, <class>.

Only certain units around the citadel have the capability to bypass this security, and the protocols to unlock require more than one code in case of corruption.

These units will not want to relinquish their overrides, you may have to take them by force. Be careful, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18|}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope we have not disrupted Tyrhold greatly. May the Keeper forgive us.

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>. With these we can override the lockdown and complete the task Tyr left behind.

==Notes==
Players are again provided the [[Tyrhold Conduit]] and the Titanic Overload [[Extra Action Button]].

The [[Primary Security Disc]] is held by the [[Maiden of Diligence]] at the northwestern end of Tyrhold. Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Diligence|I will fulfill my duty!}}
Or
:{{text|say|Maiden of Diligence|For Tyrhold!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Diligence|It was... my... charge...}}

The [[Secondary Security Disc]] is held by the [[Maiden of Patience]] at the southwestern end of Tyrhold. Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Patience|Your punishment will be eternal.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Patience|Impatient!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Patience|I... could not... last...}}

On complete:
:''Koranos channels a spell into the forge console.''
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|We should be able to override the security lockdown with these discs.}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|The forge has been reactivated. Now readying the next stage of silver protocol.}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|By the [[titan]]s! What did Keeper Tyr leave behind for us?}}
