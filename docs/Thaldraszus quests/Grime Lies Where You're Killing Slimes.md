Collect Time Grime.
*[[Time Grime]] (8)

==Description==
Did you see that? Some of the [[Ooze|slimes]] are leaving little piles of grime behind. Hmm...

[[Melly Teletone|Melly]] makes stuff out of all kinds of things. You think she could use the grime to help out [[Temporal Investigator Tempo|Tempo]]? I bet she could.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

Loot the grimes from [[Time Grime Pile]]s.
