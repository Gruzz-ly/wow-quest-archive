==Objectives==
Place the [[:Silver Scale]] at the forge in [[Tyrhold]].
*Place the Silver Scale {{co|60.5|58.7|Thaldraszus}}
*Activate the Forge
*Speak to [[Koranos]] in Tyrhold.

==Description==
<The echo speaks with an ancient voice.>

To my dear friends, I apologize for my sudden departure.

But, I promise that you are not without my aid. I know that you have come upon the time of great need, but to ensure this gift does not get misused I must ask you to perform a series of tasks.

The first is simple: reactivate the forge within Tyrhold. The Silver Scale is the key.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You have a means to activate the forge?

==Completion==
It appears activating the forge is not so simple as you were led to believe.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Tyr always was the most clever of all the [[keeper]]s.}}

Head to the forge at the center of Tyrhold:
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|Ah, <name>! I was going to check if the console here could provide us any new information. Have you found anything?}}

Place the Silver Scale on the console, then interact with the [[Forge Console]]:
:''The console knocks the player away from it.''
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|Hmm... the lockdown protocol here seems quite intact.}}

==Progression==
{{The Silver Purpose}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
