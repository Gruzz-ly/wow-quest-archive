==Objectives==
Collect ingredients to replace Little Jetstream's dressings.
*[[Sun-Baked Linens]] (6)
*[[Anesthetic Pollen]] (40)
*[[Little Jetstream]] bandaged

==Description==
Making potions for [[Gelikyr Post|Gelikyr]] means that I don't have time for my other duties.

A [[duck]] landed in my garden with a broken rib. I've tended to the wound, but her dressing needs replacing. And since you're so eager to help...

<Szareth shoves a list of ingredients into your hand.>

This is what you'll need. Bring the rest to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*8,200 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
<Szareth takes the extra pollen and linens, then looks toward their hut.>

Ducks have to contend with [[Harpy|harpies]] further up the cliffside. The wounded land here, and I aid them how I can.

I hope this one will make it.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Szareth|Replace the linens, massage the pollen into the duck's feathers. And try not to wake her--she needs rest.}}

Look around the area to find [[Handwoven Basket]]s and [[Magnificent Flower]]s. Picking them aggroes the [[Productive Pollinator]]s. They also drop the pollen, but jumping in the nearby water clears the debuff. Once the material is gathered, enter the building to treat the wounded duck.

==Progression==
{{Bleeding Hearts}}

==Alpha version==

*Name: A Life Well Lived

;Objectives
Complete [[Szareth]]'s chores.
*[[Misplaced Vial]] (8)

;Description
Before you go, one thing. Brewing potions takes time--time I would otherwise spend tending to my garden and tidying my home. And since you're so eager to help... <Szareth stuffs a list of household chores into your hand.> This is what I need done by day's end.
