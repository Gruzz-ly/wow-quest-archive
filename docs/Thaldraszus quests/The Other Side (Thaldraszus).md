==Notes==
[[File:The Other Side - Hall of Records.jpg|thumb|Naleidea and Toddy in the [[Hall of Records]]]]

Run up the stairs behind Toddy to where the big arrow is pointing to make an Extra Action Button appear:
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|That's the spot! Now hold up the staff!}}
:{{Abilities|The Third Watcher|Raise the reassembled staff of the third watcher to open the sealed door.|id=376616|icon=inv_staff_2h_titan_c_01|cd=12 sec|notes=Channeled}}

Once the channel finishes, Toddy and Naleidea run in. Follow them:
:{{text|say|Security Console|WELCOME, TYR... HAS BEEN ... SINCE THE LAST VISIT. RESUMING ACTIVE PROTOCOLS... STAND BY... STAND BY...}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|These teleporters are still operational? Incredible.}}
:{{text|say|Security Console|STATUS... HALL OF SAMPLES... COMPROMISED... ASPECTS DATABASE: DATA EXPIRED... PRIME RECORDS... INTACT.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|What does that mean? Wait--see those titan consoles? Can you imagine the secrets they hold? There must be a way through this barrier!}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Agreed.}}

Inside, Naleidea has gossip:
:Sometimes I wonder what exactly happens when one steps on one of those teleporters. Frankly, it gives me the chills.

So does Toddy:
:I cannae wait to find out what's in here!
