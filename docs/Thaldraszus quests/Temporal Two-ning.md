==Objectives==
Use Chrono Crystal on [[Eternus]] and [[Chromie]] in [[Azmerloth]] to stop them from falling through time.
*Temporal Position Fixed (0/100%) {{co|61.6|62.1|Azmerloth}}
*Return to [[Nozdormu]] in the Present.
*[[Chrono Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
I see... They are falling through possibilities as well as [[time]].

Hurry, I have located another point in the timeline where we might catch them. It is... unusual, but do not let the strangeness of this world slow you down. Chronormu's fate is in your hands.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I fear how far they could fall...

==Completion==
The process was not finished but I can more accurately track Chronormu now.

==Notes==
Take the portal, then find [[Chromie]] and [[Eternus]] northeast of the spawning location:
:{{text|say|Eternus|Your pet mortal found us again. Perhaps this time they will be successful.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|Oh come on! Being lost in time is no reason to be such a grump, Eternus.}}

Use the [[Chrono Crystal]]:
:{{text|say|Eternus|Hurry, mortal! We are being pulled away again!}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|Good try! Please keep looking for us!}}

==Progression==
