==Objectives==
Locate [[Harleen Chirpsnide]] in the [[Bluefeather Cliffs]].

==Description==
I need a favor, and you look like the favor-doing type.

An ol' pal of mine, Harleen Chirpsnide, was supposed to meet me in [[Valdrakken|the city]] a few days ago. We was planning to eat our way through The [[Ruby Feast]], get a trim at the [[barbershop]], then visit that swanky [[auction house]] they got here.

But she ain't shown up. She gets lost in her work plenty, but I'd feel a lot more comfortable knowing where she was.

Try the mountains south of here. She mentioned she'd be swinging by on her way in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]
* +6 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Completion==
Ol' Fizzlecrank is worried, eh? Guess the drinks are on me when I finish up here.

==Progression==
{{The Screetchflight Scramble}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
