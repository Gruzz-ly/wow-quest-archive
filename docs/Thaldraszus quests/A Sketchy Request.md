==Objectives==
Retrieve Alvi's "Ledger" and return it to [[Waywatcher Alvi]].
*[[Crude Tarasek Key]]
*[[Alvi's "Ledger"]]

==Description==
The [[tarasek]] took everything they could get their claws on, including my scouting ledger.

These overgrown lizards hoard trinkets and trophies by the dozens. I am sure that they stashed my ledger away somewhere. Could you keep an eye out for it as you work your way through the pass?

Oh, and <name>? If you do manage to find it, please do not look inside. The contents are sort of... personal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*8,200 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything else, <name>?

==Completion==
Ah... You really did find it.

In truth, it's more of a sketchbook than a ledger. For as long as I can remember, I've been more interested in doodling than scouting...

<Alvi looses a long, low sigh.>

Maybe if I had actually done my job properly, then Nori wouldn't have gotten hurt.

I have to fix this... but I don't know if I can do it alone.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:''Alvi enters the canyon of the [[Passage of Time]].''
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|While you search around these pools, I am going to scout further into the pass. Between the two of us, we should be able to find my ledger.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Meet me by the cave to the east when you are done.}}

Kill [[Embertooth Scavenger]]s or [[Embertooth Pooltender]]s to loot the key. Then open the [[Tarasek Lockbox]] to loot the ledger.

;Approaching Alvi and Nori
:''[[Waywatcher Nori]] is seen kneeling, wounded.''
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Nori! What happened?!}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Urgh... Damned Tarasek. Poisoned spears. Glad you're alright, at least.}}
:{{Text|emote|Waywatcher Nori coughs and sputters. Her breathing is shallow and uncertain.}}
