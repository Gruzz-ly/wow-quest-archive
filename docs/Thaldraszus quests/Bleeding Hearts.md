==Objectives==
Deliver the Medical Supplies.
*Isolated Cave found
*Potions delivered to Isolated Cave
*Gelikyr Infirmary found
*Potions delivered to Gelikyr Infirmary

==Description==
The potions are ready--now to deliver them.

Take one crate to a small cave in the ravine below us. No one will be there to accept it, but you can trust it will be used well.

Take another crate to the infirmary in [[Gelikyr Post]]. An old friend tends to the patients there.

I... realize this is not your duty. Nor is it really mine. But you've been surprisingly helpful, and this medicine could save lives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Excuse me, I don't have time to chat.

==Completion==
[[Szareth]] wants to heal everyone, no matter the consequences. Rebels, [[Scalesworn]], wildlife: each deserves equal care.

And while I might find Szareth's idealism galling, Gelikyr depends on their expertise.

So my thanks to Szareth--and you as well. These potions will be invaluable.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Szareth|Remember: leave one crate in the cave, the other at the Gelikyr Infirmary.}}
:{{Text|say|Szareth|And... please offer [[Timetender Athekk|Athekk]] my greetings. For what they're worth to him.}}

Dive below to [[Gelikyr Overlook]] and find the cave at {{Co|52.97|67.57|Thaldraszus}}. Place the Medical Supplies inside.
:{{Text|emote|Something rustles outside.}}

[[Abandoned Scroll]] can be found there as well.

Fly back to the Post and enter the building at {{Co|51.77|69.06|Thaldraszus}}. Place the crate just on the right side after entering the room, between the pillars at {{Co|51.69|69.17|Thaldraszus}}.
:{{Text|say|Timetender Athekk|Is... Is this from Szareth?}}
:{{Text|say|Timetender Athekk|I told them not to bother! I refuse to accept the help of a rebel sympathizer! I...}}
:{{Text|emote|Athekk sighs.}}
:{{Text|say|Timetender Athekk|I appreciate the aid.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Timetender Athekk|Medicine is an essential part of a Timetender's arsenal. After all, I can only reverse time so much!}}
:{{Text|emote|Athekk gingerly administers the potion to one of his patients.}}
:{{Text|say|Timetender Athekk|A few doses more, and they'll be back on their feet.}}
:{{Text|say|Timetender Athekk|Thank you again, champion. If you can spare the time, visit Szareth for me. As prickly as they are, I know they enjoy the company.}}

Completing this quest also awards the "Bleeding Hearts" criterion of [[Sojourner of Thaldraszus]].
