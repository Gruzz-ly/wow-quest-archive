==Objectives==
Meet up with [[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]] near [[Zelthrak Outpost]] in the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
From what you mentioned, it appears the stone of Vigilance can be found at an abandoned station northeast of the [[Azure Archives]]. That must be Zelthrak Outpost.

Meet up with me when you arrive, <name>, and we can find the stone together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I know this place is abandoned, but I didn't think it would be so... messy.
