==Objectives==
Return the Icy Rocks to [[Lordaeron]].
*Take the [[Time-Portal to Lordaeron|portal]] from [[Everywhen Inn]] to Lordaeron
*[[Icy Rocks]] placed
*Take the [[Time-Portal to Eon's Fringe|portal]] from Lordaeron to Everywhen Inn (Optional)
*Return to [[Chromie]] in Everywhen Inn
*Return to Chromie in [[Eon's Fringe]].

==Description==
We had some well-meaning [[Dragon whelp|whelps]] take a few teeny objects from history. Small things can sometimes have a big impact. While the whelps are doing double chores, I need someone to return these rocks to their proper place.

I know, right? Rocks? But they have to go back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*[[Soridormi's Recognition]] (30)
*70 [[Paracausal Flakes]]

==Progress==
Did you get those rocks back where they belong?

==Completion==
Thank you for doing that, <name>. Keeping the Timeways on track isn't always the most fun or glamorous job, and sometimes you have to do things you'd rather not. But the true timeline must go on!
