==Objectives==
Investigate the false [[future Chromie]].
*Inspect the [[Temporal Hourglass|Hourglass]]
*Confront [[Morchie]] {{co|61.7|81.2|Thaldraszus}}
*[[Infinite Dragon|Morchie Thwarted]] {{co|62.3|81.8|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
We need to get to the bottom of this "future Chromie" business. Just where is that dragon? She needs to explain herself!

Let's start by inspecting one of her temporal hourglasses. Maybe that will give us a clue.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*11,900 [[XP]]
*15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Oh, that Morchie! I've never met such a tricky, nasty Chromie in all my life.

==Completion==
Well, at least we stopped Morchie's accomplice. Those infinite dragons are always causing all sorts of trouble.

But we can't rest until Morchie herself is captured and sent packing back to [[Alternate timeline|her OWN crummy timeline]]!

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Temporal Hourglass]] next to Chromie and a real-time cinematic plays:
{{#ev:youtube|uvvtnmVZSG8}}
:''Morchie rides in on an [[Infinite Dragon]], taunts Chromie.''
:{{Text|say|Morchie|Ha! Figured it out, did you? A little too late!}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|You're working with the infinites? What a terrible Chromie!}}
:{{Text|say|Morchie|It's Morchie, you brat. And yes! The time has come to bring about [[Murozond]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Morchie|Want to stop me? Catch me if you can.}}
:''Morchie flies into the nearby building.''
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Morchie headed down into that chamber! We need to follow.}}

Enter the chamber at {{co|61.7|81.2|Thaldraszus}} to spot [[Crowmie]], [[Ol' Chrome]], [[Chronormoo]], and [[CHROME-E]] in Morchiestasis. [[Morchie]] is riding on the Infinite Dragon's head.
:{{Text|say|Morchie|Caught up, did you? About time!}}

And kill the dragon:
:''Morchie appears on the floor, with the Temporal Trickster buff.''
:{{Text|say|Morchie|Ugh! I don't have time for this.}}
:''Morchie casts Chronoport, and the alternate Chromies disappear.''
:{{Text|say|Chromie|We have to follow her! If she's working with the infinites, she can't be up to any good.}}
