'''Finally, An Archivist!''' unlocks two of the six sets [[Azerothian Archives]] world quests, which award standing with the faction and ~500x [[Mysterious Fragment]]. The remaining four sets unlock after completing the four-way quest fork.

==Objectives==

* Purchase [[Archivist's Buckled Cap]]
* [[Azerothian Archivist Initiation Token]] (provided)

==Description==
So you've got your bearings now? You've felt the dirt? You've smelled the history?

Why not celebrate this glorious moment of above average success with... a cap!

That's right! Take this token to our beloved provisioner, Aristta. She'll be happy to provide you with one of our all-purpose caps to signify your elevation to Archivist from naive passerby.

==Rewards==
You will unlock acces to the following:
*{{abilities|Azerothian Archives: Riverbed, Concord Observatory, and Lost Anethenum Sites|Unlock the Azerothian Archives' World Quests at the Riverbed, Concord Observatory, and Lost Atheneum.|icon=trade_archaeology|id=431591}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The cap suits you quite well!

==Completion==
Regardless of any assessment of your current aptitude, at least one could say that you look the part!

Now then, your talents have been requested again by my colleagues. Better not tarry!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|I remember when I got my first cap as an Archivist...}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|I also remember when it was eaten shortly after by a [[Vile Fin]] [[murloc]]...}}

Speak with [[Provisioner Aristta]], who has new gossip:
{{book|content=
You were running around outside with Roska and Zenata earlier, weren't you? Those two are quite non-standard, but oh so clever, aren't they?

Eadweard gave you a token, didn't he? Very good. Then let us set you up with one of our coalition's caps.

{{buy|Show me your wares.}}
}}

Purchase the [[Archivist's Buckled Cap]], then turn in. On complete:
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Roska and Zenata have uncovered new sites to investigate. Speak to them for the preamble and details.}}
