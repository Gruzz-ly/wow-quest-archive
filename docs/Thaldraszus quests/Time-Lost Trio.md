==Objectives==
Defeat [[Valeera Sanguinar|Valeera]], [[Broll Bearmantle|Broll]], and [[Varian Wrynn|Lo'Gosh]].
*[[Time]]-Lost [[gladiator]] trio defeated
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
We have a teensy problem I could use your help with. But it's... complicated.

Some time ago, King Varian Wrynn was in a gladiator trio with Broll Bearmantle and Valeera Sanguinar. Those three just showed up in this '[[Field of Ferocity]]' place and they're not only taking on all challengers, they're beating them too! They won't return through our portals until they lose.

Do you think you could find some friends and defeat them? We'll be able to convince them to go back if you can, I'm sure of it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 11,350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You need to speak with [[Gurgthock]] to start the round, then defeat the time-lost gladiators.

==Completion==
Huh. I didn't know we had a group like that on the schedule. Or sparkly gold pyrotechnics.

But, I guess you won, so here.

==Notes==
;Speaking with [[Gurgthock]]
:{{Gossip|I'm ready to begin the fight with the gladiator trio.}}
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|For this round, our fearless competitors are going to face a trio of gladiators from across [[Azeroth]]!}}
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|Give a ferocious welcome to Broll Bearmantle, Valeera Sanguinar, and... Lo'Gosh?}}
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|How'd a [[human]] end up with a name like that? Where do we keep getting these guys anyway?}}
:{{Text|yell|Gurgthock|Eh, whatever. Should be a bloodbath. Get ready, fight!}}
