==Objectives==
Go to [[Steelcliff Rampart]].

==Description==
We've been sending [[Flightless|the rebel]] [[prisoner]]s to Steelcliff Rampart. It's the barracks where [[Valdrakken]]'s city guard, the [[Scalesworn]], are based.

So there are plenty of guards to keep them from causing harm or escaping.

Head over there and we'll see what the next steps are in putting a permanent stop to this rebellion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 5,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for coming, <name>. I am here to discuss with these prisoners why they wanted to rebel against the [[dragon]]s. Please join me and we'll see what they have to say.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Maldra Flametongue]]|The aqueduct is secured, <name>, thanks to you. And our prisoners are being taken to Steelcliff Rampart.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Investigator Erima]]|They won't get away with anything in the Scalesworn's base! Valdrakken's finest may even allow them some freedom.}}

;Entering the rampart
:{{Text|say|[[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]]|The prisoners will not talk to me - they see me as an enemy. Perhaps you'll have better luck, <name>?}}

About are [[Steelcliff Dissident]]s. Alexstrasza is accompanied by [[Captain Drine]].
