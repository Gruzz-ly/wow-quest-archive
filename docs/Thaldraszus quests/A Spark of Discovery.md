==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Titan Spark (Thaldraszus)|Titan Spark]] in [[Tyrhold]].
*Investigate the Spark {{co|58.1|58.6|Thaldraszus}}
*Follow the Spark {{co|62.2|59.2|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
Though this spark is of peculiar origin, I sense it is familiar. I am not sure of its purpose, but I believe it may lead to your next step in unraveling this mystery.

Follow it and see if you can learn more of its purpose, while I see what else I can discover in the meantime.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I sensed a great surge of magic emanating from Tyrhold all the way from Valdrakken. Its source must be this spark you have found.

I wonder what it could mean...

==Notes==
Interact with the Titan Spark:
:<The spark hums, perhaps in response to your presence.>

:{{gossip|<Investigate the spark.>}}
:''The spark starts moving.''

Follow it. It will path through any and all enemies in the area without heeding them, though it will stop if the player does. Players do have the Titanic Overload ability from before, so use it to clear out any elites.

The spark will eventually make it to the back of Tyrhold as the three [[Dragon Aspects]] fly in:
:{{text|yell|Kalecgos|There! Below!}}
:''Kalecgos, Alexstrasza, and Nozdormu all fly in, land, then shift to their visage forms.''

Interacting with the Spark at this point results in the following gossip:
:<The spark appears to be in a ready state for something, as if awaiting input.>
