==Objectives==
Go beyond the [[arcane]] barrier to recover [[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]]'s essences.
*Speak with [[Azuregos]]
*[[Malygos's Lingering Essence]]
*[[Sindragosa's Lingering Essence]]

==Description==
The barrier is weakening, thanks to your aid. In a moment it will be broken down.

Our main priority is recovering Malygos and Sindragosa's essences. Something has gone very wrong with laying them to rest. There are a few theories I have regarding their current state. We can speak about it as we enter.

Let me know when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
It seems the [[blue dragon]]s still cannot leave behind our legacy.

==Completion==
To think a merciful gesture could turn like this...

I suppose we all underestimated the rage still within Sindragosa and Malygos.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Azuregos
:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready to go beyond the arcane barrier.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Sindragosa and Malygos should be at rest. Yet their anger is growing larger by the moment.}}
:''All blue dragons enter the chamber and approach the essences near the [[Old Gravestone]].''
:{{Text|say|[[Zeros]]|Maybe they want things settled? Didn't they both die very violently?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lanigosa]]|Like the [[Ghost|spirits]] of [[Crystalsong Forest]]... Sindragosa and Malygos are stranded in their final moments of death.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Haleh]]|And now they are reliving those final moments of their lives in an endless loop.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Surigosa]]|Perhaps all of this chaos was their only way of getting our attention? Wildly lashing out, hoping someone would hear them.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Well we certainly hear them, and we are going to help. <Name>, recover their essences. We are taking them back to the [[Azure Archives]].}}
