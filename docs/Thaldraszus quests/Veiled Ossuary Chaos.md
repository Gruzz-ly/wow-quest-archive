==Objectives==
Weaken the [[arcane]] invader's control over the [[Veiled Ossuary]].
*Arcane invaders weakened (0/100%)

==Description==
[[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]]'s essences have created this massive arcane disruption. Their memories are running around the Veiled Ossuary trying to drain the arcana out of the graves!

Our combined efforts are merely keeping the energies at bay. We need the memories in the nearby area disrupted.

Once they are dispelled, we should be able to remove this barrier to reach the essences inside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Hurry! We need to deplete the arcana in this area.

==Completion==
The barrier is getting weaker! Fine work.

==Notes==
To fill up the bar, kill the following enemies:
*[[Memory of a Torturer]] (10%)
*[[Memory of a Fiend]]
*[[Memory of a Caster]]
*[[Memory of an Attacker]]
*[[Memory of a Defender]]
*[[Memory of a Loyalist]]
*[[Memory of a Torturer]]

and interact with [[Bound Spirit (Thaldraszus)|Bound Spirits]] (8%) to destroy their bonds.
