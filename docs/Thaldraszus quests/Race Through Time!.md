==Objectives==
Race through time, following [[Chromie]] and [[Eternus]]'s Path.
*Race Through Time

==Description==
<Name>, we must act quickly to catch up to [[Chronormu|Ambassador Chronormu]], and I mean that quite literally.

[[Siaszerathel|Zera]] and I will do what we can to speed our progress, but it is imperative we avoid entangling with this time period as much as possible. To do so will slow us down and we may not be able to catch the Ambassador before she is lost to even [[Nozdormu]]'s magic.

We haven't a moment to lose!

{{text|rare|(Accepting this quest will begin a timer)}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 12,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
By the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]]... This is the [[Black Empire]]!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Zera and I will do what we can to speed our path through.}}

As the quest text warns, this brings back an old classic, a timed quest. Players have 3 minutes 10 seconds to get to the end.

Don't mount up, as there are speed boots along the way. Each boot provides a stacking runspeed buff:
:{{Abilities|Temporal Acceleration|Increases the movement speed of the caster by 50% for 5 sec.|id=363379|icon=petbattle_speed|notes=5 sec duration. Stacks 10 times}}

Steer clear of the swirlies and any combatants. Race along the path to Stormwind, but just before reaching it, the time portal sends players 1,000 years back in time to the [[War of the Shifting Sands]]!
:{{text|bossemote|Temporal distortion stuns you!}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Where are we?}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|The War of the Shifting Sands.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Take care to avoid the combatants.}}

The stun will reset the buff stack. Keep clear of the Savage Wasps fighting Kaldorei Defenders and follow the path south of [[Cenarion Hold]] to the [[Gates of Ahn'Qiraj (subzone)|Gates of Ahn'Qiraj]]. The next time warp sends players back to the [[Pandaren Revolution]]:
:{{text|bossemote|Temporal distortion stuns you!}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|The Pandaren Revolution!}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|I read about this! Those Mogu were vicious!}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Go Pandaren! Kick their a--}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Zera--}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|a-authoritarian regime to the curb!}}

Players land in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]]. Keep following the road west toward the [[Gate of the Setting Sun]] to make it to the final time portal, to the [[Black Empire]]! An in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|90G7Z1jNeQE}}<!-- Should be replaced, as this version of the cutscene had a positioning bug. -->
:''The adventurer, Dante, and Zera fall out of the portal.''
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Ummm... Where are we?}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Is this even [[Azeroth]]?}}
:''The camera tracks forward and upward to show a tentacle of an Old God in the distance and [[Ragnaros]] fighting [[Mythrax]].''
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|It is Azeroth.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Though, an exceptionally long time ago.}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|We should find Chromie and get out of here.}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|This place is scary.}}
:''An ominous voice laughs.''

Players pop out in [[Ny'alotha, the Waking City]] in the central lava area. Also present are [[Al'Akir]], [[Therazane]], and untold [[Aqir]], air, fire, and water elementals.

While in the zone, Old Gods will constantly whisper the player, including:
*{{text|whisper|[[Y'shaarj|Piercing Presence]]|All of your friends are dead.}}
*{{text|whisper|[[Yogg-Saron|Maddening Presence]]|All that you know will fade.}}
*{{text|whisper|Maddening Presence|Hope is an illusion.}}
*{{text|whisper|Piercing Presence|No one is coming to save you.}}
*{{text|whisper|Maddening Presence|Trust is your weakness.}}
*{{text|whisper|Piercing Presence|You cannot succeed. Your cause is hopeless.}}
*{{text|whisper|Piercing Presence|You have already lost.}}
*{{text|whisper|Maddening Presence|You will be alone in the end.}}
*{{text|whisper|[[C'Thun|Observing Presence]]|You will betray your friends.}}
*{{text|whisper|Observing Presence|You will die.}}
*{{text|whisper|Piercing Presence|Your allies will leave you behind.}}
*{{text|whisper|Observing Presence|Your courage will fail.}}
*{{text|whisper|Observing Presence|Your friends will abandon you.}}

Should players fail or abandon the quest, they will get warped back to the start of the footrace at the Gnoll War. Andantenormu offers a skip on failure:
:We were close that time. I might be able to reach Ambassador Chronormu with my magic.

:{{gossip|Try reach Chromie with your magic. {{text|hostile|<Skip ahead in the campaign chapter to where Chromie is.>}}}}
