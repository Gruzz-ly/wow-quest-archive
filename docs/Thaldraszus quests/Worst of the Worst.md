==Objectives==
Kill 3 rebels and 4 elementals in [[Emberslate Cavern]].
*Slay [[Flightless|Rebels]] (3)
*Slay [[Elemental]]s (4)

==Description==
The rebels in the Emberslate Cavern have an unflinching loyalty to the [[Primalists]], and are therefore the greatest threat to [[Valdrakken]].

Eliminate them, and any elementals they have unleashed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Take care not to let the rebels overwhelm you.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.

Those who follow the Primalists cannot be allowed to spread chaos and destruction.
