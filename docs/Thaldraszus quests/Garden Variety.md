'''Garden Variety''' is an optional breadcrumb to the [[Gardens of Unity]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Gryrmpech|Gyrympech]].{{sic}}

==Description==
Are you enjoying the butterfly garden?

You know, there's a much larger garden just to the south of here. An older [[drakonid]] by the name of Gryrmpech tends to it.

He could always use an extra pair of hands. He has an '[[Lord Basilton|assistant]]', but I've never actually seen him. I can't imagine he's of much help.

If you stop by, be sure to let him know that [[Tender Xina|Xina]] sent you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]
* +4 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Oh praise the [[Titan]]s, help at last!

==Progression==
{{Gardens of Unity}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
