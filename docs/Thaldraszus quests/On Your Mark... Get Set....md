*Time portal to [[Gnoll War]] taken {{co|59.9|82.2|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
<[[Nozdormu]]'s gaze is unfocused.>

The further they fall, the faster they travel. They punch holes through the fabric of [[time]] which send out great ripples. You will need to be swift to catch them.

<[[Nozdormu]]'s focus sharpens and shifts to you.>

I will send my [[timewalkers]] to help you navigate the [[timeway]]s and speed your efforts. Avoid entangling with the temporal locals and do not stop until you have found [[Chronormu]]!

Go. We have precious little time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Are you ready, <name>?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Time is of the essence, <name>.}}

A Portal to The [[Gnoll War]] appears. Take it to go back in time to [[Elwynn Forest]] 75 years before the [[Dark Portal]] opened. In [[Goldshire]], [[Gnoll Invader]]s are attacking [[Stormwind Footsoldier]]s!
