'''Waygate: Eon's Fringe''' is one of several quests that can be chosen when you unlock an additional [[Ancient Waygate]] beyond the first two. Waygate unlocks happen at Renown levels 8, 10, 15, 17, 20, and 23 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].

==Objectives==
Locate the [[Dormant Waygate]] at [[Eon's Fringe]] in [[Thaldraszus]].
*Waygate activated
*[[Enchanted Arcana Vessel]] (provided)

==Description==
Far across the land in the mountainous regions of Thaldraszus sits a little inn nestled on the mountainside. Just inside the entryway sits a long-forgotten, dormant stone.

What say ye? Up fer another adventure, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Ancient Waygate: Eon's Fringe|Unlocks access to the Eon's Fringe waygate.|id=390522|icon=ability_socererking_arcanewrath}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ye know I'd love tae sit around and talk, but there's work tae do.

==Completion==
Yer adventurous nature never ceases tae amaze!

I wonder how many more o' these things are out there.

==Notes==
Interacting with the Dormant Waygate will cause you to channel {{abilities|Effuse Arcana|id=390525|icon=ability_socererking_arcanereplication}} on it for 8 seconds. After the cast finishes:
