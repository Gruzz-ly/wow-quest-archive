==Objectives==
Locate [[Harleen Chirpsnide]] in the [[Bluefeather Cliffs]].

==Description==
Did you see that?!

This [[Harpy|winged creature]] just fell from the sky! I don't know what sort of being it is, but it certainly isn't native to [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].

Wait... I do remember a punchy little [[goblin]] asking for directions to the Bluefeather Cliffs just above us. You think she would know anything about it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Some guard in [[Gelikyr Post|Gelikyr]] told you I'd be here? Did they say I own 'em any money?

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
