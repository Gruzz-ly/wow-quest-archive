==Description==

==Progress==
As painful as it can be, heartbreak can be essential for making us who we are. Even if who are isn't always... nice.

==Completion==
If only we could've let Illidan have his happily ever after with Tyrande, at least for a little while longer. I always thought those two were really cute together!

But we all have our role to play to make sure events flow smoothly.

==Notes==
Take the portal and speak with Malfurion.
:This was not what was supposed to happen...

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Ask Malfurion what's wrong.>}}
::I do not understand it! How did Illidan get his hands on the poem I was writing for Tyrande? And he managed to complete it too.

::Just look at them... How can I win her over now?
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|If only I could give Tyrande something to prove my love for her...}}

Looting [[Pale Duskblossom]]s may summon [[Carnivorous Lasher (Val'sharah)|Carnivorous Lashers]]. Once enough are collected, give them to Malfurion.

:{{Text|say|Illidan Stormrage|Lies!}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Did you write the poem, Illidan?}}
:{{Text|say|Illidan Stormrage|I... No, but I meant every word.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The flowers are lovely, Malfurion. Would you accompany me for a walk?}}
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|It would be my pleasure.}}
:''Malfurion and Tyrande leave.''
