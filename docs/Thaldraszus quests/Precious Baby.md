==Objectives==
Find [[Elzara]]'s [[Baby (corgi)|Baby]].
*Find the baby
*Comfort Baby

==Description==
You there, <race>! Are you semi-competent?

Do you have your priorities in check?

Good!

My precious Baby is missing. Save her immediately. Be quick about it, she can't fend for herself in these horrible conditions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
What are you waiting for? My Baby is out there alone!

==Completion==
<Elzara ignores you and looks at Baby.>

Are you safe, my precious cuddlemuffin?

Did the [[Primalists]] bleed on you? How dare they!

<Elzara notices you.>

I shall definitely be rating [[Serene Dreams Spa|this spa]] at one star. I expect a blood-free experience.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Elzara|My delicate baby must be so frightened!}}

Find and approach Baby at {{Co|38.91|45.21|Thaldraszus}}. A group of [[Invading Primalist]]s appears and surround the dog and the character.

:{{Text|say|Invading Primalist|There you are! Your bloody assault ends now.}}
:{{Text|say|Invading Primalist|Are you talking to the dog?}}
:{{Text|say|Invading Primalist|Yes! [[Vadne Bleakheart|Vadne]] said to kill it!}}
:{{Text|say|Invading Primalist|That makes no sense. She must mean the <class>, obviously.}}
:{{Text|say|Invading Primalist|Kill them both, starting with the mutt.}}
:''The Primalists start attacking, but Baby suddenly and quickly jumps and obliterates them.''
:{{Text|say|Invading Primalist|What?!}}
:{{Text|say|Invading Primalist|AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!}}
:''Baby is Covered in Gore.''

Pet it, after which Baby circles around the character for a bit. The nearby [[Horrible Mess]] now offers [[Look at the Bones!]]
