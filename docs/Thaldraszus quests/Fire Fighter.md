{{questportrait|Magmatalon.jpg|Magmatalon|Leader of the [[Primalists]] attacking [[South Hold Gate]].}}
Kill Magmatalon.
*[[Magmatalon]] slain {{co|40.2|86.8|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
[[Commander Eranog]] has betrayed us and left this beast in charge.

You have done so much for me already, but I can not handle that monster in my current state.

Please, do this one last thing for me and help ensure that South Hold Gate does not fall to these Primalists.

We must kill their leader!

Help me, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Magmatalon Wraps
|Magmatalon Wristguards
|Magmatalon Wrist Scales
|Magmatalon Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 12,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
With their leader dead these Primalists should be easy for reinforcements from [[Valdrakken]] to clear out.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|That traitor! Go defeat the Primalist leader here. I will be your rear guard.}}

Head south through the gate and Magmatalon will land:
:{{text|say|Magmatalon|I will burn you to cinders!}}

At 50%:
:{{text|say|Magmatalon|Your death will be agony!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Magmatalon|Back... to the... elements...}}
