==Description==
Welcome to the [[Veiled Ossuary]]. Originally built to house and memorialize the dead. Now the likely location of the stone we've come to call the Judgment of Tyr.

We haven't received reports of any overt [[Sundered Flame]] presence here, but the expedition has learned that they prefer to strike unawares.

Be on your guard, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
All I ever wanted was to study. Instead, I'm sifting through rubble and getting chased by draconic ghosts.

==Completion==
Tyr held this at one point. Incredible.

==Notes==
Speak with Naleidea:
:This place is... unsettling.
:{{gossip|Let's get started then.}}
:''She casts a spell on [[Oliver]] to draw attention, and on herself to drop into stealth, then they both move forward.''
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Stay close, <name>. I don't believe that the Sundered Flame have left this site unwatched.}}

As they stop, an ambush from [[Sundered Lookout]]s predictably happens:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|In ruins like these, I shudder to think what I might attract with this spell. Be on your guard.}}

Fend them off, then follow Naleidea to another ambush from [[Sundered Vanguard]]s:
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|There--follow my familiar!}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Be wary, the Sundered are watching us.}}

Up the stairs to a third ambush from a pair of Sundered Lookouts and a Sundered Shadetalon:
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|I wonder if the Sundered have any qualms about disturbing their ancestors?}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Hrm... a little too quiet.}}

Into the tower:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|The stone must be somewhere around here. Check the nearby rubble.}}

Start interacting with the rubbles - [[Destroyed Half Arch]]es, [[Destroyed Brazier]], and [[Destroyed Dragon Table]]. Unsuccessful find:
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Hmm, nothing there. Keep looking.}}
:''Skittering Boneborers attack.''

[[The Judgment of Tyr (item)]] is under the table. Item found:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Ah ha!}}

;The Judgment of Tyr taken
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|The stone is ours! Now let's leave this place before the Sundered Flame send any more... scouts.}}

;On complete
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Finally. The sooner we get out of here the better. I'll see you at the next site.}}
:''Naleidea and Oliver teleport away.''

Complete the other two forks of the chain to continue.

==Progression==
