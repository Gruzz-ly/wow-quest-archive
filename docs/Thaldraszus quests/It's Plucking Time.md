==Objectives==
Pluck 6 Hatchling Feathers.
*[[Hatchling Feather]] (6)
*[[Feather-Plucker 3300]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Harleen Chirpsnide|Harleen]] told me she's making a disguise for you! How exciting! But she'll need some feathers from the [[roc]] hatchlings to complete the outfit.

Luckily, I've just finished fixing up the Feather-Plucker 3300!

The [[Screechflight]] are capturing roc hatchlings on the lower cliffs to raise and breed for themselves. Use the Plucker to yank the hatchlings out of danger. It'll automatically pluck some of their feathers for you as well!

Two birds with one Plucker? I should say so!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Professor Chirpsnide tells me that I've got a knack for gadgets! If I wasn't part of the [[Dracthyr]] military, do you think I could've worked in a [[Goblin]] city?

==Completion==
This is more than enough feathers! And all collected without the Feather-Plucker exploding... right?

==Notes==
Head to the eastern part of the cliffs and use the plucker on [[Snatched Hatchling]]s flying above with [[Screechflight Snatcher]]s.

Once collected, proceed further east to turn in the quest.
