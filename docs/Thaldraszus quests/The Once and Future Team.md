==Objectives==
Use your Timewalker Staff to pop the [[Temporal Conflux|temple]] door's stasis bubble.
*Use Timewalker Staff on the Temple Door Bubble {{co|60.6|83.4|Thaldraszus}}
*[[Colossal Causality|Giant Time Elemental]] {{co|60.7|83.7|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
All right! Let's pop that stasis bubble around the temple doors and release our Wardens! Are you ready for a huge tug-of-war match with [[time]] itself?

Yank at the door's bubble like you did with the crystals earlier. But be careful, all the time energy released is sure to collect and attack you. I'm not sure what will be there, but at least you'll have the freed Wardens on your side no matter what happens.

Good luck, <name>!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chronomental Halfgloves
|Chronomental Grips
|Chronomental Gloves
|Chronomental Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 12,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
We really should've foreseen this when we built our security system all that time ago...

==Completion==
That's the second largest [[time elemental]] I've ever seen! I knew I should have packed my [[S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera|S.E.L.F.I.E Camera]] today. 

Oh well! I'll just stop by this moment again on my next day off.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chromie|We'll hold [[Eternus]] in place while you free the Wardens, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|[[Andantenormu]]|You have our strength, Ambassador Chronormu!}}
:{{text|say|[[Siaszerathel]]|I may not be a full [[Timewalkers|Timewalker]] yet, but I am strong enough to help!}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Together, our power should be enough!}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Your efforts are wasted. I have seen all possible futures. We shall be victorious!}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|No! I believe in us! And we won't let you destroy the [[timeway]]s!}}

Head southeast up the ramp to the temple, where yet another time bubble has locked things down. Use the [[Extra Action Button]]:
:{{Abilities|Termporal Destabilizing Beam|Disrupts Bronze stasis bubbles.|range=10|notes=Channeled|id=373029|icon=inv_staff_1h_drakonid_c_01}}

Use it and a tether appears:
:{{text|bossemote|Pull on the timestream!}}

Start running away... but the tether is still holding:
:{{text|bossemote|Keep pulling!}}

Once the tether finally breaks, a [[Colossal Causality]] spawns:
:{{text|yell|[[Warden Captain Sinjoirmi]]|Wardens! We are finally free! Slay this monstrosity and take back the temple!}}

A handful of Timewalker Wardens help attack the elemental. Defeat it:
:{{text|yell|Warden Captain Sinjoirmi|Wardens! With me!}}
:{{text|say|Warden Captain Sinjoirmi|Apologies for the delay, Ambassador Chronormu. Your Wardens are ready and able to protect this temple again.}}
