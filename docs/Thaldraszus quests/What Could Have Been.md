==Objectives==
Help an alternate version of yourself defeat a mutual foe.
*[[Cloaking Device]] disabled
*Fel-Corrupted Champion slain

==Description==
A mysterious stranger showed up here a bit ago through one of those time portals.

Said there's a threat nearby they need your help with. Some kind of cloaking device. Though you might not like what you see once it's disabled.

In fact, you may not particularly like this stranger, for that matter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*[[Soridormi's Recognition]] (30)
*70 [[Paracausal Flakes]]
*[[Encapsulated Destiny]]

==Progress==
I know it must be hard to see yourself like this. At least you're on the same side for this one.

==Completion==
Oh, good. You both made it back alright. Glad to see you managed to set aside your differences.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Bartender Bob|There you are. Do try to get along, you two.}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|I know you have no reason to trust me, given that I've joined the <[[Alliance]]/[[Horde]].}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|But we must put that aside to face a threat greater than our differences.}}

Fly below to the [[Shifting Sands]], find the Cloaking Device in the sand, and disable it, which summons the Fel-Corrupted Champion, another version of you.
:{{Text|say|Fel-Corrupted Champion|Perish by the power you could have claimed!}}

Kill the champion.
:{{Text|say|Fel-Corrupted Champion|Your cowardice... will be your end...}}
