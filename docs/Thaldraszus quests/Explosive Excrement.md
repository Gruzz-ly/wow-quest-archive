==Objectives==
Fill Professor Chirpsnide's Auto-Excre-Collector.
*Chirpsnide Auto-Excre-Collector filled (0/100%)
*[[The Chirpsnide Auto-Excre-Collector]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Harpy|harpies]] are a nice surprise and all, but I came to these mountains for one reason and one reason only: EXCREMENT!

Specifically, the excrement of [[Bluefeather Roc]]s that's then been eaten and digested by bugs. [[Scarab]] stomach juices enhance the explosive nitrogen content by ten-fold! At least!

Here, take this Chirpsnide Auto-Excre-Collector. Stomp on the scarabs crawling around the cave floor, and use the Collector to reap the rewards.

Bring it back full and we can start the real fun: EXPLOSIONS!!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Is that the smell of great explosions in the air?

Close! It's [[roc]] droppings!

==Completion==
Oh, yes! Quality stuff!!

Have you thought about doing this work professionally, <name>?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|What's that look for, <name>?! It's not gross! It's science! AND it's fun!}}

Enter the cave with two entrances on the opposite side. Walk over the [[Rocdrop Scarab]]s (+2%), then use the collector. [[Rocdrop Pudgepin]]s (+6%) need to be killed properly.

Gathering the excrement also gives the Chirpsnide Auto-Excre-Collect Tank buff that stacks.
