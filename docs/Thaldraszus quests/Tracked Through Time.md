==Description==
A Timewalker spotted a bear cub who stumbled into our present time. She was so frightened she ran off before he could catch her!

Can you find the poor thing? You'll need to calm her down before she'll follow you.

Bring her back here and I'll open a temporal portal to take her home.

==Progress==
That cub must be so scared, all alone and in a strange place. We need to get her back home!

==Completion==
Surprised by who that little bear turns out to be? Just goes to show you that even the smallest creatures can have a big impact!

Head to the [[Shifting Sands]] and find the cub threatened by a [[Time-Lost Raptor]]{{coords|59.30|76.85|Thaldraszus}}. Take it, return to the inn, and take the [[Time-Portal to Feralas]].
:{{Text|say|Chromie|The portal's ready! Let's get that cub back home.}}

On the other side of the portal, the adventurer is in the [[Ruins of Ravenwind]] and there is a dead [[Mother Bear Corpse]]. Interact with it.
