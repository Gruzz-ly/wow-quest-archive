==Description==
Our prototype worked! Excellent!

Now it's time for the main course. This time, YOU are the chef.

With some necessary adjustments, you'll suit up in your disguise again. Then you'll take our masterpiece EGG-splosive, dunk it in this rancid stew here, head up to the Matriarch's cave, plate it for her, and glide back down with the blasts detonating behind you!

If all things go as planned, she'll be toast. Because of the explosion. Which will burn her to toasty bits.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Careful with that chef's hat. It's bound to be a collector's item one day!

==Completion==
Things didn't go exactly to plan, but no good [[Goblin]] scheme ever does! Nice work!

There will still be [[Screechflight]] here, but they'll be easier to cull without their Matriarch organizing their efforts. And the [[Bluefeather Roc|Bluefeathers]] will actually have a chance to survive.

[[Harpy|Harpies]] and [[dragon]]s aren't that different. Forgetting their attempted mass digestion of the cliffside, they're akin to a civilization of their own. Maybe there's a peaceful brood out there?

Oh, and keep the disguise. Looks good on you.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Try on your new disguise. I upgraded it to look like [[Chef Fry-Aerie|our big chef-friend here]].}}

;Disguise used
:{{Text|say|Segallia|The professor's masterpiece EGG-splosive is finally ready! Dunk it in this gross stew to attract the Matriarch.}}
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Segallia, is the Chirpsnide One-Way Taxi prepped for use?}}
:{{Text|say|Segallia|Ready and waiting just outside to take <name> to the Matriarch's Cave at top speeds!}}
:{{Text|say|Segallia|I've also packed you an extra Chirpsnide Auto-Glider in case you need it for the ride down!}}
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Then you're all set for danger, <name>. Hitch a ride to the cave and explode the head off this feathered-snake!}}

Dunk the egg in the Simmering Bluefeather Chunk Stew, then use the rocket outside the cave to fly to the Matriarch's cave above. Head inside and place the egg in the Matriarch's Egg Bowl.

:{{Text|yell|Matriarch Avethyra|I smell my Chef's signature concoction! Excellent! I'm famished!}}
:{{Text|say|Matriarch Avethyra|These [[roc]]s have made me stronger with every meal! I'll be soon ready for our next prey: The dragons!!}}
:{{Text|say|Matriarch Avethyra|We shall all ascend, becoming greater than any [[dragonflight]]! FOR WE ARE THE SCREECHFLIGHT!}}
:{{Text|say|Matriarch Avethyra|Fry-Aerie, you've helped me become the harpy I've always believed I could be. Mother would be so proud of us!}}

:{{Text|yell|Matriarch Avethyra|ARRGGHH! WHAT IS THIS? YOU AREN'T MY CHEF!!}}

Kill the matriarch. On death she says:
:{{Text|say|Matriarch Avethyra|Would [[Aviana]]... have been proud?}}

To [[Dracthyr (playable)|dracthyr]], she instead says:
:{{Text|say|Matriarch Avethyra|Our dreams... We wanted to become... one of you...}}

Outside the cave, The Chirpsnide Auto-Glider extra action button becomes available. Use it to glide down to where Harleen, Segalia, and a [[Full-Winged Peckinator]] are waiting.

:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Welp! Yet another exciting adventure for the hero ornithologist, Harleen Chirpsnide! But I must be off now!}}
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|An assistant? I live more harrowing adventures than this one with my morning Kaja'Coffee! There's no room for the weak-winged in ornithology!}}
:{{Text|say|Segallia|The rest of [[Azeroth]] awoke while we were asleep for thousands of years! If harpies can desire more, then any [[Dracthyr]] can too!}}
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|That... is a great point! I deem you an assistant ornithologist! Now, grab my bags and lets hit the skies!}}
:{{Text|say|Segallia|Yes, Professor! Thank you, Professor!!}}
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Now give me a moment to figure out how to make the Peckinator a two-seater...}}
