==Objectives==
Search for the members of [[Guardian Velomir]]'s unit in the [[South Hold Gate]].
*Velomir's unit found (3)

==Description==
The [[Primalists|Primalist]] attack came suddenly and with no warning. My unit attempted to find our leader, [[Commander Eranog]], but before we could get to the other side of the garrison we were cut off.

In the battle my unit leader, [[Sergeant Tagrik]], held off three Primalists by himself as [[Kaora]], [[Mikor]], and myself battled at his side.

Their screams are the last thing I remember before I fell. 

Please, <race>, if you see any signs of my unit let me know what happened to them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|27|62}}
*10,250 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you found what happened to my unit? I fear the worst, but I have hope that they survived.

==Completion==
This... pains me to hear... but I understand. Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|I will make my way to the bridge at the middle of the garrison. Meet me there when you are done.}}

Look for the marked units on the minimap. A green [[Mangled Corpse]] is just south of the gate at {{co|36.3|83.7|Thaldraszus}}:
:The body of this guardian has fine metalwork upon her horns.

:This dragonkin is covered with burn marks from the spells of the Primalists.
:Based upon Velomir's description, this must be Kaora.

Up the stairs to the south at {{co|36.5|85.4|Thaldraszus}} is a red Mangled Corpse:
:This is the body of a Dragonspawn. Given the heavy armor, it appears this wasn't one of the normal guardians.

:{{gossip|Inspect the body.}}
:You turn the body over and see many deep wounds with burnt edges. They were likely caused by the molten weapons wielded by the Primalists.

:Based upon the heavy armor and Velomir's description you believe this was Sergeant Tagrik.

To the northeast inside the tower at {{co|35.8|84.2|Thaldraszus}} is the corpse of a [[Badly Injured Guardian]]:
:This guardian is covered with ghastly wounds. Just as you arrive, you see him struggle, his words caught in a gurgle. He lets out a heavy sigh and slumps to the ground, dead.

:{{gossip|Inspect the body.}}
:Regrettably, you identify this guardian as Mikor based upon Velomir's description.

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Guardian Velomir|My best people... lost. We must press forward and see if Commander Eranog has survived. Gather any supplies you can find, we will need all the help we can get.}}
