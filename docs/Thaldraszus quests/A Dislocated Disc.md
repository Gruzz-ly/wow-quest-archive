'''A Dislocated Disc''' begins the [[patch 10.1.7]] portion of the Tyr storyline. Players must have completed all previous chapters, up to and including [[A Sliver of Silver]] from [[patch 10.1.0]] in order for Nozdormu to offer this quest atop [[Valdrakken]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Eternus]] in [[Tyrhold]].

==Description==
As a gesture of good will, Eternus has pledged her assistance in finding the disc that contains [[Tyr]]'s memories. [[Infinite dragonflight|The infinites]] have devices that can aid in divining its location.

To quote Eternus, "This is a mess [[Chrono-Lord Deios|Deios]] made. It is fair we help clean it up."

I feel some responsibility as well after our attempt to wake Tyr with the Silver Scale.

Meet Eternus at Tyrhold. She will brief you on her progress. Perhaps now our old friend will finally join us once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
We meet again, <name>. [[Nozdormu]] said you would come. I welcome your aid.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|[[Alexstrasza]] requests my counsel on the business of [[Primal Incarnates|the Incarnates]], but I will join you at Tyrhold shortly.}}
Nozdormu offers a skip for alts who have already done the Reforging the Tyr's Guard questchain. 

{{gossip|I have already helped [[Travard]] reforge the [[Tyr's Guard]]. {{text|red|<Skip the Reforging Tyr's Guard campaign chapter..>}}}}

This allows players to instantly complete the campaign and will forfeit the following: 
* 130 [[Flightstones]]
* [[Tyr's Guard Bulwark]]

Head to the forge in Tyrhold and approach Eternus and [[Chromie]] by the [[Timeway Console]]:
:{{Text|say|Eternus|<Name> is here. Good. Chromie and I are discussing how we will find Tyr's disc--with your help.}}

==Progression==
{{Reforging the Tyr's Guard}}

==Patch changes==
