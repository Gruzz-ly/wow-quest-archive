'''Handling It''' is the main check on the quest line to obtain [[Fyr'alath the Dreamrender]]. After picking up this quest, [[Eadweard's Notes]] light up next to him, and the journal offers three quest forks to come up with the items required for this quest.

==Objectives==
Obtain a Symbiotic Glowspore Grip, a Rune of Shadowbinding, and a Concentrated Sophic Vellum.
* [[Symbiotic Glowspore Grip]]
* [[Rune of Shadowbinding]]
* [[Concentrated Sophic Vellum]]

==Description==
If you want to wield [[Fyr'alath the Dreamrender|Fyr'alath]] safely, you'll need to modify the weapon's haft with three components.

First, you'll need a fireproof hide that can handle intense heat. Next, acquire enchanted vellum that can contain the weapon's volatile magic. Finally, a scribe must apply the proper runes, so you can bind the first two materials to the axe.

My journal over there includes a few recommendations of crafters who can help you. You might also know a few!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please collect the necessary materials quickly. I'm excited to begin.

==Completion==
Excellent! I knew my instructions would prove sufficient!

Oh, and congratulations to you as well. I commend your diligence.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Eadweard Dalyngrigge]]|I can hardly believe my eyes. [[Fyrakk]]'s legendary axe! Fyr'alath, Dream Render!}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|My ingenious plan will unlock its true potential. I can't wait to see it realized!}}
:{{text|say|[[Wrathion]]|Are you insane? Fyrakk nearly burned down the Dreaming{{sic}} with that abominable weapon!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|No one should wield it. Ever! No one can tame it! Anything its [[shadowflame]] cannot corrupt, it destroys.}}
:{{text|say|[[Scalecommander Emberthal]]|Wrathion, if anyone is capable of "taming" this axe, it's <name>, our friend and ally.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Perhaps there's a way to... cleanse... the weapon's corruption.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Oh, I find that proposition quite dubious! This weapon cannot be purified... but I suspect its shadowflame can be... contained. Allow me to reiterate my theory...}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|If we wrapped its haft in enchanted cloth... with an efficacious application of the right rituals... and then secured the assistance of an enchanter, a leatherworker, and a master of inscription...}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I owe you a debt of gratitude, <name>, so I won't stand in your way. But I insist on watching your progress.}}

[[Eadweard's Notes]] light up just to his left while the script event is playing out, and it starts three quests: [[Handling It: Symbiotic Glowspore Grip]], [[Handling It: Concentrated Sophic Vellum]], and [[Handling It: Rune of Shadowbinding]]. Each of those quest chains will end up awarding the necessary items for this quest.

==Progression==
{{Fyr'alath}}
