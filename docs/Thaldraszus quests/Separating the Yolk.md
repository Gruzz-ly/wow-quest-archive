==Objectives==
Collect 20 Bluefeather Eggs.
*[[Bluefeather Egg]] (20)

==Description==
I've deciphered [[Screechflight Scroll|the scroll]] and, surprise, it's bad news!

The [[Screechflight]] aren't just eating the [[Bluefeather Roc|Bluefeathers]] for sustenance. Turns out they've found a spell or two that transfers the [[roc]]s' innate strength to themselves upon consumption. Especially the eggs!

Save as many of those roc eggs as you can down the cliffs from here. It'll stall the [[Harpy|harpies]] long enough to put my plan into motion.

And watch out for rogue [[elemental]]s. The [[Screechflight Cursewife|Cursewives]]' spell work has stirred them up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Saving these eggs from the harpies is key to protecting these Bluefeathers from any further endangerment. As well as any future prey they plan on consuming next.

==Completion==
This is more than I imagined you'd be able to recover!

Maybe you're not a bad sort after all. Not that I was thinking that or anything!

==Notes==
Head to the eastern part of the cliffs and loot the egg items from [[Bluefeather Roc Egg]]s, which are being corrupted by [[Screechflight Cursewife|Screechflight Cursewives]].

Once collected, proceed further east to turn in the quest.
