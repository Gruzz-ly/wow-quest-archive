'''Carry On, Basilton''' concludes the Gardens of Unity chapter of the [[Thaldraszus storyline]].

==Objectives==
Speak with Basilton in [[Gardens of Unity|the Gardens]].
*Speak with [[:Lord Basilton]]

==Description==
There is one more thing this old [[drakonid]] would like to ask you, before you leave.

Back when Lord Basilton and I first met, we would go on all sorts of adventures together. I think that's why he wanders off. He misses exploring.

I can't do that for him anymore. But you can! You can take him to see places I never would have dreamed of, I can tell.

However, we should ask Basilton what he thinks first.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Lord Basilton (companion)]]
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's see what Basilton thinks.

==Completion==
I'm jealous of him, if I'm being honest. To be young again, and exploring [[Azeroth|the world]]. You'll have to visit, sometime, so you can tell me what he's been up to.

==Notes==
Speak with Lord Basilton:
:<Lord Basilton paws idly at the ground.>
:{{gossip|<Basilton looks up at you and gives an excited squeak. He'd love to go along with you on more adventures!>}}
:{{text|say|Gryrmpech|Ha! He seems to like you very much.}}
:{{text|say|Gryrmpech|What do you say, Basilton? Would you like to carry on your adventures with <name>?}}
:{{text|say|Lord Basilton|Squeak!!}}
:{{text|say|Gryrmpech|Excellent! Well, <name>, I think that's your answer. Basilton will join you. Do take care of him, will you?}}

Completing the quest also awards the "Gardens of Unity" criterion of [[Sojourner of Thaldraszus]].
