'''The Catalyst's Boon''' is offered to players in [[patch 10.1]] who have already unlocked the [[Revival Catalyst Console]]. Instead of having to do group content each week in [[Revival Catalyst (quest)]], simply logging in is enough going forward to gain [[Renascent Shadowflame]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Antuka]] in [[Tyrhold]].

==Description==
I have an urgent message for you, adventurer.

The [[Revival Catalyst Console|Revival Catalyst]] seems to be responding to the land's rumblings--perhaps even your feats!

Miraculously, it now shares its power for nothing in return except one's mere presence.

Antuka will know more. Go with haste, <name>. This is wondrous news.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|80}}

==Completion==
Every week, the catalyst will grant you enough power to imbue one piece of equipment.

[[Tyr|Keeper Tyr]] must be watching us. Wherever he is, this is no coincidence.

==Progression==
#[[Reviving the Machine]]
#[[Revival Catalyst (quest)]]
#[[The Catalyst's Boon]]
