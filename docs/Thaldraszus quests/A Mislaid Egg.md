==Objectives==
Find the Red Dragon Egg and place it someplace conspicuous.
*Find the [[Red Dragon Egg]]
*Take the [[Time-Portal to Dun Algaz|portal]] from [[Everywhen Inn]] to [[Dun Algaz]] (Optional)
*Place the Red Dragon Egg
*Take the portal from Dum Algaz to Everywhen Inn (Optional)
*Return to Chromie in Everywhen Inn

==Description==
Oh dear, this is a tricky one. We need you to relocate an egg to somewhere that [[Rhonin]] will be certain to notice it. It may sound odd, but his discovery of that egg sets into motion the events that will free [[Alexstrasza]] from the [[Old Horde]]--and save the egg, too!

We're sending you to Dun Algaz. It's not where any of this should be taking place, but [[time]] is like cheese right now. Tasty and full of holes.

Oh, and here's some sand. It'll help you be a bit more stealthy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*[[Soridormi Commendation]] (30)
*[[Paracausal Flakes]] (70)

==Progress==
Did you find a good spot for the egg?

==Completion==
Did you get it in the right spot? What am I saying--of course you did, or we wouldn't be here!

When Alexstrasza was freed, it secured a victory at the [[Battle of Grim Batol]]. More importantly, she and the [[Dragon Aspects|other Aspects]] forced [[Deathwing]] to beat a hasty retreat. If Rhonin hadn't located her, who knows what Deathwing would've accomplished?

<Chromie lowers her voice, glancing at Alexstrasza.>

She arrived just after you left--like she knew what we were doing!

==Notes==
Behind Chromie is a [[Time-Portal to Dun Algaz]]. Take it to be teleported to Dun Algaz. The Time Shifted Sands extra action button is available. A number of [[Dragonmaw Grunt]]s and three [[Dragonmaw Guard (Wetlands)|Dragonmaw Guards]] with stealth detection are present. Sneak by them and take the egg on top. In case the orcs detect the intruder:
:{{Text|say|Intruder! Here to steal our secrets!}}

Leave the bunker and place the egg under a wagon on the left side, after which a [[Time-Portal to Everywhere Inn]] spawns. Back in the inn, Alexstrasza is present and after completing the quest, she has this gossip:
:<Alexstrasza stares at you for a moment, then offers you the smallest of nods and a gentle smile. Perhaps your involvement in her escape didn't go as undetected as you'd planned. She says nothing--but her gratitude is clear.>
