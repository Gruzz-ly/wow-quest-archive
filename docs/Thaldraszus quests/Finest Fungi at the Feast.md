==Objectives==
Speak with [[Warden Captain Sinjoirmi]] at the [[Temporal Conflux]] in [[Thaldraszus]].

==Description==
Fine dining is all about using the finest techniques on the finest ingredients, naturally. The food composed for fine dining is oft locked behind wealth and means, but we would never allow that at The [[Ruby Feast]]!

[[Chef Morsel|Morsel]] has informed me of a perfect ingredient for today's theme. One so rare, so exquisite, that it... does not exist yet! Tantalizing, no?

[[Bronze dragonflight|The bronze]] have uncovered a [[portal]] to a dangerous future. One where a black truffle with untold flavor exists!

You must go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, <name>? My plate is full, but I will always make room at the table for you.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Vintner Iltheux]]|If I may be so bold, Rumiastrasza, how do you and Morsel perform your cooking? Physically, I mean.}}
:{{Text|say|Rumiastrasza|I welcome the question, Chef! I often use magic to handle my tools. Morsel here is far more technically-minded, and refuses to use anything but his own hands.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Astounding!}}
