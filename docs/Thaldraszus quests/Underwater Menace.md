==Objectives==
Use 5 Ominous Conches in the Tyrhold Fishing Hole to summon a huge underwater beast, and bring back something as a proof of its demise. 

You may unlock only one extra fishing net per day.
*[[Grim Morsel]]

==Description==
Did you see that? Underwater! A huge, armored, hungry beast! No way I'm getting near water with my net while that monstrosity lurks below. If you want, you can likely lure out with a handful of Ominous Conches, those shouldn't be too hard to catch.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Restock Fish|id=384012|Increases the remaining stock of fish by 10.|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}
:{{Abilities|Extra Net - Tyrhold|id=399021|Completing this task frees up space for another net to be placed in this fishing hole today.|icon=inv_fishing_nethooks01}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Ominous Conch]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
You're not afraid of littoral megafauna, are you? Because I am!

==Completion==
You don't mind sharing some of the meat with me? Why thank you, let me show you the best fishing net spot around in return.
