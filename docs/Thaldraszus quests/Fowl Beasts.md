==Objectives==
Slay 10 Fowl Beasts in [[Winterpelt Hollow]] in [[Azure Span]].
*Kill [[Fowl Beast]]s (10)

==Description==
I believe my time displacement was caused by the horrific creatures to the south.

I can hear them even now, with their monstrous noises. No doubt they ripped me from my original time just to taunt me.

Slay them for me and for the safety of all good people in [[Azeroth|this world]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*[[Soridormi Commendation]] (30)
*70x [[Paracausal Flakes]]

==Progress==
Well? What are you waiting for? Think of all the children you could be saving from those monstrous creatures.

Not that I saw any, but you never know.

==Completion==
You have done this world a service.

<Nathanos shudders.>

No one should have to see such creatures in their lifetime. I can still hear their quacking now...

==Notes==
On return, Nathanos has new gossip:
{{book|content=
I don't like this place. Not enough cover. Too exposed. 

I'm eager to return home. My ranger-general will be wondering where I've gone.

{{gossip|The monsters you sent me to kill seemed like harmless ducks.}}

Nonsense, that's just what they wanted you to think.

I'm onto them though, with their beady eyes and strangely shaped beaks. Can't even pretend to be disgusting birds properly. 

Monstrous beings of eldritch origin, that's what they are. No doubt in my mind.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Marris|Thank you for dealing with those monstrosities. I can finally head home. [[Sylvanas Windrunner|My ranger-general]] awaits.}}
:''Nathanos walks into the time portal behind him.''
