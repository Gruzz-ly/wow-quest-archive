This quest unlocked the week of 21 November 2023, and requires having completed the past portions of the storyline, up to and including [[Dislocated Disc Located]] from the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]] in [[patch 10.1.7]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Travard]] at the [[Tyr's Guard]] headquarters.

==Description==
After a lot of rigorous training, the time has come! Travard believes the Tyr's Guard is ready to recover the [[disc of Tyr]] from the [[Nighthold]]. 

Meet us at [[Tyr's Rest]], the new Tyr's Guard headquarters. It's just south of [[Tyrhold]]. 

We will finally make [[Tyr]] whole again!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
There you are, <name>. Ready to finally get that disc?

==Notes==
;Approaching Valunei
:{{Text|say|Valunei|<Name>! Travard sent me to find you.}}

Before accepting the quest, Valunei has gossip:
:There you are, <name>! The Tyr's Guard is ready to get back Tyr's disc.

:{{Gossip|Tyr's Guard? Disc? Can you remind me?}}
::I understand, <name>--a lot has happened.

::Travard recruited us--the Tyr's Guard--to help him recover the disc of Tyr that contained the keeper's memories.

::He recruited you to teach us how to be adventurers and to keep us alive.

::Then Chromie and Eternus had us deploy temporal beacons to find the location of the disc of Tyr, which had been lost in the timeways.

::The disc is now in the Nighthold in another timeway with [[Elisande]]. And we're ready take it back.

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Valunei|I'll see you at Tyr's Rest, <name>! Don't keep the Tyr's Guard waiting.}}

Head to Tyr's Rest at {{Co|59.71|63.78|Thaldraszus}}. All the members are inside and there are also visitors - [[Justicar Julia Celeste]] and [[Vindicator Boros]].
:{{Text|say|Justicar Julia Celeste|Travard said that Tyr may walk [[Azeroth]] again...}}
:{{Text|say|Vindicator Boros|An incredible possibility! It's quite an exciting time to be a [[paladin]].}}
:{{Text|say|Justicar Julia Celeste|It's hard to even imagine what that could mean--how Tyr would change things!}}
:{{Text|say|Vindicator Boros|Indeed, it could change everything.}}

They also have a gossip. Julia:
:It's really impressive to see what Travard was able to achieve for Tyr's Guard with [[Koranos]]'s help.

:Tyr's Rest has everything these paladins need for their mission and plenty of room to grow in the future should they succeed in restoring Tyr.

Boros:
:It brings me joy to see how Travard has brought together new paladins for Tyr's Guard.

:It is good to see both Alliance and Horde working together. Blood Elf, Lightforged, Zandalari... even a Kul Tiran! 

:It reminds me of the unity we paladins had during our war against the Legion. 

:Those dark days forged unbreakable bonds among us.

On a table opposite the two paladins, there is the book with extra lore, [[The Reforging of the Tyr's Guard]].
