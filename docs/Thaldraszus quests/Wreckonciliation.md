==Objectives==
Inform 12 [[dragonkin]] of [[Alexstrasza]]'s planned changes.
*[[Flightless|Rebels]] informed of coming changes (12)
*[[Notes on Dragonkin Equality]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Captain Drine]] informed me that Alexstrasza wants this done as peacefully as possible. And I've heard Alexstrasza is considering granting the Dragonkin more rights. Or even freedom.

Instead of fighting our way through all these rebels when peace may be on the horizon, let's spread the word! Tell the dragonkin here that things are changing. Perhaps some will lay down their arms or choose to leave.

But be prepared to deal with those who insist on fighting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 51,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Remember, each dragonkin you convince is a life you've saved.

==Completion==
That's great that so many stopped fighting! Too bad for those who didn't, but if you'd told me a camp full of rebels was largely going to lay down their arms, I wouldn't have believed it. Alexstrasza will be pleased, <name>!
