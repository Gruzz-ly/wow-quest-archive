==Objectives==
Dispel the lingering memories of [[Sindragosa]] and [[Malygos]].
*[[Memory of a Betrayer]] dispelled
*[[Memory of a Master]] dispelled
*[[Memory of a Traitorous Sister]] dispelled

==Description==
I admit I forgot about this phenomenon. [[Blue dragon]]s who meet violent ends occasionally have some lingering [[arcane]] energy.

That energy may manifest in various ways once their essences are laid to rest.

Luckily it is a simple enough process to dispel them. Simply wave anything through the energy and it will dissipate.

I shall investigate the essences of Sindragosa and Malygos within this gravestone while you handle that.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How strange that these memories still linger...

==Completion==
That should do it, though it is odd not all of the memories were dispelled as quickly as I had hoped...

Let us speak with [[Kalecgos]] to let him know we should keep an eye on this.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|How strange... are these remnants from Malygos and Sindragosa's past?}}
:''Kalec approaches the [[Memory of a Master]], while [[Alexstrasza]] goes to the [[Memory of a Traitorous Sister]], then both walk toward the [[Memory of a Betrayer]].''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|It would seem so. It appears they were unable to truly depart from this world when they were slain.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|I saw many strange phenomenon such as this when I laid to rest the blue dragons that made it back here from [[Deathwing|Neltharion]]'s betrayal.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|It was a tragedy that so many were killed... including Sindragosa. Even then, the [[Lich King]] allowed her no rest. It pained me to see her raised into undeath.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|I could not believe it when word reached [[Azurewing|my brood]] of what happened to her. It is a small blessing that she did not linger for long in such a state.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Sindragosa and Malygos both deserved better. I hope now we have given them their proper rest.}}
:''Kalecgos and Alexstrasza leave the chamber.''

;Interacting with the Memory of a Betrayer
:<You see the image of Neltharion, the former Black Dragon Aspect. Memories begin to flash as if it were your own.

:You were suspicious of Neltharion. Malygos trusted him. They fought [[Galakrond]] together. Together they saved [[Azeroth]].

:Who were you to go against that? You put aside your suspicions. It was paranoia to believe an [[Dragon Aspects|aspect]] would become corrupted.

:And yet it happened. You cursed yourself when the fighting began. You should have taken a stand. You could have stopped this.

:This all happened because of your inaction. Sindragosa, the Azure Queen, would be no more.>

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Swing your weapon to dismiss the image.>}}
::<The image stubbornly refuses to be dispelled. Instead, more images appear in your mind.

::You are gravely wounded. Before you lost your sight, you saw the blue dragons wiped out in an instant.

::You're flung into the cold reaches of [[Northrend]], far from your home in the [[Azure Archives]]. Far from your intended resting place in the [[Veiled Ossuary]].

::Perhaps you could reach [[Dragonblight]]. Find your rest there. You call out for your love, Malygos, but he doesn't answer.

::You realize there will be no rest. You are alone. Love for the world of mortals is replaced with hatred before everything fades.>

::{{Gossip|quest=|<Use your full force to cast aside the memory.>}}

;Interacting with the Memory of a Master
:<As you look at the figure, the memories associated it flood into your mind as if they were your own.

:You are risen from the dead. There is a figure. The Lich King. He knows your name is Sindragosa.

:You are bound to his will. The once vibrant personality you had is gone, replaced with hatred and bitterness.

:Hatred towards Malygos who abandoned you. Bitterness towards the world that betrayed you.

:Is this what you've become? Where does the Lich King's will end and Sindragosa's begin?>

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Swing your weapon to dismiss the image.>}}
::<The memory does not go away, and instead more flashes fill your mind.

::[[Abomination]]s testing your strength, torturing you. Preparing you to fight the enemies of the Lich King.

::[[Adventurer]]s surrounding you, wielding their pathetic magics against your might.

::You are eventually destroyed... but not fully. [[Crystalline Essence of Sindragosa|Your essence was entrapped within crystalline form]] and handed to one named Kalecgos.

::You scream in fury. They believe you are at peace. They do not know you are stranded.

::Once again, no one is coming to save you. You are trapped for eternity inside this crystal.

::Just as you believe the memories end, it begins again. Rising from the dead, full of hatred...>

::{{Gossip|quest=|<Use your full force to cast aside the memory.>}}

;Interacting with the Memory of a Traitorous Sister
:<You feel memories begin to seep into the corners of your mind. It feels as if they were your very own.

:Cast out from your fellow aspects. The great Malygos left alone to protect Azeroth from mortals.

:The others do not understand what you've been through. You were at the forefront against Neltharion.

:You lost everything. Sindragosa, [[Blue dragonflight|your flight]]... your very mind. Yet you still sought to save Azeroth from itself.

:And for that, your once beloved sister helped lead a band of adventurers to slay you.>

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Swing your weapon to dismiss the image.>}}
::<The image does not vanish, but instead fills your mind with more images.

::A battle. Destruction of your very self. The sadness of your fellow aspects at your death.

::Yet a small part survived.

::They called it the [[:Heart of Magic]]. They did not know it still contained the last of your essence.

::You feel regret seeing the faces of those you once loved. Perhaps you were the one who betrayed them.

::You do not have long to dwell on this, as the memories return to violence.

::Death. Destruction. Torment. That is all you know now, and there is no escape.

::The mortals and aspects must pay for their actions.>
