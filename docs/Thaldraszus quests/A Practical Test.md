==Objectives==
Use the Technoscryers to find the hidden object.
* Attunement "Relic" Recovered
* [[Technoscryers]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you know how to use the device, we will put your skills to the test.

I have attuned your Technoscryers to a valuable item hidden somewhere on this island. Provided you can find it, we will use it to view a scene from the past and deduce how it got there.

It is time for science! Put... the goggles... on! Resume your scrying!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 7,150 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
Have you found that hidden object, <name>?

==Completion==
Eureka! Success!

Quickly, hand the Technoscryers back to me. We will readjust them for the next test.

==Notes==
