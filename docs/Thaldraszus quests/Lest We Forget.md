==Objectives==
Update the gravestones of the departed [[blue dragon]]s.
*Gravestones updated (3)
*Gravestones placed (4)
*Speak with [[Senegos]] at [[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]]'s gravestone.

==Description==
We will be joined shortly by [[Kalecgos]] and [[Alexstrasza]]. Before then, I have a request.

There was a tradition to have gravestones set before your death. It allowed you to choose where you would rest when you passed.

It was the job of the caretakers to update the gravestones and deposit the lingering essence of [[Arcane|arcana]] at the site.

Before our guests join us, would you help me in this task?

Take this list, and these graves. Update the existing graves and place the new ones.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
I will be cleaning this grave while you handle the others.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I believe we are prepared for our guests to arrive.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Stellagosa and Senegos approach the [[Old Gravestone]].''
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Grandfather, why are you still tasked with updating these graves? Surely it should go to younger [[drake]]s.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Young Kalecgos was insistent I rest. But I have been waiting for a very long time to return here and clean this place.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|These graves deserve to be updated. It is not good for the dead to be left without rest.}}

Interact with the Old Gravestone, [[Faded Gravestone]], and [[Crumbling Gravestone]] to update them:
:{{Gossip|quest=|<Update gravestone>}}

Also place the four [[Fresh Gravestone]]s.
