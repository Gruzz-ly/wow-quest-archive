==Objectives==
Go to the [[Serene Dreams Spa]].

==Description==
You there! 

You look exhausted. Worn down. In extreme need of some R&R. I have just the thing! The Serene Dreams Spa is the place for you!

Enjoy our new you-ga classes, they are AMAZING! Or perhaps a mud mask facial treatment is more your speed? I recommend both!

To get to the spa, head north just out of [[Valdrakken| the city]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]
* +4 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
How delightful. I am so glad you're joining us! However, we could really use some help.
