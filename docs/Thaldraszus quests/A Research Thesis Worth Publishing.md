==Objectives==
Ingest clues in the [[Lost Atheneum]] with [[Reese]].
* Watch Reese activate clues
* Information collected (0/100%)
* Return to [[Nirobin]]'s Office
* Transmute Reese's Information
* Read the Research Tome

==Description==
Reese here is hungry as a [[dragon]]-[[horse]] for clues. Clues of the past!

More specifically, we're going to use my unique brand of [[magic]] to unveil and analyze energy that resonates with the same frequency as our relic.

You will guide Reese to these "clues," where I will use him as a remote conduit to absorb those energies.

When we've reached our critter's capacity to hold those energies, I'll port him back here to transmute it all into cold, hard data.

<Reese winks at you. How strange...>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You'd think I'd know about the history of the [[Forbidden Reach]], considering I was there for thousands of years.

But surprise! I wasn't much for the world outside of my lab back then.

==Completion==
I am completely baffled and mildly impressed that you showed no outward embarrassment while escorting a flying, translucent blue squirrel in the open like that. Quite commendable! Bravo!

For now, accept this reward. If you find it lacking, please write to the academy about my annual stipend.

For later, be prepared for further codicological excursions on my behalf!

==Notes==
Upon accept, Reese releases a multitude of [[Clue Seeker]]s and [[Juicy Clue]]s:
:{{text|say|Reese|First order of business is to-- BLARARARAAGHGGHH!}}
:{{text|say|Reese|Well... that may not have been fashionable, but now we can follow all those copies to the clues!}}

Upon finding an area with clues, you can use the ability Gain Clue to fulfill part of the objective, as Reese absorbs the [[Clue Seekers]] back into himself:
:{{text|say|Reese|GALALRLALARLARALRGGHH!!}}
:{{text|say|Reese|Ugh... Quite an experience...}}
:{{text|say|Reese|But, success! It would seem absorbing smaller copies like these gives us minute fragments of data!}}

Upon encountering a [[Juicy Clue]]:
:{{text|say|Reese|Oooh! See that one jumping around? Try to catch it!}}
:{{text|say|Reese|It's huge! I bet that squirrely projection is chock full of juicy data to analyze.}}

As Reese absorbs clues, he grows larger.

Upon absorbing the [[Juicy Clue]]:
:{{text|say|Reese|Sluuuuuuuuurp!}}
:{{text|say|Reese|Oh, yeah. Way more information that the little ones. And I think I'm getting used to this sensation!}}

;Further <!-- not sure how to specify this, it was on a rooftop -->
:{{Text|say|Reese|Woah! I'm sensing a large mass of data to be absorbed nearby.}}
:{{Text|say|Reese|It might be hidden. Maybe even inside an object from the relic's time period.}}

Upon interacting with the [[Cracked Torchlight]], an [[Information-Stuffed Clue]] spawns and attacks.
:{{text|say|Reese|MASSIVE!}}
:{{text|say|Reese|Hmm... A bit too massive, perhaps. Would you mind breaking it down into bite-sized chunks for me?}}

Upon defeating it, it splits into [[Clue Morsels]] to be killed and absorbed by Reese:
:{{text|say|Reese|These are the perfect size!}}
:{{text|say|Reese|And they're teeming with information! Nice work!}}

Upon collecting all clues, Reese teleports back to Nirobin:
:{{text|say|Reese|Reese is at full capacity! Meet me back at the office!}}

Upon returning to Nirobin's office:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|My word! Reese is positively stuffed with data!}}

Upon using Transmute Information, Reese puts all the clues into the [[Intriguing Dracthyr Goblet]], shrinking in size in the process:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Reese is now going to transfer all the clues you collected back to the relic. Should be magical!}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Hmm... Is that gross? I can't decide.}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Either way, why not come over to this Tome of Archived Research to see the fruit of your more-than-menial contribution to my genius acts.}}

Upon interacting with the Tome of Archived Isles Research:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Hmm... I suspected as much.}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Our familiar is hearty, but he is limited in the amount of resonant relic data he can carry in a single trip.}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|It would seem I'll be employing you and your enviable ability to go outdoors again in the near future!}}
