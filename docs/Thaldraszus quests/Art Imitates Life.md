==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Greater Venomsprout.png|Greater Venomsprout}}
Slay the Greater Venomsprout.
*[[Greater Venomsprout]] slain

==Description==
The last time I was in this cave, I sketched a massive flower that dripped a vile, viscous sap. It's one of my best drawings, I couldn't forget it if I tried.

That sap is what's stuck to these [[tarasek]] spears, I'm sure of it. They must have started harvesting it to envenom their weapons.

The plant is beautiful; it will be a shame to kill it. Still, we can't let the tarasek keep harvesting it. <Name>, please cull the plant and put a stop to this whole mess.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Artist's Cinch
|Artist's Belt
|Artist's Sash
|Artist's Waistguard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Please be careful, <name>. You have seen first hand how dangerous this sap is, and I imagine it is far more potent when fresh.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. The [[Embertooth]]'s venom harvesting days should be behind them now that they have been deprived of their source.

I realize now that I don't have to be a [[Waywatcher]] to make a difference in the world. I am going to resign my post and commit myself to my art. Hopefully some day I will be able to depict the most beautiful vistas in the Dragon Isles, for all the world to see.

I just hope my sister understands.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|This should be enough for an antivenom. I just scrape it off the spears and... There!}}
:{{Text|emote|Nori coughs and sputters. After a moment, her breathing relaxes.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Don't move too much yet, Nori. How do you feel?}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Like I got trampled underfoot by a mammoth. But at least I can move again.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|<Name>, I am going to help get Nori somewhere safe. Meet us back at my camp once you've put a stop to this mess.}}
:{{Text|emote|Nori grimaces, stretching out her sore, stiff limbs as she follows wordlessly behind Alvi.}}
:''Both head back to the camp.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Nori, I am so sorry. I don't even know where to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Alvi, you saved my life. You have nothing to apologize for. I am just glad you are okay.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|That isn't true. I have been lax in my duties, Nori, and it got you hurt. The truth is, I want to be an artist. It is the one thing that makes me truly happy.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|I know that the Waywatchers are a part of our family's legacy. I know I have a duty to uphold, but I just...}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Your art saved my life today, Alvi. Sounds like you've found your true calling after all.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Nori, I...}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|You know, with [[Bluescale]] gone we probably won't need as many Waywatchers on this pass.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Maybe you should take some leave time, go see the rest of [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]] with that sketchbook of yours.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Thank you, sister. Truly.}}
