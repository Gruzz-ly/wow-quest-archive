==Objectives==
Collect 100 Temporal Residue from time-lost enemies in the [[Shifting Sands]].
*[[Temporal Residue]] (100)

==Description==
Despite that small hiccup during training, I believe you are prepared enough to aid us here.

The distortions in the valley are allowing different time periods to cross over into ours. We are unsure why these timelines connect which is quite alarming. We need more information.

Please, see if you can find anything about the creatures pouring in from differently{{sic}} timelines. I am sure their passage will have left some sort of residue. By studying it we can hopefully find a way to get ahead of this crisis.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Causality Band]]
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
While it is unfortunate this is all happening, I am eager to discover new chronologies to study.

==Completion==
With these samples, we will have a better understanding of how and why these timelines are intersecting with ours.

Thank you for your assistance.

==Notes==
Any Time-Lost mob in the area will drop some [[Temporal Residue]]. Much like in [[Un'Goro Crater]], watch out for the devilsaur!
