==Objectives==
Assist the [[Timewalkers]] by slaying time-lost enemies, buffing [[Bronze dragonflight|bronze allies]], returning lost artifacts, and closing time rifts in the [[Shifting Sands]].
*Timeline preserved (0/100%)
*[[Scroll of Timewalker Knowledge]] (provided)

==Description==
These incursions push the durability of this timeline to the point of breaking. If only we had our full contingent of Timewalkers!

Though you are a novice with the staff, I am told that you have managed to help us out greatly. With an extra push, I believe you may further aid our cause.

Normally, I would put you through a full training but the times are... unorthodox. Take this scroll of advanced knowledge and use it to push back the invaders! Be swift though, the effects are only temporary.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Time Walkers (cloth)
|Time Walkers (leather)
|Time Walkers (mail)
|Time Walkers (plate)
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 12,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Every incursion threatens to weaken this timeline.

==Completion==
A Timewalker's staff is crucial to shepherding time. Sometimes a gentle prod is all that is needed. Other times, firmer action is required. This should be enough to mitigate the instability in this area for now.

While there is still more work to be done, your companions are eager to assist up at the temple. I will ensure the area down here is supported while you all go ahead.

Good luck.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Andantenormu]]|It is good to see that you have returned safely. What happened?}}
:{{text|say|Aeonormu|We were defending the [[Temporal Conflux]] when fissures in [[time]] suddenly opened and pulled us through.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|What of the others with you?}}
:{{text|say|Aeonormu|They... I do not know. I did not see any others where I went.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Where did you go?}}
:{{text|say|Aeonormu|It was a time that looked much like this... but was vastly different.}}
:{{text|say|[[Siaszerathel]]|In what way?}}
:{{text|say|Aeonormu|The timeline was chaos. There was destruction everywhere. Few left to save...}}

Players are provided the [[Scroll of Timewalker Knowledge]], which provides an [[Extra Action Button]] that casts:
:{{Abilities|Temporal Burst|Unleash time magic dealing damage to nearby time-lost enemies, bolstering bronze allies, and gaining Timewalker's Celerity.|cd=20 sec|notes=2 sec cast. Deals 20% of max health to enemies within 12 yards.|id=376679|icon=spell_holy_holynova}}

Kill any Time-Lost mobs, close [[Time Rift (Thaldraszus)|Time Rifts]] (+10%), and collect artifacts: [[Time-Lost Amulet]]s and [[Time-Lost Scroll (Thaldraszus)|Scrolls]] (+5%) to fill the bar.
