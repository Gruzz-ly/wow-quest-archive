'''Eon's Fringe''' directs players to [[Everywhen Inn]], an area where each day one daily quest is available.

==Objectives==
Find [[Bartender Bob]] in [[Eon's Fringe]].

==Description==
[[Temporal Investigator Tempo|Timewalker Tempo]] and their team finally unfroze Eon's Fringe!

Er... mostly. The [[Timewalkers]] have things more or less under control but Eon's Fringe has some problems the people of the town wouldn't mind a hand with. 

Tell Bob I sent ya!

==Completion==
I'm glad [[Siaszerathel|Zera]] sent you! We have some folks who could use a hand around here.
