==Objectives==
Enter the Time Rift to witness the past.
* Time Rift used
* Speak to [[Eternus]] {{co|37.5|83.9|Tanaris}}
* Help Eternus unpause time
* History observed

==Description==
Eternus intends to show us what happened. I think she also seeks to change the past.

Normally, I would not entertain this idea, but understanding [[Infinite dragonflight|the infinites]] is the only way forward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Eternus has something to show us--I expect we will learn a great deal about her.

==Completion==
Could it be possible to help [[Moraidormi]]? On the surface, it may seem like we can.

But I sense something is... off here. Why was [[Vexemia]] chasing her? What will happen if Vexemia does not move on?

I fell like we are missing something.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Then show me, Eternus.}}
:''Eternus turns around and opens a Time Rift.''
:{{text|say|Eternus|So be it. And if my sister can be saved, then you must concede that the infinites' point of view is valid.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Grief. It hurts us all. And sometimes blinds us. But I hope, for what it is worth, that she is right.}}

Before heading in, Nozormu has new gossip:
{{book|content=We should follow her.}}

Use the Time Rift, and on the other side of the Kalimdor loading screen, players arrive in the [[Ruins of Uldum]] in southern [[Tanaris]]:
:{{text|say|Eternus|Hurry up. Holding time in a standstill is... draining.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Apologies, Eternus. Please... Show us what you will when you are ready.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|I have held time so you would not miss Moraidormi's fate. When I let go, you will see my sister's pointless death.}}

Players are debuffed with:
:{{Abilities|Timeshifted|Experiencing a past event with Eternus.|icon=ability_evoker_timedilation|id=415303}}
:{{Abilities|Time Stop|Held in place by infinite time magic.|icon=inv_misc_head_dragon_bronze|id=415087}}

Players are rooted in place, but Eternus is within reach, so speak with her:

{{book|content=
We have the power to make things better. How can we not act?

{{gossip|quest=|I can't... move...}}
}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Eternus, why did you timelock <name>?}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|I do not want them to interfere--yet.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|You are free now. Step forward to where time fragments gather. Then, I will unpause time, and we will start.}}

This releases the Time Stop. Move to the marked spot on the ground to help Eternus unpause time with the extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Watch History Unfold|Quietly observe what happened in history.|icon=petbattle_speed|id=416240}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Resume time, Eternus. Show us.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|There. It begins.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|That is Vexemia. One of the [[black dragon]]s that fell into madness.}}
:''Vexemia walks forward, debuffed with {{Abilities|Deathwing's Influence|Driven to madness.|icon=achievement_dungeon_coablackdragonflight}}''
:{{text|yell|Vexemia|You cannot hide from me, little dragon!}}
:{{text|yell|Moraidormi|I do not want to fight you, Vexemia!}}
:{{text|say|Vexemia|Then you will be an easy kill!}}
:''Vexemia uses a breath attack, instantly killing Moraidormi.''
:{{text|say|Eternus|Moraidormi made her last stand here. That monster killed her.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|But it does not have to be that way. We can change the past and save her!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|What do you intend to change, Eternus? We should tread lightly here.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|I will do what I must, Nozdormu.}}

Nozdormu has new gossip:
{{book|content=I would like to help Eternus if we can.}}

==Progression==
{{No Limits}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2023-09-08|bluenote=Moraidormi now stops disappearing and Nozdormu will enter stealth more appropriately during the quest "Not Today, Fate."}}
*{{Patch 10.1.7|note=Added.}}
