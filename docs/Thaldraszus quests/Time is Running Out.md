==Objectives==
[[File:Temporal Collector.jpg|thumb|Temporal Collector]]
Collect 8 Temporal Collectors in the [[Flowing Forest]] of [[Thaldraszus]].
*[[Temporal Collector]] (8)

==Description==
With the bronze temple under attack temporal energy is seeping out everywhere.

The [[Timewalkers]] placed collectors all through this forest trying to gather [[Time|all the errant]] [[magic]]. Anything collected can also be used as extra power! Which is a good thing, this crisis is draining all our resources.

I was supposed to retrieve the collectors, but I still need a moment to catch my breath.

Could you get them for me?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Junior Timewarder Leggings
|Junior Timewarder Breeches
|Junior Timewarder Scales

You will also receive:

* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find them all?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. 

Now the forest can try to recover, and the Timewalkers have extra some extra energy.
