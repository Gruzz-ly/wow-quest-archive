==Objectives==
Kill Time Elementals.
*[[Time elemental|Time Elementals]] slain (0/100%)

==Description==
The Infinite has forced the energies of time to aggression. This is not good.

Please slay any time elementals you encounter while assisting [[Chronormu|Ambassador Chronormu]]. I will remain here and help her hold [[Eternus]] in place.

{{Rfb-section}}<!-- or maybe Wowhead is wrong, and they are awarded, as the second item is in the game. -->
*[[Moment's Notice]]
*[[Swirling Sand Fists]]

==Progress==
Did any of them escape to the past? I wonder if we would realize if they did? Hmmm.

==Completion==
Excellent work! Usually I am against killing time, but today is an exception.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Do not worry, Ambassador Chronormu. <Name> is more than capable for this task.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|I know they are. They were amazing in the past! Or was that the future... or right now? Uh, anyway, I know.}}

Kill [[Timeling]]s and [[Timeless Causality|Timeless Causalities]]. The [[Time-Lost Briarback]]s [[Time-Lost Sunseeker]]s, and [[Time-Lost Raptor]]s also count.
