==Objectives==
Find the Cat Toy and return it to its proper time.
*[[Time-Displaced Toy]] found
*Time-Displaced Toy returned
*Take portal from [[Everywhen Inn]] to [[Naxxramas]] (Optional)
*Return to [[Soridormi]] in Everywhen Inn
*Take the portal from Naxxramas to Everywhen Inn (Optional)

==Description==
We have detected another time anomaly. A strange object that even we cannot understand the significance of.

This artifact must be returned before it does irreparable damage to the true timeline and the world as we know it.

Return here once you have recovered the artifact. I will open a portal so you may return it to its proper place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*30x [[Soridormi's Recognition]]
*70x [[Paracausal Flakes]]
*[[Encapsulated Destiny]]

==Progress==
All of our fates depend on returning that artifact to its proper time.

==Completion==
Thank you, champion. You have helped save Azeroth once again. I shudder to think what would have happened, were you not here to intervene...

==Notes==
Head to the [[Flowing Forest]] and find a sleeping [[Mountain Stonefang]]. Loot the ball and return to the inn.
:{{Text|say|Soridormi|Quickly, through the portal! Before the damage to the timeways is irreversible.}}

Take the [[Time-Portal to Naxxramas]]. Up ahead is [[Mr. Bigglesworth]] and the Cat Toy silhouette to place the item. The cat starts playing with it and a [[Time-Portal to Everywhere Inn]] appears.
