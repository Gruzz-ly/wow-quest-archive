==Objectives==
Send each [[Wrathion]] back to his time through his temporal portal.
*Tell Wrathion to talk to Wrathion
*Wrathion returned to [[Ravenholdt Manor]]
*Wrathion sent to [[Stormwind]]
*Tell Wrathion to apologize
*Wrathion's Tab delivered
*[[Wrathion's Tab]] (provided)

==Description==
Five separate [[portal]]s opened up here at the same time, and the same person stepped out of each one.

Now we have an inn full of Wrathions. All different ages, dealing with different things in their own lives, and very eager to blame each other for their problems.

Let's get them all back to their proper times before they cause too much trouble.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*[[Soridormi's Recognition]] (30)
*70 [[Paracausal Flakes]]

==Progress==
All this commotion is bad for business.

==Completion==
Glad that's taken care of. Imagine if our Wrathion had stopped by! I don't think my inn could have handled SIX of them.

==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (1)|I released [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] and all that came of it was death and suffering. And now, the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] is going to destroy everything. Just as I said it would. But it's my fault.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (2)|How can you be so at ease, after all the bloodshed you caused?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (1)|I'm not in the mood for personal reflection.}}

There are five portals - [[Time-Portal to the Obsidian Dragonshrine]], [[Time-Portal to the Chamber of Heart]], [[Time-Portal to Ravenholdt Manor]], [[Time-Portal to The Veiled Stair]], and [[Time-Portal to Stormwind]].

There are 5 Wrathions, four are needed to speak with.

;Mists of Pandaria-Wrathion, level 45
:Insufferable, the lot of them. They don't even realize what their ambition has wrought.

;Mists of Pandaria-Wrathion, level 35
:They're all fools. So busy bickering. We could have claimed the Obsidian Citadel by now!

Click on him to grab him. The Toss Wrathion extra action button becomes available. Toss him to the Ravenholdt Manor portal.

;Stormwind-Wrathion
:Ah, <name>. Glad that you're here.

:I would happily return to my own time, but I have a... predicament. I need to speak with my old friend, now king of [[Stormwind (kingdom)|Stormwind]], [[Anduin]]. I have essential information to share regarding the Old Gods.

:Perhaps you could assist me in crafting a letter that will grant me an audience?

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Help Wrathion write a letter.>}}
::How shall we address this letter?
::{{Gossip|How shall we address this letter?}}
::{{Gossip|Your Most Esteemed Royal Highness.}}
::{{Gossip|Old Friend.}}
::{{Gossip|Whoever Matters Enough to Get Me an Audience with the King.}}
:::And the contents of this letter. How shall I compose the main text?
:::{{Gossip|Straight to the point! I have information regarding the Old Gods' return...}}
:::{{Gossip|Appeal to past adventures with Anduin as justification for his trust.}}
:::{{Gossip|Name drop your mutual friend, <name>, who encourages this meeting.}}

:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Ah, this will do wonderfully! Thank you.}}

;Obsidian Citadel-Wrathion
:Well, <name>, this certainly was not how I expected today to go.

:Lovely to see you. And here, of all places. Looks like I am destined to find my ancestral home after all.

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell Wrathion to apologize to Wrathion.>}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (1)|I suppose I may owe myself an apology. I do have a point, after all.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (2)|I know the guilt you carry. I isolated myself for a long time because of it. But eventually, threats will appear that you cannot ignore.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (1)|But that too will pass. And look how far we've come! Our ancestral home, thriving and vibrant once more.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (2)|Despite it all... I'm glad I have a future to look forward to.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (1)|And that future is so very bright. Remember that in the hardship yet to come. You'll need it for [[N'Zoth]].}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (2)|Excuse me? For what?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion (1)|You'll find out soon enough. Now, we must return. We both have people waiting for us.}}
:''The two Wrathions enter their portals.''
