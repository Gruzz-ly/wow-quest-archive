==Objectives==
Collect a [[Manaheart Bloom|Manaheart flower]] and bring it to the [[Ancient Bough]] to bloom.
*[[Fragile Manaheart]]
*Plant the Fragile Manaheart
*[[Blossoming Manaheart]]

==Description==
The staff was made with the [[Branch of Nordrassil (quest item)|bough]] of a [[Nordrassil|world tree]], so the receptacle that the [[soul]] is transferred to needs to be comparable. Within the adverse conditions of [[Vakthros]] there may be a flower that is tenacious enough to grow.

However, it will be fragile given the circumstances. Find it, and then bring it to one of the [[green dragonflight]]'s groves to help strengthen it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|80|90}}

==Progress==
Did you find it? It grows very rarely.

==Completion==
The flower only grows in specific conditions and due to that it contains quite a bit of magical energy. This should be a perfect conduit for [[Tarecgosa]].

==Notes==
Collecting the Fragile Manaheart:
:{{text|say|Tarecgosa|Know, mortal, that I do not resent our time together... nor [[Kalec]]'s actions. I have seen so much of [[Azeroth|this world]] through your eyes. I could not imagine a world where our lives did not intersect.}}

Planting the Fragile Manaheart and then collecting the Blossoming Manaheart in the Ancient Bough:
:{{text|say|Tarecgosa|As the world changes -- and you change -- I stay stagnant. It is time for me to move on.}}

==Progression==
#[[Tarecgosa's Rest (quest)]]
#[[Love Unending]] & [[Forget Her Not]]
#[[Rhapsody in Blue]]
