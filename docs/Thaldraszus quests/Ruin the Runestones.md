==Objectives==
Destroy caches of incendiary runestones.
*Destroy the South Cache
*Destroy the North Cache

==Description==
<This runestone is strikingly similar to [[Inert Runestone|the one]] a rebel tried to plant in [[Valdrakken]].

Though this stone is unfinished, you spy caches of completed runestones off in the distance.

If you destroy these caches the rebels will not be able to put them to use.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Brave of you to tinker with those strange stones.

==Completion==
I could feel the tremor of those explosions all the way from here!

Valdrakken is now safer, thanks to your efforts.

==Notes==
Find and interact with the two [[Incendiary Runestones]] in the northeastern and southeastern parts of the camp.

==Progression==
{{Misty Vale}}

==Patch changes==
