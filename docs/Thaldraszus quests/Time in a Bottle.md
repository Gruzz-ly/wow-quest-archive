==Objectives==
Collect [[time]] energy from slain time-charged wildlife within the [[Flowing Forest]] of [[Thaldraszus]].
* Energy collected (0/100%)

==Description==
Great! The [[Timewalker Staff|Timewalker staff]] intact! But, it is definitely drained.

I know! You can recharge it using the temporal energy coalescing around the wildlife here. Unfortunately, that means defeating affected creatures in the forest. The energies were making them dangerous and unstable, and we would have had to cull the population after anyhow...

Sometimes you have to sacrifice for the greater good. Could you help? I still need a minute.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Did you recharge the staff?

==Completion==
This staff has been through a lot, but it should be fully functional again.

Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Thank you! Meet me back at the Shifting Sands!}}

Kill Time-Charged mobs in the area and [[Time Mote]]s pop out of their corpses. Run through the motes to fill the bar, for 2% each.

On completion of both:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Dante, this is the <class> I told you about.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|We have met. They appear to be another promising new recruit.}}

==Progression==
