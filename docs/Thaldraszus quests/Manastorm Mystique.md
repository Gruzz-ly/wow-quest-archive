==Objectives==
Talk to [[Millhouse Manastorm]] in [[Dalaran]].
*Take the portal from [[Everywhen Inn]] to Dalaran (Optional)
*Help Millhouse woo [[Millificent Manastorm|Millificent]].
*Return to [[Chromie]] in Everywhen Inn
*Take the portal from Dalaran to Everywhen Inn (Optional)
*Return to [[Soridormi]] in the Everywhere Inn.

==Description==
The Manastorms are... unique. 

While their romance can be explosive, the spark that fanned that flame was quite small. Oddly, Millhouse is having an uncharacteristic crisis of confidence.

We need you to help bring them together. May the [[titan]]s have mercy on us all...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*30x [[Soridormi's Recognition]]
*70x [[Paracausal Flakes]]

==Progress==
The chaos these two will cause concerns me greatly. However, the timeline must be maintained.

==Completion==
You kept events as they should be, and helped two people find love.

That is good. We should focus on the positives here. Not on the mayhem they will cause in the future.

==Notes==
[[Time-Portal to Dalaran]] opens. Take it to be transported to the [[Legerdemain Lounge]] in {{wotlk-inline}} Dalaran and speak with Millhouse:
:Look at her. Just look at her. She's wonderful. 

:Her hair stands up so tall, she carries herself with such confidence, and she has a scowl that could knock a yeti dead from ninety yards.

:There's no way she's going to notice someone like me. What should I do?

:{{Gossip|Tell her a joke.}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Ok Millhouse, you got this. Your best joke. Here we go.}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Excuse me.}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|What do you call [[Rhonin]] when he's been polymorphed into a [[pig]]?}}

::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Oh...}}
::{{Text|say|Millificent|I love bad jokes! Okay funny man, tell me another.}}
:{{Gossip|Try dancing for her.}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Ok Millhouse, you got this. Your best dance moves. Here we go.}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Hey Millificent, check out these moves!}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Oh yeah, I'm going!}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Who's bad? I'm bad!}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|I'm dancing! Oh yeah!}}
::{{Text|say|Millificent|Oh, oh wow. I needed that. Okay funny man, you can keep dancing for me.}}

::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Excuse me.}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Would you like... I mean... how do you..}}
::{{Text|say|Millificent|Come on, out with it.}}
::{{Text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|I... err... sorry. I forgot what I was going to say. Wow, you are so pretty.}}
::{{Text|say|Millificent|That is the goofiest thing I have ever heard! Okay funny man, you can keep talking.}}
:{{Gossip|I don't know. What? I'm some sort of romance expert now?}}
::Please! I'm desperate. I'll take any advice you have!
::{{Gossip|Tell her a joke.}}
::{{Gossip|Try dancing for her.}}
::{{Gossip|Just talk to her.}}
::''Repeats the same as above.''
