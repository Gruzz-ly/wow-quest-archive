{{questportrait|Instigator Belaphon.jpg||Instigator Belaphon incessantly writes propaganda to incite [[dragonkin]] to rebel.}}
==Objectives==
Instigator Belaphon defeated.
*[[Instigator Belaphon|Belaphon confronted]]
*Report back to [[Alexstrasza]]
*[[Maldra's Ring of Elemental Binding#Stop the Presses]] (provided)

==Description==
This is it, <name>. As the one propagating the ideas that drive the [[Flightless|rebellion]], if we can stop Belaphon, we'll see the end of the rebellion.

Try to bind her with my ring, though you'll likely need to weaken her first. If she's willing to surrender, we'll bring her to Alexstrasza.

I imagine the Queen of [[Dragon]]s will have a lot of very choice words when they meet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 77,000 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
Thank you, <name> - you've aided us in opposing this rebellion from the beginning. Now [[Valdrakken]] is safe, and more importantly, I will see that the dragonkin are treated with the respect they deserve.

==Notes==
Instigator Belaphon is in a cave.

;Aggro
:{{Text|say|Instigator Belaphon|The dragons will be made to understand!}}

[[Relentless Quill]]s aid her.

At 20%, he starts running away:
:{{Text|say|Instigator Belaphon|I can't die here! The rebellion is too important.}}

Use the ring on her:
:{{Text|say|Instigator Belaphon|Alright, I surrender! I'm prepared to discuss an end to the rebellion, if the dragons are reasonable. I will make my case to Alexstrasza directly.}}

Head back to the Seat of the Aspects, Alexstrasza, Maldra, and Belaphon are on a platform at {{Co|76.50|33.66|Valdrakken}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Thank you, <name>, for helping us to understand this rebellion. And for bringing Belaphon here.}}

;Maldra's gossip
:I regret my time in the rebellion, but I'm glad to see my people get greater respect. Thank you for working with [[Investigator Erima|Erima]] and I to bring peace to Valdrakken!

;Belaphon's gossip
:For me, the rebellion was always about treating dragonkin right and fairly. I've never been against [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]] themselves!
