==Objectives==
Collect 20 Screechflight Talons, 6 Screechflight Staves, and 3 Creekborne Cores.
*[[Screechflight Talon]] (20)
*[[Screechflight Staff]] (6)
*[[Creekborne's Core]] (3)

==Description==
The [[Screechflight Scroll|scroll]] you found is a command that all [[Bluefeather Roc|Bluefeather]] eggs are to be brought to the [[harpy]] chef, [[Chef Fry-Aerie|Fry-Aerie]]. Apparently, the [[Screechflight]]'s [[Matriarch Avethyra|Matriarch]] won't eat anything that hasn't been properly prepared and seasoned.

So we'll bring her a special egg of our own. One that's EXPLOSIVELY delicious... and will explode when she eats it. Of course.

How will you deliver it? In disguise!

Slay the creatures on the lower cliffs, collect up this list of parts, and I'll whip you up a full-feathered outfit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|27|62}}
*8,200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Got everything I asked for yet?

==Completion==
Perfect! And a little gross. Just as I planned.

Time to craft a disguise and take this matriarch out to roost!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Keep heading west once you've finished and we'll meet up at the pond!}}

Head to the eastern part of the cliffs and start killing [[Screechflight Snatcher]]s, [[Screechflight Cursewife|Screechflight Cursewives]], [[Howling Creekborne]]s, and [[Creekmoaner]]s to obtain the required items.

Once collected, proceed further east to turn in the quest.
