==Objectives==
Gather 6 Magmasworn Spears.
*[[Magmasworn Spear]] (6)

==Description==
This spear appears to be in good shape, given the condition of [[Dead Magmasworn Rockcleaver|its former owner]].

[[Guardian Velomir]] mentioned to keep an eye out for useful materials, perhaps a few more of these spears can be obtained from the Magmasworn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Magmasworn Spearhead]]
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Find anything worthwhile out there?

==Completion==
Good find, <name>! These should be useful.

==Notes==
After picking up [[Remember the Fallen]], the Magmasworn Spear on the bridge just to the east starts this quest. Additionally, a [[:Coil of Heavy Rope]] starts [[Tying Things Together]] further east.

[[Magmasworn Rockcleaver]]s occasionally drop the spears in question.

==Progression==
{{Valdrakken, City of Dragons}}
