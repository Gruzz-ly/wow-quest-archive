==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Laden Lasher.jpg|Laden Lasher}}
Take a cutting from the Stubborn Vine.
*[[Stubborn Vine]] uprooted
*[[Snipped Vine]]
*[[Laden Lasher]] slain

==Description==
Look across the ravine, <race>. [[Primalists]] attacked [[Gelikyr Post]] days ago, and the battle still rages.

Those people need salves and stitching. I can make it for them, but my ingredients are running low. Since you've chosen to intrude upon my home, consider yourself volunteered.

Go to my garden and find the largest vine you can. Snap it from the root, then bring it to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Be quick. A fresh ingredient is a potent ingredient.

==Completion==
The [[lasher]] attacked you?

<[[Szareth]] frowns, sniffing at your clothes. Their snout wrinkles in disgust.>

No wonder--you reek of blood. And not yours, I assume.

War truly engulfs [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].

==Progression==
{{Bleeding Hearts}}
