On accept:
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|With the combined [[magic]] of the [[Bronze dragon|bronze]] and [[blue dragon]]s, we should be able to transfer Tarecgosa's [[soul]] from the staff. If you could prepare the grave, I will start the ritual.}}

After planting the [[Blossoming Manaheart]] on the grave, the [[Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest]] appears in front of the grave.

:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Tarecgosa, my dear sister. I feel as though I am still learning from you, despite being the teacher. Your absence is one that weighs heavily on my heart. I wish I could fly in the same skies as you once again.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|But clinging to an unchangeable past in hopes that fate may be kind is a fruitless dream. I realize this now. It will be the memories I have of you that will define my own future.}}
:{{Text|say|Tarecgosa|Kalec, my dear brother. I wish for you to know one thing. I am proud of you.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I--I'm so sorry... for failing you...}}
:{{Text|say|Tarecgosa|It was my choice -- there is a world that needs you out there now, my wingmate. And I know you will guide our kin into the brightest future. It is time for my chapter to end.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Farewell, Tarecgosa. A dear sister, hero, student, and teacher. Though blood does not bind us, you will always be family.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|May your soul find its place soaring among the stars.}}
