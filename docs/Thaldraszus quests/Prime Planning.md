Collect 7 Primalist Orders from the nearby [[Primalist]]s in the upper terrace of [[Gelikyr Overlook]].
*[[Primalist Orders]] (7)
*Meet [[Sharnax]] outside of the cave in Gelikyr Overlook.

==Description==
[[Commander Thadezus|The commander]] ordered me to establish a forward base and dispatch any resistance. It wasn't until I did all the dispatching that I realized something.

<[[Sharnax]] lets out a long sigh.>

The Primalists were talking about [[Tyrhold]].

Unless you are exceptionally skilled at interrogation, I need you to discover their plans.

You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*8,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is just what we needed.

==Notes==
