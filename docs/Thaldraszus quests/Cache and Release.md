==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Poisoned Spear Stashes.
*[[Poisoned Spear Stash|Spear Caches]] Destroyed (8)

==Description==
Even with their [[Bluescale|leader]] gone, the [[Tarasek]] are unlikely to stop using their poison-tipped spears simply because we ask them nicely. I cannot risk even one of these weapons being used on an unsuspecting traveler.

They will all need to be destroyed. If you did not see any in the caches by the pools, then the [[Embertooth]] are likely keeping their spears closer to the source.

No one else will get hurt because of my carelessness. Enter the cave and destroy any weapon caches that you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Well? Is it done?

==Completion==
The Passage will be a far safer place without those poisoned spears to worry about.

You have kept a lot of people safe with your deeds this day, <name>. The [[Waywatchers]] - and I - owe you a great debt.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|This should be enough for an antivenom. I just scrape it off the spears and... There!}}
:{{Text|emote|Nori coughs and sputters. After a moment, her breathing relaxes.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Don't move too much yet, Nori. How do you feel?}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Like I got trampled underfoot by a mammoth. But at least I can move again.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|<Name>, I am going to help get Nori somewhere safe. Meet us back at my camp once you've put a stop to this mess.}}
:{{Text|emote|Nori grimaces, stretching out her sore, stiff limbs as she follows wordlessly behind Alvi.}}
:''Both head back to the camp.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Nori, I am so sorry. I don't even know where to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Alvi, you saved my life. You have nothing to apologize for. I am just glad you are okay.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|That isn't true. I have been lax in my duties, Nori, and it got you hurt. The truth is, I want to be an artist. It is the one thing that makes me truly happy.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|I know that the Waywatchers are a part of our family's legacy. I know I have a duty to uphold, but I just...}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Your art saved my life today, Alvi. Sounds like you've found your true calling after all.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Nori, I...}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|You know, with Bluescale gone we probably won't need as many Waywatchers on this pass.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Maybe you should take some leave time, go see the rest of [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]] with that sketchbook of yours.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Thank you, sister. Truly.}}
