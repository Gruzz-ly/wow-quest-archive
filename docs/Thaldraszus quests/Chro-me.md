==Objectives==
Trap Alternate Chromies in [[time]] stasis.
*Alternate Chromie investigated (4)
*[[Time Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
One result of your "time realignment" is that it seems to have summoned... me? Well, alternate timeline versions of me.

I've never seen so many [[Chromie]]s in one place! And while they all may be cute, they're playing havoc on the local [[timeway]]s.

We need to trap them to synchronize their time signatures. Maybe then they'll be able to tell us what's going on!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|4|50}}
*4,750 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I know it's not very polite to trap a fellow Chromie, but we need to synchronize their time signatures as soon as we can!

I'm sure they'll all understand. I know I would! I think?

==Completion==
<Chromie listens to your report about what the alternate Chromies told you, her eyes growing wider.>

Oh no. We've been tricked! That Chromie from the future isn't a future Chromie at all. She's an [[Morchie|alternate timeline me]], just like the rest of the Chromies running around!

Why would she lie to you?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Just throw the trap and it'll do the rest! And don't worry, it doesn't hurt them.}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Just kind of tastes like lavender. The color, not the plant.}}

Go below, find time portals, and throw the Time Trap at four of the following alternate versions of Chromie: [[Chronosaurus]], [[Chromew]], [[CHROME-E]], [[Chronormoo]], [[Growmie]], [[C'Thromie]], [[Ol' Chrome]], [[Crowmie]], and [[Chromrgl]].

They get the Time Trapped! debuff and each say something:
*{{Text|say|CHROME-E|Calibrating timeline occurrence. Speculating. You have been fooled.}}
*{{Text|say|Chromew|My poor little kitties! Why, this isn't even her timeline. Why would she bring us here?}}
*{{Text|say|Chromrgl|Thrgglglg mrghth aauuuughibrgubgle!}}
*{{Text|say|Chronormoo|We should not be here! SHE should not be here! It goes against the natural order.}}
*{{Text|emote|Chronosaurus makes distressed roaring noises while eyeing you with confusion.}}
*{{Text|say|Crowmie|I'm cawing mad right now! Whose bright idea was it to bring me here? She's a wicked one, she is!}}
*{{Text|say|C'Thromie|Gul'kafh an'qov Morch!}}
*{{Text|say|Growmie|So many little mes running around! But where's the one who pulled me here? We need to have a BIG talk!}}
*{{Text|say|Ol' Chrome|Where's that there rascal that brought me here? Face me, you yellow-bellied dragon!}}

Only four are required, but all nine can be captured.
