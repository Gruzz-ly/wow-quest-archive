==Objectives==
Speak to [[Nozdormu]] to witness the memory of the past.
*Share in Timeless Sight
*Witness the memory
*Speak to [[Kalecgos]]
*Speak to Nozdormu
*Speak to [[Alexstrasza]]

==Description==
This place is where we last saw our friend, [[Tyr]].

We did not understand the circumstances by which he had to leave, only that it was for something important.

Though it may be difficult for our hearts to bear, I believe this spark called us here to witness that time once more. With Nozdormu's aid we may relive that moment and see if there was some other clue Tyr left behind for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Forgive me, <name>. This is still emotional for me.

==Completion==
Though it is a sad memory, I am grateful for the chance to hear his voice again... if only through time.

Thank you for bringing us here, <name>.

==Notes==
Speak with Nozdormu:
:I have witnessed many moments in time, but my memories of Tyr are among my most cherished.

:{{gossip|Timeless One, I need to borrow your sight.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|An old memory of a beloved friend. Let us hope it has wisdom to impart.}}
:''Nozdormu channels the Timeless Sight spell into the Titan Spark. A projection of [[Tyr|Keeper Tyr]], [[Ironaya]], [[Alexstrasza]], [[Nozdormu]], [[Ysera]], [[Malygos]], and [[Neltharion]] appears. The aspects are all in their visage forms of species that have not yet appeared, however...''
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|My friends, I am leaving on a journey. One that may... keep me away for some time. Before I depart, I have something I wish to leave in your care.}}
:''Tyr reveals the [[:Silver Scale]].''
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|To symbolize our bond, I present you with this scale forged of purest silver.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|A thoughtful gift, though its enchantments obscure my vision as to its true nature.}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|Perceptive as always, Timeless One. But do not be troubled. You know my fondness for mysteries.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I suspect that this scale has a deeper meaning. That you are leaving it with us because your journey will place you in grave peril.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Tell us what danger lies ahead of you, Tyr. We would gladly face it at your side.}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|Where I go, you cannot follow. There is sacred knowledge that can only be safeguarded by myself and my fellow [[keeper]]s.}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|Your place is here. You must prepare your [[Dragonflight|flights]] for the great destiny that lies before them.}}
:{{text|emote|Ironaya motions to Tyr that it is time to leave.}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|I am sorry, my friends. I wish I had more time with you, but I must go.}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|Remember, the silver scale will reveal its value in a time of need. Be well.}}

Speak with Kalecgos:
:Having experienced some of the mysteries left behind by Tyr, I am curious what secrets he'll reveal to us this time.

:{{gossip|<Ask about the memory>}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|There is much about our history that I do not know. I can feel the scale still pulsing with magic. Whatever Tyr left for us is powerful indeed.}}

Speak with Nozdormu again:
:I have witnessed many moments in time, but my memories of Tyr are among my most cherished.

:{{gossip|<Ask about the memory.>}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Though the [[Bronze dragonflight|bronze flight]] is able to experience all points in time, we occasionally forget that it can be pleasant to linger on certain moments. I do miss him.}}

Speak with Alexstrasza:
:This is a task we would not trust to just anyone, <name>. Please keep safe that which is dearly important to us.

:{{gossip|<Ask about the memory>}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Although he is no longer with us, his legacy will always live on within our flights.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Much has happened since the day we said goodbye to Tyr.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I hope he would be proud of everything we have accomplished. To know that despite the hardships we have faced, dragonkind thrives.}}
:{{text|say|Titan Spark|"Dragonkind thrives."}}
:{{text|say|Titan Spark|Voice recognition complete. Input received.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|It seems your words have awakened an ancient magic, Life-Binder.}}
:{{text|say|Titan Spark|Keeper designation "Tyr" not found. Activating silver protocol.}}
:''The spark transforms into a hologram of Keeper Tyr.''
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|My loyal companions...}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|An echo of Tyr! What wisdom has he left behind for us?}}
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|If you are seeing this message, it means a time of great need is at hand, but I am no longer among you. Take the silver scale to my forge in Tyrhold and more shall be revealed.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Mysteries within mysteries. Tyr always had a plan.}}
