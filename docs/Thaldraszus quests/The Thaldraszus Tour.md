*[[:Tyrhold Trial]]

*[[:Academy Ascent]]

==Description==
Thaldraszus. It is the home of the [[Seat of the Aspects]] and much of [[dragonkin]]d's history.

It is also home to soaring heights and steep deep ravines just waiting to be flown over!

As before, my bronze colleagues have set up race courses in Thaldraszus to fly while you explore.

Why not give them a try and complete your [[Dragon Isles]] racing tour?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|51|48|}}
*11,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Fantastic! You have raced your way all over the Dragon Isles. This is irrefutable proof of your skill as a dragon racer!

Even so, I can see even more challenges and advanced courses await you in the future!

But for now, congratulations!
