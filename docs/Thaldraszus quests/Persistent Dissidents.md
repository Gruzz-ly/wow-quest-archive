==Objectives==
Ask 5 [[dragonkin]] why they rebelled.
*[[Rebel Dissident]] Interviewed (5)
*Return to [[Captain Drine]]

==Description==
My goal is to see this rebellion brought to an end, with as little violence as possible. To do that, I need to understand the root causes of this rebellion.

[[Flightless|The rebels]] have clearly come to resent [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]] and the [[dragonflight]]s. And while we had to use force to protect [[Valdrakken]], that hasn't brought about an end to the rebellion.

I'd like you to speak to the [[prisoner]]s, and ask why they rebelled. I'll accompany you to hear their reasons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 51,350 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
I might not agree with all their reasons - certainly not their violent methods - but I have a new understanding of why they want change.

==Notes==
;Speaking with the Steelcliff Dissidents
:What else do you want? Besides my freedom?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Why did you rebel against the [[dragon]]s?}}
:{{Text|say|Steelcliff Dissident|We didn't ask to serve the dragons. We didn't choose to serve the dragons. We were simply commanded to. Against our will.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We wanted willing allies, not forced servitude. It seems we took their allegiance for granted.}}

:I have no desire to speak with you.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Why did you rebel against the dragons?}}
:{{Text|say|Steelcliff Dissident|I don't see any reason we need the dragons! They left this land to us for 10,000 years. And everything was fine.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|That hadn't occurred to me. But surely they must see we need to work together to protect [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].}}

:It's enough to be locked up here without talking to you as well.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Why did you rebel against the dragons?}}
:{{Text|say|Steelcliff Dissident|Every time there's a war, the dragons send us off to die in huge numbers. They want us to fight for them, but what do we get from this?}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|So many dragons have died to protect [[Azeroth]] over the centuries. I had viewed it as us fighting together, not just sending our troops to war.}}

:What else do you want? Besides my freedom?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Why did you rebel against the dragons?}}
:{{Text|say|Steelcliff Dissident|[[Valdrakken]] was our home, and the dragons pushed us out when they returned.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We always thought of Valdrakken as our home. We must remember it is home to the dragonkin as well.}}

:It's enough to be locked up here without talking to you as well.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Why did you rebel against the dragons?}}
:{{Text|say|Steelcliff Dissident|I have my own dreams beyond fighting wars for dragons.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I had not considered this. I do not wish to prevent them from pursuing their own dreams.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Come with me back to Captain Drine, at the entrance to [[Steelcliff Rampart|the Rampart]]. I'd like to discuss what the rebels are saying.}}
