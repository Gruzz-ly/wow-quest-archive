==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Magmaticus.jpg|Magmaticus|This rampaging revenant of flame must be eliminated before the Primalists can unleash it upon the [[Dragon Isles]].}}
Protect Maldra Flametongue while she seals the [[Primalists|Primalist]] [[portal]].
*Speak to [[Maldra Flametongue]] (Optional)
*Protect Maldra Flametongue

==Description==
In the deepest recesses of the [[Emberslate Cavern]], the Primalists erected a [[Primalist Reinforcement Portal|fiery portal]] from which they unleash [[elemental]]s.

I can seal it, but my actions will draw the ire of whatever is on the other side. Including the [[Fire revenant|revenant]] [[Magmaticus]] the Primalists have been aiding.

I will need your protection if we are to stop them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 24,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Nicely done, <name>!

Maldra shared with me the details of your heroics.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|Meet me at the portal.}}
:''Maldra heads out.''

The character has the Fallingwater Blessing buff, so head inside the cave past the fire wall and find Maldra deep in the cave, in front of a fire portal.

;Speaking with Maldra
:This is the moment of truth, <race>.

:I will seal that portal, but I require your protection while I do so... especially when Magmaticus arrives.

:Prepare yourself for anything that comes through!

:{{Gossip|I'm ready.}}
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|Prepare yourself!}}

One [[Blazing Ember (Thaldraszus)|Blazing Ember]] and two [[Incendiary Goo]]s attack.

:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|More are coming. Keep at it!}}

Two Blazing Embers attack.

:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|I still need more time!}}

Five Incendiary Goos attack.

:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|The portal is nearly closed, but I sense that Magmaticus is coming!}}

Magmaticus appears and attacks. During the fight, the elemental summons [[Magma Droplet]]s.

;Magmaticus killed
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|That should thwart their plans!}}
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|Consider this my resignation from [[Flightless|the rebellion]].}}
