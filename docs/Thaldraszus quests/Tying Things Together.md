==Objectives==
Gather 5 Coils of Heavy Rope.
* [[Coil of Heavy Rope]] (5)

==Description==
This coil of heavy rope seems to be in good condition.

[[Guardian Velomir]] said to keep an eye out for useful materials, perhaps if you can find a few more coils he might find them useful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
What is it, friend? Did you find something?

==Completion==
What is this? Rope? There is no time to make a net!

Wait... I have an idea. There are some old weapons that we could use with these...

Good eye, <name>! These are perfect!

==Notes==
After picking up [[Remember the Fallen]] and [[Slightly Used Weapons]], a [[:Coil of Heavy Rope]] on the ground starts this quest.

Additional coils of rope are all over the quest area.
