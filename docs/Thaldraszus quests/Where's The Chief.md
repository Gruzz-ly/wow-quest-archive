==Objectives==
Accompany [[Guardian Velomir]] and inspect the Lookout Tower within [[South Hold Gate]].
*Lookout Tower investigated

==Description==
This is the only part of the fortress we haven't yet searched, <name>. If [[Commander Eranog]] is anywhere, it has to be here.

<Velomir glances towards the nearby doorway.>

Let us see what we can find out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|81}}
* 5,150 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Damn it all! The commander was behind this? I cannot believe he would betray us like this.

==Notes==
Speak with Velomir again:
:This is the only place left that Commander Eranog could be. Hopefully, he is safe.

An in-engine cutscene plays:

:''The door opens into the floor as Eranog stares at a flame stone.''
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|Over there!}}
:''Velomir and the adventurer hide behind some crates. [[Magmatalon]] lands with a crash and sticks his snout inside the tower.''
:{{text|say|Magmatalon|Your guards did not join our ranks as expected, Eranog.}}
:{{text|say|Commander Eranog|I am not concerned. Dead soldiers cannot get in your way.}}
:{{text|say|Magmatalon|I see you have unearthed the flame stone.}}
:{{text|say|Magmatalon|I can sense its strength.}}
:{{text|say|Commander Eranog|It is now time for your end of this bargain.}}
:''Eranog turns around to face Magmatalon. Magmatalon unleashes a fire breath attack, strking Eranog and the flame stone.''
:{{text|say|Commander Eranog|<shouts loudly in pain>}}
:{{text|say|Magmatalon|Arise.}}
:''Eranog changes forms, into that of a Primalist as the flame stone crumbles into ash.''
:{{text|say|Magmatalon|Primalist Eranog.}}
:{{text|say|Commander Eranog|I pledge this power to free my kind from the leash of the Aspects.}}
:{{text|say|Magmatalon|Then go, while I turn this wretched titan-stained place into ashes.}}
:''Magmatalon takes to the air as Eranog runs off.''
