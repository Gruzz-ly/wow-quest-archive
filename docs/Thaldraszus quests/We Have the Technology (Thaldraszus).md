==Objectives==
Ask [[Chromie]] about the plan to recover [[Tyr]]'s memory disc.

==Description==
During our... long discussion about how to find Tyr's disc, Chromie and I agreed that you were the right person to help us, <name>. But finding the location of Tyr's disc could be very dangerous and would likely require more than just your help.

While I work here to narrow down what we need to find the disc, Chromie can give you more details.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
It's good to see you again, <name>! I have hope that this time we will finally be able to restore Tyr's memories.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Chromie
:What [[Eternus]] has told me is fascinating!

:The [[Infinite dragonflight|infinites]]' methods are like [[Bronze dragonflight|ours]]... but they've merged our [[magic]] with [[tech]] from other [[race]]s.

:Here's an example: powerful [[bronze dragon]]s--like [[Nozdormu]]--can sense the [[time]] aura around people and objects they've come in contact with. Like the [[:Silver Scale]]! But doing that is fiddly over long distances--and time.

:The Infinites have beacons that detect those auras over the [[timeways]]. But it requires triangulation and chrononormic flux combined with...

:<Chromie notices your eyes are glazing over.>

:Oh, listen to me go on and on... you just wanna hear about our plan, right?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Yes, tell me about the plan.}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|So here's the plan: we need three beacons delivered to three different places in the timeways to triangulate the disc's location.}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|But these places are potentially dangerous and right now, um, undetermined.}}
:{{Text|say|Eternus|I am... still working on that.}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|You're gonna need help. But I have just the [[paladin]] for that! Here's Travard now.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Travard]]|I have returned to fulfill my duty to Tyr at last!}}
