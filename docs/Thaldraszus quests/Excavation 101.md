==Objectives==
Meet with Roska outside to learn about excavation.
* Meet Roska outside
* Fire Totem placed
* Speak to Roska to start the dig
* First find unearthed
* Second find unearthed
* Third find unearthed
*[[Archivist's Fire Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
So, you want to learn how to excavate artifacts? You came to the right [[orc]]!

Turns out being able to shape the earth is useful when you're trying to get stuff out of the ground. And given how much the elements affect our work, it helps having an [[elemental]] to lend a hand.

But you don't have to be a [[shaman]] to master excavation. I've got the elements covered. I'll just walk you through the detail work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|90}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
What do you think? Having fun yet?

==Completion==
That's a find, all right! Look at you. You're a natural at this!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|We tend to start things off with an earthquake to shake artifacts out of the ground.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Don't think anyone in the archives wants to be shook up, so I'll meet you outside.}}
:''Roska runs outside.''

Catch up with Roska outside:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|You made it! Let's get down to business.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Excavation is all about controlling the elements! To do that, you'll need a totem, and an elemental assistant.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|[[Helpful Flame|This fiery friend]] isn't much help out in the field, but he'll be perfect here.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Place your fire totem down, and you'll be able to empower your elemental to help you. Try it!}}

Roska also has new gossip:
{{book|content=
Nothing better than standing in the dirt, knowing that just beneath your feet could be a little piece of history.

{{gossip|What should I be doing again?}}

Once you've got your elemental assistant and a totem to help control them, come to me for an earthquake.

That'll shake finds out of the ground. They look like big plumes of dirt. Can't miss 'em!

Once you find one, plant your totem beside it and use it to tell your elemental to start digging. 

Not all plumes of disturbed earth are finds. Some might be rocks or even monsters. But chances are good we'll find something worth our time!
}}

Place Roska's Fire Totem:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|You're a natural! Anytime you think you've got a find, use your totem next to it, and your elemental will help you out.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Now it's time to start excavating! Talk to me when you're ready for an earthquake.}}

Speak with Roska again:
{{book|content={{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to start digging!}}}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|One excavation earthquake coming up!}}
:''Roska channels [[Roska's Earth Totem]] to cause an earthquake and unearth a find.''
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Looks like we shook something out! Let's go over and see what it is.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Plant your totem next to that dirt spout and use it to empower your elemental.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Your elemental will take care of the heavy lifting.}}

Empower the elemental to unearth the find:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Bummer! Not everything can be an important find.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Something else popped up. Let's go give that one a try.}}

The first find yields [[Just a Rock]]. Upon earthing the second mound, an [[Aggravated Magic]] elemental spawns and attacks:
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Watch out! You never know what dangers you'll encounter in the field.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Two misses, but I have a good feeling about this next one.}}

Upon unearthing the third mound, players find an [[Outdated Geology Textbook]]:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Great find! Now to get it out of the ground.}}
