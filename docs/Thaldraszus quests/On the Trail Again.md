==Objectives==
Receive Senegos's special sight, then recover the missing tomes.
*Speak to [[Senegos]]
*Speak to [[Stellagosa]]
*[[Tome of Fanciful Spheres]]
*[[Tome of Rolling]]
*[[Tome of Sticking]]
*Bring the recovered tomes to Senegos further within the [[Veiled Ossuary]].

==Description==
Ah... the Veiled Ossuary. I was given the task to be a sort of gravekeeper, which included keeping wildlife away from the area.

I had a rather fun spell split up within several tomes kept within this place to deal with such pests.

The other [[blue dragon]]s did not approve of my... reckless methods, so I had to keep the tomes hidden.

Here, allow me to cast a spell on you to grant you the sight to find these old tomes.

Once they are all gathered, we can cleanse this place of the invasive wildlife.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find my old tomes?

==Completion==
Here they are! I am glad some things have survived all of this time.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Senegos
:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready to receive the spell to find your [[arcane]] tomes.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Just give me one moment...}}
:''Senegos starts casting Arcane Trail.''
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Ah... the spell seems to have fizzled out. I won't make you wait on this old dragon. Stellagosa, could you aid our friend?}}
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Of course Grandfather, I remember it well. Whenever you're ready, <name>.}}

;Speaking with Stellagosa
:It's fascinating to be standing in this place. I've heard so many stories about this area from Grandfather.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready to receive the spell to find Senegos's arcane tomes.}}

:''Stellagosa casts Arcane Trail, and the player receives the same-named buff.''
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|There you go. The trail should be quite easy to follow now. I'll help Grandfather get to the next location.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Thank you my dear. <Name>, we'll be able to see what you see with this spell. Quite handy for extra commentary.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|I believe I may have put too much power into that spell to save young [[Kalecgos]] from [[Raszageth]]... it's taking quite some time to recover.}}

Wisps of arcane power surge into the area. Follow them to find [[Hidden Tome]]s inside the buildings. First book looted:
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Ah... these ancient halls. In the old times, blue dragons would claim a small location in the ossuary where they wished to have their remains sent.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|We used [[Dragonblight]] in [[Northrend]] as a final resting place when it was impossible to return to [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].}}

Second book looted:
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Those who could make it back here after [[Deathwing|Neltharion]] nearly wiped us out passed within these halls. I was ordered to leave their remains undisturbed.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|I was the last remaining gravekeeper after that... given the task to update all the graves before we departed.}}

Final book looted:
:{{Text|say|Senegos|I was younger, more rebellious then. They gave me the gravekeeper role as a way to teach me responsibility. It wasn't until the [[War of the Ancients]] that I took it seriously.}}
