==Objectives==
Harvest 35 Fallingwater Motes.
*[[Fallingwater Mote]] (35)

==Description==
The real threat lies in the [[Emberslate Cavern]]. This is where they carve those runestones and infuse them with primal fire.

No doubt you noticed the blazing wall of flame that blocks the entrance. I cannot dispel it, however I may be able to do something to help. I believe that with the proper application of Fallingwater, we can pass through it safely.

Harvest water motes from the nearby [[elemental]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We will need those motes to get you safely into the Emberslate Cavern.

==Completion==
<Maldra examines the Fallingwater Motes.>

Yes, these should do nicely.

The motes drop from [[Animate Splash]]es and [[Serene Fallingwater]]s found at the water back in the camp.
