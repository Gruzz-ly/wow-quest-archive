==Objectives==
Find the missing recruit in the [[Flowing Forest]] in [[Thaldraszus]].
*Missing recruit found

==Description==
Hello, <class>. You're right on time!

Some trouble up at the temple is causing the [[timeway]]s to destabilize and spill out into the valley. Not only that, but a bunch of [[Timewalkers]] are missing!

We've asked for extra help, but one of the new recruits hasn't arrived yet.

Can you look for her? Be careful though, time's in a massive state of flux around the valley. There's no knowing what dangers are around!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|81}}
* 5,150 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
I knew somebody would come around... eventually!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Chromie]]|I know you'll find everyone and get it figured out. Meet me at the [[Temporal Conflux]] after.}}
:{{text|say|[[Andantenormu]]|We shall do our best. I wonder what is keeping Siaszerathel.}}
:''Chromie shifts to her [[Bronze dragon|dragon]] form and flies off.''

Head north into the [[Flowing Forest]] to find [[Siaszerathel]]:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Hmmm... Oh! The [[time]] [[magic]]s are... there was a... Thank you!}}
