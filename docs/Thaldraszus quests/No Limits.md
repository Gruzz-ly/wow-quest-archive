'''No Limits''' begins the "No Limits" storyline of the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]] added in [[patch 10.1.7]]. 

==Objectives==
Check on [[Eternus]] and [[Nozdormu]].

==Description==
After confronting the [[Infinite dragonflight|infinites]] and, well, [[Morchie|myself]]--we have had a lot to think about.

Eternus, one of the infinites, has apparently been thinking a lot too.

The infinites want to change Nozdormu into his infinite form, Murozond. We don't want that. And after learning about Nozdormu, I think Eternus may be persuaded to not want that either.

I've set up a meeting between Nozdormu and Eternus to get them talking. But I want someone else there... in case something goes wrong.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 XP

==Completion==
This will be a... delicate meeting. Allow me to do the talking.

==Notes and trivia==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chromie|Eternus is lost--a lot like you were, Nozdormu. If we can help her...}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Then perhaps she will see our point of view. I will go to her. Thank you, Chromie.}}

Head to the small building northeast of the [[Temporal Conflux]] in southern [[Thaldraszus]] to find [[Nozdormu]] and [[Eternus]] by a bonfire.

Here, [[Eternus]] has the following gossip
:Nozdormu just does not see what drives the infinite. That is his blind spot.

Right at the release of the patch, players had to have concluded the [[Dawn of the Infinite]] storyline by completing the quests [[Dawn of the Infinite: Chrono-Lord Deios]] and [[Rewind and Reconcile]] (which can be done on Heroic difficulty!) as well as [[Raise the Alarm]] from the "Coalition of Flames" storyline before [[Chromie]] would offer this quest atop the [[Seat of the Aspects]] or at the [[Temporal Conflux]]. Later, all the requirements were removed.

==Progression==
{{No Limits}}

==Patch changes==
