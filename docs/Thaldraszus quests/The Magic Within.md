==Objectives==
Draw out hidden [[magic]] from consoles around [[Tyrhold]] to uncover the mystery of the [[:Silver Scale]].
*Find hidden magic (6)
*Place the Silver Scale
*[[Tyrhold Conduit]] (provided)

==Description==
Intriguing. There are many mysteries living within this citadel that no one, save [[Tyr|Keeper Tyr]] himself, understand. If we are to unlock this further we shall have to explore more of Tyrhold. 

I believe that the scale will draw out secrets stored within this place.

However. there is one complication. The guardians of Tyrhold are still... unstable. They may take your exploration as disruption and try to interfere. Take this conduit. It will help you should the guardians prove troublesome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you discovered?

==Completion==
This spark feels familiar. I was not aware of anything like it here in Tyrhold.

Most curious.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|Be cautious. The guardians of Tyrhold are still behaving erratically.}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|This device may be able to disrupt some of them temporarily, should you need it.}}

Koranos hands players the [[Tyrhold Conduit]], which also provides an [[Extra Action Button]]:
:{{Abilities|Titanic Overload|Release latent magic at an elite denizen of Tyrhold, dealing damage and increasing damage taken for 20 sec.|range=20|cd=30|id=382822|icon=inv_10_dungeonjewelry_titan_trinket_2_color1|notes=2 sec cast}}

The six [[Tyrhold Console]]s are marked with blips on the minimap. Many are guarded, but some are not. Interact with them:
#{{text|say|Fragmented Data Entry|The [[dragon]]s shall be--caretakers--for the future of [[Azeroth]]--}}
#{{text|say|Fragmented Data Entry|[[Odyn]]--refuses to see--Azeroth must take--}}
#{{text|say|Fragmented Data Entry|[[Loken]]'s--must be punished--unforgivable--}}
#{{text|say|Fragmented Data Entry|Shadows rising in that--too great. [[Ulduar]]--infested--by [[Yogg-Saron|its own prisoner]].}}
#{{text|say|Fragmented Data Entry|[[Archaedas]]-- [[Ironaya]]--all--I can trust.}}
#{{text|say|Fragmented Data Entry|The records--must be kept safe--must be preserved for when--}}

Interact with them in any order, then return to Watcher Koranos and place the Silver Scale back on the console next to him:
:''A [[Titan Spark (Thaldraszus)|Titan Spark]] pops out of the console.''
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|Fascinating! What secret is this you have unlocked?}}
