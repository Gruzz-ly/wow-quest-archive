'''Waygate: Algeth'era''' is one of several quests that can be chosen when you unlock an additional [[Ancient Waygate]] beyond the first two. Waygate unlocks happen at Renown levels 8, 10, 15, 17, 20, and 23 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].

==Objectives==
Locate the [[Dormant Waygate]] atop the spire in [[Algeth'era]] in [[Thaldraszus]].
*Waygate activated {{co|62.4|40.5|Thaldraszus}}
*[[Enchanted Arcana Vessel]] (provided)

==Description==
Another stone. Another spire.

Best be gettin' along on yer journey. This one's quite a trek and dangerous tae boot! At least accordin' tae the ones who discovered it.

Are ye up fer it?

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Ancient Waygate: Algeth'era|Unlocks access to the Algeth'era waygate.|id=390504|icon=ability_socererking_arcanewrath}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Can always count on ye tae get the job done.

==Completion==
I'm startin' tae wonder when this vessel might run out of power. Errr, maybe I'm the only one thinkin' that.

What's in this thing anyways?

<Thaelin shakes the vessel, but it makes no sound.>

==Notes==
Interacting with the Dormant Waygate will cause you to channel {{abilities|Effuse Arcana|id=390525|icon=ability_socererking_arcanereplication}} on it for 8 seconds. After the cast finishes:
:{{text|emote|The waygate whirls with arcane energy as it activates.}}
