==Objectives==
Explore the [[Hall of Samples]].
*Enter the Hall of Samples through the nearby Teleporter {{co|54.8|55.9|Thaldraszus}}
*Listen to Toddy
*Pickup Titan Lure {{co|57.2|53.8|Thaldraszus}}
*Use Titan Lure on an escaped proto-dragon
*Lure proto-dragons to Containment Spheres (4)
*Activate the [[Security Console]] {{co|57.2|52.7|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
[[File:Titan Lure.jpg|thumb|Titan Lure]]
Did you hear what that console said?

There's a hall full of samples. Ancient [[titan]] machinery? Specimens from other worlds? Only [[Tyr]] knows what's in there!

Let's change that.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do ye wonder what else the titans captured as "samples?"

==Completion==
If ye decide to retire from adventuring, I'm sure ye could find work as a dragon wrangler.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|And while we're exploring, we should find a way tae get this barrier down.}}

Back toward the entrance are the Hall of Samples Teleporter and Hall of Aspects Teleporter. Take the Samples teleporter for this quest to enter the [[Hall of Samples]]:
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Incredible.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|This... is even better than I expected!}}
:''Toddy runs and Naleidea walks down to the Containment Sphere in the middle.''
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|You wanted broken stasis fields and dragons looking for trouble?}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Well when you say it like that--}}
:{{text|say|Security Console|WARNING... CONTAINMENT BREACH... LOCKDOWN... SECURITY CONSOLE INACTIVE... UNTIL CONTAINMENT.}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|You were saying?}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Let's just coax those dragons back onto the stasis pads so we can reach that security console!}}

Naleidea has gossip:
:Run down it may be, but we could still learn much from how Tyr maintained these specimens.

As does Toddy:
:Keep an eye out while I'm working, all right?

Pick up the [[Titan Lure]] to gain an extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Lure Proto-dragon|Channel an irritating beam on an escaped proto-dragon, causing it to slowly chase you.|id=378253|icon=inv_trinket_80_titan01d|range=30|cd=10 sec|notes=1.5 sec cast}}

Use it one of the four dragons in the area - [[Escaped Earth Proto-dragon]], [[Escaped Air Proto-dragon]], [[Escaped Ice Proto-dragon]], and [[Escaped Fire Proto-dragon]] then kite it to a nearby containment sphere - [[Earth Containment Sphere]], [[Air Containment Sphere]], [[Ice Containment Sphere]], and [[Fire Containment Sphere]]. Each must return to the proper sphere:

:{{Text|bossemote|Lure the proto-dragon back to its containment sphere!}}

[[File:Hall of Samples - captured proto-drake.jpg|thumb|A captured proto-drake]]
;Earth
:{{text|say|Hologram Tyr|This proto-dragon has been imbued with the element of earth. It exhibits an increase in scale density with a minor reduction in flexibility compared to baseline proto-dragons.}}
:{{text|say|Hologram Tyr|Three separate incidents have been recorded where the dragon has nearly breached the containment sphere.}}
;Ice
:{{text|say|Hologram Tyr|Infused with the element of water, this proto-dragon has lost its fire breathing capabilities and gained an equally lethal ability in its stead--the frozen possibilities of ice.}}
:{{text|say|Hologram Tyr|The fact that a proto-dragon's complete inversion of their elemental tendency is not only possible, but so thorough, generates an intriguing thought exercise.}}
:{{text|say|Hologram Tyr|Is there any element--or even energy--that, given the appropriate conduit, vessel, and time, proto-dragons are unable to integrate?}}
;Air
:{{text|say|Hologram Tyr|Infused with the element of air, this dragon has gained the ability to express gusts of wind from its body, resulting in an effective, if rudimentary, deterrent for nearby foes.}}
:{{text|say|Hologram Tyr|The fact that this does not result in an equal, but opposing force applied to the dragon implies the process is innately magical as opposed to mechanical.}}
;Fire
:{{text|say|Hologram Tyr|The element of fire has seen one of the most successful adoption rates of the species, with subjects able to hurl globes of fire hot enough to melt metal.}}
:{{text|say|Hologram Tyr|Additionally, those infused with fire are responsible for more attempted outbreaks than the other proto-dragons combined.}}

[[File:Hall of Samples - Toddy and Security Console.jpg|thumb|Toddy and the Security Console]]
Once the fourth has been contained:
:{{text|say|Security Console|CONTAINMENT ACHIEVED... LOCKDOWN PROTOCOLS TERMINATED.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|There we go! <name>, if ye wouldn't mind doing the honors?}}
:''Toddy runs north to the security console.''

Interact with it:
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Well done! When you're ready, we'll head back into the main hall.}}

==Progression==
{{In the Halls of Titans}}
