==Objectives==
Speak with [[Andantenormu]] and participate in [[Timewalkers|Timewalker]] training.
*Speak with Andantenormu {{co|57.6|78.4|Thaldraszus}}
*Collector drained {{co|57.7|78.3|Thaldraszus}}
*Conduit empowered {{co|57.7|78.4|Thaldraszus}}
*Artifact returned {{co|57.6|78.5|Thaldraszus}}
*Wait for Andante to help restore your personal timeline

==Description==
Shepherding the [[timeway]]s is a dangerous duty.

Though you are not a Timewalker, [[Chronormu|Ambassador Chronormu]] believes you will be of great help. But to ensure your safety we must properly train you.

Unfortunately, all our instructors are still missing. I will do my best to help. Let us see how we both do. I know the Ambassador Chronormu is counting on the both of us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|81}}
* 5,150 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
That was quite unexpected! As you can see, there are many dangers that come with wielding time energy.

I do wish there was time to examine the effects of your little hiccup, but there are more important matters.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Come along. You as well, Siaszerathel.}}
:''Andantenormu and Siaszerathel walk clockwise around the hill to the north.''
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|If only we could skip forward to already being master Timewalkers.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Let me know when you are ready.}}

Speak with Andantenormu:
:This will not make you officially a Timewalker. But, you will at least have the proper instruction to keep you safe as you assist us.

:{{gossip|I am ready to begin.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|That staff is able to harness temporal energy from a source. Please, give it a try.}}
:''A [[:Temporal Collector]] appears behind Dante.''

Interact with the collector:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Well done! The staff can also be used to redirect the energy collected to a target such as this one.}}

Now interact with the [[Crystal Focus (Thaldraszus)|Crystal Focus]]:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Excellent! Now, try focusing your staff's energy at this artifact in order to restore it to its time of origin.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|But, please be careful...}}

The [[Time-Lost Artifact (Thaldraszus)|Time-Lost Artifact]] appears. Interact with it as well...
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Oh dear! It backfired! Brace yourself!}}
:''The artifact stuns the player for five seconds, then sends them back in time to their racial/class starting cutscene!''

The full cutscene plays, and the player will spawn at their racial/class starting spot. Once the cutscene ends, Dante teleports in:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Ah! There you are, <name>. This happens sometimes.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|We must return to the present however.}}

A Time Portal to the Present spawns in. Take it, or Dante will eventually lose his patience:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Really, we must be going.}}
:{{text|emote|Andantenormu sighs.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|We are going back.}}
:''He sends the player and himself back to the present.''
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|As you can see, there are serious consequences to wielding time magic improperly.}}
:''They return to their earlier spot south of the hill.''

The starting zone that players get teleported to is the real one, not an instanced or phased version. Players are really there and can see new players and pick up starting quests. However, characters created before ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm]]'' still end up in post-''Cataclysm'' versions of their racial starting zones, as do characters who started in [[Exile's Reach]].
