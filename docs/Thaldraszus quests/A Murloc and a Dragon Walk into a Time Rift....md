<You aren't certain what's being said. This world's version of Alexstrasza is handing you an hourglass and miming flipping it. It is probably of interest to [[Alexstrasza]].>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]
* 50x [[Paracausal Flakes]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +100 reputation with [[Soridormi (faction)|Soridormi]]

==Completion==
<Soridormi looks at the hourglass you carry.>

This hourglass is of [[bronze dragon]] manufacture. It allows someone to temporarily leap to a different timeway.

You said that this was given to you by that timeway's iteration of Alexstrasza?

<Soridormi glances at Alexstrasza.>

Well, this should prove interesting.

<Soridormi turns the hourglass over.>

After completing the [[Azmerloth]] boss encounter during [[Time Rifts]], keep an eye out for [[Alulgultasza de Urgl-Blalul]] on the way back to the portal, where she starts this quest.

Return to Soridormi. She is accompanied by Alexstrasza.
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|And you are holding up well?}}
:{{text|say|Soridormi|We are. <Name> has been an invaluable ally so far. Ah, here they are.}}
:{{text|say|Soridormi|Welcome back. Alexstrasza arrived to check in while you were closing the time rift.}}

Alexstrasza's gossip:
:The work you have been doing here has been remarkable, <name>.

:Soridormi speaks highly of your efforts.

:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Well, that was certainly a bizarre situation.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|People from our timeline and others have been invading their timeway... She asked for peace. I accepted.}}
:{{text|say|Soridormi|We have no reports of missing people. Likely, time echoes are responsible. Given the current state of the timeways, I'd expect to see them eventually.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Time... echoes? Right. I will leave this matter in your capable hands. Soridormi, <name>, it has been a pleasure.}}
:''Alexstrasza walks away, transforms into her dragon form, and flies toward Valdrakken.''
