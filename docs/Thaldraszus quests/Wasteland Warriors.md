[[File:Blood-Soaked Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Blood-Soaked Book]]

==Objectives==
After completing a Time Rift, return to [[Soridormi]] in the [[Tyrhold Reservoir]].
*[[Time Rift]] Completed
*[[Blood-Soaked Book]] (provided)

==Description==
<This book has what appears to be a modified [[Horde]] symbol on it. You recognize it as the [[Blood Horde]] symbol you have seen from timeway incursions.

It is odd it is still here, after the incursion has ended.

The book has been soaked in blood, though it has long since dried off.

Soridormi might be interested in this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]
* 50x [[Paracausal Flakes]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Soridormi (faction)|Soridormi]]

==Progress==
Hello again, <name>. What do you have there?

==Completion==
<Soridormi flips through the book after you hand it to her.>

[[Azeroth|Our world]] has been at war for such a long time against one aggressor or another.

So has theirs, but they just fight each other, over and over again.

It would be easy to judge them, but our worlds are both drowned in blood.

<Soridormi looks pensive.>

I will put the book on the table in case you want to read it.

==Notes==
During [[Warlands]] invasions in [[Time Rifts]], keep an eye out for the [[Blood-Soaked Book]] on the ground, which starts this quest.

This is one of the criteria of [[Temporal Acquisitions Specialist]].
