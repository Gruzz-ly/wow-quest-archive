==Objectives==
Meet [[Reese]] at the [[Lost Atheneum]] in the [[Forbidden Reach]] to continue your research.

==Description==
I have finally brought history itself to life! I am a success!

Now let's utilize your particular set of skills. Chiefly, I require your ability to go outside without dying of fright.

Channeling my magic onto our new friend here, I'll teleport it to the location with the highest concentration of resonant energy linked to the relic. You'll meet up with it there and await further instructions.

Fear not! My magics may elude your understanding, but my intellect is certain to guide us true!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Out of this arcane squirrel's mouth comes the crackled sound of [[Nirobin]]'s voice.>

<Name>? Can you hear me? It's Nirobin! Codicological genius and mild agoraphobe!

I assume you're ready to use this critter to uncover the lost secrets of [[Dracthyr]] civilization. Why else would you be talking to a squirrel?

==Notes==
Upon accept, Nirobin teleports Reese:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Everyone say, "Bye, Reese!"}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Wait... Did I name him Reese, or did he do that himself?}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Good luck out there, <name>. We'll be in touch. And enjoy the outside, I suppose.}}

Catch up with [[Reese]] at the [[Lost Atheneum]] in central Forbidden Reach:
:{{text|say|Reese|Hello? Is anyone there? Can you hear me?}}
