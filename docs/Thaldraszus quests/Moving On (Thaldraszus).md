I thank you, <name>.

<Name>, please accept our most sincere gratitude for all you have done for us. I will let you know when the time comes to accompany me on this next step.

==Notes==
Back to [[Valdrakken]], and to the top of the [[Seat of the Aspects]], where the four aspects await.

Speak with Alexstrasza:
:Life's blessings be with you.

:{{gossip|quest=|All of the Oathstones have been restored.}}
::This is wonderful news, <name>. With each activation, our flights have been renewed to their purpose once more. Now there is but one final step before our aspectral powers can be restored. I must activate the Mother Oathstone.

::It has been centuries since it has been seen, let alone used. I will require some time to prepare for the activation ritual.

::We are ever closer to being the protectors of Azeroth we were meant to be. I thank you, friend of dragonkind. Your assistance has been a blessing to our flights.
