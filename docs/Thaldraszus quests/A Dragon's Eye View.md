==Objectives==
Travel to the cave above the [[Sand-Lost Sanctum]] in [[Thaldraszus]].
*Locate the Potential Roost

==Description==
I believe I know just the location for the [[Netherwing]] to roost.

It has a wonderful view and is quite secluded.

I'd like to show our guest some of the sights of [[Valdrakken]] before we go. Meet you there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Really, the view from the cave is quite remarkable.

==Completion==
There seem to be far more spiders here than the last time I visited.

But it seems as if [[Vyranoth]] has a plan of action.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Mordenaku, on behalf the [[Valdrakken Accord]], I would like to formally extend an offer of membership to you and your flight.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Mordenaku]]|On behalf of my flight, I accept the offer.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Wonderful! Before we join <name>, let me show you some of the sights of the city. If you will follow me.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Come then, [[Curious Netherwhelp|little ones]].}}
:''They start walking.''
:{{Text|say|Mordenaku|I apologize if the whelps are bothering you. They know very little of anything other than [[Outland]].}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|They are curious. Not bothersome.}}

Head to {{Co|61.2|73.2|Thaldraszus}} between [[Tyrhold]] and the [[Temporal Conflux]]. The dragons are now accompanied by [[Xiddorm]] and [[Naldormi]], mischief makers. Most present have new gossip:
{{book|Mordenaku|content=
Such views... no wounded sky. No shattered landscape.

Odd that pristine land would be so unsettling. But it is a good kind of unsettling, I think.
}}

{{book|Vyranoth|content=
Such curious whelps. They could do with a lesson or two in manners.

<Vyranoth huffs.>

A PLEASANT lesson, mortal. One with proper instructors.

I am not a barbarian, nor would I swat at mere babes.
}}

{{book|Naldormi|content=
Hello, friend!

{{Gossip|Why are there so many spiders in this cave?}}

No idea!

Xiddorm and I didn't put them here, that's for sure.

We definitely did not see if we could make this entire cave the biggest spider cave ever.

And under no circumstances did it get out of hand.

I simply have no idea!

{{book|Wrathion|content=
Isn't it pleasant to see our frosty friend getting to know the netherwing?

{{Gossip|What are you really up to here?}}

Me? Up to something?

Do you really think I purposefully invited Vyranoth in the hopes that she would display some empathy for the netherwing? That she would indulge herself in offering her aid and wisdom?

Actions that would perhaps draw her closer to the Valdrakken Accord?

Why, I have no idea what you're talking about.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
