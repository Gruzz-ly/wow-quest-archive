==Objectives==
Place the Temporal Hourglasses throughout the [[Shifting Sands]] in [[Thaldraszus]].
*East Hourglass placed {{co|58.0|86.0|Thaldraszus}}
*West Hourglass placed {{co|56.4|83.2|Thaldraszus}}
*North Hourglass placed {{co|59.4|78.9|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
So, the timeways, yeah? They're VERY misaligned. And you know how we [[Bronze dragonflight|bronzes]] hate that! So we need to realign [[time]] with these temporal hourglasses. Just plop them down throughout [[Eon's Fringe]].

But you know me, always needing to help! So I'll be placing another hourglass nearby. Meet me there when you're all done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,500 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I never thought you would be the one making a mess of the [[timeway]]s! Usually you're the one helping us get out of trouble, not in it.

==Completion==
<Chromie listens to your explanation of what you're doing, her eyes wide.>

Me? From the future? Why, she's one of my top three people to trust!

But it doesn't make sense. Why would she want you to distort the timeways to help [[Nozdormu]]? Seems like it would just give him a headache.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Text|say|Future Chromie|Thanks for doing these tasks for me! It's REALLY helpful!}}
:{{Text|say|Future Chromie|With your help, Nozdormu won't have to worry about a thing. Trust me on that.}}
:''Chromie enters a time portal.''

Each ghost [[Temporal Hourglass]] location has an alternate-timeline [[Chromie]] stuck in a time-loop nearby running between two bronze portals:
*East has [[Chromrgl]], a [[murloc]]
*West has [[Ol' Chrome]], a [[gnome]] wearing a [[niffen]] hat or [[Crowmie]]
*North has [[CHROME-E]], a [[Mechagon mechagnome]] or [[Chromew]], Chromie surrounded by kittens

:{{Text|say|Chromew|Kitten whiskers! This isn't Nexus. Where did I end up this time?}}

Turn in east of the [[Temporal Conflux]] on a small ridge. There, [[Chromie]] is looking at [[Future Chromie]]:
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Who ARE you?}}
:{{Text|emote|Future Chromie stares silently.}}
:''Future Chromie turns away and enters a time portal.''
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Now <name> is here? What is going on?}}

Chromie has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Can you please explain what's going on? I came here to find out who's twisting our timeways, only to find myself! Well, not me me, but another me.
