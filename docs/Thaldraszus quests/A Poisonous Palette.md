==Objectives==
Gather 8 Envenomed Spears.
*[[Envenomed Spear]] (8)

==Description==
I may not be great at my job, but at least I paid attention when I was learning how to do it. Every [[Waywatcher]] worth her scales knows how to make a proper antidote. I just need enough poison to mix it properly.

[[Waywatcher Nori|Nori]] said the [[tarasek]] who attacked her had spears coated with the stuff. Find them and bring their spears to me. If my hunch is correct, I'll be able to make an antidote with the residue from the spearheads.

I just hope we have enough time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Please hurry, <name>. I am keeping Nori stable for now, but the poison is still spreading.

==Completion==
<Alvi takes the spears that you gathered. She carefully scrapes her dagger across one of the blades, removing a film of sticky, sickly sap.>

It's just as I thought. Thank you, <name>. This should be enough for an antidote, and I even think I know where the poison is coming from.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|I have the reagents for an antivenom, but I need samples of whatever they're using on their spears for it to be effective.}}
:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Alvi|Please, move quickly. Nori is stable, but I don't know how long I can keep her that way...!}}
