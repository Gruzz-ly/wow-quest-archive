==Objectives==
Observe events from the past.
* Nexus Point reached
* Put on the Goggles
* Observation Mode activated
* [[Technoscryers]] (provided)

==Description==
Okay, the Technoscryers should be calibrated. I have made the same adjustments to my own pair, so we can view the same phenomena.

Are you ready? Put... them on... again! This time, we will use the Observation mode.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|56|18}}
* 7,150 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
I wonder what we will find?

==Completion==
Oh, my. Ha ha ha ha ha!

I... conveniently forgot about that. You are not going to tell [[Nirobin]] about this, are you?

Academic rivalry takes many forms. It is all perfectly innocent, I assure you!

==Notes==
Upon activating [[Observation Mode]], you see [[Zenata]] in the past, hiding Nirobin's glasses.
