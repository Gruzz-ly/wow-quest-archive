==Description==
I was fighting off a [[pack]] of vicious gnolls who were threatening my prince when there was a flash of light. Suddenly, I was in this strange place and the prince was gone! It must have been that dastardly Matriarch Bluepelt.

Please, find Prince Wrynn and give those gnolls what for!

Thank you. The prince has returned safely.

==Notes==
Enter the cave at {{co|29.10|36.89|Azure Span}} and kill [[Riverpaw Outrunner (Azure Span)|Riverpaw Outrunners]], [[Riverpaw Deadeye]]s, and [[Matriarch Bluepelt]]. Behind the matriarch is Prince Llane Wrynn. Free him.
