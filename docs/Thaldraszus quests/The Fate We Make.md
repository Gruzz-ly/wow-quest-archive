==Objectives==
Rewind history again and see what [[Nozdormu]] has to say.
* [[Time]] reversed
* Ask [[Eternus]] to stop pausing
* History reviewed
* [[Moraidormi]] investigated

==Description==
We just need to be stronger and faster!

We cannot leave it like this, not with the eggs also destroyed.

I will come up with another idea. Restart time, and...

<Eternus sighs.>

Perhaps I will listen to Nozdormu. He keeps telling me I have "missed" something...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Doing nothing makes no sense to me, but I will be patient. For now.

==Completion==
Moraidormi. The whelp. I see now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Let time flow as it will, Eternus. There is... something you must see.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|You expect me to do nothing? While my sister dies?}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Please, Eternus. It is unpleasant but... indulge me just this once.}}

Stand in the spot by Nozdormu and use the Rewind Time extra action button once again:
:''The last quest rewinds once more.''
:{{text|say|Eternus|But Moraidormi will die again. We need to act now!}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I will rewind time again myself, if this does not go as I foresee.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|You expect something different from doing nothing? No. I cannot watch... I'm pausing, I need time to think...}}

Speak with Eternus:
{{book|content=
I may not have another good idea, but we should keep trying. Maybe something will change.

*{{gossip|quest=|Please just give Nozdormu's idea a chance.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Well, your way hasn't worked so far...}}
*{{gossip|quest=|<Make a very compelling and extensive argument to attempt to distract Eternus.>}}
}}

Pick any option -- it doesn't matter which:
;Nozdormu's idea
:{{text|say|Eternus|That--}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Fine, I will give him one chance. Though I fail to see the point.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Thank you.}}
;Hasn't worked so far
:{{text|say|Eternus|That--}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|What a rude thing to say! My ideas are sound. But I suppose we should hear Nozdormu out.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Thank you.}}
;Distraction
:{{text|say|Eternus|That--}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|I--we don't have time for this! Fine, I will watch--if you stop speaking!}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Thank you.}}

No matter what option was cosen, the encounter plays out the same way:
:{{text|yell|[[Vexemia]]|You cannot hide from me, little dragon!}}
:{{text|yell|Moraidormi|I do not want to fight you, Vexemia!}}
:{{text|yell|Vexemia|Then you will be an easy kill!}}
:''Vexemia does the flame breath attack again.''
:{{text|say|Eternus|She is dead AGAIN. Why did you make me watch this?}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Go to her, Eternus.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|What?}}
:''Eternus runs over to Moraidormi's corpse.''

Interact with Moraidormi to start an in-engine cutscene:
{{#ev:youtube|vlv2WKvj_cM}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|My sister. I am sorry.}}
:{{text|say|Moraidormi|The child. Keep them safe.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Child?}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Things are not always what they seem.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Come out, little one. You are safe now.}}
:''A bronze whelp appears from behind the ruined statue and flies over to Moraidormi.''
:{{text|say|Eternus|A newborn whelp!}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Born during the confrontation with Vexemia.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Moraidormi knew if she did not distract her--}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Vexemia would have killed the whelp and destroyed the eggs.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|She died.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|My sister chose to die--}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|For our future.}}
:''Nozdormu turns to the whelp.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|She's gone now.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Go on.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Get help.}}
:''The whelp flies away, but stops for a moment.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|You can make it.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|You will make it.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|I... Let us leave this place.}}

Nozdormu has a new gossip:
:Moraidormi. May you always walk the paths of time in our memory.

:{{Gossip|Will the eggs be okay?}}
::Yes. The newborn whelp will bring aid.

::All of them will survive.

::{{Gossip|Thank you for explaining.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Eternus|Moraidormi wanted the child to be safe. And the eggs. I... must respect her choice.}}
:''Eternus heads to the Time Rift and walks through.''

Completing this quest was an objective in September's [[Traveler's Log]] - '''Final Surge: Complete Quests'''.
