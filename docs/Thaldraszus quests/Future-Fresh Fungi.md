==Objectives==
Capture 7 Time-Blasted Trufflettes from the Primalist Future.
*Use the portal to [[Primalist Tomorrow]] (Optional)
*[[Time-Blasted Trufflette (item)]] (7)
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
A delicious mushroom? Alternate futures are not pantries to be raided for midmorning snacks.

But still... I would be lying if I said I had never dreamed of eating [[Rumiastrasza|Rumi]] and [[Chef Morsel|Morsel]]'s cooking again.

Very well! You have my permission to pass through the portal, though I advise you to find others to travel with.

My wardens have mentioned these dark mushrooms to me before. Apparently, they never stay in the same place for very long. Make of that what you will.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Morsel went so long without telling me about this amazing fungi!

What else are you keeping from me, you wonderful little chef, you!

==Completion==
These... are... MAGNIFICENT!!

Never have I seen such incredible fungi! I must be sparing in my use of these. Or not! Who knows!

I am also glad to hear that the good [[Warden Captain Sinjoirmi|Captain Sinjoirmi]] is faring well. It would please me beyond measure to cook for her again in the future.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Rumiastrasza|Here, Chef Iltheux. Give this trufflette's aroma a good whiff.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Vintner Iltheux]]|Oooh! This... this is incredible! And truly unique!! It would be the perfect accent to a bechamel I make from imported talbuk cheeses.}}
