==Objectives==
Return the sunglasses to [[Zeldis]]. Again.
*[[Sneaky Mud Mask (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<The mud mask looks curious about your intentions, but it is cornered on this branch!>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]
*[[Living Mud Mask]]

==Progress==
I know my sunglasses are amazing, but come on now. This is the second time an [[ooze]] has run off with them!

How am I supposed to be gorgeous in these conditions?

Wait, did you find them again?!

==Completion==
Oh, wow. Look at all that snot on them.

<Zeldis pauses.>

You know, I think they were going out of style anyway.

Keep that sludge away from me.

Or keep it as a pet, whatever floats your boat.

==Notes==
After completing [[Derelict Fashion]], speak with Zeldis again:
:I look amazing, do I not?

:I am sure that is all the reward you really needed.

:{{Gossip|Or maybe another reward?}}
::{{Text|say|Zeldis|We should go to the VIP area. You can enjoy my company further as reward.}}
::''Zeldis approaches [[Redd Skyhammer]], with his entourage in tow.''
::{{Text|say|[[Enamored Fan]]|Why are you leaving?}}
::{{Text|say|Enamored Fan|Wait for us, Zeldis!}}
::{{Text|say|Zeldis|I require passage to the VIP island immediately!}}
::{{Text|say|[[Redd Skyhammer]]|For safety reasons, we are not offering gliders to the VIP island at this time.}}
::{{Text|say|Zeldis|Do you not realize who I am?! I must get back over there, NOW.}}
::{{Text|say|Redd Skyhammer|If you say so...}}
::{{Text|say|Zeldis|That is more like it.}}
::{{Text|say|Zeldis|Wait.}}
::''Redd throws Zeldis on the VIP island.''
::{{Text|say|Zeldis|AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!}}
::{{Text|say|Enamored Fan|Now what do we do?}}
::''The gnome fan cries, then all turn, walk away, and despawn.''

Speaking with Redd Skyhammer, he has the following gossip:
{{Gossip|Will you throw me next?}}
:I think would be better if you rode on a dragon.

:I should not have let him get to me.

;Fly up to VIP island and speak with Zeldis
:I am not dead. I am just resting.

:Come back later.

:{{Gossip|You look dead, Zeldis.}}
::{{Text|say|Zeldis|Just leave me here.}}
::{{Text|say|[[Spa Guest]]|Is that a mud mask?}}
::''A Sneaky Mud Mask takes Zeldis' sunglasses.''
::{{Text|say|Zeldis|They took my sunglasses again. I am destined to suffer indignity.}}
::''Zeldis stands up and heads inside.''
::{{Text|say|Spa Guest|He may have hit his head. Or is he always like that?}}

Head to the back, directly behind [[Barozdormu]], to find the Sneaky Mud Mask sitting on a branch at {{Co|38.58|46.42|Thaldraszus}}. Approach it and Special Treatment becomes available to accept.

Return back to Zeldis.
