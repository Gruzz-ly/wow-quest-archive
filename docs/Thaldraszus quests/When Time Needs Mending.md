'''When Time Needs Mending''' is the weekly ''account-wide'' [[Time Rifts]] wrapper quest.

==Objectives==
Close a Time Rift by defeating a Fractured Causality.
*Complete a [[Time Rift]]

==Description==
We need to close rifts. We need to fix timeways. Honestly, we need all the help we can get.

There's always more work to do. Are you ready for the next challenge?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Contained Paracausality]]

==Progress==
Come now, these rifts aren't going to close themselves.

==Completion==
Good work out there.

Take a moment and catch your breath, but keep your weapons close at hand. It's been one surprise after another.

Fortunately, all this hard work is worth it. Each time rift we close gets us one step closer to fixing the timeways.

==Notes==
*This quest is account-wide, meaning it can only be completed by one character on an [[account]] per week.
