==Objectives==
Observe [[Kalecgos]] and [[Alexstrasza]] putting [[Sindragosa]] and [[Malygos]]'s remains to rest.
*Speak with [[Senegos]]
*Speak with Kalecgos within the Veiled Ossuary.

==Description==
The preparations are now complete. Kalecgos and Alexstrasza should be here soon with the remaining essences of Sindragosa and Malygos.

Both suffered such violent ends. I heard even with his last breath, Malygos cursed Alexstrasza.

And Sindragosa--she was slain ten thousand years ago by Nelthar... by [[Deathwing]]. Yet she was reanimated by the [[Lich King]] and slain by [[adventurer]]s. I can only imagine the state this essence is in...

Forgive my ramblings. Kalecgos and Alexstrasza should be here shortly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
Thank you for aiding Senegos, <name>.

It's time to return to the archives.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Senegos
:{{Gossip|quest=|<Await Alexstrasza and Kalecgos's arrival.>}}

:''Alexstrasza and Kalecgos enter the chamber.''
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Here they are now. Greetings Kalecgos, and to you, Life-Binder.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Ah, Senegos. I saw the remnants of your [[Rolling Sphere|arcane ball]]. I am heartened to see you have not forgotten your old ways.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Kalecgos, you may do the honors to lay the essences of Malygos and Sindragosa to rest.}}
:''Kalecgos kneels in front of the [[Old Gravestone]].''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Thank you. Sindragosa... Malygos... I am sorry it took us so long to give you this peace.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|May you have the rest now you were robbed of in life.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Watch yourselves! The essences seem to be emitting some strange arcane energy...}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|It was not uncommon for powerful [[blue dragon]]s to have their memories reanimate in this way once they were put to rest.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|[[Stellagosa]] and I can investigate this. I believe you have more of our kind to locate, correct?}}
