==Objectives==
Bring the Antlered Skull to [[Soridormi]] in the [[Tyrhold Reservoir]].
*[[An Antlered Skull]] (provided)

==Description==
<Despite its surroundings, this skull does not appear to be [[fel]]-corrupted.

As you move your hand closer, you feel a sense of calm emanating from it. 

Soridormi will want to see this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]
* 50x [[Paracausal Flakes]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +100 reputation with [[Soridormi (faction)|Soridormi]]

==Completion==
<Soridormi gingerly raises the skull to eye level.>

You said you found this by a fel-corrupted Illidan?

I assume this is Malfurion.

And we thought their family problems in our timeline were bad.

==Notes==
After defeating the [[Azewrath]] boss encounter during [[Time Rifts]], look out for the [[Antlered Skull]] on the ground of the [[Legion ship]], which starts this quest.

This is one of the criteria of [[Temporal Acquisitions Specialist]].

==Progression==
