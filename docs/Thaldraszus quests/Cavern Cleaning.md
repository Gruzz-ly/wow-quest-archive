==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Hecutta.jpg|Hecutta|Too big to freeze by running over it.}}
Clean out the [[spider]]s in the cave above the [[Sand-Lost Sanctum]] in [[Thaldraszus]].
*Freeze [[Cave Scuttler]]s (100)
*[[Hecutta]] slain
*Destroy [[Tarantula Egg]]s (5)

==Description==
This cave is adequate. It has a commanding view of the surrounding land, and is highly defensible.

But the state of it is not acceptable.

I will place an enchantment upon you. When you draw near to the smaller spiders, it will freeze them, allowing us to relocate them. The sacs and larger spider will need to be addressed with more... finality.

See that it is done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Have you finished?

==Completion==
Excellent, <class>. We can clean up the remainder and relocate them to another cave.

I believe [[Wrathion]] had an idea of where he wanted to go next.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Naldormi]]|[[Xiddorm]] and I will speed you up to help you! Make sure you run over the spiders, okay?}}

The [[adventurer]] has the Frosty Feet buff and walking through the spiders gives the Temporal Acceleration buff.
