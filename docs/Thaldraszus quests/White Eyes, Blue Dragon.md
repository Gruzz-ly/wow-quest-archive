==Objectives==
Help [[Yumadormu|Yumodormu]]{{Sic}} defeat [[Setogosa]].
*Talk to Yumadormu
*Help Yumadormu defeat Setogosa
*Tell Dromokdormi what happened in the duel

==Description==
<Class> can you make sure the match happens as fairly as possible?

Setogosa is known for bending the rules to suit her whims.

I would not wish to see Yumadormu lose due to cheating.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|40|50}}
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Thanks for helping me out back there! If it weren't for you I don't think I'd have been able to beat Setogosa.

Setogosa will be fine, I'm just going to wait for her to cool down a bit before I reverse the reversal.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Yumadormu
:I am a bit nervous about this, but I believe in my deck and with your support I know I can win! 

:<Yumadormu gives you a small grin.>

:{{Text|say|Setogosa|You ready to play, whelp?}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|Playtime is over Setogosa!}}
:{{Text|say|Setogosa|Fine then. I will go first. I play Mana Wyrm and end my turn.}}
:''Setogosa summons a [[Mana Wyrm (summoned card)|Mana Wyrm]].''
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|I draw a card and play Town Crier, allowing me to draw a rush minion from my deck.}}
:''Yumadormu summons a [[Town Crier (summoned card)|Town Crier]].''
:{{Text|say|Setogosa|This Wyrm will get nothing done like this.}}
:{{Text|say|Setogosa|How about I change things up!}}
:''Setogosa summons [[Kalecgos (summoned card)|Kalecgos]].''
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|Setogosa! That is cheating!}}
:{{Text|yell|Setogosa|Kalecgos! Attack my enemies directly!}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|Can you handle the summoned Kalecgos while I finish out this game?}}

Waves of [[Arcane Elemental (summoned card)|Arcane Elementals]] and Mana Wyrms join Kalecgos.

;Kalecgos defeated
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|You have fallen for my trap!}}
:{{Text|say|Setogosa|It is not possible! How did I lose lose to you of all people?!?}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|I won fair and square, Setogosa. Now leave me and my club alone!}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|And by the way... you are not the only one who can cast spells.}}
:''Yuma exits the tower and casts a spell on Setogosa, transforming her into a whelp.''
:{{Text|say|Setogosa|UGGGGGGGGH!!!! What have you done to me! Yumadormu, how dare you!}}

;Speaking with Professor Dromokdormi
:What happened? I saw Yumadormu leaving the tower but he didn't say anything about it.

:I think he was in a hurry to tell the others.

:{{Gossip|<Explain what happened.>}}

::Oh Titans! Is that really what happened? Setogosa really summoned a projection of Kalecgos and Yumadormu turned back time on Setogosa?

::I'll have to have a talk with them both later about this behavior! At least no major harm was done. 

::I'm glad the Hearthstone club now exists. I think there's been a need for more extracurricular activities for a while now.

::You should probably go see where Yumadormu ran off to.

The objectives are complete. Head back to Yuma near [[Tristan Bailer]] and [[Joseph Healer]]. They are accompanied by [[Dracthyr Freshscale]]s.
