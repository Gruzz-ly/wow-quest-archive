==Objectives==
Slay Primalist Leader [[Ko'jo]] and retrieve the Missing Keystones in [[Tyrhold Reservoir]].
*[[Missing Ward Pieces]]
*[[Ko'jo]] slain

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] thought they were able to overcome the might of [[Tyr]]. They were wrong.

My [[refti]] were able to track down the Primalists to a cave not far from here. As I thought, they have the missing keystones.

Champion, if we are to restore the reservoir, we must get those keystones back.

Furthermore, their leader must be slain so that they won't attempt a second assault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Surely once we get the keystones back, Zuttiki will not look so... Dismal.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Our final task of restoring the wards awaits.
