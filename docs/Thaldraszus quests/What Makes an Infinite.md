[[File:What Makes an Infinite.jpg|thumb|[[Nozdormu]] and [[Eternus]]]]

==Objectives==
See what [[Eternus]] has to reveal.
*Ask about [[Moraidormi]]

==Description==
Eternus clearly has something she wishes to impart to us. I am unsure where this conversation will lead.

But I trust [[Chromie]]. If she believes that Eternus can be swayed, I trust her judgment.

When you are ready, I will see what she has to say.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I am interested in learning what Eternus wishes to say.

==Completion==
So the loss of her sister, Moraidormi, is at the root of everything...

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Eternus shifts into her visage form, that of a troll, and walks around the bonfire to Nozdormu.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Eternus. I am honored you accepted our invitation.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|"Honored... accepted our invitation." Such formality. I suppose I should not be surprised.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|It is no secret that [[Dragonflight|our flights]] view our timeline differently, but I had hoped to meet to discuss peace between us.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Peace? You have no idea what drives us, Nozdormu. Why we embrace the infinites' ethos.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Then help me understand. I seek to mend the rift between our peoples. Tell me. What was your reason, Eternus?}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|My reason? My reason is Moraidormi.}}

Speak with Eternus:

{{book|content=
I am tired of importance being ascribed to arbitrary events in the timeline.

{{gossip|quest=|Who is Moraidormi?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Moraidormi is--was--my sister. She died at the hands of the [[black dragonflight]]. I wanted to save her. I was denied.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Sometimes moments in time must stay as they are for reasons that are not readily apparent.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|I have turned that moment over and over in my mind. There is nothing. Not one reason why she should have been lost to me.}}

Eternus has new gossip text:

{{book|content=We have the power to make things better. How can we not act?}}
