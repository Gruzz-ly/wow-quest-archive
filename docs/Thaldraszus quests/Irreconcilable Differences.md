{{questportrait|Agitator Zoralek.jpg|Agitator Zoralek|Agitator Zoralek is the architect of a plot to destroy the [[Valdrakken]] aqueduct.}}
==Objectives==
Kill Agitator Zoralek and recover the detonator.
*[[Agitator Zoralek]] slain
*[[Rebel Detonator]]

==Description==
I wish we never had to raise arms against fellow [[dragonkin]], <name>. We should be allies, not enemies. Unfortunately, their leader, Agitator Zoralek, made the choice for us when he threatened the aqueduct.

Fight your way inside the cave, and put a stop to Agitator Zoralek by any means necessary, before he can set off those bombs. Then bring back his detonator so we can secure it. Once we have that, the [[Scalesworn]] will be able to remove the [[bomb]]s safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*77,000 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Were you able to stop Zoralek? Is the aqueduct safe?

==Completion==
By stopping Zoralek and retrieving his detonator, you've secured the aqueduct, for both Valdrakken and the life pools.

==Notes==
Zoralek is at the end of the cave.

==Progression==
{{Rebel Dragonkin}}
