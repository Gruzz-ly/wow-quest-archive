==Objectives==
Retrieve the Disc of Tyr from [[Elisande]] in the [[Nighthold]].
* Teleport to the Nighthold
* Retrieve the [[Disc of Tyr]]

==Description==
The information from our beacons suggests that Elisande has locked the disc away in [[Astromancer's Rise]].

It is a place of learning, and the inside will have minimal protection. I have opened a portal where you and the [[Tyr's Guard]] will have the least resistance... except for Elisande and whatever guards are under her employ.

All of you are on your own once you get there, so try not to muck it up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I wonder what [[Tyr]] is like? I bet he's super nice!

==Completion==
Glad everyone made it, <name>! We have the disc, the [[:Silver Scale]], and Tyr is reforged. Amazing, let's bring Tyr back!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Eternus]]|The portal to the Nighthold is ready. I have tried to place you out of immediate danger.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nozdormu]]|Be careful. This is not our timeline, but with the knowledge Elisande could potentially gain from the disc, she could be a threat to us all.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Travard]]|All right, everyone. This is it: our most important mission.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|We are going to the Nighthold, and we're going to get back that disc!}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Charge!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Hadwin]]|Last one in's a soggy [[troll]]!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nolaki]]|Better a soggy troll than an [[ogre]]-faced man!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Talthis]]|Can you two please take this seriously for once?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Valunei]]|[[Light]] guide us... For Tyr!}}

Follow suit and take the Portal to Nighthold. Doing so starts the '''Retrieving the Disc''' scenario.

===Stage 1: Ready Check===
:Speak with Travard to ensure everyone is ready.
*Tell Travard you are ready

Speak to Travard:
:We're ready when you are, <name>. Let's take back Tyr's disc.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Our main concern is Elisande herself, but she'll have guards, traps, or other defenses we'll need to overcome.}}
:''The Tyr's Guards charge into the room, attacking the nightborne guards.''

===Stage 2 – Secure the Exits===
:Defeat the guards in Elisande's research facility.
*[[Astromancer's Guard]]s defeated

:{{Text|say|Travard|So be careful, everyone. <name> kept you alive through your training and I'd like to continue to do so.}}
*{{Text|say|Astromancer's Guard|You won't reach the upper sanctum!}}
*{{Text|say|Astromancer's Guard|Get them before they reach Elisande!}}

Defeat them. The paladins then face and stand in front of Observatory Stairs.

===Stage 3 – Defeat Senior Researcher Alydrus===
:Defeat Senior Researcher Alydrus.
*[[Senior Researcher Alydrus]] defeated

:{{Text|say|Talthis|Well, that was...messy. But we got the job done.}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|Right. It doesn't feel great, though. The guards probably don't know about the disc.}}

There are also several [[Focused Researcher]]s and [[Runas the Bright]] in the room, and on the ground are [[Alydrus' Research Notes]] for additional lore.
:{{Text|say|Runas the Bright|I do not fear you, outsiders. I know your pursuit of the disc is well-intentioned. But please do not harm the other researchers.}}

;Runas' gossip
:I do not recognize you. But I sense we are somehow connected in a way I do not understand. Go in peace, outsider, and be safe.

;Travard's gossip
:Be careful, <name>--there's no telling what tricks we may yet encounter from Elisande.

Open the door and attack Senior Researcher Alydrus on the stairs.
:{{Text|say|Senior Researcher Alydrus|Wha... Elisande said nothing about visitors!}}

And kill her:
:{{Text|say|Senior Researcher Alydrus|But... there is so much more I have yet to learn.}}

===Stage 4 – Staircase Guards===
:Clear the guards blocking the stairs.
*Guards on stairs defeated.

:{{Text|say|Nolaki|A noble woman. She died protecting Elisande and the disc.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|Noble? What? Elisande is going to align with [[Burning Legion|the Legion]]! And that disc is Tyr's!}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|Yes, but she did not know that--and Elisande may not aid the Legion in this timeline. We are invaders in her home. May she rest well.}}

Follow the paladins upstairs and more nightborne guards appear. Kill them.

:{{Text|say|Astromancer's Guard|For Elisande!}}
Upon death
:{{Text|say|Astromancer's Guard|Get them before they reach Elisande!}}

===Stage 5 – Guardian Ordan===
:Elisande's Guardian, Ordan, blocks the way.
*[[Guardian Ordan]] defeated

:{{Text|say|Hadwin|I don't like this. These people haven't a clue what we're doing here.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|I know, Hadwin. But we do what we must to retrieve the disc.}}

Attack Ordan near the top of the stairs.
:{{Text|say|Guardian Ordan|The Grand Magistrix has not authorized your presence.}}

And kill it:
:{{Text|say|Guardian Ordan|I am not designed... to be defeated.}}

===Stage 6 – Speak with Travard===
:Speak with Travard before facing Elisande.
*Tell Travard you are ready

The paladins continue to the top and stand in front of Elisande's Research Chamber.
:{{Text|say|Talthis|That construct... I thought only a people aligned with the titans could construct such an... orderly thing.}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|They are like us, Talthis. Which makes this fight all the more tragic.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|I suppose. It is but a construct. The real tragedy would be losing any of you.}}

Speak to Travard again:
:Through this door, we'll face Elisande and the disc, <name>. Are you ready?

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}

===Stage 7 – Elisande===
:Face Elisande with the Tyr's Guard.
*Elisande confronted

:{{Text|say|Travard|Keep your wits about you, everyone!}}

The paladins charge at Elisande. 
:{{Text|say|Elisande|My work to understand the disc is crucial for my people!}}

Fight with her until she reaches 50%, she turns {{Rep|unfriendly}}, and resets the attackers.
:{{Text|yell|Elisande|My people's future lies with the disc; leave me to study it.}}

===Stage 8 – Speak with Talthis===
:Speak with Talthis about his plan.
*Hear Talthis' plan

:{{Text|say|Valunei|She used... time magic?}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|And moved us back to before we attacked her!}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|With her mastery of time magic, we need a plan. I have one that may work, <name>.}}

Speak to Talthis:
:A plan to defeat Elisande requires precision and focus.

:Both things I have in abundance, <name>.

:So, how about this?

:Hadwin and I will attack first from the left and distract Elisande.

:Once we have her attention, everyone else can join.

:If she is distracted and our attack divided, she won't be able to throw all of us out!

:Ready?

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}

===Stage 9 – Elisande===
:Face Elisande with the Tyr's Guard.
*0/1 Elisande confronted

The group attacks according to Talthis' strategy, but Elisande casts Frozen in Time <!-- 424924 --> on him and Hadwin and focues on the rest of the group.

:{{Text|yell|Elisande|Leave me to the disc, insect!}}
:{{Text|say|Elisande|What?! I need to focus on the disc! Ask Aldyrus instead.}}

At 50%, she repeats her rewind spell.
:{{Text|yell|Elisande|My people's future lies with the disc; leave me to study it.}}

===Stage 10 – Speak with Nolaki===
:Hear Nolaki's plan for the Tyr's Guard.
*Hear Nolaki's plan

:{{Text|say|Nolaki|That still didn't work. We need to think this through.}}

:That was a good plan, but Elisande is still a step ahead of us. We need to get two steps ahead of her to have a chance.

:{{Gossip|quest=|What's your plan, Nolaki?}}

===Stage 11 – Elisande===
:Tell Valunei you are ready.
*Tell Valunei you are ready

:{{Text|say|Nolaki|We need someone to draw Elisande's focus first. That will be me.}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|After that, we close in from all directions. Except Valunei and <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|Except... me? And <name>? Why?}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|Because with her attention on us, you and <name> will come from behind for the final blow.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|It's a sound plan. But only if Valunei feels ready.}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|I can do it, Captain. I am ready when <name> is.}}

Speak to Valunei:
:Ready to do our part to get the disc, <name>?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Let's go!}}

A cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|A4X9Ksutffg}}
:''Valunei and the adventurer approach Elisande as she has trapped the rest of the paladins in time. Valunei kneels and removes her weapon and shield.''
:{{Text|say|Talthis|Valunei! What are you doing?}}
:''Valunei stands up.''
:{{Text|say|Valunei|Elisande, please! We need that disc to restore the memories of our friend, Keeper Tyr.}}
:{{Text|say|Elisande|His mind holds many secrets that could aid my cause.}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|I know you want what's best for your people.}}
:''Valunei steps towards Elisande.''
:{{Text|say|Valunei|But the world needs Tyr's compassion and valor once again.}}
:''Elisande glances behind her toward the disc and the trapped paladins.''
:{{Text|say|Elisande|So be it.}}
:''Elisande cancels the time spell, opens a portal to Suramar, and walks towards it.''
:{{Text|say|Elisande|I have gleaned the knowledge I need to depart this timeway and keep Suramar safe.}}
:''She stops in front of the portal and looks at Valunei.''
:{{Text|say|Elisande|The disc is yours.}}
:''Elisande then takes the portal.''

===Final Stage – Return to Tyrhold===
:Return through the portal.
*Portal to Tyrhold Taken

:{{Text|say|Talthis|You let Elisande go?}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|I believe that is what Tyr would have done.}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|You did the right thing, Valunei. She wanted to help her people. We were the ones attacking her.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|You have all done well. We have accomplished our mission. Now we will forge the future of the Tyr's Guard.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Let's return with the disc, <name>. I believe Tyr has waited long enough!}}
:''The paladins take the Portal to Tyrhold.''

Before taking the portal, Travard has briefly a new gossip:
:We finally have the disc.

:We can finally bring Tyr back to our world.

:Although... a part of me is apprehensive. What if Tyr isn't who I think he is? Or what if he doesn't approve of the Tyr's Guard?

:Well, the only way to find out is to get the disc back to Nozdormu. Shall we go?

Follow suit and take the portal. Back in Tyrhold, Chromie greets, and the group is now joined by [[Alexstrasza]].
:{{Text|say|Chromie|You all made it back, with the disc!}}

;Alexstrasza's gossip
:Yes, <name>?
