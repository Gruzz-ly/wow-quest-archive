Bring the [[:Apprentice Astrologist Homework]] to [[Eadweard Dalyngrigge]] at the [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]].

==Description==
<These crumbling papers are covered in star charts that you can tell are incorrect, even accounting for the shift in time period. A closer examination reveals marks that have been scribbled out in frustration and disappointed notes written in the margins. Perhaps an ancient student of the stars encountered a difficult lesson? Eadweard would know how better to interpret these and who they might belong to.>
