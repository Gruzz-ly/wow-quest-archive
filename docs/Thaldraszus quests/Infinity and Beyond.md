'''Infinity and Beyond''' concludes the "No Limits" storyline of the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]] added in [[patch 10.1.7]]. Completing this quest is one of the requirements for the "Reforging the Tyr's Guard" storyline, starting with [[A Dislocated Disc]].

==Objectives==
Return to the present to check in with Chromie.
* Time Rift used (Optional)
* Speak with [[Chromie]] {{co|65.4|80.4|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
If we continue to look into the past, we miss out on the present--or even the future.

Let us return to [[Thaldraszus]].

Do not worry about these time fracture [[elemental]]s. They too will heal with time.

As we all do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Ensemble: Temporal Burdens]]
* 5x [[Drake's Shadowflame Crest Fragment]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I hope this experience can bring us together.

==Completion==
We all learned something new today.

Myself included.

[[Time]] never stops teaching. It falls to all of us to always listen and learn.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I will be with you momentarily.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|[[Moraidormi]]. May you always walk the paths of time in our memory.}}
:''Nozdormu casts some bronze magic on Moraidormi, causing her corpse to disappear.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|In our hearts. And in our future.}}
:''Nozdormu walks to the Time Rift and takes it.''

Follow him back to the present. The portal drops players off back at the building behind the [[Temporal Conflux]].

[[Eternus]] has gossip:
{{book|content=I have a lot to think about.}}

Speak with Chromie, north of the bonfire:

{{book|content=
<Chromie speaks to you in hushed tones.>

So, how did it go?
*{{gossip|I learned that even if we can change something, it doesn't mean we should.}}
*{{gossip|We couldn't save Moraidormi. She made the choice to give her life for a whelp.}}
*{{gossip|I learned that... time travel is kind of terrible, actually.}}
}}

None of the options change anything:
:{{text|say|Chromie|Oh my. I feel so sorry for Eternus.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|I hope she has finally found peace.}}
:{{text|emote|Chromie thinks for a moment and then smiles brightly.}}
:''Chromie walks over to Eternus and sits down on the bench.''
:{{text|emote|Chromie gives Eternus a simple nod as she sits down by her side.}}

Chromie has new gossip on the bench:

{{book|content=I hope she has finally found peace.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Eternus|Nozdormu. Are you going to tell me you were right?}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|No.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Because I was not.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Moraidormi's death was a tragedy. It should not have happened.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|I did not see the whole truth. My sister... chose her fate.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|As a steward of this timeline, I must always take the greater good and the free will of others into account.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|But you reminded me, Eternus, that compassion must be considered. Some events are worth changing because our hearts wish it so. On that, I agree with the [[Infinite dragonflight|infinites]].}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|You never wished to become [[Murozond]]. I wanted my Aspect, but I too must remember compassion. And it tells me to follow you... just as you are.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|I will help you. But convincing the other infinites will take time.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|That, Eternus, we have in abundance.}}
:''Eternus and Nozdormu walk off.''
:{{text|say|Chromie|I knew I could trust you with this, <name>. Nice work!}}
:''Chromie teleports away.''
