==Objectives==
Collect 5 Watery Essence in [[Gardens of Unity|the Gardens]].
* [[Watery Essence]] (5)

==Description==
A huge [[fire elemental]] destroyed the pond a few days ago. I think it's behind all this ruckus, but it's too big to fight. We need to weaken it somehow.

But don't count Old [[Gryrmpech]] out just yet, I have a plan!

[[Water elemental]]s decided to make themselves at home in the [[Blue dragonflight|Blue flight's]] gazebo. If you can collect enough essence from them, we might be able to use their magic against them.

Fight fire with fire, right? Well, fight fire with water, I guess.

Anyway, you should probably get going.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
In all my years, I've never seen so many elementals in one place. So why did it have to be my gardens?

==Completion==
Excellent! This is just what we need to snuff out those fire elementals once and for all.

==Notes==
Defeat [[Churning Splash]]es and [[Hulking Wave]]s for their [[Watery Essence]].

==Progression==
{{Gardens of Unity}}
