==Objectives==
Raise Pedgi's confidence.
*Build [[Pedgi]]'s Confidence
*Find Pedgi. Again.

==Description==
I promise he's not always like this. But he is, often, like this.

Usually it takes him a few days to come out of his funk, but we don't have that sort of time. The commission he got to write this song won't last forever.

Maybe we can speed up the process. Could you help raise Pedgi's confidence?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hmm...

==Completion==
I found some trouble!

==Notes==
;Speaking with Pedgi
:I don't know. What if I'm just a fraud? Who am I to deserve the attention of a [[bronze dragon]]? For something as frivolous as a song?

:{{Gossip|quest=|If you were a fraud, you wouldn't be here.}}

:{{Gossip|quest=|Bronze dragons have all the time in the world. I wouldn't worry about wasting theirs.}}

:{{Gossip|quest=|Songs aren't frivolous! And I bet a dragon would love to help with something that isn't a world-ending threat for once.}}

:{{Gossip|quest=|You need to get up.}}
::Maybe you're right... But what if there is nothing to find here? What if this whole search for inspiration is just procrastination?
::{{Gossip|Have you looked out the window? There's nothing but inspiration out there.}}

::{{Gossip|If it's just procrastination, then that's all the more reason to get up and get it over with!}}

::{{Gossip|Every creative endeavor is an uneven journey. But not moving is the only way to guarantee you won't make it to your destination.}}

::{{Gossip|Seriously, you need to get up.}}

:::Yeah... But what if, after all this, [[Temporal Investigator Tempo|Tempo]] can't even help me? What if they don't even like music?

:::{{Gossip|That seems unlikely.}}

:::{{Gossip|Then you'll write a song about your disappointment!}}

:::{{Gossip|I mean... their name is Tempo. Come on.}}

:::{{Gossip|Get. Up.}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|Okay. You're right. I should go out there.}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|That's the spirit.}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|I will find what I need for this piece!}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Exactly!}}
:{{Text|yell|Pedgi yells: I am the greatest composer that ever lived!}}
:''Pedgi runs downstairs and out of the inn.''
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Okay, calm down.}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Well. He's gone.}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|We should make sure he's not causing trouble.}}
:''Melly walks out of the inn too.''

;Melly's gossip
:For such a talented composer, Pedgi sure does struggle to find the harmony sometimes. Best to keep him out of trouble.
