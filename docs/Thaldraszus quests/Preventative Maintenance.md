==Objectives==
Kill 8 Unleashed Elementals in [[Tyrhold Reservoir]].
*Unleashed [[Elemental]]s slain (8)

==Description==
The Primal Elementals are reproducing unchecked. Ordinarily, my sisters and I would take care of them, but we're in no condition to fight them. We've had so many of our soldiers eliminated. 

Besides, we few that remain have other matters we must look into.
 
<[[Zuttiki]] winces in pain.>

That's where you come in, <name>. Could you take care of the elementals?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
[[Mara]], my sisters? This wasn't supposed to happen.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. That should hold them at bay for now.

==Notes==
Kill [[Unleashed Rubble]]s and [[Hydraulic Eroder]]s around the area.

==Progression==
{{Tyrhold Reservoir}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
