==Objectives==
Insert the [[Disc of Tyr]] into the [[titan]] console.
* Disc placed
* [[Tyr]] Restored

==Description==
You have recovered the disc?

Good. At last, we can awake Tyr.

The disc must be placed in the console so it can attune to the [[:Silver Scale]] and pass on to Tyr.

I believe you should do the honors, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
*[[Recorded Memories of Tyr's Guard]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Did you place the disc in the titan console?

==Completion==
Tyr is with us once more. I can hardly believe it. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Interact with the console to place the disc to trigger a cutscene to play:
{{#ev:youtube|JSJ1_Iehzoo}}
:''The screen shakes as the console builds up energy. A magical beam from the Silver Scale fires into Tyr's body. Pulses of energy radiate out, washing over everyone gathered with blinding light. The light slowly dissipates, revealing the scene before them.''

:{{Text|say|[[Travard]]|Did it work?}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Is he...}}
:Tyr stiffly moves his arms and looks at his hand before turning his gaze upon those that are gathered.
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|[[Alexstrasza]]... [[Nozdormu]]...}}
:''Alexstrasza steps forward.''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Welcome back, old friend.}}
