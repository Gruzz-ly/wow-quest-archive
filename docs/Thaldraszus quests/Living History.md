==Objectives==
Activate [[Nirobin]]'s instruments to analyze the [[Intriguing Dracthyr Goblet]].
* Analyze Relic's Time Era
* Analyze Relic's Origin
* Analyze Relic's Context
* Analyze Relic

==Description==
My name is Nirobin. It is worth remembering, as I am a genius in the field of [[arcane]] codicology! Quite an accolade, if I say so myself... and I do say so!

I've spent countless hours fusing [[Blue dragon|blue]] and [[bronze dragon]] [[magic]] to investigate history like never before. Today, you and I will experience the results of my effort!

Let's start by using my instruments on a fabulously preserved goblet uncovered from the [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You may be frightened.

Try to dig deep inside of yourself for strength... if only because there's nothing I, personally, can do to help you with that.

==Completion==
Unexpected...

But "unexpected" is the exact territory pioneers like myself were born to explore! Onward! For scholarship!

==Notes==
Upon accept, Nirobin levitates an [[Intriguing Dracthyr Goblet]] to the center of the room:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Just a second to get everything ready for you...}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Perfect! Go ahead and use these tools to analyze the goblet.}}

Upon using the [[Hourglass of Time (Thaldraszus)|Hourglass of Time]]:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|The Hourglass of Time will assess what era the relic is from.}}

Upon using the [[Compass of Placement]]:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|The Compass of Placement will pinpoint the location where the relic was used.}}

Upon using the [[Specimens of Inspiration]]:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|The Specimens of Inspiration will divine the purpose and context of the relic.}}

Upon analyzing the Intriguing Dracthyr Goblet, it turns into [[Reese]], a flying ghostly [[squirrel]]:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Fascinating! It's... a squirrel.}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|More specifically, it's the embodiment of all the information we've collectively gathered on this relic, manifested in the form of a squirrel.}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Confusing and cute, but ultimately an outcome!}}
