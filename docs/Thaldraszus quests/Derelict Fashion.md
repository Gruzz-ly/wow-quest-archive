==Objectives==
Find [[Zeldis|the owner]] of the sunglasses.
*[[Derelict Sunglasses]] (provided)

==Description==
<A disgusting set of sunglasses is dripping with slime, but they look extremely expensive.

Someone is definitely missing these. This style is very hot right now.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I cannot possibly be seen at the VIP area without my sunglasses!

You see, I grabbed a glider, and was getting some A-MAZ-ING pictures. I looked below, and saw all of these tiny [[elemental]]s the size of ants! I thought, hah, ant-size elementals: what a great photo-op.

But when I got there, they were at least three times the size of ants. A muddy one chased me, but I am very fast.  I hate to think of what has happened to my sunglasses...

==Completion==
My sunglasses?! You expect a reward, I gather. You know the least you could have done is clean them.

<Zeldis breathes on them, then wipes them off.>

I suppose I can throw a few small coins your way.

==Notes==
Although not part of the quest, speak with Zeldis again after completing Derelict Fashion in order to obtain [[Special Treatment]].
