==Objectives==
Meet with [[Chromie]] on the [[Temporal Conflux]] platforms.
*Meet Chromie at the Bronze Temple

==Description==
You have helped us regain our hold on [[Shifting Sands|the sands]], but I can sense something greater happening up on the temple platforms. Let us take to the skies and regroup with Ambassador Chronormu there.

As always, time is of the essence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
About time! [[Eternus]] might look frozen in that bubble, but she's struggling with all her might to get free.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|We will ascend to the temple platforms. Please meet us there when you are ready.}}
:''Dante shifts to his dragon form and with Zera flies off.''
:{{text|say|[[Siaszerathel]]|Race you Dante!}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|New recruits...}}

Fly up to the Temporal Conflux, where Chromie is keeping [[Eternus]], of the [[Infinite dragonflight]] trapped in a [[time]] bubble:
:{{text|say|Chromie|Better get comfortable in that bubble, Eternus. I won't let you corrupt our [[Bronze Oathstone]]!}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Whether I am here for a day or millennia, it matters not. I will ensure the rise of our Lord Murozond!}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|Never! Lord [[Nozdormu]] is counting on me!}}
