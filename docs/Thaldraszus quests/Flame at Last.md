==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Blazing Inferno.jpg|Blazing Inferno|The [[fire elemental]] behind all the chaos in the Gardens of Unity.}}
Use the Concentrated Essence of Water to defeat the Blazing Inferno in [[Gardens of Unity|the Gardens]].
*Use Watery Elemental Essence on Blazing Inferno (Optional)
*[[Blazing Inferno]] slain {{co|35.6|75.2|Thaldraszus}}
*[[Concentrated Essence of Water]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright, youngling, I've placed all the water elemental essences in this jar for you.

If you just toss it at the big one, it should work. I mean, when has water not worked against fire? It's foolproof.

The heat, uh, isn't good for my joints, so I'll just stay here. I trust you can handle it.
 
Good luck, young one!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|55|24|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
You remind me of myself, when I was your age. Nothing could stand in the way of [[Gryrmpech]]!

==Completion==
Incredible! I wasn't sure it was going to work, but I'm glad it did.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Gryrmpech|This is going to be dangerous, so I think it would be best if [[Lord Basilton|Basilton]] stays here with me.}}

Head northwest to the fire elemental area of the gardens and use the provided [[Concentrated Essence of Water]] to reduce the elite [[Blazing Inferno]] to a normal elemental.

==Progression==
{{Gardens of Unity}}
