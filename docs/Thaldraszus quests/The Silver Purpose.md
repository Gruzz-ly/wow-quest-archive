'''The Silver Purpose''' concludes the "The Silver Purpose" chapter of the [[Valdrakken Accord]] campaign, one of the six necessary for [[Friend of the Dragon Isles]]. The next chapter of the renown campaign , Garden of Secrets, unlocks at Renown 19 with [[Emerald Summons]].

The Tyr storyline continues in [[patch 10.1.0]] with [[Silver Mettle]].

==Objectives==
Place the [[Ancient Titansteel Ingot]]s into the forge and finish the task [[Tyr]] has left behind.
*Place the Ingots {{co|60.8|58.7|Thaldraszus}}
*Activate the [[Forge Console|secondary consoles]] (2)
*Activate the [[:Silver Scale]]
*Speak to [[Alexstrasza]] at Tyrhold.

==Description==
<The echo of Tyr activates to your presence.>

Your task is at hand, my friends.

Cast the ingots into the fire and activate the forge. I have prepared the necessary procedures for you already.

The Silver Scale holds the schematic. Its purpose shall reveal itself to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]
* [[Memory of Tyr]]

==Completion==
I cannot find the words to describe our gratitude to you, <name>! You have returned our long-lost friend to us!

In the absence of any further instructions he left, perhaps we can eventually find out what we must do next to restore his true self.

If we can...

==Notes==
Interact with the ghost pile of Ancient Titansteel Ingots at the front of the lava pit. It would appear that the adventurer would gently place them in the neat pile, but instead they just toss them into the lava! Next, interact with the two secondary consoles on either side of Tyr. Finally, activate the Silver Scale on the center console next to Tyr to start an in-engine cutscene:
{{#ev:youtube|GeGEdm4xwgA}}
:''The three aspects fly in and quickly shift to their visage forms. As they approach, the silver scale inserts itself into the console. The titan machinery beneath the platform starts spinning up. In the lava, a body of a [[titanic watcher]] forms, which looks exactly like Tyr. How the cloth came out of the lava is a question best left unanswered.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the aspects continue:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Remarkable! This body looks exactly like the Tyr we knew, though it is but an empty vessel. Bereft of the noble spirit that made him such a trusted friend.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Tyr must have known he was going to his doom, so he left behind the silver scale as a catalyst to restore his physical form.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|A truth he kept veiled from my perceptions until a time when his wisdom would be needed.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Tyr's allies hid a record of his memories in the depths of Uldaman. But before it could be recovered, agents of the Infinite dragonflight cast the disc into the timeways.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We must locate that disc or find another way to restore Tyr. The future of our flights may depend upon it.}}
:{{text|say|[[Watcher Koranos]]|It will be done, Queen Alexstrasza. This I vow.}}

All present have special gossip here.

;Watcher Koranos
:Keeper Tyr truly planned for everything.

:Of all the possibilities this mystery could reveal, never in my existence did I imagine he would find a way to return once more.

:{{gossip|<Ask about seeing Tyr again.>}}
::It is good to see my maker once more, though I know it is only his shell. 

::I feel this is but a first step on a path, hopefully the next will reveal itself soon.

;Nozdormu
:Being who I am, there is very little in life that surprises me. However, it is a delight when such a thing happens. I am glad to see my old friend in the now, instead of just in memory.

:{{gossip|<Ask about seeing Tyr again.>}}
::If Keeper Tyr intended to return it is on us to see it happen. Though that may mean facing... a great darkness, I shall do so. My friend is worth the risk.

;Kalecgos
:Always full of secrets and mysteries. I'm eager to meet Keeper Tyr again some day. It's astounding such a thing is even possible!

:{{gossip|<Ask about seeing Tyr again.>}}
:If he could plan to bring himself back from the dead at the time of our greatest need then I can only imagine he could help us find a way to restore our Aspectral powers.

;Alexstrasza
:I never thought I would see Keeper Tyr return to us once again. It is good to see my old friend, even in image only.

:{{gossip|<Ask about seeing Tyr again.>}}
:With all that has happened I am now sure that the [[Discs of Tyr|discs]] within [[Uldaman]] hold the key to fully restoring Keeper Tyr. We must find a way to obtain them once more.

Completing this quest is the "The Silver Purpose" criterion of [[Friend of the Dragon Isles]].
