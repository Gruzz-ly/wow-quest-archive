==Objectives==
Speak with [[Eternus]] in [[Tyrhold]]{{sic}}<!-- missing dot. -->

==Description==
We recovered. We trained. And now it's time to face [[Elisande]].

Come with us to Tyrhold where [[Nozdormu]], [[Chromie]], and Eternus are waiting to send us to the [[Nighthold]].

We will get [[Disc of Tyr|that disc]], and [[Tyr]] will finally be with us once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Are you sure you are ready to go to the Nighthold?

Are you sure you know what you are up against with this "Elisande"?

From the Nozdormu has gossip:

So does Chromie:
:All our hard work--and yours, and Travard's--has led to this moment, <name>. 

:I'm so excited for all of you!
