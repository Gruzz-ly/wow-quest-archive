==Objectives==
Kill 12 Magmasworn Primalists within [[South Hold Gate]].
*Magmasworn Primalists slain (12)

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] caught us completely unawares.

<[[Guardian Velomir|Velomir]] spits in disgust.>

My fellow guardians were ripped apart by these monsters. I would have joined them in death if you had not shown up when you did.

Off in the distance I can still hear the sounds of battle. Perhaps others still live, maybe even [[Commander Eranog]].

Lend me your aid. I need you to cause a distraction so I can sneak to a position closer in.

Killing a few of these so called "Magmasworn" would be perfect.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* [[Highland Drake: Plated Head]]

==Progress==
Do you have a bodycount for me, <name>?

==Completion==
Great work, <class>. Those monsters deserve every bit of pain you gave them twice over!

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|I will make my way to the bridge at the middle of the garrison. Meet me there when you are done.}}

Valid targets include [[Magmasworn Flameweaver]]s, [[Magmasworn Lavablade]]s, and [[Magmaclaw Raider]]s.

==Progression==
{{Valdrakken, City of Dragons}}
