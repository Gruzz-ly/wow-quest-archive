==Objectives==
Kill 12 Time Slimes.
*Time [[Ooze|Slimes]] slain (12)

==Description==
The investigators here told me that there were some side effects to removing the time anomaly from [[Eon's Fringe]]. Seems a bunch of slimes snuck through the timestream in the process. 

Oh! Oh! Time slimes! They're Time slimes! Ha.

Anyway, could you take some of them out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
There sure are a lot of them...

==Completion==
I recorded the sounds of you killing the slimes for reference. I hope that's okay.

==Notes==
Kill [[Time Slime]]s, [[Half Time Slime]]s, [[Half-Time Slime]]s, and [[Quarter Time Slime]]s.
