==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Invasive Deathblossom]]s and [[Lasher Weedling]]s in [[Gardens of Unity|the Gardens]].
*[[Lasher]]s Slain (10)

==Description==
I'm sure the [[podling]]s aren't the only wildlife acting like hooligans.

[[Alexstrasza]]'s tree has always been a thorn in my side. Her life magic draws all sorts of plants and animals to it, good and bad. And guess who has to take care of the bad ones? Old [[Gryrmpech]], that's who!

Aspects above, I'm getting too old for this.

The stewards aren't trained in combat, so its{{sic}} up to you to take care of the Life-Binder's weed problem.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I don't think my joints would let me walk down those stairs, anyway. Better to let youth handle it.

==Completion==
The elemental problem is more dire than I thought, if you killed that many. Alexstrasza will be happy, at least.

==Progression==
{{Gardens of Unity}}

==Patch changes==
