==Objectives==
Defeat the Primordial Wrath and Primordial Hail in the [[Gelikyr Overlook]].
*[[Primordial Wrath]] slain
*[[Primordial Hail]] slain

==Description==
The fiends in this cave were too much for me.

<Sharnax lets out a labored cough.>

I have seen what you can do.

I need you to slay these [[elemental]]s before they reach their full potential. We cannot allow the [[Primalists]] to take control of [[Tyrhold]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox||Highland Drake: Maned Chin

==Progress==
<Sharnax coughs.>

Is it done?

==Completion==
Thank you for everything you have done for us, <class>.

==Notes==
Inside the cave, kill the three [[Rockguard Cragshaper]]s which makes the Primordial Wrath attackable. The Primordial Hail is not guarded by any mobs.

==Progression==
{{Gelikyr Overlook}}
