==Objectives==
Wear your disguise and use the Prototype "Egg" on the [[Matriarch Avethyra|Matriarch]]'s [[Chef Fry-Aerie|Personal Chef]].
*Put on disguise
*Convince the Screechflight Chef
*Toss Egg into [[Simmering Bluefeather Chunk Stew|Screechflight Cauldron]]
*Knock [[Screechflight Sauciere]] out
*[[Im-PECK-able Screechflight Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
Are you ready to put those acting chops of yours to good use, <name>?

What? You don't have any chops? Then it's a good thing I've made you an im-PECK-able Screechflight disguise out of all the materials you just gathered!

[[Segallia]] and I still need time to finish building [[The Chirpsnide "Egg"|the final "egg"]] that will take out the Matriarch, but I've made a smaller, prototype version for you to try out on the Chef.

And don't worry! You'll be 12% safer from these explosions under all the feathers!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Old [[Monte Gazlowe]] once invited me over and cooked dinner to impress me. To be honest, it smelled a lot like whatever is coming from that cave over there.

==Completion==
You did great and looked pretty good in that outfit to boot!

Finally ready to cut this terrifying threat off at its beak?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Here's your disguise, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|And here's the prototype "egg" you'll use on the Chef.}}
:''Harleen tosses an egg.''
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|I wouldn't drop that if I were you.}}
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Once your disguise is on, get into the cave and convince Fry-Aerie to try the "egg" out for herself. Then we'll move onto the next part of our fowl-proof plan.}}
:{{Text|say|Segallia|Good luck! Please don't eat whatever the Chef is making in there!}}

Use the disguise and enter the nearby cave.
:{{Text|say|Chef Fry-Aerie|Finally! What took you so long with those eggs?!}}

;Speaking with Chef Fry-Aerie
:I SAID NO SECONDS!

:{{Gossip|<Show the "egg" to the Chef.>}}
::A new egg? About time! The Matriarch can only get stronger if you caw-ful Cursewives push every ounce of magic into those Bluefeather nests.

::Toss it in and we'll have a taste.

::{{Gossip|<Nod your head.>}}
:{{Text|say|Chef Fry-Aerie|Move those feathers, sister! It's almost the Matriarch's feeding time!}}

Use the Toss the "Egg" extra action button.

:{{Text|say|Chef Fry-Aerie|Wow! What an aroma! Let's have a little sippy sip, shall we?}}
:{{Text|say|Chef Fry-Aerie|It's a little hard to chew--}}
:''An explosion occurs, and Fry-Aerie drops asleep. Harleen and Segallia enter the cave.''
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Did the prototype work??}}
:{{Text|say|Harleen Chirpsnide|Oh! We should use these feathers. And this hat!}}
:{{Text|say|Segallia|You okay, <name>?! We heard a big thud!}}

;Chef Fry-Aerie gossip
:...zzz...

:I wonder if anyone would visit a [[harpy]]-owned restaurant...

:...zzz...
