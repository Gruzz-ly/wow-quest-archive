'''Dislocated Disc Located''' concludes the "Reforging the Tyr's Guard" questline. In [[patch 10.2]], the storyline continues, beginning with [[Data Recovery]].

==Objectives==
Check in with the [[Tyr's Guard]].
*Speak with [[Travard]] (Optional)
*Speak with [[Nolaki]] (Optional)
*Speak with [[Talthis]] (Optional)
*Speak with [[Hadwin]] (Optional)
*Speak with [[Valunei]]

==Description==
We were successful, <name>, but we barely made it back from our battle with the [[Black Empire]].

[[Eternus]] is still divining the location of the disc, and while she does, I'd like to ask a favor.

I have unwavering faith in my recruits, but...

I am worried about Valunei. I would speak to her, but I don't want it to appear as though I think she has failed us. Talk to her and make sure she's all right.

It may also be a good idea to check in with the rest of Tyr's Guard as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Dragon Isles Drakes: Gilded Armor]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I'm worried about my recruits, but maybe I should be worried about myself.

Reforming the Tyr's Guard has been a kind of catharsis. But I'm worried that it may be too much so.

I was devastated by the loss of my comrades in the Tyr's Guard... I worry that I may be pushing them too hard.

Or myself. I've been at this a long time, <name>. But to see [[Tyr]] alive once more... that gives me purpose.

I just hope wisdom comes with my age, and I do right by my new recruits. And that they all come home.

==Completion==
I'm glad to hear you were able to speak to her. It sounds like she is ready despite what happened.

A lesser person would have not been able to pick themselves up after that, but Valunei is stronger than many of us realize.

As soon as Eternus locates the disc, we will be ready.

==Notes==
;Nolaki
:You ask me if I'm okay? You ask if I'm ready?

:<Name>, did you see what that Black Empire mess did to our Valunei? To my sister in Tyr's Guard?

:Oh, no that cannot stand. That is why we follow the [[Light]] and why we follow Tyr and the [[titan]]s. That scourge has no place here. And if we bring Tyr back, we will bring light to every corner of [[Azeroth]]. There will be no place the [[void]] can hide!

:When Eternus finds the disc, I'll be the first to go after it.

:I raise my shield for the Light. I raise the shield for my brothers and sisters. I raise my shield for Tyr!

;Talthis
:When we first arrived I was paralyzed by what I saw around me--a place that was all void, no light, no trace of the titans' [[order]].

:It was writhing and... squishy.

:<Talthis looks nauseated by the thought.>

:But Valunei was not bothered. She set the beacon. But then she was called away by that... thing.

:She should have kept her mind on the mission. Those were our orders. Still...

:I know she feels awful. I should... speak to her.

;Hadwin
:Nolaki and I didn't realize it, but we had it dead easy. It doesn't seem fair, really. Talthis and Valunei got a hole full of tentacles and Black Empire morass and we got... [[elemental]]s? I'm going to smell like sulfur for ages, but Valunei... I can't imagine what she's going through.

:But I'm okay. In fact, it makes me want to fight harder. That battlefield was in a world untouched by Tyr or the Light's blessing. The only rule was that the fittest survived.

:It made me realize a world without Tyr is a world without justice. And that his justice is worth fighting for.

;Valunei
:Seeing [[Vindicator Iriska|Iriska]] again...

:She was my mentor and like a sister to me. I know that she was an illusion, but having to strike her down...

:I am shaken to my very center. My heart aches. Not just for Iriska, but that I let my guard down. Talthis could have been killed. The beacon could have been destroyed!

:I have always thought my compassion was a strength, but is it a weakness?

:No, Tyr had compassion. It was his strength! I must be more wary.

:The void is treacherous and will come in many forms... But I am ready, <name>. I... will be fine.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Eternus|I almost have it...}}
:{{Text|say|Eternus|The disc... it is in the [[Nighthold]].}}
:{{Text|say|[[Watcher Koranos]]|The Nighthold... Will it then be difficult to recover?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Chromie]]|That depends on when. The Nighthold is in [[Suramar]]--a great and ancient city and the home of the [[Nightborne]].}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nozdormu]]|I sense a presence with the disc. A powerful one.}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|[[Elisande]]. Oh, that could be a problem. She's a powerful master of [[magic]] and would know the disc's power. She may not want to let it go.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|Travard, I would take time to prepare before retrieving the disc. Elisande will be a dangerous foe.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|I will have <name> at my side, but I agree. The Tyr's Guard needs to rest and recover before we face another battle.}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|We'll be ready when you're ready, Travard. We'll get Tyr back!}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Tyr's Guard, before we went to [[Brackenhide Hollow|Brackenhide]], Koranos and I worked to set up a headquarters for our order, just south of here.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|I call it [[Tyr's Rest]]. Follow me there.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|It should be an excellent place to train and prepare for our incursion into Suramar and confrontation with Elisande!}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Of course, you're welcome to join us there, <name>.}}
:''The paladins move away, mount up, and fly away.''

You may follow up on the offer, Tyr's Rest is at {{Co|59.6|63.8|Thaldraszus}}.

:''Travard is overseeing the training of Hadwin and Talthis outside.''
:{{Text|say|Travard|Use the weight of the mace, Hadwin. Let gravity do the work!}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|I know, I know...}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Talthis. Perfect form as always. Please continue.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|Thank you, Captain.}}
:{{Text|emote|Hadwin sighs.}}

;Travard
:<Name>, we had some close calls along the way to getting the disc's location. I credit the fact that we were successful, and that we all made it back, to you.

:Thank you for helping me reforge the Tyr's Guard. We'll be in touch when we're ready to get the disc.

;Hadwin
:I don't know anything about Elisande, but Travard is working us harder than he did at Brackenhide. I think he knows we'll be in for a fight.

;Talthis
:I know of the Nightborne. And I have heard legends about Elisande. I cannot fathom why someone of her power and nobility would do what she did...

:No matter. We need the disc, and we will claim it. For Tyr!

Valunei and Nolaki are inside the building.
:{{Text|say|Valunei|The more I learn about Elisande, the more I wish Travard had chosen someone else.}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|Don't you say that, Valunei. You're the heart of this team. We're gonna do this together!}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|I... thank you, Nolaki. You are right. We will stand together.}}

;Nolaki
:We are learning about Elisande so we can focus on the battle ahead.

:And so Valunei can focus on something other than what she has been through.

;Valunei
:What Elisande did was horrible. And she will be a powerful adversary. But...

:I cannot help but feel sorrow for her. She wanted what was best for her people.
