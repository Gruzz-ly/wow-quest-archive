==Objectives==
Meet [[Investigator Erima]] at the [[Misty Vale]].

==Description==
<Investigator Erima reviews the map.>

It is clear what the X scrawled over the [[Seat of the Aspects]] represents.

But there is also a circle drawn around the Misty Vale. Perhaps this is [[Flightless|the rebels]]' next target? Or a base of operations.

Only one way to find out. Meet me at the Vale.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is definitely a base of operations.

The Misty Vale is crawling with rebels... and [[Primalists]]!

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|The rebels' complaint, as I understand it...}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|Is that they feel displaced since the return of the [[dragon]]s.}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|Expressing discontent is one thing.}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|Aiming to destroy [[Valdrakken]] and its inhabitants is another matter entirely.}}

Fly to the Misty Vale in southwestern Thaldrasuzs.

;On approach
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|Psst. Over here.}}
