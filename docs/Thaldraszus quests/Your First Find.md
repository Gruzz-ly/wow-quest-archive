==Objectives==
Practice excavating on the [[Outdated Geology Textbook]].
* Use Fire Totem to increase heat
* Step through Spontaneous Puddles to lower heat
* Find fully excavated
*[[Archivist's Fire Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
We've got a find on our hands! Looks like this might be one of my books from undergrad. Hah!

Now, your job is to get all that dirt off of it, but you have to be careful. The artifacts we handle are very fragile, and the only thing worse than them staying in the ground is them breaking on the way out.

Empowering your elemental will only get you halfway. You'll need to use your environment to keep things in balance so that it's safe to excavate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|90}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
What do you think? Having fun yet?

==Completion==
There you go! Your first artifact... of a kind anyway.

The stuff we find out in the field is usually more exciting. But at least this one you can keep as a souvenir!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|With your totem, you can tell your elemental to gently burn dust away from the artifact.}}

Roska has new gossip here:
{{book|content=
{{gossip|What should I be doing again?}}

Once we've located an artifact, the real fun begins. We've gotta excavate it!

Excavation is all about keeping the elements in balance so our artifact is stabilized while we dig.

Your totem can push the elements one way--like making fire burn away dust from this book. But if you go too far, you risk damaging the artifact!

Use your environment to help balance things out. The water puddles here are perfect for turning down the temperature. But don't go too far in that direction either. Keep the elements in harmony, and then you can dig!

;Upon empowering your elemental
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|If the heat gets too high, look to your environment to tone it down!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|The key to excavation is keeping conditions balanced.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|These water puddles will beat out that fire, but out in the field you might need dirt, gusts of wind, or even lava!}}

;Upon stepping through the puddles
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|When the elements are balanced, then you can dig safely!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Go on, get excavating!}}

Balance the bar with the totem and puddles, and click on the dig to progress the bar.

;Upon finishing the excavation
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|There's our find! Not too scorched either.}}

==Bug==
*This quest is sometimes [[bug]]ged and the temperature interface will not show, causing the quest to be impossible to complete. One possible workaround is to enable [[War Mode]] and restart the quest.
