==Objectives==
Kill 10 rebels and Primalists.
*Slay [[Flightless|Rebels]] and [[Primalists]] (10)

==Description==
The rebel staging ground... we have been looking for this very place. How fortunate for us that their saboteur's carelessness led us here.

I cannot believe my brethren would stoop to working with the Primalists. We cannot let this stand. Take out the rebels and their Primalist friends before they can cause any further chaos.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I trust these turncoats will pose no threat to you.

==Completion==
You handled yourself well.

These rebels are no slouches.
