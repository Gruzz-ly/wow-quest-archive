==Objectives==
Return to [[Kalecgos]] in the [[Azure Archives]].

==Description==
It is not unusual that [[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]] would have such powerful memories. From what I understand, their deaths were particularly painful. Both slain by [[adventurer]]s.

It breaks my heart to think of Sindragosa enduring death not once, but twice after being raised by the [[Lich King]].

But enough of this old dragon's ramblings. [[Stellagosa]] and I will meet you back at the Azure Archives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 5,950 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*[[Draconic Memorial Stone]]

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>. As you can see, more [[blue dragon]]s have arrived!

Yet... some are still missing. We cannot forget about them.

I will also ensure we find out more information about this strange phenomenon with Malygos and Sindragosa's memories.

==Progression==
{{The Veiled Ossuary}}

*{{Patch 11.2.7|note=Housing decor reward added.}}
