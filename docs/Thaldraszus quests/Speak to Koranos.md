==Description==
The [[titanic watcher|Watchers]] have observed much over the years. Many of them are lost to the vagaries of time, but we still have Koranos.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Koranos has been here since the beginning. If he doesn't have answers, he should be able to point you in the right direction.

==Completion==
The [[Sundered Flame]] won't let us recover these stones without a fight.

==Notes==
For this quest, don't go to [[Watcher Koranos]]'s usual spot atop the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]]! The correct Koranos is at the top of the steps of the bottom of the tower. Speak with him there:
:Hello champion, and welcome to Valdrakken. How may I help you?

:{{gossip|I'm here on behalf of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]. What can you tell me about the sealed [[Titan]] facility near [[Tyrhold]]?}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|A sealed Titan facility? I have no knowledge of this. Perhaps the logs recently restored by the [[blue dragonflight]] hold some answers. Look through those records, and see what can be found.}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|We are watchers, after all.}}

Head to the [[Azure Archives Annex]] in northwest Valdrakken and pull the [[Watcher Log]] off of the shelf next to [[Lillian Brightmoon]] and [[Mr. Biscuits]]. It reads:
:<The watcher log is ancient, but intact. Flipping through it, a page catches your eye.>
:...Tyr emerged from the facility, and immediately turned to the three watchers.
:From each he commanded them to remove the stones atop their staves, and pass them to the draconic denizens at three points across the Dragon Isles. They were never to speak of this place, and upon return were to keep watch until their forms turned to dust.
:<The record continues on the following pages.>
*{{gossip|<Read the first entry.>}}
*{{gossip|<Read the second entry.>}}
*{{gossip|<Read the third entry.>}}
:To the watcher with the stone of Vigilance, he directed them to an outpost in the center of the [[Azure Span]], northeast of the [[Azure Archives]].
:{{gossip|<Read the next entry.>}}
:For the stone of Insight, he guided them to [[Szar Skeleth]], a draconic tower in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].
:{{gossip|<Read the next entry.>}}
:The stone of Judgment found a place in the far north of the Isles, where it [[Veiled Ossuary|rests amongst those dragons that were long dead]].
:With the removal of the stones, the way was closed.
:And so I have kept my silence. The only record of this event is found here, if it stands the test of time.
:<the entries end here>
:{{gossip|<Take the watcher log.>}}

Attempt to exit the annex and [[Scalecommander Sarkareth]] teleports in, stuns all the NPCs in the area with Arcane Stasis, and attacks!

Get him to 50% and he will teleport behind the player, stun them, and pilfer the book!
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|You won't keep the titan's secrets from us!}}
:{{text|say|[[Theldren]]|Sarkareth?! Is nowhere safe?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|The log is ours, and the power of the titans will follow!}}

Return to Naleidea at the Sealed Titan Facility:
:Did you have a question, <name>?

:{{gossip|<Fill her in on the log's contents and the daring attack and theft by Sarkareth.>}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|An attack by the leader of the Sundered Flame in the heart of Valdrakken? Unprecedented! And incredibly risky.}}
:{{text|say|[[Toddy Whiskers]]|And with the log he stole from you, he'll be on the same path as us.}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Agreed. We have no time to waste, <name>.}}
