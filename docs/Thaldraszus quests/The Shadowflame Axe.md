'''The Shadowflame Axe''' begins the questline to acquire [[Fyr'alath the Dreamrender]]. To begin, [[death knight]]s, [[paladin]]s, and [[warrior]]s must loot the shadowflame version of [[Fyr'alath the Dreamrender (shadowflame)]] from [[Fyrakk the Blazing]], the final boss of [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]], and be consumed by the shadowflame. That axe is consumed as well, turning into the item that starts this quest.

==Objectives==
Visit the [[Azerothian Archives]] to find an expert on [[Shadowflame]]

==Description==
The moment you attempted to wield [[Fyrakk]]'s axe, [[Fyr'alath the Dreamrender|Fyr'alath]], its flames consumed you. Clearly the weapon's shadowflame was too intense.

Perhaps you should consult an expert on shadowflame and ancient artifacts. Maybe one of the scholars at the Azerothian Archives can deduce a method for handling it safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I say! What do we have here? How curious!

Wait a minute...

==Progression==
