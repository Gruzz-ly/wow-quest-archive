Ugh... One moment...

My first assignment... Unstable temporal energy seeping into the forest... Affecting the wildlife... Need to assess the impact and collect that [[magic]] for the [[Timewalkers]]...

<[[Siaszerathel|Zera]] shakes her head a moment.>

I was examining a pack of [[vorquin]] when I was attacked by a crazed [[bear]] overflowing with [[time]] magic. It caught me off guard. I barely escaped.

Could you find my missing gear for me, <class>? Uh, you might also have to deal with that bear.

==Completion==
Thank you, for recovering all that valuable equipment <class>.

==Notes==
Head west along the path to find some hostile [[Time-Charged Bear]]s, one of which is guarding the [[Timewalker Notes]]. Inside the cave, the [[Crazed Alpha]] is guarding the [[Timewalker Staff]].
