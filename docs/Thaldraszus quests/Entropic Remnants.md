==Objectives==
Collect 8 Vitrified Sand from creatures in the [[Shifting Sands]].
*[[Vitrified Sand]] (8)

==Description==
When an entity passes through the [[timeway]]s, the [[Sands of Time|sands of time]] can sometimes accumulate on their body.

Typically, this sand dissipates in short order--but sometimes, the entropic fluctuations inherent in [[time travel]] can cause that sand to vitrify. In these cases, it becomes rather difficult to remove. I've ruined several good pairs of shoes this way.

Vitrified sand can be quite powerful for our purposes. It would be in best interest to reclaim as much of it as we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*8,200 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you had any luck? It's usually somewhat rare, but we've been seeing more of it lately.

==Completion==
An unexpectedly large haul. Perhaps those rifts are causing more trouble than we calculated.

==Progression==
{{Big Time Adventurer}}

==Patch changes==
