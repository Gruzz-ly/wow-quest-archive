==Objectives==
Find [[Chromie]] and Complete the Temporal Stabilization Ritual.
*Temporal Position Fixed (0/100%) {{co|53.0|43.2|Black Empire}}
*[[Chrono Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
This... This is the [[Black Empire]]. We have traveled very far into the past, indeed.

Look! I see Ambassador Chronormu and [[Eternus]]! We need to hurry and complete the ritual. 

Even my curiosity is not enough to wish to see where they might travel to next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
That feels much better!

Oh, don't worry about Eternus. We've come to a bit of a truce for the moment.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|So... This is far in the past? Right?}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Yes. From before the [[Titan]]s found [[Azeroth]]. This is when the [[Elemental lord]]s made war on the Black Empire of the [[Old God]]s.}}

Players gain an [[Extra Action Button]] while on this quest and the next:
:{{Abilities|Temporal Displacement|Unleash time magic against nearby enemies while healing and gaining increased haste and speed for a time.|cd=20 sec|id=383031|icon=spell_holy_holynova|notes=2 sec cast. Triggers Celerity, Rewind Damage, and deals 20% of enemies' max health in damage.}}
:*{{Abilities|Celerity|A vestige of the Bronze Dragonflight's power flows through you, increasing movement speed by 15, increasing Haste by 15%, and decreasing cooldowns for 3 min.|id=383032|icon=timelesscoin}}
:*{{Abilities|Rewind Damage|A vestige of the Bronze Dragonflight's power flows through you, healing you over time.|id=383033|icon=ability_evoker_timedilation|notes=12 sec buff that ticks every 2 seconds}}

Don't just run past the enemies - they will aggro and hit... quite hard. Let Dante and Zera help tank them!

As players move towards the north, some one-off whispers come to them:
:{{text|whisper|[[N'Zoth|Knowing Presence]]|I... know you. What you were. What you will yet be.}}
:{{text|whisper|Knowing Presence|You will follow him to the deep places. The dark waters will flow in his wake.}}

Catch up to Chromie and Eternus:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Look! It's Ambassador Chronormu... and Eternus.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|I'm so glad you're here! We're definitely in a bit of a situation.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|An understatement, as usual.}}

Use the Chrono Crystal one last time:
:{{text|say|Chromie|Whew! You did it!}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|I am also relieved not to be stuck with you for an eternity.}}
:''Chromie and Eternus land on the platform, nearly snout to snout.''
