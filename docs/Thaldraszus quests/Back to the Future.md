'''Back to the Future''' is the climax of the [[Thaldraszus storyline]].

==Objectives==
Defend your allies against the [[Black Empire]] until the temporal portal is created.
*Speak with [[Chromie]] (Optional)
*Allies defended (0/100%)
*Check in with Chromie {{co|60.1|82.4|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
We're not going to fall through [[time]] anymore but we're far in the past. Waaaaay far in the past. "The [[Titan]]s Haven't Visited [[Azeroth]] Yet" far in the past. Getting home is going to be... tricky.

But we [[dragon]]s can do it!

We're going to need you to keep those Black Empire minions off our backs though. It shouldn't take too long!

I think.

Probably.

Don't worry about it! Just keep those creepy monsters away and we'll handle the rest! Easy!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Cliffside Wylderdrake]]
* [[Uncanny Pocketwatch]]
* {{cost|82|86|}}
* 15,400 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
This has been an... unexpected turn of events.

==Completion==
Time is stable once more.

==Notes==
Upon reaching Chromie, speak to her:
:This is going to be one doozie of a return spell!

:Are you ready?

:{{gossip|Let's do this!}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|We just need a moment.}}
:{{text|say|[[Eternus]]|Less chatter, more focus.}}
:''The four start channeling a spell.''
:{{text|say|Chromie|And here comes the Black Empire, right on time.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|If only <name> was so timely as well.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|So grumpy!}}

A few waves of enemies start attacking, beginning with [[Winged Ruin]] small fliers, and ending up with a [[Grotesque Bulwark]] [[n'raqi]]. Players still have access to the [[Extra Action Button]] while on this quest:
:{{Abilities|Temporal Displacement|Unleash time magic against nearby enemies while healing and gaining increased haste and speed for a time.|cd=20 sec|id=383031|icon=spell_holy_holynova|notes=2 sec cast. Triggers Celerity, Rewind Damage, and deals 20% of enemies' max health in damage.}}
:*{{Abilities|Celerity|A vestige of the Bronze Dragonflight's power flows through you, increasing movement speed by 15, increasing Haste by 15%, and decreasing cooldowns for 3 min.|id=383032|icon=timelesscoin}}
:*{{Abilities|Rewind Damage|A vestige of the Bronze Dragonflight's power flows through you, healing you over time.|id=383033|icon=ability_evoker_timedilation|notes=12 sec buff that ticks every 2 seconds}}

Finish off the first round of attackers:
:{{text|say|[[Siaszerathel]]|I believe in you, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|[[Andantenormu]]|Use the staff! Remember your training!}}
:{{text|whisper|[[N'Zoth|Knowing Presence]]|With many eyes, they will see again. They will drink, and be uplifted.}}

More enemies come in. Finish off these waves as well:
:{{text|say|Chromie|Keep going, <name>! Just a little bit more!}}
:{{text|whisper|Knowing Presence|Deeper, deeper its roots will reach. Welcoming our embrace.}}
:{{text|whisper|Knowing Presence|Her dreams sing beneath the surface. Our dreams. Our song.}}

A few more. Clear out the last [[Aqir Harbinger]] and an [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|WQQ8S1jjAzc|urlArgs=start=129&end=144}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|We're almost done!}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|We'll be back soon!}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Brace yourselves.}}
:''More aqir move in as the spell finishes. All five characters get portaled back to the present.''

Another in-engine cutscene plays on the other side of the loading screen:
{{#ev:youtube|yrXFgDhEqcM}}<!-- Should be replaced, as this version of the cutscene has a missing Bronze Oathstone bug. -->
:''All five fall out of the sky. The player, with the help of some bronze magic, lands carefully on their feet. The Bronze Oathstone powers up as Nozdormu and Soridormi look on''
:{{text|say|Chromie|Whew! [[Bronze Oathstone|Our Oathstone]]... it's restored!}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|Thank goodness.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|I never want to go so far into the past again!}}
:''[[Nozdormu]] and [[Soridormi]] walk up.''
:{{text|say|Chromie|But I'm glad I had some help getting back!}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|You have aided Chronormu.}}
:''Nozdormu stops in front of Eternus.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|For that, I am grateful and will spare you.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|But leave.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Quickly.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|We will bring you to your ultimate fate.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|You cannot deny what is to come.}}
:''Eternus walks away.''
:{{text|say|Eternus|When we meet again, do not expect clemency for what has transpired.}}
:''She flies off, and exits through a time portal.''

Speak with Chromie:
:Oh! It's you again! Or is it the first time?

:Anyway, hello!

:{{gossip|<Quietly ask Chromie if Nozdormu is okay.>}}

A third in-engine cutscene starts:
{{#ev:youtube|_NIQGlbHkzg}}
:''Nozdormu is looking off in the distance. Chromie runs up to him.''
:{{text|say|Chromie|Nozdormu? Are you okay?}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Eternus nearly succeeded.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I thought I had more time...}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|Oh no! I'm sorry!}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|I thought I was strong enough to defeat her.}}
:''Chromie looks away.''
:{{text|say|Chromie|I... I...}}
:''Nozdormu turns to Chronomu and kneels to get closer to her.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Ah, Chronormu, you have done nothing wrong.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|You fought valiantly and well.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|But Eternus is right.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|My fate is inevitable.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|What do you mean?}}
:''Nozdormu walks to look at an hourglass.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|... Each day that passes the future flows into the present which blurs into the past.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Soon it will merge into one, and that is when I will become my darkest self, Murozond.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|And when that day comes to pass, I look to you...}}
:''He turns back to Chromie.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|To do what must be done.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|Yes, Timeless One.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|I will do exactly what you need me to.}}
:''Chromie bows, then flashes a smile.''
:{{text|say|Chromie|I will find another way.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|There is none.}}
:''Chromie teleports onto a box to gain a few feet.''
:{{text|say|Chromie|Time encompasses all possibilities.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|You taught me that.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|I will search every timeline, every moment,}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|until I find a solution to save you.}}
:''Nozdormu sighs.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Chronormu...}}
:''He walks to Chromie again.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|In all timelines please know.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I am and always have been proud of you.}}
:''The two look at the hourglass.''
