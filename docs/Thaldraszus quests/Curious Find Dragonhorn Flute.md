'''Curious Find: Dragonhorn Flute''' starts from the [[Dragonhorn Flute]], which can randomly be found in one of the tomes awarded for filling a bar during [[The Big Dig: Traitor's Rest]].

==Objectives==
Bring the [[:Dragonhorn Flute]] to [[Eadweard Dalyngrigge]] at the [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]].

==Description==
<This flute is inexpertly hewn out of the horn of a dragon. The cracking around the base suggests the dragon was long gone by the time the flute was made. The mouthpiece is strange. 

It's almost like it isn't designed to be played with the mouth at all but the nose. Could this flute have been crafted by the niffen? Eadweard would know how to preserve this find and figure out whom it might belong to.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|4|50}}
*4,750 [[XP]]
* 100x [[Mysterious Fragment]]
* +100 reputation with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Completion==
Aha! A curious find. I shall reach out to the appropriate parties immediately, and we can have it documented and returned to its home post-haste.

==Notes==
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Oho! Those resourceful little bandits, making use of everything they could find in [[Gaze of Neltharion|that tower]]!}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Including, it would seem, the remains of those unfortunate experiments who made it their grave. How delightfully morbid!}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|The [[Niffen]], of course, have strong artistic and culinary traditions, but you may not know that they have a long history of storytelling as well.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Brigands such as ours would compose epics of their exploits, often accompanied by music and merriment.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|They would even engage in battles of poetics, taking turns composing lyrics to insult the other! And the winner was whomever most damaged the reputation of their opponent.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|This flute is a lovely physical marker of a strong oral tradition! I shall ensure it finds a place of honor in [[Loamm]].}}
