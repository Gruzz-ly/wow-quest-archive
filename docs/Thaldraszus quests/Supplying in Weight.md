==Objectives==
Collect 6 bags of Waywatcher Supplies.
*[[Waywatcher Supplies]] (6)

==Description==
I really screwed up this time. I only stepped away from the campsite for a moment, but I barely returned in time to see the [[tarasek]] snatching up everything I had not bolted down.

Those supplies were expensive, and I can't exactly ask for help getting more! My sister [[Waywatcher Nori|Nori]] thinks I'm inept enough as it is.

If you are sure you want to head through the valley, would you mind keeping an eye out for any stray bags of supplies?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
<Alvi glances in your direction, clearly panicked. The missing supplies seem to be the last thing on her mind at the moment.>

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>, but we have bigger things to worry about now.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Waywatcher Nori|Urgh... Damned Tarasek. Poisoned spears. Glad you're alright, at least.}}
