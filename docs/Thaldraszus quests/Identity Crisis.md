'''Identity Crisis''' begins one of the [[Dark Heart campaign]] chapters added in [[patch 10.2.7]], started by [[Chromie]] at the plaza in [[Valdrakken]] for all level-{{level|df-max}} players. The end reward is the [[Personal Tabard]].

To complete this storyline, many optional storylines involving the characters visited in the final quest of this chain must also be completed. They can be found in the [[Dragon Isles Adventuring: Being Yourself]] article.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Emberthal]] in the [[Victorious Visage]].

==Description==
Hey <name>, over here!

I just finished speaking with Emberthal. I'm not sure what, but something is bothering her!

She had lots of odd questions about [[visage]] forms. Could she be ready to choose one? How exciting! I think I saw her head over to the Victorious Visage.

You should check on her, I bet you could get her to spill the secret!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I take it [[Chromie]] sent you?

==Notes==
Chromie has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
I wish we could throw the [[dracthyr]] their own visage day celebration!

{{Gossip|What was your Visage Day like?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I remember it like it was yesterday!

I was so nervous, I had no idea what kind of visage form I was going to choose. I talked to [[dragon]]s from all over [[Azeroth]]! That was helpful, but none of them spoke true to me.

I realized that it was about how you see yourself. I don't see myself as a great warrior, or hero, or conqueror.

I see myself as someone who wants to help build a brighter future for all of Azeroth!

This just suits me.

{{Gossip|I want to ask about something else.}}
}}}}

Enter The Victorious Visage. Emberthal is accompanied by [[Scalecommander Cindrethresh]] and [[Scalecommander Viridia]].
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|Really? You haven't picked a visage form yet? Do you still not feel ready?}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|This is me. It has always been me. Why do I need another?}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|I think you may be overthinking this, Emberthal.}}
