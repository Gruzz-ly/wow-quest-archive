==Objectives==
Assess the damage done to the ward stones in [[Tyrhold Reservoir]].
*North hall entered
*North ward checked
*East hall entered
*East ward checked

==Description==
This reservoir used to be protected by three warding stones placed by [[Tyr]].

They were meant to stabilize the [[elemental]] [[magic]] that is prevalent in the [[Dragon Isles]].

When you woke me, I sensed damage done to the west ward. I fear the [[Primalists]] may have done this to all of them.

Still, we must assess the damage done in order to figure out what we should do next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
We must find out the extent of the damage done to the warding stones. I can already feel the elemental energy growing out of control.

==Completion==
As I suspected. It is imperative that we find the missing keystones.

Otherwise the losses that [[Zuttiki]] and I have suffered would be for nothing.

==Notes==
Use the dragonriding mount to get to the entrances above. Inside are a [[Rampaging Downpour]] and [[Humid Drizzle]]s. Interact with [[Broken Ward Stone]]s.

:{{Text|say|Zuttiki|No! Surely there must be some... Oh my sisters... I have failed you.}}
:{{Text|say|Mara|Failure would be if we all died. There are still some of us alive.}}
:{{Text|say|Zuttiki|And there are more that are dead.}}

==Progression==
