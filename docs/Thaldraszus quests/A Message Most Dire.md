==Objectives==
Speak with [[Alexstrasza]] at the [[Seat of the Aspects]] within [[Valdrakken]].
*Information delivered

==Description==
[[Kalecgos]] would not speak of what happened in the [[Azure Span]] till you arrived.

Whatever he has to share gives me a terrible sense of foreboding, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Raszageth]]! She is attempting to find them... This is profoundly disturbing news.

We do not know where her [[Primalists]] will be next. Our city must be protected from her chaos.

==Notes==
Speak with Alexstrasza again:
:Life's blessings be with you.

:{{Gossip|quest=|So, about the Azure Span...}}

An in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|TPUTO4KTUdQ}}
:''Alexstrasza, Kalecgos, and [[Nozdormu]] have a conference in their dragon forms with the adventurer standing in the center of the seat.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|We secured the Azure Archives, but Raszageth's storm remains enveloped around [[Vakthros Tower]].}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|She seeks to free her kin, but their prison does not lie within the Azure Span.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|What else could she be after?}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|My vision... remains clouded.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|The Primalists could already be moving in our midst, and I fear I would not see it.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|The city must be protected.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Valdrakken is our people's home.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|If the Primalists are here, we must find them and flush them out.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|They cannot be allowed to infiltrate our seat of power.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Alexstrasza|Allow me to introduce you to [[Captain Drine]], she oversees security here in Valdrakken.}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Drine|The [[Scalesworn]] of Valdrakken stand ready.}}
:''Drine runs in and offers the next two quests.''
