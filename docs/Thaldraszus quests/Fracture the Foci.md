==Objectives==
Destroy 4 Primalist Foci in [[Emberslate Cavern]].
*Destroy [[Primalist Focus|Primal Foci]] (4)

==Description==
If [[Maldra Flametongue|Maldra]] speaks the truth, [[Flightless|the rebels]] are creating the runestones in the Emberslate Cavern.

Given the nature of these devices, we know there must be [[Primalists|Primalist]] foci involved.

Destroy the foci. You will know them when you see them.

The rebels cannot be allowed to create any more weapons of destruction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I cannot follow you into the cave, but I trust you have the task well in hand.

==Completion==
Without those foci, the rebels will no longer be able to imbue their runestones with explosive flame.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|They would not think twice about harming innocents.}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|You should not hesitate to eliminate them.}}

Head inside the cave past the fire wall and interact with the foci to destroy them.
