==Objectives==
Locate [[Alexstrasza]].

==Description==
We've come so close to recovering our powers... should [[Raszageth]] succeed before our powers return, I fear that the timeways will bend to a dark future for all of [[Azeroth]].

We must not allow this to occur, <name>!

Hurry, you must find and aid Alexstrasza before all is lost!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Razageth{{sic}} and her allies must be stopped!

==Notes==
Fly further east to the [[Vault of the Incarnates]], where Alexstrasza is looking at the instance line.

==Progression==
{{The Mother Oathstone}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
