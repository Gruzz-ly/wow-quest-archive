==Objectives==
Learn to use the Technoscryers.
* Meet Zenata outside
* Put on the Goggles
* Auto-Adjuster activated
* Scrying Mode Activated
* [[Technoscryers]] (provided)

==Description==
Through a near-perfect blend of [[technology]] and [[arcane]] enchantment, I have developed a way to analyze the [[psychometric]] properties of objects. Wearing these goggles, you can see the data as dynamic simulacra!

Simple, yes? I call it... the Psychometric Visuo-Auditory Discrete Waveform Analysis and Viewing Device! For the layperson, we're calling them "Technoscryers." Trademark and patent pending.

Here, try them on!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|21|6|75}}
* 7,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have given you the Technoscryers. Please! Put them on!

==Completion==
Well done!

I admit, the bar for putting on a pair of goggles is super low, but still! You did it!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Zenata|Let us go outside! We will need some space for my demonstration.}}
:''She runs outside.''

Catch up with her:
:{{text|say|Zenata|Excellent. Now put... the goggles... on! They will automatically adjust to the shape of your head.}}

Putting on the goggles:
:{{text|say|Zenata|Easy, right? And so comfortable! Feel that padding? It is all custom made.}}
:{{text|say|Zenata|Now for some Auto-Adjusting... tap that button to fine-tune fit and focus.}}

After adjusting the Technoscryers with [[Auto Adjusting...]]:
:{{text|say|Zenata|Careful, my friend! Are you feeling unsteady? This is still a prototype.}}
:{{text|say|Zenata|Okay, now activate the Scrying mode. Then you will find the item we are searching for...}}

After activating [[Scrying Mode]]:
:{{text|say|Zenata|Perfect! You should be able to see a readout near the bottom. That will shows{{sic|Remove if transcript error.}} you how close you are to the relic.}}
:{{text|say|Zenata|The device still needs to be attuned, so it won't detect anything yet.}}
:{{text|say|Zenata|And those are the basics! Now remove the goggles by tapping the button on the side. A child could do it! So can you!}}
