==Objectives==
Kill 6 Primalist Infiltrators within [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Primalist Infiltrator]] slain (6)
*[[Revealing Dragon's Eye]] (provided)

==Description==
Welcome to Valdrakken, <race>.<br><!-- this is deliberate, to match the in-game appearance -->
The climate in the city has been a bit warm of late, and I do not mean the weather.

The [[Primalists]] are skulking about, fomenting dissent among the citizens of our city.

Our foes are crafty. They have been disguising themselves as citizens of our city to hide from the [[Scalesworn]]. They know how to avoid my guards but will not suspect an outsider.

Take this Dragon's Eye gem, it should help you see through their disguises.

Go reveal and kill these infiltrators!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,250 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of our infiltrator problem?

==Completion==
Good. Let this serve as a notice that the Primalists will never be welcome in Valdrakken!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|Root out any Primalist that dare infest our city!}}

Use the provided [[Revealing Dragon's Eye]] before leaving the seat, then keep an eye out for glowing Valdrakken Citizens. Speak with one, where they can say one of:
*What?
*Hello, friend. Did you also get turned out of your home by the return of the "masters"?
*Who maintained these isles over the eons? We did! And what do we get for it? Nothing!

:{{gossip|Halt! I see through your disguise!}}
Any nearby [[Primalist Infiltrator]]s will shed their disguise:
*{{text|say|Primalist Infiltrator|You cannot stop our cause!}}
*{{text|say|Primalist Infiltrator|You are but a pawn to the Aspects!}}
*{{text|say|Primalist Infiltrator|The jig is up! Get off me you knuckleheads!}} (three goblins in a "trenchcoat" hop off and attack!)
*{{Text|say|Primalist Infiltrator|Wake up and see the truth!}}
*{{Text|say|Primalist Infiltrator|We will find the stone!}}

The Revealing Dragon Eye can only see through disguises at short range (under 20 yards or so), so explore on foot, not from the air.

Turn in at the base of the tower, not up top.

==Progression==
{{Valdrakken, City of Dragons}}
