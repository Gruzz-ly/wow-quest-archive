==Objectives==
Discuss [[Flightless|the rebels]]' grievances with Alexstrasza.
*Share your perspective with [[Alexstrasza]]

==Description==
That was enlightening, to say the least. The rebels we talked to had a lot to say which I wouldn't have anticipated.

I have my thoughts on the situation, but what did you think of their grievances?

As neither a [[dragon]] nor [[dragonkin]], you bring a certain objectivity to the matter. ''(non-dracthyr)'' / The dracthyr have been victims of our worst excesses. Do the rebels' claims resonate with you? ''([[Dracthyr (playable)|Dracthyr]] only)''

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 51,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Is there merit to what the dragonkin say, or only dereliction of duty?

==Completion==
I will consider your advice. Thank you again, <name>, for your aid.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Alexstrasza
:Do you think the dragonkin grievances are legitimate, <name>?

:{{Gossip|<Tell Alexstrasza that the dragonkin were made to serve the dragons and need to keep doing so.>}}

:{{Gossip|<Tell Alexstrasza the dragonkin have been unfairly treated.>}}

:{{Gossip|<Tell Alexstrasza some complaints make sense, but they still need to know their place.>}}

::Yes, I can definitely see your perspective. And what do you think of their claims to be equal with dragons?

::{{Gossip|<Tell Alexstrasza that while the dragonkin don't have equal abilities, they think and feel, just as dragons do, and deserve the same rights and respect.>}}

::{{Gossip|<Tell Alexstrasza the dragonkin are residents of the [[Dragon Isles]] just like her, so they deserve better treatment than they have received.>}}

::{{Gossip|<Tell Alexstrasza the dragonkin can't fly and aren't immortal. They're not equal in any sense.>}}

:::Thank you for your insight. What do you feel is the right way to resolve the situation with the rebels?

:::{{Gossip|<Tell Alexstrasza you would offer the rebels their freedom and treat them as equals, then invite them to work with [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]] if they choose.>}}

:::{{Gossip|<Tell Alexstrasza an occasional dragonkin [[holiday]] will smooth things over.>}}

:::{{Gossip|<Tell Alexstrasza the clear solution is to crush the rebels with force.>}}

:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I'm tired of this rebellion too, <name>. But it is hard to imagine a good outcome if we keep turning a blind eye to their concerns. We have tried to defeat the rebels, and things have only escalated. We should not keep trying what has only failed so far.}}

:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You are right, we have treated the dragonkin as beneath us. And our treatment of them should not be based on our power or their position. It should be rooted in who we choose to be. Thank you, <name>, this makes the path forward clear.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|[[Captain Drine]]|[[Maldra Flametongue|Maldra]] has deciphered a rebel code in the propaganda you found, <name>. Let's put a stop to [[Instigator Belaphon|Belaphon]]'s incitement!}}
