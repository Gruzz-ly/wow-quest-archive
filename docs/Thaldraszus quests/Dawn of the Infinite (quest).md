'''Dawn of the Infinite''' begins the storyline to unlock the [[Dawn of the Infinite]] megadungeon added in [[patch 10.1.5]]. Check in with [[Nozdormu]] atop the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Meet Nozdormu at Eon's Fringe in [[Thaldraszus]].
*Meet [[Nozdormu]] at [[Eon's Fringe]]
*Speak to [[Future Chromie|Chromie]] at Eon's Fringe in Thaldraszus.

==Description==
My vision is hazy, but there is no mistaking what I saw. A dark alliance opposes the [[bronze dragonflight]]. One I do not know if I shall be able to overcome...

I ask you to meet me in Eon's Fringe, <name>. We will speak more of this threat there. If there is any who I would entrust with safeguarding our future, it is you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|7|2|25}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yes, it is I! [[Chromie]] from the future! Nice to meet you. Again.

Now, I can't talk too much about when I'm from or why I'm here. Protecting the [[timeway]]s and all that, you understand. But I know exactly what's going to happen and exactly how to stop it!

==Notes==
Head to [[Eon's Fringe]] near the [[Ancient Waygate]]. Eon's Fringe is no longer under the time anomaly and is not constantly dealing damage. On a platform above the waygate:
:''[[Future Chromie]] teleports in using bronze magic.''
:{{Text|say|Future Chromie|Oh, there you are! Here to see Nozdormu, right?}}
:{{Text|say|Future Chromie|Lucky for you, I'm here to help solve everything! As usual.}}

Future Chromie has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Nozdormu told you about some big, scary something-or-other that opposes him, right? Well I know how to fix the problem before it even starts!
}}
