==Objectives==
Meet Chromie and [[Eternus]] in Tyrhold.
* Meet [[Chromie]] in [[Tyrhold]]

==Description==
Now, let's get to work tracking down the disc. I can't believe that after thousands of years we are so close to seeing [[Tyr]] return, much less that I will have a hand in it.

We should meet with Chromie and Eternus inside. They'll tell us what to do next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
You're back just in time, <name>! We've determined where the [[Tyr's Guard]] needs to place the beacons. Check in with Eternus, and we're ready when you are!

==Notes==
Approach Chromie:
:{{Text|say|Chromie|<Name>! Travard! You're back! And just in time. Eternus and [[Nozdormu]] are ready to track Tyr's disc!}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|Yes. In your absence, Eternus and I have used the [[:Silver Scale]] and [[Infinite dragonflight|infinite]] [[magic]] to track the disc's fall through the [[timeways]].}}
:{{Text|say|Eternus|Each portal is a gateway to a timeway relevant to Tyr: a time of his victory, a time of his defeat, and a time bereft of his influence.}}
:{{Text|say|Eternus|Taking a beacon and placing one at each of these moments in time and space will show us where Tyr's disc rests.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|I will leave that to you, <name>, and the Tyr's Guard. Take the beacons and find the location of Tyr's disc.}}
