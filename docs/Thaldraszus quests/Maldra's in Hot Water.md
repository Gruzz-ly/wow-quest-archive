==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Orian Darkwater.png|Orian Darkwater|This rebel leader has shackled his captive, [[Maldra Flametongue]], with binding chains of primal water.}}
Rescue Maldra from Orian Darkwater.
*[[Orian Darkwater]] slain

==Description==
Excellent work. While you were off disrupting things I was scouting the camp. I did not expect to find my old friend Maldra Flametongue.

I knew she was missing, but rumors said she had joined [[Flightless|the rebels]]. From what I could see, though, she is their captive!

We cannot leave her here. Rescue her from the dragonspawn holding her captive!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 24,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Maldra is a dear friend. We cannot leave her here with these rebels!

==Completion==
I am indebted to you for rescuing my friend.
