==Objectives==
Take the pocket watch to [[Orizmu]] in [[Gardens of Unity|the Gardens]].
*Let [[Lord Basilton|Basilton]] sniff your hand
*Take the pocket watch to Orizmu in the Gardens

==Description==
Oh yeah, this pocket watch belongs to one of the stewards that help me tend to the gardens. 

He's one of [[Nozdormu]]'s. [[Orizmu]], I think? I can't keep all these kids straight. Most days he stands next to that hourglass near [[Alexstrasza]]'s tree without moving. Or blinking.

Nozdormu's bunch have always been strange, if you ask me. But, he'll be grateful you brought this to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Walking all the way down to the sundial is too much effort for my old bones.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Nozdormu will be pleased to have this returned.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lord Basilton|Squeak!!!}}
:{{text|say|Gryrmpech|Ha ha! Wow, just mentioning the word "gardens" has him excited!}}
:{{text|say|Gryrmpech|You want to go with <name>, spiky boy? I bet you do!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Basilton|Squeak squeak!!}}
:{{text|say|Gryrmpech|Let him sniff your hand, so he knows who to follow.}}

Interact with [[Lord Basilton]] and he will follow the player, then head northeast along the path to Orizmu, by the bronze hourglass.

==Progression==
{{Gardens of Unity}}
