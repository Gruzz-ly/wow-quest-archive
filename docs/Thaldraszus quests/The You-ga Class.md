*[[Terrorized Spa Guest|Youga Students]] Rescued (6)
*[[Fleur Starling|Youga Instructor]] Rescued{{Co|41.16|47.49|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
Everything was going so well, but now? [[Elemental]]s are causing some, um, mild challenges.

Our guests were enjoying the facilities when suddenly, all these elementals appeared! Those nasty fiends have disrupted everything. Probably even the new you-ga instructor.

Oh yes, you-ga is a new type of stretching that helps you meditate at the same time. I am sure both teacher and students are so relaxed they do not even notice the elementals.

Still, better to be safe than sorry. Please, look for them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you found anyone? Check around the you-ga area below us!

==Completion==
Hopefully this experience won't tarnish their reviews!
