'''The Flow of Time''' begins the "Time Management" chapter of the [[Thaldraszus storyline]].

==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Shifting Sands]] and speak with [[Chromie]].
*Speak with Chromie

==Description==
The threads of [[time]] flow like a river, with many bends and branches. Occasionally, those flows can be changed. However, any anomaly left unresolved may doom our destiny to a false timeline.

We are quickly approaching one of those anomalies. I have sent Chronormu to the Shifting Sands to investigate and correct any issues to the one true timeline.

I foresee that your assistance will be invaluable.

Please lend us your aid and meet with Chronormu.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did Nozdormu send help?

==Completion==
Hello! ... again? I think?

==Notes==
Pre-accept:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I require a moment of your time, hero. I promise it shall not be wasted.}}

Speak with Chromie:
:Oh! It's you again! Or is it the first time?

:Anyway, hello!

:{{gossip|Nozdormu sent me to help.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|Thank goodness you're here, <name>. The [[timeway]]s are in chaos! We'll need as much help as we can get to fix 'em.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|An [[Infinite dragon|Infinite Dragon]] is trying to corrupt our [[Bronze Oathstone]] in the [[Temporal Conflux]]. That stone embodies our calling to protect all time.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|If corrupted, anything could happen! Including... oh no! [[Murozond]]!}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|We can't let that [[Infinite dragonflight|Infinite]] turn Nozdormu into his awful, dark, alternate self. I'm going to go try and hold her off, you help [[Andantenormu|Dante]] sort things out down here!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Chromie|There's nothing the [[Timewalkers]] can't fix!}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Except, some of our ranks are missing.}}
