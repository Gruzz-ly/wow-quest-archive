==Objectives==
Receive [[Maldra Flametongue|Maldra]]'s elemental blessing.
*Begin the Ritual
*Complete the Ritual

==Description==	
[[Flightless|The rebels]] inside the cavern have been imbued with an [[elemental]] blessing, allowing them to safely pass through the wall of flame. I can grant you that same boon.

Do not worry; I have seen the blessing granted many times. It shouldn't be any problem to recreate it effectively.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How do you feel?

==Completion==
Worry not. That chilly, damp feeling is temporary.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|Normally [[Orian Darkwater|Orian]] handled these blessings.}}
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|But I understand the general concept.}}

Enter the circle and the Attune with Fallingwater extra action button appears.
