==Objectives==
After completing a Time Rift, return to [[Soridormi]] in the [[Tyrhold Reservoir]].
*Complete a [[Time Rift]]
*[[A Fish]] (provided)

==Description==
Murglgalgul!

Glulmual, rluu glua ffrl wawawamual. Lalala!

Mowua ha mwaaay.

<Murloc You raises a fish up in both of <his/her:their> hands towards you. It seems very officious. Soridormi may want to see this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 50x [[Paracausal Flakes]]
* +100 reputation with [[Soridormi (faction)|Soridormi]]

==Completion==
<Soridormi looks at you flatly as you hand her the fish.>

A fish. Why thank you, <name>, I did not think you cared.



I will put the fish with the other items, after temporally locking it.

Remember this for later: I do not enjoy the smell of rotting fish.

==Notes==
Keep an eye out for [[Murloc You]] during an [[Azmerloth]] invasion of [[Time Rifts]].

This is one of the criteria of [[Temporal Acquisitions Specialist]].
