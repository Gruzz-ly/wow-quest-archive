==Objectives==
Collect fish to restock the fishing hole and mount your drake to drop them from above.
*Collect Stock Fish (3)
*Drop the fish from above (3)
*[[Throw Net]] (provided)

==Description==
The fish could be biting better, don't you think?

You know, that gives me an idea. Legend says these lakes and rivers did not always have fish. They say, these watering holes were stocked with fish when the [[dragon]]s soaring overhead dropped them! Can you believe it?

Maybe you and your drake could give it a try?

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Restock Fish|id=386887|Increases the remaining stock of fish by 20.|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Have you dropped those fish yet?

==Completion==
Ha! The legends are true, how fantastic!

==Patch changes==
