==Objectives==
Bring the Screechflight Scroll to [[Harleen Chirpsnide]] in the [[Bluefeather Cliffs]].
*[[Screechflight Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
<You pull a scrap of parchment from the gooey, blood-soaked satchel of the [[Hawthia Roc-Muncher|Roc-Muncher]]. All you can make out is imagery of [[Harpy|harpies]] devouring large eggs.

You're positive the thick, unintelligible scratch marks will make plenty of sense to your favorite senior ornithologist, Harleen Chirpsnide.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|81}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Back from the caves already?

==Completion==
Ho, now! That's certainly no dinner menu you're holding!

Or maybe it is...

==Notes==
[[Screechflight Scroll]] drops from [[Hawthia Roc-Muncher]], the objective of [[A Roc-ing Appetite]]. Completing this quest unlocks a new gossip option with Harleen Chirpsnide.
