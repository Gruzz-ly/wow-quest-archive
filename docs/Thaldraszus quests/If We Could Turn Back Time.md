==Objectives==
Close the Time Rifts in the [[Shifting Sands]] with [[Siaszerathel]].
*First rift closed {{co|58.6|78.2|Thaldraszus}}
*Zera observed {{co|59.8|79.3|Thaldraszus}}
*Second rift closed {{co|60.0|79.3|Thaldraszus}}
*Third rift closed {{co|60.0|77.2|Thaldraszus}}
*[[Aeonormu|Stranger]] met {{co|59.9|77.2|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
A proper [[Timewalkers|Timewalker]] never leaves a crisis half-resolved. Why wait and study when we have the tools we need already?

Since you have my original staff, I found a spare for me to use. I am sure no one will miss it. This is my plan, we team up on those rifts together and save the day! All the days, really. Sorry, I still get confused about the time stuff.

What do you say? The task should be simple enough, right?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
We did it! Right?

Okay maybe there was a wrinkle or two--nothing [[Andantenormu|Dante]] needs to know about. Also, an unexpected visitor..{{sic}}

Still, overall I would say that went pretty well.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Let me head to the rifts first. See you there!}}

Head northeast to find the first [[Time Rift (Thaldraszus)|Time Rift]], where Siaszerathel is channeling a spell into it:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|This should be easy!}}

Interact with the Time Rift:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Not bad! Let me handle the next one by myself!}}
:''Siaszerathel runs off.''

Find Zera at the southeast corner of the quest area:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|The energy from this rift feels... primordial.}}

Speak with her:
:Ready to watch future master Timewalker in action?

:{{gossip|Show me what you got.}}
:''A [[Murloc Ambusher]] pops out of the bushes just in front of her. She pushes it through the portal.''
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Oh! This is not good...}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Maybe you should handle this.}}

Interact with the second Time Rift:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|I think a murloc just merged into that timeline...}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Do we really need to tell Dante? It will be fine!}}
:''Zera runs off to the north.''

Catch up with her at the northeast corner of the quest area:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Uh... you can close this one.}}

Interact with it and [[Aeonormu]] pops out:
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|What is it now?}}
:{{text|say|Aeonormu|Ugh... when am I?}}

Speak with him:
:Which timeline is this? When are we?

:{{gossip|Are you one of the Timewalkers?}}
::Did you say the Timewalkers? They are here?

::{{gossip|Zera could lead you to them.}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Why were you inside that time rift?}}
:''Zera and Aeonormu start running back to camp.''
:{{text|say|Aeonormu|It is a long story...}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Dante is going to love this.}}
