==Objectives==
Control a Siege Scorpion and then use it to clear the skies of [[Magmasworn Trueborn]].
*[[Siege Scorpion]] controlled {{co|40.9|83.9|Thaldraszus}}
*Magmasworn slain (0/100%)
*Meet up with [[Guardian Velomir]] upon the lookout tower at [[South Hold Gate]].

==Description==
You did well to gather those spears and rope. With them, we can ensure those haughty [[Primalists]] will no longer rule the skies!

There is a platform up the stairway with several Siege Scorpions. If you use the rope to string their bows and use the spears as ammunition, you should be able to strike the Magmasworn's dragons in the air!

Once cleared, the path up the spire will be safe and we can continue our search for [[Commander Eranog]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Highland Drake: Hooked Horns]]
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! That should take some heat off us. 

Keep your weapon in hand though, we are not done yet.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|Keep the Primalists busy while I search further up the tower for the commander.}}
:''Velomir runs off.''

Run up the stairs to the east to find some [[Siege Scorpion]] baliistae. Hop in one to enter the vehicle interface with one ability:
#{{Abilities|Siege Bolt|Launch a projectile that deals moderate damage to the first enemy hit.|id=383745|icon=hunter_pvp_snipershot|range=300|notes=Instant}}

The air is full of [[Magmasworn Trueborn]]. Each bolt strike takes off half the protodrake's health, and seven drakes are required. Take them out! 

Head just to the southwest to find Velomir, inside the tower:
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|Over here! I think I found Commander Eranog!}}

==Progression==
{{Valdrakken, City of Dragons}}
