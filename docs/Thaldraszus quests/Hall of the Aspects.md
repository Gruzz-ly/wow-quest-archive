==Description==
The Hall of the Aspects, eh? Why would [[Tyr]] seal something like this away? Was he hidin' something?

The implications are staggering--hopefully we'll find some answers in there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's pop through that transporter before Naleidea gets cold feet!

==Completion==
I don't care what [[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]] says, I knew ye were the right choice from the beginning.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|And while we're exploring, we should find a way tae get this barrier down.}}

Back toward the entrance are the Hall of Samples Teleporter and Hall of Aspects Teleporter. Take the Aspects teleporter for this quest to enter the [[Hall of Aspects]]:
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Wow! Can ye believe this place!?}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|I bet the family whiskers that we can learn something if I have some quality time with those consoles!}}
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Those constructs do NOT look friendly, Toddy.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Don't worry, Naleidea. I have <name> to watch my back!}}

Speak with Toddy:
:Keep an eye out while I'm working, all right?

:{{gossip|Right. I'll watch your back.}}
:{{Text|say|If we make it through this, I'll buy you a pint.}}

Toddy runs from console to console, spawning a [[Security Construct]] at each one:
:{{text|say|[[Security Console]]|WARNING... UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY DETECTED... SECURITY SYSTEM ONLINE... DEFENSES ACTIVATING...}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|I can't make heads or tails of these records. They're as convoluted as those time travelin' bronze dragons!}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Interesting--Alexstrasza and Ysera were clutchmates! They had a brother, but... it seems he fell some time before the Aspects were created.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Looks like Ysera was always the gentle one. Says here she thought peace could be made with the undead. Odd... none of our history mentions the dragons fightin' undead.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|It says here that before Malygos became an Aspect, he almost succumbed to undeath! That doesn't make any sense--what undeath are they talking about?}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Huh! Neltharion used to be one of Alexstrasza's closest friends and confidants. ...it must have broken her heart tae see him fall tae madness.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Ah ha! I knew the barrier override would be on one of these.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Press that final button and let's get out of here.}}
:''Toddy runs to the Security Console.''

Activate it:
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|You're a natural! If this adventuring thing doesn't work out for ye, I can set ye up with a career in data entry.}}

==Progression==
{{In the Halls of Titans}}
