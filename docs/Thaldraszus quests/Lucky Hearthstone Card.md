{{questportrait|Enchanted Card Swarm.jpg|Enchanted Card Swarm|A collection of Hearthstone cards enchanted by mischievous whelps into a "card tornado" formation.}}
==Objectives==
Kill the Enchanted Card Swarm and retrieve Anduin's Lucky Hearthstone Card.
*[[Enchanted Card Swarm]] slain
*[[Anduin's Lucky Hearthstone Card]]

==Description==
I was playing [[Hearthstone (game)#Lore|Hearthstone]] with [[Varian Wrynn|my father]] when I somehow ended up here. Then some [[dragon whelp]]s flew off with my lucky card to add it to their... card tornado?

Then all the adults started saying I need to go home. But I can't leave without my lucky card!

Can you please help me? I promise I'll go home if you bring it back for me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*30x [[Soridormi's Recognition]]
*70x [[Paracausal Flakes]]

==Progress==
I feel a little better. [[Bartender Bob|Bob]] gave me [[Anduin's Juice|some juice]]. But I still don't know what's going on.

Where is this place? How did I get here?

==Completion==
You actually got my lucky card back? Thank you, thank you, thank you <name>!

I'll remember this forever. I'm ready to go home now.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Bartender Bob|Don't worry, kiddo. <Name> will have your card back in no time! Want to play a round while we wait?}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I guess... But I won't win without my lucky card...}}

Head to [[Algeth'ar Academy]] and find the swarm at {{co|58.36|37.12|Thaldraszus}}. During the fight, it summons [[Truesilver Champion (mob)|Truesilver Champions]].
