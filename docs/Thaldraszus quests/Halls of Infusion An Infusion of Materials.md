==Objectives==
Retrieve 10 Ancient Titansteel Ingots and defeat the Primal Tsunami in the [[Halls of Infusion]].
*[[Ancient Titansteel Ingot]] (10)
*Defeat the [[Primal Tsunami]]

==Description==
<The image of [[Tyr]] speaks again.>

You have reactivated the forge. The next task will not be as simple.

Transcribed within [[Silver Scale|the scale]] are schematics for something I require you to forge. I have entrusted one of my [[Titan watcher|watchers]], [[Irideus]], with the necessary materials for this task. They are of special origin, and only few of them are left in existence.

Seek Irideus within the Halls of Infusion, where I hope his careful watch has kept the facility operating in an orderly fashion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Once you have retrieved the required materials you will be able to proceed.

==Completion==
I trust everything was in order within the Halls of Infusion and that Irideus is doing well.

Now for the next task.

==Notes==
Kill [[Watcher Irideus]] in the [[Halls of Infusion]] on any difficulty. He will drop all 10 [[Ancient Titansteel Ingot]]. Then defeat the final boss of the dungeon.

==Progression==
{{The Silver Purpose}}
