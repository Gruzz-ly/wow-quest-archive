==Objectives==
Challenge 8 [[dracthyr]] to a game of [[Hearthstone (game)#Lore|Hearthstone]].
*Talk to [[Dracthyr Freshscale|Freshscales]] about Hearthstone (8)

==Description==
With my deck back, I can focus on recruiting new members to my club! I was thinking about asking the dracthyr...

Oh, that is another thing you can help me out with, <name>!

I am going to be a bit busy trying to get other [[dragon]]s to join and I really want to get the dracthyr involved.

Do you mind talking to them for me? Be warned; many of them have never played before.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
How is the recruiting going?

==Completion==
Wonderful! Thanks so much for all your help <name>! With the new interest in Hearthstone I am sure we will get approval for the club!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|Remember, dracthyr do not have any experience with Hearthstone so their reactions may be different than you are expecting.}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|And thanks again for helping me with this!}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|I am going to go talk with the professor, come meet me when you are done!}}

;Speaking with the Dracthyr Freshscales
*Hey! Do you know what game everyone is obsessing over?
*I really wish we had more clubs here on campus. Something to take my mind away from the anxiety of finals, you know?
*Make it quick, new kid. I'm busy.
*Have you met Setagosa yet? I love her style! It's so... edgy!
*Huh... what do you want?

:{{Gossip|<Challenge to a Hearthstone game.>}}
(First response)
*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|What! A new card game came out?!}}
*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|Of course! Are games not the pinnacle of wit and wisdom?}}

(Second response)
*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|I need to go show my friends!}}
*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|Let me run home to feed my pet slyvern, then I'll be free all afternoon!}}

*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|Did you say Battle?}}
*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|It is time to duel? Alright!}}
:''The dracthyr attacks.''
*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|Ohhhh, you meant in a card game!}}
*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|Wait... Duel doesn't always mean actual fighting?}}

*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|I just learned about hearthstones!}}
:''The dracthyr uses a hearthstone and teleports away.''

*{{Text|say|Dracthyr Freshscale|I have been looking for a way to meet new people! It is not expensive, right?}}

;Upon completion
:''Professor Dromokdormi changes to her visage.''
:{{Text|say|Professor Dromokdormi|Everything appears to be in order, Yumadormu! I will be happy to be the faculty advisor for your club!}}
:{{Text|say|Setogosa|Wait! I do not see why he should get approval for making this Hearthstone club. He is not even good at the game.}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|Seto! Why are you always so demeaning?!?}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|That is it! I challenge you to a duel!}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|If I win you leave me alone, if you win I will never play Hearthstone again.}}
:{{Text|say|Professor Dromokdormi|Yumadormu I think that is a little extreme...}}
:{{Text|say|Setogosa|Fine. Let us get this over with. I do not expect it to take very long.}}
:''Setogosa and Yumadormu enter the [[Algeth'ar Tower]].''
