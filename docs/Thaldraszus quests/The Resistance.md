==Objectives==
After completing a Time Rift, return to [[Soridormi]] in the [[Tyrhold Reservoir]].
*Complete a [[Time Rift]]
*[[Map to Suramar]] (provided)

==Description==
<The person in front of you is clearly an uncorrupted [[night elf]], albeit significantly more feral and malnourished than usual.>

Nice world. No [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. No [[fel]].

If you can, send help. [[Suramar]], ask for [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]].

<Soridormi may want to see this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 50x [[Paracausal Flakes]]
* +100 reputation with [[Soridormi (faction)|Soridormi]]

==Completion==
<Soridormi looks at you in a perplexed manner as you hand her a map to Suramar. Her expression changes as you explain the circumstances.>

Incredible. This world has been under the rule of the Legion for ten thousand years, yet still there is a resistance. 

I wish we could help them, but we cannot interfere with another timeway.

A horrible answer, I know.

==Notes==
While killing enemies during an [[Azewrath]] invasion during [[Time Rifts]], keep an eye out for [[Ellemayne (NPC)|Ellemayne]], who starts this quest.

This is one of the criteria of [[Temporal Acquisitions Specialist]].

==Progression==
