==Objectives==
Meet [[Roska Rocktooth]] at the [[Gaze of Neltharion]] in [[Zaralek Cavern]].

==Description==
A [[Niffen]] colleague of mine gave me the underground info about an underground tower. It's decrepit and smack-dab in the middle of Zaralek between [[Loamm]], the [[Djaradin]], and that ghastly lab of [[Neltharion|Neltharion's]]. 

Grab your favorite shovel and meet me there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Let's do as the Niffen do and sniff out these hidden histories.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Catch you at the site!}}

At the excavation site, Roska has new gossip:
{{book|content=
{{gossip|What can you tell me about the history of this place?}}

﻿When the black dragonflight moved out, this place was abandoned. It had a reputation for being haunted by all the experiments they left behind.

The locals steered clear, which is why it as the perfect hideout for a bunch of niffen bandits. They'd rob travellers on the road then retreat back here where no one would follow.

Who knows if they left any treasure behind, but they definitely left behind lots of trash! Broken pots, scraps of cloth, animal bones. They turned this whole place into a midden.

But there's a lot to be learned from trash, if you know where to dig!

{{gossip|What can you tell me about the geology of this place?}}

We're only a couple feet up from the magma, so watch your step and don't dig too deep!

Aside from the heat, it makes for excellent excavating. All it takes is a little quake to liquefy the stone, and the finds rise to the surface.

The midden here is the more interesting part. After many decades, the build-up of trash becomes part of the landscape.

We can learn a lot about what they ate, what they wore, when times were plentiful and when they were hard just by reading the laminations of trash--just like you'd read layers of rock!
