==Objectives==
Listen to [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]]' conversation with [[Tyr]].
* Hear Tyr's conversation with the Aspects

==Description==
This is incredible, seeing our friend back after so many thousands of years. So much has happened since we last spoke.

[[Azeroth|The world]] has changed. Our loss of Tyr was before even [[Great Sundering|the Sundering]]. But there will be time to discuss all those things later. For now, it's simply good to be with our friend. Stay with us, will you, <name>, while we reconnect?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
One moment, <name>--I want to hear what Tyr and the aspects are saying!

==Completion==
I almost can't believe we've arrived at this moment, <name>. So many years spent serving the [[Tyr's Guard]], seeing those watching [[Tomb of Tyr|Tyr's tomb]] die out--and now both he and the Guard are alive again!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|How long have I slumbered?}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Too long, Tyr. Much too long.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|You have not changed, Alexstrasza. Or you, [[Nozdormu]].}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|But what of the other Aspects?}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|Time has not been kind to all of us. But new Aspects have risen to take their place.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|Then you have suffered in my absence. Is that why you have reforged me?}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|At first, yes. But you join us now in a time of peace--and friendship.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|If it were not for our new ally, Captain [[Travard]] and the Tyr's Guard, we may have lost you forever.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|I... we, the Tyr's Guard, have followed your example for centuries. We would be honored if you would stay and speak to us at [[Tyr's Rest|our headquarters]].}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Come, Tyr. There is so much we all have to tell you.}}

Before the quest completes, you can talk to Alexstrasza to repeat the dialogue
:{{Gossip|I'm sorry, I missed that. What did you say?}}

Upon completion, [[Watcher Koranos]] has new gossip
:It is so good to see Keeper Tyr again. It has been many thousands of years since he has been at work in Tyrhold.
:It was he who forged us. I wonder if now he will forge new watchers?
