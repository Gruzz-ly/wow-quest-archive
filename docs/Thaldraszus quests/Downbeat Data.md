==Objectives==
Use [[Melly Teletone|Melly]]'s device near objects from other [[Alternate timeline|timelines]]. Pedgi's sunglasses will make them easier to find.
*Borrow [[Pedgi]]'s Sunglasses
*Banish Off-Beat Entities with Melly's Device (0/100%)
*[[Melly's Metronographer]] (provided)

==Description==
You say that [[Temporal Investigator Tempo|Tempo]] mentioned objects from other timelines?

I have a device used for syncing melodies. Strangely enough, it seems to have the same effect on timelines in [[Eon's Fringe|this town]]. Perhaps a side effect of the chaotic temporal energies here?

I've upgraded Pedgi's glasses to allow him to observe the rhythms of [[Azeroth|the world]]. They may make it easier to find mis-timed entities. Ask if you can borrow them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found any mis-timed entities?

==Completion==
Looks like the mis-timed objects are back in their proper place. One less thing for Tempo to worry about.

Hmm... Interesting data here. Perhaps it will come in handy later.

Apologies that Pedgi hasn't been much help. Probably best to muster up his resolve. This is his song to compose, after all.

==Notes==

;Speaking with Pedgi
:{{Gossip|quest=|Can I borrow your sunglasses?}}
::My glasses? Oh, no, I never take these off. It's my signature look. Extremely important for every artist.

::But I do have a spare pair you can borrow.

::Trying to see the rhythm of the world, huh? I wonder what would happen if you used Melly's device on things that don't match the beat. Something interesting, I'm sure.
:''The adventurer receives [[Pedgi's Spare Sunglasses]].''

Various objects become visible at the inn and outside. Use the extra action button on them. Sometimes, [[Time Flies]] appear. Kill them as well to advance.
