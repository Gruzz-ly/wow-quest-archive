==Objectives==
Return to [[Nozdormu]] in the Present.

==Description==
We were able to increase [[Chronormu|Ambassador Chronormu's]] connection to our time. I am certain when we find her again, we will be able to finish the ritual.

For now, let us return to our present and a world with... significantly fewer [[murloc]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for helping to uphold the timelines... odd as they may sometimes be.

==Notes==
Take the Portal to Temporal Conflux to return.

==Progression==
{{Big Time Adventurer}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
