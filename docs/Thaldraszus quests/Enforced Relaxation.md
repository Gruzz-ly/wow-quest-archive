==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Vadne Bleakheart.png|Vadne Bleakheart|A summoner of steam and flame, this Primalist prefers to cook her enemies alive.}}
Kill the [[elemental]] [[summoner]].
*[[Vadne Bleakheart]] slain

==Description==
Those [[Primalists]] that you saw certainly do not seem like the leadership type to me. Who would be afraid of a [[Baby (corgi)|little dog]]? Hah!

So, if they mentioned Vadne, that sounds like their leader. She must be the one bringing in these elementals. We need to get rid of the summoner. They must be close by to be causing such trouble. Check the cave directly under us. I know it is where some of the less diligent employees like to take an extended break.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 24,650 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with the [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you found the Primalist responsible for these elementals?

==Completion==
I am glad this will finally start to get better! We all deserve a little bit of downtime.

I hope you find a short respite here as well: you have earned it, <name>.

==Notes==
Return to the lower spa area again and enter the cave at {{Co|39.85|48.33|Thaldraszus}}.
