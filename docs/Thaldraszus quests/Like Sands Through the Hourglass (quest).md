==Objectives==
Collect 8 Piles of Windswept Time Sand in [[Gardens of Unity|the Gardens]].
*[[Pile of Windswept Time Sand]] (8)

==Description==
Like the rest of the gardens, [[Nozdormu]]'s hourglass has had to weather the [[elemental]] unrest. Turbulent [[Air elemental|wind elementals]] came through and scattered the [[magic]]al sand contained within.

Without this sand, Nozdormu's influence here is greatly diminished.

As a steward-in-training, I have been tasked with overseeing the hourglass at all times. If you would collect the sand in my stead, I would be eternally grateful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I can rest easy knowing Nozdormu has already foreseen your success.

==Completion==
Excellent work. Nozdormu informed me yesterday that he wishes to express his gratitude.

==Notes==
Piles of sand are just to the west. They will occasionally pop out a [[Lingering Gale]], so watch out!

On complete:
:{{text|say|Orizmu|Once you have finished all your tasks, return to [[Gryrmpech]]. He will be in need of your assistance.}}

==Progression==
