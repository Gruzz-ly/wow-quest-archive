'''Tumbling Through Time''' begins the final chapter of the [[Thaldraszus storyline]], "Big Time Adventurer".

==Objectives==
Gather your allies and then speak with [[Nozdormu]].
*Speak with [[Soridormi]] {{co|59.5|82.5|Thaldraszus}}
*Speak with [[Andantenormu]] {{co|60.2|81.8|Thaldraszus}}
*Speak with [[Siaszerathel]] {{co|59.3|82.2|Thaldraszus}}
*Speak with Nozdormu

==Description==
When the [[magic]] of [[Bronze dragonflight|Bronze]] and [[Infinite dragonflight|Infinite]] collided, it sent [[Chronormu]] and [[Eternus]] into an uncontrolled tumble through [[time]].

As they fall, they rip the fabric of time itself, sending out countless ripples across time and space. We must locate them and bring them back. Only then will we be able to stop any further damage. I see that you will be the one to stop Chronormu's fall.

I would ask that you to gather the allies you will need to save Chronormu, while I focus on her magic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Quickly. Even we do not have time to waste.

==Completion==
If we work quickly, I believe we may be able to catch her.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Soridormi]]:
:We must hold to our oath and preserve the timeways.

:{{gossip|Nozdormu requests your presence.}}
:{{text|say|Soridormi|I shall be there at once.}}

Speak with [[Siaszerathel]]:
:Chromie... I can't believe what happened!

:{{gossip|Nozdormu requests your presence.}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Me? Right! On it!}}

Speak with [[Andantenormu]]:
:To be lost in time... That is not a fate I would wish on even an Infinite dragon.

:{{gossip|Nozdormu requests your presence.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|Of course, <name>.}}

Speak with Nozdormu:
:I fear time may unravel if we do not act.

:{{gossip|Everyone is gathered.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I have located the moment in time where we may find Chronormu.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Soridormi, I will need you to hold the time portal open on the other side.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|My vision did not show me much, I could only see blurs of fire, ice and chaos.}}
:{{text|say|Soridormi|Do not worry beloved. I shall handle it.}}
:{{text|say|Soridormi|Zera! You are with me!}}
:{{text|say|Siaszerathel|Yes, commander!}}
:''Soridormi and Zera run off. Soridormi opens a Portal to the Primalist Future, then they both head through it.''
