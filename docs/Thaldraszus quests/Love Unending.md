==Objectives==
Gather Ephemeral Sand from the [[Temporal Conflux]].
*[[Ephemeral Sand]] (20)

==Description==
Alongside a proper conduit to house [[Tarecgosa]]'s [[soul]] during the ritual, we need enough [[magic]]al essence to ground the flower. The [[bronze dragonflight]] was involved in creating the staff you hold, so I believe it best we use their magic again.

Some of the sand within the Temporal Conflux should suit this purpose perfectly. Just make sure it's of the more magical variety.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|80|90}}

==Progress==
How goes the hunt for the sand?

==Completion==
Time is a fickle thing even when it flows properly. I do not understand how my kin can master it.

==Notes==
Kill the mobs in the [[Shifting Sands]] to collect the [[Ephemeral Sand]].

==Progression==
