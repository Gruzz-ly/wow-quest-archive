==Objectives==
Unearth the major find, then speak to [[Roska Rocktooth|Roska]] to begin excavating it.
* Major find unearthed
* Scholar's Chest excavated
*[[Archivist's Fire Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Great job on that small find! Now, are you ready for something big?

More often than not, shaking up the small stuff will shake up something even BIGGER just below the surface. Another little rumble, and we'll have a major find on our hands, I can feel it.

A major find work almost the same as the smaller ones with a couple extra steps. Why don't you tackle this one too? It'll be good practice for ya.

Don't worry! I can guide you through it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|90}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
Rare to find big stuff like that up here! Zenata might be up to her tricks again.

==Completion==
Look at you, master excavator! I reckon you're about ready to get into the field.

See you out in the dirt!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Sometimes an earthquake will drum up something REAL big!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|It's exciting, but you'll want to work quickly. Big artifacts only stay on the surface for about five minutes.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|After that, you'll have to plant your totem again and start over. Not the end of the world, but it's easier to do it fast the first time!}}

Roska has new gossip here:
{{book|content=
{{gossip|What should I be doing again?}}

Major finds like this take a little more care to excavate.

They function the same way though. Place your totem, use your elemental, and balance between the elements in your environment

But, the margin for error is smaller. Also, storms could blown in, tides could rise, lava floes--you name it!

Major finds are also fragile. If you work on them more than five or so minutes, you'll risk damaging the artifact. If that happens, rest before trying again.

Ready? Let's get excavating!

;Upon unearthing the find
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|The bigger the find, the more complex the excavation. And this is a big find, all right!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Watch out for the elements going haywire! You might find you'll suddenly have way too much water, or fire! Or wind or earth!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|The key to excavation is keeping conditions balanced.}}

;If you have too much fire during excavation
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Careful, don't incinerate our find!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Things are heating up! Cool it down before we start digging.}}

;If you have too much water during excavation
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|We'll need more heat if we want to clear that dust!}}

;Sometimes during the excavation it rains
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Now it's raining! Keep up the heat!}}

;If you have the elements in balance for some time
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Perfect! Looks safe to dig.}}

Upon excavating, you find the [[Draconic Scholar's Chest]]:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Huh, I think that's Nirobin's.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Never know what you'll dig up. Hah!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Now you're ready to get out in the field, get your boots muddy, and get excavating real artifacts!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Catch you at the site!}}
:''Roska runs back towards the tower.''
