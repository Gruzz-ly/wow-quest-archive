==Objectives==
Use Maldra's Ring of Binding to detain 8 rebels.
*[[Flightless|Rebels]] captured (8)
*[[Maldra's Ring of Elemental Binding]] (provided)

==Description==
If [[Alexstrasza]] truly wants to find the causes of this rebellion, we need to hear out the rebels.
   
To do that, we have to safely detain rebels who want to kill us. Well, you. That's much harder than resorting to violence, and more dangerous as well.

But I've experienced this when I left the rebels. [[Orian Darkwater]] cast a spell to bind me totally. It worked, and I paid close attention.

I've imbued that spell into a ring. You can use it to bind them safely. It should work, anyway!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*51,350 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Is the ring working? Have you rounded up many rebels?

==Completion==
This is the more difficult way, but every rebel we capture instead of kill is a chance to end this violence - and a life saved.

==Notes==
Use the quest item on any rebels in the caverns. Some turn neutral and head to Maldra and Erima:
*{{Text|say|You cannot prevent [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]]' downfall!}}
*{{Text|say|You've beaten me, but you'll never stop the rebellion!}}
*{{Text|say|I am defeated, but the flightless will carry on!}}
*{{Text|say|My brothers and sisters will fight on without me!}}

Others get Elemental Enrage:
*{{Text|say|We will not yield to dragons!}}
*{{Text|say|The Flightless will not be bound!}}

Back with [[Scalesworn Guard]]s, they turn to [[Captured Bruiser]] and [[Captured Mender]].

==Progression==
