==Objectives==
Free 8 Timewalkers from Time Bubbles.
*[[Timewalkers]] Freed (8)
*[[Timewalker Staff]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm so glad you're here! I need you to stabilize the situation here on the platforms while [[Andantenormu|Dante]] and [[Siaszerathel|Zera]] help me hold [[Eternus|our infinite dragon friend]] in place.

[[Temporal Conflux|The temple]]'s security measures locked Eternus in a stasis bubble when she tried to take control of [[Bronze Oathstone|our Oathstone]]. Unfortunately, the other Timewalkers were also caught in those security measures.

Your Timewalker staff should free them, no problem. Just make sure to deal with any angry [[timeling]]s that pop up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
We can't have our Temple visitors rest inside of stasis bubbles when they get here.

Oh, wait! Maybe that's exactly what we should do! I'll write it down for later, <name>.

==Completion==
It worked? I'm not surprised... not entirely, at least!

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|<Name>! I require your assistance as well!}}

He starts [[Quelling Causalities]].

Timewalkers NPCs are in bubbles, and the [[Extra Action Button]] appears when near them:
:{{Abilities|Termporal Destabilizing Beam|Disrupts Bronze stasis bubbles.|range=10|notes=Channeled|id=373029|icon=inv_staff_1h_drakonid_c_01}}

Freeing them pops out two enemies, and they also have something to say:
*{{text|say|[[Amu'sha Skystrider]]|Thank you very much. Excuse me while I find my sister and apologize for something I've just done in an [[alternate timeline]]...}}
*{{text|say|[[Suma the Guised]]|Thank you! My body was in that bubble, but my mind was stuck in the darkest days of my past.}}
*{{text|say|[[Historian Jum'Flitmo]]|[[Loa]]! I was back in time to me teaching days! Nightmarish students, dey were.}}
*{{text|say|[[Scribe Kalve]]|Finally free!! I saw visions of my afterlife in there! Took me forever to decide on a [[Covenant]]...}}
*{{text|say|[[Warden Dialash]]|Death's wing! I saw a future of unstoppable [[Dracthyr]] imbued with the [[light]]!}}
*{{text|say|[[Warden Krizzik]]|WOAH! I saw my future! My great grandson marries a [[night elf]], and to be honest, their kids had incredible ears.}}
*{{text|say|[[Wan'she Skystrider]]|Gah! I've seen yet another future where the [[Baine Bloodhoof|Bloodhoof chieftain]] is captured!}}
*{{text|say|[[Elo'sho Skystrider]]|Sweet [[Earthmother]]! I'm finally free of that dreaded timeline! It was all [[gold]], [[explosive]]s, and [[Goblin]] politicians!}}
