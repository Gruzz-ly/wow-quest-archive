==Objectives==
Gather 5 pieces of [[Flightless|rebel]] propaganda.
*Propaganda collected (5)

==Description==
The rebels seem to have a lot of signs and flyers around the cave. They probably use it as a way to keep everyone aligned to their purpose, and motivated to fight.

It's hard to keep a large group united around a cause - especially if you use detestable methods like bombing civilians or destroying a water source - without a steady stream of reinforcement.

Let's get a bunch of their propaganda. It may tell us a lot about what they're thinking, or who's telling them what to think.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*51,350 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Have you gotten a good sample of their writings?

==Completion==
These seem to mostly be written by [[Instigator Belaphon]] - I met her once, when I was in the rebellion. If we can find her, perhaps we can stop her from inciting so much anger!

I'll also be able to look through these for any codes or ciphers from my rebel days they might still be using, to see if we can find out more. Good work, <name>!

==Notes==
Find [[Rebel Writings]] and loot:
