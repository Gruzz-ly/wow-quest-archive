==Objectives==
Obtain a piece of loot from the [[Great Vault]].
*Collect a reward from the Great Vault {{co|58.8|57.7|Valdrakken}}
*[[Resplendent Gemstone]]

==Description==
Over the years, the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]] and their kin acquired many remarkable artifacts and armaments. The Aspects ordered the construction of an enchanted vault where they could be stored for safe-keeping until such a time as a worthy soul came in search of that which lay within.

You will find this Great Vault within the walls of the bank. Perhaps, if you prove your mettle, it will grant you a piece of the Aspects' ancient hoard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The vault seems to know when a worthy soul approaches. You need not be afraid. Go on. Give it a look.

==Completion==
So you were able to open it after all? Even those ancient magics recognize your knack for heroic exploits.

It would be wise to check the vault regularly. No doubt the treasures that lie within will prove useful in the battles to come.

==Notes==
Players are not handed the quest item automatically. They must complete at least one of the objectives to continue:
* Defeat at least 2 raid bosses (on any difficulty), 
* Complete at least 1 [[Mythic+]] dungeon (at any level)
* Earn at least 1250 [[Honor]] from Rated PvP

Once that is complete, check back in after the weekly reset, select an item, then turn in this quest.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
