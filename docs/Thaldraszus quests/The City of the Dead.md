==Objectives==
Meet up with [[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]] at the [[Veiled Ossuary]] in [[Thaldraszus]].

==Description==
An ancient city of the dead can only mean one thing. The Veiled Ossuary off the coast of northern Thaldraszus.

It's extensive, remote, and hard to approach. The perfect place to hide something. I'm not sure what we'll find there, <name>. But you can bet that it won't appreciate our presence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good, you're here! The sooner we begin the sooner we can leave.

==Progression==
{{A Mystery, Sealed}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
