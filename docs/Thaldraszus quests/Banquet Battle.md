'''Banquet Battle''' is a world quest at [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]].

==Objectives==
* [[Banquet Table|Table flipped]] {{co|58.1|42.7|Thaldraszus}}

* Unshielded [[Professor Intinosa]] splattered

==Description==
[[File:Banquet Table.jpg|thumb|A banquet table, ready for flipping]]
:{{text|say|[[Headmaster (dragon)|Headmaster]]|At [[Algeth'ar Academy]] we believe in teaching by example. Please show these students how it is done.}}

==Rewards==

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Headmaster|Another A plus performance from my favorite student.}}

==Notes==
Interact with the table to flip it and hide behind it. While behind cover, players have access to one ability:
#{{Abilities|Throw Conjured Boar Candy|Throw a conjured sweetened chunk of boar meat at a target.|id=385760|icon=inv_misc_food_draenor_rawboarflesh|range=100|cd=5|notes=Instant. Ground-targeted ability}}

Use the ready projectile to nail [[Eager Freshscale]]s that are running around in this phase. Additionally, [[Professor Intinosa]], Master of Illusions, is taking part! She will occasionally channel a barrier that dispels all thrown items. When it fades, she'll launch meat at all in the area.

==Patch changes==
