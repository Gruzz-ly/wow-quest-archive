==Objectives==
Defeat the Primalists occupying the [[Gelikyr Overlook]].
*Quell the [[Primalists|Primalist]] threat (0/100%)
*Speak with [[Sharnax]] at the Gelikyr Overlook.
*[[Rejuvenating Draught (Thaldraszus)]] (provided)

==Description==
<[[Commander Thadezus|Thadezus]] scoffs at your approach.>

Are you a mortal of action, or are you going to get out of our way, <class>?

I have lost many good soldiers to those Primalists up ahead.

We have an idea of what they are planning, but we must first rout the enemy and rescue those serving under me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Highland Drake: Spined Back]]

==Progress==
Have you stopped the Primalists, or do I need to do this myself?

==Completion==
<Sharnax stares down at you.>

Hmm... It appears you are someone with more skill than the commander had originally assumed.

There is more to be done before the day is over.
