==Objectives==
Test the upgraded Metronographer.
*Take the [[Melly's Metronographer++|Upgraded Metronographer]].
*Test the Metronographer on the paused [[Temporal Investigator]].
*Re-sync the reversed Temporal Investigator.
*Re-sync the slowed down Temporal Investigator.
*Re-sync the sped up Temporal Investigator.

==Description==
While [[Pedgi]] had you out killing [[Ooze|slimes]], I asked the investigators here how we can actually help.

Seems quite a few of them are stuck in time anomalies. Luckily, I've just finished giving the metronographer a few temporal upgrades. It should now help the investigators get back in sync.

But we need to test it out first. Looks like there's someone nearby who will do the trick.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q2=10|Flightstones

==Progress==
Oh, I saw that Pedgi had you collect time slime grime for me. I did not ask for it and I do not need it.

<Melly sighs a long suffering sigh.>

At least he's trying to be helpful.

==Completion==
Seems the metronographer worked just as intended! 

How interesting that temporal energies are so similar to music. I wonder if the bronze dragonflight has ever conducted research on the subject...

Sorry, rambling. Let's get back to helping [[Temporal Investigator Tempo|Tempo]]. My next paycheck depends on it.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Best to test the device where I can see the result.}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|This investigator behind us is stuck mid-jump. Let's start with him.}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|Wow, it almost looks like he's falling!}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Yes, Pedgi. That's what happens after you jump.}}

Loot the Metronographer from the table and use it on the Temporal Investigator frozen in the air near the table.
:{{Text|say|Temporal Investigator|My leg!}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Ah. I guess he was falling. Not jumping.}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Don't worry, we can fix this.}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|A few more investigators are still de-synchronized. I'll leave it to you.}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Just try not to break anymore legs, hero.}}

Find and use the item on a fishing and running Temporal Investigator by the river and a backward-walking Temporal Investigator inside [[Stananormu]]'s tower.
