==Objectives==
Dispel 8 Polymorphed Creatures and confiscate Jaina's Wand of Mass Polymorph.
*Take the portal from [[Everywhen Inn]] to [[Tiragarde Sound]] (Optional)
*[[Polymorph]]ed Creatures dispelled (8)
*[[Wand of Mass Polymorph]]
*Return to [[Soridormi]] in Everywhen Inn
*Take the portal from Tiragarde Sound to Everywhen Inn (Optional)

==Description==
Somehow, [[Jaina Proudmoore]] has found a magic [[wand]]. Not our Jaina, of course, but her childhood self. She is far too young to have access to such power.

We need you to help clean up the mess she's made and confiscate that wand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

|q3=70|Paracausal Flakes
}}

==Progress==
Jaina must not practice [[magic]] until she is old enough to handle it responsibly. I trust you to put a stop to this before the situation becomes dire.

==Completion==
Thank you for calming that chaos. I shudder to think what would happen if she grew up with such... tendencies.

==Notes==

Take the portal to be teleported to [[Foxhollow Woods]]. There are [[Boralus Guard (NPC)|Boralus Guard]]s and [[Confused Fox]]es polymorphed as sheep. In the middle stands little Jaina. The Dispel Magic extra action button is available. Use it on the sheep.
