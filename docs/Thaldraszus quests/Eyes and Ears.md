==Objectives==
Locate Clues within [[Valdrakken]].
*Crafter's Consortium investigated {{co|34.7|61.3|Valdrakken}}
*Bank investigated {{co|59.1|54.8|Valdrakken}}
*Inn investigated {{co|47.0|47.7|Valdrakken}}

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] have been spewing their propaganda among the citizens of Valdrakken.

Our enemies are too wily to say anything in the presence of my [[Scalesworn]], but perhaps you might be able to get close enough to eavesdrop on their conversations and see if there is anything of value to learn.

I have marked locations on your map for further investigation.

Take this enchanted stone, as long as you have it on hand we will be able to communicate.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Eavesdropper's Cowl
|Eavesdropper's Cap
|Eavesdropper's Coif
|Eavesdropper's Helm
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Well, find anything unusual?

==Completion==
So, the Primalists are up to something in the south and soldiers have not been arriving from [[South Hold Garrison]]... This does not sound good <name>. That does not sound good at all.

==Notes==
Drop down (or take the teleport) to the ground level. From the water feature in the center of the plaza, head southwest past the auction house to the [[Artisan's Market]] at {{co|35.8|60.9|Valdrakken}}
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|Many people come here for commerce. Find a place to blend-in with the merchants and keep your ears open.}}

Check on the [[Consortium Ledger]] at {{co|34.7|61.3|Valdrakken}}:
:''A blue and a yellow [[dragonspawn]] walk up.''
:{{text|say|[[Valdrakken Citizen]]|Did you hear?}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen|Hear what?}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen|A [[drake]] tells me that the [[Trueborn]] are on the move. Something important is about to happen!}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen|Truly?}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen|I do not know the details, but... he is close to finding it. Soon he will have the power to put the flights in their place... as they deserve.}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen|Shhhh! Do not let the Scalesworn hear you speak like that!}}

Head north, at the [[Roasted Ram]] inn {{co|48.3|49.8|Valdrakken}}:
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|Everyone comes to the Roasted Ram eventually. Grab a drink to blend in, but keep your wits about you.}}
:{{text|say|Brigita|Welcome to the Roasted Ram! Seating is open.}}

Interact with the [[Goblet]] at {{co|47.0|47.7|Valdrakken}}:
:''Two citizens walk up to the bar that [[Tithris]], the innkeeper, is tending.''
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen 1|Greetings, brother. Any news?}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen 2|A delay, unfortunately. They are still looking for it at [[South Hold Gate]].}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen 1|Still?! Should they not have found it by now?}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen 2|I am sure everything will be handled by the time our benefactors are ready. He will make sure of it.}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen 1|Careful! We speak too casually, there are unfamiliar faces about.}}

To the southeast, enter the [[Valdrakken Treasury Hoard]] at {{co|55.0|57.4|Valdrakken}}:
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|I doubt the Primalists come to bank vaults to discuss their plans, but we may still overhear something useful. Act like you are inspecting one of the holding chests.}}

Interact with the [[Storage Chest]] at {{co|59.1|54.8|Valdrakken}}:
:''A red dracthyr runs up to [[Vekkalis]]'s desk.''
:{{text|say|[[Vekkalis]]|My apologies, there is nothing here awaiting you.}}
:{{text|say|Valdrakken Citizen|What do you mean? [[Commander Eranog]] said it would be here.}}
:{{text|say|Vekkalis|I have not seen him. Come to think of it, I have not seen anyone from [[South Hold]] come by today. Very strange.}}

Turn in at the base of the tower, not up top.
