==Objectives==
Assist [[Alexstrasza]] at the [[Mother Oathstone]].
*Ritual begun
*[[Ezrigeth]] slain {{co|57.6|58.4|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
The Mother Oathstone is an ancient gift bestowed to our flights by the [[Titans]]. If what we have learned is true, I might be able to reactivate it and in doing so restore our aspectral powers.

Though we are unsure the outcome, if this has the slightest chance of working I must attempt it.

<Name>, I would appreciate if you would join me in this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
What happened, <name>? Where is Alexstrasza?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Our final task is upon us, please join me once more.}}

Speak with Alexstrasza again:
:We are so close to recovering our aspectral powers, are you prepared <name>?

:{{gossip|quest=|I am ready to begin.}}

:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I owe you my thanks.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You have helped the dragonflights remember our calling.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|With the oathstones renewed, we can finally reclaim our aspectral power.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|This has to work.}}
:''Alexstrasza channels into the Mother Oathstone, but...''
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Nothing...}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|But the oathstones were renewed...}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|How is this possible...}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|<cackles>}}
:''Raszageth cackles from her perch a few layers up, looking down on Alexstrasza and the adventurer.''
:{{text|say|Raszageth|It seems your titans have abandoned you.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Raszageth! What have you done?!}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|You proved yourself unworthy all on your own...}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|"Queen of the Dragons".}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|Now, it is our time.}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|The age of the Incarnates... has come.}}
:''Raszageth takes flight, buzzes Alexstrasza and the adventurer, and flies off to the [[Vault of the Incarnates]].''
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|She's going to release them...}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|No!}}
:''Alexstrasza shifts to her dragon form and flies after Raszageth. The adventurer hears another proto-dragon land, and runs down the stairs to intercept [[Ezrigeth]].''

Aggro Ezrigeth:
:{{text|say|Ezrigeth|Death to the pawn of the titans!}}

On a timer, Ezrigeth takes flight and drops a few bombs on the field before landing again:
:{{text|yell|Ezrigeth|Feel the elements!}}

Finish Ezrigeth off:
:{{text|say|Ezrigeth|How could... my strength... fail...}}
:''Nozdormu flies in.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Champion, I am glad to see you safe. My vision only showed me of the peril you were in. I came as soon as I could.}}
