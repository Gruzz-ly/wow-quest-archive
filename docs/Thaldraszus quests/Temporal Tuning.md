==Objectives==
Use Chrono Crystal on [[Eternus]] and [[Chromie]] in the [[Primalist Future]] to stop them from falling through time.
*Temporal Position Fixed (0/100%) {{co|46.8|41.5|Primalist Future}}
*Return to [[Nozdormu]] in the present.
*[[Chrono Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Chronormu and Eternus are falling though time, but I sense them stop every so often. These brief moments are our opportunity to find them.

<[[Nozdormu]] conjures a small chrono crystal.>

I have imbued this crystal with power as well as my own temporal resonance. They have gone to a... troubling possible future. Find them and use it. Hopefully you can fix their position in time before they slip away again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Further and further they slide away... Falling out of my sight...

==Completion==
The process was not finished but I can more accurately track Chronormu now.

==Notes==
While in the [[Primalist Future]] on these quests, players are buffed with '''Call for Zera''', granting the [[Extra Action Button]]:
:{{Abilities|Accompanied by Zera|Call for Siaszerathel to assist you.|cd=20 sec|notes=Instant|id=372444|icon=inv_dracthyrhead06}}

Head northwest of the [[Temporal Conflux]] to find [[Chromie]] and [[Eternus]] trapped in bubbles near each other, spinning off-axis:
:{{text|say|Chromie|<Name>! I just knew Nozdormu would send you!}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Hurry, mortal. We do not have time to dally.}}

Use the provided [[Chrono Crystal]]:
:{{text|say|Chromie|Uh oh! We're slipping away! Hurry!}}
:''They both phase out of this existence.''

==Progression==
