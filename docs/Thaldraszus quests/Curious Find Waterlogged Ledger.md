'''Curious Find: Waterlogged Ledger''' starts from the [[Waterlogged Ledger]], which can randomly be found in one of the tomes awarded for filling a bar during [[The Big Dig: Traitor's Rest]].

==Objectives==
Bring the [[:Waterlogged Ledger]] to [[Eadweard Dalyngrigge]] at the [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]].

==Description==
<This leather-bound ledger is so waterlogged it's nearly falling apart.

Most of it is illegible, but the text that has survived is in an ancient draconic dialect. It appears to be lists and lists of ordinary items, with numbers assigned to them-- perhaps a household accounting book?

Eadweard would know how to preserve this find and figure out whom it might belong to.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* 100x [[Mysterious Fragment]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Completion==
Aha! A curious find. I shall reach out to the appropriate parties immediately, and we can have it documented and returned to its home post-haste.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|A ledger! How exciting! Though bookkeeping may be a snore in our current day, records such as these are incredibly valuable for studying the past.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Naturally, memories of the grand and valuable have a way of surviving, but who is keeping track of the price of radishes over thousands of years?}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|This ancient dragonkin bookkeeper, that's who! And we salute them!}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Of course, this specimen is not in the best of conditions, owing to its briny storage, but I'm sure work can be done to restore the ink.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|And then, imagine the data we'll have on what these humble folks felt was important enough to note down. Who they traded with, what they ate, how they dealt with hardship...}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|The opportunities for knowledge are endless! I shall get our best preservationists on the case, and consult with Atrenosh about our find.}}
