==Description==
Here we are. If we're going to get past this door, we need to understand who locked it, and how.

Take a look around and see if you can find anything that might give us the answers we seek.

* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What an intriguing discovery. What do you imagine is on the other side?

==Completion==
We'll need more to go on than this.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Take a look around, <name>. Our investigation is just getting started.}}

Three objects light up. First, the Broken Watcher that Toddy is staring at:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|The top of a staff is known as the finial. It looks like something was on this one at one point. Curious.}}

The door at the top of the steps:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Interesting... I don't see an obvious locking mechanism. Titan devices are never that simple though, are they?}}

The snapped staff is to the west on the platform with an even-more-broken statue:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|A broken staff? Unfortunate. If these watchers are, er... were integral to this locking mechanism, we need to find a way to repair or replace this.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|More questions, and no answers...}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Have ye tried... knocking?}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|By the [[Sunwell]], Toddy.}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|We'll need to reach outside the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] for this one. <Name>, can you speak to [[Koranos]]? He may know something.}}

==Progression==
{{A Mystery, Sealed}}
