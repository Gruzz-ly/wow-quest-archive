==Objectives==
See if [[Temporal Investigator Tempo|Tempo]] would be willing to help [[Pedgi]] with his music.
*Talk to Tempo
*Find Pedgi and [[Melly Teletone|Melly]] at the [[Everywhen Inn]]

==Description==
Oh good, an [[adventurer]]. You've heard of Pedgi, I presume? The composer?

No? Well, don't tell him that.

We were traveling to research his next song, when we stumbled upon a [[Bronze dragon|dragon]] named Tempo. Pedgi is now convinced they're the only one who can help us.

Yes, because of the name. That's really all it takes for him.

But Tempo here is, understandably, too busy to help us. Could you talk to them? See if we can help clear their schedule?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,050 [[XP]]
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Yes, he's always like this. But he pays well and I get to travel.

==Completion==
Thanks for talking to Tempo.

Pedgi can be temperamental, but his heart is in the right place. Most of the time.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|[[Temporal Defender]]|Remain wary, <class>. Strange temporal energies are lingering in this area.}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|It's no use... Tempo is too busy to talk to me.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Melly Teletone]]|Couldn't we just come back later?}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|It's no use! I'm nothing to them! What was I thinking?}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Pedgi. Please.}}
:{{Text|yell|Pedgi|I'm a speck of dust! I'm a worthless fraud!}}
:{{Text|emote|Melly sighs.}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|He's probably going to mope at the inn. Can you speak with Tempo then meet us there?}}

;Speaking with Temporal Investigator Tempo
:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have any... musical advice?}}
:{{Text|say|Temporal Investigator Tempo|Oh, are you with the exuberant little vulpera?}}
:{{Text|say|Temporal Investigator Tempo|Apologies, but I am quite busy at the moment.}}
:{{Text|say|Temporal Investigator Tempo|We temporal investigators are dealing with... remnants. Loose threads. Mismatched moments.}}
:{{Text|say|Temporal Investigator Tempo|Leakages from nearby timelines need to be found and cleared up. I will be free once things are a bit more consistent.}}

;In Everywhere Inn
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Pedgi. Please. You have to get up.}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|I can't. I'm dead. I've died.}}
:{{Text|emote|Melly sighs.}}
:{{Text|say|Melly Teletone|Do you want some coffee? Will that perk you up?}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|Maybe.}}

;Pedgi's gossip
:Six over eight? No... But maybe alternating with three over three...
