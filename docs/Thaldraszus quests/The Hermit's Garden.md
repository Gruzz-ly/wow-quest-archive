==Objectives==
Speak to [[Szareth]] in [[Shadow Ledge]].

==Description==
Our parents always say we shouldn't visit the gardens above [[Gelikyr Post|Gelikyr]]. They think the gardener is mean and dangerous.

That's not true, though! They're a bit grumpy, but they're really nice!

None of us have been up there since the [[Primalists]] showed up. It's way too dangerous now. Still, I hope the gardener is okay. Could you go and check on them, since we can't visit anymore?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You'd better not have trampled any of my plants with those clumsy stompers of yours. Now, what do you want from me?

==Progression==
{{Bleeding Hearts}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
