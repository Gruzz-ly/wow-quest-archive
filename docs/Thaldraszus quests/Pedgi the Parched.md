==Objectives==
Get [[Pedgi]] a drink from the [[Everywhen Inn|inn]]'s [[Bartender Bob|bartender]].
*Pedgi's drink
*Drink delivered to Pedgi

==Description==
Pedgi's being dramatic. Again.

I know it seems childish, and that's because it is childish, but he responds well to little treats when he's in a mood.

Could you get him a coffee from the bar downstairs?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Pedgi's treat should get him to stop moping. By the [[titan]]s, I can't believe I had to say that...

==Completion==
I knew musicians were a temperamental sort, but this is ridiculous. At least he's up.

==Notes==
Head downstairs to Bob and buy one from:
*[[Single Black Coffee]]
*[[Five-Eon Energy]]
*[[Eonized Latte]]

Head back to Pedgi and speak with him:

:{{Text|say|Pedgi|Okay, fine. But I'm not doing anything until I finish this.}}
:{{Text|emote|Pedgi takes a sip.}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|No sugar? Hmm. This is going to take a while.}}
:{{Text|emote|Melly glares at Pedgi.}}

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Give Pedgi a five-eon energy.>}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|Ooh. This smells... interesting.}}
:{{Text|emote|Pedgi takes a sip.}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|Five-eons, you say? Hope that'll be enough time.}}
:{{Text|emote|Melly rolls her eyes at Pedgi.}}

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Give Pedgi an eonized latte.>}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|An eonized latte? Oh, what a delightful combination!}}
:{{Text|emote|Pedgi takes a sip.}}
:{{Text|say|Pedgi|Melly, you have to try this. It is fantastic. A perfect compliment to compromise.}}
:{{Text|emote|Melly rolls her eyes at Pedgi.}}

[[Beverage for Pedgi]] is initially listed in the Progress part, but it is never obtained and is instead substituted by the three items above.
