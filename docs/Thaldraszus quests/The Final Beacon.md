==Objectives==
Help the [[Tyr's Guard]] activate the Final Beacon.
*[[Talthis]] and [[Valunei]]'s portal taken
*Speak to Valunei
*[[Deceiver Hr'qoth]] slain
*Protect the Beacon (0/100%)
*Take the Portal to Tyrhold

==Description==
Valunei and Talthis still aren't back. They must have had trouble with their beacon. We can't find the disc without it, and there's no way to help from here.

We must lead the Tyr's Guard through their portal to help. Are you ready, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
We're all back in one piece, thank the [[Light]].

Now, hopefully our [[dragon]] friends can find that disc!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|They must have run into trouble if they weren't back right on our heels!}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|We need to go help them. We're going to go help them, right?}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Of course! We do what we must for [[Tyr]]. And for the Tyr's Guard!}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|For the Tyr's Guard!}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|For the Tyr's Guard!}}
:''The paladins all run into the [[Black Empire: Primordial Azeroth]] portal.''

Follow suit. On the other side of the portal is the [[Black Empire]] and the paladins by the [[Temporal Beacon]]. Approach Travard.
:{{Text|say|Talthis|Travard! <Name>! Valunei has fallen prey to a [[faceless one]]! I can't get through to her!}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|We'll protect the beacon, <name>. Go and help Valunei.}}

Up ahead is Valunei and [[Vindicator Iriska]]. Approach them:
:{{Text|say|Valunei|My [[Commander (rank)|commander]], you once saved my life... let me save yours! Come with me!}}
:{{Text|say|Vindicator Iriska|Stay awhile, Valunei. I have another... mission for you. Come closer, child.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|It's luring you away from the beacon. Away from us! Resist it, Valunei, for [[Light]]'s sake!}}

Speak with Valunei:
:That doesn't make sense. Why shouldn't I go with Iriska?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Talthis is right. This can't be your friend. You should resist her!}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|Resist? This is my commander. She will prove it! Iriska, tell them what you would say to me when you would catch me daydreaming?}}
:{{Text|say|Vindicator Iriska|I would say... Foolish draenei! I will end you!}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|Iriska? No! I... I must end you, sister!}}
:{{Text|say|Deceiver Hr'qoth|[Shath'Yar] Ta'thall puul iiqaath arwi lal uull nuq tallol zz }}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|A faceless one! You preyed on my compassion for my friend!}}
:{{Text|say|Deceiver Hr'qoth|[Shath'Yar] Mh'naus vaz an'qov ez vaz i naggwa'fssh Yrr uull ni yrr Gag Arwi ta'thall nuq }}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|How did I fall for that creature's lies? I... need time. I'm going back, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|We have this in hand, Valunei. We will rally back at Tyrhold.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|I will help guard the beacon. <name>, hold off that monster!}}

Attack the n'raqi.
:{{Text|say|Deceiver Hr'qoth|[Shath'Yar] Uull Puul shg'ullwaq thyzz lal shg'ullwaq }}

During the fight Deceiver Hr'qoth summons shades of the Tyr's Guard - [[Shade of Hadwin]], [[Shade of Valunei]], [[Shade of Talthis]], [[Shade of Nolaki]], and [[Shade of Travard]]. Kill them.
:{{Text|say|Deceiver Hr'qoth|[Shath'Yar] Qwor ma yrr Bo'al Uhnish gag sk'yahf ree'thael }}

Return to the beacon and kill [[Monstrous Behemoth]]s, [[Umbral Seer]]s, and [[Leeching Parasite]]s to fulfill the objective.
Umbral Seer|[Shath'Yar] Sk'yahf uull ez uull 
Monstrous Behemoth|[Shath'Yar] Yrr Bo'al Uhnish iiqaath 

During the fight
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|Hadwin, I'm pretty sure I've killed more than you so far.}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|Talthis, save some for the rest of us!}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|There's nothing I hate fighting more than disgusting abominations like these.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|Be seared by the light, faceless monster!}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|There are so many of them!}}

;Objective completed
:{{Text|say|Travard|There... The beacon is activated.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|Fine work, Travard. And thank you, <name>, for helping us keep the faceless at bay!}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|Can we leave this evil place now?}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Not yet. <Name>, return to [[Tyrhold]] and let [[Chromie]] and [[Eternus]] know we've been successful. We'll stay here and make sure the beacon isn't destroyed before they get its signal!}}

Take the portal back. Chromie has a new gossip:
:Captain Travard has proven to be a good leader. I can see that his recruits respect him and have become powerful paladins under his training. I just hope its{{sic}} enough... I'm glad you'll be there to help, <name>!

So does Eternus:
:Undoing the damage [[Chrono-Lord Deios|Deios]] wrought throwing Tyr's disc to the [[Timeways]] will heal one rift between the [[Infinite dragonflight|infinites]] and the [[bronze dragonflight]]. But true peace will take more than that.

And Koranos too:
:Thank you, <name>, for helping our recruits find their way.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Eternus|The last beacon's signal is strong. In a moment, I will have the disc's location.}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Anything I can help with, Eternus?}}
:{{Text|say|Eternus|No, we just need patience as the devices and the spell do their work...}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nozdormu]]|Travard will be ready when the time comes, I trust?}}

Nozdormu has a new gossip:
:It will be good to speak to Tyr after all these centuries. But I do wonder what he will think of this world...
