'''A Sliver of Silver''' concludes the "Tyr's Fall" storyline of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]]. In [[patch 10.1.7]], the storyline continues with the "Reforging the Tyr's Guard" storyline of the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]].

==Objectives==
Escape [[Tomb of Tyr|the tomb]] and return to the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]] at Tyrhold in [[Valdrakken]].
*Use the [[Titan Transporter]] to return to [[Tyrhold]].
*Return to the Aspects
*[[:Silver Scale]] activated
*Speak to [[Nozdormu]] at Tyrhold in Valdrakken.

==Description==
[[Tyr]]'s final memories are in our hands. This is not a responsibility to be taken lightly.

Let us take the Silver Scale to Nozdormu in Tyrhold. We will attempt to use the console there to awaken him.

If he is whole again, there will be much to discuss.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* [[Titan's Containment Device]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +2500 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
We will do whatever we must to restore Tyr.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

I am... disappointed that the Silver Scale was not the answer.

We may have to resign ourselves to a future without Tyr.

I am not still without hope we may find the disk and restore Tyr. And some part of me believes we may defeat [[Infinite dragonflight|the infinites]]--and the [[Primal Incarnates|Incarnates]]--on our own.

But some paths, however dark, are fated to be tread.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|I wonder... was one of Tyr's greatest fears the corruption of the Aspects?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Travard]]|As much as I'd like to dismiss the words of a follower of the [[Old God]]s...}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|I suppose any questions we have we can answer when he is awakened. Let us depart.}}
:''Koranos and Travard use the teleporter.''

Follow suit.
:{{Text|say|[[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]]|<Name> and Koranos have returned. Were you able to collect Tyr's memories?}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Yes, we have returned with Tyr's final memories, captured by the Silver Scale. And Captain Travard of the Silver Hand{{sic}}!}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|I am honored to be a part of Tyr's return. Will this restore him, then?}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|It is our hope that it will. <Name>, it is time to use the scale once more.}}

Interact with the [[Forge Console]]:
{{book|content=
The console surges with energy. It awaits your command.

{{Gossip|<Activate the Silver Scale.>}}

:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|The Aspects... fill me with hope...}}
:{{Text|emote|Keeper Tyr appears to move briefly before shutting down again.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|The Silver Scale... I thought it would be enough...}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|The Silver Scale brought him back for a moment... Is there more we can do?}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|The timeways grow ever difficult to read. All that is left to do is to prepare for the infinites.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Kalecgos]]|There are still avenues to explore. I am sure a new path will become clear to us.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|I will alert what is left of the [[Knights of the Silver Hand|Silver Hand]]. They may know something--and they deserve to hear of what I witnessed!}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Whatever may come, with or without Tyr, we will face the infinites--together.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We are [[dragon]]s. We will rise!}}

Following this, Nozdormu has new gossip
:<Name>, the Silver Scale may yet help us to restore Tyr.
