Use the Missing Keystones to repair the reservoir wards, then activate the console.
*West ward reactivated
*North ward reactivated
*East ward reactivated
*Activate console

==Description==
We can finally restore the wards. We have suffered great losses, but our work must be completed.

<Name>, we need your help once more. Bring each keystone to its rightful place in order to make the wards whole again.

Once that is done, come back, so we can activate the console and restore order in the reservoir.

==Rewards==

|Sister's Token
|Sister's Embrace
|Sister's Gift
|Sister's Keeper
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Once all three wards are repaired, return here to activate the ward console.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. The wards have been restored, and Tyrhold Reservoir is once again protected. Thank you for all you have done. Thaldraszus owes you a great debt.

==Notes==
Enter the three chambers via dragonriding drake and interact with [[Broken Ward Stone]]s to reactivate them. Once done, return back and activate the [[Warding Console]] next to Mara.
