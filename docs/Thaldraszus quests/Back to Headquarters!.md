==Objectives==
Meet with [[Eadweard Dalyngrigge]] at [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]].

==Description==
Eadweard called for your return to the main office after I'd finished with you... er, this experiment, I mean.

I'm sure it has to do with pomp, circumstance, reward, and what have you. If any of that entices you, then best hurry before his bag of goodies runs dry to all the other recent recruits.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good show, <name>!

I had heard high praise of you from [[Roska Rocktooth|Roska]] and [[Zenata]], but hearing from [[Nirobin]] as well... Well! You must be truly exceptional. He has, shall we say, discerning taste!

But enough about that. You've done more than enough to consider yourself a premier Azerothian Archivist.

Welcome to the team!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Nirobin|I'll be here, investigating whether Reese's needs include frequent snack or outside time.}}

:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|You're absolutely dripping with historical knowledge, <name>! And mud, of course.}}
