==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Time Slime Prime.png}}
Re-synchronize and defeat the Time Slime Prime.
*Sync and Slay [[Time Slime Prime]]
*Return to [[Temporal Investigator Tempo|Tempo]] in [[Eon's Fringe]]
*[[Melly's Metronographer++]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright, one last problem to help solve. Succeed at this and we'll surely have earned an audience with Tempo!

The investigators discovered another Time Slime. A much larger, powerful Time Slime.

We've come to call it Time Slime Prime.

Its temporal energies are greatly accelerated, making it especially deadly. I recommend using the metronographer several times to slow it back down before engaging in combat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 11,350 [[XP]]

Oh, hello! Are you early, or am I late?

==Completion==
Ah, there you are. Thank you for your assistance in our time-tidying efforts.

Now I have to{{sic}} a chance to speak with [[Pedgi]] himself! Truly, what an honor. It was so difficult holding myself back when he first approached me. But now I have plenty of time to speak with him.
