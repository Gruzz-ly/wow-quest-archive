==Objectives==
Protect Travard at the [[Temple of Order]].
*Portal Taken to Temple of Order
*Protect [[Travard]] (0/100%)
*Take the Portal to Tyrhold

==Description==
The [[portal]]s are ready. The sooner your team deploys those beacons, the sooner we can get the location of the disc.

How you deploy your forces is up to you--and Travard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Welcome back! [[Eternus]] said there was a signal from your beacon, so I assume everything went smoothly?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Travard|All right, people. Form up. [[Talthis]], [[Valunei]]... Take the right portal.}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|Aye, Captain!}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|For [[Tyr]]!}}
:''Talthis and Valunei run into the [[Black Empire: Primordial Azeroth]] portal.''
:{{Text|say|Travard|[[Hadwin]], [[Nolaki]]... take the left portal.}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|Aw, you put me with this brute again?}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|Brute? Oh, I see how it is. Yeah, well this brute will kill more of whatever's behind that portal than you.}}
:''Nolaki and Hadwin run into the [[Ordering of Azeroth: Firelord's Fall]] portal.''
:{{Text|say|Travard|[[Koranos]], I think it's best you stay behind and guard the portal with our [[dragon]] friends. But <name>? You and I are going straight down the middle.}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Good luck, Travard. Good luck, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|For Tyr!}}
:''Travard runs into the [[Temple of Order: Winterskorn War]] portal.''

Follow Travard. On the other side of the portal, Travard is working on the Beacon Activation. Approach him:
:{{Text|say|Travard|This is [[Tyr]]'s Temple of Order!}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Be on your guard, <name>. There's no way to know what we'll find here.}}

:''Travard works on the beacon...''
*{{Text|say|Travard|Eternus demonstrated for me how the beacons worked. Just a moment.}}
*{{Text|say|Travard|These steps on it are written in common, but they might as well be Thalassian for what sense they make.}}
*{{Text|say|Travard|"Just Press the button," Eternus said. But where is the button?}}
*{{Text|say|Travard|I recognize these contructs. They're [[Loken]]'s creations, I'm sure of it. No good can come of this place.}}
*{{Text|say|Travard|I'll get the beacon activated. You keep these "[[servants of Loken]]" busy.}}
*{{Text|say|Travard|That racket you're making keeps making me lose my train of thought.}}
*{{Text|say|Travard|I've almost got it, <name>. Keep them away just a bit longer!}}

When pulled or slain, [[Clockwork Sapper (Temple of Order)|Clockwork Sappers]], [[Stormforged Tactician (Temple of Order)|Stormforged Tacticians]], [[Titanium Vanguard (Temple of Order)|Titanium Vanguards]], and [[Winterskorn Vrykul]] say one of the following lines:
*{{Text|say|Clockwork Sapper|Terminating!}}
*{{Text|say|Stormforged Tactician|Loken's will be done!}}
*{{Text|say|Titanium Vanguard|Access to the temple is forbidden.}}
*{{Text|say|Stormforged Tactician|Loken's will be done!}}
*{{Text|say|Clockwork Sapper|This unit has failed the [[Odyn|Prime Designate]].}}
*{{Text|say|Clockwork Sapper|Curse of flesh infection vector detected!}}
*{{Text|say|Clockwork Sapper|Defeat... acknowledged.}}
*{{Text|say|Loken's servants will stop you.}}
*{{Text|say|Loken's will is eternal!}}
*{{Text|say|The Prime Designate will prevail!}}
*{{Text|say|The Prime Designate insists you leave this site.}}

Objective complete:
:{{Text|say|Travard|Thanks for watching my back, <name>. I'll be honest. I wasn't sure if I was going to get that beacon to work.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Let's get back to Tyrhold. Hopefully the Tyr's Guard will be waiting.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Chromie|You're back! Did you activate your beacon?}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|After some difficulties, yes.}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|Another beacon set! Give me three, my friend!}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|I'll give you five and you can keep the change!}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Perhaps we should not yet celebrate. Valunei and Talthis have not returned.}}
:{{Text|say|Eternus|Koranos is right. There's no signal from the third beacon.}}

==Progression==
{{Reforging the Tyr's Guard}}
