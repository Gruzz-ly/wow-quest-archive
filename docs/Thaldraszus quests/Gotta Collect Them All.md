==Objectives==
Get Yumadormu's deck back.
*Confront [[Setogosa]]
*[[Waterlogged Card]] (30)

==Description==
<Class>, do you mind helping me get my cards back?

I told [[Setogosa]] I need them to show other students how to play [[Hearthstone (game)#Lore|Hearthstone]]. I want to form a club, but she's not giving them back!

She's always been rude to me, but this is taking it further than normal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*10,250 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I got a few of the cards out myself, have you gotten the rest yet?

==Completion==
Thank the [[Dragon Aspects|aspects]]! Most of these are still in one piece.

I figured out a way to reverse time on the cards using bronze magic and get them back to mint condition!

==Notes==
;Speaking with Setogosa
:You seriously think YOU can take these cards away from me by asking...

:{{Gossip|Yes}}
:{{Gossip|No}}
:{{Gossip|<Stay Silent>}}

:{{Text|say|Setogosa|Say goodbye to your precious cards!}}
:''Setogosa tosses the deck into the nearby river.''
:{{Text|yell|Yumadormu yells: NOOOOOO! My cards!}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|Why would you do that!?!}}
:{{Text|say|Setogosa|You should be thanking me, you are nothing but a mediocre player, with a even worse deck.}}
:''Setogosa reverts to her dragon form and flies away.''
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|I hope some of my cards are recoverable.}}
:{{Text|say|Yumadormu|I am going to experiment on restoring the quality of some of the cards. Do you mind gathering the rest of my deck for me?}}

Some of the cards are on the bottom, others are looted from [[Ravenous Riversnapper]]s.
