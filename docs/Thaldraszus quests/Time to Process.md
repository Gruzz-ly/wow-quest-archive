==Objectives==
Invite [[Tyr]] to join the [[Tyr's Guard]] at [[Tyr's Rest]].
*Speak to Tyr
*Speak with [[Travard]]

==Description==
Tyr is back after thousands of years. I don't even know how many thousands. His world has changed more than we can even imagine. He's going to have many questions and need answers.

Meanwhile, there's nothing any of the Tyr's Guard would rather do than talk with Tyr. Tyr's Rest seems like the perfect place to give him time, answer questions, and process those answers. Would you ask him to join us there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
*[[Dragon Isles Drakes: White Scales]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
*[[Of the Tyr's Guard]]

==Progress==
We certainly live in interesting times, <name>...

==Completion==
It is so good to be able to talk with Tyr directly. We have so much to tell him, and I know we all want to ask him questions.

Thank you for making this possible, <name>!

==Notes==
Speak to Tyr:
:Yes, mortal?

:{{Gossip|quest=|The Tyr's Guard would be honored if you would join them at their headquarters.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|Certainly, <name>. I owe my restoration to you and the Tyr's Guard.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|I would be glad to accompany you, Travard. Lead the way.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Excellent. Tyr's Guard, with me!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nozdormu]]|I will report your return to the other [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]], but we will speak soon, old friend.}}

All but [[Chromie]] and [[Eternus]] walk away. Head to the headquarters. Speak with the present company for their thoughts.

;[[Valunei]]'s gossip
:Thank you for your help on this journey, <name>! What an exciting time for [[Azeroth|the world]], having a titan [[keeper]] back among us.

:I can't help but anticipate what a place Azeroth will become now that Tyr walks our world once again. I feel... hopeful.

;[[Hadwin]]'s gossip
:The [[Order of Embers]] never mentioned Tyr, but... The silver weaponry they used fighting the [[Drust]], They{{sic}} remind me of Tyr's [[Silver hand|Silver Hand]].

:Now I wonder... is there a connection?

:Maybe. I was always taught to look towards the dawn. Even in the darkest parts of [[Drustvar]], a glimmer of light is all you need to push back the shadows. Tyr is like that. A light in the darkness.

;[[Talthis]]' gossip
:I asked Tyr what wrongs he planned on righting first in this world. The chaos in [[Northrend]]? Or the [[Broken Isles]]?[[Quel'Thalas]]{{sic}}?

:His response surprised me, truthfully. He said he must order his own mind and learn about this new world before "intruding" out into it.

:Logical, I suppose. But somewhat disappointing. I expected him to have all the answers. But perhaps that is asking too much.

;[[Nolaki]]'s gossip
:I followed in the footsteps of the Great Mother, [[Torcali]], my whole life. [[Valunei]] has followed her [[Xe'ra|Prime Naaru]] even longer.

:We are of such different faiths, yet we have a great bond that come outta following our new beliefs.

:I have much to learn--from Valunei, my fellow Tyr's Guards, and of course the man Tyr himself.

;[[Koranos]]' gossip
:It is so good to see Keeper Tyr again. It has been many thousands of years since he has been at work in [[Tyrhold]].

:It was he who forged us. I wonder if now he will forge new [[Titanic watcher|watchers]]?

;[[Alexstrasza]]'s gossip
:[[Fyrakk]] is defeated, [[Amirdrassil|the tree]] is safe, the Aspects are renewed, and our friend has returned. I cannot remember when the world last seemed so right.

;[[Justicar Julia Celeste]]'s gossip
:For a group that Travard pulled together in such a short time, it is wondrous to see what they have accomplished--with your help, I understand, <name>.

:I wonder what the future holds for them?

;[[Vindicator Boros]]' gossip
:Incredible! I am so glad to see they were able to restore Tyr.

:This can only be a good thing for our world and for the [[Knights of the Silver Hand|Silver Hand]]!

;Keeper Tyr's gossip
:What would you ask of me, <name>?

:{{Gossip|I saw your battle against [[Zakajz]]. Do you think we're finally free of the [[Black Empire]]?}}
::I believe my victory was decisive, but the Black Empire and its forces are insidious.

::I am sure there will be more battles to wage ahead.

::The Tyr's Guard and I will be ready to confront their forces wherever they may reappear.

::{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
:{{Gossip|What can you tell me about the [[titan]]s?}}
::The titans are beings of unfathomable wisdom. They empowered we{{sic}} keepers to fight chaos.

::As a result, they are responsible for much of the good that exists.

::But even as a keeper, I was not privy to their end goal. Nor can I yet fathom it.

::I serve them always, but I fear I cannot tell you much more than you already know.

::{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
:{{Gossip|Can you tell me about other ancient battles you've fought?}}
::I have fought in many great battles, <name>.

::[[War between the titans and the Old Gods|I fought with my brethren against the Black Empire]] that once ruled Azeroth.

::I fought the [[elemental lord]], [[Ragnaros]], with Prime Designate [[Odyn]].

::With the help of intelligent [[proto-dragon]]s, I fought [[Galakrond]]. Which is when I lost my hand.

::My final war was against Keeper [[Loken]] and his forces when he betrayed us. The end of that battle, you know.

::I have been in many battles as an instrument of war. Let us speak of... lighter things.

::{{Gossip|I have another question.}}

Speak to Travard:
:I remember seeing Tyr depicted in the [[Alonsus Chapel|Stratholme Cathedral]]. Until now, he's only lived in our legends.

:Seeing him here... Those depictions pale in comparison.

:I struggle to find the proper words, <name>.

:There is so much good we can yet do. And we have you to thank for it.

:{{Gossip|quest=|You're welcome, Travard.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Tyr, we each have dedicated our lives to serving you and your memory. I must ask you... what is your will?}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|My will? It is to continue the titans' mission... Forgive me, where are the [[vrykul]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|They exist, but they are us. I--a [[human]]--descended from them. Many [[race]]s coexist here on Azeroth. And in the Tyr's Guard.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|Yes, I see you have a [[troll]] in your ranks and a...}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Nolaki, yes. And a [[draenei]], Valunei.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|I have much to learn, it seems. That is my will then. You will be my guides.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Oh, um. Yes, we'd be honored!}}

Completing this quest also awards [[Of the Tyr's Guard]].
