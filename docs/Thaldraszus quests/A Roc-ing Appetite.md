==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Hawthia Roc-Muncher.jpg|Hawthia Roc-Muncher|A particularly large Screechflight harpy with a gruesome appetite for Bluefeather bones.}}
Slay Hawthia Roc-Muncher.
*[[Hawthia Roc-Muncher|Hawthia Roc Muncher]] slain

==Description==
[[Segallia]] seems like a good egg, good with gadgets, but she panics easily.

For example: When I sent her into the caves directly south of here, she was promptly run out of them by an unusually large [[harpy]]. Seems it was giving orders to the others as well.

Could it be the [[Matriarch Avethyra|Matriarch]] of this brood? Perhaps a [[Commander (rank)|commander]] of some kind? Get in there and find out, <name>.

And don't be afraid to ruffle a few feathers, if you know what I mean.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
[[Aviana]] has helped the humanoid races out a lot since her resurrection.

You think any harpies resent her for it?

==Completion==
My fine-tuned bird senses are telling me these [[Screechflight]] aren't just here for snacks...

But you did well, <name>! Let me decipher [[Screechflight Scroll|this scroll]] and we'll find out just what these harpies are after.

==Notes==
Enter the cave with two entrances on the opposite side and find Hawthia on the far end next to [[Feather-Plucker 3300 Gears]], broken roc eggs, and dead [[Bluefeather Roc|Bluefeathers]].

;Aggro Hawthia
:{{Text|say|Hawthia Roc-Muncher|Our brood won't be ended by the likes of YOU!}}

Hawthia killed
:{{Text|say|Hawthia Roc-Muncher|Forgive me, Matriarch! I gave everything to keep our dream alive...}}

She also drops [[Screechflight Scroll]] which starts [[Rolling in the Screech]].

==Progression==
