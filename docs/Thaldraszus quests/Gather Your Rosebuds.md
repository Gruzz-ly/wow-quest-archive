==Objectives==
Collect 3 of each color of Flight Flower in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Azure Lily]] (3)
*[[Time-Touched Daisy]] (3)
*[[Viridian Bloom]] (3)
*[[Ruby Blossom]] (3)
*[[Obsidian Iris]] (3)

==Description==
[[Emberthal]] is quite troubled. It reminds me of a [[Chromie|certain bronze dragon]] when she chose her [[visage]] form.

Not to worry! Once Emberthal has returned, we shall throw a proper [[Visage Day]] celebration.

The fireworks are to match the colors of the [[dragonflight]]s.

Each enclave of the city grows special flowers in accordance with that enclave's flight.

Three of each color should be enough for the first batch of fireworks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,500 [[XP]]
*[[Basket of Draconic Flowers]]

==Progress==
We still require more flowers if we are to provide a celebration worthy of dragons.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. This should be sufficient.

==Notes==
Visit the city's enclaves. The Sapphire Enclave has {{item|Azure Lily|Azure Lilies}}, the [[Obsidian Enclave]] has [[Obsidian Iris]], the [[Ruby Enclave]] has {{item|Ruby Blossom|s}}, the [[Emerald Enclave]] has {{item|Viridian Bloom|s}}, and the [[Bronze Enclave]] has {{item|Time-Touched Daisy|Time-Touched Daisies}}.
