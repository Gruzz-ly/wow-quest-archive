Wow, that was incredible! The three day journey with the Emperor of Pandaria and his band of heroes was really the highlight.

Thanks for letting me stretch my wings, <name>. I'll take it from here.

==Notes and trivia==
Speak with Chromie:

{{book|Chromie|content=
{{Gossip|quest=|Why can't you do these tasks?}}

Me? Oh, no! I have to give out tasks, offer advice, open up the portal, those sorts of things.

*{{Gossip|I could do all that.}}
*{{Gossip|If you want to go on an adventure, I can do all that for you.}}

Oh. Wow, really? It would be nice to stretch my wings a bit.

Thanks <name>, that would be great!

{{Gossip|Off you go. Have fun.}}
}}

A Time Rift portal appears and the adventurer receives a [[Task List for Adventurers]] as well as the classic quest marker over their head.
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Sori, do you want to come on an adventure with me?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Soridormi]]|My, that does sound like a wondrous time. I shall.}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Yay! Here's a list of all the tasks that need doing, <name>. See you soon!}}
:''They take the portal. A group of adventurers enters the inn.''
:{{Text|say|[[Adventurer Diani]]|Rugan, you pick up the quest and share it with us.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Adventurer Rugan]]|Pick up your own quest. Why do I always have to pick up the quest?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Adventurer Krinthor]]|You like to pretend we're more than killers for hire.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Rugan|We are more than killers for hire! We saved a whole village earlier!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Adventurer Mithalder]]|By killing things.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Rugan|A small child gave you her favorite toy as a reward!}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Mithalder|Couldn't even put it in my toy box. Worst reward ever.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Rugan|I hate you guys.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Diani|Aw, we love you too.}}

::Note that if you have previously completed this quest, a third dialogue option will appear for all adventurers that you interact with.

The adventurers all have gossip:
{{book|Adventurer Diani|content=
<Diani stifles a yawn behind her hand.>

You'll want to talk to Rugan.

And don't let his grumpy face deceive you. We love him, really. We just like to rile him up. It's so easy!
}}

{{book|Adventurer Mithalde|content=
Hey. You'll want to talk to Rugan.

<Mithalder looks around.>

Nice inn you have here. It looks like the kind of inn you can find anywhere. Maybe... everywhere?
}}

{{book|Adventurer Krinthor|content=
<Krinthor leans in and whispers to you.>

Don't tell Rugan, but I'm actually looking forward to this quest.

<Krinthor straightens up and raises his voice.>

Hey don't talk to me, talk to Rugan.

<You hear a groan from Rugan's direction.>
}}

{{book|Adventurer Rugan|content=
Hail oh wise and brave hero. We have come from--

<Diani coughs loudly and makes a get-on-with-it motion with her hands.>

Our brave band... of adventurers...

<Krinthor starts humming very loudly.>

Fine. Fine! What quests do you have for us?

*{{Gossip|<Explain the task in full.>}}
*{{Gossip|<Summarize the task.>}}
*{{Gossip|<Stand up for Rugan.>}}
}}

If a full explanation was offered:
:{{Text|say|<Name>|You will be helping [[Queen Azshara|Queen Aszhara]]{{sic}} form the city of [[Zin-Azshari]].}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Throughout your journey you will get to know the ins and outs of the queen and her entire court.}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|There might even be a romance if you play your cards right.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Mithalder|Oh, nice! Dibs on the romance.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Rugan|You don't even know who it's with yet.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Mithalder|Hey, I'm a lover and a fighter.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Krinthor|Hah!}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Diani|Rawr!}}

If the summary was offered:
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Step through the portal. Kill anything that moves.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Diani|Wow, they aren't even trying today. Nice!}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Rugan|Why did you have to encourage them?}}

If you stand up for [[Rugan]]:
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Hey! You three be nicer to Rugan.}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Life is hard enough without you hassling him.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Mithalder|Sorry, Rugan.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Krinthor|Sorry, Rugan.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Diani|Sorry, Rugan.}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Ok, now on with the quest. You'll understand once you step through the portal.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Rugan|Thanks for saying that.}}
:{{Text|say|Adventurer Mithalder|Chromie's never mean to us...}}

Either way, the adventurers enter a Time Rift and [[Johnny Awesome]] arrives at the inn:
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|Fear not people! Your prayers have been answered!}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|I, Johnny Awesome, have decided to come to your... what is this? An inn?}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|Come to your inn and save, and or assist, you with your troubles.}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|Assuming the reward is good, of course.}}

{{book|Johnny Awesome|content=
<Johnny doesn't look at you and is instead flicking through what appears to be a book of hairstyles.>

What's the reward for this quest? I don't get out of bed for anything less than a [[mount]].

*{{Gossip|Fifty gold and a pat on the head.}}
:Hah, you're joking of course. As if you could ever bring yourself to mess up this immaculate hair with a pat on the head.
:What's the quest?

*{{Gossip|Err... It's a mount? No, wait, seven mounts!}}
:Seven mounts? I feel like you might be pulling my leg, but I can't take that chance.
:What's the quest?

*{{Gossip|It's so unique, I can't put it into words.}}
:Oh. Oh my.
:Is it a custom title? No, wait, a rare coloured pet? Oh oh, maybe it's a new type of dragon riding mount?
:I'm in. What's the quest?

*{{Gossip|<Explain the task in full.>}}
*{{Gossip|<Summarize the task.>}}
*{{Gossip|<Admonish Johnny Awesome.>}}
}}

If attempting to explain the task in full:
:{{Text|say|<Name>|I need you to--}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|Skip!}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|As if it matters what the details are.}}

If attempting to summarize:
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Kill anything--}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|Skip!}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|As if it matters what the details are.}}

If you admonish [[Johnny Awesome]]:
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Don't you dare skip me describing the quest! It's incredibly rude.}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|I... I would never do that! Please, tell me the details.}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Go through the portal and collect ten pristine boar entrails. We need them for tonight's stew.}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|Is there a mount in this for me?}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|No.}}
:{{Text|say|Johnny Awesome|Okay...}}

Either way, Johhny enters the Time Rift, and [[Aeonormu]] enters the inn:
:{{Text|say|Aeonormu|Chromie! Soridormi! We just received word that--wait. Where have they gone?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Bartender Bob]]|<Name> is in charge now. Talk to them.}}

{{book|Aeonormu|content=
We just got reports of a new time anomaly!

A time ripple has caused the [[titan]]s to not visit [[Azeroth]]. We need adventurers to convince them to journey here. They will work closely with the titans in their battle against the [[Old God|old gods]], and get to know them really well.

We estimate it will take roughly two years for an adventurer to complete this, as they travel across proto-Azeroth and deal with roughly three large scale enemy strongholds.

*{{Gossip|You look like an adventurer to me.}}
*{{Gossip|I'm sure you can deal with it.}}
Me? I am not experienced in such things, but I am ready to rise to the challenge! 

What advice do you have for me?

*{{Gossip|<Give elaborate advice.>}}
*{{Gossip|<Give quick advice.>}}
}}

For elaborate advice:
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Once there, meet with important looking people.}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Build your [[reputation]] with them. Perform tasks they ask of you.}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Help them build a better world.}}
:{{Text|say|Aeonormu|Oh, wow. And you do this sort of thing all the time? That's incredible.}}
:{{Text|say|Aeonormu|Alright! Titans, here I come!}}

For quick advice:
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Punch bad things in the face until they die from it.}}
:{{Text|say|Aeonormu|Just... punch things in the face?}}
:{{Text|say|Aeonormu|Alright. I think I can do that.}}

If you choose the third option
*{{Gossip|<Talk like a Bronze Dragon.>}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|We meet here. Once again.}}
:{{Text|say|Aeonormu|Yes... This all feels familiar.}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|You know what you need to do.}}
:{{Text|say|Aeonormu|Yes. I have done it before.}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|And you will do again.}}

Either way, Aenormu enters the time rift and a group of [[niffen]] arrives at the inn:
:{{Text|say|[[Daffydil]]|We're in the big leagues now, Mel. Game face on.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Melati]]|Wow, this place is so pretty! What do you think they do in here?}}
:{{Text|say|Daffydil|Don't be silly. There's so much stuff on the walls. This is clearly some sort of museum.}}
:{{Text|say|Melati|Yeah, that makes sense. What do you think, Pipsee?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Pipsee]]|<Pipsee squeaks!>}}
:{{Text|say|Melati|Huh, that's actually a good point.}}
:{{Text|say|Daffydil|Pipsee don't know what she's talking about!}}
:{{Text|say|Melati|Aw, poor Pipsee! Don't listen to mean Daffy.}}

{{book|Pipse|content=
<Pipsee looks at you with curiosity.>
}}

{{book|Melati|content=
Hi there! It's so interesting up here.

You've been outside lately? I've never seen a cavern ceiling so high up! Who do you think painted it blue?
}}

If players had completed enough Niffen tasks, Melati has this gossip instead:
{{book|Melati|content=
Oh hi there, <name>!

You're the whole reason Daffy and I are here. And look, Pipsee is super excited to see you too! Do you want give her some cheese?

{{gossip|<Take the cheese>}}
}}

The player receives some [[Smelly Cheese]]. Speak with Pipsee:
{{book|Pipsee|content=
<Pipsee wiggles with joy when she sees you.>

{{gossip|<Offer Pipsee the smelly cheese.>}}
}}

:{{text|emote|Pipsee wiggles with joy.}}
:{{text|say|Melati|Oh boy, Pipsee sure liked that!}}

{{book|Daffydil|content=
We were told that this was the place to come help out?

Mel and I decided we should see more of the world. There's... a lot of it.

*{{Gossip|<Explain the task in full.>}}
*{{Gossip|<Summarize the task.>}}
*{{Gossip|<Explain this is an inn.>}}
}}

If players have completed enough Niffen tasks, Daffydil has this gossip instead:
{{book|Daffydil|content=
<Name>? Oh wow, fancy meeting you here! Mel and I decided we should see more of the world after we met you.

Do you have anything we can do?

*{{Gossip|<Explain the task in full.>}}
*{{Gossip|<Summarize the task.>}}
*{{Gossip|<Explain this is an inn.>}}
}}

With either of the first two explanations:
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Step through the portal, eat food, hit things in the face.}}
:{{Text|say|Daffydil|Fighting time, huh? Let's go!}}
:{{Text|say|Melati|I hope we don't have to hit them too hard!}}

If you explain this is an inn.
:{{Text|say|<Name>|Actually, this is an inn. Not a museum.}}
:{{Text|say|Melati|Pipsee was right!}}
:{{Text|say|Daffydil|That was a lucky guess.}}
:{{Text|say|Melati|No! You admit Pipsee was right!}}
:{{Text|say|Daffydil|Okay, okay. Pipsee, you were right. Anyway, what is the quest?}}
:{{Text|say|<Name>|It's best you step through the portal and find out for yourself.}}
:{{Text|say|Pipsee|<Pipsee squeaks!>}}
:''The niffen enter the Time Rift. Shortly thereafter, Chromie and Soridormi return.''
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Wow! What an adventure.}}
:{{Text|say|Soridormi|I certainly enjoyed myself.}}

This quest is a callback to [[Welcome to the Machine]], a similar quest where Horde players took on the role of quest giver in the [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] and is full of fourth-wall breaking references such as the overview of an expansion that takes two years and has three raids.
