==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Bluescale.png|Bluescale|Leader of the Embertooth. Not much for negotiations.}}
Slay Bluescale.
*[[Bluescale]] slain

==Description==
The [[Embertooth]] all follow an oversized brute that I've taken to calling Bluescale. He has always been the aggressive sort, but until now he's always kept his pack of scavengers away from the main roads. Sure, they were territorial, but hostile? Not until now.

Bluescale has to be responsible for this sudden escalation. Find him and take him down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with the [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Be careful, <class>. Bluescale is tougher than your average [[Tarasek]] scavenger.

==Completion==
With Bluescale taken care of, I doubt we will have to deal with any organized tarasek encroachment any time soon.

Now all that's left is to deal with the poison.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
