==Objectives==
Search for [[:Lord Basilton]] in the Garden Shed by cleaning up Piles of Junk.
*Lord Basilton Located {{co|38.9|74.2|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
Basilton! Lord Basilton, where are you?

My executive assistant and apprentice, Lord Basilton, has gone missing! He loves to explore, but he's even worse at defending himself than I am. I'm a gardener, not a warrior!

Could you please go find that layabout? I need him here so I can think. He's usually in the shed, digging through piles of junk.

Be careful though. He can be a bit prickly at first.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
At my age, an executive assistant is a necessity.

==Completion==
Ah, there he is! My lovely assistant. Who's a good boy? A good, spiky boy? Basilton! Who's the spikiest? That's right! You are!

Ahem. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Enter the tower to the northeast, littered with doodads of various types - [[Storage Crates]], [[Ruined Barrel]], [[Garden Junk]], [[Scrap Wood]], and [[Pile of Leaves (Thaldraszus)|Pile of Leaves]]. One pile of junk is hiding a Bronze Stopwatch, which starts [[One Drakonid's Junk]]. Clear the rest of the debris and [[Lord Basilton]] will pop out of hiding:
:{{text|say|Lord Basilton|Squeak squeak!!}}
:''Basilton runs down the path in the direction of Gryrmpech.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Lord Basilton|Squeak!!!}}

==Progression==
{{Gardens of Unity}}
