==Objectives==
Bring the [[:Hole-Punched Bakar Tooth]] to [[Eadweard Dalyngrigge]] at the [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]].

==Description==
<This milk-tooth came from a young bakar, though the way the bone has yellowed suggests it's thousands of years old.

Someone has carefully drilled a hole at the top of this tooth to turn it into a bead. Upon closer examination, the tattered remains of a woolen cord can still be seen threaded through it.

Eadweard would know how to preserve this find and figure out whom it might belong to.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* 100x [[Mysterious Fragment]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Completion==
Aha! A curious find. I shall reach out to the appropriate parties immediately, and we can have it documented and returned to its home post-haste.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Ah, such a sentimental trinket! And a reminder of the tragedy that befell our caravan find.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|There are few bonds stronger in this world than that of a centaur and their bakar. One's canine friend losing their baby teeth continues to be cause for celebration.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Simple as its construction may be, one need only examine the remnants of string still threaded through the hole to see the care and quality of materials given to this item.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|This fine tradition of commemorating the occasion with jewelry persists to this day, though modern craftsmanship is of course more intricate.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|I have seen all manner of bangles and circlets made from bakar teeth, even musical instruments! They do have a lovely percussive quality when bunched together.}}
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|I'm sure this one will have a place of honor in Maruukai. I shall make contact with my colleagues there and see it returned.}}
