'''The Never-Final Countdown''' concludes the "Time Management" chapter of the [[Thaldraszus storyline]]. The final chapter of the campaign begins with [[Tumbling Through Time]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Chromie]] when ready.
*Speak to Chromie

==Description==
I never thought I'd save [[Temporal Conflux|our temple]] by dismantling the very security we set up to protect it, but here we are!

With the [[time elemental]]s purged, our [[Timewalkers]] free, and our Wardens at the ready, it's finally time to let this last stasis bubble down and deal with [[Eternus]].

Let me know when you're ready. I know with you by my side nothing can go wrong.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|90|50}}
* 2,550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Eternus and Chromie have fallen through space and [[time]]. We must retrieve them at all costs!

==Notes==
Speak with Chromie again:
:Are you ready? This ball full of infinite anger is getting heavier by the millisecond!

:{{gossip|{{text|rare|<Tell Chromie you're ready.>}}}}

An in-engine cutscene starts:
{{#ev:youtube|GCIJrzB-sIk}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|Okay everyone!}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|Get ready!}}
:''The stasis bubble fades and Chromie unleashes a breath attack on Eternus. Eternus recovers, roars, and starts channeling a spell on the Bronze Oathstone.''
:{{text|say|Chromie|Oh no you don't!}}
:''Chromie divebombs Eternus to interrupt the infinite, and the explosion whites out the screen. Left behind is a time portal that quickly fades. [[Nozdormu]] and [[Soridormi]] land offscreen with a thump and shift back to their humanoid form, walking toward the oathstone.''
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|My vision came too late.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|They have punched a tunnel through time and are tumbling endlessly amongst the infinite possibilities.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|You must find them and correct their course before the entire fabric of reality is torn asunder.}}

[[Archivist Areniel]] offers two optional side quests: [[An Anomalous Shrine]] and [[Entropic Remnants]].
