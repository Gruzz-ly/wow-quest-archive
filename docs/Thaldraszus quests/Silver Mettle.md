'''Silver Mettle''' starts the "Tyr's Fall" questline as part of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]]. Players must have completed [[The Silver Purpose]] for [[Friend of the Dragon Isles]] to be eligible for this quest. Find [[Nozdormu]] at [[Tyrhold]] in [[Thaldraszus]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Venture into the [[Tomb of Tyr]] with the aid of [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]].
*Confirm the plan to restore [[Tyr]]
*Use the [[Portal to Tomb of Tyr|portal to the tomb of Tyr]]
*Approach [[Travard]]

==Description==
I believe the [[:Silver Scale]] may still be of some use to us. During my observations, I felt an... energy in it that transcends [[time]] and seems to be attuned to Tyr. It also has the same architecture as the disc.

It stands to reason we may use the Silver Scale to collect one of Tyr's memories that he did not commit to the disc.

Though it seems macabre, going to his tomb in [[Tirisfal Glades|Tirisfal]] may allow us to at least partially restore him.

[[Alexstrasza]] can tell you more, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I do not wish to startle the man with my... presence. Perhaps it would be best if you approached him first.

==Completion==
This place is a monument to Tyr's legacy. We must proceed with caution and reverence.

==Notes==
On approach to [[Nozdormu]], [[Alexstrasza]], [[Kalecgos]], and [[Watcher Koranos]] at [[Tyrhold]]:
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|<Name>, thank you for returning to [[Tyrhold]] so quickly.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|I have appraised everyone else gathered here of my findings, but I need your assistance.}}

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|If you are correct, Nozdormu, then... perhaps we will have Tyr's aid against the [[Infinite dragonflight|infinites]].}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I must ask your help again, <name>. [[Koranos]], will you accompany them? Your knowledge of [[titan]] [[technology]] may aid us.}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Of course. I will do all that I can for Tyr's return.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You have given us hope, Nozdormu. But now we must act.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Take the Silver Scale to Tyr's tomb. Collect what memories you can find there. We must get Tyr back.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Kalecgos]]|Allow me to speed you on your way.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Good luck, <name>!}}

Take the portal to the Tomb of Tyr that Kalecgos summons:
:''The adventurer and Koranos appear in the [[Vestibule of the Silver Hand]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].''
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Someone guards this place... That symbol... is that the Silver Hand?}}

Approach Travard:
:{{Text|emote|The [[Damaged Titan Matrix]] retreats as if startled by your entrance.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Blasted machines! Why have you cast me out?}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Hmph...}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|We do not mean to alarm you, [[paladin]]... We are here on an important mission. For Tyr.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|For Tyr? I am Travard, [[Captain (rank)|Captain]] of [[Tyr's Guard]]. My vigil is to watch over Tyr's tomb. Who are you?}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|I am Koranos, a [[titan watcher]]. And this is my friend, <name>. We endeavor to awaken Tyr.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Awaken... Tyr? How... how will this miracle be accomplished?}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|With your help, I hope. But first we must enter the tomb.}}
