==Description==
The gateways closed, the [[elemental]]s slain, and the [[Primalists]] stopped... for now.

<Sharnax laughs.>

Is there anything we cannot do, <class>? I guess only time will tell.

Take the plans back to the commander. I am certain he will be glad to see we have been successful.

* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +24 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
<Thadezus stares at you.>

What do you want, <class>?

==Completion==
<Thadezus pauses for an uncomfortable amount of time.>

[[Scaletender Allis|Allis]] and I had bets on if you would be successful, <class>{{sic}}

I am glad that you were.
