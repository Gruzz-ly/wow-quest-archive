==Description==
Oh, no... I've made a huge mistake.

[[Harleen Chirpsnide|Harleen]] entrusted me with the famed [[:Feather-Plucker 3300]], a phenomenal invention of her very own!

I was planning to pluck [[roc]] feathers in the cave south of here for her research, but the [[Harpy|harpies]] ambushed me and it broke into pieces as I was running out.

Please retrieve the parts! They're probably strewn about like shed scales on the cave floor.

I can put it back together. Definitely. Well, probably.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
I was so desperate to prove myself!

==Completion==
Oh, thank [[Dragonflight|the flights]]!

I've come to like the professor, and this could have spelled the end of our new friendship!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Segallia|I was very lost, so the parts are probably far away from each other. Sorry!}}

Enter the cave with two entrances on the opposite side and find the items lying on the ground.
