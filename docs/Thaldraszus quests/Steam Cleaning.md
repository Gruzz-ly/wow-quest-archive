==Objectives==
Kill 12 elementals in the lower spa.
*[[Elemental]]s Slain (12)

==Description==
[[Xijan Thornpaw|Xijan]] seems to think the elemental invasion on [[Serene Dreams Spa|our beautiful spa]] is only a minor problem, but this surge of flame and steam needs to be brought under control immediately.

We had booked musical acts to play in the lower area, but the elementals destroyed their gear. As we have never had such levels of elemental destruction in this area before, I suspect [[Primalists|Primalist]] influences.

If you want to help, clear the elementals on the east side of the lower spa. That is where the first events are scheduled.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
We need those elementals pushed back!

==Completion==
A good start, but there are still far too many for my liking...

==Notes==
Head below and kill [[Steam Scaulder]]s and [[Flame Blister]]s. The elite [[Mudgatu]] also counts, and killing it also starts the optional quest [[Derelict Fashion]].

==Progression==
{{Serene Dreams Spa}}
