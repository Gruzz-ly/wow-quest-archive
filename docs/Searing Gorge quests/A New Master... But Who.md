== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Gravius Grimesilt.jpg||Master Grimesilt should know what's happening with the Dark Irons.}}
Obtain the Dark Iron Memo from {{NPC||Gravius Grimesilt}} at [[Grimesilt Dig Site|Grimesilt Worksite]].
*[[Dark Iron Memo]]

== Description ==
<Race>! You've arrived just in time.

Here's the skinny: The [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron dwarves]] in [[Searing Gorge|the gorge]] have begun acting strangely, and the [[Thorium Brotherhood]] intends to find out why. {{NPC||Overseer Oilfist}} doesn't like surprises.

We suspect they're following orders from some new leader. I have reason to suspect that Gravius Grimesilt, just south of here, knows who it is.

Even here in Searing Gorge we've begun to hear tales of your exploits, <name>. You should have no problem with Grimesilt.

== Progress ==
Any news?

== Completion ==
Let's see... {{NPC||Overseer Maltorius}}... we're quite familiar with him and his work.

What's this? The "archduke"? That sounds promising.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Rockhead Helm|Oilfist Globe|Jack's Lucky Charm}}

You will also receive: {{cost||70}}

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Lunk's Task]] and [[The Fewer, the Better]] before heading out. The note reads:

{{Book|Dark Iron Memo|content=Gravius.

Starting today, you are to redouble your efforts. The scope of our project has expanded severalfold. Your archaeological studies and geological studies can wait.

Moving forward, you are to dig downward as quickly as possible. Crews within the [[Slag Pit]] will be working from the other direction to connect their tunnels to yours. The underground empire of the Dark Iron dwarves is growing, Gravius, and we are at the forefront.


Succeed in this task, and you will be rewarded. You should know, these orders do not come from me, but from {{NPC||Overseer Maltorius}} and the archduke themselves.

Dig deep,<br/>{{NPC||Dig-Boss Dinwhisker}}}}
