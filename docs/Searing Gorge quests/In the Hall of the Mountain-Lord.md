== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Mountain-Lord Rendan}} at [[Iron Summit]] in [[Searing Gorge]].

== Description ==
The [[Thorium Brotherhood]] doesn't maintain a militia - just a few guards, and me, and that's it.  If we're to successfully strike against the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] of the gorge, we're gonna need help.

Mountain-Lord Rendan sits atop that tower across the gorge, to our south.  He doesn't consort with the [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight]] folks or [[fire elemental]]s, but he hasn't joined the brotherhood either.  Maybe it's time we paid him a visit.  With his help, we might just stand a chance.

== Completion ==
And who might you be?

Ah, an emissary from the Thorium Brotherhood. They're looking for my support? Fine, I might be willin' to help out...

...for a price.

== Notes ==
Exit Thorium Point and circle around the [[Cauldron]] heading toward [[Blackrock Mountain]]. Take a left, to the east, and head up the hill to reach the top of Iron Summit.

== Trivia ==
The name of the quest is inspired by {{wplink|In the Hall of the Mountain King}}, a piece of orchestral music by {{wplink|Edvard Grieg}} that has achieved iconic status in popular culture.
