'''To the Aid of the Thorium Brotherhood''' is a quest introducing the player to both the [[Searing Gorge]] area and the reputation faction [[Thorium Brotherhood]]. It is the starting quest for the Searing Gorge quest chain along with the quests [[Hero's Call: Searing Gorge!]] and [[Warchief's Command: Searing Gorge!]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Jack Rockleg]] at [[Thorium Advance]] in [[Searing Gorge]].

==Description==
[[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] may be scheming and mischievous... but they're not all enemies. I've spoken several times with the dwarves of the [[Thorium Brotherhood]], and they've never been anything but helpful.

An acquaintance of mine, [[Jack Rockleg]], came to town not long ago, asking if I could join him on an expedition of some sort. It sounded important.

I'm a little busy, but maybe you wouldn't mind going? Just travel west, on the road to Searing Gorge. You'll see him soon after leaving the [[Badlands]].

*{{cost||7|}}
