==Objectives==
Obtain 16 Dark Iron Pillows.
*[[Dark Iron Pillow]] (16)

==Description==
It's a little known fact but [[dwarf|dwarves]], particularly of the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] variety, need rest! Lots of rest!

Now I ask you; How can they sleep without pillows? Exactly, <name>, they can't. This is why you must steal their pillows.

Once you've finished your cushion-thievery, talk with [[Taskmaster Scrange]]. He's a bit deeper in the cave, working on a covert project with [[Hansel Heavyhands|Hansel]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*675 [[XP]]
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Thorium Brotherhood]]

==Progress==
What? Pillows?

What?

==Completion==
I see {{NPC||Evonice Sootsmoker||Evonice}} is up to her old tricks again. I guess I'll just... um... hang onto these pillows for a while.

The important part is that you're here. We're going to need your help.

==Notes==
Head up either ramp, then head circle toward the center. [[Dark Blacksmith]]s and [[Dark Iron Digmaster]]s are in the area. Pillows line the walls on the beds. After looting a good half-dozen, watch out!

*{{text|yell|Dark Iron Worker|We'll not let this act of madness go unpunished!}}

A cadre of {{NPC||Sleepy Dark Iron Worker}}s will descend on the room. They are weak, and only have 185 health each, but still. After looting 16, head southwest to find Taskmaster Scrange. His gossip text:
:I can't believe that we're doing this. I know that [[Archduke Calcinder|Calcinder]]'s presence threatens us all, but really? Doesn't this seem like the domain of the [[Earthen Ring]], or something?

:Why's the [[Thorium Brotherhood]] gotta come save the day all the time?

During the process of completing this quest, players have triggered the [[Dark Iron Pillamaster]]'s spawn event. Continue questing like normal. After killing Maltorius/Arkkus and exiting the area to the southeast searching for Oilfist, the Pillamaster will spawn. He is an elite, so don't take him alone! After his death, he drops [[Pillamaster's Ornate Pillow]] on the ground, which can be looted in the form of [[Chambermaid Pillaclencher's Pillow]]. The item starts [[Look at the Size of It!]], a quick reward quest back with Evonice, who is still on the ramp in the Slag Pit. It rewards [[Evonice's Landin' Pilla]], {{cost||75}} and +1000 [[Thorium Brotherhood]] reputation.
