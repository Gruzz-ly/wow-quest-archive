== Objectives ==
Obtain 15 Tempered Flywheels from {{NPC||Tempered War Golem}}s.
*[[Tempered Flywheel]] x15

== Description ==
{{NPC||Lunk}} came from the [[Badlands]]. Other [[ogres]] try to make Lunk fight.

Lunk hate fighting. Lunk want to learn.

Lunk sees machines to the south. Machines made of gears.

Maybe if you ask nicely, machines will give you some gears? Then maybe Lunk can have a gear, and learn about machines too.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Progress ==
You get gears? How you get them?

== Completion ==
You didn't... KILL the machines to get these, right?

<Lunk looks upset.>

Right?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A New Master... But Who?]] and [[The Fewer, the Better]] before heading out. Plenty of war golems on the outskirts of the [[Grimesilt Dig Site]]. They have 2-4 flywheels each.
