== Objectives ==
Find and read the Prayer to Elune.
*[[Prayer to Elune]]

== Description ==
Will you assist me, mortal? Will you find the prayer to [[Elune]]?

As I stated, the prayer was etched onto a golden tablet. I believe they hold it within one of their vile chests, near the entrance to their cave at the bottom of the ridge.

If you do recover my prayer, don't bring it back to me. Instead, take the time to read through it.

Absolution may be asking too much, based on the sins I've committed. But that won't stop me from holding out hope.

== Rewards ==
The following spell will be cast on you: {{Abilities|Zamael's Prayer|Stamina increased by 45, for 1 hour.|id=88663|icon=spell_holy_wordfortitude}}

== Progress ==
<You glance over the night elf's prayer.>

== Completion ==
As your eyes pass over the words of Zamael's prayer, you feel the tablet grow lighter.

A wave of warmth passes over you, and the tablet is gone.

== Notes ==
At the mouth of the cave at the base of [[Firewatch Ridge]] is a Twilight's Hammer Crate. Loot it to recover the Prayer to Elune, which completes the quest automatically.
