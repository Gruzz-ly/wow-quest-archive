== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Overseer Oilfist}} at [[Thorium Point]] in [[Searing Gorge]].

== Description ==
Did... did you see that? This is the missing piece we've been looking for! We have to get this information back to someone at Thorium Point.

The [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Irons]] have been known to consort with the {{NPC||Ragnaros||firelord}} in the past, but never before have they brought their kind this far out into [[Searing Gorge]].

Thorium Point is west and north of here. You will find it nestled in the cliffs that overlook [[Pyrox Flats]]. Take this information straight to Overseer Oilfist.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Completion ==
Do I know you, <race>?

<Overseer Oilfist listens as you describe what you saw within the flames at [[Thorium Advance]].>

Sounds like another one of Ragnaros' minions. I don't like the sound of that.

== Notes ==
Run north to get past the cauldron, then west across the Pyrox Flats. Keep an eye to the north... the path to Thorium Point is pretty heavily marked, due north of the hole dropping in to the [[Slag Pit]]. Run up the hill to reach Thorium Point, pick up the flight path, then head to the top of the watchtower.

On complete, it's a christmas tree of quests! Pick up all of [[Rasha'krak]], [[Recon Essentials]], [[The Spiders Have to Go]], [[Curse These Fat Fingers]] and [[Heat That Just Don't Quit]]. While killing dwarves, Lunk appears, offering [[Lunk's Adventure: Cranky Little Dwarfs]]. Additionally, for players level 55 and up, Oilfist offers [[A Potential Ally]], involving a trek into [[Blackrock Spire]] to find {{NPC||Vaelan}}.
