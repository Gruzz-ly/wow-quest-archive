== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Hansel Heavyhands}} and help him assault Overseer Maltorius and Twilight-Lord Arkkus.
*[[Overseer Maltorius]] slain
*[[Twilight-Lord Arkkus]] slain

== Description ==
Hansel and {{NPC||Taskmaster Scrange||I}} came here on a secret mission: kill Overseer Maltorius. While our main goal remains the same - defeating {{NPC||Archduke Calcinder}} - it can't hurt to take out the infamous overseer of the [[Slag Pit]] while we're here.

Problem is, Hansel was only prepared to fight one dwarf, but it looks like Maltorius has a visitor... an emissary from the [[Twilight's Hammer]]!

Speak with Hansel and help him out. Then proceed down this corridor and along the balcony outside to find {{NPC||Overseer Oilfist}}.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|45}}

== Progress ==
How did Scrange's mission go?

== Completion ==
Twilight's Hammer, eh? I should've expected as much. I'm glad you arrived to help them out when you did.

It looks like, despite all odds, we've pressed our offensive to the doorstep of Calcinder's lair. It's now time to finish the job.

== Notes ==
From Scrange's position, head 20 yards southwest to the ledge overlooking the quarry inside the Slag Pit. Take the hostiles out. Then turn southeast and exit the area. While crossing the first metal bridge, then look down to the left, northeast. Oilfist and four lookouts are down the ramp, looking at the {{NPC||Searing Flamewraith}}s. Jump down or run outside, around, and back in to get down there without jumping.
