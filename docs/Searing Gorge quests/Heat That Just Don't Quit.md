==Objectives==
Obtain 10 Filled Furnace Flasks. You must use the Furnace Flasks on living [[fire elemental|elementals]] within [[Searing Gorge]].
*[[Filled Furnace Flask]] (10)
*[[Furnace Flasks]] (provided)

==Description==
We smith, we smelt, we roast up whatever spider meat we can get. Bush chicken if we're lucky. Point is, all o' this work means we need lots of fire.

Good thing we're smack dab in the middle of firetown.

O' course, the best fire comes from the elementals. You'll find 'em all over Searing Gorge, but always near lava. Here, take these flasks and use 'em on the elementals.

Oh, did I mention the elementals gotta be alive when you gather your sample?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

==Progress==
Oilfist says he's gonna have us makin' firebombs soon. All the more need for those flasks.

==Completion==
Yeeeeeeowch!  Don't just go puttin' this stuff into a dwarf's open hand.  This stuff is burnin' up!

Now me hands are gonna get even more swollen...

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Rasha'krak]], [[Recon Essentials]], [[The Spiders Have to Go]] and [[Curse These Fat Fingers]] before heading out.

[[Blazing Elemental]]s, [[Inferno Elemental]]s and [[Magma Elemental]]s all count. They can be found everywhere, not just in [[Pyrox Flats]]. Close to melee range and use the flask on the full-size fire elemental or flame ascendant. It will shrink down to fun-size, so kill it like normal. Incredibly enough, it even works on [[Rasha'krak]].
