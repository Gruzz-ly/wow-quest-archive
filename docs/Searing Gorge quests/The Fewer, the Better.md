== Objectives ==
Slay 10 {{NPC||Dark Iron Geologist}}s or {{NPC||Dark Iron Watchman||Dark Iron Watchmen}}.
*Dark Iron Geologist or Watchman slain x10

== Description ==
{{NPC||Burrian Coalpart||I'm}} not much of a fighter... I'm more of a mining [[dwarf]]. Same goes for {{NPC||Jack Rockleg||Jack}} and {{NPC||Prisanne Dustcropper||Pris}}. And {{NPC||Lunk}}... well, you'd think he'd be a big fighter, but he's the biggest wimp of all of us.

What I'm saying is, it's good that you came here when you did.

It seems likely that we in the [[Thorium Brotherhood]] are going to be fighting the other [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron dwarves]] soon. I'm thinking we should pick off some of their finest before the war starts in earnest. Start with the geologists and watchmen to the south.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Progress ==
The fewer of them that remain, the better our prospects are.

== Completion ==
Thank you.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Lunk's Task]] and [[A New Master... But Who?]] before heading out. Any non-named Dark Iron dwarf counts. Check up by the [[Wooden Outhouse]] above the dig if the area is swarmed.

==Progression==
