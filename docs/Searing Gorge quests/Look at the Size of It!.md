==Objectives==
Take Chambermaid Pillaclencher's Pillow to [[Evonice Sootsmoker]] in the [[Searing Gorge]].
*[[Pillamaster's Pillow]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, well, well... Isn't this a surprise. The Pillamaster had a gigantic ornate pillow and now it's yours. Evonice Sootsmoker will definitely want to get her grubby little hands all over this item. Take it to her and see if she'll offer you any goodies for your trouble.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Evonice's Landin' Pilla}}

==Progress==
That is one huge pillow! Where'd you get it from?

==Completion==
This is better than even I could have though possible! The Chambermaid's magical pillow is mine! You better believe you're going to get a nice reward for this accomplishment, <name>!

==Notes==
The pillow will be found on the ground next to the [[Dark Iron Pillamaster]]'s corpse after killing her in the Dark Iron sleeping quarters of the [[Slag Pit]] in [[Searing Gorge]]. Pillaclencher will only spawn for players who have just stolen 20 pillows for [[Kill 'em With Sleep Deprivation]], so see that quest for more information.
