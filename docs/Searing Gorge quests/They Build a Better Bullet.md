== Objectives ==
Obtain 200 Dark Iron Bullets.
*[[Dark Iron Bullet]] x200

== Description ==
Those [[Cauldron|gorge]]-digging [[Dark Iron clan|dwarves]] do at least one thing right: they make very high-quality bullets. I've been unable to reproduce their results, so I've taken to stealing whatever bullets of theirs that I can find.

Ye want my help? Get me a couple hundred bullets from those {{NPC||Dark Iron Marksman||marksmen}} below.

I'm sure they'll be happy to give ye their bullets one at a time, but you might find it faster just to look for the crates filled with them.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|K'Vlar Vest|Rendan's Signet|Dark Iron Gun|Dark Iron Blackjack|Dark Iron Shank|Dark Iron Maul}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|77|50}}
*2,100 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
A real <class> woulda caught the bullets with <his/her> teeth.

== Completion ==
I'll just divvy these up amongst the guards. Ye have my thanks.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Siege!]], [[Set Them Ablaze!]] and [[The Mysteries of the Fire-Gizzard]] before heading out. Marksmen (east of Iron Summit) and Lookouts (guarding the four towers) carry a few bullets each, but Dark Iron Bullets crates contain a lot! Incredibly, getting shot also nets a bullet each time!

==Progression==
{{Searing Gorge storyline}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.3.5|note=[[Dark Iron Blackjack]], [[Dark Iron Shank]], and [[Dark Iron Maul]] added as rewards.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
