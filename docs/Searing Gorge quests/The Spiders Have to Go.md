== Objectives ==
Slay 9 Lava Spiders within [[Searing Gorge]].
*Lava Spider slain x9

== Description ==
Normal-size [[spider]]s, I can handle.

Giant {{NPC||Glassweb Spider||glassweb spiders}} make me uncomfortable, but they're far enough away that I don't worry too much.

But lava spiders? <Lolo shudders.>  Lava spiders are SCARY.  They're enormous spiders. That live in [[Lava|LAVA]].

I just got paid for my last week of work, and I'll pay you well to kill those things.  You'll find 'em all over Searing Gorge.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|10}}

== Progress ==
Come on, get out there and kill those spiders! You aren't afraid of money, are you? Because that would be weird.

== Completion ==
There's no way you coulda killed all the spiders in the gorge, but you definitely made a dent.

Fine, here's what I promised ya. Don't spend it all in one place. Unless it's at [[Thorium Point]].

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Rasha'krak]], [[Recon Essentials]], [[Curse These Fat Fingers]], and [[Heat That Just Don't Quit]] before heading out. {{NPC||Greater Lava Spider}}s can be found all over the west side of Searing Gorge. [[Searing Lava Spider]]s also count.
