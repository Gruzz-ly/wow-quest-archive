== Objectives ==
Slay 6 Searing Flameraiths.
*[[Searing Flamewraith]] slain x6

== Description ==
There is such a thing as digging too deep, <name>. While you'll find the richest mineral veins deep below the surface, you'll also find the most evil creatures.

Like [[fire elemental]]s.

{{NPC||Archduke Calcinder||Calcinder}}'s minions roam the cavern ahead. Every one of them holds a piece of Calcinder's evil within it. Slay as many as you can, and show no remose.

== Completion ==
The remains of Calcinder's minions lie smoldering at your feet. Oilfist will be relieved to hear that you succeeded.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[From Whence He Came]] before heading out. Kill flamewraiths and keep taking lefts, circling around to the southwest. Archduke Calcinder is a level 50 elite [[flamewaker]] with 8860 health.

==Progression==
