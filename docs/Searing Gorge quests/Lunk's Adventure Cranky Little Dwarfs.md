==Objectives==
Weaken 7 Dark Iron Steamsmiths so [[Lunk]] can help them fall asleep.
*[[Dark Iron Steamsmith]]s put to sleep x7

==Description==
What you doing? Why you kill?

You need to get things from [[Dark Iron clan|dwarfs]]? Lunk understand. Lunk have a better way.

Listen: you go fight dwarf, but do not kill! Just fight until dwarf get tired. Then Lunk will help dwarf fall asleep. Dwarfs probably just cranky because they don't get sleep.

Come on! Trust Lunk.

==Completion==
Dwarfs is going to sleep good tonight.

Lunk hopes you got everything you were looking for. Now time to go off and find other adventures.

Bye!

==Notes==
While out and about killing Dark Iron dwarves for [[Recon Essentials]], Lunk shows up with this quest. Accept it before the corpse of the dwarf despawns or Lunk will disappear. Then weaken dwarves so Lunk can do his thing. After knocking them out, Lunk will toss the player whatever was on the dwarf's corpse, including possible quest items.

Tip: If you're a high-level player, note that [[Soft Foam Sword]] will not trigger Lunk to take action. You'll need to remove all your equipment and only auto-attack.
