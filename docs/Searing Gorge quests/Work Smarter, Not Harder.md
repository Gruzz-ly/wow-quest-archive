==Objectives==
[[Taskmaster Scrange]] wants you to slay [[Obsidian Surger]]s in the {{C|Searing Gorge}} and bring their Power Cores back him. Obsidian Surgers can be found along the southern portion of the Searing Gorge, near the entrance to [[Blackrock Mountain]].
*[[Obsidian Power Core (Season of Discovery)]] (6)

==Description==
Ever since the eruptions started we've been fighting tooth and nail to keep these blasted [[elemental]]s down and the work has taken its toll on our craftsmen. Turns out, keeping the troops' gear and kit in tip-top shape is a lot of work. Fortunately, us [[Dwarf|dwarves]] are the masters of working smarter, not harder and we've discovered that the power cores inside of the Obsidian Surgers to the southeast of [[Thorium Point]] can be put to great use as whetstones to easily hone our blades!

Would you fetch more for us?

*[[Firelands Ember]]

You will also receive:
