== Objectives ==
Slay 10 {{NPC||Dark Iron Taskmaster}}s or {{NPC||Dark Iron Slaver}}s
*Dark Iron Taskmaster or Slaver slain

== Description ==
Much like {{NPC||Overseer Maltorius}}, I'm a rich dwarf. However, I earned my riches through hard work and wise decisions, not through slavery.

OK fine, very little slavery. Hardly any.

Anyhow, the first thing that I see inside these caverns are slavedrivers and taskmasters. I won't stand for this! As you progress through the cavern, kill as many as you can. Report your results to {{NPC||Evonice Sootsmoker}}, deeper within the [[Slag Pit]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Progress ==
I think these slavers deserve a little bit more punishment before we move on.

== Completion ==
You've done good. I don't like slavery either.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Sweet, Horrible Freedom]] and [[Rise, Obsidion]] before heading out. Kill and free, and open the [[Quarry Gate]] to head further inside. There's only one path. In the big room is {{NPC||Obsidion}}, laying supine. Interact with the [[Altar of Suntara]] to summon Suntara, then kill him and Obsidion. Once all of the slavers and slaves are killed and/or freed, run up the in the southeast corner of Obsidion's room. Evonice and a few lookouts are up on the first landing.
