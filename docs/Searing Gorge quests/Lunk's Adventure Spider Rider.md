== Objectives ==
Weaken 7 {{NPC||Glassweb Spider}}s so {{NPC||Lunk}} can ride them.
*Spiders ridden x7

== Description ==
Lunk sees you like to kill things. Let Lunk teach you another way.

Lunk always wanted to ride on spider's back. Looks like fun. Spiders move too fast, though. Always slip away.

We work together. You fight spider until it gets weak and tired. Then Lunk jump on spider's back and ride around.

Maybe Lunk even gather {{item|Glassweb Venom|some venom}} for you! No have to kill!

== Completion ==
Lunk is very happy that you let him ride on the spiders. Lunk is also happy that <name> was able to do <name>'s adventures without killing anything.

Maybe Lunk sees you later.

== Notes ==
While killing Glassweb Spiders for [[A Proper Antivenom]], Lunk runs up and offers this quest. Accept it before the corpse of the Glassweb Spider despawns. Knock the spider down to half health, and Lunk will ride the spider on his belly! For the player's trouble, he has two venom for the price of one. High-level players will need to use the [[Soft Foam Sword]] to not obliterate the spiders.
