== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Acride}}.

== Description ==
It is no secret that we aren't fans of the [[Blackrock clan|orcs]] in [[Blackrock Mountain]], but we do carefully watch their every move. Nothing happens in that Mountain without me knowing about it, <class>.

Recently, a different sort of [[orc]] came into Blackrock. He resides just inside [[Blackrock Spire]], and I know he's somehow planning to overthrow {{NPC||Nefarian}} and his whole army of orcs. Normally I wouldn't trust their kind, but we share a common goal for the time being. Find him, he's called Acride.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||9}}

== Completion ==
Hello, what is your business in a place like this?

So {{NPC||Overseer Oilfist}} sent you? Listen carefully, we have much to discuss in little time.

== Notes ==
Acride can be found just inside the [[Hall of Blackhand]] in Blackrock Spire. His gossip text:
:Do not be alarmed. I am not as I appear.
:My name is {{NPC||Acridostrasz}}, though you may call me Acride. My Queen sent me here to stop {{NPC||Nefarian}}, and I will not rest until my task is complete. However, there are other foes here guarding [[Blackwing Lair|his lair]] that I cannot take on alone.
:Help me dispose of them, and you will be in the favor of {{NPC||Alexstrasza}}. You may not know that name, but you will one day be thankful that you do, of this I am certain.
