== Objectives ==
Use the [[Altar of Suntara]], then slay Lathoric the Black and Obsidion.
*[[Lathoric the Black]] slain
*[[Obsidion]] slain

== Description ==
{{NPC||Overseer Maltorius}} is in charge here, but he's not the only dwarf of power within the [[Slag Pit]]. Lathoric the Black and his horrifying [[golem]], Obsidion, loom just down this corridor.

Interfering with Lathoric's altar should summon both of them. Find it, then summon Lathoric and kill him. Report to {{NPC||Evonice Sootsmoker}} when you're finished.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dark Iron Axe|Belt of Turning Tides|Suntara Spaulders|Sootsmoke Wand|Dark Iron Pike}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|77|70}}
*2,100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Thorium Brotherhood]]

== Progress ==
The Altar of Suntar is just below, <name>. And so is Obsidion.

I'll maintain our position here on the ramp. You take care of that huge monster.

== Completion ==
A fight well-fought, <name>! I'm beginning to feel the tide turn.

Now, when you're ready, let's hit these [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] where it really hurts!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Slavery is Bad]] and [[Sweet, Horrible Freedom]] before heading out. Kill and free, and open the [[Quarry Gate]] to head further inside. There's only one path. In the big room is {{NPC||Obsidion}}, laying supine. Interact with the [[Altar of Suntara]] to summon Suntara, then kill him and Obsidion. Once all of the slavers and slaves are killed and/or freed, run up the in the southeast corner of Obsidion's room. Evonice and a few lookouts are up on the first landing.

Obsidion and Lathoric are both level 49s with 3207 health each. On interacting with the altar:
: ''Lathoric spawns.''
:{{text|yell|Lathoric the Black|You are here to stop the Archduke?}}
: ''He walks over to you.''
:{{text|yell|Lathoric the Black|Fools. Obsidion! Rise, and destroy the interlopers!}}
: ''Lathoric is aggroed and Obsidion gets up to attack.''
