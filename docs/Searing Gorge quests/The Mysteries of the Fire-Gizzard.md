== Objectives ==
Obtain 6 Fire-Gizzards.
*[[Fire-Gizzard]] x6

== Description ==
There's so much we don't know about the {{NPC||incendosaur}}s. Where did they come from? How do they survive out here on the flats? And why do they taste so bad?

The key to understanding these prehistoric beasts, I believe, starts with the fire-gizzard. Every incendosaur has one. I'd like a few of them to study.

You'll find incendosaurs circling the foot of [[Iron Summit]], mostly to the west.

== Progress ==
I'm finally getting my hands on those lizard gizzards!

== Completion ==
Ooh, these are nice. Now, leave me alone with my gizzards. I've got studying to do!

<Agnes starts to poke the gizzards with a stick.>

Yes, very interesting. Very interesting indeed...

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Iron Summit Belt|Incendosaur Gloves|Lizard Skin Boots|Fire-Gizzard Robes}}

You will also receive: {{cost||70}}

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Siege!]], [[Set Them Ablaze!]] and [[They Build a Better Bullet]] before heading out.

Incendosaurs used to be found solely at the bottom of the [[Slag Pit]], a long, perilous run through the depths of the [[Cauldron]]. The [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]] must have shaken them to the surface, immediately to the west of Iron Summit. Convenient.
