== Objectives ==
Find a way to convince {{NPC||Mountain-Lord Rendan}} to join the [[Thorium Brotherhood]].

== Description ==
What? Why're you still here? Oh, did I promise that I'd help you and the Thorium Brotherhood in yer fight?

I lied.

I just can't spare the men right now. I know I said I'd help, but there's absolutely no way you can convince me to leave [[Iron Summit]] right now. Absolutely no way.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Completion ==
Well well well. Look who come searching for {{NPC||Lunk}} this time!

This sounds like case for Lunk's unique brand of no-kill problem-solve.
 
== Notes ==
On accept, Lunk appears at the base of the tower, dancing!

==Progression==
