== Objectives ==
Find and return the Smithing Tuyere and Lookout's Spyglass.
*[[Smithing Tuyere]]
*[[Lookout's Spyglass]]

== Description ==
We used to have more stuff around here. I think there was a spyglass somewhere nearby, along with a smithing tuyere.

I'm pretty certain that they've been stolen by [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron dwarves]]. Yes, I know that I'm a Dark Iron dwarf! I'm talking about the bad ones that live down in [[Searing Gorge|that gorge]].

You'd best check the steamsmiths that work just south of here. They'd be most likely to use tools like these.

== Progress ==
If you're here for the reward, you're gonna have to give me the stolen goods.

== Completion ==
Fantastic work!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Steamsmith Helm|Taskmaster's Loop|Essential Pantaloons|Mantle of the White Sheep}}

You will also receive: {{cost|1|40}}

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Rasha'krak]], [[The Spiders Have to Go]], [[Curse These Fat Fingers]] and [[Heat That Just Don't Quit]] before heading out. Start killing Dark Iron dwarves.

However, {{NPC||Lunk}} shows up upon the first dwarf's death, offering [[Lunk's Adventure: Cranky Little Dwarfs]].
