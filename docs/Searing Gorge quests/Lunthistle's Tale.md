;Speaking to Zamael
:Praise [[Elune]]! It has been many years since I have had visitors.

:{{gossip|I wish to hear your tale.}}
::As a young night elf in [[Darkshore]], I crossed paths with a group of unsavory individuals known as the [[Twilight's Hammer]].  A group of them befriended me and shamefully, I ended up eschewing my faith in [[Elune]] and embracing the vitriol of the Twilight's Hammer.

::It was not until a vision came to me from Elune, that I woke up from the malaise that I had fallen into as a follower of the [[old gods]].

::In repentance, I began work on my prayer to Elune.

::{{gossip|Please continue, Zamael.}}

:::Etched into a tablet of pure gold was the embodiment of my remorse, shame, regret, and sorrow.  Unfortunately, the Twilight's Hammer found the tablet and branded me a [[Blasphemy|blasphemer]]. I was summarily executed, my prayer to Elune incomplete.  I am now bound to this world as a spirit, unable to transcend to the [[Twisting Nether|Nether]]: held in this cage as a warning to all that would betray the faith of the Twilight's Hammer.

:::{{gossip|Let me think about it, Zamael.}}
