== Objectives ==
Obtain 14 samples of Glassweb Venom.
*[[Glassweb Venom]] x14

== Description ==
Shame that {{NPC||Lunk}} left. I was beginning to enjoy his company.

Oh well, back to work!

I'm the closest thing this expedition has to a medical officer, and I'm running low on antivenom. We tend to need a lot of antivenom.

The key to a proper antivenom is ALWAYS to start with the poison itself. The glassweb spiders nearby should be a good place to start. If you kill them, you can probably extract some venom from the sacs beneath their teeth.

== Progress ==
Well well, you certainly operate quickly! You do have the venom, right?

== Completion ==
This... this is way more than I expected. This will last us for months!

== Rewards ==

You will also receive: {{cost||70}}

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Out of Place]] and [[A Lumbering Relic]] before heading out. Kill a spider and Lunk will show up! He offers [[Lunk's Adventure: Spider Rider]]. Try to not kill spiders while Lunk is out and about. He'll speed up the process by offering two venom samples for the price of one.
