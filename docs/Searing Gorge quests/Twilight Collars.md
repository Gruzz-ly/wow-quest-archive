== Objectives ==
Obtain 20 Twilight Collars.
*[[Twilight Collar]] (20)

== Description ==
Have ye seen the ridiculous necklaces those [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists all wear? The gems on those things are bigger than Hansel's fist!

A few hamburger-sized jewels like that, and [[Master Smith Burninate|Burninate]] over there could really push his blacksmithing business to the next level. Fetch those collars, and he'll make it worth your while.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Progress ==
A ruby-hilted hammer... it has a nice ring to it.

== Completion ==
Hmm... the gems looked... sparklier from afar. Up close, they look kind of dingy.

Ah well! A little spit and polish should do the trick, and if not, I can use 'em to practice my disenchanting.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dark Ministry]] before heading out. Exit Thorium Point and head northwest to reach [[Firewatch Ridge]]. Then go killing. Up on the ridge by the lava pit past Minister Finister's location is [[Zamael Lunthistle]]. He offers [[Lunthistle's Tale]]. Do it, then pick up [[Prayer to Elune (quest)]] and head to the mouth of the cavern. Complete it, then go inside. Take the first left and head south down to find Minister Kiyuubi, a [[broken]] Keep circling around clockwise to find Minister Letherio on the rise in the middle of the big cavern, a [[blood elf]]. Combine the three spherules to form the tripetricine. Keep circling the outside of the cavern to the northwest to reach the mouth of the cave system.
