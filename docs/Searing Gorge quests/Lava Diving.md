==Objectives==
Bring a chunk of Shimmering Molten Mineral to [[Hansel Heavyhands]]. You can find the shimmering molten crag within the [[Slag Pit]] lava pools, deep within the [[Cauldron]].
*[[Shimmering Molten Mineral]]

==Description==
Our lookouts tell me there's a big glowing rock stickin' out of the deepest part of the lava pools beneath the Cauldron. The [[elemental]]s seem to react to this material, so I need ye to sneak in there and grab me a chunk of that rock. It's pretty hot down there in more ways than one, so I suggest ye bring a hearty supply of fire protection potions!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Firelands Ember]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*6,200 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Thorium Brotherhood]]
*+150 reputation with [[Hydraxian Waterlords]]

==Progress==
What have ye got there?

==Completion==
Hopefully we can use this to learn a bit more about what we are dealing with.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.3|note=Added.}}
