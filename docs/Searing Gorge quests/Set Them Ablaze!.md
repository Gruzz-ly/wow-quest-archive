==Objectives==
Use the Torch of Retribution on the four towers surrounding the [[Cauldron]].
*Western tower ablaze
*Southwestern tower ablaze
*Southeastern tower ablaze
*Eastern tower ablaze
*[[Torch of Retribution]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm not sure if ye've noticed, but [[Iron Summit|my tower's]] much taller than any o' the other towers here around the [[Searing Gorge|Gorge]]. Some dwarves pride themselves at how deep they can dig, but not me. Sometimes I think I shoulda been born a [[Wildhammer dwarf|Wildhammer]].

I still don't like the sight o' those other towers, though. Reachin' up like that, ticklin' my tower's feet. Here, take this torch, an' use it on the braziers atop those other towers. They'll be sorry they ever built 'em to begin with.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

==Progress==
Ye used the torch already, I presume.

==Completion==
Looks like ye know how to light things on fire! An admirable trait in any <race>, for sure.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Siege!]], [[They Build a Better Bullet]] and [[The Mysteries of the Fire-Gizzard]] before heading out. There are two towers south of the Cauldron east of Iron Summit, and two northwest of Iron Summit. Kill a path to the top of a tower, which should only take two or three kills at each tower, picking up bullets along the way. Up top on the side of the top level opposite the ramp is a small brazier. Interact with it to set the tower aflame.
