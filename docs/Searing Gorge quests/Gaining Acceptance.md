'''Gaining Acceptance''' is a quest that can be completed in order to gain reputation points with the [[Thorium Brotherhood]].  It will be offered after the quest [[Welcome to the Brotherhood]].

Players originally had this quest only available from {{rep|Friendly}} to {{rep|Honored}} with the Thorium Brotherhood, and having completed [[What the Flux?]].

==Progress==
You've worked your way up through the Brotherhood's corporate hierarchy, <race>. We have begun to look favorably upon you. Quite an accomplishment!

If you're interested in more work and earning more respect amongst us, listen up.

We can refine the fiery flux by adding a simple [[Dark Iron Residue|Dark Iron residue]] to the mix. The Dark Iron residue can be found in [[Blackrock Depths]].

Bring me all the Dark Iron residue you find!
*[[Dark Iron Residue]] (4)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+60 [[reputation]] with [[Thorium Brotherhood]]

==Completion==
Keep the residue pouring in!

==Notes==
This quest and [[Gaining Even More Acceptance]] are used to help finish off {{rep|Revered}} reputation while outside Blackrock Depths.

{{wow-section}}
*This quest is repeatable up to Honored.
*It takes 960 Dark Iron Residue to go from 0/6000 Friendly to 0/12000 Honored.
*Prior to Cataclysm, it was recommended that any uncompleted quests for the Thorium Brotherhood be postponed until Honored for maximum reputation gain.  However, you may now want to quest up to Revered and use Dark Iron Residue turn-ins up to Exalted.  See the Reputation entry on the [[Thorium Brotherhood]] page.
* Getting from Friendly to Honored reputation requires repeating this quest turn-in 240 times.  This is a slow manual process.  You may find it helpful to create the following macro to aid in turning the quest in:
 /script SelectGossipAvailableQuest(1)
 /script CompleteQuest()
 /script GetQuestReward()
:This will allow you to initiate chat (manually) and then simply click your macro in rapid succession to turn the quest in. Because of changes in the ways macros work, this makes the 1 macro act like /castsequence would.
*Alternately the addon TitanBG allows for autocompletion of repeatable turnin quests.
*Since Patch 3.1.0, the [[Gaining_Even_More_Acceptance|Gaining Even More Acceptance]] allows a player to turn in 100 [[Dark Iron Residue]] at a time, and the reputation reward is 25 times the reward for this quest, speeding the turn-in process.
