== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Dig-Boss Dinwhisker.jpg||Dinwhisker is Grimesilt's superior. Hopefully he has more information.}}
Kill {{NPC||Dark Iron Excavator}}s and {{NPC||Dark Iron Footman||Dark Iron Footmen}} within the [[Cauldron]] until {{NPC||Dig-Boss Dinwhisker}} appears. Then slay Dig-Boss Dinwhisker and obtain his Dark Ember.
*[[Dark Ember]]

== Description ==
{{NPC||Gravius Grimesilt||Grimesilt}} wasn't as high up on the chain as I thought. We'll have to take out his superior and find out what he knows.

Dig-Boss Dinwhisker's his name, and he runs the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] digging operations within the Cauldron, just northwest of here. His excavators and footmen patrol the eastern side of the Cauldron, digging downward, day and night.

He's not known to show his face out in the field very often, but if you slay enough of his men, he'll be forced to come out and deal with you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Progress ==
If Dinwhisker doesn't have what we seek, I'm not sure what we'll do next.

== Completion ==
A... an ember? What is this thing?

== Notes ==
Run to the north to [[Dustfire Valley]], then turn southwest to enter the cauldron. Then start killing Dark Iron dwarves indiscriminately until Dig-Boss Dinwhisker spawns.

:''Dinwhisker spawns from the west end of this part of the cauldron and does a counter-clockwise circle of the area. Kill him and he will drop his Dark Ember on the ground. Thus, players who did not get the tap can still continue the quest.

On complete:

:{{text|yell|Image of Archduke Calcinder|Nothing to offer, except your backs and your shovels. So you will dig.}}
:{{text|yell|Image of Archduke Calcinder|Dig wide, dig deep. Seek out the places of fire beneath the world. My brothers and sisters yearn to be free.}}
:{{text|yell|Image of Archduke Calcinder|Succeed, and you may ascend after all. Fail, and burn.}}
