== Objectives ==
Slay 9 Dark Iron Marksmen.
*[[Dark Iron Marksman]] slain (9)

== Description ==
That {{NPC||Overseer Oilfist}} couldn't'a picked a worse time to ask me to join a fight. [[Iron Summit|My summit]]'s already under siege.

It's nothin' my guards can't handle, but still, it won't be easy for me to just pick up and send some dwarves into that [[Cauldron|infernal gorge]].

Tell ya what: you take out their marksmen that're holding our fortress under siege, and I'll consider your offer. Ye'll find 'em slinkin' around the flats to the east.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Progress ==
You'll have to do beter than that, <lad/lass>.

== Completion ==
If nothin' else, you bought us some time, and some room to open up our supply lines through this siege.

Yer a fine <class>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Set Them Ablaze!]], [[They Build a Better Bullet]] and [[The Mysteries of the Fire-Gizzard]] before heading out. The marksmen are all east of Iron summit between the two southern towers.

==Progression==
{{Searing Gorge storyline}}
