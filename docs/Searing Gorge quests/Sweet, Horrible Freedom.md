== Objectives ==
Free 12 Slave Workers. If they resist, kill them.
*[[Slave Worker]]s freed or killed

== Description ==
Of course, we'll want to free as many slaves as we can while we're here. Most of them will likely join forces with us, anxious to fight against their captors.

However, sometimes you will find that slaves are resistant to being freed. It's a strange phenomenon, often called "[[Durnholde Syndrome]]".

Either way, you should try to free them. If they resist, treat them as enemies. Report your results to {{NPC||Evonice Sootsmoker}}, deeper within the [[Slag Pit]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Progress ==
Let's free a few more of these slaves before we move on.

== Completion ==
Strange how so many slaves cope poorly with freedom. It's a shame to have to do what we do, but such are the truths of war.

Now, we must move on to more pressing tasks.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Slavery is Bad]] and [[Rise, Obsidion]] before heading out. Kill and free, and open the [[Quarry Gate]] to head further inside. There's only one path. In the big room is {{NPC||Obsidion}}, laying supine. Interact with the [[Altar of Suntara]] to summon Suntara, then kill him and Obsidion. Once all of the slavers and slaves are killed and/or freed, run up the in the southeast corner of Obsidion's room. Evonice and a few lookouts are up on the first landing.

*Who are you?
*Are you... here to save me?
*Get out of here, before the slavers see you!

*{{text|say|Slave Worker|Intruder!  The intruder is trying to save me!}}
*{{text|say|Slave Worker|I'll never leave!  I wouldn't know what to do outside!}}

Flee:
*{{text|say|Slave Worker|Oh, thank you!  Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Slave Worker|It's about time!  I'm sick of being a slave!}}
*{{text|say|Slave Worker|I knew the Thorium Brotherhood would come through!}}
