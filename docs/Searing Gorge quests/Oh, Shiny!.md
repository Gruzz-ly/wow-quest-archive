*[[Flamestone Cluster]] (8)

==Description==
A group of [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Irons]] were recently captured with some particularly curious enchanted gemstones on their persons. These gemstones don't appear to be native to [[Azeroth]] and I simply MUST study more of them! They have their [[slave]]s digging the stuff up now deep in The Cauldron, and I need ye to head down there as fast as ye can and bring me some additional samples. I'll make it worth your while if you do!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Firelands Ember]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*4,350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Thorium Brotherhood]]

==Progress==
What'cha got for me?

==Completion==
They're beautiful! I can't wait to get these under my monoscope. Many thanks, <class>.
