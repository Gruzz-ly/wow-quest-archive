== Objectives ==
Obtain [[:Kiyuubi's Spherule]], [[:Letherio's Spherule]], and [[:Finister's Spherule]], then combine them into a Twilight Tripetricine.
*[[Twilight Tripetricine]]

== Description ==
I got one more assignment for ye. This one comes straight from the Overseer himself. Seems he was pretty shook up once he heard about that "Archduke" ye discovered.

He's asked for us to hunt down three [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight]] ministers that work over in [[Firewatch Ridge]], to the west. [[Minister Kiyuubi|Kiyuubi]], [[Minister Letherio|Letherio]], and [[Minister Finister|Finister]] are their names, and they each carry some sort o' special rock. Combine all three and brin 'em back here.

Listen, when the Overseer gives orders, ye don't ask questions. Ye just do it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|40}}
* 7850 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Thorium Brotherhood]]

== Progress ==
Ye got the thing?

== Completion ==
<Hansel weighs the stone in his hands.>

This thing is strange, <name>. I don't know what to make of it. It ain't natural, that's for sure.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Twilight Collars]] before heading out. Exit Thorium Point and loop up to the northwest to reach [[Firewatch Ridge]]. Then go killing. Up the ridge proper standing on a runic circle is Minister Finister, a [[goblin]]. Past Minister Finister's location is [[Zamael Lunthistle]]. He offers [[Lunthistle's Tale]]. Do it, then pick up [[Prayer to Elune (quest)]] and head to the mouth of the cavern. Complete it, then go inside. Take the first left and head south down to find Minister Kiyuubi, a [[broken]]. Keep circling around clockwise to find Minister Letherio, a [[blood elf]], on the rise in the middle of the big cavern. Combine the three spherules to form the tripetricine. Keep circling the outside of the cavern to the northwest to reach the mouth of the cave system.
