== Objectives ==
Speak to the [[Thorium Point]] flight master, then use the {{NPC||Brotherhood Flying Machine}}'s guns to kill {{NPC||Cauldron Defender}}s until the area is safe for entry.
*Secure entrance into the Slag Pit

== Description ==
I'm putting you on a [[flying machine]], <name>.

You'll be responsible for softening the landing into the [[Slag Pit|slag pit]]. Speak with your [[flight master]] here in Thorium Point, then fly down into [[Cauldron|the gorge]].

Once you near your landing point, there will undoubtedly be hordes of [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron dwarves]] waiting for you. Use our flying machine's guns to take out as many of them as you can, then land at the cavern's entrance. {{NPC||Mountain-Lord Rendan||Rendan}} should be waiting for you by the time you arrive.

== Completion ==
Well, here we are.

I hope you're ready, <name>.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Mountain-Lord's Legguards|Slag Pit Bracers|Dancer's Belt}}

You will also receive: {{cost|1|40}}

== Notes ==
Head back to the flight master and choose the second option to take the ride through the Cauldron. There, it will stop near one of the entrances to the Slag Pit and hover as Cauldron Defenders start coming from nowhere and attacking! The flying machine has a ground-targeted AoE that will one-shot the Cauldron Defenders. Once they're all dead, the flying machine will land. Run inside to talk to Rendan.
