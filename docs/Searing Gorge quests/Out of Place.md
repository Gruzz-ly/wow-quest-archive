== Objectives ==
Obtain 8 Ash Chickens.
*[[Ash Chicken]] x8

== Description ==
The [[Searing Gorge|gorge]] is an unforgiving place. We don't get a whole  lot of fuzzy wildlife wandering around here.

We tried bringing in some wild game, but they haven't fared well at all. There's just no food for them to eat. Now the nearby spiders - which were already dangerous - are getting big and fat on chicken meat.

We'll never get rid of all the spiders, but we can salvage what few chickens remain. Not only will you be feeding the [[Thorium Brotherhood|Brotherhood]], you'll be saving them a painful death by spider bite.

== Progress ==
Those poor animals.

== Completion ==
You've got quick hands if you were able to gather this many in such a short time.

Excellent work, <name>. I'll make sure these ones don't go to waste.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Coalpart's Bracers|Mercy Killing Helm|Fuzzy Headcover|Ash Feather Cloak}}

You will also receive: {{cost||70}}

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Proper Antivenom]] and [[A Lumbering Relic]] before heading out. While saving chickens, players are probably killing spiders. {{NPC||Lunk}} should show up, offering [[Lunk's Adventure: Spider Rider]]!
