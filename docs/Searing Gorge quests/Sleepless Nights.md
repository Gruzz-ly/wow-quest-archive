==Objectives==
[[Evonice Sootsmoker]] is asking you to drink the Specially Formulated Dreamjuice and slay 5 Flamebringer Stalkers near [[Thorium Point]] in the {{C|Searing Gorge}}.
*[[Flamebringer Stalker]] slain (5)
*[[Dreamjuice]] (provided)

==Description==
It's not enough that these curs attack us while we are awake, they also have to attack us while we sleep! The new Twilight Lord has a particular affinity for dream shenanigans so he's been sending [[assassin]]s to attack us in our dreams! I need you to knock back a few mouthfuls of my specially formulated, locally sourced, non-GNO "Dreamjuice". That should allow you to straddle the line between the waking and dreaming world and stop these sneaks in their tracks.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Firelands Ember]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*6,200 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Thorium Brotherhood]]
*+150 reputation with [[Hydraxian Waterlords]]

==Progress==
Did ye give 'em what-for yet?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. That should make 'em think twice before sneakin' into Thorium Point again!

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.3|note=Added.}}
