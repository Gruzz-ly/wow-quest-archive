==Pre-requisites==
You must be {{reputation|Revered}} with the [[Thorium Brotherhood]] before this quest is offered, and have completed the introductory quest line which ends with [[Welcome to the Brotherhood]].

==Objectives==
*[[Dark Iron Residue]] (100)

==Description==
You've worked your way up through the Brotherhood's corporate hierarchy, <race>. We have begun to look favorably upon you. Quite an accomplishment!

If you're interested in more work and earning more respect amongst us, listen up.

We can refine the fiery flux by adding a simple [[Dark Iron Residue|Dark Iron residue]] to the mix. The Dark Iron residue can be found in [[Blackrock Depths]].

Bring me all the Dark Iron residue you find!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+1,500 [[reputation]] with [[Thorium Brotherhood]]
(Exactly the same as completing [[Gaining Acceptance|Gaining Acceptance]] 25 times.)

==Completion==
Keep the residue pouring in!

==Notes==
{{wow-section}}
*This quest is repeatable up to Honored.
*It takes 960 Dark Iron Residue to go from 0/6000 Friendly to 0/12000 Honored, therefore this quest must be completed 10 times to get to Honored.  For perfect efficiency in use of [[Dark Iron Residue]], this quest may be completed 9 times, and [[Gaining Acceptance|Gaining Acceptance]] completed 15 times.
*It is recommended that any uncompleted quests for the Thorium Brotherhood be postponed until Honored for maximum reputation gain.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.1.0|note=Added.}}
