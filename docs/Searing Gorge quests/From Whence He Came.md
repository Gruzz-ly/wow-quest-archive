==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Archduke Calcinder.jpg|Archduke Calcinder|I won't stand to have any minion of [[Ragnaros]] this close to [[Thorium Point]]. Send him back where he belongs.}}
Weaken Archduke Calcinder, then use the Sanctified Tripetricine to banish him.
*[[Archduke Calcinder]] banished
*[[Consecrated Tripetricine]] (provided)

==Description==
Archduke Calcinder squirms in the back of [[Slag Pit|this very cavern]]. We are close to killing him.. but that is not what we are going to do.

Slaying Calcinder here means nothing. His acolytes can easily revive him. Instead, we are going to banish him.

I asked you to gather a precious stone from the [[Twilight's Hammer]] earlier. You will now use it against Calcinder. Engage him, weaken him, then use this device on him. He will be banished from this realm.

Good luck, brave <name>.

==Completion==
Archduke Calcinder has been banished from [[Azeroth]]. All that remains is a small, ashy spot where he once stood.

Your work here is done.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Minions of Calcinder]] before heading out. Kill flamewraiths and keep taking lefts, circling around to the southwest. Archduke Calcinder is a level 50 elite [[flamewaker]] with 8860 health. Knock him below 50% health and banish him!

Should you be a higher level character that would one-shot anything in the zone no matter how hard you try not to, your first attack is guaranteed to deplete all of his HP except for one point.

:{{text|bossemote|Archduke Calcinder is weakened! Banish him now!}}
If, however, players decide to press on and "kill" him, it doesn't work. He will despawn at one health with a taunt:
:{{text|yell|Archduke Calcinder|Fools! You cannot defeat me! I will only return again...}}
Thus, wait until he respawns and try again.
On banish:
:{{text|yell|Archduke Calcinder|NOOOOOO! THIS CANNOT BE! I... AM... IMMORTAL...!}}
:''The archduke goes immune inside his bubble and disappears.''
The quest completes automatically once he is banished.

[[Welcome to the Brotherhood]] is the immediate followup. [[Lunk Like Your Style]] is also available back at Thorium Point before reaching Oilfist if you continued his quests.
