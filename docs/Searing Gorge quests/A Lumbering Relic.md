==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Margol the Rager.jpg||The ancient rager of Searing Gorge.}}
Obtain Margol's Gigantic Horn.
*[[Margol's Gigantic Horn]]

==Description==
{{NPC||Margol the Rager}}'s an old [[thunder lizard]] seen round these parts. Legend has it that he's been here in the [[Searing Gorge|gorge]] before it was even a gorge. Legend also has it that he ate my brother [[Barnabas]].

I don't care how old he is or what kind of magic he shoots out his nose. I just want him dead. For Barnabas' sake.

You'll find him wandering the cliffs south of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

==Progress==
Bring me the horn, <name>.

==Completion==
Yup, this was Margol's horn alright. No doubt about it.

Barnabas was a digger, like me. He never stood a chance in combat against the beast. I'm glad you were here to set things right.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Proper Antivenom]] and [[Out of Place]] before heading out. Margol's still in the southeast corner of Searing Gorge, past the [[Grimesilt Digsite]] and the [[Sea of Cinders]]. Look for a natural, but unmarked path just to the east of the abandoned camp south of Grimesilt, probably guarded by a {{NPC||Glassweb Spider}}. Margol's at the top of the hill near his cave.

==Trivia==
The non-targetable dwarf corpse near where he patrols is most likely Barnabas.

==Progression==
{{Searing Gorge storyline}}
