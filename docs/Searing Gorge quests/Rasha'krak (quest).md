== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Rasha'krak.jpg|Rasha'krak|He patrols the entrance to Thorium Point. What does he want?}}
Obtain Rasha'krak's Bracers of Binding.
*[[Rasha'krak's Bracers of Binding]]

== Description ==
Based on this information you've delivered, I believe that one of this "Archduke's" minions may have already turned its eyes toward [[Thorium Point]].

His name is {{NPC||Rasha'krak}}, and he patrols the lava pools just to our south. He looks like the latent [[fire elemental]]s that rage nearby, except for one small difference: the bracers of binding that encircle his wrists.

Find him and bring these bracers to me, <name>. I need proof that we are in danger before we involve ourselves in elemental wars.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|40}}

== Progress ==
I won't fight any elementals until we have proven that they pose a threat to us.

== Completion ==
It is, unfortunately, as I expected. These bracers bear the indelible mark of the {{NPC||Ragnaros||firelord}} and his minions.

Very well. With no [[Horde]] or [[Alliance]] forces anywhere near this [[Searing Gorge|godforsaken gorge]], it falls upon the Thorium Brotherhood to stop this Archduke before he spreads any more of his evil.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Recon Essentials]], [[The Spiders Have to Go]], [[Curse These Fat Fingers]] and [[Heat That Just Don't Quit]] before heading out. Additionally, for players level 55 and above, he offers [[A Potential Ally]], which involves a trek into [[Blackrock Spire]], a 5-player dungeon. So don't go it alone.

Rasha'krak is a level 49 flame ascendant with ~4000 health.
