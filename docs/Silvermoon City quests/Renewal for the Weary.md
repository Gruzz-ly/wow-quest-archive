==Objectives==
Restore the Light to 10 weary channelers.
*Stay Awhile and Listen (Optional)
*Sunwell Channeler Renewed (10)
*[[Faol's Benediction]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Vanguard of the Light]] are maintaining a difficult ritual at the [[Sunwell]]. It requires focus, discipline and is quite exhausting.

Take my staff. I've had it since I was [[Archbishop]] in [[Stormwind]]. It is meaningful to me and my faith. The [[Light]] responds to meaning and intention. It should renew the Vanguard's spirits so they can maintain the ritual a while longer.

I can't approach any closer to the Sunwell, so you will have to do this for me.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Wraps of Renewal]]
* [[Gloves of Renewal]]
* [[Hands of Renewal]]
* [[Touch of Renewal]]

You will also receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*13,365 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I had hoped that seeing the rest of the Vanguard focused on the Sunwell, it would give him a goal that was bigger than his pain and lead him away from his anger. Instead he spent his time cleaning slime.

Thank you, <name>, for doing it in his stead. It was necessary to keep the Voidstorm at bay.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|That's your solution? To zap them with your staff?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Hmmph. Those defenders have exhausted themselves, giving of their own faith and power. We bolster their reserves.}}

Speak with Alonsus:
{{dialogue|Well my boy... you have made sure that neither of us can enter that holy chamber.

{{gossip|quest=|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|You're creating a bigger cloud with your moping than [[Xal'atath]]'s Voidstorm.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Speak your mind! Let it out before these feelings create a well of poison in your gut.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I'm not upset that [[Turalyon|my father]] cut me down.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I'm upset that when he did so... I saw the Light shining brightly in his eyes.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The same Light that I am taught to revere. Under its guidance--he almost killed me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|So you blame the Light, not your father?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We are trained to wield the Light as a weapon. Is that all that I am as a paladin?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|You founded the [[Silver Hand]]. You trained my father. I suppose I blame you as well.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|You crafted this philosophy of war. I followed your teachings until I burned myself with my own wrath.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Well, I think you're absolutely right. I really made a mess of it all didn't I?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|What?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|I'm reminded of each and every one of my failings every day when the Light burns me as I channel it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|What are you saying?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|In many ways, this world is broken. You should feel angry about it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|That doesn't mean you can't try to change the world, or yourself, for the better.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Come with me on my little quest. I can't promise we'll change anything but how you feel.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|But that's the only thing we can control.}}

Upon arriving at the Sunwell, [[Velen]], [[Salandria]], [[Mehlar Dawnblade]], [[Mariella Ward]], [[Faerin Lothar]], [[Nolaki]], [[Tahu Sagewind]], [[Captain Fareeya]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], [[Valunei]], and [[Taelia Fordragon]] are channeling their light towards the Sunwell.
:{{Text|Yell|Prophet Velen|The Sunwell is a conduit for the Light! [[Sunwell Plateau epilogue|Made holy]] through the sacrifice of the [[naaru]] [[M'uru|Mu'ru]]{{sic}}!}}

Each of them has a gossip,
{{dialogue|title=Prophet Velen|<Name>, thank you for coming to help. The [[Vanguard of the Light]] has been maintaining this ritual to keep [[Xal'atath]] at bay, but they do not have my endurance.

Anything you can do could give us the time we need.}}

{{dialogue|title=Salandria|Ever since I came here from [[Outland]], the Sunwell has been a beacon to me of the Light, and what it means to be a blood elf.

I'm honored to have any part in this, <name>.}}

{{dialogue|title=Mehlar Dawnblade|I have seen much, <name>, from the early days of paladins to the fall of Arthas from the Light...

I had hoped the defeat of [[Burning Legion|the Legion]] and [[Tyr]]'s return meant brighter days were ahead, but the Void has our world at the very brink of darkness.

Thank you for helping me find strength to continue.}}

{{dialogue|title=Mariella Ward|Is that Alonsus's{{sic}} staff, <name>? He was the one who welcomed me into the [[Conclave]] when I left the [[Scarlet Crusade|Scarlet]]s.

If he trusts you with it, I'm sure I can trust you as well.}}

{{dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|I don't think we have anything quite like the Sunwell back in the [[Arathi Empire]], <name>.

It's vital that we protect it. Thank you for your help.}}

{{dialogue|title=Nolaki|[[Tyr]] sacrificed himself to stop a [[Zakajz the Corruptor|C'Thraxxi]]--a being of the Void.

Anyting I can do at the Sunwell to push back the Void is just continuing his work.}}

{{dialogue|title=Tahu Sagewind|[[An'she]] would have us stand against the Void just as he would.

And with your help. I am still able to do 50.}}

{{dialogue|title=Captain Fareeya|The Void seems to be even more endless than [[Burning Legion|the Legion]], though hopefully this struggle will not last a thousand years.

I thank you for your aid.}}

{{dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|There's so much relying on our success here at the Sunwell, <name>.

It's a heavy burden, but not as great as the weight of refusing it.

Thank you for helping us bear the load.}}

{{dialogue|title=Valunei|I can't help but wonder. <Name>, what has lead Xal'atath to all of this. I suspect her past has been as dark as the Void Itself.

But more than that. I think of everyone she is hurting, all who have died to her machinations. That's why we must use the Sunwell to stop her, no matter how exhausted we are.}}

{{dialogue|title=Taelia Fordragon|To be honest, <name>, I assumed my life had peaked when I followed [[Bolvar Fordragon|my father]] to the [[Shadowlands|realms of death]].

Now we're fighting against an enemy even stranger and more inscrutable. It's terrifying, but I'm glad to be able to do my part.}}

Use {{abilities|Faol's Blessing|id=1224826|icon=inv_elemental_mote_mana|Grant Faol's Blessing through his staff, Benediction, restoring mana to the recipient.|range=18|cast=2.5}} on everyone except Velen.

Upon casting the blessings on 2 channelers,
:{{Text|Yell|Prophet Velen|I know you are tired. It is hard to continue, but we must!}}

Upon casting the blessings on 7 channelers,
:{{Text|Yell|Prophet Velen|Should the Sunwell fall, we have no way to stop the [[Devouring Host]]!}}

Upon casting the blessings on every single channeler,
:{{Text|Yell|Prophet Velen|We have taken different paths to reach the Light. bur together we assemble for the same purpose. To protect Azeroth!}}

[[Hadwin]] and [[Talthis]], [[Vindicator Boros]] and [[Justicar Julia Celeste]], [[High Prelate Rata]] and [[Aponi Brightmane]], [[Calia Menethil]] and [[Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker]], [[General Amias Bellamy]] and [[War Chaplain Senn]], and [[Goldskimmer|Sister Goldskimmer]] and [[Moira Thaurissan]] are chatting.

:{{Text|Say|War Chaplain Senn|I'm worried that Void Elf might sneak back in here and disrupt our efforts at the Sunwell.}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|I have marshalled what priests were available to ward against the void. It won't repel the Devouring Host, but will prevent contamination from any undesirable mortals.}}

In the plateau's antechamber, [[Commander Venel Lightblood]] confers with [[Commander Koruth Mountainfist]].

:{{Text|Say|Commander Venel Lightblood|I appreciate your concerns, Koruth. For [[Blood elf|my people]], the Light and the Sunwell are the same. They may complain, but they will accept the Vanguard.}}
:{{Text|Say|Commander Koruth Mountainfist|If you say so, Venel. It just seems we're ruffling too many [[gryphon]] feathers.}}

Return to Alonsus Faol.
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|<Name>, next I suggest we journey to [[Light's Hope Chapel|Light's Hope chapel]], to gather relics of the [[Knights of the Silver Hand|paladin order]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|What if I promised that my task would take you far away from here?}}
