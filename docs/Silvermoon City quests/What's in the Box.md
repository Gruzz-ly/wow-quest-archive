==Objectives==
Assist with Aethas and Rommath's experiment.
*Locate the [[Arcanis Mechanica]]
*Speak with [[Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]]
*Speak with [[Grand Magister Rommath]]
*Contain the Experiment

==Description==
We are trying to uncover the secrets of one of the [[mogu]] artifacts [[Garrosh]] insisted we investigate. It is proving most difficult, as anyone who probes it magically is greatly affected by raw, negative emotions.

I called in the assistance of Arch-mage Aethas of the [[Sunreavers]] in the hopes that he and Rommath could crack this puzzle. They asked for you specifically - apparently you have some relevant experience?

Go to the chamber below [[Farstrider Square]] east of here and see if you can assist them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]
*+500 reputation with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
This reckless use of my people by Garrosh is becoming intolerable. If you had not been here to assist I dread to think what might have happened.

==Notes==
;Approaching Arcanis Mechanica
:{{Text|yell|Arcanis Mechanica|--ATTENTION <NAME>. YOUR PRESENCE IS REQUESTED IN THE CHAMBER BEHIND THIS UNIT.--}}

;Interacting with Arcanis Mechanica
:--GREETINGS, <NAME>. PLEASE PROCEED DOWN THE TUNNEL BEHIND THIS UNIT. HIS HIGH AND POWERFULNESS THE GRAND MAGISTER ROMMATH AWAITS YOUR ARRIVAL.--

The four [[Blood Elf Magister]]s have the [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=134564/containment-beam Containment Beam] buff.

;Approaching Rommath and Aethas
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|You continue to bow to the Kirin Tor as if they were our saviors. Do not forget their treachery, Aethas.}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|And bowing to the Warchief is any better? Garrosh's obsession with these mogu artifacts is such that I haven't seen since [[Kael'thas]] walked amongst us.}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|We are the Sin'dorai{{sic}}! We should not have to bow to anyone. Not the Kirin Tor, not the Alliance, and certainly not the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Rommath, without allies we will be crushed by the tides of this war. There is no middle ground with Garrosh. We either have to be with him, or against him.}}

;Speak with Grand Magister Rommath:
:[[Jaina Proudmoore]] now sits as head of the [[Kirin Tor]] and rules [[Dalaran]].
:That puts the citadel square in the hands of the [[Alliance]] no matter how much Aethas brags about neutrality.
:This young upstart may have forgotten, but the Alliance tried to imprison and massacre our people during the third war.
:Forgive me if I do not share his faith in their... "neutrality".
:{{gossip|Lor'themar wants a status update on the experiment.}}
:This Korune device is similar to the [[fel crystal]]s we once used to enslave demonic energies. Demon or angry spirit or elemental manifestation of an emotion, the principle is relatively the same.
:We need to see how intact the entity stored within this artifact is, however. Since you have experience with the mogu and the other dangers of Pandaria, would you be so kind as to do the honors?
:We have already disabled most of the protective wards. Simply adjust the intensifier disc on the artifact and be ready for anything that comes out.

;Speak with Archmage Aethas Sunreaver:
:[[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]] has been allies with Dalaran for over 2000 years. It is not a friendship we should idly toss aside at the whim of our 'esteemed' [[Garrosh Hellscream|Warchief Garrosh]].
:Oh... are you here about the artifact?
:{{gossip|Lor'themar wants a status update on the experiment.}}
:Lor'themar wants a status update? Or is it his master Garrosh?
:You should tell them both that this experiment is a waste of time. The mogu drew power by enslaving the living essence of other creatures. Is this something our Warchief should be dabbling in?
:This is the same road Kael'thas Sunstrider once walked, and it nearly destroyed our people. Why are we taking orders from someone who would have us walk down this road again?

After talking to both Aethas and Rommath, interact with the [[Intensifier Disc]], and the [[Concentrated Sha|sha experiment]] is released and both come under the influence of the sha and becomes hostile; attacking one another.
:{{text|yell|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Enough Rommath! The Sin'dorei must be free from the yoke of the Horde!}}
''After containing the experiment, everyone returns to normal.''
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|What madness is this?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|What... what was that?}}
:{{text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|It has been an age of the world or more since I felt any emotion at even a fraction of that.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Rommath... I... I don't know what came over me.}}
:{{text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|It would seem this "sha" energy is far more powerful than I previously thought.}}

After successfully containing the experiment, Lor'themar Theron will appear at the doorway and have a private conversation with the hero:

:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Champion, may I have a word with you? In private... ?}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|You are a hero of the [[Horde]]. Your [[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King|deeds in]] [[Northrend]] and [[World of Warcraft:Cataclysm|during the Cataclysm]] are the stuff of legend. For this reason, I trust in your discretion.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I am a [[Elven ranger|ranger]], not a politician. But like it or not, the [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|mantle of leadership]] has fallen on my shoulders.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|[[blood elf|My people]], who have suffered through so many [[Sunwell|challenge]]s and [[Arthas Menethil|betrayals]], look to me to secure their future.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|We Sin'dorei were driven to the Horde by the [[Grand Marshal Garithos|bigotry]] and [[Third War|distrust]] of the [[Alliance]].}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Now, I look at our [[Garrosh Hellscream|Warchief]], and I begin to see the very same racism. He is willing to throw away our lives for his [[Alliance-Horde war|agenda]].}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Know this: I won't stand idle if the Horde interests conflict with those of my people. I may reconsider old [[Alliance|Alliances]].}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Keep your eyes open, champion. We are all in this together... for now.}}
