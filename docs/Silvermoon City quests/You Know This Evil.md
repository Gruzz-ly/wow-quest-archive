==Objectives==
Negotiate with the Vanguard of the Light for [[Magister Umbric]]'s release.
*Find Umbric
*[[Lothraxion]] Ppetitioned
*[[War Chaplain Senn]] petitioned
*[[Grand Magister Rommath]] petitioned
*[[Anduin Wrynn]] petitioned
*Report to Lor'themar Theron

==Description==
Champion, we have a bit of a delicate situation.

The Vanguard of the Light has just informed me they have taken Magister Umbric into custody. Apparently he was trying to get close to the Sunwell.

I do not have to tell you that tensions are high between my city and the Vanguard. We need Umbric to continue his research if we are to have a chance at contending with the Voidstorm.

I want you to represent me in negotiating Umbric's release. Whether we like him or not, we need him.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|23|40}}
*13,530 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for your intercession. While I prize myself on doing what is necessary for Silvermoon and the Sunwell, I have a feeling my own patience would have worn thin and I would have said something that all of us would have regretted.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Use discretion, Champion. We need both Umbric and the Vanguard.}}
:''Lady Liadrin took off.''

Head to the [[Shining Span]] and find Umbric who is kneeling before Lothraxion, War Chaplain Senn, & Grand Magister Rommath.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|I was investigating the Void to help you!}}
:{{Text|Say|War Chaplain Senn|We will not be tempted by your "offers" of help, Void elf.}}

Make sure you speak with Umbric
{{dialogue|I was simply attempting to get a closer reading on the Voidstorm-

Look. We do not have time for their distrust of my methods. Can't you feel it? The Voidstorm is not growing weaker, it is getting stronger.

The Sunwell cannot maintain its defense much longer. I need to find a way into the Voidstorm and to do that I need to evaluate the data I just gathered WITHOUT getting killed by zealots.

Can you help talk them down?}}


Speak with Anduin
{{dialogue|The Vanguard of the Light caught Magister Umbric getting close to the Sunwell. I had to intervene to ensure they did not execute him on sight.

Lothraxion and I are both very familiar with the corrupting nature of certain magics and their influence. It seems we took very different lessons from those experiences, however.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain that Lor'themar wants to see Umbric freed.>}}
{{dialogue-child|I agree with Lor'themar, though I also understand this is a politically complicated situation.

Magister Umbric is not a citizen of Silvermoon. He and the ren' dorei are exiles, which means Lor'themar has no authority.

Even if Umbric were a citizen, he is also a Magister. That means he falls under the auspice of Grand Magister Rommath who seems to have taken Umbric's use of Void magic as a personal betrayal.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain that Umbric is researching ways into the Voidstorm.>}}
{{dialogue-child|Really?

If we do not go on the offensive soon, we will be destined to fall to the void.

Well, [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]] once said: "[[The Awakening (WC3 NightElf)|Sometimes the hand of]] [[Kil'jaeden (Tomb of Sargeras tactics)|fate must be forced.]]"}}

Upon speaking to Lothraxion
{{dialogue|Our caution over allowing a void elf as powerful as Magister Umbric near the Sunwell is warranted. [[Alleria Windrunner]] approached the Sunwell a few years ago and it altered the magic just by her presence.

Granted, she holds a [[L'ura|dark naaru]] within her, but I am not about to risk letting a creature so given to the Void that close to the Sunwell.

{{gossip|I use Void magic.}}
{{dialogue-child|And you were summoned by the Sunwell. Umbric was not, which either means he is too tainted or is unworthy of such an honor.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain that Lor'themar wants to see Umbric freed.>}}
{{dialogue-child|I do not recognize Lor'themar's authority in this matter. This Void elf is an exile and by his very nature considered to be a threat to the Sunwell and our forces here.

Umbric is not a citizen of Silvermoon nor are we subservient to the rules of a regent-lord when it comes to our war with the Void.

He may council, not give orders.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain that Umbric is researching ways into the Voidstorm.>}}
{{dialogue-child|...Tempting.

Too tempting.

I doubt we could trust a path presented by a minion of the Void but we need to do something.

The Sunwell is holding for now but this is not a stalemate. The Voidstorm will begin breaching our defenses soon if something does not change.

We must go on the offensive.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}

Upon speaking to Senn,
{{dialogue|The Vanguard of the Light know our business when it comes to war with the Void. The forces there are predatory. infectious, cancerous, consuming.

This is how they fight. They wear the face of a friend or offer a deal and then before you know it another world is devoured.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain that Lor'themar wants to see Umbric freed.>}}
{{dialogue-child|We have already compromised our legions enough for Silvermoon.

Lor'themar is thinking too small. We are not here to save a city, we are here to save all of Azeroth.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain that Umbric is researching ways into the Voidstorm.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|I have no doubt that is true. Yet can we trust him to give us a path we can use? Or is it for his own personal gain?

We need to go on the offensive, but again, this is how the Void infests worlds. They offer you a hand in your time of need and then take everything from you.

[[Queen Ansurek]], [[Queen Azshara]], [[Nexus-King Salhadaar|Nexus-King Salhadar]]{{Sic}}, all of these people accepted a hand offered when they were most desperate.

We must rise above them.

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask how they would enter the Voidstorm without Umbric's help.>}}
{{dialogue-child|Our own auguries are researching this. They do not have a solution yet but neither does this Void stained elf.

We cannot bring the Vindicar to bear here due to the suppressive magics. Teleportation and flight magics cannot breach the storm.

Yet we will find a way in. We must have faith that we will find a way.}}

Upon speaking to Rommath
{{dialogue|Did Lor'themar send you?

Umbric was once a... colleague, before he turned to the Void. He was always reckless.

He might call it 'bold' but his approach to magic showed no respect for the boundaries we carefully establish to safeguard this world.

Now he has gone too far.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain that Lor'themar wants to see Umbric freed.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Lor'themar may believe he has authority here but Umbric is a magister and thus subject to MY judgement and authority.

What is more he and his kind were exiled for their practices. Void magic is not just a taboo. It is fundamentally evil at its very core.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain that Umbric is researching ways into the Voidstorm.>}}
}}

If either of them was the last spoken,
:{{Text|Say|Anduin Wrynn|High Commander. You will release Magister Umbric, if you please.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|No. This..elf...has made their allegiance know.}}
:{{Text|Say|Anduin Wrynn|They have. To me. Time and again, Umbric and his ren'dorei have shown their loyalty to the alliance despite persecution and distrust.}}
:''Umbric begins to walk off.''
:{{Text|Say|Anduin Wrynn|You do not have time to imprison him or grounds to execute him.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|But Umbric-}}
:''Senn & Lothraxion begin to walk off.''
:{{Text|Say|Anduin Wrynn|Is fond of 'bold' actions. Is that what I heard you say, Grand Magister?}}
:{{Text|Say|Anduin Wrynn|Now is the time for bold actions. Release him, I accept full responsibility.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Fine. On your head be it.}}

Head to the Sanctum of Light as Rommath, Umbric, & Anduin Wrynn are speaking to Lor'themar.

Upon speaking to Lor'themar
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|I can protect you in the city, but the Vanguard will not allow you to approach the Sunwell. Results will change that.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Results? I have no tools, no support, and zealots on both sides hunting me...}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|If you found a pathway to Xal'atath... The Vanguard would leave. To say nothing of the power your people could acquire.}}
