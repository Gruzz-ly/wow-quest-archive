==Description==
Champion, I could use your assistance. The natives here in Silvermoon are proving to be less hospitable than we had hoped.

In their defense, their city is facing down a darkness unlike anything [[Azeroth]] has ever faced, so tensions are high.

Can you use your unique perspective and help de-escalate some of the hot spots that are emerging around Silvermoon?
