== Objectives ==
Slay Mage-Commander Zuros, then escape from [[Dalaran]].
*[[Mage-Commander Zuros]] slain
*Escape from Dalaran

== Description ==
We've looked everywhere he's likely to be, except for one place: the [[Violet Citadel]].

Find out if Archmage Aethas is being held within the citadel, <name>. We may get lucky. If not... at least we saved a number of lives today.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|34|20|}}
* 353000 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]
* +500 reputation with [[Horde]]

== Completion ==
Is this... <name>? What's going on here? 

==Notes==
Once the player has slain Zuros, Rommath appears and opens a [[Rommath's Portal|portal]] to the exit pipe in the Dalaran sewers.
:{{text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|Aethas, this way! Into the portal!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Enter the Portal!}}

The player, Rommath, and Aethas then run to the end of the pipe.
:{{text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|Stay by me! We're going out the tunnel!}}
:''Arriving at the end of the pipe.''
:{{text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|Stay by my side!}}

They jump off, and land safely on the back of [[Red Dragonhawk (NPC)|dragonhawks]] that take them to [[Silvermoon]], where they land in front of [[Lor'themar Theron]] and the [[Divine Bell]].

Upon completion, the following dialogue happens:
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|[[Aethas]]! You're alive!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Thanks to this hero, a few of us made it out of there. Many more have been sent to the Violet Hold.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|[[Thalassian|Anar'alash denal!]] Will someone tell me WHAT is going on in Dalaran?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Proudmoore! She's gone and expelled the [[Sunreavers]] from the city. She's purging the Horde from the [[Kirin Tor]]!}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|She's gone too far. I'm certain the Alliance can move their [[Warmage|war mages]] through the city at will. That human ... witch!}}
:''Lor'themar angrily flips a bench into the nearby fountain.''
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|When will they learn? When will they see that the [[Horde]] exists BECAUSE of the [[Alliance]]? Because of their prejudice and their bigotry!? They force us ever closer to Hellscream's Horde.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|My Lord...}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|[[Halduron Brightwing|Hal'duron]]{{sic}}, summon the [[Elven ranger|rangers]]. [[Rommath]], assemble the [[Blood mage|Blood Magi]], and add the Sunreavers' strength to your own.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|We [[Sin'dorei]] will take our future into our own hands.}}
:''Lor'themar approaches the [[Divine Bell]].''
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|And get this damn thing out of my sight! Hellscream bought this treasure with the blood of my people. I hope it destroys him.}}
:{{text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|My Lord. YOU would make a fine [[Warchief]].}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|It may come to that. Bring me my blades. The next move is mine.}}

[[Dominance Battlemage]] is maintaining the [[Portal to Domination Point]].

Once this quest is complete and despite the storyline, Dalaran returns to normal for the player character.

[[Vol'jin]] sends the player this [[mail]]:

{{book|What Happened?|content=<name>!

Nobody give me a straight answer. What happened in Dalaran?

That Proudmoore woman, she used to be a woman of peace. Look at what she become. Garrosh scorches earth, and the dead ain't the only victims.

[[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] says Lor'themar ain't too happy neither. He and I got to have a talk. Soon as I can travel again...
