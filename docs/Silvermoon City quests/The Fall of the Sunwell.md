==Objectives==
Complete the Fall of the Sunwell scenario.
*Complete the Fall of the Sunwell scenario

==Description==
The flame of the lantern dims. Your final task is to rekindle it.

In order to do so, you must walk one remaining path. While we are fortunate to hold the [[Sunwell]] once again, we must always remember that it was yet another part of us that [[Arthas]] took away... and that our late prince was forced to find us a new way of life.

Enter the [[Sunwell Plateau]], and witness its fall.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: {{Abilities|Heritage of the Sin'dorei|id=286948|icon=spell_arcane_portalsilvermoon}} (''grants the [[Heritage of the Sin'dorei]]'')

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
<The [[Lor'themar Theron|Regent Lord]] takes the lantern from you.>

It is done.
