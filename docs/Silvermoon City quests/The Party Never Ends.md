==Objectives==
Acquire a bottle of Suntouched Special Reserve, Springpaw Appetizers and a Bundle of Fireworks, and return them to [[Lord Saltheril]] at [[Saltheril's Haven]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]]. 
*[[Suntouched Special Reserve (quest item)]] from [[Vinemaster Suntouched]]{{co|76|59|Silvermoon City (Burning Crusade)}}
*[[Springpaw Appetizers]] from [[Zalene Firstlight]]{{co|60|63|Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)}}
*[[Bundle of Fireworks]] from [[Halis Dawnstrider]]{{co|44|70|Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)}}

==Description==
I like to throw parties... just a little something to celebrate the magnificence that is [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Quel'Thalas]]!

But, I'm in a bit of a bind. I need you to gather up more party supplies.

From Vinemaster Suntouched at the [[Silvermoon City Inn|Silvermoon City inn]], bring me a bottle of Suntouched Special Reserve. From Zalene Firstlight at [[Farstrider Retreat]] acquire more of those delicious Springpaw Appetizers. And you can pick up my delivery of fireworks from Halis Dawnstrider at [[Fairbreeze Village]].

Be quick about it! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||9|}}
*775 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|80}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]
*[[Saltheril's Haven Party Invitation]]

==Progress==
Didn't I just send you out to gather up more party supplies? Was that you? Oh, I can't be expected to remember everyone's face, now can I? I meet so many... interesting people.

What is it that you want? 

==Completion==
You're quite the energetic young <boy/girl>, aren't you?

This all looks very adequate. You certainly deserve compensation for gathering up all of this for me, and something a little extra I think.

Oh, I almost forgot, here's an invitation to the party. And, <class>, next time that you drop in make sure to dress up in something a little more... festive.
