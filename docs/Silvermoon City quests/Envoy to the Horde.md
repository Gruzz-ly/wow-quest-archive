This quest is part of the '''Friend of the Sin'dorei''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[Friend of the Sin'dorei]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Letter from [[Lor'themar Theron]] to [[Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] in [[Undercity]], the Forsaken capital in [[Tirisfal Glades]].
* [[Letter from Lor'themar Theron]] (provided)

==Description==
There were doubts about our capabilities among our potential new allies. Of what use could we be to them when perceived as unable to deal with our problems at home?

This changes everything. No longer will our power be questioned. We'll be able to join the [[Horde]] as equals.

Take this letter to Sylvanas, ruler of the [[Forsaken]]. She's already on our side but the news of Dar'Khan's death will be music to her ears. Prepare for a long trip, <name>. If all goes well she will send you to [[Orgrimmar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1650 [[XP]]
**75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
I was told a visitor from Quel'Thalas was coming. I was expecting a blood elf, to tell you the truth.

What news do you bring?

==Completion==
It is done then. The foul traitor got what he deserved.

You've been of great service to the blood elves and to the Horde. Dar'khan was Thrall's excuse to deny them entry into our alliance. You've cleared the way for a new Horde, <class>.

I also see that Lor'themar has additional news that will greatly improve his relations with the orc Warchief. Excellent!
