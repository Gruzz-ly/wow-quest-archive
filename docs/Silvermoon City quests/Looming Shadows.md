==Objectives==
Report to [[Lor'themar Theron]] in [[Silvermoon City]].

==Description==
Though we've triumphed over Ruia and the lightbloom for now, more remains to be done. The Elders will want to convene regarding the [[Hara'ti]]'s new place in the world, now that we have stepped out from the shadows of our past.

Our reticence and fear will not vanish overnight. But this is an important first step.

We will be fine, <name>. Let Orweyna and I deal with the Elders. When the time comes, the [[Hara'ti]] shall be at your side. For now, though. I'd imagine you have more pressing matters to attend to.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,705 [[XP]]

==Completion==
When [[Halduron Brightwing|Halduron]] burst into a war council shouting about hidden worlds and ancient warriors. I thought he had gone mad. But now that I've seen the [[haranir]] with my own eyes...

We are lucky to have them as potential allies. And lucky to have you, I'd say, in brokering that relationship.

There is more for us to do. But I've no doubt that the Hara'ti will prove vital allies to Silvermoon in the days to come.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both [[The Blinding Vale (quest)]] from [[Orweyna]] and '''Looming Shadows''' from [[Hagar]],
:{{Text|Say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|<name>, return to the Sanctum of Light, This struggle is far from over.}}
:''Hagar starts returning to the rootway.''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Thank you <name>. You helped bring my people back into the world. The Goddess would be pleased, I think.}}
:''Orweyna departs. [[Grand Magister Rommath]] starts taking off followed by Lor'themar Theron and then [[Halduron Brightwing]].''

Head to the Sanctum of Light and meet up with Lor'themar.

Upon completion, [[Commander Koruth Mountainfist]] and [[Aethas Sunreaver]] come in.
