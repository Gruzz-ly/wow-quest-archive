==Objectives==
Report to Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City.

==Description==
Because the Twilight's Blade still remain in [[Zul'Aman]], I have decided to stay here and advise [[Zul'jarra]]. I...

I feel as though I have let my past and my prejudices get in the way of my judgement regarding the Amani. You could say that being an atal'hash'ey would be a befitting atonement but... I feel drawn to stay here, perhaps to help Zul'jarra in guiding her people back to the loa.

Give the regent my regards when you return to Silvermoon.

And this report.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,705 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Lor'themar raises an eyebrow and frowns slightly.>

A very unexpected turn of events. Yet still more unfold in front of us, I'm sure.

Head to the Sanctum of Light and meet up with Lor'themar.
