==Objectives==
Return the relics to Silvermoon.
*Tell [[Alonsus Faol|Alonsus]] you're ready to Depart
*Portal to Silvermoon Taken

==Description==
I hope [[Faol's Benediction|my staff]]'s light has been enough to uphold those at the [[Sunwell]] while we have sought these relics.

Together with those from [[Light's Hope Chapel|Light's Hope]], they should be a much more significant aid.

Let us return there quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,710 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Quickly, <name>, let us get these distributed!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Is this the fate of all paladins? Die a legend or live to be consumed by zealotry and wrath?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|No, Arator. My hope is that you can find a different path to follow.}}

Speak to Alonsus:
{{dialogue|I can make us a portal back to Silvermoon, <name>, using this grimoire [[Khadgar]] has lent me.

{{gossip|quest=|<Tell Alonsus you are ready to return to Silvermoon.>}}
}}

Alonsus Faol uses the [[Grimoire of Teleportation]] to open the portal.

Use the portal to go to Silvermoon.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I can't face the Sunwell defenders right now.}}
