==Objectives==
Report to Turalyon at the Voidspire muster point.
*Take the Portal to Voidstorm Muster Point (Optional)

==Description==
I must return to [[Silvermoon]], but Turalyon has commanded all able-bodied champions of the light to meet him at the muster point outside the [[Voidspire]].

The forces of the [[Devouring Host|devouring host]] will fall, <class>.

One way, or the other.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|3|41}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You've made it. Good. As you can see, the enemy was prepared for our arrival, even if we were not.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|[[General Amias Bellamy]]|We have left you a token force to hold back the Voidstorm. Light willing, it will suffice.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|We both claim the Light as our guide, but yours is a sterile, cold faith I scarcely recognize.}}

Head the [[Approach]] and meet up with Turalyon, [[Alleria Windrunner]], & [[Magister Umbric]].
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|We can't spare the troops! Those ethereal cannons have us pinned down.}}

Umbric gets a gossip,
{{Dialogue|It's good to see you again, champion.}}

So too does, Alleria,
{{Dialogue|The void energy running through this land promises unlimited power. But at what price?}}
