;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|First Arcanist Thalyssra and honored guests. Welcome to Silvermoon.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|It is a pleasure to visit your fine city at last. Thank you for extending the invitation, Regent Lord.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Please, call me Lor'themar. But where are my manners? Allow me to introduce another guest: Lady Alleria Windrunner, a hero of Silvermoon's past.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|An unexpected honor, Lady Windrunner. Silgryn told me of your courage during the campaign on Argus.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The honor is mine, First Arcanist. I do not mean to intrude upon your visit. Perhaps I should return another time.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Nonsense. Whatever you came to say, you may say in front of our guests.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|As you wish. I come bearing an offer from High King Anduin Wr--}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I had hoped your visit was motivated by a love for Silvermoon. Instead, you come at the behest of the Alliance's boy-king. How disappointing.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Cutting words, Lor'themar. Are they yours, I wonder, or has the dutiful ranger I knew become the mouthpiece of your warchief?}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|You doubt my words, yet how can we trust your own? Do you deny that the lords of the Void whisper to you? Did you not surrender yourself to the shadows on Argus?}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I seems the offer I bring has been anticipated... and spurned. Very well. But before I leave, I have one request.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|It has been a thousand years since I set eyes upon the Sunwell. May I visit it once again?}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|I advise against it. We cannot trust that she will not--}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Whatever she has become, Alleria is a daughter of Quel'Thalas. I will not deny her pilgrimage to our most sacred site. First Arcanist, you and your retinue would be welcome to join us.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I would consider it an honor to see the Sunwell, Lor'themar. And I prefer that my friends call me Thalyssra.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Rommath, kindly open the way for us.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Please follow me.}}

===Scenario: Remember the Sunwell===
[[File:WorldMap-TheSunwellUnlockScenario.jpg|thumb|Map of the Sunwell]]
The Sunwell is guarded by [[Sunwell Magus|Sunwell magi]], [[Sunwell Spellbreaker]]s, and [[Sunwell Warden]]s.

====Stage 1 – Anar'alah Belore====
*A meeting of elves.
*Meet with Liadrin

Move closer to Liadrin to finish the stage.

====Stage 2 – Anu Belore Dela'na====
*A Walk to Remember.
*Walk with Thalyssra

Go with the group to the Sunwell to finish the stage.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The sense of power is palpable. As potent as the Nightwell, but of a different nature.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|The Sunwell was corrupted by our enemies, but a naaru's sacrifice purified its waters. Now the essence of the Light sustains us.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The Sunwell has changed... but its beauty remains. It has been so long.}}

====Stage 3 – Shindu Fallah Na!====
*Defeat the void attackers.
*Defeat the void attackers.

Alleria goes to the Sunwell.

:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|Stay back!}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|What is happening?}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|This is why I demanded that Umbric and his radicals be exiled. Anyone who treats with the Void is a danger to the Sunwell!}}

Kill [[Void Effusion (Remember the Sunwell)|Void Effusions]], [[Void Fragment]]s, and [[Creeping Void]]s.

:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I did not intend for my presence to...}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Enough! We need to cleanse this corruption before the well is lost!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Silgryn! Valtrois! Aid the regent lord!}}

====Stage 4 – Belono Sil'aru====
*Defeat the Darkener.
*[[Aruun the Darkener]] slain

:{{Text|say|[[Nether-Prince Durzaan]]|The vessel has been found!}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|It wants the Sunwell!}}

====Stage 5 – Ama Noral'arkhana====
*Close the void rift.
*Void rift closed

:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|Something seeks to open a rift into the chamber. If it comes through, we may lose the Sunwell.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I can close the rift--but I will need help.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Tell us what to do, and we will lend our strength.}}
:{{Text|say|Nether-Prince Durzaan|The door opens. Yes... this should suit our needs.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Now! Focus your power with mine!}}
:{{Text|say|Nether-Prince Durzaan|You only delay the inevitable! I will yet have my prize.}}

====Final Stage – Shorel'aran====
*Leave the Sunwell.
*Leave the Sunwell.

:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|The Sunwell is secure. Your aid was invaluable, Thalyssra. And yours, champion.}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|Guards! Seize this saboteur.}}

All move to Silvermoon Translocator.

:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I will not be taken prisoner in my own homeland.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron: Enough! You will leave at once, Alleria. Accident or no, your presence poses a danger to Quel'Thalas. Go back to Stormwind. Silvermoon is no longer your home.}}

Alleria leaves.

:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I regret you had to witness that exchange, Thalyssra. This is not how I planned your visit to unfold.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|On the contrary. This conflict has demonstrated your dedication to your people. I can see that the Horde has allowed you to uphold your traditions--something that is very important to us.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|We gain strength from our allies... but we have not lost who we are.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Suramar will always be our home. But some among my people wish to venture out into the world, to claim our place in Azeroth once again. To do that, we need allies.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|The Horde offers that to you, First Arcanist. Join us. The gates of Silvermoon stand open to you.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|On behalf of the nightborne, I accept your proposal. From this day forth, Suramar fights for the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Excellent! Lady Liadrin, please return to Orgrimmar and tell the warchief the good news.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|It will be my pleasure, Regent Lord. I will meet you in Silvermoon, champion.}}

Scenario and the quest objective are finished. Use the translocator to teleport back to the Sunfury Spire. Speak with Liadrin to finish the quest.
