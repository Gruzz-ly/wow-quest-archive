==Description==
Champion, the Sunwell holds for now, but the Vanguard has begun to deploy the bulk of its forces to [[Voidstorm]].

Lady Liadrin has requested your assistance at the Sunwell.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|85}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We persevere for now, <name>. The quicker we face [[Xal'atath]] at the [[Voidspire]], the quicker this can all be behind us.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|I have received word from [[Magister Umbric]]. The way to the [[Voidstorm]] is clear!}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|I sent Lady Liadrin to inform the Vanguard's commanders that they may deploy at once, and leave our city in peace.}}

Head to the [[Court of the Phoenix]] and meet up with Lady Liadrin who is speaking to [[General Amias Bellamy]].
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Your redeployment leaves a scant few behind to empower the Sunwell!}}

Speak with Liadrin,
{{Dialogue|Are you coming with us, <name>? Your strength is always welcome.

{{Gossip|quest=|How does the Sunwell fare, Liadrin?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Liadrin|Would you check in with the Vanguard commanders for me, <name>? I must explain to the general why the Sunwell must not fall.}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|You think too provincially. We need the full might of the Vanguard to defeat [[Xal'atath]].}}

Head to Commander Venel Lightblood who is training the [[Silver Hand Defender]]s.
{{Dialogue|Ah, <class>. I trust you're preparing yourself for the fight ahead?

{{Gossip|quest=|Let's give these recruits something to aspire to}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Commander Venel Lightblood|Prepare yourself, <class>}}

Spar with Venel and upon beating him,
:{{Text|Say|Commander Venel Lightblood|Well done, <name>! The Vanguard would do well to emulate your strength and conviction.}}

Head to War Chaplain Senn who is rallying the [[Guardian of the Light (Eversong Woods)|Guardian of the Light]].
:{{Text|Say|War Chaplain Senn|May the light be your shield...}}

Speak with Senn,
{{Dialogue|The Light has plans for you, <name>. I can sense it.

{{Gossip|Will you bless me, Chaplain?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Guardian of the Light|As we are the light's blade!}}
:{{Text|Say|War Chaplain Senn|You are a beacon in the darkness. We will succeed, no matter the cost.}}

Head to Commander Koruth Mountainfist who is prepping the [[Assault Warframe]],
:{{Text|Say|Commander Koruth Mountainfist|Get those modifications fitted or we'll suffocate! The air on the other side is thicker than me gran's lamb stew.}}

Speak with Koruth,
{{Dialogue|I praise the light like any other in its service, <name>.

But I also put on heavy armor and bring some war machines.

{{gossip|quest=|Are the warframes prepared, Commander?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Commander Koruth Mountainfist|My gran taught me to fight the good fight, even if it seems hopeless, and to put me faith in the Light.}}
:{{Text|Say|Commander Koruth Mountainfist|Though, two tons of Light-blessed steel warframe bolsters my courage.}}

Return to Liadrin to turn in.
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|You've asked us repeatedly to leave as soon as a path to Xal'atath was found. So now we are leaving.}}
