==Description==
These threats we chase are intelligent. Determined. Deadly.

Their ingenuity will seek to confound you. Their strength will seek to destroy you. It is from their very will to live--to predate--that we will extract the essence required to fuel the magical defenses of our city.

I have had my assistants lay out our friend's toys. You'd do best to familiarize yourself with them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|85|}}

==Completion==
One fool's trap is another elf's treasure.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Astalor Bloodsworn|This crystal vessel... it's made from an unusually resilient cosmic material. Fascinating.}}
:{{Text|Say|Astalor Bloodsworn|As if it were made to withstand something as volatile as [[Anguish (magic)|anguish]]... This bodes well.}}

Touch the [[Crystalline Vessel]],
{{Dialogue|<This large crimson crystal is warm to the touch. You feel a slight thrum of power. It hovers before you expectantly. Hungrily.>}}

Study the Confiscated Trap and disarm it
:{{Text|Say|Astalor Bloodsworn|We can extract considerable anguish from these targets, but they will seek to undo you at every turn!}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Captured Gnarldin]]|Luck <race>.}}

Upon disarming the second trap, it turns into a Remnant of Anguish
:{{Text|Say|Astalor Bloodsworn|I am well positioned to turn pain into power...}}
:{{Text|Say|Captured Gnarldin|Ha! Got you good. Wait... what is that?}}

Upon studying the remnant,
:{{Text|Say|Captured Gnarldin|Raaagh!}}

Upon studying the Coalesced Anguish, it turned into a weakened Coalesced Anguish.
:{{Text|Say|Astalor Bloodsworn|Be careful, champion. Our magic is almost as deadly as our prey.}}
