==Objectives==
Meet Liadrin at Auchindoun in Talador.

==Description==
Your ally, Liadrin, has sent a missive requesting aid near Auchindoun. The Sargerei have made a new assault there and breached something important. It is no coincidence this happened after Gul'dan's ascendancy. We will watch the front here, commander.

==Completion==
I know the battle for Tanaan presses sorely on your forces commander. I am glad you came. The Sargerei and Gul'dan have the same masters, so this new attack likely affects you as well.

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 experience
*[[Oil]] (25)

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.2.0|note=Added.}}
