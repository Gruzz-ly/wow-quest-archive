==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Alexi Barov.jpg|Alexi Barov|Ex-brother and traitorous filth.}}
Collect the Head of Alexi Barov.
*[[Head of Alexi Barov]]

==Description==
I was a fool to trust him after the fiasco over the Barov family fortune! What I should have done is killed him the first chance I had.

And now he thinks he's going to plumb this land for all that it's worth and cut me out?!

No, dear brother, not this time! There can only be one CEO of Barov Industries and it will be me.

My peasant friend, you must do me this service. Find my brother, Alexi, and serve him a notice of termination!

You will likely find him out in the wilds, near small timber.

==Rewards==
You will receive:{{cost|1|54|}} (or {{cost|29|25|50}} if completed at level 100)
*[[Barov Lumberjack Caller]]

==Progress==
Did you deliver the... notice of termination?

==Completion==
<Weldon holds Alexi's head up to his face and begins speaking.>

You no-good, backstabbing son-of-a-goat! Your greed is only surpassed by my own!

As for you my peasant friend, you have served me well. Here are your just rewards!

== Notes ==
Alexi and his guards will spawn at the first Small Timber you come across.  It would therefore be best if you find one outside Lunarfall, as there would be plenty of space to fight and no mobs to aggro.
