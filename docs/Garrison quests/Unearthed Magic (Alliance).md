==Objectives==
Find the Strange Stone near your garrison mine.
*[[Strange Stone]]

==Description==
Commander, I've heard reports of a strange stone found in the garrison mine. The miners aren't sure what to make of it, but I have a feeling it could be useful.

When you next find yourself at the mine, it may be worth investigating. And if you don't mind, I would love to see the stone for myself.

==Rewards==
*[[Ultimate Battle-Training Stone]]

==Progress==
Greetings sir.  Have you found the stone?

==Completion==
So it's as I imagined, a battle-stone!

I've been able to collect similar stones here in Draenor, but never one this large!  A rare find indeed.
