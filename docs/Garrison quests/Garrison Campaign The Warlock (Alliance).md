==Objectives==
Speak with the warlock at Lion's Watch in Tanaan Jungle.
*Speak with the warlock
*Go to the Vault of the Earth
*Stop Gul'dan

==Description==
Commander, you have a visitor. One of Gul'dan's warlocks just walked up to the base and surrendered. He says he has information of a terrible event that is about to occur. I suggest you speak with him immediately.

==Completion==
I was too late to give you the message. I am truly sorry. These poor shamans... if only I had known sooner!

Gul'dan has prepared everything for his ritual. He will use the cipher and his own fel magic to corrupt an elemental lord and use it to sunder the elemental link to the land. This will cause a massive upheaval across Draenor!

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 experience

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.2.0|note=Added.}}
