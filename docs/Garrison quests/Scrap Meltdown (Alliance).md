==Objectives==
[[Kristen Stoneforge]] wants you to collect 25 [[Iron Horde Scraps]].
* [[Iron Horde Scraps]] x25

==Description==
We've had a breakthrough in melting down the scraps you've been collecting! If you can get me a small pile of 'em, we can get your troops something a bit more useful.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|Follower upgrade tokens|Armor Enhancement Token|Weapon Enhancement Token}}

==Progress==
Do you have the scraps I asked for?

==Completion==
Here ya are, commander. We've got to let the forges cool for a while, but we should be ready to process more scraps tomorrow.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Gold removed as the additional reward.}}
* {{Patch 6.1.0|note=Added.}}
