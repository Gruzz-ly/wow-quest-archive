'''The Search Continues''' is about locating and looting a [[Strange Brass Compass]] and killing the end boss [[Skulloc]] in [[Iron Docks]]. To Receive the quest you need to have built an [[Lunarfall Inn]]/[[Frostwall Tavern]] in your Garrison and wait for [[Fleet Master Seahorn]] to spawn. Its only available after you already completed [[The Brass Compass]].

==Objectives==
Find the Brass Compass at the [[Iron Docks]].
*[[Strange Brass Compass]]
*[[Skulloc]] slain

==Description==
An old deckhand inspected that device you brought us, and thinks it was quite the forgery. This Iron Horde is trying to copy the mechanism, but they don't quite have the technology.

When you get right down to it, we're not sure how these primitive beasts got a hold of this kind of tool. Wouldn't be half as good of a sea tale if we knew, ha!

We've still got a pile of treasure with your name on it, if you can find us the real compass.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*[[Supply of Storied Rarities]]

==Progress==
Did you find the compass?

==Completion==
Let's hope this is the real thing, every time I go through that portal I feel my fur stand on end.

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2014-12-03|bluenote=To encourage players to not leave in the middle of a run with a Dungeon Finder group, quests received from the Garrison Inn now requires the final boss of the Dungeon to be defeated.}}
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
