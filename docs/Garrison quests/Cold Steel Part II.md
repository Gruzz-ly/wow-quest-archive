==Objectives==
Find an Iron Autocannon in [[Grimrail Depot]].
*[[Iron Autocannon]] 
*[[Skylord Tovra]] slain

==Description==
Hey, you.

I wanted to thank you for what you did for me. The feel of that cannon in my hands is all the therapy I'll ever need. But now...

<Keeshan stares off into the distance and grimaces.>...I'm all out of bullets.

Guess I'll just sit here and wait to die.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15070 [[XP]]
*[[Box of Storied Treasures]]

==Progress==
Leave me alone.

==Completion==
Ah, that's the stuff. I'm going to run out of ammo, but at least I've got something to live for, for a while.
