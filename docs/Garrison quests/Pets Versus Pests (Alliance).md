==Objectives==
Defeat the three pests in your garrison.
*[[Carrotus Maximus]] defeated
*[[Gorefu]] defeated
*[[Gnawface]] defeated

==Description==
I've been trying to get this place ready for your pets, but we've uncovered some rude pests while building the garrison.  I tried to take care of them myself, but they are too tough for my meager team.

There's an angry carrot in the garden, an enormous rat eating our food rations, and an ornery water creature harassing the fishermen.  If you can take care of them, I'll be free to finish up my work on your menagerie.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|15|40|}}

== Progress ==
Any luck?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.  Let's see if your pets like their new space!

==Patch changes==
