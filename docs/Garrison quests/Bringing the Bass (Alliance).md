Collect a Bass Blaster, Laz-Tron Disc Reader, Phonic Amplifier, S.P.R.K. Capacitor, and a Cord of Ancient Wood.
*[[Bass Blaster]] {{co|57.8|10.9|Nagrand (alternate universe)}}
*[[Laz-Tron Disc Reader]] {{co|55.5|90.6|Spires of Arak}}
*[[Phonic Amplifier]] {{co|52|11|Spires of Arak}}
*[[S.P.R.K. Capacitor]]
*[[Cord of Ancient Wood]]

==Description==
It's a bit quiet around here, in between the invasions and all.

You're in luck though, Commander! I can fix that, and boost morale among your troops all at the same time.

All you need to do is bring me a few items from around Draenor, and I'll fill your garrison with music. I'll even through in a few music rolls from my own collection to get you started!

What do you say?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Stash of Dusty Music Rolls]]
*[[Garrison Jukebox]]

==Progress==
Collect a Bass Blaster, Laz-Tron Disc Reader, Phonic Amplifer, S.P.R.K. Capacitor, and a Cord of Ancient Wood.

==Completion==
This is the best Draenor has to offer? Lucky for you I went to engineering school. One Tune-O-Tron 5000 coming up!

==Notes==
For a hint, speak with the quest giver again:
:Great day for some tunes, eh Commander?
{{gossip|''Where are the jukebox parts?''}}
:Need some help with the shopping list?

:I hate to encourage theft, but the ogres partying at the {{Au|Ring of Blood}} love their Bass Blaster. I doubt they'll be in a fighting mood, but don't stick around after you swipe it from them.

:I had a Laz-tron Disc Reader stolen from me a few weeks ago, and I couldn't get the goblin smell out of my bunk for a week. Check [[Pinchwhistle Point]].

:Phonic Amplifiers are tough to find. A piece of metal from an [[arakkoa]] construct might be enough.

:If you're up to sticking it to some [[Iron Horde]], their shredders in [[Talador]] usually have the sort of capacitor I need.

:And for the finishing touch, wood from the [[Draenor ancient|ancients]] in [[Gorgrond]], if the Commandojacks have spared any.

From Lunarfall, fly to [[Akeeta's Hovel]] on the border between [[Spires of Arak]] and {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}. Run north to {{Au|Skettis}}. A [[Phonic Amplifier]] will drop from any [[Stalwart Warden]] in the area.

Fly to [[Pinchwhistle Gearworks]] and run south to [[Pinchwhistle Point]]. The [[Laz-Tron Disc Reader]] is at {{co|55.5|90.6|Spires of Arak}} on the upper floor of the inn. Looting it will spawn a hostile Spore-addled Goblin.
:{{text|say|Spore-addled Goblin|Hey... that's mine! I think...}}

Fly to [[Redemption Rise]] in [[Talador]]. The [[S.P.R.K. Capacitor]] will drop from any [[Iron Shredder]] in the [[Iron Horde]] camps in the area, like [[Mor'gran Logworks]].

Fly to [[Joz's Rylaks]] in {{Au|Nagrand}} and run north to the [[Ring of Blood]]. Northeast of the ring itself, find three Party Animals dancing behind the [[Bass Blaster]] at {{co|57.8|10.9|Nagrand (alternate universe)}} The ogres are upset, but won't attack:
:{{text|say|Party Animal|Please no hurts us. Just party ogres!}}
:{{text|say|Party Animal|Why you do this?}}
:{{text|say|Party Animal|Party pooper!}}

Finally, fly to the [[Everbloom Wilds]] in [[Gorgrond]]. The [[Cord of Ancient Wood]] drops from any [[Draenor ancient]] in the quest area, like a [[Lumbering Ancient]].

On complete, the [[Tune-O-Tron 5000]] spawns next to Fix. Open the [[Stash of Dusty Music Rolls]] to acquire the seven faction racial tunes:
*[[Music Roll: Curse of the Worgen]]
*[[Music Roll: Gnomeregan]]
*[[Music Roll: Exodar]]
*[[Music Roll: Ironforge]]
*[[Music Roll: Night Song]]
*[[Music Roll: Stormwind]]
*[[Music Roll: Way of the Monk]]

There are many more to be found. Biggswrench lists a few hints, which are listed on the [[Garrison Jukebox]] article.
