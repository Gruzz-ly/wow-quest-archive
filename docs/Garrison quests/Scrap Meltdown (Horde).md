==Objectives==
[[Grun'lek]] wants you to collect 25 [[Iron Horde Scraps]].

We've figured out how to make those scraps in to something a bit more useful to your troops. Bring me a pile of them and I'll have our smiths process it for you.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|Follower upgrade tokens|Armor Enhancement Token|Weapon Enhancement Token}}

==Progress==
Do you have the scraps I asked for?

Very good, commander. This should prove useful to your troops.
