'''The Brass Compass''' is about locating and looting a [[Strange Brass Compass]] and killing the end boss [[Skulloc]] in [[Iron Docks]]. To Receive the quest you need to have built an [[Lunarfall Inn]]/[[Frostwall Tavern]] in your Garrison and wait for [[Fleet Master Seahorn]] to spawn. Is part of the [[Stay Awhile and Listen]] Achievement.  Next time Fleet Master Seahorn visits your inn/tavern he will offer the daily quest [[The Search Continues (Draenor)]] if you already completed ''The Brass Compass''.

==Objectives==
Find the Brass Compass at the [[Iron Docks]].
*[[Strange Brass Compass]]
 
*[[Skulloc]] slain

==Description==
Greetings, commander. I have come on a mission directly from the captain.

Aboard any vessel on Azeroth that's manned by at least one orc, you'll hear sea shanties sung about a device capable of navigating the broad, rough ocean of Draenor. The orcs used it to keep their heading true in the choppiest of storms.

Perhaps it's just an old sea tale, but this one chance to find that kind of prize has the captain willing to part with some fine treasure.

==Rewards==

==Completion==
This might just be what we were looking for. Here's your booty.
