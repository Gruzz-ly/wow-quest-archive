==Objectives==
Collect a Dark Parchment from the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds.
*[[Dark Parchment (quest item)]]
*[[Ner'zhul (tactics)|Ner'zhul]] slain

==Description==
We have reviewed Ner'zhul's notes, which you brought to us previously. Though we are closer to understanding how these warlocks have learned to bind souls and control the undead, the picture is incomplete.

We will need more pages if we are to see the whole picture. I do not want to experiment with partial information and create an abomination. There are enough of those in Northrend as it is.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Supply of Storied Rarities}}

==Progress==
Did you find any of Ner'zhul's notes?

==Completion==
We are greatful{{sic}} for your aid. I shall retire shortly.

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2014-12-03|bluenote=To encourage players to not leave in the middle of a run with a Dungeon Finder group, quests received from the Garrison Inn now requires the final boss of the Dungeon to be defeated.}}
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
