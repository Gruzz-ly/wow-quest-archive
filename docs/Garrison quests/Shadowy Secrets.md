==Objectives==
Collect a Dark Parchment from the [[Shadowmoon Burial Grounds]].
*[[Dark Parchment (quest item)]]
*[[Ner'zhul (tactics)|Ner'zhul]] slain

==Description==
Though the [[Lich King]] has been defeated, we are no closer to unlocking the secrets of the Frozen Throne than we were when jousting pointlessly at the Argent Tournament. [[Bolvar]] remains resigned to his fate.

Perhaps there is something here, though, that can aid us. Ner'zhul was not always the Lich King, you know. Once, he was a mere orc dabbling in dark powers beyond his comprehension.

Find whatever you can of his early studies, and we may have our answers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Void Totem]]

==Progress==
Did you find any of Ner'zhul's notes?

==Completion==
You have my thanks. I will bring this back to the Ebon Hold immediately.

Take this, I... acquired it... from one of the Shadowmoon.

==Criteria of==
*[[Stay Awhile and Listen]]
