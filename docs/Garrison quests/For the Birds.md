==Objectives==
Find a Tiny Peachick Hatchling in [[The Everbloom]].
*[[Tiny Peachick Hatchling]]
*[[Yalnu]] slain

==Description==
Hi! Have you ever held a peachick hatchling?

<Without warning, Mylune grabs both of your hands and then stuffs a tiny chirping bird in them.>

Isn't it so small and light and downy? Like you're holding a beaky peepy lil' CLOUD! It's so adorable you can't help but hug it and cuddle it and stuff regurgitated food in its teeny-tiny mouth.

<Name>, the plantfolk in the Everbloom are turning peachicks into monsters before they can grow into beautiful swans. Or whatever they grow into. Please help them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Everbloom Peachick]]
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you rescued a peachick? We're all they have, and those awful plant creatures are doing terrible things to them!

<Mylune's voice suddenly drops two octaves and sends a chill up your spine.>

Terrible. Things.

==Completion==
<Mylune gently lifts the tiny little bird to her face, nuzzling it. It crawls onto her shoulder and disappears into her nest of green hair. A moment later, a beautiful fan of brightly-colored tailfeathers emerges from the top of her head.>

<Mylune's bright blue eyes grow moist with tears and her mouth goes slack with adoration. You've made the dryad VERY happy.>
