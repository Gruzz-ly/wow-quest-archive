==Objectives==
Find a Tiny Peachick Hatchling in [[The Everbloom]].
*[[Tiny Peachick Hatchling]]
*[[Yalnu]] slain

==Description==
<Name>!  Have you met the peachick you saved the other day?

<Mylune holds up a peachick hatchling, then trills and twitters at it.  She gestures to you, says your name, then continues chirping animatedly to the little bird.  The two ignore you and engage in a lengthy bird-conversation, long enough to make you feel awkward.  Finally the dryad turns her attention back to you.>

Did you hear that?  More peachicks are still trapped in the Everbloom!  If you don't save them... well, you heard what will happen!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*[[Box of Storied Treasures]]

==Progress==
<Mylune stamps her hooves impatiently.>

==Completion==
Oh, thank you <name>!  You've made a lot of wee baby birds very happy.

<A half-dozen peachicks emerge from the green nest of Mylune's hair and blurt at you with a cacophony of tweets, then abruptly disappear back into her hair in unison.>

<Mylune leans down, pokes you in the nose, and whispers:>

You're my favorite <race>!
