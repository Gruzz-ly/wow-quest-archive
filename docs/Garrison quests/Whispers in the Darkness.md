==Objectives==
Find a Void-Gate Key in the [[Shadowmoon Burial Grounds]].
*[[Void-Gate Key]]
*[[Ner'zhul]] slain

==Description==
If you don't mind, I'm trying VERY hard to prevent all of our worlds from collapsing into the void, AGAIN.

Oh, right, you helped me last time, didn't you? Well, you've got great timing. I'm in need of another Gate-Key.

Well? Go on! The infinite horrors of the abyss aren't just going to wait until you've had a nap! Having that many tentacles makes them really antsy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15070 [[XP]]
*[[Box of Storied Treasures]]

==Progress==
You do know that any time you waste talking to me brings us closer to doom, right?

==Completion==
Perfect, here's a prize for your efforts.

I've got to head out and save everyone now. Again.
