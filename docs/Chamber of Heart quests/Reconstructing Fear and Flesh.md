==Objectives==
Collect Torn Pages of "Fear and Flesh" from Corrupted or Lost Areas within [[Horrific Vision]]s for [[Wrathion]] in the [[Chamber of Heart]].
* [[Torn Page of "Fear and Flesh"]] (2)

==Description==
Another tome written by one lost to [[N'Zoth]]'s madness. I dread to think of what vile words await us within it.

But if we are to strengthen [[Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve|your cloak]], then we must know more of that which it was meant to resist. See if you can find the remaining pages so that we can complete this tome and make use of the knowledge it holds. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Horrific Core]]
*{{cost|17|60|}}
*13,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The missing pages must reside deeper within those visions.

As dark and difficult these times may seem, we mustn't forget the possibility remains of a time of great success and discovery.

==Completion==
Perserverance in the face of darkness.

Our work continues...

==Notes==
First offered in the second week of patch 8.3, players must now complete two of the medium-difficulty areas. This is possible to do in one run.

Every quest after this point will be offered in a subsequent week.

==Progression==
{{Ashjra'kamas upgrades}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
