==Objectives==
Collect Torn Pages of "The Curse of Stone" from Horrific Visions for [[Wrathion]] in the [[Chamber of Heart]]
* [[Torn Page of "The Curse of Stone"]]

==Description==
Thus far, the contents of this book are unsettling to say the least. Nevertheless, I have been able to glean valuable information on the nature of [[N'Zoth]]'s power, and have made alterations to [[Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve|your cloak]] accordingly.

There remains much to learn, however. Continue your search for additional pages as you delve into the visions. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Corrupting Core]]
*{{cost|17|60|}}
*13,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Urgent matters require a great deal of attention. Unless it is of the utmost importance, I must see to my work. 

==Completion==
Fine work, indeed.

==Notes==
The quest item is looted upon a successful completion of a [[Vision of N'Zoth|Horrific Vision]].

==Progression==
{{Ashjra'kamas upgrades}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
