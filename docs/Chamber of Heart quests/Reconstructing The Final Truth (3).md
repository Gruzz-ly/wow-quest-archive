==Objectives==
Collect Torn Pages of "The Final Truth" from Lost Areas within [[Horrific Vision]]s for [[Wrathion]] in the [[Chamber of Heart]].
* [[Torn Page of "The Final Truth"]] (2)

==Description==
Long have I studied the secrets of the [[Old God]]s. I have traversed the whole of [[Azeroth]] in search of esoteric texts, lost archives, and forbidden knowledge, all in the name of preparing for the horror to come.

No amount of research could have prepared me for the depths of insanity I would find within this book. A madness so absolute that only the [[Shath'Yar]] language can convey it.

Find me the final pages of this accursed tome, <name>. I wish to learn what I need from it and be done with it forever.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Voidborn Core]]
*{{cost|17|60|}}
*13,390 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The whispers of [[Ny'alotha]] surround us. I believe you are ready for the final task, are you not?

==Completion==
The works are complete. Together, they tell the tale of a descent into complete madness. How one deception leads to another, until reality itself is held in contempt. There is no "truth" to be found here.

No longer should you feel the need to run from the whispers, <name>. You are ready to silence them.

==Notes==
Before ''Shadowlands'', 8 quest items were the objective.
