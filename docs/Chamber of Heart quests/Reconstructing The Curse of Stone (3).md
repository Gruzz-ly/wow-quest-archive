==Objectives==
Collect Torn Pages of "The Curse of Stone" from Horrific Visions for [[Wrathion]] in the [[Chamber of Heart]]
* [[Torn Page of "The Curse of Stone"]]

==Description==
[[N'Zoth]] is nothing if not subtle and insidious. I can see how an impressionable mind could be turned against the [[Titan]]s by reading these words. Thankfully, we are not so susceptible to such manipulation, are we?

The book is nearly complete. Continue retrieving its pages from within the visions. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Corrupting Core]]
*{{cost|17|60|}}
*13,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I believe we are on the precipice of a something grand.

==Completion==
A job well done, <name>.

It's time we advanced our efforts. 

==Notes==
The quest item is looted upon a successful completion of a [[Vision of N'Zoth|Horrific Vision]].
