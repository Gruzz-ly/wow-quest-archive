==Objectives==
Collect Torn Pages of "The Curse of Stone" from [[Horrific Vision]]s for [[Wrathion]] in the [[Chamber of Heart]].
* [[Torn Page of "The Curse of Stone"]]

==Description==
I came across several references to this book in my research of [[Ny'alotha]]. Penned by a neophyte cultist, it documents the "lies of the [[Titans]]" and the "injustices" they inflicted upon the denizens of [[Azeroth]].

Mad ravings, intended to erode the reader's acceptance of reality.

Still, by studying this work, we can gain a better understanding of the [[Old God]]'s power, and thus tailor [[Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve|the cloak]] to offer better protection against it.

Bring as many pages from this tome as you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Corrupting Core]]
*{{cost|17|60|}}
*13,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you been able to find?

==Completion==
Excellent work. This tome should prove quite enlightening.

==Notes==
The quest item is looted upon a successful completion of a [[Vision of N'Zoth|Horrific Vision]].

==Progression==
{{Ashjra'kamas upgrades}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
