==Objectives==
Kill 30 Unbound Flame Spirits.
*[[Unbound Flame Spirit]] slain x30
*[[Flameseer's Staff]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Blazebound Elemental|large elementals]] that besiege us are not a singular entity.

They are an amalgamation of lesser spirits bound together by the [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists' magic.

The rebuilt flameseer's staff will give us enough power to shatter its bonds.

Destroy the smaller elementals once you've broken up the more dangerous large ones.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. This will help us turn the tide against the enemy.

==Notes==
Head out to a burning area, find a Blazebound Revenant and use the Flameseer's Staff on it. It will die, shattering into 10 Unbound Flame Spirits, each with 3095 health. Do a quick AoE to take them all out.

==Progression==
