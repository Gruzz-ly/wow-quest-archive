== Objectives ==
Kill Okrog outside the [[Seat of the Chosen]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[Okrog]] slain

== Description ==
Listen, <name>. I found out what they're doing with {{NPC||Jarod Shadowsong}}. He's scheduled to be sacrificed by the ogres of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] as part of this year's initiation.

I heard that the initiate charged with delivering the speech ahead of the sacrifice is an ogre named Okrog, but get this: you were a close second.

We need you to deliver that speech if we're to free Jarod. Don't worry—I'll write you some cue cards—just make sure Okrog has an "accident" as he leaves the Seat of the Chosen.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Well, <name>?

== Completion ==
Excellent work, <name>. Our plan's almost come together.

== Notes ==
Head back to the Seat of the Chosen and follow the road counterclockwise back to the south. Okrog should spawn walking away along the road to the south.

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}

==Patch changes==
