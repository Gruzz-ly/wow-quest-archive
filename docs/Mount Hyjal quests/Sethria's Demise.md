== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Sethria2.jpg|Sethria|As soon as she reveals her dragon form, signal us for help!}}
Slay the dragon Sethria. Once she reveals her true form, you will need to use the signal rocket to call in reinforcements!
*[[Sethria]] slain
*[[Thisalee's Signal Rocket]] (provided)

== Description ==
While you've been raiding [[Sethria's Roost|Sethria's nest]], messages have been flying back and forth between here and [[Shrine of Aviana|the shrine]]. {{NPC||Skylord Omnuron}} was at first reluctant, but I've persuaded my fellow druids to risk a direct assault on Sethria herself.

Everyone agreed to my plan... provided YOU spearhead the attack.

Take this signal rocket and engage Sethria on the far ridge. When she reveals her true colors and shifts to her dragon form, fire the rocket and backup will arrive to help you!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
If a minor dragon like Sethria can cause us so many problems, I hate to see what else [[Twilight's Hammer]] has in store...

== Completion ==
Sethria is slain! I knew it was worth the risk.

I'll stay here to look for survivors, but I imagine they'll want to see you back at the shrine.

== Notes ==
Head down to the very southern end of [[Mount Hyjal]]. At The southernmost ledge of [[Sethria's Roost]] is Sethria herself, at {{coords|35.5|97.9|Mount Hyjal}} in human form. She has ~371,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Twilight Bolt|Inflicts Shadow damage.|range=40|notes=2.0 sec cast. 1400-2000 Shadow damage}}
*{{abilities|Twilight Fissure|range=50,000|Deals 11795 to 15102 Shadow damage to any enemy standing within the Shadow fissure after 5 sec.|notes=1.6 sec cast|cd=5 sec}}
**{{abilities|Void Blast|range=50,000|Deals Shadow damage to any enemy standing within the Shadow fissure after 5 sec.|notes=2400-2700 Shadow damage despite the tooltip}}
After knocking her down to 66% health (roughly 120,000 or so damage), she will do a massive knockback and shift to her dragon form. Take the knockback opportunity to use the signal rocket to call in help! In dragon form, she stops casting Twilight Bolt, retains Twilight Fissure and gains Twilight Breath:
*{{abilities|Twilight Breath|range=15|Inflicts 5063 to 6171 Shadowflame damage to enemies in a cone in front of the caster.|notes=Instant. Hitting for 11-1700 Shadowflame, despite the tooltip.}}
*Melee swings for 600-1000 Physical on cloth
She has 557,000 max health/40810 max mana in her dragon form, but she is at the same ratio of health/mana she was at before the shift (now roughly 400,000 health).

[[Druid of the Talon (Cataclysm)|Druids of the Talon]] have the following abilities:
*{{abilities|[[Wrath]]|Hurls a bolt of lightning at an enemy, inflicting Nature damage.|range=40|notes=1300-1600 Nature damage.}}
*Melee swings for 500-730
Aggro
:{{text|say|Sethria|This is our mountain now, mortal. Begone!}}
On entering dragon form:
:{{text|say|Sethria|You are little more than insects!  When I am done with you, I will burn your shrine to the ground!}}
Using the signal rocket:
:{{text|say|Druid of the Talon|We're coming, <name>!  Keep her occupied while we loop around for an attack.}}
Death:
:{{text|say|Sethria|You buy time... but not your lives... my hatchery remains...}}
