== Objectives ==
Locate the [[The Twilight Apocrypha|Twilight Apocrypha]] inside of [[Gar'gol's Hovel]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
<During your brief communion with the [[Eye of Twilight|Eye]], you felt that its power source lay deep within the hovel. You felt the weight of a powerful tome, binding together four elements.>

<Mastering the Eye will require you to search the hovel for this tome.>

== Completion ==
<A heavy tome, bound in flesh, lies open on the table.>

<The language - pictographic and scrawled in rust-colored ink - is undecipherable, but notes and translations are tucked within several pages. This must be what you're looking for.>

== Notes ==
Enter the cave and keep taking forks that lead southeast. {{NPC||Kristoff Manheim}} is hanging from a meat hook at {{co|27.2|40.8|Mount Hyjal||1}} and is ''not'' a happy camper. He offers [[Gar'gol's Gotta Go]]. Do it so there's a reason to loop back to the southwest and kill Gar'gol, but keep heading southwest before turning in to find the Twilight Apocrypha at {{co|25.8|41.7|Mount Hyjal||1}}, surrounded by crucibles of the four elements: Air, Earth, Fire and Water.

This quest may be a possible reference to the Master of Puppets song by the Heavy Metal band; Metallica.
