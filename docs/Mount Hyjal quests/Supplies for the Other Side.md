This quest is offered among the daily quests after the completion of [[Into the Depths (Molten Front)]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 7 Blueroot Vines.
*[[Blueroot Vine]] (7)

==Description==
One of the biggest dangers that our druids face when fighting within the [[Firelands]] is simple dehydration. Our proveditors spend a significant amount of time preparing canteens for the troops on the other side. We do have other methods, however.

In the greener thickets to the east, you should still find some blueroot vines which have not yet burned. These plants hold a tremendous amount of water in their roots - and also provide some energy for the weary soldier.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*[[Mark of the World Tree]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Let's see... how many have you managed to gather?

==Completion==
I will have these packaged and shipped off right away.

==Notes==
Blueroot Vine shows up on the minimap for [[Herbalist]]s. It can be found all over the valley in the Regrowth.

==Progression==
{{Firelands invasion part one}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.2.0|note=Added.}}
