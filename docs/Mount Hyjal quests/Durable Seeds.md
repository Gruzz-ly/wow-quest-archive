==Objectives==
Gather 10 Hyjal Seedlings from piles of Scorched Soil.
*[[Hyjal Seedling]] x10

==Description==
This land has been scourged by fire, but it may yet renew itself.

Some seeds deep in the soil may have withstood the scorching heat here in The [[Flamewake]]. These durable plants are the key to this forest's regrowth. Please, collect some of these seedlings for me.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
I suspect life still struggles beneath the ash. What were you able to find?

==Completion==
<The Arch Druid inspects the seedlings.>

These seedlings have survived an apocalypse. Even a handful hold great power. Life always replenishes itself, often stronger than before.

Once the way is clear, we will use these to perform a miracle on this mountain, <name>. You will see.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fresh Bait]] and [[Firebreak]] before heading out. Head northeast into the [[Flamewake]] -- much more target-rich environment.

==Progression==
{{Sanctuary of Malorne}}

==Patch changes==
