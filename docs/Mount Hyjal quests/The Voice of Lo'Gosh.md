== Objectives ==
Locate {{NPC||Takrik Ragehowl}} near the [[Shrine of Goldrinn]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
Have you heard of Lo'Gosh, the wolf ancient? In the Alliance tongue, he is known as "[[Goldrinn]]."

I don't need to tell you how important the wolf god has been to the Horde - his tenacity under adversity has been an inspiration to all of our disparate races.

Southwest of here, down in the valley, lies a shrine to Goldrinn. My friend Takrik Ragehowl was refurbishing the shrine when I stopped hearing from him. I fear the worst.

Please find Takrik and make sure the shrine is okay!

== Completion ==
Lok'tar, <class>! Don't worry about this cage - these animals will come to fear me before long.

My first priority is to clear this filth away from my beloved shrine.

== Notes ==
Follow the road to the southwest and take the first fork to the right leading down into the valley. Takrik Ragehowl and {{NPC||Ian Duran}} are in cages just south of the shrine proper at {{co|30.1|31.3|Mount Hyjal||1}} west of the lake. The shrine is alight thanks to the work of {{NPC||Lycanthoth Vandal}}s.
