== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Bileberries.
*[[Bileberry]] (8)

== Description ==
We will decimate the [[Twilight's Hammer]] by corrupting and subverting them.

Seeing that you have no intention of releasing me from my bonds, I require you to collect some reagents for me. My own [[demon]]ic essence has corrupted the plant life around my shrine here. I need you to harvest some bileberries from the wailing weeds that surround [[Blackhorn's Penance|this tower]].

My little pets will attempt to harvest YOU in return. Try not to let them agitate one another.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Bileberry Smelling Salts|Seedfilter Deflector|Deathseed Crushers}}

== Progress ==
Has the local flora been giving you a hard time?

<Blackhorn grins disturbingly.>

== Completion ==
Very good. Please crush the berries into a pulpy liquid. That's quite an aroma isn't it?

Now now, don't gag. It's beneath you.

== Notes ==
Kill {{NPC||Wailing Weed}}s to collect 8 Bileberries.

:You have talent, <name>. But mercy makes you weak.
