== Objectives ==
Destroy 10 Twilight Arms crates.
*[[Twilight Arms Crate]] Destroyed (10)

== Description ==
The weapons the [[Twilight's Hammer]] uses against us are crafted by [[Forgemaster Pyrendius|Forgemaster Pyrenduis]] within [[Firelands Forgeworks|these very halls]]. The metal slices through armor like cheese in the hands of its wielder. Yet, when captured, the steel turns brittle and shatters.

So be it, <name>. I'd rather see those cursed arms smashed than delivered to our enemy.

Seek out the crates of Twilight arms in these caverns and smash them to pieces.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
So. Have you done any damage?

== Completion ==
Good, good. I like nothing more than to see the works of our enemy destroyed.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Crushing the Cores]] and [[Rage of the Wolf Ancient]] before heading out. Crates are everywhere in the cave.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
