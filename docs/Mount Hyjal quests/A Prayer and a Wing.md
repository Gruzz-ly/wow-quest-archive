== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Blaithe.jpg|Blaithe|Use the Enormous Bird Call to summon Blaithe.}}
Use the Enormous Bird Call at one of Blaithe's Nests perched atop the [[Rim of the World]]. Kill {{NPC||Blaithe}} and gather one of his Ancient Feathers.
*[[Ancient Feather]]
*[[Enormous Bird Call]] (provided)

== Description ==
A winged visage? Could it be...?

<Name>, there's no time to waste. You may have been speaking to {{NPC||Aviana}} herself, trying to return to us.

I'll need something from Aviana's past to reach out to her. High atop the ridge overlooking [[Shrine of Aviana|this shrine]], you'll find a series of huge nests belonging to Blaithe, an ancient bird of prey that was once her consort. For ten thousand years he's been mad with grief.

Go to one of his roosts, and use this call to summon him. Kill Blaithe and bring me one of his feathers.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Shoulderpads of Dead Memories|Griefsoul Wristguards|Heartcrush Greathammer}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Don't trouble yourself over Blaithe's condition. Grief robbed that creature of a soul epochs ago. He was but a shell of his former self, a beast of pure rage.

== Completion ==
That was nasty work, <name>, but it had to be done.

And if Aviana is truly to be resurrected, then perhaps your actions have enabled Blaithe to someday come back as well?

Now let's see if we can contact our long lost guardian...

Roosts are at on the ridges north of the shrine. There is also a roost on the ridge to the southwest.

On summon:

On complete:
:{{text|say|Choluna|Mother of all winged creatures, hear my prayer and reveal yourself... a vision! What could this mean, <name>? I will report this to Omnuron.}}
:''The Vision of Aviana's Egg suddenly appears.''
:{{text|say|Vision of Sethria|This is the one. The ancient will be ours.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Sethria|Take the others to the [[Firelands Hatchery]]! Soon we will possess the skies.}}

Skylord Omnuron offers the followup, [[Fact-Finding Mission]], upon the completion of both this quest and [[A Bird in Hand]], the conclusion of the Wormwing chain offered by {{NPC||Thisalee Crow}}.
