== Objectives ==
Report to [[Matoclaw]] at the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

== Description ==
We should not worry about this "[[Druids of the Flame|Druid of the Flame]]" for the time being. We must be concerned with the continuance of our operation.

Return to Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne. If [[Ragnaros]] was prepared for our arrival, then I anticipate that his forces will launch a counterattack soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6940 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|65|50}} at max level)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

== Completion ==
What happened up there? I saw fire and... never mind, you can tell me later. We have other, more immediate matters to attend to.

== Notes ==
Back down to the southwest.

==Progression==
{{Firelands invasion part one}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.2.0|note=Added.}}
