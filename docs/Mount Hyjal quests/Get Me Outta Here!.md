== Objectives ==
Escort {{NPC||Kristoff Manheim||Kristoff}} out of [[Gar'gol's Hovel]].
*Kristoff Escored Out

== Description ==
<You reach up to unfasten Kristoff's bonds.>

Good! Make a break for the exit, and I'll follow.

If we get separated, check back here to make sure I haven't been recaptured.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Hood of Misplaced Dreams|Neglected Footpads|Shoulderguards of Empty Memory}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
Kristoff, Kristoff... Oh yes, I remember now. I recall sending him on what amounted to a suicide mission.

He survived? I suppose that means he failed.

Still, you deserve at least some coin for the trouble.

== Notes ==
Don't accept this quest until finishing other objectives in the cave, namely completing [[Mastering Puppets]] and [[Elementary!]] After picking up [[Return to Duskwhisper]], loop back here to do the escort.

Accordingly, the gossip text updates as players are being offered this quest:
:Well? Are you going to help me down?
{{gossip|''Um, no. Would you mind hanging out a little longer? I have some stuff I need to take care of first.''}}
:You... WHAT?
:Come over here and say that!
:<Kristoff kicks and flails his limbs in a frothing rage, his head twisting around to glare at you.>
:So help me, I will - I am going to - I will knock your brains out! I will fill the empty cavity left behind with my boot! Come here! GET BACK HERE!
:<Kristoff strains to grasp your neck, his fingers waggling inches from your face.>

On accept:
:{{text|say|Kristoff Manheim|Okay, let's do this! You fight the ogres, and I will... not fight them. Head for the exit!}}
Kristoff has random gossip text now, too:
*I don't recommend hanging from a chain like that. But to be honest, it did great things for my hair.
*I'd lend a hand, but I've got... chain rash. I'll just hang back a little.
*Ogres.<br/>I hate ogres.
*You're one unsual <class>, <name>. I don't mean that in a negative way. I'm just sayin', you're kinda funny.
*How long was I hanging back there? It felt like days.
*Do you always talk so much when there's stuff to kill?
*Less yap flappin'. More ogre thwappin'. Deal?
*You smell somethin?
On aggroing ogres, more random commentary:
*{{text|say|Kristoff Manheim|This one smells particularly bad.}}
*{{text|say|Kristoff Manheim|Don't get stepped on.}}
*{{text|say|Kristoff Manheim|He doesn't see me, does he?}}
*{{text|say|Kristoff Manheim|That one's huge. You shouldn't have made him angry.}}

On success:
:{{text|say|Kristoff Manheim|We made it! I'll find my way back on my own. Do me a favor and go tell {{NPC||Royce Duskwhipser}} where he can stick his stupid [[Eye of Twilight]].}}
