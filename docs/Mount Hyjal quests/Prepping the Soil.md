== Objectives ==
Activate and defend a Flameward.
*[[Flameward]] Activated
*Flameward Defended

== Description ==
The Arch Druid has tasked me with setting up a series of flamewards around the perimeter of the area. Once these are active, we can prevent further attacks from the [[fire elemental]]s that left this valley in ruins.

These will also protect and nourish the soil for whatever {{NPC||Hamuul Runetotem||Hamuul}} has planned.

It's time to begin. Find one of the five flamewards I've marked on your map, activate it, and defend it from counterattack until its magic kicks in. It won't take more than a minute.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Helm of the Mendicant|Flameward Cloak|Kindleprotector Staff}}
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Are the wards up?

== Completion ==
That's good! Between your work and the work of a few others, that valley is secure from a counter-attack.

I've done all I can. It's all up to you and the Arch Druid now.

Pick a [[Flameward]] and clear the area before activating it. {{NPC||Ashbearer}}s will spawn in increasing speed for a minute and have initial aggro on the flameward. They are level 80 flamewakers with ~15,000 health each. The flameward has only ~11,000 health, but a damage reduction shield. It still can't take many hits.

If it dies, the the event fails, so peel them off before they do any damage to the flameward.
:{{text|bossemote|Defeat! The flameward has been destroyed.}}

Once the timer has passed, the ward will kill all charbringers in the area.
:{{text|bossemote|Victory! The flameward has been defended.}}
