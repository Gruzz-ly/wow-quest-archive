== Objectives ==
Speak with 8 Twilight Servitors to administer the draught and rescue them.
*{{NPC||Twilight Servitor}} Freed x8
*[[Cleansing Draught]] (provided)

== Description ==
<{{NPC||Rio Duran||Rio}} said that the draught would not remain effective for long.>

<You'd better hurry into the hovel and administer it to as many Twilight Servitors as you can find.>

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Purifying Spaulders|Invidious Casque|Crusher of Bonds}}
You will also receive: {{cost|15|60}}

== Progress ==
Did the draught work?

== Completion ==
Excellent! Let's hope the damage wasn't permanent.

Judging by the poor victims still in camp here, the [[Twilight's Hammer]] really messed with their heads.

== Notes ==
There are plenty of servitors inside the cave complex too. Don't focus on the few outside!

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
