==Objectives==
Place the Twilight Drake Skull at the feeding grounds south of the [[Ascendant's Circle]] and slay Desperiona.
*[[Desperiona]] slain
*[[Young Twilight Drake Skull (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
We've located the matriarch's feeding grounds south of the Ascendant<!--sic--> Circle.

She will be extremely angry to have lost one of her drakes. Place the skull there near the carcasses she devours. If she's anywhere in the vicinity, she will come out and attempt to exact revenge.

We will have a surprise waiting for her.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Maggotproof Gloves|Matriarch-Hide Wristguards|Greaves of Violent Revenge}}
You will also receive: {{cost|16|40}}

==Progress==
It's good to see you, <name>.

==Completion==
That went... better than expected.

==Notes==
Head southwest past the Ascendant's Circle. At {{coords|54.7|85.6|Mount Hyjal}} near the lava lake are a few carcasses. Use the skull to both drop it on the ground and summon in Aronus, Desperiona and Aviana!
:{{text|yell|Aronus|Show yourself, beast! We will destroy you and your corrupt spawn no matter where you hide!}}
:{{text|yell|Desperiona|What coward dares attack my young while I'm away? I will feed your entrails to my brood!}}
:''Aviana appears and casts some magic on Desperiona, keeping her from taking any actions for 60 seconds or so.''
:{{text|yell|Aronus|Slay her now, before Aviana's magic wears off!}}
:{{text|yell|Aviana|You will not defile the winds of Hyjal for much longer, monster!}}
While [[Aronus]] is tanking Desperiona, it is possible to melee her. Stand on the cliff above the lava immediately beneath Aronus. Desperiona has 14,038 health and Aviana's freeze lasts for a mere sixty seconds. Move quick! Aronus helps, as his melee swings hit decently hard, but that is not enough to kill her before she starts her counterattack.

This ends Aronus's quests. Pick up Cenarius' and Shadowsong's quests to keep the storyline progressing.
