== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Takrik Ragehowl}} at the reclaimed [[Shrine of Goldrinn]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
Yes <name>. I am {{NPC||Goldrinn}}. Your persistence in the face of fear has unbound me from twilight's grasp.

My shrine has been purified, and my worshippers have returned to their rightful place at my right paw.

Return to Takrik and continue your work here in Hyjal. I will have need of you again soon. 

== Rewards ==
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
<name>, it was incredible! For a fleeting moment I saw Lo'Gosh through the trees - a creature of both fury and light. My cage collapsed and the vandals melted like wax under the kiss of his claws, their screams and howls echoing through the valley... Was that your work?

== Notes ==
The shrine has advanced phases and Takrik and {{NPC||Ian Duran||Ian}} are now freed and taking up camp northwest of their previous position, alongside other members of the [[Guardians of Hyjal]], {{NPC||Rio Duran}}, {{NPC||Royce Duskwhisper}}, and some vendors: {{NPC||Berin Connad}} and {{NPC||Mirala Fawnsinger}}. An additional thing to note is that this quest must be accepted as soon as possible, as the Spirit of Goldrinn will eventually despawn if one takes too long to accept the quest, or if one moves out of visible range of the Spirit of Goldrinn.

Their former spot is now occupied by two [[Goldrinn Defender]]s.
