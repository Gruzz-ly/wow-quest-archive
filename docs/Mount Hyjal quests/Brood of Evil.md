== Objectives ==
Obtain a Young Twilight Drake's Skull at the [[Ascendant's Rise]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[Young Twilight Drake Skull]]

== Description ==
This egg you recovered is an alarming sign, <name>. The Twilight dragons are usually raised from stolen eggs from other dragonflights, which are then modified through dark magic.

This "natural" egg is evidence that one of their matriarchs has become a viable broodmother. We must destroy her before her brood spreads.

Go to the Ascendant's Rise where they claim these aberrations are kept and slay one of the juvenile drakes. We will use its skull to lure out its mother.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|31|50}}

== Progress ==
You've returned, <race>.

== Completion ==
You've done well, <name>. We will use this to draw out the Twilight matriarch.

== Notes ==
There are two drakes at {{coords|58.9|78.2|Mount Hyjal}} at the north end of the circle.

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}

==Patch changes==
