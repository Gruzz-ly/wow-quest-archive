==Objectives==
Kill any 6-9 invaders from the [[Firelands]] in the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]] or [[Sethria's Roost]].
*Invader from the Firelands slain (6-9)

==Description==
Of all of our tasks here in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]], the most pressing is simple: destroy these invaders. The very nature of fire is that it is all-consuming. Lower your defense for just a moment and it will destroy everything in sight.

Kill any of the fiery invaders you find. Every enemy defeated purchases more time for Hyjal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
There isn't time to waste, <race>.

==Completion==
Well-fought, <name>. Take a break from the flames for a while.

Hyjal will live to see another day, and when that day comes, I will need you alive.

==Notes==
*Any hostile counts, such as [[Brimstone Destroyer (elemental)|Brimstone Destroyers]] and [[Charred Flamewaker]]s.
*The objective for the quest often varies from 6 to 9.
