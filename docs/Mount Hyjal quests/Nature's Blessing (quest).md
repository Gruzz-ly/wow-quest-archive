==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Pyrachnis.jpg|Pyrachnis|Use the Emerald to remove its poison!}}
Use the Emerald of Aessina to summon and kill Pyrachnis.
*[[Pyrachnis]] slain
*[[Emerald of Aessina]] (provided)

==Description==
<Mylune's voice rings in your head, like the sound of birds chirping.>

I love all creatures of the forest, even spiders, despite the fact that they are icky. But the [[fire spider|spiders]] from the [[Firelands]] are worse than icky. They're burny, and don't belong here.

Find the fire portal in the western the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]], and use the [[Inconspicuous Emerald|gem]] I gave you earlier to force it open. When a [[Pyrachnis|fire spider]] emerges, step on it! Unless it's big. Then, do something <class>y to it.

Oh, and use the gem if spider venom makes you woozy!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 XP (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Want to frolic a little after this?

==Completion==
Oh NO you're covered in SPIDER-SPORCH!

<Mylune hides her eyes from the sight of you.>

You're such a brave <race>. I hope you'll go into the Firelands soon and step on ALL the spiders.

==Notes==
The portal can be found at {{co|13.2|44.9|Mount Hyjal}} at the east end of the area before reaching the [[Ashen Lake]]. Pyrachnis is a level 85 elite [[lava spider]] with 232,470 health. It has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|range=30|Boiling Poison Shot|Shoots poison at an enemy, inflicting Fire and Nature damage, then additional damage every 5 sec. for 10 sec.|notes=2 sec cast. Hits and ticks for ~2324 Firestorm. Stacks, doubling the damage taken. Triggers a boss emote:}}
*{{abilities|Poison Explosion|Sends out a blast wave of magic, inflicting Arcane damage to nearby enemies.|notes=1.5 sec cast. Hits for ~8500 Arcane. Also has a knockback.}}

When the fight first starts, the game gives a reminder:
:{{text|bossemote|Use the Emerald of Aessina to cleanse yourself of Pyrachnis' poison!}}

Take care not to use the Emerald once Pyrachnis is defeated, or instead of removing the poison effect, you will summon it a second time.

If players abstain from using the Emerald of Aessina, they complete the Pyrachnis step of [[Infernal Ambassadors]].
