== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Laina Nightsky}} near the [[Grove of Aessina]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
Do you see it, <name>? From the ridge southwest of here... plumes of black smoke curling into the sky.

Mount Hyjal is burning.

If the fires have raced this far up the mountain, surely they threaten the Grove of Aessina and all of our forces there. Can you investigate?

Speak with Laina Nightsky near the Grove of Aessina. Last I heard, she was fighting off the assault.

== Completion ==
Can this wait, <class>? The battle is not going well.

Oh, you're here to help. I hope you don't mind a little heat...

== Notes ==
This is one of the two quests offered after [[Return from the Firelands]]. The other is [[Aviana's Legacy]], which leads to the [[Shrine of Aviana]].

Folow the path southwest to the next shrine. South of the shrine proper just off the road at {{co|19.0|41.0|Mount Hyjal||1}} on the [[Rim of the World]] is {{NPC||Laina Nightsky}}. She offers the followup side quests, [[Fighting Fire With ... Anything]] and [[Disrupting the Rituals]]. Also, pick up the flight path and side quest [[Save the Wee Animals]] and the continuation [[If You're Not Against Us...]] from the grove proper.
