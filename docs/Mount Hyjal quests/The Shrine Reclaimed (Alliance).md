== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Ian Duran}} at the reclaimed [[Shrine of Goldrinn]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
Yes <name>. I am {{NPC||Goldrinn}}. Your persistence in the face of fear has unbound me from twilight's grasp.

My shrine has been purified, and my worshipers have returned to their rightful place at my right paw.

Return to Ian and continue your work here in Hyjal. I will have need of you again soon.

== Rewards ==
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
<Name>, it was astounding! Goldrinn himself appeared to free us, his white fur bright like the summer moon. Our cages collapsed and the vandals melted like wax under the kiss of his claws. He was beautiful, <name>. Beautiful!

== Notes ==
The shrine has advanced phases and Ian and {{NPC||Takrik Ragehowl||Takrik}} are now freed and taking up camp northwest of their previous position, alongside other members of the [[Guardians of Hyjal]], {{NPC||Rio Duran}}, {{NPC||Royce Duskwhisper}}, and some vendors: {{NPC||Berin Connad}} and {{NPC||Mirala Fawnsinger}}.

Their former spot is now occupied by two [[Goldrinn Defender]]s.
