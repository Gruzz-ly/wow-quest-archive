I can sense her cries o' pain risin' from the north... in a place o' ancient power...

<Magni closes his eyes, as if listening to an unseen voice.>

By the Forge! Somethin's gone wrong in Mount Hyjal. The [[World Tree]], Nordrassil, is in danger!

Meet me there, <name>. There's no time tae lose!

If we don't heal these wounds, the World Tree might not be standin' much longer.

I can feel her pain most tae the north, in Mount Hyjal. It must be the [[World Tree]], Nordassil!
