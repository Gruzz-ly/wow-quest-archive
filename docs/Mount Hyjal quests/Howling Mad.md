== Objectives ==
Acquire 6 Polluted Incense.
*[[Polluted Incense]] x6

== Description ==
The shrine has been taken, <name>. We need the tenacity of [[Lo'Gosh]] now more than ever.

These {{NPC||Lycanthoth Vandal||defilers}} - the lice-ridden wolf-men running rampant over the shrine - dishonor his memory of the wolf god. They arrived with the [[Twilight's Hammer]], howling with their own twisted religion. They seek to corrupt noble Lo'Gosh to fit their own warped pantheon.

Kill them! Kill them and bring me the tools of their worship, a kind of polluted incense. I must understand what they want with the shrine... 

== Rewards ==
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
These animals were once men, but they've turned into mindless beasts under the influence of the Twilight's hammer. Do not hesitate to slay them all.

== Completion ==
<Takrik examines the incense.>

Disgusting. This is like the incense we burn when we wish to commune with the spirits... but it's... befouled.

== Notes ==
Head north 30 yards and start killing.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}
