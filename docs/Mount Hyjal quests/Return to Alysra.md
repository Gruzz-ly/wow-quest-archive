== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Alysra}} at the [[Ruins of Lar'donir]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
I thank you for freeing me, <name>. I will tell our allies of my findings.

I suggest that you return to the [[green dragon|emerald dragon]] that sent you.

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] does not just seek to gain territory with this particular attack. They're also after a prisoner.

{{NPC||Fandral Staghelm}} is being held in the [[Hyjal Barrow Dens|Barrow Dens]]. The attack doubles as a distraction to free him. To what end, I cannot tell. Perhaps our dragon ally can shed some light on this.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Completion ==
This development is troubling, <name>. We must act swiftly.

== Notes ==
Follow the road back to the east.

==Progression==
{{Nordrassil}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
