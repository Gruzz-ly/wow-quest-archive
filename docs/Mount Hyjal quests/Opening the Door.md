'''Opening the Door''' starts the [[Firelands Invasion]] quest chain proper, added in [[patch 4.2.0]]. Players must have completed the [[Mount Hyjal quests|Mount Hyjal storyline]] up to and including [[Aessina's Miracle]] in order for this quest to open up at the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] in the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]] of [[Mount Hyjal]].

==Objectives==
Report to [[Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem]] at [[Nordune Ridge]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

==Description==
You're a bit late. Hamuul, [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]], and some of our esteemed guests have already traveled to the invasion point, atop that [[Nordune Ridge|cliff]].

Our gate to the [[Firelands]] is not yet completed, but it will be shortly. The sooner we can break through, the better.

Go on! Hamuul will be expecting you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6940 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|65|50}} at max level)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Completion==
<Name>. It is good to see you again. Our gate is nearly opened.

==Notes==
[[Nordune Ridge]] is the former location of [[Nordu]], located due north of the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]]. A new flamegate is in the process, charged by [[Hyjal Ritualist]]s. [[Charred Invader]]s are streaming out of the flamegate, being quickly met by [[Hyjal Assault Trooper]]s in bear, cat, moonkin, and flight forms. Behind the front line are [[Hamuul Runetotem]], [[Malfurion Stormrage]], [[Saynna Stormrunner]], and [[Skylord Omnuron]]. Speak to Runetotem to continue.
