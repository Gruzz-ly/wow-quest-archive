==Objectives==
Help Elderlimb, Thisalee Crow, Tholo Whitehoof and Anren Shadowseeker escape the flames.
*Kill elementals near [[Elderlimb]] (6)
*Kill elementals near [[Thisalee Crow|Thisalee]] (6)
*Kill elementals near [[Tholo Whitehoof|Tholo]] and [[Anren Shadowseeker|Anren]] (6)

==Description==
Our invasion plan looks to have backfired. Several of our birds have already reported in, speaking of fires breaking out across the vales of central [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

Now, many of our druids are stranded out in the field, unprepared for such a large-scale attack. Thisalee was near [[Ashen Lake]], and several others were out in the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]], to the northeast.

Go, <name>! Find them, and make sure that they do not succumb to this backdraft!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x6
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
There isn't time! Move!

==Completion==
<Name>! You're back!

They've pushed us back to the Sanctuary. We are vastly outnumbered. At this rate, the [[Guardians of Hyjal]] stand little chance of survival.

I'm glad you're here with us.

Thisalee is just north, at Tortolla's original position at the [[Ashen Lake]].
:{{text|bossemote|Protect Thisalee from the fire elementals!}}
:{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|Hey <name>, you're here!  These guys came out of nowhere!  Help me out while I catch my breath.}}
[[Raging Invader]]s are [[unbound fire elemental]]s. Kill six. These event mobs are not tagged; so long as players are on the threat list they will get credit when the mobs die.
:{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|I can handle things from here. I'll meet you back at the Sanctuary, <name>.}}

Head southeast along the road to find Elderlimb:
:{{text|bossemote|Protect Elderlimb from the fire elementals!}}
:{{text|say|Elderlimb|Your arrival is timely, <race>.  I tire of fighting these wretched things.}}
Kill six more.
:{{text|say|Elderlimb|I can hold them off from here, <race>. We will meet again at the Sanctuary of Malorne.}}

Keep heading northeast, past the Regrowth's flamegate to find Tholo and Anren. Out of combat, the two are circle-strafing, backs together, to keep a look out.
:{{text|bossemote|Protect Tholo and Anren from the fire elementals!}}
:{{text|say|Tholo|Look, Anren! <Name> has come to help us!}}
Again with the killing. When they get out of combat, they will again resume circling each other and each say a line:
*{{text|say|Anren|You are a good friend, Tholo!}}
*{{text|say|Anren|I am with you, Tholo!}}
*{{text|say|Anren|We must stay together, Tholo!}}
*{{text|say|Anren|Stay on my back, Tholo!}}
*{{text|say|Anren|I have your back, Tholo!}}
*{{text|say|Tholo|Together we can do anything, Anren!}}
*{{text|say|Tholo|I will stay with you, Anren!}}
*{{text|say|Tholo|I will protect you, Anren!}}
*{{text|say|Tholo|You are a good friend, Anren!}}
*{{text|say|Tholo|I am here, Anren!}}
After killing six:
:{{text|say|Tholo|Thank you, <name>. As long as we stay together, Anren and I will be fine. Go check on the others!}}

Return to the Sanctuary, which is under siege! Hamuul is in bear form. Speak with him.

==Progression==
{{Firelands invasion part one}}
