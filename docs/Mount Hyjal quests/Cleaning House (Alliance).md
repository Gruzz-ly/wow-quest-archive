== Objectives ==
Kill any combination of 8 {{NPC||Hovel Brute}}s or {{NPC||Hovel Shadowcaster}}s within [[Gar'gol's Hovel]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*Minion of Gar'gol slain x8

== Description ==
Thanks to your efforts, we may soon be able to return this shrine to its former glory. But first we've got to secure this valley. South of here, a group of ogres led by {{NPC||Gar'gol}} has set up camp in a stinking hovel.

I wouldn't characterize Gar'gol as a 'threat' so much as an enormous fleshy obstacle thrown in our path to distract us from the real danger. Nonetheless, he and his goons will have to be dealt with.

Kill Gar'gol's minions in {{NPC||Goldrinn}}'s name!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Gar'gol isn't exactly the brightest torch on the mountain, if you know what I mean.

== Completion ==
You really cleared that place out, didn't you? Well done!

The [[night elf|night elves]] told me a story about how Goldrinn fought and killed a [[dreadlord]], even as three others clung to his flanks, burning his flesh. I wonder if you or I will ever have the strength to do the same?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[From the Mouth of Madness]] and [[The Eye of Twilight]] before heading out. Don't focus on killing ogres. There will be plenty of incidental ogre killing in the other quests.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
