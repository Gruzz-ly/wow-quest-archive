== Objectives ==
Recover the Branch of Nordrassil from the [[Firelands (instance)|Firelands]].
* [[Branch of Nordrassil (quest item)]]

== Description ==
I am duty-bound to look into your claims immediately, <race>, which means my mission here now must fall to you.

A surge of ancient magic, far too strong to have occurred naturally, drew me here. I have since discovered a most troubling development.

A bough from [[Nordrassil]] has been ripped from the tree and taken deep into the [[Firelands]]. There, a powerful ritual threatens to corrupt Nordrassil, consuming it in flame.

You must find a way to interrupt the ritual and reclaim the world tree's branch.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|53||50}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to recover Nordrassil's bough, <class>?

== Completion ==
Nordrassil's Bough...

You have done well, mortal.

== Notes ==
You must defeat [[Volcanus]] the Firelord in Firelands to complete this quest. The player needs to obtain quest items from the first four bosses in order to reach Volcanus.
*Loot {{item|Obsidian-Flecked Chitin Fragment|s}} from [[Cinderweb Drone]]s, combine them into a [[Dull Chitinous Focus]], and allow it to be hit by [[Beth'tilac]]'s Smoldering Devastation to receive [[Charged Emberstone Focus]].
*Loot {{item|Rhyolite Fragment|s}} from the [[Ridge of Ancient Flame]], combine them into a [[Dull Rhyolite Focus]], and allow it to be hit by [[Lord Rhyolith]]'s Concussive Stomp to receive [[Charged Rhyolite Focus]].
*Loot {{item|Pyreshell Fragment|s}} from the [[Voracious Hatchling]]s' eggs, combine them into a [[Dull Pyreshell Focus]], and allow it to be hit by [[Alysrazor]]'s Full Power to receive [[Charged Pyreshell Focus]].
*Loot {{item|Emberstone Fragment|s}} from Crystal Prisons, combine them into a [[Dull Emberstone Focus]], and allow it to be hit by [[Shannox]]'s Hurl Spear to receive [[Charged Emberstone Focus]].
**Must have at least two other players in the group for Shannox to use his Immolation Trap ability.

Take these four items to the Circle of Thorns at the end of the [[Path of Corruption]] and use them to open the portal to the [[Anvil of Conflagration]].
