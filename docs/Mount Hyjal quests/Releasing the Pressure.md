==Objectives==
Obtain 100 Flamewaker Scales.
*[[Flamewaker Scale]] x100

==Description==
Having been burned so badly, [[Hamuul Runetotem|Arch Druid Hamuul]] is suffering from [[wikipedia:Edema|edema]] - swelling of the body's tissues. It takes a great deal of his attendants' effort to keep his swelling down enough for him to breathe.

Normally, to reduce this swelling, we make cuts in his flesh, but he is weak, <name>. I cannot cut him today. I need your help.

Flamewaker scales will aid with the swelling, but you need a lot of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*69400 XP (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1 and {{cost|9|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Do you have the scales? I hesitate to cut the Arch Druid again, but we must relieve the swelling somehow.

==Completion==
You are a compassionate <race>. With this many scales we won't have to cut him again for another day, at least. Perhaps two.

==Notes==
Not up in [[Sethria's Roost]] for once. Down in the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]] are [[Charred Flamewaker]]s. Go nuts. The flamewakers drop between 7 and 24 scales each time, so this won't take too long.
