Kill 4 Twilight Flamecallers and 10 Twilight Vanquishers.

== Description ==
Make no mistake about this, <name>. The outcome of this war will determine the very survival of our world as we know it.

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] has become more powerful than ever with {{NPC||Deathwing||Deathwing's}} return. Should they succeed in taking over the [[Nordrassil|world tree]], they might strike a blow from which we will never recover.

It is time we beat back the enemy. It is time we crushed the Twilight's Hammer.
