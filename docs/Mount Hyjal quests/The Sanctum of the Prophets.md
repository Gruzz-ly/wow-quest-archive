== Objectives ==
Slay 4 Twilight Augurs, 4 Twilight Retainers and 1 Emissary of Flame at the [[Sanctum of the Prophets]].
*[[Twilight Augur]] slain x4
*[[Twilight Retainer]] slain x4
*[[Emissary of Flame]] slain

== Description ==
The mad prophets of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] congregate in the area just north of the [[Ascendant's Circle]].

It is said that their dark visions are granted to them directly by the [[Old Gods]]. Whether or not that is true, they provide tremendous spiritual guidance to the cult. Attacking the Sanctum of the Prophets will deal a devastating blow to the enemy's morale and if we're lucky you might run into one of the {{NPC||Ragnaros||Firelord's}} own emissaries while you're there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Keep it up, <name>

== Completion ==
You continue to prove your prowess, <name>. At this rate Hyjal might survive this ordeal after all.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Gatekeeper]] before heading out. Fly west back toward [[Sulfuron Spire]], but take a right heading north at the fork to get to the sanctum. The twilights are all humanoids... the emissaries are [[flamewaker]]s. As is Azralon, who is in the center of camp.

==Progression==
