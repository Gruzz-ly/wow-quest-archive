== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Aviana}} at the [[Shrine of Aviana]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

== Description ==
<Name>, you've done all you can here. This [[Firelands Hatchery|whole cavern]] is about to collapse in on itself!

I'll gather up the last of our {{NPC||Aviana's Guardian||feathered steeds}} and ensure that the flamegate is sealed behind me.

You should go on ahead and let Aviana know that this abominable hatchery is no more!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be to choose one of these rewards:|Blinkered Hood|Sky-Knight Handguards|Silver Spur Boots}}
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

== Completion ==
<Aviana's face is immobile as you tell her about what happened within the hatchery.>

They stole my eggs, <class>. They took them to that foul place. Corrupted them.

My children stolen, tormented, killed in a vat of flame... Yes, we will make [[Twilight's Hammer]] pay.

But I confess, part of me wants to fly up and simply watch this whole... world... burn.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|Don't forget to replace your main weapon!}}

Head back to the surface and resume the [[The Last Living Lorekeeper]] chain.
