== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Lycanthoth.jpg|Lycanthoth the Corruptor|Use the incense within the Maw of Lycanthoth to summon the beast.}}
Use Lycanthoth's Incense within the [[Maw of Lycanthoth]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]] to summon and kill Lycanthoth.
*[[Lycanthoth]] slain
*[[Lycanthoth's Incense]] (provided)

== Description ==
The actions of these feral dogs are beginning to make sense. The [[Twilight's Hammer]] fears the power of the ancients. They do not want [[Lo'Gosh]] to return.

So they've summoned their own wolf god - a perversion of what once was. "Lycanthoth," the corruptor.

<name>, Lycanthoth is but a shadow of Lo'Gosh's power, but the beast must be destroyed so that the true ancient can return. Take this incense, and burn it in the maw of Lycanthoth east of here. Slay the monstrosity and free the spirit of Lo'Gosh!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Handguards of Restrained Brutality|Wrap of Furious Pride|Choker of Lo'Gosh}}

== Progress ==
Your bravery is an inspiration to others, <class>. Tell me your name.

== Completion ==
You were brave to face down Lycanthoth, <name>. Like myself, he was a primal force of nature... but his origins were from a darker place.

Those who birthed that beast reached deep into the blackness, channeling powers never intended for this world.

Come, <class>. Climb onto my back, and let us show these beasts the true face of ferocity!

== notes ==
Head east along the northern portion of the valley and enter the cave. Enter the cave at at {{co|32.4|37.3|Mount Hyjal||1}} to find [[Lycanthoth's Altar]]. Using the incense will summon Lycanthoth. His first move is to cast the Miasama of Terror&mdash;A veil of terror surrounds the gruesome visage of Lycanthoth.

:{{text|say|Lycanthoth|Fate subjugates faith, mortal. Your prayers are meaningless here.}}

On complete... the camera moves to see through Goldrinn's eyes as he frees the captives, kills the vandals, then moves to his statue up on the rise.

==Progression==
