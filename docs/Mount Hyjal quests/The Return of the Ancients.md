== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Oomla Whitehorn}} at [[Wolf's Run]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
It'll be crucial to reclaim each of the Ancients' shrines, <name>.

Follow the road west of the [[Verdant Thicket]], into Wolf's Run.

We have operatives stationed there. Aid them in any way that you can and work your way to the first shrine.

The wolf god was known to the [[night elf|elves]] as {{NPC||Goldrinn}} and to the [[orc]]s as {{NPC||Lo'Gosh}}. He will be a fierce ally in our fight against the enemy.

== Rewards ==
You will also receive: {{cost|3|90}}

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Ysera}} sent you? Good! We need all the help we can get.

We'll never be able to recover the shrines to the ancients so long as [[Twilight's Hammer]] controls the roads. Somehow we've got to stem the flood.

==Notes==
Fly to the northwest from the world tree, past the Verdant Thicket and the [[Twilight Command Post]] to reach Wolf's Run. Off the road to the north is a small holdfast.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
