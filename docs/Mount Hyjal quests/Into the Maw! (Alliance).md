== Objectives ==
Step through the flamegate atop the [[Lightning Ledge]] in [[Mount Hyjal]], and speak with {{NPC||Jordan Olafson}} within.

== Description ==
;Goldrinn
:Atop the Lightning Ledge, the [[Twilight's Hammer]] has erected an enormous flamegate. I do not know where it leads; I know it is not of this realm, and I cannot enter. None of my other followers have returned.

:I need you to enter this realm and be my fangs within. If he is still alive, meet with Jordan Olafson inside. He will give you a token that will allow you to use my powers within [[Firelands|that realm]].

:Be bold, <name>. Find out where that flamegate leads, and destroy whatever lies within.
;Ian Duran
:<Name>, there you are! {{NPC||Goldrinn}} has a mission that only his champion can accomplish. Atop the Lightning Ledge, Twilight's Hammer has erected a flamegate. We don't know where it leads, but Goldrinn can't enter. The ancient needs you to be his fangs.

:Step into the flamegate and talk to Jordon Olafson when you get inside. He'll give you a token to allow you to use Goldrinn's power in that realm. Find out where the flamegate leads!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Fang of Goldrinn}} 

== Completion ==

Ah, you are the champion Goldrinn promised! Your eyes don't deceive you: you have entered the [[Firelands]], an [[elemental plane]] of molten stone and fire. We've got our work cut out for us.

Put aside your differences with the Horde, there's plenty of danger to go around.

And take this: the Fang of Goldrinn will allow you to channel the ancient's power here within the Firelands. Use it well!

== Notes ==
If players should somehow drop/lose this quest, Ian offers it back at the shrine, just in case. The flamegate is at the southwest corner of the [[Lightning Ledge]] at {{co|26.1|41.2|Mount Hyjal||1}}. Players drop down to the [[Firelands Forgeworks]] in the [[Firelands]]! {{NPC||Jordan Olafson}} and {{NPC||Yargra Blackscar}} await.
