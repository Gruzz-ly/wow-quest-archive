== Objectives ==
Defeat 8 Fiery Instructors.
*[[Fiery Instructor]] slain x8

== Description ==
I'd love to say that with the tides turning against us in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]], every recruit helps our cause and so on... but to be perfectly blunt, most of you are nothing but a burden.

If I had a copper for every peasant who got too scared when the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]] hit and now wishes to join our side... well, let's just say I'd be a rich woman.

Fortunately we have checks in place to separate the wheat from the chaff. Go and prove yourself to the fiery instructors below. Hopefully you'll do better than the others.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Impressive Greaves|Chestplate of Exceptional Expectations}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
You've returned.

== Completion ==
I suppose your abilities are... suitable. Color me impressed.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[In Bloom]] and [[Waste of Flesh]] before heading out. Plenty of fire elementals are all over the area.

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}

==Patch changes==
