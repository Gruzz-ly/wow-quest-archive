== Objectives ==
Slay 10 Twilight Scorchlords.
*[[Twilight Scorchlord]] slain x10

== Description ==
The fiery army that caused so much devastation [[Flamewake|up the hill]] has retreated [[Scorched Plain|east of here]]. Only the Scorchlords remain in action. If we can punch a hole through their lines to regroup with {{NPC||Captain Irontree}}'s forces, the whole offensive may collapse.

<Class>, I'm in no shape to continue fighting, but you look like you can do some damage. Slay those Scorchlords and regroup with Captain Irontree!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
You fought your way in here? Looks like you can stand toe-to-toe with the best of my wardens, <class>!

== Completion ==
You killed how many? Well, well. Quite a show. I guess my men don't have any more excuses.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Lost Wardens]] before heading out. Head east along the road, killing and saving along the way. Keep heading east to find a ruined inn filled to the rafters with Irontree Wardens guarding it. Irontree is at {{coords|57.1|55.9|Mount Hyjal}} inside on the bottom floor. Above him is {{NPC||Logram}}, offering a fetch quest, [[Hyjal Recycling Program]]. Pick it up before killing all of the scorchlords.

==Progression==
{{Scorched Plain}}
