== Objectives ==
Slay 10 Molten Tormentors and 4 Shadowflame Masters.

*[[Shadowflame Master]] slain x4

== Description ==
[[Crucible of Flame|This cavern]] is an abomination, <name>. And it's filled with horrors from the depths.

I don't want any of these - things - getting through the portal to the outside world. Slay everything!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
This cavern fills my lungs with heat and my eyes with ash. Are you faring any better?

== Completion ==
So it is done.

Knowing that [[Twilight's Hammer]] is in league with creatures of malice such as these... it really curdles the blood.

==Progression==
{{Scorched Plain}}
