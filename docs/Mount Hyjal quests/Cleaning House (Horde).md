== Objectives ==
Kill any combination of 8 {{NPC||Hovel Brute}}s or {{NPC||Hovel Shadowcaster}}s within [[Gar'gol's Hovel]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*Minion of Gar'gol slain x8

== Description ==
We are well on our way to returning the shrine to its former glory, <name>. But there is some housecleaning to take care of. On the other side of this meadow, some ogre squatters are setting up camp, led by a thick-headed chunk of ugly by the name of [[Gar'gol]].

Kill Gar'gol's minions and see if we can't send him packing.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
How goes the ogre hunting?

== Completion ==
Hah! So you really sent some heads rolling, did you?

It was said during the [[War of the Ancients]] that [[Lo'Gosh]] fought demons for ten days solid. Hopefully you weren't fighting that long...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[From the Mouth of Madness]] and [[The Eye of Twilight]] before heading out. Don't focus on killing ogres. There will be plenty of incidental ogre killing in the other quests.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
