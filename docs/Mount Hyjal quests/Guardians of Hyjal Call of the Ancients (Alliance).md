'''Guardians of Hyjal: Call of the Ancients''' is an optional breadcrumb quest covering the [[Mount Hyjal quests|Hyjal storyline]], only available to players who have not quested through [[Mount Hyjal]]. Players must complete the quest chains for each ancient, linked in the objectives section, up to and including [[Aessina's Miracle]] in order to complete this quest. The full quest chain is displayed at [[Mount Hyjal quests]].

Players who have already completed Mount Hyjal's storyline may skip directly to [[Opening the Door]] at the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] to begin the new quests. However, an optional breadcrumb to the sanctuary can be found in the form of [[Guardians of Hyjal: Firelands Invasion! (Alliance)]], offered at any [[Hero's Call Board]].

==Objectives==
Assist [[Goldrinn]], [[Tortolla]], [[Aviana]], and [[Aessina]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].
*[[Return from the Firelands|Goldrinn assisted]]
*[[The Ancients are With Us|Tortolla assisted]]
*[[An Ancient Reborn|Aviana assisted]]
*[[Aessina's Miracle|Aessina assisted]]

==Description==
The [[Guardians of Hyjal]], led by [[Malfurion Stormrage|Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage]], seek brave heroes to assist in defending Mount Hyjal from elemental invaders. These invaders must be repelled before forces can mobilize for a direct assault on the Firelands.

Willing and able-bodied heroes should report immediately to Mount Hyjal and assist the Ancient defenders: Goldrinn, Tortolla, Aviana, and Aessina.

New travelers to Mount Hyjal may look for a [[Hero's Call: Mount Hyjal!|Hero's Call to Hyjal]] on any [[Hero's Call Board|Alliance board]].
