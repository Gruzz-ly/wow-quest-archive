== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Gar'gol.jpg|Gar'gol|Look for a lockbox somewhere near Gar'gol's enormous, crud-crusted feet.}}
Get the Rusted Skull Key from [[Gar'gol's Personal Treasure Chest]].
*[[Rusted Skull Key]]

== Description ==
<Kristoff cranes his neck, trying to look you in the eye.>

Listen, you gotta get me outta here. They're either going to eat me or turn me over to the [[Twilight's Hammer]]. Maybe both.

They've padlocked me in, and Gar'gol keeps the key in his personal treasure chest. Kill Gar'gol if you have to - but get that key!

<Kristoff flails his limbs, helplessly.>

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Key? Now? Please?

== Completion ==
<Kristoff reaches down to snatch the key.>

It's about time!

<He squirms in his bonds, trying to reach the padlock behind his back.>

...Can I get a little help here?

== Notes ==
While on [[Mastering Puppets]] and [[Free Your Mind, the Rest Follows]], players enter [[Gar'gol's Hovel]]. At the southern end of the hovel is {{NPC||Kristoff Manheim}}, hanging from a meat hook, rather unhappy with his current lot in life:

:Hello, <class>. I imagine you have a lot of questions.
:Suffice it to say that {{NPC||Royce Duskwhisper}} sent me into the middle of an ogre cave for some "[[Eye of Twilight]]" jib-job, and it hasn't gone well.
:If I ever get my hands on that lanky, heartless, mealy-mouthed little [[night elf]]...
:<Kristoff wriggles helplessly as he dangles in the air, his face redenning.>
{{gossip|''So how is your research into the Eye coming along?''}}
:<Name>, <name>. Can I call you <name>?
:I am hanging from a meathook in the back of an ogre cave.
:How do you THINK my research is progressing, you pompous dirt-sucking ass-<class>? C'mere! C'mere you son of a swineherd!
:<Kristoff flutters back and forth on his chain, trying desperately to kick you in the face.>
* <Kristoff grunts.>


Gar'gol is in the center of the cave, more or less, at {{co|26.5|38.5|Mount Hyjal||1}}, as is his chest. Gargol has a few words of "wisdom"
*Dinnertime for Gar'gol! Go get chef. Cook chef if dinner not ready.
*The Eye talks in shadow-talk. I do what Eye says! You do what Gar'gol says!
*Who talk to Eye last? Is Eye happy? Tell Gar'gol!
*The Eye have no lips, but the Eye whispers to Gar'gol. The Eye knows everything!
*If you don't like what we do here, you talk to the Eye. But it will not listen. It's not the Ear.
*Where is two-head? What do Eye tell us now?
*Cave is too filthy! Put filth in filth piles marked with flag.
