First order of business is to thin the herd here. This place crawls.

Let's start slaughtering these [[dragonkin]] and worry about why they're here later.

Have you delivered a message?

Be sure to take flight, too, and hunt Sethria's minions on the other ledges.

You're good at this.

I like you.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Gap in Their Armor]] before heading out. Head south and start killing. Keep an eye out for the Codex of Shadows at {{coords|31.3|77.1|Mount Hyjal}} too. It starts [[The Codex of Shadows]].
