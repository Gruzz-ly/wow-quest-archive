== Objectives ==
Use the Heap of Core Hound Innards near {{NPC||Nemesis}} to distract him. Collect a Nemesis Shell Fragment.
*[[Nemesis Shell Fragment]]
* [[Heap of Core Hound Innards]] (provided)

== Description ==
Fresh and stinking, these innards will prove to be irresistible for Nemesis, the befouled turtle god created by [[Twilight's Hammer]].

Nemesis must eventually be destroyed, but first, we must collect a piece of his fiery armored shell. With it, we'll be able to work some magic to free the true ancient.

Go into the [[Flamewake]] and drop this bait near Nemesis. It will distract him. Pry off a piece of his shell... then run, if you hope to survive the encounter.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Nemesis is a molten ball of fury protected by a stony shell of pure hatred.

His time will come.

== Completion ==
<The Arch Druid takes the shell from you with surprising reverence.>

Nemesis is an instrument of evil, but he was forged from a shell fragment of the true Ancient.

We will exploit this connection.

== Notes ==
Head into the flamewake and look for Nemesis. He's hard to miss. Clear the area of lava surgers, then get close and drop the bait close to him. Once he turns friendly, interact with him to loot the shell. It will take a few seconds. Then, run away before he turns hostile!
