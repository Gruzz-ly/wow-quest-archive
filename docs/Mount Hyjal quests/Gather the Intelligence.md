== Objectives ==
Obtain the Twilight Communique and the Twilight Battleplans.
*[[Twilight Communique]]
*[[Hyjal Battleplans]]

== Description ==
It's me, <name>, {{NPC||Elementalist Ortell||Ortell}}!

Don't look directly at the outhouse... you'll give away my position.

Everything's going to plan then? Excellent!

I'm going to need you to obtain some intelligence while you're here. It might not seem like much to get our hands on a map or a letter, but it may mean saving a hundred lives on our side if we can anticipate our enemy's next move.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Did you get the documents, <name>?

== Completion ==
Excellent job, <name>. Or should I say: "<name>"damus?

Give me a minute to read these.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|Avoid the Twilight Guards while gathering the intelligence!}}

The battleplans are up at [[Doom's Vigil]] and not the Forge of Supplication.
