== Objectives ==
Slay 10 Horrorguards at the [[Gates of Sothann]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[Horrorguard]] slain x10

== Description ==
The [[demon]]s of the [[Burning Legion]] think they can just walk up here and take whatever territory they want. Sure—the territory was previously theirs, but that's besides the point.

We'll teach them to not cross with the [[Twilight's Hammer]].

Head to the Gates of Sothann and wipe out the contingent of Horrorguards that roam the area.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Is it done yet, <race>?

== Completion ==
Sharp as always. You do not disappoint me.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Greater of Two Evils]] before heading out. Head west past the proving grounds, then turn south and head up the hill to reach the [[Gates of Sothann]]. Garnoth can be found at the western end of the gates, so keep that in mind when killing Horrorguards.

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}
