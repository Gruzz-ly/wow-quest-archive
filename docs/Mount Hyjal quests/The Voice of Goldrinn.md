== Objectives ==
Locate {{NPC||Ian Duran}} near the [[Shrine of Goldrinn]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
Southwest [[Wolf's Run|of here]] lies the shrine of {{NPC||Goldrinn}}, a memorial erected in honor of the ancient wolf spirit and his contribution during the [[War of the Ancients]].

Our new [[worgen]] allies have been drawn to the memory of the wolf god - go figure!- and were in the process of cleaning up the shrine.

I haven't heard anything from my contact, Ian Duran, in days. Can you fly down there and find him? I've got a bad feeling that Goldrinn's shrine is in trouble...

== Completion ==
You're here to rescue me, <class>? Thank you!

No, no, don't worry about the cage for now. My life isn't important. We've got to save the shrine, first.

== Notes ==
Follow the road to the southwest and take the first fork to the right leading down into the valley. Ian Duran and {{NPC||Takrik Ragehowl}} are in cages just south of the shrine proper at {{co|30.1|31.3|Mount Hyjal||1}} west of the lake. The shrine is alight thanks to the work of {{NPC||Lycanthoth Vandal}}s.
