== Objectives ==
Slay 4 Twilight Proveditors at [[Wolf's Run]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[Twilight Proveditor]] slain x4

== Description ==
{{NPC||Cho'gall}}'s Twilight Proveditors swear a blood oath that they will get their supplies through to the front, pledging a pound of their own considerable flesh for every pound of supplies they fail to deliver. They would rather die than fail.

See to it that they do both.

== Rewards ==
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Every supply caravan we stop in its tracks will lead to more victories on the front.

== Completion ==
Well done! The chaos we sow back here will be felt up and down the chain of command.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Harrying the Hunters]] and [[In the Rear With the Gear]] before heading out. Kill the proveditor and the slavemaster to free three slaves, each with three bags of supplies.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}
