== Objectives ==
Gather 15 Warden's Arrows.
*[[Warden's Arrow]] x15

== Description ==
Reinforcements! I thought we were going to fight this out to the bitter end.

Very few of the [[Guardians of Hyjal]] remain, and our supplies are running out. The battlefield around our holdout here must be littered with serviceable arrows.

I know it's beneath your abilities, but can you gather up our spent ammuntion? It's the only way we can replenish our supplies!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Bloodbolt Crossbow|Razorproof Greaves|Mindfletcher Talisman}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Warden's arrows are crafted of living oak, blessed in the [[moonwell]]s, and tipped with [[obsidian]] arrowheads scrawled with runes invoking the blessings of nature.

They're not cheap.

== Completion ==
Wonderful! Still sharp. A little blood on the fletching, but they'll fly true.

Thank you, <name>. Our defense of Hyjal can continue.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Pressing the Advantage]] before heading out, if possible. No followup, so head to the third flamegate.
