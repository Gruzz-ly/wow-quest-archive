==Objectives==
Collect a Charged Condenser Jar from a Twilight [[Lightning Channel]].
*[[Charged Condenser Jar]]
*[[Totem of Lo'Gosh]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Lo'Gosh]] granted me a vision while you were in the hovel, <name>. I saw you striding across the [[Lightning Ledge]], with lightning bolts in your hand. The vision was powerful: Lo'Gosh feels this is of utmost importance. We must not fail the [[Ancient]].

Upon the Lightning Ledge, [[Twilight's Hammer]] has been experimenting with devices they call "Lightning Channels."

Investigate one of these channels, then use this totem to summon the Spirit of Lo'Gosh and learn what the Ancient is planning...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|50|}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
We meet again, <class>. You fight well! You carve a path of fear and confusion in your wake.

<Lo'Gosh peers at you, expectantly.>

==Completion==
So, it is true! You indeed carry lightning in your hands.

You are the chosen one, <name>. You will be my champion, and carry my vengeance to realms where I cannot tread...

==Notes==
Head up to the ledge. While killing the natives, look for a lightning rod. Collect a condenser jar then use the totem to summon Lo'Gosh.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}
