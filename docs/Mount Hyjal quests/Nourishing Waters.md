'''Nourishing Waters''' is a breadcrumb quest leading you back to the now completed Moonwell at [[Malfurion's Breach]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ayla Shadowstorm]] at Malfurion's Breach.

==Description==
I have dispatched the sacred moonwell waters to Malfurion's Breach, as you requested.  Ayla is well trained in tending to them.  you should return to her and see the boons she weaves for you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|13|50}}
*17,350 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Completion==
You will be pleased to know that the waters arrived safely.  With the moonwell filled, and the shade of the Sentinel Tree upon us, I can almost forget we're in the firelands for moments at a time.

I've spread the moonwell's blessing upon these trees and bushes.  Take the fruit with you before you venture out.  It is more refreshing than you can possibly imagine.

==Notes==
The fruit offered ([[Eternal Lunar Pear]], [[Eternal Eye of Elune]], [[Eternal Moonberry]], [[Eternal Sunfruit]]) offer main stats (stamina, and one of the other four main stats) as good as the best crafted food available.  Better, though, the healing they provide takes place in 5 seconds, rather than 30.  And best, they are reuseable.  The only down side is that they will be removed from your inventory if you leave the Molten Front.

==Patch changes==
