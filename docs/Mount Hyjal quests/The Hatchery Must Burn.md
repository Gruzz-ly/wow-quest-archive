==Objectives==
Travel through the flamegate in the center of the [[Flamewake]] in [[Mount Hyjal]]. Speak with {{NPC||Farden Talonshrike}} once you are inside.

==Description==
<Name>! [[Choluna]] spoke true: the goddess has returned! A miracle in our midst.

While you were able to kill the [[twilight dragon]] [[Sethria]], we have not yet located all of the eggs that the harpies had delivered to her. [[Thisalee Crow|Thisalee]] and I have tracked them to a great hatchery constructed within the [[Firelands]]. It is not of this realm, so [[Aviana]] cannot accompany you.

Fly south and enter the flamegate in the center of the valley. Farden Talonshrike has been sent ahead and will be waiting for you within.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

==Completion==
So it's true - Aviana has returned, with you as her herald.

There's much to be done here. We are deep in the heart of the Firelands. Sethria smuggled stolen eggs from Mount Hyjal here to hatch her own hideous creations - birds of prey, trained for war.

I hope you're ready to fight back!

==Notes==
Quite literally due south of the shrine in the middle of the [[Flamewake]] at {{coords|39.1|58.2|Mount Hyjal}} is the second flamegate. Fly through it to enter the [[Firelands Hatchery]] in the [[Firelands]]! At the center of the small rock is {{NPC||Farden Talonshrike}}.
