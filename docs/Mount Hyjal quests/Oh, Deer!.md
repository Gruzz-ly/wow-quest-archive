Rescue three Injured Fawns from [[Inferno (subzone)|the Inferno]] and escort them back to {{NPC||Mylune}} at the [[Grove of Aessina]].
*{{NPC||Injured Fawn}} Escorted Home x3

== Description ==
Do you speak deer? It's all in the nose.

<She points to her nose.>

The does have fled the fires, but their little fawns - Some of them are still trapped in the burning and the hurt!

Go back into the Inferno and escort three injured fawns back here to their mothers right here beside me.

Please save the little fawns, or I'll give you the big eyes!

<Her eyes grow big and dewy.>

You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Hurry! I can smell the smoke!

== Completion ==
Oh yay! Happy little deer!

Now they can grow up and have ADVENTURES.

You're swell.

== Notes ==
Mount up and clear a path between the entrance of the inferno and three deer. It is possible to snag all three deer in one run. Note that deer can't fly (they're not reindeer, after all), so either stay close to the ground or use a land mount when heading back to the grove. Also be warned that the enemies can target and kill the deer after they've been tagged!
