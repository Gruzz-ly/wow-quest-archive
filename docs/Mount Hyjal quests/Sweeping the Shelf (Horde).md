==Objectives==
Slay 8 Twilight Stormcallers and 5 Howling Riftdwellers.
*[[Twilight Stormcaller]] slain (8)
*[[Howling Riftdweller]] slain (5)

==Description==
The shrine is secure, the ogres in disarray. Enough. The time has come to go on the offensive.

Something sinister is underway above us, on the Lightning Ledge. It is time to unleash the fury of the Ancients!

Fly up to the Lightning Ledge and demolish the Twilight's Hammer there. Crush them, <name>, slay their creations and hurl their bodies from the mountainside!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Wolfcaller Bracers|Treads of the Dreamwolf|Girdle of the Ancient Wolf|Goldrinn's Purifier}}

You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}} (or {{cost|16|53}} if completed at level 85)

==Progress==
How goes the fight? I need not tell you how uneasy it makes me to have the Hammer's agents lurking above our heads.

==Completion==
Impressive, <name>. Very impressive.

You embody all of the strength of the Wolf Ancient, and possess the wisdom to use your powers well. I salute you.

==Notes==
Don't worry about killing all of these and turning in before doing the [[Lightning in a Bottle]] chain. One less needless run across the valley.

Also, keep an eye out for [[Leyden Copperkleist]]. He guards an interesting book, [[The Condensation of Electra-Atrocity]].

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}
