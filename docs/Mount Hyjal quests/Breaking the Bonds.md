== Objectives ==
Disable the two Rods of Subjugation that bind {{NPC||Tortolla}}.
*Rod of Subjugation 1 Disabled
*Rod of Subjugation 2 Disabled

== Description ==
From the deep...<br/>
A realm of darkness and fire.<br/>
Grasping in my slumber.

I am ensnared, <race>.

Shadows lurk in the rods of fire beside me.<br/>
Slay them.<br/>
That I may be free again.

== Progress ==
They are not of this world.

They know neither pity nor fear.

== Completion ==
<Tortolla quivers and shakes debris free from his great back.>

You...<br/>
Are not like the others.

I am free once again.

The others...<br/>
Will pay.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Children of Tortolla]] too.

Interact with the rod of subjugation on each side of Tortolla. A {{NPC||Twilight Dominator}} will spawn, a level 80 [[shade]] with 39051 health!
