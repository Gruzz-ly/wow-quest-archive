== Objectives ==
Disable the [[Shadow Cloak Generator]]s until you unveil Aviana's Egg. Once the egg is unveiled, defend it until the [[Druids of the Talon]] can carry it to safety.
*[[Aviana's Egg]] Unveiled and Defended

== Description ==
[[Skylord Omnuron]] wants us to find [[Aviana]]'s Egg, and I can almost guarantee you it's cloaked by one of [[Sethria]]'s shadow devices.

Search around the camp for shadow cloak generators and shut those things down until you find the egg.

Once you've unveiled it, I'll call out to the other [[druid]]s. Defend that egg until we can carry it off to safety.

Go get that egg, <name>!

== Progress ==
<!-- Literally, the progress page for this quest is blank. -->

== Completion ==
We did it, <name>! Aviana's Egg should soon be tucked safely in the boughs of [[Shrine of Aviana|her shrine]].

Do you think this means she'll really return to us?

== Notes ==
Head back to camp and look for rotating purple devices. The shield has a chance of either...

or...

:''Thisalee flies off and summons three druids of the claw. While they get into position, two [[Twilight Dragonkin]] spawn and start attacking the egg. Fend them off while the three [[Druid of the Talon (Cataclysm)|Druids of the Talon]], in flight form, pick up the egg and ferry it to safety.
