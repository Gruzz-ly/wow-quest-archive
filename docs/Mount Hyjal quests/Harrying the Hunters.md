== Objectives ==
Kill 6 Twilight Hunters at [[Wolf's Run]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].
*[[Twilight Hunter]] slain x6

== Description ==
[[Twilight's Hammer]] has revealed itself as more than a mere cult. They're a war machine - a swarm of locusts moving up the mountain, devouring anything in their way.

The parts of the forest they're not setting ablaze are being scoured of life in order to feed the mortal cultists.

We've got to put a stop to the hunters canvassing Wolf's Run, not only to preserve what wildlife remains but to force the cult to march on empty stomachs. Look south of here, as well as up the road to the east.

== Rewards ==
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
How goes the fight below?

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>. I worry that our actions here may be too little, too late, but nature always has a way of rebuilding itself that never ceases to amaze.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[In the Rear With the Gear]] and [[End of the Supply Line]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
