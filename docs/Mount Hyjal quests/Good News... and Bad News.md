==Objectives==
Talk to [[Matoclaw]] at the [[Grove of Aessina]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

==Description==
<Blackhorn used the power of Thol'embaar's remains to slip his bonds. But at least the inferno seems to be subsiding.>

<Matoclaw will want to know what happened here. She's waiting for you back at the Grove of Aessina.>

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|7800}} (or {{coppercost|6600}} at max level)

==Completion==
What? Blackhorn helped you combat the inferno but escaped in the process? That crafty weasel!

It's not your fault, <name>. He'd probably been plotting this the moment he saw the flames begin creeping up the mountain. We'll have to deal with him later.
