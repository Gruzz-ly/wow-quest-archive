== Objectives ==
Gather up Stonebloom, Bitterblossom, and a Darkflame Ember.
*[[Stonebloom]]
*[[Bitterblossom]]
*[[Darkflame Ember]]

== Description ==
I know of a draught that should jolt these gibbering former slaves back to reality. Gather some stonebloom from the rocks around {{NPC||Gar'gol}}'s [[Gar'gol's Hovel|hovel]], some bitterblossom from the shores of the nearby lake, and a darkflame ember from one of the braziers at the hovel entrance. The draught won't last long, so combine the ingredients at a [[Twilight Cauldron|twilight cauldron]] by the entrance to the hovel.

One sip of that draught should knock some sense into the brainwashed slaves!

== Progress ==
<The cauldron burbles, filled with a disgusting liquid.>

== Completion ==
<You dump out the current contents of the cauldron, instantly killing the surrounding plant life.>

<The draught you brew in its place boils chunky and reeks of rotted cabbage. You turn your head aside and bottle it up.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Cleaning House]] and [[The Eye of Twilight]] before heading out. The descriptions are accurate... the cauldron is to the east of the cave entrance, right next to the brazier with the Darkflame Ember.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
