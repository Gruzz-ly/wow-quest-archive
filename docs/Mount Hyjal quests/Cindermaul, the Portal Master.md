== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Cindermaul.jpg|Cindermaul, the Portal Master|Be careful: Cindermaul will almost certainly call forth reinforcements from the other elemental planes.}}
Slay Cindermaul and locate the Tome of Openings.
*[[Cindermaul]] slain
*[[Tome of Openings]]

== Description ==
[[Twilight's Hammer]] is using these corridors, and others like them, to move supplies from the [[elemental plane]]s up into [[Azeroth]]. In order to seal these passages off, we're going to need to know how they're constructed.

Find for me the Tome of Openings, used by the [[elemental]]s to open gates between the planes.

Cindermaul the Portal Master should have one. You'll have to  kill him. Careful! He's probably got some tricks up his sleeve...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
The tome! Have you found it?

== Completion ==
This is the tome we've heard about?

<Jordan hefts the stone slab into his arms and looks it over.>

I see... I guess it's good that I can read some of the [[Kalimag|elemental script]]. I'll work on translating this. Meanwhile, there's {{NPC||Forgemaster Pyrendius||one final problem}} to take care of.

== Notes ==
Head back in to the tunnel to the east. Across from the Twilight Anvil is a small room with three portals guarded by {{NPC||Cindermaul}}, a level 81 elemental with 74,374 health, at {{co|30.8|41.7|Mount Hyjal||1}}. True to Jordan's word, this is a multi-phase fight:
On aggro:
:{{text|say|Cindermaul|Wants to kill us does it? Wants to know our secrets...}}
:''Cindermaul casts Wall of Stone, a four second immunity shield, on aggro. When it drops...''
:{{text|say|Cindermaul|We must destroys it.}}
At 75%:
:{{text|say|Cindermaul|We burns it, we burns! Bring fire, yes!}}
:{{text|emote|Cindermaul calls forth creatures from elsewhere in the [[Firelands]]}}.
:''Cindermaul casts Earthsmash, stunning all foes within the area for five seconds as three Firelands Denizens spawn out of the right-most portal.''
At 50%:
:{{text|say|Cindermaul|Come winds, whisper whisper... Blows it, blows it, blows it away!}}
:{{text|emote|Cindermaul calls forth creatures from Skywall.}}
:''Another Earthsmash stun as three Skywall Denizens appear out of the left-most portal.''
At 25%:
:{{text|say|We ... crushes it! Must ... make crush. Hurry friends!}}
:{{text|emote|Cindermaul calls forth creatures from the heart of Deepholm.}}
:''The final Earthsmash stun as three Deepholm Denizens come out of the center portal.''
On Death:
:{{text|say|Cindermaul|It mustn't know... it mustn't learn... what's ours...}}
:''Cindermaul drops the Battered Stone Chest, which contains the Tome of Openings. Any denizens from the other elemental planes despawn at the same time.''

Loot the chest then head back.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}
