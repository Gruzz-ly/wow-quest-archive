== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Captain Saynna Stormrunner}} at the [[Hyjal Barrow Dens|Barrow Dens]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] wants to free {{NPC||Fandral Staghelm}}?

{{NPC||Malfurion Stormrage||Malfurion}} suspected his corruption ran deep... this just cements it.

At any rate we cannot allow our enemies to get their hands on such a powerful arch druid.

I've a plan, <name>. We will move the prisoner through the [[Emerald Dream]]. It will be risky, but with all the cultists present here it might be the only way to guarantee our success.

Speak to Saynna Stormrunner inside the Barrow Dens to the northeast.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

== Completion ==
The dragon might be right. The Twilight's Hammer has breached our security and this is our most dangerous prisoner.

== Notes ==
The entrance to the [[Hyjal Barrow Dens]] {{co|52.5|17.2|Mount Hyjal||1}} is in the northeast corner of the valley, just east of the [[Ruins of Lar'donir]]. There, {{NPC||Barrow Deeps Watcher}}s are fending off {{NPC||Twilight Assassin}}s. The captain is inside. Follow the path in and eastward until getting turned around and entering a big room facing west. Behind the player to the southeast (down the ramp) is a path east to the captain guarding Fandral.
