== Objectives ==
Go into [[Inferno (subzone)|the Inferno]] and rescue any combination of 10 {{NPC||Panicked Bunny||Panicked Bunnies}} or {{NPC||Terrified Squirrel}}s.
*[[Frightened Animal]] x10

== Description ==
Help us, <class>! The forest is aflame, and the wee animals can't find their way out. They can't fight for themselves, with their teeny-tiny little teeth and their soft furry paws! They're fluffy and sweet.

They have wet little noses!

If you don't save them, I don't want to even THINK about it.

<She slaps her palms over her eyes.>

I'm not thinking!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Did you save the wee animals? And their wee little friends?

== Completion ==
Squueeee!

Did the nice <Mr/Mrs>. <class> pull you from the flames, little friend? You're safe now!

Hooray!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Fighting Fire With ... Anything]] and [[Disrupting the Rituals]] before heading out. Critters everywhere in the inferno. Ignore the {{NPC||Injured Fawn}}s, though. They're [[Oh, Deer!|next up]].

==Progression==
{{Grove of Aessina}}
