== Objectives ==
Climb up trees in the [[Whistling Grove]], grab stranded [[Hyjal Bear Cub (NPC)|Hyjal Bear Cubs]], and then hurl them at the Soft Target from the top of the tree. This is perfectly safe.
*[[Hyjal Bear Cub]]s Rescued (6)

== Description ==
Do not fear the bears in this grove, <class> - I have pacified them for the moment.

My concern at present is for the welfare of the bear cubs. The fires drove the little ones up the trees, where they've gotten stuck. We've got to get those bears safely to the ground!

Flying creatures frighten them, so you'll have to climb the trees yourself. Look for footholds at the trunks. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and toss them - GENTLY! - onto the target here.

Nothing can go wrong with this plan.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Stickyfoot Sandals|Treegrip Pants|Wildlife Defender}}
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Please don't hurt the trees. Or the bears.

Or yourself.

== Completion ==
I thank you, <name>. Those little bears are shaken up but they'll survive.

At least the ones that hit the mat.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|Find a Tree to Climb}}

Head to a [[Climbing Tree|tree]] and hop on the ladder. Once on the tree, players are effectively in a vehicle with two abilities:
#{{abilities|Climb Up|Climb higher up the tree.}}
#{{abilities|Climb Down|Climb down the tree.}}

On getting in a tree:
:{{text|bossemote|Grab a Bear Cub}}

Climb up to get in range of a bear and loot it.
:{{text|emote|<Name> scoops up a squriming bear cub.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Climb to the Tree Top}}

Climb to the top of the tree to get a new ability:
*{{abilities|Chuck-a-bear|range=70|Hurl a bear cub from the tree. Aim for the target so it doesn't get hurt!}}

On reaching the top:
:{{text|bossemote|Chuck the Bear Cub!}}

Aim for the trampoline, otherwise the bear <strike>won't survive the fall.</strike> (Correction.  The bear cubs totally survive the fall.  They're bears.  Getting thrown out of a tree onto hard ground is nothing more than if they were tanking the ground with a [[Skull Bash]].  "Take that stupid ground!"  Missing the trampoline just means it does not count as a "rescue". ) Then climb back down to repeat the process.

If any doubt remains about the durability of these bear cubs, consider the achievement [[And the Meek Shall Inherit Kalimdor]] where instead of throwing the bears into the trampoline, you hurl one at a sleeping [[Brimstone Hound]] and the bear cub ''kills the giant flaming dog in a few seconds''.
