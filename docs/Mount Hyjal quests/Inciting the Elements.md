==Objectives==
Feed [[:Juniper Berries]] to the {{NPC||Faerie Dragon (NPC)||Faerie Dragon}}s and slay 4 Twilight Inciters.
*[[Twilight Inciter]] slain (4)

== Description ==
This is no mere natural occurrence, <name>. There must be a [[Twilight's Hammer|twilight]] presence behind our lines that we haven't accounted for.

It's possible that whoever is instigating the elemental disturbance is using foul magic to hide themselves from our sight.

Seek the aid of the [[Faerie Dragon (NPC)|faerie dragon]]s that roam near the [[Nordrassil|world tree]]; they can see through any of our enemy's illusions.

Feed them the juniper berries that grow nearby to gain their trust.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Back already, <name>?

== Completion ==
You've done well, <name>. We cannot allow the Twilight's Hammer spies this close to the world tree!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Earth Rises]] before heading out.

There are juniper plants everywhere. Gather some berries then find a faerie dragon. Target a faerie dragon and use the item.
