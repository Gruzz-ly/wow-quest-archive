==Objectives==
Heat the Inert Ashbringer at the [[Hyjal Bonfire|bonfire]] at the abandoned [[druid]] camp south of the [[Nordrassil]], then quench the Heated Blade into the waters of the [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|Well of Eternity]]. 

Speak with [[The Will of the Ashbringer]] when you are done.
*[[Tempered Blade]]
*[[Inert Ashbringer]] (provided)

==Description==
<The branches of Nordrassil create a fire unlike anything you've ever seen. It almost seems to have a will and intelligence of its own. You can't be sure, but you could swear that the flame seems to have some awareness of your presence and regards you with a kind of curiosity.>

<As unsettling as that is, all that remains is to heat the blade and plunge it into the waters of the Well of Eternity.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*Corrupted Ashbringer

==Progress==
It is done. The blade is restored, though it still bears the taint of corruption.

==Completion==
You’ve done so much, but I must ask you to bear the blade to one final destination.

Once there, we can only hope that the soul of [[Alexandros Mograine]] has the courage to take the final step.
