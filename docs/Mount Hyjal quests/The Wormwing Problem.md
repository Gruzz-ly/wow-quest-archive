== Objectives ==
Slay any combination of 10 [[Wormwing|Wormwing Harpies]] (either {{NPC||Wormwing Screecher||Screechers}} or {{NPC||Wormwing Swifttalon||Swifttalons}}).
*Wormwing Harpy x10

== Description ==
{{NPC||Skylord Omnuron}} has been too gentle with the Wormwing harpies, allowing them to share a perch on [[Mount Hyjal|this mountain]]. Just because they're creatures of the air. Well <class>, not all creatures of the air are created equal.

When the attacks on Hyjal began, the Wormwing went into a frenzy. They're up there now, assaulting a [[Shrine of Aviana|sacred shrine]] they once claimed to revere.

I'm not troubled. Now we have a reason to drive them from Hyjal, don't we?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Have you helped thin their numbers, <class>?

== Completion ==
<Thisalee nods, contentedly, her eyes sparkling.>

Feels great to be off the leash, doesn't it?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Scrambling for Eggs]] before heading out. Go west and kill stuff. Look for eggs at the base of trees.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Aviana}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
