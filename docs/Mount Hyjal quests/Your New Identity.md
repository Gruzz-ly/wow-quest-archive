== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Condenna the Pitiless}} at the Training Grounds in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[Forged Recruitment Papers]] (provided)

== Description ==
There. Not my best work, but certainly not my worst. You will be known as "<name>damus" among the cultists.

These papers will bump you ahead of the other recruits and allow you to speak directly to the [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight]] instructors.

Go to the [[The Twilight Gauntlet|proving grounds]] and show these to Condenna the Pitiless. She's separating the wheat from the chaff.

Show her what you're made of.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

== Progress ==
You will address me with the respect I am due, recruit.

== Completion ==
<Name>damus? Let us hope your parents brought you into this world with more than just a ridiculous name.

== Notes ==
Follow the road southeast. At the fork, keep flying straight to reach the Twilight Gauntlet, where Condenna and Cargall await. Her gossip text sheds some impressive light on the power of the cult:
:The Twilight's Hammer is a major power to be reckoned with. Thanks to us, {{NPC||Deathwing}} is free. Thanks to us [[Old Gods]] have risen from the bowels of the earth. Thanks to us... Hyjal burns.

:What do you think you have to offer us?

==Progression==
