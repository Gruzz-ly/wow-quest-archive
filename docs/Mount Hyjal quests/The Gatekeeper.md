==Objectives==
Use the Horn of Cenarius to help you slay Azralon the Gatekeeper.
*[[Azralon the Gatekeeper]] slain
*[[Horn of Cenarius (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
According to these tomes, one of [[Ragnaros]]' most powerful lieutenants serves as the sole gatekeeper to [[Sulfuron Spire]].

You won't be able to defeat him alone.

Sound this horn when you engage in combat with Azralon and any of our forces in the vicinity will come to your aid.

You must hurry, <name>. It won't be long before the Firelord realizes what we're up to.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Torque of the Herald|Gatekeeper Treads}}
You will also receive: {{cost|16|40}}

==Progress==
You've returned, <name>?

==Completion==
It is done. Only the final step in your mission remains.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Sanctum of the Prophets]] before heading out. Fly west back toward [[Sulfuron Spire]], but take a right heading north at the fork to get to the sanctum. Azralon is a boss-level [[flamewaker]] with 357,000 health at {{coords|57.2|68.0|Mount Hyjal}} in the middle of the sanctum with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Evil Cleave|Inflicts 339 to 340% of normal melee damage to an enemy and its nearest allies, afflicting up to three targets.|notes=Next melee. 6000-7000 damage}}
*{{abilities|Fire Nova|Inflicts fire damage to nearby enemies.|notes=4400-4600 Fire damage}}
Clear the cultists in front of him, then use the horn to call for help. Let the Nordassil Druids get initial aggro on him, then unload. He can kill the druids fairly quickly, so move fast! At 50%, Goldrinn will join the fight.
:{{text|yell|Azralon the Gatekeeper|Feel the fury of Ragnaros!}}
:{{text|yell|Goldrinn|You know nothing of fury, worm!}}

On victory:
:{{text|say|Goldrinn|Let this be a lesson to those who would defile Hyjal.}}
:''Goldrinn takes his leave with one powerful leap.''

Complete Jarod's and Aronus's forks before Cenarius will offer [[The Firelord]].
