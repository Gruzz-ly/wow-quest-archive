== Objectives ==
Seek out the [[Eye of Twilight]] near the entrance to [[Gar'gol's Hovel]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
The [[ogre]] clan aross the lake is led by {{NPC||Gar'gol}}. I use the term loosely; Gar'gol has the intelligence of raw beef.

So far as I can tell, Gar'gol is taking orders from a magical instrument: "The Eye of Twilight." He follows its commands unquestioningly.

If we can sabotage the eye, we can cause unimaginable havoc.

Go to Gar'gol's hovel and seek out the Eye of Twilight near the entrance. Study it. Find a way to subvert it. Ah, marvelous chaos...

== Completion ==
<You approach the Eye of Twilight. As your fingertips graze its luminescent surface, you are away of a malignant presence peering back at you, searching your soul.>

<Instinctively, you draw back.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Cleaning House]] and [[From the Mouth of Madness]] before heading out. The Eye is just to the west of the cave entrance.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
