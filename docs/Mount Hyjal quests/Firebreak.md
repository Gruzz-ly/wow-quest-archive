== Objectives ==
Slay 10 Lava Surgers.
*[[Lava Surger (Hyjal)|Lava Surger]] slain x10

== Description ==
In their efforts to decimate [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]], [[Twilight's Hammer]] has [[earth elemental|elementals]] scouring the earth in the wake of the fire.

They're pulverizing the soil, rooting around in the ash, digging up any scrap of plantlife that survived and destroying it. It's like they're paving the way for... I don't even want to imagine.

Stop them before Hyjal is devoid of life. Kill the lava surgers!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
If Hyjal is any indication of their plans for the rest of [[Azeroth]], I shudder to think of what will happen if Twilight's Hammer ever gets their way.

== Completion ==
Good work, <name>. There's a chance the forest will recover from this yet.

Now, there's something else I need you to take care of for me...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Durable Seeds]] and [[Fresh Bait]] before heading out. Head northeast into the [[Flamewake]] -- much more target-rich environment.

==Progression==
{{Sanctuary of Malorne}}

==Patch changes==
