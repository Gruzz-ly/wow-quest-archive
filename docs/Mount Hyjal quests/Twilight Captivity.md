== Objectives ==
Obtain a {{NPC||Twilight Overseer}}'s key at the [[Twilight Command Post]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[Twilight Overseer's Key]]

== Description ==
I'd been scouting behind enemy lines for nearly a day when they caught me.

This attack on our frontlines is not what it appears, <name>.

I'll give you all the details, but first let's find a way to get me out of here.

Only the overseers carry keys to these cages.

From what I recall, they're in the middle of the crater, in the thick of it.

See if you can get a key off of one of them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Progress ==
The key, <name>. Did you get it?

== Completion ==
I am thankful, <name>. I will deliver my findings to our people.

== Notes ==
Overseers litter the camp, just south of Larandia's position.

==Progression==
{{Nordrassil}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
