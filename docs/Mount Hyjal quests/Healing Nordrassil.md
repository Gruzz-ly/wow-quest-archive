==Objectives==
Defeat [[Azerite elemental]]s and seal [[Azeroth]]'s injuries at [[Nordrassil]].
*Restore Nordassil by defeating enemies and healing wounds
*[[Azerite Leviathan]] slain

==Description==
Azerite elementals are runnin' wild, driven mad by [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth's]] pain. They're menacin' the spirits o' nature that protect the World Tree.

The roots o' Nordrassil run deep, nurtured by these sacred waters. For the sake o' Azeroth's [[world soul]], the tree must be defended.

Quiet the restless elementals and use yer [[Heart of Azeroth|Heart o' Azeroth]] tae mend the wounds ye find. We cannae let [[Hyjal]] become another gapin' scar like [[Silithus: The Wound|Silithus]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Champions of Azeroth]]

==Progress==
This just keeps gettin' worse. If too many wounds open up, we may not be able tae stop the cascade.

==Completion==
Ye did it, <name>! I can feel her pain diminishin'.

And the Heart seems tae be even stronger now!

To fill up the bar, you can...

*Interact with [[Frantic Faerie Dragon]]s
*Use the Heart of Azeroth [[Extra Action Button|action button]] to seal Azerite wounds

==PTR version==
;Description
The agony she feels... the roots o' Nordrassil run deep, and Azeroth is bleedin' through!

You must put tae rest th' elementals running wild. The pain of the world, it's driven 'em mad. 

Where ye find the most damage, use yer [[:Heart of Azeroth]] tae seal the injuries. With any luck, we can stop this before it turns into another gaping scar like in [[Silithus: The Wound|Silithus]]!
