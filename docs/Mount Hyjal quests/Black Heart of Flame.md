== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Tholembaar.jpg|Thol'embaar|Use the charred branch within the Inferno to call forth the creature of flame.}}
Use the Charred Branch within [[Inferno (subzone)|the Inferno]] to summon {{NPC||Thol'embaar}}. Kill him and take the Black Heart of Thol'embaar.
*[[Black Heart of Thol'embaar]]
*[[Charred Branch]] (provided)

== Description ==
Now you will use our newfound knowledge to pull Thol'embaar into the [[mortal plane]] like a babe screaming from the womb. Then you will crush him.

The ritual is simple: take this charred branch, tap it on the ground three times, and utter his name aloud.

You must call him from within the heart of the Inferno. Destroy him, and bring his black heart back to me.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Charbite Hood|Embercrusher Grips|Signet of Nascent Fire}}

== Progress ==
Tell me! Have you fought Thol'embaar yet?

I am living vicariously through you, <race>. Do not disappoint!

== Completion ==
There it is! Such a trophy! Born in the fires of [[elemental plane|another plane]]...

Go ahead, <race>. Crush it. Crush his charcoal heart in your hands and let the winds scatter the ashes... yes, yes.

== Notes ==
On using the branch:
:{{text|say|Thol'embaar|Fool of a mortal. Flesh burns.}}
On death:
:{{text|say|Thol'embaar|Others will come... the [[Age of Mortals|age of mortals]]... has passed.}}

On complete:
:{{text|emote|The dark ashes swirl around Tyrus Blackhorn, who utters an incantation:}}
:{{text|say|Tyrus Blackhorn|Ashes from the plane below, scattered by the hand of foe...}}
:{{text|say|Tyrus Blackhorn|Gods of terror, quake and thunder, tear these mortal bonds asunder!}}
:{{text|emote|Tyrus Blackhorn barks a cruel laugh.}}
:''Blackhorn shatters his bonds, standing freely!''
:{{text|say|Tyrus Blackhorn|Thank you, mortal! Your heroism in The Inferno has made my escape possible.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrus Blackhorn|As a reward, I will allow you to live.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrus Blackhorn|But your time will come soon enough. Yes, mortal. Soon enough...}}
:''Blackhorn teleports away.''
