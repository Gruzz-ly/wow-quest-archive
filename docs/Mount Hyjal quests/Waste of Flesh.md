==Objectives==
Use the Frostgale Crystal to extinguish the flames on an Immolated Supplicant.
*[[Immolated Supplicant]] saved x4
*[[Frostgale Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Look at these fools. Half of them won't even make it past this trial.

They are not worthy of ascending into our inner circles. But perhaps... perhaps they are worthy of menial service.

Take this gem and utilize its power to save one of the less competent supplicants. Someone who's got no chance of succeeding. Those already on fire, preferably.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Did you find suitable servants for me, <name>damus?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>damus. I'm having the servants you chose for me briefed on their new duties.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Trial By Fire]] and [[In Bloom]] before heading out. Immolated supplicants, since they are actually on fire, spawn, run around for 10–15 seconds, then die. So find one and use the item quickly.

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
