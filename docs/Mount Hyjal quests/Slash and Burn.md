==Objectives==
Ride an [[Emerald Drake (Mount Hyjal)|Emerald Drake]] and slay 40 [[Twilight's Hammer]] units and 5 [[Twilight Drake]]s.
*[[Twilight Stormwaker]] slain (5)
*Twilight's Hammer unit slain (40)

==Description==
Victory is possible, <name>.

This portal is not just a means of bringing back [[Cenarius]] through the dream. Think about it, <name>. Once a gateway through the [[Emerald Dream]] is open, our forces can use them to move freely from [[Moonglade]], [[Nordrassil]], and even [[Wyrmrest]] to this strategic location.

All [[Ysera]] needs is time. It'll be up to you to keep the Twilight's Hammer forces in [[Darkwhisper Gorge]] from pulling together and attacking us from the east.

Take one of the emerald drakes and hit them hard, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|15|60}}

==Progress==
You've returned, <name>.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. We might win this one yet.

==Notes==
Hop on a drake. It has three abilities:
:1) {{Abilities|id=75637|icon=spell_nature_elementalshields|Acid Blast|range=unlimited|Fires an acid blast at enemy targets on the ground, inflicting 13125 to 16875 damage.|notes=Instant|energy=100 mana}}
:2) {{Abilities|id=75668|icon=inv_misc_monsterfang_01|Aerial Swipe|range=30|Close in on a Twilight Stormwaker and go for the throat!|notes=Instant|cd=5 sec}}
:4) {{Abilities|id=76460|icon=spell_fire_burningspeed|Speed Burst|Gain a boost to flight speed for 5 seconds.|notes=Instant|cd=30 sec}}

Either one of the following counts towards the 40 unites:
*([[Fiery Instructor]])
*([[Twilight Enforcer (Mount Hyjal)|Twilight Enforcer]])
*([[Twilight Initiate (Mount Hyjal)|Twilight Initiate]])

On complete, a cutscene:
:{{text|say|Jarod|Just a few more minutes... Cenarius is almost here!}}
:''The Ancients walk in to frame.''
:{{text|say|Goldrinn|You might not have that long. Enemy reinforcements are already underway.}}
:{{text|say|Jarod|Goldrinn! It's true then... the Ancients walk among us again!}}
:{{text|say|Aviana|There will be time to celebrate later, commander. Twilight dragons approach!}}
:{{text|say|Jarod|Quick! Do not let them disrupt Ysera's magic!}}
:{{text|say|Jarod|Hold them back as long as you can!}}
:{{text|say|Cenarius|That... will not be necessary.}}
:''Cenarius walks in to frame and calmly knocks the twilight drakes out of the sky.''
:{{text|say|Jarod|Cenarius! Excellent! With the portal active, we can move our forces to the frontlines unfettered.}}
:{{text|say|Jarod|You are a most welcome sight, son of [[Malorne]]! We must preserve your power so you can spearhead the attack against the Firelord.}}
:{{text|say|Cenarius|What about the Twilight dragons? There will be more where those came from.}}
:''Ysera walks in to frame.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|Leave that to me.}}
:''Ysera shifts to her dragon form and takes to the air.''

The [[Gates of Sothann]] then enter a new phase, acting as a small quest hub led by [[Cenarius]] and [[Jarod Shadowsong]] and featuring a new [[flight master]].

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}
