==Objectives==
Use your Call the Flock ability to gather 12 Alpine Songbirds, 5 Forest Owls, and 2 Goldwing Hawks.
*[[Alpine Songbird]] gathered x12
*[[Forest Owl]] gathered x5
*[[Goldwing Hawk]] gathered x2
*[[Quill of the Bird-Queen]] (provided)

==Description==
Today, we have an opportunity to make another assault against one of [[Ragnaros]]' greater minions: [[Millagazor]]. However, we first need to get some assistance.

<Matoclaw holds up a large, silky feather.>

Use this artifact to invoke the power of [[Aviana]]. Once you have done so, travel northwest and gather some of her flock by calling out to them.

Once you have done so, we may proceed against Millagazor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1
*52050 XP (or {{cost|12|40|50}} at max level)
*+150 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Matoclaw.jpg|Matoclaw|We are ready to take on Millagazor.}}
<Amidst the chirps, hoots, and frenzied caws of your fellow birds, you hear the voice of Matoclaw speaking to you from afar.>

Well done, <race>. Now that the flock is assembled, we strike.

==Notes==
Use the quill to transform into the [[Wings of Aviana]]. In this form, players have access to one ability:
*{{abilities|Call the Flock|Call nearby birds to join your flock.|notes=Instant|cd=3 sec}}

Fly northwest to the part of the Regrowth closer to the [[Grove of Aessina]] and the [[Whistling Grove]]. Lots of birds are flying around. Fly relatively close to them and use the Call the Flock ability to add them to party group.

Goldwing Hawks fly in the open air high above the ground, Forest Owls are circling threes about 20 yards up and Alpine Songbirds are typically hiding between trees and cliff faces. Gather all of them and the quest will complete automatically.

If you leave the areas that you are supposed to be in, you will be warned: {{text|bossemote|Return to the Hyjal invasion area, or you will be dropped!}}

==Related Achievements==
The achievement [[Ludicrous Speed]] can only be completed while on this quest. Each '''successful''' use of the Call the Flock ability will grant stacks of [[Soar]]: 1 for [[Alpine Songbird]], 5 for [[Forest Owl]], and 15 for [[Goldwing Hawk]]. Hence to successfully complete the achievement, you must collect 2 hawks, 5 owls and 10 songbirds without letting [[Soar]] drop off. Note that once you have completed the quest's quota for a particular type of bird, you cannot use that type further to increase (or even maintain) your stack of Soar.
