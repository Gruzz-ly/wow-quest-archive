== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Forgemaster Pyrendius.jpg|Forgemaster Pyrendius|Use the runes that circle Pyrendius to destroy him. He's too strong to fight alone!}}
Slay Forgemaster Pyrendius. Lure him onto the Portal Runes and use them to weaken him.
*[[Forgemaster Pyrendius]] slain

== Description ==
A terrible evil squats in the heart of [[Firelands Forgeworks|this cavern]], <name>. Forgemaster Pyrendius has personally crafted many of the cursed weapons that [[Twilight's Hammer]] is using in their conquest of the [[Azeroth|realms above]].

Before we can leave these [[Firelands|lands of flame]]... Pyrendius must die.

He will not go down easy. But if I'm reading the tome correctly, we can briefly open up small gateways to the [[Abyssal Maw]], the realm of water. Lure Pyrendius onto a portal rune and activate it to weaken him!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Wolfking Spaulders|Helm of Terrorizing Fangs|Forgemaster's Shattered Shackle}}
You will also receive: {{cost|15|60}}

== Progress ==
Is Pyrendius dead? This ashen heat of this cave is suffocating me!

== Completion ==
It is done! We'll seal this fiery hole up behind us and let the minions of the Twilight's Hammer discover the corpses we left behind. We couldn't have done it without you, <name>!

== Notes ==
Head southeast past the portal master. Pyrendius, a level 81 elite [[flamewaker]] with 185,000 health is at {{co|31.9|46.3|Mount Hyjal||1}} in the center of the southeast room. Circling him are five portal runes, much like the runes seen in [[Molten Core]]. Trigger a rune then drag Pyrendius over it to knock a healthy chunk of his health off.

On aggro:

*{{text|say|Forgemaster Pyrendius|Aiiieee!}}
*{{text|say|Forgemaster Pyrendius|It ... burns!}}
*{{text|say|Forgemaster Pyrendius|This <glub> is not over yet, mortal...}}
