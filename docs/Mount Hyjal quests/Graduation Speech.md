== Objectives ==
Use the Initiation Podium at [[Doom's Vigil]] to successfully deliver the Graduation Speech.
*Graduation Speech x10

== Description ==
You're finally ready, <name>damus.

I am so proud of you and all you've accomplished.

Today you will deliver a speech in front of your peers and inspire them to crush our enemies until [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]] is nothing but a pile of ash.

Remember, <name>damus. It'll be important to read your audience's emotions and use words that best address those emotions.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|23|40}}

== Progress ==
Have you come to finish me off?

No... you appear to be... sane.

== Completion ==
You. You're clearly not with them.

An ally then?

== Notes ==
Back at [[Doom's Vigil]], [[Jarod Shadowsong]] is standing chained to an altar behind the Initiation Podium, flanked by a few [[Twilight Enforcer (Mount Hyjal)|Twilight Enforcers]] in front of a large crowd of [[Twilight Initiate (Mount Hyjal)|Twilight Initiates]].

Get behind the podium to start giving the speech using its provided abilities:
:1) {{Abilities|Inspire!|id=74934|icon=spell_misc_emotionafraid|If your audience lacks motivation, a little inspirational oratory is in order.|cd=9 sec}}
:2) {{Abilities|Incite!|id=74935|icon=spell_misc_emotionangry|If your audience is angry, divert that anger toward infighting!|cd=9 sec}}
:3) {{Abilities|Pander!|id=74937|icon=spell_misc_emotionhappy|These people are insane. You need to play along with it.|cd=9 sec}}
:5){{Abilities|Step Down|id=74947|icon=spell_lifegivingspeed|Quit giving the speech.}}
The three speech abilities have a shared 9 second cooldown. Wait until a random initiate says something, then respond to their mood...

;Inspire
*Meh.
*Yea... I don't know about this.
*I'm not quite convinced.
* *yawn*

*{{text|say|<Name>|There will be no surrender! There will be no escape! There will be no quarter!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|Look at how far we've come! Yesterday we lived in the shadows of civilization... hunted like rats! But today! HYJAL BURNS!!!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|It is truly a great time for the Twilight's Hammer. The greatest of times. First, Lord Deathwing's arrival. And now... now great Ragnaros has returned!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|Not all of you will ascend to glory. Look to your left. Look to your right. THEY will perish in the end times. But YOU will become immortal.}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|It is in this moment, friends, that we should ask ourselves. What would the Old Gods want us to do?}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|One by one... our enemies will perish! One by one... they will be destroyed!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|I look upon the symbol that unites us. This hammer. It is the hammer that builds and creates. But it is also the hammer that bludgeons and destroys!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|Eons ago, the "Titans" came here and cast down our Masters. But this is NOT their world, and it never was! Judgment comes at last!}}

;Incite
*Raaahhh!!!!
*Blood!
*Kill!!!
*Kill them all!
*Crush!
*Death!

*{{text|say|<Name>|But always remember that our movement cannot stay pure if some traitors among you still draw breath. You know who I mean.}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|But a bitter stench blows into our ranks. The answer is to purge! PURGE! Purge until the Twilight's Hammer is pure again!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|We walk the edge of a precipice. Some of us must be pushed over for the rest of us to continue.}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|And to those who call for harmony among our ranks... to them I ask: "Does not ALL strife please our masters? Does not ALL bloodlet feed their thirst?"}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|Remember the words of C'thun! Remember them well! "Your friends will betray you!" And betray us they have!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|And some will preach unity! But does unity prevent a chain from breaking at its weakest link?}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|And these incidents... these divisive acts of hate against other members of our organization. They were cowardly and ugly, yes. But maybe... they were NECESSARY!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|And yes, Cho'gall might have founded the Twilight's Hammer, but who made it what it is today? Who preached the truth and faced persecution in the orc and human cities?}}

;Pander
*It's like... it's like the void just touched my mind.
*The end is nigh! The end is a new beginning!
*Immalanath, yasoth nalarub!!!
*I hear the voices!

*{{text|say|<Name>|Do not think it is luck that brought you here. Luck had nothing to do with it. Our MASTERS' WILL brought us here!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|And there is no hope! There is no hope but in the loss of all hope. That's right, brothers and sisters. Only hopelessness can grant true hope!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|The blood we shed speaks to us. It says "Thank you."}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|Place a plam across your heart and reach forward with your other hand to touch the infinite. Does it feel soft? NO! It feels... immense.}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|Yes, my fellow initiates. The friend of my enemy's enemy... well he is also the enemy of my friend. And yes... he shall perish too!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|And sometimes you have to ask yourself: "Is it worth it?" And the answer is plain: "Pain is not the cost, but the reward!"}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|F'tagh nah'hat! I'mmathan! Sha'lub nahab! Sha'lub nahab, my friends!}}

;Right answer
*{{text|yell|It's like I'm hearing the Old Gods themselves!}}
*{{text|yell|This <girl/guy> gets it!}}
*{{text|yell|Tell it like it is, <brother/sister>!}}
*{{text|yell|<Name>damus, you're a born leader!}}
*{{text|yell|That's how it's done! Yeah!}}
*{{text|yell|History in the making!}}
*{{text|yell|Truer words were never spoken!}}}}

;Wrong answer
*{{text|yell|Huh?}}
*{{text|yell|You lie!}}
*{{text|yell|Sit down!}}
*{{text|yell|What are you talking about?}}
*{{text|yell|Who is this guy?}}

The exact responses are random, as is the crowd mood itself, so it's possible to have repeat phrases or even have a speech with no angry elements. Nonetheless, after the 10th response, the [[Twilight Initiate (Mount Hyjal)|Twilight Initiate]] crowd will start throwing things, casting shadowbolts, and generally rioting against the ogre [[Twilight Enforcer]]s, who respond as expected:
* {{text|yell|Twilight Enforcer|I knew the puny ones weren't to be trusted!}}
* {{text|yell|Twilight Enforcer|You runts want to riot? I'll show you!}}
* {{text|yell|Twilight Enforcer|Agghh! So many of them!}}

In the chaos, [[Elementalist Ortell]] arrives in character, makes an excuse to slip away with Shadowsong, then quietly coordinates with the hero to regroup.
* {{text|yell|Elementalist Ortell|Yes, my brethren! We are claiming this prisoner for the True Sons of Twilight! These ogre scum are not fit to offer him as a sacrifice! They are not worthy of the Old Gods' grace!}}
* ''<Ortell lets Shadowsong down from the pedestal.>''
* {{text|say|Elementalist Ortell|Come on now [[Jarod Shadowsong|commander]]. Let's get you out of here. <name>, meet us at the [[Gates of Sothann]] -- Ysera awaits!}}

Ortell and Shadowsong slip away as the riot continues, and the hero is free to depart.
