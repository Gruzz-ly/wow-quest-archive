==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Millagazor's escape.jpg|Millagazor|Pull him out of that portal and destroy him!}}
Use the Quill of the Bird-Queen to summon and defeat Millagazor.
*[[Millagazor]] slain
*[[Quill of the Bird-Queen (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Matoclaw's voice continues to echo within your head.>

Millagazor is a creature of flame, but in many ways, he is not unlike the birds of this land. As such, [[Aviana]]'s artifacts may still have the power to summon him.

The fiery portal to the west is where you will find him. Use the quill near the portal's entrance, then prepare for a fierce battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 XP (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
[[Earth Mother|Earth-Mother]] guide your path.

==Completion==
Well done, champion.

==Notes==
Wings Aflame is automatically offered upon completion of [[Call the Flock]]. The western fiery portal can be found at {{co|13.1|45.1|Mount Hyjal}} in the western part of the Regrowth near the [[Grove of Aessina]]. Get out of the Wings of Aviana form in order to summon Millagazor.

Millagazor is a level 85 elemental with 464k health. It has the following abilities:

;Aggro: {{text|yell|Millagazor|Who summons Millagazor?}}
;At 30%: {{text|bossemote|Millgazor begins to escape!}}
:{{text|yell|Millagazor|You pests are not worth my time!}}
At 30% Millagazor attempts to flee, but the flock called in the previous quest comes to finish the fight.

Should players defeat Millagazor without taking damage from Gout of Flame, they will complete the Millagazor step of [[Infernal Ambassadors]].
