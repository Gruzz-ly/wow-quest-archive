== Objectives ==
Kill 5 Fiery Tormentors to keep them from {{NPC||Nordu}}.
*[[Fiery Tormentor]] slain x5

== Description ==
It is... too late for me. Burned to all but the core. I have lived eons ... yet still my end seems sudden.

New life can spring from old. I still have wisdom to pass on. Please... do not let them take me before my work is done.

Keep the tormentors at bay... just a little longer, <class>.

Give me minutes, and I will give you a thousand lifetimes.

== Progress ==
Are you there, <class>? My vision is failing... I hear fighting...

== Completion ==
Thank you, <race>.

I am ready now.

All that I am, and all that this forest once was... it is now yours.

==Progression==
