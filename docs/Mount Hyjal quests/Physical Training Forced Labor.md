==Objectives==
Break 5 Darkwhisper Lodestones.
*Darkwhisper Lodestone broken x5
*[[Twilight Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
Training to join our ranks is not pleasant. Why should it be?

The path to serve the [[Old Gods]] is long, painful, and soul-harrowing. Consider this your first step.

Take this pick and break the lodestone deposit found in the gorge.

No, we don't need any of this ore. This is purely for your benefit.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Is it done yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Very well. You're at least competent enough to figure out which way the pointy end of the pick goes.

==Notes==
Head out, look for ore deposits and break them.

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}

==Patch changes==
