==Objectives==
Obtain 125 Marks of the World Tree.
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] (125)

==Description==
We've constructed this [[moonwell]], but it serves little purpose until it is filled with the sacred waters of the [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|Well of Eternity]].

With an active moonwell, we would be able to bless our food stores, and we may also be able to use the blessing to offer you some protection from fire as well.

When you've obtained enough marks, speak to [[Matoclaw]] at the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]]. She'll be able to secure transport of the sacred waters.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|188000}}
*86750 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|206700}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
How can I be of aid, <name>?

==Completion==
Of course.  I will see to it that the sacred waters are transported through the portal right away.

Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
[[File:Eternal Fruit.jpg|thumb|The offerings of eternal fruit.]]
Upon completion of ''both'' [[Druids of the Talon (quest)]] and [[The Shadow Wardens]], Ayla and the empty moonwell will phase in on the west side of [[Malfurion's Breach]], south of the path to the [[Furnace]].

During this phase, players can earn a maximum of 27 marks each day, so this quest will take five days to complete.

Once the moonwell is filled, the player will notice some shrubs with fruit that activates the gear cursor.  The player can harvest one of each of 4 kinds of [[conjured]] reusable foods:

*[[Eternal Lunar Pear]]
*[[Eternal Eye of Elune]]
*[[Eternal Moonberry]]
*[[Eternal Sunfruit]]

These bushes show up on [[Herbalist]]s' [[Find Herbs|weed-DAR]].  Each fruit grants 120K health and mana very quickly.  They also grant 90 stamina and a fruit-specific bonus to another stat.  Did we mention they are reusable?

Upon completion, a scripted event occurs:
* {{text|say|Matoclaw|[[Tenaron Stormgrip|Tenaron]], old friend.  Would you go collect a vial of moonwell water for this <class>?}}
* {{text|say|Tenaron Stormgrip|It would be my pleasure, Matoclaw.}}
* {{text|say|Matoclaw|Go now, <name>.  The moonwell will be filled by the time you return to the front.}}

==Progression==
