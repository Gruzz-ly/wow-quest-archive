==Objectives==
Obtain 20 Marks of the World Tree.
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] (20)

==Description==
We suffered heavy losses during the backdraft after our invasion attempt. Our second attempt cannot fail.

We need reinforcements before we attempt another invasion. Please, <name>, work with [[Matoclaw]] to obtain enough resources to afford reinforcements. Then, we take our second and final stab at the [[Firelands]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
The sooner we can break through our invasion portal, the better.

==Completion==
Excellent work. I will send for our reinforcements right away.

==Notes==
It's daily quest time! Speak with [[Matoclaw]] and occasionally [[Mylune]] to pick up daily quests. Three daily quests are available each day, and a total of four marks can be earned each day this phase, so this quest will take three days to complete, counting from the day players pick up this quest.

==Progression==
