==Objectives==
Slay 6 [[Fiery Behemoth]]s or [[Seething Pyrelord]]s. 
*Invader slain at [[Sethria's Roost]] x6

==Description==
We need to place pressure on the assault camp at [[Sethria's Roost]]. [[Ragnaros]]' minions are using this area as a point to push their battlefront beyond the bounds of [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]]. I'm putting you in charge of a small squad to deal with them.

I have selected an elite group of fighters to assist you. Travel to Sethria's Roost. Your compatriots have been instructed to meet you once you arrive. Then put an end to the elementals' assault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|80}}
*86750 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|206700}} at max level)
*+350 reputation [[Guardians of Hyjal]]
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2

==Progress==
I believe your assignment requires you to be in Hyjal, <race>.

==Completion==
A job well done, soldier. While our mission in the Firelands is critical, we must not forget about the well-being of Hyjal.

Speak with my brother again tomorrow, and he will have another squad prepared for you.

==Notes==
Head back to the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] to pick up this quest. Return to [[Malfurion's Breach]] on the [[Molten Front]] to turn in.

Sethria's Roost has been taken over by level 85 elite [[Fiery Behemoth]]s and [[Seething Pyrelord]]s with 774k health.

*{{abilities|Chain Fireball|Hurls a fireball at the enemy, dealing 1429 to 1661 Fire damage and then jumping to additional nearby enemies. Affects 5 total targets.|range=40|notes=Instant.}}

*{{abilities|Reflective Shield|Wraps the caster in a shield that lasts up to 8 sec, reflecting any absorbed damage back onto the attacker.|notes=2 sec cast. Interruptible. A protector will yell the following when this is cast:}}
**{{text|yell|Don't attack it while the shield is up!}}

=== The Hyjal Protector party === 
Players will not have to solo these elites. Upon landing in Sethria's Roost, players will receive a group of 4 NPCs including 3 [[Hyjal Protector]]s, taking the role of bear, cat and caster, and a random one from the following 40:
