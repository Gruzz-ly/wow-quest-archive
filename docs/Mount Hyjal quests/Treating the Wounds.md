==Objectives==
Obtain 4 Sulfur-Laced Wrappings from [[Fiery Behemoth]]s in [[Sethria's Roost]].
*[[Sulfur-Laced Wrapping]] (4)

==Description==
We have an ample supply of medical supplies here at the [[Sanctuary of Malorne|Sanctuary]], but we mustn't lose sight of the fact that we are at war. [[Hamuul Runetotem|Hamuul]] isn't the only person who has need of bandages.

The fiery behemoths that roam Sethria's Roost wear flame-resistant wrappings that will serve Hamuul as ably as any bandage. Bring me those wrappings, and I will prepare them for use on the Arch Druid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1 and {{cost|7|10}}
*52050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|12|40|50}} at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
There are some who say that the sulfur in those wrappings has curative properties. Personally, I am unconvinced, but I am willing to endure the smell on the off-chance that it does.

==Completion==
Many thanks, <class>.

You do the war effort a favor. Burn victims have a notorious appetite for bandages, and Hamuul is no exception.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Protectors of Hyjal]] before heading out. The fiery behemoths are elites at [[Sethria's Roost]] and are more easily killed with a party of NPCs helping.
