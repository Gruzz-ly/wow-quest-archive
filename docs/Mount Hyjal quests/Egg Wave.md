==Objectives==
Equip a [[:Twilight Firelance]] and fly [[Aviana's Guardian]]. Smash 40 Firelands Eggs by running over them. Press the flap button to flap your mount's wings!
*Firelands Egg Destroyed (40)

==Description==
Without any defenders, the Firelands eggs are vulnerable.

Take wing once more and smash those eggs! Simply rush over them to crush them. Search all the nooks, crannies, and side-caves. Hurry! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gold Mini Jouster|Blue Mini Jouster}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}} and [[Beware of the 'Unbeatable?' Pterodactyl]]

==Progress==
Have you cracked a few eggs?

I don't even want to know what the [[Twilight's Hammer]] was breeding down here...

==Completion==
A decisive blow!

==Notes==
Boulders are still falling, but now it's time to smash eggs. Fly to a lower ledge, land and run around smashing eggs. Then fly to another ledge until hitting 40.

The easiest method of destroying the eggs is to aim for the platforms on the edge of the cavern. You can more or less "crash land" at the back of the platform then ride rather fly your bird around until all eggs on it are destroyed.  Of particular note is a large tunnel at the bottom of the cavern that holds many eggs and is trivial to land in.

Completing this quest will also unlock the daily quest [[Vigilance on Wings]]; completing the daily quest ten times grants an achievement - [[The 'Unbeatable?' Pterodactyl: BEATEN.]] - that rewards you with whichever companion pet you didn't take from this quest.
