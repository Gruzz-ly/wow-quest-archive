==Objectives==
Equip a [[:Twilight Firelance]] and fly [[Aviana's Guardian]]. Kill 10 Twilight Knight Riders by flying into them. Press the flap button to flap your mount's wings!
*[[Twilight Knight Rider]] slain (10)

==Description==
Here they come, <name>! The Twilight Knight Riders, astride black buzzards birthed in the scorching sulfurous breeding pools of the [[Firelands]]. The only way to defeat them is from the sky!

Take wing once more, <class>, and slay them.

Run into enemy riders with your lance to destroy them.

Go forth. Fly, fool. Fly!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Flap! Flap I say... FLAP!

==Completion==
Spectacular flying, <name>! Their screeches of anguish echoed about this light-forsaken cavern.

But our work is not yet finished...

==Notes==
This isn't timed&mdash;take as much time as necessary. The guardian flags disappear and the Twilight Buzzards appear. It's time to take them out! They are flying about, but they do not attack back. Remember to lead them a little in order to be in the same spot at the same time.
