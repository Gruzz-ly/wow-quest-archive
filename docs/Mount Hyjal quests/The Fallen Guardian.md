'''The Fallen Guardian''' is offered by [[Ysera]] inside the [[Nordrassil Inn]].

==Objectives==
Confront and slay Alysra at the [[Ruins of Lar'donir]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].
*[[Alysra]] slain

==Description==
[[Fandral Staghelm]] was kept prisoner here in Hyjal. It was the green dragon Alysra - one of my very own! - who was in charge of keeping Fandral secure.

We can only conclude that the [[Twilight's Hammer]] has gotten to her. You must confront her, <name>. Destroy her if you must - I cannot bear to see it.

She was last seen in the Ruins of Lar'donir, west of the [[Nordrassil|World Tree]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*86750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Completion==
Alysra has been brought to justice, but from her mangled remains emerged something else. A creature of living flame, twisted to serve the will of the [[Ragnaros|Firelord]].

You suspect your paths may someday [[Alysrazor|cross again]].

==Notes==
Fly to the [[Ruins of Lar'donir]] and speak to [[Alysra]]:
:It is you again, <class>.
:Is something wrong?
:<Alysra's tail flinches, and her eyes dart back and forth under their lids.>
:{{gossip|''You turned Fandral Staghelm over to the Twilight's Hammer. Why have you betrayed the dragonflights?''}}

Alysra will turn hostile while saying:

:{{text|say|Alysra|No, NO! I didn't "betray" the dragonflights.  We were all betrayed.  Ysera was lost in a dream while this whole world came undone.}}


Alysra has 232K health and 17816 mana. If she runs of of mana, she will reset. Eventually she will take a deep breath and cast Living Flame, shooting green fireballs in all directions. Hide behind the broken pillars that surround the area until it subsides.

Once she is killed, [[Leyara]] and some [[Druids of the Flame]] will arrive:

:{{text|say|Druid of the Flame|We are too late!  They killed her, as Fandral predicted.}}
:{{text|say|Leyara|No, the Firelord has already claimed this one for his own.  Do you doubt his power?}}

They will begin to channel a spell on her, causing her corpse to burn. Once the spell is complete, she will turn into [[Alysrazor]] and fly away, saying:

:{{text|say|Alysrazor|Reborn in flame!}}
