Completing this quest opens up the daily quest [[Strike at the Heart]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 125 Marks of the World Tree.
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] (125)

==Description==
The [[ancient]]s await in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]]. The [[Firelands]] will prove a dangerous place for them considering their... composition, but their strength will be of great use to us if we are to face any of [[Ragnaros]]' lieutenants.

Gather your marks, and seek out [[Elderlimb]] at the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]]. If they are to march with us, he would be the one leading them through the portal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|188000}}
*86750 XP (or {{coppercost|206700}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Greetings to you, young one.

==Completion==
I understand.  We are prepared.  We shall join the march and meet you on the far side of the portal.

==Notes==
Upon completion of ''both'' [[Druids of the Talon (quest)]] and [[The Shadow Wardens]], Varlan will phase in on the west side of [[Malfurion's Breach]], south of the empty [[moonwell]].

During this phase, players can earn a maximum of 27 marks each day, so this quest will take five days to complete.

Upon completing the quest, the following dialog occurs:
: {{text|say|Elderlimb|Yes, <class>.  We foresaw this day long ago, and we are ready.}}
: {{text|say|Elderlimb|We cannot let [[Deathwing]] win.  Should he triumph in this war, then all life will perish.}}
: {{text|say|Elderlimb|Come, protectors!  We lend the strength of the ancients to this battle!  And we shall not fall!}}

==Patch changes==
