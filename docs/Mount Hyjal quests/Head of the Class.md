== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Instructor Mylva}} at the [[Forge of Supplication]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
That settles it, "<name>damus!" You are head of your class!

You will get a chance to address a crowd of the most fanatical, bloodthirsty and certifiably insane people on [[Azeroth|this planet]].

Go report to your instructor for the details, but remember: your goal is to exploit the animosity between the ogres at the [[Seat of the Chosen]] and the other, less privileged races.

If all goes well, we will smuggle {{NPC||Jarod Shadowsong||Jarod}} out of here during the ensuing riot.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

== Completion ==
There you are, <name>damus. I've been meaning to talk to you about something.

I heard about the [[Speech Writing for Dummies|unfortunate incident]] that befell our poor friend, {{NPC||Okrog}}.

<Mylva looks to her left, then her right. She finally nods and shoots a sly wink in your direction.

You might be a better pupil than I had thought.
