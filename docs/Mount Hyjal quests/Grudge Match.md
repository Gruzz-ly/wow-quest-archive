== Objectives ==
Challenge {{NPC||Gromm'ko}} at the [[Seat of the Chosen]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*Grudge Match

== Description ==
I don't know if you've picked up on this, but there's a bit of a rivalry between the [[ogre]] members of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] and the rest of us.

For me... it's personal.

This one ogre called Gromm'ko has a pet [[raptor]] named "[[Butcher]]." He's taken out the last three of my [[core hound|corehound]] pups.

I think this last one will fare differently. He's got a real killer's instinct.

Go to the Seat of the Chosen and challenge Gromm'ko to a match between our two beasts. Humiliate him for me, <name>damus.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|15|60}}

== Progress ==
Is it done, <name>damus? Did our little champ make it out ok?

== Completion ==
That's how it's done!

== Notes ==
Head west, then take the north fork to the [[Seat of the Chosen]]. Inside the building to the left of the big cave at {{coords|77.8|51.4|Mount Hyjal}} is Gromm'ko.
:My raptor can take on ANYTHING and ANYONE!
{{gossip|''{{NPC||Instructor Devoran}} sends a contender against your raptor.''}}
:''A Spawn of Smolderos attacks and eventually kills Butcher. Then:''
:{{text|yell|Gromm'ko|You! Your mutt killed my Butcher! I will crush you!}}
:''Gromm'ko turns hostile. Kill him to complete the quest.''

This concludes Devoran's quests. Do Mylva's and Ortell's quests to continue the storyline.
