==Objectives==
Use the Totem of Tortolla and the help of a [[Child of Tortolla]] to defeat Nemesis. see [[Garunda Mountainpeak]] if you lose your companion.
*[[Nemesis]] slain
*[[Totem of Tortolla]] (provided)

==Description==
Your turtle companion can use this newfound power to render the two of you invulnerable for a short period of time. You can "turtle up" to avoid the worst of Nemesis and his fury. To do so, simply invoke this totem.

This is all I can do for you. Together, you and a Child of Tortolla must defeat Nemesis, once and for all. Finish the Usurper!

Return to me if you lose your turtle friend.

("Nemesis, the Usurper: Use your totem and turtle companion to withstand his eruption attack. The false God must be destroyed!")

==Progress==
Is Nemesis dead?

==Completion==

Twilight's Hammer dreamed of creating their own pantheon of twisted ancients to rule over the land, sea, and air. With you're help, they've all been executed.

We must tell Tortolla at once!

==Notes==
Head to the south end of the cave and charge him!

Nemesis is a level 81 elite with 111,000 health and only one ability outside of basic melee:
*{{abilities|Molten Fury|range=40|Nemesis EXPLODES with the volcanic fury of a hundred suns, damaging all enemies in a 40-yard radius.|notes=4.5 sec cast}}

At least every 20 seconds, Nemesis will emote {{text|bossemote|Nemesis is about to erupt!}} and start casting Molten Fury. Use the totem during the cast to go immune and avoid the damage, which can hit for up to 20,000 Fire damage.
