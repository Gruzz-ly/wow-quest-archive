==Objectives==
Seek the Twilight Encampment north of [[Nordrassil]] and use Tholo's Horn.
*Infiltrators' encampment burnt
*[[Tholo's Horn]] (provided)

==Description==
We've identified the general direction where the infiltrators have been coming from, thanks to your work.

Now we just need to shut down their camp and put an end to their operations this side of Nordrassil.

Take this horn. It will signal one of our [[green dragonflight|emerald drakes]] to swoop down and give these [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight cultists]] a taste of the flames they so madly worship.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Girdle of Nullified Infiltration|Hornblower's Legguards|Poisonfire Greatsword}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Is it done yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>. That should put a stop to the attacks once we finish [[Scalding Rock Elemental|these elementals]] off.

==Notes==
By north he means the northwest corner of the valley surrounding the world tree at {{co|55.8|15.2|Mount Hyjal||1}} where three [[Twilight Infiltrator (Mount Hyjal)|Twilight Infiltrators]] stand watch.

==Progression==
{{Nordrassil}}
