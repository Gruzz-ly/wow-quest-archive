'''Guardians of Hyjal: Firelands Invasion!''' is the breadcrumb to the [[Firelands Invasion]] series of daily quests at the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]] of [[Mount Hyjal]] and the [[Molten Front]] of the [[Firelands]]. As the Regrowth comes into existence roughly half way through the [[Mount Hyjal quests|Mount Hyjal storyline]], players must have completed at least [[Aessina's Miracle]] before Hero's Call Boards will offer this quest.

If players have not quested in Hyjal up to that point, Hero's Call Boards will instead offer [[Guardians of Hyjal: Call of the Ancients (Alliance)]] instead as a not-so-subtle reminder to players that they need to get questing.

==Objectives==
Report to [[Matoclaw]] at the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

==Description==
The [[Guardians of Hyjal]], led by [[Malfurion Stormrage|Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage]], seek brave heroes to assist with a full-scale assault on the [[Firelands]].

Willing and able-bodied heroes of the [[Alliance]] should report to the Sanctuary of Malorne in Mount Hyjal immediately.

==Completion==
Thank you for answering our call for aid, <name>.

==Notes==
This quest can be skipped, as it does not count for such achievements as [[Loremaster of Cataclysm]]. It is merely a breadcrumb from capital cities to Hyjal in 4.2.

==Progression==
