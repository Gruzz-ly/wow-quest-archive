== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Failed Supplicants at [[Doom's Vigil]].
*[[Failed Supplicant]] slain x5

== Description ==
You've made it this far. Others haven't.

Go to Doom's Vigil, just north of here. We've rounded up all the... failures. I want you to help take care of them. It'll be good for your spiritual growth.

If this cold-blooded act gives you trouble, think of it as their second chance. Should any of them manage to kill you... well, 
they'll take your spot.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Supplicant's Discarded Bracer|Belt of Swift Failure|Chestguard of Rapid Promotion}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Well, <name>? Is it done?

== Completion ==
You're on the fast-track to success. Let us hope you don't ruin your track record with such silly notions as compassion and humaneness.

Come, then. Let us discuss your future.

== Notes ==
Exit the camp, head north, then take the fork to the right to reach [[Doom's Vigil]]. There's a decently large group of Failed Supplicants being guarded by some Twilight Guards just inside camp.

This concludes Mylva's quests. Do Devoran's and Ortell's quests to continue the storyline.

Despite the abhorrent nature of this quest, there is no way to skip it or complete it in a more morally palatable way. It is required to complete the Mount Hyjal storyline.
