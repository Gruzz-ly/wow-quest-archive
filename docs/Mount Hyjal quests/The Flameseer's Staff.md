== Objectives ==
Obtain 8 Charred Staff Fragments.
*[[Charred Staff Fragment]] x8

== Description ==
A powerful artifact known as the Flameseer's Staff was lost during the initial onslaught by the [[Twilight's Hammer|enemy forces]]. It was an ancient bonse staff that granted its wielder power over the elements of fire.

Its fragments litter the area around us. Find them and bring them to {{NPC||Malfurion Stormrage||Malfurion}}. Perhaps the artifact's power will still be of use.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Yes, <name>?

== Completion ==
Excellent, <name>. This will be a great weapon against the enemy forces.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[War on the Twilight's Hammer]] before heading out.

Fragments litter the areas that are actively on fire.

==Progression==
