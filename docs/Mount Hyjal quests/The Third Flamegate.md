Pay attention to his gossip text as he completes the quest:
:I cannot fathom the origin or purpose of this place.
:These corridors are used for troop movements, yes, but they're also littered with charred and tortured corpsoes, some partially devoured, most simply crushed and beaten.
:We are in the Firelands, but I feel as though we've crossed the threshold into hell.
