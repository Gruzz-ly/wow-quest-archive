== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Lycanthoth.jpg|Lycanthoth the Corruptor|Use the incense within the Maw of Lycanthoth to summon the beast.}}
Use Lycanthoth's Incense within the [[Maw of Lycanthoth]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]] to summon and kill Lycanthoth.
*[[Lycanthoth]] slain
*[[Lycanthoth's Incense]] (provided)

== Description ==
I think I understand what's happening here. The [[Twilight's Hammer]] fears that the ancients may someday rise up to oppose them. They'll do anything to stop the return of {{NPC||Goldrinn}}.

This "Lycanthoth" is a twisted version of our beloved wolf god, summoned by the Twilight's Hammer to replace him.

Bah! It is but a shadow of Goldrinn's power. <Name>, kill this beast so that the true ancient can return. Take this incense and burn it in the Maw of Lycanthoth east of here. Slay that beast and free Goldrinn!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Clutches of the Worgen Spirit|Primal Force Girdle|Goldrinn's Locket}}

== Progress ==
Your bravery is an inspiration to others, <class>. Tell me your name.

== Completion ==
You were brave to face down Lycanthoth, <name>. Like myself, he was a primal force of nature... but his origins were from a darker place.

Those who birthed that beast reached deep into the blackness, channeling powers never intended for this world.

Come, <class>.  Climb onto my back, and let us show these beasts the true face of ferocity!

== Notes ==
Head east along the northern portion of the valley and enter the cave. Enter the cave at at {{co|32.4|37.3|Mount Hyjal||1}} to find [[Lycanthoth's Altar]]. Using the incense will summon Lycanthoth. His first move is to cast the Miasama of Terror&mdash;A veil of terror surrounds the gruesome visage of Lycanthoth.

:{{text|say|Lycanthoth|Log'loth og shandai, mortal. Only death is eternal. You will be undone.}}
:{{text|say|Lycanthoth|Fate subjugates faith, mortal. Your prayers are meaningless here.}}

On complete... the camera follows Goldrinn as he frees the captives and utterly obliterates the vandals at the shrine. He then runs to his statue and drops the player off, offering [[The Shrine Reclaimed (Alliance)|The Shrine Reclaimed]].

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}
