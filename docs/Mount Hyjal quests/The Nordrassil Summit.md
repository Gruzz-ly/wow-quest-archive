==Objectives==
Speak with [[Thrall]] under the [[Nordrassil|World Tree]] in [[Mount Hyjal]] and witness the [[Earthen Ring]] ceremony. 
*Witness the Ceremony

==Description==
Hello, <class>! My brothers and sisters of the Earthen Ring have spoke well of your deeds in the wake of the [[Cataclysm]]. But much remains to be done if we are to heal this broken world.

Walk with me, friend. Preparations for a ceremony are underway, a ritual that I hope will be a turning point in our battle against the [[Twilight's Hammer]].

When all is done, you will be able to spread the word about our triumph here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*52050 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|124050}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
It can't be over. We mustn't give up hope!

==Notes==
Speak to Thrall again:
:I believe [[Aggra]] is almost here, and the other [[dragon aspect|aspects]] have assembled.
:Are you ready to begin, <name>?
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}

A cinematic will start:
<poem>
''Thrall, Aggra and the player walk to the four dragon aspects standing near the bank of the [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|Well of Eternity]]: [[Kalecgos]], [[Alexstrasza]], [[Ysera]], and [[Nozdormu]].
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Do you think it will work, Go'el? The druids and shaman uniting to restore the World Tree... Could it actually heal this broken world?}}
{{Text|Say|Thrall|The Aspects believe it will. And they should know...}}
{{Text|Say|Thrall|...They grew it in the first place.}}
{{Text|Say|Ysera|Welcome, Son of Durotan. And to you, Aggralan of the Frostwolves.}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Lady Ysera.}}
''[[Malfurion Stormrage]] comes from above, shifting from flight form to humanoid form.''
{{Text|Say|Malfurion Stormrage|Greetings, friends.}}
{{Text|Say|Malfurion Stormrage|I sense a vast power has grown within you, young Thrall. You've achieved much, since last we met.}}
{{Text|Say|Thrall|Master Stormrage, It's good to have you back in the waking world.}}
{{Text|Say|Ysera|Friends, We have gathered here today to heal this world that we've sacrificed so much to save.}}
{{Text|Say|Ysera|For the first time, the [[Earthen Ring]] and the [[Cenarion Circle]] will unite - to restore this great Tree - thereby healing the whole of Azeroth.}}
{{Text|Say|Nozdormu|Time is precious, sister. Let us see to our ritual...}} 
[[File:The Nordrassil Summit Interrupted.jpg|thumb|The Twilight Cultists make their appearance.]] ''The earth is shaking. 5 meteors fall from the sky. The smoke begins to clear, revealing 5 Night elf Twilight's Hammer cultists.''
{{Text|Say|Mysterious Stranger|I'm sorry, are we interrupting?}}
{{Text|Say|Thrall|The [[Twilight's Hammer]]!}}
''4 of the 5 cultists begin to cast a spell.''
{{Text|Say|Mysterious Stranger|Not so fast, Son of [[Durotan]]! You and your allies have certainly set us back. but the [[Hour of Twilight]] CANNOT be averted!}}
{{Text|Say|Mysterious Stranger|The [[Twilight Prophet]] knows that YOU - and you alone - are our final obstacle. He's sent ME to remove you from the game.}}
{{Text|Say|Thrall|I do not fear death.}}
''The mysterious stranger laughs''
{{Text|Say|Mysterious Stranger|Death? Who said anything about death?}}
{{Text|Say|Mysterious Stranger|You may be this world's greatest shaman, Thrall - but you are only mortal. This is my master's curse upon you - turning your great bond with the elements... into your undoing!}}
''Thrall begins to levitate.''
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Go'el! NO!}}
''Thrall begins to split into the 4 essences of the elements, when all 4 essences appear, Thrall himself disappears. The essences turn into spheres of fire, water, earth and air.''
{{Text|Say|Mysterious Stranger|Even now, the elements are tearing you apart - and they shall feed upon your doubts and fears 'till the last spark of life on this wretched world has been snuffed out.}}
''The spheres fly and disappear. Malfurion runs towards the cultist. The cultists that were casting the spell are knocked down.
{{Text|Say|Malfurion Stormrage|You'll regret this, stranger!}}
''The cultists laugh as Malfurion casts Entangling roots.
{{Text|Say|Mysterious Stranger|Will I?}}
''The cultists burst into flames, burning the roots and the Twilight's hammer robes. Fandral Staghelm, Leyara and three other Druids of the Flame are revealed as the smoke begins to clear.''
{{Text|Say|Fandral Staghelm|Come, shan'do - certainly you recognize your former pupil?}}
{{text|emote|[[Leyara]] barks a cruel laugh.}}
{{Text|Say|Malfurion Stormrage|Fandral - what have they done to you?}}
{{Text|Say|Fandral Staghelm|Naive as always, I see. Your pet orc cannot save you now, Malfurion.}}
{{Text|Say|Fandral Staghelm|And the flame of our vengeance draws near, Be ready.}}
''The Druids of the Flame roar and disappear in pillars of fire.''
{{Text|Say|Malfurion Stormrage|Fandral is corrupting fellow druids into something sinister. He may have other followers already - I must warn [[Moonglade]].}}
''Malfurion turns into a crow and flies away. Aggra falls to her knees and begs Ysera.''
{{Text|Say|Aggra|But what of Go'el?}}
''Aggra rises.''
{{Text|Say|Ysera|He was the Earthen Ring's most powerful shaman. and the ceremony cannot continue without him. But we must be prepared to accept that he may be lost forever...}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|No! Those mongrels have stolen my Go'el, but I will NOT forsake him. Ancestors forgive me - my heart feels stolen away with him.}}
</poem>

All five of the NPCs have gossip text:
;Kalecgos: I wish I could aid you in your plight, mortal. But the [[blue dragonflight]] is in disarray, and there are other urgent matters here at the World Tree that I've been sent to investigate...
;Alexstrasza: The world shaman - shattered by the hand of Fandral Staghelm?
:Greater powers are at work here. Ragnaros has pushed his strength farther into this realm than I would have imagined.
:The Firelord must be stopped!
;Ysera: Fandral Staghelm has returned as a ... "Druid of the Flame"?
:I fear [[Alysra|one of my own]] may be implicated in this betrayal!
;Nozdormu: Yes, <class>, things appear bleak. But know that even as things appear to unravel, they do so with greater purpose.
:<Despite his comforting words, Nozdormu looks stricken, if not ill.>
;Aggra: Go'el - the one you call Thrall - his spirit has been scattered across the elemental planes.
:The Twilight's Hammmer thinks to shake our will... but we shall not weaken. We will not forsake Go'el.
:He has risked everything to save this world, and we'll do no less for him!

Speak with Aggra to continue.
