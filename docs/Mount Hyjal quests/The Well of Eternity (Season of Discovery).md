==Objectives==
There is an abandoned [[druid]] camp on the south side of the [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|well of eternity]]. Gather 12 pieces of Nordrassil Detritus scattered around the base of the [[World Tree|world tree]] and place them inside the [[Hyjal Bonfire]] to ignite the flame.
*[[Nordrassil Detritus]] (12)
*[[Inert Ashbringer]]

==Description==
We are close now. The cataclysmic destruction that the ancient [[Kaldorei]] [[Ghost|spirits]] wrought upon the [[demon lord]] [[Archimonde]] took a terrible toll on the tree. The explosion scattered a myriad of debris in the area.

Gather fragments of [[Nordrassil]] from beneath the tree's boughs. We will use that to create a special fire in which to heat the blade, before quenching it in the waters of the well itself. The magic will harden and bind the blade, restoring the magic that left it when it was shattered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
The bonfire before you looks like a perfect place to heat the blade.

==Completion==
The Nordrassil branches you’ve gathered are now neatly arranged on the remnants of the bonfire. All that remains is to set it alight.

==Progression==
