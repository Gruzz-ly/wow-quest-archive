==Objectives==
Use the Drums of the Turtle God to help you defeat King Moltron.
*[[King Moltron]] slain
*[[Drums of the Turtle God]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[magma giant]]s who serve [[Ragnaros]] are kept in line by their king's heavy-handed rule. Were we to take care of him, the rest will surely fall into disarray.

Without the giants, the fight on the ground will get a lot more even. Perhaps even tilt to our favor.

But felling the magma monarch will be no easy task.  Use these drums to enlist the help of the great [[Tortolla]] who is capable of holding off King Moltron for an eternity. But holding him off won't be enough —- and that's where you come in.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|16|40}}

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. We shall soon claim victory in Hyjal.

It has been an honor to fight along your side.

==Notes==
Moltron is behind [[Sulfuron Spire]] at {{coords|43.5|83.6|Mount Hyjal}} on the [[Throne of Flame]]. Moltron is an 82 elite molten giant with 667,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Flame Stomp|Deals 115 to 116 Fire damage to nearby enemies, knocking them back.|notes=1.5 sec cast. Hits for what the tooltip says it does.}}
*{{abilities|Melee|4100-5800 Physical on Tortolla.}}
Find a safe spot to land relatively near him, then use the drums to call Tortolla. Tortolla has over a million health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Crushing Bite|range=Melee|Snaps at the target, causing 206% weapon damage and reducing the target's armor by 50% for 10 sec.|notes=1 sec cast. Hits for 10,000-14,000 Physical.}}
*{{abilities|Headbutt|range=10|Inflicts normal damage plus 3090 to nearby enemies and knocks them back.|notes=Instant. Hits for 9000-11,200 Physical}}
*{{abilities|Melee|5200-7300 Physical on Moltron.}}
When Tortolla is summoned, he will initiate the fight like any good [[tank]]; it is best to join in after. Tortolla's aid is not an automatic victory - his high health can absorb Moltron's hits well, but he will run out eventually, so do attack efficiently. On the other hand, it is possible to pull [[aggro]] off of Tortolla, at which point Moltron's high damage output can quickly become a problem, so higher level damage dealers may need to watch their [[threat]].
