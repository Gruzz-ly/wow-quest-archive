== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Tyrus Blackhorn}} and convince him to help in the fight against the [[Twilight's Hammer]].
*Blackthron Persuaded

== Description ==
South [[Grove of Aessina|of here]] you'll find a solitary tower, known as "[[Blackhorn's Penance]]." Upon it is bound a demon: Tyrus Blackhorn.

You may think me mad for turning to an old foe for help, but Blackthorn was once a mortal, and I can't imagine he wants to watch Twilight's Hammer triumph.

Speak with Blackthorn, and see if you can convince him to help us in our fight. He may yet redeem himself.

...Just don't set him free!

== Progress ==
You were sent here to talk, <race>. So. Talk.

== Completion ==
Very well, <race>. I will help you mortals, even from within my bonds.

But don't sicken me by claiming it's my redemption. I do this for my own ends.

<Blackhorn's sudden grin is unsettling.>

== Notes ==
Before accepting, talk to Matoclaw:
{{dialogue|Welcome, <class>.

Hyjal burns and the world I've spent my life protecting is on the brink of oblivion.

Tell me: Have you ever heard of Tyrus Blackhorn?

{{gossip|Who is Tryus Blackhorn?}}

[[Third War|A decade ago]], a [[Twilight of the Gods|great battle]] took place here on [[Hyjal Summit|the summit]] of [[Mount Hyjal]]. {{NPC||Archimonde the Defiler}} commanded a swarm of demons to march upon the [[Nordrassil|World Tree]] and claim its power for his own.

His defeat signaled the [[Burning Legion|Legion's]] invasion of [[Azeroth]]... But many of his corrupted supporters remained behind.

{{gossip|Blackhorn is a demon?}}

Yes and no. He may be a demon now, but Tyrus Blackthorn was a [[night elf]] once. Like many of his brothers he was wooed and transformed by the promises of power the demonic army whispered in his ear.

He was captured after his master's defeat and imprisoned here on the summit, his immortal form bound by sacred energies.

But perhaps the dimmest flicker of a soul still burns within him... We must at least reach out to know for sure.}}

Fly southeast and talk to Blackhorn:
:<Race>. Have you been sent to speak with me? How long has it been since the master's demise on these very slopes?
{{gossip|''Yes, Blackhorn. I've been sent to request your aid, if you are willing.''}}
:My help? Have things really grown so dire?
:<The distant flames flicker in Blackhorn's cruel, dark eyes.>
:Tell me why I shouldn't let your world burn.
{{gossip|''You were a mortal once, Blackhorn. One of us.''}}<br/>
{{gossip|''You'll be destroyed if the Twilight's Hammer brings this mountain down!''}}<br/>
{{gossip|''{{NPC||Matoclaw}} believes that you may yet be redeemed. This is your chance to atone for siding with demons.''}}

To see the most story, choose mortal, then redemption, then destruction. The shortest path to completion is by choosing the destruction option:
;Mortal:
:Mortal? Yes I was once mortal. Weak.
:You see my bonds now? These restraints are nothing compared to being shackled within a mortal coil.
:Even now the master's gifts stir within me, ready to be unleashed.
:No, <class>, my mortal days have passed, and if any flame of my former life still flickers within I would wish it extinguished. You'll have to do better than that, <race>.
{{gossip|''You'll be destroyed if the Twilight's Hammer brings this mountain down!''}}<br/>{{gossip|''Where is your master now, Blackhorn? It's not too late to turn to the light...''}}
;Redemption:
:<Blackhorn strains against his bonds, for the first time visibly upset.>
:Redemption! You act as if there's an escape from the Burning Legion. So smug! As though your efforts a decade ago or in Outland have slowed the Legion a single iota! They will come, <race>. They will return. And I will be here to welcome them.
[[File:GossipGossipIcon.png]] ''Assuming there's a world left for your legion to conquer. The Twilight's Hammer seeks to destroy everything.
;Destruction:
:Destroyed? Yes, that's possible. At night I am haunted with visions of this world being torn asunder from within. I feel neither sorrow nor rage. Merely... curiosity.
:I served my master in exchange for power, <class>. But those you fight... they strive for oblivion. A strange motivation.
{{gossip|''Will you help us to defeat them?''}}
:{{text|say|Tyrus Blackhorn|Madness. Chaos. Much as I thrill to see the titans' work undone, I do wish to remain alive when the master returns. I will help you.}}

Blackhorn's gossip text has updated now:
:<Blackhorn gazes out across the distant inferno, then turns his attention back to you.>
