==Objectives==
Use the Orb of Ascension and answer 10 answers correctly.
*Mental Training x10
*[[Orb of Ascension]] (provided)

==Description==
You might think you're ready to receive the knowledge we're to impart on you. But you are not.

Think of your mind as a box inside a series of other boxes.

Each step of our training will open one of those boxes, until you are ready to achieve direct communication with the elements.

Take the Core of Ascension and answer all questions it asks of you, truthfully. Failing to do so could be... fatal.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
You've returned.

==Completion==
You've succeeded, <name>. You're ready for the next step.

==Notes==
Use the item to start the event. Players now have three abilities: Answer Yes, Answer No, and Dismiss Orb of Ascension. The orb will ask a series of simple yes-no questions. Players have five seconds to choose an answer or they will take a healthy chunk of damage. After getting ten questions correct, the event should automatically end, but use the Dismiss button if necessary.

Sample questions include:
*Are deserts lush? - No
*Does fire consume stone? - No
*Do murderers kill? - Yes
*Do rivers flow upstream? - No
*Do wolves howl? - Yes
*Is blood red? - Yes
*Is fire hot? - Yes
*Is ice hot? - No
