== Objectives ==
Locate and rescue 8 Lost Wardens.
*{{NPC||Lost Warden}} Rescued x8

== Description ==
We held out as long as we could, <class> But the flames... the heat... We lost the whole town.

{{NPC||Captain Irontree}} refused to pull back when the flames engulfed us. Our forces are scattered. Maybe some of the others survived? We can mount a counter-attack!

Go into the [[Scorched Plain]] and rescue any lost wardens that got separated from the group. Then find Captain Irontree - he's probably taken up a fortified position in the middle of the fighting.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
What?

== Completion ==
You've assembled the survivors? Good, good. And the rest of [[Mount Hyjal|the mountain]] - healed?

Haha strike me down! We're on the front lines again!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Breakthrough]] before heading out. Head east along the road, killing and saving along the way. Keep heading east to find a ruined inn filled to the rafters with Irontree Wardens guarding it. Irontree is at {{coords|57.1|55.9|Mount Hyjal}} inside on the bottom floor. Above him is {{NPC||Logram}}, offering a fetch quest, [[Hyjal Recycling Program]]. Pick it up before killing all of the scorchlords.
*Wha - where am I? Are you one of them?
*Twilight's Hammer... I heard them screaming and running... are we making a counter-attack?
*Must ... return to ... Irontree!
*Is it all over yet?
*They've opened gateways to the Firelands... tell me there's still hope!
*I'm burned. Badly.
*The town... demolished!  We couldn't stop them.
