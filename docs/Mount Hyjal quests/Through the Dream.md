== Objectives ==
Deliver {{NPC||Fandral Staghelm||Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm}} to {{NPC||Alysra}} at the entrance of the [[Hyjal Barrow Dens|Barrow Dens]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
Alysra's plan might be necessary, <name>. I don't know how much longer we can hold off the cultists.

Fandral Staghelm is bound by powerful spells. He won't be able to escape you, even inside the [[Emerald Dream]].

Beware, though, for all we know the [[Emerald Nightmare|nightmare]] has spread to this part of the world inside the dream.

Take Fandral to the surface and hand him to Alysra. Let us hope he's more secure in [[Moonglade]] than he is here.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Muffling Hood|Grips of Arcane Imprisonment|Dreamrending Dagger}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Completion ==
You did well, <name>. I will take Fandral to Moonglade myself.

His prison will be far enough from the battlefront there.

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest will instantly shift the player to the [[Emerald Dream]]! Alas, the nightmare has reached this part of the world as there are {{NPC||Nightmare Terror}}s everywhere. Retrace steps (heading northwesterly) out of the barrow dens, where Alysra waits.

==Progression==
{{Nordrassil}}
