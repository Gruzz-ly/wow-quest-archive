== Objectives ==
Report what you've discovered to {{NPC||Thisalee Crow}} at [[Sethria's Roost]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

== Description ==
<This elaborate book contains hundreds of vellum pages bound within a slate cover. It's written in many [[language]]s, most unfamiliar. Carefully inked illustrations depict [[sorcerer]]s or even entire buildings vanishing into curtains of shadow.>

<Many illustrations depict magical artifices like those you see around camp. You suspect the dragon {{NPC||Sethria}} is trying to keep something hidden. Thisalee will want to hear about this!>

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

== Completion ==
They're doing what?

They're cloaking something? Of course - so our aerial scouts can't see anything with our eagle-eyes!

== Notes ==
While out and about for [[Sethria's Brood]] and [[A Gap in Their Armor]] at [[Sethria's Roost]], keep an eye out for the Codex of Shadows at {{coords|31.3|77.1|Mount Hyjal}}.

==Progression==
